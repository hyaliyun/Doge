The Safavids, under King (Shah) Abbas I (1588‚Äì1629), beat a numerically superior, fully-fledged Ottoman army. It was one of King Abbas I's greatest military victories. According to Colin Imber: \\"For the Ottomans the battle of Sufiyan was a greater disaster than anything they had experienced in Hungary, where the war which had begun in 1593 had revealed Ottoman military deficiencies in the face of new European weapons and tactics.\\" Prelude In 1603, Abbas I recaptured Tabriz and Nakhchivan from the Ottomans, territories which the Safavids had been forced to cede in 1590. In the same year, the Ottomans were already fighting on two fronts‚Äîin Hungary against the Habsburgs and in Anatolia against the Jelalis. Abbas I proceeded to recover Erivan the next year, in June 1604. In the same month, the Ottomans dispatched Cƒ±ƒüalazade Yusuf Sinan Pasha (hereafter, simply \\"Sinan Pasha\\") from Constantinople, Istanbul, towards Erzurum with a large number of Janissaries to fight Abbas and his men. Around the time of Sinan Pasha's march, Abbas I had reached Kars, at the frontier of Georgia. He ordered the destruction of the countryside between Kars and Erzurum, employing similar scorched earth tactics his grandfather Tahmasp I (1524‚Äì1576) had employed against the Ottomans. When Abbas realized that Sinan Pasha did not intend to spend the winter in the region before continuing the campaign in the spring and was therefore moving straight towards Kars, he ordered the immediate mass evacuation \\"of the entire population, most of them Armenian Christians, over a wide area to the north of the Aras River, and embracing the three towns of Erivan, Nakhichivan and [Old] Julfa\\". By November 1604, the Turks led by Sinan Pasha reached Kars, which the Iranians had evacuated. Though Sinan Pasha wanted to continue towards Shirvan, his officers forced him to move south across the Aras. He established his winter encampment at Van, awaiting reinforcements. Safavid spies informed Abbas of Sinan Pasha's decision; he immediately ordered general Allahverdi Khan to attack the town of Van before the reinforcements could arrive. Upon reaching Van, Allahverdi Khan defeated a Kurdish force outside its citadel, a sortie of Ottoman troops inside, and routed some Ottoman troops who attempted to link up with Sinan Pasha. Sinan Pasha subsequently withdrew to Northern Mesopotamia. Allahverdi Khan returned to Abbas I with the severed heads of defeated Ottomans. These were paraded at the battlefield of Chaldiran in a symbolic visit by Abbas. This was the very site where the first Safavid ruler, Ismail I (1501‚Äì1524), Abbas's great- grandfather, suffered a defeat in 1514 at the hands of the Ottomans. After receiving massive reinforcements, Sinan Pasha moved into Azerbaijan. Abbas's spies reported that Sinan Pasha's army was almost twice as large as his. Upon hearing this, Abbas considered withdrawing to Tabriz, as he did not want to risk losing the territories he had recovered. He considered it too dangerous attacking Sinan Pasha's army directly. Instead, he followed \\"a parallel route from Khoy to Marand, observing the Ottoman advance, but remaining as far as possible unobserved\\". He ordered the Safavid governor of Azerbaijan to adhere to the same scorched earth tactics which had been employed in 1604; all the people and food supplies were removed \\"from the Ottoman line of march\\". Battle On the eve of the battle, Abbas and his army ascended the top of a nearby hill to make a final assessment of the Ottoman army. Though his commanders concurred with the number the spies had reported, Abbas I ordered his commanders to tell their soldiers the Ottoman army was numerically inferior to boost their confidence. Finally, Abbas I consulted his aunt Zeynab Begum, as he frequently did. She soothed his anxieties and encouraged him to fight. On 6 November 1605, the section of the Safavid army led by Qarachaqay Beg reached the \\"top of rising ground\\" at Sufiyan, becoming visible to the Ottoman army. Remembering Abbas I's orders to avoid a major confrontation, Qarachaqay and his men retreated. K√∂se Sefer Pasha and some other commanders, who interpreted this as a sign of weakness, did not hesitate to launch the attack against Sinan Pasha's wishes. Abbas I led the vanguard himself whereas Allahverdi Khan led \\"a squadron detached from the main body of the army\\". As the massive central part of the Ottoman army consisting of cavalry moved towards the Iranian lines, Abbas ordered his light cavalry to \\"sweep around the Ottoman left flank and deliver a feint attack in the rear\\". Sinan Pasha became confused, thinking \\"this was the direction of the main Iranian attack and detached a large body of his advancing horse to meet it\\". This caused disorientation to both sides, \\"believing they were fleeing\\". Making use of the momentum, Abbas I threw the full weight of his Qizilbash cavalry into the battle. After some hard fighting, they scattered the \\"dispirited Ottomans\\" in all directions. Aftermath The Safavids scored a major victory. Numerous major Ottoman governors and generals had been captured or killed as a result of the battle. K√∂se Sefer Pasha, who had started the battle, was captured and executed by the Safavids. One of the Ottoman captives, a man of reportedly immense stature, suddenly drew a dagger and attacked King Abbas I when he was led before him. Abbas I wrestled with the man until he dropped the dagger; he was subsequently killed by Abbas' attendants. But the Sufiyan battle entailed further important consequences. The Ottomans had launched the campaign to recover the territories they had annexed in 1590 but had lost since 1603. The Ottoman defeat at Sufiyan ensured that the Safavids were able to hold the recovered territories, and enabled Abbas I to reconquer all remaining territories by 1607. According to Roger Savory, at Sufiyan, King Abbas I \\"revealed himself to be a general of consummate ability, carefully husbanding his forces, which were inferior to those of the Ottomans in numbers and firepower, and throwing in his reserves at the critical moment.\\" After the battle, in successive campaigns, he expelled \\"the last Ottoman soldier from Iranian territory as defined by the Treaty of Amasya\\".

She previously worked as a journalist and was a columnist for the Edmonton Journal in Edmonton, Alberta. She sits as an independent senator representing Alberta in the Senate of Canada, and is part of the Independent Senators Group caucus.  Early life and career  Simons was born and raised in Edmonton, Alberta, one of two children born to Norman Wolfe and Oli (n√©e Dyck) Simons. Her father, a lawyer, was of Jewish descent; her paternal grandparents had immigrated from Russia and settled in Round Hill, Alberta where he was raised. She earned a B.A. Honours degree in English Literature and minor in French and Comparative Literature from the University of Alberta in 1986, and a master's degree in Journalism from Stanford University, before spending time as a fellow at the Poynter Institute for Media Studies. She returned to Canada in the winter of 1988 and secured a position as a part-time weekend copy editor at the Alberta Report, then as a producer for CBC Radio in Toronto and Edmonton from 1989 to 1995. Edmonton Journal Joining in 1995, Simons is best known for her work as a journalist with the Edmonton Journal newspaper, where her work as a political columnist and investigative journalist earned her a faithful following. She became a columnist on city affairs in 2001. Over the course of her 23 years with the Journal, Simons earned two National Newspaper Awards for her investigations and analysis of Alberta's troubled child welfare system. Her investigative work on Indigenous child welfare and government cover-ups of the deaths of children in foster care also earned her recognition from the UNESCO Canadian Committee for World Press Freedom, and from Journalists for Human Rights. Simons was part of two Edmonton Journal ‚Äúbreaking news‚Äù teams that won National Newspaper Awards for their coverage of the Fort McMurray wildfire and for their stories on the murder of four RCMP officers at Rochfort Bridge, Alberta. She earned a six further National Newspaper Award citations of merit for her columns and editorials on Alberta politics. She has also received recognition from the Alberta Centre for Civil Liberties Research for her work championing LGBQT rights, from the Canadian Bar Association, for her writing on legal affairs, from the Canadian Mental Health Association, for her columns on mental health care, and from the Edmonton Historical Board, for her work as a popular historian and champion of heritage preservation.  2015 Alberta general election  Simons disclosed in the final days of the run-up to the 2015 Alberta Provincial Election that the editorial board of the Edmonton Journal had been under pressure from the paper's parent company Post Media, and namely its CEO Paul Godfrey, to endorse the incumbent Progressive Conservative Party of Alberta and its leader Jim Prentice. While their Alberta coverage was deemed to have \\"reported quite fairly during the election\\", Post Media was strongly criticized by Simons and many of her fellow journalists (and some of the public) for presenting the Journal as a neutral, local source without partisan bias when in fact they were facing pressure to advocate for one specific candidate. Traditionally, newspapers are expected to disclose their bias through an endorsement, as The Journal did in the 2019 Alberta election when they endorsed the UCP candidate Jason Kenney.  Senate of Canada  Paula Simons was appointed to the Senate of Canada (upper chamber) on October 3, 2018 by her Excellency the Rt. Hon. Julie Payette, Gov-Gen. of Canada on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen of Canada, Elizabeth II, on the recommendation of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. In a column Simons wrote about the Senate published August 13, 2013, she discussed how and why Senators get appointed, their entitlement, and some of her current colleagues \\"allegedly bending the rules\\" in the Senate. \\"These days, the Senate is failing on almost every front. Instead of being appointed on merit, all too often senators get the gig because they're political cronies or party loyalists, bagmen (and women) who have primarily distinguished themselves as rabid partisans or backroom boys, not deep thinkers.\\" Referring to her reinstated colleagues she said, \\"Small wonder many Canadians are wondering why we bother at all with an unelected upper house, full of entitled toffs who can't be turfed even if they break the law, even if they're not medically competent to hold office,\\" she wrote. \\"Yes, there are earnest, hardworking, intelligent, thoughtful senators serving on committees, scrutinizing legislation, meeting with school kids, speaking to service clubs. But they've been so overshadowed in the public mind by the antics of the reprobates that it's hard for any senator to maintain public credibility.\\"https://www.pressreader.com/canada/edmonton-journal/20130813 References Category:1964 births Category:Living people Category:Canadian women journalists Category:Canadian senators from Alberta Category:Independent Canadian senators Category:Journalists from Alberta Category:Politicians from Edmonton Category:Women members of the Senate of Canada Category:Women in Alberta politics Category:Canadian newspaper journalists Category:Canadian investigative journalists Category:Canadian columnists ","title":"Paula Simons"},{"id":"58645929","text":"Human reproductive ecology is a subfield in evolutionary biology that is concerned with human reproductive processes and responses to ecological variables. It is based in the natural and social sciences, and is based on theory and models deriving from human and animal biology, evolutionary theory, and ecology. It is associated with fields such as evolutionary anthropology and seeks to explain human reproductive variation and adaptations. The theoretical orientation of reproductive ecology applies the theory of natural selection to reproductive behaviors, and has also been referred to as the evolutionary ecology of human reproduction.  Theoretical foundations  Multiple theoretical foundations from evolutionary biology and evolutionary anthropology are important to human reproductive ecology. Notably, reproductive ecology relies heavily on Life History Theory, energetics, fitness theories, kin selection, and theories based on the study of animal evolution. = Life history theory = Life history theory is a prominent analytical framework used in evolutionary anthropology, biology, and reproductive ecology that seeks to explain growth and development of an organism through various life history stages of the entire lifespan. The life history stages include early growth and development, puberty, sexual development, reproductive career, and post-reproductive stage. Life history theory is based in evolutionary theory and suggests that natural selection operates on the allocation of different types of resources (material and metabolic) to meet the competing demands of growth, maintenance, and reproduction at the various life stages. Life history theory is applied to reproductive ecology in the theoretical understandings of puberty, sexual growth and maturation, fertility, parenting, and senescence because at every life stage organisms are bound to encounter and cope with unconscious and conscious decisions that hold trade-offs. Reproductive ecologists have specifically impacted life history by improving on the energetic models because they are complicated in humans, and involve many causal factors. They draw on classical life history theory, behavioral ecology, and reproductive ecology to make predictions about reproductive behavior and growth = Energetics = Analytical frameworks that explore problems relevant to reproductive ecology, such as age at menarche, or lactational amenorrhea, often employ understandings of energetics to their hypotheses and models. Energetics in this context refers to energy allocation, under the assumption that natural selection favors optimal allocation and use of energy, but also that trade-offs often pose energetic constraints. Allocations of energy are evolved so they in turn, can be foreseeable but they are also variable depending on ecological constraints.  Essential nutrient cost variability  The assumption that energy measured in calories can be used as a universal measure of nutritional cost is criticized by a number of scientists on the basis of essential nutrients, nutrients that the body cannot produce regardless of calorie availability and the specific nutrients must be present in the diet. It is argued that since there are different dietary conditions in which different essential nutrients are the most scarce in different regions and the few foods that contain the scarcest nutrients that are needed to avoid deficit diseases are therefore the most expensive (the cost may be paid in the form of other goods and services in societies without money), and different functions in the body primarily consume different essential nutrients, no universal ranking of the costs of different aspects of reproduction can be made. For example, it is possible for the few micronutrients that men consume more of the more sperm they produce but the consumption of which does not increase in women during pregnancy or lactation to be the scarcest nutrients contained in the most expensive food in some societies, making sperm production effectively more expensive than pregnancy and lactation under local food prices in such societies. It is also argued that the variability of what food is the most valuable due to containing the rarest essential nutrients extend their effects to the economical significance ratio between hunting and gathering in the case of hunter-gatherer societies, and therefore that any attempt to circumvent the evolutionary psychology paradox of men not being able to be in two places at the same time to hunt and protect his family by reference to hiring guards by bartering meat would fail to make sex roles universal due to the difference between regions where the rarest essential nutrients were contained in one or more types of meat and regions where the rarest such nutrients were contained in some types of plants. It is cited in this context that humans evolved over relatively large parts of Africa with different food ecologies, making it impossible for humans to have specialized evolutionarily for one specific food cost ratio. This variability of food value ratios within Africa may have prepared humans evolutionarily to be able to leave Africa.C. G. Nicholas Mascie-Taylor, Lyliane Rosetta (2011) \\"Reproduction and Adaptation: Topics in Human Reproductive Ecology\\"EA Smith (2017) \\"Evolutionary ecology and human behavior\\" = Biodemography and human reproduction = The researchers involved in human reproductive ecology use the combined approach of demography and evolutionary biology to explain the reproductive phenomenon. Biodemography is the study of demography related to biology and evolutionary biology. Biodemographers do research on demographic outcomes such as conception, spontaneous abortion, births, marriage, divorce, menarche, menopause, aging, and mortality. Biodemographers use mathematical models, statistical estimates and biomarkers to analyze the demographic data. The field of biodemography often explores the scientific questions associated with fertility and mortality across cultures, the determinants of reproductive senescence, mortality and sex differences, low fertility in humans, and longer post-reproductive lifespan in women.  Key topics in reproductive ecology  = Gestation = In human reproductive ecology, the study of pregnancy is primarily focused variation in pregnancy and on rates of pregnancy loss.  Variation in pregnancy  Pregnancy varies person-to-person and across cultural and socioeconomic lines. Human gestation is between 30 and 40 weeks long. The dynamic between the mother and the fetus is one of conflict: it is in the best interest of the fetus to gestate as long as possible to continue receiving the nutritional and developmental benefits of being physically attached to the mother. For the mother, however, pregnancy is a highly demanding and risky time. Earlier births avoid complications in the birth of a too-large infant. The length of the pregnancy is a compromise between these two demands, and is influenced by factors such as socioeconomic status, health, and fetal development. Women of lower socioeconomic status have been shown to deliver their babies earlier on average than women of higher socioeconomic status. Research has also shown that stress, especially during early pregnancy, can cause shorter gestation length and increase premature births.  Pregnancy loss  The rate of embryo loss changes throughout pregnancy. Pre-implantation in the uterine wall, rate of loss is undetectable as the hCG hormone is not secreted until implantation. There is no current way to detect pregnancy or pregnancy loss at this stage. Post-implantation, rate of loss is highest in the first trimester of a pregnancy. The chance of pregnancy loss lowers the further into gestation a woman is. Pregnancies may be unsuccessful for multiple reasons. The maternal immune system, though suppressed during ovulation, views the fertilized egg as a foreign body and will attack it. Defective embryos may also be spontaneously aborted, or miscarried, whether due to chromosomal abnormality or developmental defects. Endometrial or placental development issues may also cause a pregnancy to fail. Additionally, the frequency of spontaneous abortion increases with the mother's age. Older mothers have a higher rate of genetic abnormalities that can trigger pregnancy loss. Because human pregnancy is so costly, and human offspring so dependent on their mothers, early spontaneous abortion is high to ensure that energy of a pregnancy is spent on developing a fetus with a high chance of survival. = Fecundity and fertility = Human reproductive ecology considers fecundity and fertility from a demographic perspective. In this view, fecundity is the reproductive potential of an individual and fertility is the actual reproductive output of an individual.  Fecundity  Fecundity is determined by the biological limitations of the individual and can be reduced when biological and ecological factors impact an individual's reproductive capabilities. The key components of fecundity are a person's reproductive maturation and the maintenance of their reproductive system. In humans, the timing of female reproductive maturation is particularly variable and is heavily influenced by ecological considerations. In addition, the age at menarche has decreased over time in many global populations. This phenomenon is referred to as the secular trend. Age at menarche is one measure of the fecundity of an individual female. Male reproductive maturity is less subject to environmental and ecological factors, and does not follow the secular trend that female puberty does. In adults, fecundity is determined by the biological processes of reproduction. Female fecundity is heavily influenced by reproduction and energetics. The ovarian cycle limits the potential of conception to a brief period of fertility roughly once a month. Successful egg maturation, fertilization, and implantation must be able to occur for a reproductively mature female to be fecund. Changes in energy levels, diet, and hormones can all interfere in this process. During breastfeeding, a period of lactational infertility also reduces female fecundity. The metabolic load hypothesis in human reproductive ecology describes how the energetic expenditure of lactation acts to inhibit ovarian cycling. With the majority of available energy going towards milk production, energy is not expended on reproductive effort. Male fecundity is primarily determined by the quality of sperm and the availability of fertile female mates. Individual variation in sperm load, pH, lifespan, and morphology creates varying fecundity in males. As males do not gestate, their contribution to fecundity is less well established post-reproduction. A lack of fecundity in adults can be described as infertility. Infertility occurs in about 10-15% of couples, with the causes of infertility shared equally between males and females.  Fertility  Fertility is the measure of an individual's actual reproductive output, rather than just their potential for reproductive success. Fertility rates vary both inter- and intra-culturally. Fertility for both males and females is dependent not just on biology but on cultural, religious, economic, and other sociological factors as well. Natural fertility is emphasized in the study of human reproductive ecology. Natural fertility is the measure of human fertility in populations without birth control. Research on natural fertility populations seeks to understand the evolutionary context, ecological constraints, and predict outcomes for human fertility. Fertility is influenced by fecundity, but has additional factors that can increase or decrease an individual's lifetime reproductive success. The inter-birth interval, the amount of time between a woman's births, impacts a woman's total fertility. This amount of time varies cross-culturally, as well as varies with different environmental constraints. Many cultures practice conscious birth spacing to adhere to the desired length of time between pregnancies, or desired number of children. Environmental concerns like fetal loss, lack of resource access, and disease may all impact fertility for females or males. Fertility rates across the globe have steadily declined. This trend, known as the demographic transition, began in the 1700s and continues today. It is strongly correlated with increased industrialization in a society. This trend is now seen in almost all cultures, resulting in some societies with below replacement fertility. Below replacement fertility is when the rate of childbirth in a society is less than the amount needed for each woman to have at least one daughter. Since the chance of having a daughter is 50/50, there must be at least two children for every adult woman in the population. =Natural fertility populations= In 1961, French demographer Louis Henry introduced the term ‚Äúnatural fertility‚Äù. Natural fertility is defined as uncontrolled fertility when the couples do not control the number of children and the family size. Controlled fertility populations use controlled methods to stop having children after reaching a certain number of children. In natural fertility populations, the parity related controls of fertility are not influenced by modern birth controls. Therefore, studying and understanding the age-related changes in fecundity is easier in natural fertility populations in compare to controlled fertility populations. Natural fertility populations deliver an easier platform to study the reproductive behavior which may affect the levels of fertility such as pregnancy loss, time for conception, and length of breastfeeding. In Pennsylvania and Ohio states in the United States, the Amish settlements have been studied to understand the age of marriage, the age of first birth, birth intervals, the age at last birth, and total fertility rate as they are natural fertility population due to their religious belief. The Dogon population in Mali, West Africa are a natural fertility population with high fertility rate and they have been studied to understand the role of the age of wife, the age of husband, nutritional status, breastfeeding status, sex of last child, economic status, and polygyny on the waiting time to conception. Natural fertility population in rural Bangladesh have been studied to predict the role of parity, pregnancy loss, mother's age, economic status, child's sex, and husband's migration on the distribution of postpartum amenorrhea. =Quality-quantity trade-offs in fertility= The number of children in any family is associated with the quality of those children. There is a trade-off between reproduction and survival of the children which influence total fertility rate in humans globally> In sub-Saharan African countries, child survival is negatively associated with the number of children in the family due to the child competition for parental investment. The decrease in birth interval rate can also endanger the life of the child. In the Hungarian population, a shorter birth interval is associated with less investment of the mothers which results in small body size and low birth weight of the children at birth. In historical Ireland (1700-1919) the number of children in the family was negatively associated with the lifespan and reproductive success of the children. In various natural fertility populations, the shorter birth interval length may cause higher deaths of the infants. The hunter-gatherer !Kung mothers require to carry a greater amount of food and baby on foraging trips and shorter birth interval length results higher infant mortality among them. The 4-year birth interval is the optimum for the !kung women to have a maximized reproductive success. The total fertility of the women is also related to the post-reproductive survival of the women and in pre-industrial (1766-1895) Swedish population, the number of children was found be to be negatively associated with the longevity of the mothers. = Physiology and maturation = Puberty is the transitory stage in human development in which a person goes from a child into a reproductively mature adult, in other words, puberty is the process of sexual maturation in humans. The onset of puberty varies between boys and girls, with boys usually starting around 11‚Äì12 years of age and ending by 16-17,Marshall (1986), pp. 176‚Äì177 and girls starting around 10-11 and ending at 15-17. Activity in the hypothalamic‚Äìpituitary‚Äìgonadal axis (HPG axis) initiates puberty by secreting gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) from the hypothalamus into the anterior pituitary. The anterior pituitary releases the gonadotropins luteunizing hormone (LH) into the ovaries, which produce estrogen, and follicle- stimulating hormone (FSH) into the testes, which produce testosterone. The central event in puberty for females is menarche, the first menstrual bleeding. For males, it is the first ejaculation.follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) The onset of menarche is easier to determine due to the evidence of menstrual bleeding, while the first ejaculation for males is usually self reported. In evolutionary context, it is assumed that human physiology has been modeled through natural selection to maximize reproductive success by allotting energy and resources through trade-offs. This period of reproductive maturation sees the onset of primary sexual characteristics, the production of gametes and hormones by the gonads, and secondary sexual characteristics. Secondary sexual characteristics include adolescent growth spurt, pubic and axillary hair, genital enlargement, breast development in girls, beard growth in boys, increase in subcutaneous fat, increase in muscle mass, and widening of the pelvis in girls. While there is variation among individuals, secondary sexual characteristics tend to develop in a sequence. For girls, breast development is followed by the appearance of pubic hair, followed by menarche, and fat deposition and broadening of the hips occurring as the completion of breast development approaches. For boys, enlargement of the penis and testicles occurs, followed by pubic and axillary hair growth, voice change, facial hair growth, and muscle mass increase. This period is also a time of cognitive and psychosocial development where social relationships, skills, and experiences outside of the core family are explored.  Pubertal variation  While puberty is a consistent progression of events culminating in reproductive maturity, there is wide variation in age of onset of puberty and the magnitude of the changes that can be caused by a variety of different influences. Since the mid 19th century the global age of menarche has significantly decreased.Finley, Harry. \\"Average age at menarche in various cultures\\". Museum of Menstruation and Women s Health. Retrieved 2007-08-02\\"Girls maturing slightly earlier\\". BBC News. 2001-05-03. Retrieved 2007-08-02. Dietary composition, disease, psyschosocial circumstances, developmental conditions, genetics and epigenetics, and other environmental factors can all affect the age of the onset of puberty. These factors can come together and in terms of evolutionary trade offs, alter the allocation of energy into growth, maintenance, or reproduction, as best needed for survival. Most research focuses on female puberty because it is easier to determine due to menarche. While there is variation in the onset time and magnitude, the sequence of events stays more or less consistent, variations in the sequence can indication a pathological condition.  Dietary influence  Differences in quality and quantity of nutrition account for one of the strongest environmental factors that alter the onset of puberty. Evidence has linked childhood obesity in girls with early pubertal timing, referencing an increased amount of body fat as a signal for the brain to initiate puberty and due to an excess of available energetic resources, since developing a fetus is very energetically demanding.McKenna, Phil (2007-03-05). \\"Childhood obesity brings early puberty for girls\\". New Scientist. Archived from the original on 2008-04-19. Retrieved 2010-05-22.  Illness  Disease and chronic illness in childhood can lead to a delay in pubertal timing in boys and girls. Inflammatory diseases, parasitic infections, and other illnesses that affect nutritional intake, specially chronic ones, are energetically costly and energy and resources has to be allocated into maintenance and health, sometimes taking energy from growth or reproduction, stunting or delaying them.  Genetics and environmental causes  Variation in pubertal timing has been directly found to be due through direct genetic association between mothers and daughters in 46% of the population studied. It is believed that an androgen receptor gene, but the specific gene has not been found. Chemicals and hormones found in the environmentColborn, T., Dumanoski, D. and Myers, J.P. Our Stolen Future, 1996, Plume: New York. and plastics such as Bisphenol A (BPA)\\"Are Bisphenol A (BPA) Plastic Products Safe for Infants and Children?\\". have been thought to affect sexual development in humans at the prenatal or postnatal stage. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), BPA found in plastic bottles and containers leaches into foods and liquids when warmed up, as in the case of plastic baby bottles, and traces of the chemical were found in more than 90% of the U.S. population studied. BPA is of concern because it interferes with the actions of estrogen which is needed as a developmental and reproductive regulator.  Stress and psychosocial factors  Most of the studies have reported that menarche may occur a few months earlier in girls in high-stress households, whose fathers are absent during their early childhood, who have a stepfather in the home, who are subjected to prolonged sexual abuse in childhood, or who are adopted from a developing country at a young age. Conversely, menarche may be slightly later when a girl grows up in a large family with a biological father present. However, when the stress is severely high and potentially life-threatening such as in times of war, the onset of puberty has been delayed. = Mate choice = Mate choice in human reproductive ecology is the process by which individuals rationally partner with others. Mate choice practices, like many of the topics in human reproductive ecology, vary greatly between individuals and between cultures. Culture heavily influences mate choice, but there are evolutionary concepts that underpin research into mate choice. Honest signals are characteristics of an individual that are assumed to be true indicators of health and fecundity. Honest signals guide sexual selection, the process by which certain traits are picked by the potential mate and then proliferate throughout a species. Human cultures vary on what is considered to be a desirable honest signal. Emphasis on wealth, aesthetics, religious affiliation, and lineage, to name a few examples, are all used in different cultures as ways to choose a mate. Monogamy is the mating strategy of two individuals partnering exclusively with each other for a period or time or for life. Monogamy in humans is generally accompanied by selective mate-choice and mating, cohabitation, and bi-parental care for children. Humans may practice lifelong monogamy, as well as serial monogamy. Serial monogamy is the mating strategy of having sequential, non-overlapping partners. Polygamy is the practice of having multiple partners at the same time. The composition of the relationship will determine which type of polygamy is being practiced. Polygyny is the practice of a male partnering with multiple females. It is a fairly common mating strategy in humans, as well as in many other animals. Polygyny often occurs in agricultural societies and is often paired with male wealth or land access. When males are able to disproportionately control resources, they may be able to support more than one female partner. Polyandry is the practice of a female partnering with multiple males. It is not as common in humans as polygyny, due in part to the constraints of female reproduction. While a female may only reproduce once at a time, a male may be able to contribute to multiple concurrent pregnancies. Polyandry is often seen in cases when there are more males in a society than females, or when males are considered to be unavailable. = Parenting =  Parental investment and parental-offspring conflict  In reproductive ecology, concepts related to parenting, social organization, and development are discussed. The concept of parental investment defined by Trivers and Willard in the 1970s is used widely in reproductive ecology to analyze and understand provisioning strategies and how they relate to life history trade-offs. Trivers' parental investment is defined as investment in offspring to that benefits their survival and ability to reproduce, at the expense of the parent's ability to invest in other offspring. Inherent in these strategies is an underlying trade-off between energy and investment allocation to oneself as a parent and to each offspring. Paternal investment is more variable than maternal investment worldwide, and compared to other primates paternal investment is more robust in humans. Mating and pair-bonding includes trade-offs such as making a choice between investing in current offspring, or investing in future mating opportunities. Over the course of human evolution, there is evidence of reduced sexual dimorphism in humans compared to other primates. This suggests that there was less male-male competition for female mates, which led to more male investment in offspring, rather than mate choices. Paternal investment strategies vary facultatively based on alloparental care, the costs and benefits of offspring investment, societal pressures, divisions of labor, cultural expectations and norms, and the individual qualities of males in any given society. In the field of reproductive ecology, it has been a recent interest to explore the endocrinology of social relationships, including the relation of paternal investment and endocrine function. It has been shown that fatherhood in general, reduces testosterone levels and competition for mates increases testosterone. It is also shown that male endocrine function is mediated by interactions with children. Maternal investment is widespread and less variable than paternal investment, but there have been recent evidence supporting multiple mating systems for females as well in the evolutionary literature. This could suggest that mating systems may influence how maternal investment is given, and the trade-offs posed both biologically and socially. Maternal investment is almost always necessary for the survival of offspring, because compared to other primates, human infants are highly altricial. Offspring are also categorized as taking longer to wean, still dependent after weaning, and a longer juvenile period. Parent offspring conflict is a theory synthesized by Trivers in the 1970s alongside parental investment. Parental offspring conflict is also well documented and develops in tandem with the process of reproduction and parenting. Parent-offspring conflict occurs in the relationship between parent and fetus (in the case of striking a balance between allocating placental energy stores to the growing fetus, while maintaining and metabolic balance of the mothers biology), and between parent and offspring. Parent offspring is expected to be highest during the parental investment period. Parent-offspring conflict assumes there will be \\"disagreements\\" between parents and offspring about how long parental investment lasts, how resources are allocated, and maintaining the life history trade-offs in the process.  Allomaternal care  Parental investment provided by individuals other than mothers and fathers is considered allocare. Both paternal care and allocare can reduce the energetic costs of parenting for mothers. Allocare is often referred as allomaternal care or allomothering if it is provided by anyone other than the mother. Based on Kin Selection Theory, it is usually assumed that mothers have been ancestrally necessary to ensure offsprings survival and reproduction. It is less known to what extent paternal investment or care or other types of allocare are a necessity to offspring survival and reproduction. Typically maternal care is defined at the most basic level of pregnancy and birth and lactation, but includes other things like provisioning, learning (in humans), mirroring (mirroring behavior of mother), and holding, carrying, and touching. It has been shown in various studies that allocare can take many forms such as provisioning, providing food, reducing parental costs for parents, time investments, economic investments, and other types of care such as holding. There have been different results from studies in traditional societies and natural fertility populations, than in industrialized societies. Allomaternal care has been hypothesized to have influenced ancestral evolution by being associated with increased brain size. Allomaternal care is also a part of a larger hypothesis of humans as cooperative breeders whereby allocare discounts the individual costs of parenting, especially when sets of parents have children around the same time as each other, or have other kin or community members to provide care (see grandmother hypothesis). Cooperative breeding is a social system that given some advantage over time, and cooperative breeding is much more common in humans and relatively rare in other mammalian species. Traits in our species that favor cooperative breeding evolve over time due to altruism, and within the context of kin selection and reciprocity.  Lactation  Lactation is one of the costliest forms of parental investment because it is taxing at a metabolic and physiological level, but also in terms of time and emotion as well. There are many trade-offs regarding lactation, and recent work has explored cost benefit models and thresholds for breastfeeding. From a biological and evolutionary perspective, breastfeeding infants is biologically superior and contains various bioconstituents that provide nutrition, hydration, immune factors, hormones, and other necessary components to aid infant survival and growth. Lactational strategies vary cross-culturally, but can typically be defined by sibling sets and sex ratios, frequency of nursing, entire lactational duration, and milk composition. Milk is composed of my bioconstituents, but only a few will be outlined here. In the first days of puerperium, the first milk is thick and yellowish, also called colostrum. For weeks after that, mature milk is expressed and it has been shown that fetal-mammary gland signaling occurs even before birth in determining milk type and concentrations based on the fetus sex. Colostrum plays an important role in establishing the infant gut microbiome, as it contains important immunoglobins, and is high in protein and low in fat and milk sugar such as lactose. While breastmilk is extremely important for infants' health outcomes, it is also known that human mature milk is fairly dilute, which has an effect on infant suckling behavior, which in many cases holds implications for the contraceptive properties of lactation.  Lactational amenorrhea  Post-partum infecundability, also referred to as lactational infecundability or lactational amenorrhea, refers to the section of the human birth interval from parturition to the first post-partum ovulation. This period varies widely across globe and between societies. The length of post-partum infecundability is heavily influenced by breastfeeding because it holds some contraceptive physiological effects. The role of lactational amenorrhea has been shown to be important for infant survival as a mechanism to delay the next pregnancy, and thus infants have a longer period to optimize nutritional and immunological benefits of breast milk. Post-partum hormonal levels change so that both estrogen and progesterone are \\"cleared from the maternal circulation\\" and without breastfeeding, levels of plasma FSH and LH gradually increase and lead to the return of regular menses within 2 months. With breastfeeding, the resumption of normal menses occurs many months later, and the overall effect of lactational amenorrhea is influenced by the intensity of infant suckling. = Ovarian aging = Ovarian aging is characterized by the gradual decline of the ovarian follicles number and decreasing quality of oocytes. Menopause is considered as the final stage of ovarian aging. Menopause is clinically defined as the absence of menstruation beyond a year. It indicates the cessation of reproductive phase of life in women. The biology of menopause is associated with the depletion of the ovarian follicular pool. At the fourth month of the fetal life, the ovarian follicles reach to the number 6-7 million. At birth, the number of ovarian follicles in the ovary decline to 1-2 million. The follicle number decrease to 300,000-400,000 at the age of menarche. In the entire reproductive age, these follicles undergo atresia and at the time of menopause, the ovaries are left with approximately 1000 follicles. Below this threshold regular ovarian cycles cannot be maintained. The quality of ovarian follicles declines with age due to the increase meiotic non-disjunction. After age 31 years, fecundity decreases and the probability of aneuploidy rate increases in the early embryo. The regular menstrual cycle is associated with the hormonal regulation from hypothalamic, pituitary, and ovarian axis. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretes from the hypothalamus. Hypothalamic GnRH pulse influences the pulsatile secretion of Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and Luteinizing hormone (LH) from the pituitary gland. During the menstrual cycle, due to a decreased level of inhibin-A and steroid hormones, the level of FSH increases. Due to these hormonal changes, the corpus luteum gets destroyed. The elevated level of FSH helps to recruit a cohort of the FSH-sensitive antral follicles in that cycle. During this phase, elevated FSH level stimulates the production of estradiol, Inhibin A and B. Following that, due to the negative feedback mechanism the level of estradiol and Inhibin-B increases and FSH level declines and it helps to select the dominant follicle. During the menopausal transition, FSH level elevates at the early follicular phase and due to the increased FSH level, the number of FSH-sensitive follicles decreases. These series of events lead to irregular menstrual cycle and the cycle length starts to become shorter. FSH, Inhibin-B, and Anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) are used as the biomarkers for the ovarian aging. Various genetic and endocrine factors influence the aging of the ovaries and the age at menopause. In some women, the ovaries age faster and the follicle pool diminishes before the age of 40 years. This phenomenon is known as the premature ovarian failure (POF) and it is used as the model for the study of the genetics of ovarian aging. The genes such as GDF9 and BMP15 have been identified as the candidate genes for POF. POF has a relation with the genome-wide linkages on chromosomal regions 9q21.3 and Xp21.3. Several genes related to mitochondrial function such as mt-Atp6, Sod1, Hspa4, and Nfkbia are also associated with the aging of the ovary. In addition to that, the deletion at mtDNA 4977-bp in the granulosa cells is associated with fertility in older aged women.

The 383 teachers that work for the school district are members of a union called the Strongsville Education Association (SEA). In 2013, SEA and the Strongsville School Board were having contract negotiations for the teachers upcoming contract, after the previous one had expired in June 2012. When negotiations were not agreed upon by the time the teachers' union had set, they went on strike in March 2013. The teacher strike lasted for eight weeks. During this time frame, SEA and its president, Tracy Linscott, held picket lines outside of all the schools within the SCS district. Contracts were agreed upon on April 27, 2013, which ended the eight week strike. Teachers were back into the schools by April 30, 2013.  Negotiations  In the December 2012 five-year-forecast of the SCS district, significant fiscal challenges were outlined. This prompted the Strongsville School Board to seek new concessions in the upcoming contract renewal for the teachers. The School Board wanted: * Requiring teachers to pay a portion, 15 percent, of their own dental care premiums * Increasing the teachers monthly health premium * Conversion of the 9.3% pension pick-up to a 9.3% salary increase * Using teacher evaluations for lay-offs and only relying on seniority as a tie- breaker The Strongsville Education Association did not agree with the percentages and new increases in their healthcare. SEA claimed terms were unfair over the course of negotiations before the strike. The teachers argued that their salary scale had not been increased since the 2007-2008 school year and that their health coverage had already increased since then. Over the course of the eight week strike, Tracy Linscott, SEA President, negotiated with the School Board and the Board President, David Frazee. The final contract was agreed upon by SEA on Saturday, April 27 and the School Board voted unanimously on it on Sunday, April 28. In the end the teachers received the pay increases they wanted but took cuts in health insurance coverage. They also faced backlash from the students and the community that did not support the strike.  During the Strike  On March 4, 2013, students of the SCS district showed up to school and saw their teachers outside with signs and whistles blocking the school driveways. Some of the signs read, \\"No Contract, No Work!\\" and, \\"Lies & tricks will not divide, workers standing side by side\\". The teachers that were in SEA wore heavy coats and gloves on the picket line. They had tables with hot chocolate and donuts surrounding them, as they had planned to stay outside for the duration of the school day. Several students gathered on the picket line with the teachers to show their support. They had signs that read, \\"Need a Bandaid for that Scab?\\", in reference to the nickname the teachers had given the 140 substitutes that had taken their place. When the students that didn't gather on the picket line went into the schools, they were assigned to classrooms by their last names. The classrooms at Strongsville High School were overcrowded because the administration had anticipated lower attendance rates than usual. One picketing teacher at Center Middle School was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct for blocking vehicles from entering the school grounds. On Friday, March 8, just days after the strike began, concerned residents held a rally in the center of town to demonstrate their displeasure with the teachers and SEA. The group that organized the rally called themselves \\"Taxpayers at the Table\\" and felt that they should take part in contract negotiations. They were highly displeased with the teachers' tactics and felt they were not demonstrating a good example to their students.

The term describes violent air flow oscillating in the axial direction of a compressor, which indicates the axial component of fluid velocity varies periodically and may even become negative. In early literature, the phenomenon of compressor surge was identified by audible thumping and honking at frequencies as low as 1 Hertz, pressure pulsations throughout the machine, and severe mechanical vibration. Description Compressor surge can be classified into deep surge and mild surge. Compressor surge with negative mass flow rates is considered as deep surge while the one without reverse flows is generally termed mild surge. On a performance map, the stable operating range of a compressor is limited by the surge line. Although the line is named after a surge, technically, it is an instability boundary which denotes onsets of discernible flow instabilities, such as compressor surge or rotating stall. When the mass flow rate drops to a critical value at which discernible flow instabilities take place, nominally, the critical value should be determined as a surge mass flow rate on a constant speed line; however, in practice, the surge line on a performance map is affected by specific criteria adopted for determining discernible flow instabilities...A typical compressor performance map  Effects  Compressor surge is a disaster to the compressor and the whole machine. When compressor surge happens, the operating point of a compressor, which is usually denoted by the pair of the mass flow rate and pressure ratio, orbits along a surge cycle on the compressor performance map. The unstable performance caused by compressor surge is not acceptable to machines on which a compressor is mounted to ventilate or dense air. Except for affecting performance, compressor surge is also accompanied with loud noises. Frequencies of compressor surge can range from a few to dozens Hertz depending on the configuration of a compression system. Although Helmholtz resonance frequency is often employed to characterize the unsteadiness of mild surge; it was found that Helmholtz oscillation did not trigger compressor surge in some cases. Another effect of compressor surge is on solid structure. Violent flows of compressor surge repeatedly hit blades in the compressor, resulting in blade fatigue or even mechanical failure. While fully developed compressor surge is axisymmetric, its initial phase is not necessarily axisymmetric. Actually, severe damage of compressor surge is often related to very large transverse loads on blades and casing in its initial transient. A chain reaction of compressor surge is the flameout of a jet engine. Due to a lack of air intake in the case of compressor surge, there will be unburnt fuel in the combustion chamber, and that unburnt fuel will burn and cause flameout near the exit of the engine where oxygen is sufficient.  Causes  In most low-speed and low- pressure cases, rotating stall comes prior to compressor surge; however, a general cause-effect relation between rotating stall and compressor surge has not been determined yet. On a constant speed line of a compressor, the mass flow rate decreases as the pressure delivered by the compressor gets higher. Internal flows of the compressor are in a very large adverse pressure gradient which tends to destabilize the flow and cause flow separation. A fully developed compressor surge can be modeled as a one-dimensional global instability of a compression system which typically consists of inlet ducts, compressors, exit ducts, gas reservoir, and throttle valve. A cycle of compressor surge can be divided into several phases. If the throttle valve is turned to be a very small opening, the gas reservoir would have a positive net flux. The pressure in the reservoir keeps increasing and then exceeds the pressure at compressor exit, thus resulting in an adverse pressure gradient in exit ducts. This adverse pressure gradient naturally decelerates flows in the whole system and reduces the mass flow rate. The slope of a constant speed line near surge line is usually zero or even positive, which implies that the compressor cannot provide a much higher pressure as lowering the mass flow rate. Thus, the adverse pressure gradient could not be suppressed by the compressor and the system would rapidly involves an overshoot of adverse pressure gradient which would dramatically reduce the mass flow rate or even cause flows to reverse. On the other hand, the pressure in the reservoir would gradually drops due to less flux delivered by the compressor, thus rebuilding a favorable pressure gradient in exit ducts. And then the mass flow rate would be recovered, and the compressor is back to work on a constant speed line again, which would eventually trigger the next surge cycle. Therefore, compressor surge is a process which keeps breaking the flow path of a compression system down and rebuilding it. Several rules of thumb can be inferred from the interpretation above. Compressor surge in a system with a small gas reservoir is high-frequency and low-amplitude whereas a large gas reservoir leads to low-frequency and high-amplitude compressor surge; another rule of thumb is that compressor surge happens in a compressor with a large external volume and compressor stall tends to show up in a system with a short exit duct. It is also worth noting that the surge line of a compressor can have small variations in different systems, such as a test bench or an engine.

Wahlforss lectured in Polytechnical institute in Helsinki. His scientific achievements were related to his publishings about retene, para- bromobenzyl chloride and the oxidation of castor oil. As Wahlforss's publications were written in Swedish language, they remained internationally without attention. Wahlforss's research career was influenced by his alcoholism. A heart attack ended his career, after which he spent his last years paralysed. Alfred Wahlforss was married twice. The first spouse remains unknown. The second wife was Emilia Elisabeth L√•nghjelm, with whom he had two daughters and two sons. The older son Wilhelm became later a corporate director and Eric became a paper mill manager.  Early years and studies  Alfred Wahlforss was born in 1839 in Kristinestad, Grand Duchy of Finland. His parents were Eric Wahlforss and Susanna Maria n√©e Holmudd. Alfred was the second oldest of nine children. He went to school in Vaasa, where he did his matriculation exam at age of 18. At age of 12, he earned a medal by saving his friend from drowning. Wahlforss went on to study chemistry in Helsinki and completed his Bachelor's degree four years after. Talented Wahlforss received a scholarship and studied the three following years in Z√ºrich, Hanover and G√∂ttingen, where he earned his Master's degree.  Career  Upon his return, Wahlforss was appointed teacher of practical chemistry and laboratorian at Helsinki Technical College. He had started to research retene already his time in G√∂ttingen and presented his study in 1867. Despite having just Master's degree, Wahlforss received a docentship and a scholarship to continue his research. During 1868‚Äì1869 he worked for Friedrich Konrad Beilstein in St. Petersburg, and in 1870 he presented another study \\"Om bromtoluolklorid\\". The latter study was especially significant and it became Wahlforss's doctorate thesis, but as it was published in Swedish language, it remained with small attention. A similar study was published in United States for 12 years later, and another one in Germany at the turn of the century by researchers Wilhelm Wislicenus and Rudolf Gr√ºtzner. It is notable, that Beilstein does not mention Wahlforss's work in his famous book Handbuch der organischen Chemie, although must have been aware of it. Wahlforss applied for professorship in chemistry in the Imperial Alexander University in Helsinki, but withdrew his application. A potential reason for this was his alcoholism. Possibly Wahlforss's grant applications for travelling were repeatedly rejected for this reason ‚Äì apart from a period he worked in Berlin, which did not lead to any publishing. For a long time Wahlforss did not publish anything, until in 1888 he presented the first part of series of studies, which handled castor oil oxidation products, enanthic acid in particular. Due to this, Wahlforss was appointed professor in the Polytechnical Institute. He published studies about the topic until his paralysis in 1896. Wahlforss's achievements were based on his persistent, thorough and detailed work, rather than great innovations. The former students remembered Wahlforss as a good lecturer, whose passion to the subject remained evident. While the lessons were often chaotic and without structure, the learning outcomes were good ‚Äì Wahlforss explained complicated topics in small parts easy to embrace, and he often spiced the lessons with anecdotes.  Personal life  While Wahlforss gained a lot professionally during his time in St. Petersburg in 1868‚Äì1869, but he also increased his alcohol consumption while in the large metropolis. He married a local woman whose identity remains unknown, but returned alone to Finland. During the following years the alimony Wahlforss had to pay for the spouse and two children burdened his personal finances heavily. At latest in 1882 Wahlforss started a relationship with 19-year-old Emilia Elisabeth L√•nghjelm and in the following year they had a daughter, Elisabeth; another daughter, Henriette, followed in 1885. The marriage with the unknown Russian woman was possibly still in force, and this could be the reason why the couple lived for long together before marrying in 1890. After that they had two sons: Wilhelm in 1891 and Eric in 1895. Wahlforss suffered an infarct during cycling trip in midsummer 1896. He was taken home unconscious. Wahlforss spent the rest of his life partly paralysed and unable to walk and speak; he had also lost his memory. He died on 28 March 1899. Wahlforss's sons became later notable business people. Wilhelm became a large company director and Eric managed a paper mill.

Early life Pierson was born on February 25, 1839, in New York City. He was the son of Henry Lewis Pierson (1807‚Äì1893) and Helen Maria (n√©e Pierson) Pierson (1807‚Äì1845), who were cousins. Among his siblings was Helen Maria Pierson, who married William Gaston Hamilton (son of John Church Hamilton and grandson of first U.S. Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton), and was the grandmother of Helen Morgan Hamilton, Pierpont Morgan Hamilton, and Alexander Morgan Hamilton. Fred, as he was known, was seventh in descent from Abraham Pierson, the first president of Yale University beginning in 1701. The first American Pierson, Abraham Pierson the Elder, came to Boston in 1639 from Yorkshire, England and helped found Southampton, New York, Stamford, Connecticut, and Newark, New Jersey. His paternal grandparents were U.S. Representative from New York Jeremiah Halsey Pierson and Sarah (n√©e Colt) Pierson. His maternal grandparents were Isaac Pierson and Helen (n√©e Fort) Pierson. Career In 1857, he enlisted as a private in Company K of the 7th Regiment of the New York National Guard, and was attached to the staff of Brig. Gen. William Hall. At the start of the American Civil War, Pierson helped organize the 1st New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, and was appointed captain in May 1861. He was promoted several times and assumed command of the regiment on October 9, 1862, with the rank of colonel. Attached to the 3rd Corps, Army of the Potomac, he led the 1st New York in actions at the Seven Days Battles, Second Manassas and the Battle of Fredericksburg. After the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863, Colonel Pierson was honorably discharged and mustered out on May 25, 1863. For distinguished service, he was brevetted brigadier general of the United States Volunteers for \\"gallant and meritorious services.\\" =Later career= After the War ended, Pierson took up a business career, including the family business, Pierson & Co. He also served as president of the Ramapo Foundry and Wheel Works, the Ramapo Hunting and Villa Park Association, the Ramapo Manufacturing Company, the New York Association for the Protection of Game, the New York City Marble Cemetery, the A. and N. Realty Company, and the New York Stamping Company. He also served as a trustee of the East River Savings Bank and was vice president of the Northern Dispensary. =Society life= In 1892, Pierson, his wife Susan, and their eldest daughter were all included in Ward McAllister's \\"Four Hundred\\", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times. Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom. Pierson was a member of the Union Club of the City of New York, the New York Yacht Club, the Tuxedo Club, and the Army and Navy Club. The Pierson's home in Newport, Roselawn, was built by her his father-in-law, James Rhodes, in 1854. In 1929, the Piersons entertained at their home in New York by giving musicale featuring Abby Morrison Ricker, a soprano, accompanied by Mrs. Harrison Irvine. Personal life On December 16, 1869, Pierson was married to Susan Augusta Rhodes (1844‚Äì1929) in Providence, Rhode Island. Together, they lived at 20 West 52nd Street and were the parents of: * Marguerite \\"Daisy\\" Pierson (1870‚Äì1964), who married George Huntington Hull Jr. in 1910. * John Fred Pierson Jr. (1872‚Äì1951), who first married Suzanne Miles.

Originally constructed in 1941 by the Empire of Japan for the capital of its puppet state Manchukuo, Dafangshen Airport saw fierce fighting and was severely damaged during the Siege of Changchun in the Chinese Civil War. It served as Changchun's public international airport from October 1960 until August 2005, when all civil flights were transferred to the new Changchun Longjia International Airport.  Location and facilities  Dafangshen Airport is located west of central Changchun. When opened in 1941, it had a runway measuring by , and a taxiway measuring by . After it became Changchun's main public airport in the People's Republic of China era, it was expanded multiple times, with a domestic terminal, an international terminal, and a dedicated railway among the later additions.  History  =Manchukuo and Republic of China= Dafangshen Airport was built by the Empire of Japan in 1941 to serve Changchun (Hsinking), then capital of the Japanese puppet state Manchukuo. It replaced the older and smaller Kuanchengzi Airport (ÂÆΩÂüéÂ≠êÊú∫Âú∫). Near the end of World War II, a Soviet airborne force landed at Dafangshen Airport on 20 August 1945 and captured Changchun from the Japanese army. When the Soviet forces left Changchun on 14 April 1946, the communist Northeast People's Liberation Army took over the city and the airport. Soon afterwards Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang army drove out the communists on 23 May 1946. During the Liaoshen Campaign of the Chinese Civil War, the Northeast People's Liberation Army besieged Changchun. Xiao Jinguang captured Dafangshen and damaged its runway in May 1948 to prevent the Kuomintang from using the airport to supply Zheng Dongguo's defensive forces inside the city. On 16 October, the Kuomintang army launched a fierce attack in an attempt to recapture the airport, but were repelled by Xiao's forces. Most buildings and facilities of the airport were destroyed in the fighting. =People's Republic of China= After the Communists won the civil war and establishment of the People's Republic of China in 1949, Dafangshen Airport was used for pilot training by the Second Aviation Academy of the People's Liberation Army Air Force. It was later expanded for civil aviation and replaced Datun Airport as Changchun's public airport in October 1960. A domestic terminal and a international terminal were constructed. It served mainly domestic destinations as well as Hong Kong and Seoul. As air travel became increasingly common since the reform and opening era, Dafangshen could not longer accommodate the rapid growth of air traffic, and the new Changchun Longjia International Airport was constructed to replace it as Changchun's public airport. Longjia Airport was opened on 27 August 2005, and Dafangshen reverted to sole military use.

Biography  The exact date and place of birth of Skrynnik is unclear (it is known that he lived Kishinev and in 1980 he was 27 years old). He considered himself a loser in his personal life, and envied other men. His marriage was unhappy: after he had a child, Skrynnik realized that he did not love his wife. One day, his friend Feodosiy Glukharyov boasted to him about his success in love. After this, Skrynnik made an advertisement in the newspaper that he was searching for a lover, but the girl he met infected him with venereal disease, which made Skrynnik decide that women are the source of all the ills in the world, and must be destroyed. = Murders = In the mid-1970s, Skrynnik went to work in Yakutia. There he killed stewardess Nina Puganova, cutting off her breasts and genitals. Although her torn body was found, it did not lead to the killer, and the murder remained unsolved until Skrynnik's capture. Later, Skrynnik returned to Kishinev, where he worked as a carpenter in the \\"Bucuria\\" factory, was an udarnik and a candidate member of the CPSU. In 1980, he committed another murder. He invited to a date Irina Trasyn, who had a seven-year-old child, treating her with ice cream before stabbing her multiple times with a knife. Skrynnin then removed her eyes and cut off her head, which he put in a briefcase. The killer then brought this portfolio to Glukharyov, attaching the following note to it: Initially, Glukharyov was suspected of killing her. The investigation had a version that he had been a member of a criminal group but decided to cut off ties with the criminal world, and they had decided to intimidate him. It was impossible to identify the victim, as she was left without eyes. With the permission of the Moldavian SSR, the head of the murdered Trasyn was shown on television. After that, police was called by 7-year-old Viktor Trasyn, the son of the deceased. He recognized his mother, whom he had not seen in a week. As he was left an orphan, the boy was put in an orphanage. Soon after, Skrynnik killed a new victim named Anastasia Mikhailova, bringing to Glukharyov her severed hand. The examination later established that the head and the hand belonged to different people. Different theories began to appear: some claimed that there were necromancer-sorcerers in Kishinev, digging up corpses from the graves, while others claimed that a maniac who had operated in the USSR at the time, Nikolai Dzhumagaliev, had reached the Moldovan capital. A note had been placed yet again in the hand of the victim: After reading the letter, operatives decided to put guards on watch for Oksana, Glukharyov's daughter. Once Skrynnik, who was among the suspects, went into the Glukharyovs' house courtyard, the plain-clothed operatives tried to detain him, but Oksana told them: \\"Let Uncle Sasha go, he is good.\\" The decided to organize a meeting between Glukharyov and the alleged gangsters - the possible murderers. Under the guise of railway workers at the Kishinev station, they set up an ambush. Glukharyov arrived at the station, but one came to him. While investigating the case, Anatoly Magdalyuk, senior investigator for particularly important cases under the Prosecutor's Office of the Moldavian SSR, drew attention to an interesting fact: Glukharyov preferred that people not call him Feodosiy, but Fedor - a name only relatives and good friends called him. From this followed the conclusion that the murder was committed by a person who knows Glukharyov very well. His second cousin, Dmitry Kozintsev, a restaurant owner to whom Glukharyov took his bride on the wedding, came into view. A scandal broke out, with Kozintsev threatening to kill Glukharyov, but the matter was hushed up. Once at the station, an undercover operative called Dmitry Kozintsev by name and surname, upon which he tried to flee, but stumbled and was quickly detained. However, it turned out that Kozintsev was only involved in the embezzlement of socialist property, which he had been long suspected of. Not long after, Skrynnik attack another girl, Olga Lebedeva, in the Central Park of Culture and Rest of Lenin Komsomol. He tried to rape and kill her, but the victim managed to escape and call for help. She said that the offender shouted at her: \\"I will cut you into pieces, creature\\". These words caused the investigators to go investigate the park, where they found the headless body of Trasyn. Lebedeva said that she had seen her attacker's face, and it was a man she had seen previously after the announcement. He had come to see her, but quickly left and then attacked her (so he attacked her again this time). She had kept the letters from him, the author of which turned out to be Skrynnik. However, it wasn't possible to compare the handwritings of the killer and Glukharyov, as the notes the maniac sent were written in block letters. Skrynnik was then summoned to the military registration and enlistment office, where he was required to fill out documents in block letters, and they coincided with the handwritings of the killer. = Arrest, trial = Alexander Skrynnik was detained at the \\"Patria\\" cinema, where he had gone with a girl. He admitted his crimes without any repentance, calling himself an \\"orderly of nature\\". At his trial, he stated that he would describe all the terrible things he had done and asked for those with a weak stomach to leave. The Supreme Court of the Moldavian SSR sentenced Skrynnik to death, and he was subsequently executed by firing squad, but the exact date is unknown.

She found fame nearly a century after her death thanks to being portrayed in a series of YouTube videos by an historical reenactor cooking recipes from the era.

She initially worked for her brother John in Devon, but by 1861 was working as a kitchenmaid for John Townshend, Viscount Sydney, one of a staff of at least 10, including a male cook and several footmen. By 1871, she was working as a cook and housekeeper in the household of Thomas Proctor Beauchamp at Langley Hall, Norfolk, one of 16 servants employed by the family.Avis Crocombe England and Wales Census, 1871. Family Search. Retrieved 4 October 2018. Sometime before 1881, she became cook to the family of the 5th Baron Braybrooke whose country seat was at Audley End House near Saffron Walden. As was usual for cooks, she also worked at the family's home in London at Upper Brook Street, and for them in their seaside home at Branksome Towers in Bournemouth. She replaced a male French chef (a Mons. Merer), but the family were probably cost-cutting, for Avis would have been substantially cheaper. Although staff wages are not known at Audley for 1881, in general male cooks commanded around ¬£100-120 p.a., (the upper end if French), whereas women's salaries ranged from ¬£40-60. Those who, like Avis, had trained under male cooks could expect higher wages than those who had not.

Legacy In 2008, English Heritage, a charity which cares for over 400 monuments and sites across Britain, including Audley End, undertook a multi-million pound restoration of the service wing, funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund. As part of the interpretation, historical reenactment company Past Pleasures provided costumed characters, who animated the service wing portraying the servants as listed in the 1881 census. The project centred around live cookery, with the team in character, talking to the public and sharing with them recipes from the era. It was initially led by food historian Annie Gray, and then by experienced historical interpreter and educator, Kathy Hipperson. Initially, recipes were sourced from books appropriate to the era, but in 2009, Benjamin Stride's descendant Robert Stride bought tickets to see a concert at Audley End. The name sparked a memory, and he realised that he had Avis's hand-written recipe book in a drawer. He donated it to English Heritage, and the costumed team were able to integrate the recipes written by Avis into their work. The book also enabled Gray to work more closely on the sources available to Crocombe, and the style of cookery likely to have been seen at Audley in the 1880s. Crocombe copied several recipes from Eliza Acton's Modern Cookery for Private Families (1845), for example, while others were sourced from newspapers and visitors to the house.Meet the YouTube cook going viral - 140 years after her death.

History  = The Derthick Club = The Euterpean Club was the creation of Wilber M. Derthick, a Chicago music critic, scholar, and author. In the 1880s and 1890s, Wilbur Derthick and his wife, May sent out \\"agents\\" to organize local music clubs. These Derthick Music-Literary Clubs had a curriculum developed by the Derthicks, using a flashcard-based game to teach music history, theory, and biography. By 1895, Derthick claimed to have founded over 200 such clubs. The Fort Worth club was one of many in Texas, which had over 400 active music clubs, the most of any US state. The Derthick Club of Fort Worth had its first meeting in the home of Ida Jane (Mrs. Bacon) Saunders in 1896, with subsequent meetings at various members' homes. = Euterpean Club = The club declared its independence from the Derthick system in 1898, renaming itself the Euterpean Club after Euterpe, the Greek muse of music and lyric poetry. It abandoned the Derthick curriculum, but maintained the same membership roster. Biweekly meetings were held in members' homes, the Academy of Music, St. Paul's Methodist Church, and the Metropolitan Hotel. . In 1900, the Euterpean Club joined Fort Worth's City Federation; the following year it became a delegate to the Texas Federation of Women's Clubs. In 1910, the co-ed Juvenile Euterpean Club was established, the first music club for children in Texas. The Euterpean Club's long-running contest for original musical compositions resulted in a 1912 book called Texas Composers. During World War I, the club's Camp Bowie War Service Committee served lunches at the army camp on Fort Worth's west side, organized weekly concerts at the local YWCA, and performed weekly organ concerts for soldiers at the First Christian Church. In 1922, the club began a series of nationally broadcast performances on local radio station, WBAP, and started the Junior Euterpean Club, a coed group for children ages 8-14. In 1923, the club helped found the Woman's Club of Fort Worth, celebrated a silver anniversary with a performance that drew an audience of over 1200, and formed a chamber music society. Directed by Brooks Morris, the chamber group became the foundation of the Fort Worth Symphony Orchestra. In 1926 the club put on two concerts with multiple pianos playing the same classical pieces in unison. The concerts, with respectively 12 or 20 pianos, were directed by Carl Venth, dean of Texas Woman's College (now known as Texas Wesleyan University). Venth was also the Euterpean Club's choral director in 1930 and 1931. The club organized programs for the state centennial celebration, featuring Texas composers Radie Britain, David Guion, William J. Marsh, Oscar J. Fox, and Carl Venth. In 1939, it held a special memorial program with musicians from Southern Methodist University for the late Anna Shelton, founder and longtime president of the Woman's Club of Fort Worth, and also hosted the statewide convention of the Texas Federation of Music Clubs. During World War II, the club programs featured performers from the Fort Worth Army Airfield, Camp Wolters, and other Texas military installations. Members volunteered as USO workers and WAC recruiters, worked at hospitals, sold war bonds, and donated a piano to the Fort Worth Army Airfield.

Due to the inherent risks of the environment and the necessity to operate the equipment correctly, both under normal conditions and during incidents where failure to respond appropriately and quickly can have fatal consequences, a set of standard procedures are used in preparation of the equipment, preparation to dive, during the dive if all goes according to plan, after the dive, and in the event of a reasonably foreseeable contingency. Standard procedures are not necessarily the only courses of action that produce a satisfactory outcome, but they are generally those procedures that experiment and experience show to work well and reliably in response to given circumstances. All formal diver training is based on the learning of standard skills and procedures, and in many cases the over-learning of the skills until the procedures can be performed without hesitation even when distracting circumstances exist. Where reasonably practicable, checklists may be used to ensure that preparatory procedures are carried out in the correct sequence and that no steps are inadvertently omitted. Some procedures are common to all manned modes of diving, but most are specific to the mode of diving and many are specific to the equipment in use. Diving procedures are those directly relevant to diving safety and efficiency, but do not include task specific skills. Standard procedures are particularly helpful where communication is by hand or rope signal ‚Äì the hand and line signals are examples of standard procedures themselves ‚Äì as the communicating parties have a better idea of what the other is likely to do in response. Where voice communication is available, standardised communications protocol reduces the time needed to convey necessary information and the error rate in transmission. Diving procedures generally involve the correct application of the appropriate diving skills in response to the current circumstances, and range from selecting and testing equipment to suit the diver and the dive plan, to the rescue of oneself or another diver in a life-threatening emergency. In many cases, what might be a life-threatening emergency to an untrained or inadequately skilled diver, is a mere annoyance and minor distraction to a skilled diver who applies the correct procedure without hesitation. Professional diving operations tend to adhere more rigidly to standard operating procedures than recreational divers, who are not legally or contractually obliged to follow them, but the prevalence of diving accidents is known to be strongly correlated to human error, which is more common in divers with less training and experience. The Doing It Right philosophy of technical diving is strongly supportive of common standard procedures for all members of a dive team, and prescribe the procedures and equipment configuration that may affect procedures to the members of their organisations. The terms diving skills and diving procedures are largely interchangeable, but a procedure may require the ordered application of several skills, and is a broader term. A procedure may also conditionally branch or require repeated applications of a skill, depending on circumstances. Diver training is structured around the learning and practice of standard procedures until the diver is assessed as competent to apply them reliably in reasonably foreseeable circumstances, and the certification issued limits the diver to environments and equipment that are compatible with their training and assessed skill levels. The teaching and assessment of diving skills and procedures is often restricted to registered instructors, who have been assessed as competent to teach and assess those skills by the certification or registration agency, who take the responsibility of declaring the diver competent against their assessment criteria. The teaching and assessment of other task oriented skills does not generally require a diving instructor. There is considerable difference in the diving procedures of professional divers, where a diving team with formally appointed members in specific roles and with recognised competence is required by law, and recreational diving, where in most jurisdictions the diver is not constrained by specific laws, and in many cases is not required by law to provide any evidence of competence. Routine diving procedures Checking equipment function before use Fitting a lightweight demand helmet Pre-dive checks Backward roll entry stride entry from a low platform Ladder entry Descent on a diving stage Hand signal communication during a training exercise Compass navigation Ladder exit Checking the chamber BIBS Monitoring the decompression chamber These are the procedures that the diver uses during the course of a planned dive, where everything goes to plan, and there are no contingencies. Consequently, experienced divers tend to become expert in these procedures due to adequate practice. Some procedures may seldom be needed, or only be relevant to specific equipment, which is not often used, so refresher exercises are frequently required before dives using unfamiliar equipment, unusual tasks or unfamiliar conditions are expected. Dive planning, the pre- dive briefing. and selection, inspection, preparation and pre-dive checking of diving equipment, may be considered diving procedures, as they are essential parts of the normal diving operation, though they are done before entering the water. In-water procedures in this grouping include entry to the water, surface swimming, descent, buoyancy and trim control, equalisation of pressure in air spaces, maneuvering in midwater and at the bottom, monitoring the dive profile, gas supply and decompression obligations, normal ascent and exit from the water. For some divers, gas switching, deployment of a decompression buoy and staged decompression may be added, or navigation under an overhead. Communications procedures depend on equipment and mode of diving, but are also in this group. After-dive maintenance and storage of equipment, debriefing and logging the dive are also procedural parts of the normal diving operation. Clearing a flooded demand valve is both a routine procedure and an emergency procedure. It is an emergency procedure because if the DV is not cleared, the diver could aspirate water and choke, but it can easily happen, and will happen when a diver switches to a different gas supply delivered through a different DV, and there are two easy ways to deal with it, so it should not be a problem on a dive which runs according to plan. Routine scuba diving procedures (order may vary slightly, and some are also relevant to surface supplied diving, though details may vary): Selection of equipment ‚Äì A diver is expected to be able select appropriate equipment and check it for fit and function. *Preparation of equipment ‚Äì Assembly and function checks of personal diving equipment Scuba assembly ‚Äì Assembly and function check of the scuba set *Site inspection and setup Kit-up/dressing in the diver - Dressing into the diving suit, breathing apparatus, harness and accessories Pre-dive checks - Check that all necessary equipment is correctly fitted and functioning *Entering the water - Use of an appropriate water entry technique *Surface checks - Final function checks and reports before descent. *Breathing from the demand valve ‚Äì The pattern of breathing can affect work of breathing and effective dead space, both of which must be limited, and preferably minimised. Mouthpieces must seal against the lips when used to prevent aspiration of water. *Demand valve clearing ‚Äì Expelling water from the interior of the demand valve. *Descent ‚Äì A generally consistent increase in depth until the operational depth is reached. Equalisation ‚Äì Balancing pressures in air spaces with the ambient pressure. *Equalise dry suit squeeze ‚Äì Injecting sufficient gas into the dry suit for comfort and insulation *Buoyancy control ‚Äì Adjustment of the gas content in buoyancy compensator and dry suit to achieve appropriate buoyancy Trim control ‚Äì Control of attitude in the water to suit the circumstances. Depth monitoring and control ‚Äì Observation of current depth and ensuring it is appropriate *Standard dive activities Mask clearing and demisting ‚Äì Discharge of water from the mask, and rinsing off condensation from the inner surface Maneuvering and mobility ‚Äì Self-propulsion in the water column Monitoring decompression status ‚Äì Keeping track of personal decompression obligation Monitoring breathing gas supply ‚Äì Ensuring that the remaining gas supply is sufficient to complete the dive safely Balancing cylinder usage ‚Äì ensuring that enough gas to safely finish the dive remains if any one cylinder loses all remaining gas. Use of auxiliary equipment ‚Äì Useful equipment, not needed on all dives. Towing a Deployment of a *Planned diving activities - These are mostly considered underwater work, with a few exceptions and borderline cases.  - This is generally considered to be a diving skill, not a work skill. *Laying, marking, following and retrieving distance lines (guide lines). ‚Äì Safety critical procedures in an overhead environment.  ‚Äì In professional diving these may be considered diving procedures or work procedures. *Ascent ‚Äì A generally consistent decrease in depth until the surface is reached. Decompression ‚Äì The reduction in ambient pressure experienced during ascent from depth, and the process of elimination of dissolved inert gases from the diver's body tissues. No-stop diving ‚Äì Diving which limits tissue inert gas concentrations to those which allow acceptably safe surfacing without decompression stops Repetitive diving ‚Äì Diving again while some tissues have not reached equilibrium with surface saturation. Staged decompression - Decompression at fixed depth intervals, a practise which allows use of decompression tables. *Gas switching - Changing between breathing gases during a dive to a gas suited to the current depth, to limit oxygen toxicity or nitrogen narcosis, or to accelerate decompression *Management of multiple cylinders ‚Äì Managing additional cylinders with different gas mixtures. *Accelerated decompression ‚Äì Use of oxygen enriched gas mixtures to accelerate inert gas elimination. *Oxygen decompression ‚Äì Use of pure oxygen to accelerate inert gas elimination. *Monitoring decompression using a planned schedule, depth measurement and elapsed time. *Monitoring decompression using a Surfacing ‚Äì The final stage of ascent *Return to exit point ‚Äì Getting from the position of surfacing to a place where the diver can safely exit the water, usually by finning at the surface *Exit from water *Un-kit (dressing out) ‚Äì Removal of diving equipment worn and carried by the diver Log dive ‚Äì Recording specific details about the dive in a diver's logbook (paper or electronic database) *Clean, inspect and store equipment ‚Äì Basic daily user maintenance. *Pack up site Routine Surface- supplied diving procedures: *Preparing the surface supplied diving equipment *Dressing in the diver ‚Äì Dressing into the diving suit, harness, bailout set, helmet or full-face mask and accessories *Pre-dive checks - Checks that all necessary equipment is correctly fitted and functioning *Demisting the faceplate ‚Äì getting rid of condensation droplets on the inner face of the viewport to improve vision. *Clearing a flooded helmet or full-face mask ‚Äì Expelling water which found its way into the interior space and can hinder safe breathing. *Adjusting the breathing resistance ‚Äì adjusting inhalation and exhalation pressure differences to reduce the work of breathing of a demand regulator. *Voice communication ‚Äì Use of standard voice protocols to facilitate accurate and reliable communication. *Rope signals ‚Äì Use of standard code of pull signals transmitted via the lifeline or umbilical when voice is not available *Umbilical management ‚Äì Keeping slack, twists, and snags from the route of the umbilical to the diver *In-water decompression ‚Äì Fully decompressing in the water *Surface decompression ‚Äì Leaving the water before fully decompressed and recompressing in a chamber to finish the decompression in relative comfort. Routine wet bell procedures (some of these procedures also apply to closed bell operations, though details will differ): *Preparation of the bell ‚Äì Preparation of the bell for the dive and testing the bell systems. *Descent and ascent - Lowering the bell to working depth and raising it at the end of the dive, with appropriate in-water decompression stops. *Lock-out ‚Äì Deployment of the diver(s) from the bell at working depth. *Bell integrity check at the bottom ‚Äì Brief inspection of the exterior of the bell before the diver leaves the immediate vicinity. *Monitoring at the bell - Monitoring of the bell and environs and of the working diver's umbilical by the bellman. *Umbilical management ‚Äì Management of the diver's umbilical by the bellman. *Operation of the wet bell gas panel ‚Äì *In-water tending - Additional management of the diver's umbilical by an in-water tender where necessary *Securing the bell for ascent ‚Äì Stowing of umbilicals on the bell, checks that the bell is clear to be lifted, and report back to surface that the bell and divers are ready to start the ascent. Routine closed bell procedures: *Locking out of and into the bell ‚Äì Equalising the interior pressure with the water, opening the lock and entering the water, followed by checking the bell and proceeding to the worksite. Later returning to the bell, exiting the water and closing the lock to achieve a pressure seal. *Tending the working diver ‚Äì Management of the working diver's umbilical by the bellman Operation of the closed bell gas panel ‚Äì *Saturation decompression ‚Äì Decompressing back to normal surface pressure after a dive where all tissue compartments have saturated with the inert gas in the breathing mixture. Emergency procedures These are the procedures that the diver is expected to be able to follow in the event of a reasonably foreseeable contingency. Some occur quite often such as the loss of grip on the mouthpiece in scuba diving, and are therefore usually well practiced. Others, like bailing out to emergency gas supply, should never happen if the equipment does not fail and the dive is carried out according to a good plan, and must be practiced as an exercise to maintain the skill or as part of pre-dive checks to ensure that the equipment is functioning correctly, as failure to perform correctly could be fatal. Emergency procedures are procedures to recover from a contingency that could be life-threatening if not responded to promptly and correctly. Some are trivially easy for a skilled diver. They include regulator recovery, clearing a flooded mask or helmet, bailout to emergency gas supply, emergency swimming ascent (for scuba), bell abandonment, shedding of weights (scuba), breathing off the pneumofathometer hose (SSDE), and switching over to onboard gas (bell diving). In cave or wreck diving, finding a lost guideline and finding the other end of a broken line are also emergency procedures. Scuba emergency procedures: *Regulator clearing ‚Äì Removal of water from the interior of the demand valve mouthpiece. *Vomiting through the demand valve ‚Äì Clearing and flushing the demand valve after vomiting underwater *Regulator recovery ‚Äì Finding a dislodged demand valve and returning it to the mouth. *Stop freeflow - Correcting a demand valve malfunction that provides a constant high gas flow. *Bailout - Switching to emergency breathing gas supply. Bailout to open circuit - Switching to open circuit scuba emergency gas supply Bailout to closed circuit rebreather - Switching to an emergency rebreather gas supply Request gas sharing from dive buddy - Request emergency gas sharing from another diver. *Switch and isolate regulator in case of freeze - Close off a frozen regulator and switch to an alternative gas supply. *Stop and correct runaway dry suit inflation *Stop and correct runaway buoyancy compensator inflation *Manage dry suit flooding ‚Äì Manage buoyancy and insulation loss due to flooding of the dry suit *Recovery from accidental inversion in dry suit ‚Äì Avoid uncontrolled ascent following unintended flow of gas to the feet of a dry suit. *Follow guideline in silt-out - Avoid getting lost under an overhead *Find lost guideline ‚Äì Avoid getting lost under an overhead *Cross break in guideline ‚Äì Find the guideline on the other side of a break to avoid getting lost under an overhead *Emergency ascents ‚Äì Procedures for reaching the surface in various emergencies Lost mask ascent ‚Äì Ascent when the diver's vision is impaired by not having a mask. Lost buoyancy ascent ‚Äì Ascent when the diver's buoyancy is compromised Omitted decompression procedure ‚Äì Procedures for managing a failure to decompress sufficiently Assisted ascents ‚Äì Ascents where the diver in distress is assisted by another diver *Buddy breathing ascent ‚Äì Where the divers share gas supplied by one diver using the same demand valve in turns *Buddy assisted ascent ‚Äì Where the divers share gas supplied by one diver using two demand valves *Lifeline assisted ascent ‚Äì Where the diver is pulled up by the line attendant Independent emergency ascents ‚Äì Where the diver takes independent action and has no assistance *Ascent while breathing from the buoyancy compensator ‚Äì Use of the gas in the buoyancy compensator to facilitate an emergency ascent where no other gas is available to breathe. *Buoyant ascent - Using positive buoyancy to rise to the surface Lost weights ascent with flare. ‚Äì Mitigation of an incident where the diver cannot neutralise positive buoyancy Controlled buoyant emergency ascent ‚Äì Fine control of buoyancy to ascend at an acceptably safe rate *Emergency swimming ascents ‚Äì Emergency ascent where the diver actively swims upward at approximately neutral buoyancy. Free ascent ‚Äì Ascent where the diver has no source of breathing gas available Controlled emergency swimming ascent - Ascent where there may be a small amount of breathing gas which becomes available due to ambient pressure reduction. *Cut free from entanglement. *Ditch weights to establish buoyancy ‚Äì Removal of some or all ballast weights to establish neutral or positive buoyancy underwater, or to establish positive buoyancy at the surface. *Standardised emergency procedures used with manifolded twin scuba cylinders *Therapeutic recompression ‚Äì The use of recompression to treat symptomatic decompression illness. In-water recompression ‚Äì Recompression underwater to treat decompression illness or to compensate for omitted decompression. Surface supplied diving emergency procedures: *Mask or helmet clearing - expelling water from the interior of a helmet or full-face mask. *Bailout to scuba - Switching to scuba emergency gas supply. *Bailout to pneumo hose ‚Äì Using the pneumofathometer hose as an emergency gas supply. *Switch to bell onboard gas - Switch to emergency on-board gas supply in case of surface supply failure or contamination. *Abandon wet bell - Surface from wet bell which cannot be raised. *Respond to heating water malfunction - Manage thermal imbalance due to inappropriate heating water temperature. *Respond to dry suit flood - Manage insulation and buoyancy loss due to flooded dry suit. *Respond to suit blowup ‚Äì Prevent uncontrolled buoyant ascent. *Respond to buoyancy compensator blowup ‚Äì Prevent uncontrolled buoyant ascent. *Respond to voice communications failure ‚Äì Revert to rope signals. The dive may be terminated. *Free a snagged umbilical ‚Äì This could prevent the diver from surfacing. *Manage vomiting in the helmet ‚Äì Clear a helmet or full- face mask after vomiting inside it before breathing from the demand valve. *Manage a broken faceplate ‚Äì Unrestricted flooding of the helmet is a life- threatening emergency. The dive will be terminated. Flooding can be minimised by positioning the leak as low as possible and opening the free-flow valve. Wet bell emergency procedures: *Dynamic positioning alarm and runout response - Dynamic positioning failure puts the divers at risk of being dragged by their unbilicals without warning, with a risk of snagging and rupture. They will return to the bell as a matter of urgency. The bellman will take up slack to help avoid snagging. *Bell gas panel operation - The bell gas panel is used to switch to on-board gas supply if the surface supply is compromised. *Bell abandonment ‚Äì Surfacing from a disabled wet bell *Surface gas supply failure ‚Äì Switch over to on board gas supply by bellman in the event of a surface gas supply failure. *Voice communications failure *Light and gas signals for surface supplied dives *Contaminated surface gas supply ‚Äì Switch over to on board gas supply by bellman in the event of suspected contamination of the surface gas supply . Closed bell emergency procedures: *Bell umbilical failure - Switch over to onboard gas supply, emergency signals and prepare to surface *Dynamic positioning alarm and runout response *Main lifting wire/winch failure ‚Äì *Loss of bell internal pressure ‚Äì Rescue procedures Simulated rescue of an unconscious diver Demonstration of oxygen administration for diver first aid These are procedures that the professional standby diver must execute when deployed to go to the assistance of the working diver in an emergency, or the buddy or dive-team member in a recreational or technical dive should use if another member of the team is unable to manage an emergency themselves. They are also emergency procedures, but for another person's benefit. It is fairly common for a diver never to need to apply one of these procedures for real, and they too should be practiced to maintain skill levels. Professional diving organisations typically require periodical emergency exercises as specified in their operations manual to maintain these skills. Rescue procedures include following the umbilical or lifeline to the distressed diver, providing emergency breathing gas, recovering the casualty to the bell or surface, releasing a snagged umbilical, umbilical changeout at depth, providing the supervisor with continuous updates. Rescues are generally done in unexpected circumstances, and seldom follow the text-book example, so the rescue diver often has to modify the learned response to suit reality. Scuba diving rescue procedures: *Locating the casualty underwater ‚Äì Searching for the disabled diver. *Providing emergency gas ‚Äì Providing emergency breathing gas to another scuba diver *Freeing the trapped casualty ‚Äì Assisting an entrapped or snagged diver to get free. *Managing a convulsing casualty ‚Äì Recovering a diver who is convulsing underwater to the surface *Bringing the casualty to the surface ‚Äì Getting the diver to a place where first aid is possible *Controlled buoyant lift ‚Äì Lifting an incapacitated diver to the surface *Making the casualty buoyant on the surface ‚Äì Ensuring that the diver does not sink before they can be removed from the water. *Carrying out artificial ventilation in the water ‚Äì *Towing the casualty ‚Äì Getting the casualty to a place where they can be taken out of the water Surface-supplied diver rescue procedures: *Assisting a trapped diver ‚Äì The diver may be unable to release themself from the entrapment. *Umbilical changeout - Swapping a problematic umbilical for a replacement under water *Rescue of the working diver ‚Äì Getting the disabled working diver to a place of relative safety Rescue of an incapacitated diver ‚Äì Getting the diver to the surface Rescue of an unconscious diver - Getting an unconscious surface supplied diver to the surface Recovery of diver to the bell ‚Äì Getting an incapacitated diver back to the bell where a relatively secure breathing gas supply is available and some first aid is possible, and the first stage of recovery to the surface. *Rescue of divers from a disabled closed bell ‚Äì Through-water transfer to another closed bell *Lost bell procedures - Locating and lifting a closed bell when the lifting cables and umbilical have been severed References Category:Underwater diving safety ","title":"Diving procedures"},{"id":"58646543","text":"Elie House is a country house in Elie, Fife, Scotland. It is a Category A listed building. The house, built in 1697 and incorporating an earlier structure, is south facing, constructed in stone in 3 storeys, 2 bays deep with a 5-bay frontage. Later additions were made c.1770 and in 1854‚Äì55. History Elie House was built for judge Sir William Anstruther, Lord Anstruther, S.C.J. The house passed to Sir William's only son, Sir John Anstruther, 1st Baronet, of Anstruther, His son Sir John Anstruther, 2nd Baronet, of Anstruther made a major addition to Elie House and carried out a landscaping scheme in about 1771 which involved the building of a surviving summerhouse known as the Lady's Tower. He also ordered the clearance of a hamlet called Balclevie to improve the view, which, according to local legend, caused the building to be cursed by one of the uprooted victims. The house descended in the Anstruther, later Carmichael-Anstruther, family until it was sold in 1853 to the industrialist William Baird by the financially insolvent 7th baronet. Baird carried out the 1855 modifications, reconstructing the east side of the house and adding a tower. In 1928 Baird sold it to Sir Michael Nairn, 2nd Baronet. In the 1950s the house was sold to the Marie Reparatrice order of nuns who commissioned Peter Whiston in 1958 to build them a large chapel. In 2000, Elie was sold to a property developer who in 2012 converted the buildings into 13 apartments. The remainder of the Elie estate now belongs to the Trustees of the Elie Estate Trust under the stewardship of the Nairn family.

He is considered the father of the Delta Works. Education  Johan van Veen was the fifth child of seven in a farming family. He was the brother of Marie van Veen, married to the artist Johan Dijkstra. In 1913, after high school graduation, he started his studies in Delft at the Technische Hoogeschool van Delft. He studied civil engineering. In 1919, he graduated as \\"ingenieur\\" (equivalent to M.Sc. in engineering).Van der Ham (2003), ch. 1 Provincial Water Authority Drenthe Van Veen worked as an engineer for the Drainage Department of the Provincial Water Authority of the Province of Drenthe. The task of this department was to develop plans to improve the drainage and road structure of the province. In turn, this would enlarge the agricultural yield and to transport the products in a more efficient way to the markets (in the western part of the Netherlands). During World War I, it became evident that the Netherlands depended too strongly on food products from abroad. The interwar years were focused on agriculture. In order to have solid grounds for such plans, the borders of watersheds were charted, discharge measurements were made and leveling out valleys and the adjacent higher grounds works were executed. Van Veen carried out these studies in cooperation with agricultural engineer F.P. Mesu (who graduated in Wageningen).Van der Ham (2003), ch. 2 Surinam In 1926, van Veen left the Provincial Water Authority. From August 1926 to October 1928, he worked in Surinam at the Surinaamse Bauxiet Maatschappij (Suriname Bauxite Company), later a subsidiary of Alcoa, in Moengo, Suriname.Van der Ham (2003), ch. 3 Rijkswaterstaat In 1929, after his return to the Netherlands, van Veen held a position at Rijkswaterstaat (the Executive Agency of the Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure). He became head of the newly created Research Department for Tidal Rivers and Estuaries. His first assignment was to improve the hydraulic conditions at Hellegat, a complicated bifurcation of estuary branches. He also developed a new method to calculate tides, an improvement on the formulas developed by Hendrik Lorentz on the closure of the Zuiderzee. He published his Ph.D. thesis on sand movement in the Strait of Dover (which was relevant for Dutch coastal morphology), based on extensive measurements in that area. He wrote many (Dutch) reports on the coasts, tidal movements, estuaries and salt intrusion. In the years before and during World War II, van Veen executed many studies on the problem of salt intrusion into tidal rivers. During the war, he prepared a plan called \\"Verlandingsplan\\" to manipulate tidal rivers in such a way that natural silting-up would take place, and that to reclaim this new land would be easy. Just after the war, he presented this plan again, but mainly because at that time the country focused rather not on reclaiming land, but on repairing war damage.Van der Ham (2003), ch. 4 Delta Plan From 1937 onward, van Veen warned about the deplorable condition of the Dutch flood defences. He stipulated that a disaster was imminent, but politically he found no support for his warnings, the main reason being that improvement of dikes would cost a lot of money, which was not available in the Netherlands just after the war (the country depended mainly on money from the Marshall Plan). He had already published a book in English on the history of Dutch Hydraulic Engineering (Dredge, Drain, Reclaim, the Art of a Nation). In later reprints of this book he added a chapter by \\"Dr. Cassandra\\" as he used this pseudonym, including these warnings. His final warning report was a study describing the risks, including a plan to improve the situation by closing some estuaries. This document was dated January 29, 1953. During the following night The Netherlands were struck by the biggest storm surge ever, the North Sea flood of February 1st, 1953. After the disaster a State Commission was installed (18 February 1953), and Johan van Veen was appointed Secretary of the State Commission. In May 1953 the commission offered its first interim report, recommending immediate closure of the Hollandse IJssel with a storm surge barrier Flood barrier, and to implement Van Veen's plan to close the estuaries (the Delta Works). Eventually this work had been carried out; the final report of the commission was published in 1960, one year after Johan van Veen died. In The Netherlands Johan van Veen is remembered as the \\"father of the Delta Plan\\" and in England as \\"Master of the Floods\\".Van der Ham (2003), ch. 8 Inventions Johan van Veen has a number of inventions to his name. Notable is the Van Veen Grab Sampler, a device to take (disturbed) bed samples from the seabed (around 1930).Van Veen (1936), p164-166 He is also the inventor of the pneumatic barrier to prevent salt intrusion (around 1940).Van Veen (1941) In 1930, he proved the analogy between electricity and water flow. From this principle he developed an analog computer to calculate tidal flow (electric analogon).Van Veen (1937) In the period 1944-1956 it had become operational. Later on this machine was updated and became the practical computer to calculate tidal flow and water levels in the Dutch Delta (to predict the effect of closure works, the Delta Works. This analog computer now bears the name Deltar.Rooijendijk 2009, p347 Personal life and death On May 5, 1927, van Veen married Hendrika (\\"Henny\\") Aalfs during his stay in Suriname. They had three children. Unfortunately, their marriage was not very happy. Although he came from a Dutch Reformed Church family, he converted to Christian Science until 1937, following his sister Anna, who lived in the United States.Van der Ham (2003), p24 Van Veen suffered from a number of heart attacks, the first one in 1937 and later in 1948 a heavy one after his \\"four- island-plan\\" was rejected. In 1959 he had his last, fatal attack in the train when on his way to a meeting regarding his plan of a new harbour near Delfzijl, the Eemshaven.Van der Ham (2003), p228 Publications (in English) * Sand waves in the North Sea Hydrographic review, Vol. XII, No. 1 (May 1935) * Measurements in the Straits of Dover, and their relation to the Netherlands coasts (1935) PhD thesis Utrecht University * Water movements in the Straits of Dover J. of Marine Research Vol. 13, no. 1 (1938) ; p. 7-36 * The analogy between tides and electrical currents Rijkswaterstaat BER037, * Analogy between Tides and A.C.

She studied for her doctorate under the supervision of the poet Mark Ford and at Harvard with Helen Vendler and Seamus Heaney. She has published widely on twentieth- and twenty-first century British, Irish and American Poetry and is a latter day practitioner of the school of close, attentive reading espoused by critics such as Christopher Ricks and Vendler. She is Martha Gano Houstoun Research Professor of English Literature at The University of Houston. Her 2016 book Grief and Meter is the first in the field of elegy studies to consider elegies for poets as a significant elegiac subgenre for which she coins the term \\"genealogical elegies.\\" The noted British critic John Sutherland (author) describes Grief and Meter as \\"unusually thought provoking\\" and praises her \\"refreshingly sharp close readings\\". Matthew Creasy writes in a review in This Year's Work in English Studies (Oxford) that Grief and Meter is an \\"eloquent and finely observed study of the elegy for a poet as a genre, a mode and, above all, a form. Her introduction begins with Auden, and Connolly devotes a chapter to reading ‚ÄòIn Memory of W.B Yeats‚Äô as ‚Äòthe touchstone genealogical elegy of the twentieth century and beyond‚Äô. Subsequent chapters explore the working out of Auden‚Äôs influence in poetry by Joseph Brodsky, John Berryman, Robert Lowell, and Seamus Heaney. This choice of poets reveals Connolly‚Äôs opening image of Auden on the steamship to America in January 1939 as a kind of conceptual pun for her interest in transatlantic poetics. As well as a lively account of elegiac form that draws on well- established work in this area by Peter Sacks, Connolly also offers her deft close readings as a corrective to the ‚Äòdistant reading‚Äô of genres and forms offered by Franco Moretti and others.\\" In relation to her second book Ranches of Isolation, Stephanie Burt writes that Connolly, \\"has a sharp ear for how poetry sounds, for where it originates and where it ends up, and she‚Äôs in a good position to say, not just thanks to her knowledge of things Irish and Irish English and British English and American, but thanks to her knowledge about the guts of poems: past and present, early-career and deeply canonical, out-there and close to the heart, outspoken and close to the vest, get attention in Connolly‚Äôs personal, thoughtful, pellucid language.

To the north of Queensland is the Torres Strait separating the Australian mainland from Papua New Guinea. To the east of Queensland is the Coral Sea, part of the Pacific Ocean. There are many islands off the Queensland coast which form part of the state of Queensland. The far western boundary with the Northern Territory is aligned along the 138th meridian east until Poeppel Corner at the intersection of this meridian and the 26th parallel south. It is here that Queensland borders South Australia. The boundary follows this latitude until it reaches the 141st meridian east at Haddon Corner where the border turns south reaching Cameron Corner on the 29th parallel south, the most western part of the border with New South Wales. The border follows this latitude towards the coast at about the 154th meridian east before following the courses of a number of rivers, then across a number of mountain ranges until it reaches Point Danger. These rivers are the Macintyre River, Severn River and Weir Rivers, all tributaries of the Barwon River, itself a tributary of the Darling River. Southern border towns include Mungindi, Goondiwindi and Texas.  1838 Royal Geographical Society proposal  James Vetch proposal, 1838 By 1838 the coastline of the Australian continent had been well defined by mariners such as James Cook, Matthew Flinders and Phillip Parker King. As for the interior of Australia, little was known by the European settlers except for the area south of a line from Moreton Bay to Victoria as it is now (the south-east of the continent. This knowledge had been obtained from the journeys of explorers such as John Oxley, Charles Sturt, Thomas Mitchell, Allan Cunningham and George Evans. There were many proposals for the subdivision of the Australian continent dating back to the 1830s. This proposal by Captain James Vetch was published by the Royal Geographical Society in their journal of 1838. Vetch tried to give each colony equal areas, possess a tract of sea coast with possible harbour sites and be as compact as possible. The boundaries of his proposed colonies were defined using lines of latitude and longitude. This was generally used by colonial administrators when there was either no natural features such as rivers and ranges or due to exploration of the country not being well enough advanced to know if there were any natural features.  1846 The colony of North Australia  1846 Eastern Australia state boundaries The loss of the American Colonies due to the American War of Independence (1775‚Äì83) forced the British Government to find another place to send its convicted felons. Its most recent acquisition (1770) New Holland (now Australia) was chosen and the first penal settlement established at Port Jackson in 1788 by Captain Arthur Phillip. Other settlements soon followed, Norfolk Island, Van Diemen's Land (now Tasmania), Port Macquarie and in 1824 Moreton Bay. In 1840 the transportation of convicts to New South Wales ceased although Van Diemen's Land continued to receive large numbers of convicts. When William Ewart Gladstone became Secretary of State for the Colonies in 1845, he was confronted with the problem of the large numbers of pardoned convicts roaming around Van Diemen's Land unable to find work. Rather than revive transportation to New South Wales (which he knew would be very unpopular) he decided to create a new colony in the northern part of New South Wales. To this new colony he proposed to send the pardoned convicts of Van Diemen's Land and he hoped that in time they could form the backbone of a new vibrant free colony. In May 1846, Lieutenant Colonel George Barney of the Royal Engineers was chosen as the new colony administrative head. He was soon despatched to Sydney and instructed to find a suitable site to the north of Moreton Bay, but not that far north that the tropical climate would have an adverse effect on the health of the settlers, preventing them from hard work and industry. Port Curtis (now Gladstone in Queensland) was chosen. Also in the same month the official Letters Patent were issued by Queen Victoria forming a new colony to be called North Australia. The southern boundary of this new colony was to be 26 degrees of south latitude (just south of present day Maryborough, Queensland). On 8 January 1847, the Lord Auckland sailed from Sydney with the new colonial officials and their families arriving at Port Curtis on 25 January 1847. On entering the port the Lord Auckland grounded on a shoal. The officials quickly headed for shore and a few days later, the official swearing in of Lieutenant Governor Barney and his officials took place. In July 1846, back in Britain, the Government had changed and Henry Grey, 3rd Earl Grey had replaced Gladstone as Secretary of State for the Colonies. The new government had decided to abandon the new colony and advised the Queen to revoke the Letters Patent. This decision took many months to reach the Governor of New South Wales, Sir Charles Augustus FitzRoy, and then to be transmitted to Barney ordering the abandonment of the North Australia colony and the return to Sydney. The officials in Port Cursis had endured 4 months of indecision, rain, heat, and mosquitoes before they returned to the civilisation of Sydney where they arrived in May 1847. No pardoned convict ever reached the new colony.  1851 John Dunmore Lang colony  1851 map of the proposed Cooksland state border along a line at 30 degrees south latitude In 1823, John Dunmore Lang (1799‚Äì1878) a Presbyterian clergyman, politician, immigration organiser, educationist, journalist, patriot and statesman arrived in Sydney to take up his ministry. Lang soon realised that the poverty he left behind in Britain could be relieved to some extent by emigration to Australia, feeling that a well-off protestant peasantry would reduce the problems of English industrialism. To this end he was always looking for suitable new areas and country away from the problems of Sydney and Hobart. In 1845, Lang visited Moreton Bay and was so impressed that in 1848 he persuaded and personally selected approximately 600 immigrants to come to Moreton Bay, who arrived in Moreton Bay in 1849 on the ships Fortitude, Chaseley, and Lima. Lang's promise of free land in proportion to their passage money was not realised due to colonial bureaucracy and his scheme failed. In the years 1847‚Äì49, while visiting England, Lang wrote a series of letters to Earl Grey (Secretary of State for the Colonies) recommending that a new colony be created out of New South Wales to the northward of 30 degrees of south latitude. The British Government must have been influenced by Lang‚Äôs proposals as in 1851 they passed an Imperial Act, the Australian Colonies Government Act, which contained a clause (Section 34) which provided for the establishment of new colonies in the future. In 1856, the Secretary of State for the Colonies announced that it was their intention to create a new colony whose southern border line would run not far to the south of 30 degrees south latitude (just south of present day Grafton, New South Wales) but would be accommodated to suit the natural features of the country. During the next few years strong debate ensued, petitions for and against (from both the squatters and merchants in the proposed border area) were sent to the Governor of New South Wales, Sir William Denison as well as the Secretary of State for the Colonies in Britain. Lang kept agitating for his colony which he proposed to call \\"Cooksland\\" after Captain James Cook where he hoped to settle Protestants as small farmers who would grow crops of cotton and sugar. The considerable influence of the New England and Armidale squatters was to greatly affect the location of the border. They feared that if they were to be located in the new colony then their power base, which was in the Sydney Parliament would be eroded. As a result, in 1857 Denison proposed a border starting further north along the coastline at Point Danger (about 28 degrees south latitude). He wrote to Henry Lebouchere, the Secretary of State for the Colonies and recommended that the boundaries of the new north-eastern colony be: > \\"Starting from Cape Danger and following the range of hills which now > separate the district of Clarence River from that of Moreton Bay, it should > continue along the ridge forming the boundary of the basins of the Richmond > and the Clarence until it reaches the Parallel of 29¬∫ of south latitude, > along which it should continue westward till it reaches the meridian of 141¬∫ > East‚Ä¶\\"  Boundaries proclaimed at separation  Queensland boundaries as proclaimed at separation in 1859 On 6 June 1859, Queen Victoria signed the Letters Patent that proclaimed a separate colony from New South Wales was created and to be called Queensland. It also established the first borders of the state based on Denison's proposal as follows:Letters Patent 1859. Queensland Government Gazette, 1859, p. 1. > \\"...Now know you, that We have, in pursuance of the powers vested in Us by > the said Bill and Act, and of all other powers and authorities in Us in that > behalf vested separated from our Colony of New South Wales, and erected in > to a separate Colony, so much of the said colony of New South Wales as lies > northward of a line commencing on the sea coast at Point Danger, in latitude > about 28¬∫ 8‚Äô south, and following the range thence which divides the waters > of the Tweed, Richmond, and Clarence Rivers from those of the Logan and > Brisbane Rivers, westerly, to the great dividing range between the waters > falling to the east coast and those of the River Murray; following the great > dividing range southerly to the range dividing the waters of Tenterfield > Creek from those of the main head of the Dumaresq River; following that > range westerly to the Dumaresq River; and following that river (which is > locally known as the Severn) downward to its confluence with the Macintyre > River; thence following the Macintyre River, which lower down becomes the > Barwan, downward to the 29th parallel of south latitude, and following that > parallel westerly to the 141st meridian of east longitude, which is the > eastern boundary of South Australia, together with all and every the > adjacent Islands, their members and appurtenances, in the Pacific Ocean: And > do by these presents separate from our said colony of New South Wales and > erect the said territory so described into a separate colony to be called > the colony of Queensland...\\"  1862 change to Queensland's western border  1862 change to Queensland's western border The western boundary of the colony of Queensland was not clearly described in the Letters Patent of 1859: > \\"...downward to the 29th parallel of south latitude and following that > parallel westerly to the 141st meridian of east longitude which is the > easterly boundary of South Australia...\\" Legal opinion given at the time stated that the 141st meridian was the western boundary of the colony. In a memorandum to the Governor of Queensland dated 28 September 1860, the Surveyor General of Queensland, Augustus Charles Gregory, described his views on the division of Northern Australia. This was with reference to the adjustment of the political boundaries. On Queensland's western boundary, he said: > \\"The western boundary of Queensland, as at present defined, appears to be > the 141st meridian, but it is probable that it was not described in the > Letters Patent erecting the Colony, with greater distinctness, expressly > with a view to a future adjustment, when more certain information should > have been collected as to the natural features of the country.\\" He went on to say:AC Gregory, 'Respecting the Western Boundary of Queensland', Queensland Parliamentary Papers, 1861, p. 3. > \\"It is now submitted that the 141st meridian passes through the tract of > country known as the 'Plains of Promise', and that the eastern shore > possesses no harbours. It would therefore be desirable to adopt the 138th > meridian as the boundary; as that line would pass through a barren tract of > country, and bring Investigator Road [harbour] within the limits of > Queensland.\\" Investigator Road is an anchorage off Sweers Island in the Gulf of Carpentaria at named by Matthew Flinders on 21 November 1802. The Plains of Promise was the area now in the vicinity of Burketown at , which was named by John Lort Stokes, Commander of in August 1841. In 1861, the South Australian, Victorian and Queensland governments funded expeditions to rescue the Burke and Wills expedition. They had failed to return from their journey to the Gulf of Carpentaria in 1860. The Queensland Government realised that these expeditions would increase the knowledge of the country in the vicinity of the Gulf. On 5 September 1861, Queensland Governor George Bowen informed the Secretary of State for the Colonies that Queensland Parliament would protect any settlers who moved into the area. This was on the provision that the western boundary of Queensland was extended to include the Gulf of Carpentaria. This proposal was accepted by the British Government, provided that the Queensland Government understood that the additional territory west of the 138th meridian could be taken back at a later date. This was with a view for the formation of another separate colony in that area. On 12 April 1862, a supplementary commission altering the boundary of Queensland was issued by the British Government. These Letters Patent described the additional territory annexed to the Colony of Queensland as:Letters Patent 1862. Queensland Government Gazette, 1859, p. 295. > \\"So much of our Colony of New South Wales as there to the northward of the > twenty-sixth parallel of south latitude and between the one hundred and > forty first and one hundred and thirty-eighth meridians of east longitude, > together with all and every, the adjacent islands, their members and > appurtenances in the Gulf of Carpentaria.\\" It was at this stage that the bend in the western boundary of Queensland came into existence.  Surveying the Queensland-New South Wales border  The state corners In 1863, surveyors Francis Edward Roberts from Queensland and Isaiah Rowland from New South Wales were chosen to survey the boundary line between Queensland and New South Wales. The survey of the Queensland ‚Äì New South Wales border was to be made up of 3 components: *Point Danger to the Dumaresq River * Dumaresq to the Macintyre and Barwon rivers *29th parallel of south latitude. Monument to Roberts and Rowland, 2018 Only the parallel of latitude and the border ranges had to be surveyed. The river section did not require survey as it was a natural feature and was readily identifiable. Starting from Point Danger in June 1863, the surveyors marked a rock with their initials. The mark included a colony abbreviation and the last two digits of the year. However, the rock mark was lost at the turn of the century, probably due to quarrying. Although two separate surveys were carried out, in many instances both surveyors used the same tree to mark the corners. As a result of the two different surveys, Rowland and Roberts defined the border in different positions. At the direction of the Queensland Surveyor- General, Roberts deviated from the definable position of the watershed in order to increase accuracy of the survey. The New South Wales and Queensland governments have since essentially adopted the survey of Roberts in preference to that by Rowland. In 2001 as part of the celebration of the centenary of the Federation of Australia, a monument to Roberts and Rowland was placed on the border of Queensland and New South Wales at . = Gregory's and Greaves' survey = The initial survey of latitude 29¬∫S was fixed in 1865 by the Queensland Surveyor General, Sir Augustus Charles Gregory and District Surveyor from Armidale, New South Wales, William Albert Baylesford Greaves. The purpose of the survey was to give landholders in the vicinity of the border an indication of the extent of their leases and rent payable in each colony. WD Campbell reported in The Surveyor in 1895: > \\"In 1865, an arrangement was made between New South Wales and Queensland for > the fixing of the position of the intercolonial boundary line, the 29th > parallel of latitude, at the intersections of the Rivers Barwon, Mooni, > Bokhara, Narran, Biri and Culgoa, to enable the Governments of the > respective colonies to adjust the rents of leases of the several pastoral > runs affected, some of which were partly in both colonies... The marking of > the border was done with steel [iron] pins one inch in diameter and two feet > long, driven a few inches below the surface ... This process was repeated at > each of the above named rivers, and the work was completed in five or six > weeks.\\" = The official determination survey = Zero Obelisk The official survey of the 29¬∫S parallel was conducted by John Brewer Cameron (NSW) and George Chale Watson (Qld) between 1879 and 1881. Astronomical observations were taken at the Barringun telegraph station to determine the latitude and longitude. Following these observations, the Zero Obelisk was erected on the banks of the Warrego River, just north of the town. Cameron's Corner survey mark From this mark, the first 5 mile chord was produced westerly and the mile posts offset from this chord to the arc (chord and arc are used when surveying latitude to allow for curvature of the earth). This continued until the survey intersected longitude 141¬∫ (now known as Cameron Corner), a distance of 285 miles 24.96 chains. That spot is marked by the Cameron Corner Survey Marker. Watson withdrew from the survey and Cameron then returned to the Zero Obelisk at Barringun and marked the line to the east in a similar fashion. Cameron then erected a 1 ton survey post on the west bank of the Barwon River to mark the end of the survey.  Surveying the Queensland-South Australia border  The survey of the Queensland ‚Äì South Australian border was first carried out by South Australian surveyor, William Barron, as Queensland did not have a surveyor available at the time. Barron carried the marking of the 141st meridian up to its intersection with the 29th parallel of south latitude (Cameron Corner), and then on to Cooper Creek (90 miles north of that intersection). Barron was forced to return to Adelaide in late 1879 due to ill health. South Australian surveyors, Augustus Poeppel and assistant Lawrence Wells, took over the survey in January 1880. The line to the 26th parallel was continued, a distance of 552¬º miles from the Murray River. Here Poeppel met up with Queensland surveyor, Alexander Hutchinson Salmond. Together they took star observations for latitude using both a transit theodolite and sextant to fix the position of that parallel. They marked the corner with a willow post 12 feet long, which was sunk over an iron bar. A zinc plate from a milepost The line was marked by mile posts mounded and trenched. A zinc plate was attached to the posts declaring the distance from the centre of the Murray River. Poeppel then continued to mark the 26th parallel to the west. He reached the 138th meridian by the end of 1880 and returned to Adelaide in March 1881 due to the prevailing drought conditions. Many hardships were encountered on this survey as the line passed through vast stony, waterless plains, salt lakes and large sand hills. It was thought to be the most inhospitable country in Australia. While Poeppel was recuperating in Adelaide, the South Australian triangulation survey had reached beyond the border. It was found that when checking the mile posts, they were in error due to the fact that Poeppel's chain was 1 inch too long as a result of wear.  Surveying the Queensland-Northern Territory border  Poeppel Corner Marker The work of running the line true north along the 138th meridian from the intersection of the 26th parallel (Poeppel Corner) to the Gulf of Carpentaria, was carried out in early 1884 by Augustus Poeppel. He was assisted by Lawrence Wells, along with 6 assistants and 2 cameleers. At the 250 mile post, the survey ceased for the 1884 Christmas break, allowing the survey party to have a well earned rest. Up until then drought conditions had prevailed. In January 1885, the rains came and local stations recorded as much as in a few days. After the rains, conditions had improved and the survey recommenced with rapid progress until they reached the ranges north of the Nicholson River. Here the team experienced all sorts of difficulties including rocky terrain, a fire that destroyed their camp and raids by Aboriginals. At the 324 mile post, Poeppel had to return to Adelaide due to severe eye problems. John Carruthers took his place as leader of the survey and Lawrence Wells continued as second in command. The country improved as the survey continued northwards and the pastoral stations became more frequent and closer to the boundary. Once they had reached the shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria in September 1886, they erected a large terminal survey post, 50 links above high water mark. It was later discovered that due to problems with Poeppel's theodolite he and his team ran the line at about 359¬∞58'30\\" instead of true north 360¬∞. This resulted in a discrepancy of about 600 metres into the Northern Territory at the shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria. = Checking longitude 138 degrees = The remains of one of surveyor Cecil Twisden Bedford's bottles While Queensland did not provide a team for the survey, they did check the position of the mile post on the border line west of Boulia. Staff surveyor Cecil Twisden Bedford was chosen by the Queensland Surveyor General, William Alcock Tully, to carry out this check survey. Arriving in Boulia in August 1885, Bedford established his starting point in the post and telegraph reserve. This was the location where the longitude reading determined by electric telegraph was recorded. Bedford then traversed westward to the border, connecting on to the border between the 255 mile and 255 mile 77 chain posts in February 1886. Bedford's traverse was marked with wooden mile posts for the 147 miles to the border. A bottle containing concrete and an empty brass cartridge case was sunk 2¬Ω feet below every fifth wooden post. Bedford's second in command, William Davidson, in later years wrote: > \\"As white ants were very bad out there, it is quite possible that very few > traces remain of our work above ground, but perhaps the bottles of cement we > placed at every five miles along our line may prove interesting to > scientists of some future generation, should they ever be unearthed.\\" In 1988, as a special project for the Australian Bicentenary, the Queensland Division of the Institute of Engineering and Mining Surveyors of Australia retraced Bedford's survey and found his bottles. = Fixing the longitude = In 1887, Queensland staff surveyors Robert Hoggan and Robert Grant McDowall carried out observations at the post and telegraph station in Boulia. This fixed the longitude of Bedford's initial starting point. The method used was the exchange of time signals via the electric telegraph. This was between the Brisbane Observatory of known longitude, and Bedford's starting point beside the telegraph office in Boulia. By using a traverse they were able to obtain a longitude value for the mile post out on the border west of Boulia. Bedford's observation revealed that the mile posts placed on the border by the South Australian surveyors were accurate.

The community was situated near the mouth of the Rocher River, which drains into Great Slave Lake. It began in the 1920s as a small Hudson's Bay Company trading post and had grown by the mid 1950s to include a government day school, two trading posts, post office, and a church, with a population of about 150. At the time, the area was a very rich hunting and trapping area for the Dene and Metis people living on the south shore of Great Slave Lake including the Slavey, Chipeywan, and Yellowknives tribes. The manager of the Hudson's Bay Company post at Rocher River in the early 1940s was Ralph Jardine. On April 25, 1944, the warehouses of the HBC burned down but were immediately rebuilt. The Moccasin Telegraph, Summer 1944 The decline of the community occurred in several stages: In February 1960, the school was destroyed by fire The News of the North, March 3, 1960 and the government decided not to rebuild in favour of centralizing education services at Fort Smith, Yellowknife and Fort Resolution instead. Many families and their children moved away as a result. In 1963, the Hudson's Bay Company closed its post, and in 1964 Ed and Rose Demelt's store burned down Tapwe newspaper, December 24, 1964, forcing their retirement from business. Furthermore, the construction of the Taltson River hydro dam upstream of Rocher River flooded many trap lines and gave further reason for the few remaining residents to move away. Former residents of Rocher River can be found living throughout the Northwest Territories with some still maintaining seasonal cabins at Rocher River.

She was formerly the President of the William and Sue Gross Foundation until creating the Sue J. Gross Foundation in 2017. Her net worth is estimated at $1.3 billion.  Early life and education  Sue Gross was born in February 1950 in Phoenix Arizona. She has two sisters: Sally Warpinski and Sandra Stubban. In 1985, Sue moved to Laguna Beach, California, where she has been a resident since.  Career  Sue has served on the following Boards: UCA Sue & Bill Gross School of Nursing Dean‚Äôs Cabinet, OC Teacher of the Year, and Irvine Cove Community Board.  Philanthropy  Sue Gross is a known and dedicated philanthropist. As president of the William and Sue Gross Family Foundation, Sue was in charge of and directed the more than $700 million the foundation gave to worthy causes in healthcare, medical research, and education. Bill Gross publicly acknowledged Sue Gross‚Äô leadership and contributions to the family foundation in an interview with Bloomberg in 2016 stating, ‚ÄúSue‚Äôs in charge of that [the foundation]. She spends all her time looking for opportunities, a lot of it local. I report to her.\\" Sue is no longer connected to the foundation, a representative said, and runs another under her own name. On January 21, 2005, Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, announced a $23.5 million gift from Bill and Sue Gross to endow undergraduate and medical school scholarships, as well as support business school faculty members. ‚ÄúNow [Bill] and Sue are making an investment in the lives of countless students, whose Duke education will benefit them and all those it will enable them to serve. Continuing to attract excellent students and enlarging the endowment to support our ‚Äòneed-blind‚Äô admissions policy are among my highest priorities, and I am profoundly grateful that the Grosses have so generously supported these important goals,‚Äù said Duke president Richard H. Brodhead. Their fortune placed the couple among the preeminent philanthropists in Orange County‚Äîin 2010 they made a gift of $10 million in seed money to fund a stem cell laboratory at UC Irvine. After seeing a heart- wrenching ‚Äú60 Minutes‚Äù report in 2012, the couple reportedly started writing anonymous $15,000 checks to workers laid off from the Space Shuttle program after NASA ended it. Bill and Sue Gross‚Äôs largest gift was $40 million to the University of California, Irvine in 2016 to establish a nursing school and assist in the construction of a new building to house it. The contribution, which the university said would help address critical healthcare concerns, was the largest single gift ever to UCI. Together, the couple became synonymous with Southern California philanthropy, with Sue leading their eponymous foundation. Hospitals and research wings throughout the state bear the Gross family name, as well as a $10 million Smithsonian Institution stamp-collecting gallery in Washington, DC, where they avid philatelist‚Äôs collection is on display. In 2017, Sue Gross started her own charitable vehicle, Sue J. Gross Foundation. The first announced donation was a portion of the $36.9 million in proceeds from Sue's sale of Pablo Picasso‚Äôs ‚ÄúLe Repos‚Äù. She donated $35,000 in October 2018 to the inaugural Chef Masters event on behalf of the Alzheimer‚Äôs Family Center in Orange County. She gave $5,000 to the Los Angeles Center for Law and Justice‚Äôs 46th Annual Awards Gala in May 2019.  Personal life  In 1985, Sue married Bill H. Gross, the billionaire co-founder of Pacific Investment Management Co. before Bill left to join Janus Capital Group (now Janus Henderson) in September 2014.[1] Together, the two had a son: musician and entrepreneur Nick Gross, with Bill Gross. She was also the stepmother to Bill Gross‚Äô two adult children from a former marriage. Sue and Bill divorced in 2018. Sue is a noted fan of fine art. Bill even praised her abilities in a 2015 letter to investors, saying she loved to trace her own versions of famous works by projecting them onto a blank canvas. Her former husband characterized her as \\"the artist in the family. She likes to paint replicas of some of the famous pieces, using an overhead projector to copy the outlines and then just sort of fill in the spaces. ‚ÄòWhy spend $20 million?‚Äô she‚Äôd say ‚Äì ‚ÄòI can paint that one for $75‚Äô, and I must admit that one fabulous Picasso with signature ‚ÄòSue‚Äô, heads the fireplace mantle in our bedroom.\\" When it came to divvying up their assets, in August 2017, Sue won a coin flip for ‚ÄúLes Repos,‚Äù a sensual 1932 painting of Picasso‚Äôs ‚Äúgolden muse‚Äù and lover, Marie-Therese Walter. The Picasso became a source of contention during the couple's divorce when Bill Gross accused his ex-wife of switching out the original Picasso \\"Le Repos\\" with a forgery though legal testimony made it clear that Mr. Gross had instructed her to ‚Äútake all the furniture and art you like‚Äù and a subsequent media report pointed out Mr. Gross was aware of the existence of a replica. Through a representative, Sue claimed there was no way Bill could have been fooled by her imitation ‚Äì no matter how pristine ‚Äì because it has a different frame than the original Picasso. In another case, Sue Gross played a practical joke on her ex-husband when he was expecting a delivery of the rare 1-cent Z-Grill stamp from 1868 featuring Benjamin Franklin as the final piece of his stamp collection. Worth an estimated $2.97 million, the stamp arrived at the Gross home, where Sue accepted the package and opened it. She created a \\"new\\" Z-Grill and marked the fake stamp in pesos, then repackaged the faux Z-Grill in a FedEx envelope. After he figured out the ruse, Gross put both the real stamp and impostor in his stamp album, writing the $2.97 million cost under the real stamp, and \\"priceless\\" under Sue‚Äôs version, which he admitted was the favorite of the two.  Divorce  By the summer of 2016, Sue had moved out of the couple‚Äôs $31 million seaside mansion in Laguna Beach, opting to split her time among their two homes in the Los Angeles area because of Bill‚Äôs ‚Äúincreasingly erratic and abusive behavior,‚Äù she alleged in court documents filed later that year. She filed for divorce on November 22, 2016. \\"After I filed the petition, Bill commended a rampage against me and members of my family,‚Äù she alleged in court filings. Sue and her attorneys filed copies of these emails with the court as part of her evidence in an application for a temporary restraining order against Bill.\\" Temporary restraining orders have been issued at one point or another against both parties. Sue received roughly $1.3 billion in the divorce including a $36 million house in Laguna Beach and half of the couple's art collection.  Real estate  Sue Gross is a significant owner of residential real estate in Southern California, with two homes in Beverly Hills, and five houses and a lot in the private community of Irvine Cove in Laguna Beach, several of which she received in the divorce from Bill Gross. Sue has been investing in real estate for more than 30 years and is estimated to have netted millions of dollars over the years.

She died young, and her body of work is limited mostly to occasional poetry, though she also wrote a few satirical poems which argued for a classical education. Life and work Lenige was born in Makkum, in 1755, the daughter of poet and merchant Dirk Lenige and Akke Rymersma; she had one sister and two brothers, and the family were Mennonites. Due to frail health she never attended school, but was taught at home, first by her father and then by Teake Dooitzens, a teacher who ran a local school. She was taught to write in Dutch and was never taught Latin. She never married, and thus had ample opportunity to educate herself, and to read and write in a room of her own. Under the influence of her father she began writing poetry at an early age, and her earliest work consisted of occasional poems for birthdays, births, and marriages. Her collection of poetry also included a number of satirical poems, in which Lenige, who herself never enjoyed a classical education, participated in a then-current debate about the appropriateness of using the classics in contemporary literature. She argued for it, defending, for instance, the practice of Joost van den Vondel. She was a member of Makkum's \\"Konst voedt 's menschen geluk\\", a society of poets. She was in touch with poets in other parts of the Netherlands, including, likely, Willem Bilderdijk; that he had been in love with her is most likely a myth. Her work does show she was influenced by other poets, including Hubert Kornelisz. Poot and Lucretia Wilhelmina van Merken. Lenige died of dysentery at a young age, and her work was published posthumously in 1782, under the title Mengeldichten (\\"Miscellaneous poetry\\"). Most of her poems were written in Dutch, but two Frisian language poems of hers survive. A street in Makkum, the Cynthia Lenigestraat, is named for her. A memorial stone on the south side of Makkum's Doniakerk was raised in her honor.

Two officers were killed.  Incident  On October 3, 2018, police officers arrived at the home of Fredrick Hopkins to serve a search warrant for his adopted son, Seth Hopkins, who was wanted on charges of sexual assault. At about 4:30 pm EDT [8:30 pm GMT], Frederick Hopkins allegedly opened fire at officers. According to the Richland County Sheriff the officers were ambushed by the suspect; when three officers exited their vehicle to walk to the house, they were shot at without warning. Florence County Emergency Management Officials said reports of \\"shots fired and officer down\\" were issued and responded to at 4:37 EDT, and that the suspect had barricaded himself inside the home with an unspecified number of children. Owing to the number of rounds being fired at officers, it took officers about 30 minutes to get an armored vehicle close enough to evacuate the wounded officers. = Victims = Two female Florence County Deputies and three Florence City Police officers were wounded, with an armored vehicle utilized as a method to rescue downed officers during the shoot-out. An individual inside the home was also shot according to local reporters, with four other civilians reported as being injured. The slain officers were identified as Sgt. Terrance Carraway, 52 years old and a 30-year veteran of the Florence Police Department, and Investigator Farrah Turner, 36 years old and a 12-year veteran of the Florence County Sheriff's Office.  Suspects  = Fred Hopkins = The suspect, 74-year-old Fred Hopkins, a Vietnam War veteran and a former lawyer who was disbarred in 1982, was arrested at the scene before being taken to the hospital for a head injury. On October 5, police charged Hopkins with one count of murder and six counts of attempted murder. A magistrate denied bond for Fred Hopkins on the murder count and the attempted murder charges so that a global bond could be applied to all charges on a later date. = Seth Hopkins = Seth Hopkins, Fred Hopkins' adopted son, who was subject to the initial search warrant before the incident, was charged with criminal sexual conduct with a minor between the ages of 11 and 14. The warrant, released on October 11, detailed that Seth Hopkins had engaged in sexual intercourse, activity/fondling and made inappropriate comments towards a female child on several occasions between September 2017 and October 2018. Hopkins later pled guilty to one count of criminal sexual conduct in the second degree, was sentenced to 20 years in prison, and is currently imprisoned in the Kirkland Correctional Institution.https://public.doc.state.sc.us/scdc- public/https://www.thestate.com/news/local/crime/article238424563.html  Aftermath  = Investigation = The Richland County Sheriff's Office of Columbia, SC, took over the investigation on October 4, and 25 agents from the FBI Evidence Response Team arrived on scene to assist deputies on October 5. The Richland County Sheriff told reporters that the incident would have occurred regardless of the arresting officers' actions, stating: \\"The officers did absolutely nothing wrong. This was an ambush you can't prevent.\\" = Legal proceedings = https://www.thestate.com/news/local/crime/article243485436.html = Memorials = Two official crowdfunding campaigns for the wounded, endorsed by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Officers Association, were launched, as well as separate campaigns through the City of Florence Police Benevolent Fund and the City of Florence website. Neighborhoods utilized blue light bulbs and flags to honor the deceased and injured victims, and food deliveries were sent to the families of officers who were hospitalized. A former officer created a \\"thin blue line\\" American flag that was signed by different police departments across the country, then presented to the family of fallen officer Sgt. Carraway.

The order marked the final change of attitude of Fascist Italy towards the Jewish minority in the country, having gone from allowing active participation in the Fascist movement to the, official, start of discrimination with the Italian Racial Laws of 1938, to declaring them as of \\"enemy nationality\\" at the Congress of Verona in early November 1943 and, ultimately, to arrest and deportation to extermination camps with the Police Order No. 5 at the end of November. The impact of the order can be judged by the fact that approximately half of the Jews arrested in Italy during the Holocaust were arrest by Italian police and the fact that Fascist Italy opened a number of concentration camps for arrested Jews immediately following the issue of the police order. Prelude Up to 1938, the approximately 40,000 Italian Jews suffered far less persecution in Fascist Italy than the Jews in Nazi Germany did in the lead up to World War II. In the territories occupied by the Italian Army in Greece, France and Yugoslavia after the outbreak of World War II Jews even found protection from persecution. This began to change with the Italian Racial Laws of 1938, when Jews lost their civil rights, including to property, education, and employment. Unlike Jews in other Axis-aligned countries, they were however not murdered or deported to extermination camps at this point. On 25 July 1943, with the fall of the Fascist Regime, the situation in Italy temporarily changed, with inmates in internment camps gradually released, including Jewish prisoners. This process was however not completed by the time German authorities took over the camps in September 1943, after the Italian surrender on 8 September. The attitude of the Italian Fascists towards Italian Jews drastically changed again in November 1943, after the Fascist authorities declared them to be of \\"enemy nationality\\" during the Congress of Verona and begun to actively participate in the prosecution and arrest of Jews. Initially, after the Italian surrender, the Italian police had only assisted in the round up of Jews when requested to do so by the German authorities. With the Manifest of Verona, in which Jews were declared to be foreigners and, in times of war, enemies, this changed. Order The order was issued by phone by Guido Buffarini Guidi, Minister of the Interior of the Italian Social Republic on the evening of 30 November 1943 and confirmed the following day through telegram. The order specified the confiscation of their property and internment of all Jews except those born of mixed marriages, stipulating that the police should monitor the latter. It also specified that the arrested Jews should be held in concentration camps. Execution of order Police Order No. 5 did not mark the start of the arrest, deportation and murder of Jews in Italy, which had begun almost immediately after the start of the German occupation in September. In case of the Raid of the Ghetto of Rome on 16 October 1943, when over 1,000 Jews were arrested to be deported and killed at Auschwitz, the Roman police had not participated and had not been asked to as the Germans considered them to be to unreliable. Up to the issuing of the police order, Italian police had only assisted the Germans in the arrest and persecution of Jews when requested to. From 1 December 1943 it did so on its own accord. The Fascist Italian government also established concentration camps for arrested Jews following the issuing of Police Order No. 5, like the Fossoli camp, reopened in December 1943, which was eventually handed over to the Germans in March 1944. The issue of Italian involvement in the Holocaust in Italy has, for many decades after the war, seen little attention in the country but it is estimated that approximately half of all Jews arrested during the Holocaust in Italy were arrested by the Italian police. In the 19 month of German occupation, from September 1943 to May 1945, twenty percent of Italy's pre-war Jewish population, 8,000 people, were killed by the Nazis. The actual Jewish population in Italy during the war was however higher than the initial 40,000 as the Italian government had evacuated 4,000 Jewish refugees from its occupation zones to southern Italy alone. By September 1943, 43,000 Jews were present in northern Italy and, by the end of the war, 40,000 Jews in Italy had survived the Holocaust. Amended order Guido Buffarini Guidi amended his order ten days later, on 10 December, to now exclude Jews over the age of 70 or gravely ill from arrest. This change caused some confusion and was not well received by the Germans who wanted all Jews arrested and deported.

An open club, it sponsored dances and balls in the vicinity of Bayou St John and closed due to the financial crisis of 1837. The Pelican Club founded 1843 and folded at the beginning of the Civil War, confined its membership through blackball policies to bankers, cotton brokers, attorneys, physicians, and political leaders; the smallest lapse in credit spelled denial of membership. Younger gentlemen, who had been rejected membership to the Pelican Club, organized The Orleans Club in 1851 with similar, yet less restrictive, membership policies; but similarly shuttered its doors, never to reopen, at the outset of the Civil War. Members of this club full of jovial mirth would go on to found The Pickwick Club, the city's second-oldest Gentlemen's Club, and found modern-day Carnival.New Orleans Carnival Krewes: The History, Spirit & Secrets of Mardi Gras, Rosary O'Neill, Arcadia Publishing, Feb 11, 2014.

Times Democrat. 4 June 1899. Quoted in Landry. History of the Boston Club. p. 6. Significance The Boston Club is a social club composed mainly of Anglo- American men. Its clubhouse has held lavish balls, regular daily lunches, and monthly dinners. Its events and social activities were the fodder for many newspaper and social columns at the turn of the 19th century and on into the 20th century. That a lavish club lifestyle could be centered around something as simple as a card game serves as a sign of prosperous times in New Orleans.

Founded in 1857, The Pickwick Club and the Mystic Krewe of Comus were originally one group comprising two organizations. After The Boston Club, The Pickwick Club is the second oldest remaining in the city. History The Pickwick Club The history of social clubs in New Orleans began with The Elkin Club, founded 1832 and folded in 1838, was an open club that sponsored dances and balls in the vicinity of Bayou St John and closed due to the financial crisis of 1837. The Pelican Club, founded 1843 and folded at the beginning of the Civil War, confined its membership through blackball policies to bankers, cotton brokers, attorneys, physicians and political leaders; the smallest lapse in credit spelled denial of membership. Younger gentlemen, who had been rejected membership to the Pelican Club, organized The Orleans Club in 1851 with similar, yet less restrictive, membership policies; but similarly shuttered its doors, never to reopen, at the outset of the Civil War. It was the ex-members of The Orleans Club, who would have themselves organized a carnival celebration, that would go on to form The Pickwick Club.New Orleans Carnival Krewes: The History, Spirit & Secrets of Mardi Gras, Rosary O'Neill, Arcadia Publishing, Feb 11, 2014. In 1857 a group of men, some former Orleans Club members, who resided in the Anglo-American neighborhoods of New Orleans, met in the Club Room of the Gem Saloon-a former residence of William Parker of Natchez, located at Old No 17 Royal Street (127 Royal Street) . The idea was initially conceived at Pope‚Äôs pharmacy on the corner of Jackson and Prytania. Six gentlemen (originally from Mobile, Alabama) sent out an invitation to a select group of friends to meet at the Gem Saloon, where The Pickwick Club and the first carnival organization the Mistick Krewe of Comus was organized. Pickwick Club Carnival Pass 1899 The Pickwick, unlike the Boston Club, began as a \\"closed club,\\" but evidence suggests before the turn of the 19th century the club allowed members to extend the club's hospitality to out of town guests during Carnival. Background Mobile, Alabama, the former capital of French Louisiana, had adopted Mardi Gras celebrations sometime before New Orleans. There the earliest mystic society formed was known as the Cowbellions de Rakin Society. These revelers, known as Cowbellions, a few of whom emigrated to New Orleans, decided to continue their carnival traditions there. Augusto P.

His works include a significant body of lithographs and etchings showing steelworkers, pipe workers, and other aspects of American industrial life, carefully composed compositions depicting \\"the daily heroism of America's industrial workers.‚Äù Allen was also a prolific illustrator who, working mostly in oil, contributed numerous illustrations to stories in popular magazines of the day. He has been misidentified in many references as James Edward Allen. Early life When Allen was three his family moved to a rural area outside Anaconda, Montana. Known as ‚ÄúEdd‚Äù to his family and friends, he and his younger brother, Elmer ‚ÄúLee‚Äù Allen (1896-1971), loved the rugged outdoor life in Montana and the values of persistence and self-reliance it instilled. They learned horse training from the Blackfoot Indians, earning the nickname ‚ÄúHorse Whisperers‚Äù. It was also during this time that James began developing his skills as an artist, concentrating on outdoor scenes portraying men at work. This style, portraying the muscle of America, became the hallmark of his future success as an artist. In 1913 he moved to Chicago to study painting at the Art Institute of Chicago. There he became a friend of future illustrator J. Allen St. John. By 1915 he was studio assistant to his art teacher, Alexis Jean Fournier. Career James Allen began his over 30 year career as illustrator with the People‚Äôs Popular Monthly in 1913. In 1916 James E. Allen moved to Interlaken, New Jersey, living among other artists in the well-known Interlaken Colony near Asbury Park, New York. He was soon selling freelance illustrations to magazines and book publishers in nearby Philadelphia and New York City. By the end of his career, his work appeared in some 20 popular magazines such as American Boy, Blue Book (magazine), Collier's, Cosmopolitan, Good Housekeeping, Ladies' Home Journal, Nash‚Äôs and Pall Mall Magazine, The Red Cross Magazine, and Saturday Evening Post. As a staff artist for Doubleday, Page and Company, he illustrated a 17-volume edition of the works of Guy de Maupassant, and later works by Gopal Mukerji and Emma-Lindsay Squier. He also illustrated the popular Sinclair Dinosaur Book for the Sinclair Refining Company. In 1917 James and Elmer joined the United States Armed Forces and served with the American Expeditionary Forces in Germany where James became a 2nd Lieutenant and flier. In 1919 he resumed his career as a freelance illustrator. James married Grace Louise Parmele in Chicago on January 8, 1919. The newlyweds moved to Frasmere Avenue in Spring Lake, New Jersey, also near Asbury Park. From this location the artist commuted to New York City and Philadelphia to sell freelance illustrations to publishers in both cities. By 1924 his greater market was in NYC, so he rented an art studio at 939 Eighth Avenue, on West 56th Street. His studio was one block from the Art Students League, where he attended classes taught by Joseph Pennell. In May of 1925 he traveled to Paris where he shared a studio with Howard Cook. There he experimented with various artistic media, making lithographs and etchings for the first time. His first etching, Dragon Court, from 1925, is a depiction of the Parisian Cour du Dragon courtyard. Allen and Grace returned to New York City in November 1925 aboard the SS America, not, as asserted by some sources, due to the economic realities of the Great Depression some years later. He resumed work in commercial illustration and continued to hone his skills as a printmaker under Joseph Pennell and William Auerbach-Levy. It was during this period that he also studied with Arshile Gorky and Harvey Dunn at the Grand Central School of Art. While some sources claim a relationship with the Work Projects Administration (WPA), this appears not to be true. David W. Keihl writes \\"James E. Allen valued the worth of hard work and personal ingenuity for survival. He did not participate in the WPA programmes\\". In 1932, Allen first entered his prints in juried exhibitions and his work began to receive widespread academic and critical acclaim. That year his \\"The Builders\\" received both a Shaw Prize from New York‚Äôs Salmagundi Club and a Henry B. Shope Award from the Society of American Etchers, now known as the Society of American Graphic Artists (SAGA). A year later, ‚ÄúBrazilian Builders‚Äù took a Charles M. Lea Award at the Philadelphia Print Club Exhibition. Allen also began exhibiting his work in galleries during the 1930s, including at Kennedy and Company and the Grand Central Art Gallery. He later exhibited, became a member and acted as a juror for exhibitions at the Society of American Etchers. In 1934 Allen produced a series of six lithographs of dinosaurs for Sinclair Refining Company. He took for inspiration the dinosaurs displayed at the ‚ÄúA Century of Progress‚Äù World‚Äôs Fair, which had opened the previous year in Chicago, and the work of Charles R. Knight. Typical of his dedication, he undertook his own scientific studies under Br. Barnum Brown at the American Museum of Natural History to assure the accuracy of his subjects. That same year he illustrated the ‚ÄúSinclair Dinosaur Book‚Äù, followed by the ‚ÄúSinclair Dinosaur Stamp Album‚Äù in 1935. They were promotional items handed out at Sinclair Gas Stations. The latter resulted in giving away some 4 million albums. But it is for his images of industrial workers from the 1930s that Allen is best known. In scenes of steelworkers such as ‚ÄúThe Builders‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Connectors‚Äù, ‚ÄúSkyriders‚Äù and ‚ÄúUp Above the World‚Äù, he creates ‚Äúa vivid and suggestive picture of the powerful rhythm of daily labour and of the fearless readiness of the workers to perform their allotted tasks‚Äù. In 1937 he received a commission to create twelve lithographs for the United States Pipe and Foundry Company, showing laborers installing giant pipelines in varied settings. In 1938 the Graphic Arts Division of the Smithsonian's Museum of American History presented a solo exhibition of his work, further elevating his stature as a master printmaker. As one reviewer remarked: ‚Äúavoiding the present-day epidemic of social protest... these are graphic depictions of men at work, healthy, satisfied to build for tomorrow, proud in their strength and manual skill‚Äù. Allen turned from themes of industry to \\"more exciting\\" themes of war in the early 1940s, showing scenes of bombers, convoys, dirigibles, etc. but never strayed from his focus on the role people played. Scenes like \\"Parachutists\\", \\"Reserves\\", \\"Everybody's War\\", and ‚ÄúStowing the Jumbo‚Äù focus on personal struggle and labor that was characteristic of his prints before his war experience. Later years In 1943 Allen abandoned printmaking in order to study abstract painting with Hans Hofmann. In two series of paintings he experimented in a new dreamlike style depicting ‚Äúarabesques of figures flatly painted on a flat background with stylized suggestions of mountains.‚Äù In 1946 he became an art teacher of printmaking at the National Academy of Design in New York City. He retired from illustration in the 1950s but continued to exhibit his prints and paintings at fine art galleries. Tragically, he later developed a degenerative brain disease, diagnosed as Huntington's chorea,Diagnosis disclosed by Allen in a letter to Frank Rehn dated August 15, 1951. and one of the consequences of his illness was that he destroyed many of the preparatory sketches for the prints. James E. Allen died in Larchmont, New York, at the age of seventy on September 9, 1964. Works James E. Allen produced numerous prints (lithographs and engravings), many commissioned as advertising art. While there is no catalogue raisonn√©, a comprehensive exhibit in 1984 at the Mary Ryan Gallery in New York showed 91 of his prints. The catalog, and the corresponding \\"Ryan\\" numbering, has served a similar purpose. Significant collections of his prints can be found at the Smithsonian American Art Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Allen was a prolific painter who prepared most of his illustrations in oil. But the fate of the canvases are mostly unknown. An example can be found at the Kelly Collection of American Illustration Art. Sources * B√©n√©zit, Emmanuel. The Benezit Dictionary of Artists.

CMLL has on occasion used a different name for the end-of-year show, but Sin Piedad is the most commonly used name. All Sin Piedad shows have been held in Arena M√©xico in Mexico City, Mexico which is CMLL's main venue, its home base and main venue. The 2017 Sin Piedad was the second time such a show under that name was held on New Year's Day. Starting in 2011 through 2014 CMLL has been promoting a New Year's Day show with bigger, more prominent and promoted matches as part of the show although they did not specifically promote the shows under a special name, they were simply a special version of their weekly Saturday, Sunday, Tuesday and Wednesday shows that they hold in Arena Mexico on a regular basis. Starting in 2011 CMLL added at least one high-profile match to their shows, slowly building them into a special event. in 2011 the show featured the annual Reyes del Aire (\\"Kings of the Air\\") tournament, won by √Ångel de Oro. In 2012 the January 1 show saw Hombre Bala Jr. and Super Halc√≥n Jr. defeated the team known as Los Rayos Tapat√≠o in a Luchas de Apuestas, masks vs masks match in what turned out to be Los Rayos last match in CMLL. The main event of the 2012 was the finals of a tournament for the vacant CMLL World Heavyweight Championship which was El Terrible defeat Rush 17th heavyweight champion. The 2013 start of the year show was highlighted first by then CMLL World Welterweight Champion P√≥lvora successfully defending against Tit√°n and then the team of Boby Zavala and Disturbio defeated Leono and Tigre Blanco, forcing Leono and Blanco to have their hair shaved off as a result. The 2014 show, the last January 1 show without a specific title saw Super Halc√≥n Jr. win that year's La Copa Junior tournament. Late in the show Mephisto defeated Atlantis to retain the Mexican National Light Heavyweight Championship in the main event. CMLL did not hold a show on January 1, 2015 but returned to the tradition in 2016 with Sin Piedad (\\"No Mercy\\"), that was streamed live online and later broadcast as part of CMLL's weekly television. the 2016 Sin Piedad featured two Luchas de Apuestas matches. =Storylines= The event featured five professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre- existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

It is located at 41 George Street, Windsor, City of Hawkesbury, New South Wales, Australia. The original house was built from 1796 to 1815 and demolished 1920-21. It was also known as Commandant's House and Government House. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 4 February 2011.  History  Before any European settlement the Hawkesbury region was inhabited by the Dharug people. The riparian area along the Hawkesbury River had been a food source for the local Aboriginal people for over 50,000 years and, with relatively frequent floods that spread enriched alluvium throughout the surrounding land, the region was known to be an abundant and reliable resource for food.(LandArc, Draft Plan of Management, 2009; http://about.nsw.gov.au/view/suburb/Richmond) Following European settlement, the new colonists quickly recognised the agricultural potential of the banks of the Hawkesbury River. This led to intensive farming of the area to supply food to the developing colony that was experiencing severe shortages in the early years. However, following flooding in 1799, 1800, 1806 and 1809, life for the colonists farming the flats of the Hawkesbury River was a hard one, fraught with potential devastation with any inundation of the river. Following the opening of the Hawkesbury district for settlement, the road from Parramatta to Windsor was constructed in 1794. The farming area along the Hawkesbury River, including Green Hills (known as Windsor, from 1810) became the third urban satellite of the colony after Sydney and Parramatta. Windsor grew up as a military and service centre for the Hawkesbury flood-plain and was the location of the colony's richest agricultural land. The Commandant's Cottage, later the Government Cottage was one of a series of buildings constructed under the administration of Governor John Hunter between 1795 and 1800 for military and government purposes, including storehouses, and granaries and soldiers barracks. The location selected was sufficiently high to preclude danger of the building being affected by flood. It replaced a soldier's barracks constructed 1795 which Governor Hunter described in 1796 as a \\"miserable building\\".Hendy-Pooley, 1906: 16; Collins p394; Barkley-Jack, 2009:103-05 Its location would also enable a clear view of the area over which the Commandant had oversight. The Commandant's Cottage (later known as the Government Cottage) was under construction in 1796. David Collins described how in April of that year \\"a very excellent barrack was erecting for the use of the commandant, on a spot which had been selected sufficiently high to preclude any danger of the building being affected by a flood\\".Collins I 394 Collins' use of \\"barrack\\" to describe the Commandant's House has encouraged confusion with the separate barracks for the soldiers, already in existence by 1796, described as a \\"miserable building\\" which was replaced after October 1796 with more substantial accommodation for the troops.HRNSW Vol 3 p89 & Vol 4 p152 The Commandant's House was completed after October 1796 and was described in 1800 in Governor Hunter's list of buildings constructed since 1796 as \\"a framed and weatherboard house on the Green Hills...for the residence of the commanding officer of that district\\". The roof was shingled and the building furnished with a cellar, skilling kitchen and other accommodation with a paling fence.HRA Vol 2: p561 The new Commandant's House sat high on a grassy hill facing the principal street to the east. The south side of the house had an extensive view over the river and the valley and beyond to the Blue Mountains. To the west Richmond was visible until .Bertie, 1914: 26; Broadbent & Hughes, 1992: 12 The new building was on a plot of crown land which was by 1795 surrounded by settlers' grants. From June 1795 military commandants were in charge of the Hawkesbury settlement. Commandant Edward Abbott moved in to the cottage when it was completed late in 1796 and subsequent Commandants, Neil McKellar, Anthony Fenn Kemp and Thomas Hobby also lived there. Two significant lawsuits were associated with the Commandant's House. One case brought by the ex-convict John Harris against Fenn Kemp, when the Revd Samuel Marsden brought the two parties together at the House in an unsuccessful attempt at conciliation in 1798: this was the first lawsuit brought by an ex-convict against the military and was a critical stage in the victory of civil law. The other case, in 1799, concerned the murder of two Aboriginal youths, where the accused, Constable Edward Powell, claimed as part of his alibi that he was too tired to be involved, having that day come from Sydney and then spent some time at the Commandant's House.Barkley-Jack 2009: 363-372, 312-313 The land on which the new building now stood marked the end of a row of a series of promises of grants made by 1794. The land was enclosed in 1795 when a promise of grant was made to James Whitehouse. In 1800 Governor King appointed Charles Grimes, deputy surveyor, to be the first resident Hawkesbury magistrate. Grimes also had responsibility for other civic duties previously conducted by the military administrators, including that of superintendent of public works at Hawkesbury and it is believed that he lived at least some of the time in the government cottage. It was around this time that residents were required to assemble to attend musters (a type of census) on the front grounds of the cottageBarkley-Jack, 2009:103-05, 338-339 Governor Bligh noted that in 1806 the roof and foundations of the house had decayed and had become untenantable. A year later he had repaired the building and added two new rooms.HRA Vol 6:97; HRA Vol 9:170 It has been presumed that the cottage was used for either governor's visits or the government administrators from 1807 until 1810. The Commandant's House was used by Governor Hunter on his many visits to the Hawkesbury. This continued under Governor King, whose familiarity with the area was evident in his far-reaching and long-lasting definition of the river settlements, now hemmed in by the new common lands proclaimed by King in 1804. King's proclamation of three districts at Hawkesbury moreover paved the way for Macquarie's later siting of the towns. Already in 1800 King had ended the period of military residence in the cottage. Instead the House was occupied by the first resident Hawkesbury magistrate. Charles Grimes was appointed in July 1800 with responsibility for civic duties previously conducted by the military, including the superintendence of public works. It was around this time that residents were required to assemble for musters, a type of census, in the grounds of the cottage.Barkley-Jack, 2009: 103-105, 338-339 Lachlan Macquarie and his family arrived in Sydney in January 1810 to accept his commission as Governor of New South Wales. Macquarie's first year as governor was considered a success and set the tone and character for the twelve years of Macquarie's administration. He re-organised government departments and created a strong focus on the construction of quality public works using convict labour that transformed Sydney, Parramatta and the new townships and are still numerous in the twenty- first century.(ADB, Macquarie) During Macquarie's first tour of the outlying districts in November and December 1810 Macquarie arrived at Green Hills and viewed the cottage for the first time. He recorded the following in relation to the cottage and surrounds in his journals. > \\"At half past 5,O'Clock we arrived at the ferry on the left bank of the > river and at 6 O'Clock landed in the Government Garden on the Green Hills > and took possession of the Government House or, more properly speaking, > Government Cottage; most beautifully situated on the summit of a very fine > bank or terrace rising about fifty feet above the level of the river; of > which, and the adjacent Country, there is a very fine view from this sweet > delightful spot.....Mrs. M. and myself were quite delighted with the beauty > of this part of the Country; its great fertility, and its Picturesque > appearance; and especially with the well-chosen and remarkable fine scite > [sic] and situation of the Government Cottage and Garden on the Green Hills. > We dined soon after our arrival and after dinner our friend and family > physician Doctor Redfern took his departure for Sydney.Macquarie, 1 December > 1810 Macquarie used the cottage to celebrate with 21 guests the naming of the towns of Windsor, Richmond, Castlereagh, Pitt Town and Wilberforce on Thursday 6 December after he had confirmed their exact sites. This christening was marked by a drinking of a bumper to the success of each town after dinner. He also used it as the base for his expeditions to mark out the five towns. The town sites were marked out a little over a month after the naming of the towns. Castlereagh and Richmond were marked out on Thursday 10 January 1811 and Macquarie held a dinner at the Windsor house to celebrate. Wilberforce and Pitt-town were marked out the next day (Friday) and Windsor on Saturday 12 January.Macquarie, 6 December 1810 & 10-12 January 1811 He would continue to use the cottage as his residence and place of business during visits to the Hawkesbury throughout his governorship and he frequently issued government orders from the cottage. Macquarie also employed a live-in housekeeper, Ann Blady, a successful ex-convict with her own 50-acre grant, who had retired from practising midwifery in the area in 1810. Ann and her constable husband, William Blady, exemplify the connection that the citizens of Hawkesbury from many walks of life had with the Government Cottage. For Macquarie, as for Grose, Hunter, King and Bligh before him, the cottage was an informal official residence in addition to Government House in Sydney (First Government House) and Old Government House in Parramatta. The cottage was again repaired and improved under Macquarie. The painting by George William Evans of around 1809 shows only a western verandah, on the river-side, whereas Philip Slaeger's drawing and etching of 1812 or 1813 shows a substantial new southern verandah and the end of a new eastern verandah. Neatly furnished with chairs and tables from the workshops of the lumber yard, the expanded cottage became a significant part of the Government Domain at Windsor. The stables were located on the southern boundary of the property, near to what became Thompson Square under Macquarie, opposite the Government Stores. The gates to the garden and domain were located opposite the two-storey Macquarie Arms Hotel.Broadbent & Hughes, 1992:14 Governor Macquarie stated in his 1810‚Äì1822 report of building works during his administration of the colony that the cottage at Windsor had been repaired and much improved during his governorship. In addition a domain and garden consisting of six acres partly enclosed by a strong fence had been created, and a small coach house and stable erected for the use of the Governor and his staff.Hendy-Pooley, 1906: 16 A report into improvements to, and the state of public buildings by Standish Harris during the year 1823 ordered by Governor Brisbane described the Government Cottage as being \\"on a small scale, situated on a rising ground, commanding a beautiful view from the rear of the Hawkesbury River. It is a desirable scite (sic) for a good public building were it not so near the town - yet from its contiguity to the banks of this fine river with the diversity of richness of its soil, it might be made an enviable residence either as a villa or a mansion.\\" He noted a well, 3/4 constructed in stone sunk, rubbish removed, repair of brickwork and the addition of a room, the ceiling reformed in the dressing room, additional panes of glass the use of distemper paint in at least one room and the hall (the room was blue), the addition of 3 new doors, white washing of ceilings etc, oil painting of sashes and skirting boards, addition or new room of skirting boards, painting of architraves, mouldings, brick sewer added and works to the kitchen, including small oven. There is also mention of a small, badly contrived privy including sewer to river. The report also noted repairs to a garden house which appear to include a room and stables.(Harris, 1824, 53-54) Following Macquarie's departure the cottage was occupied by police magistrate Samuel North. It was granted to John McCall Junior by Crown Grant on 21 July 1854. It passed through several owners, including James Bourke until it was acquired by Michael Raper in April 1867. Raper retained the property until his death in 1911. The property was willed to his daughter Jane Wilkinson.Conveyance - James Burch, 1919 In 1916 the Australian Historical Society urged the Windsor Council to take steps to preserve the building that was fast falling into decay. They noted that the weatherboards, doors, windows and fittings were of cedar and that two different types of bricks had been used the building. The bricks and mortar and the plastering were considered well preserved given the local climate. By this time the large tree that once stood next to the building had been removed due to a large tree limb falling onto the house during a windstorm.Evening News, 1916 A plan from about this time notes a variety of materials used in the cottage, including lath and plaster walls, and brick nogging, plastered and weatherboard external walls. The cellar is not noted.RAHS, Jane Wilkinson and her husband sold the property to the James Drury Burch in 1919. It has remained with members of the Burch family until the 2000s when it was inherited by Mrs Burch's sisters. The purchase of the property by James Burch appears to have been the impetus for the demolition of what remained of the old cottage to be replaced by the existing cottage in the 1920s. The new cottage was named Green Hills and retains this name. Small changes have taken place since this time including the addition and removal of a variety of gardens and the addition of fencing. At some point a garage was added to the property. In the 1970s several alterations took place. Additionally, a weatherboard coach house with skillion roof located on a boundary was removed.Campbell, 2009 Little change has taken place in recent years. In 2010 the only visible physical reminder of the government cottage is the remainder of the panoramic view across the river recognised for its beauty by Macquarie and Harris and many of those who had the opportunity to gaze upon it. = Art and the Government Cottage = The government cottage has featured in the work of numerous artworks documenting the early development of Windsor. In particular it has been the apparent location for works depicting the opposite side of the riverbank. George Evans and (The Settlement of Green Hills) and -11. The Hawkesbury is well documented by Evans, also a notable artist, due primarily to him maintaining a property in the Hawkesbury district. An 1815 image looking across the river towards Cornwallis by Captain James Wallis was sketched with the help of a camera lucida from the grounds of the cottage. Philip Slaeger produced ' A View of a part of the Town of Windsor from across South Creek, in 1812 or 1813, with a fine detailed view of the cottage from the south-west. The famous flood panorama of 1816 by an unidentified artist was painted from the vicinity of the cottage. Joseph Lycett's 1824 \\"View of Windsor Upon the Hawkesbury from across South Creek\\", for the first time documented the various government buildings in the vicinity of the government cottage, although their distance in the image make individual buildings difficult to identify except on very close inspection. =Government Houses in south-east Australia= The term government house is generally associated in Australia with houses which were used officially as a governors or government representatives residences and places of work. These included larger sites such as Government House, Sydney and old Government House Parramatta, and smaller houses such as that located at East Maitland. In addition, the term also refers to the homes of the commanding officer of military detachments located at penal establishments or distant settlements of the commandant of penal establishments or distant establishments. There are seven penal establishments known to have had Government Houses - Newcastle, Sarah Island at Macquarie Harbour, Port Macquarie (Port Macquarie Government House Site), Moreton Bay (Queensland), Maria Island (Tasmania), Norfolk Island and Port Arthur, Tasmania. Most of the government Houses were established in the 1820s, the exception being Newcastle whose Government House was likely to be earlier, reflecting the site's earlier establishment.Annable et.al, 2003:86-92A government House was constructed at the settlement of Bathurst west of the Blue Mountains .  Description  The residential site is located on a ridge overlooking the Hawkesbury River and is located in an important position in relation to Thompson Square and the North Street precincts. It is part of the George Street North precinct, contributing to the character of the street. Set back from the curve of George Street, aspects of the once commanding view over the area are now limited by more recent building and the growth of trees, but are still evident. The most significant view is across the river towards Freemans Reach, including the bridge over the Hawkesbury River at Windsor, the oldest extant crossing of the Hawkesbury River and one of only two bridge crossings of the Hawkesbury River in the Hawkesbury area. Other views include down Arndell Street in an easterly direction overlooking part of the 1794 farm grants, the very beginning of the district, still legible in the landscape. The site is divided into two portions. The upper portion of the site is level and grassy with gardens and remnant gardens and a residence. Some areas of grass show signs of previous disturbance, although it is unclear whether these relate to the earlier building on the site or more recent garden works. A modern, tubular palisade fence creates a division between the level and sloped areas of the site. A single garage is located on the north east corner of the flat section of the site and accessed via an informal driveway. The front of the property is not fenced although a small retaining wall provides some assistance in maintaining the level character of the front portion of the site. The curve of George Street at this point still reflects the original bend in the road past the Government cottage before 1810. The single storey bungalow style house is located at the front of the site. It has rendered masonry walls and a corrugated iron roof. Decorative glass windows are evident. An open verandah is located on the southeast and south west sides of the house. An additional verandah on the north east side of the house has been infilled to create additional internal space. The rear of the site slopes steeply towards the river and contains a significant number of trees that have begun to encroach on the view. This bank alignment is recognisably the same as that shown in all the early nineteenth-century images before, during and immediately after Macquarie's governorship. A stone plinth with plaque is located at the front boundary of the property describing the sites history as the location of the former government cottage As at 14 January 2010, there has been no archaeological testing of the site and there has been no significant excavation for works such as pools or basement car parks. The existing building is smaller than the former cottage and its 1920s type and date of construction suggest that archaeological evidence of the previous building is likely to remain. The outbuilding was located on or near the existing driveway, a development which is unlikely to have disturbed any underground deposits. The original basement/cellar is thought likely to have been filled in, possibly with materials from the old cottage and, therefore, potentially in situ. Archaeological deposits have been preserved under more modern buildings in the area generally and therefore it is considered highly possible that archaeological evidence survives despite no formal archaeological assessment. = Modifications and dates = * 1806-07 - roof and floor repaired and two rooms added by Bligh * -1815 - repairs and improvements made to the cottage * -21 - building demolished * early 1920s - existing building constructed on site  Heritage listing  The site and its views have outstanding state significance as evidence of the earliest development of the Hawkesbury district, its initial role as the Commandant's cottage quickly establishing its symbolism as an important representation of the presence of government and military control in the district. The high potential of existing archaeological features and deposits in a site where key elements in shaping the development of the district have converged - the arrival of the man who shaped the development of the district (Macquarie), the presence of the cottage on a site which captured Macquarie's aesthetic interest and the role of the cottage in trips to name and mark out the five Macquarie Towns - creating a landmark site in the historical development of the site representative of the birth of the Hawkesbury district as it is understood today. It is likely to be the site of one of the earliest Government Cottages constructed outside the Sydney colony. Government Cottage Archaeological Site was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 4 February 2011 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The site has state significance as the base for Governor Macquarie's travels and activities in and around the Hawkesbury District, in particular while he marked out the sites of the five Macquarie towns, Windsor, Richmond, Wilberforce, Castlereagh and Pitt Town. It has state significance as the location of one of the earliest government buildings established at Windsor as well as one of a series of buildings constructed to house members of the military establishment in the locality. The location has particular significance as a physical representation of the civil control established at the Hawkesbury settlement between 1795‚Äì1796 and and thus, the centre of government for the settlement. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The site has particular associations as the location of an early building in the colony outside Sydney constructed as part of the military establishment at Green Hills (later Windsor) under the administration of Governor Hunter 1796. It is closely associated with all the later eighteenth-century military administrators of the Hawkesbury, Commandants Abbott, McKellar, Fenn Kemp and Hobby, and with the governors Hunter, King, Bligh and, especially, Macquarie. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The site has state significance for its views from the ridge above the Hawkesbury River to the river and the floodplains beyond in the direction of Cornwallis and Freeman's Reach, notable as early as 1810. The views provide a context for understanding of the site of the cottage as the commandant's house, located in a commanding position for surveillance of the infant third settlement, and the responses it provoked in visitors regarding its beauty. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The surviving archaeological deposits and features have state significance as evidence of one of the earliest eighteenth-century buildings in the colony outside of Sydney, and one of the first permanent public buildings constructed at the third Sydney settlement, Windsor. The remains have the potential to demonstrate the manner in which the building was added to and adapted to suit its changing roles The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The archaeological site is likely to include elements of one of the earliest government cottages constructed outside of Sydney in the colony and one of a few whose main purpose for construction was not to house a Commandant in charge of overseeing convicts specifically.

A set of triangles is considered a configuration when all of the triangles share a minimum of one incidence relation with one of the other triangles present in the set. An incidence relation between triangles refers to when two triangles share a point. For example, the two triangles to the right, AHC and BHC, are a configuration made up of two incident relations, since points Cand Hare shared. The triangles that make up configurations are known as component triangles. Triangles must not only be a part of a configuration set to be in a similarity system, but must also be directly similar. Direct similarity implies that all angles are equal between two given triangle and that they share the same rotational sense. As is seen in the adjacent images, in the directly similar triangles, the rotation of B onto C and B^1 onto C^1occurs in the same direction. In the opposite similar triangles, the rotation of B onto C and B^1onto C^1occurs in the opposite direction. In sum, a configuration is a similarity system when all triangles in the set, lie in the same plane and the following holds true: if there are n triangles in the set and n ‚àí 1 triangles are directly similar, then n triangles are directly similar.  Background  J.G. Mauldon introduced the idea of similarity systems of triangles in his paper in _Mathematics Magazine_ \\"Similar Triangles\\". Mauldon began his analyses by examining given triangles ABC, XYZ for direct similarity through complex numbers, specifically the equation \\\\begin{vmatrix} a & b & c \\\\\\\\\\\\ x & y & z \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 1 & 1 \\\\end{vmatrix} = 0. He then furthered his analyses to equilateral triangles, showing that if a triangle ABC satisfied the equation a + wb + w^2c =0 when w = \\\\frac{-1 + i\\\\surd3}{2}, it was equilateral. As evidence of this work, he applied his conjectures on direct similarity and equilateral triangles in proving Napoleon's theorem. He then built off Napoleon by proving that if an equilateral triangle was constructed with equilateral triangles incident on each vertex, the midpoints of the connecting lines between the non-incident vertices of the outer three equilateral triangles create an equilateral triangle. Other similar work was done by the French Geometer Th√©bault in his proof that given a parallelogram and squares that lie on each side of the parallelogram, the centers of the squares create a square. Mauldon then analyzed coplanar sets of triangles, determining if they were similarity systems based on the criterion, if all but one of the triangles were directly similar, then all of the triangles are directly similar.  Examples  = Triangles appended to a rectangle =  Direct similarity  If we construct a rectangle ABCD with directly similar triangles PAB, QBC, RCD, SDA on each side of the rectangle that are similar to PQS, then RQS is directly similar and the set of triangles \\\\\\\\{PAB, QBC, RCD, SDA, PQS, RQS\\\\\\\\} is a similarity system.  Indirect similarity  However, if we acknowledge that the triangles can be degenerate and take points B and P to lie on each other and Q, R, Dand S to lie on each other, then the set of triangles is no longer a direct similarity system since the second triangle has area and the others do not. = Rectangular parallelepiped = Given a figure where three sets of lines are parallel, but not equivalent in length (formally known as a rectangular parallelepiped) with all points of order two being labelled as follows: : \\\\\\\\{A_1B_1C_1, A_2B_2C_2, A_3B_3C_3, A_4B_4C_4, A_1B_4C_3, A_2B_3C_4, A_3B_2C_1, A_4B_1C_2\\\\\\\\} Then we can take the above points, analyze them as triangles and we can show that they form a similarity system. Proof: In order for any given triangle, KLM, to be directly similar to A_1, B_1, C_1the following equation should be satisfied: : (\\\\ell-m)a_1+ (m-k)b_1+(k-1)c_1=0. where ‚Ñì, m, k, a1, b1, and c1 are sides of triangles. If the same pattern is followed for the rest of the triangles, one will notice that the summation of the equations for the first four triangles and the summation of the equations for the last four triangles provides the same result. Therefore, by the definition of a similarity system of triangles, no matter the seven similar triangles selected, the eighth will satisfy the system, making them all directly similar.

It is also known as the Royal Hotel. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The lower Hawkesbury was home to the Dharug people prior to European colonisation. The proximity to the Nepean River and South Creek qualifies it as a key area for food resources for indigenous groups. The Dharug and Darkinjung people called the river Deerubbin and it was a vital source of food and transport. Governor Arthur Phillip explored the local area in search of suitable agricultural land in 1789 and discovered and named the Hawkesbury River after Baron Hawkesbury. This region played a significant role in the early development of the colony with European settlers established here by 1794. Situated on fertile floodplains and well known for its abundant agriculture, Green Hills (as it was originally called) supported the colony through desperate times. However, frequent flooding meant that the farmers along the riverbanks were often ruined. In 1794, a broader area in modern-day Windsor including the hotel site was first alienated for European purposes in a grant made by Francis Grose of thirty acres to Samuel Wilcox, who named it Wilcox Farm. It is likely that land clearance and agricultural activities as well as some building works took place during this period and during the subsequent of occupation. It was incorporated into a larger holding of 1500 acres known as Peninsula Farm in the early nineteenth century. On 1 January 1810, Governor Lachlan Macquarie replaced Governor Bligh. Under Macquarie's influence the colony prospered. His vision was for a free community for white colonists, working in conjunction with the penal colony. He implemented an unrivalled public works program, completing 265 public buildings, establishing new public amenities and improving existing services such as roads. Under his leadership Hawkesbury district thrived. He visited the district on his first tour and recorded in his journal on 6/12/1810: \\"After dinner I chrestened the new townships...I gave the name of Windsor to the town intended to be erected in the district of the Green Hills...the township in the Richmond district I have named Richmond...\\" the district reminded Macquarie of those towns in England, whilst Castlereagh, Pitt Town and Wilberforce were named after English statesmen. These are often referred to as Macquarie's Five Towns. Their localities, chiefly Windsor and Richmond, became more permanent with streets, town square and public buildings. Macquarie also appointed local men in positions of authority. In 1810 a group of settlers sent a letter to him congratulating him on his leadership and improvements. It was published in the Sydney Gazette with his reply. He was \\"much pleased with the sentiments\\" of the letter and assured them that the Hawkesbury would \\"always be an object of the greatest interest\\" to him. In marking out the towns of Windsor and Richmond in 1810, Governor Macquarie was acting on instructions from London. All of the Governors who held office between 1789 and 1822, from Phillip to Brisbane, received the same Letter of Instruction regarding the disposal of the \\"waste lands of the Crown\\" that Britain claimed as her own. This included directives for the formation of towns and thus the extension of British civilisation to its Antipodean outpost. On 15 July 1815, the Sydney Gazette carried the following public notice: > \\"A large and commodious House having been some time since erected, and > lately completed, at a very considerable expense, in the Town of Windsor, > for an Inn; and a suitable person having been engaged by the Proprietor for > keeping the same, Notice is hereby given, that the said Inn, called \\"The > Macquarie Arms\\", and kept by Thomas Ranson, who formerly was an Innkeeper in > England, will be opened for the accommodation of the Public on Monday the > 31st of this present Month of July\\". The hotel was opened two weeks later by Governor Macquarie. The hotel, also known as the Royal Hotel, was envisioned by Governor Macquarie following his tour of the district in 1811. Governor Macquarie wrote about the event in his diary:- > \\"I gave Mr. Fitzgerald a large allotment in the square on the express > condition of his building immediately thereon a handsome commodious inn of > brick or stone and to be at least two stories high..\\". Richard Fitzgerald, who built the Macquarie Arms Inn, had arrived in New South Wales in 1791 as a convict, as had Andrew Thompson, whose name is remembered in Thompson Square. In 1800 Governor Hunter made Fitzgerald superintendent of Agriculture in Toongabbie. He had proved himself a good farmer in the cultivation of his 1794 grant of 190 acres. Richard Fitzgerald and his family lived in a house alongside the Macquarie Arms Hotel in George Street, Windsor. The hotel was occupied in the late 1830s by army officers stationed at Windsor and it became known as the Mess House and referred to as such in Armstrong's map of the town (1842). From 1872 to 1900 it was once again run as a hotel by the Bushell family. It continues to be run as a hotel to the present day. Its central position in Windsor and its early date and interesting associations make The Macquarie Arms a colonial building of some importance.  Description  The hotel is a building of generous proportions, with sandstock brick walls, stuccoed over and painted white. It has two large Georgian doorways with semi-circular traceried fanlights and sidelights, but the glass in the one facing George Street has unfortunately been painted over. The one opening onto Thompson Square can still be seen in its original state. The hotel retains its well designed cedar joinery, its cedar circular staircase, its extensive stone flagged cellars, its turned wooden verandah columns, and its stone flagging. The early character of the architecture of the building was somewhat belied around the 1930s by the addition of box-like protuberances to the corners of the building. The upstairs verandah has also been added and some upstairs windows replaced by French doors. Most of the attic windows in the roof were also added then. Despite the alterations, the building still possesses a great deal of its former atmosphere. The hotel is located in the Thompson Square Conservation Area.  Heritage listing  Opened in 1815 and constructed by emancipist Richard Fitzgerald in response to specific directions from Governor Macquarie, the Macquarie Arms Hotel is of exceptional significance as the most sophisticated and most intact major commercial building dating to the pre-1820 colonial period of Australia's history. Playing a pivotal role in Macquarie's town plan for Windsor, the Macquarie Arms Hotel is the most substantial building to form part of Thompson Square, the best Georgian town square on mainland Australia. The building contains numerous rare and aesthetically superior elements, and continues to be widely recognised for its importance to the understanding of settlement, urban design, and architecture during the colonial period, while its historic associations carry strong cultural messages of the period's society and government. It has been long established by art and architectural historians, and has a prominent place in the contemporary social life of Windsor. Macquarie Arms Hotel was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The Macquarie Arms Hotel is closely associated with a number of significant social and political figures in the Hawkesbury District during the period of its early development. The building of the hotel was an express condition by Governor Macquarie of his grant of a large allotment of land to Richard Fitzgerald. The hotel was built to specific requirements made by Governor Macquarie that the inn be handsome, commodious, of brick or stone and to be at least two stories high. The allotment of land - and subsequently the situation of the hotel - was in Thompson Square, named by Governor Macquarie in honour of Andrew Thompson Esqr, Justice of the Peace and Principal Magistrate of the district, and reputed as the father or founder of Green Hills. Andrew Thompson had arrived in NSW as a convict. Richard Fitzgerald, who promptly built the hotel in accordance with Governor Macquarie's specifications, had arrived as a convict in New South Wales in 1791. By 1800 Fitzgerald had been appointed by Governor Hunter as superintendent of agriculture in Toongabbie, and in 1810 Governor Macquarie appointed him Government Storekeeper. Fitzgerald appears to have retired from public office in the 1820s. The 1828 census lists him as the possessor of 2000 acres of land, and in conjunction with his farming pursuits, he remained active in local affairs and was elected president of the Hawkesbury Benevolent Society which managed the hospital at Windsor. Richard Fitzgerald and his family lived in a house alongside the Macquarie Arms in George Street, Windsor. His son, Robert, married Elizabeth Rouse of Rouse Hill in 1841, and in 1843 stood for the first partly elected parliament in New South Wales against William Bowman of Richmond.

The tournament is based on the Lucha Libre Parejas Incre√≠bles match concept, which pairs two wrestlers of opposite allegiance, one portraying a villain, referred to as a \\"rudo\\" in Lucha Libre wrestling terminology, and one portraying a fan favorites, or \\"t√©cnico\\". The 2017 version of the tournament was the eight time in a row that CMLL held the tournament since the first tournament in 2010. The winners are presented with a trophy but not given any other tangible reward for the victory. Sixteen teams competed in the three night tournament, with Volador Jr. and B√°rbaro Cavernario winning Block A held on February 10, 2017, and the team of √öltimo Guerrero and Valiente winning Block B a week later on February 17, 2017. Finally Volador Jr. and B√°rbaro Cavernario won the finals on February 24, 2017 to take the entire tournament. It was B√°rbaro Cavernario's first Torneo Nacional de Parejas Incre√≠bles victory while Volador Jr. previously won the 2013 tournament with La Sombra. History Volador Jr., the tecnico winner of the 2017 tournament. The Mexican professional wrestling promotion Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL; \\"World Wrestling Council\\") held their first Torneo Nacional de Parejas Incre√≠bles (\\"National Incredible Pairs Tournament\\") in 2010, from January 22 through February 5, marking the beginning of an annual tournament. CMLL has previous held Parejas Incre√≠bles tournaments on an irregular basis and often promoted individual Parejas Incre√≠bles and Relevos Incre√≠bles (\\"Incredible Relay\\", with teams of three or more wrestlers). The Parejas Incre√≠bles concept is a long-standing tradition in lucha libre and is at times referred to as a \\"strange bedfellows\\" match in English speaking countries, because a Pareja Increible consists of a face (referred to as a t√©cnico in Lucha Libre, or a \\"good guy\\") and a heel (a rudo, those that portray \\"the bad guys\\") teamed up for a specific match, or in this case for a tournament. The 2017 tournament will be the eight annual Parejas Incre√≠bles tournament, and like its predecessors will be part of CMLL's regular Friday night CMLL Super Viernes (\\"Super Friday\\") shows to be held in Arena M√©xico, CMLL's main venue in Mexico City, Mexico. Tournament The tournament featured 15 professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers teaming up, some of whom were involved in pre-existing scripted feuds or storylines while others were simply paired up for the tournament. For the Torneo Nacional de Parejas Incre√≠bles tournaments, CMLL often teamed up a t√©cnico (those that portray the \\"good guys\\" in wrestling, also known as faces) and a rudo (the \\"bad guy\\" or heels) who are involved in a pre-existing storyline feud at the time of the tournament so that the tournament itself can be used as a storytelling device to help tell the story of escalating confrontations between two feuding wrestlers. The tournament format followed CMLL's traditional tournament formats, with two qualifying blocks of eight teams that competed during the first and second week of the tournament and a final match between the two block winners. The qualifying blocks were all one- fall matches while the tournament final was a best two-out-of-three-falls tag team match. =Tournament participants= B√°rbaro Cavernario, the rudo winner of the 2017 tournament. ;Block A *√Ångel de Oro and Rey Bucanero *Blue Panther and Tiger *Car√≠stico and Mephisto *Marco Corleone and Kr√°neo *M√°ximo Sexy and M√°scara A√±o 2000 *Diamante Azul and Pierroth *Rey Cometa and Puma *Volador Jr. and B√°rbaro Cavernario ;Block B *Atlantis and Euforia *Dragon Lee and La M√°scara *Guerrero Maya Jr. and Drag√≥n Rojo Jr. *M√≠stico and Negro Casas *Stuka Jr. and Hechicero *Tit√°n and Ripper *Rush and El Terrible *Valiente and √öltimo Guerrero =Ongoing storylines= One of the main CMLL feuds at the time of the 2017 Parejas Increibles tournament was the ongoing rivalry between Diamante Azul and Pierroth, a feud that at the time of the tournament was expected to be the main event of the 2017 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas (\\"Homage to two legends\\") show. The feud often saw Pierroth, with help from his Los Ingobernables partners Rush and La M√°scara, leave Diamante Azul beaten up and with his mask either torn or completely removed during matches. While Atlantis and Euforia were not directly involved in a feud the team had some history prior to the 2017 tournament. Originally Atlantis was part of Los Guerreros del Infierno, which also included EUforia. He would later leave the team, turning tecnico to feud with √öltimo Guerrero, the leader of Los Guerreros. Atlantis teamed with Euforia to win the 2014 tournament. While some of the teams were put together because of ongoing storylines others were teamed up based on previous feuds. The team of Rey Cometa and Puma, played off a storyline rivalry between the two from 2012. During the fall of 2012 the two masked mid-card wrestlers developed a rivalry that led to both wrestlers putting their mask on the line as part of CMLL's 79th Anniversary Show. Rey Cometa was defeated by Puma and thus had to take off his mask and reveal his birth name. Following the mask loss Rey Cometa and Puma moved off in different directions, only crossing path on occasions. Another dormant story-line was the feud between Dragon Lee and La M√°scara that carried the main event match of the CMLL 83rd Anniversary Show, which saw Dragon Lee defeating and unmasking La M√°scara at the end of the night. Following the match La M√°scara and Dragon Lee's brother Rush, reformed Los Ingobernables and actually attacked Dragon Lee. The team of Rush and El Terrible had teamed together in two previous Parejas Increibles tournaments, both as part of a long, heated storyline feud between the two that ran from 2011 through 2012. The storyline saw El Terrible defeat Rush to win the vacant CMLL World Heavyweight Championship, The two were teamed up for the 2012 Torneo Nacional de Parejas Increibles as CMLL continued to build the feud. The two were able to work together well enough to make it to the finals of the tournament but lost to Atlantis and Euforia in the finals when they were unable to get along. After the loss Rush made a Lucha de Apuestas challenge to El Terrible. The storyline culminated on September 14 in the main event of CMLL's 79th Anniversary Show, where El Terrible lost and as a result, shaved bald. In March, 2013 El Terrible and Rush teamed up for the 2013 Torneo de Parejas Increibles like they had for the 2012 tournament, but the team lost in the first round to Drag√≥n Rojo, Jr. and Niebla Roja. =Tournament brackets= Aftermath The rivalry between Pierroth and Diamante Azul reached its peak only a few weeks later as the two faced off in a Lucha de Apuestas', or \\"bet match\\" on March 17, 2017 in the main event of the 2017 Homenaje a Dos Leyendas show. Diamante Azul won the match and forced Pierroth to unmask afterwards per lucha libre traditions.

It stars Steve Carell, Chris Cooper, Mackenzie Davis, Topher Grace, Natasha Lyonne, and Rose Byrne. The film follows a Democratic strategist who tries to help a local candidate win an election in a small right-wing town. Initially set for a theatrical release in May 2020, the film was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, and then released on Premium VOD and selected theaters on June 26, 2020, by Focus Features. It received mixed reviews from critics, who called it \\"a soft political satire\\". Plot Successful Democratic Party campaign consultant Gary Zimmer is in despair due to the results of the 2016 presidential election. Gary is shown a viral video of Marine Colonel Jack Hastings giving a speech standing up for the undocumented immigrant population living in his hometown of Deerlaken, Wisconsin. Deciding that if he can run Hastings as the Democratic mayoral candidate in the next election, he can convince the American people in the heartland to vote Democrat in the next presidential election, Zimmer travels to Deerlaken to persuade Hastings to run against his town's incumbent mayor. Arriving in Deerlaken, Gary experiences the vast cultural divide between his home of Washington, D.C. and the townspeople's more rural mannerisms. Gary soon meets Hastings and his daughter Diana and pitches his idea. Hastings initially declines, considering himself more of a conservative and having no real interest in politics, but later relents and agrees to run under the condition that Gary runs his campaign. Hastings recruits his friends and neighbors as volunteers for the campaign. However, setbacks soon arise including the fact that most of the town is conservative and the fact that the incumbent Mayor Braun is being funded by the Republican National Committee. The RNC also sends down Faith Brewster, Gary's nemesis, to counter Gary. As the race heats up, Gary takes Hastings to New York City so they can recruit fundraisers for the campaign to match Faith's money and reinforcements. Hastings gives a powerful speech to the possible donors about how he needs their help for his small town, which inspires Gary. Their donations allow Gary to upgrade their campaigning methods. Soon the election polls show Hastings and Braun neck and neck, although the Hastings‚Äô campaign takes a dive when one of Gary's team members advertises a pro-contraceptive platform to a group of single women who turn out to be nuns. When Gary starts berating his teammates, Diana convinces him to apologize and that if he is going to run her father's campaign, he needs to be nice. When it starts to look like Faith and Braun are going to win, Gary tries to convince Hastings and Diana to play dirty and start exploiting Braun's skeletons. Diana is horrified that Gary would play dirty and goes to Braun for advice. Braun and Diana decide to secretly reveal a bigger scandal about Braun so Gary will not go after Braun's brother, which was his original plan. The scandal, however, proves to be false. On Election Day, no one votes, which confuses both Gary and Faith. It is revealed that the election was actually a setup. Diana shot the video of her father's immigration speech so that Gary and Faith would pour thousands of dollars into the election, which would help the town through its financial trouble due to the recent closure of the military base. Gary is shocked that Diana would play him and Diana then counters him by explaining the town set this up because D.C. politicians play small towns like theirs all the time. When Gary reveals that he was hoping that there was a spark between them, Diana rejects him.

Production began in April 2019 In Atlanta, Georgia. Release The film was released digitally in the United States through Premium VOD, as well as in selected theaters on June 26, 2020. It was originally scheduled for a wide theatrical release on May 29, 2020, but due to movie theater closures that started in mid-March because of the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, it was cancelled. The film made an estimated $100,000 from 238 theaters in its domestic opening weekend. It was released in France on July 1, 2020, where it grossed $52,673 from 117 theaters.  Reception = VOD sales = In its debut weekend, Irresistible was the top-rented film on the iTunes Store and fourth on FandangoNow (although since the service reports totals by the week it was likely first over the three-day frame). In its second weekend the film fell to fourth iTunes and fifth on FandangoNow, but ranked first on Spectrum's weekly chart, then placed sixth on Fandango and 10th on Spectrum the week after that. = Critical response = On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 40% based on 210 reviews, with an average rating of 5.26/10. The site's critics consensus reads, \\"A soft political satire that proves frustratingly less than the sum of its talented parts, Irresistible is anything but.\\" At Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 47 out of 100, based on 49 critics, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews.\\" Owen Gleiberman of Variety said that \\"Irresistible scores points yet feels behind the curve. You wish it were a bold satirical bulletin, or maybe just Stewart's pricelessly amusing version of a Christopher Guest movie. Instead, the film is a lot like a politician: It makes a big show of leading the viewer, but without rocking the boat.\\" David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a \\"C\\" and, although praising Byrne's performance, wrote: \\"A Capra-esque moral comedy that unfolds with all the subtlety of sky writing and none of the same panache, Irresistible is a perverse bid for clarity that feels like it was left behind like a relic from some long-distant past.\\" The San Francisco Chronicles G. Allen Johnson said Stewart created \\"perhaps the most lamebrain, ham-fisted and insulting movie of the year\\" and that the film is \\"unfunny on top of taking wide swings, which miss, at both rural Midwesterners and East Coast elites\\".Johnson, G. Allen. Review: ‚ÄòIrresistible,‚Äô Jon Stewart‚Äôs political comedy, is one of the most insulting movies of the year, San Francisco Chronicle, June 23, 2020. Retrieved June 30, 2020. On the other hand, Mark Kermode gave a fairly positive review of the film in The Guardian, comparing it to Wag the Dog and Local Hero, saying: \\"there's something reassuringly nostalgic about Irresistible... Stewart is back on home ground, opening with a TV show-style segment about the falsehoods of the 'spin room' ('I look forward to lying to you in the future') that we now take for granted.\\"Kermode, Mark Irresistible review ‚Äì subtle satire from Jon Stewart, The Guardian, June 28, 2020.

He helped to translate the earliest parts of the Eliot Indian Bible, the first Bible published in America. In 1637 Cockenoe was captured during the Pequot War by a Massachusetts militia unit. After being captured and brought back to Massachusetts, Cockenoe became a servant to Richard Callicot, a fur trader, in Dorchester, Massachusetts. John Sassamon, a prominent Native American translator, also grew up as a servant in Callicot's household in Dorchester. Similarly, Cockenoe became an early American translator and interpreter, and one of the first people who mastered English and several Algonquian languages, including the Massachusett language. Cockenoe helped translate the Eliot Indian Bible, the first Bible printed in America. John Eliot stated that Cockenoe assisted Eliot in translating \\"the Commandments, the Lords Prayer, and many Texts of Scripture: also I compiled both exhortations and prayers by his help.\\" At some point between 1646 and 1649, shortly after Eliot began preaching, Cockenoe returned to the Long Island area where he served as an interpreter for many land transactions between local tribes and colonists.

Daniel is recognized in the cancer biology field for the discovery and naming of the gene Kaiso, and is the recipient of several prestigious awards in recognition of her research and leadership, including an Ontario Premier Research Excellence Award and a Vice- Chancellor Award from the University of the West Indies.  Education and career  In 1987, Daniel completed a Bachelor's degree in life sciences at Queen's University, and then a PhD in microbiology at the University of British Columbia in 1993. Daniel completed post-doctoral research fellowships for three years at St. Jude Children‚Äôs Research Hospital, and then followed her supervisor's move to Vanderbilt University, in Memphis, Tennessee, where she stayed for another three years. During her fellowship, Daniel discovered the gene Kaiso, and named it after calypso (a popular form of Caribbean music). Daniel found that Kaiso transcriptionally regulates genes involved in cell proliferation and cell adhesion. Following her post-doctoral fellowship, Daniel joined McMaster University's Department of Biology in November 1999, where she is now a full professor. Daniel's lab studies triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), specifically to identify genetic risk factors which may explain the prevalence and high mortality associated with TNBC in women of African ancestry. In 2017, Daniel's lab demonstrated that Kaiso plays a role in the proliferation and survival of TNBC cells. Daniel's research has been cited over 4,000 times and she has an h-index of 26. She has been recognized for her research and mentorship by multiple awards, including a Vice-Chancellor Award from the University of the West Indies. She has received funding from both national and international agencies, including CIHR, NSERC and the US CDMRP (Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs) Breast Cancer IDEA Awards. Daniel mentors students through the African Caribbean Association at McMaster University, as well as youth belonging to the African Caribbean community of Hamilton. She co-founded the Canadian Multicultural LEAD Organization for Mentoring & Training.  Personal life  Daniel was diagnosed with breast cancer in March 2009. Following years of treatment (involving a mastectomy, tamoxifen treatment and reconstruction surgery), Daniel is now healthy.

As a microRNA, it regulates gene expression through targeting mRNAs. Additionally, miR-324-5p it is both an intracellular miRNA, meaning it is commonly found within the microenvironment of the cell, and one of several circulating miRNAs found throughout the body. Its presence throughout the body both within and external to cells may contribute to miR-324-5p's wide array of functions and role in numerous disease pathologies ‚Äì especially cancer ‚Äì in various organ systems. History miR-324-5p first appeared in literature in a paper published by John Kim et. al. in early 2004 that identified 32 entirely new miRNAs from cultured rat cortical neurons using miRNA cloning and RNA analysis. The miRNA quickly gained traction in scientific literature, appearing in articles about the evolutionary conservation of microRNAs, HIV, cancer, and other topics within a few years. Today, the functions and roles of miR-324-5p are still not yet fully characterized. Structure and targets miR-324-5p is a reverse strand miRNA, meaning it is produced from the 5' end of the associated RNA, and spans from position 7,223,342 to 7,223,364 on chromosome 17. Its sequence is CGCAUCCCCUAGGGCAUUGGUG. miRNA forms following cleavage of pre-miRNA at the hairpin loop by the enzyme dicer within the cytosol. Interestingly, both strands of miR-324's pre-miRNA hairpin loop structure, miR-324-5p and miR-324-3p, become active miRNAs with distinct targets and functions. miR-324-5p has between 166 and 469 predicted targets, including regulators of cell growth, proliferation, survival, cytoskeletal structure, ATP transport, and ion channels. Though miR-324-5p is found on chromosome 17, its targets span across all chromosomes. Functions =Cell growth and survival= miR-324-5p likely regulates cell growth and survival through interaction with multiple pathways. Published research demonstrates that this miRNA interacts with the Hedgehog (HH) signaling pathway via interactions with HH transcription factor Gli1 and HH protein receptor Smo, often contributing to tumorigenesis. miR-324-5p's activating interaction with the protein NfkB also regulates numerous components of cell survival, including cell cycle control, enzyme synthesis, and cell adhesion. In addition, miR-324-5p regulates components of the MAPK pathway, influencing cell growth, proliferation, and survival. Specifically, miR-324-5p downregulates RAF and ERK and is necessary for normal levels of cell growth. Reduced expression leads to increased cell growth and proliferation, and overexpression limits growth, leading to its role in oncogenesis. miRNA-324-5p targets multiple oncogenes, contributing to both tumorigenesis and tumor suppression in different cancers. =Cancer= Both up and downregulation of miR-324-5p is shown to contribute to various types of cancer. miR-324-5p plays a role in inflammation and tumorigenesis in colorectal cancer through regulation of CUEDC2, which regulates inflammation via interaction with NF-kB signaling. miR-324-5p can inhibit glioma proliferation, suppress hepatocellular carcinoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell invasion, and regulate growth and pathology in multiple myeloma. Additionally, chromosome 17 deletions, which include deletion of miR-324-5p, are present in 10% of multiple myeloma patients and are associated with poorer prognosis. In contrast, overexpression of miR-324-5p in gastric cancer cells reduces cell death and promotes growth and proliferation. miR-324-5p has also been shown to reduce the viability of gastric cancer cells via downregulation of TSPAN8, and miR-324-5p expression increased apoptosis in these same gastric cancer cells. =Epilepsy= Seizures are characterized by high levels of synchronized neuronal activity. One important regulator of neuronal activity is the hyperpolarizing A-type current mediated by potassium channel KV4.2. miR-324-5p downregulates KV4.2, exacerbating conditions that lead to seizure onset, and downregulation of miR-324-5p in mouse models of epilepsy is seizure-suppressive. Changes in miRNA expression are seen in epileptogenesis and in other disease pathologies. In epilepsy, miR-324-5p expression has been shown to increase and decrease at different timepoints and loci. Importantly, miR-324-5p has increased association with the RISC complex following seizure in mice, indicating more suppressive activity. Overall, this suggests that miR-324-5p plays a role in epileptogenesis via targeting of potassium channel KV4.2. =Cardiac disease= miR-324-5p contributes to cardiac disease pathophysiology and cardiomyocite death through translational inhibition of Mtfr1, leading to reduced mitochondrial fission, apoptosis, and myocardial infarction. =Psychiatric conditions= MiRNA expression profiles are altered in psychiatric conditions, including depression, anxiety, and PTSD. It has been demonstrated that miR-324-5p expression is altered in the brains of suicide victims with depression and in the amygdala, the fear center of the brain, in PTSD. MiRNAs are an underexplored potential biomarker and target for treatment for psychiatric disease. Future research and potential in medicine miRNA-324-5p is a relatively new and understudied microRNA. It is an important regulator in several diseases, and its effects span across the body from neuronal dysregulation in seizure to hepatocellular carcinoma and cardiac disease. Because microRNAs have numerous targets, they are capable of regulating multiple pathways and circuits, an ability that may be useful in the treatment of complex disorders like epilepsy in which many subsystems are dysregulated. However, the wide-ranging functions of miRNAs may be limiting as well. microRNA expression modulation could lead to unanticipated physiological effects and not provide adequate specificity.

Dubbed a stone frigate, HMCS Hunter is a land-based naval training establishment crewed by part-time sailors and also serves as a local recruitment centre for the Canadian Forces Naval Reserve. It is one of 24 naval reserve divisions located in major cities across Canada.  Namesake  HMCS Hunter is named after HMS General Hunter, a 10-gun brig of the Upper Canada Provincial Marine Royal Navy Lake Erie squadron. The original battle scarred ensign flown on HMS General Hunter during the War of 1812, at the Siege of Detroit and the Battle of Lake Erie, is currently in possession by the unit.  History  alt= HMCS Hunter was established in March 1940 as the Windsor Half Company Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve (RCNVR) at the old Toledo Scales plant at 2462 Howard Ave. in Windsor, Ontario. She was formally commissioned as a tender to HMCS Stadacona (Halifax) on 1 November 1941 during the Second World War. On 1 September 1942, she became an independent shore establishment. Her first commanding officer was Lt. Jordon H. Marshall, RCNVR. The original HMCS Hunter building was built in 1929 by Fred W. Martin, the same man who built the Detroit-Windsor Tunnel, and located at 960 Ouellette Avenue in Windsor. Planned as a giant food market the building was designed by president of the Toronto Building Company, R. J. Davies. The unit originally housed and trained new sailors preparing to join Canadian naval ships during the Second World War.alt=After the Second World War, HMCS Hunter was reorganised into a peacetime footing, no longer required to train and ship new recruits off to war. During the post-war period, HMCS Hunter personnel actively participated in the city intermediate basketball league, playing other city teams, including teams from the 22nd Reconnaissance Regiment and the Essex Scottish Regiment. Basketball was a very popular sport amongst sailors at HMCS Hunter, with games being played on Friday sport nights. The unit also entered a team in the Border Cities Baseball League. In 1949, the officers organised a Naval Officers' Revolver Club, which later joined the Dominion of Canada Rifle Association. A sterling silver spoon bearing the Navy crest was awarded to the top marksman at each shoot. In the same year, new gear was installed for the power operation of twin Oerlikon and twin Boffin gun batteries and the unit possessed a whaler to train personnel on land. In 1949, HMCS Hunter had two dinghies, a harbour craft and a motor cutter in service on the Detroit River. In 1946 the University Naval Training Division (UNTD) was established at Assumption College with sailors reporting to Hunter for training. Not eligible for commission or service prior to completing university, UNTD student/sailors would conduct 60 hours of training during the school year two weeks on the coast each summer. In June 1950, the unit sent 35 men and its Fairmile-B class motor launch, PTC 762, to partake in Exercise \\"Beaver\\", a tri-service reserve beach assault manoeuvre at Port Stanley, Ontario. The exercise involved land units, including the Elgin Regiment, Kent Regiment, Essex Fusiliers and the Windsor Essex Scottish Regiment; sea units, PTC 779 from HMCS Prevost, PTC 762 from HMCS Hunter and PTC 706 from HMCS Star'; and 11 aircraft from the City of London Auxiliary Squadron, RCAF. In 1951, a new reserve summer Great Lakes Training Scheme was set up to provide basic naval training on the Great Lakes for new recruits and officers. Administered by the commanding officer of HMCS Prevost, Commander F.R.K. Naften, the program was conceived to provide seagoing experience for men of the RCN(R) who have not completed the six-month new entry training program. Before being sent to ships and fleet establishments, until they were considered sufficiently trained, the new scheme was intended to give new sailors the experience they needed on the Great Lakes. With six motor launches at his disposal, the new Reserve Training Commander Great Lakes called upon PTCs from HMCS Hunter, York, Cataraqui, Prevost, Star and Griffin to form the \\"Fairmile Flotilla\\". From 16 to 17 June, the flotilla conducted its first task, \\"Operation Beaver II\\", a 1,700 reserve troop tri-service amphibious landing and airdrop exercise at Erieau. Prior to the amphibious landing of nearly 500 army troops on three beaches from the Fairmiles, PTC 716 from HMCS York laid a smokescreen and paratroopers from the 1st Battalion, Royal Canadian Regiment captured an airfield at nearby Chatham to allow friendly air support. Buzzing the \\"enemy\\" craft and ground troops with flour bags, a squadron of Harvard and Mustang aircraft, from No. 420 City of London Auxiliary Squadron, RCAF took on the role of enemy air forces. After the successful exercise, the flotilla spent the rest of the summer conducting other sailing activities and evolutions on Lake Ontario, Lake Huron, and Lake Superior before returning to their units. In the fall of 1951, HMCS Hunter stood up a Women's Royal Canadian Naval Service (WRCNS) division that proved themselves adept on the rifle range on a number of occasions and in 1952 showed up their male counterparts by capturing the divisional proficiency shield. The trophy, awarded every two months, was presented to the division that scored the highest number of points for attendance, smartness and drill. On 3 May 2015, the unit moved into a multi-million dollar state of the art facility to house the current members and equipment of the unit near Russell Street in Olde Sandwich Town, Windsor. The current building is located not far north of Amherstburg Navy Yard National Historic Site of Canada where the units namesake HMS General Hunter was constructed in 1806. COOP students during their graduation ceremony attended by family and friends. (July 2018) HMCS Hunter in 2018 In January 2018 the unit recruited 19 paid COOP students in a unique program with Greater Essex County District School Board, Windsor- Essex Catholic District School Board and Conseil scolaire catholique Providence (CSC Providence). The students came in every Tuesday and Thursday for training as well as one Saturday a month. In July 2018 the recruits were sent to Camp Vimy in CFB Valcartier. They all currently work at the unit training in their trades while some continue their secondary education or start their post secondary education. The program continues to bring more young recruits in 2019.HMCS Hunter personnel conducting a small boat exercise in conjunction with HMCS NCSM Prevost, Windsor Police Service, Canadian Coast Guard Thames River Inshore Rescue Boat (IRB) 2018  Tenders  = HMCS Haidee (VR1) = From 1942 to 1945, HMCS Haidee (VR1) served as a tender to HMCS Hunter. Built by Ditchburn Boats Ltd., in Gravenhurst, Ontario. Prior to joining HMCS Hunter, she served as a tender to the Toronto Division of the Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve (RCNVR) from November 1939 to July 1941. She was then transferred to HMCS Star in Hamilton from 1941 to 1942 before being transferred to HMCS Hunter as a training vessel to be used by the unit during the Second World War. none = HMCS Wolf (PTC 762) = From 1949 to 1956, HMCS Wolf (PTC 762) served as a tender to HMCS Hunter.

Tejendra's colleague, the offbeat research fellow Colette Harte, gives Everett video evidence that Tejendra's theoretical research into the existence of multiple universes is no longer theoretical. Using Heisenberg Gate technology, Tejendra and his team have discovered and contacted nine alternate universes so far. An alliance called the Plenitude of Known Worlds is already in place among the government leaders from these parallel universes‚Äîtermed planes‚Äîwhich have been numbered E1 through E9, with Everett's plane labeled E10. Before Tejendra's disappearance, he discovered a map of the seemingly infinite number of planes: the Infundibulum. Everett deduces how to manipulate the Infundibulum thanks to a clue from his father, and lets its existence be known to the mysterious people who have been pursuing him in search of it. He is taken by the glamorous but sinister Charlotte Villiers‚Äîthe Plenipotentiary/ambassador of E3‚Äîto the underground bunker where his universe's Heisenberg Gate is located. During a demonstration of his ability to choose any destination in any plane, Everett escapes through the Gate to E3, where Charlotte has put Tejendra to work on the Gate technology. E3 is an Earth without oil, where giant airships dominate shipping and transportation. Plastic does not exist, but E3 has developed nanotechnology that allows the use of carbon fiber in many applications. Everett meets and is taken in by Sen, the willful adopted daughter of Captain Anastasia Sixsmyth of the airship Everness. Sen is the ship's pilot, Mchynlyth is the engineer, and Miles O'Rahilly Lafayette Sharkey is the weighmaster. Hired as Sixsmyth's chef, Everett enlists Sen to infiltrate Charlotte's headquarters, the Tyrone Tower, to determine where Tejendra is being held. This leads Charlotte‚Äîbrandishing a jumpgun, a weapon capable of shooting people into a random other plane‚Äîto Hackney Great Port, where the Everness is moored. She and her team are rebuffed by a mob, and the Everness leaves for the Goodwin Sands, where Sixsmyth has been challenged to an airship duel by one of her enemies, the arrogant matriarch Ma Bromley. Everett helps sabotage Bromley's airship, and a thankful Sixsmyth agrees to help him save his father. The Everness crew break into the Tyrone Tower on zip-lines and the Singhs are reunited, but Charlotte arrives with her jumpgun and demands the Infundibulum. Everett places his laptop in front of her, and she decides to be rid of the Singhs forever. Charlotte jumps Tejendra to an unknown plane, but Sen intervenes before Charlotte can do the same to Everett. He grabs his computer and Charlotte's jumpgun, and escapes to the Everness with the crew. They are soon intercepted by Charlotte, who has commandeered a Royal Air Navy carrier. Everett uses the jumpgun to jump the entirety of the Everness to another plane, and they find themselves in a frozen tundra, with ice and snow as far as the eye can see. Development McDonald has classified the Everness series as \\"steampunk without steam. Teslapunk. Steampunk without the messed-around Victorian values.\\" He said, \\"I came up with the image of an airship that can travel between parallel universes, which is probably something every writer's thought of at some point, and I just followed it through.\\" Of the move to young adult fiction, McDonald noted, \\"It was a nice break to do something different ... I didn't want to get stuck doing the same SF books over and over, successful though they may be. I didn't want to keep writing books about the developing economy of the year‚ÄîIndia, Brazil. I could feel myself getting trapped in that ... The kids' book series gives me a chance to play off the leash a bit.\\" Adding that he has been approached about adapting Planesrunner for television, McDonald said that the series \\"is aimed at the Dr. Who audience quite deliberately. The series has the go-anywhere machine, which is what the Tardis is, but I also wanted a crew like you have in Star Trek.\\" Reception Though deeming lead character Everett Singh \\"too perfect\\", Publishers Weekly praised the novel's \\"nonstop action, eccentric characters, and expert universe building\\". Writing for The Telegraph, Anna Lisinski praised the detail with which McDonald describes E3, including the theme that prejudice is an ever-present potentiality in any culture, no matter its development. However, she found it difficult to empathise with Everett, and called the other characters underdeveloped. Susan Carpenter of the Los Angeles Times wrote that Planesrunner is \\"not just for kids\\", calling it thought-provoking and \\"a visually, if densely, written tale of sci-fi suspense that ponders big questions with wonderment and heart.\\" Stefan Raets of Tor.com agreed that the novel has \\"a lot to offer\\" non-young adult readers, complimenting the engaging characters and calling the setting of E3 \\"so insanely cool that it just about blows any other steampunk London clean out of the water.\\" He added, \\"Planesrunner is one of those novels that grabs hold of you from the very beginning and then just never lets go until the very end.\\" Kirkus Reviews praised the novel's \\"shining imagination, pulsing suspense and sparkling writing\\", and multiple reviews noted McDonald's successful simplification of the theory of quantum mechanics, which makes the concept easy to understand. Sequels A sequel, Be My Enemy, was released on 4 September 2012, followed by Empress of the Sun on 4 February 2014. =Be My Enemy= While the Everness crew assess their location and the condition of the airship, Everett tries to figure out how to interface the Infundibulum with Charlotte's jumpgun so he can choose the destination planes of future jumps. Something large appears on the radar, headed their way: a massive hovercraft battleship, with insignia that identifies the Islamic Britain of E2. It is swallowed by a giant creature that breaks through the ice just as the Everness jumps to Everett's home plane, E10. Meanwhile, an alternate Everett in E4‚Äîwhose father Tejendra was previously hit by a truck on his bicycle and killed‚Äîis hit by a car himself. He awakens in a station on the Moon, where an alien machine intelligence known as the Thryn arrived in 1963. Kept secret from the majority of people on Earth for 20 years, the Thryn Sentiency helped mankind achieve important medical and technological advancements, including the creation of the Heisenberg Gate. Plenipotentiary Charles Villiers‚ÄîCharlotte's E4 counterpart‚Äîasks E4 Everett to become an agent for the Plenitude. The Thryn avatar Madam Moon rebuilds Everett's wrecked body with technology that provides enhanced strength, speed, and agility; heightened senses; and built-in weaponry. He goes to E10 Everett's home, impersonates him, and attacks when E10 Everett arrives to rescue his mother and sister. The Everness escapes to the quarantined plane E1, where E10 Everett believes the jumpgun was created. He hopes to learn how to track past jumps in order to find his father. E1 has been overrun by a nanotechnology breakthrough gone awry, known as the Nahn, which has already assimilated six billion people and seeks to supplant every living thing on the planet. Sixsmyth and the crew are taken into custody by the government force protecting the few survivors in London, led by a politician called the Agister of Caiaophas and her military commander, the Brigadier. They hope to escape E1 with their people using the jumpgun and the Infundibulum. E10 Everett meets the E1 Tejendra, who guides a strike team to the Nahn-infested remains of Imperial University in search of a device used in a 1969 E1 survey to map thousands of planes. Tejendra is assimilated during their frantic escape back to the Everness with the device, and Everett opens a Heisenberg Gate tuned to the center of a sun that incinerates the whole of the university and the Nahn. Seeing the power of Everett's \\"sun gun\\", the Agister decides to stay and use it to rid E1 of the Nahn. The Everness crew depart, with the Panopticon mapping device, to find Everett's father, the E10 Tejendra. Meanwhile, the Villiers send E4 Everett to E1 in Thryn battle armor to attach a tracking device to the Everness. Though outfitted with weaponry designed to neutralize the Nahn, he is overcome by them. E4 Everett makes a deal: in exchange for his life, he agrees to carry some of the Nahn out of E1. Successfully attaching the tracker, he is jumped out by the Villiers, who place him back with E10 Everett's mother and are unaware that he carries a node of the Nahn. Kirkus Reviews called Be My Enemy \\"smart, clever and abundantly original, with suspense that grabs your eyeballs\\". Stefan Raets of Tor.com called the novel \\"outstanding\\" and \\"a blast from start to finish\\", but found some plot points lacking. =Empress of the Sun= The Everness is forced to make a random jump, and the airship is seriously damaged by its arrival in the middle of a jungle. Everett soon realizes that this \\"Earth\\" is actually an Alderson disk, so his navigation calculations were off. Determining that humans could not be advanced enough to construct the disk, he theorizes that dinosaurs who have evolved over 65 million of years might be capable. This is proven true when just such a dinosaur, Kaz, approaches Everett and is able to learn the English language almost instantly with advanced technology. The Worldwheel is ruled by six factions, or clades, each responsible for a key function: water, weather, agriculture, procreation, defense, and the sun itself. With Everett's help, Kaz defeats her rival and secures her position as heir to the Sun Throne of the Sunlords. Meanwhile, Charlotte Villiers is still hunting the Everness and the Infundibulum. She leads a strike squad into the airship expecting to face only the crew, but the Genequeen clade of Jiju attack the Everness as well, forcing Charlotte to flee and leave her team to be massacred. E4 Everett begins to settle into the life of his E10 counterpart after destroying the Nahn he brought with him from E1. Though he hides his Thryn abilities as best he can, some of the changes do not go unnoticed, giving Everett a bevy of female admirers and ultimately forcing him to admit to E10 Everett's best friend Ryun that he is E4 Everett. On the Worldwheel, Kaz brings E10 Everett and Sharkey to the Sunlord capital to meet her mother, the Empress of the Sun. After copying the Infundibulum, the Empress uses it to begin an invasion of billions of planes in the extended multiverse, and prompts the Worldwheel's sun to go nova, sanitizing the world and exterminating all of the other clades. The Everness escapes just in time. E10 Everett has a plan: since the Empress copied the Infundibulum exactly, Everett can control it with his smartphone. With Kaz's help, the airship crew infiltrates the Empress's city- ship over E10 London, and Everett sends a signal that jumps all of the Jiju ships into random planes, and then erases all copies of the Infundibulum. Charlotte returns to her true home plane, which she has dubbed E3A. She longs to be reunited with her lover Langdon, who is trapped in the rift between planes after going through an early iteration of the Heisenberg Gate. Kirkus Reviews described Empress of the Sun as \\"endlessly fascinating and fun.\\" Stefan Raets of Tor.com deemed it the best novel in the series so far, and praised its dynamic characters.

The fifth axiom of hyperbolic geometry says that given a line L and a point P not on that line, there are at least two lines passing through P that are parallel to L. As in Euclidean geometry, where ancient Greek mathematicians used a compass and idealized ruler for constructions of lengths, angles, and other geometric figures, constructions can also be made in hyperbolic geometry. Pseudosphere  Models of hyperbolic geometry  There are a couple of models for hyperbolic geometry, which can make performing and visualizing constructions easier. Portions of the hyperbolic plane can be placed onto a pseudosphere and maintain angles and hyperbolic distances, as well as be bent around the pseudosphere and still keep its properties. However, not the entire hyperbolic plane can be placed onto the pseudosphere as a model, only a portion of the hyperbolic plane. Poincare disc with hyperbolic parallel lines The entire hyperbolic plane can also be placed on a Poincar√© disk and maintain its angles. However, the lines will turn into circular arcs, which warps them.  Tools  In hyperbolic geometry, one can use the standard ruler and compass that is often used in Euclidean plane geometry. However, there are a variety of compasses and rulers developed for hyperbolic constructions. A hypercompass can be used to construct a hypercycle given the central line and radius. A horocompass can be used to construct a horocycle through a specific point if the diameter and direction are also provided. Both of these also require a straight edge, like the standard ruler. When doing constructions in hyperbolic geometry, as long as you are using the proper ruler for the construction, the three compasses (meaning the horocompass, hypercompass, and the standard compass) can all perform the same constructions. A parallel ruler can be used to draw a line through a given point A and parallel to a given ray a. For any two lines, a hyperbolic ruler can be used to construct a line that is parallel to the first line and perpendicular to the second. A few notes on the uses of rulers are: * A parallel ruler can be used to construct anything that a standard ruler and the three rulers can also construct * A parallel ruler can act as a ruler in Euclidean geometry * A hyperbolic ruler cannot perform Euclidean geometry constructions * In hyperbolic geometry, constructions that can be done using any one of the three compasses listed above and the parallel ruler can also be done using the hyperbolic ruler  Simple constructions  = Angle bisector = Consider a given angle ·óâ IAI' ‚â† /2 radians whose angle bisector is sought. This results in two different cases: either ·óâ IAI' < /2 radians or ·óâ IAI' > /2 radians. For both cases a hyperbolic ruler is needed to construct a line BI' where BI' is perpendicular to AI and parallel to AI'. Also, construct a line B'I where B'I is perpendicular to AI' and parallel to AI. Case 1: ·óâ IAI'< /2 radians Let C be the intersection of BI' and B'I. The result of this is that the line AC bisects ·óâ IAI'. Case 2: ·óâ IAI' > /2 radians This case is further broken down into three sub-cases: * Case 2a: IB' intersects I'B  Let A' be the intersection of IB' and I'B. Then AA' is the angle bisector of ·óâ IAI'. * Case 2b: IB' is parallel to I'B  Construct the line segment BB' and using a hyperbolic ruler, construct the line OI\\" such that OI\\" is perpendicular to BB' and parallel to B'I\\". Then, line OA is the angle bisector for ·óâ IAI'. * Case 2c: IB' is ultraparallel to I'B.  Using the ultraparallel theorem, construct the common perpendicular of IB' and I'B, CC'. Let the intersection of CB\\" and BC' be D. As a result, AD will be the angle bisector of ·óâ BDB'. We then find that the line through OD is also the angle bisector of ·óâ IAI'. = Common parallel line to two lines = We consider the problem of finding a line parallel to two given lines, a and a'. There are three cases: a and a' intersect at a point O, a and a' are parallel to each other, and a and a' are ultraparallel to each other. Case 1: a and a' intersect at a point O, Bisect one of the angles made by these two lines and name the angle bisector b. Using a hyperbolic ruler, construct a line c such that c is perpendicular to b and parallel to a. As a result, c is also parallel to a', making c the common parallel to lines a and a'. Case 2: a and a' are parallel to each other Using a hyperbolic ruler, construct AI' such that AI' is parallel to a' and perpendicular to a. Construct another line A'I such that A'I is parallel to a and perpendicular to a'. Let the intersection of AI' and A'I be B. Because ·óâ IBI' > /2 radians, the case now plays out like case 1, allowing construction of the common parallel to BI and BI'. Case 3: a and a' are ultraparallel to each other Using a hyperbolic ruler, construct BI' such that BI' is perpendicular to a and parallel to a' and construct a line B'I such that B'I is perpendicular to a' and parallel to a in a way that puts BI' and B'I on the same side of the common perpendicular to a and a' , which can be found using the ultraparallel theorem. Let the intersection of BI' and B'I be C. Then ·óâ ICI' ‚â† /2 radians, which allows you to finish the construction like the other two cases. = Line perpendicular to another line at a point = Suppose you have a line a and a point A on that line, and you want to construct a line perpendicular to a and through A. Then let a' be a line through A where a and a' are two distinct lines. Then you will have one of two cases. Case 1: a is perpendicular to a' In this case, we already have the line perpendicular to a through A. Case 2: a and a' are not perpendicular to each other Using a hyperbolic ruler, construct a line BI such that BI is perpendicular to a and parallel to a'. Also, construct a line CI' such that CI' is perpendicular to a and parallel to a' but in the opposite direction of BI. Now draw a line II\\" so that II\\" is the common parallel to BI and I'C. The ultraparallel theorem now allows us to create the common perpendicular to II\\" and a because these two lines are ultraparallel. This common perpendicular is now the line perpendicular to a and through A. = Midpoint of a line segment = Suppose you are trying to find the midpoint of a line segment AB. Then construct the line AI such that AI is through A and perpendicular to AB. Also, construct a line BI' such that BI' intersects AB at B and is perpendicular to AB. Now construct the line II' such that II' is the common parallel to AI and BI'. Construct the common perpendicular to II' and AB, which can be done using the ultraparallel theorem because II' and AB are ultraparallel to each other. Name this line CC'. C now ends up being the midpoint of AB.  Definitions for complex constructions  When giving angles a positive or negative sign, angle ·óâ XYZ will be positive if the direction of the shortest path from XY to YZ is counterclockwise For the purposes of the following definitions, the following assumptions will be made, which usually cannot be made in hyperbolic geometry * Three distinct points create a unique circle * Given any two lines, they meet at a unique point (normally, this would contradict the parallel axiom of hyperbolic geometry, since there can be many different lines parallel to the same line) * Angle measures have signs. Here, they will be defined in the following way: Consider a triangle XYZ. The sign of angle ·óâ XYZ is positive if and only if the direction of the path along the shortest arc from side XY to side YZ is counterclockwise. The picture of the triangle on the right describes this. To make a comparison, when working with the unit circle, the angle measure is positive when going counterclockwise and negative when going clockwise. = Cyclic quadrilaterals = A quadrilateral is cyclic if the two opposite vertices add up to pi radians or 180 degrees. Also, if a quadrilateral is inscribed in a circle in a way that all of its vertexes lie on the circle, it is cyclic. = Pseudoaltitudes = Consider triangle ABC where the points are labeled in a clockwise manner so all angles are positive. Let X be a point moving along BC from B to C. As X moves closer to C, angle ·óâAXB will decrease and angle ·óâ AXC will increase. When X is close enough to B, ·óâ AXB > ·óâ AXC. When X is close enough to C, ·óâ AXB < ·óâ AXC. This means that at some point, X will be in a position where ·óâ AXB = ·óâ AXC. When X is in this position, it is defined as the foot of the pseudoaltitude from vertex A. The pseudoaltitude would then be the line segment AX. Here, examples of pseudoaltitudes would be A1H1, A2H2, and A3H3. = Pseudolengths = Let dE(A,B) denote the pseudolength for a given hyperbolic line segment AB. Let a transformation move A to the center of a Poincar√© disk with a radius equalling 1. The pseudolength dE(A,B) is the length of this segment in Euclidean geometry. = Homothety = Given a point P, a point A where A is the center of the homothety, and a number k that represents the ratio of the homothety, a homothety is a transformation that will move P to a point P' where P' is on the ray AP and dE(A,P') = k¬∑dE(A,P).  Three dunce cap theorem  Consider the three circles œâ1, œâ2, and œâ3 in a common plane. Let P1 be the intersection of the two external tangent lines of œâ2 and œâ3. Let P2 and P3 be found the same way. The Three Dunce Caps Theorem then says that P1, P2, and P3 all lie on the same line. Proof: Construct a sphere on top of each circle and then construct a plane tangent to these three spheres. The plane intersects the plane that the circles lies on at a straight line containing P1, P2, and P3. These points are also the centers of homothety for the circles that they were derived from.  Applying to spherical geometry  Algebraically, hyperbolic and spherical geometry have the same structure. This allows us to apply concepts and theorems to one geometry to the other. Applying hyperbolic geometry to spherical geometry can make it easier to understand because spheres are much more concrete, which then makes spherical geometry easier to conceptualize.

In August 2019, as a result of the closure of a number of non performing banks by the Bank of Ghana, trainees whose stipends were paid onto GN Bank's Ezwich cards did not receive their stipends although they worked for the month of August. And have still not been paid nine months on and still counting. Although NABCO has kept a number of unemployed graduates in temporary employment, the inconsistencies in the payment of monthly stipends have become a major headache to all the trainees. Some of which still have arrears to be paid to them. Application process Interested graduate would visit the NABCO website to sign up and provide required supporting documents such as Degree Certificate, NSS Certificate, National Identification Cards to participate in the program or initiative. A graduate trainee signed up for the program will receive a text message inviting him or her to attend an interview. Successful applicants attend an orientation at the district level. Those applicants who had issues with signing up, had a status of \\"pending\\" or were \\"no show\\" with respect to their registration could also attend the orientation and receive assistance from the district coordinators to resolve any signing or registration problems encountered. All orientation attendees are taught the KPI key indicators that would make a NABCO trainee successful on the job. That is,'K' for Knowledge, 'P' for Punctuality and 'I' for Integrity. Explanation of KPI *Knowledge (K) : This is where trainees must learn on the go and are required to apply the knowledge they acquire on the job to enhance productivity *Punctuality (P) : This is where trainees must ensure that they report to work earlier than expected, should not look at negative existing organizational culture work concerning going to work early. Trainees are expected to start work early to increase productivity. *Integrity (I) : This is where each trainees is expected to be diligent and avoid being corrupt on the job to further enhance productivity and develop of their personal integrity as a whole. Modules NABCO has seven modules which a signed up graduate could trained in. Namely; Educate Ghana, Heal Ghana, Digitize Ghana, Feed Ghana, Revenue Ghana, Civic Ghana and Enterprise Ghana. *Educate Ghana is a module under which a graduate trainee works in a school as a supporting teacher in basic school teaching in STEM (Science Technology & Mathematics)programs. This is mostly for trained teachers or other disciplines as well. *Enterprise Ghana is a module under which a graduate trainee trains and works with business to develop entrepreneurial skills. This module is aimed at engaging graduate discipline of any level. *Digitize Ghana is a module under which graduate trainees work in Information Communication Technology (ICT) units of various institution to develop and improve upon their digital skills. This module is aimed at engaging graduate student in ICT and other disciplines as well. *Feed Ghana is a model under which graduate trainees work with various agricultural institutions in the country to build capacity and skills. This is aimed at engaging graduate student of any level. *Heal Ghana is a module under which graduate trainees work in various hospitals in the country to develop and improving their skills in provision of health services and/or management.

This is aimed at engaging graduate student of any level. *Revenue Ghana is a module under which graduate trainees would work with the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) to develop and improve upon their skills and ability to identify revenue sources and manage revenue generated. This is aimed at engaging graduate who studied Accounting, Finance or student of any level. NABCO cloth The NABCO program provides graduate trainees with an African cloth so that they can show that they are part of the program or create some kind of awareness when they go to work. The cloth is supposed to be worn on Mondays and Fridays only. However, the cloth was never distributed to NABCO Trainees. The various District Coordinators compulsorily tasked trainees to pay amounts ranging from GHs 30 and 35 as fees for the supposed cloths to be sewn for them. Trainees who resisted had their time sheets not signed by their coordinator. NABCO App The NABCO team created an app which is called the NABCO App. The app was created to be use by the graduate trainees to clock in and out when they come and leave from work, writing reports, training and getting updates. The app's duty is to monitor the trainees to ensure efficiency and productivity. The app runs on Android, IOS and Windows devices respectively. Graduation/Passing out ceremony On 17 October 2018 the trainees were invited to a passing out or graduation ceremony through a communique from the coordinator of NABCO Dr. Ibrahim Anyars. He issued out the invitation on behalf of the president. On the day of the ceremony, graduates from all nooks and crannies or length and breadth of the country trooped to the Independence or Black Star Square in their numbers. Most trainees from other regions were represented by a few but those from Greater Accra all attended the event. As the trainees were provided a T-Shirt this made the event very colorful. The president, his vice president and ministers of state who attended the ceremony received a rousing welcome from the trainees. The event commenced with christian and muslim prayers. The master of ceremony for the event was the Minister Designate Kojo Oppong Nkrumah who called upon the NABCO Coordinator, Dr. Ibrahim Anyars, to provide a brief history of how the graduate recruitment began and statistics on who were recruited. Trainees were selected or volunteered matched to modules without any form of training. Representatives from various modules provided statistics on the number of people recruited and the costs associated with the three-year training. The president's speech was insightful, provided additional statistics about the initiative and how far this initiative would encourage the Ghanaian youth to make a difference in the future. He also commended his vice and his team for the wonderful and amazing job they did bringing this initiative into fruition.

Introduced in the fourth season, he is portrayed by Tony Dalton and was created by Vince Gilligan, Peter Gould and Gordon Smith. Dialogue that introduces Saul Goodman in the Breaking Bad episode \\"Better Call Saul\\" mentions Lalo and Nacho Varga. Lalo, a member of the Ju√°rez Cartel, is one of many nephews of drug kingpin Hector Salamanca. After Hector suffers a stroke, Lalo arrives from Mexico to help run the family drug operation in the U.S. and takes a greater interest in the day-to-day details than Hector did. Showrunners gave Dalton freedom to diverge from cartel stereotypes and portrayals of other Salamancas. Dalton plays a cheerful and charismatic Lalo, vicious when the situation calls for it. Critics have praised Lalo's character and Dalton's portrayal.  Conception and development  In July 2018, Tony Dalton joined Better Call Saul in the role of Lalo Salamanca; he first appeared in the season four episode \\"Coushatta\\". The Breaking Bad episode \\"Better Call Saul\\" mentions Lalo; it also introduces Saul Goodman (Jimmy McGill's professional name) and mentions \\"Ignacio\\" (Nacho Varga). In an interview before Better Call Saul aired, Vince Gilligan said that the writers had envisioned Lalo as a major character and as with Breaking Bad, must \\"keep close tabs on what our characters have done in the past and make good use of it here in the present and the future\\". However, Gilligan and Peter Gould had trouble figuring out how to introduce the character properly. They considered him a bogeyman around the second season, in which they set up Lalo's introduction, but had not figured out the character's personality or motivations. Gilligan held himself responsible for delaying developing Lalo, as Gould pushed for the story to introduce Lalo earlier. Gould saw that Lalo needed to be different from the other Salamancas and a foil equal to Gus Fring. Gould credited their casting directors Sherry Thomas and Sharon Bialy for selecting Dalton, a telenovela star, for the role. He said that Dalton had \\"the charm, and the joy, and the threat\\" needed for the character and \\"all the charm of a '40s movie star\\". The episode \\"Wiedersehen\\", written by Gennifer Hutchison, fleshes out Lalo further. Hutchison said that while just as \\"scary\\" as the other Salamancas, he is \\"a little more circumspect about things\\". She explained that the producers wanted him to be \\"a little charming\\", in contrast to the other Salamancas, who have few qualities beyond fearsomeness. Dalton said that the season five finale, \\"Something Unforgivable\\", provides a breadth not seen in prior episodes. Lalo first appears as a charismatic person his extended family and cartel leaders welcome but shows a vicious and vengeful side after his family comes under attack. In a Den of Geek interview, Michael Mando (who portrays Nacho) described Lalo as \\"a Salamanca in every way, just like Tuco and Hector had their own flavors to the erratic Salamancas\\". Gilligan and Gould gave Dalton the freedom to take Lalo's personality as he saw fit, just as they had allowed Jonathan Banks to develop Mike Ehrmantraut during Breaking Bad. According to Dalton, Lalo was not originally meant to be very charming; Dalton felt the show needed someone \\"kind of smiling and carefree and a little bit mischievous\\" like Jimmy but \\"in the bad guy's part\\". Dalton took inspiration from Samuel L. Jackson's character Jules Winnfield from Pulp Fiction to create this \\"[k]ind of this smart ass, sort of scary but kind of carefree, kind of cool guy\\". He also sought to move away from his role in the HBO Latinoam√©rica series Sr. √Åvila as a hitman with \\"zero personality\\" whom he likened to a wall. Dalton toned down Lalo's Mexican accent as he \\"might have gone to a good school in Texas or Arizona or something because his family had money\\" and went for an accent that he had developed from growing up around Laredo, Texas instead. Dalton gave Lalo a more upbeat personality to show the character's normally easy take on life and distance him from the typical portrayal of cartel members as serious about their work. Dalton did his own stunt in \\"Winner\\": Lalo's jump through the Travelwire store roof before he attacks the manager, Fred. While Dalton wanted to do other stunts, such as jumping onto Jimmy's car in \\"Bad Choice Road\\" and from the roof of his house in \\"Something Unforgivable\\", the producers insisted on stunt performers.  Fictional character biography  = Background = Eduardo \\"Lalo\\" Salamanca is a member of the Ju√°rez Cartel and one of many nephews of drug kingpin Hector Salamanca. Little is known of his background before his appearance on Better Call Saul. The season five finale reveals he has a home in Chihuahua, Mexico, where many of his friends, his family, and a large staff live. Lalo is a respected cartel member who has gained the favor of its leader, Don Eladio Vuente, and drives a 1970 Chevrolet Monte Carlo. = Better Call Saul =  Season 4  After Hector suffers a stroke that leaves only his right index finger mobile, Lalo moves from Mexico to Albuquerque to help run the Salamanca family's drug operation. He takes a greater interest in the day-to-day details than Hector did, which makes Hector's subordinate Nacho Varga (secretly responsible for Hector's stroke and recently turned mole for rival kingpin Gus Fring) uneasy. Lalo visits Hector in the nursing home and gives him a front desk call bell, a souvenir from when Hector killed a hotelier and burned down the hotel after its owner disrespected him. Lalo attaches the bell to Hector's wheelchair so Hector can communicate by ringing the bell with his finger. Lalo thanks Gus for giving Hector first aid and paying for his care but surveils Gus' subordinates to learn their regular activities. While staking out Gus' Los Pollos Hermanos chicken farm, Lalo observes activity related to Werner Ziegler's escape. He follows Mike Ehrmantraut as Mike tracks Werner, which leads him to a Travelwire store. Mike updates Gus on Werner's actions and persuades Gus to let him retrieve Werner instead of sending hitmen after him. After Mike and Gus leave, Lalo enters and tries to learn what Mike knows, but the clerk, Fred Whalen, refuses to tell him. Lalo kills Fred, reviews the security footage Mike saw, and sets fire to the store on his way out. Lalo calls resorts until he finds Werner; he then pretends to work for Gus and tricks Werner into revealing some details about the construction of the meth lab under Gus' industrial laundry. Mike arrives at Werner's location and ends the call but realizes Lalo knows some information about the meth lab construction. Mike reports to Gus, who realizes Werner will have to be killed to prevent Lalo from learning more; Mike accepts responsibility because Werner escaped on his watch and kills Werner himself.  Season 5  Gus draws Lalo to a meeting by having Nacho slip meth into the Salamancas' share of the cartel's cocaine. With Juan Bolsa present, Gus tells Lalo that Werner was constructing a chilling system, fled after stealing cocaine, and Gus had him killed to cover up the theft. Since the cover story explains events Lalo knows about, he accepts Gus' explanation and apology. Bolsa tells Lalo the cartel considers the matter closed. However, Lalo remains suspicious after Hector confirms that the cartel only tolerates Gus because he is a top moneymaker. Gus threatens Nacho's father to coerce Nacho into gaining Lalo's trust so he can provide Gus inside information on the Salamancas. When Krazy-8 is arrested outside a Salamanca stash house, Nacho climbs over rooftops to sneak in and recover the drugs before police enter. Lalo is impressed and takes Nacho into his confidence. Nacho brings Jimmy to Lalo, who knows of Jimmy from conversations with Tuco. Lalo asks Jimmy to free Krazy-8 by using him to feed the DEA information on Gus' dead drops. Nacho informs Gus, who accepts the loss of cash from the dead drops to protect Nacho's role as his informant. Jimmy secures Krazy-8's release and makes him a confidential informant for DEA agent Hank Schrader, giving Lalo a way to feed the DEA more information about Gus' operation. Lalo congratulates Jimmy, but Nacho warns him that when it comes to working for cartels, \\"When you're in, you're in\\". Mike tricks a witness to Fred's murder into providing details about Lalo's car, and the police arrest Lalo. He is denied bail, but Gus wants him released, so Mike provides Jimmy details of an investigation he did into Lalo under an assumed name. Jimmy uses the information to accuse police of witness tampering, and the judge sets bail at $7 million cash. Lalo's cousins Leonel and Marco Salamanca deliver the money to Jimmy at a remote desert location, but Bolsa, who believes he is protecting Gus' business by keeping Lalo imprisoned, sends gunmen after Jimmy. Mike was following Jimmy for Gus and kills all but one gunman. They continue the trip back to Albuquerque with the money, but after Jimmy's car breaks down, they push it off the side of the road and walk for two days. On the second day, they kill the remaining gunman and reach a truck stop, where they call Victor and Tyrus Kitt for help. Upon his return, Jimmy posts bail and gives Lalo a cover story to hide Mike's involvement. Lalo bids Hector goodbye and prepares to return to Mexico to avoid trial. However, his suspicions lead him to search for Jimmy's car. He confronts Jimmy and Kim Wexler at her apartment and reveals he found the car, which has many bullet holes. Kim tells Lalo that passersby probably shot at it for fun and berates him for not trusting Jimmy. Apparently satisfied, Lalo leaves for Mexico with Nacho. At Lalo's Chihuahua home, friends and family greet him and Nacho. Lalo introduces Nacho to Don Eladio, who blesses the plan for Nacho to oversee the Salamanca drug business in Lalo's absence. Gus sends assassins to Lalo's home, and Nacho receives a call instructing him to leave Lalo's back gate open at 3 a.m. Lalo is still awake at 3 a.m., so Nacho sets a kitchen fire to distract him and opens the gate. Nacho flees as the assassins enter and kill most of Lalo's family and guards. Lalo kills all but one assassin and forces the survivor to report his death to the middleman who arranged the attack. Lalo then realizes that Nacho is missing and angrily strides away from his house. = Breaking Bad = Tony Dalton portrays Lalo Salamanca  Season 2  Though Lalo never appears in Breaking Bad, Saul mentions him when Walter White and Jesse Pinkman kidnap and hold Saul at gunpoint before a newly dug grave in the desert to coerce him into representing Badger, who has been arrested for selling drugs. Believing Lalo sent Walt and Jesse, he says in panic, \\"It wasn't me, it was Ignacio! He's the one!\\". Saul is relieved when Walt and Jesse's confusion confirms they have no connection to Lalo.  Reception  The character of Lalo Salamanca and Tony Dalton's performance have received critical acclaim. Reviewing the episode that introduces Lalo, Alan Sepinwall of Rolling Stone said Dalton \\"makes a solid first impression in the role\\" and hoped for \\"more than filling in a blank most viewers had long since forgotten existed\\". Sepinwall calls the final scene in \\"Bad Choice Road\\", in which Lalo confronts Jimmy and Kim, one of the best in the series. He praises the lead actors' performances, particularly Rhea Seehorn as Kim and Dalton as Lalo. Steve Greene of IndieWire, after comparing Lalo to Anton Chigurh, noted he has \\"the unpredictability of his impulsive, petulant brother combined with the faux geniality of his chicken CEO rival\\" and praised Dalton's performance: \\"Dalton makes that poisonous, affected smile work, especially when it's coupled with Lalo's blatant disregard for bodily harm\\". Brian Grubb of Uproxx wrote in his review of the season five finale, \\"It is almost unreasonable how good a character Lalo is. To pull this off after five seasons of this show and the full run of Breaking Bad, to just up and introduce someone this charming and evil and perfect, is basically showing off\\".

It was developed and published by British company Ocean Software, and was released for several computer platforms. In the United Kingdom, it was released for Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum in December 1986. The following year, it was released for Atari ST. In the United States, it was published by Thunder Mountain. In 1989, it was published by The Hit Squad as a budget re-release for ZX Spectrum and Commodore 64. Gameplay Top Gun is a combat flight simulation game. The game is viewed with two vertical split screens, one for the player's fighter plane and one for an enemy plane. Both screens are viewed from within the cockpit. On each level, the player faces off against three enemy planes, one at a time. The player advances to the next level after defeating the three planes. The player can use a machine gun and missiles against enemies, who become more difficult to defeat as the game progresses. The machine gun is prone to overheating if used continually, and missiles must be locked on to a target for three seconds before they can be launched. Enemy planes also have missiles, and a single missile is fatal to both the player and the enemy plane. The player can drop a flare to distract an incoming enemy missile. An instrument panel gives the player information such as altitude, speed, and machine gun temperature. Top Gun includes a two- player mode in which both players receive three planes. Both players start with a plane each and use it in combat against the other player. If a plane is destroyed, the player uses another one. A player loses the game if all three planes are destroyed by the other player. Reception Reviewers for Crash were surprised by how good the game was, and they offered particular praise for the two-player mode. Paul Boughton of Computer and Video Games described the game as \\"a pretty neat combination of flight simulation mixed with sky high duelling. With the Top Gun name it's a winner.\\" Mike Roberts of Computer Gamer stated that Top Gun and Ace were the best flight games he had ever played up to that point. John Cook of Popular Computing Weekly concluded that the game was not a bad effort, and recommended it for people wanting a \\"minimalist\\" two-player air combat game. Benn Dunnington of .info called the game a \\"simple but amusing shoot 'em up.\\" John Gilbert of Sinclair User stated that the game lacked depth and concluded, \\"It's difficult to classify Top Gun. It doesn't make it as a jet simulation. On the other hand it's not an arcade game either ‚Äì there's not enough action. In fact it's pretty dull all round.\\" Gilbert criticized the graphics, describing them as \\"almost non-existent.\\" He wrote, \\"Combat conveniently takes place at night, giving Ocean an excuse for black background on both cockpit views\\".

Born in Amsterdam, she began writing occasional poetry and in her early twenties had published her first tragedy. Influenced by the Enlightenment, her tragedies were classicist in style and proved to be popular, being performed all over the country. She wrote an ode in French for George Washington, and sent it to him, and for the revised Dutch version of the Book of Psalms she provided seventeen of the psalms.  Biography  Lucretia van Merken was born to fur trader Jacob van Merken (1691‚Äì1754) and Susanna Wilhelmina Brandt (1687‚Äì1759),van Logchem. a granddaughter of historian and poet Gerard Brandt (1626‚Äì1685).van der Aa, p.637. Meijer Drees, p. 572. She grew up in Amsterdam on the corner of Keizersgracht and Herenstraat, in a family of Remonstrants. From a young age she was interested in poetry, supported by her mother and by poet Frans de Haes, an older cousin. Her literary examples were Sybrand Feitema and especially Joost van den Vondel. In the 1750s van Merken lost her entire family: her father (1754), her mother (1759), and her younger sister Wilhelmina (1760).te Winkel, p.395. Her own health was also frail, and in the 1760s she was preparing for death. Van Merken married on 26 September 1768 in Amsterdam, to Nicolaas Simon van Winter (1718‚Äì1795), a poet and paint merchant. Van Winter was a widower; his first wife, Johanna M√ºhl (1718‚Äì1768),van der Aa, p.638 had been a friend of van Merken's. The couple never had children.te Winkel, p.399 Van Winter proposed marriage in verse, and van Merken responded in kind. Shortly after the marriage, van Winter handed over his paint trade to his only son Pieter, and the couple moved to Leiden, maintaining their friendships in Amsterdam via intense correspondence. They spent summers on their estate near Bijdorp, near Zoeterwoude, where they entertained their friends. In 1774, van Merken and her husband were named honorary citizens of Leiden, likely influenced by her tragedy Het beleg der stad Leyden (1774), which commemorates the Siege of Leiden.te Winkel, p.404 By that time her reputation as a poet was already established; Betje Wolff called her \\"the greatest poetess of our country\\".Meijer Drees, p. 572 (quote from a letter of Wolff's to Van Merken, 2 Januari 1777) She died in Leiden, but was buried in the Oude Kerk, Amsterdam, where her husband was later buried as well. A plaque for the couple was placed in the Oude Kerk in 1828 by a Leiden society, to the right of the organ. A monument designed by another Leiden group was designed but never built. Van Merken represented the 18th-century Enlightenment ideal of an educated, civilized citizen, and for a long time was a model for budding poets. Romanticism ended the popularity of her work, and later attempts by Hendrik Tollens (1852) and Willem Kloos (1909) to reappraise her were unsuccessful. Literary works In her younger years, van Merken mostly wrote occasional poetry, for instance for David van Mollem, owner of the Zijdebalen estate, and for Gerard Aarnout Hasselaar, mayor of Amsterdam. She wrote her first major work in her early twenties; her tragedy Artemines was published in 1745 by Izaak Duim in Amsterdam.te Winkel. p.392. In a period of grief she wrote about the comfort she derived from her faith in her didactic poem Het nut der tegenspoeden (\\"The use of adversities\\", 1762), a poem that was popular for a long time. When a group of poets joined around 1760 to form a society, \\"Laus Deo, Salus Populo\\" ('Honor to God, blessings for the people'), in order to update the archaic rhymed translation of the Psalms by Petrus Datheen, van Merken's future husband was one of them. She joined the group, and when in 1773 the official new version of the Psalms were published, 17 of those were hers,Smit, p.602 including Psalm 42.Smit, p.603 After moving to Leiden, van Winter and van Merken jointly published their plays in two volumes, Tooneelpo√´zij (1774, 1786).van der Aa, p.639 Frontispiece for De Camisards.te Winkel, p.405. Published in Tooneelpo√´zij. Her classicist tragedies were regularly performed in all the major Dutch cities; on 14 September 1774 the new Stadsschouwburg in Amsterdam was opened with the premiere of her tragedy Jacob Simonszoon de Ryk.te Winkel, p.401 Because van Merken rarely commented on contemporary events outside of her occasional poems, her ode in French to George Washington, which she sent to him personally in October 1783, is all the more remarkable. The ode, which hails Washington as the defender of his people's freedom (apparently Van Merken despised the British), contained twenty four-line stanzas. Van Merken waited in vain for an answer, and half a year later, in April 1784, she sent it again, this time accompanied by a letter in French written by her husband. Washington knew little or no French, so he would have had to read both the letter and poem in translated form; two years later a letter from Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette arrived, with two accompanying letters in English from Washington thanking the couple for the gift.H√∂weler, p.70-77 Van Merken's predilection for serious subject matter and lofty genre writing is evidenced by her tragedies, but also by two expansive epics: David (in twelve books, 1767)Smit, p.599-620. and Germanicus (in sixteen books, 1779). Her final work, De ware geluksbedeeling, published in 1792 along with some letters in rhyme and a few occasional poems, is similar to Het nut der tegenspoeden, a contemplation on life, on the inevitability of sorrow, and the comfort offered by religion.

The woodlands of the northeastern United States are shown against a setting sun that intensely colors the dramatic altocumulus clouds. Church scholar John K. Howat describes the painting as \\"one of his finest ever\\"Howat (2005), 99 and as \\"the single most impressive example of Church's depictions of unsullied North American woodlands and their most famous representation in nineteenth-century painting\\".Howat (1987), 251‚Äì252 Composition Painted during a time of increasing American interest in unspoiled nature‚ÄîThoreau's Walden was published in 1854‚Äîthere are no signs of human activity in this landscape; the only animal life is a small bird perched at left. Like many of Church's paintings, the picture is likely a composite of sketches taken in the field, especially in Maine, which he visited often. He travelled many times in the 1850s to Mount Desert Island and Mount Katahdin, then an especially remote area. Like Church's other major works, it is a highly detailed view of nature. The sky is painted in skillful gradations of purples, oranges, and yellows,Howat (1987), 252 and reflects the influence of the popular English landscapist J. M. W. Turner on Church.Sweeney, 57 Improved oil colors may have helped Church achieve the effect. In terms of the Luminist style, with which Church is sometimes associated, the artistic achievement in the painted sky is the culmination of his many earlier pictures of sunsets and sunrises. David C. Huntington, Church's \\"re-discoverer\\" in the 1960s, writes that \\"there is no [longer a] surfeit of pigment; no unnatural border inadvertently solidifies the cloud vapors ... In Twilight in the Wilderness the discipline of careful study achieved its consummation.\\"Huntington (1989), 169 The lack of imposing \\"paintiness\\" contributes to the effect of a camera- like clarity that leaves the personality of the painter scarcely discernible, as one contemporary reviewer noted: Whether this approach to painting, an aspect of Luminism, was commendable depends on the critic. The quoted review ends, \\"It is this absence of any signs of mood or manner in his works that we attribute the charm of a deficiency in feeling which is sometimes brought against him.\\" Huntington responds, \\"The dissemblance of art has so enthralled the critic that the mood, the feeling of Twilight in the Wilderness elude his recognition.\\"Huntington (1989), 167 Reception and interpretation Sanford Robinson Gifford's A Twilight in the Catskills (1861) In 1860 the painting was exhibited from June 8 to July 25 at Goupil's in New York City.Kelly, 164 It was well received, with contemporary viewers relating its purity of nature with spirituality. Critics described it as a \\"scene unhistoric, with no other interest than that of a wilderness, without human association of any kind\\" and \\"Nature with folded hands, kneeling at her evening prayer\\". Others saw \\"merely\\" nature, such as the Cosmopolitan Art Journal, which called it \\"unworthy of the artist, being a mere piece of scene painting, which it was a vanity to exhibit\\". Huntington emphasized the connection between pristine wilderness and the cultural sense of American exceptionalism. He highlighted the painting tradition that Church incorporated, and reinvented, for a uniquely American art: For receptive viewers, the painting contains discrete religious symbols: the tree stump is a \\"wilderness altar\\" on which there is a small cross formed of wood splinters, and the outline of an angel is apparent; the three trees that frame the scene at right symbolize the three crosses at Calvary. Huntington suggests that a small cloud fragment (or alternately a small gap in the clouds), located by following the line of the tree stump, evokes the \\"Dove of the Holy Spirit\\". The American wilderness and turbulent sky pictured here, as night descends, have been interpreted apocalyptically, as a metaphor for a country falling into discord on the brink of the Civil War. In this context, the painting is considered patriotic. Sanford Robinson Gifford's A Twilight in the Catskills (1860) has been interpreted similarly. Provenance Twilight in the Wilderness was commissioned for William T. Walters. It was acquired by John Taylor Johnston in 1866, and then sold to John Work Garrett in 1876. It was inherited by his daughter Mary Garrett, and sold to family friend (and John Taylor Johnston's son-in-law) Robert de Forest. His brother Lockwood de Forest inherited it in 1931, and the painting descended through the family until sold by Lockwood's grandson in the 1960s. It was bought by the Cleveland Museum of Art in 1965.

History =Ellinge = Boshop Absalon owned a village called Ellinge at the site. He ceded it to Sor√∏ Abbey in exchange for land elsewhere and it was later passed to Roskilde bishopric. Ellinge was at some point transformed into a manor which was the centre of a relatively small fief. In 1370, it comprised two farms and 14 smallholdings. The feudal lords of the estate included Jakob Mogensen and Jep Nielsen of the Ravensberg family and then for several generations members of the Jernsk√¶g. Ellinge was confiscated by the Crown after the Reformation in 1536. It remained a fief until 1547. =Birkholm= The new owner was the Pomeranian nobleman Hans Barnekow who was at the same time recognized as Danish nobility. The agreement obliged him to settle in Denmark and take a Danish wife. He married Mette Oxe in 1550. Barnekow changed the name of the estate to Birkholm. Hans Barnekow's widow stayed on the estate after his death in 1559. She continued the process that her husband had started with concentrating the land closer to the manor. In 1582, the estate was ceded to their son Johan Barnekow Birkolm after his two elder brothers had passed away. He also inherited the family's estates on Rugen. After Johan Barnekow's death in 1603, the estates were passed on to his brother Christian Barnekow. He had studied abroad as was normal for young noblemen at the time but his grand tour had lasted an unusual 17 years. He studied at several European universities but had also visited Turkey, yuria, Egypt and Ethiopia. Christian Barnekow died in 1612. His widow Margrethe Brahe Barnekow (1584-1617) then managed the estate until their son Ove Barnekow was old enough to take over the operation following her death in 1617. Ove Barnekow died young in 1629. Hans Barnekow, who inherited the estate, sold shortly thereafter. His brother Hans Barnekow founded the Swedish branch of the Barnekow family. The next owner was Malte Juul, the owner of Jessinggaard and Maltesholm. He has previously served both as hofunker and Valet de chambre (kammerjunker) but had also been feudal lord of Christianopel (Oslo) in Norway. He became a member of rigsr√•det in 1647 but died the following year. His widow Anne Juul n√©e Ramel took over Birkholm. She outlived their only son and the estate was therefore passed on to her youngest daughter, Margrethe's husband, Mouritz Podebusk. He was one of the first men in the country to be created Baron (Freiherr) and established the Barony of Einsiedelsborg in 1676. Birkholm was not part of the barony and was instead sold to Frederik Vittinghof Scheel. He established the Barony of Scheelenborg in 1680. Vittinghof Scheel increased the size of Birkholm. After his death the estate was endowed to his son-in-law baron Schack von Brockdorff. After his death in 1731 the estate was sold in auction. It was purchased by his wife, Sophie Charlotte, who ceded it to their son, Frederik von Brockdorff. He pledged the estate in 1735 and was forced to sold in auction in 1738. =L√∏venskiold family= Herman Leopoldus Loevenskiold The buyer was Herman Leopoldus, a timber merchant and shipowner from Skien-Porsgrund in Norway. He had already purchased Aggersvold at Hjemb√¶k, in 1737. In 1738, he was ennobled under the name L√∏venskiold. He died in 1750. Severin L√∏venskiold (1777‚Äì1856) a son by his second wife, inherited Birkholm and Aggersvold as well as several iron works in Norway. Severin L√∏venskiold had served in the Royal Lige Guards and was just 24 years old appointed to konferensr√•d. In 1749 he married Magdalene Charlotte Hedevig von Numsen, a daughter of the General War Commissioner. Severin L√∏venskiold established a stamhus under the name L√∏venborg from Birkholm and Vognserup in 1766. The stamhus was turned into a barony in 1773. Jens Juel in 1772 Severin L√∏venskiold's widow, Magdalene Charlotte Hedevig von Numsen, owned the L√∏benborg estate after her husband's death in 1776. The estate was supposedly used for secret negotiations by foreign minister A.P. Bernstorff in connection with crown prince Frederick's (Frederik VI) seizure of power. In 1789, Magdalene Charlotte Hedevig von Numsen ceded L√∏venborg to her only son, Michael Herman L√∏venskiold. He implemented the agricultural reforms of the time on the estate by selling the tenant farms to the copyholders. This process was completed in 1802. L√∏venborg in 1871 Carl Michael Herman L√∏venskiold's eldest son, Carl L√∏venskiold, inherited the barony in 1807. His son, Herman L√∏venskiold, inherited the estate in 1821. He led a quiet life on the estate. He was very interested in music and several of his compositions were published under the pseudonym Fridolin Carlsen. After his death in 1877, L√∏venborg was passed on to his son Herman Frederik L√∏venskiold. The estate was the following year placed under administration by a legal guardian since L√∏venskiold was deemed mentally ill. He objected several times but in vain and ended up moving to Vejle where he made a living as a plumber. =Ahlefeldt-Laurvig= After his death in 1917, L√∏venborg was passed on to his nephew Carl L√∏venskiold. The barony was dissolved in 1921 as a result of the lensafk√∏sningsloven of 1919. Part of the land was sold off in lots to be able to pay the fee to the state and Vognserup was sold in 1921. After Carl L√∏venskiold's death in 1938, L√∏venborg was sold to count Christian Carl Ahlefeldt-Laurvig. Cultural references L√∏venborg has been used as a location in the films Komtessen paa Steenholt (1939), Jeppe p√• bjerget (1981) and Jydekompagniet (1988).

Toivo Johannes Horelli (11 October 1888 ‚Äì 28 June 1975) was a Finnish politician of the National Coalition Party. He was a member of the Parliament of Finland in 1933‚Äì1945, and the Minister of the Interior from May 1941 to March 1943. Horelli and Arno Anthoni, the director of the Finnish State Police, were responsible for the deportation of German refugees that were handed over to the Nazis in November 1942. Eight of the deported were Jews who were killed by the Gestapo.  Life  = Early life = Horelli was born in the Western Finnish municipality of Kokem√§ki to the family of Johan Fredrik M√§ki-Horelli (1844‚Äì1931) and Amanda Giers (1850‚Äì1922). His father was an uneducated farmer who represented the estate of peasants in the Diet of Finland. Horelli went to school in Pori graduating from the Pori Lyceum in 1907. He entered the University of Helsinki and earned the degree of Master of Laws in 1917. In the 1918 Finnish Civil War Horelli fought for the White Guard. After serving the provincial governments in Vyborg and H√§meenlinna, Horelli worked as a bank director in Tampere and Jyv√§skyl√§ since 1929. In the early 1930s, Horelli supported the fascist Lapua Movement, although he was not an active member, neither did he join its political successor IKL but stayed loyal to the National Coalition Party. Horelli was elected to the parliament in the 1933 election. = Wartime = Horelli became the Minister of the Interior in March 1943. He was pro-Nazi, antisemite and anti-communist. During his term, Horelli refused to handle the applications for citizenship by people of Jewish origin, and clashed with trade union leaders like Niilo W√§ll√§ri. In the fall of 1942, Horelli made a requisition for awarding the SS commander Martin Sandberger with the Order of the White Rose of Finland. In November 1942, Horelli and Arno Anthoni deported a group of refugees who had fled Germany after the 1938 Anschluss. Approximately 350 refugees had entered Finland of which some 150 were Jews. As Finland joined the war in 1941, Germany was pressing the Finnish government to hand over the Jewish refugees. The matter was discussed on Heinrich Himmler's visit in the summer of 1942, and soon Horelli and Anthony secretly ordered the deportation of 27 refugees, including 8 Jews. On 8 November 1942, they were shipped to the Estonian capital Tallinn and handed over to Gestapo. According to the documents found in the Estonian state archives, the Jews were killed just two days later. The intention was to deport all Jews, but the operation was revealed, and because of the intervention of the Social Democratic cabinet members V√§in√∂ Tanner and K.-A. Fagerholm the deportations were stopped. After the German loss in the Battle of Stalingrad, the prime minister Jukka Rangell was replaced by Edvin Linkomies in March 1943. The German-minded Horelli couldn't hold his post in the new cabinet as its main task was to make peace with the Soviet Union. He was now elected as the Second deputy speaker of the Parliament. In April 1945, the prime minister J. K. Paasikivi requested that certain persons would not stand as a candidate on the 1945 election due to their wartime action, and Horelli decided to leave the politics. = After the war = Horelli family grave in Kokem√§ki. Horelli never faced a court trial. Poland and the Western Allies wanted Horelli, Anthoni and the State Police officer Ari Kauhanen to be included on the list of war criminals, but the Soviet Union never made a claim to the Finnish government. This was most likely because the Soviets focused on persons who had committed war crimes against their citizens. Horelli only appeared in the court as a witness when Anthoni was put on trial for misconduct. Before the trial he was questioned by Otto Brusiin. Horelli refused to tell on whose initiative the Jews were deported, saying he would only answer the question in the State court. According to Brusiin, Horelli was openly antisemitic using constantly the racial slur ‚Ä≥kike‚Ä≥ (Finnish: jutku). Horelli never admitted the deportation of the Jews was based on their ethnicity. Instead, Horelli claimed that all were convicted criminals calling them ‚Ä≥saboteurs, spies and thieves‚Ä≥. However, among the deported were two children ages of 2 and 11, and only two of the Jewish adults had criminal record; one had a 10-month prison term for smuggling, and another had been fined for breaking the rationing laws. According to the Finnish immigration laws, these offenses were not a justification for deportation. Horelli worked as a bank director in Jyv√§skyl√§ until his retirement in 1951. Horelli spent his last years in Tampere and died in June 1975 at the age of 86. He is buried to a family grave in the Koomankangas Cemetery in Kokem√§ki.  Family  Horelli was married with Lempi Josefina Lehtonen (1889‚Äì1967) in 1917. The couple had two children. His brothers were the professor V√§in√∂ Horelli (1882‚Äì1973) and the physician Edvard Johan Horelli (1871‚Äì1946) who was interested in eugenics.

The park was set aside by Governor Lachlan Macquarie in 1810, first surveyed by James Meehan in 1811, and re-surveyed and significantly expanded by G. B. White in 1827. It is also known as The Great Square, Church Green and Windsor Park. The property is owned by Hawkesbury City Council. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 14 January 2011.  History  The Hawkesbury region was inhabited by the Dharug people prior to European colonisation. The riparian area along the Hawkesbury River had been a source of food for the local Aboriginal people for over 50,000 years (it is known to the Dharug as Dyarrabin' or 'Deerubbin') and, with relatively frequent floods that spread enriched alluvium throughout the surrounding land, the region was known to be an abundant and reliable resource. It was also a place with strong social and spiritual significance.Benson & Howells, 1994 Following the establishment of the colony of New South Wales, the new colonists quickly recognised the agricultural potential of the banks of the Hawkesbury River. This led to intensive farming of the area to supply food to the developing colony that was experiencing severe shortages in the early years. However, following flooding in 1799, 1800, 1806 and 1809, life for the colonists farming the flats of the Hawkesbury River was a hard one, fraught with potential devastation with any inundation of the river.Morris, Jack & Britton, 2004 Governor Macquarie founded six new towns in the countryside of New South Wales during 1810, his first year of office. Unlike the first at Liverpool, the five towns on the Upper Hawkesbury and Lower Nepean (Windsor, Richmond, Wilberforce, Pitt Town and Castlereagh) were primarily created to assist existing farmers who suffered recurrent losses on the flood-plain. The Governor intended the new towns to have some common features, including a centrally sited square. Windsor was unique among the 1810 towns in incorporating an existing government village, in the area called Green Hills. As a result, there was already a square inside the area designated for the new town, but this public area, named Thompson Square by Macquarie, was at the extreme north-east end of the town and another square was planned from the outset in a more central position within the new grid-plan. This second reserve, which Macquarie called the Great Square, evolved into McQuade Park. James Meehan, the surveyor, started to lay out the new central square on 9 January 1811. At that stage he envisaged it as occupying two whole rectangular sections in the town, constituting the link between the narrow north-east end of the town and the regular, broader grid-plan of the south-west end, set at a slight angle to the north-east part. Meehan measured the Great Square as 15 chains (300 metres) in length by 15.5 chains (310 metres) in depth, although a chain would be taken off on each of the four sides for a street of standard width.SRNSW, Reel 2622, Field Book 67, 2/4734, p.18 The square would then be reduced to 280 by 290 metres, though later surveys show the area as considerably less, at around 4 hectares (e.g., SRNSW, Map 5967 of 1835). The church and cemetery reserve in 1811 was to occupy land immediately to the north of the square, as an extension of the town grid. This is shown clearly on the 1812 plan of the town, signed by Macquarie himself.SRNSW, Map SZ 529 Meehan, most unusually, commented in his Field Book about the purpose of the Great Square. It was, he wrote, \\"intended as a Square or Open Area - as a parade or park for the use of the Town\\". The reference to \\"parade\\" refers to the military contingent stationed in the town. It is not known whether the area of the square was already cleared in 1811, but a panorama of Windsor painted in 1816 shows the area empty both of houses and of trees,Mitchell Library, State Library of NSW, PX*D 264 while the detailed vista of the town painted by Joseph Lycett in 1821-1822, which shows St Matthew's Anglican Church, confirms that no trees survived on the site of the square.McPhee, 2006, 62 It is likely that the area was used at this time for grazing, for military parades and for the occasional game of cricket between the military and the farmers. By 1827, when new plans were drawn, the area of the Square had been more than doubled and its shape was no longer rectangular. The original Square which Meehan surveyed in 1811 is shown in red hatching on the map below. The only part which remained the same by 1827 was the southern edge, along George Street, although the George Street frontage was now extended to the west to a total of about 230 metres.(1827 map, SRNSW Map SZ 526) The Square had become an irregular pentagon, and it has largely retained its 1827 dimensions. The road to Richmond flanking the west side of the square is now Hawkesbury Valley Way, which runs along William Cox's original line. On the north, turning along the front of St Matthew's Anglican Church and its rectory (the 'Glebe House') is Moses Street, and the street on the east running almost at right angles from George Street up to the rectory garden is the present Tebbutt Street.SRNSW, Map SZ 526 Although the Square was encircled by surveyed streets, the townsfolk from the populated part of the town to the north-east had by 1840 their own preferred informal pathway curving through the public space to the Anglican church and beyond to the Richmond road.SRNSW, Map 5966 The inscription by Surveyor Galloway along the path he plotted through the Square around 1840 is: \\"Line of Road now used from Windsor to the Church\\". The north- south street shown running through the Square straight to St Matthew's is an entirely notional extension of Forbes Street north of George Street. The square is on sloping ground and stumps from the early tree-felling remained a nuisance well into Queen Victoria's reign, although they did not prevent occasional use as a cricket-pitch from Macquarie's time onwards. Unlike Richmond's central reserve (Richmond Park), Windsor's square was not used for markets, which were held instead to the south of George Street. Because of its position, the square was closely associated with St Matthew's Anglican Church and by the 1840s it was regularly known as the Church Green (e.g. Sydney Herald, 5 June 1841; Votes & Proceedings, Legislative Assembly 1858, III, 445, p. 26). The 8-hectare area seems to have remained without plantings until the 1870s. By the 1840s cricket was a more regular feature on the Church Green and Aboriginal men played for the town (e.g. Windsor Express and Richmond Advertiser, 21 March 1844). In the 1860s there was a massive move in the New South Wales government to create public reserves, for public recreation either general or specific.Morris, Britton & Jack, 2004, 10 In 1868 the State government made Church Green into a Public Reserve (21 acres and 1 rod), at the same time as two hundred acres between Windsor and Richmond was gazetted as a racecourse and the much smaller (7 acres, 3 rods 37 perches) Richmond Park was created \\"for public recreation\\".NSW Government Gazette 1868, I, 1424-1425; updated in Morris, Britton & Jack, 2004, 10 No trustees were appointed at Windsor, unlike Richmond. The Municipality of Windsor was created in 1870 and in 1874 the government granted the reserve, which was still on crown land, to the Town Council. The grant was made \\"upon Trust to use the said Land as a Site for Public Recreation and for no other use or purpose whatsoever\\". The Council was responsible for making rules and regulations and for managing any structures which might be erected. There was provision for forfeiture (to the Crown) if the conditions were not met.LPMA, Vol.181 fo.31, grant 74/83 A small rectangular part of the land was in fact resumed by the Crown in 1972, the part then, and now, occupied by Windsor Bowling Club with a frontage onto Tebbutt Street. After this change took place, the crown issued a new land-grant for the remaining 8.125 hectares to the Council in August 1972.LPMA, Vol.11905 fo.19 Fulfilling the forecast of James Meehan in 1811, road alterations had already nibbled away small parts of the periphery of the reserve in 1932, 1957 and 1961.LPMA, Vol. 181 fo. 31 Before Windsor Municipal Council was given formal ownership of the land, it decided to name the reserve McQuade Park. John McQuade was mayor of the municipality in 1872. He was an ambitious local magistrate, but his father had been a transportee, who as an emancipist had established an inn in Windsor close to the Square, on the corner of Tebbutt and George Streets. John himself had built a fine house, Auburn Villa, just across Moses Street from the reserve, while his brother, William McQuade senior, lived close by, across the Richmond Road, in the old Cox house of Fairfield. On 6 June 1872 the Councillors voted to name the reserve after John McQuade and transmitted their decision to the Department of Lands, which still controlled the reserve. At the same time, the Council fenced the reserve for the first time in 1872, with a few seats for the public soon donated by individuals such as the mayor.Council Minute Book, 1872-1875, 45-46 The Council also established a Park Committee. On 16 April 1873 the Council rescinded the motion of the previous June and renamed the area Windsor Park. But the Department of Lands refused to accept this change and wrote to the Council saying that the name would remain McQuade Park. In August the Council debated the issue again and, by the casting vote of the new mayor (no friend of John McQuade), decided to abide by the name Windsor Park. In 1874 the reserve was granted formally to the Council, while John McQuade was again mayor. On his casting vote, the rescission motion of August 1873 was itself rescinded. The Council restored the name McQuade Park and erected a signpost with the new name painted in gold letters. This was promptly vandalised and in March 1878, when William Walker, the local solicitor and politician, was mayor, the Council voted to restore the name Windsor Park. Since the land was now owned in freehold by the Council, the Department of Lands did not enter into the controversy.Council Minute Books, 1872-1875, 53, 98,108-109, 203; 1875-1879, 277; Bowd, Macquarie Country, 178 It seems that the decision of 6 March 1878 has never been rescinded, so technically the name of the reserve should be Windsor Park, but the long shadow of the McQuade family seems to have ensured that the name McQuade Park has de facto acceptance. The historian of Windsor, the Revd James Steele, wrote wryly in 1916 that \\"the local park is sometimes, and sometimes not, called McQuade Park\\".Steele, Early Days of Windsor, 208 But the McQuades seem to have won the war, even if they lost the last engagement with Council in 1878. In 1874 south side of Moses Street part of park was fenced, trenched and planted with c250 trees (from Messrs. Ferguson of Camden & others); a roadway was made across water hole (formerly a bog) leaving another water hole (the present lake); the George Street entrance gravelled; a Tebbutt Street entrance was made with a circle shrubbery formed, fenced and planted; a new roadway was formed from George Street to Richmond Road with trees planted on each side, some 40' (13m) wide and parts of the park were levelled and filled in.Morris, Britton & Jack, 2004, 14 Under successive local Councils, the park evolved as a public amenity, with a variety of sporting facilities, tree plantings, memorial areas and an attractive lake. Cricket had originally been played on rather rough ground opposite St Matthew's and Cornwallis Road between the arms of the curving pathway of the 1840s. In 1891 the present cricket-pitch was created to the east on newly levelled and formed land which had previously been transected by the curving pathway. In the 1880s it was described as an \\"eyesore\\" and over 100 trees were planted around the exterior of the park. In 1897 the Hawkesbury Cricket Club was formed. Windsor Park, the home ground of Windsor Cricket Club increasingly became the rival of Richmond Park as the ground of eminence in the district. A grandstand was ultimately constructed close to Tebbutt Street in 1937, and was opened by the Minister for Works & Local Government. To meet post-war demand in 1945 a second cricket wicket was laid in concrete on the north-west part of the park for the Don't Worry Cricket Club. Golden Fleece petrol sponsored cricket by contributing advertising on the oval and Council built a sightscreen and a further turf wicket. A fountain was erected at the George Street entrance in 1891.Morris, Britton & Jack, 2004, 14, 17 Football followed cricket, but as at Richmond, though goal posts were erected in the 1890s, the game played second-best to cricket well into the twentieth century. Cycling was very popular in the late Victorian period and bicycle races were common from the 1890s onwards. Bicycle sports days became a crowd drawer and by 1900 \\"the attendance of district folk was very large\\", although a proper track was not constructed around the periphery of the park until 1945. Because Windsor Park was so large, it could accommodate a wider diversity of activity than any other Hawkesbury park. The local tennis club was formed in 1923 with its courts in the south-east area where they are still located. Night lights were introduced in 1947 and the present club-house was opened in 1987. Also during the inter-war years, the Windsor Bowling Club was allowed to form a green close to Tebbutt Street in 1931 and the relationship between the club and the Council was formalised by a lease in 1947. In 1972, however, the irregular rectangle of land leased by the Bowling Club was resumed by the crown and granted directly to the club as portion 346. Since 1972, this area has ceased to be part of the park. The Council received a new grant of the Park (reserve) excluding that section. The other body which was allowed to build in the park was the Country Women's Association, which opened its brick hall close to George Street in 1938. The park had from the outset been associated with the military. It had been envisaged as a parade ground in 1811. In 1861 the Governor Sir John Young presented colours to the state's Volunteer forces in the park (still then called the Church Green) and in 1874 the park became the official parade ground for the Windsor Volunteers. The involvement of local men and women in the Boer War was commemorated by the erection in 1903 of a fine War Memorial, with carvings by J. O'Kelly, in the south-east corner of the parkSteele, Early Days of Windsor, 144 and after World War I this was supplemented by a large War Memorial (gates), opened in 1923. This was extended to celebrate later warriors: ANZAC parades were held in the park and after World War II and subsequent engagements in Vietnam and Korea, additional honour lists were mounted on the World War I monument. Captain James Cook was remembered in 1970 by the replacement of the old swampy pond near George Street by a hard-edged ornamental lake designed by landscape architect Peter Spooner, with a small island, accessible by a pedestrian bridge. The island was originally shaded by two willow-trees, but is now treeless. The lake became the focal point of a passive recreation area in the south-west sector of the park and was attractive for wedding receptions and other parties. This guaranteed the permanence of the \\"pon hole\\", the much- loved 19th century feature of the park which resisted all attempts by Councillors over the years to fill it in or securely enclose it.Morris, Jack & Britton, 2004, 17 This is indicative of the late response to modernism in park and garden design in Australia.Morris, Jack & Britton, 2004, 21 The next historical commemoration came in 1994, when the Hawkesbury, and particularly Windsor, celebrated the two-hundredth anniversary of European settlement on this part of the river. Trees were extensively planted by Council, using donations from descendants of early families in memory of their forebears, who were named on small plaques. Although many individual trees have perished through the usual problems of maintenance, in particular the lack of consistent watering, the impact on the park was and remains considerable and, as the surviving trees grow, a wider impact will be visible. At the same time a bronze statue of Governor Macquarie was commissioned from a local sculptor, Frederic Chapeaux, who completed the work but died before his bronze casting was erected late in 1994 opposite St Matthew's Church. It was installed in a sandstone setting designed by local architect, Robert Pont.SMorris, Jack & Britton, 2004, 17 Further works in this part of the park were installed in 2010 as part of the bicentenary commemoration of Governor Macquarie.  Description  McQuade Park occupies an irregular pentagon. The east and south sides of Macquarie's original rectangular Great Square are still part of the park, along most of the frontage to Tebbutt Street and part of the frontage to George Street. The western side of the park is bounded by Hawkesbury Valley Way (known as Richmond Road until 2009). The two northerly sides of the park are bounded by the dog-leg of Moses Street. Team sport dominates the northern sector of the park today. There are two ovals, primarily used for cricket. The principal playing field, with a grandstand, car-parking and amenities, is on the east, with a vehicular entry from Tebbutt Street. The playing area is delimited by a white picket fence installed early in the twenty-first century as the result of an initiative of the local Rotary Club. The other cricket pitch, known as the Don't Worry field, lies to the west and has no amenities. Between the two ovals there is a memorial area, created in 1994. The central feature is Frederic Chepeaux's bronze statue of Governor Macquarie, standing at a stone plinth, facing St Matthew's Anglican Church and looking at plans of his Hawkesbury towns. The raised entry to the statue from Moses Street is flanked by eight pillars made of red brick and a triangular area in which a mosaic will be set late in 2010. Around the statue there is a low circular brick wall encompassed by a hedge planted at ground level below the artificial platform. To the south of the grandstand there is a playground and bandstand. The south-west sector of the park is used primarily for passive recreation around the lake close to George Street. This hard-edged free-form pond, normally adorned with water-lilies, is a modern development of the natural feature of a swampy area fed by a spring and a seasonal waterway. A small, grassy island, reached by a short pedestrian bridge, has been created in the northern part of the pond. Immediately to the east of the pond, accessed from George Street, is the Country Women's Association meeting hall, an inter-war brick cottage within a small rectangular enclosure. To the east of this hall is the Tennis Clubhouse and courts in a square area, also accessed from George Street. To the north and north-east of the tennis courts is Windsor Bowling Club, with its clubhouse and two greens on a rectangular block of land, but this was excised from the park in 1972. The south-east corner of the park, in a square enclosure bounded by George and Tebbutt Streets, is called Memorial Park, dedicated to war memorials. It is entered through an opening between two high brick walls bearing granite plaques which commemorate those who fought in the two world wars, in Vietnam and in Korea. Behind each wall is a field-gun. The square beyond is a formally laid-out garden around the very fine Boer War Memorial. This consists of a marble obelisk, placed on a sandstone plinth, dedicated to the three local men who died while serving in the Boer War. The stone section contains two fine relief carvings, each of a mounted trooper, carved by J. O'Kelly. A local female nurse who also served in South Africa is separately commemorated by a marble plaque placed on the perimeter of the small circular area around the obelisk. Five Lagerstroemia indica (crepe myrtle trees) are planted around the Boer War Memorial on the park's north- east corner. The major trees in McQuade Park, however, are clustered around the periphery and are narrow leaved ironbark (Eucalyptus crebra). The three surviving bunya pines (Araucaria bidwillii) are located on Moses Street opposite the Anglican church hall and on the corner of Moses Street and Tebbutt Street. A variety of other trees which are probably nineteenth- or early twentieth-century plantings are prominent along Moses Street, the northern part of Tebbutt Street and at the corner of Moses Street and Hawkesbury Valley Way. The species include Pinus pinea (stone pine)(2), Monterey pine (Pinus radiata)(1) and Melia azedarach var.australasica (white cedar). Other younger tree plantings include kurrajong (Brachychiton populneum), crepe myrtles, Chinese elms (Ulmus parvifolia), silky oak (Grevillea robusta), sweet gum (Liquidambar styraciflua), paperbark (Melaleuca sp.), turpentine (Syncarpia glomulifera) and bottle brush (Callistemon viminalis). The principal areas of later tree-plantings are along a driveway which runs diagonally across the Park, south-east from Hawkesbury Valley Way, above the pond, and then turns south to George St between the CWA hall and the tennis courts. There is also a tree shield between the lake and Hawkesbury Valley Way. Many, but by no means all, of these more recent plantings commemorate individual \\"pioneers\\", a programme initiated during the 1994 celebrations of two hundred years of European settlement along the Upper Hawkesbury. Because of the lack of built elements within the park along Moses St, the original relationship of the Great Square with the Anglican complex of St Matthew's and its rectory has remained highly legible. The Park has seen many changes over 200 years, in vegetation, in surfaces and in built features. The present fabric is well maintained and reflects well the various stages of the Park's usage. Although some of these changes will be represented in archaeological deposits, it is not considered that the potential for meaningful archaeological excavation is high. The oldest parts of the built environment, the two war memorials, are in excellent condition, and the more recent additions are well maintained. The general character of the Great Square of Governor Macquarie is in essential features remarkably intact. = Modifications and dates = The history of McQuade Park is one of regular modification over two centuries. These changes are documented in the historical outline below. The principal changes in the built environment are: * 1811 definition of the 'square' * enlargement of reserve to its present size (more than double its 1811 size and no longer rectangular); * 1874 south side of Moses Street part of park fenced, trenched and planted with c250 trees (from Mr.Ferguson of Camden & others); roadway made across water hole (formerly a bog) leaving another water hole (the present lake); George Street entrance gravelled; ?Tebbutt Street entrance made with circle shrubbery formed, fenced and planted; roadway from George Street to Richmond Road formed with trees planted on each side, some 40' (13m) wide; parts of park levelled and filled in; * 1891 formal creation (levelled and formed) of present cricket oval; over 100 trees planted around exterior of park; * 1903 Boer War Memorial; * 1923 World War I Memorial; first tennis courts; * 1931 bowling green built; * 1932: road widening resumption part of reserve edges; * 1937 grandstand; * 1938 Country Women's Association hall opened; * 1945 creation of Don't Worry cricket oval's concrete wicket; * 1957 road widening resumption part of reserve edges; * 1961 road widening resumption part of reserve edges; * 1970 part of reserve resumed by the Crown - portion 346 fronting Tebbutt Street, for the Bowling Club tenancy; * 1972 removal of Windsor Bowling Club land from park; re-issue of remaining 8.125 ha of reserve grant to Council; * 1987 opening of present tennis club-house; * 1994 statue of Governor Macquarie; planting of trees in commemoration of European pioneer settlers.  Heritage listing  McQuade Park is of State heritage significance because it is an outstanding and rare feature of Governor Macquarie's concept of a planned country town in 1810. A central square played a pivotal role in a Macquarie town and McQuade Park retains this role in relation to public activities and open space, as well as its relationship to one of the great early churches and cemeteries of New South Wales (St Matthews). The intimate association with Macquarie himself and with his chief surveyor, James Meehan, is of state significance. The early adjustment in the shape and dimensions of the park is significant because it offers uncommonly legible evidence of the accommodations which colonial governments made with landowners to respect existing rights. The later extensions of functions within the park, including sporting, recreational and commemorative, have not obscured the original purpose of Macquarie's Great Square, though many of these additional functions have local rather than state significance. The Boer War Memorial is, however, an exception because of its rarity and because of the aesthetic merit of O'Kelly's carvings of mounted troopers from the South African engagement. McQuade Park was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 14 January 2011 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. McQuade Park is of State Historical significance because it is a powerful testimony to the first stage of formal town-planning in New South Wales. The expanse of open green space in the centre of Governor Macquarie's most significant Hawkesbury town has survived and been expanded over two centuries and is still today an essential historic asset for public recreation, both sporting and passive. Its deliberate siting adjacent to the iconic Anglican Church of St Matthew and cemetery enhances the state significance of both park and church and cemetery. The change in shape of the reserve from the original simple rectangle surveyed by James Meehan was a conscious historical act which demonstrates more forcibly than elsewhere among Macquarie's new towns the tensions which might exist between a newly planned town and the boundaries of existing land-holdings. The complex pentagon is the result of a series of adjustments to recognise property \\"lines\\". The boundaries of McQuade Park are of state significance as a rare visible expression of these accommodations between colonial governments and landowners. The sporting potential of the substantial area of the reserve was largely realised after the area was transferred to the ownership of the local government authority in 1874. The establishment of formal ovals and tennis courts are of local significance. The park was the chosen site for Windsor's memorials to those who fell or otherwise served in external wars. The Boer War memorial is notable at the state level because of its rarity and its quality of presentation, especially shown in the two stone relief carvings of mounted troopers. The later, more grandiose, memorial erected after World War I and reused to commemorate subsequent campaigns, is of high local significance. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. McQuade Park has State associational significance because of its direct association with Governor Macquarie. The plan of Windsor drawn up in 1812 by the ex-convict surveyor, James Meehan, himself a figure of state significance, was signed, twice over, by Macquarie, who had personally selected the location of the Anglican church and the adjacent reserve. The bronze statue of Macquarie, erected in the park in 1994, is a signal recognition of this association. The McQuade family after whom the park was named in a highly political and contested manoeuvre in the 1870s was significant not only in Windsor but also in Sydney. This association does not, however, meet this criterion at more than the local level. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. McQuade Park has aesthetic/technical State significance because of the high aesthetic values of the Boer War memorial with its O'Kelly carvings and its surrounding formal garden. The park as a whole with its extensive tree-plantings is an attractive and necessary adornment to the town, but the diffuseness of the multi-purpose planning of the modern park does not in itself qualify for significance at the state level. The park's extent and open nature are critical to, and form the green heart of modern Windsor and a crucial setting for St.Matthews Church, cemetery and Manse along with other key buildings facing it. McQuade Park has locally significant aesthetic value because its form and elements illustrate most of the uses to which an early town square might be put over a long period, including sports, passive recreation, public celebration and the commemoration of external wars. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. McQuade Park has State social significance because the residents of the Windsor area have chosen the park as the place to plant trees in commemoration of early European settlers and as the location for a succession of war memorials and the important statue of Governor Macquarie. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. McQuade Park has rarity value at State level because it is an exceptional example of the small number of town squares which survive and fulfil their original function in the eight country towns founded and planned by Governor Macquarie. The Boer War was commemorated by only a few public monuments throughout New South Wales and the fine example in McQuade Park is of state significance. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. McQuade Park has State significant representative value because it illustrates most of the uses to which an early town square might be put over a long period, including sport of various kinds, passive recreation, public celebration and the commemoration of those who served in external wars.

Common names include mulberry weed, crabweed, or hairy crabweed. It has become an invasive species in the Eastern United States where it grows in disturbed areas such as flowerbeds, greenhouses, and agricultural fields. Description Flower head of Fatoua villosa showing pistillate and staminate flowers. F. villosa is an annual herb which reproduces via seed. The entire plant is covered in both glandular and recurved hairs giving the plant a sticky feeling to the touch. The leaves resemble the leaves of mulberry giving rise to the common name of mulberry-weed. The leaves are heart shaped and up to 10cm long with a crenate leaf margin. At the base of each leaf is a pair of stipules. It is a monoecious plant meaning that it has separate male and female flowers on the same plant. The male and female flowers are aggregated into axillary clusters. The fruit is single seeded and explosively shoots the seed up to several meters. Invasive Fatoua villosa growing in a typical habitat such as a weedy flowerbed Mulberry weed has been collected extensively in flowerbeds and greenhouses which strongly suggests that the plant is spread via horticultural material. It was first reported in Louisiana in 1964 and has since spread as far north as Michigan and Massachusetts and as far west as California. It will likely continue to spread and may become more invasive.

The other Brigade areas were in Derry City, south County Londonderry and County Armagh, with smaller units in Newry, east and west County Tyrone and south County Fermanagh.Jack Holland & Henry Mcdonad - INLA: Deadly Divisions p.62 Formation The Irish National Liberation Army Belfast Brigade or simply INLA Belfast Brigade was a unit of the Irish Republican and Socialist Paramilitary organization the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) that was based in Belfast. Along with the INLA's Derry and Armagh brigades the Belfast INLA was one of the most active in the organization during its 24 year paramilitary campaign. It was formed in 1975, a few months after the Irish National Liberation Army and the groups political wing the Irish Republican Socialist Party (IRSP) were themselves formed in Dublin in 1974 by the groups' leader Seamus Costello and his supporters. The INLA and IRSP were formed when Volunteers in the Official IRA (OIRA) left that group as they were frustrated with the progress it was making and the OIRA's 1972 ceasefire. Activity & actions The INLA Belfast Brigade's first actions were feuding with the Official IRA. Dissenters had left the group early in 1974 lead by Paul Tinnelly (who formed the short lived Tinnelly Brigade) and the OIRA moved quickly to crush that group and met little resistance.Jack Holland & Henry McDonald - INLA: Deadly Divisions pg.68 They hoped to do the same with the newly formed INLA who used the covername People's Liberation Army (PLA) in its first few months. The OIRA met more stronger resistance from the INLA than they did with any other dissenters. Most of the OIRA/INLA feud was played out in Belfast. Six people were killed in the feud and several others injured, mainly from the OIRA. The highest profile victim of the feud was Official IRA Belfast Brigade OC Billy McMillen who was rumored to have been killed by Gerard Steenson and Brendan McNamee (a former Provisional IRA volunteer) at Dunlewy Street near the Falls Road. INLA Volunteers also tried to kill Official IRA member and veteran Republican Sean Garland. He was seriously injured in an INLA attack in Dublin on 13 March 1975 by Volunteers from the INLA Belfast Brigade. The attacks on McMillen and Garland were not sanctioned by the INLA Army Council and INLA Chief of Staff Seamus Costello was reportedly furious when he heard the news of the attacks. The Belfast Brigade staff believed that since it was the one directly under attack from the OIRA that it should decide when and whom to attack, not the INLA leadership which was based in Dublin and not under threat from the feud.Jack Holland & Henry McDonald - INLA: Deadly Divisions pg.52, 68 McNamee who helped kill McMillen was himself shot dead soon after by the OIRA in Suffolk, Belfast. The feud between the OIRA and INLA ended soon after this killing when a truce was agreed upon. IRSP/INLA Plot in Milltown Cemetery, West Belfast, The brigade's first action against a member of the British security forces occurred on the 9 August 1975 when Belfast INLA units injured two soldiers from the British Army: the first attack in Ballymurphy a sniper shot a soldier in the neck and the second along the Lower Falls a soldier suffered a serious head injury. There was an attack on soldiers in Divis Flats as well but the unit claimed no hits.Jack Holland & Henry McDonald - INLA: Deadly Divisions pg.82 It wasn't until a year later that the brigade killed a member of the British Army in the Turf Lodge area of Belfast when a sniper shot dead private Andrew Crocker who was shot in the neck and died the next day.Jack Holland & Henry McDonald - INLA: Deadly Divisions pg.82, pg.359 In September 1976 however the INLA was accused of a double sectarian murder when Volunteers from the Belfast brigade shot dead two Protestant civilians at their home in Ormonde Park, Finaghy. The INLA claimed it was a case of mistaken identity. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the INLA developed into a modestly large urban guerrilla organisation in Northern Ireland, operating primarily from the Divis Flats in west Belfast, which, as a result, became colloquially known as \\"the planet of the Irps\\" (a reference to the IRSP and the film Planet of the Apes).The Lost Revolution: The Story of the Official IRA and the Workers' Party, Brian Hanley and Scott Millar, Penguin Books, p. 290 The brigade went through a number of leaders in its first year but its first full-time Officer commanding (OC) was Ronnie Bunting whose father was Ulster Loyalist politician and British Army Major Ronald Bunting who was a follower of Ian Paisley. The Belfast INLA was the most active operational area of the INLA, and their capabilities were enhanced after obtaining a number of AK47s from the Middle East via a connection with the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in 1978. which were first used by the Belfast INLA in August 1978, injuring a number of British soldiers.Jack Holland & Henry McDonald - INLA: Deadly Divisions pg.130,360 After Bunting was shot dead along with an IRSP member by the UDA in 1980, Gerard Steenson became OC of the INLA in Belfast. Steenson was OC from 1980 - 1983. Around the same time period Jimmy Brown (Irish republican) became the brigades Intelligence officer (I/O).Jack Holland & Henry McDonald - INLA: Deadly Divisions (Updated edition) pg.259 This was the most active period in the INLA's history. Both Steenson & Brown would later go on to form the IPLO & attack their former comrades in the INLA. In September 1982 an INLA unit detonated a bomb in Divis Flats aimed at killing British soldiers but instead killed two young local boys aged 14 & 12 and a British soldier.https://cain.ulster.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch82.htm#16982https://cain.ulster.ac.uk/cgi- bin/dyndeaths.pl?querytype=date&day;=16&month;=09&year;=1982 This bombing prompted an angry response from residents of the Divis Flats, and about 200 women held a protest march at the IRSP's offices on the Falls Road.Jack Holland & Henry McDonald - INLA: Deadly Divisions (Updated edition) pg.259, 260 Eleven days after the Divis Flats bombing an INLA unit carried out another bomb attack against the British Army in west Belfast, this time killing a British soldier with a booby-trapped bomb attached to a security gate.https://cain.ulster.ac.uk/sutton/chron/1982.html After this attack the INLA warned that it would increase its bombing attacks on British security forces.Jack Holland & Henry McDonald - INLA: Deadly Divisions (Updated edition) pg.261 Steenson was arrested and convicted along with several other members of the INLA in Belfast during the Supergrass trials of the 1980s. Tom McCartan a close friend of then INLA Chief of Staff Dominic McGlinchey (who had been arrested by Garda√≠ in the Republic following a lengthy and widely- publicised manhunt) became OC of the Belfast INLA. It was during this period while McCartan was OC that the Belfast INLA moved into extortion and racketeering, damaging what popular support they had in the city. On the 15 June 1984 Paul \\"Bonanza\\" McCann, one of the INLA's most active members in Belfast, a Staff Officer and a opponent of Tom McCartan's leadership, was surrounded by a RUC unit in a Lenadoon flat in west Belfast along with three other INLA volunteers, one of whom was future INLA leader Gino Gallagher. McCann was armed with an AK47 that he stole from a OIRA arms dump. Three of the INLA volunteers, including Gallagher gave themselves up, as three RUC officers tried to enter the flat McCann hit them with a burst of automatic fire, badly injuring two & killing a third RUC man Michael Todd (22), McCann was also dead hit by a ricocheting bullet from his AK47.https://cain.ulster.ac.uk/cgi-bin/dyndeaths.pl? querytype=date&day;=15&month;=06&year;=1984 The INLA paid tribute to McCann saying he was \\"one of the finest soldiers ever to fight for national liberation & socialism\\".Irish News, 19 June 1984 McCann was the brother of Sinn Fein councillor Francis McCann. At Paul \\"Bonanza\\" McCann's funeral his coffin was carried by then Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams.Jack Holland & Henry McDonald, INLA: Deadly Divisions (1994) pg.256,363 & INLA unit (2 men & a woman) fired a volley of shots over his coffin. The INLA Belfast lost direction in the mid 80's and a feud with the newly created Irish People's Liberation Organisation (IPLO) weakened the group further. The IPLO was formed by former INLA members Gerard Steenson and the new group's leader Jimmy Brown. Hugh Torney became OC of the INLA in Belfast during the feud, narrowly surviving an ambush ordered by Steenson in which senior INLA men John O'Reilly and Thomas 'Ta' Power were killed. A few months later Torney was responsible for an ambush in Belfast which resulted in the death of Steenson along with another IPLO member. During the late 1980s to the early 1990s the INLA barely existed as a coherent paramilitary force. It wasn't until the early-mid 90s that the Belfast INLA began carrying out paramilitary attacks again. It is believed Gino Gallagher was in charge of the brigade staff during this period. In 1992 the INLA shot and seriously wounded several Protestant civilians in Belfast, usually claiming afterwards they were loyalists.Fortnight Magazine, Issue 306, p. 28-29. Fortnight Publications, 1992.Sunday Tribune, 4 October 1992.https://cain.ulster.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch92.htm#101292 CAIN: A Chronology of the Conflict - 1992 - Thursday 10 December 1992: The Irish National Liberation Army (INLA) carried out a gun attack and wounded a man who worked for Belfast City Council. In January 1993 the brigade shot and seriously injured leading UVF member John \\"Bunter\\" Graham at his house on the Shankill Road. Later that same month the brigade shot dead a Protestant civilian in what the INLA claimed was a case of mistaken identity. Throughout 1992 and 1993 the INLA was responsible for sporadic gun attacks on British security forces in Belfast,Sunday Life 27 December 1992. injuring an RUC officer in August 1993 after INLA members opened fire from a hijacked vehicle at Grosvenor Road RUC station. Liverpool Echo, 24 August 1993. In June 1993 the INLA shot dead a former RUC officer in a hotel in Belfast. On at least two occasions the INLA also tried to kill off-duty members of the Royal Irish Regiment, although the RUC denied one man left with serious injuries after an attack at his home in Dunmurray was a member of the regiment.Irish Independent, 21 July 1993. In September and October 1993 as loyalist paramilitary attacks on the nationalist community intensified the INLA made several attempts to assassinate senior members of the UDA, including Johnny Adair; three INLA gunmen were intercepted and arrested by the RUC near his home in the Shankill area of Belfast.Irish Independent, 22 October 1993.Malcolm Sutton's Index of Deaths from the Conflict in Ireland: 1993. Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN). In February 1994 the INLA shot dead a Protestant doorman Jack Smyth, at the entrance to Bob Cratchits Bar, Lisburn Road, Belfast. The INLA claimed he was linked to the UDA/UFF, but this was denied. In April 1994 the INLA shot dead a member of the UDA, Gerald Evans, at his fishing tackle shop in Glengormley, County Antrim. Six days later the INLA shot dead a civilian, Thomas Douglas, outside his workplace, Northern Ireland Electricity Headquarters, Stranmillis Road, Belfast. The INLA claimed he was a high-ranking loyalist but CAIN lists Douglas as a civilian. The INLA's deadliest attack of the 1990s was the 1994 Shankill Road Killings when Volunteers shot dead three UVF members on the Shankill road including leading UVF man Trevor King. It was alleged that Gino Gallagher carried out the ambush on the orders of Hugh Torney.Malcolm Sutton's Index of Deaths from the Conflict in Ireland: 1994. Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN). Another internal INLA feud broke out in 1996. Both Hugh Torney and Gino Gallagher claimed to be the legitimate leaders of the INLA. The Torney faction was known as INLA-GHQ and the Gallagher faction as the INLA Army Council. During 1996 the feud claimed the lives of six people, including a nine-year-old girl who was shot by mistake by the Army Council faction in north Belfast. The first victim in the feud was Gino Gallagher who was shot dead in a Social Security Office on the Falls Road in January. The last victim was Hugh Torney shot dead in Lurgan on the 3 September 1996, this killing brought the feud to an end and the Torney GHQ faction disbanded on the 9 September 1996. Around this time the INLA adopted a \\"no first strike\\" policy. This meant in theory that the INLA would not attack anybody unless they were attacked first in which case the INLA would hit back to defend itself from a threat. It claimed it was now only involved in a defensive campaign and to defend Nationalists from loyalist attacks. In 1997 the INLA Belfast Brigade became active once again. In May of that year they shot dead an off-duty RUC officer Darren Bradshaw as he drank in a gay bar in Belfast's Docks area. During the large-scale rioting in Nationalist areas of Northern Ireland following the 1997 Drumcree march an INLA unit opened fire on British soldiers on patrol in Ardoyne, north Belfast. On 25 September 1997 two INLA units one in south Belfast and the other in west Belfast threw grenades at RUC stations, both of the devices failed to explode. On 27 December 1997 in one of the INLA's most infamous actions, INLA Belfast man Christopher \\"Crip\\" McWilliams shot dead Billy Wright the leader of the loyalist paramilitary the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) inside the Maze prison while Wright was being transferred to another part of the prison in a van. In January 1998 the INLA Belfast Brigade shot dead UDA leader Jim Guiney in his carpet shop in Dunmurry. The INLA said the killing was in revenge for the recent killings of Irish Nationalists killed by loyalists. In April the INLA shot dead one of their own Volunteers and father of five Mark McNeill. It is not clear why the killing occurred but it was speculated that the killing was a \\"grudge killing\\" or that it might have been a drug related killing. In its last action before they called a ceasefire the INLA Belfast Brigade on 13 July 1998 left two incendiary devices in the Ballynafeigh Orange Hall in which the British security services carried out controlled explosions on the suspect devices. A month later on 24 August 1998 the INLA announced a ceasefire.

The new Toyosu Market cost $5 billion to build. The long-anticipated move to the new market was scheduled to take place in November 2016, in preparation for the 2020 Summer Olympics, but on August 31, 2016, the move was postponed. There had been concerns that the new location was heavily polluted and needed to be cleaned up, Osumi, Magdalena Tsukiji workers demand answers over toxic soil at new site Feb 22, 2016 The Japan Times Retrieved February 23, 2016 and toxic substances were discovered in the soil and groundwater at Toyosu, due to the gas plant that was previously located on the property. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government spent an additional 3.8 billion yen ($33.5 million) to pump out groundwater by digging hundreds of wells. In June 2017, plans to move the fish market were restarted, but delayed in July to the autumn of 2018. After the new site was declared safe following a cleanup operation, the opening date of the new market was set for 11 October 2018. The grand opening was on 11 October 2018. It opened to the general public on 13 October 2018. In Tsukiji there are plans to retain a retail market, roughly a quarter of the current operation, and the remaining area of the market will be redeveloped.Ito, Masami, \\"Tsukiji countdown: clock ticking on famed fish market\\", Japan Times, 1 November 2015, p. 14 During the first auction of Toyosu Market on January 5th, 2019, businessman Kiyoshi Kimura, president of Kiyomura Corp which operates the Sushi-Zanmai chain, paid a record highest bid of 333.6 million yen ($3.08 million) for a 278 kilogram (612 pound) Pacific bluefin tuna. The next year, again on 5 January, Kimura paid 193.2 million yen ($1.79 million) for a 276 kilogram bluefin tuna. This tuna was caught near ≈åma, Aomori Prefecture. Facility The new market is housed in a state-of-the-art complex, ensuring sterility and good hygiene. There are 3 markets: a wholesale market for consumers, an auction market, and a fruit and vegetable market. There are about 40 food stalls in the wholesale fish buildings, most of which are located above the market, and accessible to visitors. The new complex also includes a large rooftop terrace with lawns. Nikken Sekkei designed the Fishery Naka Wholesale Building, Fishery Wholesale Building, and Fruit and Vegetable Building. At , Toyosu Market is almost twice the size of the old Tsukiji fish market. Unlike the previous Tsukiji fish market, the public cannot attend the auction at floor level among buyers. Instead, visitors can watch the market from a second floor viewing deck or, upon registration, from a room at the same level separated from the auction by a window. There is a shrine titled Uogashi Suijinja (shrine for a fish market on the shore) at the corner of the Toyosu buildings near the waterfront.

Early life  John Leigh was born on 8 June 1812, probably at Foxdenton Hall in Chadderton but possibly in Liverpool. His father, Thomas, was a druggist and tea-dealer from Ashton-under-Lyne, whilst his mother, Hannah, came from Saddleworth. John said he was related to an ancient Cheshire family, the Leighs of West Hall, and thus also with the Earl of Bridgewater, but doubt has been cast on these claims. Leigh attended a school associated with Dukinfield Moravian Church and then pursued a career in medicine, being initially apprenticed to a doctor in Ashbourne, Derbyshire. From 1831, he studied at Thomas Turner's Pine Street medical school in Manchester and at Guy's Hospital, London, as well as working for a period as a clerk at the Manchester Infirmary. Possessed of much ability, Leigh was training other medical students and successfully proposing them for their professional qualifications before achieving his own qualification as a Member of the Royal College of Surgeons. After qualifying, he had an extensive private medical practice in Manchester until 1868 and worked as a resident medical officer at the Infirmary. He also held chairs in Chemistry and Forensic Medicine at the Pine Street School and also at one located on Marsden Street in the city, which eventually amalgamated to form the Manchester Royal School of Medicine. He was also a Registrar for births, marriages and deaths at this time.  Chemist  Manchester was one of the first towns to use coal gas extensively and Leigh, who became a Fellow of the Chemical Society, was employed as a chemical analyst by the municipally-owned Manchester Gas Works, perhaps beginning in 1837. Manufacture of coal gas was not a trivial undertaking, requiring analysis of the raw material and of methods of chemical purification and extraction. The purpose of Leigh's work was to enable production of a high-quality gas suitable for use in illumination and to prevent emission of noxious fumes and by-products. He developed a considerable expertise, presenting papers on the subject of gas analysis to learned societies such as the British Association and, in 1863, patenting a process for the extraction of benzole from coal gas.  Interest in public health  The professional interest in gas analysis, prior experiences at the Manchester Infirmary, where he often saw damaged lungs, and the publication of Edwin Chadwick's The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population in 1842 caused Leigh to take an interest in public health. From the 1840s, he proposed that the high incidence of respiratory disease in Manchester, compared to other areas of England, was due to the city's poor air quality and that this was largely attributable to the extensive use of coal as fuel in what was the first industrial city. Charles James Napier had described Manchester as \\"the chimney of the world\\" in 1839 and a near-contemporary study of deaths in the city between 1840-42 blamed \\"diseases of the windpipe and chest\\" as the major causes, accounting for nearly 30 per cent of all fatalities and blaming the smoke-filled air in particular for poor health among children. Leigh believed that the level of harmful particulates in the air needed to be reduced and he also thought it necessary to ensure better- quality food and better ventilation of homes. The tendency of city officials throughout the century was to rely on the goodwill of manufacturers to achieve improvements in air quality rather than the blunt instrument of prosecution. Although Leigh did not subscribe to a commonly held belief that smoke from burning coal had purifying properties, he did generally appear to accept the popular miasma theory as an explanation for transmission of diseases. The theory was that bad smells from rotting organic matter, excrement and similar were the cause of transmission, rather than the microbes that found a breeding-ground in such an environment. While germ theory was gaining ground as an alternate proposition, Leigh did not mention it in any of his annual reports until 1887 and even on that occasion he qualified his support. Leigh's position was not uncommon: during the period that he was active in civic life, policy both nationally and locally was influenced more by the miasma theory than germ theory and so concentrated more on matters relating to sanitation than, say, immunisation. It was the era of the Health of Towns Association, the first local boards of health and the reformist bodies such as the Manchester and Salford Sanitary Association and the Manchester Statistical Society, although the city elders of Manchester - a \\"self-perpetuating inner circle of big merchants, manufacturers and landlords\\", according to Platt - had been reluctant to accept early government initiatives such as the 1848 Public Health Act. Sir Robert Rawlinson, a noted sanitarian and engineer of the time, described how public policy in Manchester had affected the city's rivers by the 1840s: Leigh became recognised locally as an expert in matters relating to chemistry as applicable to civic administration. His ability to analyse manufacturing processes caused him to be consulted by the council when they were attempting to educate industrialists and enforce smoke abatement measures. In 1850, he co-authored A History of the Cholera in Manchester in 1849, the aims of which have been described by Robert Kargon, a historian of science, as \\"nothing less than the scientific assessment of disease and the public health measures taken against it.\\" To that end, he not merely attempted to document the outbreak of cholera itself but also the environmental context in which it occurred. He attempted to map the progress of the disease from one area to another and he tested various theories of probable cause. After rejecting suggestions that the cause may have lain in, for example, a deficiency of \\"atmospheric electricity\\" or the amount of ozone in the air, the conclusions drawn were that the outbreak had been mostly restricted to areas where the standards of sanitation were particularly poor, although it was at pains to point out that those standards existed both before and after the outbreak and thus could not in themselves have caused it. While movement of infected people from one place to another seemed to explain how the disease was introduced from affected areas to previously unaffected locations, often at a relatively large distance, the study suggested that direct contact with a carrier was not necessary for propagation. Kargon quotes from the study: In 1859, Leigh was a member of a Nuisance Committee that examined air pollution caused by manufacturers in the Ardwick area and which was considered to have had success in improving the situation. All of these various efforts, and more, garnered Leigh a reputation for an investigative, analytical mind and an expertise in medicine and chemistry. They qualified him for appointment as Manchester's first Medical Officer of Health, responsible for matters relating to public health, but an initial proposal to that effect by the city council's General Purposes committee in 1867 was challenged by in general council discussion. A subsequent formal recruitment process led by another committee resulted in a recommendation in March 1868 to appoint a different applicant but the aldermen over-ruled again, this time preferring Leigh to the proposed candidate. Kargon believes that Leigh's abilities and reputation as a scientist, in particular, were thought to be superior and carried the day but Harry L. Platt says that the aldermen were intent on minimising the cost of local government and that Leigh's appointment on a part-time basis was preferred because, as an existing employee, it would entail no additional salary. He says that a series of increasingly disastrous floods of the rivers Irk, Irwell and Medlock from the 1840s had resulted in large part from the council's unwillingness to charge the public purse in the cause of environmental improvements and that, after the floods of 1866, their hand was forced in large part because of the increased concern of death from cholera. Fear of epidemic and reaction to emergencies were, according to the historian Anthony Wohl, the cause of rebalancing an official mindset that was general based on \\"corruption, lethargy, innate conservatism ... and parsimony.\\"  Medical Officer for Health  Platt describes Leigh as being \\"compliant\\" but not uncritical of the city that employed him. Although Manchester was considered to be a leader in efforts relating to smoke abatement, often acting in advance of national legislative measures, Leigh's reports as Medical Officer for Health were unremitting in their criticism of air quality. He drew attention to and demanded vigorous action against smoke and other emissions, which he noted caused not only respiratory disease but also, for example, limited the impact of sunlight and thus exacerbated rickets and depression. Despite a zealous personal desire for eradication and the emergence between 1870-1888 of a range of pressure groups in Manchester that sought abatement of emissions, the official belief throughout the century was that the nuisance was in fact being reduced. Leigh's 1883 report supported this in noting a visible reduction in smoke density resulting from greater regulation and the deployment of more inspectors, although quantitative measurements were rare and the belief of success was thus mostly subjective. Bowler and Brimblecombe say that, despite the history of progressive efforts by the civic authorities on this issue, abatement measures could not keep up with the rapid development of the town, whose industrial expansion had continued apace and whose population had grown from 70,000 to 243,000 between 1801-1841 alone. There was little scientific monitoring of smoke levels. Leigh also supported the promotion of public baths, believing like many of his contemporary social reformers, that if people had the opportunity to improve their cleanliness then that would in turn aid improvement of their moral and social behaviour.  Other interests  Leigh held other scientific interests, notably in botany and geology, and both shared and developed these in his close friendship with Edward William Binney and with other prominent members of the Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society, such as John Davies, James Prescott Joule and William Sturgeon. He also published a volume of poetry, Sir Percy Legh: a legend of Lyme, and other ballads, in 1861, and wrote Lays and Legends of Cheshire.  Death  Leigh was still the incumbent Medical Officer at the time of his death from cardiac disease at his home in Hale Barns, Cheshire, on 11 November 1888. He was buried nearby, at Timperley, four days later. He had moved to the Manchester suburb of Whalley Range upon being appointed Medical Officer in 1868 and then relocated to a newbuild tudor-style mansion, named Manor House, in 1879. A first marriage, to Marianne Goodwin on 29 August 1840, ended with his wife's death in 1847; he then married Elizabeth Collier on 11 October 1848 and she survived until 1891. He had a son and a daughter from his first marriage, and a further two daughters and three sons from his second. One son predeceased him and it seems that the surviving male children were excluded from his will.

Education is the equipping of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, habits, and attitudes with learning experiences. The education system is an ecosystem of professionals in educational institutions, such as government ministries, unions, statutory boards, agencies, and schools. The education system consists of political heads, principals, teaching staff, non-teaching staff, administrative personnel and other educational professionals working together to enrich and enhance. At all levels of the educational ecosystem, management is required; management involves the planning, organising, implementation, review, evaluation, and integration of an institution. Educational management is related to Henri Fayol's 14 Principles of Management.. Educational Management is a goal oriented activity. It involves group efforts and an organized work and performance towards the attainment of certain pre - determined goals in an educational institution. With active coordinated effort we can achieve the goals of the organization, by efficiently utilizing the material and human resources in the educational environment (Bindu D,2019)https://www.slideshare.net/secret/1YGeGzRQT3qf4f.  Scope  = Co- curricular activities = Co-curricular activities help students maintain a holistic education, expressing their interests and talents. The activities help foster a sense of social integration, and add a sense of commitment and belonging to one's community and country. Co-curricular activities include science-oriented talent-development programmes, clubs and societies, sports, uniformed groups, and visual- and performing-arts groups. Co-curricular activities may also include advocacy, botany, personal-care, innovation, research-methodology and current-affairs groups. = Curriculum planning and development = Curriculum planning and development involves \\"the design and development of integrated plans for learning, and the evaluation of plans, their implementation and the outcomes of the learning experience\\". It designs and reviews curriculum, promotes teaching and assessment strategies aligned with curriculum, formulates special curriculum programmes, creates clear, observable objectives, and generates useful assessment rubrics. Curriculum development can be described as a three-stage process encompassing planned, delivered and experienced curriculum. It may be shaped by pedagogical approaches contributed by theorists and researchers, such as John Dewey, Lev Vygotsky, Jean Piaget, Jerome Bruner, and Albert Bandura.  Preschool  Curriculum development at the preschool level is based on several schools of thought. The Kindergarten was established by Friedrich Fr√∂bel in Germany in 1837. Froebel described three forms of knowledge which he viewed as essential to all learning: knowledge of life, which includes an appreciation of gardening, animals and domestic tasks; knowledge of mathematics, such as geometry; and knowledge of beauty, which includes colour and shape, harmony and movement. The goals of Froebel's kindergarten are to awaken a child's physical senses through learning experiences and provide a common ground for individuals to advance. Margaret and Rachel McMillan were social reformers in England who spent their lives trying to address poverty and founded the Open- Air Nursery School and Training Centre in London. Their goals were to provide loving care, health support, nourishment and physical welfare to children. Assistance was provided to parents to aid them in caring for, and interacting with, their children. Pedagogical models on how to engage and interact with young children were provided. The pedagogical principles of the Nursery School may be found in educational frameworks requiring teachers to nurture and teach a curriculum which covers an exploration of the world, aesthetics, music and movement, and literacy. John Dewey formulated the theory of progressive education. His progressive-education philosophy embraces the idea that children should be taught how to think. Dewey was opposed to assessments, since they cannot measure whether or not a child is educated. The school community should offer learning opportunities which are interesting and meaningful and prepare individuals to live in a democratic society. Children learn through doing, cooperation, problem-solving and collaboration, with the teacher acting as a guide. Projects in Dewey's curriculum encourage exploration, self-discovery and sensorial experiences which provide a holistic approach, focuses on the children's interests, and are developmentally appropriate. Montessori education was developed by Maria Montessori, who believed that children go through sensitive periods known as \\"windows of opportunity\\". Everything in a Montessori classroom enhances and develops a child's growth. Materials address children's interests and the natural environment. The learning environment is focused on the child. The curriculum trains children to be responsive, and promotes a desire for skills mastery. Waldorf education, created by the Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner, focuses on the whole child: body, mind, and spirit. The curriculum is designed to provoke thought processes, develop sensitivity, and enhance creative and artistic fluency. The Waldorf curriculum consists of storytelling, aesthetics (arts), practical work, imaginative play, and discovery of nature. Modern schools adopting Waldorf education are independent and self-governing. The Reggio Emilia approach developed in the small north-Italian city of Reggio Emilia. Influenced by constructivist theories and the progressive-education movement, it is committed to uphold the rights of individuals. Key concepts in a Reggio Emilia school include a child's right to education, the importance of interpersonal relationships amongst children, teachers and parents, and children's interactions in work and play. Its curriculum emerges from the children's interest, and is developed through projects and inquiry. Each individual plays an important role in the school, and parental involvement is a key aspect of the child's learning and development.  Primary education  Curriculum development at the primary level focuses on the foundations of subjects, covering subject disciplines, knowledge skills and character development. Subject disciplines are the cores and foundations of language, science, humanities, the arts, technology, and social studies. Knowledge skills are personal skills and attributes such as communication, critical thinking, teamwork and judgement, which are developed through learning experiences based on the school's pedagogical practices. Character development, according to Elliot Eisner, is the implicit curriculum: the school's hidden agenda. Character traits and attributes include resilience, self-discipline, empathy and compassion, focusing on the social and emotional development of each student. The curriculum development is a springboard towards personal and social capability, ethical and intercultural understanding, and sound moral judgement.  Secondary education  Curriculum development varies at the secondary level, based on the course (or stream) in which a student is enrolled. Curriculum focuses on core subjects such as language, mathematics, science and the humanities. Learning experiences, strategic goals, national frameworks and school philosophy are also considered in curriculum development; schools consider values and progressive skills in the development of a holistic curriculum. Elective and vocational programmes are offered, which include social studies, art and music, design, and technology and computer studies. Specialized schools integrate programmes with corporate partners in information and communication technology, entrepreneurship, art, design, media and Da Vinci Learning. Enhanced programmes in sports, arts, and language are also offered.  Tertiary education  Curriculum at the tertiary education level involves specific course design and development. Griffith University describes planning as based on previously-collected evidence; the process also involves assessment, technologically-informed learning and discipline-based capabilities. The process aims to prepare students for the workforce while enhancing their understanding of a subject. Griffith University considers four key elements in curriculum development: learning analytics, external peer review, peer-based professional learning and professional learning workshops. = Educational technology = Educational technology involves the integration, planning, implementation and management of information and communications technology (ICT) for effective learning and teaching. The educational-technology branch of an education system conceptualizes and develops ICT in education, integrating it with curriculum frameworks, staff development and management. The focus of educational technology has shifted to online and web-based applications, learning portals, flipped classrooms and a variety of social networks for teaching and learning. Although educational technology includes ICT, it is not limited to hardware and educational theoretics. It encompasses several domains including collaborative learning, learning theory, linear learning, online portal learning, and (where mobile technologies are used) m-learning. These domains contribute to a personalized learning model and promote self-directed learning, as students take charge of their education. = Finances = This department oversees the financial policies of the educational institutes which provide administrative support to schools: financial assistance, revenue operations and school funds. Financial assistance includes government subsidies, allowances and grants which are applied according to income levels and other factors, such as age or institution. Scholarships and awards are distributed by merit or to categories of students. = Health and physical development = This department's primary role is to develop safe and effective programmes to educate students on healthy living and physical education, and involves mastery of a sport and acquiring basic movement skills. The department develops a curriculum based on sequential outcomes and the physical abilities of students. An instructional model may be used as a plan which includes a theoretical foundation, learning outcomes, sequenced activities and task structures. The department may promote parental involvement through partnerships with families and communities, and may rely on support from dieticians, physiotherapists, community health services and sports associations. = Human resources = The primary goals of the human-resources department are attracting, developing, and retaining staff in the education ministry. It formulates operational policies and systems which directly affect staff performance and attitudes. Departmental objectives include a review of organisational structures and procedures, staff skills development and enhancement, and leadership succession and transition. These aim to foster greater staff involvement and expansion, eventually reaching the education system's overall goals. = Information technology = Information technology harnesses technology to facilitate efficient administration, management and education. This requires frequent staff training to ensure that educators at all levels are fully equipped with the needed skill set, and managers must identify and conceptualise relevant information for instruction. IT systems must be reliable, accessible and assimilated by educators, and are vulnerable to hacking and malware. A period of close examination during integration may be necessary to ensure that educators are using new applications correctly. = Special education = Special education aims to facilitate a healthy learning environment for children with special needs or disabilities, giving all children an insightful and fruitful learning experience. Special education may be provided in mainstream schools or specialised schools. The appropriate choice of learning institution depends on the child's needs and the services available. Children may display learning difficulties or require additional materials for learning. Relevant courses are designed for children on the autism spectrum or with intellectual disabilities, visual impairment, hearing loss or cerebral palsy. Additional assistance may be provided by social-service, non-governmental and voluntary welfare organisations and corporate partners. The department tries to ensure that students with disabilities can participate in the school curriculum on the same basis as their peers. It encompasses all education, including specialised schools and support classes; this is key to ensuring student diversity. Special support services include accommodations, consultations, and personalised learning. Allied educators provide a high level of interaction with each child. A multidisciplinary team of psychologists, special educators, and therapists fosters appropriate, meaningful learning. = Student development = This department's primary role is to create curriculum and programmes which promote character, arts, citizenship, moral education, and global awareness. Its mission is to promote individual student excellence, encourage collaboration and discovery and challenge students to take responsibility, equipping students with future-ready qualities and competencies. Schools focus on values, collaboration, culture, and integration in approaching student-development programmes. Overseas learning opportunities can be integrated to enable students to become aware of diverse cultures and backgrounds, with the goals of global connectivity and collaboration.  Objectives  =Educator level = Teachers plan and implement lessons based on pedagogical practices in an educational framework, managing and updating student portfolios to recognise and assess diverse domains of development: social, emotional, intellectual, physical, moral and aesthetic. Pedagogical practices are supported by the curriculum philosophy, the goals and objectives of the subject matter, and individual student learning and developmental needs. Although educational management at the educator level is similar to that of the education ministry, its planning, development and monitoring focuses on individual students. Teachers adopt classroom-management strategies and incorporate instructional approaches which promote independence, discipline, and a positive learning mindset. A teacher's classroom-management style influences many aspects of the learning environment. The four general styles of classroom management are authoritarian, authoritative, permissive and disengaged. Teachers use a variety of positive guidance and disciplinary strategies to refocus a student's attention or manage conflicts. = Ministerial-departmental level = Ministries and departments of education are responsible for the \\"design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of educational legislation, policies, and programmes\\". They provide structured support in strategic leadership, human resources, budgeting and administrative management to ensure that the educational system functions effectively and efficiently. = Institutional level = The board of education and principals are responsible for managing an educational institution's daily operations. The school board formulates policies and has decision-making powers. Their responsibilities include regulating the school budget, formulating its strategic vision and mission, and reviewing and enhancing school policies. The board also monitors school performance, reporting to stakeholders (such as parents and the director-general) and collaborating with parents, government and non-governmental organisations. The board of education can make legal decisions on behalf of the school, entering contracts and providing land. The principal has a professional and administrative role in the school. With the school board, they chart the school's strategic goals reflecting its mission, vision, and philosophy. The principal supervises teaching and non-teaching staff, coordinating and managing day-to-day operations. They are tasked with procuring resources for the school to achieve its strategic goals and ensuring that staff are trained and equipped with specialised skills, such as first aid. Principals are also required to engage with parents and community partners and provide performance indicators to the ministry (or department) of education. Principals \\"build school culture\\", sustaining enhancement programmes and campaigns in the school. Strategic goals for a school include excellence and engagement in learning, building character and leadership and developing staff competencies, collaborative partnerships, holistic education, quality student outcomes and lifelong, future-ready learners.  National examples  = Australia = Education in Australia is bureaucratic in nature. The national and state departments of education are responsible for the regulation of funding of education. Australia's educational system is governed by the Department of Education and Training, which is responsible for national policies and programmes. The department reports to two ministers; secretaries are responsible for the delivery of departmental services, which include corporate strategy, early-childhood education and childcare, higher education, research, and skills and training. Each state is responsible for the delivery and coordination of its programmes and policies: * Department of Education (New South Wales) * Department of Education (Western Australia) * Department of Education and Training (Queensland) * Department for Education (South Australia) * Department of Education and Training (Victoria) * Department of Education (Tasmania) = Finland = Education in Finland is also bureaucratic in nature. The Ministry of Education and Culture consists of departments of general education and early-childhood education; vocational education and training; higher education and science policy; art and cultural policy; youth and sport policy, and a unit for upper-secondary-school reform. Common ministry functions are performed by administrative, finance and communications units and a secretariat for international relations. = Singapore = Education in Singapore is functional in structure, and is managed by the Ministry of Education (MOE). Its organisational structure consists of: * Political leaders * The Academy of Singapore Teachers, a professional organisation * The Communications and Engagement Group has two divisions: communications, and engagement and research. The communications division manages strategic messaging and promotes the communication of education policies and programmes to the media and the public. The engagement and research division interacts with key MOE stakeholders. * The Curriculum Planning and Development Division's goal is to meet national, community and individual needs. Its responsibilities include syllabus design and review, teaching approaches and assessment, programmes, resources, library services, language centers, and consulting services. * The Curriculum Policy Office develops and reviews policies involved in the national curriculum and facilitates sound, balanced, purposeful and effective curriculum, pedagogy, and assessment practices. * The Educational Technology Division provides strategic direction, leadership, conceptualization and development of ICT integration into the educational master plan. * The Finance and Procurement division has two departments: finance and procurement. The finance department manages the ministry's budget and oversees and formulates policies. The procurement department manages contracts and tenders. * The Higher Education Group formulates, implements and reviews policies relating to tertiary institutions, such as universities and polytechnics. * The Human Resource Group \\"oversee recruitment and appointment, management of establishment matters for Education Officers, Executive & Administrative Staff, Allied Educators (EO/EAS/AED), employee engagement and HR partnerships with schools and HQ Divisions\\". * The Information Technology Branch integrates technology with different educational levels and includes administration and management. They provide advice and support on the distribution of information and communication technologies for teaching and learning, and provide the MOE with the processes and procedures to implement IT strategically and effectively. * Infrastructure and Facility Services has three branches. The School Campus Department deals with infrastructure planning with building and upgrade programmes, and monitors and reviews the Urban Redevelopment Authority's policies and plans for land use. The HQ Services Branch oversees policies and planning of physical infrastructure in the MOE HQ purview, and provide administrative policy support for services in schools. The Safety, Security and Emergency Branch oversees the emergency operations and procedures of schools and the MOE HQ, developing and implementing a \\"safety culture\\" in school programmes. * The Internal Audit Branch provides checks and balances in the educational system and ministry, independently monitoring and conducting financial and operational audits, investigations and reviews. * The Planning Department's main role is to \\"manage and analyse key MOE data to support MOE management in decision-making\\". It has three divisions: the Education Policy Branch, the Corporate Planning Office, and the International Cooperation Branch. * The Research and Management Information Department conducts research and analyses data essential for MOE strategic goals. It consists of the Management Information Branch, the Psychological Assessment Research Branch, the Research and Evaluation Branch, and the Corporate Management Branch. * The Schools Department ensures quality leadership in schools. It consists of the Schools Division; the School Branch North, South, East and West; the Pre- school Education Branch; the School Appraisal Branch, and the School Cockpit Administration Centre. The branches have management, administrative-support, implementation and consulting, and integration role. * Special Educational Needs serve and support students in inclusive environments and special- education institutions, charting the MOE's course in supporting students with special educational needs and developing and reviewing curriculum. * The Student Placement and Services Division's primary role is the management and administration of admissions and scholarships. They also manage the MOE HQ's Customer Service Centre to \\"improve the quality of service delivery across all MOE public touch points\\". * Student Development Curriculum delivers a curriculum which meets the goals and vision of Singapore's education system. They oversee the curriculum and co-curricular programme, collaborate with key stakeholders to review and revise curriculum, ensure the successful implementation of national programmes, and enhance student talent and development.

Played on October 1, Washington won by a score of 4‚Äì3 to advance to the National League Division Series to face the Los Angeles Dodgers. The game was televised nationally by TBS. For the third straight year, Major League Baseball sold presenting sponsorships to all of its postseason series; as with the 2019 AL Wild Card Game, this wild-card game was again presented by sponsor Hankook Tire and officially known as the 2019 National League Wild Card Game presented by Hankook Tire. Background Washington entered the game with a 93‚Äì69 record, while Milwaukee was 89‚Äì73. They met six times during the regular season, with Milwaukee winning the season series 4‚Äì2. The Washington Nationals secured a berth in the Wild Card Game on September 24. The Nationals finished second in the National League East, behind the Atlanta Braves. The Nationals secured home field advantage on September 28. This was Washington's first playoff appearance as a wild card team. The Milwaukee Brewers secured a postseason berth on September 26, and became the second NL wild card on September 29, the final day of the regular season. The Brewers finished second in the National League Central, behind the St. Louis Cardinals. This was Milwaukee's third playoff appearance as a wild card team, the first being in 2008, and their first Wild Card Game appearance. Game results =Line score= Winning pitcher Stephen Strasburg For the first time in Montreal- Washington franchise history, the Nationals appeared in a wild-card game, facing the Milwaukee Brewers at Nationals Park. Although Max Scherzer had suffered a series of injuries since mid-season, manager Dave Martinez decided to go with him as Washington's starter for the game.Dougherty, Jesse, \\"Nationals storm back late in wild-card game to stun Brewers, 4-3, advance to NLDS,\\" washingtonpost.com, October 2, 2019, 1:51 a.m. EDT Retrieved October 3, 2019 Scherzer walked the Brewers‚Ä≤ first batter, right fielder Trent Grisham, and then gave up a home run in the next Milwaukee at-bat to catcher Yasmani Grandal,.Anonymous, \\"Soto lifts Nats to 4-3 comeback wild-card win over Brewers,\\" Associated Press, October 1, 2019, 11:18 p.m. Retrieved October 2, 2019 In the second inning, Milwaukee first baseman Eric Thames led off with a home run, and the Nationals trailed 3‚Äì0. Scherzer faced threats in the fourth inning, when Thames doubled and advanced to third, and in the fifth inning, when he walked both pinch hitter Travis Shaw and Grandal, but he did not allow the Brewers to score again.Brewers vs. Nationals ‚Äì Play-by-Play ‚Äì October 1, 2019 ‚Äì ESPN He left the game after five innings, having thrown 77 pitches, walking three Brewers and striking out six.Brewers vs. Nationals ‚Äì Box Score ‚Äì October 1, 2019 ‚Äì ESPN Washington generated little offense over the first seven innings. Against Milwaukee starter Brandon Woodruff, the Nationals managed only two hits, although one of them was a home run that shortstop Trea Turner hit in the bottom of the third to cut Milwaukee's lead to 3‚Äì1. Woodruff left the game after four innings, and Milwaukee relievers Brent Suter and Drew Pomeranz pitched the fifth, sixth and seventh innings without allowing any base runners. For Washington, Stephen Strasburg came into the game in relief of Scherzer ‚Äî the first relief appearance of Strasburg's career, including both regular season and playoff games ‚Äî and during the sixth, seventh, and eighth innings gave up two hits but no runs, walking no one and striking out four. The game's third through seventh innings thus mostly passed quietly, although an electrical malfunction at Nationals Park caused fire alarms to sound in the fourth inning and knocked out the public address system for several minutes, resulting in the nightly Presidents Race being run without the customary play-by-play and with third baseman Anthony Rendon and left fielder Juan Soto coming to bat unannounced in the bottom of the fourth. The bottom of the eighth was the decisive inning of the game. Fireballing Milwaukee closer Josh Hader came in for a potential six-out save and struck out center fielder Victor Robles to start the inning. Then Michael A. Taylor pinch-hit for Strasburg and reached first when the umpiring crew ruled that a pitch which appeared either to have hit Taylor or the knob of his bat had in fact hit him, and a Brewers challenge resulted in that decision being upheld. Trea Turner struck out, but pinch hitter Ryan Zimmerman then hit a broken-bat single to center, advancing Taylor to third. After Andrew Stevenson came in to pinch-run for Zimmerman, Anthony Rendon ‚Äì batting with the crowd chanting \\"MVP! MVP!\\" ‚Äì walked on a full count to load the bases. Juan Soto then singled to right and Milwaukee right fielder Trent Grisham misplayed the ball; by the time Soto was tagged out between second and third to end the inning, Taylor, Stevenson, and Rendon all had scored to give the Nationals a 4‚Äì3 lead, their first lead of the game. Daniel Hudson then closed for the Nats, giving up one hit in a scoreless ninth inning and earning the save by getting Ben Gamel to fly out to lock down a 4‚Äì3 victory. The win was the Nationals‚Ä≤ ninth in a row, and as the home crowd chanted \\"Beat LA! Beat LA!,\\" the Nationals celebrated on the field. Previously, the Nationals ‚Äì who had lost eight of their last nine playoff losses by one run ‚Äì had been 0‚Äì3 in winner-take-all postseason games, and all three losses had come in National League Division Series games at Nationals Park and by a combined total of only four runs. The wild-card victory over Milwaukee was the first time in Nationals history, and only the second time in franchise history, that the team had advanced beyond the first round of the playoffs. For Max Scherzer, the win broke a streak of seven straight postseason games in which his team had lost a game in which he appeared.Anonymous, \\"Stephen Strasburg, Max Scherzer dominate Dodgers in Game 2,\\" Associated Press, October 5, 2019, 1:26 a.m. Retrieved October 5, 2019 The Nationals advanced to the 2019 National League Division Series to face the Los Angeles Dodgers.

DJ Chacha that airs on weekdays from 6:00 am to 10:00 am (PST). It started broadcast on Radyo5 92.3 News FM (simulcast on all Radyo5 stations in the Philippines except DXFM in Davao City.) since October 5, 2020, with television simulcast on TV5 from 6:00 am - 7:30am and One PH from 6:00-9:00 am. The program was first broadcast on DZMM with Failon as host, and co-hosted by Korina Sanchez as Tambalang Failon at Sanchez from 1996-2001 and 2004-2009; and Pinky Webb as Tambalang Failon at Webb from 2009-11. After Webb left the program on August 5, 2011, it assumed the title of the namesake weekly current affairs program broadcast on ABS-CBN a month later. Prior to May 5, 2020, the program was broadcast from 8:00am to 10:00am (PST) nationwide on ABS-CBN's Radyo Patrol AM radio network from the studio of DZMM and simulcast on TeleRadyo. The program would continue as a cable-exclusive program until Failon's departure on August 31. A distinct feature of Ted Failon at DJ Chacha and its lineal predecessors is Failon's usage of music and sound effects while anchoring the program, but added entertainment segments catering to celebrity interviews, comedy, love advice, and free money contests under the current format, mirroring the practice of South Korean morning infotainment shows. On September 11, 2020, TV5 Network announced that Ted Failon, DJ Chacha, and the then-untitled show would move to its radio station Radyo5 92.3 News FM. History =Background= Failon was hired in March 1990 as an evening desk editor for ABS-CBN News prior to becoming the inaugural anchor of Gising Pilipinas months later with a weekday airtime of 2:00 to 4:00 am. By 1992, he was moved to hosting the radio station's public service program Aksyon Ngayon where he was first paired with Gel Santos-Relos and eventually Korina Sanchez, the progenitor of Tambalan - widely reckoned by Philippine media historians and listeners as the current program's lineal predecessor. =Tambalang Failon at Sanchez: (1996‚Äì2001; 2004‚Äì2009)= Tambalang Failon at Sanchez debuted at the 8:00-10:00 a.m timeslot in 1996 shortly after the departure of Mel Tiangco and Jay Sonza. The program was initially broadcast as a general commentary format before both hosts incorporated vignette characters discussing the topics at hand, aside from Failon's use of various sound effects - a tactic that he utilized, originating from his prior career as an FM disk jockey. Tambalang Failon at Sanchez first ended its run on March 2001 when Failon ran and later won the Congressional seat for the 1st legislative district of Leyte in the May elections. The show resumed broadcast in late 2004 at the 8:00 am slot until 2007 when the morning edition of Dos por Dos expanded to an hour, bumping the program to an 8:30 am slot and reducing its time to 90 minutes. In April 2007, the show began simulcasting on DZMM TeleRadyo. The show's second run ended in 2009 when Sanchez went on leave to support the Vice-Presidential campaign of spouse Mar Roxas. Pinky Webb was later named as Failon's partner, renaming the show to Tambalang Failon at Webb. =Tambalang Failon at Webb (2009‚Äì2011)= The new reformat took place in October 2009, with minimal changes. However it only lasted until August 2011 when Webb decided to concentrate on TV duties coinciding with her being named as TV Patrol Weekend anchor. =Failon Ngayon (2011‚Äì2020)= In line of changes to its namesake public-affairs television program, the longtime Tambalan series was renamed as Failon Ngayon sa DZMM in September 2011, with Ted Failon anchoring the show alone while carrying over the use of sound effects and concentrating on long-form interviews and field reports as a supplement to the TV show. It also returned to a two-hour runtime, beginning at 8:00 am. By 2012, the program added segment anchor Joey Rebat√© for occasional man on the street interviews and later had an added duty distributing ABS-CBN TV Plus digital set-top boxes to lucky listeners upon the service's launch in 2015. In 2013, the program added DJ Chacha (Czarina Balba- Guevarra) of MOR 101.9 as segment anchor for show business and listeners feedback. Initially starting off as a once-a-week duty, positive reviews led to her role continuously expanded. By 2014, her segment already ran thrice a week at 9:00 am; she permanently became co-anchor to Failon in 2016. Failon Ngayon had its last broadcast on DZMM 630 AM on May 5, 2020 - hours before the NTC handed the cease and desist order in the afternoon that ordered shutting off all ABS-CBN's terrestrial broadcast assets due to expiration of the network's legislative franchise to operate. It resumed broadcast on May 8 through cable on the provisionally rebranded TeleRadyo, and renamed as Failon Ngayon sa TeleRadyo. However, on August 30, 2020, ABS-CBN released the statement announcing Failon's departure from the network as a result of retrenchments stemming from the July 10 House committee vote denying the company a legislative broadcast franchise. The program made its final broadcast on August 31 featuring a retrospective of his career. Failon later made his final appearance on TV Patrol via Zoom. Balba-Guevarra also announced her departure from the network on the same day, having ended duties three days prior as MOR 101.9 disc jockey as the personnel of the station were also retrenched. The vacated timeslot was succeeded by On The Spot effective September 1. It was originally hosted by one of Failon's relief anchors Ricky Rosales and Kori Quintos in interim until Henry Omaga-Diaz and Tony Velasquez took over from September 7. However, on October 5, former ABS-CBN Europe bureau chief Danny Buenafe who also co-hosts Good Job replaced Omaga-Diaz when the latter was promoted to become Failon's replacement on TV Patrol. =Ted Failon at DJ Chacha (2020‚Äìpresent)= On September 2, media reports surfaced that Failon, Balba-Guevarra and his program staff are to transfer to Radyo5 92.3 News FM, a news and public affairs FM radio station owned by TV5 Network's affiliate, Nation Broadcasting Corporation for his own radio program on the station, it was later made official on September 11. Contrary to first reports of the premiere date being set on September 21, 2020, it was pushed back to October 5. Preliminary information from network-level arrangements further disclosed that the program would double its airtime to four hours, with the first half alloted for news and the remaining half will be modeled after Failon's original commentary style while he was with DZMM. Further details from the network-level arrangements were made official on the program's virtual media conference held on October 1, 2020, including the first disclosure of giving away cash prizes to lucky listeners and interviews with newsmakers. Balba-Guevarra stated that the program would be the \\"2.0\\" of their previous show. The program premiered on October 5, 2020 with a simulcast from 6:00 am to 7:30 a.m. on TV5 and 6:00 - 9:00 am on One PH (rendering the program as TV5's first morning show since Aksyon sa Umaga, which ended in 2017). It also added segments catering to celebrity interviews (Good Morning Lodi), comedy (Make Us Laugh), love advice (Dear Ted and Cha), live phone-in musical requests (Music By Request) and free phone-in money contests (Hula-Hits) - mirroring the format of South Korean morning drive-time infotainment shows such as Jang Sung-kyu's Good Morning FM of MBC FM4U, Kim Young-chul's Power FM of SBS Power FM and Kim Tae-hoon's Freeway of KBS Happy FM. Similar to the former practice of Noli de Castro's Kabayan fusing with the half-hour Radyo Patrol Balita Alas-Siyete (later TeleBalita and currently TeleRadyo Balita, which Failon formerly served as co-anchor) at 7:00 am, Ted Failon and DJ Chacha combines with the newly-formed Radyo5 Network News at the said timeslot, also running for a half-hour.

The legendary Chan Buddhist monk Ji Gong, was widely recognised by people as the incarnate of the Xianglong Luohan. Origin Originally there were only sixteen arhats. Worship of a group of sixteen arhats was set forth in an Indian sutra that was translated into Chinese in the mid-seventh century. Between the late Tang dynasty and early Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period of China, two additional arhats were added, one paired with a tiger and the other one with a dragon. Xianglong Luohan is often equated with MahƒÅkƒÅ≈õyapa of Buddhism, but actually, Xianglong Luohan has his own number of stories and has long been worshipped in China. Legend According to legend, the people of a kingdom in ancient India, after being incited by a demon, went on a rampage against the Buddhists and monasteries, stealing the Buddhist scriptures. The Dragon King flooded the kingdom and rescued the scriptures, which he put in his Dragon Palace. After the Dragon King was tamed by Nantimitolo, who was a disciple of Gautama Buddha, the scriptures were retrieved back to earth. Hence he is called the Taming Dragon Louhan.

He is primarily known as the historian behind Philippine President Diosdado Macapagal's decision to issue Proclamation No. 28 on May 12, 1962, which changed the date of Philippine independence from July 4, 1946 to June 12, 1898 ‚Äî the date when Philippine President Emilio Aguinaldo proclaimed the country's independence from Spain in Kawit, Cavite. For this achievement, Fabella became known as the \\"Father of June 12 Independence Day.\\" Fabella was also the founder and first president of the Philippine Historical Association, the pioneer professional association of historians in the Philippines. Early life and education Fabella was born in the island municipality of Banton, Romblon on March 18, 1898 to Maximo Fabella, a coconut and tobacco merchant, and Rafaela Fabrero, a housewife. He is 10th among the couple's 13 children. At the time, Banton was an isolated municipality halfway between Marinduque and the main island of Romblon. As such, he and his family grew up in abject poverty. He received elementary education at Banton Primary School and Romblon Intermediate School. To augment his monthly stipend of ‚Ç±3 to ‚Ç±4 from Banton, Fabella worked as a store helper for a local Filipino-Chinese merchant. For his secondary education, Fabella studied at Manila High School in Intramuros, Manila with the support of his brothers Apolonio and Jorge who already lived there and are working as calesa drivers. To help his brothers in sending him to school, he sold newspapers every Friday and Saturday and polished shoes at Puerta del Parian. He also helped his sister-in-law in selling food to calesa drivers in the Port Area. He finished high school in 1916. Among his high school batchmates include Julio Nalundasan and Carlos P. Romulo. Poverty forced Fabella to postpone his plan to pursue his college studies. Instead, he worked as an elementary school teacher at Capiz Intermediate School from June 2016 to March 2017. After saving enough money from his salary, he went back to Manila and enrolled at the University of the Philippines Manila. From 1917 to 1920, he completed three courses in the university: Bachelor of Arts (BA), Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and High School Teachers' Certificate (HSTC). He was the first person from Banton to finish both high school and college and the first to have a triple degree. In 1931, Fabella graduated from UP with a degree in Master of Arts in History, thus becoming the first person from Banton to have postgraduate education. In 1934, Fabella completed his Bachelor of Laws degree at the University of Manila and passed the Philippine Bar Examination that same year. Career =As history instructor= After finishing college, Fabella taught at Romblon High School from 1920 to 1922, and at Tayabas High School in Lucena, Quezon (province) from 1922 to 1923. That year, he received an offer from UP Department of History chairperson Dr. Leandro Fernandez to become a history instructor at the university. His first teaching service at UP lasted 11 years, serving alongside other prominent Filipino historians like Gregorio F. Zaide, Encarnacion Alzona and Nicolas Zafra. Among his notable students include would-be dictator Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos. While teaching at UP, he also completed his master's degree in History at the school and his Law degree at the University of Manila. During the same period, he wrote for Iwag it Kaanduan, Romblon's first vernacular newspaper and established his own newspaper Bag-ong Iwag in 1926. Due to his educational achievements, Fabella was well known in Romblon and was active in various organizations such as Katipunang Bantoanon, Romblomanian Association, Banton Uplift Club and Romblon Youth. Following budget cuts brought about by the Great Depression, Fabella was among several instructors let go by the university in 1934. =Political career= As early as 1922, Fabella showed desire to enter politics to challenge the incumbent Leonardo Festin, who has been assemblyman for the lone seat of Romblon in the National Assembly since 1916. Following the end of his first teaching service in UP in 1934, Fabella joined the Partido Nacionalista Democratico and ran against Festin during the 1935 Philippine general elections. He won against Festin with a lead of 356 votes despite the lack of funding and campaigning throughout the province for only 24 days. Fabella served as Romblon's assemblyman for three years from November 25, 1935 to August 15, 1938. During that time, he became a member of various committees in the National Assembly, namely Public Instruction, Public Services, Civil Service, Codes, Internal Government, Privileges at Navigation. He also appropriated 80 percent of his pork barrel to building schools in Romblon, while the remaining 20 percent was appropriated to construction and repair of roads in the province. Following the end of term in 1938, Fabella didn't seek reelection and returned to teaching instead at the University of the Philippines. Father of June 12 Independence Day The resolution asserts the following: * The United States celebrates independence day every July 4, the day Americans declared their independence, not 3 September 1783 when Great Britain recognized their liberty; * If the Philippines celebrates its independence day every July 4, our celebration would be dwarfed by the US celebration; * June 12 was the most logical date since Filipinos were not actually particular about fixing of dates, what we actually cared for is independence itself; and, * If the Philippines celebrates common independence day with US, other nations might believe that the Philippines is still a part of United States. In support of the resolution, Fabella gave public speeches and radio interviews explaining the significance of celebrating June 12 as the country's independence day. He also wrote the article ‚ÄúPhilippine Independence: June 12 or July 4? which was published in the Sunday Times Magazine on July 1, 1956 and garnered positive responses and support from the people. The resolution reached Philippine President Diosdado Macapagal, who issued Proclamation No. 28, declaring June 12 as the country's Independence Day. Congress made the proclamation formal with the adoption and passage of Republic Act No. 4166. Death Fabella died in Manila on January 29, 1982 at the age of 83.

It was designed by Surveyor-General Thomas Mitchell and built from 1826 to 1834 by convict road gangs. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The Great North Road, over 240 km long, was constructed between 1826 and 1834, and remains one of the major engineering feats of the convict era. Much of the road is still in use today, although some of the original surface is buried. A number of the original stone culverts, bridges and retaining walls are still in use. The road runs from the Windsor Road in Baulkham Hills to Wiseman's Ferry, where it branches off to Maitland and Singleton. At the time of construction the engineering was at the cutting edge of road building technology, incorporating the latest ideas from Europe.Convict Trail Project: 1997 Work on the road began in 1826 after petitions from residents in the newly settled Hunter Valley for a decent route to take stock and travellers north. Construction proceeded under the direction of Thomas Mitchell, the Surveyor General and by Governor Darling who had recognised the need for infrastructure in the rapidly expanding colony. Construction was carried out by convicts working in Road Gangs. Up to 700 men worked on the road at any one time, suffering harsh conditions. Construction was completed by 1833. Many travellers however, found sections of too isolated with insufficient water and feed for stock. As a result, alternative tracks were quickly searched out along the fertile Hawkesbury and Macdonald valleys, providing a safer and faster alternative for travellers. Sections of the Great Road soon fell into disrepair.  Description  The Great North Road runs from the Windsor Road in Baulkham Hills to Wiseman's Ferry where it branches off to Maitland and Singleton. It is over 240 km long. A shorter section was built in 1830 between Five Dock and Pennant Hills, joining the original road at Dural. Another major branch line, Simpson's Track, divergerd from the main road at Ten Mile Hollow, and crossed Mangrove Creek, heading through Yarramalong towards Newcastle. There are still some places where well- preserved sections of the original Road can be seen. The 43 km section immediately north of Wiseman's Ferry, from Devine's Hill to Mount Manning run through very steep and rugged country and contains particularly fine examples of high walling with massive buttresses, drainage systems and quarries. The walls, up to 13m high, are made of interlocking stone blocks of varying shapes and sizes without mortar to hold them together. Some of the blocks weigh up to 660 kg. Examples of stone work at Clares Bridge and Circuit Flat Bridge are preserved within Dharug and Yengo National Parks. These areas are closed to vehicular access to preserve the remaining convict road works. Other sections of convict work can be seen at Mt McQuoid, Ramseys Leap and the Murrays Run Culvert.Convict Trail Project 1997  Heritage listing  The Old Great North Road is a signifier of the outlooks of early colonial society. Its magnificent structures were powerful, tangible symbols of the colony's perceived place and role in the course of empire, unmistakable evidence that the civilised state was being attained and a triumph over a rugged and inhospitable landscape. It is associated with several notable figures in colonial administration, surveying and engineering including Governor Darling, Surveyor General Thomas Mitchell and Percy Simpson, one of Australia's earliest scientific road engineers.Karskens 1991: 12 The Old Great North Road physically demonstrates the work patterns, skills and organisation of convict work gangs. This evidence is unavailable in documentary sources and has been essential in changing our views of work gangs. It has technological value in that it demonstrates the standards and practice of road engineering in the colony during the \\"Great Roads\\" period of the late 1820s and 1830s.

He is also a scholar of African cinema affiliated to the University of Stirling.  Early life  Sankanu was born in the village of Sotuma Sere in Jimara, Upper River Region. He is a Serahulleh (also known as Soninke) and is Muslim. Sankanu is part of the Sankanu Kaggoro clan, part of the ancient Ghana Empire, and is a prince of his clan. He attended Nusrat High School and was a student journalist.  Journalistic career and move to Germany  Sankanu initially worked as a journalist in The Gambia. He was a freelance journalist who wrote primarily for Upfront, the APRC's party newspaper, as well as the BBC, Voice of America, Deutsche Welle, and The Point. In some of his articles, he used the pen name Wagadou Ghana Remme. He went on to work for Gambia Radio & Television Service (GRTS) on national TV, and hosted the programme 'Business Forum'. Sankanu experienced \\"a strange illness\\" anytime he entered the GRTS building and saw others suffering health problems as a result of serving the Jammeh regime. He secretly applied for a visa to the Schengen area, and left for Germany in 1998.  Film career  Sankanu decided to become a professional filmmaker in 2012. He founded the Cinekambiya International Film Festival (CIFF) in 2015. He has founded two companies, Sanxaanu Kaggoro Film Kaffo (Sanxaafi) and Tagadou Productions, and studied a diploma in digital film and animation at the SAE Institute in Cologne, Germany. Sanxaafi has since become the first Gambian film company to become part of the Pan African Federation of Filmmakers. In September 2017, Sankanu finished a film called Bleeding Blade about female genital mutilation (FGM). The film follows a girl called Sira Camara whose fianc√© attempts to force her to be circumcised after they agree to marry; the film sees the community eventually turn against the practice. Campaigner and politician Isatou Touray said that the film was \\"a very good start\\" in changing public opinion in the fight against FGM in The Gambia. Sankanu also created a number of other films in 2017. They include Pain of Sorrow, on discrimination against girls with disabilities, Kuu Buka Labang, a Mandinka-language film on changes in destiny, and Hisirinwalle, a Sarahulleh-language family drama on ungratefulness. Pain of Sorrow was nominated for Best Film in the 2018 Hollywood African Prestigious Awards (HAPAwards). He is said to have inspired a \\"new wave of Gambian filmmaking.\\" In 2018, two films that Sankanu co-produced were released. They include Faasike, with Bubacarr Zaidi Jallow, and Chossano, with Papis Kebbah Jobarteh and Frank Adim. Sankanu is also executive producer of Kelefa Saane, a documentary on a precolonial Senegambian hero, directed by Fenja Braster.  Film scholarship  Sankanu has stated that his aim is to become a \\"full professor of cinema.\\" As such, he has advanced this aim by studying MLitt Film Studies: Theory and Practice at the University of Stirling, UK. Having graduated, Stirling have offered him the chance to study a PhD in African cinema at the institution, which he has deferred until his work schedule is not so busy.  Personal life and politics  Sankanu was married for 15 years, but it was dissolved in the Brikama Cadi Court after the marriage produced no children. He married again but this only lasted for five years. He is now on his third marriage. On 5 September 2016, Sankanu won a primary election in the German Pirate Party to stand as a candidate in parliamentary elections in North-Rhine Westphalia on 14 May 2017. He was to be a candidate in Wahkreis 17, covering the southeast district of Cologne. Sankanu previously attempted to stand as a candidate in European Parliament elections, but he missed the deadline for candidate registration. Sankanu has also been the Pirate Party's commissioner for sub-Saharan Africa.

Particular emphasis is being placed on teaching traditional music styles, such as Taarab, Kidumbaki or Ngoma. \\"In recent years the Music Academy of the Tanzanian island has become an important meeting center of the dynamic local cultural scene.\\"Luca Beti: Sansibars bewegende Rhythmen. In: One World. 02/2018, p. 38-40, full text Aims The Academy was established in 2002 and throughout the years it had more than 1500 students. DCMA is one of the most prominent ambassadors of taarab music in the world. It has gained an ever-increasing international reputation for teaching traditional music. In 2007, Hildegard Kiel, DCMA's founding director was co-presented with the BBC World Music Award, acknowledging ‚Äúher enormous contribution to revitalizing both Zanzibar‚Äôs musical heritage and the world music scene globally ‚Äù. In October 2010 DCMA won Roskilde World Music Awards for teaching traditional music.World Music Award 2010 of Roskilde Festivals for DCMA In training the students it ensures the continuation, knowledge, and legacy of a unique musical cultural heritage. Dhow Countries Music Academy took its name from traditional sailing vessels, dhows, invented by Arabs, used in the Indian Ocean region. The Arabian Peninsula has a rich maritime history of trade and cultural exchange with East African coast. Dhows have been used in the region for centuries, and were key in developing thriving fishing, pearl diving and trade industries as well as cultural exchanges. DCMA is a major center for the teaching and performance of music traditions that travelled with the boats from Middle East to Africa through the Indian Ocean. The mission of the Dhow Countries Music Academy is to play a key role in strengthening the music industry of Zanzibar and \\"Dhow Region\\" by researching, preserving, training, promoting and developing the musical heritage of Zanzibar and the ‚ÄûDhow Countries‚Äú, both regionally and internationally. Before DCMA was established, traditional music in Zanzibar was close to be forgotten. There were only a couple of traditional taarab groups, and very few young people willing to keep the heritage. But since DCMA started its mission the situation has changed. Music education The curriculum of DCMA offers a quality education from beginning to highly advanced levels. Certificate and diploma courses include courses in the music theory of the Swahili people and specifically the people of Zanzibar and the ‚ÄúDhow Region‚Äù, i.e. Oriental-Arabic music. Though specializing in the traditional Arabic and African music styles of the region, DCMA also gives the opportunity to students to learn instruments used in Western music traditions. Music learning at DCMA includes: # Instrumental and vocal instruction through private and class lessons. These lessons focus on performance skills on various instruments including, but not limited to the violin, oud, qanun, guitar, bass, piano, keyboard, Arabic, African and Western drums, accordion and flute. # Certificate and diploma level courses in performance studies that also include courses in Western, Arabic and African music cultural traditions and ways of researching such traditions. Whilst the central aim of DCMA is to preserve and promote the musical heritage of Zanzibar and the \\"Dhow region\\", in more recent years it has introduced music- in-culture courses and special master classes, concerts and workshops with sound engineers, festival organizers from all over the world and professional musicians, i.e. Cleveland Watkiss, Oliver Mtukudzi, Ricardo Garcia, Blitz the Ambassador, Moussa Diallo, Harald Lassen, Florian Ross, Grzegorz Niemczuk, Leon Michael King, Piotr Damasiewicz, Derek Gripper, Makadem, and others. Additionally, DCMA provides special seminars, exchange visits and networking activities throughout the year, e.g., the conference ‚ÄúMemory, Power and Knowledge in African Music and Beyond‚Äù in June 2015, presented in cooperation with the Universities of Ghana and Nigeria in West Africa and University of Mainz and University of Hildesheim in Germany.University of Hildesheim: Center for World Music Congress, DCMA, June 2015 Education for children DCMA is providing free music lessons for more than 100 kids in 6 primary schools in Zanzibar. Learning music has many benefits for children. It fosters their academic, social, and emotional growth. It develops language skills. Studies have shown that those who undergo music education have better results in standardized tests than the norm. They also achieve higher grades in high school. Music education develops skills that are necessary in the workplace. DCMA is also helping children with various disabilities. Since 2012 DCMA is teaching in Kisiwadui Primary School a group of children with physical disabilities i.e. blindness, hearing problems or wheelchaired. This year the Academy started to work with a local NGO Kahesa Zanzibar and is providing free music education to children with Down syndrome and autism. Outreach educational activities In addition to its activities in Stone Town, Zanzibar, DCMA started a rural outreach program to respond to requests of rural communities to bring music education and music performance skills to more remote locations. This is especially true for those areas where small traditional instrument groups continue to exist and struggle to survive. Mahonda, a small village about 25 km outside of Stone Town, is a branch of the Dhow Countries Music Academy. DCMA activities in Mahonda are targeted to people who already have some skills in music, enabling them to pass on their knowledge to others on a continuous basis. Successful students are invited to study full-time at DCMA in Stonetown, which leads to certificates and diploma qualifications. Bands of DCMA DCMA bands, students and teachers regularly visit Zanzibar and enrich the cultural life of Zanzibar through concerts and performances in clubs and restaurants, e.g. with Taarab and Afro Kabisa concerts, so live Afro-fusion music with jazz, funk, afrobeat and bongo-flava. In addition, DCMA regularly organizes special concerts of international guest musicians and public Ngoma workshops. Some bands that have emerged from DCMA have gained international acclaim far beyond Zanzibar: * The Taarab / Kidumbak Ensemble represents the traditional music of the western Indian Ocean, the instrumental and vocal styles of this fusion of Arabic and African music.‚ÄûMusic in Africa‚Äú Portal about taarab-kidumbak-Ensemble * Mapanya Band, founded in 2016, is one of the most promising young groups in Zanzibar and presents a unique blend of Afro-Fusion, Hip-Hop and Reggae.‚ÄûMusic in Africa‚Äú Portal about Mapanya-Band * Siti and the Band, founded in 2015, as the singer and oud player Siti Amina, Rahma Ameir (violin) and Gora Mohammed (Qanun) decided to dedicate their roots to the Taarab music with their personal musical influences merge.‚ÄûMusic in Africa‚Äú Portal about Siti-and-the-Band * Mcharuko is present in Zanzibar and Dar es Salaam since 2017, with a cocktail of African popular music styles directed by Christopher Anthony (jazz flute), with guitar, drums and vocals. * The Afro Jazz Group, a powerful blend of African, Arabic and Western styles. * As well as the DCMA Ngoma Group, led by Zanzibar drummer legend Mzee Kheri.  International performances  Since DCMA has been founded, several ensembles have presented themselves at festivals in Tanzania, other African countries and other parts of the world, for example, every year DCMA's groups are performing at Sauti za Busara Festival in Zanzibar; in 2005 DCMA taarab group performed at the Mela Festival in France, in 2015 DCMA's taarab ensemble performed at the Brave Festival in Wroclaw, Poland, at the Africa Festival in W√ºrzburg, Germany, in 2016 at Orient Festival Tallinn, Estonia to mention just a few of their international performances.

It was built from 1809 to 1830 by John Lamrock. It is also known as Gold Finders Rest, Kurrajong General Store and Kurrajong Post Office. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 21 October 2016.  History  Rowland Edwards arrived in Sydney in the colony of NSW in 1791 as a convict transported for seven years on the Third Fleet. By 1798 Edwards was believed to be an emancipated convict occupying the \\"lowlands\\" at the junction of the Hawkesbury River and Rickaby's Creek, near present day Windsor. The 1806 General Muster lists Edwards \\"free by servitude\\" and now a settler having purchased 80 acres at Richmond Hill, of which 50 acres were under cultivation and pasture and 30 acres fallow. The occupants of the land were Edwards, his wife and child and an assigned convict. They were noted not to be on Government stores and so it can be assumed they were self-sufficient on their 80 acres. Edwards was not formally granted the land until 1809 by Colonel William Paterson. He was, however, clearly in occupation three years earlier and his self-sufficiency indicates a dwelling on the land grant as early as 1806. His relocation with his family to \\"Richmond Hill\\" on higher land is confirmed by documentary evidence with the grant from Governor Paterson, dated 14 December 1809. Three months before the formal land grant of 1809, Edwards sold stock at public auction (possibly to settle debts) from his property on the High Lands at Richmond Hill. While Richmond Hill was a general term for land north-west of the Hawkesbury River, the High Lands was a more specific reference to the present Kurrajong area. Thus Edwards was in residence at the site of the Goldfinders Inn at least by 1809. Edwards may have constructed the oldest part of the cottage at this time. The earliest fabric evidence is not incompatible with this date. In 1823 Archibald Bell Jr. surveyed the present Old Bells Line of Road. It was a traditional Aboriginal route shown to Bell by Darug guides Emery and Cogy when they led him over Mount Tomah and on to Hartley Vale. The road was under construction by 1825 and was officially opened in 1841. The timber cottage at Goldfinders is of locally sourced material and of a rough vernacular construction, consistent with an absence of navigable road for transporting materials. It is probable that the earliest fabric of the cottage was constructed prior to 1840. The Edwards family appears to have been occupying the site until , when it was sold to John Rule. Rule sold the property to John Lamrock . Lamrock constructed a two-storey sandstone inn in and licensed it as the \\"Goldfinders Home\\", catering to diggers travelling to and from the western goldfields. It became the centre of the local community, operating as a general store and post office. Various public meetings were reported to be held on the site. After the inn licence was not renewed in 1871, it continued to operate as a post office, general store and guesthouse. Contemporary newspaper articles comment on the writers' stays at the property. The guesthouse operation included both buildings, with various extensions to these buildings made, but since demolished. The third owners of the property were Henry and Robert Pitt, from a family that had resided in the Hawkesbury for many years. After Henry's death, it was eventually sold to James Pye in 1922. He operated a local business as a blacksmith. During his ownership, up until 1944, the property continued to be used as a general store and post office and for community gatherings. The Post Office was relocated prior to its sale in 1944. Goldfinders Inn has had a series of owners since 1944, including (1972-5) Padraic Pearce \\"Paddy\\" McGuinness, journalist and commentator. It was purchased by the current (2015) owners Chris and Deborah Hallam in 1975. Deborah Hallam (Pitt) is a direct descendant of Henry Pitt, a previous owner (1899-1908). Conservation planning for the cottage was undertaken by Graham Edds & Associates. Works to the cottage were carried out in 1987. Conservation and adaptation works to the inn building, undertaken in 1979, were designed by Philip Cox and Partners. An addition linking the two buildings was completed in 2010.  Description  Cottage The Goldfinders Inn Group comprises three buildings located at the southern end of the site, near the junction of Bells Line of Road with Little Wheeny Creek. The buildings are a single storey timber cottage, a two-storey, sandstone building constructed as an inn and a timber barn structure. They are set in a garden of mature trees. The earliest fabric of the cottage is estimated to date from the 1820s, though it may be as early as 1809 (the year of the land grant) but no later than 1850 (prior to construction of the inn). The walls are part timber slab and part broad-axed stud frame with sandstone rubble nogging between studs and clad in horizontal splayed weatherboards. The roof framing is of broad-axed rafters and pit-sawn flitch timbers. They are fixed to the wall plate with timber pegs in some parts and with nails in others. Corrugated metal cladding has been laid over the original timber shingles. Inn building The two-storey sandstone inn building is constructed of ashlar blocks with a corrugated metal roof replacing the original timber shingles. Additions made to facilitate its use as a general store and Post Office have subsequently been demolished. The original internal layout is evident in the remaining fabric. Barn A barn of vertical slab construction has been extended with new and recycled slabs. The garden located between the inn and cottage is dominated by a large, mature magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora) and two large camellias (Camellia japonica \\"Variegata\\" and Camellia japonica 'Triumphans'). The \\"Triumphans\\" camellia was identified as the oldest in Australia by Professor Eben Gowrie Waterhouse, eminent camellia authority. Photographic evidence suggests that the magnolia and camellias may date from the 1850s. = Condition = The condition of all three buildings was reported as good as at 23 July 2013. Conservation works undertaken on the cottage in 1987 included weatherproofing the building and some renewal of fabric. Conservation works undertaken on the inn building in 1979 involved weatherproofing and reconstruction of a portion of the wall. The ground level floor was reconstructed and minor adaptation works also carried out at this time, with some replacement of fabric. While the buildings have undergone conservation and adaptation works, including removal of later additions, construction of a new addition and the replacement of some fabric, they retain a high level of intactness. The form of the structures, the significant internal configurations and the patina of original fabric are readily discernible. = Modifications and dates = ;Cottage * : Original part of cottage constructed. * 1820-1900: Various extensions to cottage, as set out in Figures 58 and 59 of attached report. * 1987-88: demolition of part of eastern face, retaining verandah plus one room at north-east corner. * 2010: Construction of infill room between cottage and inn. ;Inn * constructed * 1870-1920: Addition of ground level \\"shop front\\" to western side for use as a general store and post office. * Early 20th century: addition of first floor verandah on south-east side, and skillion roof at ground level on northern side. * Mid 20th century: removal of northern skillion and western shop front. * 1979: removal of first floor verandah, as part of major conservation and building repair works.  Heritage listing  Heritage boundaries The Goldfinders Inn site is of state significance as a continually inhabited place of residence in the Hawkesbury area from the time of the land grant in 1809 to the present day. The cottage, inn and barn together provide physical evidence of successive occupancies and uses of the site initially for farming, through to commercial use as an inn and licensed premises, later a post office and general store and as private residence. The development and functions of the site are integrally related to the development of Bells Line of Road. The Goldfinders Inn Group served as a wayside inn on the long road journeys through the mountains. The cottage is an early dwelling of the Hawkesbury settlement that may date from as early as 1809. It is a rare pre-1840s vernacular building, providing evidence of in-ground timber slab construction, broad-axed stud frame with stone-nogging infill and later phases of stud frame construction. The stone-nog (sandstone block and rubble infill between studs) is a rare construction method, reflecting the remote location of the site in the use of locally sourced material. The site is also rare for its early domestic plantings of magnolias and camellias. The main camellia featured in the garden was described by Professor EJ Waterhouse as the oldest in Australia. The Goldfinders Inn Group has the potential to yield further information on the construction of early vernacular buildings, particularly in relation to the unusual stone nog infill between wall studs. There is also some potential for the site to reveal evidence of former buildings related to documented uses of the place. Goldfinders Inn was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 21 October 2016 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Goldfinders Inn Group is of state heritage significance as the cottage is evidence of an early vernacular dwelling of the Hawkesbury settlement that predates the inn building and may date from as early as 1809. The property has functioned as a continually inhabited place of residence from 1806 to the present day, serving one of the oldest established settlements of NSW. The cottage, inn and barn together provide physical evidence of successive occupancies and uses of the site initially for farming, through mid-nineteenth century more intense settlement and cultivation, commercial use as an inn and licensed premises, later a post office and general store and as private residence. The development of the site is integrally related to the development of Bells Line of Road. The siting of the buildings at the crossing of the road and creek took advantage of passing traffic for business and, in turn, served the development of the road by offering refreshment and rest on a long road journey as a wayside inn. In its operation as a licensed inn, with associated general store and Post Office, the Goldfinders Inn Group has been the centre of Kurrajong community activities, prior to a formal village being constructed. The garden plantings of camellias and magnolias are of historic interest in their own right, with the main camellia described by Professor EJ Waterhouse as the oldest in Australia. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Goldfinders Inn Group is of state significance because the cottage on the site is an early dwelling which has the potential to yield further information on the construction of early vernacular buildings, particularly in relation to the unusual stone nog infill between wall studs. There is also some potential for the site to reveal evidence of former buildings associated with documented uses of the place. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The cottage of the Goldfinders Inn Group is of state significance as a rare pre-1840s cottage with a range of construction systems from its various stages of development, including the use of stone nog infill. The site is also rare for its early domestic plantings and as a dwelling and inn group. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. In its evolution from farm to roadside inn, to community hub with associated functions of general store and Post Office, the Goldfinders Inn Group is of state significance as a representative of the pattern of historic development of key locations in small settlements throughout New South Wales. The form and fabric of the cottage, with its slab construction and portions of stone nog infill, is representative of vernacular building methods of the Old Colonial Period (1788-1840) using locally sourced materials in remote locations.

Kennedy ran Hawaiian Airlines from the time of its incorporation in 1929 until he stepped down from daily operations in 1955. He remained Chairman of the Board until his death in 1968. Early life Kennedy was born in Honolulu, Hawaii to James A. and Minnie C. (Kirkland) Kennedy on July 7, 1890. His father was an immigrant from Scotland who worked his way up to become an executive at the Honolulu Iron Works, and then in 1902 became President of the Inter-Island Steam Navigation Company, which provided passenger and cargo shipping in the Hawaiian Islands. Kennedy attended the Punahou School in Honolulu graduating in 1908, and then attended Stanford University graduating in 1912. He returned to Honolulu to work for his father at Inter-Island Steam Navigation Company. Stanley C. Kennedy US Navy WWI Naval career When the United States entered World War I in 1917, Kennedy joined the US Navy on June 27, 1917. He was sent to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for six weeks of Naval Officer training, and then to Naval Air Station Pensacola to earn his Navy wings. He is listed as Naval Aviator #302. Ensign Kennedy was stationed in England, flying Curtiss H-16 Seaplanes patrolling the North Sea for German submarines. On one mission, Kennedy and his crew went on patrol for 7 hours and 59 minutes, setting a world record for sustained flight and earning him the Navy's Citation Star/Silver Star. Airline career =Creating Inter-Island Airways= Kennedy returned from WWI and resumed his career at the Inter- Island Steam Navigation Company. His experience flying seaplanes led him to the possibility of using seaplanes to connect the people of Hawaii. He approached his father about adding a seaplane division to his company's offerings, but his father saw airplanes as \\"flying toys\\" to be used in only good weather. Shortly after his father's death in 1926, Kennedy's proposal to the company's Board of Directors was accepted, and on January 30, 1929 Inter- Island Airways became a legal entity with Kennedy appointed vice president and general manager. Inter-Island Steam's Board Member F.C. Atherton was appointed President to oversee their investment of $300,000. The first employees Kennedy hired were Navy pilot Charles Elliott as Chief Pilot and Army pilot Carl Cover as Operations Manager. Kennedy, Cover, and Elliott, all being WWI veterans, decided on Armistice Day (November 11) to be the inaugural flight in the Sikorsky S-38 amphibious airplanes. On November 11, 1929, Kennedy's dream of scheduled airline service in the Hawaiian Islands took flight as Elliott and Cover flew the two Sikorsky's in formation from Honolulu to Maui, then on to Hilo. Inter-Islands Airways Sikorsky S-43 in Molokai Starting an airline the month after the Wall Street Crash of 1929, was a daunting task. However, the Board of Directors had great faith in Kennedy, making him the President of both Inter-Island Steam Navigation and Inter-Island Airways in February 1933. The airline lost money for the first 5 years, until Kennedy was able to secure the airmail contract starting on October 8, 1934. This allowed Kennedy to start looking for larger airplanes to operate, and 10 days after the maiden airmail flight he decided on the Sikorsky S-43, making Inter-Island Airways the launch customer for this new aircraft. =Expanding beyond the islands= Kennedy now aimed at expanding Inter-Island Airways to fly to the US mainland. To represent this, on October 1, 1941, Kennedy changed the airline's name to Hawaiian Airlines. In 1943, the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) released a route for application from Honolulu to San Francisco with a stopover in Los Angeles. Kennedy and TWA's president, Jack Frye, teamed up on the petition where Hawaiian would fly the routes,TWA would withdraw its application in exchange for 20% ownership of Hawaiian Airlines. Kennedy spent a great deal of time and money traveling to Washington, D.C. arguing Hawaiian's case to the CAB, but since Pacific Overseas Airline submitted they didn't get a chance at the application, the CAB decided to start the entire application process over again, but it was too expensive for Kennedy to attempt once more. The route application process resurfaced in 1959, after Kennedy had handed over the Presidency to Art Lewis, but remained on as Chairman of the Board. This time Hawaiian was flying DC-6s to the mainland on charters, and felt they had an excellent chance to win the route. Once again to no avail, the route was awarded to Western Airlines. Kennedy would never get to see his airline fly to the mainland on a scheduled basis, as Hawaiian would have to wait until the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978. =First scheduled air-cargo service in the US= After the Attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, Territorial Governor Joseph Poindexter evoked Martial law in Hawaii. The War Shipping Administration took control of all Inter-Island Steam Navigation's ships, but allowed Hawaiian Airlines to operate under the Army's supervision. The ships that used to supply the islands with its consumer goods, were now devoted to transporting soldiers, munitions, and other war supplies throughout the islands. Kennedy petitioned the CAB to allow Hawaiian to fly these consumer goods on its airplanes, and was granted United States Air Cargo Certificate #1. Hawaiian removed the seats of its three remaining S-43s and lone remaining S-38 to use for cargo flights, allowing its DC-3s to fly the passengers. On March 20, 1942, Kennedy watched as Hawaiian's first air-cargo flight departed to serve the people of Hawaii. Hawaiian Air DC-9-34 Groves-1 =Jet service= On April 1, 1966, Kennedy witnessed the final large milestone of his tenure at Hawaiian, the introduction of DC-9 jets for the inter-island service. During Kennedy's oversight of Hawaiian, he had grown it from a fledgling airline flying 8-seat seaplanes to an airline flying a fleet of modern jet airliners. Inter-Island Steam Navigation Company Kennedy was president of the Inter- Island Steam Navigation Company from February 1933, until it ceased operations in 1947. After WWII, Hawaiian Airlines had both a well established inter- island passenger and air-cargo business. Aloha Airlines began inter-island passenger service in 1946, creating more available seats and fierce competition. The 14 hour overnight steamer voyage from Honolulu to Hilo became an outdated form of transportation, when people and cargo could fly there in an hour and a half. Personal life After Kennedy returned home from Stanford, he met Martha Davenport on an Inter-Island steamer while she was vacationing in Hawaii from her home in Chattanooga, Tennessee. They wrote to each other after that vacation, and continued during WWI. On his way home after the war, Kennedy stopped in Chattanooga to marry Martha, and then the two continued to Honolulu together. They lived in a beachfront home near Aina Haina, just east of Honolulu, and had a weekend home in Kahuku, on the North Shore of Oahu. Kennedy was also president of the Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Hawaii, as well as the Honolulu Chamber of Commerce. Death Kennedy died of a heart attack April 19, 1968 at his Kahuku beachfront home at the age of 77, ending his tenure as Hawaiian Airline's Chairman of the Board. He is buried at the Oahu Cemetery in Nuuanu.

Early life and service Oleksiy Bazyuk was born in the family of Greek-Catholics in 1873 in the Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Lviv. After graduation of the popular school and gymnasium education in Stryi in 1894, he joined Faculty of Theology of the University of Lviv and the Greek-Catholic Theological Seminary in Lviv. He was ordained as priest on April 9, 1898 by Metropolitan Joseph Sembratovych for the Archeparchy of Lviv, while completing his studies in Rome. After the one year parish work, Fr. Bazyuk continued to study in the University of Vienna and served simultaneously as an assistant priest in St. Barbara's church in Vienna (1898‚Äì1900). After returning he served as a parish priest in the different villages until 1908, when he went to serve among Ukrainians in Germany for six years and was elevated in rank of a Protonotary apostolic in 1913.

The gender-equality paradox most commonly refers to the findings of a 2018 study by Gijsbert Stoet and David C. Geary that, counter-intuitively, suggests that countries with a higher level of gender equality tend to have less gender balance in fields such as science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), than less equal countries. This research originally claimed that within the study's sample, more gender equality in a country is linked with a lower proportion of women studying STEM fields. The study and its results received significant coverage in non-academic media outlets. However, separate Harvard researchers were unable to recreate the data reported in the study, and in December 2019, a correction was issued to the original paper. The correction outlined that the authors had created a previously undisclosed and unvalidated method to measure \\"propensity\\" of women and men to attain a higher degree in STEM, as opposed to the originally claimed measurement of \\"women‚Äôs share of STEM degrees\\". However, even incorporating the newly disclosed method, the investigating researchers could not recreate all the results presented. A follow-up paper by the researchers who discovered the discrepancy found conceptual and empirical problems with the gender-equality paradox in STEM hypothesis. Stoet and Geary (2018) study = Methodology and findings = The study conducted an analysis of the 2015 results (n=472,242 across 67 nations/regions) of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), the largest educational survey of its kind, focusing on the results of questions based on science aptitude and attitudes. This was contrasted with the level of gender equality as defined by the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI). The study had a number of primary findings. These can be summarized as follows: * Girls performed similarly or better than boys in two out of every three countries, and were more capable of STEM tertiary education in nearly all countries examined. *Science or mathematics is much more likely to be a personal academic strength for boys than for girls * More girls entered STEM degrees than graduated. * The difference between both the performance of girls in PISA was inversely related to the country's GGGI. * This gap was found to be correlated with the STEM graduation gap, showing that there is a similar gap between the number of girls and boys that enter STEM university programmes compared to those that complete their degrees in more gender-equal countries. It's important to note that the absolute size of the gap found was not shown to be significant. Rather it is the relative relationship between the two that was found to show an effect. In other words, no relation was found between the total number of girls who entered and completed STEM degrees and the GGGI of the country. Rather, the effect was between the relative difference in number of girls vs. boys who entered and completed STEM degrees, and the GGGI of their country. =Possible causes and criticism= The authors suggest two possible, related causes for the unexpected finding. The first relates to expectancy-value theory which suggests that students determine further education choices based on their relative strengths. Expectancy-value theory is often used to explain the difference in occupational choices between men and women. Thus, the difference would be explained by girls choosing subjects at which they are relatively stronger than STEM fields. In other words, when comparing individual students' aptitude in various areas, girls feel they are stronger in non-STEM areas. An additional explanation put forth by the authors is that the effect is further increased in societies with lower life satisfaction, as defined by the OECD Better Life Index. A cursory statistical analysis confirmed an effect between them. The rationale here would be that students make more economically motivated decisions when experiencing lower life satisfaction. Thus, in wealthier, and more gender-equal societies, students feel freer to choose study based on their interests, rather than economic motivating factors. Longitudinal studies of the same data set that was analyzed by Stoet and Geary investigated the results of implicit- association tests (IAT), which measured perceived differences in gender. No relationship was found between interest in STEM, as reported via PISA, and perceived differences in gender according to IAT. This suggests that the perception of gender-related stereotypes might have no effect on career choice. Contrary to this study, another study measured both stronger implicit gender stereotypes as measured by the IAT as well as explicit stereotypes measured by a simple questionnaire in different countries and showed an inverse relation to the representation of women in science in those countries. Other studies have challenged the idea that professed interest is a good measure of intrinsic interest. For example, one study found that the number of women already in a field predicts the stereotypes people have about that field. Related to this is another study which found a relation between the perceived sexism in a specific degree program and the expressed interest in the field amongst girls considering it. Still further studies have shown that there is a significant overlap between parent and teacher expectations around gender and STEM, and what these children express. For example, one study found that parents were less likely to think their daughters would be interested in STEM areas, and that this belief was a strong predictor of later attitudes and efficacy at science. Still further longitudinal studies found a similar effect between a mother's prediction of her daughter's success in STEM and the daughter's later career choices. Similar analyses of the effects of bias in teachers in associating STEM with boys, rather than girls, was shown to also predict future interest in STEM. Many of these longitudinal studies were performed on middle and high schoolers, showing this effect is present before the age where PISA would be taken.  Related studies  = Charles and Bradley (2009) study on economic development and gendered study choices = In 2009, Maria Charles and Karen Bradley conducted data analysis of sex segregation by field of study in 44 societies, finding a higher level of segregation in more economically developed contexts. This result could be relevant to the debate on gender equality and gender balance in study choice, as economic development is linked to gender equality. The authors note that this result seems paradoxical, as it contradicts accounts linking socioeconomic modernization to a \\"degendering\\" of public-sphere institutions such as schools and universities. = Falk and Hermle (2018) study on the relation between gendered preferences and gender equality = In 2018, Armin Falk and Johannes Hermle looked at data on 80,000 people in 76 countries to find out what might influence gender-associated differences in preferences, such as the willingness to take risks, patience, altruism, positive and negative reciprocity. Their main observation is that the more equal opportunities there are for women, the more women differ from men in their preferences. These statistical results could help explain Stoet and Geary's finding that women's educational choices diverge from men's in countries with greater gender equality, because greater gender equality could make their preferences diverge from men's.

Educated in China, Hong Kong and Cambridge, he was called to the English and Hong Kong bar in the 1920s. During the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong, he was obliged by the Japanese authority to give his opinion on matters of English law. After the second world war, he became one of the first Chinese to be appointed as magistrate. His magisterial life spanned some 17 years until his final retirement in 1970.  Early life and studies  Queen's College, a photograph from 1908 Lo Hin Shing was born in Hong Kong in 1889. His ancestral village was in Taishan in Guangdong Province of China, to which he was sent at the age of 5 to receive classical Chinese education in the ancestral halls. In 1905, at the age of 16, he returned to Hong Kong to study English at Queen's College, the prestigious government central school. Lo was appointed Head Prefect in 1912. He also frequently contributed essays to The Yellow Dragon, the school's magazine. Lo was admitted to the newly-opened University of Hong Kong in October 1912 as an Arts student. In 1918, he took the BA degree in History, Political Economy, Public Finance and Administration and Public International Law. As an undergraduate he resided at St. John's Hall, an Anglican hostel established by the Church Missionary Society. For 3 years, he taught History and English at St. Stephen's College on the invitation of the Hall's warden, the Rev. William Hewitt. Lo was also elected Chairman of the Hong Kong University Union in 1915. In 1919, Lo was admitted to Trinity Hall, Cambridge to study law. In 1922, Lo passed the Bar final examinations. On 26 June 1923, he was called to the English Bar at Inner Temple under the sponsorship of Sir Edward Clarke KC and Mr. Travers Humphreys. He took his MA at Cambridge in October 1925. During his years at Cambridge he was the president of the Chinese Students‚Äô Union.  Hong Kong bar  Since his early days, Lo had always wanted to devote himself to the service of the Republic of China. The 1925 strike in Hong Kong, and the subsequent strained relations between Britain and China, frustrated his plan. Affected by the strike, he returned to Hong Kong in February 1926 to practise criminal law. On 11 March 1926, Lo was admitted to the Hong Kong bar. Lo had soon established success in his career. In a famous case of the trial of 13 pirates from Bias Bay (R v Chung Tam Kwong), Lo successfully defended the prisoners on appeal which spared them from death sentence.R v Chung Tam Kwong & 12 Others (1931‚Äì32) 25 HKLR 31. Lo was also well read in Chinese laws and customs. Since 1926, the Supreme Court of Hong Kong recognised him as an expert on Chinese laws and customs, in which capacity he frequently gave written opinions on Chinese law not just in Hong Kong, but also in Australia and Mainland China. He also devoted himself to public service. From 1937 to 1939 he was a director of the Tung Wah Group of Hospitals. After the second world war, he was appointed by Governor Alexander Grantham as the First Chairman of the tenancy court to hear disputes under the Landlord and Tenant Ordinance. In 1960, Lo became the first local lawyer to serve as chairman of the Hong Kong Bar Association.  Japanese occupation  During the Japanese occupation, an Association of Lawyers was formed under the direction of the Japanese authority. The association consisted of 11 local legal practitioners, 2 Chinese lawyers and 1 Taiwan scholar. Lo was elected chairman. The other local lawyers included Mr. P. C. Woo, Mr. Peter Sin, Mr. Lee Hon Chi, Mr. Alfred Hon, Sir M. K. Lo, Mr. M. W. Lo and Mr. George She. The association would meet the Japanese judge once a week, who would explain certain aspects of Japanese law to members in exchange for information about some aspects of English law. The Japanese Judiciary also requested members to write papers on legal subjects of their own choice. At other times, the lawyers‚Äô practice under the Japanese occupation was restricted to conveyancing and a few civil suits, with criminal cases completely out of scope.  The bench  The Former Central Magistracy Lo started his life on the bench in April 1948, when Governor Alexander Grantham appointed him as a magistrate sitting at the Central Magistracy. He was legendary for being one of the first Chinese magistrates in Hong Kong. He became First Magistrate (or Principal Magistrate) in 1952, a position which imposed on him many administrative work in addition to his judicial work. In 1959, Lo retired from the Bench and returned to private practice. In April 1964, on the invitation of the Chief Justice, Sir Michael Hogan, Lo returned to the Bench and sat at the Causeway Bay Magistracy (Chinese: ÈäÖÈëºÁÅ£Ë£ÅÂà§Âè∏ÁΩ≤) until 1970, when he finally retired on the eve of his 80th birthday. Lo was well regarded as a magistrate. He was particularly respected for his kindness and compassion for the underprivileged. He was said to have ‚Äúalways tried to give the benefit of the doubt to the underdog‚Äù. On occasion he had also helped hawkers paid their fines out of his own pocket. On the occasion of his first retirement in 1959, Chief Justice Hogan wrote the following in a valedictory letter: Lo was also noted for his good sense of humour, for which he was well liked by lawyers.  Passing  Lo died at the age of 100 on 2 January 1989.  Personal life and beliefs  Lo was married and had 2 sons (Kenneth Lo Kwong-ki and Clement Lo Kwong-chi) and 1 daughter (Helen Lo Hoi-lun, also Lo Helen Andrene). His daughter was also a judge in Hong Kong, and died in 1988. He was a keen racing fan and a voting member of the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club. In his memoirs, Lo argued for keeping death penalty on the statute book of Hong Kong, so that an \\"extremely wicked and atrocious condemnes murderer\\" can be hanged at the Governor's discretion and with the advice of the Executive Council. He distinguished such a man from one who commits a murder under a loss of control or the influence of an unbalanced mind, who should not be hanged lest \\"creating a vicious cycle contrary to humanity\\".  Honours  Lo was made a justice of the peace in the late 1940s. He was made an MBE in December 1975 for public services in Hong Kong.

In November 2013, he paid an inspection visit to Xiangxi, Hunan province in central China. During his tour to Shibadong village in Xiangxi, Xi asked the local government to take measures to ‚Äúkeep track of every household and individual in poverty to verify that their treatment is having the desired effect.\\" Targeted poverty alleviation plays into China‚Äôs poverty alleviation strategy, and is to contribute to the Party‚Äôs century goal of ‚Äúcomprehensively building a ‚Äúmoderately prosperous society‚Äù that is the first objective of Xi Jinping‚Äôs agenda of the Four Comprehensives. In his speeches, Xi Jinping emphasizes that without solving the poverty problem in rural areas, China cannot become a moderately prosperous society. The Targeted Poverty Alleviation Strategy was officially adopted by the Chinese government in 2014. Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, said in his government report in March 2014, ‚Äúlocal governments need to merge poverty alleviation resources‚Ä¶.and take targeted measures to ensure that assistance reaches poverty-stricken villages and households.‚Äù China's Poverty Line  In November 2011, then Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao announced that China has raised the poverty line from RMB 1274 to 2300 (per capital net income). More than 128 million Chinese were living under that line, which meant they could only spend 1 US dollar per day. The World Bank‚Äôs international poverty line was $1.90 US dollars per person, per day in 2011 purchasing power parity (PPP). In 2015, the central government of China revised the poverty line, ruling that people with an annual income of less than 2800 RMB (400 US dollars per year or 1,10 US dollars per day) were in absolute poverty.  The Targeted Poverty Alleviation Campaign  In 2015, the government of the People's Republic of China initiated the ‚ÄúDecisions of the Central Committee of the CCP and the State Council on Winning the Battle of Poverty Eradication‚Äù with the aim to lift 70 million of the rural population above the poverty line until 2020. Consequently, the PRC endeavors to bring one million people per month and 30,000 people per day out of impoverishment. The Targeted Poverty Alleviation Strategy functions as a high-profile political campaign with leading groups on poverty alleviation established at all administrative levels. The campaign is accompanied by a book collecting General Secretary Xi Jinping‚Äôs quotes on poverty alleviation published by the CCP. The campaign-based approach is a common mechanism in Chinese politics in order to achieve highly prioritized political objectives within limited time. For the respective campaign, a significant amount of financial resources has been pooled: For 2019, the Chinese government has allocated 91 billion RMB (approximately 13 billion USD) to poverty alleviation funds. Additionally, the China Development Bank has pledged 400 billion RMB (approximately 57 billion USD) for the combat of poverty. Besides through the remarkable financial commitment, the PRC also mobilizes large parts of the political system as well as of the private sector to achieve its objective of poverty alleviation. = A National Poverty Registration System = In January 2014, the Central People's Government of the PRC published the \\"Opinions on Innovative Mechanisms to Promote Rural Poverty Alleviation and Development\\". In order to find the ‚Äúreal poor‚Äù and ‚Äúreally alleviate poverty‚Äù the state planned a national database (jiandang lika) where every poor household (instead of county) is registered, where their progress can be tracked and where they can be ‚Äúmanaged dynamically‚Äù. By 2019, the system registered data of 128,000 villages and 290,000 households. It identified Guizhou, Hunan, Guangxi, Sichuan and Yunnan as the most poverty-stricken areas. = ‚ÄúDecisions of the Central Committee of the CPC and the State Council on Winning the Battle of Poverty Eradication‚Äù = In November 2015, the Central Conference on Poverty Alleviation and Development adopted the ‚ÄúDecisions of the Central Committee of the CCP and the State Council on Winning the Battle of Poverty Eradication‚Äù, emphasizing the urgency of poverty alleviation in China. The guiding principles of the Decisions are the following: 1) The Four Modernizations of former core leader Deng Xiaoping; 2) The thinking of the \\"three representatives\\" (‰∏â‰∏™‰ª£Ë°®); 3) Hu Jintao‚Äòs concept of scientific development, including economic production, cultural development and political consensus; 4) The spirit of the series of keynote speeches by General Secretary Xi Jinping around the Four Comprehensives: # Comprehensively building a moderately prosperous society; # Comprehensively deepening the reform; # Comprehensively governing the nation according to law; # Comprehensively and strictly governing the Party. The Decisions develop several goals: They aim to solve ‚Äúliang buchou, san bao xian‚Äù - the ‚Äútwo no worries‚Äù (i.e. the food and clothing problem) as well as the ‚Äúthree guarantees‚Äù (i.e. guaranteed access to education, medical care and housing). Furthermore, for 2020, the per capita average of rural farmers is targeted above the national average. In order to achieve these goals, the government implements several strategies such as resettlement and industrial development of impoverished rural areas. = The Thirteenth Five-Year Plan for Poverty Alleviation = In December 2016, the State Council of the People's Republic of China issued the \\"Thirteenth Five- Year Plan for Poverty Alleviation\\", proposing to adhere to the combination of targeted assistance and overall regional development, and to promote the implementation of a number of poverty alleviation projects. = The ‚Äútough battle‚Äù against poverty = In October 2017, Xi urged ‚Äúall-out‚Äù efforts to fight the ‚Äútough battle‚Äù against poverty. Two months later a statement was issued after the Central Economic Work Conference which also targeted poverty alleviation as one of three ‚Äútough battles‚Äù to win on the following three years, along with major risk control and pollution prevention. Significant measures were applied to reach the goal. Banks were encouraged to give microloans to farmers. Rural cooperatives were set up in many places allowing farmers to put together their resources to raise production. = ‚ÄúGuiding Opinions on the Three-Year Action Plan to Win the Battle against Poverty‚Äù = In August 2018, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued ‚ÄúGuiding Opinions on the Three Year Action Plan to Win the Battle against Poverty‚Äù. The opinions emphasize three major objectives for the last three years of the battle: 1) consolidate the achievements of poverty alleviation; 2) ensure that there are no more poverty-stricken counties and raise the per capita income of the rural population; 3) establish and enhance basic public services in rural areas. = Targeted Poverty Alleviation in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic = In a speech on March 2020 on the ‚ÄòSymposium on the decisive battle and decisive victory in the fight to get rid of poverty‚Äô, Xi Jinping stated that the CCP‚Äôs goal to lift all of the PRC‚Äôs population out of poverty until 2020 was still within reach ‚Äì even with increased obstacles due to the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, Xi also emphasized that the achievement of this goal in 2020 would not mean an end to the party‚Äôs efforts. A transitional period and enhanced control mechanisms might have to be put in place to prevent unsustainable poverty alleviation and to expose fake poverty alleviation (ËôöÂÅáËÑ±Ë¥´ x≈´ ji«é tu≈ç p√≠n). This sentiment is also reflected in Li Keqiang‚Äòs statement during a press conference in the course of the 13th National People's Congress in May 2020. Li also spoke about the increased difficulties posed to the CCP‚Äôs commitment for 2020. But he also stated that with increased efforts by all government levels and the deployment of security and rescue funds, getting rid of poverty within 2020 was still the unchanged goal for the CCP. = Outlook = Around 30 million people will still be waiting to be lifted out of poverty by 2020. Those left behind will face the most difficulty getting over the poverty line. Many live in very remote areas, which lack the resources needed to develop. These people will need to be relocated. Between 2016 and 2020, the government plans to relocate 9.8 million people, most of them from western provinces. Some are disabled or seriously ill and rely solely on government allowances.  Political actors and structures  = Xi Jinping = Poverty alleviation has been one of Xi Jinping‚Äòs priorities. The ruling Communist Party of China, led by General Secretary Xi, set 2020 as the year that the country should wipe out poverty and become a moderately prosperous society or ‚ÄúXiaokang‚Äú Xi said \\"no one should be left behind on the road towards Xiaokang.‚Äù China's official media reports that state Xi has toured dozens of impoverished villages since he took office as General Secretary of the Communist Party of China (paramount leader) in 2012, ‚Äúsharing his rich experience in poverty-eradication work and putting himself on the front lines of the war on poverty.‚Äù = Party-state institutions = The Party-state‚Äôs poverty alleviation strategy is implemented on all administrative levels. At the central level, it is led by two main institutional bodies: the State Council‚Äôs Leading Group for Poverty Alleviation and Development (ÂõΩÂä°Èô¢Êâ∂Ë¥´ÂºÄÂèëÈ¢ÜÂØºÂ∞èÁªÑ gu√≥ w√π yu√†n f√∫ p√≠n kƒÅi fƒÅ l«êng d«éo xi«éo z«î) led by PRC Vice Premier Hu Chunhua represents the main state institution mandated with poverty alleviation. Within the structures of the Communist Party of China, there exists an additional Central Leading Small Group for Rural Work (‰∏≠Â§ÆÂÜúÊùëÂ∑•‰ΩúÈ¢ÜÂØºÂ∞èÁªÑ zh≈çng yƒÅng n√≥ng c≈´n g≈çng zu√≤ l«êng d«éo xi«éo z«î) that also oversees poverty alleviation in the Chinese countryside. This group is led by PRC Minister of Agriculture and Rural Affairs Han Changfu. 1\\\\. The two leading groups have their counterparts at all administrative levels down to the township level. = State mechanisms of policy implementation = The PRC uses several mechanisms in order to implement the centralized poverty alleviation strategy effectively.  Vertical political integration - tiao tiao (Êù°Êù°) and horizontal political integration - kuai kuai (ÂùóÂùó) Vertical political integration, (tiao tiao (Êù°Êù°)) is used in order to link governmental instances vertically to higher instances at the center. In that manner, the higher scales pass down the central policy. The lower scales, such as localities, enjoy self-governing rights and are free to develop their own strategies to achieve poverty alleviation. Horizontal political integration (kuai kuai (ÂùóÂùó)) is used to include various governmental sectors. Cross-system leading groups exist which consist of the leaders of all relevant departments such as the ones in charge of party affairs, finance, education, transportation, the armed police as well as the discipline inspection commission.  Pairing-up  The nation-wide classification of ‚Äúpoor‚Äù households is achieved through a national registration system which enables local officials to collect data from each individual person, household and village. Each household that has been designated as poor, is assigned a cadre who serves as a personal advisor in the household‚Äôs poverty alleviation. Once considered poor, households have a ‚Äútargeted support contact card‚Äù (Á≤æÂáÜÂ∏ÆÊâ∂ËÅîÁ≥ªÂç° jƒ´ng zh«în bƒÅng f√∫ li√°n x√¨ k«é) hung on their doors, which records the name of their cadre and the amount of subsidies the household is receiving.  Monitoring and Evaluation  A profound system of monitoring and evaluation contributes to the effectiveness of the targeted poverty alleviation campaign. Cadres are obliged to follow due process and report each step of implementation of poverty alleviation action. While good performance is rewarded with promotions and bonuses, bad performance is sanctioned with salary cuts, reduction in the bonus and refusals of promotions. Evaluation is carried out as a two-way-mechanism as cadres from higher scales control lower scales and the other way around. The individual households also assess the performance of their personal cadres. This motivates the cadres to lift their assigned households over the poverty line. = The role of the villages =  Background information on village-level poverty alleviation: ‚ÄúBuilding a new socialist countryside‚Äù  The divide of living standards between coastal provinces and the interior regions as well as the divide between cities and the countryside grew massively since the mid-1990s. The nationwide implementation of the Targeted Poverty Alleviation Campaign and its accompanying measures for rapid poverty reduction, has led to considerable changes in village structures. Two main political goals are apparent: (1) new (adapted) governance structures enhance the overall effectiveness of the set of measures and (2) enable the party-state to reclaim lost ground in the villages. The latter must be considered in the light of the manifold reforms after the Reform and Opening-up in the 1978, in particular the introduction of the Household responsibility system, and rural tax reforms in 2006. These profound changes enabled the rural population to emancipate themselves from the reliance on local party cadres and the institutionalized dependencies. The party-state experienced a governance crisis in rural areas of the country. As part of its fight against poverty in the countryside, the Chinese Communist Party announced its plan of ‚Äúbuilding a new socialist countryside‚Äù (Âª∫ËÆæÁ§æ‰ºö‰∏ª‰πâÊñ∞ÂÜúÊùë) in 2005. The aim was to deal with three problems in the countryside: suffering amongst village people, poverty in the countryside, as well as threats to agriculture.  The First-Secretary-in-Residence-Scheme  There were setbacks in the implementation of ‚Äúbuilding a new socialist countryside‚Äù due to the governance crisis on the countryside. Policies from the top were not followed at the lowest level of government. This was particularly an issue in rural areas in the Southwest, more specifically in ethnic-minority villages in Southwest China. In these areas, clannism hindered higher-level authorities from fully governing the villages. Clans in control would rule villages according to their own interests. Oftentimes, village cadres were clan members. In the past, the party had relied on local clans in order to maintain stability in the villages. Such villages were effectively independent kingdoms (Áã¨Á´ãÁéãÂõΩ d√∫ l√¨ w√°ng gu√≥). Money received from higher-level authorities for poverty alleviation was used for the benefit of clan members. Thus, Beijing was facing a lack of authority in certain parts of the country and hence had difficulties to fight rural poverty. To be better able to decrease poverty rates in the countryside, the party put in place the system of a rural first- secretary-in-residence (È©ªÊùëÁ¨¨‰∏Ä‰π¶ËÆ∞ zh√π c≈´n d√¨ yƒ´ sh≈´j√¨ ). The first secretary sent to a specific village was to be in charge of the two village committees (Êùë‰∏§Âßî c≈´n li«éng wƒõi), the party committee and the villagers‚Äô committee, which up until then had been led by the party secretary (ÊùëÊîØ‰π¶ c≈´n zhƒ´sh≈´) and chairman (Êùë‰∏ª‰ªª c≈´n zh«î r√®n) respectively. In this system, the first secretary was a provincial cadre sent to the village for two years while still being employed by provincial authorities. The role was designed to fight clannism and enable effective poverty alleviation.  The case of Targeted Poverty Alleviation on village level: The Villagers Poverty Alleviation Working Committee in Ximeng, Yunnan Province  New village governance structures within the existing village constitution have been developed in recent years. One example for these recent efforts is the Villagers Poverty Alleviation Working Committee (ÊùëÊ∞ëÂ∞èÁªÑËÑ±Ë¥´Â∑•‰ΩúÂßîÂëò‰ºö c≈´nm√≠n xi«éoz«î tu≈çp√≠n g≈çngzu√≤ wƒõiyu√°nhu√¨ ) in Ximeng County in Yunnan Province. Led by the ‚Äútwo Committees‚Äù (‰∏§Âßî liang wei ), which are the local party branch (Êùë‰∏≠ÂõΩÂÖ±‰∫ßÂÖöÂëòÊîØÈÉ®ÂßîÂëò‰ºö cun zhongguo gongchandang yuzhibu weiyuanhui ) and the village committee (ÊùëÊ∞ëËá™Ê≤ªÂßîÂëò‰ºö cunmin zizhi weiyuanhui ), the Villagers Poverty Alleviation Working Committee is composed of five to seven members (based on the number of households in the village) who are responsible for the success of their assigned households (ea. 15-30 households per committee member) to overcome poverty. The membership structure within the Committee resembles the existing power structure in the village. Members of the Committee include local party officials, leaders of the village community and leaders of the local branches of mass organizations. Accordingly, up to 60% of committee members are directly affiliated with the CCP. The Committees hold weekly internal meetings and monthly public meetings. Intra-Committee positions include a production officer (Áîü‰∫ßÂßîÂëò shengchan weiyuan), a life officer (ÁîüÊ¥ªÂßîÂëò shenghuo weiyuan), a public security officer (Ê≤ªÂÆâÂßîÂëò zhian weiyuan ) and a propaganda officer (ÂÆ£‰º†ÂßîÂëò xuanzhuan weiyuan ). The Committee uses its powers particularly in two ways: (1) Through the newly established Village Labor Service Posts (ÊùëÂä°ÂíåÂä≥Âä°ÊúçÂä°Â≤ó cunwu he laowu fuwugang ), the committee members can force villagers into employment. (2) Through a reward and punishment mechanism (ÂÆåÂñÑÂ•ñÊÉ©Êú∫Âà∂ wanshan jiangcheng jizhi ), villagers are classified according to their job performance, political attitude, participation in village affairs and other factors in two lists. Villagers on the red list will receive rewards in financial payment and/or payment in kind. Villagers on the black list may lose financial support by the government. The new Committee System of Ximeng has met with positive response on the national level and received the national poverty alleviation innovation award (ÂÖ®ÂõΩËÑ±Ë¥´ÊîªÂùöÁªÑÁªáÂàõÊñ∞Â•ñ quanguo tuopin gongjian zuzhi chuangxin jiang ) in September 2019. The prominence through the national award may stimulate additional counties implementing Ximeng‚Äôs governance innovation. = Society = The Chinese Government regards the participation of the whole society crucial for overcoming poverty. Therefore, the central government announced a statement on November 19th 2014 by the General Office of the State Council, how to mobilize all social forces to participate in poverty reduction and development in China. Participation by private companies is a significant factor to reduce poverty in the PRC. Through the aid and collaboration of private companies, the market economy can be stimulated and new capital and technology can be brought into the countryside. Private enterprises are considered to bring job opportunities, career training, investments and donations to rural China. Individuals can also join the effort of poverty alleviation. To reduce social and economic disparities between East and West, the government encourages cooperation of Eastern and Western business sectors, offers vocational training and sends talented youth and professionals from East to remote areas in Western China. The Chinese government fosters education of voluntary organizations which encourage the advantages of respective participants, e.g. students, experts, technicians, retirees, and other members of society. Thus, a service network of volunteers is built in rural Western China. Furthermore, the Chinese government promotes an intensive system to encourage social participation in poverty allocation, via commendations, awards, and better career opportunities. Through the establishment of common projects or brands, sales are promoted or donations are given to projects to help people that are identified as poor. Also, for the poor villages and households who have difficulty in using the internet or who do not have access to the internet, information services are established to offer detailed project plans and improve the efficiency of resource allocation.  ‚Äú10,000 Enterprises Help 10,000 Villages‚Äù (‰∏á‰ºÅÂ∏Æ‰∏áÊùë wanqi bang wancun)  The \\"10,000 Enterprises Help 10,000 Villages\\" (‰∏á‰ºÅÂ∏Æ‰∏áÊùë) project is a large-scale example of the integration of the private sector and society into Targeted Poverty Alleviation. It functions through three mechanisms: (1) poverty alleviation through industry, (2) poverty alleviation through employment and (3) poverty alleviation through public welfare. First, in the context of the ‚Äú10,000 Enterprises Help 10,000 Villages‚Äù project, industrial enterprises should grant poor villages and households access to the respective development benefits that enterprises generate in poverty-stricken areas through the exploitation of natural resources. Enterprises should expand their rural business, give full play to the advantages of Internet Plus, strengthen cooperation with postal services, supply and marketing cooperation and other systems, help villages and households connect to the market, and expand online and offline sale channels. Large enterprises are encouraged to set up industrial investment funds in poverty-stricken areas and adopt a market-oriented operation method for the construction of industrial parks. Secondly, enterprises should furthermore be encouraged to recruit employees, strengthen pre-job and in-service training, provide labor and social security and achieve stable employment and income increase for poor households. Enterprises also should encourage private vocational colleges and vocational skill training institutions to recruit children from poor households, combine enterprise poverty alleviation with vocational education, and realize poverty alleviation through the development of skills. Thirdly, enterprises are encouraged to make direct donations, set up poverty alleviation public welfare funds, grant poverty alleviation public trusts or carry out poverty alleviation through public welfare organizations. In order to help impoverished villages, enterprises ought to engage in projects of infrastructural, medical, educational, social and cultural development. As part of the ‚Äú10,000 Enterprises Help 10,000 Villages‚Äù project, companies like the Alibaba Group have been very visible in poverty alleviation in recent years. Alibaba has lent over 100 billion RMB (14.3 billion USD) to more than 2 million users in poverty-stricken counties in the PRC. Between 2017 and 2022, the holding plans to invest 10 billion RMB (1,43 billion USD) into poverty alleviation projects in the fields of education, e-commerce, health, women empowerment and environmental protection. One of Alibaba‚Äôs biggest initiatives is the establishment of Taobao Villages that are named after Alibaba‚Äôs online shopping website Taobao. These villages are transformed into e-commerce hubs to encourage farmers to sell their products online. Annual e-commerce transactions of over 10 million RMB and more than 100 online stores qualify a village for the title Taobao Village. Taobao Villages were established in cooperation with villagers who had returned from bigger cities with entrepreneurial skills and the support of local governments providing infrastructure, e-commerce training, finance and subsidies for specialized e-commerce service providers and companies. A tool for direct participation of citizens is the website ‚ÄúSocial Participation in Poverty Alleviation and Development in China‚Äù run by the China Social Poverty Alleviation Network. On this website, people that are classified as poor can ask for donations for medical, educational or housing purposes. By donating on this website, people can directly support poverty-stricken households. Moreover, people can buy products from poor regions and crowdfund poverty alleviation projects.  Preliminary Achievements and Criticism  According to Liu Yongfu, director of the State Council Leading Group Office of Poverty Alleviation and Development, nearly 100 million people were recognized by the Chinese government as poor people. But from 2012 to 2016, more than half of the population living under the poverty line has been lifted out of poverty. An average of 1.3 million poor people cleared the poverty line per year during the five-year period. The Targeted Poverty Alleviation Campaign and the fast allocation of resources have quickly raised the living standards of many households in rural China. From 2015 to 2019, 68 million people were lifted out of rural poverty. This corresponds to 37,000 people per day. The national poverty rate changed from 10.2% in 2015 to 3.1% in 2019. However, the political necessity to achieve the 2020 target led various counties to develop quick fixes instead of sustainable strategies that would lead to economic benefits in the long run. Academics report that households often receive one- time financial or material support in order to officially escape the poverty line. However, it is possible that such recipients of aid will fall back into poverty once the Targeted Poverty Alleviation Campaign comes to its end. A further point of criticism refers to the possibility of cadres manipulating the poverty alleviation statistics of households for the sake of personal promotion. Cadres may thus focus on the compliance with the implementation system and do not consider the alleviation of poverty as their primary objective. Additionally, Targeted Poverty Alleviation principally addresses relatively better-off poor households as their promotion is more likely to benefit the local economy. The least well-off of the poor are often excluded from public support. Similarly, conflicts exist between poor households and those that are not classified as poor. Households are encouraged to feign poverty in order to receive state benefits from the Targeted Poverty Alleviation Campaign. In this context, cadres may prioritize their relatives and friends as poverty-stricken households.

It was released on August 25, 1970, by Canyon Records (Hollywood). Background Roger Nupie, in a personal communication with The Nina Simone Database, who suggest these may be Simone's earliest existing recordings and may have been \\"made in Philadelphia 1955(?)\\", states that there is \\"no info\\" about the date, location or musicians. He goes on to state that the album was \\"originally not intended for release\\" and that Andrew Stroud, Simone's manager, added strings arranged by Monk Higgins to eight tracks and released them as \\"Gifted and Black\\" in 1970. Another source indicates that the album was possibly recorded in 1967 at RPM Studios, Los Angeles. Critical Reception Rolling Stone said in a contemporary review: \\"It's not that this album, recorded around 1967 (?), is misrepresentative of what Nina is currently up to, and does a disservice to an exceptional artist's career. It's not that the strings, which are dubbed over her piano trio are in poor, nay, bad taste. It's not that it sounds as though the recording mikes were placed down the hall from the studio, in the toilet, perhaps. It's not that \\"The Thrill is Gone\\" is absolutely the most embarrassing musical miscarriage I've ever heard. No, it's not any of these at all. It's just that this album is pisspoor.\\" However, although Richard Mortifoglio for AllMusic called the sound \\"decidedly lo-fi\\", he also considered it \\"something of a lost cabaret masterpiece ... as if she was channeling the great cabaret artist Mabel Mercer, reminding us that apart from her deserved reputation as a socially significant African-American artist, Nina Simone was also an outstanding interpreter of the Great American Songbook.\\" Track listing Credit * Nina Simone ‚Äì Arranger, Composer, Primary Artist * Bennie Benjamin ‚Äì Composer * Gloria Caldwell ‚Äì Composer * Henry Creamer ‚Äì Composer * Richie Havens ‚Äì Composer * Fletcher Hendersor ‚Äì Composer * Jan Hendin ‚Äì Composer * Weldon Irvine ‚Äì Composer * Leroy Kirkland ‚Äì Composer * Turner Layton ‚Äì Composer * Galt MacDermot ‚Äì Composer * Sol Marcus ‚Äì Composer References Category:Nina Simone albums Category:1970 albums ","title":"Gifted &amp; Black"},{"id":"58652653","text":"Kamyshi () is a rural locality (a selo) and the administrative center of Kamyshinsky Selsoviet of Nemetsky National District, Altai Krai, Russia.

Milan during the German occupation =Background= After the Italian surrender on 8 September 1943 and the occupation of northern Italy by German forces, Milan became a centre for processing, interrogating and torturing captured resistance fighters and Jews, which was carried out by both the German police and the Italian Muti police unit. Prisoners were held at San Vittore Prison, but were also taken for interrogation and torture at either the headquarters of the German police at Hotel Regina or at the headquarter of the Muti unit in an army base at Via Rovello. The German police in Milan was under the command of SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer Theo Saevecke. Saevecke was sentenced in absentia in 1999, but never extradited, for ordering the Piazzale Loreto massacre‚Äîthe public execution on 10 August 1944 of 15 Italian partisans who had been hand-picked by Saevecke, as a reprisal for a partisan attack on a German military convoy. The executed were left on display for a number of days. The same Piazzale Loreto became the scene of the public display of Benito Mussolini's corpse on 29 April 1945. The Muti police unit, based in Milan and named after Ettore Muti, was commanded by Francesco Colombo and acquired a reputation for ruthlessness and brutality during anti-partisan operations. Members of the unit were convicted in 1947 by a court in Milan for crimes ranging from blackmail to murder and rape. =Deportation= Milan served as central deportation place for the Jews of northern Italy, who were brought there from other cities like Genoa and Turin as well as rural regions like the Aosta Valley. The loading of deportees onto carriages took place in the early mornings to ensure secrecy and also prevent disruption of the vital daily mail and freight services. The first holocaust train with deportees left Milan from Platform 21 on 6 December 1943, carrying 169 Jews to Auschwitz; only 5 of them survived the Holocaust. A second train left on 30 January 1944, carrying 600 deportees, 40 of them children including Liliana Segre, who were taken on a seven-day journey to Auschwitz. Upon arrival at Auschwitz on the morning of 6 February, 500 of them were killed within a few hours and their bodies burned in the crematorium. Between 6 December 1943 and 15 January 1945, when the last train left for Bolzano, 20 trains and up to 1,200 Jewish prisoners left Milan from Platform 21 for either the Italian transit camps at Fossoli and Bolzano, or Auschwitz, Mauthausen, and Bergen-Belsen. Memorial Platform 21 remained virtually forgotten for the next four decades. It was rediscovered in 1995 when the local Catholic organization Sant‚ÄôEgidio made the Jewish community of Milan aware of it. In 2002, work began to turn the site into a memorial for the deported. But the project stalled and progressed very slowly over the next decade. The idea to construct a memorial came from the then-Archbishop of Milan, Carlo Maria Martini. Partial funding for the project, which was estimated to cost approximately US$15.6 million, was secured through the local government and sponsors. The project could not, however, be financially supported by the local Jewish community, which lacked the resources. While the project did not encounter active opposition, it was hampered by a certain disinterest and embarrassment in Italy, where the Italian contribution to the Holocaust in the country is still a controversial subject. On 27 January 2013, Holocaust Remembrance Day, the memorial was inaugurated in the presence of Prime Minister Mario Monti, officials from Italian State Railways and other institutional and religious dignitaries and guests. According to the foundation for the memorial, Binario 21 is the only European site which was involved in the deportations that still remains intact. The memorial features two original freight cars that were used in the deportations, and a wall onto which the names of the people deported from the station to concentration camps are projected. In recent times, the memorial has also served as a shelter for refugees from Syria and Eritrea, who have travelled through Libya to reach Italy.

Sources sometimes identify him as \\"Jussuf\\" which was the pseudonym under which his regular contributions to the Berliner B√∂rsen-Courier (newspaper) appeared.  Biography  Faktor was the son of German Jews. He studied law in his home city and received a doctorate of law degree in 1904. He also worked as an editor and critic for Bohemia magazine. In 1908 he moved from Prague to Berlin, where he wrote for the illustrated daily newspaper Der Tag. From 1912 he was responsible the \\"Feuilleton\\" section along with theater and music editorship at the Berliner B√∂rsen-Courier (literally, \\"Berlin Stock Exchange Courier\\"), for which he became editor-in-chief in 1917. In the following years, he became one of the city's best-known theater critics. Emil Faktor married Sophie Sack around 1913. Their children Richard and Lili were born in 1914 and 1917 during the war years. Fourteen years younger than her husband, Sophie Sack was a talented concert pianist whose teachers had included Artur Schnabel. As was so often the case at that time, she married just as her professional career was beginning to take off, and domestic duties now took precedence. In addition to his journalistic work, Faktor also wrote poetry and plays. Among others, he published poetry books What I Seek (1899) and Jahresringe (1908), and comedies The Temperate (1914) and The Daughter (1917). In 1931 Faktor was forced to resign - reportedly \\"at his own wish\\" - from his post as editor-in-chief because of his Jewish ancestry.T√§ubert, Klaus. Emil Faktor: Ein Mann und seine Zeitung. Berlin: Edition Hentrich 1994, p. 111f. In 1933 he returned with his wife Sophie to Prague. There he continued to work as a freelance journalist and critic for the Prague Tagblatt and the Prague Noon. The Faktors' daughter Lili fled to the United States of America in March 1939, and she arranged the affidavits necessary to permit her parents to follow her there, but the US authorities appear to have been applying restrictive immigration quotas: Emil and Sophie Faktor never obtained entry visas for the United States.

He matriculated at University College, Oxford on 13 October 1710, aged 17. He succeeded his father in the baronetcy in November 1726. In 1729, he married Mary Aislabie, daughter of John Aislabie of Studley, Yorkshire who was Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1718 to 1721. Slingsby was returned as a Tory Member of Parliament for Knaresborough on his family's interest at a by- election on 17 May 1714. He was defeated at the general election of 1715, but regained his seat in 1722. He was returned unopposed at the general elections of 1727, 1734 and 1741 and voted regularly with the Opposition. In 1743 he was put forward by a French emissary to be one of a council to be set up to advise the Young Pretender on his arrival in England following a Jacobite rising and French invasion. Although he was not appointed, he was one of the few people who were given military details of the proposed French landing.

Early Life and Education A native of Bath Beach, Brooklyn, Favale attended Saint Finbar School and William Grady High School before graduating from Brooklyn College. While he was a teenager, two of Favale‚Äôs brothers died within three years of each other, an experience that later served as inspiration for his musical Hereafter. Broadcasting Career In 1982, while working in the commercial traffic department at WYNY, Favale auditioned for and appeared on Late Night with David Letterman. He went on to co-found and serve as vice president of programming at Comedy Central, where he developed the television series State of the Union Undressed, created and hosted The 800 Club, and served as producer of the Real Deal. Favale was a producer for David Letterman during his run on CBS late night shows,, supervising Late Show with David Letterman from 1996 through its finale in 2015. Between 1998 and 2001 he also oversaw the Howard Stern Radio Show, part of CBS‚Äô late night programming. He often appeared as himself on both shows. In 2003, a David Letterman comedy piece that featured Favale was given a ‚ÄúCheer‚Äù by TV Guide. In 2004, Howard Stern featured a song that Favale had written (\\"Restless, Restless\\") on his morning radio show as part of the \\"Restless Restless Song Contest.\\" One of the most popular submissions of Favale‚Äôs song was by Robert Goulet. A ‚ÄúBest Of‚Äù compilation CD was eventually released on Bandcamp. One of Favale‚Äôs most well knows segments on The Howard Stern Show was from 2012 when he brought in video love letters he made in 1984 (aka the \\"Debbie Tapes\\") when he was wooing his soon to be wife Debbie. In 2015 Favale was executive producer of \\"David Letterman: A Life in Television,\\" a prime-time tribute. Favale was the only member of Letterman‚Äôs team to stay on when Stephen Colbert took over, and after he helped overseee the refurbishing of the Ed Sullivan Theater prior to its launch he served as the overseeing supervisor for The Late Show With Stephen Colbert. He eventually became the vice-president of East Coast late- night programming at CBS. In April 2017 he was named SVP Talent Development at CBS Television Studios with responsibilities including \\"identify[ing] comedic talent and develop[ing] programming for the studio.\\" In June of 2018 Favale added creative oversight of the new division CBS Experiences. He was the Executive Producer of the inaugural event, \\"An Evening with Sunday Morning.\\" Later that year he was accused of using derogatory language towards those of alternate sexual orientations in the workplace, and was placed on leave, and used those same words regardless of orientation. Favale denied the allegations with the following statement: \\"Allegations that I have ever retaliated against anyone in any fashion are 100% false. I have spent my entire career working at comedy shows, where there has always been a wide latitude to make transgressive jokes while preparing the program. While we make a lot of jokes, these jokes attributed to me, whether said in rehearsals or production meetings, are being taken out of context and were not said in the way being presented here.\\" Favale finished out his contract with CBS and announced in September of 2019 that he was launching his own production company, Favale Media. CBS President of Entertainment Kelly Kahl stated in a joint press release: \\"We thank Vinnie for his many years and accomplishments at CBS and wish him and his new company all the best.\\" Other Work Favale wrote (with Frankie Keane) and produced Hereafter, an off-Broadway musical about dealing with the loss of a loved one. Favale was inspired to write the musical after the 2003 death of a New Jersey teenager, which brought back memories of dealing with the deaths of two of his brothers as a teenager. After raising $60,000 through a Kickstarter campaign, Hereafter opened at the Theater 80 in 2012 to positive reviews. A second production was mounted at the Snapple Theater Center in 2014 [11] and was featured on WPIX. An Argentine production of Hereafter opened at Buenos Aires‚Äô Metropolitan Sura in 2017. Actor and singer Danny Aiello recorded the Hereafter song \\"Talk To Me,\\" and Favale is working with Aiello on a film version of the musical. Favale served as a board member for Project Rebirth, the nonprofit organization that released Rebirth, a documentary film about the September 11 attacks that premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2011 and received a Peabody Award. Favale also wrote Web-Sightings: A Collection of Web Sites We‚Äôd Like to See, \\"one of the first consumer-focused books about the internet,\\" published in 1996 by Pocket Books. Favale has volunteered his services with two New Jersey-based grief centers: Good Grief and Common Ground.

A flat unramified morphism is called an √©tale morphism. Less strongly, if f satisfies the conditions when restricted to sufficiently small neighborhoods of x and y, then f is said to be unramified near x. Some authors prefer to use weaker conditions, in which case they call a morphism satisfying the above a G-unramified morphism.  Simple example  Let A be a ring and B the ring obtained by adjoining an integral element to A; i.e., B = A[t]/(F) for some monic polynomial F. Then \\\\operatorname{Spec}(B) \\\\to \\\\operatorname{Spec}(A) is unramified if and only if the polynomial F is separable (i.e., it and its derivative generate the unit ideal of A[t]).  Curve case  Let f: X \\\\to Y be a finite morphism between smooth connected curves over an algebraically closed field, P a closed point of X and Q = f(P). We then have the local ring homomorphism f^{\\\\\\\\#} : \\\\mathcal{O}_Q \\\\to \\\\mathcal{O}_P where (\\\\mathcal{O}_Q, \\\\mathfrak{m}_Q) and (\\\\mathcal{O}_P, \\\\mathfrak{m}_P) are the local rings at Q and P of Y and X. Since \\\\mathcal{O}_P is a discrete valuation ring, there is a unique integer e_P > 0 such that f^{\\\\\\\\#} (\\\\mathfrak{m}_Q) \\\\mathcal{O}_P = {\\\\mathfrak{m}_P}^{e_P}. The integer e_P is called the ramification index of P over Q. Since k(P) = k(Q) as the base field is algebraically closed, f is unramified at P (in fact, √©tale) if and only if e_P = 1. Otherwise, f is said to be ramified at P and Q is called a branch point.  Characterization  Given a morphism f: X \\\\to Y that is locally of finite presentation, the following are equivalent: # f is unramified. # The diagonal map \\\\delta_f: X \\\\to X \\\\times_Y X is an open immersion. # The relative cotangent sheaf \\\\Omega_{X/Y} is zero.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013. History Postal service in Flint was established in 1832, and the post office location changed a number of times through the nineteenth century. At the beginning of the twentieth century, Flint began to grow hand-in-hand with the rise of the automobile industry, and in 1909 the post office moved into a new building on Kearsley Street. However, Flint's rapid growth quickly made even the new post office too small. In response, an addition was built in 1921, and a branch office established in 1925. However, even in 1926, the postal facilities were woefully inadequate, with lines for the teller window stretching over half a block on occasions. Local citizens lobbied the US government for a new building, and in 1927 announced that a new Flint Post Office would be placed in the first building program authorized for funding. A site was chosen in 1928, and in 1930 James A. Wetmore, Acting Supervisory Architect of the Treasury Department, signed off on a set of plans for the new building. Construction was completed in 1931. In addition to housing a new post office, the Internal Revenue Service, United States Department of Agriculture, United States Army, and United States Navy all opened offices in the new building. The building served as the main Flint facility until about 1960, when a new post office was constructed. The Church Street location was remodeled to serve as a branch post office, as well as housing other federal facilities including the courts. Description The Flint Federal Building is a classical Art Moderne two-story building faced with Kasota limestone. The front facade is symmetrical, end extends for 230 feet along Church Street. The facade contains a broad pavilion with colonnade with four bays to each side. A terrace edged with a balustrade projects from the central pavilion, and leads to three pedimented doorways. Window openings in the central colonnade and the side bays feature stacked windows with spandrels between them. Polychromatic terra- cotta panels with Art Moderne iconography, thematic to the buildings use, are set into the spandrels as well as into the parapet wall above. A large one- story wing and a modern secure garage project from the rear of the building.

Geometrically, each BFS corresponds to a corner of the polyhedron of feasible solutions. If there exists an optimal solution, then there exists an optimal BFS. Hence, to find an optimal solution, it is sufficient to consider the BFS-s. This fact is used by the simplex algorithm, which essentially travels from some BFS to another until an optimal one is found.  Definition  To define a BFS, we first present the linear program in the so-called equational form: :maximize \\\\mathbf{c^T} \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{x} :subject to A\\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\mathbf{b} and \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\ge 0 where: * \\\\mathbf{c^T} and \\\\mathbf{x} are vectors of size n (the number of variables); * \\\\mathbf{b} is a vector of size m (the number of constraints); * A is an m-by-n matrix; * \\\\mathbf{x} \\\\ge 0 means that all variables are non-negative. Any linear program can be converted into an equational form by adding slack variables. As a preliminary clean-up step, we verify that: * The system A\\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\mathbf{b} has at least one solution (otherwise the whole LP has no solution and there is nothing more to do); * All m rows of the matrix A are linearly independent, i.e., its rank is m (otherwise we can just delete redundant rows without changing the LP). Typically m < n, so the system A\\\\mathbf{x} = \\\\mathbf{b} has many solutions; each such solution is called a feasible solution of the LP. Let B be a subset of m indices from {1,...,n}. Denote by A_B the square m-by-m matrix made of the m columns of A indexed by B. If A_B is nonsingular, the columns indexed by B are a basis of the column space of A. In this case, we call B a basis of the LP. Since the rank of A is m, it has at least one basis; since A has n columns, it has at most \\\\binom{n}{m} bases. Given a basis B, we say that a feasible solution \\\\mathbf{x} is a basic feasible solution with basis B if all its non-zero variables are indexed by B, i.e., for all j ot\\\\in B: ~~ x_j = 0.  Properties  1\\\\. A BFS is determined only by the constraints of the LP (the matrix A and the vector \\\\mathbf{b}); it does not depend on the optimization objective. 2\\\\. By definition, a BFS has at most m non-zero variables and at least n-m zero variables. A BFS can have less than m non-zero variables; in that case, it can have many different bases, all of which contain the indices of its non-zero variables. 3\\\\. A feasible solution \\\\mathbf{x} is basic if-and-only-if the columns of the matrix A_K are linearly independent, where K is the set of indices of the non-zero elements of \\\\mathbf{x}. 4\\\\. A BFS is uniquely determined by the basis B: for each basis B of m indices, there is at most one BFS \\\\mathbf{x_B} with basis B. This is because \\\\mathbf{x_B} must satisfy the constraint A_B \\\\mathbf{x_B} = b, and by definition of basis the matrix A_B is non-singular, so the constraint has a unique solution. The opposite is not true: each BFS can come from many different bases. If the unique solution of A_B \\\\mathbf{x_B} = b satisfies the non-negativity constraints, then the basis is called a feasible basis. 5\\\\. If a linear program has an optimal solution (i.e., it has a feasible solution, and the set of feasible solutions is bounded), then it has an optimal BFS. This is a consequence of the Bauer maximum principle: the objective of a linear program is convex; the set of feasible solutions is convex (it is an intersection of hyperspaces); therefore the objective attains its maximum in an extreme point of the set of feasible solutions. Since the number of BFS-s is finite and bounded by \\\\binom{n}{m}, an optimal solution to any LP can be found in finite time by just evaluating the objective function in all \\\\binom{n}{m}BFS-s. This is not the most efficient way to solve an LP; the simplex algorithm examines the BFS-s in a much more efficient way.  Examples  Consider a linear program with the following constraints: \\\\begin{align} x_1 + 5 x_2 + 3 x_3 + 4 x_4 + 6 x_5 &= 14 \\\\\\\\\\\\ x_2 + 3 x_3 + 5 x_4 + 6 x_5 &= 7 \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\forall i\\\\in\\\\\\\\{1,\\\\ldots,5\\\\\\\\}: x_i&\\\\geq 0 \\\\end{align} The matrix A is: A = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 5 & 3 & 4 & 6 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 0 & 1 & 3 & 5 & 6 \\\\end{pmatrix} ~~~~~ \\\\mathbf{b} = (14~~7) Here, m=2 and there are 10 subsets of 2 indices, however, not all of them are bases: the set {3,5} is not a basis since columns 3 and 5 are linearly dependent. The set B={2,4} is a basis, since the matrix A_B = \\\\begin{pmatrix} 5 & 4 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 5 \\\\end{pmatrix} is non-singular. The unique BFS corresponding to this basis is x_B = (0~~2~~0~~1~~0) .  Geometric interpretation  100x100px The set of all feasible solutions is an intersection of hyperspaces. Therefore, it is a convex polyhedron. If it is bounded, then it is a convex polytope. Each BFS corresponds to a vertex of this polytope.  Application in the Simplex algorithm  The simplex algorithm keeps, at each point of its execution, a \\"current basis\\" B (a subset of m out of n variables), a \\"current BFS\\", and a \\"current tableau\\". The tableau is a representation of the linear program where the basic variables are expressed in terms of the non-basic ones: \\\\begin{align} x_B &= p + Q x_N \\\\\\\\\\\\ z &= z_0 + r^T x_N \\\\end{align}where x_Bis the vector of m basic variables, x_Nis the vector of n non-basic variables, and z is the maximization objective. Since non-basic variables equal 0, the current BFS is p, and the current maximization objective is z_0. If all coefficients in rare negative, then z_0is an optimal solution, since all variables (including all non-basic variables) must be at least 0, so the second line implies z\\\\leq z_0. If some coefficients in rare positive, then it may be possible to increase the maximization target. For example, if x_5is non-basic and its coefficient in ris positive, then increasing it above 0 may make zlarger. If it is possible to do so without violating other constraints, then the increased variable becomes basic (it \\"enters the base\\"), while another non-basic variable is decreased to 0 to keep the equality constraints and thus becomes non-basic (it \\"exits the base\\"). If this process is done carefully, then it is possible to guarantee that z increases until it reaches the optimal BFS.

The Vietnamese throne was usurped by M·∫°c ƒêƒÉng Dung in 1527. L√™ Ninh, a prince of the Later L√™ dynasty, escaped to Lan Xang. In 1533, L√™ Ninh proclaimed himself emperor with the support of Nguy·ªÖn Kim and Tr·ªãnh Ki·ªÉm. The civil war between the two dynasties thus ensued. In 1592, Thang Long, the capital of the M·∫°c dynasty, was reconquered by the Later L√™ forces, marking the end of the Southern and Northern Dynasties period. M·∫°c rulers fled to Cao B·∫±ng Province with the direct support of the Chinese Ming and Qing dynasties until 1677. Background Since 1428, Vietnam was united under the rule of the house of L√™ (Later L√™ dynasty) after the founder L√™ L·ª£i, also the leader of Lam S∆°n uprising, who drove out the Ming Chinese invaders. Soon after, the monarch adopted Neo-Confucianism and state-centralization as nation's idea. The fifth monarch, Emperor L√™ Th√°nh T√¥ng (L√™ H·∫°o) had created the solid National Code based on Neo-Confucian beliefs, help flourishing businesses and trades, and successful expanded Vietnamese's territories into the Mekong delta and Xiangkhoang Plateau (formerly known as Tr·∫•n Ninh plateau). After Th√°nh T√¥ng's death in 1497, Vietnam fell into swift decline. In 1515, Tr·∫ßn C·∫£o launched rebellion against the court. In 1517, a massive typhoon struck Th√°i B√¨nh and H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng provinces, killed 21,000 peasants. Agriculture and business began collapsing. Widespread angry peasants and workers demonstrated through in these provinces. 6 succeed monarchs after L√™ Th√°nh T√¥ng had lost control on the government and the army, caused the rise of military rulers and corruption. In 1522, a military general name M·∫°c ƒêƒÉng Dung during his power struggle against the dominant Tr·ªãnh clan and Nguy·ªÖn clan, had gained the regent of the government by installing Prince Xuan as new Emperor. In 18 June 1527, M·∫°c ƒêƒÉng Dung executed L√™ Cung Ho√†ng and established the new M·∫°c dynasty. The deposed L√™ royal family went exile in Lan Xang. In 1533, a L√™ loyalist general Nguy·ªÖn Kim brought prince L√™ Duy Ninh from Tr·∫•n Ninh as the emperor Nguy√™n H√≤a, seek to overthrow M·∫°c ƒêƒÉng Dung, and reestablished the L√™ monarch in Xiangkhoang Plateau. With the help of Vietnamese migrants in Xiangkhouang, the L√™ army regained Thanh H√≥a and Ngh·ªá An provinces, set T√¢y Kinh in Thanh H√≥a as temporary capital and base for return the L√™ monarch, and started the period Southern and Northern dynasties (Nam B·∫Øc Tri·ªÅu) in Vietnam, which lasted to 1592. M·∫°c ƒêƒÉng Dung [bowing in center] surrenders to Ming China army in L·∫°ng S∆°n, 1541. In 1537, Nguy√™n H√≤a sent delegations to Ming China, sought to Chinese military supports for his reclaim the reign in Vietnam. Jiajing Emperor of Ming dynasty responded by sent 125,000 soldiers to the border, threatening the M·∫°c regime in Hanoi. In the final word, M·∫°c ƒêƒÉng Dung surrendered to Ming dynasty in Friendship Pass in 1541 as he accepted his regime and monarch would be under Chinese protection and ceded half of Qu·∫£ng Ninh province to China (now is Fangcheng, Guangxi).http://www.eacrh.net/ojs/index.php/crossroads/article/view/43/Vol8_Yamazaki_html While being under political protection of Ming China, the M·∫°c dynasty rebuilt agricultural economy, opened business and factories, rebuilt a strong-120,000 soldiers army.

M·∫°c M·∫≠u H·ª£p sent all his troops to resist the Southern army, but was defeated. In 14 November 1592, L√™-Tr·ªãnh army captured three western province L√†o Cai, Y√™n B√°i and Ph√∫ Th·ªç. In 25 November, Tr·ªãnh T√πng's forces arrived H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng, arrested and executed M·∫°c M·∫≠u H·ª£p and his son M·∫°c To√†n. The M·∫°c remnants fled to mountainous B·∫Øc C·∫°n, Cao B·∫±ng provinces, and still in active. In April 1593, the southern emperor L√™ Th·∫ø T√¥ng was welcomed back to ƒê√¥ng Kinh (Hanoi).  Aftermath  Chu ƒê·∫≠u's blue and white ceramic dish, 15th-16th century The L√™ monarch, after 59 years war with rival M·∫°c, returned back to the throne of ƒê·∫°i Vi·ªát. However, the Ming dynasty of China still only recognized the M·∫°c regime in Cao B·∫±ng as rightfully ruler of Dai Viet. In 1597 L√™ Th·∫ø T√¥ng sent emissary Ph√πng Kh·∫Øc Khoan to Beijing for renewing relation with China, who supports the M·∫°c dynasty. At the result, the Ming China recognized both L√™ and M·∫°c were legitimacy rulers of Vietnam, and in 1644 they officially re-recognized the L√™ monarch as \\"king of sovereign Vietnam\\". The remnant M·∫°c monarch in Cao B·∫±ng province, recruited Tai-speaking mountain tribes into their army. They also brought the Vietnamese N√¥m script adoption to T√†y people, called the N√¥m T√†y script.B·∫£o t·ªìn ch·ªØ N√¥m c·ªßa d√¢n t·ªôc T√†y t·ªânh B·∫Øc K·∫°n M·∫°c regime and the V≈© VƒÉn clan's \\"ch√∫a B·∫ßu\\" in H√† Giang province, still were threatens of the L√™-Tr·ªãnh regime until they were annexed and went exiled to China in 1677. The Tr·ªãnh military lords who regents the L√™ Dynasty, who's capital in ƒê√¥ng Kinh (Tonkin or Hanoi), soon find disloyal of the Nguy·ªÖn governor in central and southern Vietnam. Over next 30 years of unification and the temporary peace, Vietnam one again would be divided by two military lords for another 150 years‚Äìfought against each other in the indecisive Tr·ªãnh‚ÄìNguy·ªÖn War. These long civil wars had devastated the Vietnamese nation both its structure and economy, causing the great dissatisfaction among the ordinary class and working class to the monarchs and the aristocrats, which ultimate lead to the final boom - the T√¢y S∆°n rebellion in late 18th century. The Chu ƒê·∫≠u ceramic factory in Chu ƒê·∫≠u village, H·∫£i D∆∞∆°ng province who famously exporting Vietnamese blue-white ceramics to Japan and West Asia from 13th to 17th century was destroyed.

It was discovered on 22 May 2009 in a field near Escrick, North Yorkshire by a metal detectorist and reported via the Portable Antiquities Scheme. Following a successful funding campaign, the hoard was acquired by the Yorkshire Museum for ¬£35,000. Description The Escrick ring is a gold finger ring set with a large blue gemstone and red glass cloisonn√©, measuring 23.1 mm in diameter across the bezel and 25.5 mm across the hoop. It weighs 10.2 g. The central cabochon gem is surrounded by four triangular cells. Where these meet, small round cells have been set. Glass slips are still present in one of the triangular cells and four of the interstitial spaces. The square frame of the bezel is set onto an eight-lobed base. The lobes are alternately embellished by gold granules and by beaded wire enclosing further gold granules. Where this platform meets the round-sectioned hoop, three further gold granules are set. The underside of the lobed platform is plain. Analyis of the metal using X-ray fluorescence indicated a gold content of approximately 90%, a silver content of 8%, and a copper content of 2%. The gemstone was identified as a sapphire using Raman spectroscopy. Significance In January 2013 experts from UK universities gathered in York at a conference organised by the University and the Yorkshire Museum to discuss the nature and significance of the ring. The ring was subsequently argued to date from the 5th or 6th century ‚Äì not the 10th or 11th as originally believed. Its origin was attributed to Europe, possibly France, and it was thought to have belonged to a king, leader or royal consort ‚Äì not a bishop, which was also a previous theory. Public display The ring was acquired by the Yorkshire Museum in 2011 for ¬£35,000 and subsequently placed on public display. The money was raised with grants of ¬£10,000 from the Art Fund,, ¬£10,000 from the MLA/V&A; Purchase Grant Fund, ¬£10,000 from the Headley Trust and ¬£1,000 from the York Philosophical Society.

It traverses Downtown Seattle, including Pioneer Square and Belltown, as well as the adjacent neighborhoods of SoDo and Lower Queen Anne. Numerous landmarks including parks, museums, and historic buildings are located along the street, including Pike Place Market. The Great Seattle Fire of 1889 destroyed much of it and it had to be rebuilt. Parades have taken place on it before and after the fire. History 1st Avenue is called \\"Seattle's oldest thoroughfare\\". Seattle's original street system was a misaligned grid created by three of the original settlers. Today's 1st Avenue was Front Street north of Yesler in Arthur A. Denny's plat, and Commercial Street to its south in Doc Maynard's. The grid persists in the 21st century and 1st Avenue makes two 20-degree bends where it enters and exits the Downtown Seattle core, or Denny's plat. =Great Seattle Fire and Underground Seattle= View of 1st Avenue from Columbia Street after Seattle fire of June 6, 1889 1st Avenue South in Pioneer Square is built over and adjacent to \\"areaways\\" comprising Underground Seattle, dating to rebuilding following the Great Seattle Fire of 1889. The fire began where the Federal Office Building (Seattle) now stands. Street level was lifted one story in most of Pioneer Square. =Rebuilding= Parade on 1st Avenue in the early 1900s 1st Avenue circa 1942 After the Great Fire, present-day Pioneer Square was rebuilt with fireproof materials including stone and brick, often with iron structural members. Historic buildings from this period on 1st Avenue that remained in the late 20th century include: * Pioneer Square pergola (1909) * Pioneer Building (1889‚Äì90) * Mutual Life Building (1892) on the site of Seattle's first community building, Yesler's cookhouse * Yesler Building (1890‚Äì95) * Schwabacher Building (1890) * Terry-Denny Building (1889‚Äì90) * Maynard Building (1892) * Lippy Building (1900) * The City Club (1906) * State Hotel (1890) * Grand Central Building (1889) * Globe Hotel (1890) * Bread of Life MIssion (1889) * Maud Building (1889) * Squire Building (1900) * Smith Building (1900) * Seattle Quilt Building (1904) * Pacific Marine Building (1905) * Wax & Raine Building (1904) * Seller Building (1906) * Hambach Building (1907) * Seattle Hardware (1904) * Flatiron Building (aka Triangle Hotel and BarSeattle: A National Register of Historic Places Travel Itinerary, National Park Service) (1908‚Äì10) Just north of Pioneer Square is the 1889 Colman Building. =Pike Place Market= Pike Place Market (opened 1907), \\"one of Seattle's most famous cultural and commercial institutions\\", faces 1st Avenue on its east side, between Pike Street and Virginia Street.

It is designated as one of three or four north-south \\"major truck streets\\" in the district. Starbucks Center, built in 1912 and headquarters of Starbucks since 1997, is on 1st Avenue South in SoDo. After it briefly joins State Route 99 then crossing the Duwamish River via the First Avenue South Bridge, the route becomes State Route 509 leading roughly to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. =Downtown towers= Old and new Federal Buildings on 1st Avenue Although the tallest Downtown towers are a few streets to the east in the Metropolitan Tract and elsewhere, 1st Avenue has some notable skyscrapers including the 37-story Henry M.

The exhibition was on display at Roca Gallery in London from June 1 to August 31, 2019 . Catherine Slessor for ‚ÄúThe Guardian‚Äù wrote: ‚ÄúWith a penchant for layering styles and materials from different eras, the Catalan duo practise a kind of architectural bricolage ‚Äì the notion might seem cliched, but has its origins in the French bricoler, ‚Äúto tinker‚Äù. Choreographing a chimerical new spectacle through scavenging and reworking, Flores & Prats are superbly seductive bricoleurs.‚Äù *Double exhibition in Copenhagen in 2013: Meeting at the Building at Kunstakademiets Arkitektskole and Ingredients & Cakes at the Leth & Gori gallery. The exhibition at Leth & Gori saw the collaboration of Flores & Prats with British artist Soraya Smithson, who designed the window-shop and the Biscuit- Copenhagen Map that forms the cover of the catalogue.

It was built between 1830 and 1832 by convict road gangs, having been surveyed by Heneage Finch (1830‚Äì1831) and thereafter by L. V. Dulhunty. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 June 2009.  History  Much of the section of the Great North Road north of Mt Manning was constructed under the supervision of Heneage Finch who had been the Assistant Surveyor responsible for the selection of the original line of road in 1825. in 1830, Finch replaced lt Percy Simpson as supervisor of the area north of Mt Manning up to the Hunter Valley. After a dispute, Finch was abruptly dismissed in 1831. Finch's successors were L. V. Dulhunty (1831‚Äì1834) and Peter Ogilvie (1835‚Äì1836). Finch had aimed to complete a road equal in excellence of construction to the existing section between Wisemans Ferry and Mt Manning. Similar construction techniques were used, including cut and fill methods that resulted in extensive blasting and quarrying combined with the use of massive embankments and retaining walls as well as culverts and bridges over the numerous small creeks between Mt Manning and Wollombi. =Major items= Quarry site & ramp on St Albans road The ramp structure or embanked causeway that now forms part of the St Albans Road was probably completed by the No. 9 Iron Gang, under Percy Simpson's supervision, between May and December, 1830, as the gang is recorded as being \\"stationed near Mt Manning\\" during this period. The style and workmanship of the ramp are also similar to that of other structures completed by the same gang, such as the retaining walls south of Wisemans Ferry and on the ascent of Mt Baxter. Stone culverts and bridge (abandoned section at Bucketty) The great North Road in the vicinity of Mt McQuoid was constructed during 1830 and 1831 by No. 29 Road Party who also probably built former bridgeBridge 7 here during this period. Ramsays Leap - retaining wall and flume near Mt Simpson Several gangs were employed during 1830‚Äì32 at Mt Simpson building the extensive descent to the valley floor. These included the No. 27 Road Party,April‚ÄìDecember, 1830 No. 29 Road PartyMarch‚ÄìApril, 1830 and No. 42 Road Party.January, 1831 ‚Äì September, 1832 The latter party probably built the massive curved retaining wall with its buttressing flume at Ramsays Leap. It is likely that the remainder of the descent, winding precariously along the steep contours of the mountainside, was originally supported by a continuous retaining wall of equal standard, but of which, as a result of road widening, only a fragment near the base remains. Stone causeway A section of earlier road, about 150m in length situated east of the modern day road alignment just north of the base of Mt. Simpson. Stone culvert at Fernances Crossing and stone arched culvert & retaining wall at Murrays Run The area near Mt Finch, also known as \\"Murray's valley\\" or the \\"back of Murray's Farm\\", posed a major obstacle to road construction as a swamp, several creeks and steep climbs required much arduous labour. Heneage Finch stationed No. 27 Road Party there not long after his arrival and it remained there during 1830 and 1831. No. 29 Road Party and No. 7 Iron Gang also spent short periods there. These two large stone culverts survive in this area. Thompsons Bridge The bridge now known as Thompsons bridge has a recent deck atop coursed rubble abutments and wing walls. It is difficult to ascertain whether it was part of the original construction of the road. If so, it may have been built by No.7 Iron Gang between July and September, 1830, although, unlike the stream, it does not appear on White's 1831 map. The stonework contrasts in size, dressing and quality with other structures in the area, suggesting that it may be a later construction. It is possible that later additions were built on the site of a pre-existing bridge, perhaps using the stones from the earlier structure. [Another interpretation suggests it may have been a culvert (like those at Murrays Run and Fernances Crossing) that collapsed at some stage and was replaced with a bridge that decreased the bend. At this stage part of the wall was rebuilt on a different alignment. There is a distinct bend in the stonework that changes quality at the bend, that closest to the bridge being of lesser quality. At the edge of the bitumen leading to where a culvert would have been can be seen original knapped stone paving]. Abandoned loops at Laguna Shop and Milsons Arm The road through the valley here was mainly constructed by No. 7 Iron Gang and No. 42 Road Party during 1830, and completed in 1832 by Nos. 27 and 42 Road Parties.  Description  This section of the Great North Road begins at its junction with the road from St Albans.MR 181 The northern limit of this listing is the southern abutment of Cleghorns Bridge over Wollombi Brook. The road surface is unsealed for 5 km. After its intersection with George Downes Drive at the Bucketty junction, the road is sealed. This 30 km section of the road retains several individually valuable and unique structures. It passes and links surviving historic and archaeological sites and early depots, rural homesteads and land grants. Several structures have been isolated by road realignments. This has assisted their potential long term preservation. Community groups have carried out repairs to some structures. The Convict Trail project has placed interpretive signs and plaques at several locations. = Major items = Descent of Mt Manning The descent was a major work where the hillside was cut down to form part of the road surface, the remainder being constructed on fill behind retaining walls. These walls are now mostly hidden under overfill, but the cuttings and side drains and one large culvert still exist. At the top is a small quarry site and most of the rock cutting along the road side is pick dressed. Quarry site & ramp on St Albans Road The ramp or embanked causeway on the St Albans Road is formed by two battered (sloped) masonry retaining walls which support each side of the roadway where it traverses a deep hollow. The retaining walls for the ramp are approximately 9 metres apart and reach a maximum height of 3.5 to 4 metres at the centre. The walls are constructed of fairly regular, squared stone blocks. The masonry is dry-laid with a well prepared bed (horizontal) joints, a plain worked face and roughly prepared perpends (vertical joints). Course heights are generally in the vicinity of 250 to 300 mm with stone lengths generally in the range of 250 to 400 mm. ; the top course ranged from 75mm to 300m. The southeast wall extends approximately 65 m. The wall increases in height until it reaches its maximum of 12 courses in the centre. The northwest wall is approximately 44 m long with a maximum height of 14 courses. There is a quarry site on the hill southwest of the ramp structure. Road from St Albans Road Ramp to Bucketty Much of this road still lies on the original road surface with original cuttings and drains (damaged by modern road maintenance) Under the current road surface is the original surface cut into the bedrock in parts filled with knapped stone. Stone culverts and bridge (abandoned section at Bucketty) The abandoned loop at Mt. McQuoid/Bucketty comprises a section about 400 metres long which was cut off by the reconstruction of the nearby intersection immediately east of the earlier alignment. This short section includes a diverse range of features which illustrate the nature of the road construction utilised on the Great North Road. At the southern end is a stone culvert flanked by the remains of wing walls. The culvert was reconstructed in 2003. Immediately north of the culvert is a macadam type pavement of compacted broken stone about 7m wide. About 75m north of the wing-wall culvert is an extensive ashlar masonry retaining wall. The wall curves to cross a gully where a former bridge was located. The span of the bridge has now been infilled with a large diameter concrete pipe surrounded by cement mortared stone blocks probably deriving from nearby structures such as the wing-walled culvert. North of the former bridge the road alignment rises up to a rock cutting with the road pavement cut into the bedrock, and an associated rock- cut side drain. This then changes to a macadam type pavement. There is also a well preserved sandstone masonry box-culvert within this northern pavement/road section of the Mt. McQuoid precinct. From Bucketty Private Road number 3 to the ascent of Mt Simpson Here the current road lies on the same line as the original road, in part cut below the original road leaving evidence of the original road and drain in the side cutting. In other parts the bitumen had been laid on the original road surface and evidence of the original road can be seen in the cuttings; the drains and at the edges of bitumen. Ramsays Leap - retaining wall and flume near Mt Simpson The Ramsays Leap curved retaining wall is a major structure built into a steep gully which slopes away to the west. The wall is curved and battered (sloped) and is about 100 metres long and up to 4.5 metres high. The batter is 1 horizontal to 4 vertical. The masonry is ashlar work, dry laid, and generally in sound condition with well prepared stones and tight joints. The coursing is consistently level. A square culvert is set in the centre of the curve, three courses below the top of the wall and running perpendicular to the road. The inlet has a drop entry with an inclined, rounded race. At the outlet a shaped slab sill projects from the wall throwing water about 3m down onto a short horizontal race and thence to a final spillway approximately 3.5m from the toe of the wall. The spillway is about 4m high and has a batter of 1:4. On the uphill side, there is a continuous cutting beside the road with jumper marks, carved initials, bench marks, and other historic features. Part of the earlier work has been removed by subsequent widening activities. There is also a small \\"well\\" or drinking trough about 30 cm wide and 20 cm deep. This may be a \\"convict drinking well\\" (as reputed) or may relate to a later period in the use of the road. The road remains in use here with a sealed bitumen/aggregate pavement. Stone causeway A section of earlier road, about 150m in length situated east of the modern day road alignment just north of the base of Mt. Simpson. About 75m of the earlier alignment is paved with a hand- knapped, closely packed stones forming a pavement surface. Stones are of various shapes and sizes, the largest about 20 cm across. In the central part of the paved section, the stones are broken up into smaller pieces, possibly caused by weathering and erosion from water flow in peak periods. At the southern end, where there is also a side cutting, the hand-placed pavement is substantially intact. The road is built up above the surrounding flat to a height of approximately 60 cm and the formation is approximately 3m wide. Stone culvert at Fernances Crossing A curved stone retaining wall with a central rectangular culvert was constructed to carry the road formation across a small east facing gully. The retaining wall to the embankment is 3m high at the highest point. It is battered at a slope of 1:7. The stone blocks are laid random with broken courses, some snecking and an uneven arrangement of perpends. The stones have rough, uneven margins. Course heights range from 20 to 75 cm with blocks up to 100 cm in length and 80 cm in depth. The lintel at the outlet is carved into a semi-circle, which extends for only half the depth of an otherwise typical rectangular slab lintel. This detailing is decorative, not functional. The inlet end of the culvert has been modified by placement of a modern concrete drop-inlet/gully pit. Apart from the wall and culvert, the Fernances Crossing precinct includes some other interesting elements. These include evidence of older quarrying in the rock cutting south of the wall and also near the modern gully pit inlet as well as some sections of older crushed sandstone road pavement visible in the area above the wall. Stone arched culvert & retaining wall at Murrays Run A curved stone retaining wall with a central culvert was constructed to carry the road formation across a small east facing gully. The retaining wall to the embankment is 10 courses/4m high at the highest point. The stone blocks are laid random with irregular, uneven courses, and some snecking. The culvert is rectangular in cross-section with sides 2 courses high and cover slabs spanning the full width of the internal channel. At the outlet an arch of shaped voussoir stones supports the retaining wall above. This detailing is extremely elaborate and decorative, no other examples are known. The inlet end of the culvert has been modified by placement of a modern concrete drop- inlet/gully pit. Thompsons Bridge (stone, still in use) This timber bridge incorporates stone abutments of rough rubble walling on the downhill side. The two-span timber trestle structure between the abutments is recent. It has recent round longitudinal stringers and planked decking. The stone walls on each side are coursed rubble work uncharacteristic of the other work in this area but similar to more modest work south of Mt. Manning. Coursing is uneven and unlevel. A batter is achieved recessing each course back by approximately 5 cm. The northern abutment curves with the alignment of the road around the corner. Abandoned loop at Laguna shop An unsealed section of earlier road, about 250m in length situated west of the modern day sealed road alignment. Few construction features are evident. The older alignment appears to pass below a recently erected community \\"hall\\" structure then re-emerges passing in front of the general store/wine bar, before rejoining the current road-line. Abandoned loop near Milsons Arm Road An unsealed section of earlier road, about 250m in length situated east and west of the present sealed road alignment in the area north and south of the Milsons Arm Road intersection. Construction features evident in the southernmost loop, include small areas of side cutting and remnant timber guard posts, which indicate the older road formation was at a lower level beside the Wollombi Brook. The northern loop (west of the current road) provides access to the \\"Potter's Gallery\\" property, where there is evidence of old quarrying on a large sandstone outcrop beside the older road formation. = Condition = As at 28 December 2007, the majority of this section of the Great North Road is intact with instances of localised distortion due to tree growth and erosion. At the St Albans Ramp there has been some theft of sandstone blocks.  Heritage listing  The Great North Road is an item of national heritage significance. It meets all State Heritage Register criteria and does so at a number of levels. Historically, the Great North Road is of state significance as the first made road north of the Hawkesbury. It was constructed by convict gangs between 1826 and 1836. The road has historic associations with several notable colonial figures including Governor Darling and Surveyor-General Thomas Mitchell. The Great North Road is also evidence of the development of the colony at Sydney and of the policies during this period of using convict gangs to construct major public works. The Great North Road constitutes a material record of convict labour. Many surviving structures and precincts bespeak the quality of work achieved by convict artisans. Some precincts of the road remain in relatively unspoilt areas, evocative of the frontier environment of the 1830s. Other sections remain in use as a transport corridor and have thus carried European traffic continuously since the 1830s. The section of the Great north Road between Mount Manning and Wollombi contains a variety of features that provide tangible physical evidence of convict road engineering and construction. The section also contains a number of individually significant structures, including unique examples of culvert and flume construction as well as cuttings, side drains and pavements. Parts of this section of the road remain in use. It presents excellent interpretive opportunities. Great North Road, between Mount Manning and Wollombi was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 June 2009 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Historically, the Great North Road is of state significance as the first made road north of the Hawkesbury. It was constructed by convict gangs between 1826 and 1836. The Old Great North Road is also evidence of the development of the colony at Sydney and of the policies during this period of using convict gangs to construct major public works. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The road has historic associations with several notable colonial figures including Governor Darling and Surveyor-General Thomas Mitchell. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.

The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Great North Road constitutes a material record of convict labour. The road generally and its individual items in particular are held in high esteem by members of the communities through which it passes. Additionally, a community group, the Convict Trail Project, has been instrumental in researching, promoting, conserving, interpreting and monitoring the condition of the road, its items and its associated workings. The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Further study of the Great North Road and its associated workings has the potential to reveal further information about the structure itself and about the lives and circumstances of the convicts builders, their supervisors and the explorers and surveyors of the period. The section of road between Mt Manning and Wollombi, because of its numerous individual items is likely to be particularly rich in evidence of this kind. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The Great North Road, as a whole, represents a unique engineering achievement, including, for example the oldest known stone bridges on the Australian mainland. The section between Mt Manning and Wollombi comprises many individual elements with unique properties of design and workmanship. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales.

It was built from 1817 to 1820 by James Blackman. It is also known as Bowman's Cottage. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  =Indigenous occupation= The lower Hawkesbury was home to the Dharug people. The proximity to the Nepean River and South Creek qualifies it as a key area for food resources for indigenous groups. The Dharug and Darkinjung people called the river Deerubbin and it was a vital source of food and transport. =Non-indigenous occupation= Governor Arthur Phillip explored the local area in search of suitable agricultural land in 1789 and discovered and named the Hawkesbury River after Baron Hawkesbury. This region played a significant role in the early development of the colony with European settlers established here by 1794. Situated on fertile floodplains and well known for its abundant agriculture, Green Hills (as it was originally called) supported the colony through desperate times. However, frequent flooding meant that the farmers along the riverbanks were often ruined. On 1 January 1810, Governor Lachlan Macquarie replaced Governor Bligh as Governor of New South Wales. Under Macquarie's influence the colony prospered. His vision was for a free community for white colonists, working in conjunction with the penal colony. He implemented an unrivalled public works program, completing 265 public buildings, establishing new public amenities and improving existing services such as roads. Under his leadership Hawkesbury district thrived. He visited the district on his first tour and recorded in his journal on 6 December 1810: \\"After dinner I chrestened the new townships...I gave the name of Windsor to the town intended to be erected in the district of the Green Hills...the township in the Richmond district I have named Richmond...\\" the district reminded Macquarie of those towns in England, whilst Castlereagh, Pitt Town and Wilberforce were named after English statesmen. These are often referred to as Macquarie's Five Towns. Their localities, chiefly Windsor and Richmond, became more permanent with streets, town square and public buildings. Construction of Bowman Cottage was commenced in 1817 by James Blackman, the local constable and later gravedigger and sexton. Blackman erected the frame of a brick nog cottage during what turned out to be for him an all too brief period of prosperity. He was subsequently dismissed as constable and as a consequence found himself in financial difficulty which resulted in the forced sale of his property to George Bowman. Bowman completed the cottage by 1820 and by 1824 it had attained its present appearance. At the time the cottage was built Richmond was still a rustic town made up of clusters of buildings separated by paddocks and dense patches of bush. The bulk of the houses were built to timber and Bowman Cottage was one the few substantial buildings. It was built close to Windsor Street on the edge of two acres of garden and vegetable beds. A brick stable block stood at right angles to the rear of the house and parallel to this was a timber barn with a cobbled courtyard between. Both buildings have long disappeared except for a small section of the stables which still stands. The cottage remained in the ownership of the Bowman family until the 1920s when George's twin sons Andrew and Edward began to subdivide the land. By 1930 the cottage was sold and subsequently divided into two semi-detached houses. It remained this way until it was purchased by the state Department of Environment and Planning.Mason, 1988 The cottage was originally earmarked for demolition in order to make way for a housing development. It was saved when it was purchased by the Department of Environment and Planning in 1974, and restored to the tune of $300,000 over time. Conservation of the building was commenced in 1982 and was carried out under the supervision of the Historic Buildings Group of the Department of Public Works. Bowman Cottage in Richmond has a twin located 23 kilometres from Dunedoo in Warrumbungle Shire: the Merotherie Homestead, which George Bowman acquired and extended throughout the nineteenth century in the same style as his house in Richmond. Like his Richmond House, the core of Meruthera Homestead was built by an earlier occupant of the land, in this case, according to family legend, a shepherd who built a small house there in ironwood in the 1820s. George owned the property until his death in 1874 and in 2011 the house and some of the property it remained in the ownership of the Bowman family.  Description  With its steeply pitched roof, dormer windows and surrounding stone flagged verandah the cottage typifies the early Australian farmhouse. Its detailing and fitments are colonial Georgian while the walls are brick nogged, a building technique once common in the Hawkesbury district, but now rare. Brick nog houses were built of brick set in a timber frame which was covered externally with weather boards. Bowman Cottage is a colonial house of considerable character, though it has been altered superficially in some ways. (The stone flagged verandah has been spoilt by the erection of a partition and by the addition of clumsy bases to the verandah posts. The projecting rooms at each end of the verandah have been cement rendered.) The overhanging slate roof has three gable windows lighting the attic rooms. In the main section of the house the walls are of brick, set in timber uprights and overlaid with wooden planks, a method of building sometimes used by the early settlers. The weatherboard covering protected the soft sandstock bricks from deterioration. There are few buildings of a similar age which have retained a comparable degree of originality and although Richmond has changed dramatically since the 1820s Bowman Cottage has not.  Heritage listing  Bowman House is one of the earliest surviving houses in the state. Construction was commenced before 1818 by James Blackman and the house was acquired by George Bowman in 1818. He extended the brick-nog structure and completed it in 4 stages. The cottage was his home until his death in 1878.Temple, Minute Paper, 1986 Bowman House was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. Bowman Cottage is one of the earliest surviving buildings in the state. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The cottage was built by James Blackman, a free settler, businessman, gravedigger and sexton. It was then acquired by George Bowman in 1818. Bowman came to the colony as a child of three with his parents. He went on to become the first Mayor of Richmond and lived in the cottage until his death in 1878.Kingston, 1990 In addition to being the first Mayor of Richmond, George Bowman was a Member of the New South Wales Legislative Council, a magistrate, explorer, pastoralist, land speculator, and Elder of the Presbyterian Church. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. With its steeply pitched roof, dormer windows and surrounding stone flagged verandah the cottage typifies the early Australian farmhouse. Its detailing and fitments are colonial Georgian while the walls are brick nogged, a building technique once common in Hawkesbury but now rare. The place has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Bowman family has a long history of distinction and influence in the Hawkesbury region. They are very significant in the history of the growth and development of both Richmond and the Hawkesbury region. Bowman Cottage is one of the oldest surviving homes in New South Wales and has been in the ownership of the Bowman family until its subdivision and sale in 1930. It was also the preferred and chosen residence of George Bowman, the first Mayor of Richmond, who lived in the cottage until his death in 1878, despite having the means to move to more luxurious lodgings. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. At the time it was built, Bowman Cottage was one of very few substantial buildings in the Richmond area. Richmond, at the time, was still a very rustic town and made up of clusters of buildings separated by paddocks and dense patches of bush. The bulk of the houses in the area were simply built of timber. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The colonial Georgian style of Bowman Cottage is representative of the typical Australian Farmhouse of its time.

It is a glycoprotein with two subunits A and B. A subunit is linked to B subunit with disulfide bridges and non-covalent bonds. B subunit is responsible for binding to the galactosyl-terminated receptors on the cell membrane that allows the entry the A subunit of the toxin into the cell, which performs the inhibitory function. Volkensin is a galactose specific lectin that can inhibit protein synthesis in whole cells and in cell-free lysates. This protein can be included into the category of risin like toxins and it resembles modeccin, the toxin of Adenia digitata. Although very similar in composition, volkensin contains more cysteine residues and more than twice as much sugar than modeccin, due to high content of galactose and mannose. In addition, volkensin is able to inhibit protein synthesis at concentrations 10 times lower than required for modeccin. From gene sequencing analysis, volkensin was found to be coded by 1569-bp ORF, that is 523 amino acid residues without introns. The internal linker sequence is 45 bp. The active site of the A subunit contains Ser203, a novel residue that is conserved in all ribosome inactivating proteins. The toxin can be isolated via affinity chromatography, using acid-treated Sepharose 6B. Volkensin, and toxins alike are studied to understand protein entry into the cell and many have been found to have antitumor applicability. Rats that have been administered a high dose of volkensin died between 7 and 12 hours. For 1-2 hours after poisoning rats behaved normally and then became sedated until death with short-lasting seizures. Rats that have been administered lower doses died within several days and showed wax-like peritoneal fat, which indicated the formation of a pancreatic lesion. In addition, volkensin has been also found to agglutinate red blood cells without any specificity for a particular blood group. Volkensin is a potent neurotoxin that can kill neurons. It is able to bind to the axon terminal of neurons, where it is internalized and transported to the cell body and inactivates ribosomes, thereby killing the neuron. Experiments performed in vitro showed increased toxicity of volkensin to microglia and astrocytes.

It is an institution with more than half a century of existence, and its mission is to prepare candidates for entering Academia Militar das Agulhas Negras (AMAN), where combatant officers of the Brazilian Army are prepared. To enter the Preparatory School students must pass an examination that occurs every year, for male youngsters who are studying at the high school third year or have already accomplished that level. The course at the Preparatory School is compared to the first year at a regular higher education institution, added by the military subjects which are necessary to the future cadet of AMAN. Among other, military instruction is included in order to prepare the candidates to the subjects that are taught at AMAN and are very important to the military career, with emphasis on physical preparation by means of physical training. After accomplishing the course, students are admitted to AMAN or get the Reserve Certificate for the military service they have performed at the Preparatory School. From 2012 on, the School started to be the first level of the period of five years of the course for Brazilian Army Battle Commissioned Officers; the other four levels of the course are supposed to be performed by students at AMAN. History = Origins = One of the campus in Porto Alegre, in 1885. The preparatory teaching in the Brazilian Army began in 1939, with the transformation of Col√©gio Militar de Porto Alegre into \\"Escola de Forma√ß√£o de Cadetes\\", later named Escola Preparat√≥ria de Porto Alegre (EPPA). When EPPA turned to be not sufficient for the Army's needs, the Staff of the Brazilian Army created other Preparatory Schools to receive the number of volunteers that were interested in the military career. In 1940, the Escola Preparat√≥ria de Cadetes de S√£o Paulo (EPSP), started temporarily, in a building formerly used by the Hospital S√≠rio-Liban√™s, on Rua da Fonte, n¬∫ 91, in the Bela Vista area of the city of S√£o Paulo. In 1944, the facilities of Escola Preparat√≥ria de Cadetes do Ex√©rcito (EsPCEx) were built at the former Chapad√£o Farm area, in Campinas, according to a design in a Spanish style, made by the famous architect Hernani do Val Penteado. In 1942, Escola Preparat√≥ria de Fortaleza (EPF) was also founded. In 1946, among the students, SRL (Sociedade Recreativa e Liter√°ria) was created, representing all the alumni and their interests in their school life. In that year the first promenade happened in the majestic Teatro Municipal de S√£o Paulo. EPSP was active for 18 years, until 1958. In 1959 the EPSP was moved to Campinas, and was then called Escola Preparat√≥ria de Campinas (EPC). The three Preparatory Schools lasted along the 1940s and 1950s in very intense work. In 1961 they were abolished, leaving only EPC. The students from Fortaleza and Porto Alegre were transferred to Campinas. In 1962, the admission test was abolished and would be used again in 1963, on December 31. The Campinas society, led by the EPC Commander, was mobilized to avoid the EPC extinction. On November 17, 1963, the request was finally accepted. So the honorable school continued its mission of preparing those who were to be Cadets of Caxias. =Transfer to Campinas = A ceremony inside the EsPCEx compound. The transfer of the School to Campinas starts at the beginning of the 1940s, with the managements of the federal intervenor Fernando Costa, who ruled S√£o Paulo state. In order to Campinas be the seat of a Preparatory School Cadets, the cost of its installation were paid by the state government. The initial donation of the land was made by the Decree-Law 13,906, of March 20, 1944, only waiting for the end of the construction work to start existing as a school. Accepted the way of turning the idea possible, through an agreement between the Ministry of War and the state, the architect Val Hairstyle Hernani undertook the project and justified it this way: \\"This project is a set of four pavilions, around a huge arms square and, for ease of movement, counting on large galleries in the inner face. Why four pavilions? Because three of them were destinated to the students in preparation for each of the three armed forces (Navy, Army, Air Force) , and the last pavilion was done to the basic course which was attended by the freshmen. \\" After choosing the area in the region of Chapad√£o Farm, in the North of Campinas, the construction of the school began in 1944. The Government of S√£o Paulo State led the work until the covenant stage and then pass it to the Ministry of War, who would have to complete it. Because of its magnitude, and without resources to finish the construction, the work stopped for some years and the school was abandoned. The state, therefore, annulled the donation made in 1944. In 1958, the Army became interested in the project again. Contacts made by the then Commander of the Second Army with the State Government resulted in a message to the Legislative Assembly, dated April 29, 1958, transmitting the Law Project number 555, which authorized the State Treasury to sell, on giving to the Ministry of War, the property for the installation of the Preparatory School of Cadets in Campinas. The evaluator of the State, when assessing the Law Project said: \\"The building was built for military purposes, because its original destination was the installation of a preparatory school of cadets in Campinas. Its external appearance and its appearance as a whole, however, does not denounce a headquarters. It's beautiful and pleasing to look, with its colonial style facade. Its structure, too heavy, is what it shows for what purpose it was built. It was anticipated, of course, a inexpugnable fortress. The Finance Committee of the Legislative Assembly, to give its assent to the donation, wrote: \\"It is a measure of maximum interest to the Ministry of War and also to our state, in whose territory will be installed an educational establishment for the preparation of future Army officers. \\" The donation of the property occurred, solemnly, on August 25, 1958. Finally, in the following year, the school was transferred to Campinas. =Extinction= Solemnity of Entry into the Gates The difficulties were not restricted only to the construction. Decree Number 166 of November 17, 1961, turned the Preparatory Schools of Army Cadets of Porto Alegre and Fortaleza into lower-level Military Schools (Col√©gios Militares) and its Article 3 read: \\"The Preparatory School of Army Cadets in Campinas will be extinguished on December 31, 1963, and from the academic year 1962, it will no longer receive new students for the first year.\\" Public opinion from Campinas rose up against that measure and pressed the government for the permanence of the educational establishment in the city. The decision was revoked on November 26, 1963, when the deadline for its closure was almost expiring. =Reinauguration= The finishing works were restarted in 1967, and its name was changed from \\"Preparatory School of Campinas\\" to \\"Preparatory School of Army Cadets.\\" The changes involved their physical area, its facilities, its servers and its curriculum. For many years, from its arrival to Campinas to 1991, the School taught the 3 years of High School. Since then, the Army has been adopting the current (one year) model. . There are annually about 520 students from the various regions of Brazil who live in a boarding school system, where they receive, besides lessons and instructions, uniform, meals and per diem. Within the institution, students are divided into three companies (Eagle, Lion and Panther), and each of them has five platoons, totaling 15 platoons throughout the school. Ordinance 152 of the Army Chief of Staff, on 16 November 2010, implemented the new system of the Higher Education Course for Brazilian Army Battle Commissioned Officers. The course of Bachelor of Military Sciences changed to five years; the first year at EsPCEx and the remaining four at AMAN. At that time, many subjects that are not directly related to the military profession started to be taught in the school. Military education has also been enhanced, which allowed AMAN a greater availability of time to teach some subjects that are important to the new demands of the 21st-century combat officer. In the late summer of 2017, the school welcomed its first batch of women officer cadets. The School today =The mission of the School= Agulhas Negras Military Academy To Select and prepare the future cadet of the Agulhas Negras Military Academy (AMAN), initiating the formation of the Brazilian Army battle commissioned officer. =The Course= The school year includes the academic period, the school recess and the school holidays (between the graduating ceremony and the beginning of the course the following year). The beginning and the closing of the academic period are formalized by military ceremonies. EsPCEx is a boarding school where the students have to attend to all school activities which are considered to be service acts. Classes and all school activities have a duration of 50 minutes. The student must obtain a grade of 5.0 in all subjects in order to graduate at the end first year: *Calculus I *Physics *History *Military Instruction Shooting, Organization Preparation and Usage of the Army Ground Force *Military Physical Training I, II, III *Spanish I *English I *Portuguese I *Chemistry Applied to the Military Sciences *Information Technology and Communications There is also an exam that tests all the subjects studied through the year, and the student must be considered apt in terms of Military Discipline. The student receives at graduation the School Certificate including all the subjects studied and the Certificate of Reservist of the 2nd Category. If the student doesn't get the necessary grade to finish the course he may do the final exams a second time. If he does not pass one or more subjects, he will have to return a second year, and study that the subject at EsPCEx in the following year as well as Military Instruction, Spanish, and English. That second year, the student must pass. =Professional military teaching= Professional military teaching Military teaching at the school, is not aimed at educating combatants who belong to a constituted section. It is rather intended for creating a taste for the job and for discipline. The education of the basic military man is developed with solid knowledgement and practice, so that, at AMAN, he can be posted to combat sections and save time that would otherwise be spent on reviewing individual combat techniques. =Problem solving= Since 2012, the school has adopted the Teaching through Competences methodology, the first military school in Brazil to implement this methodology. In this method, knowledgement must be contextualized and integrate the syllabi of the different disciplines into problem-solving situations. With the use of this methodology, students have to reflect and solve problems in a systemic and integral way. =Health preparation and physical training (PT)= PT is aimed at the student's physical preparation and healthy conditions, to give a transition from the civilian (normally sedentary) life to a cadet's intense routine. The aim is not to form the combatant in physical terms in only one year at the School, but to form the basis for the student to be prepared at the Academy. Among the key activities are non-stop running, swimming and circuit training. Sports activities are planned to develop the taste for competition or leisure through sports, which will follow students through most of their professional lives. Competitive training at the School focuses mostly on building the basis for sports teams at AMAN.

He entered politics as a Republican in 1923, winning a seat on the 22-member Philadelphia City Council, one of several members representing the multi- member 8th district. He was reelected every four years until 1951. On the Council, Crossan became known as an independent-minded Republican, as did his protege, Austin Meehan. In 1947, he sponsored legislation to create a group charged with revising the city charter. The result of that study was the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter, which voters approved in a 1951 referendum and which remains in force today. The charter remodeled city council, eliminating multi-member districts. Crossan ran for the new 10th district seat, but lost to Democrat John F. Byrne Sr., and retired from politics.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013. It is now used by the Michigan State University College of Human Medicine. History The first edition of The Flint Journal was published by Charles Fellows on in 1876. The paper was sold twice over the next few years, eventually being bought by George McConnelly, who changed it from a weekly to a daily newspaper in 1883. The paper was sold twice again, and in 1902 Howard H. Fitzgerald purchased it and merged it with the Flint Globe, changing its name to the Fling Daily Journal. In 1911 Fitzgerald sold it to George Gough Booth, then president of the Detroit News and owner of many other Michigan newspapers. Flint grew enormously at the beginning of the twentieth century, providing an increasing number of subscribers for the Journal. The paper had offices on First Street, but by the 1920s was outgrowing that space. Booth hired Albert Kahn (who had recently designed the Detroit News Building as well as Booth's personal residence at Cranbrook) to design new offices for the Journal. The building was constructed and the paper moved into the offices in 1924. Kahn designed an addition in 1928, and other changes were made to the building in the 1930s. In 1952, Detroit architect William Kapp designed another, two-story addition to the building; a second addition was constructed in 1962. However, as the twentieth century rolled on, Flint's economy declined, and so did the paper. In 1976, the Booth Newspapers were sold to Samuel Irving Newhouse Jr., and by 2009, the newspaper reduced publishing to three days per week. In 2012, Booth Newspapers changed its name to Mlive Media Group, and the Flint Journal moved out of its historic headquarters, renting office space elsewhere in downtown Flint. At the same time, Michigan State University was looking to expand its medical education and public health programs in Flint. The old Flint Journal Building was purchased by Uptown Reinvestment in 2013, who rehabilitated the structure and leased it to MSU. Michigan State University opened their College of Human Medicine facilities in the building at the end of 2014. Description The Flint Journal Building is a 3-1/2-story Neoclassical style limestone clad building on a granite foundation, with 2-1/2-story tall International Style additions. The main building has an eight-bay-wide facade along First Street containing an off-center main entrance located in the third bay. The entrance is recessed, with the entry bay trimmed in dark green granite topped by a cornice. The remaining bays have broad segmental-arch-top window openings on the first floor level. In the second and third story level above, each of the eight bays contain three window openings separated by two-story Doric pilasters. Above the third-floor windows is a broad frieze. The side facade along Harrison Street has a three-by section with design similar to the front. Behind are the later additions. The 1952 addition is five bays wide with a strip of five large windows on the first floor and a wide tripartite window in each bay on the second floor. The 1965 addition is about half the length of the 1952 addition, but us windowless.

Life Charles Lienard, squire and sieur de L'Olive, was the son of Pierre Lienart and Fran√ßoise Bonnart of Chinon. The French adventurers Pierre Belain d'Esnambuc and Urbain Du Roissey reached Saint Christopher Island (Saint Kitts) in 1625, and were struck by the potential of the island as a colony once the indigenous Island Caribs were removed. They returned to France and in 1626 with the support of Cardinal Richelieu founded the \\"Association des Seigneurs de la Compagnie des Isles de l‚ÄôAm√©rique\\". The private venture had the mandate to settle Saint Christophe, Barbados and other neighboring islands at the entrance to Peru that were not possessed by any king or Christian prince. They engaged over 500 men to work on the islands for three years, sailed in three ships in February 1627, and after a difficult crossing landed in Saint-Christophe almost three months later. The first French settlers suffered from famine and fought with the Caribs and the English, who also had a settlement on the island. In November 1629 the Spanish admiral Fadrique de Toledo drove the French from the island. They left on two ships and attempted colonization of Antigua and Montserrat. They returned to Saint-Christophe in 1630. L'Olive was appointed lieutenant governor to Esnambuc on Saint Christophe in 1631. He sent his capable young assistant Guillaume d'Orange to visit the nearby islands of Guadeloupe, Dominica and Martinique and determine their potential as colonies. D'Orange thought Guadeloupe had the greatest promise. Spanish attempts to colonize the Guadeloupe archipelago in the first half of the 16th century had failed, and since then European sailors had only used it as a resting place. Guadeloupe expedition 1759 map. Fort St. Peter (Saint-Pierre) is shown on the northern point of 240px L'Olive and d'Orange sailed to France in late 1634. Their purpose was to obtain permission from the Compagnie des √Æsles d'Am√©rique to settle Guadeloupe. They met Jean du Plessis d'Ossonville in Dieppe, who agreed to join the project. Du Plessis was related to Cardinal Richelieu, which may have been a factor in his being invited as a partner. Duplessis also owned a sturdy ship. The partners went on to Paris to negotiate with the Company. They signed a treaty with the company in February 1635 in which they engaged to take 200 men to settle Dominica, Martinique or Guadeloupe. Under the contract the Company would provide arms, ammunition and the protection of the government. L'Olive and Du Plessis would have settled at least 800 men after ten years, not counting women and children. They would pay a petun (tobacco) fee, and at the end of the contract the settlements, forts and dwellings would all become property of the company. The contract, signed on 14 February 1635, commissioned l'Olive and Du Plessis to \\"command together on the island they would inhabit.\\" The two founders could not pay all the expenses, so brought in the merchants of Dieppe in exchange for a share of the profits over six years. The Dieppe shipowners Faucon and Delamare assisted the expedition. They had to supply them with 2,500 men. The partners remained subordinate to d'Esnambuc, whom King Louis XIII of France named governor general of the French Antilles on 7 March 1635. L'Olive married Marie Philibert in Chinon in 1635. His wife was a daughter of Jean Philibert, former advisor to the king at the royal seat of Chinon, and Marie Poulain. The settlers left Dieppe on 25 May 1635 with 554 people, including four Dominican missionaries. There were 40 Norman families of peasant origin, 30 prostitutes from the port of Dieppe or Paris, and 400 hired laborers (allou√©s). Those who paid for their voyage would be given concessions to grow tobacco or sugar in the island, which they would work using slaves from Africa and hired hands from France. The allou√©s could not pay for their trip, but were on contract to work for three years. They were nicknamed trente-six mois (36 months) after the term they had to serve. They would be treated, beaten and sold as slaves. However, some of them would later obtain concessions. Jean Fran√ßois du Buc, who would be Governor of Grenada from 1658 to 1660, was a leading member of the expedition, as was Constant d'Aubign√©, father of Fran√ßoise d'Aubign√©, Marquise de Maintenon. The expedition sailed in two ships. One, with 400 men, carried l‚ÄôOlive, Duplessis and two of the Dominicans, and the other carried 150 men and the other two Dominicans. They reached Martinique on 25 June 1635, which they claimed for the king, then moved on because they found the island mountainous, cut by precipices and gullies and infested with poisonous snakes. Settlement of Guadeloupe Sugar cane plantation on Guadeloupe The ships made a very fast passage to Guadeloupe, where they disembarked on 28 or 29 June 1635. The landing point was near Pointe-All√®gre (Sainte-Rose). L'Olive established himself west of Pointe All√®gre on the banks of what became the Vieux-Fort river, so called because Fort Saint-Pierre was built there. Du Plessis made his base east of Pointe All√®gre and built a small fort on the river that became called Petit-Fort river. No traces of these forts remain, but an old map shows their position. The governors went to Saint Christophe to confer with d‚ÄôEsnambuc. D'Enambuc saw the Guadeloupe venture as a threat to his authority, and took 150 picked colonists from Saint Christophe to Martinique, which he reached on 1 September 1635. He built the crude 3-gun Fort Saint- Pierre in two weeks before returning to Saint Christophe. The expedition was underfunded and badly organized. Father Jacques du Tetre records that they failed to stop in Barbados, where they could have bought food, and had only enough to eat for two months when they reached Guadeloupe. At first the Caribs were friendly, traded with the French and gave them fish and local produce. The French did not trust the Caribs, who stopped visiting after a skirmish. The settlers suffered from a famine in which many died. In desperation, the French decided to attack the Caribs, kill the men and take their women and possessions. L'Olive let them take over the gardens of the Caribs and steal their food. Cardinal Richelieu had given L'Olive the mission of converting the Caribs to Catholicism, which caused further problems. Some of the settlers left the colony and joined the Caribs, who treated them well. They learned to speak the Kalinago language, intermarried with the local people, and adopted local ways of building and cooking. Jean du Plessis seems to have been gentle, humane and prudent, and broke with the more brutal Charles de l'Olive. He took refuge with the Caribs, with whom he was friendly. Du Plessis embarked for France with Jean Fran√ßois du Buc late in 1635 after the Compagnie de Saint- Christophe had been ruined. He died on 4 December 1635, apparently on the return boat. The remaining colonists suffered from Carib reprisals and from yellow fever. They moved to the south of the island beside the present Vieux- Fort. Theophraste Renaudot brushed over the early problems with the French colonization of Guadeloupe in his Gazette of February 1638. He wrote, \\"The Sieur d'Olive did everything to gain the affection of the savages in this island ... he gave them crystals, mirrors, combs, whistles, needles and pins and other bagatelles. Between 1635 and 1641 L'Olive massacred the Caribs in Basse-Terre Island. On 2 December 1837 L'Olive was named captain general by the company, under the authority of the king's lieutenant general of the islands of America. Du Tetre relates that for his sins L'Olive was stricken by blindness and insanity. On 25 November 1640 Jean Aubert was named governor in place of L'Olive. Aubert did not spend any time in Guadeloupe, although he had a fine two-story wooden house built near the Sens River. L'Olive died in 1643. Charles Hou√´l du Petit Pr√©, named governor in place of Aubert, reached Fort Royal on 5 September 1643. He found everything in poor repair, and the gardens wrecked by a hurricane. The Rue du March√© in the former Paris municipality of La Chapelle was renamed Rue L'Olive(fr) in honor of the former governor by a decree of 10 February 1875. In October 2011 the Paris council decided to eliminate the reference to colonialism, and renamed the road to Rue de L'Olive. Notes Sources .

United States of America) is the formal name of a case in the International Court of Justice (ICJ). Iran filed a lawsuit with the Hague-based ICJ against the United States, on 16 July 2018, mainly based on the 1955 Treaty of Amity signed between the two sides, well before the Islamic revolution of Iran. Iranian officials said that US re- imposition of the nuclear sanctions was a violation of the treaty. At the time, the United States regarded the lawsuit as \\"baseless\\" and vowed to fight against it. Almost a month later, the case was heard by the ICJ within a week and the US was asked by the court's president to \\"respect the outcome.\\" On 3 October 2018, the International Court of Justice, the United Nations' highest court, issued an interim order to the United States \\"to lift sanctions linked to humanitarian goods and civil aviation imposed against Iran.\\" Background Long before Iran‚Äôs Islamic Revolution in 1979, Iran and the United States signed the Treaty of Amity which was meant to provide \\"a basis for friendly diplomatic exchanges and economic relations.\\" US President Donald Trump pulled out of a 2015 accord between Iran and \\"major world powers\\" whereupon some of the sanctions against Iran were lifted in exchange for Tehran accepting some limitations on its nuclear program. The US government then announced \\"unilateral plans\\" to re-impose sanctions against Iran. The Iranian government believed that the United States‚Äô decision on 8 May 2018, to re-impose nuclear sanctions on Iran was a violation of the United States' international obligations, \\"especially articles 4, 7, 8, 9, 10\\" of JCPOA and the Treaty of Amity. Consequently, Iran filed a lawsuit with the International Court of Justice on 16 July 2018. Outcome of the lawsuit About one month later, the ICJ heard the case and on 3 October, the United States was finally \\"reprimanded\\" for re-imposing sanctions on Iran and was ordered \\"to lift restrictive measures linked to humanitarian trade, food, medicine and civil aviation.\\" \\"On humanitarian grounds, the US must remove by means of its choosing any impediment to the free exportation to Iran of goods involving humanitarian concerns,\\" said the United Nations court's verdict on 3 October 2018. Mohammad Javad Zarif, the Iranian Foreign Minister, hailed the ruling and described it as \\"a victory for the rule of law.\\" Aftermath Attempting to limit its vulnerability to rulings by the International Court of Justice, the US government stated that they were exiting the Treaty of Amity with Iran, which requires \\"giving one year's written notice\\" according to the treaty itself.

Originally named Tosari when she was launched in 1890, she was renamed Admiral after a year when she was bought by Deutsche Ost-Afrika Linie. She joined the Red Cross Line in 1902 and worked the route for twelve years, with a short break in 1912 working in Australia when she was renamed City of Sydney, finally colliding with Shag Rock off the coast of Nova Scotia and sinking on 17 March 1914. She is known as the ship after which Rosalind Russell is named. Design Rosalind was a steamship built of steel, constructed by Swan Hunter & Wigham Richardson of Wallsend on the River Tyne. The vessel was registered at gross tonnage and net tonnage. The ship was long overall, with a beam of and a draught of . She was powered by a single three cylinder triple-expansion compound steam engine which drove a single propeller to give a cruising speed of , and carried both passengers and cargo. Career Launched on 30 October 1890, the ship was first named Tosari after the village in Java and joined the fleet of Dampfschiffs Rhederei zu Hamburg. However, within a year the company sold the vessel to Deutsche Ost-Afrika Linie who renamed her Admiral. Between 1902 and 1912, the ship was operated by Bowring Brothers on the Red Cross Line. The line had a tradition of naming their ships after characters from Shakespeare's plays, and so renamed Admiral after Rosalind in As You Like It. The ship provided a premium service for passengers to travel between St. John‚Äôs and New York via Halifax. The service was a popular attraction for the views that passengers saw on the journey as much as its destinations. It was while travelling on this service that James and Clara Russell decided to name their daughter after the ship; Rosalind Russell continued to treasure a picture of the ship during her film career. In 1912, Rosalind was sold to the St Lawrence Shipping Company and renamed City of Sydney. Unfortunately, she was involved in a collision with the tug Douglas H Thomas in Sydney Harbour which killed five people. Soon afterwards, she resumed work with the Red Cross Line and was back in the coastal waters of the Western Atlantic Ocean. Loss On 17 March 1914, the vessel was sailing from New York to Halifax carrying eleven passengers and a cargo of coal. Due to fog, as she approached her destination, she struck Shag Island near Sambro, Nova Scotia and, although everyone on board and much of the cargo was saved, the ship itself was lost. Legacy The ship was not the only Rosalind operated by Bowring. The company operated two more vessels named Rosalind, one from 1913 to 1917 and another 1919 to 1928.

She went on to work on links between art and text, particularly in inscriptions and in Greek literature in the Roman world, resulting in a number of articles and a co-edited volume on Art and Inscriptions in the Ancient World (2007). Newby's work on visual culture then extended into Greek mythology in Roman art, publishing her book Greek Myths in Roman Art and Culture (2016) with particular focus on the domestic and funerary contexts of mythological scenes. Newby is currently the Principal Investigator on the Leverhulme Trust funded project The Materiality of Graeco-Roman Festivals. The project examines the role that visual culture played in Greek civic festivals in the Roman Empire.

Design  The 126X features an angular, wedge design like many other concept cars of the time. It has a strip of lights along the hood that light up with either 3 red, 2 yellow, or 5 green lights depending on whether the vehicle is braking, at constant speed, or accelerating respectively. Similar strips were also included on the rear sides. It also features a front hinged canopy door that encompasses the roof, windscreen and the panels down to the sills.  Specifications  The 126X is powered by a transverse-mounted Nissan L-series, 3.0-liter 6-cylinder engine sending power to all four wheels. There is, however, no evidence that the 126X was actually roadworthy. Despite its wedge design, the 126X was a four seater.

Biography  Taras was born on March 9, 1964, in the city of Komunarsk, Voroshilovgrad oblast, the Ukrainian SSR (now there is the city of Alchevsk, Luhansk Oblast) in the family of thermophysics. His mother is from Vinnytsia Oblast, his father is from Kherson Oblast. Taras lived in Kyiv since he was 3 years old. In 1981, Taras graduated from Kyiv secondary school with advanced study of mathematics No.200. After school he entered the Kyiv Medical College No.3. From 1982 to 1984 Taras served in the Soviet Army in Grozny, Chechnya. From 1985 to 1988 he studied at the Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv (Department of Biology). In 1989, Taras went abroad to Italy, where he lived and worked until 1998. In 1998, he returned to Ukraine, accepting his friend's proposal to take over the post of general director of CJSC ‚ÄúAgro-Transport Coordination Service‚Äù (ZAT ‚ÄúAhro- transportna koordynatsiina sluzhba‚Äù). From 2003 to 2008 Taras studied \\"Law\\" at the Kyiv National University of Internal Affairs of Ukraine. Since 2007, he runs his own legal practice as entrepreneur.  Activity  = Public activity before the Revolution of Dignity = In 2005, Taras Kostanchuk, together with his comrades, founded a public organization \\"Archaeological Patriotic Search Association \\"Dnipro-Ukraine\\", which was engaged in the search and reburial of the remains of World War II soldiers. The organization operates in the present time on the territory of the Kyiv Oblast. The organization, for 7 years of its existence, recorded more than 800 soldiers, restored 106 names, and organized 17 mass and 11 single reburials. Under the direction of Taras Kostanchuk, the searchers created a large stationary museum of military archeology in Kyiv and 10 museums in secondary schools throughout Ukraine. There are more than 5000 exhibits in museums; 1774 units of explosive exhibits were transferred to the Ministry of Emergency Situations of Ukraine for elimination. = Participation in the Revolution of Dignity (2013-2014) = During the Revolution of Dignity (2013‚Äì2014) Taras was on the Maidan from the first days. As one of the oldest participants, Taras frequently had to take command and coordinate the actions of the activists. On the night of February 19, 2014, he held a rank along with other patriots, which became a shield against fire engines with water jets. The same day, Taras Kostanchuk got blast injury and wounded leg due to a grenade explosion. = Participation in Anti-Terrorist Operation (ATO) = In May 2014, Taras Kostanchuk with personal weapons went to Donbas, where he joined the so-called ‚Äúmen in black‚Äù who opposed the militiamen in several districts of the Donetsk Oblast. From June 1, 2014, he arrived to the training base in the village of Novi Petrivtsi (Kyiv Oblast), in order to train volunteers ‚Äì who prepared to go to the ATO area. In early July 2014, after three weeks of training, Taras Kostanchuk joined a volunteer battalion \\"Donbas\\", and went with his comrades to the combat zone near Artemivsk. On the first night in the ATO area, the recruits of the battalion ‚ÄúDonbas‚Äù, being at the temporary base of the battalion in the Artemivsk school, fell under the tight fire of the enemy. Under the command of Taras Kostanchuk they managed to repel the fire and defend their positions without loss. Reflecting on the night attack of militants, the fighters of the battalion ‚ÄúDonbas‚Äù took active steps to liberate Artemivsk from terrorists, build checkpoints in and outside the city, as well as prepared for cleansing operation. In July 2014, Taras Kostanchuk as the commander of the assault group of the battalion ‚ÄúDonbas‚Äù with his comrades conducted the operations to liberate the Ukrainian cities of Popasna, Lysychansk, and Pervomaisk. = Battle of Ilovaisk = Planning the storming of Ilovaisk On August 10, 2014, the Armed Forces of Ukraine along with the fighters of the battalions ‚ÄúDonbas‚Äù, ‚ÄúAzov‚Äù, ‚ÄúShakhtarsk‚Äù and ‚ÄúRight Sector‚Äù began an operation to liberate the city of Ilovaisk. The general Ruslan Khomchak was planning the operation together with the commanders of the battalions. Taras Kostanchuk also participated in the planning of liberation. The main task was to liberate Ilovaisk completely from terrorists and take the city. The minimum goal was to conduct the \\"developing attack\\" in order to understand the forces of the enemy. That task was fulfilled during the first entry in Ilovaisk on August 10, 2014. It was found that the enemy is well positioned. The volunteer battalions needed the reinforcements. On August 18, 2014, the fighters of the battalion ‚ÄúDonbas‚Äù entered with heavy fighting in Ilovaisk and were able to knock out terrorists from the eastern part of the city. During the battles 3 checkpoints and 4 enemy firing points were destroyed. Till morning of August 19, the ATO forces took control over the most of the city. On August 19, 2014, during a combat task Taras Kostanchuk, having been seriously injured in his head and with a blast injury, got into encirclement in the center of Ilovaisk. Together with a comrade who was seriously injured in leg, Taras was hiding in local resident's house for 3 weeks. And only after 3 weeks, he was able to get out of the encirclement thanks to the help of local patriots. = Public activity after participation in ATO = Immediately after treatment and short- term rehabilitation, Taras Kostanchuk began to take charge of the liberation of his comrades from captivity. He took part in negotiations with separatists, agreed on the exchange of prisoners, helped to bring them out of the ATO. At the end of 2014, Taras Kostanchuk along with his military comrades created a civil organization \\"Military-Patriotic Association of the ATO participants \\"Justice\\". The purpose of the organization is to protect the interests of ordinary citizens, fight against arbitrariness and corruption of officials, as well as assistance to the former ATO participants. The organization has its representative offices in several cities of Ukraine. In August 2015, the \\"Justice\\" office was opened in the city of Vyshneve, Kyiv oblast. The organization includes activists, volunteers, public representatives and entrepreneurs, in addition to soldiers. The organization \\"Justice\\" currently has thousands of participants. The results of the activity of CO \\"Justice\\" were large-scale actions against the arbitrariness of some public authorities, demonstrations and petitions to the President of Ukraine on the protection of the rights of volunteers, large-scale actions of direct action to protect the interests of Ukrainian citizens. In particular, Taras Kostanchuk worked personally on the amendment to the Law of Ukraine on social protection of reservists suffering as a result of participation in the ATO, and of their family members. The main purpose of these changes is the equivalence of volunteers, who were sent to the ATO zone illegally from May to December 2014 in the status of reservists, to military personnel, and thus to overcome injustice in providing social benefits and other assistance to soldiers. The law was voted by deputies of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine and signed by the president of Ukraine as a result of repeated pressure on officials during the public actions, disclosure of this problem in the media and personal involvement of Taras Kostanchuk in drafting the law. In the beginning of 2015, Taras Kostanchuk, along with the fighters, who went through the Battle of Ilovaisk, and the families of the dead soldiers, founded the Ilovaisk Brotherhood, which at present has more than two thousand members, comrades from different units of the Ukrainian armed forces and volunteer battalions. The members of the Ilovaisk Brotherhood helped each other to coordinate actions, shared information about the wounded, captured and dead soldiers. By the first anniversary of the Ilovaisk tragedy (August 2015), the members of the Ilovaisk Brotherhood introduced the award \\"Ilovaisk 2014\\" as a cross. Only Ilovaisk fighters, or the families of dead or missing soldiers, have the right to receive it. After several joint actions of the Ilovaisk Brotherhood from December 2015 to February 2016 with the demands to punish the culpable in the most massive tragedies of modern Ukraine (Savur-Mohyla, IL-76, Donetsk airport, Ilovaisk, Debaltseve), under pressure from ATO veterans, Taras Kostanchuk was invited to get acquainted with a criminal proceedings concerning the Ilovaisk tragedy, and received admission to the proceedings files. In March 2016, the CO \\"Justice\\", headed by Taras Kostanchuk, took part in the unifying congress of civic organizations and publicly announced its intention to change officials who came to power on the blood of patriots. Taras Kostanchuk offered soldiers and ATO veterans to go to power in one team. At the end of April 2016, Taras Kostanchuk visited Zagreb, where he had several working meetings with veterans of the liberation war in Croatia. They shared experience of the success of the Serb de-occupation operation, and also talked about the influence and direct participation of veterans in the political and public activities of Croatia. According to Taras Kostanchuk, this experience should to be taken from the Croats in order to win the war and restore the occupied territories of Ukraine. From March to November 2016, Taras Kostanchuk together with his colleagues from the CO \\"Justice\\" visited Ukrainian cities, where he spoke with local citizens and ATO participants. At these meetings, he presented the program \\"Army of Dignity\\", which was aimed at uniting fighters, ATO veterans, non-indifferent and active citizens around a common idea ‚Äì the creation of a democratic, European state of Ukraine. Taras Kostanchuk considers introducing the \\"presumption of guilt\\" of civil servants as one of the first steps to overcoming corruption in Ukraine. When an official can not explain the legality and source of the capital he/she has acquired, he/she must become automatically a suspect in corruption and prove his/her innocence in a court: On June 8, 2017, Taras Kostanchuk along with his comrades initiated the creation of the ATO Veterans' Council on Ethics and Morality to fight against pseudo-ATO organizations that use combatants in illegal schemes. In August 2017, before the third anniversary of the Ilovaisk tragedy, Taras Kostanchuk together with the association ‚ÄúIlovaisk Brotherhood‚Äù, as well as other ATO members, members of the dead soldiers‚Äô families, organized a large-scale action under the General Prosecutor's Office of Ukraine with demands to provide at least interim results of the investigation: On December 12, 2017, the CO \\"Justice\\", headed by Taras Kostanchuk, signed an agreement with international investors on the transfer of innovative technologies to Ukraine in the agro-industrial sector. The main idea of this initiative is to reduce the existing technological and cultural gap and to use this unique opportunity for cooperation between the two countries in the interests of each of them. To this end, ATO participants with their lands for agriculture can be involved. = Charitable activity. Establishment of the charity fund to support the ATO participants \\"Justice\\" = In the beginning of 2016, Taras Kostanchuk created a charity organization \\"Justice\\", which was aimed at helping the wounded soldiers and ATO veterans, the families of the dead and missing soldiers, as well as the children of ATO participants. During two years the organization carries out events for children for various holidays, provides material assistance to the needy soldiers and their families, organizes children's rest. In June 2017, Taras Kostanchuk along with fighters and volunteers of the charity fund \\"Justice‚Äù organized an action in support of an oncologic patient ‚Äì a niece of Oleksii Dreval, who died in Ilovaisk in 2014. Together with the family of the girl and non-indifferent citizens, they conducted several actions under the walls of the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine, the Ministry of Health of Ukraine with demands to provide money (or letter of guarantee) from the state to carry out bone marrow transplantation operations for oncologic patients. Thanks to the joint efforts, the girl was able to obtain an informational (guarantee) letter from the Ministry of Health of Ukraine and conduct an operation.

He is notable for his involvement in the puritan group at the Hampton Court Conference and his confrontation with Archbishop Richard Bancroft soon afterwards, and in later life for his resistance to a challenge to his ministry brought on personal grounds by Sir Edward Powell, Master of Requests. Associated with various groups and patrons interested in the emigrant puritan ministry in America, he was prebendary of Wherwell in Hampshire, under the patronage of the Barons De La Warr, and vicar of Westonzoyland, Somerset for most of his career, and is thought to have been a chaplain to George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham. Education Of Wiltshire origins, Earbury entered Magdalen Hall in the University of Oxford as a commoner, matriculating in October 1589 aged 18. He graduated B.A. at Merton College on 5 February 1591/92, and M.A. on 12 November 1594.'Earburye, Antony', in J. Foster (ed.), Alumni Oxonienses 1500-1714 (Oxford, 1891), pp. 440-79 (British History Online, accessed 4 October 2018). On 13 March 1598/99 he received royal presentation to the archdeaconry of St Asaph.Lambeth Palace Library, CM/10/22. He was instituted to the Rectory of Wherwell (Winchester jurisdiction) in May 1602 on the lay presentation of Anna, the dowager Lady De La Warr,West's second wife: the first (and mother of his heir Thomas) was Elizabeth Strange of Hunstanton. whose husband William West had died in 1595.Anne, the daughter of Henry and Elizabeth Swift of Andover, Hampshire, had married first Thomas Oliver; after the death of West, her second husband, she remarried to Richard Kemish of Andover. Kemish died in 1611, and Anne survived him. See Monumental Inscription on the tomb at St Mary the Virgin church, Andover: 'Parishes: Andover with Foxcott', in W. Page (ed.), A History of the County of Hampshire, Vol. 4 (London, 1911), pp. 345-58 (British History Online, accessed 6 October 2018). West himself (who had survived a conviction for treason under Queen Mary in connection with Henry Dudley's conspiracy) had presented the notable puritan Stephen Bachiler to the vicarage of Wherwell in 1587,CCEd, 'Person: Earbury, Anthony (1602-1639)', Person ID 56628. and Bachiler was still in occupation at Earbury's institution as rector, the two men appearing together in the Liber cleri of 1603.CCEd, 'Person: Earbury, Anthony (1602-1639)', Person ID 56628. Location: Parish (Church): Wherwell CCEd Location ID: 15051 (Church of England Clergy database). As prebendary rector of Wherwell, in which he continued until 1635, Earbury remained directly associated with the patronage of the De La Warr family, successively under Thomas West, 2nd Baron De La Warr (son of the first baron), who died in March 1601/02, and then of his son Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr, who was Governor-for-life and Captain-general of the Colony of Virginia until his death in 1618.(T.

The Sussex Petition Earbury is stated to have been part of the inner circle, together with John Rainolds, Laurence Chaderton, John Knewstubs and other University men and ministers, who prepared and advanced the Millenary Petition of 1603, meekly advocating to King James a series of reforms in the established church to enable puritan ministers to remain in conformity with it.R.G. Usher, The Reconstruction of the English Church (D. Appleton and Company, New York and London 1910), Vol. I, p. 254-56 (Internet Archive). Its success led to the formation of a puritan committee in London, led by Henry Jacob, to advance petitions on behalf of ministers and congregations in various regions of the country.P. Collinson, J. Craig, and B. Usher (eds), Conferences and Combination Lectures in the Elizabethan Church: Dedham and Bury St Edmunds 1582-1590, Church of England Records Society Vol. 10 (Boydell Press, 2003), pp. 130-32, & note 378 (Google). The editors fail to notice Earbury in the Alumni Oxonienses. Earbury was particularly involved with Stephen Goffe, rector of Bramber,Father of the regicide William Goffe, see C. Durston, 'Goffe, William (d. 1679?)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (2004). Samuel Norden, rector of Hamsey,Nordon was presented by Dorothy Lewknor nee Wroth in 1592, widow of Edward Lewknor, the cousin and co-accused of William West in 1556. Cced.

This raised such a stir that its promoters, including Earbury, were arrested in late September 1603 at the instigation of John Whitgift and Richard Bancroft, and were interrogated by the Bishop of Chichester and the Privy Council.Usher, The Reconstruction of the English Church, I, pp. 306-09, and sources there cited. Despite these difficulties, Earbury, Norden, Frewen and Goldsmith represented Sussex among the puritan reformists admitted to the Hampton Court Conference in 1604.Report on the Manuscripts of Lord Montagu of Beaulieu, Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts (HMSO, London 1900), pp. 32-40, at p. 34. Among those occupying formal places in the conference Chaderton (Master of Emmanuel College, Cambridge) and Reinolds (President of Corpus Christi College, Oxford) were received gracefully, but the King thought the prominent East Anglian puritan Knewstubs an uncharitable man. Richard Bancroft Soon after this, Earbury challenged the episcopal party in the person of Richard Bancroft, then Bishop of London. He found that Bancroft had, over the preceding years and up to the present, been involved in secret discussions and negotiations with the Catholics.Usher, The Reconstruction of the English Church, I, p. 346-47. He drafted a bill accusing Bancroft of treason, which was printed and put forth by William Jones, puritan propagandist.W.H. Curtis, 'William Jones: Puritan printer and propagandist', The Library: A Quarterly Review of Bibliography, series 5, vol. XIX, Issue 1 (1 January 1964), pp. 38-66. Earbury was then living in the Devon house of Thomas West, \\"more in curtesie then for anie stipend\\".M.F. Stieg & M.S. Dalton, Laud's Laboratory, the Diocese of Bath and Wells in the Early Seventeenth Century (Associated University Presses, Inc., 1982), p. 192.

The prisoners made their petitions for release,'Earbury's petition', 05 July 1604, in Journal of the House of Commons, 1, pp. 252-53 (British History Online). and it appears that, while Bancroft had in fact been in negotiation with the Catholics this had been with royal approval from both Queen Elizabeth and King James, and the Council was mainly concerned because the secret discussions had been \\"leaked\\".Usher, Reconstruction of the English Church, I, pp. 346-47 (Internet Archive). Earbury, being in possession of this knowledge, was released without further adverse consequences, and indeed managed to retain his position as prebendary rectory of Wherwell, while by 1605 Samuel Norden, Stephen Goffe and Stephen Bachiler were deprived or ejected from their livings for their unwillingness to conform.'Norden, Samuel (1582-1605)', CCEd Person ID: 72973; 'Goffe, Stephen (1600-1622)', CCEd Person ID: 106979; 'Frewen, John (1582-1613)', CCEd Person ID: 69517; 'Bachiler, Stephen (1587-1605)', CCEd Person ID: 83757 (Church of England Clergy database). Earbury was by this time married, his son Mathias born c. 1604Aged 15 on matriculation in 1621. This Mathias Earbury is not to be confused with a namesake active c. 1690-1730. and his daughter Jane c. 1609.Aged 22 at marriage to Thomas Dymocke in 1631. On 10 July 1605 the four Wardens of the Worshipful Company of Mercers in London nominated Anthony Earbury MA to the Dean and Chapter of Canterbury Cathedral, to be presented by them to Archbishop Bancroft for the rectory of St Michael Paternoster Royal, London.Canterbury Cathedral Archives, Ref. CCA-DCc- ChAnt/L/112 (Discovery Catalogue). Sir Richard Martyn Soon after this Earbury became involved in the case of John Eccleston (or Eglestone), a debtor in Ludgate Prison. A Warden of the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths in 1587/88, Eccleston helped prepare and approve the cases of weights for use in Elizabeth's reforms of her gold and silver coinage.R. Ruding, Annals of the Coinage of Great Britain and its Dependencies, 3rd Edition (John Hearne, London 1840), Vol. 1, pp. 351-52 (Google). His sister Dorcas (died 1599) was the wife of Sir Richard Martyn, Master of the Mint 1582-1617, Lord Mayor of London 1588/89 and 1593/94, and Master of the Goldsmiths' Company in 1592/93. The Martyns were supporters of presbyterian reform of the church. With a fellow goldsmith Eccleston had acquired two parts, and a lease of the third, of the manor of Elsham Priory, in Elsham, North Lincolnshire, from Henry Stanley, 4th Earl of Derby, all of which in time passed to Eccleston alone.Chancery Final Decrees, Sir Richard Martyn v. Anthony Erburie, 6 May, 7 James I, Ref. C78/152/15. View images at AALT, C78/152 IMG 0004, 0005, 0006, 0007. In 1597 several goldsmiths had complained that Martyn was retaining large sums from them and converting it to his own use.Ruding, Annals of the Coinage of Great Britain, I, p. 352. By the early 1600s Eccleston had fallen heavily into debt, not least to Sir Richard Martyn, and was imprisoned for some long time.Chancery Final Decrees, Sir Richard Martyn v. Anthony Erburie, 6 May, 7 James I, Ref. C78/152/15. Martyn claimed that his brother-in-law had agreed in prison to convey his titles in Elsham to him in settlement of more than ¬£2000 owing to him. However at the same time Anthony Earbury was visiting Eccleston in prison (\\"under colour of religion and charitie\\") and came to a like agreement to get Eccleston released, to pay off all his debts and to provide him with an annuity of 100 marks, for a similar conveyance to himself. Earbury effected his release on bail and the conveyance was then made. According to Martyn, who (finding his own expectations thwarted) painted Earbury's actions in a highly damning light, Earbury did not pay Martyn what he was owed, and refused Eccleston his annuity, with the result that Eccleston was arrested for a debt of ¬£5 and later died in prison. In 1608 Martyn brought suit against Earbury, who by his rejoinder admitted that he owed Martyn ¬£200 but otherwise stayed away from court. In 1609 in a Judgement in Default the Court of Chancery ordered Earbury to pay him this sum with costs, but made no other ruling in the matter.See also The National Archives, Chancery C 2/JasI/E4/36, Earburie v. Martyn.

Valentine Knightley, who died in 1618, had in 1605 presented a petition with Sir Edward Montagu on behalf of 36 deprived puritan ministers of Northamptonshire, an action which was regarded so severely by the Council that Knightley and Montagu, who refused to withdraw, were stripped of their offices.V.C.D.

Westonzoyland If Sir Richard Martyn was a formidable disfavourer, his death (in office) on 17 July 1617 eased the way for Earbury's preferment two weeks later (30 July) to the living of Westonzoyland, near Bridgwater in Somerset, in the gift of the extremely influential merchant and royal jeweller Sir Peter Vanlore,CCEd, Appointment Records ID 97088, & 291818. to whom King James was heavily indebted both for loans and for the supply of jewellery.V. Larminie, 'Vanlore, Sir Peter [formerly Pieter van Loor] (c. 1547‚Äì1627), merchant and moneylender', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Lord De La Warr died in 1618. Earbury's courtly patronage went further, for in 1620 it is recorded that he missed the parish perambulation of Weston because 'hee was then attendinge his lorde the Marquis of Buckingham', from which it is supposed that he was chaplain to the King's favourite, George Villiers.CCEd, 'Person: Earbury, Anthony (1602-1639)', Person ID 56628, 'Comment'. In 1621 he was one of the 28 \\"respected friends and brethren in the ministry\\" (sympathetic colleagues among the Somerset clergy) to whom the puritan Richard Bernard of Batcombe, Somerset, dedicated his enlarged handbook for ministers, The Faithfull Shepherd.R. Bernard, The Faithfull Shepherd, wholy in a manner transposed, 3rd Edition (Thomas Pavier, London 1621), dedication in front matter (Internet Archive).

Tan, 'Richard Bernard and His Publics: A Puritan Minister as Author' (PhD Dissertation, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee 2015), p. 24 (pdf p. 41) (Vanderbilt ETD). At Weston he was a very near neighbour of Sir Thomas Wroth of Petherton Park who, with Lady Wroth's brother Sir Nathaniel Rich was, like Vanlore, invested in the Virginia Company and similar colonial enterprise in the Americas, and sympathetic to the activities of the emigrant ministry. Also a near neighbour, a fellow dedicatee of Bernard's Faithfull Shepherd (one of the six \\"learned and judicious divines\\"), was the elder Dr Cudworth, a conforming minister and scholar, rector of Aller, Somerset (under the patronage of Emmanuel College, Cambridge), whose wife was a cousin of Lady Wroth's and probably the granddaughter of Samuel Norden's former patron at Hamsey. Earbury was present with Lady Wroth at Dr Cudworth's deathbed in 1624.Will of Raphe Cudworthe, Doctor of Divinity, Parson of Aller, Somerset (P.C.C. 1624, Byrde quire).On 1 July 1619 Earbury was a witness at the publishing of the will of Hercules Holworthie of Kidsbury, a settlement in Wembdon near Bridgwater: see J.H. Lea (ed.), Abstracts of Wills in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury: Register SOAME, 1620 (NEHGS, Boston 1904), no. 703, pp. 233-34 (Internet Archive). John Stoughton, Cudworth's immediate successor at Aller, was a clergyman of millennialist views who engaged closely with Wroth and other promoters of the New England emigration. P.S.

At Weston Earbury ran into problems over a house belonging to the vicarage, which a former vicar had leased successively to various people who now laid claims to it, and he was obliged to bring suit against two men whom he thought had combined to defraud him.Laud's Laboratory, p. 139 and p. 146 (Google).

The author of the Victoria County History for Somerset suggests that a younger Anthony Earbury succeeded as vicar of Weston in 1629,'Parishes: Westonzoyland', in V.C.H. Somerset Vol. 8. CCEd does not show such a differentiation. A later Anthony Earbury, rector of Upper Clatford in Hampshire, died in 1669 ('Earbury, Anthony (1662-1669)', CCEd Person ID: 92958) and is probably the Anthony Earberie who matriculated from Christ Church, Oxford in November 1650, see Foster, Alumni Oxonienses. He may be the son of Mathias. but most authorities consider the same Anthony to have continued until his death in 1638/39. In 1627 he was witness to the will of John Roze of Lyme Regis,Will of John Roze the elder of Lyme Regis, merchant (P.C.C. 1627, Skynner quire).

At Wherwell, where Earbury was still prebendary, he was also not far distant from William Noyes at Cholderton (formerly minister to Lady Wroth's parental household at Leez in Essex 'Will of Richard Rich of Leigh, gentleman', Essex Record Office D/ABW 32/91.), whose sons Nicholas and James Noyes, and nephew Thomas Parker,C.

Dr Stoughton's stepson James Cudworth emigrated to Scituate in the same year, and reported on the appointments in the New England townships.'Letter of James Cudworth of Scituate, 1634', (to Dr. Stoughton), in New England Historical and Genealogical Register 14 (1860), pp. 101-04. Sir Edward Powell The installation of William Laud as Archbishop in 1633 set in train the many proceedings in the Court of High Commission against ministers of Puritan sympathy, which dogged Earbury's last years. Letters from Thomas Wroth and James Cudworth, regarded as potentially subversive, were seized from Dr Stoughton, who remained in contact with his associates in Somerset and Dorset,M.A. Everett Greene, Diary of John Rous, Incumbent of Santon Downham, Suffolk Camden Society, Old Series Vol. LXVI (1866), pp. 79-80. but he and Wroth escaped serious consequences. Sir Edward Powell, Master of Requests, was son-in-law of Peter Vanlore and now lord of the manor of Westonzoyland and patron of the living. The parishioners had long before built a fair Church-house at their own expense, and had employed it for over 100 years for the benefit of the church. (In 1634 it was said to have been used previously as a school.'Parishes: Westonzoyland', V.C.H. Somerset, Vol. 8, citing Somerset Record Office D/D/Ca 297.) Powell took possession of it and built a common bakehouse there for his own benefit. Earbury presented a petition about this to Archbishop Laud at his Visitation, as a result of which Powell interrogated Earbury, the churchwardens and sidesmen in the court in Wells.'Addendum to Appendix B': Petition to Archbishop Laud by Anthony Earbury (State Paper Office, Hadspen MSS, v.x.71), in E. Hobhouse (ed.), Church- Wardens' Accounts of Croscombe, Pilton, Yatton, Tintinhull, Morebath and St. Michael's, Bath, Somerset Record Society Vol. IV (1890), p. 247 (Internet Archive). The patron took advantage of Earbury's known sympathies to denounce him to the court of High Commission as a contumacious minister. A Commission was decreed against him in January to February 1634/35,J. Bruce (ed.), Calendar of State Papers (Domestic), Charles I: 1634-35 (Longman, Green, Longman, Roberts and Green, London 1864), pp. 493, 532, 534, 542. (Internet Archive) and through 1635 witnesses were raised against him, examined, and depositions taken.J. Bruce (ed.), Calendar of State Papers (Domestic), Charles I: 1635 (Longman, Green, Longman, Roberts and Green, London 1865), pp. 192, 196, 198, 207, 215, 221 (Google). J.

At this time Earbury resigned his tenure as prebend of Wherwell, which was granted to his son Matthias in succession to his father by Cecilia, dowager Lady De La Warr, whose husband Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr had died on a return voyage to Virginia in 1618.Appointment Record, CCEd Record ID: 200728 (Church of England Clergy database). Earbury however brought his petition against Powell, which proceeded to the Court of Star Chamber, showing that Powell, as lord of the manor, was motivated by the intention to deprive him of tithes belonging to the vicarage of Westonzoyland.J. Bruce (ed.), Calendar of State Papers (Domestic), Charles I: 1635-36 (Longmans, Green, Reader, and Dyer, London 1866), p. 306 (Internet Archive). In May 1636 Earbury made further petition to the Commission that the two matters were interdependent, and should both be deliberated upon by the Bishop of Bath and Wells.J. Bruce (ed.), Calendar of State Papers (Domestic), Charles I: 1635-36 (Longmans, Green, Reader, and Dyer, London 1866), pp. 483, 490, 519 (Internet Archive). This was granted, and in August 1638 Bishop William Piers found in Earbury's favour. The witnesses against Earbury, who were stewards of the manor, were unable or unwilling to agree on the valuation of the arrearages, and the Bishop therefore made his own valuation and ordered Powell to repay the money to Earbury.J. Bruce, Calendar of State Papers (Domestic), Charles I: 1637-38 (London 1869), p. 602. The National Archives list a will in the Prerogative Court of Canterbury Registers (Harvey quire) for \\"Anthony Earbery of Weston Zoyland, Somerset\\". The will, written in September 1638 and proved on 16 February 1638/39, as found in the register does not refer to Weston Zoyland, and makes provision for two sons, Sackvile and Edward, a daughter Lettice and her child Dinah. The testator is a clerk and he leaves his books to be sold. He makes no reference to Matthias, who was certainly living.

The term associative classification was coined by Bing Liu et al., in which the authors defined a model made of rules \\"whose right-hand side are restricted to the classification class attribute\\".  Model  The model generated by an AC and used to label new records consists of association rules, where the consequent corresponds to the class label. As such, they can also be seen as a list of \\"if-then\\" clauses: if the record matches some criteria (expressed in the left side of the rule, also called antecedent), it is then labeled accordingly to the class on the right side of the rule (or consequent). Most ACs read the list of rules in order, and apply the first matching rule to label the new record.  Metrics  The rules of an AC inherit some of the metrics of association rules, like the support or the confidence. Metrics can be used to order or filter the rules in the model and to evaluate their quality.  Implementations  The first proposal of a classification model made of association rules was CBA, although other authors had previously proposed the mining of association rules for classification. Other authors have since then proposed multiple changes to the initial model, like the addition of a redundant rule pruning phase or the exploitation of Emerging Patterns.

The original Grandassa models were Clara Lewis, Black Rose, Helene Nomsa Brath and, Priscilla Bardonille, Mari Toussaint, Esther Davenport, Wanda Sims, Sikolo Braithwaite, Beatrice Cramston, and Ann Tripp. Ann Tripp is the News Director for the Steve Harvey Show and WBLS/WLIB Radio and is quoted as saying \\"they were forerunners of the natural hair movement... We tried to make black people feel proud of who they were, no matter what complexion or hair type.\\" AJASS continued to hold \\"Naturally\\" beautiful shows regularly thru and 1980s, and then ten year anniversaries until 2002. In 1963 AJASS created The Black Standard Publishing Company. They published two booklets; \\"Naturally '63 Portfolio, and later in 1963 \\"Color Us Cullud\\", the AJASS theater company.

He is known for combining fingerstyle, percussive guitar techniques as well as electronic and orchestral production. He gained popularity in 2015 after winning the ninth edition of Polish talent show Must Be The Music, the prize for which was 100,000 Polish z≈Çoty and an additional 100,000 z≈Çoty for promotion of his music on Polish radio station RMF FM. After local success he went on to release his debut record HUSH, the release of which was accompanied by singles including Patrzalek's percussive arrangement of Isaac Alb√©niz's \\"Asturias\\"; the video of the arrangement was released through fingerstyle label CandyRat Records. In subsequent years Patrza≈Çek's popularity grew rapidly beyond Polish borders due to multiple viral releases online. His videos were posted by notable publishers such as Metal Hammer and Classic FM, as well as independently. Patrzalek's performances have amassed around 100 million views online, the main contributors to this number being his solo acoustic guitar arrangements of Beethoven's fifth symphony, \\"Toxicity\\" by System of a Down and Paganini's \\"Caprice no. 24\\". In 2018 Patrza≈Çek became an official endorser of Ibanez acoustic guitars. At the end of the same year he won the 5th edition of major Italian TV talent show Tu Si Que Vales, broadcast by Canale 5, receiving a standing ovation from the judges for the first time ever in the show. The prize for winning was ‚Ç¨100,000.  Career  Patrza≈Çek started playing the guitar at age 10 when he picked up classical guitar under the guidance of local teacher Jerzy Pikor. After two years he started studying flamenco techniques, being taught by Spanish guitarist Carlos Pinana. Later, at age 13, Patrzalek started playing fingerstyle on an acoustic guitar. It quickly became his main instrument and after around a year of self-taught practice in 2015 he won the ninth edition of Polish talent-show Must Be The Music. Around that time he started creating electronic music on his computer and combining it with guitar playing, which later resulted in the creation of his debut record HUSH. In March 2018 it was announced that Patrza≈Çek had become an official endorser of Ibanez guitars - he plays the AE900-NT and AVD80-NT models. In 2016, Patrza≈Çek released his debut LP, HUSH. The album is composed of ten pieces: six original tracks (acoustic guitar with electronic and orchestral production elements), two arrangements and two electronic remixes. The album was released independently on October 7, 2016, with distribution in Poland by Polish label My Music.

The series, which stars Sophie Rundle and Russell Tovey in the principal roles, follows Fiona Griffiths (Rundle), a detective constable with the Cardiff Major Crimes Squad, who tries to solve the murders of a prostitute and her daughter, while dealing with the effects of Cotard's Syndrome, which has left her with a deep and peculiar empathy for the dead. The series was broadcast as the fifth and final project in the Drama Matters strand, a strand designed by Sky Living bosses to highlight the ability of female actors in leading roles. The series is based upon the novel of the same name by Harry Bingham, and also stars Mark Lewis Jones, Lois Winstone, Christine Tremarco and Keith Allen in leading roles. The series was released on Region 2 DVD in the Netherlands in 2014. Reception The series broadcast to mixed reception, with Alison Graham of the Radio Times writing; \\"One day someone will invent a female detective who‚Äôll cleverly solve crimes, who will work within the rules and who will return home to a nice partner with whom she has a happy relationship. Until then we have the likes of unkempt, very young DC Fiona Griffiths, who clumsily drops her files on her first day as a rookie member of the Cardiff major crimes team and who, though very bright, is obviously battling unspecified demons. Talking to the Dead is a woolly, hard- to-fathom story that is saved entirely by the winning Rundle, who you will want to see again.\\" Jane Simon of The Mirror wrote a similar review, commenting; \\"The last in the Drama Matters series is my least favourite but, ironically, the one most likely to go to a full series because it‚Äôs another off-kilter police procedural of the kind TV viewers can‚Äôt seem to get their fill of. It‚Äôs also the only one in the run to be served up in two parts with the concluding half on Thursday. Sophie Rundle, who‚Äôs currently being so ballsy in Peaky Blinders, stars as the terrifyingly young-looking detective constable Fiona Griffiths with Russell Tovey as a fellow cop. I was really looking forward to the moment when Fiona would solve her first murder by actually talking to the dead, or more specifically, the moment when the dead would talk to her. But like Wire in the Blood and Waking the Dead, that title promises much more spookiness than it delivers.\\" Ellen Jones of The Independent published a slightly more positive review, writing; \\"Detective Fiona Griffiths began her first day in a new job by clumsily dropping all her casework folders at the feet of her CO. Apparently, she's old enough to be investigating murders, despite looking approximately 12. You may recognise the actress as 25-year-old Sophie Rundle, who plays Ada Shelby in BBC2's Peaky Blinders. That's the more glamorous role, but it's her performance in this two-part crime drama that really reveals Rundle's charm. This adaptation clearly struggled to sort the story's myriad details into a properly paced sixty minutes, but once you gave up on following the murder plot, there was plenty else to enjoy. The four previous one-off dramas in Sky Living's Drama Matters series have varied from unsatisfying morsels to hearty dramatic meals. Like one of Kimberly's perfectly baked canap√©s, Talking to the Dead offered just enough flavour to tantalise, while leaving us hungry for the next course.\\" Cast * Sophie Rundle as DC Fiona Griffiths * Russell Tovey as DS Huw Brydon * Mark Lewis Jones as DCI Owen Jackson * Lois Winstone as Stacey Edwards * Christine Tremarco as DC Eluned 'Elli' Jones * Keith Allen as Robbie Griffiths * Syrus Lowe as DC Carl Richards * Ivana Ba≈°iƒá as Asya Adamkute * Adrian Schiller as Dr. Price * Mufrida Hayes as Sue Phillips * Niall Greig Fulton as Aras Kalvaitis * Hywel Morgan as Paul Fletcher * Michael Smiley as David Penry * Jens Hult√©n as Lev * Jay Simpson as Jimmy Dawkins * Manon Eames as Gwen Griffiths * Anita Reynolds as Deryn Franklin * Amita Dhiri as Mrs. Rattigan * Richard Tunley as DCI Matthews * Huw Davies as Graham Redmond * Keith Woodason as Jon Carey * Karli Vale as Caron Rhys * Amy Loughton as Andi Rodriguez Episodes { class=\\"wikitable plainrowheaders\\" style=\\"width:80%;\\" - style=\\"color:#ffffff;\\" ! style=\\"background:#333366;\\" Episode ! style=\\"background:#333366;\\" Title ! style=\\"background:#333366;\\" Written by ! style=\\"background:#333366;\\" Directed by ! style=\\"background:#333366;\\" Original airdate ! style=\\"background:#333366;\\" Viewers (millions) } References External links * Category:2013 British television series debuts Category:2013 British television series endings Category:2010s British drama television series Category:2010s British crime drama television series Category:2010s British television miniseries Category:Sky Living original programming Category:English-language television shows Category:British police procedural television series Category:Television shows set in Cardiff ","title":"Talking to the Dead (TV series)"},{"id":"58655860","text":"Mount Laojun (also called Jingshi Mountain ÊôØÂÆ§Â±±) is a mountain in Henan Province, China.

Idaea, p. 227. was, by some accounts, the daughter of the Scythian king Dardanus, and the second wife of Phineus, the king of Thrace.Grimal, s.v. Idaea p. 227; Tripp, s.v. Idaea (1), p. 315. Idaea's false accusations against her stepsons, were responsible for her husbands misfortunes. She was sent back to Scythia, where she was condemned to death.Diodorus Siculus, 4.44.3-4. Other ancient sources give other names for Phineus's second wife, including: Eidothea, sister of Cadmus, and Eurytia.Hard, pp. 386, 387; Smith, s.v. Phineus 3, which also mentions Dia as another name given. Mythology Idaea's husband was the blind seer Phineus, plagued by the Harpies, who was encountered by Jason and the Argonauts, when they landed in Thrace. By some accounts, it was Phineus' second wife Idaea who was the responsible for her husbands' blindness. According to one tradition, Phineus' first wife was Cleopatra the daughter of Boreas, god of the North wind. Phineus had two sons by Cleopatra (variously named), who were falsely accused by Phineus' second wife Idaea, causing Phineus to (or allow Idaea to) blind, or imprison and torture, or kill his sons. In punishment for this crime against his sons, Phineus was himself blinded. =Sources= Phineus' second wife is first encountered in the works of the fifth-century BC Greek poet Sophocles.For a detailed account of the early sources for Phineus' story see Gantz, pp. 349-356\\\\. See also Hard, pp. 386-387; Jebb, Headlam, and Pearson, pp. 311-315; Frazers's note 1 to Apollodorus, 3.15.3. His Antigone, has a passing reference to the story, saying simply that Phineus' sons, by his first wife, a daughter of Boreas, were stabbed in the eyes with a shuttle, by their stepmother (not named).Gantz, p. 351; Sophocles, Antigone 966-987. However a scholiast on Apollonius of Rhodes' Argonautica says that, in a (now lost) Sophoclean play, the stepmother was named Idaea, and Phineus himself blinded his sons as a result of Idaea's slander.Gantz, p. 351; Scholiast on Apollonius of Rhodes Argonautica 2.178 [= Sophocles fr. 704]. A scholiast on Antigone says that Sophocles in his Tympanistai mentions Eidothea, sister of Cadmus, along with Idaea, daughter of Dardanus, as alternate possibilities for Phineus' second wife.Gantz, p. 351; Scholiast on Sophocles Antigone 981 [= Sophocles fr. 645]. The same scholiast mentions versions of the story (perhaps Sophoclean) where the stepmother blinds the sons (as in Antigone) and imprisons the sons in a tomb,Gantz, p. 351. or accused the sons of rape (and so they are blinded by Phineus as in the scholion to Argonautica).Gantz, p. 352. A scholiast to Homer, Odyssey 12.69, says that according to the Hellenistic mythographer Asclepiades (12F31), Phineus handed his sons over to their stepmother (here named Eurytia) to be killed, after they were slandered (presumably by her).Gantz, p. 352. A second-century BC Cyzicene temple contained a bas-relief depicting the stepsons (here named Polymedes and Clytius) killing their \\"Phrygian stepmother\\" while their mother Cleopatra looks on with delight.Gantz, p. 352; Palatine Anthology, 3.4 (Paton, pp. 152, 153). In the first-century BC account of the Greek historian Diodorus Siculus, the sons were imprisoned, but apparently not blinded.Gantz, p. 352; Diodorus Siculus, 4.43.3-4, 4.44.3-4. According to Diodorus, when the Argonauts landed in Thrace, they found Phineus' sons shut up inside a burial vault, where they had been continually whipped, having been falsely accused of rape by their stepmother Idaea, the daughter of the Scythian king Dardanus.Diodorus Siculus, 4.43.3-4. Rescued by the Argonauts, the sons wanted to torture Idaea to death, but dissuaded by Heracles, they instead sent Idaea back to her father in Scythia, urging him to punish her. And there Idaea was condemned to death. Just as in the scholion to Antigone, the first- or second-century AD mythographer Apollodorus, says that Phineus' second wife Idaea, the daughter of Dardanus, falsely accused her stepsons (here named Plexippus and Pandion) of rape, so Phineus, believing Idaea, blinded his sons.Gantz, p. 352; Apollodorus, 3.15.3. See also Hyginus, Fabulae 19, which simply says that Phineus blinded his two sons by Cleopatra, because of their stepmother's accusations.

Serving between 2005 and 2010, she was the first female and first directly elected leader of the regency. Following the end of her term and failure to run for reelection, she was arrested and convicted of corruption, with her prison sentence expiring in March 2018. Born in Banten, she grew up in East Java and went to university in Bali, where she married I Gede Winasa and began her political career. Following her victory in the 2005 election, her five-year tenure at Banyuwangi generated significant controversy, with multiple large-scale protests and the regency's municipal council making several attempts to remove her from office, and her being designated as a graft suspect during it. Eventually, she failed to run for reelection, and was convicted to five, later nine, years in prison. Background Ratna was born on 6 December 1965 in Banten, then part of West Java, although she largely grew up in East Java. She attended elementary school in Kediri, middle school in Banyuwangi, and high school in Bondowoso, before moving to Denpasar to study economics at the University of National Education. She later graduated with a masters in management from Udayana University and with a doctorate in public administration from Brawijaya University. Family and personal life Ratna's father was a contractor from Bondowoso, and her mother from Banyuwangi. She was the middle children of three. She was married to I Gede Winasa, who was formerly a two-term regent of Jembrana ‚Äì which was located across the Bali Strait from Banyuwangi ‚Äì in 1988, although she divorced him in 2013. The couple had a single daughter. Dutch researcher Henk Schulte Nordholt remarked that they were \\"the first married couple to run two adjacent districts\\". Both were also eventually convicted of corruption in separate cases. Ratna has been described as an abangan Muslim, having never attended pesantren nor participated in Nahdlatul Ulama organizations in her youth despite living in regencies known for strong NU presence, in addition to marrying Gede Winasa who was a Balinese Hindu. Career =Early politics and election= In the 2004 legislative election, Ratna won a seat in Jembrana Regency's municipal council representing PDI-P. A year later, in 2005, partly with support from her husband, she ran as the regent of Banyuwangi in the regency's first direct election. Initially attempting to run with PDI-P, she failed to secure support in the party's January 2005 convention despite support from grassroots members, but ran anyway with the support of 18 political parties (including the Prosperous Justice Party and the National Mandate Party, although the former later withdrew) unrepresented in the municipal council. Running with M Yusuf Nuris (also known as Gus Yus), who was well-connected to local kyai, she secured the support of some PDI-P cadres and supporters of incumbent Samsul Hadi (who failed to run in the election). Her appeal during campaigning was described as \\"feminine\\" and \\"clean\\", and she conducted grassroots campaigning by meeting street vendors and visiting traditional markets. In addition, Ratna also promoted free education and healthcare programs, as her husband applied in Jembrana. Eventually, she managed to win 311,653 votes (39.32%) in the five- candidate race, winning in 21 of the 24 subdistricts. Throughout her campaigning period, Ratna had faced resistance from Muslim ulema leaders, as she had been accused of changing her religion from Hinduism to Islam in order to win the election. She was also accused of blasphemy against Islam by omitting a verse from S≈´rah YƒÅ-Sƒ´n she distributed during the campaigning. Her appointment saw significant protests from the aforementioned groups, with the municipal council initially refusing to swear Ratna into office. She was eventually sworn into office by East Java governor Imam Utomo on 20 October 2005, making her both the first directly elected and first female regent for Banyuwangi. Unlike typical regents, however, she was not sworn in at the municipal council building. =As regent= During her tenure, she faced constant protests and opposition from the municipal council which repeatedly tried to remove her from office or disrupt her. For instance, in May 2006 around 12,000 rallied against her free education program (which made education in public schools free but not madrasa) and occupied the municipal government office, and the municipal council released an ultimatum demanding her resignation. She was not in the office during the demonstrations, but returned to work several days later. Within the five years she was in office, local government revenues more than doubled from Rp 39.5 billion to Rp 87.1 billion. She also approved the extension of a gold mine's permit despite protests from student and environmental groups. In 2007, Ratna decided to oppose a municipal bill which would ban prostitution in the regency, citing that the prostitutes generated major economic activity. She attempted to commercialize the Blimbingsari Airport, but only managed to attract a flight school and not commercial airlines. Ratna also removed the municipal secretary, resulting in a lawsuit. She also fired several state-employed teachers, resulting in a mass protest by other teachers against her. She registered to run for reelection in 2010, picking Pebdy Arisdiawan, head of Golkar's Banyuwangi branch, as running mate. However, the provincial branch of the party supported Abdullah Azwar Anas instead, and removed Pebdy from his post, resulting in the party's support for her being invalid and cancelling her bid for the election. Ratna then sent a letter to governor Soekarwo, requesting a delay in the election proceedings, but her request was rejected. Her tenure ended on 20 October 2010, with her stating that she wished to work as a lecturer afterwards. =Arrest and prison= In 2008, Ratna and previous regent Samsul Hadi was designated as suspects of graft during the construction of Blimbingsari Airport, particularly during its land relinquishment between 2005 and 2007. Ratna was found guilty by the Surabaya District Court on 11 February 2013, which initially sentenced her to 5 years in prison before the sentence was changed to 6 years in May 2013. She appealed to the Supreme Court of Indonesia, but her sentence was instead lifted to 9 years in a decision made on 30 December 2014. She was found to have caused the state a loss of Rp 19.7 billion. Her sentence ‚Äì which was reduced by clemency ‚Äì ended in March 2018.

It was developed adjacent to an earlier dispensary, and was the first British hospital designed with circular wards, and one of the first to have an X-ray department. History In 1783, the Kent Dispensary opened in a house in the Broadway, Deptford. It later (1837) earned royal patronage from Queen Victoria and became the Royal Kent Dispensary. In 1851, this was forced to move to a new building (completed in 1855) nearby in Greenwich High Road. To mark the Dispensary's centenary in 1883, it was decided to build a hospital named after the Revd Canon John Cale Miller (1814-1880), vicar of St Alfege Church, Greenwich and a supporter of the Dispensary. The Miller Memorial Hospital opened in December 1884, with 25 beds. It was the first British hospital to have circular wards - 35 feet (11m) in diameter, so avoiding corners which might harbour stale air and germs (a theory championed by surgeon John Marshall)  designed by architect Keith Downes Young. There were two wards, named Beatrice Ward and John Penn Ward (John Penn and Sons was a prominent local employer). In April 1898, a new temporary out-patients wing was opened by philanthropist John Passmore Edwards, treating 50-60 people per day. In 1908, the Hospital was renamed the Miller General Hospital for South East London. Neighbouring land and properties were purchased, and work on a new extension began in 1911, a foundation stone being laid by William Legge, 6th Earl of Dartmouth. The new William Bucknell Wing was officially opened on 15 November 1912 by Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll, and increased the hospital's bed capacity to 76. The 4-storey building, which cost ¬£23,000, included a purpose-built X-ray department - possibly the first in Britain  located in the basement, expanding on pioneering work started in 1896 by surgeon Thomas More. Following the outbreak of World War I, beds were made available for wounded and sick servicemen. In 1917 the hospital took over a 14-bed convalescent home in Bexhill-on-Sea, which had belonged to the Deptford Medical Mission, and this became the Miller General Hospital Convalescent Home (later, 1931, the Fountain Convalescent Home, and after World War II, requisitioned by the Bexhill Corporation for housing). The Greenwich hospital was further expanded in 1928 with construction of the Robinson Wing, named after John Henry Robinson, then chairman of the hospital, and increasing the hospital's capacity to 151 beds. A new operating theatre was also installed in the Bucknell Wing, and a nurses' home built in Catherine Grove. Seven years later, in 1935, a new 16-bed ward was added to the Robinson Wing, and a new Out-Patients Department was opened in the late 1930s. During World War II, the Hospital joined the Emergency Medical Service, reserving 10 of its 172 beds for civilian or military casualties, and in 1948, it joined the National Health Service, along with St Alfege's Hospital, under the control of the Greenwich and Deptford Hospital Management Committee, part of the South East Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board. In 1965 the hospital was absorbed by Greenwich District Hospital (formerly St Alfege's),Details: Greenwich District Hospital, London, The National Archives. Retrieved: 25 October 2015. becoming the Miller General Wing. However, in need of expensive modernisation, it was closed in 1974. Services were transferred to the District Hospital, and most of the Miller buildings were demolished in 1975. The original Dispensary (a Grade II listed building), the general wing building (also listed Grade II) and nurses' home survive, having been redeveloped by Bellway Homes as residential accommodation.

The creek flows in a southwesterly direction, from the Santa Lucia Range to the Pacific Ocean. It is a major source of water supply for southern San Luis Obispo County. The creek's name is derived from the Spanish for \\"large watercourse\\", and was sometimes called the \\"Roaring Grande\\" in the 19th century due to its propensity for flooding. The city of Arroyo Grande, established in 1867, was named after the stream. Course Arroyo Grande Creek begins in the southern foothills of the Santa Lucia Range, just outside the Los Padres National Forest. It flows west through ranches and farms, and is joined by Saucelito Creek and Phoenix Creek from the left. The creek then flows into Lopez Lake, impounded by Lopez Dam about upstream from the mouth. Wittenberg and Lopez Canyon Creeks both originate in the Los Padres National Forest and flow into the lake from the north. The creek turns southwest below Lopez Dam, where it enters the Arroyo Grande Valley. It flows through Biddle Regional Park and is joined from the left by Tar Springs Creek, just above the city of Arroyo Grande. Los Berros Creek joins from the left just downstream of Arroyo Grande. After flowing through Arroyo Grande and Oceano the creek empties into the Pacific Ocean at Pismo State Beach, just north of the Pismo Dunes. Watershed The Arroyo Grande Creek watershed drains and is located wholly within San Luis Obispo County. Most of the watershed is hilly or mountainous, with wider valleys near the coast used for agriculture. Elevations range from sea level to in the upper reaches of Lopez Canyon. Principal vegetation communities are grassland, buckbrush and chamise chaparral; oak woodland occurs along streams and valleys. The average annual rainfall is . River modifications Lopez Dam was built in 1968 by the San Luis Obispo County Flood Control and Water Conservation District, to provide drinking water for communities in the \\"Five Cities\\" area including the city of Arroyo Grande. Its reservoir, Lopez Lake, can store almost . The annual water yield of is divided with approximately 52 percent going to local water agencies and 48 percent reserved for downstream releases. Lopez Dam is a total barrier to fish migration, and has contributed to the decline of steelhead populations in the creek. Due to chronic flooding, the lower of Arroyo Grande Creek were channelized in 1959. Parts of tributaries, including Tar Springs and Los Berros Creeks, have also been channelized. Floodgates were installed to control water flow between Arroyo Grande Creek and Meadow Creek, a remainder of the once extensive coastal marsh system, in order to protect nearby homes.

History The company was organized in the Spring of 1889A Palace Boat - The Daily Critic - November 22, 1890 and charter in 1890 with the capital largely coming from Washingtonians.\\"Capital's Steamboat Era Ends As Norfolk Line Closes Down\\" - Evening Star - November 28, 1948 - p. A-21 A bill was introduced on January 4, 1890 for incorporation in the Virginia State Senate. The object of the company was to equip and operate a line of steamers for the transport of passengers and freight between Washington, DC and Norfolk, Virginia on the Potomac River. The capital stock was to be no less than $100,000 and an option for a railroad to be built inland was introduced. The Company was to build four first-class powerful steamers with all modern improvements according to the incorporation bill. They would run from Washington, DC to Norfolk with stops in Alexandria at Old Point and Newport News.Washington Steamboat Company - Alexandria Gazette - January 4, 1890 The original Commissioners were Chas. C. Duncanson, John Callahan and Levi Woodbury.The Washington Critic - February 20, 1890 - p. 3 =Early years (1890‚Äì1900)= In 1890, the company started operating with a sidewheeler named the George Leary. It operated from Washington to Norfolk with stops in Alexandria and Old Point Comfort. Two additional boats were specially ordered to run the line at night. Two other boats were to be built if the business need arose to have day trips.Alexandria Gazette - March 6, 1890 These boats would be known as the Washington and the Norfolk. The Washington Its first steamer of the fleet that was to be nicknamed the Potomac Palaces was the Washington. It named after one of the ports being serviced by the company and was launched on November 22, 1890 in Wilmington, Delaware. Manufactured by Harlan and Hollingsworth, it was launched at 9 am on that day in the presence of several members of the company who had traveled to the city for the occasion.The Washington Floats - The Evening Star - November 22, 1890 It was christened by Miss Jane McCoy, aged 12 years old and daughter of Dr. McCoy of Philadelphia. It measured 258 feet in length with a width of 46 feet and a depth of 23 feet. It was made of iron and double-plated from the front to mid-ship at the waterline to allow it to cut through the ice that could form in the area. Six bulk heads divided the ship and offered additional protection in case of a leak occurring in a compartment. It was driven by a screw propeller of 13 1/2 in diameter with triple expansion engines of 2,000 horse power and 14 feet boilers guaranteeing a speed of 17 miles per hour. The saloon deck extended the entire length of the ship. It had forty bedrooms and eight double state-rooms. The interior was decorated and paneled and the main colors were white and gold. The Officer's quarters had a gallery containing twelve bedrooms with an inside stairway connecting it to the saloon. The staterooms and the main stairways were finished in quartered oak while the dining room was made of maple and could accommodate 60 people. The kitchen with its pantry and refrigeration and steward's room were equipped with the latest standard in appliances at the time. The main deck had 22 staterooms, a social hall, a barbershop, bathroom, a purser's office and a baggage room decorated in paneling terra-cotta, butternut and gold. The entire ship was lighted with electricity. A trial trip was conducted on March 12, 1891 on the Delaware River and Bay from Christian's Creek to Ledge Light and back, a distance of eighty miles. Guests including the commissioners, were on board to witness the trial and were served a luncheon by the builders. A speed test was conducted during the run resulting in the boat making a mile in three minutes and seven seconds.The Critic - Evening Edition - March 12, 1891 The steamer arrived at the DC wharf on March 26, 1891 under the command of Captain S. B. Davis who had been navigating the Potomac since 1871.Town talk - The Sunday Herald - March 29, 1891 On September 29, 1890, it was recommended by Captain Rossell that a lease be approved for a wharf located next to the arsenal wall. The steamboat company had made a request a few days earlier to have a landing point in the city. The recommendation called for an annual rent of $2,500 with an allowance of $1,500 for keeping the wharf in working order. It was approved by the Commissioners.Lease of a Wharf Site Recommended - Evening Star September 29, 1890 The Norfolk The Norfolk after it was renamed the Concord The second steamer of the fleet was named the Norfolk after the second port being serviced by the company and was launched on January 10, 1891 at 12:25 in Wilmington and also manufactured by Harlan and Hollingsworth as its sister ship. It was christened by Bessie Callahan, the 18-year-old of John Callahan, one of the company's commissioner. It was built to exactly the same specification as its twin-sister, the Washington.Potomac Palaces - The Critic - January 10, 1890 - Front Page The Washington and the Norfolk were the only ones in Washington, DC able to navigate the Potomac when ice formed. Due to their design, they were able to crush the ice under their weight and make a channel to navigate. On February 7, 1895, while the rest of the boats had to remain docked, the steamboats were able to make the trips on time. Ice was reported to be heavy all the way to Piney Point and fields off Point Lookout.Fears of Flood - The Evening Star - February 7, 1895 - p. 2 The line operated with two boats from 1891 to 1894.

Superintendent Callahan promptly acknowledged the concern and replied that he had ordered the captains to be careful and make sure no damages were done.Local Intelligence - Alexandria Gazette - Evening Edition - September 13, 1894 This prompt response was probably warranted by the upcoming announcement done only two days later. On September 15, 1894, after months of speculation, it was announced by Superintendent John Callahan, that a third steamer was to be built. The route had been a success for the company and the traffic warranted a new addition to the line.

A modern, all-steel day boat was built for the occasion. It was a sidewheeler called the Jamestown and ran the entire summer. It ran again in 1908 but the success was not there. The boat was sold to an Argentine firm. On October 3, 1908 at 1 o'clock in the afternoon, in the Newport News Shipbuilding Company yard, the Southland is launched in front of a crowd of hundreds.Southland Slides Down Ways to Bay - The Washington Times - October 3, 1908 - page 4 In 1909, the new steamer is delivered, followed in 1911 with its sister ship, the Northland. These boats had steel hulls unlike its predecessors who were made of charcoal iron. The Norfolk and the Washington were sold to the Colonial Line where they were renamed the Lexington and Concord. They operated the line between New York and Providence until World War I. 1918 Fire The Newport News after the 1918 fire 1918 was a catastrophic year for the company. On the morning of September 3, 1918, C.B. Abbott, watchman and night clerk for the Norfolk & Washington Steamboat Company was sitting in the office. Around 3:30 am, he smelled smoke and went to the back of the building to investigate. He discovered smoke in the linen room and ran out the building. There flames were shooting up the side of the building. He pulled the alarm and yelled at the watchman on the boat that there was a fire. Within a few minutes, the fire had spread to three or four rooms. Five minutes later, the Newport News as on fire from flames of the warehouse. Explosions were heard on the steamer due to cans of paint in the hold bursting. A consignment of several hundred two-quart and one-gallon tins were on the ship. The fire department was unable to save the boat. A second alarm was turned on within ten minutes as the fire was spreading quickly. By 4 am, four alarms had sounded.The Washington Times - September 2, 1918 - Final Edition - pp. 1‚Äì2 A scow belonging to Portch & Jones, dock builders and pile drivers, was moored to the wharf which was also on fire. Emmett I. Portch, head of the company, climbed over a wooden fence between the street and the river before jumping in a small boat in an attempt to row to the scow to save it. He took a butter barrel sitting on the dock and started throwing water at the fire while trying to untie the scow to move it from the dock. At that very moment, he was hit in the chest by a stream of water from a fire hose, knocking him 20 feet in the water. He was saved by two soldiers standing on another dock who had jumped in a boat to fish him out. He jumped back to the scow and managed to move it way. The fire destroyed $75,000 worth of freight stored in the warehouse and on the steamboat. Among the goods damaged on the steamer were several chasses, two automobiles, two airplane engines, the chassis of an automobile truck, several bed springs and mattresses, thousands of bottles of soda water, 100 sacks of peanuts, fourteen barrels of tar, two marine engines, the chassis of an automobile steam boilers and several tanks of carbonated water. The wharves and office were destroyed which was valued at $25,000. The superstructure of the steamer was damaged to the extent of $100,000. The hull, engine and machinery were unharmed. The passenger service to Norfolk was not interrupted as the company had other steamers. The old Jamestown dock and adjoining offices would be used during the reconstruction. It was rebuilt and renamed the Midland. Two years later, another fire started in the wharf. The steamboat was saved by pulling her out of the channel. She burned again in 1924 and was sold to the Colonial Line. It remained moored near Alexandria for a few years before finally being scrapped.

Captain Posey was in command and had been on the Potomac since the 1890s. The poor visibility due to fog was blamed for the incident with 75 passengers on board and 29 automobiles. The passengers were removed from the boat by the ferry-boat, Lord Baltimore on the following day at 10:15 am and taken to Morgantown, MD. From there, they were taken to Potomac Beach were they were loaded on buses to Norfolk. In the afternoon, a Government tug-boat was attempting to pull the boat out but with no success. High tide was expected to pull it out.Steamer Aground in Potomac Fog: Passengers Safe - The Evening Star - January 8, 1935 - Front Page On April 13, 1941, a scuffle occurred on board the Northland between Raymond F. Reutt, 24, a former football player and wrestler star of the Virginia Military Institute living of Norfolk and the First Officer, Harry B. Murphy. Murphy was thrown over board from the hurricane deck by Reutt and disappeared. The Northland stayed on site for two hours looking for Murphy but was unsuccessful in finding his body. The search for his body continued for several days. Reutt was arrested in Norfolk upon arrival. Since the incident took place in Charles County, Maryland, it was determined that Maryland had jurisdiction. He was arraigned on charges of manslaughter with his bail set at $2,500 pending extradition proceedings to Maryland.Man Held After Mate Of Ship Disappeared Will Fight Extradition - The Evening Star - April 16, 1941 - p.

He had posted a watchman in front of his room but found that the man along with another passenger had climbed on the top deck. Mr. Murphy arrived on the deck a few minutes later and took his right arm to encourage him to go back to his room as he was afraid he might fall overboard. The Captain grabbed the other arm. The defendant snatched his arm away from the Captain and whirled around toward the First Officer. The First Officer went overboard as the deck did not have a railing.Ex- V.M.I Athlete Accused of Murder on Norfolk Steamer - The Evening Star - April 15, 1941 - Front Page The body of Harry B.

They were used in a decoy convoy along with several other ships in the area of St. Johns, Newfoundland on September 21, 1942. They were used to draw German submarines away from another convoy carrying thousands of troops. The Southerland's gun crew is credited with a \\"probable kill\\" a U-boat in the mid- Atlantic. The crew shot 14 rounds out of the 12-pounder to a periscope which had appeared on the starboard quarter. It was followed with a second emerging on the port quarter leading to 18 shells being sot. Only five of the eleven American ships made it to Great Britain, including the two steamers.

A-6 The vessels were used to train British commandos and Royal Marines. The Northland was renamed the Layden as there was already another Northland in the Navy. The steamboats were then used in the Normandy landings of June 6, 1944. The British D-Day planners were looking for vessels able to cross the British Channel to be transport personnel or serve as hospital ships. The District and Maryland men from the 29th Division landing on Omaha Beach recognized the steamboats and wrote about the excitement of seeing these local boats in letters home. While the idea of buying back the boats had been entertained, the state-rooms had been ripped out to make room for the troop hammocks. The cost was to great and they were sold to Chinese interest though it was not clear is the Communist or the Nationalists had them. The company was paid $338,275 by the government for the two steamboats. End of the company Route map of the Norfolk & Washington Steamboat Company and a plan of the S.S. District of Columbia With the Northland and Southland in the war, the company was operating the service with only one steamer by 1945: the District of Columbia. They did not return to the company after the war. In October 1948, the steamer was involved in a crash with a tanker in Hampton Roads. A passenger was killed and several others were injured. A $25,000 lawsuit was filed on December 20, 1948 by the Texas Company accusing the steamboat of going too fast in a foggy area and being outside of the Norfolk channel as the time of the incident.\\"Norfolk & Washington Line Sued in October Collision\\" - The Evening Star - December 21, 1948 On November 26, 1948, after 58 years of service, the Norfolk & Washington Steamboat Company published a legal noticed published in the local newspapers calling for a board of directors meeting recommending the liquidation of the company. The primary reason for this closure had to do with the high cost of equipment replacement. It had $940,000 in Government securities and the physical assets were valued at $269,000 in \\"floating equipment\\" (the District of Columbia), the Norfolk Terminal ($108,000), the Alexandria Wharf ($11,000) and their Maine Avenue office ($26,000).
