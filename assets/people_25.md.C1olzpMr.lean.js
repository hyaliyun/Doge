It was released in 2009 on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Gameplay Damnation features large, open environments where a variety of acrobatics and Hollywood-action stunts are possible. Damnation features verticality which differentiates it from many other games in the genre. Damnation has steam-powered vehicles which are also able to execute various feats of mobility, such as climbing up walls. Plot =Setting= Damnation is set on an alternate version of planet Earth, in the early part of the 20th century after the American Civil War, which had spanned over several decades, where steam engines replace combustion engines. The game sees the protagonists fighting off a rich industrialist who wants to do away with both the Union and Confederacy in one swift movement and turn the United States of America into a country called the \\"American Empire\\" with a totalitarian dictatorship. =Synopsis= Damnation centers around a group of freedom fighters led by Captain Hamilton Rourke in a desperate attempt to protect a war torn, heavily industrialized America from a dictator. During Rourke's adventures, he works with or against a number of characters, including Yakecan, an ally and Indian healer, Jack, a scientist for the enemy, and Professor Winslow, Jack's father. He also works with a shaman named Akahando against the forces of the evil Prescott, an arms dealer bent on the domination of America. The Resistance army is fighting PSI, led by Commander Selina, on a bridge in a deserted city named Arrowtree. Hamilton and his group fight their way through the city to the bridge and destroy it. PSI then uses a specialized tank to bridge the gap with special tracks and continue fighting. As they make their escape the Professor is captured and the rest retreat on to their airship, the Corsair. Then Yakecan's brother Akhahandro tells them that Prescott is raping the earth of its resources to make \\"Serum\\", which makes his soldiers fight harder. The group leaves to rescue the Professor with the help of their new powers that allow them to see enemies before they see them. The group lands in Boom Town where the citizens are crazy on serum. They were miners before Prescott infected their water supply and made them blood thirsty. They fight their way through and meet up with the injured enemy Jack, who happens to be the daughter of the Professor, they take her and he repairs her arm. But she escapes on a plane and the group goes after her but are shot down by Selina's troops. Prescott captures Akahando and forces him to use his powers to see the future. Hamilton fights his way through the rest of the city and finds Selina who attempts to kill them with a turret but Jack comes and helps them fight. They defeat Selina and escape and Jack finds out Prescott's true intentions on domination. Selina survived and rides away with Hamilton going after so he can find his missing love Daydon. He and Jack make it to an ancient ruined site and find Selina and the hooded stranger who turns to be a transformed and tortured Daydon who begs Hamilton to end her life. They fight and Daydon is defeated but Selina escapes. The PSI army attacks Terra Verte. Hamilton makes it to the city where he and his group battles to liberate the city. They battle Selina again which ends with Jack drowning her in a fountain. They activate the city water defense system which opens the water gates and drowns the invading forces in sea water. The group infiltrates Prescott's HQ and the final battle begins. Prescott reveals his powerful weapon, a mech, and fights Hamilton. Hamilton destroys the mech but Prescott lifts the machine up and throws it away after taking a large dose of his own serum. He then tries to kill Hamilton. Hamilton defeats Prescott and his corpse turns to ash. The group saves Akahando and leave in their Airship finally ending Prescott's reign of terror and bringing peace to America. Development The game originally started as an Unreal Tournament 2004 mod, and was entered into Epic Games' first Make Something Unreal contest. It came in second place for best Total Conversion game modification. The retail version retains much of its mod's gameplay, including third-person gameplay, acrobatic moves and spirit vision. A demo was scheduled to be released on the PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Marketplace in early January 2009 but that was never released. The game was delayed numerous times from its original fall 2008 release window, with numerous release dates thereafter being given and then missed before finally being released in May-June 2009. Promotion A console design contest was made available for US residents. Contestants could submit their designs using any available design tool. The prize was a limited edition PlayStation 3 with a steampunk design. Reception Damnation received \\"unfavorable\\" reviews on all platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. IGN reviewer Greg Miller said that the graphics, voice acting, and gunplay are terrible: \\"avoid this game at all costs\\". Andy Hartup wrote in Xbox World that the game was \\"[o]ne of the worst shooters of this generation. The clue really is in the name...\\" Junglist and Bajo, from the Australian gaming show Good Game, said that they enjoyed the environment and exploring but felt the A.I. was overpowered and unintelligent.

It was designed and programmed by Scott Boden, who previously worked on Star Castle. It had a home release for the Vectrex system in 1982. Gameplay The player controls a ship that can rotate to the left and right and thrust forward, similar to the better known Asteroids, and like that game the player also has a \\"hail mary\\" device, hyperspace. In the center of the screen is the sun, which pulls objects into it, in a fashion similar to Spacewar!. The screen wraps at the edges. Waves of enemy spaceships appear in groups of up to eight. There are seven different types of ships, growing smaller to make them harder to hit. Each \\"phase\\" of the gameplay completes when each of the seven waves is destroyed. The spaceships are a collision hazard and normally fly around the screen randomly. As the game progresses, they become more likely to attempt to ram the player directly. At higher levels, the ships gain weapons and attempt to shoot the player. The player's ship is armed with two weapons, a cannon and a \\"nuke\\". The cannon fires a single shot in the direction your ship is pointed, and the game allows up to four shots on screen at once. The nuke destroys all ships in the area when it is triggered, which occurs with a second button press after being launched from the ship. The player's ship starts the game with three nukes and gains a new one every 10000 points. Whenever an alien ship is destroyed, a \\"survivor\\" is left drifting in space. The player can collect the survivors by flying his ship over them. Alternately he can shoot them, or allow them to fall into the sun. The player is awarded with points for successful rescues, and eventually free ships. Development Solar Quest uses the \\"classic\\" monochrome Cinematronics chassis introduced with Space Wars, and used a coloured plastic overlay to produce a yellow sun, blue play field, and red scoring information at the top. The game was originally intended to be based on a true color display, but was released in monochrome..

Puyo is located at an altitude of approximately 950 metres above sea level by the Puyo River, a tributary of the Pastaza River, which eventually leads into the Amazon River. True to its name, derived from the Kichwa word for \\"cloudy\\", the local climate is a wet one and the weather is often overcast.Henry Ades and Melissa Graham, \\"The Rough Guide to Ecuador\\" (3rd edition), Rough Guides publishing, January 2007 Puyo was founded in 1899. Located between Ba√±os, and the Amazonian cities of Tena and Macas, Puyo is the commercial, cultural and political capital of the region. The city is connected by road to Ambato, Tena, and Macas and from there to the major urban areas of Ecuador. In late 2006, the city had approximately 25,000 inhabitants. It was the fastest growing city in Ecuador in 2006. The seasonal changes in the climate are relatively small, and daytime temperature typically range between 18-24 ¬∞C, with sun and generally short, but heavy periods of rain daily. A small airport is located in the small town of Shell, approximately north-west of Puyo. Small aircraft, both private and commercial, depart daily to small airstrips in the Amazon Rainforest, and occasionally to Quito in the case of severe medical emergencies. The Puyo Carnaval, a famous Ecuadorian holiday, is celebrated each year in the days leading up to Lent. The custom is to have small neighbourhood parties, and water fights are sometimes involved. Other major holidays are the Day of the Ecuadorian East Amazon on February 12, and the chonta-palm festival.  History  The main street of Puyo, c. 1900 At the beginning of the nineteenth century the Canelos region was integrated into the territory of the township of Ambato, a jurisdiction established in 1797 within the Presidency of Quito, which at that time was part of the Viceroyalty of New Granada. In 1802 King Carlos IV of Spain issued the decree of erection of the Bishopric of Mainas that should also include the Canelos Mission. This Decree, which was only ecclesiastical in character, was, however, to have unfortunate consequences in subsequent border disputes with Peru. On 23 June 1824 the Senate and House of Representatives of the Republic of Colombia issued a Law on Territorial Division which organized the territory of the Gran Colombia in twelve departments. Each department comprised provinces and cantons. The area belonged to the canton Pastaza Macas of the Province of Chimborazo in Ecuador called Department No. 10. During these years the Ecuadorian \\"East\\" (Oriente) was abandoned by the central powers; the presence of missionaries decreased even stopped several times, traders transited rather sporadically, exploiters of gold and Spices of the region, especially furs, latex and cinnamon. On May 29, 1861, and in the independent Ecuador, the National Convention issued the First Law on Territorial Division that distributed the country in fifteen provinces, one of them, \\"East\\". From then the Amazon territories were identified by that name. However, many Amazonian jurisdictions were still attached to the provinces of the Sierra. The cantons of Coast and Sierra were made up of parishes; those in the East were built also by peoples and territories. Oriente Province consisted of the Napo and Canelos cantons. The Canelos canton included the towns of Canelos, Sarayaku, Lliquino, Andoas and Sapara and Jivaro tribes who formed the missions of Canelos. During the first government of Gabriel Garc√≠a Moreno in 1869, the Vicariate of the Eastern Missions was created and entrusted to the Jesuits. In 1886, during the government of Caama√±o, the Vicariate was divided into four apostolic prefectures, Canelos and Macas being entrusted to the Dominicans. We must consider that the Government of Ecuador invested missionaries with full political and civil authority at that time, an example being Rvdo. Pedro Guerrero and Sosa, who came to Canelos in April 1887, and as well as missionary had the position of Political Head of the canton. On March 27, 1897, by an Act of the National Assembly, signed by President Eloy Alfaro on 14 April of the same year, the \\"Region East\\" was created and with this background the same Eloy Alfaro in 1899, dictates \\"Special Act East\\", giving the region, preferential treatment; but as in the previous law, several Amazonian territories continued belonging to Sierra provinces. At this time the Canelos canton happened to belong to the province of Tungurahua. As is noted in the preceding paragraphs, that the origin of what is now Pastaza, born in Canelos, also refers to a village called Infidels Pastaza that existed since 1775. Canelos rather, over time, was losing its identity with the Canton and Province in the mists of the \\"Legend of the Land of Cinnamon\\"; there is even talk that in Canelos, before the Foundation of Father Sebastian Rosero in 1624, there was an \\"old town\\" called MAUKALLAKTA. From here, the area gradually was taking shape and consolidating as a geographical and administrative space, and when the Pastaza canton was established on November 13, 1911, Canelos unfortunately, was reduced to just a rural parish in the Pastaza canton. The current city of Puyo was founded on 12 May 1899 by the Dominican missionary Alvaro Valladares and nine indigenous Canelos: Captain Eustaquio Palate or Illanes, Ignacio Vargas, Sebastian Illanes, Toribio Santi, and others; who, while looking for a place to stop and rest between Ba√±os and Canelos, found the right place near the Rio Puyo, where today is Central Park. The missionaries built 3 large huts in that place, there they put a wooden cross and celebrated a Mass, entrusting the people to the Virgin Mary, who was dedicated as Our Lady of the Rosary of Pompeii, Puyo . During the first few years, the new village was inhabited by native Indians. Mestizos traders used it as a break on their journeys between Ba√±os and Canelos.  Climate  Puyo experiences an equatorial climate that is a tropical rainforest climate (Af) dominated by the Intertropical Convergence Zone and with no cyclones. Heavy rain falls throughout the year. Due to its high elevation (950 m), Puyo experiences noticeably cooler temperatures than other areas with this type of climate at lower elevations. The average temperature in Puyo is 20.8 ¬∞C. The rainfall here averages 4536 mm.  References  * Puyo - enjoyecuador.net. Accessed 2008-04-03. * Puyo - thebestofecuador.com. Accessed 2008-04-03. * Population Of Puyo. Accessed 2008-04-03.

In early 1778, Edward Worthington left his wife, at Harrod's Town, and joined the Kentucky Militia, as a captain, under Colonel George Rogers Clark. With Clark and his Illinois Regiment, Virginia State Forces, Captain Worthington, went down the Ohio River, accompanied by thirteen, pioneer families, and arrived at Corn Island, now Louisville, Kentucky. At Corn Island, Colonel George Rogers Clark set up his military camp, where he recruited and trained his troops, for the secret campaign, to capture the Illinois Country, from the British. In 1779, Edward Worthington, still serving under Clark, participated in the siege of Vincennes, in which they soundly defeated the British forces. Edward Worthington was granted land, for his military service, as a paymaster, during the Illinois Campaign. That same year, Edward Worthington established Worthington's Fort, four miles (6 km) southeast of Danville, Kentucky.Filson Club. The History Quarterly of the Filson Club.

(pg. 19) In 1780, Worthington was ordered to occupy Chickasaw Bluff, just south of the confluence of the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers and construct Fort Jefferson, to protect American interests in Illinois County, Virginia, from enemy incursions, coming up river, from the Gulf of Mexico. Fort Jefferson would be garrisoned by Virginia soldiers from Worthington's company, of the Illinois Regiment. In 1781, Captain Worthington was ordered by General Clark, to withdraw his company of soldiers, and abandon Fort Jefferson, because of its remote and indefendible location, from continuous, Chickasaw attacks.

He had filed a lawsuit, in New Orleans, against Dan Callaghan, who had swindled him out of a large sum of money in a land fraud scheme. Edward Worthington died from yellow fever before the case was tried, but his family continued the suit and they were awarded judgment against Callaghan according to the court documents in the Minute Book, Louisiana Court of Pleas, 1804.

An early settler of Kentucky, he and George Rogers Clark sought to petition Virginia to allow Kentucky to become a part of the Colony of Virginia at the outset of the American Revolution. He was named in honor of his uncle, the noted Virginian lawyer Gabriel Jones. Biography Born to John Jones and Ann Slade, John Gabriel Jones set out for Kentucky at a young age where he lived for several years and eventually became a prominent lawyer in the region. In June 1776, after a 7-day meeting in Harrod's Town lasting from June 8 to June 15, he and George Rogers Clark were elected by popular vote to represent western Fincastle County as members of the General Assembly of Virginia. Shortly before the two reached Williamsburg however, the state legislature had already adjourned and Jones instead turned back at Richmond to visit the settlements on the Holston River while Clark continued to the capital. On October 8, Jones and Clark were both in attendance at the fall session and they were successfully able to use their influence to have Kentucky constituted as a county of Virginia by reconstituting Fincastle County into Montgomery, Washington and Kentucky counties,Kleber, John E. The Kentucky Encyclopedia. Lexington: University Press of Lexington, 1992. (pg. 495) however they were not recognized as members of the assembly. While in Richmond, Clark visited Governor Patrick Henry and managed to acquire 500 pounds of gunpowder from Virginia which was ordered to be shipped to Pittsburgh. They later helped ship the gunpowder down the Ohio River and hid the cargo 11 miles outside of present-day Maysville, Kentucky. In December, Jones and Colonel John Todd gathered a group of ten men to retrieve the gunpowder. On December 25, as they marched along the Ohio River, they were ambushed near the Lower Blue Lick by a group of warriors led by the Mingo chieftain Pluggy with Jones and several others being killed in the fighting.Waddell, Jos A.

History  The Korg PS-3300 is one of the biggest and rarest analog synthesizers ever made, and it has become one of the most collectable synthesizers. Less than 50 units were produced\\"Korg PS-3300 at Vintagesynth.com\\" Retrieved 2 February 2011\\"Korg PS-3300 at ELP Fansite\\" Retrieved 14 November 2016 (some say as few as 20\\"Korg PS-3300 at Secretlifeofsynthesizers.com\\" Retrieved 17 November 2016) by Korg over a 4-year period from 1977 to 1981 after which it was discontinued. The high production costs of this very complex instrument gave it a price tag that was out of reach for anyone but the wealthiest musicians of the day. It is a much coveted synthesizer by professional musicians and collectors alike as it has a big and unique sound which has been described as an orchestra of synthesizers.\\"Korg PS-3300 at Sonicstate.com\\" Retrieved 14 November 2016 It has attained near mythical status due to its rarity and the fact that it was adopted and revered by many of the artists that were the synthesizer pioneers, such as Vangelis,\\"Korg PS-3300 Gallery at Flickr.com\\" Retrieved 2 February 2011\\"Vangelis: Recording at Nemo Studios article, SoundOnSound.com\\" Retrieved 14 November 2016\\"Vangelis gear list\\" Retrieved 2 February 2011 Jean-Michel Jarre,\\"Jean-Michel Jarre - Concerts In China article\\" Retrieved 2 February 2011\\"Korg PS-3300 at Jarrography\\" Retrieved 2 February 2011 Kraftwerk,\\"Kling Klang: The Electronic Garden article, Aktivitaet-fanzine.com\\" Retrieved 2 February 2011\\"Kraftwerk gear list at KraftwerkFAQ.com\\" Retrieved 2 February 2011 Klaus Schulze\\"Klaus Schulze gear list, Klaus-schulze.com\\" Retrieved 2 February 2011 and Keith Emerson. Even Bob Moog was so impressed with the PS-3300 that after he was given a demonstration of it he is quoted as saying that it was \\"the best synthesizer for fat sounds\\".\\"40 Years Of Korg Gear article, SoundOnSound.com\\" Retrieved 14 November 2016 At its release back in 1977, along with the smaller PS-3100, it was a landmark synthesizer in many respects. It was in fact the world's first fully fledged polyphonic synthesizer where all 48 keys could be played at once and articulated independently of each other. Still to this day, the Korg PS family of synthesizers (PS-3100, PS-3200, PS-3300) remains the only fully polyphonic analog semi-modular synthesizers in existence.  Architecture  The layout of the front panel clearly shows the modular origins of the Korg PS-3300. Oscillators, filters and envelopes are all arranged in vertical narrow strips, much like the front panel of the Moog modular synthesizer with patch points at the bottom of each strip. No patching is required to start playing since all the normal connections have been made internally, this is often referred to as a \\"semi-modular\\" configuration and is easier to use than a conventional modular with unconnected modules. PSU-3301 and PSU-3302 unitsThe Korg PS-3300 is actually three complete synthesizer units in one box where each synthesizer unit is almost identical to the smaller Korg PS-3100 and is labelled as \\"PSU-3301\\" on the front panel (PSU, abbreviation for Polyphonic Synthesizer Unit). The unique feature of 48-note polyphony means that each unit has 48 oscillators, low-pass filters, envelopes and amplifiers, which makes for 144 oscillators, 144 filters, 144 envelopes and 144 amplifiers in total for all three units.\\"PS-3300 at Korg UK Support's Product Archive, Korguksupport.co.uk\\" Retrieved 14 November 2016 Each Oscillator, called \\"Signal Generator\\" by Korg, has 6 waveforms (Triangle, Sawtooth, Wide Rectangle, Narrow Rectangle, Pulse and Pulse Width Modulation), as do the LFOs, called \\"Modulation Generators\\" by Korg, (Triangle, Sawtooth, Ramp, Rectangle, Pink Noise and White Noise). The filters have the usual Frequency Cutoff and Resonance (called \\"Peak\\" by Korg) control knobs and the envelopes have Attack, Decay and Sustain control knobs plus an unconventional Release function which can be controlled by a foot switch acting much like the sustain pedal on a piano. The envelopes and LFOs are notable for their wide range, for example the Attack of the envelope can be several minutes at its most extreme and the LFOs are very fast, extending into the audio range at their maximum rate. An example of an LFO-modulated sound on the Korg PS-3300 can be heard on the tracks \\"Magic Fly\\"Space: \\"Magic Fly\\", YouTube.com Retrieved 16 May 2020 and \\"Fasten Seat Belts\\"Space: \\"Fasten Seat Belt\\", YouTube.com Retrieved 17 November 2016 by the 70s French synthpop pioneers Space 1977 album Magic Fly. Here, they're using the Sawtooth LFO waveform to modulate the Filter Frequency Cutoff to create the fat rhythmic synthesizer backing beat for both tracks, the Korg PS-3300 being clearly distinguishable by its unique oscillator and filter sound. Before the existence of MIDI and software sequencers, this approach was a common method used to create synthesizer beats in the absence of an analog sequencer. Their PS-3300 can also clearly be heard in the intro (and throughout) on the track \\"Just Blue\\"Space: \\"Just Blue\\", YouTube.com Retrieved 17 November 2016 and spotted at 0:18 in the video, played by Didier Marouani. The unique sound of the PS-3300 can also be heard on the Gino Vannelli track \\"Appaloosa\\"Gino Vannelli: \\"Appaloosa\\", YouTube.com Retrieved 6 June 2018 and throughout the 1978 album Brother To Brother. Each of the three PSU-3301 synthesizer units has its own individual audio output and many Control Voltage output and input options for oscillator, filter, envelope and LFO. This semi-modular design provides a vast number of modulation possibilities, being freely patchable by making connections with cables. There's also a Resonator (see below) per unit and two positional crossfade knobs which sets varying Volume and Filter Frequency Cutoff for a synthesizer unit across the keyboard allowing complex layers of sound to be created when all three units are played together. Further amplitude modulation with the LFO as modulation source can be controlled with the Amplitude Modulation knob, enabling constantly evolving sounds as the different layers fade in and out. LFO modulation of oscillator and filter also have their own dedicated intensity control knobs and here lies some of the secret behind the big sound of the Korg PS-3300. The effect of an ensemble of instruments can be created since it is possible to modulate each of the three oscillators and three filters per key with an individual free-running LFO, for a total of six free- running LFO modulation sources in parallel. Jean-Michel Jarre put the big sound of the Korg PS-3300 to use on the 1982 album Les Concerts en Chine (Concerts in China), and later dusted it off for his 2008 Oxygene Live tour.\\"Jean-Michel Jarre Oxygene Live Tour 2008 article, SoundOnSound.com\\" Retrieved 14 November 2016 Another example of the Korg PS-3300's big sound and prowess as an orchestra of synthesizers can be heard on Keith Emerson's soundtrack for the 1981 American action-thriller film NighthawksKeith Emerson: Nighthawks OST, YouTube.com Retrieved 17 November 2016 where the Korg PS-3300 was used for virtually all the synthesized sounds, including synthesized orchestral brass, fat Moog-like bass, synthesized timpani and orchestral string effects. The Korg PS-3300 was also heavily used on the Emerson, Lake & Palmer 1978 album Love Beach, for example on the track \\"Canario\\".Emerson, Lake & Palmer: \\"Canario\\", YouTube.com Retrieved 16 May 2020 Indeed Keith Emerson loved the Korg PS-3300 so much that he became the official endorser for both the Korg PS-3300 and the PS-3100, appearing in Korg product catalogs and on posters. It was a bit of a coup for Korg since Emerson was known to be a big fan of Moog synthesizers, which at the time was the industry leader.  Resonators  A much desired feature of the Korg PS-3300 is its Resonators which is a set of three band-pass filters per PSU-3301 synthesizer unit. The frequency of each of the bands can be set with control knobs on the front panel or modulated with an LFO or an envelope to add animation to the sound and there is also a depth control for the level of resonance. These band-pass filters are in addition to the usual low-pass filters that are common to all analog synthesizers. It is these Resonators that partly gives the Korg PS-3300 its distinct sound and sonic flexibility. For example, large synthesized choir or orchestral type sounds (often referred to as \\"pad\\" sounds) can be made to sound more authentic and richer than those obtained with just a low-pass filter since the Resonators, when static, can be used as formant filters. There is also great scope for phased, spacey and abstract synthesizer sounds by modulating the peak frequencies of the Resonators as previously described to produce sweeping effects, a much favoured technique used by Vangelis, for example on the track \\"Chung Kuo\\"Vangelis: \\"Chung Kuo\\", YouTube.com Retrieved 2 February 2011 from his 1979 album China where white noise was passed through the PS-3300's sweeping Resonators in the intro. Vangelis can be seen playing his Korg PS-3300 in the 1981 \\"Chariots of Fire\\" video,Vangelis: \\"Chariots of Fire\\", YouTube.com Retrieved 16 May 2020 positioned right next to his Yamaha CS-80, both keyboards can be spotted around 1:40 in the video. The Resonators can be heard in all their glory on the Space track \\"Blue Tears\\",Space: \\"Blue Tears\\", YouTube.com Retrieved 2 February 2011 at 1:59 in the track a rich synthesizer bass sound is introduced which gets brighter throughout the track in a very throaty vowel-like way, a signature sound that only could be achieved with the Korg PS-3300 Resonators back in the 70s.  Tuning / musical temperament  The oscillator section of each PSU-3301 synthesizer unit has the usual global tuning knobs; an octave switch with footages 16, 8, 4, 2 and there are separate control knobs for coarse and fine tune as well. However, along the very bottom of the synthesizer unit there is an additional set of individual miniature tuning knobs (labelled \\"Temperament Adjust\\") for each of the twelve notes in the octave, making it possible to tune it to scales other than the Western standard of Equal temperament. This is a completely unique feature for a polyphonic analog synthesizer which allows the Korg PS-3300 to be tuned to exotic scales such as the Byzantine scale or Eastern scales that have a different Musical temperament than Western scales. Three examples of alternative tuning systems are given in the owners manual\\"Korg PS-3300 Owner's Manual, Korganalogue.net\\" Retrieved 2 February 2011 and are as follows: 1) Mean Tone System - This is a scale used for medieval keyboard instruments and features a pure Major third. 2) Just Intonation - Which is a theoretical scale with a pure Major third and fifth in C. 3) Hepatonal Scale - This scale divides one octave into seven equal intervals.  Audio mixer and modulation  On the far right hand side of the front panel there is a fourth unit labelled \\"PSU-3302\\" which is a mixer and modulation section where the three audio channels from the synthesizer units are mixed into a single channel with separate outputs and volume control for line and headphones. There are also three external mixer inputs for effects loops or other sound sources. The mixed level can be modulated by control voltages from an LFO or envelope enabling for example fade-ins while playing the keys. The Modulation part of the PSU-3302 unit comprises an auxiliary envelope with delay and 3 separate outputs which simultaneously outputs the normal CV signal as well as an inverted signal and a voltage offset version of the signal. There is also a Sample & Hold module with its own built-in clock frequency function so no need to sacrifice an LFO, and there are two Control Voltage Processors, as well as inputs for the Korg PS-3010 Polyphonic Keyboard and the Korg PS-3040 Dual Foot Controller.  Keyboard and foot controllers  The Korg PS-3010 Polyphonic Keyboard is a specialised keyboard with its 48 keys (not 49) and proprietary 60-pin connector that connects to the Korg PS-3300 via a special cable, the Korg PS-3001. The keyboard has a trigger mode dial selector switch with 5 different trigger modes as well as a momentary switch for retriggering of envelopes during sustained notes, plus three on/off sliding switches. There is also an X-Y joystick with calibration sliders and separate CV outputs for X and Y direction movements, these can be connected to any of the many CV inputs of the three synthesizer units of the Korg PS-3300 for some advanced modulation control. In fact, if both CV outputs are patched to two of the individual Channel Amplitude CV inputs, it offers an early version of vector synthesis with different sounds fading in and out by moving the joystick. The PS-3040 Dual Foot Controller is basically two CV control pedals with variable range, which also can be connected to any parameter with a CV input, adding greatly to the possibilities for expression. The voltage range is set with knobs on the PSU-3302 panel of the Korg PS-3300 and is part of the Voltage Control Processors. The pedals are made out of heavy duty cast metal and are designed to have the entire foot placed upon it giving the player the kind of precise control one has for example over an organ volume pedal. (Note! This set of pedals is in addition to the Sustain/Release pedal described earlier). There was also a junction box called the Korg PS-3050, which was for controlling up to three Korg PS series synthesizers from one keyboard by routing a PS-3001 cable from the keyboard to the junction box and then routing separate cables from the junction box to the PS synthesizers. The other functionality the PS-3050 junction box added was that octaves could be switched on and off selectively for the PS synthesizers, effectively enabling keyboard splits.

Plot Alex (Shaun Evans) arrives in Sydney. Realizing he has missed his bus, he is reading his travel guide on stone steps in the street, when Taylor (Scott Mechlowicz) suddenly sits near Alex and makes small talk with him, insisting that he come with him. After drinking and raucously horsing around with two unnamed girls, Alex awakens in a city park with Taylor standing over him with a Polaroid camera, snapping a photo of Alex with one of the girls they met that night. When driving out of town in Taylor's vehicle, Alex reveals that he is to be at Byron Bay to meet his girlfriend Sophie (Amelia Warner) and Taylor suggests that they travel together. When Alex and Taylor meet Sophie, she is with Ingrid (Zoe Tuckwell-Smith), a mate. The four of them head towards Katherine Gorge in the Northern Territory. The following day, about to leave, Taylor vaguely mentions that Ingrid had to meet someone and had caught a bus, with Alex and Sophie unbemused. Following that, they move on and while driving hit a kangaroo with their car. This accident causes Alex to receive a major head wound. Sophie and Taylor get him supplies, but Alex refuses to cooperate, citing that they need to leave and get away from Taylor. When they end up at a hotel, Sophie goes to talk to Alex, but his room is empty and he texts her saying, \\"I'm going.\\" Sophie tries to convince Taylor to go look for him, but they end up waiting the night. The next day, they head toward the next town. Taylor says that they should pull over and rest. They spend the night together and in the morning Sophie attempts to text Alex. The phone in Taylor's pocket lights up. The next morning Sophie claims that Ingrid texted her to meet them at Katherine's Gorge. Taylor knows this is not true and begins chasing after Sophie. Sophie, in an attempt to get away, drives the car quickly away. Alex falls out of the boot inside of a sleeping bag, long dead.

Early life and education Ayo Bankole was born in Jos, Nigeria, into a musical family: his father, Theophilus Abiodun Bankole was an organist and Choirmaster at St. Luke's Anglican Church in Jos. His mother was a music instructor for several years at Queen's School, Ede, Osun State, a Federal government high school. Bankole studied in London at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. There he met drama student and poet Brian Edward Hurst and set one of Hurst's poems, \\"Children of the Sun\\", to music; this was performed at the Guildhall School in 1960. He also studied at Clare College, Cambridge and received a Rockefeller Foundation Fellowship to study ethnomusicology at the University of California, Los Angeles. Musical career Bankole returned to Nigeria in 1966 and was appointed Senior Producer in Music at the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation, Lagos, where he worked until 1969, after which he was appointed lecturer in music at the School of African and Asian Studies, University of Lagos. He worked as music educator, composer, choral conductor, performer and musicologist with independent choral groups, including the Choir of Angels (students from three high schools in Lagos: Reagan Memorial, Lagos Anglican Girls Grammar School, and the Methodist Girls High School), Lagos University Musical Society, Nigerian National Musico-Cultural Society, and the Chapel of the Healing Cross Choir, all in Lagos. He wrote much Christian liturgical music in the Yoruba language and his compositions show elements of both traditional Nigerian music and Western classical music. He also composed theme songs for some Nigerian television drama series. Murder In 1976, aged 41, Bankole was brutally murdered with his wife in Lagos by a half-brother.

Education  Carl Toms was born in 1927 at Kirkby-in-Ashfield, Nottinghamshire, England. His parents were both tailors and neither of them entirely approved of Toms' choice to work in the theatre, preferring that he become an architect. Even after he had made his name in the theatre, his mother would still ask when he intended to get \\"proper\\" employment. As a teenager, Toms first studied at the Mansfield College of Art in Mansfield where he met and befriended Alan Tagg, who would also become a notable stage designer. They were both greatly influenced by a young teacher from Yorkshire, Hazel Hemsworth. Toms left Mansfield in the early 1940s to serve in the Royal Ordnance Corps during World War II. After the war, he went to the Royal College of Art where he studied with Cecil Beaton among others. Toms left the Royal College of Art to train under Margaret Harris, George Devine and Michel Saint-Denis at the Old Vic School in the late 1940s. It was Harris, however, who influenced the next major course of his life by introducing Toms to Oliver Messel with whom he would eventually apprentice with from 1952 to 1957. Toms' first job under Messel was to make models for a penthouse suite at the Dorchester Hotel. At the same time Messel was working on a new ballet for the Royal Opera House commissioned to mark the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, and three successive operas at Glyndebourne Festival, all of which Toms assisted on. Messel had a strong interest and passion for French culture which highly influenced his work. As a result, Toms' work became highly influenced by French designers, painters, and musicians as well. Many of the masks and models Toms made during this period are now on display at the Theatre Museum in Covent Garden which display this influence.  Career  After leaving Messel in 1958, Toms worked on the opera Susanna's Secret for the Glyndebourne Festival and for various West End theatre productions. In 1960 he designed the world premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera A Midsummer Night's Dream at the Aldeburgh Festival. He then worked with many English non-profit companies, including the Old Vic and the National Theatre, where he designed sets and costumes for Shakespeare's Love's Labour's Lost, Marlowe's Edward II, Neil Simon's Brighton Beach Memoirs, and The Provok'd Wife for which Toms won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Set Design. He also worked with the Royal Shakespeare Company, where he designed the 1989 production of the Kaufman-Hart comedy The Man Who Came to Dinner and John Osborne's A Patriot for Me. Toms also worked frequently with the English Stage Company. In 1969, Toms was appointed consultant for the Investiture of the Prince of Wales, for which he received the Order of the British Empire. There followed commissions to redecorate several West End theatres including the Theatre Royal, Windsor, and, most notably, the Theatre Royal, Bath, which he restored to its former glory in 1982. In 1970, Toms began to work in the American theatre and won a Tony Award and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Set Design in 1975 for his production design of Sherlock Holmes. During this time, Toms met and befriended Tom Stoppard with whom he would work frequently on plays in both New York and London productions. Toms worked with Stoppard on such plays as Travesties, Night and Day, The Real Thing, Jumpers, and Hapgood among others. Toms' more recent design works included productions of two Edward Albee plays, Three Tall Women (1994) and A Delicate Balance (1997), and the Peter Hall production of An Ideal Husband (1996). In 1990 he took on the task of restoring the Richmond Theatre in Richmond, London, which had been designed by Frank Matcham. Toms also worked on nine films during his career, including the cult classic One Million Years BC, starring Raquel Welch in a fur bikini of Toms' devising; and other cave epics, including Prehistoric Women (1967) and When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth (1970). He also was the production designer for a 1968 film of The Winter's Tale.Playbill News: Carl Toms, British Scenic Designer, is Dead at 72 Toms died of emphysema on 4 August 1999 in Hertfordshire, England, aged 72.

Based in a former tram depot in the Pollokshields area of the South Side, it consists of two performance spaces and two galleries, as well as offering facilities for community and artistic projects. The Hidden Gardens is situated behind Tramway. The new extension to Tramway is the home of the Scottish Ballet, and is claimed to be one of the leading venues of its type in Europe.Glasgow Museums website History The Tramway occupies the former Coplawhill Glasgow Corporation Tramways depot. The original horse tram depot was constructed in 1894, and further workshops were added between 1899 and 1912. It was converted for use as the Glasgow Museum of Transport in 1964, until the museum relocated to Kelvin Hall in 1987. It was first used as a performance venue in 1988, with Peter Brook's The Mahabharata.Contemporary British Theatre, ed. Theordore Shank In 1990, it was a prominent venue as part of the European City of Culture celebrations. It has been protected as a category B listed building since 1990. It has hosted many leading international and Scottish performers and artists, including Robert Lepage, Douglas Gordon and Les Ballets C de la B. As well as having close links to Glasgow School of Art and the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama. Exhibitions have included the seminal new works by Christine Borland and Douglas Gordon. Tramway also has a very successful company for young people called Junction 25, run by Tashi Gore and Jess Thorpe of Glas(s) Performance, who have endured international success as well as having a biannual Edinburgh Festival Fringe run. The group celebrated their tenth anniversary in March 2015. Tramway was also the base for Glas(s) Performance's 2013 project, Albert Drive. In 2003, plans to close the arts centre and convert the building to rehearsal and ancillary space for Scottish Ballet resulted in massive opposition from the arts community and the wider public.The List: Losing Their Tramway Eventually it was decided to house the Ballet facilities in formerly derelict space to the rear of the building, retaining the arts centre in the existing structure. Scottish Ballet has moved into its new home in 2009. Sarah Munro was appointed the first General Manager of Tramway in 2008 and remains in her capacity as part of her role as Director of Glasgow Life. In January 2013, it was announced by Tate that Tramway would host the 2015 Turner Prize.

On his birthday, G√∂th ordered her to play for him and was impressed enough with her performance to spare not only her life but that of her sister as well. She chose to play Chopin's Nocturne in C-sharp minor, and would in later years be known for her interpretations of his pieces. Eventually, she and her sister were sent to Auschwitz, but both survived the war. Her grandson, Mark Lowen, a BBC journalist (and BBC Turkey Correspondent), wrote her story in 2011. He talks of Natalia and ties the story to Jamila Kolonomos of Republic of Macedonia, which lost 98% of its Jewish population. Jamila also survived the war by hiding and then joining Tito's partisan resistance. 18 of her relatives were murdered. Postwar career Following the war, Natalia resumed her musical studies, and married a Polish diplomat named Josef Karpf. After claiming political asylum in London, she went on to give birth to two daughters. Upon dropping the \\"f\\" from her professional name, Karp went on to perform with the Krakow Philharmonic, performed for Oskar Schindler who saved many of the Jews in the Krak√≥w-P≈Çasz√≥w concentration camp, made nine tours of Germany, and continued to perform into her nineties. She would often play with a pink handkerchief on the piano, a handkerchief that she had bought shortly after the war as a symbol of the femininity she felt she had lost during her time in the concentration camps. One of her two daughters, journalist Anne Karpf, wrote a book detailing her parents' experiences in The War After: Living with the Holocaust, which was published in 1996.

Mithridates was the first son of Roman Client Monarchs Aspurgus and Gepaepyris. page 590 His younger brother was prince and future King Cotys I. He was a prince of Greek, Iranian and Roman ancestry. He was the first grandchild and grandson of Bosporan Monarchs Asander and Dynamis and Roman Client Rulers of Thrace, Cotys VIII and Antonia Tryphaena. Through his maternal grandmother Antonia Tryphaena, he was a descendant of Roman triumvir Mark Antony. Tryphaena was the first great granddaughter born to the triumvir. Through Tryphaena, Mithridates was also related to various members of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Through Aspurgus, Mithridates was a descendant of the Greek Macedonian Kings: Antigonus I Monophthalmus, Seleucus I Nicator and Regent, Antipater. These three men served under King Alexander the Great. Mithridates was named in honor of his ancestor King Mithridates VI of Pontus. Mithridates VI was the paternal grandfather, of his paternal grandmother Dynamis. Little is known on the early life of Mithridates. When Aspurgus died in 38, Mithridates had become joint ruler with his mother, Gepaepyris. Sometime before 45, the Roman Emperor Claudius, had given Mithridates the whole Bosporan Kingdom to rule. Claudius recognised and appointed him as the legitimate Bosporan King. In 45 for unknown reasons Claudius, deposed Mithridates from the Bosporan throne and replaced him with his younger brother Cotys I. Claudius had withdrawn the Roman garrison under Aulus Didius Gallus from the Bosporan Kingdom and a few Roman cohorts were left with the Roman Knight Gaius Julius Aquila in the Bosporan. Mithridates despised the situation. He mistrusted Cotys I, Aquila and attempted to regain his throne. Mithridates was able to entice the leaders of the local tribes and deserters into his allies. He was able to seize control of the local tribes and collect an army to declare war on Cotys I and Aquila. When Cotys I and Aquila heard news of this war, they feared that the invasion was imminent. Both men knew they had the support of Claudius. Mithridates with his army, engaged in war with Cotys I's army and Aquila's battalions, in a three-day war, which Cotys I and Aquila won unscathed and triumphant at the Don River. Mithridates knew that resistance was hopeless and considered an appeal to Claudius. Mithridates turned to a local tribesman called Eunones, to help him. Eunones, sent envoys to Rome to Claudius with a letter from Mithridates. In Mithridates‚Äô letter to the Emperor, Mithridates greeted and addressed him with great honor and respect from one ruler to another ruler. Mithridates asked Claudius for a pardon and to be spared from a triumphal procession or capital punishment. Claudius wasn't sure how to punish or deal with Mithridates. Mithridates was captured and brought to Rome as a prisoner. He was displayed as a public figure beside the platform in the Roman Forum along with his guards and his expression remained undoubted. Claudius was impressed with Mithridates‚Äô mercy from his letter and allowed Mithridates to live. He was spared from any capital punishment and was exiled. Mithridates lived as a destitute exiled monarch until his death. He never married nor had children.

He was a solicitor, barrister-at-law and Senior Counsel (SC). He was the son of Peter Kelly JP of Ballyshannon, County Donegal, and of Rose Kelly. Born at Ballyshannon, he was educated at St Vincent's College, Castleknock and at the Royal University, Dublin, where he obtained a M.A. in 1904.Irish Press, 26 September 1944 He later lectured at the Royal University in Modern History and also lectured and examined in Economics at the Royal College of Science, St Stephen's Green.Irish Independent, 26 September 1944 He was called to the bar in 1917, made a Senior Counsel of the Irish Free State in 1930, and became a Bencher of the King's Inns, Dublin in 1937. He specialised particularly in company and local government law. He married Mollie, second daughter of William Hickey of Clontarf. He was first elected as an Irish Parliamentary Party MP at the January 1910 UK general election for the constituency of East Donegal, defeating the Unionist candidate Thomas Harrison by 3,415 votes to 2,202. He was then returned unopposed in the December 1910 UK general election. In the 1918 Irish general election he was the beneficiary of an electoral pact brokered by Cardinal Logue under which eight seats in northern Ireland were allocated either to the Irish Parliamentary Party or to Sinn F√©in and not contested by the other.Dublin Evening Telegraph, 4 December 1918. The seats allocated to the Irish Parliamentary Party were South Down, North East Tyrone, East Donegal and South Armagh. Those allocated to Sinn F√©in were Londonderry City, East Down, North West Tyrone and South Fermanagh. Breakaway candidates broke the pact in all the seats except North West Tyrone, but only in East Down did they obtain a significant vote; here the seat went in consequence to the Unionist. In the election Kelly obtained 7,596 votes to the Unionist's 4,797. An unofficial Sinn F√©in candidate broke the pact but obtained a mere 46 votes. Following the election, Kelly chose not to be a member of the First D√°il but remained active in the UK House of Commons representing East Donegal until his retirement in October 1922 on the establishment of the Irish Free State.

Metagenomics is the analysis of the genomic sequences from a usually uncultured environmental sample. A large term goal of most metagenomics is to inventory and measure the extent and the role of microbial biodiversity in the ecosystem due to discoveries that the diversity of microbial organisms and viral agents in the environment is far greater than previously estimated. Tools that allow the investigation of very large data sets from environmental samples using shotgun sequencing techniques in particular, such as MEGAN, are designed to sample and investigate the unknown biodiversity of environmental samples where more precise techniques with smaller, better known samples, cannot be used. Fragments of DNA from an metagenomics sample, such as ocean waters or soil, are compared against databases of known DNA sequences using BLAST or another sequence comparison tool to assemble the segments into discrete comparable sequences. MEGAN is then used to compare the resulting sequences with gene sequences from GenBank in NCBI. The program was used to investigate the DNA of a mammoth recovered from the Siberian permafrost and Sargasso Sea data set.  Introduction  Metagenomics is the study of genomic content of samples from same habitat, which is designed to determine the role and the extent of species diversity. Targeted or random sequencing are widely used with comparisons against sequence databases. Recent developments in sequencing technology increased the number of metagenomics samples. MEGAN is an easy to use tool for analysing such metagenomics data. First version of MEGAN was released in 2007 and the most recent version is MEGAN6. First version is capable of analysing taxonomic content of a single dataset while the latest version can analyse multiple datasets including new features (query different databases, new algorithm etc.).  MEGAN Pipeline  MEGAN analysis starts with collecting reads from any shotgun platform. Then, the reads are compared with sequence databases using BLAST or similar. Third, MEGAN assigns a taxon ID to processed read results based on NCBI taxonomy which creates a MEGAN file that contains required information for statistical and graphical analysis. Lastly, lowest common ancestor (LCA) algorithm can be run to inspect assignments, to analyze data and to create summaries of data based on different NCBI taxonomy levels. LCA algorithm simply finds the lowest common ancestor of different species.  How to use MEGAN  Latest version of MEGAN can be downloaded here. It is available in Windows, MAC and Unix platforms. The Community edition is open- source and free to use, the Ultimate edition with command-line support is licensed by Computomics. MEGAN can be used to explore taxonomic diversification of the dataset which could be collected from any type of metagenomic project or sequencing platform. In pre-processing step, the set of DNA reads is compared with sequence databases which can be computationally exhaustive and computationally complex for a standard user. MEGAN makes such a task easy and data analyses can be made on a workstation after completing sequence comparison on a computer cluster. In addition to that, functional analysis using SEED, functional analysis using KEGG and functional analysis using COG/EGGNOG is possible. Principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) is also available in the latest version for taxonomy and functional profiles. Comparative visualization options also provides extra functionality to display and present data.

There he studied mainly in the studio of Bertel Thorvaldsen. In 1816, he sculpted an Abandoned Psyche sold to Marchesa Lenzoni of Florence. He was prolific and worked in a chaste neoclassical style into the mid-nineteenth century, specialising in pious subjects. His most prominent commission was for the tomb of Pope Pius VIII in Rome. He completed a colossal statue of St Alfonso de Liguori for the Vatican. He sculpted a St John the Evangelist for the church of San Francesco di Paola in Naples, and of San Benedetto in the Basilica Ostiense. He made numerous busts of officials in the state and church, including Popes Pius VIII, Gregory XVI, and Pius IX. He depicted the Count Esterhazy and his daughter Karoly. He completed a bas-relief for the Monument to Alberto Mattioli, designed by Luigi Poletti, for the church of Sant'Agostino in Rimini.Guida del forestiere nella citt√† di Rimini, by Luigi Tonini, 1864, page 43. He sculpted a bust of Pellegrino Rossi, the ill-fated minister of Pius IX, and of Carlota of Mexico, former empress, and widow of Maximilian. He sculpted a public statue of Simon Bolivar for Plaza de Bolivar in Bogota, and a bronze statue of Ferdinand II of Naples for the city of Messina in Sicily.

William Bryan Jennett (1926-2008). Obituary. Indian J Neurotrauma (IJNT) 2008; 5: 57; http://medind.nic.in/icf/t08/i1/icft08i1p57.pdf was a British neurosurgeon, a faculty member at the University of Glasgow Medical School, and the first full-time chair of neurosurgery in Scotland. He was the co-developer of the assessment tool known as the Glasgow Coma Scale and made advancements in the care of patients with brain injuries. in 1972, Jennett and the neurologist Fred Plum coined the term vegetative state. Early life Jennett was born and raised in Twickenham to Irish and Scottish parents. Jennett was evacuated from Twickenham during the Second World War. He first moved to rural Scotland and later to Southport, Lancashire where he attended King George V Grammar School before training as a doctor at the University of Liverpool. Education and early career Jennett studied at Liverpool Medical School. He finished top of his year and was President of the national British Medical Students Association. Jennett's first mentor in medicine, Henry Cohen, 1st Baron Cohen of Birkenhead, encouraged him toward a career in neurosurgery. He went on to take posts at Oxford, Cardiff and Manchester as well as a spell in the Royal Army Medical Corps. His academic interests were not congruent with the times and he was turned down for promotion in Oxford, Manchester and Dundee. He believed that the NHS at the time placed too much emphasis on patronage and were not supportive of academic interests. He considered a permanent move to America after a one-year Rockefeller Fellowship at UCLA, but was headhunted in 1963 for a new combined NHS/University position in Glasgow. Over the next ten years he became a Professor and moved to a purpose built unit at the Southern General Hospital. Prior to moving to Glasgow, Jennett published work on epilepsy following head injuries. He published Introduction to Neurosurgery in 1964. Later career Jennett set up a prospective computerised data bank to collect the features and outcome of head injuries. Data was compiled from Glasgow, the United States, and the Netherlands over a long period and led to a series of papers in the 1970s, the introduction of the near universally adopted Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) with Graham Teasdale, and the Glasgow Outcome Scale with Bond. In 1972 working with Dr Plum of America, Jennett published The Persistent Vegetative State ‚Äì defining a condition and coining a phrase which remains in widespread use today. His work with the Glasgow-based Neuropathologists Adams and Graham significantly reduced mortality and disability. Many international collaborative studies followed, comparing outcomes after different severity of injury and with alternative therapeutic regimes. In 1976 there was furore over a BBC Panorama Programme which questioned the criteria for the establishment of brain death in potential organ donors. Jennett was in demand as a speaker and in the UK contributed to medical panels and was called to Court as an expert witness, most notably for the Tony Bland case. Jennett was Dean of Medicine at Glasgow in the 1980s. He worked with Barbara Stocking and Chris Ham of the King's Fund to establish a series of Consensus Conferences to deal with the appropriate use of high-cost medical technology. He was President of the International Society for Technology Assessment and in 1984 he published High Technology Medicine: Benefits and Burdens followed a series of BBC talks Doctors, Patients & Responsibilities which were widely praised. In 1988 he developed deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) which he blamed on the cramped seating on an aircraft. Along with colleagues who had similar experiences, he published a short paper in The Lancet. This was the first use of the term \\"economy-class syndrome\\". Jennett retired in 1991. In his later years, he was named Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) and received an honorary doctorate from St Andrews University. His continuing work included a 2002 monograph, The Vegetative State, and his final publication appeared in the British Journal of Neurosurgery in 2008. He died a few weeks after that final publication, having been diagnosed with multiple myeloma five years earlier. His wife Sheila and his three children survived him.

Following Turkey's invasion of Bengal in the 13th century, literature in vernacular Bengali began to take shape. The oldest example of Middle Bengali Literature is believed to be Shreekrishna Kirtana by Boru Chandidas. The Middle Bengali Literature is divided into three periods, named Pre-Chaitanya Era, Chaitanya Era, and Later Middle Age. In the Pre-Chaitanya Era (15th century), the early Vaishnava Poetry or the Vaishnava Padavali by Chandidas and Vidyapati was composed, the first translations of RƒÅmƒÅyana and Bhagavata in Bengali were made, and the tradition of MangalkƒÅvya flourished with Manasa Mangal and Chandi Mangal. In the Chaitanya Era (16th-17th century), the later Vaishnava Poetry and the hagiography of Sri Chaitanya flourishes. In this period, the translation of MahƒÅbhƒÅrata into Bengali grows, and important development in MangalkƒÅvya tradition is seen. In the Later Middle Age, the tradition of Shakta Poetry or Shakta PadƒÅvali grows. The age of Mangalkavya meets its end with the composition of Annadamangal by Bharatchandra Ray. The Baul tradition emerges as an intellectual icon with Lalan Fakir. The most important development is the rapid growth of Eastern Bengal Ballads and Muslim Ghazals are among the most important aspects of this period, particularly the work of poets like Alaol and Daulat Qazi.

The name, given to the snail by malacologist Alan Solem, is the last word in many species dictionaries, just after Zyzzyx; however, they both, in fact, precede Zyzzyzus. They live in the Pacific islands of Palau and Fiji. Description The shell of Zyzzyxdonta alata has apical sculpture typical of the Endodontidae. The postnuclear whorls have widely spaced radial ribs which protrude into hollow, winglike structures at the carinated periphery. There are about 5 whorls that are rather loosely coiled.

The Roman province of Cappadocia on the shore of the Euxine Sea, which Arrian was governor of. The Periplus of the Euxine Sea (, ', modern Greek transliteration ', ) is a periplus or guidebook detailing the destinations visitors encounter when traveling about the shore of the Black Sea. It was written by Arrian of Nicomedia from AD 130-131. Background It is in the form of a letter, from Arrian to the Emperor Hadrian in Rome, who was particularly attached to geographical research and had visited in person a large portion of his extensive dominions. It contains an accurate topographical survey of the coasts of the Euxine (Black Sea), from Trapezus to Byzantium, and was written probably while Arrian held his office of legate of Cappadocia, a short time before war broke out against the Alani; and it was doubtless at the same time that he drew up his instructions for the march of the Roman army against the barbarians, which are found in a short but imperfect fragment annexed to the Techne Taktika, written, as he states himself, in the twentieth year of the reign of the emperor, and containing, after a brief account of former writers on the same subject, a description of the order and arrangement of an army in general.. Its purpose was to inform the emperor of the \\"lay of the land\\" and provide him with necessary information such as the distances between cities and the locations that would provide safe harbor for ships in a storm in the eventuality that Hadrian should mount a military expedition to the region.. The Periplus contains, according to Gibbon's epigrammatic expression in his 42nd chapter, \\"whatever the governor of Cappadocia had seen from Trebizond to Dioscurias; whatever he had heard, from Dioscurias to the Danube; and whatever he knew, from the Danube to Trebizond.\\" Thus, while Arrian gives much information upon the south and east side of the Euxine, in going round the north shore his intervals become greater, and his measurements less precise..

The FSR is not always represented by \\\\Delta u or \\\\Delta\\\\lambda, but instead is sometimes represented by just the letters FSR. The reason is that these different terms often refer to the bandwidth or linewidth of an emitted source respectively.  In general  The free spectral range (FSR) of a cavity in general is given by :\\\\left\\\\Delta\\\\lambda_\\\\text{FSR}\\\\right = \\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{L}\\\\left\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\beta}{\\\\partial \\\\lambda}\\\\right)^{-1} \\\\right or, equivalently, :\\\\left\\\\Delta u_\\\\text{FSR}\\\\right = \\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{L}\\\\left\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\beta}{\\\\partial u}\\\\right)^{-1}\\\\right These expressions can be derived from the resonance condition \\\\Delta \\\\beta L = 2\\\\pi by expanding \\\\Delta \\\\beta in Taylor series. Here, \\\\beta = k_0 n(\\\\lambda) = \\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\lambda}n(\\\\lambda) is the wavevector of the light inside the cavity, k_0 and \\\\lambda are the wavevector and wavelength in vacuum, n is the refractive index of the cavity and L is the length of the cavity (notice that for a standing-wave cavity, L is equal to twice the physical length of the cavity). Given that \\\\left\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\beta}{\\\\partial \\\\lambda}\\\\right) \\\\right = \\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\lambda^2}\\\\left[n(\\\\lambda)-\\\\lambda \\\\frac{\\\\partial n}{\\\\partial \\\\lambda}\\\\right] = \\\\frac{2\\\\pi}{\\\\lambda^2}n_g, the FSR (in wavelength) is given by :\\\\Delta\\\\lambda_\\\\text{FSR} = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda^2}{n_\\\\text{g} L}, being n_\\\\text{g} is the group index of the media within the cavity. or, equivalently, :\\\\Delta u_\\\\text{FSR} = \\\\frac{c}{n_\\\\text{g} L}, where c is the speed of light in vacuum. If the dispersion of the material is negligible, i.e. \\\\frac{\\\\partial n}{\\\\partial \\\\lambda }\\\\approx 0, then the two expressions above reduce to :\\\\Delta\\\\lambda_\\\\text{FSR} \\\\approx \\\\frac{\\\\lambda^2}{n(\\\\lambda) L}, and :\\\\Delta u_\\\\text{FSR} \\\\approx \\\\frac{c}{n(\\\\lambda) L}. A simple intuitive interpretation of the FSR is that it is the inverse of the roundtrip time T_R: :T_R = \\\\frac{n_\\\\text{g} L}{c} = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Delta u_\\\\text{FSR}}. In wavelength, the FSR is given by :\\\\Delta\\\\lambda_\\\\text{FSR} = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda^2}{n_\\\\text{g} L}, where \\\\lambda is the vacuum wavelength of light. For a linear cavity, such as the Fabry-P√©rot interferometer discussed below, L = 2 l, where L is the distance travelled by light in one roundtrip around the closed cavity, and l is the length of the cavity.  Diffraction gratings  The free spectral range of a diffraction grating is the largest wavelength range for a given order that does not overlap the same range in an adjacent order. If the (m + 1)-th order of \\\\lambda and m-th order of (\\\\lambda + \\\\Delta \\\\lambda) lie at the same angle, then :\\\\Delta \\\\lambda = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{m}.  Fabry‚ÄìP√©rot interferometer  In a Fabry‚ÄìP√©rot interferometer or etalon, the wavelength separation between adjacent transmission peaks is called the free spectral range of the etalon and is given by :\\\\Delta\\\\lambda = \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_0^2}{2nl \\\\cos\\\\theta + \\\\lambda_0} \\\\approx \\\\frac{\\\\lambda_0^2}{2nl \\\\cos\\\\theta}, where Œª0 is the central wavelength of the nearest transmission peak, n is the index of refraction of the cavity medium, \\\\theta is the angle of incidence, and l is the thickness of the cavity. More often FSR is quoted in frequency, rather than wavelength units: :\\\\Delta f \\\\approx \\\\frac{c}{2nl \\\\cos\\\\theta}. The transmission of an etalon as a function of wavelength. A high-finesse etalon (red line) shows sharper peaks and lower transmission minima than a low-finesse etalon (blue). The free spectral range is ŒîŒª (shown above the graph). The FSR is related to the full- width half-maximum Œ¥Œª of any one transmission band by a quantity known as the finesse: :\\\\mathcal{F} = \\\\frac{\\\\Delta\\\\lambda}{\\\\delta\\\\lambda} = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2 \\\\arcsin(1/\\\\sqrt F)}, where F = \\\\frac{4R} is the coefficient of finesse, and R is the reflectivity of the mirrors. This is commonly approximated (for R > 0.5) by :\\\\mathcal{F} \\\\approx \\\\frac{\\\\pi \\\\sqrt{F}}{2} = \\\\frac{\\\\pi R^{1/2}}{(1 - R)}.

The system is operated by Vy (formerly NSB) and its subsidiary Vy Gj√∏vikbanen, using Class 69 and Class 72 electric multiple units (EMU). The network spans eight routes and 128 stations, with Oslo Central Station (Oslo S) as the central hub. The trains run on of electrified mainline railway owned by the Norwegian National Rail Administration. Deficits are financed by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications, although the network also has a ticketing cooperation with Ruter, the public transport authority in Oslo and Akershus. The network is the longest commuter rail network in the Nordic countries, and among top ten in Europe. The commuter rail operates mainly within Greater Oslo and two of the lines only provide services within the urban area. Six of the lines span beyond the urban area, reaching the counties of √òstfold, Hedmark, Oppland and Buskerud. The system is also an airport rail link to Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. West of Oslo, the system uses the Drammen, Asker, Spikkestad and S√∏rland lines, north of Oslo it uses the Gj√∏vik Line, east of Oslo it uses the Trunk, Gardermoen and Kongsvinger lines and south of Oslo it follows the √òstfold and Eastern √òstfold lines. The system's predecessors date back to the opening of the Trunk Line in 1854. By 1902, all the routes used by the present commuter rail had been taken into service. Electrification started in 1922, and Class 62 EMUs were introduced in 1931, followed by Class 65 units in 1936 and Class 67 in 1953. Electrification was completed in 1963. In 1980, the Drammen Line was connected to the rest of the system and all trains started operating to the new Oslo S. The high-speed Gardermoen Line opened in 1998. In 2013, new Stadler FLIRT units were taken into traffic, and the Asker Line was completed just before. By 2022, the Follo Line is scheduled to open. Network The Oslo Commuter Rail runs entirely on mainline railways owned and maintained by the Norwegian National Rail Administration. The commuter rail uses ten lines, utilizing a line length of .Bjerke (1994): 33, 37, 51, 58, 156, 182 The lines are all electrified at Bjerke (1994): 13 and consists of 128 stations.

Oslo S is the central hub of the commuter rail. Located in the central business district of Oslo, all lines either terminate at, or run through the station. From Oslo S, there are four main corridors. All trains running through the West Corridor continue along either the North, South or East Corridor. Because there are more services in the latter three, some of these terminate at Oslo S. The line numbers for the commuter and the regional lines are such that those going along the Eastern and Western corridor (beyond Stabekk) have 1 and 10-14, those going along the Southern corridor have 2 and 20-22, and for the Northern corridor 3 and 30. =West= Along the West Corridor, the Drammen Line runs straight into the Oslo Tunnel, which starts directly beneath Oslo S.

Meanwhile, line R11 stops at ten stops in Sande, Holmestrand, Horten, T√∏nsberg, Stokke, Sandefjord, Larvik, Porsgrunn and Skien before terminating at Skien. =East= Commuters boarding a Class 69 unit at L√∏renskog Station Along the East Corridor, Line L1 follows the Trunk Line and makes twelve stops serving suburban areas in Oslo, L√∏renskog and Skedsmo before reaching Lillestr√∏m Station, where the line terminates. For Line L1, Lillestr√∏m is located 29 minutes and from Oslo S.Bjerke (1994): 32 Lines L12, L13, L14, R10 and R11 use the Gardermoen Line and the Romerike Tunnel to run directly to Lillestr√∏m. From there, lines L12, L13, R10 and R11 run along the Trunk Line(L13) and the Gardermoen Line, making four(L13) and no stops, respectively. After Kl√∏fta Station, Line L13 continues along the Trunk Line, making three more stops until terminating at Dal Station. Dal is 34 minutes and from Oslo S.Bjerke (1994): 33 Lines L12, R10 and R11 call at Oslo Airport Station and Eidsvoll Verk Station before terminating at Eidsvoll Station. Eidsvoll is 51 minutes and from Oslo S. Line L14 branches from Lillestr√∏m and operates along the Kongsvinger Line. It calls at thirteen stations and enters Hedmark after √Örnes Station. √Örnes is 53 minutes and from Oslo S.Bjerke (1994): 39 After √Örnes, trains call at another station, Skarnes before reaching Kongsvinger Station, which is 1 hour and 10 minutes, and from Oslo S. A few Swedish inter-city trains to Karlstad and to Stockholm halt at Kongsvinger. =South= Sk√∏yen Station is the terminus for one service Along the South Corridor, four lines follow the √òstfold Line. Line L2 makes 13 stops before terminating at Ski Station, which is 31 minutes and from Oslo S.Bjerke (1994): 50 Line L21 and L22 make only one stop each, at Holmlia and Kolbotn, respectively, before Ski. Southwards, Line L21 follows the Western √òstfold Line with four intermediate stops before Moss, which is 49 minutes and from Oslo S. Line L22 runs along the Eastern √òstfold Line with 11 intermediate stops before Rakkestad Station, which is 1 hour and 5 minutes and from Oslo S.Bjerke (1994): 58 =North= North of Oslo, NSB Gj√∏vikbanen operates along the Gj√∏vik Line. Trains operate either to Hakadal Station or Jaren Station(L3) or Gj√∏vik Station(R30). The lines call at 17(L3) or 16(R30) stations north of Oslo S.Bjerke (1994): 112 Hakadal is 43 minutes and from Oslo S,Bjerke (1994): 114 while Jaren is 1 hour and 25 minutes, and from Oslo S. Service Seven of the lines are operated by the Norwegian State Railways, owned by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications, while the Gj√∏vik Line is operated by the NSB-owned NSB Gj√∏vikbanen. The operating deficit is covered by the state for NSB's lines, while NSB Gj√∏vikbanen's routes are financed by a public service obligation. The trains have two sections, manned and unmanned. Validated ticket-holders can travel in the unmanned section, which have orange doors. Manned sections, with gray doors, have a conductor and allow passengers to purchase tickets. Tickets are available at ticket machines at stations; if bought onboard, there is an additional 20 Norwegian krone (NOK) fee. Class 69D multiple unit Two of the lines, L1 and L2, are designated as providing inner services. These operate along the Drammen Line to Asker, along the Trunk Line to Lillestr√∏m and the √òstfold Line to Ski, stopping at all stations. The six other line, which make up the outer services, only make occasional stops on these sections. The inner services operate with a normal headway of 30 minutes, with 15 minutes offered in one direction during rush hour. In late evening and parts of the weekend, this is further reduced to 60 minutes. NSB's outer routes operate with a normal headway of 60 minutes, with rush-hour services offered at 30-minute intervals and late evening service provided every 120 minutes. Services between √Örnes and Kongsvinger is limited to five daily services, and from Mysen to Rakkestad with four daily services. The Gj√∏vik Line runs with a 40-minute headway, with three different stopping patterns. One calls at all stations until Hakadal, one calls at most stations until Jaren, while one is an express service that runs the line's full length to Gj√∏vik. Within Oslo and Akershus, NSB has an agreement with the public transport authority Ruter to use their fares and ticketing system to ease transfer between the commuter rail and other forms of public transport. Ruter makes use of a zone system, including a single-zone fare within Oslo. From 2010, the contactless ticket system Flexus is being introduced. In Oslo, there is transfer to the Oslo Metro at Oslo S (to Jernbanetorget), at Nationaltheatret and at Grefsen (to Storo). Transfer to the Oslo Tramway is possible from Oslo S, Nationaltheatret, Sk√∏yen and Grefsen. At Moss, there is transfer to the Moss‚ÄìHorten Ferry. Line L12 provides connection to Norway's main international airport, Oslo Airport, Gardermoen. Rolling stock Two Class 69 units at Kongsvinger Station; new livery to the left, old livery to the right NSB Class 69 is a series of 88 two and three-car electric multiple units built by Str√∏mmens V√¶rksted between 1970 and 1993. A motor car has a power output of , allowing a speed of . Each car is long, with motor cars weighing and end cars weighing down to . Typical seating capacity is 96 passengers in the motor cars and 112 passengers in the end cars.Aspenberg (2001): 170 The class was delivered in four versions, named A through D. After the initial delivery of fifteen 69As in 1970 and 1971, twenty 69Bs were delivered in 1974 and 1975. These were designed to operate on longer sections and were equipped with only one door per car. This turned out to extend stopping time too much, and the C and D versions were delivered with two doors per car. From 1975 to 1977, NSB took delivery of fourteen 69Cs and from 1983 to 1993 thirty-nine 69Ds. The latter is distinguishable because of its different front. NSB operates both two- and three-car sets, and up to three units can be run in multiple, allowing NSB to operate any train length from two to nine cars.Aspenberg (2001): 170‚Äì177 Eighty-two units remain in service, although some of those are used on the Bergen Commuter Rail and the Arendal Line. A Class 72 unit at R√∏yken Station NSB Class 72 is a series of 36 four- car electric multiple units built by AnsaldoBreda. The units are permanently coupled together using Jacobs bogies. Each unit has a power output of , allowing a top speed of . The trains are long and weigh , and have seating for 310 passengers and one toilet. The trains have better accessibility than Class 69 and unlike their predecessors are equipped with an electronic public information system. Some of the 36 units are used on the J√¶ren Commuter Rail. 42 new electric multiple units called Class 75 were delivered 2013-2015. Similar units called Class 74 adopted for regional rail were delivered in 2012-2013. =Retired= NSB Class 62 was a series of four multiple units built in 1931 and 1933 by Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk and Norsk Elektrisk & Brown Boveri (NEBB). The units had a power output of , giving a top speed of . The motor cars were built in wood, were long, weighed and seated 73 passengers. They ran mostly on the Drammen Line and were in service around Oslo from 1931 to 1953.Aspenberg (2001): 130‚Äì131 NSB Class 65 and NSB Class 67 were two similar series of electric multiple units, all built by Skabo and NEBB. Class 65 was delivered in three versions, named A through C. Class A and B were rebuilt passenger wagons. Fourteen units of Class 65A were built from 1936 to 1939 and had a wooden body. Thirteen units of Class 65B were delivered in 1941 and 1942 and was built with a steel frame. They were longer than the A-series. Twenty-two Class 65C units were built from 1949 to 1952. From 1949 to 1950, 17 middle and end cars were delivered for the Class 65 units.Aspenberg (2001): 137‚Äì138 Class 67 was a series of 18 units built from 1953 to 1955. They had a slightly more advanced technological system, but were otherwise often run mixed with Class 65 units.Aspenberg (2001): 156 The Class 65 motor cars had a power output of and a top speed of . They were long, weighed and had a seating capacity for 66 passengers. Class 65 remained in service until 1993 and Class 67 until 1995.Aspenberg (2001): 138 Many NSB Class 69 units were taken out from traffic in 2013-2015, replaced by Class 75 units. History Steam locomotive passing over Sandvikselven in the 1880s The first part of what is now the Oslo Commuter Rail was the Trunk Line, which opened on 1 September 1854 between Oslo East Station (Oslo √ò, located at the same place as the current Oslo S), and Eidsvoll. The line was at first private, although it was nationalized in 1926.Bjerke (1994): 31 On 3 October 1862, the Kongsvinger Line opened from Lillestr√∏m to Kongsvinger.Bjerke (1994): 36 The √òstfold Line opened from Oslo √ò to Moss and onwards to Halden on 2 January 1879,Bjerke (1994): 49 followed by the Eastern √òstfold Line from Ski via Mysen to Sarpsborg on 24 November 1882.Bjerke (1994): 56 West of Oslo, the first part of the current commuter rail was the Randsfjord Line (parts of which have since become part of the S√∏rland Line), which opened on 15 November 1866 between Drammen and Vikersund.Bjerke (1994): 155 The S√∏rland Line from Hokksund to Kongsberg opened on 10 November 1871 and connected to the Randsfjord Line.Bjerke (1994): 182 On 7 October 1872, the Drammen Line opened from Oslo West Station (Oslo V) to Drammen. This line, along with the section from Drammen to Kongsberg, were built with narrow gauge and did not connect to the main station of Oslo √ò.Bjerke (1994): 148 The Gj√∏vik Line opened from Grefsen to Jaren on 20 December 1900, and from Oslo √ò to Grefsen and from Jaren to Gj√∏vik on 28 November 1902. Class 62 multiple unit at Skillebekk Station in 1929 In 1903 and 1904, the Trunk Line was upgraded to double track. The section from Drammen to Kongsberg was converted to standard gauge on 1 November 1909. Between 1917 and 1920, dual gauge was laid between Oslo V and Drammen, and from 13 November 1922, the Drammen Line was entirely operated with standard gauge.Bjerke (1994): 149 The first electrification of NSB's lines was put into service on 26 October 1922 on the Drammen Line between Oslo V and Braker√∏ya.Aspenberg (2001): 31 The section from Oslo V to Sandvika was upgraded to double track on 26 November 1922. From 1922, NSB introduced El 1-hauled passenger trains on the Drammen Line, and later other lines.Aspenberg (2001): 46 The next electrification occurred on the Trunk Line from Oslo √ò to Lillestr√∏m on 1 September 1927, the Randsfjord Line from Drammen to Kongsberg on 10 April 1929 and the Drammen Line from Drammen to Braker√∏ya on 6 May 1930. El 5 locomotives were acquired for the Trunk Line.Aspenberg (2001): 58 Electric multiple units were put into service in 1931, with the delivery of four Class 62 units on the route from Oslo V to Sandvika. These proved not to be sufficiently powerful for the large traffic and were later moved to less used services from Oslo V to Asker or Heggedal.Aspenberg (2001): 130 The class remained on the commuter rail service until 1953.Aspenberg (2001): 131 Class 65 multiple unit at Oslo V in 1939 From 1936, NSB took delivery of Class 65 multiple units, replacing El 1 as the primary hauler on the electrified commuter rail network.Aspenberg (2001): 137 Class 65 were the first that were optimized for local traffic, with wide doors and turnable seats.Aspenberg (2001): 141 NSB took delivery of 49 units until 1952, although they were also used outside the commuter rail network. The √òstfold Line was upgraded to double track and put into service in four sections: from Bekkelaget to Ljan on 1 June 1924, from Oslo √ò to Bekkelaget on 15 May 1929, from Ljan to Kolbotn on 15 December 1936 and from Kolbotn to Ski on 14 May 1939. The √òstfold Line was also the next line to be electrified, which opened in sections between 1936 and 1940.Aspenberg (2001): 33 NSB took into use El 8 locomotives on the line.Aspenberg (2001): 68 On 15 June 1953, the Trunk Line from Lillestr√∏m to Eidsvoll took electrification into use.Aspenberg (2001): 37 Further upgrades on the Drammen Line installing double track were put into service on 24 July 1953 from Billingstad to Hvalstad, on 29 November 1955 from Hvalstad to Asker and on 9 November 1958 from Sandvika to Billingstad. Between 1953 and 1955, NSB took delivery of 18 Class 67 multiple units. While visually similar to Class 65, they had improved technology and reliability. On 1 February 1961, the Gj√∏vik Line from Oslo √ò to T√∏yen was put into service with double track and the line from Oslo √ò to Jaren put into service as electrified. Double track from T√∏yen to Grefsen opened on 27 May 1962 and the sections from Jaren to Gj√∏vik was electrified in 1963. NSB Gj√∏vikbanen, here at Nittedal Station, won the bid to operate the Gj√∏vik Line for ten years, starting in 2006. In the 1960s, NSB found the need for a new generation of trains.Aspenberg (2001): 169 Class 69 was built in aluminum and were longer, allowing for more passengers per car. They had a maximum speed of ; this had a significant cost impact, as it allowed not only faster travel time, but allowed the services from Oslo √ò to Lillestr√∏m and Ski to run fast enough to dispense with one third of the previous number of units. Combined with the increased size, NSB could replace three three-car trains with two two-car trains.Aspenberg (2001): 172 At the same time, some smaller stops were terminated to allow faster travel time.Aspenberg (2001): 178 Eighty-eight units were delivered in four series between 1970 and 1993, with later series having a three-car configuration. On 3 June 1973, the long Lier√•sen Tunnel opened, shortening the Drammen Line by . The long section from Asker to Spikkestad was kept as a branch line, and named the Spikkestad Line, while the section from Spikkestad to Braker√∏ya was removed.Aspenberg (1994): 132‚Äì133 Oslo Central Station became the main hub for all commuter trains from 1989. The Oslo Tunnel opened on 30 May 1980, connecting the Drammen Line to Oslo √ò. Initially, only the Lillestr√∏m‚Äì Drammen/Spikkestad lines used the tunnel, in addition to some services from Eidsvoll and √Örnes to Sk√∏yen. At the same time, Oslo √ò was rebuilt to the 19-platform Oslo S, which was put into service on 26 November 1986.Hol√∏s (1990): 153 Oslo V was closed on 27 May 1989.Hol√∏s (1990): 156 In 1993, NSB received a large delivery of middle cars for the majority of the Class 69 units, allowing NSB to operate them as three-car trains.Aspenberg (2001): 177 Between 1992 and 1996, a new, upgraded double track was put into service between Ski and Moss. The section is capable of speeds from . The Gardermoen Line opened as Norway's first high-speed line on 8 October 1998. The line runs parallel to the Trunk Line from Oslo S to Eidsvoll, via Oslo Airport, Gardermoen‚Äîwhich opened the same day. The section from Oslo S to Lillestr√∏m, consisting mainly of the Romerike Tunnel, was delayed because of leaks in the tunnel, and opened on 22 August 1999. In 1997, NSB ordered 36 Class 72 multiple units to supplement and replace existing material.Aspenberg (2001): 189 They were pained green and branded as part of the NSB Puls scheme, which was quickly abandoned. The four-car units were taken into service in 2002. The ministry decided in the early 2000s to make the services on the Gj√∏vik Line subject to public service obligations, as a trial to privatize operation of all passenger train services in Norway. In the tender, NSB's subsidiary, NSB Anbud (since renamed NSB Gj√∏vikbanen) won the ten-year contract, after having underbid Veolia Transport Norge and DSB. Nine Class 69 trains were upgraded and designated 69G and will operate until 2015 on the Gj√∏vik Line. Because of a cabinet change in 2005, the PSO contracting was terminated. On 27 August 2005, the Asker Line opened between Sandvika and Asker, allowing trains to bypass the many local stations at . In 2011, the Asker Line from Lysaker to Sandvika, and a new Lysaker Station opened. This increased the capacity and regularity along the Drammen Line. The opening of four tracks at Lysaker will allow NSB to run all local trains that previously have run to Sk√∏yen all the way to Lysaker. The closed H√∏vik Station will be used to turn trains. The Oslo Tunnel remains the bottleneck west of Oslo, so no more trains can run westwards, although more will be able to continue past Sk√∏yen. Lysaker Station is the eastern terminus of the Asker Line. In 2008, NSB ordered 50 Stadler FLIRT multiple units, to be designated Class 74 and 75, and later 16 more Class 75. 42 of these, class 75, have a commuter train configuration. NSB holds an option for an additional 84 units. The trains have a maximum speed of and a faster acceleration than the older classes. The combination of the Asker Line and more rolling stock allows NSB to operate a more aggressive service after a major restructuring of the lines in 2012. In particular, there are between five and seven-minute headway on the sections between Asker and Lillestr√∏m, and a twenty-minute headway to Oslo Airport and Eidsvoll. Future The next larger railway construction around Oslo is scheduled to be the Follo Line, which will connect Oslo Central Station directly with Ski. The long line is planned to be built nearly entirely in a single tunnel and will allow speeds at . It will allow higher speeds and capacity southwards for the lines to Moss and Rakkestad, as well as regional trains to √òstfold and Sweden. The line is scheduled for completion in 2018. Parliament has passed the Ringerike Line, which would run from Sandvika to H√∏nefoss Station on the Bergen Line. While mainly proposed as a shortening of the Bergen Line, the line would double up as a commuter train line, allowing H√∏nefoss and Ringerike significantly faster public transport to the capital area. The line would be long and allow speeds of . However, no financing has been secured for the project.

Petrus Cunaeus (1586, in Vlissingen - 2 December 1638, in Leiden) was the pen name of the Dutch Christian scholar Peter van der Kun. His book The Hebrew Republic is considered \\"the most powerful statement of republican theory in the early years of the Dutch Republic.\\" Tuck, Richard, Philosophy and government, 1572-1651, Cambridge, 1993, p. 169 Biography Cunaeus enrolled at the University of Leyden at the age of fourteen, where he studied Greek and Hebrew. Following a trip to England in 1603, he returned to Leyden to study theology and jurisprudence. He was introduced to rabbinic studies and Aramaic by Johannes Drusius. In 1612, Cunaeus became a professor of Latin, in 1613 of politics, and in 1615 of jurisprudence, a position he held until his death.Petrus Cunaeus on Theocracy, Jubilee and the Latifundia, by Jonathan R. Ziskind, The Jewish Quarterly Review, New Ser., Vol. 68, No. 4. (Apr., 1978), pp. 235-254. Cunaeus wrote at the peak of Protestant interest in Jewish texts for their political as well as religious authority. He was among the leading Christian scholars of Jewish texts of a generation that included the Frenchman Joseph Scaliger, Hugo Grotius, and Bonaventure Vulcanius in the Netherlands, Johannes Buxtorf, father and son in Germany and; England, John Selden and Daniel Heinsius in England. Cunaeus also corresponded with such contemporary Jewish scholars as Menasseh ben Israel. The Hebrew Republic Cunaeus is best remembered for his book De Republica Hebraeorum (also known as Respublica Hebraeorum and The Hebrew Republic) in which he described the ancient Hebrew kingdom as a model of republican government. The work was highly acclaimed and published in at least seven editions between 1617 and 1700. It was translated into Dutch, French and English.Tuck, Richard, Philosophy and government, 1572-1651, Cambridge, 1993, p. 167Lea Campos Boralevi, Classical Foundational Myths of European Republicanism: The Jewish Commonwealth, in Martin van Gelderen and Quentin Skinner, Republicanism: A Shared European Heritage, Cambridge University Press, 2002 , p. 258 There had already been dozen books and essays by other authors with the same title. ‚Äú Cunaeus‚Äô effort stood apart, for the first time presenting the Israelite state of the First Temple period, and especially the united monarchy under Saul, David, and Solomon, as a practical model for the newly independent United Provinces.‚Äù For Cunaeus the Bible was a legal and juridical model for the functioning of an independent state. For Cunaeus, who was the leading expert of his era on Josephus, Josephus' Jewish Antiquities and Contra Apion, as well as Maimonides' Mishneh Torah, the Talmud, and the Bible together provided information demonstrating that Hebrew State was of a higher order than the Greek or Roman states. ‚ÄúBecause its god was the true God‚Ä¶ the Hebrew state could function as an archetype for the ideal republic. Its laws corresponded to natural law, and its social spirit flowed directly from the divine imperative of justice. This state was neither a monarchy nor an oligarchy nor a democracy, but a republic, whose senate‚Äîthe Sanhedrin‚Äîand magistrates, including judges and priests, enforced and executed divinely ordained laws in ordinary civic situations. ‚Äú Cunaeus's understanding of the Hebrew State as a federal republic directly influenced the formation of the government of the Dutch Republic.Tuck, Richard, Philosophy and government 1572-1651, New York, Cambridge University Press, 1993, pp, 167-169)Lea Campos Boralevi, The Jewish Commonwealth, in Martin van Gelderen and Quentin Skinner, Republicanism: A Shared European Heritage, Cambridge University Press, 2002 , p. 258-60 It was not, however, a republic of the common man that Cunaeus wished for the Dutch, but a republic modeled on an imagined ancient Hebrew republic in which the Sanhedrin was composed of \\"men, not chosen from among the Plebeians, but all most noble, commended by their honourable parentage, and the ancient ornaments of their family.\\" The Hebrew kings, were constitutional monarchs, beholden to the legislature, with the special power of holding power over the religious affairs of the nation. Cunaeus was concerned that the Dutch Republic might fall as Athens and Rome had fallen, as a result of high living and selfish bickering among the leadership. As a model for his nation that would prevent such a calamity, he described a Hebrew republic in which \\"the counsels of all provided for the safety of all; and the Cities, which were many, did not every one aim at its own dominion, but all used their best endeavors to defend the public Liberty.\\"Tuck, Richard, Philosophy and government, 1572-1651, Cambridge, 1993, p. 167; Lea Campos Boralevi, Introduction to Petrus Cunaeus, De Republica Hebraeorum-The Commonwealth of the Hebrews (reprint of the original edition and of the English translation), Florence, 1996, p.XXXVIII- XXXIX The Hebrew Republic, as Cunaeus saw it, was a virtuous community of republican small-hold farmers, kept that way by the Biblical law that every fiftieth (Jubilee) year all land transactions become null with the property returning to the family of the original owner. In this way, \\"all were equally provided for; which is the prime care of good Governours in every common- wealth,\\" a system that insures that \\"the wealth of some might not lead to the oppression of the rest; nor the people change their course, and turn their minds form their innocent labors to any new and strange employment.\\" Tuck, Richard, Philosophy and government, 1572-1651, Cambridge, 1993, p. 168 For Cunaeus, manufacturing and commerce led to moral corruption of all kinds, the collapse of virtuous republican government among them. Virtue was equated with material simplicity, small-hold farmers, and an egalitarian distribution of wealth.Tuck, Richard, Philosophy and government, 1572-1651, Cambridge, 1993, p. 168-9 Cunaeus closed the book with an appeal for tolerance and sympathy towards contemporary Jews.

In the next year, Paglen took part in the Istanbul Biennial, and in 2010 he exhibited at the Vienna Secession. Paglen is featured in the nerd culture documentary, Traceroute (2016). A mid-career survey in 2018‚Äì2019, Trevor Paglen: Sites Unseen, was a traveling exhibition shown at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington DC and Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego. His work is included in various public museum collections, including San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Columbus Museum of Art, among others. Paglen lives and works in New York City. = Experimental Geography = Paglen is credited with coining the term \\"Experimental Geography\\" to describe practices coupling experimental cultural production and art-making with ideas from critical human geography about the production of space, materialism, and praxis. The 2009 book Experimental Geography: Radical Approaches to Landscape, Cartography, and Urbanism is largely inspired by Paglen's work.Nato Thompson interview in The Nation Publications Paglen has published a number of books. Torture Taxi (2006), (co-authored with investigative journalist Adam Clay Thompson) was the first book to comprehensively describe the CIA's extraordinary rendition program. I Could Tell You But Then You Would Have to be Destroyed by Me (2007), is a look at the world of black projects through unit patches and memorabilia created for top-secret programs.Logos offer a guide to secret military programs, International Herald Tribune, April 2, 2008.

Overview The poem describes the poet's idyllic family life with his own three daughters, Alice, Edith, and Anne Allegra:Nelson, Randy F. The Almanac of American Letters. Los Altos, California: William Kaufmann, Inc., 1981: 63. \\"grave Alice, and laughing Allegra, and Edith with golden hair.\\" As the darkness begins to fall, the narrator of the poem (Longfellow himself) is sitting in his study and hears his daughters in the room above. He describes them as an approaching army about to enter through a \\"sudden rush\\" and a \\"sudden raid\\" via unguarded doors. Climbing into his arms, the girls \\"devour\\" their father with kisses, who in turn promises to keep them forever in his heart.The poem uses a lot of metaphors, which makes it lively and interesting. It indeed shows the deep, true love of the father for his daughters. Publication and response \\"The Children's Hour\\" was included in the Birds of Passage section at the end of the 1863 collection Tales of a Wayside Inn.Gale, Robert L. A Henry Wadsworth Longfellow Companion. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2003: 258.

A group portrait of the three Longfellow daughters by Thomas Buchanan Read was widely reproduced and distributed along with the poem.

Longfellow: A Rediscovered Life. Boston: Beacon Press, 2004: 251‚Äì252. . By the early 20th century, \\"The Children's Hour\\" became one of the poems most frequently taught in American schools. In 1924, for example, one study noted it was often taught in grades 3 to 6. Educator R. L. Lyman, who conducted the study, found it problematic, writing that the poem, \\"in vocabulary, allusion and atmosphere,\\" was not an appropriate choice and concluded, \\"'The Children's Hour' is a true poem about children; it is not, as we have assumed, a poem primarily for children.\\"Lyman, R. L. \\"What Poetry Shall We Teach in the Grades?\\" in The Elementary English Review. Vol. 1, No. 4 (June 1924): 149. \\"The Children's Hour\\" has remained one of the most frequently cited favorite American poems. More recently, the poem has been called overly-sentimental, as have many of Longfellow's works. Scholar Richard Ruland, for example, warns that modern readers might find it \\"not only simple and straightforward, but perhaps saccharine overly emotional\\", though he concludes it is a successful poem.Ruland, Richard. \\"Longfellow and the Modern Reader\\", The English Journal. Vol. 55, No. 6 (September 1966): 665. Scholar Matthew Gartner, however, uses the poem as an example of how Longfellow invited his readers into his private home life in New England to refine them and teach them lessons in virtue.Gartner, Matthew. \\"Longfellow's Place: The Poet and Poetry of Craigie House\\" in The New England Quarterly. Vol. 73, No. 1 (March 2000): 33. Poem Between the dark and the daylight, When the night is beginning to lower, Comes a pause in the day's occupations, That is known as the Children's Hour. I hear in the chamber above me The patter of little feet, The sound of a door that is opened, And voices soft and sweet. From my study I see in the lamplight, Descending the broad hall stair, Grave Alice, and laughing Allegra, And Edith with golden hair. A whisper, and then a silence: Yet I know by their merry eyes They are plotting and planning together To take me by surprise. A sudden rush from the stairway, A sudden raid from the hall! By three doors left unguarded They enter my castle wall! They climb up into my turret O'er the arms and back of my chair; If I try to escape, they surround me; They seem to be everywhere. They almost devour me with kisses, Their arms about me entwine, Till I think of the Bishop of Bingen In his Mouse-Tower on the Rhine! Do you think, o blue-eyed banditti, Because you have scaled the wall, Such an old mustache as I am Is not a match for you all! I have you fast in my fortress, And will not let you depart, But put you down into the dungeon In the round-tower of my heart. And there will I keep you forever, Yes, forever and a day, Till the walls shall crumble to ruin, And moulder in dust away!Maine Historical Society Website In other media \\"The Children's Hour\\" was set by Charles Ives and published as number 74 in his 114 Songs collection.

He first appears in the records already established as Abbot of Kilwinning in 1296, disappearing for a decade before re-emerging as Chancellor of Scotland then Abbot of Arbroath. A senior figure in the administration of Scotland during the 1310s and 1320s, he is widely said by modern writers to have drafted the Declaration of Arbroath, and although there is no direct evidence for this, he nevertheless probably played a role. By early 1328, his service to the king had earned him a bishopric - the bishopric of the Isles - a position he held for three or four years before his death in 1331. Abbot of Kilwinning Kilwinning Abbey as it stands today. The name \\"Bernard abbe de Kilwynin\\" (abbot of Kilwinning) occurs on the Ragman Rolls, 28 August 1296, and he is recorded again in a document of Melrose Abbey on 25 December.Watt & Shead, Heads of Religious Houses, p. 127. Bernard is unrecorded as abbot of Kilwinning after this year, but it is possible that he was ejected from Kilwinning Abbey by the English king in one of the following years, probably retiring to another Tironensian monastery, Arbroath Abbey.Duncan, \\"Bernard (d. 1330/31)\\"; Watt & Shead, Heads of Religious Houses, p. 127. A document dated 1296 x 1305, names one otherwise unknown Roger as Abbot of Kilwinning, meaning that Bernard had ceased to hold this position by 1305 at the latest. Although once regarded as a historical dead-end, it is now established that this Bernard was the same Tironensian who was later Chancellor of Scotland, Abbot of Arbroath and Bishop of the Isles. Since 1726, Bernard had been erroneously identified with Bernard de Linton, parson of Mordington, a name which occurs only in the Ragman Rolls. Professor A. A. M. Duncan first argued that Bernard of Arbroath was the same as Bernard of Kilwinning, rather than Bernard de Linton, in 1988,Duncan, Acts, pp. 198-203. and has since been accepted by other historians.Barrow, Robert Bruce, p. 362, n. 59; Watt & Murray, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 262; Watt & Shead, Heads of Religious Houses, pp. 5, 127. Chancellor of Scotland & Abbot of Arbroath A modern photograph of Arbroath Abbey, showing distinctive sandstone colouring. From 1308, Bernard appears in the charters of Robert I, King of the Scots, as \\"Dom Bernard the Chancellor\\".Dowden, Bishops, p. 282, n. 1; Duncan, \\"Bernard (d. 1330/31)\\". It was in 1308 that Robert finally got full control over the province of Angus, where Arbroath Abbey is located.Duncan, \\"Bernard (d. 1330/31)\\". The Abbot of Arbroath at the time, John de Angus, appears to have been an English appointee, and was subsequently ejected from office.Duncan, \\"Bernard (d. 1330/31)\\"; Watt & Shead, Medieval Religious Houses, p. 5. On 1 November 1309, John de Angus was \\"released\\" from the responsibility of his office by the Bishop of St Andrews, though he retained Haltwhistle as rector, a parish church in Tynedale, Northumberland, which belonged to the abbey.Watt & Shead, Medieval Religious Houses, p. 5. Bernard was elected as the new abbot sometime in 1310, probably by August. John de Angus continued to be styled \\"Abbot of Arbroath\\" in English sources, though he became a Scottish prisoner in 1312 and was holding Haltwhistle from the Bishop of Durham by 1313. After his blessing as abbot, Bernard traveled to the Kingdom of Norway to negotiate an agreement with the Norwegian king. He returned in February 1312, and on 29 October 1312 Norwegian ambassadors met King Robert at Inverness in royal Moray, and agreed to the Treaty of Inverness. The treaty involved a renewal of the Treaty of Perth, and resolution of earlier tit-for-tat acts of hostility against each other, like the seizing of goods from Scottish merchants in Norway and the kidnapping by the Scots of the Steward of Orkney.Barrow, Robert Bruce, p. 201. The fifteenth-century Lowland Scottish chronicler Walter Bower attributed to Abbot Bernard a poem in Latin about the Battle of Bannockburn, from which Bower quoted many lines.Shead et al., Scotichronicon, pp. 360-5. It may however have come from another Arbroath monk, as Bower appears to hint elsewhere. Bernard has been widely credited since the eighteenth century as the author of the Declaration of Arbroath, a document from his period as Abbot of Arbroath.Barrow, Robert Bruce, p. 308; Duncan, \\"Bernard (d. 1330/31)\\". Professor A. A. M. Duncan doubts this however, arguing that \\"the skilled use of the papal cursus in that text points rather to a professional rhetorician\\". Professor G. W. S. Barrow thought that Alexander de Kininmund (Kinninmonth) was a more likely candidate, on similar reasoning to Duncan.Barrow, Robert Bruce, p. 308. Bernard's name was certainly on the Declaration of Arbroath, and as chancellor he certainly had some role. He held this administrative office throughout his time as Abbot of Arbroath, until his election as Bishop of the Isles by 1328. He would have had a significant role in royal government and the issue of charters, and many royal acts are dated by Bernard's whereabouts. His role as chancellor appears to have been used for the benefit of his abbey with nine of the sixteen royal charters extant from the period 1312-3 having the abbey as the beneficiary. Bishop of the Isles The years of service offered by Bernard were rewarded in the winter of 1327/8, when he was advanced to the bishopric of the Isles, a bishopric King Robert had reserved for his own patronage back in 1324.Watt & Murray, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 262. This election likely occurred between 9 November 1327 and 14 January 1328.Watt & Murray, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 262; the former date is the date of the last document in which Bernard is styled simply \\"abbot\\" and the latter date is the date of the first document in which he was styled \\"bishop-elect\\". The office of chancellor, and the accompanying salary of 200 marks, was resigned by Bernard later in the year, probably on 3 April 1328. King Robert assigned Bernard ¬£100 towards the expenses of his election, and was granted the grain tithes from the lands of the church of Abernethy, for seven years, to complement the meagre income of the diocese of the Isles.Dowden, Bishops, p. 281. He was consecrated between 26 June and 12 November 1328, perhaps in Norway, where the see's metropolitan, the Archbishop of Trondheim, resided.Dowden, Bishops, p. 282; Watt & Murray, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 262. Bernard's election was not straightforward, as some the \\"canons of Snizort\\", the seat of the diocese, had elected a different successor, Cormac Cormacii. Cormac's representatives were in Bergen in July 1331, and persuaded the Archbishop of Trondheim to order an examination of the election. They were ultimately unsuccessful, as no confirmation is attested. Despite this success, Bernard's episcopate was not long-lasting, as he had died by 10 June 1331. Although the last notice of Bernard in any contemporary document dates to 1328, it is very likely he died in 1331, as the Chronicles of Mann said he was bishop during four different years.Munch & Goss, Chronica regum Manniae, vol. i ; Watt & Murray, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 262 The Chronicles of Mann further notes that he was buried at Kilwinning Abbey, his original monastery and the location where he first rose through the ranks.Munch & Goss, Chronica regum Manniae, vol. i .

Russell and his wife Nancy, Russell attended Normal College, Merchiston Castle School, Scotland, and the South African College, Cape Town. At the South African College he obtained a double degree in Arts and Science and was awarded the Ebden Scholarship to study overseas for three years.

The machine is custom-made to solve small but extremely demanding problems in the fields of quantum physics.  Overview  The computers were designed and built jointly by University of Edinburgh (UKQCD), Columbia University, the RIKEN BNL Brookhaven Research Center and IBM.RIKEN BNL Research Center Dedicates New Supercomputer for Physics Research The purpose of the collaboration was to exploit computing facilities for lattice field theory calculations whose primary aim is to increase the predictive power of the Standard Model of elementary particle interactions through numerical simulation of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The target was to build a massively parallel supercomputer able to peak at 10 Tflops with sustained power at 50% capacity. There are three QCDOCs in service each reaching 10 Tflops peak operation. * University of Edinburgh's Parallel Computing Centre (EPCC). In operation by the UKQCD since 2005 * RIKEN BNL Brookhaven Research Center at Brookhaven National Laboratory * U.S. Department of Energy Program in High Energy and Nuclear Physics at Brookhaven National Laboratory Around 23 UK academic staff, their postdocs and students, from seven universities, belong to UKQCD. Costs were funded through a Joint Infrastructure Fund Award of ¬£6.6 million. Staff costs (system support, physicist programmers and postdocs) are around ¬£1 million per year, other computing and operating costs are around ¬£0.2 million per year.http://www.scitech.ac.uk/roadmap/rmProject.aspx?q=82 QCDOC was to replace an earlier design, QCDSP, where the power came from connecting large amounts of DSPs together in a similar fashion. The QCDSP strapped 12.288 nodes to a 4D network and reached 1 Tflops in 1998. QCDOC can be seen as a predecessor to the highly successful Blue Gene/L supercomputer. They share a lot of design traits, and similarities go beyond superficial characteristics. Blue Gene is also a massively parallel supercomputer built with a large amount of cheap, relatively weak PowerPC 440 based SoC nodes connected with a high bandwidth multidimensional mesh. They differ, however, in that the computing nodes in BG/L are more powerful and are connected with a faster, more sophisticated network that scales up to several hundred thousand nodes per system.  Architecture  Logic schematic of the QCDOC ASIC = Computing node = The computing nodes are custom ASICs with about fifty million transistors each. They are mainly made up of existing building blocks from IBM. They are built around a 500 MHz PowerPC 440 core with 4 MB DRAM, memory management for external DDR SDRAM, system I/O for internode communications, and dual Ethernet built in. The computing node is capable of 1 double precision Gflops. Each node has one DIMM socket capable of holding between 128 and 2048 MB of 333 MHz ECC DDR SDRAM. = Inter node communication = Each node has the capability to send and receive data from each of its twelve nearest neighbors in a six- dimensional mesh at a rate of 500 Mbit/s each. This provides a total off-node bandwidth of 12 Gbit/s. Each of these 24 channels has DMA to the other nodes' on-chip DRAM or the external SDRAM. In practice only four dimensions will be used to form a communications sub-torus where the remaining two dimensions will be used to partition the system. The operating system communicates with the computing nodes using the Ethernet network. This is also used for diagnostics, configuration and communications with disk storage. = Mechanical design = Two nodes are placed together on a daughter card with one DIMM socket and a 4:1 Ethernet hub for off-card communications. The daughter cards have two connectors, one carrying the internode communications network and one carrying power, Ethernet, clock and other house keeping facilities. Thirty-two daughter cards are placed in two rows on a motherboard that supports 800 Mbit/s off-board Ethernet communications. Eight motherboards are placed in crates with two backplanes supporting four motherboards each. Each crate consists of 512 processor nodes a and a 26 hypercube communications network. One node consumes about 5 W of power, and each crate is air and water cooled. A complete system can consist of any number of crates, for a total of up to several tens of thousands of nodes. = Operating system = The QCDOC runs a custom-built operating system, QOS, which facilitates boot, runtime, monitoring, diagnostics, and performance and simplifies management of the large number of computing nodes. It uses a custom embedded kernel and provides single process POSIX (\\"unix-like\\") compatibility using the Cygnus newlib library. The kernel includes a specially written UDP/IP stack and NFS client for disk access. The operating system also maintains system partitions so several users can have access to separate parts of the system for different applications. Each partition will only run one client application at any given time. Any multitasking is scheduled by the host controller system which is a regular computer using a large amounts of Ethernet ports connecting to the QCDOC.

Many of the mills survive today as house conversions, with two of them still working commercially. Upper Great Stour The upper reaches of the Great Stour powered eight watermills, with a further two on tributaries. =Bayton Mill, Lenham= TQ 903 503 This corn mill in Lenham is the only one that was powered by the Upper Great Stour, the other watermills in Lenham were powered by the River Len. The mill building has been converted to residential use, devoid of machinery. It had a breast shot waterwheel.Spain (1986), p21-22 =Bowley Mill, Boughton Malherbe= TQ 902 496 This corn mill in Boughton Malherbe is now a derelict ruin, with the remains of the ground floor, waterwheel and some machinery remaining. The waterwheel was overshot, some diameter and wide, carried on a diameter cast-iron axle. The Pit Wheel is of cast iron, and had 96 cogs. The Upright Shaft was wood, as was the clasp arm Great Spur Wheel, which drove three pairs of millstones.Spain (1986), p23-24 The mill building was by in plan, and new machinery was installed in 1881. The upper floors of the mill were pulled down in the 1960s as they had become unsafe. =Burnt Mill, Charing= TQ 913 492 This corn mill at Charing still remains in a derelict condition, with most of its machinery intact. The mill was working until the mid-1950s. The cast-iron waterwheel was diameter and wide, on a cast-iron axle. It bears the legend J HILL, ASHFORD, 1863. The pit wheel is diameter with 80 cogs, driving a cast-iron Wallower carried on the upright shaft and driving a diameter Great Spur Wheel which drove three pairs of millstones. A Crown Wheel drove two lineshafts.Spain (1986), p27-33 The mill was run by the Tanton family for many years. A John Tanton was the miller in 1764, and another John Tanton died in 1837 aged 72. =Field Mill, Charing= TQ 915 483 This corn mill at Charing still stands, retaining a little machinery. The overshot waterwheel was diameter and wide. It bears the legend HILL & SON ASHFORD 1877. The waterwheel is carried on a cast-iron axle, driving a cast-iron Pit Wheel. All other machinery has been removed. The mill had two pairs of millstones.Spain (1986), p59-61 Millers were a Mr Pay and Mr Pope from 1878 - 1892,Possibly at Field windmill and Walter Hicks in 1892, having previously been at the windmill. =Swallow Mill, Little Chart= TQ 934 469 This corn mill at Little Chart had an internal waterwheel. The millers in the 1850s and 1860s were the Large family. = Ford Mill, Little Chart = TQ 943 459 This was a paper mill. It was in use as a paper mill as early as 1776 and took its name from the ford which was near the mill. This was replaced by a bridge in 1836. George Langley ran the mill from the 1840s until 1876. The mill was owned by the Dering Estate at Pluckley. The overshot waterwheel was replaced by a turbine. In 1941, the mill was switched to the manufacture of flong for the Daily Express newspaper. Changing economic conditions meant that flong manufacture ceased in 1986. =Worten Mill, Godinton= TQ 970 435 The mill at Godinton was a corn mill. The building survives, converted to residential use. This is one of the oldest mills in Kent recorded in a charter in 762. The waterwheel although in a poor state of repair is still in the building. =Buxford Mill, Great Chart= TQ 989 426 Buxford Mill ceased operating as a corn mill after the war and was changed to residential use before several attempts at making it a restaurant and hotel failed. The house was derelict for some time before it ultimately settled as a domestic residence. The house now standing was built in 1600 with numerous additions but the waterwheel and all mill workings have now gone. There is still a waterfall and sluice adjacent to the house but old maps suggest that the wheel was located inside the current granary and there is evidence of an outflow emerging from underneath the building, that has now been largely filled in. It is likely that the wheel was either breast-shot or under-shot given the relatively small fall of approximately 6 feet. =Tributaries of the Upper Great Stour= Hothfield (Potters Corner) Mill TQ 989 450 The corn mill to the north of Hothfield still retains most of its machinery. It stood on a stream which feeds into the Great Stour. The cast-iron overshot waterwheel is diameter and wide, carried on a square cast-iron axle, driving a cast-iron Pit Wheel with 88 cogs.

There was a twin cylinder self-condensing steam engine by Hall's of Dartford, built in 1840 which provided auxiliary power. This was dismantled and donated to the Newcomen Society in 1920. The original intention was that this would be displayed in the Science Museum, but it later passed to the Henry Ford Museum in America.Spain (1986), p120-28 =Sevington Mill, Willesborough= TR 032 415 Sevington mill was a corn mill which had two overshot wheels driving a total of five pairs of millstones.

It is the largest city in the Coastal Karnataka region, and is the only city in Karnataka and one among the six cities in India to have an International Airport, a Major Seaport, railway & road connectivities. It is the second prominent city of Karnataka after the state capital Bangalore in all aspects. It is one of the fastest developing cities in India. Local public transport A typical Mangalore Autorickshaw Even though Mangalore's city bus service is dominated by private operators such as DKBOA, with routes covering the full extent of the city and beyond, in recent days Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation is plying buses in multiple routes. There are two distinct sets of routes for the buses, with the city routes being covered by city buses, and the intercity routes being covered by service and express buses. There are also KSRTC JnNurm green colour city buses from State Bank bus stand. These buses travel to different parts of the city and its suburbs. Service buses essentially touch some towns and villages on the intercity route. Service are run to various location like Udupi, Karkala and Kateel. However the frequency of service buses are extremely low. Express buses reach their destination with very limited stops in between. A list of bus routes inside Mangalore can be found here. Another mode for local transportation is the autorickshaw. The minimum cost charged by an autorickshaw up to 2 km is Rs 25. Meters are introduced in all autorickshaws plying inside the city and the suburbs. But most of the rickshaw drivers does not charge according to meter. However charges are 1.5 times the displayed reading between 10 pm and 5 am. Taxi services in Mangalore are provided by Ola Cabs and Uber, whose services extend to the Mangalore International Airport. Motorcycle rental providers have also begun offering transport services in the city.  Long distance bus routes  Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) runs the long distance bus services from Mangalore to other parts of the state. The Mangalore-Bangalore route is the most lucrative route and is equally served by public & private players. The longest bus route served is the Mangalore - Ankola- Hubli- Belgaum- Pune- Mumbai bus route run by a number of private players and KSRTC. The journey is about 22 hours by normal buses & 16 hours by Volvo Buses. Many private companies based out of Mangalore, Udupi, Bangalore also ply multiple buses between Mangalore and other cities on daily basis. SRS Travels, Ideal Travels, Sugama Tourists, Durgamba Motors, VRL being the popular operators. These operators provide services in different categories such as A/C Volvo Bus, Sleeper, Seater etc. There will be a huge hike in number of passengers during the festive seasons such as Mangalore Dasara, Diwali, Ganesh Chaturthi, Christmas which will also result in hike in bus fares unlike the KSRTC buses.

Railways Mangalore Junction railway station Mangalore has 3 railway stations - Mangalore Central, Mangalore Junction & Surathkal railway station. A metre gauge railway track was built through the Western Ghats in the east, connecting Mangalore with Hassan. The broad gauge track connecting Mangalore to Bangalore via Hassan is open for freight traffic since May 2006. While the movement of passenger traffic was supposed to start after December 2006, the inaugural train was eventually flagged off from Mangalore Central railway station for Bangalore only on 8 December 2007 by Union Minister for Railways Laloo Prasad Yadav. When India gained independence, Mangalore was not connected to Mumbai by rail. The railway network established before independence terminated at Mangalore. Since then there had been a strong need to connect Mangalore to Mumbai and hence the Konkan Railway came into being. The project was completed in 1998 and since then the travel time to the north of the country has come down considerably and provides a convenient alternative for passengers. Mangalore has direct trains to Chennai, Trivandrum, Kochi, Kollam(Quilon), Coimbatore, Hyderabad, Puducherry,((Thane))Nagercoil through the Southern Railway and to Mumbai, Bhatkal, Karwar and Goa via the Konkan Railway.

The club is affiliated with Cork GAA county board and the Muskerry divisional board. History √âire √ìg Hurling and Football club (Cumann Iom√°na√≠ochta agus Peile √âire √ìg) is located in the parish of Ovens/Farran approximately 10 miles west of Cork city, just off the main Cork-Killarney road. Gaelic Games were played in the parish of Ovens and Farran dating back to the period immediately after the foundation of the G.A.A. in 1884. √âire √ìg's predecessor, Bride Valley, named after the River Bride which flows through the parish, affiliated in 1890, fielding teams in both hurling and football. Following the establishment of the Divisional Boards in the mid-1920s, Bride Valley won the first two Muskerry Junior Hurling Championship in 1925 & 1926 before the √âire √ìg club was formed, with players from Cloughduv and two from Knockavilla joining forces with the Ovens and Farran based contingent in 1928. The newly formed √âire √ìg team entered the senior ranks in their inaugural campaign, winning the 1928 Senior Hurling Championship defeating Mallow in the final on a scoreline of 5‚Äì2 to 3‚Äì2. Early successes in hurling were followed by a fallow period during the late 1930s and 1940s, when the club went into decline. Thanks to the efforts of men such as the late John Lyons, John Crean, Tom Murphy, Tim Lane, Jimmy O‚ÄôBrien, Nicholas Irwin, Teddy O‚ÄôLeary, Denny O‚ÄôSullivan and the Rev. Fr. Se√°n Murphy, √âire √ìg survived the barren spell and began the journey to regain its former glories. Underage success in 1953 sparked a revival of fortunes with a nucleus of players going on to win three divisional junior hurling titles in a row from 1960 to 1962, eventually winning the county outright in the latter year. √âire √ìg won the Liam Breathnach Cup in 1964 before being re-graded to the junior ranks in 1969 where they won the Muskerry Junior Hurling title in 1971 and 1972. Hurling dominated the landscape but √âire √ìg did manage to chalk-up their first Muskerry Junior Football Championship in 1976. In 1977, √âire √ìg won the Junior Hurling County Championship and returned to the Intermediate grade and it didn't take long for them to make an impression, winning the County Championship within two seasons in 1979 before going on to compete at senior level for the following three years. In 1985 √âire √ìg won their second Intermediate Hurling County title defeating Blackrock by 0‚Äì14 to 2‚Äì7. This would mark the end of a great era in the club's fortunes. There was little in the way of adult success from the late 1980s to the early 2000s but this period did see a number of significant underage successes. √âire √ìg secured Minor ‚ÄòB‚Äô and ‚ÄòA‚Äô Hurling County titles in 1988 and 1993. Underage football emerged as a force during this period and significantly in 1998, the Under-14 footballers won the Cork F√©ile na nGael competition. Many of these players went on to win the club's first Minor ‚ÄòA‚Äô Football County title four years later. In 2006 the minors landed a second county title and these successes provided the platform for √âire √ìg's 2008 Junior Football County Championship win when they defeated Ballygarvan in the final. √âire √ìg also won the Premier 2 Minor Hurling County Championship that year an achievement that was matched in 2014, winning the Rebel √ìg Minor ‚ÄòA‚Äô Hurling County title. In October 2014, √âire √ìg won their first Intermediate Football Championship, defeating Rockchapel in the final on a scoreline of 0‚Äì14 to 0‚Äì6. Having played at various sites throughout the parish since its foundation, √âire √ìg settled in its current location in Knockanemore. The current pavilion and playing fields were opened in 1987 with later developments seeing the addition of two new playing fields west of Casey's Road and more recently, an all-weather astro- turf pitch, ball alley and new dressing-room facilities. The progress continues to the present day with works in-progress on the development of a floodlit, sand-and soil based pitch. Inter-County representatives All Ireland Senior Hurling Medal winners: Dinny Barry Murphy, Joe O‚ÄôDonovan, Colm Sheehan, Mick Malone. All Ireland Senior Football Medal winners: Daniel Goulding, Ciar√°n Sheehan. Daniel and Ciar√°n's achievement of helping Cork to raise Sam Maguire in 2010 will live long in the memory. Both players were instrumental in securing Cork's seventh All-Ireland Senior Football Title with Daniel being named Man-of-the-Match. Founder and first √âire √ìg treasurer, Paddy O‚ÄôConnell won an All-Ireland Senior Football medal with Cork in 1911 whilst playing with his then club, Nils. Barry Coffey, winner of two All-Ireland Senior Football medals in 1989 and 1990, representing his home club Bishopstown, also played with √âire √ìg towards the end of his playing career. Other Cork Medal winners: The first player to play with Cork from Ovens parish was Michael Sheehan of Currahaly, 1890. Other players to win medals playing with Cork were Billy Desmond who played with Bride Valley and later √âire √ìg, John O‚ÄôSullivan, Jack Lucey, Mort Lucey, Jim O‚ÄôCallaghan, Billy Murphy, Sam O‚ÄôCallaghan, Tom Savage, Derry O‚ÄôBrien, Finbarr Sheehan, Mattie Murphy, Denis Desmond, Paddy O‚ÄôBrien, Jamsie O‚ÄôLeary, Denis O‚ÄôBrien, Michael Sheehan, Kevin Hallissey and John Dineen. History (old version) It is now certain that a parish team known as 'Bridevalley' played Inniscarra in the mid-Cork championship at Coachford on Sunday, 19 April 1891 ‚Äì so there is a record of over 110 years of parish hurling. Probably the first parishioner to play for Cork was Willie Fitzgerald. He won a Dr. Croke Cup medal with Cork in 1902 and was the first chairman of the divisional board when it was formed in 1925. Club colours were then blue with red collars and cuffs. In 1923, the Bridevalley was formed and remained active until 1927. In 1928, Bridevalley and Cloughduv amalgamated to form a senior club called √âire √ìg and in that same year they won the Cork Senior Hurling Championship, defeating Mallow in the final at Cork Athletic Grounds before an attendance of 10,000 who paid a total of ¬£332. Mallow had beaten Blackrock and √âire √ìg beat St. Finbarr's en route to the final. In 1936, Cloughduv and Bridevalley disbanded with the latter retaining the name √âire √ìg and their club colours were red and blue. √âire √ìg achieved very little success during the 1940s but thanks to men like John Lyons, Tommy Murphy, John Crean, John Brady, Jimmy Brien, etc. the game was kept alive in Ovens. The 1950s saw a great revival. √âire √ìg juveniles won in 1952 and the minors won in 1953, and these wins were the nucleus for future success. Around this time, they changed to the current club colours ‚Äì re and yellow. It is not generally known that the present colours were adopted purely by accident. The old jerseys began to disintegrate and funds were low. Fortunately Denis Desmond (Kilcrea) had a draper shop in Mallow. Some team in that area had ordered a set of jerseys but were slow to take them. Denis heard of the √âire √ìg predicament and sold them the jerseys at half price. They were red and yellow. The major breakthrough came in 1960 when √âire √ìg won the Mid Cork junior hurling title and went on to retain it for the next two years. In 1962 the club won the Cork Junior Hurling Championship by defeating Carrigtwohill at the Athletic grounds by 3‚Äì4 to 2‚Äì4. √âire √ìg team was P O'Shea, T O'Sullivan, E. McCarthy, C. Lynch, C.

The club went into the intermediate grade after that and won the intermediate league in 1963. However, they were beaten by a superb Glen Rovers side in the 1965 Cork Intermediate Hurling Championship final. They did win the Liam Breathnach cup in 1964, however. in 1969 the club moved back to junior ranks and won the Mid Cork title in 1971 and 1972 as well as many minor and underage successes. Another Mid Cork title came to the Ovens area in 1977, and the same year they won the Cork Junior Hurling Championship when they defeated Erin's Own by 2‚Äì8 to 1‚Äì9 at P√°irc U√≠ Chaoimh. The 1977 county champions from √âire √ìg were D. O'Brien, T. Brennan, J. Murphy, L. O' Leary, L. O'Flynn, J. Dineen, J. O'Flynn, D. Desmond, D. O'Flynn, C. Sheehan, M. O'Flynn, C, Malone, D.

Success in the Cork Intermediate Hurling Championship soon followed in 1979 when √âire √ìg defeated Mallow 7‚Äì11 to 5‚Äì8 in the final in P√°irc U√≠ Chaoimh in front of 8,000 people. √âire √ìg team was D.

After a lapse of 51 years √âire √ìg were back in senior ranks. In 1980, the senior championship was run on a league basis. √âire √ìg played Na Piarsaigh, Nemo Rangers, UCC and Bandon to win this section. √âire √ìg faced St. Finbarr's in the quarter final and were beaten on a score of 2‚Äì10 to 1‚Äì11 and according to a Cork Examiner report, \\"√âire Og responded with admiration to the marvellous attempt to sweep St. Finbarr's out of the reckoning and had the city side back-pedalling for lengthy periods, and a semi-final place eluded them only because of a failure to offer an adequate deterrent to the presence of Jimmy Barry-Murphy at full forward. Jimmy scored two vital goals\\". In 1981 √âire Og, the only club representing Mid-Cork in senior hurling, won a great first round match against Avondhu, but were later narrowly beaten by Youghal. However, their second string won the B hurling championship. √âire √ìg were due to play Ballincollig in the final of the Muskerry Cup, but due to pressure of matches, this game was not played. 1982 saw √âire √ìg being beaten by the narrowest of margins by Carrigdhoun in the first round of the championship. However they won the Mid Cork under 12 hurling championship for the first time and also won the Under-16B football championship. In 1983 √âire √ìg decided to seek regrading to Intermediate ranks, but here again could be considered unlucky to have been defeated by Ballinhassig by 1 point in the semi-final of the championship. Neutral observers would have considered that a draw would have been a fairer result. In 1984, √âire √ìg lost to Bandon in the first round of the Cork Intermediate Hurling Championship and also lost to Blarney in the junior championship. However, in 1985, in true √âire √ìg spirit, they came back on top form again winning both the Cork Intermediate Hurling Championship by beating Blackrock in a fantastic display of hurling in Riverstown and also the Intermediate League by beating Inniscarra after a replay. √âire √ìg hurlers who have won an All Ireland medal with their county include Jimmy Barry Murphy, Colm Sheehan (Senior 1966), Mick Malone (Senior 1976, 1977 and the only player to hold four All Ireland U21 hurling medals), Mattie Murphy, Finbarr Sheehan, and Derry O' Brien (Intermediate 1966). √âire √ìg has traditionally been mainly associated with hurling but in recent years football has made huge progress in the club. In 1961, √âire √ìg made their first breakthrough in football, winning the Mid- Cork Junior B title. They regained the title again in 1968 when they Blarney in the final which was played in Coachford. In 1972, they beat Ballyvourney in the Junior A semi-final, but lost to Ballincollig in the final on a scoreline of 1‚Äì7 to 2‚Äì3. In 1973, √âire √ìg were defeated by Ballyvourney, who won the junior county title that year. In the same year, √âire √ìg won their first junior football league. Interest in football was now serious. On a wet cold day in 1976, √âire √ìg football had its greatest moment when their greater experience was one of the deciding factors in helping them to win their first ever Mid-Cork Junior A title, on a scoreline of 1‚Äì13 to Donoughmore's 2‚Äì1.

Sub ‚Äì D. Desmond for M. Kelleher. Cloyne put a stop the √âire √ìg's county title aspirations defeating them in a game played in the park by 1‚Äì9 to 2‚Äì4. Hurling seemed to dominate in 1977, but √âire √ìg reached the Junior A final in 1983 where Donoughmore gained revenge for their defeat in 1976. A keen interest in football at underage level developed in √âire √ìg in the early '80s. In 1982, '83 and '84 they reached the U21 mid- Cork finals. In 2008, the club won the Cork Junior Football Championship title. In addition, Daniel Goulding and Ciar√°n Sheehan became members of the Cork Senior football squad.

Rock music has been highly dependent on technological developments, particularly the invention and refinement of the synthesizer, the development of the MIDI digital format and computer technology. In the late 1960s, rock musicians began to use electronic instruments, like the theremin and Mellotron, to supplement and define their sound; by the end of the decade the Moog synthesizer took a leading place in the sound of emerging progressive rock bands who would dominate rock in the early 1970s. In the 1980s, more commercially oriented synthpop dominated electronic rock. In the new millennium the spread of recording software led to the development of new distinct genres including electroclash, dance-punk and new rave. Technology The first commercial Moog synthesizer, commissioned by the Alwin Nikolais Dance Theater of NY in 1964 Experiments in tape manipulation or musique concr√®te, early computer music and early sampling and sound manipulation technologies paved the way for both manipulating and creating new sounds through technology. The world's first computer to play music was CSIRAC in 1950-1, designed and built by Trevor Pearcey and Maston Beard and programmed by mathematician Geoff Hill.D. Demant, \\"Why the real thing is essential for telling out stories\\", in A. Tatnall, ed., History of Computing: Learning from the Past: IFIP WG 9. 7 International Conference, HC 2010, Held as Part of WCC 2010, Brisbane, Australia, September 20‚Äì23, 2010, Proceedings, Volume 325 of IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology (Melbourne VIC: Springer, 2010), , p. 14. Early electronic instruments included the theremin, which uses two metal antennas that sense the position of a player's hands and control oscillators for frequency with one hand, and amplitude (volume) to produce an eerie but difficult to manipulate sound. It was used by avant garde and classical musicians in the early twentieth century and was used on a large number of 1940s and 50s science fiction films and suspense.P. Theberge, \\"Therimin\\" in J. Shepherd, ed., Continuum Encyclopedia of Popular Music of the World: Volume II: Performance and production (New York, NY: Continuum, 2003), , p. 267. Electronic musical synthesizers that could be used practically in a recording studio became available in the mid-1960s, around the same time as rock music began to emerge as a distinct musical genre.J. Stuessy and S. D. Lipscomb, Rock and Roll: its History and Stylistic Development (London: Pearson Prentice Hall, 6th edn., 2008), , p. 21. The Mellotron, an electro-mechanical, polyphonic sample-playback keyboard, which used a bank of parallel linear magnetic audio tape strips to produce a variety of sounds enjoyed popularity from the mid-1960s.R. Brice, Music Engineering (Oxford: Newnes, 2nd edn., 2001), , pp. 108-9. The initial popularity of the Mellotron would be overtaken by the Moog synthesizer, created by Robert Moog in 1964, which produced completely electronically generated sounds which could be manipulated by pitch and frequency, allowing the \\"bending\\" of notes and considerable variety and musical virtuosity to be expressed. The early commercial Moog synthesiser was large and difficult to manipulate, but in 1970 Moog responded to its use in rock and pop music by releasing the portable Mini-moog, which was much simpler, easier to use, and proved more practical for live performance.T. Pinch and F. Trocco, Analog Days: The Invention and Impact of the Moog Synthesizer (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2004), , pp. 214-36. Early synthesisers were monophonic (only able to play one note at a time), but polyphonic versions began to be produced from the mid-1970s, among the first being the Prophet-5.Barry R. Parker, Good Vibrations: the Physics of Music (Boston MD: JHU Press, 2009), , p. 213. MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) was created in 1982, as an industry-standard protocol that enables electronic musical instruments (synthesizers, drum machines), computers and other electronic equipment (MIDI controllers, sound cards, samplers) to communicate and synchronize with each other. Unlike previous analog devices, MIDI does not transmit an audio signal, but sends event messages about pitch and intensity, control signals for parameters such as volume, vibrato and panning, cues, and clock signals to set the tempo, allowing the building of more complex music and the integration of different devices.J. Rothstein, MIDI: a Comprehensive Introduction (Madison, MI: A-R Editions, 2nd edn., 1995), , pp. 9 and 93. In the new millennium, as computer technology become more accessible and music software has advanced, interacting with music production technology is now possible using means that bear no relationship to traditional musical performance practices:S. Emmerson, Living Electronic Music (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007), , pp. 111-13. for instance, laptop performance (laptronica) and live coding.S. Emmerson, Living Electronic Music (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2007), , p. 115. In the last decade a number of software-based virtual studio environments have emerged, with products such as Propellerhead's Reason, Ableton Live and Native Instruments Reaktor finding widespread appeal.K. Collins, From Pac-Man to Pop Music: Interactive Audio in Games and New Media (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2008), , p. 140. Such tools provide viable and cost-effective alternatives to typical hardware-based production studios, and thanks to advances in microprocessor technology, it is now possible to create high quality music using little more than a single laptop computer. Such advances have been seen as democratizing music creation,T. D. Rossing, Springer Handbook of Acoustics (New York, NY: Springer, 2007), , p. 740. leading to a massive increase in the amount of home-produced electronic music available to the general public via the internet.S.

History =1960s= Mike Pinder of the Moody Blues, a pioneer of electronic rock, in 1974 One of the earliest composers to use electronic instruments in popular music was Joe Meek with the album I Hear A New World (recorded in 1959, but not fully released until 1991),R.

The 1960s saw the utilization of studio techniques and new technologies to achieve unusual and new sounds. Small guitar stomp boxes and various guitar effects are developed which distort or alter the sound quality of the electric guitar in various ways.J.

Everett, The Foundations of Rock: from \\"Blue suede shoes\\" to \\"Suite: Judy blue eyes\\" (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), , p. 81. Ian McDonald of King Crimson, Rick Wakeman of Yes and Tony Banks of Genesis also became major Mellotron users at this time, infusing the violin, cello, brass, flute and choir sounds as a major texture in the music of their respective bands.T. Pinch and F. Trocco, Analog Days: The Invention and Impact of the Moog Synthesizer (Harvard University Press, 2004), , p. 207. The Beach Boys' track \\"I Just Wasn't Made for These Times\\" from Pet Sounds (1966) was the first recorded use of an Electro-Theremin on a rock album, and the first rock album to incorporate a Theremin-like instrument.T. Holmes, Electronic and Experimental Music: Technology, Music, and Culture (London: Taylor & Francis, 3rd edn., 2008), , p. 415. The late '60s also saw the popularization of the Moog synthesizer. Micky Dolenz of The Monkees bought one of the first Moog synthesizers and the band was the first to feature it on an album with Pisces, Aquarius, Capricorn & Jones Ltd. in 1967, which reached number 1 on the US charts.E. Lefcowitz, The Monkees Tale (San Francisco CA: Last Gasp, 1989), , p. 48. A few months later, the title track of the Doors' 1967 album Strange Days would also feature a Moog, played by Paul Beaver.T.

Other early users included Emerson, Lake & Palmer's Keith Emerson, Pete Townshend, Electric Light Orchestra, Genesis, Return to Forever, and Weather Report. Instrumental prog rock was particularly significant in continental Europe, allowing bands like Kraftwerk, Tangerine Dream, Can, Faust and Klaus Schulze to circumvent the language barrier.P. Bussy, Kraftwerk: Man, Machine and Music (London: SAF, 3rd end., 2004), , pp. 15‚Äì17.

Erlewine, eds, All Music Guide to Rock: the Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul (Milwaukee, WI: Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2002), , pp. 1330-1. In 1972, jazz musician Stan Free, under the pseudonym Hot Butter had a top 10 hit in the United States and United Kingdom with a cover of the 1969 Gershon Kingsley song \\"Popcorn\\". It is considered a forerunner to synthpop due to the use of the Moog synthesizer.[ Hot Butter bio by Allmusic] The same year, Japanese musician Isao Tomita released the electronic album Electric Samurai: Switched on Rock, a collection of Moog synthesizer renditions of contemporary rock songs. It featured voice synthesis and synthesizer programming that he would later carry over to his 1974 hit album Snowflakes Are Dancing. His work was considered a revolution in synthesizer programming. Osamu Kitajima's 1974 progressive psychedelic rock album Benzaiten, featuring Haruomi Hosono, utilized a synthesizer, rhythm machine, and electronic drums. The mid-1970s saw the rise of electronic art musicians such as Jean Michel Jarre, Vangelis, and Tomita, who with Brian Eno were a significant influence on the development of new-age music.T. Holmes, Electronic and Experimental Music: Technology, Music, and Culture (London: Routledge, 3rd edn., 2008), , p. 403. Synthesisers were not universally welcomed by rock musicians in the 1970s. Some bands, including Queen, stated on their album liner notes that they did not use synthesisers.P. Auslander, Liveness: Performance in a Mediatized Culture (London: Taylor & Francis, 2nd edn., 2008), , p. 83. Similarly, early guitar-based punk rock was initially hostile to the \\"inauthentic\\" sound of the synthesiser,S. Borthwick and R. Moy, Popular Music Genres: an Introduction (Edinburgh University Press, 2004), , p. 122. but many new wave and post-punk bands that emerged from the movement began to adopt it as a major part of their sound.D. Nicholls, The Cambridge History of American Music (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998), , p. 373. The American duo Suicide, who arose from the post-punk scene in New York, utilized drum machines and synthesizers in a strange hybrid between electronics and post punk on their eponymous 1977 album.D. Nobakht, Suicide: No Compromise (London: SAF, 2004), , p. 136. Together with British bands Throbbing Gristle and Cabaret Voltaire, they moved on to use a variety of electronic and sampling techniques that emulated the sound of industrial production to produce industrial music.. In April 1977, Cat Stevens' Izitso updated his pop rock and folk rock style with the extensive use of synthesizers, giving it a more synthpop style; \\"Was Dog a Doughnut\\" in particular was an early techno-pop fusion track, which made early use of a music sequencer. 1977 was also the year that Ultravox member Warren Cann purchased a Roland TR-77 drum machine, which was first featured in their October 1977 single release \\"Hiroshima Mon Amour\\". The ballad arrangement, metronome-like percussion and heavy use of the ARP Odyssey synthesizer was an early attempt to fuse traditional rock with the new musical technology.. The Japanese band Yellow Magic Orchestra pioneered synthpop with their self-titled album (1978) and Solid State Survivor (1979),J. Ankeny, Yellow Magic Orchestra - biography, allmusic, Retrieved 16-2-2014 with the latter including several early computerized rock songs, such as a mechanized cover version of The Beatles' \\"Day Tripper\\" (1965). Also in 1978, the first incarnation of The Human League released their d√©but single \\"Being Boiled\\" and Devo moved towards a more electronic sound. Others were soon to follow, including Tubeway Army, a little known outfit from West London, who dropped their punk rock image and jumped on the band wagon, topping the UK charts in the summer of 1979 with the single \\"Are Friends Electric?\\". This prompted the singer, Gary Numan to go solo and in the same year he released the Kraftwerk inspired album, The Pleasure Principle and topped the charts for the second time with the single \\"Cars\\".J. Miller, Stripped: Depeche Mode (Omnibus Press, 3rd edn., 2008), , p. 21. =1980s= Depeche Mode in concert at London's O2 Arena, 2009 The definition of MIDI and the development of digital audio made the creation of purely electronic sounds much easier.M. Russ, Sound Synthesis and Sampling (Elsevier, 2nd ed., 2004), , p. 66. This led to the growth of synthpop, by which, particularly through their adoption by the New Romantic movement, synthesizers came to dominate the pop and rock music of the early 80s.. The early sound of synthpop was \\"eerie, sterile, and vaguely menacing\\", but more commercially orientated bands like Duran Duran adopted dance beats to produce a catchier and warmer sound. They were soon followed into the charts by a large number of bands who used synthesizers to create three-minute pop singles. These included New Romantics who adopted an elaborate visual style that combined elements of glam rock, science fiction and romanticism such as Spandau Ballet, A Flock of Seagulls, Culture Club, ABC, Soft Cell, Talk Talk, B-Movie and the Eurythmics, sometimes using synthesizers to replace all other instruments, S.T. Erlewine Eurythmics - Biography. allmusic, Retrieved 16-2-2014 until the style began to fall from popularity in the mid-1980s. =1990s= Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails in 2008 In the 90s many electronic acts applied rock sensibilities to their music in a genre which became known as big beat. It fused \\"old-school party breakbeats\\" with diverse samples, in a way that was reminiscent of Old school hip hop. Big beat was criticised for dumbing down the electronica wave of the late 1990s. This sound was popularised by British acts such as Fatboy Slim, The Prodigy and The Chemical Brothers and from the US The Crystal Method, √úberzone and Lunatic Calm.. This period also saw the rise of artists who combined industrial rock and metal. Ministry and Nine Inch Nails both recorded platinum-selling albums... Their success led to mainstream attention other industrial musicians; including Foetus and Coil. The mid-90s was a high point for industrial rock, when, in addition to bands that had been around since the 1980s, such as KMFDM, newer bands such as Gravity Kills emerged as commercial acts.. =2000s= Justice in 2007 In the 2000s, with the increased accessibility of computer technology and advances in music software, it became possible to create high quality music using little more than a single laptop computer. This resulted in a massive increase in the amount of home-produced electronic music available to the general public via the expanding internet,R. Shuker, Popular Music: the Key Concepts (Abingdon: Routledge, 2nd edn., 2005), , pp. 145‚Äì8. and new forms of performance such as laptronica and live coding. These techniques also began to be used by existing bands, as with industrial rock act Nine Inch Nails' album Year Zero (2007), and by developing genres that mixed rock with digital techniques and sounds, including indietronica, electroclash, dance-punk and new rave. Indietronica, which had begun in the early '90s with bands like Stereolab and Disco Inferno, took off in the new millennium as the new digital technology developed, with acts including Broadcast from the UK, Justice from France, Lali Puna from Germany and The Postal Service and Ratatat from the US, mixing a variety of indie sounds with electronic music, largely produced on small independent labels... The Electroclash subgenre began in New York at the end of the 1990s, combining synth pop, techno, punk and performance art. It was pioneered by I-F with his track \\"Space Invaders Are Smoking Grass\\" (1998),. and pursued by artists including Felix da Housecat,. Peaches, Chicks on Speed and Fischerspooner. Initially Ladytron were labeled as electroclash by some journalists,. but they rejected this tag. It gained international attention at the beginning of the new millennium and spread to scenes in London and Berlin, but rapidly faded as a recognisable genre.J. Harris, Hail!, Hail! Rock 'n' Roll (London: Sphere, 2009), , p. 78. Dance-punk, mixing post-punk sounds with disco and funk, had developed in the 1980s, but it was revived among some bands of the garage rock/post-punk revival in the early years of the new millennium, particularly among New York acts such as LCD Soundsystem, Liars, The Rapture, and Radio 4, joined by dance-oriented acts who adopted rock sounds such as Out Hud.M. Wood, \\"Review: Out Hud: S.T.R.E.E.T. D.A.D.\\", New Music, 107, November 2002, p. 70. In Britain the combination of indie with dance-punk was dubbed new rave in publicity for Klaxons and the term was picked up and applied by the NME to bands. including Trash Fashion,. New Young Pony Club,. Hadouken!, Late of the Pier, Test Icicles. and Shitdisco, forming a scene with a similar visual aesthetic to earlier rave music.. Ladytron in 2008, originally categorised as electroclash they helped revive interest in synthpop Renewed interest in electronic music and nostalgia for the 1980s led to the beginnings of a synthpop revival, with acts including Adult and Fischerspooner. In 2003-4 it began to move into the mainstream with Ladytron, the Postal Service, Cut Copy, the Bravery and The Killers all producing records that incorporated vintage synthesizer sounds and styles which contrasted with the dominant sounds of post-grunge and nu-metal. In particular the Killers enjoyed considerable airplay and exposure and their debut album Hot Fuss (2004) reached the Billboard Top Ten.T. Cateforis, Are We Not New Wave?: Modern Pop at the Turn of the 1980s (University of Michigan Press, 2011), , pp. 218-9. The Killers, the Bravery and the Stills all left their synthpop sound behind after their debut albums and began to explore classic 1970s rock.T. Cateforis, Are We Not New Wave?: Modern Pop at the Turn of the 1980s (University of Michigan Press, 2011), , p. 223. Some modern practitioners of metal and hardcore punk subgenres such as post-hardcore and metalcore have been influenced by electronic music. In addition to typical metal and hardcore characteristics, these groups make use of synthesizers, electronically produced rhythms and beats, and auto-tuned vocals. Such groups have been formed in England, the United States, Canada, Brazil, Hong Kong and Czech Republic. The trend has been referred to using the terms electronicore, synthcore, and trancecore, among others. Some recently formed post-hardcore and metalcore bands utilize characteristics of electronica. Sumerian Records notes that \\"there has been a surplus of 'electronica/hardcore' music as of late\\". Notable bands that demonstrate a fusion of hardcore punk subgenres and electronic dance music include Abandon All Ships, Attack Attack!, Asking Alexandria, All For A Vision, Enter Shikari, I See Stars Breathe Carolina, Ghost Town and Public Relations. Horse the Band acted so on a somewhat different way by combining hardcore with bitpop and chiptunes called Nintendocore.

It was a small, single- engine high-wing airliner, the first civil transport aircraft built in Romania. Design & development In April 1933, Erhard Milch, previously head of Deutsche Luft Hansa, was appointed Secretary of State for Air. Relations between Milch and Willy Messerschmitt had been bad ever since the cancellation and later re-ordering of the BFW M.20 by Luft Hansa, and the future of orders for BFW looked bleak. That summer, a visit was made to Romania, where an order was placed by √éntreprinderea de Construc»õii Aeronautice Rom√¢ne»ôti (ICAR) for the design of a small airliner, to be built by them in Romania. ICAR designated it the ICAR 36; Messerschmitt, working at BFW referred to it as the M 36. Description The ICAR 36 was a high-wing cantilever monoplane of mixed construction, with a closed cockpit, single engine, and fixed landing gear. It had a welded steel tube fuselage, covered with plywood, and tapered single-spar, plywood-covered wings. The crew of two sat in the cockpit, forward of the wing, which was equipped with a radio and could be fitted with twin controls. The cabin for six passengers, with wide rectangular windows and access doors at the rear, was aft and below the cockpit / wings. There were also two baggage compartments. thumb One aircraft (YR-ACS) was built, later modified with a cabin for five passengers and two luggage compartments. Initially intended to be powered by a licence-built Gnome & Rh√¥ne 7K radial engine, the aircraft was eventually fitted with a Armstrong Siddeley Serval I ten-cylinder radial engine in a NACA cowling., which was, in turn, replaced with a Lorraine 7M Mizar 47, driving a three-bladed propeller. The fixed landing gear was supported by long faired vertical struts to the wings, with teardrop spats over the mainwheels and a tailwheel at the end of the fuselage. A tri-motor development was planned, but not realized. Operational history Only one aircraft was built, operated by LARES on several internal routes including the Bucharest to Cernauti route.

It is located just off Bardstown Road. Architecture The two-story brick house is built in the Italianate style, with a square main block topped by a cupola. A two-story rear section extends back from the main block, forming a \\"T\\". The main facade is symmetric. Its formal, symmetrical design is unusual for Louisville. History Rose Hill was built in 1852 for Emory Low, a Louisville dry goods merchant born in Leominster, Massachusetts in 1808. At one time he owned an entire block of Louisville's Main Street. While Rose Hill was still under construction, Low was killed when an outhouse wall collapsed on him. The house was in flux while his estate was settled, and his widow did not live there until 1867. The house was built on a parcel of land Low owned, which was a part of an original military land grant to William Pope. The land around Rose Hill was subdivided in 1908 and it is amid a residential neighborhood. Rose Hill was owned by the Seelbach family in the 1940s, but fell into disrepair from the late 1950s until 1975, when it became home to a graphic design firm.

NTT Communications took a majority stake in the company on February 28, 2019, transferred to NTT Ltd. on July 1, 2019.  Overview  Founded in 2000, Transatel provides cellular mobile services as a mobile virtual network enabler (MVNE/A) and provider (MVNO). The company operates globally with a cloud-based technical infrastructure in France, in the UK, and in the USA. Transatel is active in three main market segments: * Mobile telephony since 2000, as an MVNO (Mobile Virtual Network Operator), MVNE (enabler), or MVNA (aggregator) * Machine to Machine (M2M) connectivity, since 2011 * The Internet of Things (IoT) since 2014, with a focus on cellular embedded connectivity for consumer devices It is profitable company, with 70% of revenues generated outside of France.  Management  = Jacques Bonifay = CEO and founder of Transatel, is head of the company's general management, as well as shareholder relationships. In November 2009, Bonifay became president of Alternative Mobile, the French MVNO association made up of the country's largest MVNOs, where he leads the association's interests in relation to the French government and telecom regulatory authorities. Bonifay was elected president of EAFM, the European Association of Full MVNOs in October 2012. Now renamed MVNO Europe, the group includes major European operators, such as Liberty Global, Telenet, PosteMobile, Cyta Hellas, Voiceworks, and El Telecom (NRJ Mobile). Jacques guides their European lobbying efforts. Before founding Transatel, Bonifay had a career in the space industry at Airbus, and afterwards as a consultant for McKinsey & Co. at the Paris office. Jacques later headed Strategy & Business Development for the Professional & Consumer Division of Alcatel, where he initiated new businesses based on fixed mobile convergence and e-commerce with several operators. Jacques holds an MBA degree from INSEAD and an engineering degree from ENSERG/INPG (Ecole Nationale Sup√©rieure d‚ÄôElectronique et de Radio√©lectricit√© de Grenoble). = Bertrand Salomon = Bertrand Salomon leads the design of the MVNE platform and the product development roadmap. He also manages Transatel's relationships with mobile network operators worldwide, as well as the delivery of customized solutions for MVNO or Machine-to-Machine customers. Prior to founding Transatel, Salomon was at Bouygues Telecom France, first as the Manager for New Products & Services, then as Director of the Mobile Internet activity. Before that, he worked for Sagem France, in technical development and project management. Salomon holds an engineering degree from the Polytechnic School of Lausanne (Switzerland), and an MBA degree from INSEAD (France). Activities Transatel enables mobile services (BtoB) as an MVNE/A or M2M enabler, and provides mobile services (BtoC) through its own MVNOs. = Enabler of mobile services : BtoB activities =  MVNE  In Europe, Transatel enables access to the following MNO networks for voice, SMS and data services * Orange France- France * EE (formerly T-Mobile UK and Orange UK)- United Kingdom * Salt (formerly Orange CH)- Switzerland * Mobistar (Orange)- Belgium * Tango- Luxembourg In addition, Transatel delivers added value services around provisioning, prepaid and post-paid billing, as well as fixed-mobile convergence. The enabler activity follows two different business models, according to clients' needs: the pure enabler model (MVNE) and the aggregator model (MVNA) for companies wishing to launch and monetize a mobile offer under their brand, be it prepaid or post-paid. When an MVNO wishes to purchase airtime directly from a Mobile Network Operator (MNO), Transatel acts as the MVNE (MVNO enabler) the technical provider servicing either the MNO or the MVNO. Transatel's MVNE references include: * Life Mobile * Post Office Mobile * Now Mobile * Colruyt Mobile or Ortel. = MVNA = As an MVNA, (MVNO Aggregator) Transatel purchases mobile airtime in bulk from a partner mobile operator, adding the value of its service platform, and wholesales this airtime to multiple MVNOs. Each MVNO in turn sells the mobile service to consumers or companies. The MVNA activity is concentrated in Europe, particularly France, the UK and Switzerland. Major clients include The People's Operator (TPO), China Telecom Europe, Sewan, Paritel and Netcom.  Machine to Machine connectivity  In 2011, Transatel entered the Machine to machine (M2M) arena, using its existing MVNE infrastructure across Europe to provide M2M services along similar business models. Transatel enables M2M players to include airtime connectivity to their services, as well as a range of applications, such as fleet and asset tracking, vehicle telematics, smart metering, entertainment, telehealth. Today, Transatel manages over 1 million SIM cards related to its M2M activity. Its largest client is EE in the UK.  Internet of Things  In 2014, Transatel launched the concept of global embedded connectivity for consumer electronics with the SIM 901 concept. Transatel helps consumer device manufacturers deliver global 3G/LTE connectivity through the use of a universal reprogrammable SIM card that can be embedded at manufacturing stage. This SIM card provides connectivity for laptops and tablets at local conditions in 38 countries to date. The service is based on the non-geographic Mobile Network Code MNC 901-37, and made possible through agreements signed in each country with local MNOs. New agreements are signed every month, and should bring the global Transatel footprint to over 60 countries by the end of 2016. SIM 901 gives the end-user of the device uninterrupted cellular access to the internet when residing or traveling in affiliated countries. For the manufacturer, SIM 901 generates new revenue streams and up-markets the device. To date, Transatel has signed agreements with three of the top ten worldwide laptop/tablet OEMs, with commercial soft launches planned in Q1 2016 with Windows 10, targeting the consumer and SME segments. = Provider of mobile services : BtoC activities =  MVNO  Precursor to the Eurotariff, and the Digital Single Market Strategy, Transatel has paved the way for low-cost transnational mobile communications, by being the first operator to offer calls to and from other countries within the European Union. Transatel Mobile was created in 2000 for border dwellers and frequent travelers to solve problems associated with roaming charges applied in France, Switzerland and the Benelux Union. The influx of workers commuting between these geographic locations, paired with their obligation to stay connected, created a need for a mobile connectivity solution. By offering a multi-number SIM card that allows cross-border commuters to place calls at local rates and receive calls for free in four countries, Transatel is able to contribute to the facilitation of trade and the circulation of workers across European borders (Schengen). In 2010, Transatel decided to address foreign travelers visiting France, and later the European Union, by developing LeFrenchMobile. The creation of the new mobile phone service that allowed Transatel to provide mobile communications on a larger scale by giving students, workers and tourists from around the world the ability to contact their original country while in France or in the European Union. International travelers depend on mobile apps such as TripAdvisor, Uber and Facebook in addition to placing calls. Travelers need to constantly stay connected the internet. In April 2015, Transatel created Transatel DataSIM. The brand exclusively offers mobile internet access and allows users to connect to 3G/4G networks in 130 destinations (to date) at local rates. Unlike Transatel's previous offers, Transatel DataSIM was designed to be used throughout the world. To reach the goal of providing global connectivity, the French SME signs new agreements every month with national mobile operators around the world. Bitebird was launched in June 2016 by Transatel and Air France KLM dedicated to frequent travellers who want to stay connected all over the world. Based on the Transatel 901 system, Bitebird offers a 4G hotspot with a SIM card that can be used at local rates in over 100 destinations.

A triple is a data entity composed of subject-predicate-object, like \\"Bob is 35\\" or \\"Bob knows Fred\\". Much like a relational database, one stores information in a triplestore and retrieves it via a query language. Unlike a relational database, a triplestore is optimized for the storage and retrieval of triples. In addition to queries, triples can usually be imported/exported using Resource Description Framework (RDF) and other formats.  Implementations  Some triplestores have been built as database engines from scratch, while others have been built on top of existing commercial relational database engines (such as SQL-based): use of SQL relational databases as an RDF triple store. or NoSQL document-oriented database engines. Like the early development of online analytical processing (OLAP) databases, this intermediate approach allowed large and powerful database engines to be constructed for little programming effort in the initial phases of triplestore development. It seems likely that native triplestores will have the advantage for performance over a longer period of time. A difficulty with implementing triplestores over SQL is that although \\"triples\\" may thus be \\"stored\\", implementing efficient querying of a graph-based RDF model (such as mapping from SPARQL) onto SQL queries is difficult. Related database types Adding a name to the triple makes a \\"quad store\\" or named graph. A graph database has a more generalized structure than a triplestore, using graph structures with nodes, edges, and properties to represent and store data. Graph databases might provide index-free adjacency, meaning every element contains a direct pointer to its adjacent elements, and no index lookups are necessary. General graph databases that can store any graph are distinct from specialized graph databases such as triplestores and network databases.

Until the age of fourteen years, his growth was normal. Franz Winkelmeier made his first public appearance as an anomaly on 6 October 1881 in Braunau. He was promoted by an efficient tailor from Friedburg, and appeared in Lower Austria, Steiermark, Carinthia, G√∂rz, Triest, Fiume, Hungaria and Siebenb√ºrgen. In the summer of 1885 he was in Tyrol, and from 1 September until 30 November he was seen in the Concordia-Theater in Berlin.

His designs were selected for the new reverse sides of seven coins of the pound sterling, after a competition open to the public by the Royal Mint on 2 April 2008. Dent studied art at Coleg Menai and graduated in graphic design from the University of Brighton. The competition was to re-design the reverses of all circulation British coins (except the two pound coin which had only been introduced eleven years earlier). His entry was selected as the best of 4,000 and he was given a one-off payment of ¬£35,000. Dent's designs were inspired by heraldry. He divided the shield of the Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom among the pence coins, so that when they are placed together they show the entire shield. The full shield appears on his pound coin, which before the competition had no fixed design, instead changing every year to represent Scotland, Wales, England and Northern Ireland. In 2011 he designed a commemorative fifty pence coin for the Royal Mint to celebrate 50 years of the World Wildlife Fund. It featured 50 small pictures of plants, animals and natural resources. In 2012 he designed a limited edition two pound coin featuring the face of Charles Dickens made up from his book titles, to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Dickens's birth.

Huw Wheldon was the editor from 1958 to 1962. He was also the principal interviewer and anchor until 1964. Wheldon set about moulding a team of talents, including W. G. Archer, Melvyn Bragg, Humphrey Burton, John Berger, Patrick Garland, David Jones, Peter Newington, Ken Russell, John Schlesinger, Nancy Thomas, and Alan Tyrer Monitor ranged in subject over all the arts. The editor role was handed to Humphrey Burton in July 1962, lasting a year. He was succeeded by David Jones as producer for the 1963‚Äì64 season. The hundredth programme, made in 1962, was a film directed by Ken Russell and written by Wheldon, the celebrated Elgar. The Elgar film was innovative because it was the first time that an arts programme showed one long film about an artistic figure instead of short items, and it was the first time that re-enactments were used. Before this, only photos or location shots had been used in programmes. Russell, however, still met resistance from Wheldon in allowing actors to play the subjects of his films. The Elgar film includes sequences of the young composer riding his bicycle on the Malvern Hills accompanied by Elgar's Introduction & Allegro for Strings. Russell had a particular empathy with Elgar's music because, like the composer, he was a Catholic.BBC Music Magazine, June 2007. Wheldon's Monitor lasted until he had \\"interviewed everyone [he was] interested in interviewing\\", and he was succeeded by Jonathan Miller for the series' last season in 1964/65.

As a teenager, Tuff Duff began attending harness racing events at a racetrack near his home. He left school to go to work for a local stable and eventually made his way to Toronto, Ontario where he was introduced to Thoroughbred racing. Having the physique necessary to be a jockey, he learned to ride and in 1966 obtained his jockey license. While he started his new career slowly, after earning his first win on June 29, 1967 he soon became one of the top apprentice jockeys on the Ontario circuit. From a base in Toronto, Lloyde Duffy would go on to an outstanding career in Canadian racing. Frequently among the top jockeys in wins during the 1970s and 1980s at Greenwood Raceway, and at Woodbine and Fort Erie Racetracks, he also traveled to compete in the United States, Europe, Japan, and South Africa. Notable among the horses Duffy rode were two Hall of Fame inductees. In 1981 he rode Deputy Minister who was voted the Canadian and American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt as well as Canadian Horse of the Year. The following year he was voted the Sovereign Award for Outstanding Jockey when he was the regular jockey for Canadian Horse of the Year, Frost King. In 1982, Lloyde Duffy was inducted in the Prince Edward Island Sports Hall of Fame and in 1990 he was voted the Avelino Gomez Memorial Award, an honour given annually to a jockey in Canada who has made significant contributions to the sport. Wife at the time Heather Duffy, oldest son born June 8 1970 Lloyd Richard Duffy, daughter born April 20 1973 Shauna Nicole Duffy, and youngest son born March 9 1985 Patrick Ryan Duffy. Retired after thirty years as a jockey, on October 17, 1998, in an event that raised money for charity at the racetrack in his native Charlottetown, Lloyde Duffy was the celebrity guest jockey who rode in a \\"man vs horse\\" match race against sprinter Ben Johnson.

In this telenovela, lead roles were portrayed by Benjam√≠n Rojas, Fabi√°n Mazzei, Luisana Lopilato, Mariano Mart√≠nez, Nicol√°s V√°zquez, Isabel Macedo, Elsa Pinilla and Julia Calvo. This show earned 2006 Mart√≠n Fierro Award for the best comedy for youngs. Main cast also recorded Alma Pirata soundtrack, mostly Benjam√≠n Rojas. During this show, Luisana Lopilato and Mariano Martinez were together, engaged. The story Three friends change the course of their lives to try to compensate the unfairness of society and, following a family tradition, they found again La Liga de las Espadas (The League of the Swords), a neutral league whose goal is to deliver justice in cases of extreme unfairness. The super goal of three friends is to discover the whereabouts of a treasure, the emerald Alma, to clean up the memory of their fathers, continue with the league and, as soon as they find out about their fathers' murder, to sentence their murderer. In order to achieve their goals, the three friends create strategies, play characters, imagine ties and simulate risky situations and adventures with confusions and mess. The league has its own laws, among which: never steal of own benefit, do not carry firearms, do not fall in love with the same woman. These could have been followed without any problem, if only gorgeous Allegra and Ciara hadn't appeared. Allegra, rebellious and arrogant, is the daughter of a powerful businessman, who used to be the fourth member of the original league, and the traitor. She is a journalist and a coworker Ciara's, the newspapers photographer. Ciara, like Allegra, is a lady to be reckoned with. Like her mother (the woman who reveals the secret of the former league) she has a deeper understanding for love. Although she does not share the secrets of the league, she is linked to its history: she is the illegitimate daughter of Gino, Allegra's father. Thus, this will be the story of three adventurers and a woman who will fight for justice, debating among impossible love and passions, amid a game who will help them understand the true history of their fathers and the sense of their lives. For society, they are four mad people, four guys who rebel against the system, four people in love with life, four people who are completely different and who have the defects, mistakes, confusions and virtues that make them more real, more alive. Alma Pirata is a story about friendship, about never giving up, about adventure and justice, about freedom and loyalty, and most of all, it is about love. Main characters in Alma Pirata are Cruz Navarro (Benjam√≠n Rojas), the league nickname Mija√≠l; Ivan Ferrer (Fabi√°n Mazzei), the league nickname Aramis, Allegra Riganti (Luisana Lopilato), the league nickname Laika; Benicio de Marco (Mariano Martinez), the league nickname Templario; Andr√©s de Marco (Nicol√°s Vazquez), the league nickname Aorta; beautiful Clara Troglio (Isabel Macedo) and Marylin Castellano (Elsa Pinilla), Cruz's love.

He went on to the Courtauld Institute of Art. During World War II he served in the Admiralty.Obituary, Daily Telegraph (London), 8 April 1985. His best-known and most influential book is The Pattern of English Building (1962) (), an examination of the architectural vernacular. It orders its subject according to the building materials and methods used in England. Two of his other books are studies of ecclesiastical architecture: The Cathedrals of England and English Parish Churches as Works of Art. Along with Nikolaus Pevsner (to whose Buildings of England series he was a contributor) and John Betjeman, Clifton- Taylor is considered one of the three most significant figures in the study of English churches.Jenkins, S. and Barker, P. England's Thousand Best Churches, Penguin, 2000, His other books are Buildings of Delight, English Brickwork (with Ronald Brunskill) and English Stone Building (with A. S. Ireson). Clifton-Taylor believed that local materials had to be used for buildings to look 'right', and was therefore critical of much Victorian and subsequent architecture, erected after the railways had facilitated the transport of cheaper materials alien to a particular locale. He also regarded the Victorians as aesthetically poor restorers. Television work Clifton-Taylor gained his greatest public recognition late in life through his work for the BBC. After being introduced through Pevsner to BBC arts producer John Drummond, Clifton-Taylor presented the first episode, The Medieval World, of a television programme on British architecture through the ages called The Spirit of the Age, broadcast in Autumn 1975.https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/ref>Obituary, Sir John Drummond, Daily Telegraph, 09-09-2006 Clifton-Taylor went on to present three extremely popular series of 30- or 40-minute BBC programmes: Six English Towns (1978), Six More English Towns (1981), and Another Six English Towns (1984), in which he visited eighteen English towns, discussing their history and architectural character in an accessible and courteous (if uncompromising) style. Each series was accompanied by its own book, and DVDs of the three series were released in 2016/7.

Dajka later regained his normal health and stopped drinking, and there was talk of a comeback. However, Dajka was found dead in his home by police on 7 April 2009. The cause of his death is unknown, but police said the death is not believed to be suspicious.

Graham has since gone on to win the Men's Open event at the British Indoor Rowing Championships in 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2010, and on each occasion faster than Matthew Pinsent's winning time in 2003. In 2012, he raced in the 35‚Äì39 category winning the British and European Championships in 5:50.1, breaking Sir Steve Redgrave's long-standing Championship record by 1 second. He has also been inducted into the Indoor Rowing Hall of Fame, and in 2010 was given a Lifetime Achievement Award by Concept 2. In addition, he became the first GB rower since Sir Steve Redgrave to win the Men's Open event at the World Indoor Rowing Championships in 2006. He had previously won the 30‚Äì39 Event in 2004 and 2005. Graham began as purely a gym rower, hence being the first \\"non- rower\\" to win at the British Championship, but has since taken up water rowing originally in the hope of making the Olympics. More recently, Graham has represented The Tideway Scullers School and Taurus Boat Club at Henley Royal Regatta, narrowly losing in three finals. His potential in the sport of indoor rowing was noticed as early as his first race in Portsmouth in 2002 where he pulled a 2000m time of 6:03.9, only narrowly losing to future MAD Team team- mate, Nik Fleming. Graham commented to Concept2 in those early days his ambition to reduce his 2000m time to 5minutes 50seconds, which he has since surpassed by quite some margin becoming one of the fastest ergers in the world with his 5:42.5 2000m time clocked at the 2007 British Indoor Rowing Championships. This is the second fastest British time recorded at an indoor rowing competition, beaten only by Moe Sbihi, with a time of 5:41:8 Graham's indoor rowing coach is Eddie Fletcher of Fletcher Sport Science whose rowers have won over 75 medals at the British Indoor Rowing Championships since 2001.

It is the only organisation recognised by Post Office Ltd to act on behalf of subpostmasters. The NFSP has almost 50 branches throughout the UK, separated into 10 geographical regions. Each member is represented by their local Branch Secretary and Regional Secretary; the Board of Non-Executive Directors is made up of serving subpostmasters (each representing a UK region) and three representatives from organisations with a portfolio of post offices (WH Smith, Ryman and SPAR). History On 19 April 1897 a group of up to 90 subpostmasters assembled at the Music Saloon, Wood Street, Wakefield (now the Institute of Literature and Science) to consider forming a national association to ‚Äúimprove the conditions under which subpostmasters labour and to undertake the advancement of our interests by all legitimate and honourable means‚Äù. The federation was formed, with Wakefield as its headquarters, and the first conference was held in Nottingham on 11 April 1898. The first edition of a monthly newspaper The SubPostmaster was published on 4 September 1899, and Joseph Ranns, founder and first National President, wrote the inaugural article. The magazine is still published today. In February 1947, the Federation‚Äôs headquarters moved to Shoreham-by-Sea, Sussex. Originally a trade union, the status of the NFSP was changed to better reflect members requirements as self employed individuals and organisations. Subpostmaster‚Äôs were deemed to be self-employed agents of Post Office Ltd by the Certification Officer on the 13th of January, 2014. Via a democratic vote, members chose overwhelmingly to rejected amalgamation with other Trade Unions and to ensure its continued independence, changed its status to a trade association on 1st of October, 2016.

The all-male chorus sings a variety of songs arranged for TTBB, ranging from Broadway show tunes to Latin motets to original compositions specially commissioned by the Chorus or written by its members. With 180 volunteer singing members, the Chorus produces and presents a full concert season every year and is also featured at a number of other special appearances and outreach programs locally, throughout the Midwest and the nation. TCGMC is a member-driven organization governed by a 24-member Board of Directors composed of 50% singing members. Its current Artistic Director is Dr. Gerald Gurss, and its Executive Director is Kevin Stocks. History The Twin Cities Gay Men's Chorus was formed in 1981 as Twin Cities Men's Chorus, adding the word \\"gay\\" to their title in 1991. TCGMC has grown to be one of the largest GLBT arts organizations in Minnesota and the fourth largest gay men's chorus in the country. It is a member of GALA (Gay and Lesbian Association of Choruses).) Additionally, the Chorus, along with Emmy award-winning producers John Scagliotti and Dan Hunt and author Tomie dePaola produced a video program, Oliver Button is a STAR!, that was broadcast nationally on PBS in the fall of 2001 and spring of 2002. The video program is a documentary based on the Chorus' performance of Tomie dePaola's children's book, Oliver Button is a Sissy, and was further developed as a teaching tool for distribution to schools and families. The performance was repeated during the 2012-2013 season to raise awareness of school bullying. Other notable events in the history of the TCGMC include: Performances with Minnesota Orchestra, Saint Paul Chamber Orchestra, VocalEssence (Plymouth Music Series), Ballet of the Dolls, American composer Ned Rorem, and such noted gay and lesbian entertainers Harvey Fierstein, Ann Hampton Callaway, Michael Feinstein and Holly Near. TCGMC has premiered over 25 commissioned works and has performed at major gay and lesbian choral festivals in Montreal, Tampa, Denver, Seattle, San Jose and Minneapolis (for which the TCGMC served as host in 1986.) Regular appearances include Minnesota AIDS Walk, the Twin Cities Pride festival, and concerts at Como Pavilion. In 2003, the Twin Cities Gay Men's Chorus was honored with the HRC (Human Rights Campaign) Minnesota 2003 \\"Brian Coyle Leadership Award\\" for serving the community through outreach and putting a face on the GLBT community. TCGMC also received special recognition in 2003 from Lavender magazine for \\"Best Benefit/Fundraiser\\" for Songs from the Heart and in 2003 & 2004 for \\"Best GLBT Music Group.\\" Capping off their 25th Anniversary season, the chorus embarked on the \\"Great Southern Sing-Out Tour\\" through five cities in six days in July 2006. Kicking off the tour in Nashville's prestigious Ryman Auditorium, the chorus became the first gay organization to perform on the historic stage. From Tennessee, three bus loads of chorus members and supporters traveled to Birmingham, Alabama; Jackson, Mississippi; Mobile, Alabama; and New Orleans, Louisiana. In November 2006, TCGMC became the first gay men's chorus with the word \\"gay\\" in its name to perform for the American Choral Directors Association at an ACDA convention since 1986, when the Los Angeles Gay Men's Chorus successfully sued for inclusion after being accepted in a blind audition, then denied when the blind was broken to reveal the word \\"gay\\" in its name. One of the Chorus' recent works, Through A Glass, Darkly (musical), commissioned from New York composer Michael Shaieb, addresses the problem of methamphetamine addiction in the gay community. The bold, daring production premiered to critical acclaim in March 2008, playing to packed houses. The performance was recorded by Twin Cities Public Television for broadcast on PBS and production of a DVD released in the summer of 2008, and was featured at the 2008 GALA Choruses festival in Miami, Florida in July 2008. Additionally, the Chorus commissioned Shaieb to write a trilogy of songs based on texts by playwright Tony Kushner, the first of which premiered at the Guthrie Theater's Kushner Festival in 2009, and Out of My Range which was performed at the 2012 GALA Choruses festival in Denver. The Chorus' signature song, with which they end all concerts, is \\"Walk Hand in Hand\\" composed by Johnny Cowell and originally performed by Tony Martin, Ronnie Carroll and Andy Williams in 1956, during which the audience is encouraged to stand, join hands, and sing along. An upbeat dance remix was premiered in their spring 2008 concert, \\"Friends ARE Benefits.\\" =Artistic Directors= * Larry Whitely, Music Director (1980 * Richard Weinberg, Music Director (1981-1988) * Craig Carnahan, Interim Music Director (1988-1990) * David Lohman, Music Director (1990-1994) * Craig Carnahan, Artistic Director (1994-2000 * Dr. Stan Hill, Artistic Director (2000-2012) * Dr. Ben Riggs, Artistic Director (2012-2017) * Dr. Gerald Gurss, Artistic Director (2018- ) =Executive Directors= * Joann Usher (2000-2007) * Jon Lewis (2007-2009) * Jeff Heine (2009-2019) *Kevin Stocks (2019- ) Audience & Venues TCGMC performs at the Minnesota ACDA convention in 2006, the first gay-identified chorus to be invited to an ACDA convention since 1986.Approximately 75% of the audience comes from the Twin Cities metro area, but through out-of-state advertising and performance outreach TCGMC performs to audiences in the surrounding cities and states.

Cast of characters There are five characters in the story, \\"Il mediatore\\", listed by order of appearance: * The narrator, Proietti * Antonio, il maggiordomo (the princess's butler) * La principessa (the princess) * Signor Casiraghi, a potential buyer of the princess's apartment * Signor Pandolfi, another potential buyer Synopsis The story begins with the narrator, Proietti (a real estate broker) and Antonio, a butler who works for the princess. Proietti, the narrator, is a real estate agent who has been hired by the princess to sell her apartment. Antonio greets Proietti at the start of the story as he arrives and warns him that the princess has become greedy and money hungry since the death of her husband. At first, she is thought to be old, but Antonio points out that she is a mere 25 years old with a passion for business affairs, taking charge of financial situations wanting to let no one profit at her expense. Antonio warns him that he is unlikely to earn much because of her greed to which he responds that he is a mediator, has been hired to do a job, and will do, take his cut and go. But Antonio seems to know the outcome of the situation before it even starts, warning Proietti that while the princess is beautiful beyond words, he will be 'spitting blood' in the end. The narrator meets the princess who immediately captivates him not only by her beauty but also her desire for money and her greed. Proietti performs an inspection of the apartment quotes a price for the princess, who immediately refutes his expertise and insists on a higher price for the aging property, which requires a lot of work, necessitating a lower price than what the princess expects. Proietti does his best to counsel the princess in real estate matters, but her obstinacy and greeds win out. Two men of means come to see the apartment - first, a man from Milan, Signor Casarighi. After initially accepting Signor Casarighi's offer, she rebuffs him the next day. He promptly leaves, refusing to pay more for the property which requires so much additional work. The princess continues to drive up the price of the apartment slowly: noting the excellent views from the apartment, its prime location and its future worth. A second man, Signor Pandolfi, arrives to view the apartment and shows an instant infatuation with the princess. She works her charms on the second buyer - having foretold to Proietti that a woman can make a man do anything if she so chooses. The princess immediately uses her feminine guile to her advantage which disgusts Proietti. Throughout the story, Moravia describes for the reader the way in which the princess is constantly calling the married Proietti at all hours of the day - as if they were having an illicit affair. He displays angst and frustration at the fact that their relationship never ventures beyond business, to which he replies that she has a piggy bank instead of a heart. Proietti himself is falling for the princess's charms. As the story ends, Proietti's patience runs thin, as the butler foretold. His disgust of the princess's feigned attraction to the new buyer, Signor Pandolfi, and her desire to sell the property at far more than it is worth finally reaches its limits, and the jealous Proietti explodes. Proietti becomes upset with the princess, shouting that he is a broker, not a pimp and storms off, leaving her to deal with the sale of her apartment on her own. Many months later, Proietti runs into Antonio, the princess's butler, who tells him that the princess has since married. Angry, jealous and still very much infatuated with the princess, he assumes that she has married the unattractive (yet very rich) Pandolfi, but Antonio corrects him, telling the narrator that she has married an extremely old man‚Äîold enough to be her grandfather, but also very rich. As the story ends, Proietti asks Antonio if she is still so stunningly beautiful, to which he replies ironically: \\"An angel.\\"Moravia, Alberto, Enzo Siciliano, Francesca Serra, and Simone Casini.

Natural occurrence  Oleanolic acid can be found in olive oil, Phytolacca americana (American pokeweed), and Syzygium spp, garlic, etc. It was first studied and isolated from several plants, including Olea europaea (leaves, fruit), Rosa woodsii (leaves), Prosopis glandulosa (leaves and twigs), Phoradendron juniperinum (whole plant), Syzygium claviflorum (leaves), Hyptis capitata (whole plant), Mirabilis jalapaConstituents of Mirabilis jalapa.

Other Syzygium species including java apple (Syzygium samarangense) and rose apples contain it. Pharmacological research Oleanolic acid is relatively non-toxic, hepatoprotective, and exhibits antitumor and antiviral properties. Oleanolic acid was found to exhibit weak anti-HIV and weak anti- HCV activities in vitro, but more potent synthetic analogs are being investigated as potential drugs. An extremely potent synthetic triterpenoid analog of oleanolic acid was found in 2005, that is a powerful inhibitor of cellular inflammatory processes. They work by the induction by IFN-Œ≥ of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and of cyclooxygenase 2 in mouse macrophages. They are extremely potent inducers of the phase 2 response (e.g., elevation of NADH-quinone oxidoreductase and heme oxygenase 1), which is a major protector of cells against oxidative and electrophile stress. A 2002 study in Wistar rats found that oleanolic acid reduced sperm quality and motility, causing infertility. After withdrawing exposure, male rats regained fertility and successfully impregnated female rats.

It is known by a variety of other names, such as St Mary of the Culdees, Kirkheugh and Church of St Mary of Kilrymont.Barrow, \\"Clergy at St Andrews\\", p. 191; Although not founded as a collegiate church until the 1240s, Scotland's first, it represented a corporate continuation of the association of clergy known as the Culdees or C√©li D√©, \\"vassals of God\\". The church lasted for several centuries, but did not long outlast the Scottish Reformation, and today little of the original structure has survived. C√©li D√© of Cennrighmonaidh St Mary's Collegiate Church has its origins in Kilrymont monastery and its group of canons called \\"Culdees\\" or C√©li D√© (\\"Vassals of God\\"). These priests served a side altar in the Cathedral throughout the twelfth-century and into the thirteenth-century. The C√©li D√© were headed by an abbot. The only abbot whose name is recorded is Gille Cr√≠st, the \\"abbot of the C√©li D√©\\" recorded 1172 x 1178 feuing out lands to the steward of the Bishop of St Andrews, though an unnamed abbot is recorded again in the 1180s.Barrow, \\"Clergy of St Andrews\\", p. 196. Until the foundation of the Augustinian priory in 1140, the C√©li D√© and the seven clerics known as the personae (parsons) are the only known clerics of the cathedral.The traditional date is 1144, but Duncan, \\"Foundation\\", pp. 1‚Äì37, has revised that back to 1140. The new Augustinian monastic canons were intended to become the main clergymen of the cathedral, serving its main altar, and Pope Eugenius III in 1147 confirmed the rights of the Augustinian canons and their prior to elect the Bishop of St Andrews.Cowan & Easson, Medieval Religious Houses, p. 96. It is likely on a number of grounds that Bishop Robert, an Augustinian himself from Nostell, intended that the C√©li D√© would become Augustinians, bringing their property into the new Cathedral Priory. This is not what happened, and although another papal bull of 1147 ordered that upon the death of each C√©le D√© an Augustinian should take his place, they were still there in 1199 when the priory recognised their holdings to be permanent. Second cathedral chapter Professor G. W. S. Barrow argued that from the episcopates of Roger de Beaumont and William de Malveisin the bishops of St Andrews were promoting the C√©li D√© as a second cathedral chapter. Barrow compared this with the attempts of two archbishops of Canterbury, Baldwin and Hubert Walter, to establish a secular college dedicated to St Thomas which would act as a counter the power of the monks and prior; but Barrow thought a more apt parallel was to be founded in the archbishopric of Dublin.Barrow, \\"Clergy of St Andrews\\", pp. 200‚Äì1. In 1163 Archbishop Lorc√°n Ua Tuathail had converted his diocesan canons into the Augustinian Cathedral of the Holy Trinity. John Comyn, the first Anglo-Norman Archbishop of Dublin, created a new collegiate church at St Patricks parish church, a collegiate church his successor Henry de Loundres turned into a second cathedral. In both the Dublin and Canterbury examples, the bishop had to deal with a pre-established monastic cathedral chapter under a prior, and in both cases the bishop sought to subvert the prior and chapter's power in his own interest.Barrow, \\"Clergy of St Andrews\\", p. 201. The C√©li D√© are found in close association with, in fact allied to, the bishop, from Beaumont's episcopate onwards, and the two frequently occur together in disputes with the prior of St Andrews. For instance, sometime between 1202 and 1216, Bishop William de Malveisin absolved the sentence of excommunication which had been imposed by the prior (obviously as part of a dispute), and again in 1220 the papal legate \\"Master James\\" was commissioned by the Pope Honorius III to resolve a dispute between the Augustinians and their prior with Bishop William and \\"certain clergy of St Andrews commonly called C√©li D√©\\" (quosdam clericos de S. Andrea, qui Keledei vugariter appellantur).Barrow, \\"Clergy of St Andrews\\", p. 190. The C√©li D√© were claiming the right to participate in episcopal elections from 1239 onwards, when they participated (at the king's insistence) in the election of David de Bernham.Barrow, \\"Clergy of St Andrews\\", pp. 197‚Äì8. In 1253, following the death of Bishop David and after the Augustinian chapter had already elected Robert de Stuteville as the new bishop, the C√©li D√© and the Archeacon Abel de Gullane protested to the papacy that the election was invalid, owing to the exclusion of the C√©li D√© from the process.Barrow, \\"Clergy of St Andrews\\", pp. 198‚Äì9. Gullane was a papal chaplain, and Pope Innocent IV quashed the election of Robert de Stuteville, appointing Gullane as the new legal bishop. No judgment, however, appears to have been offered on the right of the C√©li D√© to voted in capitular elections.Barrow, \\"Clergy of St Andrews\\", p. 199.

Barrow's contention that the Gaelic-speaking C√©li D√© were gradually replaced by the clerks and personal dependents of the early thirteenth-century bishops, most of whom came from France or England.Barrow, \\"Clergy of St Andrews\\", p. 200, et passim. By 1250, these French or English-speaking C√©li D√© had moved to the church of St Mary, and had been granted the status and rights of a secular college, that is, a collegiate church.Barrow, \\"Clergy of St Andrews\\", pp. 199‚Äì200; Cowan & Easson, Medieval Religious Houses, p. 225; Watt & Murray, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 484. This had probably happened in either 1248 or 1249, when the Church of St Mary's as a separate institution from the cathedral is mentioned for the first time.Barrow, \\"Clergy of St Andrews\\", pp. 199‚Äì200. This transformation gave St Mary's the honour of being the first collegiate church in the Kingdom of Scotland and the only secular college in the kingdom before the fourteenth-century.Cowan & Easson, Medieval Religious Houses, pp. 213‚Äì4 The first known provost of the church was Master Adam de Malkarviston, attested on 7 November 1250.Cowan & Easson, Medieval Religious Houses, p. 225; Watt & Murray, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 484. There were in addition to the provost, six canons.Cowan & Easson, Medieval Religious Houses, p. 225 The new status does not appear to have affected use of the name C√©li D√© immediately, as the church is still called \\"St Marys of the C√©li D√©\\" in 1344. The Church of St Mary became an official royal chapel as early as 1286 x 1296, and remained as such until the erection of the Chapel Royal at Stirling in 1501.Watt & Murray, Fasti Ecclesiae, pp. 431‚Äì4. It is likely that the deanery of the Chapel Royal from 1429 until 1501 formed a prebend within the Church of St Mary.Watt & Murray, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 431. A papal privilege dated 26 January 1386, admitted the Provost of St Mary's to the chapter of St Andrews; he became one of the three secular dignitaries of the chapter, along with the diocese's two archeadecons: > Ad perpetuam rei memoriam. At the petition of king Robert, the pope hereby > constitutes as a secular dignity with cure of the cathedral of St Andrews, > that dignity of the Chapel Royal of St Andrews, immediately subject to the > Apostolic See, which is commonly known as the provostship of St Andrews, > assigning to the provost and his successors a stall in the choir and a place > in the chapter, with a voice in the election of the bishop, or of any other > office, and in all capitular acts and negotiations, and the said provost > nevertheless remaining subject to the bishop, who has the power to correct > him, and if necessary even deprive him of office. Although in the cathedral > there are no dignities, there are two archdeaconries which are reckoned as > dignities, and the seculars holding them have stalls in the choir and places > in the chapter, with a voice in all capitular matters. Avignon, 9 Kal. Feb., > anno 9.Burns (ed.), Papal Letters, p. 114; see also, Cowan & Easson, > Medieval Religious Houses, p. 212. In the 1440s, the Chancellor of the Church of St Mary was added to the chapter of the cathedral (1447 x 1449), but this lasted less than two decades, being dissolved between 1461 and 1462.Cowan & Easson, Medieval Religious Houses, p. 226. Endowments The exact number of the church's prebends through the course of history is unclear, but in the time of Bishop Henry Wardlaw there were eight prebends. These were probably \\"Cairns and Cameron\\", \\"Kinglassie and Kingask\\", Lambieletham, \\"Durie and Rumgally\\", Kinkell, Kinaldy, Fetteresso, and Strathbrock. The C√©li D√© held Lambieletham since the twelfth-century when they obtained it in exchange for Strathkinness; according to the sixteenth- century Book of Assumptions the Provost of St Mary's held the lands of Kinkell, lands under the control of the C√©li D√© in the 1170s.Barrow, \\"Clergy of St Andrews\\", p. 194. Most of the others too were probably ancient C√©li D√©, though Fetteresso and Strathbrock were not, being endowed to the college by Bishop Henry Wardlaw in 1425 and 1435 x 1436 respectively. Arbuthnott (before 1447), Ballingry (before 1461), Benholm (before 1477) and Dysart (1477) were added later in the fifteenth-century, and Idvies (before 1547) was added in the sixteenth. Another may have been created during the time of Archbishop Andrew Forman (abp 1514‚Äì1521). There were allegedly thirteen prebends at the time of the Reformation. Location and building The church is located at Kirkheugh or Kirkhill. This location, where the modern North Street and South Street converge, may have been the original location of the religious site before the construction of a new cathedral building slightly to the west (the remains of which constitute St Rule's Tower) by Robert, Bishop of St Andrews.Ash, \\"St Andrews under its 'Norman' Bishops\\", p. 106. There are burials in the vicinity of Kirkheugh that pre-date the alleged eighth-century foundation of the monastery, and point to a small religious community from the sixth-century.Anderson, \\"Celtic Church\\", p. 68. There were also a number of tenth-century cross-slabs found in the grounds.Fawcett, Foster & Tabraham, St Andrews Cathedral, p. 20. The church was said by John Lesley to have been pulled down by reforming Protestants in June 1559. The extant foundations of the church show that it was cross-shaped, and possessed no aisle. The length of the transepts cannot be determined, but the choir was longer than the nave. The nave seems to represent the earliest of the three detectable building phases. The altar lay at the eastern end of the choir. The sedilia on the southern wall is lost, as are the sacristy and the accommodation for the canons and the provost.

The team had by far its best season to date at 12‚Äì2, first in the AFC West, and made the playoffs for the first time in franchise history. The Broncos earned home field advantage, and won its first two playoff games (over perennial AFC powerhouses Pittsburgh and Oakland). With the AFC Championship win over the Raiders on New Year's Day, Denver earned a berth in Super Bowl XII, but fell 27‚Äì10 to the NFC champion Dallas Cowboys. Still, 1977 was a major leap for the Broncos, who had never won more than nine games in a season. Coach Red Miller ‚Äî in his first season as the Broncos' head coach ‚Äî was named NFL Coach of the Year, and quarterback Craig Morton, age 34, was named NFL Comeback Player of the Year. The Denver defense was known as the Orange Crush, which delighted the makers of the soft drink, based in Illinois. Denver's 1977 season is chronicled in Terry Frei's 2008 book, '77: Denver, the Broncos and a Coming of Age.

Pope Pius IX, who faced his own problems with revolutionary movements in his Church State, first tried to position himself in the middle, strongly opposing revolutionary and violent opposition against the Russian authorities, and appealing to them for more Church freedom.  Polish aspirations and avoiding bloodshedAll sources if not otherwise quoted, are Schmidlin, II, pp 215-219 Both the Holy See and the Russian government expressed their full satisfaction, which was not shared by the Russian Orthodox Church. The Accomodamento, while facilitating the establishment of new dioceses, did little to improve the situation of the Catholic Church at the local level. In 1850, some 32 monasteries were closed and others limited in the recruitment of novices. Local priests were replaced with politically correct candidates, and vacant bishop sees were not allowed to be filled. A special problem continued to be the fate of the Oriental Churches, united with Rome, which were under pressure to unify with the Orthodox Church of Russia.  Relations with Russia after 1861 All sources if not otherwise quoted, are Schmidlin, II, pp 219-224 After long negotiations, and possibly because of the lingering Polish crises, Russia agreed to diplomatic relations with the Vatican in 1861. Tsar Alexander II claimed that only politically revolutionary elements were punished. On August 20, the Pope protested and ordered a prayer novena for the persecuted Church. But the persecutions worsened: 330 priests were deported, a war tax was imposed on the clergy, and 114 Catholic monasteries were closed. International protest from Pope Pius enraged the Tsar and his regime, and led to an Austrian intervention, urging the Pope to be silent in the interest of the Polish Catholics. Russia answered with a break of the concordat on December 6, 1863. By 1870, not a single bishop from the Polish area under Russian control was left in his own diocese Andrey Micewski, Cardinal Wyszynski, A biography, Harcourt, New York, 1984, pp. 3  Diplomacy of Pope Leo XIII  Pope Leo XIII (1878‚Äì1903) attempted to improve the situation with diplomatic overtures, with little success.Schmidlin, II, 506 ff The nightmare of the Russian Church continued under him, more pleasant atmospherics not-withstanding.Schmidlin, II, 508 The 19th century dilemma, that impressive Papal condemnations may result in suffering, closure of episcopal sees, and decade-long interruption of religious services for, and education of the faithful, haunted Papal diplomacy in the 20th century, especially during the pontificates of Pope Pius XI, Pope Pius XII and Pope Paul VI. = References = * Acta Apostolicae Sedis ( AAS), Roma, Vaticano 1922-1960 * Acta et decreta Pii IX, Pontificis Maximi, VolI-VII, Romae 1854 ff * Acta et decreta Leonis XIII, P.M.

Biography Th√©odore Salom√© was born in Paris. He completed all of his musical studies at the Conservatoire de Paris, under the tutelage of Fran√ßois Bazin for harmony and accompaniment, and Fran√ßois Benoist for organ. He won several honorable awards, including: second prize in harmony (1855), second prize in organ and in harmony (1856), second and third prize in harmony and organ (1857), and second prize in harmony (1859). His cantata Atala was awarded the premier Second Grand Prix of the Prix de Rome in 1861. In the same year Th√©odore Dubois was awarded the first grand prize, and Eug√®ne Anthiome and Titus Constantin won the deuxi√®me Second Grand Prix. In 1863, the architect Th√©odore Ballu began the construction of the √âglise de la Sainte-Trinit√© in Paris. (He had already built the Basilique Sainte-Clotilde in 1861 and would construct the H√¥tel de Ville (City Hall) of Paris some ten years later). Situated in the 9th arrondissement of Paris on Estienne-d'Orves Square, Sainte-Trinit√© was blessed in November 1867. It was not consecrated, however, until 1913, the eve of World War I. The reason for this forty-six year gap is unknown. La Trinit√©, although rather austere, was in that period one of the most important churches in Paris. Among the parishioners of this affluent congregation were Charles Gounod and Georges Bizet, who were both quite fond of Salom√©. Gounod sent several students to Salom√© for organ lessons, including his dear friend, Paul Poirson. Jules Massenet, Ambroise Thomas and Fran√ßois Bazin also sent composition students to him. Aristide Cavaill√©-Coll installed in this new church a grand organ of 46 ranks across three manuals and pedal, which was inaugurated March 16, 1869 by Camille Saint-Sa√´ns, C√©sar Franck, and Charles-Marie Widor. At the same time, Cavaill√©-Coll also built a choir organ of 12 ranks over two manuals and pedal. Th√©odore Salom√©, who had already occupied the post of choir organist for several years on a temporary organ, continued his services in this position until his death in 1895. Claude Terrasse, better known for his operettas (Monsieur de la Palisse, Le mariage de T√©l√©maque, and Cartouche) rather than for his activities as a liturgical organist, succeeded him, a peculiar choice. Upon the completion of the new Cavaill√©-Coll grand organ, Charles-Alexis Chauvet was awarded the post of organiste titulaire, which he held for only three years. And, upon Chauvet's untimely death in 1871, his post of was awarded to Alexandre Guilmant. Replacing Guilmant at the grand organ during the latter's concert tours in the United States. Guilmant and Salom√© became great friends, dedicating numerous compositions to each other. Th√©odore Salom√© played for masses and religious services with great talent and knowledge. His religious compositions were often sung by the choir of Sainte-Trinit√©, which was composed of some 20 children and 10 professional singers, under the capable direction of their choirmaster, Emile Bouichere. It was there, that on the 5th of June 1875, that Salom√© presided at the organ for the funeral mass of Georges Bizet, in the presence of 4000 people. For a pr√©lude, Salom√© improvised on themes from Bizet's opera Les p√™cheurs de perles (\\"The Pearl Fishers\\") then during the absolution improvised on themes from Carmen. √âglise de la Sainte-Trinit√© towards Montmartre. Saint-Sa√´ns highly recommended Salom√© for the post as organiste titulare at La Trinit√© upon the death of Alexis Chauvet. In a letter to the pastor, Saint-Sa√´ns writes: :\\"Permit me to recommend to you a young organist whom I am interested in your extending the warmest welcome. I had chosen him to replace me at the grand organ of the Madeleine, and I can add that he has fulfilled this task in the most brilliant fashion. I have only heard compliments. Your grand organ is destined for M. Salom√© ‚Äì and you couldn't make a better choice.\\" Gounod wrote a letter to the pastor some four weeks later (a bit too late) after Guilmant was to be hired: :\\"I have learned in London at this very moment from one of my friends, the death of the poor organist Chauvet, [titulare] of the grand organ of our parish. It is a great loss! There are few Chauvets, unfortunately. But, I have learned at the same time that the position will be given to a Belgian organist, whose name I do not know. It seems to me very regrettable in the midst of so much French sorrow, to have looked at a foreigner when you have there, under your hand, a true talent, the young Salom√© who should be able to be promoted to this position. God keeps me, monsieur le cur√©, from any unforgettable gesture, but if you pardon me and permit me, and even approve my bringing these claims. I esteem that the master who is at our door [Salom√©] is better than one from abroad; he belongs to us. I hope that you will not make a lie of the proverb: A prophet is not welcome in his own land. Receive, dear monsieur le cur√©, my sentiments of profound regret.\\" Bizet also offered to write a recommendation for Salom√©, but to no avail. Salom√© sat in on juries, solf√®ge and composition exams at the Conservatoire de Paris when available, but his church work always came first.In two letters to Ambroise Thomas (n.d.), Salom√© regrets to inform Thomas that he cannot help at the exams because of his church commitments. He even wrote to his pastor in August 1887 asking for a raise to at least as much as what his colleagues at the churches of Saint-Augustin, Saint-Louis, and La Madeleine were making.In a letter of the 16 August 1887, Salom√© asks his pastor for a raise, as his responsibilities had increased over the previous few years, and he had not been compensated for the extra work. He asked for a total of 600 [francs] more (including the mere 25 that he had received each year for five previous years). Th√©odore Salom√© His pieces for piano, with charming and evocative names, were included in the \\"Pantheon of Pianists\\" published by the Parisian editor Henry Lemoine at the beginning of the 20th century: Aubade (\\"Dawn serenade\\"), op. 38; Berceuse (\\"Lullaby\\"), op. 36; Le Bocage (\\"The wooded farmland\\"), op. 51; Danse mauresque (\\"Moorish dance\\"), op. 34; Fleur d'Aragon (\\"Flower of Aragon\\"), op. 35; Rose de mai (\\"May rose\\"), op. 33; Tante Aurore (\\"Aunt Aurora\\"), op. 32; Vieille chanson (\\"Old song\\"), op.31. In addition to his piano pieces, there exists some symphonic fragments of his compositions that were performed by the Soci√©t√© Nationale de Musique in 1877. These compositions aroused the interest of the specialists who found them excellent writing which portended a brilliant future for the composer. Th√©odore Salom√©, however, preferred to dedicate himself entirely to his activities as organist and choirmaster. Upon her visit to La Trinit√© in November 1893, Fannie Edgar Thomas, \\"Church Music Correspondent\\" for the New York Musical Courier, described M. Salom√©, at age 59, as a handsome man \\"with his fine silver hair, slender, gentle face, pink cheeks, tender mouth and appealing brown eyes, dressed in an easy dark coat and vest, with gray trousers, and no evident personal ambition.\\" Eighteen years earlier, in 1875, he married C√©leste Condrot, and moved into his new home at 70, rue Saint-Lazare, just one block from La Trinit√©. Fifteen years his junior, C√©leste gave birth to a son ‚Äì their only child, Ren√©. He was seen by his friends as a poet, or man of letters, who never married. It appears that they were a close family, with particular devotion to his mother-in-law, Virginie-Marie Condrot. In 1885, Salom√© composed his Offertoire pour grand orgue (in D-flat), published in Paris by Mackar and dedicated to his mother-in-law, Madame V. Condrot. This piece gained immense popularity in America. Alexandre Guilmant performed the work in his first recital on his American Tour in 1893 and at the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis.Other Salom√© compositions performed in America by Guilmant were the Sonata (op. 25), Andante espressivo (\\"Cantil√®ne\\", Dix pi√®ces vol. 1, no. 9) It was also one of the most popular rolls that was available in Estey Pipe Organ Roll Collection.The Estey Pipe Organ Roll Library had three compositions by Salom√©: Cantilene (#306), Offertoire in D-flat (#437) and Grand Chorus (#577). The piece was subsequently published in America by G. Schirmer alone and then in various Victorian collections.Collections containing the \\"Offertoire in D-flat\\" include: The Organ Player, Preston Ware Orem; The Contemporary Organist, Chas. H. Morse (Theodore Presser, 1904) Salom√© himself, even transcribed this piece for full orchestra under the title S√©r√©nade (Mackar et No√´l, 1892). John Henderson states that \\"the Offertoire in D-flat has to be one of the worst pieces of organ music ever written!\\" In 1896, Salom√© and his family took sabbatical in the Parisian suburb of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) where they made their home to the end of their lives, never returning to the church. The Musical Courier of August 12, 1896 published the following obituary by William C. Carl: :\\"Last week the sad news of M. Th√©odore Salom√©‚Äôs death was received, and M. Guilmant was very much affected by it, as they had been together at La Trinit√© for twenty-five years, and naturally there was a strong bond of friendship. M. Salom√© was only ill for about ten days, and his sudden death was a surprise to all, and greatly regretted by everyone. He had much talent and was an artist of high rank. M. Salom√© was of a retiring disposition, but with a most amiable and attractive manner that made one feel at once that he was their friend. :His funeral was held at Saint-Germain, in the √©glise paroissiale, on Wednesday, July 22. Mr. Guilmant played the grand organ, choosing for the selections: First, pr√©lude in E minor, J. S. Bach , and second, the Absoute, by M. Salom√©. :M. Caron [baritone soloist from La Trinit√© connected with the Grand Op√©ra] sang his Pie Jesu, and his cantabile for violin was also played. :The choir of La Trinit√© rendered the music under the direction of M. Planchet (the ma√Ætre de chapelle). :I know that M. Salom√©'s death will be much regretted in America, where his music has found much favor and is frequently performed.\\" A much shorter obituary followed in The Musical Times of September 1, praising Salom√© for his organ compositions \\"which are greatly esteemed by organists of this country [America]. :\\"Parallel to his activities at Sainte-Trinit√©, our Prix de Rome winner Monsieur Salom√©, was also professor of solf√®ge at the National Conservatory of Music of Paris, professor of Music at the College Rollin, as well as choirmaster at the Saint-Louis School. :Th√©odore Salom√© left some very admirable pages for the organ, among which one remembers a collection of Dix Pi√®ces pour orgue in three volumes and another of Douze Pi√®ces Nouvelles pour orgue, published by Leduc. Volume 3 of Ma√Ætres parisiens de l‚Äôorgue au XXe si√®cle (1936) contains two of Salom√©‚Äôs canons (op. 21, nos. 1 and 3). :Despite M. Salom√©‚Äôs position among the major figures in European composition during the second half of the nineteenth century, it was probably the change of aesthetic orientation which began abouround the start of the 20th century leading to a radical move away from the conservative-classical ideals to which he (like Guilmant and Dubois) had felt committed, that led to his demise among organ repertoire.\\" Th√©odore Salom√©, his wife, and son share the Condrot-Gault family mausoleum at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery, which includes a moss encrusted granite sculpture of a prie-dieu with an open covered book.

Dentex have 11 dorsal spines: 11‚Äì12 dorsal soft rays; 3 anal spines: 7‚Äì9 anal soft rays. Adults are grey-blue, while young dentex have a slightly different livery, brown-blue with blue fins.  Biology  Dentex is an active predator, feeding on other fish, mollusca and cephalopods. It is solitary for most of the year, but during reproduction it lives in groups for some weeks: fully-grown dentex stay together just two to three weeks during spring in the warmer water near the surface.  Distribution and habitat  Dentex is common in the Mediterranean Sea, but also seen in the Black Sea and the Eastern Atlantic Ocean from the British Isles to Mauritania, sometimes up to Senegal and Canary Islands.

It is now based at the Louvre, in the pavillon Mollien.  History  The Acad√©mie celtique was founded by prefect Jacques Cambry, Jacques-Antoine Dulaure and Jacques Le Brigant on 9 germinal Year XII (30 March 1804), with the goal of studying Gallic civilization and French history and archaeology. Cambry was its first president, until his death in 1807. In 1813 it changed its name to the Soci√©t√© des Antiquaires de France, after the Society of Antiquaries of London, and from 1814 to 1848 it changed again to the Soci√©t√© royale des antiquaires de France under the Bourbon Restoration. According to the regime in France, it was then called the Soci√©t√© imp√©riale des antiquaires de France or Soci√©t√© nationale des antiquaires de France, but it re-assumed its present name in 1871, and has not changed it since.

As he was well respected for his piety, faith, and supposed performance of miracles, Mavia, an Arab warrior-queen, made his consecration as bishop over her people a condition of any truce with Rome.Jensen, 1996, pp. 73-75. Moses had no fixed see after his consecration as bishop, journeying instead with his nomadic flock, converting many of them, and keeping peace between the different tribes and the Roman imperial authorities. Biography It is not known when he was born, but for some time in the 4th century, Moses, like his ancient namesake, spent many years travelling and preaching in the wilderness in the border region between Egypt and Syria.Ball, 2001, pp. 100-101. His life of preaching attracted him a large following among eastern Monophysites in general and Arabs in particular. This reputation was noted by Socrates of Constantinople, who describes him as \\"a Saracen by birth, who led a monastic life in the desert\\", who had become \\"exceedingly eminent for his piety, faith and miracles.\\" Socrates' description of Moses comes by way of his retelling of the exploits of Queen Mavia, who promised to end her armed revolt against the Roman empire on the condition that Moses be \\"constituted bishop over her nation.\\" Valens, the Roman emperor, had no choice but to accept. Mavia's forces, originating in southern Syria, had defeated those of Rome's on multiple occasions, marching through Palestine and Phoenicia, to reaching the frontier with Egypt. Moses also refused to be ordained by the Arian patriarchal see at Alexandria, choosing to be consecrated by orthodox bishops living in exile instead. In some accounts, Moses is said to have been nabbed by Roman imperial troops to be taken to be ordained. It is for this reason that he is sometimes confused with Moses the Black, another saint of the region, who is thought to have died some sixty years after he did. Notable mentions in history Pope Gregory III (731-741) recalled the example of Moses as a monk turned bishop, in a dialogue with the nephew of St. Boniface, when trying to convince him to join his uncle at the German mission. Irfan Shahid writes: \\"Thus an Arab monk bishop was presented as a model for the English saint.\\"Shahid, 1995, p. 214.

Gableman was born in West Allis, Wisconsin in 1966 and raised in Waukesha County. He is a graduate of New Berlin West High School (1984) and Ripon College (1988), where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in education and history. He holds a teaching certificate for 7-12 grade history. After college, Gableman taught American history at George Washington High School in the Milwaukee Public School system (1988‚Äì1989) before pursuing a legal career. He graduated from Hamline University School of Law in 1993. Career After graduating, he served as a law clerk at the district court level in Minnesota and the circuit court level in Wisconsin. He became the half-time Assistant District Attorney in Langlade County and worked the other half time at a private law office while also serving as Deputy Corporation Counsel for Forest County. Gableman then worked as an assistant district attorney in Marathon County. He served as District Attorney of Ashland County from 1999-2002. In 2002, he was appointed the circuit court judge for Burnett County, and then elected Circuit Court Judge for Burnett County in 2003, with 78% of the vote. In Burnett County, Gableman established an inmate community service program, a juvenile community service program, a drug and alcohol court, and a restorative justice program for which he served as chairman of the board for six years. He also was an adjunct professor of law at Hamline University School of Law, teaching criminal procedure and professional responsibility.

A Gi, meaning dress or clothes, is typically composed of a heavy cotton jacket, reinforced drawstring trousers, and a belt which communicates rank. The Brazilian jiu-jitsu gi is also sometimes referred to as kimono by non-Japanese speakers. Some Jiu-Jitsu school systems avoid using a gi.https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mgyz8n/inside-eddie-bravos-10th- planet-jiu-jitsu General regulations The only colors allowed for international championships are white, black or blue. In some jurisdictions this is relaxed to allow any single solid color. According to article 8 of IBJJF rules, a competition gi must conform to these specifications: * The gi must be constructed of cotton or similar material and be in good condition. The material may not be excessively thick or hard to the point where it will obstruct the opponent. * Colors may be black, white or blue, no combined colors (white kimono with blue pants, etc.) * The jacket is to be of sufficient length down to the thighs, sleeves must reach the wrist with arms extended in front of the body. The sleeve should follow the official measurements according to IBJJF (this is measured from the shoulder to the wrist). * Belt width must be 4‚Äì5 cm, with belt color corresponding to the practitioner's rank. The belt must be tied around the waist with a double knot, tight enough to secure the kimono closed. An extremely worn/discoloured belt may need to be replaced before competing. * Athletes are not permitted to compete with torn kimonos, sleeves or pants that are not of proper length, or with T-shirts underneath the kimono (except for females). * A BJJ practitioner is not allowed to paint his/her gi. Exceptions can be made for teams competition. In addition to the above requirements, pockets of any kind are not allowed in a gi used at tournaments. A special gi checking tool is sometimes used to determine acceptable measurements and fit of the gi. This tool resembles a block of wood 3.5 cm x 2.5 cm x 15 cm with a slit cut in the middle and is used to measure the following: * The jacket lapel must be 5 cm wide. * There must be at least 7 cm of room from the bottom of the competitor's wrist to the bottom of the sleeve. * The jacket lapel must not be thicker than 1.3 cm. =Patches= According to article 13 of IBJJF rules, patches may be placed on the gi in one of thirteen different locations: On the jacket: * Left upper arm * Left upper shoulder * Front right upper shoulder * Front right upper arm * Front below the belt * Back below the belt * Back below the collar and above the belt On the pants: * Above the front left knee * Above the front right knee * Below the front left knee (with at least 15 cm of space to the floor without patch to allow for grabbing) * Below the front right knee (with at least 15 cm of space to the floor without patch to allow for grabbing) * Along the back of the left leg * Along the back of the right leg Fabric and weave = Pants = Traditionally, gi pants are made of a sturdy cotton canvas, or denim (with reinforced seams/knees). Tough and light weight materials have started to become more popular in recent years as cooler hot weather gis have become more popular. It is common in tournaments to see competitors wearing ripstop pants with a standard cotton gi top. = Jacket = Single Weave Cotton: This is lighter and typically less expensive. It is often used for hot weather training. Being lighter weight (typically between 300‚Äì550 g/m2), this weave is not as durable as a heavier fabric. Gold Weave Cotton: This material is in-between the single and double weave with regards to weight and durability. Gold weave is a standard that was originally required for competition by the Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Confederation, although this has now been relaxed to allow different jacket weaves. Double Weave Cotton: This gi top is made of significantly more fabric than a single weave. It is heavier, harder wearing, and is typically more expensive. The thickness of the gi can make it more difficult for an opponent to grip the fabric, but the weight of the gi (typically between 650‚Äì1050 g/m2) makes them retain more heat. The stiffness of the material can make double weaves more abrasive on the skin of opponents and wearers alike. Ripstop Fabrics: Ripstop fabrics are made of many different materials (cotton, silk, polyester, and nylon) woven together to produce an extremely strong and light weight material that is difficult to tear or rip. Due to the weave of the material this type of Gi top can be made light weight (lighter than a single weave gi) while still remaining strong. Since this material is woven thinner than cotton gis, an opponent can more easily grab and manipulate it. File:Cropped Blue Double Weave Kimono Close Up.pngCloseup of double weave pattern on an HCK competition double gi. File:Close Up of White Gold Weave BJJ Gi (Cropped).jpgCloseup of gold weave pattern on an OTM blank white gi. Maintenance Due to the nature of wrestling/grappling and the diseases that can come from close contact between people, the gi is typically washed after each class. As with most cotton products, a cotton gi must be laundered in cold water and line dried to avoid shrinkage. This is important to most Jiu- Jitsu practitioners as even pre-shrunk gi material has a tendency to shrink further in hot water and a hot dryer cycle. To preserve the life of the gi, bleaching is highly discouraged, as this can weaken the fibers of the material and cause them to tear more easily. Line drying in bright sunlight is commonly suggested to help remove smells from the gi, due to the bacterial killing properties of UV light. Hanging the gi in direct sunlight can damage the integrity of the fabric and reduce its durability, and can also stiffen up fibres in a gi. While most gis sold today are made of a colorfast material, some manufacturers recommend that a darker coloured gi (blue, black, red, etc.) be washed with 2-3 cups of white vinegar the first time that the outfit is laundered. This helps to set the dye in the gi and will minimize fading. It is advised to leave a gi to dry in indirect sunlight, and avoid drying in drying machines, as this can cause shrinkage. Similarity to the judogi Judogi as worn at the 1951 All-Japan Judo Championships The Jiu-Jitsu gi is similar to the judogi with a few slight differences. Jiu jitsu regulations allow for tighter cuffs on the pants and jacket, and the skirt (section of the gi beneath the belt) is shorter. This allows the practitioner to benefit from a closer fit, providing less material for an opponent to manipulate. Team, sponsor, and manufacturer's patches are often more prominently displayed on a Jiu-Jitsu gi than would be allowed in judo. A judo gi may be worn for BJJ tournaments, but a Jiu-Jitsu gi will not meet guidelines for a judo tournament.

Conceptually, this is achieved by explicitly modelling the individual sampling probability of each observation (the so-called selection equation) together with the conditional expectation of the dependent variable (the so-called outcome equation). The resulting likelihood function is mathematically similar to the Tobit model for censored dependent variables, a connection first drawn by James Heckman in 1976. Heckman also developed a two- step control function approach to estimate this model, which avoids the computional burden of having to estimate both equations jointly, albeit at the cost of inefficiency. Heckman received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2000 for his work in this field.  Method  Statistical analyses based on non-randomly selected samples can lead to erroneous conclusions. The Heckman correction, a two-step statistical approach, offers a means of correcting for non-randomly selected samples. Heckman discussed bias from using nonrandom selected samples to estimate behavioral relationships as a specification error. He suggests a two-stage estimation method to correct the bias. The correction uses a control function idea and is easy to implement. Heckman‚Äôs correction involves a normality assumption, provides a test for sample selection bias and formula for bias corrected model. Suppose that a researcher wants to estimate the determinants of wage offers, but has access to wage observations for only those who work. Since people who work are selected non-randomly from the population, estimating the determinants of wages from the subpopulation who work may introduce bias. The Heckman correction takes place in two stages. In the first stage, the researcher formulates a model, based on economic theory, for the probability of working. The canonical specification for this relationship is a probit regression of the form : \\\\operatorname{Prob}( D = 1  Z ) = \\\\Phi(Z\\\\gamma), where D indicates employment (D = 1 if the respondent is employed and D = 0 otherwise), Z is a vector of explanatory variables, \\\\gamma is a vector of unknown parameters, and Œ¶ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution. Estimation of the model yields results that can be used to predict this employment probability for each individual. In the second stage, the researcher corrects for self-selection by incorporating a transformation of these predicted individual probabilities as an additional explanatory variable. The wage equation may be specified, : w^* = X\\\\beta + u where w^* denotes an underlying wage offer, which is not observed if the respondent does not work. The conditional expectation of wages given the person works is then : E [ w  X, D=1 ] = X\\\\beta + E [ u  X, D=1 ]. Under the assumption that the error terms are jointly normal, we have : E [ w  X, D=1 ] = X\\\\beta + \\\\rho\\\\sigma_u \\\\lambda(Z\\\\gamma), where œÅ is the correlation between unobserved determinants of propensity to work \\\\varepsilon and unobserved determinants of wage offers u, œÉ u is the standard deviation of u , and \\\\lambda is the inverse Mills ratio evaluated at Z\\\\gamma . This equation demonstrates Heckman's insight that sample selection can be viewed as a form of omitted-variables bias, as conditional on both X and on \\\\lambda it is as if the sample is randomly selected. The wage equation can be estimated by replacing \\\\gamma with Probit estimates from the first stage, constructing the \\\\lambda term, and including it as an additional explanatory variable in linear regression estimation of the wage equation. Since \\\\sigma_u > 0, the coefficient on \\\\lambda can only be zero if \\\\rho=0, so testing the null that the coefficient on \\\\lambda is zero is equivalent to testing for sample selectivity. Heckman's achievements have generated a large number of empirical applications in economics as well as in other social sciences. The original method has subsequently been generalized, by Heckman and by others.  Statistical inference  The Heckman correction is a two-step M-estimator where the covariance matrix generated by OLS estimation of the second stage is inconsistent. Correct standard errors and other statistics can be generated from an asymptotic approximation or by resampling, such as through a bootstrap.  Disadvantages  * The two-step estimator discussed above is a limited information maximum likelihood (LIML) estimator. In asymptotic theory and in finite samples as demonstrated by Monte Carlo simulations, the full information (FIML) estimator exhibits better statistical properties. However, the FIML estimator is more computationally difficult to implement. * The canonical model assumes the errors are jointly normal. If that assumption fails, the estimator is generally inconsistent and can provide misleading inference in small samples. Semiparametric and other robust alternatives can be used in such cases. * The model obtains formal identification from the normality assumption when the same covariates appear in the selection equation and the equation of interest, but identification will be tenuous unless there are many observations in the tails where there is substantial nonlinearity in the inverse Mills ratio. Generally, an exclusion restriction is required to generate credible estimates: there must be at least one variable which appears with a non-zero coefficient in the selection equation but does not appear in the equation of interest, essentially an instrument. If no such variable is available, it may be difficult to correct for sampling selectivity.

It generates all algebra elements from its own elements by the algebra operations in an independent manner. It also represents the endomorphisms of an algebra by certain indexings of algebra elements, which can correspond to the usual matrices when the free algebra is a vector space.  Definitions  A basis (or reference frame) of a (universal) algebra is a function b that takes some algebra elements as values b(i) and satisfies either one of the following two equivalent conditions. Here, the set of all b(i) is called the basis set, whereas several authors call it the \\"basis\\".Gould.Gr√§tzer 1968, p.198. The set I of its arguments i is called the dimension set. Any function, with all its arguments in the whole I, that takes algebra elements as values (even outside the basis set) will be denoted by m. Then, b will be an m. = Outer condition = This condition will define bases by the set L of the I-ary elementary functions of the algebra, which are certain functions \\\\ell that take every m as argument to get some algebra element as value \\\\ell(m). In fact, they consist of all the projections p_i with i in I, which are the functions such that p_i(m) = m(i) for each m, and of all functions that rise from them by repeated \\"multiple compositions\\" with operations of the algebra. (When an algebra operation has a single algebra element as argument, the value of such a composed function is the one that the operation takes from the value of a single previously computed I-ary function as in composition. When it does not, such compositions require that many (or none for a nullary operation) I-ary functions are evaluated before the algebra operation: one for each possible algebra element in that argument. In case I and the numbers of elements in the arguments, or ‚Äúarity‚Äù, of the operations are finite, this is the finitary multiple composition .) Then, according to the outer condition a basis b has to generate the algebra (namely when \\\\ell ranges over the whole L, \\\\ell(b) gets every algebra element) and must be independent (namely whenever any two I-ary elementary functions coincide at b, they will do everywhere: \\\\ell'(b)=\\\\ell(b) implies \\\\ell'=\\\\ell).For instance, see (Gr√§tzer 1968, p.198). This is the same as to require that there exists a single function \\\\chi that takes every algebra element as argument to get an I-ary elementary function as value and satisfies \\\\chi({\\\\ell(b)})=\\\\ell for all \\\\ell in L. = Inner condition = This other condition will define bases by the set E of the endomorphisms of the algebra, which are the homomorphisms from the algebra into itself, through its analytic representation \\\\varrho by a basis. The latter is a function that takes every endomorphism e as argument to get a function m as value: \\\\varrho(e)=m, where this m is the \\"sample\\" of the values of e at b, namely m(i)=[\\\\varrho(e)]_i=e(b(i)) for all i in the dimension set. Then, according to the inner condition b is a basis, when \\\\varrho is a bijection from E onto the set of all m, namely for each m there is one and only one endomorphism e such that m=\\\\varrho(e). This is the same as to require that there exists an extension function, namely a function \\\\eta that takes every (sample) m as argument to extend it onto an endomorphism \\\\eta(m) such that \\\\varrho(\\\\eta(m))=m.For instance, see 0.4 and 0.5 of (Ricci 2007) The link between these two conditions is given by the identity [\\\\chi(a)]_m=[\\\\eta(m)]_a, which holds for all m and all algebra elements a.For instance, see 0.4 (E) of (Ricci 2007) Several other conditions that characterize bases for universal algebras are omitted. As the next example will show, present bases are a generalization of the bases of vector spaces. Then, the name \\"reference frame\\" can well replace \\"basis\\". Yet, contrary to the vector space case, a universal algebra might lack bases and, when it has them, their dimension sets might have different finite positive cardinalities.Gr√§tzer 1979.  Examples  = Vector space algebras = In the universal algebra corresponding to a vector space with finite dimension the bases essentially are the ordered bases of this vector space. Yet, this will come after several details. When the vector space is finite-dimensional, for instance I=\\\\\\\\{0, 1, \\\\ldots, n-1\\\\\\\\} with n > 0, the functions \\\\ell in the set L of the outer condition exactly are the ones that provide the spanning and linear independence properties with linear combinations \\\\ell(b)=c_0 b_0+c_1b_1+\\\\ldots c_{n-1}b_{n-1} and present generator property becomes the spanning one. On the contrary, linear independence is a mere instance of present independence, which becomes equivalent to it in such vector spaces. (Also, several other generalizations of linear independence for universal algebras do not imply present independence.) The functions m for the inner condition correspond to the square arrays of field elements (namely, usual vector-space square matrices) that serve to build the endomorphisms of vector spaces (namely, linear maps into themselves). Then, the inner condition requires a bijection property from endomorphisms also to arrays. In fact, each column of such an array represents a vector m(i) as its n-tuple of coordinates with respect to the basis b. For instance, when the vectors are n-tuples of numbers from the underlying field and b is the Kronecker basis, m is such an array seen by columns, \\\\varrho is the sample of such a linear map at the reference vectors and \\\\eta extends this sample to this map as below. {}\\\\qquad \\\\left(\\\\begin{array}{rrc} 0 & -1 & 2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ -2 & 3 & 1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ 1 & 0 & 2 \\\\end{array}\\\\right) \\\\quad \\\\begin{array}{c} \\\\stackrel{\\\\eta}{\\\\longmapsto}\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\stackrel{\\\\varrho}{\\\\longleftarrow\\\\\\\\!\\\\\\\\!{}^{{}_{\\\\\\\\!{}_\\\\mathsf{l}}}} \\\\end{array} \\\\quad \\\\left\\\\\\\\{ \\\\begin{array}{rcrccr} x'_0 & = & & -x_1 &+& 2x_2 \\\\\\\\\\\\ x'_1 & = &-2x_0&+3x_1&+& x_2\\\\\\\\\\\\ x'_2 & = & x_0 & & +&2x_2 \\\\end{array}\\\\right. When the vector space is not finite-dimensional, further distinctions are needed. In fact, though the functions \\\\ell formally have an infinity of vectors in every argument, the linear combinations they evaluate never require infinitely many addenda c_i m(i) and each \\\\ell determines a finite subset J of I that contains all required i. Then, every value \\\\ell(m) equals an \\\\ell'(m'), where m' is the restriction of m to J and \\\\ell' is the J-ary elementary function corresponding to \\\\ell. When the \\\\ell' replace the \\\\ell, both the linear independence and spanning properties for infinite basis sets follow from present outer condition and conversely. Therefore, as far as vector spaces of a positive dimension are concerned, the only difference between present bases for universal algebras and the ordered bases of vector spaces is that here no order on I is required. Still it is allowed, in case it serves some purpose. When the space is zero-dimensional, its ordered basis is empty. Then, being the empty function, it is a present basis. Yet, since this space only contains the null vector and its only endomorphism is the identity, any function b from any set I (even a nonempty one) to this singleton space works as a present basis. This is not so strange from the point of view of universal algebra, where singleton algebras, which are called \\"trivial\\", enjoy a lot of other seemingly strange properties. = Word monoid = Let I=\\\\\\\\{ \\\\mathsf{a, b, c,} \\\\ldots\\\\\\\\} be an \\"alphabet\\", namely a (usually finite) set of objects called \\"letters\\". Let W denote the corresponding set of words or \\"strings\\", which will be denoted as in strings, namely either by writing their letters in sequence or by \\\\epsilon in case of the empty word (formal language notation).Formal Language notation is used in Computer Science and sometimes collides with the set-theoretical definitions of words. See G. Ricci, An observation on a Formal Language notation, SIGACT News, 17 (1972), 18-23. Accordingly, the juxtaposition vw will denote the concatenation of two words v and w, namely the word that begins with v and is followed by w. Concatenation is a binary operation on W that together with the empty word \\\\epsilon defines a free monoid, the monoid of the words on I, which is one of the simplest universal algebras. Then, the inner condition will immediately prove that one of its bases is the function b that makes a single-letter word {i} of each letter \\\\mathsf{i}, b(\\\\mathsf{i})=i. (Depending on the set-theoretical implementation of sequences, b may not be an identity function, namely i may not be \\\\mathsf{i}, rather an object like \\\\\\\\{ (\\\\emptyset,\\\\mathsf{i})\\\\\\\\}, namely a singleton function, or a pair like (\\\\emptyset,\\\\mathsf{i}) or (\\\\mathsf{i},\\\\emptyset).) In fact, in the theory of D0L systems (Rozemberg & Salomaa 1980) such m=\\\\varrho(e) are the tables of \\"productions\\", which such systems use to define the simultaneous substitutions of every i by a single word w=m(\\\\mathsf{i}) in any word u in W: if u={i}_0{i}_1\\\\cdots {i}_k, then e(u)=m(\\\\mathsf{i}_0)m(\\\\mathsf{i}_1)\\\\cdots m(\\\\mathsf{i}_k). Then, b satisfies the inner condition, since the function \\\\varrho is the well-known bijection that identifies every word endomorphism with any such table. (The repeated applications of such an endomorphism starting from a given \\"seed\\" word are able to model many growth processes, where words and concatenation serve to build fairly heterogeneous structures as in L-system, not just \\"sequences\\".)

The Commission was established to examine and recommend improvements to the effectiveness and quality of transition from to return to military service or civilian society, health care, benefits, outreach to Service members and awareness by Service members of health care and benefits programs.  Work process  The Commissioners visited United States Department of Defense (DoD), United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), and private-sector treatment facilities; interviewed injured service members and their families, health care professionals, and program managers; conducted a survey of injured service members; reviewed letters and emails from Service members, veterans, family members, and health care personnel; and analyzed recommendations of past commissions and task forces. This Commission had the unique task of evaluating the entire continuum of care instead of analyzing discrete systems and processes as similar commissions had done.  Findings  The Commission found consistent reports of high-quality battlefield medicine care provided by military and VA medical staff. Many of the report's findings focused on \\"seriously injured\\" service members, as identified by receipt of the one-time payment from Traumatic Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance to severely injured service members. The Commission found strong correlation between the feedback received about DoD/VA health care and the feedback typically received about health care from the private sector, such as poor care coordination and continuity, ineffective information technology systems, enduring stigma threatening those who seek mental health care, and inadequate long-term rehabilitation and staff shortages.  Recommendations  This Commission made six recommendations with \\"action steps\\" to implement each recommendation.

Solange Michel (27 November 1912 ‚Äì 15 December 2010) was a French classical mezzo-soprano who sang in concerts, recitals, and operas from the 1930s to the 1970s. She was particularly associated with the French opera repertory and was one of the most popular interpreters of the title heroine in Georges Bizet's Carmen in post World War II France. Life and career Born Solange Boulesteix in Paris, Michel studied at the Conservatoire de Paris under Thomas Salignac and Andr√© Gresse. She began her career as a concert singer, giving her first performance on French Radio in 1936, and made her stage debut in 1942, as Charlotte in Werther. In 1945, she changed her name to Solange Michel and became a member of the Op√©ra-Comique where she debuted as Mignon. Shortly afterwards, she was invited to perform at the Paris Opera, and quickly established herself as the most important mezzo of her era. Her interpretation of Carmen is now widely regarded as a classic. Other notable roles included; Charlotte, Dalila in Camille Saint-Sa√´ns's Samson et Dalila, Genevi√®ve in Claude Debussy's Pell√©as et M√©lisande, Marguerite in Hector Berlioz's La damnation de Faust, and Orfeo in Christoph Willibald Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice.

History WKLO-TV originally broadcast on channel 21 as an ABC and DuMont affiliate,The DuMont Television Network: Appendix Ten - A trail of bleached bones using the personnel and facilities of WKLO radio. Since very few television sets at that time could receive a UHF signal, WKLO-TV was at a disadvantage against the two existing VHF stations, WAVE-TV and WHAS-TV. The Louisville market has always been fairly large geographically, and UHF stations have never carried very far across large areas. This made advertisers reluctant to purchase commercial time on the station. Due to channel 21's signal issues, ABC allowed WAVE-TV and WHAS-TV to cherry-pick its stronger programming. Under the circumstances, channel 21 never had a profitable audience and suspended operations in 1954 after just six months on air.

It lies in the north-central part of the county, approximately 85 miles east of Lubbock. History In response to the growing number of families settling in the northern part of King County at the start of the 20th century, a school was established in 1901 to serve area students. Ora Blackwell served as the first teacher in the community, which was then known as Bala. Her sister, Mrs. Charles Davidson, was the local postmaster; the Bala post office was housed in the Davidson family home. Jim Goodwin built a cotton gin in Bala in 1908, stimulating limited growth. Sometime between 1911 and 1912 the community's name was changed from Bala to Grow. As was the case with all of the other communities in sparsely populated King County, Grow has remained a largely rural community throughout its existence. Its population hovered at 25 or so residents throughout the 1920s and 1930s and though the post office closed in 1930, the population high mark came in 1941 when Grow was reportedly home an estimated 150 people. However, economic changes led most residents to relocate to urban areas and by the end of the 1950s, almost half of Grow's inhabitants had moved away. By 1970, the Grow school had long since consolidated with Guthrie schools, and local estimates suggested the population had fallen to 85; by 1980 this had fallen to 70, a figure Grow has maintained consistently since.

Club career =Ternana Calcio= Ricchiuti was born in Argentina but moved to Italy in his teens to join Ternana Calcio, in 1994, and the team was then playing in Serie D. His professional career started with the club, where he made 24 first team appearances and scored 1 goal over the course of two full seasons. =Genoa C.F.C.= Following two seasons with Ternana Calcio, Ricchiuti transferred to Genoa CFC in the summer of 1996. He would again spend two seasons, before transferring again. In his two-year spell with the Ligurian club, Ricchiuti mad just 10 league appearances and hence, was sold to then-Serie C side Carpi F.C. 1909, in 1998. =Carpi F.C. 1909= After two unsuccessful seasons at Genoa, Ricchiuti joined Carpi F.C. 1909 in 1998, and went on to make 18 appearances as a regular starter for the club, in just 6 months. The player also notched a goal. Following this short lived success with Carpi, the young Argentine was linked to a host of Argentine clubs, amongst several Serie B teams. =A.C. Pistoiese= Ricchiuti officially transferred to A.C. Pistoiese in 1998, and soon became a key part of the club's starting formation. In just one and half seasons, the young midfielder managed an impressive 42 league starts and also 3 goals. His impressive displays lead to his eventual transfer to Serie B side A.S. Livorno Calcio. =A.S. Livorno Calcio= A new Serie B adventure came about in 2000, after Ricchiuti transferred to A.S. Livorno Calcio. His adventure with the club was a short one, however, as he transferred to A.C. Arezzo, after making just 12 league appearances for the Amaranto. =A.C. Arezzo= Ricchiuti again transferred clubs in 2000, and went on to make 27 appearances, scoring 7 goals in his first season, and soon became a fan favorite within the squad. In his second season with the Tuscan club, Ricchiuti made an additional 21 appearances, scoring 3 goals. He was set for another transfer, however, in the winter of 2002, and he did indeed transfer to Serie C2 club, Rimini Calcio F.C., where his career really took off. =Rimini Calcio= In January 2002, the young attacker, transferred to Rimini Calcio F.C., who were then playing their football in the Serie C2. In his first half-season, Ricchiuti made 11 starts, and remained at the club, where he again thrived during the 2002‚Äì03 season, in which he made 32 league starts, scoring 4 goals, helping his team earn promotion to the Serie C1. The following season, the player made a hefty impact in the clubs return to the Italian third division, where he made 34 league appearances and also scored an additional 4 goals. During the 2004‚Äì05 season, he was undesputadly a starter yet again, and went on to score a career best 12 goals in 33 league matches. His impressive performances helped guide his team to another promotion, this time into the Serie B. In his first full Serie B season, Ricchiuti tallied 40 first team league matches, and scored 11 goals. On the opening day of the Serie B 2006‚Äì07 season, Ricchiuti scored the equalizer in a league match against Juventus, which is notable for being the first goal conceded by Juve during their one-year stay in the second tier of Italian football following the Calciopoli scandal. He went on to score 7 more goals that season for his club in just over 40 appearances and was now the team captain. He has played for the biancorossi since January 2002. During the 2007‚Äì08 season, the Argentine made 40 more appearances in the biancorossi uniform and tallied an additional 11 goals. In late 2009, Rimini fell to relegation despite Ricchiuti's 5 goals in 40 appearances, and hence the player was set to be transferred. In July 2009, Rimini agreed with Frosinone to sell the player, subject to personal terms. But in August 2009, he was transferred to Calcio Catania. =Calcio Catania= On 6 August 2009 Ricchiuti transferred to Serie A side Calcio Catania, as the Sicilian giants aim to bolster their squad in order to compete for Europa League places for next season. He was used mostly as a so-called \\"super sub\\", in the first portion of the new season under Gianluca Atzori, but following the appointment of Sini≈°a Mihajloviƒá on 8 December 2009, the player broke into the starting line-up often, and managed 3 league goals and 27 league starts in his debut Serie A season. He has since made 86 league appearances for the Sicilians, and his efforts have helped the team to four consecutive (five total) record points totals in the Italian top flight.

Studying plant roots Overview Rhizofiltration is a type of phytoremediation, which refers to the approach of using hydroponically cultivated plant roots to remediate contaminated water through absorption, concentration, and precipitation of pollutants. It also filters through water and dirt. The contaminated water is either collected from a waste site and brought to the plants, or the plants are planted in the contaminated area, where the roots then take up the water and the contaminants dissolved in it. Many plant species naturally uptake heavy metals and excess nutrients for a variety of reasons: sequestration, drought resistance, disposal by leaf abscission, interference with other plants, and defense against pathogens and herbivores.Boyd, R. S. Plants That Hyperaccumulate Heavy Metals. Ed. R. R. Brooks. Willingford, U.K.: CAB International, 1998. 181-201. Some of these species are better than others and can accumulate extraordinary amounts of these contaminants. Identification of such plant species has led environmental researchers to realize the potential for using these plants for remediation of contaminated soil and wastewater. Process This process is very similar to phytoextraction in that it removes contaminants by trapping them into harvestable plant biomass. Both phytoextraction and rhizofiltration follow the same basic path to remediation. First, plants that have stable root systems are put in contact with the contamination to get acclimated to the toxins. They absorb contaminants through their root systems and store them in root biomass and/or transport them up into the stems and/or leaves. The plants continue to absorb contaminants until they are harvested. The plants are then replaced to continue the growth/harvest cycle until satisfactory levels of contaminant are achieved. Both processes are also aimed more toward concentrating and precipitating heavy metals than organic contaminants. The major difference between rhizofiltration and phytoextraction is that rhizofiltration is used for treatment in aquatic environments, while phytoextraction deals with soil remediation. Applications Weeping willows Rhizofiltration may be applicable to the treatment of surface water and groundwater, industrial and residential effluents, downwashes from power lines, storm waters, acid mine drainage, agricultural runoffs, diluted sludges, and radionuclide-contaminated solutions. Plants suitable for rhizofiltration applications can efficiently remove toxic metals from a solution using rapid-growth root systems. Various terrestrial plant species have been found to effectively remove toxic metals such as Cu2+, Cd2+, Cr6+, Ni2+, Pb2+, and Zn2+ from aqueous solutions.Dushenkov, Viatcheslav, Harry Motto, Ilya Raskin, and P.b.a. Nanda Kumar. \\"Rhizofiltration: the Use of Plants to Remove Heavy Metals From Aqueous Streams.\\" Environmental Science & Technology 30 (1995): 1239-1245. It was also found that low level radioactive contaminants can successfully be removed from liquid streams.EPA, 1998, A Citizen's Guide to Phytoremediation, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response, EPA 542-F-98-011, August. A system to achieve this can consist of a ‚Äúfeeder layer‚Äù of soil suspended above a contaminated stream through which plants grow, extending the bulk of their roots into the water. The feeder layer allows the plants to receive fertilizer without contaminating the stream, while simultaneously removing heavy metals from the water.Raskin, Ilya, Robert D. Smith, and David E. Salt. \\"Phytoremediation of Metals: Using Plants to Remove Pollutants from the Environment.\\" Current Opinion in Biotechnology. 8:2 (1997): 221-226. Trees have also been applied to remediation. Trees are the lowest cost plant type. They can grow on land of marginal quality and have long life-spans. This results in little or no maintenance costs. The most commonly used are willows and poplars, which can grow 6 - 8‚Äô per year and have a high flood tolerance. For deep contamination, hybrid poplars with roots extending 30 feet deep have been used. Their roots penetrate microscopic scale pores in the soil matrix and can cycle 100 L of water per day per tree. These trees act almost like a pump and treat remediation system.Suthersan, Susan S.

While many of these plants are hyperaccumulators, other plant species can be used as the contaminants do not always reach the shoots (stems and their appendages: leaves, lateral buds, flowering stems and flower buds).

It is relatively inexpensive, yet potentially more effective than comparable technologies. The removal of radionuclides from water using sunflowers was estimated to cost between $2 and $6 per thousand gallons of water treated, including waste disposal and capital costs.Cooney, C M. \\"Sunflowers Remove Radionuclides From Water in Ongoing Phytoremediation Field Tests.\\" Environmental Science and Technology 30 (1996): 194. Advantages Rhizofiltration is a contamination treatment method that may be conducted in situ, with plants being grown directly in the contaminated water body or ex situ, where plants are grown off-site and later introducted to the contaminated water body. This allows for a relatively inexpensive procedure with low capital and operational costs, depending on the type of contaminant. In some cases, contaminants have been shown to be significantly decreased in a very short amount of time. One study found that roots of sunflower reduced levels of Uranium by nearly 95% in just 24 hours. This treatment method is also aesthetically pleasing and results in a decrease of water infiltration and leaching of contaminants. After harvesting, the crop may be converted to biofuel briquette, a substitute for fossil fuel.Modeling rhizofiltration: heavy-metal uptake by plant roots P. Verma*, K. V. George, H. V. Singh, S. K. Singh, A. Juwarkar and R. N. Singh National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), Nehru Marg, Nagpur 440 020, India Disadvantages This contamination treatment method has its limits. Any contaminant that is below the rooting depth will not be extracted. The plants used may not be able to grow in highly contaminated areas. Most importantly, it can take years to reach regulatory levels. This results in long-term maintenance. Also, most contaminated sites are polluted with many different kinds of contaminants. There can be a combination of metals and organics, in which treatment through rhizofiltration will not suffice. Plants grown on polluted water and soils become a potential threat to human and animal health, and therefore, careful attention must be paid to the harvesting process and only non-fodder crop should be chosen for the rhizofiltration remediation method.

The Advocate is the single remaining daily newspaper in Newark. Other early Newark newspapers (all now defunct) included the Newark Weekly American, Newark Leader, and Newark American Tribune. In 1820, a 22-year-old local resident named Benjamin Briggs printed the first issue in a wooden stilt shanty over a frog pond on the west side of what is now Newark's downtown square. Briggs, beset with start-up problems, could only publish three issues in his first five months in business. However, within a year, he was publishing a four-page, four-column paper with the first page devoted to foreign news composed mostly of letters from other papers. During the middle of the century, the paper was a weekly edition, and served as an important regional news source during the American Civil War. In March 1882, the Advocate was sold to John A. Caldwell and soon became a daily newspaper. Today, the Advocate occupies a complex with about 200 employees. It is headquartered at 22 N. First Street in downtown Newark.

These men were famous in the high and late Middle Ages, but the Order was disbanded very suddenly by King Philip IV of France, who took action against the Templars in order to avoid repaying his own financial debts. He accused them of heresy, ordered the arrest of all Templars within his realm, and had many of them burned at the stake. The dramatic and rapid end of the organization led to many stories and legends developing about them over the following centuries. The Order and its members increasingly appear in modern fiction, though most of these references portray the medieval organization inaccurately. In modern works, the Templars generally are portrayed as villains, misguided zealots, representatives of an evil secret society, or as the keepers of a long-lost treasure. Several modern organizations also claim heritage from the medieval Templars, as a way of enhancing their own image or mystique. Modern organizations =Temperance movement= A lodge of the International Order of Good Templars in V√•g√•, Norway. Many temperance organizations named themselves after the Poor Fellow-Soldiers of Christ and of the Temple of Solomon, citing the belief that the original Knights Templar \\"drank sour milk, and also because they were fighting 'a great crusade' against 'this terrible vice' of alcohol.\\" The largest of these, the International Order of Good Templars (IOGT), grew throughout the world after being started in the 19th century and continues to advocate for the abstinence of alcohol and other drugs. Other Orders in this tradition include those of the Templars of Honor and Temperance (Tempel Riddare Orden), which has a large presence in Scandinavia. =Freemasonry= Freemasonry has contained references to the Knights Templar since at least the 18th century; Templar symbols and rituals are incorporated in a number of Masonic bodies. The best- known reference to the Knights Templar in Freemasonry is the Degree of Knight of the Temple, or \\"Order of the Temple\\", the final order joined in \\"The United Religious, Military and Masonic Orders of the Temple and of St John of Jerusalem, Palestine, Rhodes and Malta\\" commonly known as the Knights Templar. Freemasonry is traditionally open to men of all faiths, asking only that they have a belief in a supreme being, but membership in this Masonic body (and others) is open only to Freemasons who profess a belief in the Christian religion. These Knights Templar often take part in public parades and exhibitions, wearing distinctive uniforms and have had a number of high- profile members such as Henry Ford, and Harry S. Truman. In the later 20th century, masonic Knights Templar became the subject of pseudohistorical theories connecting them to the medieval order, even though such a connection is rejected by Masonic authorities themselves and the source known to historians. =Self-styled orders= The Order of the Solar Temple is one infamous example of a \\"neo-Templar\\" group, founded in 1984, that claimed descent from the original Knights Templar; there are several other self-styled orders that also claim to be descended from, or revivals of, the Templar Order. Another Templar-related order, the Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem, is a charitable organization founded in 1804 which has achieved United Nations NGO special status. They are a part of the larger Ordo Supremus Militaris Templi Hierosolymitani (OSMTH), commonly called Knights Templar Worldwide. Some members of the OSMTH claim to be the direct descendants of the original Knights Templar, citing the Larmenius Charter as proof; however, this document is suspected to be a forgery. In May 2018 BBC News reported that since 2015 far-right activist Jim Dowson has been fronting a UK-based anti-immigrant organization, 'Knights Templar International', with Dowson's sister-in-law Marion Thomas named as one of its directors. In April 2019, Knights Templar International and Jim Dowson were banned by Facebook for spreading hate. Scholarly reception The popularity of the Knights Templar in modern fiction and their presence in pseudohistorical or fringe literature has received scholarly attention. At the 2005 Annual Conference of the American Culture Association, their call for papers was specifically about such conspiracy theories relating to the Templars and their association with other legends and mysterious organizations.Masons, Templars and the Holy Grail: Historical Conspiracies and Popular Culture Literary theorists puzzle over Umberto Eco's use in his novel Foucault's Pendulum of the Templars as a symbol of postmodernist rewriting of history. Historian Malcolm Barber writes that \\"Mystic Templars are omnipresent in all good conspiracy theories.\\"Barber's The New Knighthood (Cambridge U Press, 1995) paraphrased by Elaine Graham-Leigh On Day to Day, a program on American NPR, host Alex Chadwick discussed \\"the literary fascination with the Knights Templar.\\"Knights Templar Inspires Trio of Best-Selling Books In Poland, the Toru≈Ñ Museum had an exhibition entitled \\"The Knights Templar ‚Äì History and Myth\\" which offered a description, \\"Apart from pieces of \\"high art\\", the exhibit will grant equal importance to \\"popular culture\\" items (literature, film, Internet content) exploring the subject of the Knights Templar.\\"\\"THE KNIGHTS TEMPLAR - HISTORY AND MYTH\\" at Toru≈Ñ, District Museum, October 23 ‚Äì November 28, 2004 In 2007, a National Post editorial noted that \\"the Templars remain a living presence in popular culture. This has happened precisely because the historical record concerning their sudden annihilation in the early-14th century at the hands of Philip IV (\\"the Fair\\") of France has been so sparse and ambiguous. Time and revolution have damaged and dispersed the sources, and made the Templars a magnet for speculation and imagination.\\"Marni Soupcoff, \\"The Post editorial board: The truth about the Templars \\", National Post (October 22, 2007). Popular themes Popular themes are their supposed association with the Holy Grail and the Ark of the Covenant, and the supposed historical connection to the Freemasons. The historical Templars had their first headquarters on the Temple Mount, which had been assigned to them by King Baldwin II of Jerusalem.Dent, JD. Baldwin II. History Bookshop. Retrieved on 2007-07-17.Adrian J. Boas, Archaeology of The Military Orders: A Survey of The Urban Centres, Rural Settlements and Castles of The Military Orders in The Latin East (c.1120‚Äì1291) (Routledge, 2006). They were in operation there for 75 years. Pseudo-historical books such as The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail theorise that the Templars could have discovered documents hidden in the ruins of the Temple, possibly \\"proving\\" that Jesus survived the Crucifixion or possibly \\"proving\\" Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene and had children by her. Indeed, the supposition that the Templars must have found something under the Temple Mount lies at the heart of most Templar legends and pseudo- historical theories, also popularised by French author Louis Charpentier (1966).Louis Charpentier, Les Myst√®res de la Cath√©drale de Chartres (Paris: Robert Laffont, 1966), translated The Mysteries of Chartres Cathedral (London: Research Into Lost Knowledge Organisation, 1972). There is no physical or documentary evidence, however, to support such a supposition. It is true that they are documented as having carried a piece of the True Cross into some battles,Piers Paul Read, The Templars, p. 159 but this was probably a portion of a timber that was discovered during the 4th century by Saint Helena, the mother of the Emperor Constantine.Read, p. 27 =Relics and treasure= There are various legends concerning a treasure that some Templars managed to hide from King Philip and that was later lost. See p. 472. One particular story concerns Rennes-le-Ch√¢teau, where a treasure was supposedly found in the 19th century; one speculative source for that treasure was the long-lost treasure of the Templars. See p. 240. In a 1910 publication by one Joaqu√≠n Miret y Sans, the case is made that the Knights Templar hid and buried the great treasure in Vrana, Zadar County, because Ram√≥n from Ser√≤ near Granja del Pairs in Noguera (comarca) in Catalonia gave a generous gift to the Knights Templar into the hands of their Grand Master Arnold of Torroja. This Ram√≥n was the son of Romana the daughter of Benesmiro de Siponto who was the justitiarius of Monte Sant'Angelo and who was sent by Pope Alexander III as a notifier to ≈†ibenik.Les cases de Templers y Hospitalers en Catalunya; aplech de noves y documents hist√≤richs (1910), Miret y Sans, Joaqu√≠n, Subject: Templars in Catalonia; Knights of Malta in Catalonia, Publisher: Barcelona Impr. de la Casa Provincial de Caritat.

Schonfield, The Essene Odyssey: The Mystery of The True Teacher and The Essene impact on The Shaping of Human Destiny (Element Books, 1984). argued that the Knights Templar may have found the Copper Scroll treasure of the Qumran Essenes in the tunnels beneath the Temple Mount. He suggested that this might explain one of the charges of heresy which were later brought against the knights by the Medieval Inquisition. Holy Grail The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail (1982) seems to be the source of the story that the Holy Grail was found by the Order and taken to Scotland during the suppression of the order in 1307, where it remains buried beneath Rosslyn Chapel. A book published in 2006 claims that the Grail was instead taken to northern Spain, and protected by the Knights Templar there.Juan Garc√≠a Atienza, The Knights Templar in the Golden Age of Spain: Their Hidden History on the Iberian Peninsula (Destiny Books, 2006). Ark of the Covenant Graham Hancock in his The Sign and the Seal (1992) claimed that the Templars discovered secrets of the Masons, builders of Solomon's Temple, Zerubbabel's Temple, and Herod's Temple at the Temple Mount, along with knowledge that the Ark of the Covenant had been moved to Ethiopia before the destruction of the first temple.Hancock, G: The Sign and the Seal: The Quest for the Lost Ark of the Covenant, Toronto: Doubleday, Hancock claims that allusion to this is made in engravings on the Cathedral at Chartres, the construction of which was greatly influenced by Bernard of Clairvaux, the Order's patron. Further links to both the search by the order for the Ark and to its discovery of ancient secrets of building are supposedly suggested by the existence of the monolithic Church of Saint George in Lalibela, Ethiopia, which stands to this day but whose construction is incorrectly attributed to the Knights Templar. Shroud of Turin Another legendary object that is claimed to have some connection with the Templars is the Shroud of Turin. The shroud was first publicly displayed in 1357 by the widow of a nobleman known as Geoffrey of Charney,Barber, The New Knighthood, p. 332 described by some sources as being a member of the family of the grandson of Geoffroi de Charney, who was burned at the stake with De Molay.Newman, p. 383 In 2009, Barbara Frale, a paleographer in the Vatican Secret Archives, claimed that the Shroud of Turin had been kept by the Templars after 1204. Frale also claimed that \\"the burial certificate of Jesus the Nazarene\\", imprinted in fragments of Greek, Hebrew and Latin writing, is visible on the shroud. The so-called Templecombe painting, a painting discovered in 1945 by Mrs Molly Drew in the roof of an outhouse of a cottage in Templecombe, England,Templecombe in relation to the history of the Knights Templar was mentioned by Charles G. Addison, The History of The Knights Templars, the Temple Church, and The Temple, page 224 (Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans; 1842). has been alleged to be a copy of the image on the Turin Shroud, and therefore evidence of the Turin Shroud being in the possession of the Knights Templar during its \\"hidden years\\".Ian Wilson, The Turin Shroud, (Victor Gollancz Ltd; 1978 ) The painting has been on display in St Mary's Church in the village since 1956 (the only Templar-related site to have survived there), and has been carbon-dated to c. 1280.

Directed and written by Stuart Elliott although it is without a Halo.Karen Ralls, Knights Templar Encyclopedia: The Essential Guide to The People, Places, Events and Symbols of the Order of the Temple, page 202 (Career Press, 2007). =De Molay's curse= Malcolm Barber (2006) discusses a supposed curse uttered by the last Grand Master of the Templar Order, Jacques de Molay, as he was burned at the stake in 1314. Jacques de Molay supposedly cursed Philip IV of France and Pope Clement V, saying that he would meet them before God before the year was out. Pope Clement died only a month later, King Phillip died later that year in a hunting accident. Further, within a short span of years thereafter each of Phillip's sons died at relatively young ages, resulting in the end of the House of Capet, leading to disputes over succession and The Hundred Years' War as different factions battled for the throne. Barber traces this story to a verse chronicle attributed to Geoffrey of Paris (La Chronique m√©trique attribu√©e √† Geffroi de Paris, ed. A. Div√®rres, Strasbourg, 1956, pp. 5711‚Äì5742). Geoffrey of Paris was \\"apparently an eye-witness, who describes Molay as showing no sign of fear and, significantly, as telling those present that God would avenge their deaths\\".Malcolm Barber, The Trial of The Templars, page 357, footnote 110, Second edition (Cambridge University Press, 2006). . In The New Knighthood Barber referred to a variant of this legend, about how an unspecified Templar had appeared before and denounced Clement V and, when he was about to be executed sometime later, warned that both Pope and King would \\"within a year and a day be obliged to explain their crimes in the presence of God\\", found in the work by Ferretto of Vicenza, Historia rerum in Italia gestarum ab anno 1250 ad annum usque 1318 (Malcolm Barber, The New Knighthood, pages 314-315 (Cambridge University Press, 1994). Albert Pike claimed the Knight Kadosh, the 30th degree within the Ancient Accepted and Scottish Rite, commonly known as a 'Vengeance degree', involved the trampling on the Papal tiara and the royal crown, destined to wreak a just vengeance on the high criminals for the murder of de Molay:Arthur Edward Waite, Secret Tradition In Freemasonry, page 497 (Plymouth: The Mayflower Press, 1937). Reprinted by Kessinger Publishing, LLC; 2002. the figure of Hiram Abiff representing Jacques de Molay, with the three assassins representing Philip IV of France, Pope Clement V and Squin de Florian.Arthur Edward Waite, Emblematic Freemasonry and the Evolution of its Deeper Issues, page 98 (London: W. Rider & Son, 1925). Malcolm Barber has cited a Masonic legend, resembling Pike's claims, in Louis Claude Cadet de Gassicourt's Le Tombeau de Jacques Molai (Paris, 1796, first edition).Malcolm Barber, The New Knighthood: A History of the Order of the Temple, page 393, footnote 11 (Cambridge University Press, 2000). A series of mid-20th-century novels, Les Rois maudits (The Accursed Kings) by Maurice Druon, which were first published in 1955, expanded on the story of the curse of Jacques de Molay and the French monarchy in the fourteenth century: A popular version of the legend attributes to the curse the death of Louis XVI, saying he belonged to the thirteenth generation after Philip IV. The thirteenth generation is in fact that of Louis XIV's children.After Philip IV: 1. Louis X, 2. Joan II of Navarre, 3. Charles II of Navarre, 4. Joan of Navarre, 5. Marie of Brittany, 6. Jean II of Alen√ßon, 7. Ren√© of Alen√ßon, 8. Fran√ßoise of Alen√ßon, 9. Antoine of Navarre, 10. Henri IV, 11. Louis XIII, 12. Louis XIV, 13. Louis, Grand Dauphin: 4 generations before Louis XVI. A frequent recurring legend relates how when Louis XVI was guillotined, an anonymous French Freemason rushed from the crowd, dipped his hand in the king's blood (or grabbed the head and held it, or is just heard in the crowd) and yelled, \\"Jacques de Molay, thou art avenged!\\"For example: Daniel-Rops, Henri, Cathedral and Crusade: Studies of the Medieval Church, 1050-1350, pages 577-78 (E.P. Dutton & Co. 1957). =Claims of hidden survival=  Supposed Continuity in Freemasonry  Some historians and authors have tried to draw a link from Freemasonry and its many branches to the Templars. Degrees in the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite such as the Knight of Saint Andrew, the Knight of Rose-Croix, and the 32nd Degree in Consistory make reference to a \\"Masonic Knights Templar\\" connection, but this is usually dismissed as being ceremonial and not historical fact. John J. Robinson argues for the Templar-Masonic connection in his book Born in Blood: The Lost Secrets of Freemasonry, in which he alleges that some French Templars fled to Scotland after the suppression of the Order, fearing persecution from both Church and state. He claims that they sought refuge with a lodge of Scottish stonemasons within which they began to teach the virtues of chivalry and obedience, using the builder‚Äôs tools as a metaphor; and they began eventually taking in \\"speculative masons\\" (men of other professions) in order to ensure the continuation of the Order. According to Robinson, the Order existed in secret in this form until the formation of the United Grand Lodge of England in 1717. An example of Templar-Masonic transitory symbolism can supposedly be found in Rosslyn Chapel, owned by the first Earls of Rosslyn, a family with well-documented ties to Scottish Freemasonry; however, Rosslyn Chapel itself dates from at least 100 years after the suppression of the Templars. The case is also made in Michael Baigent‚Äôs and Richard Leigh‚Äôs book The Temple and the Lodge. However, historians Mark Oxbrow, Ian Robertson,\\"The Da Vinci Connection\\", Sunday Herald, 14 November 2004 Karen Ralls and Louise Yeoman\\"Historian attacks Rosslyn Chapel for 'cashing in on Da Vinci Code'\\", Scotsman.com, 03-May-06 have each made it clear that the Sinclair family had no connection with the Medieval Knights Templar. The Sinclairs‚Äô testimony against the Knights at their 1309 trial is not consistent with any alleged support or membership. In \\"The Templars and the Grail\\"Ralls, Karen, The Templars and the Grail. Quest Books; 1st Quest edition (May 25, 2003), (see p.110 ‚Äì quoting \\"The Knights Templar in England\\" p.200-1) Karen Ralls states that among some 50 who testified against the Templars were Henry and William Sinclair. Knights Templar in Scotland Since the 1980s, there has been a growing body of publications in both popular fiction and pseudohistory which construct a continuity between the historical presence of the Knights Templar in Scotland with the emergence of Masonic Scottish Knights Templar in the early modern period. The idea of an association with Rosslyn Chapel originates in the 1982 The Holy Blood and the Holy Grailwith numerous repetitions during the 1980s to 2000s, see also e.g. Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, The Temple and the Lodge, Arrow, 1998. Tim Wallace-murphy and Marilyn Hopkins, Rosslyn, Guardian of the Secrets of the Holy Grail, Element, 2000, pp120-122 and entered mainstream pop culture with Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code (2003), reinforced by the subsequent film of the same name (2006). Numerous books were published after 2003 to cater to the popular interest in supposed connections between Rosslyn Chapel, Freemasonry, the Templars and the Holy Grail generated by Brown's novel. The tale of a missing Templar fleet is supposedly based on the protocol of the interrogation of Jean de Ch√¢lons by the Inquisition. He claimed that he had heard that preceptor of the French Templars, G√©rard de Villiers, had been warned of his imminent arrest. De Villiers had escaped with 50 horses and eighteen galleys. De Ch√¢lons' son, Hugues de Ch√¢lons, escaped with him carrying the wealth of his uncle, Hugues de Pairaud.Malcolm Barber, The Trial of the Templars, Cambridge University Press, 1993, p101 In Baigent and Leigh's The Temple and the Lodge, the fleet carried the treasure of the Paris preceptory of the Templars.Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh, The Temple and the Lodge, Arrow, 1998, pp100-101 Scotland became the destination of the fleet over four centuries later, in the claims of George Frederick Johnson, an exiled Jacobite living in Austria. Johnson, however, turned out to be a fraudster who was probably called Johann Samuel Leuchte. After a chequered career based on alchemy and forgery, \\"Johnson\\" convinced a masonic lodge in Jena that he possessed the highest secrets of masonry, and having declared the rest of German masonry irregular, brought a surprising amount of lodges under his control. Exposed as a fraud by Karl Gotthelf von Hund in 1764, he was later apprehended by a previous victim, and spent the rest of his life in prison.Ladislas de Malczovich, A Sketch of the Earlier History of Masonry in Austria and Hungary, Ars Quatuor Coronatorum, v6, 1893, pp85-91 Hund's initial attraction to Johnson was spurred by a need to find his own superiors. He had been received into the Order of the Temple by high ranking Jacobites in Paris during 1743, being introduced to Charles Edward Stuart himself. After the failure of the 1745 rebellion, his masters were either in hiding or dead, and had lost interest in maintaining their Templar offshoots, leaving Hund with a depleted ritual book which he had to reconstruct from memory. As Johnson's collection of lodges now looked to him for leadership, the Rite of Strict Observance was born. Again, the foundation myth alleged that Freemasonry was started by Templar refugees under the protection of Robert the Bruce. This time, they had travelled from France through England disguised as stonemasons, and their use of masonic symbols in their allegories paid tribute to this deception.R. F. Gould, A Concise History of Freemasonry. Gale & Poulden, London 1904, pp 411-414 Under Hund's leadership, the Rite of Strict Observance became the most popular branch of Freemasonry in the German states, with lodges all over Continental Europe. However, Hund's continuing inability to produce, or even contact his \\"Unknown Superiors\\" led to increasing dissatisfaction. Six years after his death, a convent meeting in Wilhelmsbad from 1782 to 1783 finally agreed that Freemasonry had no connection to the Templars, and Strict Observance ceased to exist, most lodges being absorbed into the Rectified Scottish Rite. For most of the previous two decades, the most common foundation myth among German masons stated that Freemasonry came from the Knights Templar, protected and allowed to flourish in Scotland.Trevor W. McKeown, The Rite of Strict Observance, Grand Lodge of British Columbia and Yukon A.F. & A. M, 2007, accessed 14 April 2014. Illustration from Sketch of the history of the Knights templars (1840) by James Burnes In 1815, Claude Thory, a respected French scientist and Freemason, claimed that Robert the Bruce had created the Order of St. Andrew for masons who had supported him at Bannockburn, which was later joined to the Order of Heredom, which he founded at Kilwinning.Claude Antoine Thory Acta Latomorum, Paris, 1815, p6 In 1837, a Scottish Freemason, James Burnes, in attempting to revive a Scottish order of \\"Knights Templar\\", expanded the masonic link to Bannockburn. He introduced the Knights Templar as the bearers on Freemasonry to Scotland, and had the Templars play a crucial part in the battle. This appears to be the basis of subsequent tales of Templar involvement at Bannockburn. The contemporary Royal Order of Scotland makes use of a similar foundation myth, which is no more intended to be taken as historical fact than any other piece of masonic allegory.Robert L.D. Cooper, Cracking the Freemason's Code, Rider 2006, pp. 158-160. Discoverers of the New World Holy Blood, Holy Grail (1982) further embellished the \\"lost fleet\\" topos discussed above, alleging that the Templars in these ships \\"fled to the New World by following old Viking routes\\", i.e., making one of the pre-Columbian voyages to America. Since the popularisation of Holy Blood, Holy Grail with the commercial success of Dan Brown's 2003 novel, there have been numerous allusions to this idea in American pop culture. A supposed Templar treasure in Oak Island, Nova Scotia, Canada is featured in the movie National Treasure (2004), starring Nicolas Cage. As early as 2001, historian Helen Nicholson, in a popular history of the Templars, dispels the idea that the Templars could \\"spare ships to indulge in world exploration\\". \\"The Templars did have ships to carry personnel, pilgrims and supplies across the Mediterranean between the West and East and back, but if the Hospital after 1312 is any guide they did not have more than four galleys (warships) and few other ships, and if they needed more they hired them. They certainly could not spare ships to indulge in world exploration ... [T]he records of the port of La Rochelle show that the Templars were exporting wine by ship. This was not a fleet in any modern sense: again, those would have been transport vessels rather than warships, and the Templars probably hired them as they needed them, rather than buying their own. ... The ships would have been very small by modern standards, too shallow in draught and sailing too low in the water to be able to withstand the heavy waves and winds of the open Atlantic, and suited for use only in the relatively shallow waters of the continental shelf. What was more, they could not carry enough water to be at sea for long periods.\\" The Templar Code for Dummies (2007) also points out the historical implausibility of this scenario: > \\"As for having 18 galleys that may have left from La Rochelle, history > doesn't back that up...In shipping records from La Rochelle of the period, > there is no record that the Templars had 18 galleys, much less that 18 > galleys were at La Rochelle. Reports in the years leading up to the arrest > seem to imply that the Templars (and the Hospitallers, for that matter) > actually had very few large ships ‚Äì some suggest no more than four ‚Äì and > hired more from merchant shippers when needed\\" - Source: =Friday the 13th= There is a modern urban legend to the effect that the tradition of viewing Friday the 13th as unlucky originates with the date of the simultaneous arrest of many templars at the behest of Philip IV of France, on Friday, 13 October 1307. \\"The claim that the Friday the 13th superstition began with the arrest of the final Grand Master of the Knights Templar, Jacques Demolay, on Friday, October 13, 1307, is a modern-day invention.\\" Notable examples Some notable works which have featured the Knights Templar, or stand-ins for them, are listed below. =Films= (Chronological) *An early film by Victorin-Hippolyte Jasset, Le Roi Philippe le Bel et les Templiers (1910), dramatizes Philip IV's campaign against the order.Harty, Kevin J.

To thwart the Rosula, The Dark Mute set \\"Templar traps\\" before abandoning his and Annora's cave. *They appear in Knightfall (December 6, 2017), a medieval drama miniseries that premiered on History Channel.

Before Fiorentina The first football society was founded in 1898 and was known as \\"Florence Football Club\\", an English name. This was common in that period as football was still very much an English game. This club was aristocratic. In 1902 a group of young people (among them Italo Capanni, Mario Meloni and a young man by the name of Galluzzo, who would in the future have a relative play for Fiorentina) founded another team, \\"Itala F.C.\\". The grounds were located in the Campo di Marte area. A year later in 1903, another club appeared, \\"Club Sportivo Firenze\\", initially dedicated only to cycling and other minor sports, but later including football. In 1908 a group of people including Oreste Gelli founded \\"Firenze Football Club\\", that played their matches at grounds called Prato del Quercione, at Parco delle Cascine. Finally, in 1910 \\"Palestra Ginnastica Fiorentina Libertas\\" (already founded in 1877 for other sports) was born from an internal split in \\"Firenze Football Club\\". The two clubs soon became rivals as they also shared the home ground divided only by a rope held by some wooden stakes. The members of Libertas were often referred to as \\"ghiozzi rossi\\", because they frequently had to jump into the ditch that bordered the field to pick up the ball. The word \\"ghiozzi\\" derives from a type of fish in the Florence area, and \\"rossi\\" referring to their scarlet shirts. They were evicted from Cascine and went to a new ground in Via Bellini, which opened on 22 April 1922. Foundation Despite the foundation of many of clubs in Florence at this time, there were only two strong challengers: \\"Club Sportivo Firenze\\" and \\"Palestra Ginnastica Libertas\\". However, neither of them were able to challenge the bigger Italian clubs at the time. Out of necessity, the two clubs started to think about a merger, which would have been a big sacrifice for their identities, but the only way to have a strong enough club, both financially and in terms of quality. It's important to point out that this event was made easier by the rising fascist regime, which didn't like divisions in Italian cities, even in sport. In fact, many football clubs born in that period, such as Ambrosiana, Napoli, Roma and, of course, Fiorentina, were the result of mergers between existing urban clubs. In Fiorentina and Roma's case, the main authors of these mergers were Luigi Ridolfi and Italo Foschi, both provincial fascist leaders, while for Ambrosiana-Inter, the request was brought forward by Benito Mussolini himself. On 3 July 1926 (7 July according to some sources) \\"PGF Libertas Firenze\\" played their last official match (last match of \\"Campionato Nazionale di II Divisione\\") against Prato with the following line-up: Sbrana, Farina, Posteiner, Barigozzi, Magnifico, Salvatorini, Mazzacurati, Focosi, Csapkay, Segoni II, Baldini. The final score was 1‚Äì1, with goals from Miliotti for \\"Lanieri\\" team and by Baldini for Florence side. The final standings saw Libertas reach the renewed \\"Second division\\" as reformed by FIGC Thanks to PGF Libertas final position, Fiorentina could enter the new championship of \\"Prima Divisione\\" (\\"First Division\\"), the present-day Serie B. Fiorentina was founded on 26 August 1926. The first chairman was the Marquis Luigi Ridolfi, who held that position for about fifteen years. The first trainer was K√°roly Csapkay. The first match played by Fiorentina was against Signa, a small club from a nearby town which they lost 2‚Äì1. La Nazione, a Florence newspaper, stated: \\"Il debutto della squadra fiorentina che dovr√† fra breve iniziare il campionato di prima divisione non √® stato felice. I concittadini sono stati battuti da Le Signe per 2-1. L'A.C. Fiorentina ha avuto il torto di cominciare un po' tardi gli allenamenti della squadra. Ma la colpa non crediamo debba ascriversi del tutto gli intendimenti dei dirigenti del nuovo sodalizio calcistico...'\\" { class=\\"toccolours\\" style=\\"background:#ffffff;\\" align=\\"right\\" width=\\"100%\\"align=\\"center\\"} Initially the club colours were white and red, the traditional colours of Florence. The home shirt were half red and white, while shorts and socks black. But in 1929 a mistake during the washing of a set jerseys given to Fiorentina by Colligiana meant the red dye ran into the white, creating a shade of purple. The colour was greeted well by the fans of the team, and it became the official team colour. Three days after the defeat against \\"Le Signe\\", Fiorentina played another friendly against Sampierdarenese, drawing 2‚Äì2. The line-ups were: * 1st half: Serravalli, Posteiner, Bargioni, Salvatorini, Segoni, Tuti, Focosi, Nichel, Bolteni (Wolk), Baccilieri, Bandini * 2nd half: Sbrana, Posteiner, Benassi, Salvatorini, Longoni, Carulli, Baldini, Nichel, Bolteni (Wolk), Baccilieri, Bandini. Debut = Season 1926-27: the beginning = The team was admitted in group C (year 1926-27), and played its first match in an official competition on 3 October 1926, in a home match against the rival Pisa, ended with a victory for 3‚Äì1. That championship for the yet \\"white-red\\" team was not that brilliant: they finished 6th over 10 teams; but it was a key season to settle the team Among the players, one emerged more than others: Bolteni, that at the end of the season had scored 12 goals, becoming top scorer. In reality, his real name was Rodolfo Volk, born 1906, a blond man from Fiume who, enlisted in the military service, couldn't play without an authorization of authorities, which didn't grant the permission. He was therefore constrained to play with a fake name. Volk would become later an idol for Roma's fans. Season 1927-28: first place missed The next year the team, always in \\"Prima Divisione\\", moved to easier Girone Sud (\\"Group South\\") reaching the second place at the end of the season only behind Bari. Fiorentina had won several matches: 3‚Äì0 against Tivoli, 5‚Äì1 against Savoia from Torre Annunziata, 8‚Äì0 against Tivoli (second leg), 1‚Äì1 against Taranto, 4‚Äì1 against Savoia (second leg). Despite seeming regular, the last match became object of inquest by FIGC. La Nazione stated: \\"possiamo dire che effettivamente, qualcosa di irregolare vi √® stato nella disputa del match e si auspica un'inchiesta da parte della Federazione, che metta in chiaro le cose\\". The next verdict issued by FIGC was: * Savoia would have offered money to Fiorentina to declare forfeit; * Fiorentina had not charged the fact, with the discriminating of refusing the offer; * Savoia would have reiterad the offer during the kick off, so that Savoia'd won the match; * Fiorentina would have accepted to don't cash the federal indemnity, thus Savoia would commit to don't declare forfeit against Bari; * Fiorentina did not charge the unfair behaviour of its manager; * Fact's liability was to be assumed by Savoia's and Fiorentina's managers; * Luigi Ridolfi and councillor Gino Agostini had to be excluded. The provisions were those: * Unfit for team's directors (Ridolfi and Agostini too); * No points for teams regarding that match * Sanction of 4500 liras for Savoia, 1000 liras for Fiorentina; Last match against Bari was pivotal for the standing; Fiorentina played away and lost 5‚Äì3. During the match there were a lot of accidents, Fiorentina's player were abused and menaced by Bari's fans. The society made a claim but was repealed and they had to make with second place. 1928-29: a settlement season Italian Football Association modified for 1928 season the structure of the highest championship because they wanted to create a unique round for Serie A: so they formed two rounds of 16 teams, from which the first eight would have joined Serie A the next year, and the following six Serie B. Fiorentina, inserted in Group B, ended the season in the last place with only 12 points and 5 matches won, 26 goals made and 96 suffered: only for a FIGC decision, it was re-admitted to Serie B for the next season, escaping from the relegation in Prima Divisione. The team was always trained by Capskay, but was joined by Gyula Feldmann, another Hungarian. Meucci, Luchetti e Checchi were Fiorentina players at that period. Fiorentina's goalkeeper, Pieri, was replaced by Sernagiotto after two dreadful performances: a 0‚Äì3 home defeat against Ambrosiana and a 0-11 away loss against Juventus in Turin. The next week, however, Fiorentina played a remarkable match against one of the biggest Italian teams of the period, Genoa CFC, that lined up: De Pr√†, Lombardo, De Vecchi, Barbieri, Burlando, Parodi, Puerari, Bodini, Catto, Chiecchi, Rosso. Fiorentina scored the advantage goal in the first half with Pilati IV, but genoans won the match with two goals in the last three minutes. Fiorentina's fans protested against the referee, Mr. Galassi, blaming him of partiality. The situation became soon dangerous and Fiorentina's dirigents had to take the referee to the train station with their car, but the referee was anyway attacked. For this facts, Florence's home ground was banned for a match. The following week wasn't anyway good: other two bad defeats against Napoli, 2‚Äì7, and SS Lazio, 0‚Äì4, on the neutral pitch of Modena. Historical view 1966‚Äì67 Fiorentina team The club won its first trophy in 1939‚Äì40 with the Coppa Italia and its first scudetto (Italian championship) in 1955‚Äì56, the club were runners-up in the four following seasons. In the 1960‚Äì61 season the club won the Coppa Italia again and was also successful in Europe, winning the first Cup Winners' Cup against Rangers. In the 1960s the club won the Coppa Italia and the Mitropa Cup in 1966 and were league champions again in the 1968‚Äì69 season. In 1974 the Viola won the Anglo-Italian League Cup. Success in the Coppa Italia was repeated in 1975, but from then until the late 1990s the club found itself in the doldrums, culminating in a season in Serie B (second division) in 1993‚Äì1994. Upon return to Serie A the club again proved able in the cup competitions, winning the Coppa Italia again in 1996 and 2001 and the Italian SuperCoppa. 2001 heralded major changes for Fiorentina, as the terrible state of the club's finances was revealed; they were unable to pay wages and had debts of around US$50 million. The club owner, Vittorio Cecchi Gori, was able to raise some more money, but even this soon proved to be insufficient resources to sustain the club. Then, Fiorentina were relegated at the end of the 2001‚Äì02 season and went into judicially controlled administration in June 2002. This form of bankruptcy (sports companies cannot exactly fail in this way in Italy, but they can suffer a similar procedure) meant that the club was refused a place in Serie B for the 2002‚Äì03 season, and as a result, effectively ceased to exist. In its place, Florence city council announced the creation of Fiorentina 1926 Florentia, with city mayor Leonardo Domenici as its first president. So the club was promptly re-established in August 2002 as Florentia Viola with a new owner, Diego Della Valle, and was admitted into Serie C2, the fourth tier of Italian football. The only player to remain at the club as they began their new life was Angelo Di Livio, whose commitment to the cause of resurrecting the club further endeared him to the fans. Helped by Di Livio, the club won its regional section in Serie C2 with considerable ease at the end of the 2002‚Äì03 season, which would normally have led to a promotion to Serie C1. However, due to the bizarre Caso Catania (Catania Case) the club skipped Serie C1 and was admitted into Serie B. This was only possible because the Italian Football Federation chose to resolve the Catania situation by increasing the number of teams in Serie B from 20 to 24. In the 2003 off-season, the club also bought back the right to use the Fiorentina name and the famous shirt design, and re-incorporated itself as ACF Fiorentina. Matches were still being played at the Artemio Franchi stadium. The club's unusual double promotion was not without controversy, with some suggesting that Fiorentina did not deserve it; however, the club remained in Serie B and managed to finish the 2003‚Äì04 season in sixth place. This achievement placed the Viola in a two-legged playoff against Perugia (the 15th-place finisher in Serie A) for a position in Serie A. Fiorentina completed their remarkable comeback by winning the match 2-1 on aggregate, with both goals scored by Enrico Fantini, to gain promotion back to Serie A. In their first season back in Italian football's top flight, the club struggled to avoid relegation, securing survival only on the last day of the season, and avoiding a relegation playoff only on head-to-head record against Bologna and Parma. In 2005‚Äì06, their form greatly improved, and they had qualified for the 3rd Qualifying round of the Champions League by earning the 4th place in the Serie A with 74 points. The combination of defence by captain Dario Dainelli and Czech international regular Tom√°≈° Ujfalu≈°i, midfield by Cristian Brocchi, wing by Martin Jorgensen, playmaking by Stefano Fiore and key marksman Luca Toni with Sebastian Frey as goalkeeper proved to be an outstanding force in Serie A. Fiorentina officially regained their status as an Italian elite, especially with Toni himself having scored an amazing 31 goals in just 34 appearances, the first player to pass the 30 goal mark since Antonio Valentin Angelillo in the 1958‚Äì59 season - which has seen him claim the European Golden Boot. On 14 July 2006 Fiorentina were relegated to Serie B due to their involvement in the 2006 Serie A match fixing scandal and given a 12-point penalty. However, on appeal, the team was reinstated to the Serie A, albeit with a 19-point penalty for the 2006‚Äì07 season. The team also lost their UEFA Champions League 2006-07 place. After the start of the season, upon appealing to the Italian courts, Fiorentina's penalization was reduced to 15 points from 19, which was still far heavier than club officials had hoped for. Despite starting the 2006‚Äì2007 season with the 15-point penalty, Fiorentina managed to secure a place in the 2007-2008 edition of the UEFA Cup. The combination of World Cup winner Luca Toni and Romanian international Adrian Mutu proved to be one of Serie A's most proficient strike partnerships, scoring 31 goals between them. While many doubted the potential of the Viola in the 2007/2008 season due to Luca Toni's departure, Fiorentina had a sensational start to the season and had been tipped by Marcello Lippi and other prominent names in Calcio as surprise Scudetto challengers. However this form tailed off towards the middle of the season with various disappointing losses in connection with a grievous family loss suffered by the widely admired manager Cesare Prandelli, but Fiorentina still managed to take the fourth UEFA Champions League spot.

The Surname-i H√ºmayun (), were albums that commemorated celebrations in the Ottoman Empire in pictorial and textual detail. Such celebrations included mainly imperial weddings and circumcision festivals. These albums were commissioned by the Ottoman Imperial family, usually by the Sultan presiding at the time. The Surname recounts the festivities in order of when the events took place, which includes in detail processions, grand entrance of the Sultan, feasts, entertainers, musicians, dancers, gift giving, firework displays, circumcision and wedding ceremonies. Although many of the Surnames were made to celebrate circumcisions of Ottoman Princes, the first Surname was commissioned in 1524 for a wedding ceremony. Importance Many reasons contributed to the formulation of these festival albums. Firstly, by commissioning the albums to be created in celebration of certain processions, it displayed the grandeur of the event. Colourful paintings that filled the pages of the album demonstrated the extravagance of the processions and the high costs. No expense was spared in these celebrations, and the making of the festival books. The Ottoman Sultans also wanted the memory of their son‚Äôs circumcisions or daughters weddings to live on, beyond the event itself. The albums would allow for the future generations to experience the celebrations. The processions also involved many factions of society taking part and in effect, helped create a sense of unity or community. This aided in the Sultan's efforts to maintain popular support for him and the Ottoman Empire. The pashas from around the Ottoman Empire gather to give the Sultan gifts. The Surnames would often gloss over unwanted and unappealing events, in order to maintain a more suitable image. The albums help create a positive image to show the power of the Sultan and the state. Since it was the Imperial family who put these festivals on, maintaining popular support and consolidating power was important to them because they were not voted into power but rather, passed down to them. The entire festival and in the Surname itself, conveyed a message that state mechanisms created order in a naturally chaotic world. Another motivation behind the creation of these albums was the reputation the Sultans wanted to maintain outside of the Empire. Impressing foreign diplomats who were on hand to witness the festivities was important because the diplomats would report back to their rulers in Europe. They reported not just on current state of affairs in the Ottoman Empire, but the great events and spectacles. Processions During the various festivals, the Ottoman Sultan would throw gold coins into the crowd as a sign of the great wealth of the imperial household. There were many festivals and rituals that took place in the Ottoman Empire but only the most elaborate were documented in a Surname-I H√ºmayun. These are the festivals that are known to be documented in detail. *1524 The earliest known festival for which a Surname existed was created for the marriage of Princess Hatice, the sister of S√ºleyman I, to Grand Vizier Ibrahim Pasha. It was commissioned by Sultan S√ºleyman the Magnificent in order to have records of the event. *1530 S√ºleyman the Magnificent commissioned this festival in 1530 and it lasted three weeks. He decided to have a festival at this time, because even though his armies had failed to take Vienna, they had not been defeated and had to withdraw so the festival was used as a political strategy. *1582 This Surname-I H√ºmayun was commissioned for a circumcision festival, as well it was to commemorate Sultan Murad III‚Äôs son Prince Mehmed. This festival lasted fifty-two days and was probably one of the most elaborate and grandiose festival the Ottomans had ever held, and it was well documented. The organization of this Surname was done chronologically, each day documented in order with what occurred. The book was created by an author named ‚ÄòIntizami‚Äô which is a pen-name, and the illustrations were done mainly by court artists including Nakka≈ü Osman. *1720 The Surname-I H√ºmayun of 1720 was commissioned by Sultan Ahmed III for the circumcision of his four sons, this festival lasted fifteen days. It was documented by Vehbi, who provided the text for the book. The illustrations were made by Levni and his assistants. This was the last festival documented in a Surname and it was also the last of its kind in terms of grandeur. Vehbi also points out in the Surname that he was chosen to create this festival book by winning a competition. Guilds and other groups Guilds from many different professions would take part in the processions that took place over the course of the festival. Artisan processions were not introduced into these festivals until 1582 and with the incorporation of an elaborate guild structure emerging in the seventeenth century, it became even more entrenched. The next two processions after that were limited strictly to guilds participating in processions. All the guilds that participated and created their own processions were depicted through miniatures in the Surname. A variety of guilds and groups were depicted in the Surnames. The various guilds found in the Ottoman take part in the festivals, often through parades and processions. Among these groups were the coffee sellers, they were a prominent group in the 1582 festival. Coffee shops were a new phenomenon in the Ottoman Empire and some were branded with a negative image. This was changed when the coffee sellers paraded a model of a coffeehouse on wheels with customers inside. The Sultan was so pleased with the procession that he promised to be more lenient with them, at least for the time being. Different artisan groups such as coppersmiths, goldsmiths and tailors would have their own processions. The master of the guild would usually be at the front accompanied by many apprentices and they would have their work on display. Just as the coffee sellers, these groups would also carry recreations of their workshops built on wheels. They were usually accompanied by hundreds of young men who were typically apprentices and they were adorned with gold and many other jewels. The Surname describes these young men in detail; the descriptions are given a lot of space in the Surname and praise their beauty almost as if they were a source of excitement for the spectators. Guilds were not the only groups to participate in the festivals and they too were well-documented in the Surname. There were also the muhtesibs or the market inspectors who displayed themselves by inspecting the crowd, shopkeepers and artisans, as they would do on a regular basis. There were interactions between the crowd and the tulumcus, where there would be security present to keep the crowds in check. Even though they were officially supposed to make sure the crowd did not get out of hand, the Surname depicts them as buffoon-like figures that would joke with the crowds, imitate the dancers etc. Although students were not officially a part of a procession, they also found their own unique way to participate. Two thousand students of lower religious studies would come from the countryside and participated mainly to show the Sultan the poverty they were living in. One day they put on their own performance, and on another day they prayed and left. They could have disrupted the festivities, but observed proper behaviour throughout their stay.

In this context, a parser is a function accepting strings as input and returning some structure as output, typically a parse tree or a set of indices representing locations in the string where parsing stopped successfully. Parser combinators enable a recursive descent parsing strategy that facilitates modular piecewise construction and testing. This parsing technique is called combinatory parsing. Parsers built using combinators are straightforward to construct, readable, modular, well-structured, and easily maintainable. They have been used extensively in the prototyping of compilers and processors for domain-specific languages such as natural-language interfaces to databases, where complex and varied semantic actions are closely integrated with syntactic processing. In 1989, Richard Frost and John Launchbury demonstrated use of parser combinators to construct natural- language interpreters. Graham Hutton also used higher-order functions for basic parsing in 1992. S.D. Swierstra also exhibited the practical aspects of parser combinators in 2001. In 2008, Frost, Hafiz and Callaghan described a set of parser combinators in Haskell that solve the long-standing problem of accommodating left recursion, and work as a complete top-down parsing tool in polynomial time and space. Basic idea In any programming language that has first-class functions, parser combinators can be used to combine basic parsers to construct parsers for more complex rules. For example, a production rule of a context-free grammar (CFG) may have one or more alternatives and each alternative may consist of a sequence of non-terminal(s) and/or terminal(s), or the alternative may consist of a single non-terminal or terminal or the empty string. If a simple parser is available for each of these alternatives, a parser combinator can be used to combine each of these parsers, returning a new parser which can recognise any or all of the alternatives. In languages that support operator overloading, a parser combinator can take the form of an infix operator, used to glue different parsers to form a complete rule. Parser combinators thereby enable parsers to be defined in an embedded style, in code which is similar in structure to the rules of the formal grammar. As such, implementations can be thought of as executable specifications with all the associated advantages. (Notably: readability) The combinators To keep the discussion relatively straightforward, we discuss parser combinators in terms of recognizers only. If the input string is of length \`#input\` and its members are accessed through an index \`j\`, a recognizer is a parser which returns, as output, a set of indices representing positions at which the parser successfully finished recognizing a sequence of tokens that began at position \`j\`. An empty result set indicates that the recognizer failed to recognize any sequence beginning at index \`j\`. A non-empty result set indicates the recognizer ends at different positions successfully. * The \`empty\` recognizer recognizes the empty string. This parser always succeeds, returning a singleton set containing the current position: :empty(j) = \\\\\\\\{j\\\\\\\\} * A recognizer \`term x\` recognizes the terminal \`x\`. If the token at position \`j\` in the input string is \`x\`, this parser returns a singleton set containing \`j + 1\`; otherwise, it returns the empty set. : term(x,j) = \\\\begin{cases} \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ \\\\right \\\\\\\\}, & j \\\\geq \\\\\\\\#input\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ j+1 \\\\right \\\\\\\\}, & j^{th} \\\\mbox{ element of } input=x\\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\left \\\\\\\\{ \\\\right \\\\\\\\}, & \\\\mbox{otherwise} \\\\end{cases} Note that there may be multiple distinct ways to parse a string while finishing at the same index: this indicates an ambiguous grammar. Simple recognizers do not acknowledge these ambiguities; each possible finishing index is listed only once in the result set. For a more complete set of results, a more complicated object such as a parse tree must be returned. Following the definitions of two basic recognizers \`p\` and \`q\`, we can define two major parser combinators for alternative and sequencing: * The ‚Äòalternative‚Äô parser combinator, ‚äï, applies both of the recognizers on the same input position \`j\` and sums up the results returned by both of the recognizers, which is eventually returned as the final result. It is used as an infix operator between \`p\` and \`q\` as follows: : (p \\\\oplus q)(j) = p(j) \\\\cup q(j) * The sequencing of recognizers is done with the ‚äõ parser combinator. Like ‚äï, it is used as an infix operator between \`p\` and \`q\`. But it applies the first recognizer \`p\` to the input position \`j\`, and if there is any successful result of this application, then the second recognizer \`q\` is applied to every element of the result set returned by the first recognizer. ‚äõ ultimately returns the union of these applications of q. : (p \\\\circledast q)(j) = \\\\bigcup \\\\\\\\{ q(k) : k \\\\in p(j) \\\\\\\\} Examples Consider a highly ambiguous context-free grammar, \`s ::= ‚Äòx‚Äô s s  Œµ\`. Using the combinators defined earlier, we can modularly define executable notations of this grammar in a modern functional language (e.g. Haskell) as \`s = term ‚Äòx‚Äô <*> s <*> s <+> empty\`. When the recognizer \`s\` is applied on an input sequence \`xxxxx\` at position \`1\`, according to the above definitions it would return a result set \`{5,4,3,2}\`. Shortcomings and solutions Parser combinators, like all recursive descent parsers, are not limited to the context-free grammars and thus do no global search for ambiguities in the LL(k) parsing Firstk and Followk sets. Thus, ambiguities are not known until run-time if and until the input triggers them. In such cases, the recursive descent parser may default (perhaps unknown to the grammar designer) to one of the possible ambiguous paths, resulting in semantic confusion (aliasing) in the use of the language. This leads to bugs by users of ambiguous programming languages, which are not reported at compile-time, and which are introduced not by human error, but by ambiguous grammar. The only solution that eliminates these bugs is to remove the ambiguities and use a context-free grammar. The simple implementations of parser combinators have some shortcomings, which are common in top-down parsing. Na√Øve combinatory parsing requires exponential time and space when parsing an ambiguous context-free grammar. In 1996, Frost and Szydlowski demonstrated how memoization can be used with parser combinators to reduce the time complexity to polynomial. Later Frost used monads to construct the combinators for systematic and correct threading of memo-table throughout the computation. Like any top-down recursive descent parsing, the conventional parser combinators (like the combinators described above) will not terminate while processing a left-recursive grammar (e.g. \`s ::= s <*> term ‚Äòx‚Äôempty\`). A recognition algorithm that accommodates ambiguous grammars with direct left- recursive rules is described by Frost and Hafiz in 2006. The algorithm curtails the otherwise ever-growing left-recursive parse by imposing depth restrictions. That algorithm was extended to a complete parsing algorithm to accommodate indirect as well as direct left-recursion in polynomial time, and to generate compact polynomial-size representations of the potentially exponential number of parse trees for highly ambiguous grammars by Frost, Hafiz and Callaghan in 2007.

Started in 1853 by Colonel Richard Henry Dulany, the show was designed to showcase and improve local breeding stock in Northern Virginia. Colonel Dulany continued to run the show until his death in 1906. The show has occupied the same scenic spot since its inception years ago; under the shady oak trees of Grafton Farm, near Upperville, Virginia. History According to historians, Colonel Dulany was riding cross-country one cold winter's day and came across a young colt who was cast in a low fence. Stopping to free the young horse, he realized the colt had been stuck long enough for his feet to have frozen. Reflecting on the fate of the young horse, Colonel Dulany decided to start a colt & filly show to encourage better care of young horses, and to inspire local breeders to breed better stock. The show was scheduled for June under the oak trees at Grafton Farm, a centrally located Dulany farm on route 50, two miles east of Upperville. The first show listed two classes, one for colts, and one for fillies. Prior to the first show, Colonel Dulany went to Manhattan to consult with silversmith Louis Tiffany to design a suitable trophy, the labor on which was donated by Mr. Tiffany for the event. The first show proved so popular, a club was formed to run the show. The club, originally called the Upperville Union Club, elected Colonel Dulany as its first president. No event was held in 1861‚Äì65, 1917‚Äì18, 1942‚Äì45 nor 2020. The Show today The AA rated show, considered one of the most prestigious in the country, now spans seven days and showcases over two thousand horse and rider combinations. It was named the \\"Horse Show of the Year\\" by the National Show Hunter Hall of Fame and the Virginia Horse Show Association. The prize list includes classes in breeding, hunters, and jumpers, and entries range from local children to leading Olympic and Show Jumping World Cup horses and riders.Welcome to Upperville The show attracts over 20,000 spectators, is a designated World Champion Hunter Rider show, and finishes with the popular $208,000 FEI 4* Grand Prix, presented by St. Brides Farm, on the final Sunday.

The pattern is licensed by the Finnish Defence Forces and became available to the public as of 26 September, 2016.Licence of M05/M04 Design at site of National Board of Patents and Registration of Finland The first M05 items were issued to troops around 2007, and have nearly universally replaced the previous M91 pattern in service use. At the same time, the even older M62 pattern is still employed in some niche uses, such as by paratroopers of the Utti Jaeger Regiment due to the cut of the M62 equipment being better suited for parachuting.Kirmo Liukko, ‚ÄùValmiina, mene!‚Äù Ruotuv√§ki, 2019-3-10 Patterns =Woodland= M05 woodland pattern Finnish soldiers wearing M05 with a CV90. The basis of the planning of the new pattern are various photographs of Finnish forests taken by the Finnish Forest Research Institute. The photographs were then digitally edited by the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland's Information Technology Institute and concentrated into a 4-colour pattern representative of a Finnish forest. Dark charcoal grey, was added to the pattern in order to represent shadowed areas in a forest. The pattern was field tested several times, leading to small changes. The new pattern was considered to be significantly better than the old M62 and M91 camouflage patterns.

It is the first known medieval accusation against Jews of ritual murder. E. M. Rose points out that road robberies and kidnappings gone wrong were a frequent cause of death in the region during the period of The Anarchy when the Crown struggled to safeguard the roads.Oxford University Press: The Murder of William of Norwich retrieved October 4, 2016 This was followed by a similar allegation regarding the unexplained death of Harold of Gloucester. An attempt to establish a cult of Harold seems to have been unsuccessful. It was never officially supported and died out long before the Reformation.Hillaby, Joe, \\"The ritual-child-murder accusation: its dissemination and Harold of Gloucester\\", Jewish Historical Studies, vol. 34, (1994-1996), pp. 69-109. However, it established a pattern. Any unexplained child death occurring near the Easter festival was arbitrarily linked to Jews in the vicinity.Hillaby, Joe, \\"The ritual-child-murder accusation: its dissemination and Harold of Gloucester\\", Jewish Historical Studies, vol. 34, (1994-1996), pp. 69-109. In some instances promotion of a cult may have been influenced by the interest of local clergy to enhance the prestige of their church with a shrine. Anthony Bale suggests this, and local politics, may have been contributing factors to the cult of Robert of Bury.Bale, A. \\"House Devil, Town Saint\\", in Delany, Sheila, Chaucer and the Jews, Routledge, 2013, p.185 ff. Simon of Trent and Werner of Oberwesel Werner von Oberwesel are other examples of individuals who died under unknown circumstances, but whose deaths were nonetheless attributed to the Jews.

She was an enthusiastic amateur botanist and had large greenhouses set up at her manor Beateberga; the name of the estate means \\"The Mountain of Beata\\". Bunge was connected to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences and corresponded with Carl von Linn√©. Her spouse was a member of the academy, and from 1780 forward, she corresponded with the academy, discussed scientific botanical experiments and reported results. She became well known as a botanist and wrote the botanical work Om vinrankors beskaffenhet efter sjelfva naturens anvisningar (English: \\"About the nature of vine grapes by direction from nature itself\\") with tables (1806), the work for which she was recognised as a botanist. As a person, Countess Bunge aroused attention because of her way of dressing as a man, with the exception of a skirt. A lot of stories and anectodets are told about her. During the reign of Gustav III (1771‚Äì1792), the monarch noticed a peculiarly dressed woman in the Royal Swedish Opera and enquired who she was.

Harford argues that rational behavior is more widespread than expected in the larger population. He uses economic principles to draw forth the rational elements of supposedly illogical behaviors to illustrate his point.  Overwhelming gain paradox  The overwhelming gain paradox is a paradox of reasoning that is referred to in the book. Harford illustrates the paradox by the comparison of three potential job offers: * In Job 1, you will be paid $100, and if you work hard you will be paid $200. * In Job 2, you will be paid $100, and if you work hard you will have a 1% chance of being paid $200. * In Job 3, you will be paid $100, and if you work hard you will have a 1% chance of being paid $1 billion. Most people will state that they will choose to work hard in jobs 1 and 3, but not job 2. In Job 1, working hard is obvious because there is a clear reward for doing so. In Job 2, it seems a bad choice because the likelihood of a reward is so low. But in Job 3, working hard becomes the preferable choice, because the potential gain is so overwhelming that any chance - no matter how small - of obtaining it is seen as worthwhile. This appears irrational and paradoxical, because jobs 2 and 3 are identical 99% of the time. Harford uses the Overwhelming Gain Paradox to explain the high salaries of certain professionals, such as bankers, executives and entertainers. He argues that the process of preparing for and getting many of these jobs requires extremely hard work with little or no guarantee of reward - usually due to low market demand, or uncertainty. Thus, the rewards for these jobs are set high as the result of a rational choice to exploit the overwhelming gain paradox; were it not for this, most jobs in this category would be seen as resembling job 2, making it unlikely anyone would aspire to them at all, or work hard enough to potentially qualify for them. The exploitation of the paradox also has negative consequences: the resulting high number of aspirants raises levels of competition, and the presence of the paradox amplifies irrational behavior in job hunting; but these are seen as preferable to these jobs attracting no interest at all.

It is readily visible in binoculars or a small telescope, but is considered too dim to be seen with the naked eye at an apparent visual magnitude of 6.76. The distance to this object is 160 light years based on parallax, and it is slowly drifting further away at the rate of about 1 km/s. It has been proposed as a member of the Beta Pictoris moving group or the Tucana-Horologium association of co-moving stars; there is some ambiguity as to its true membership. This object has a stellar classification of F4IV, suggesting it is an aging subgiant star that has exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core. MacGregor and associates (2015) instead classify it as a young F-type main-sequence star with a class of F2V. Age estimates give a value of 500 million years, while membership in the Œ≤ Pictoris moving group would indicate an age of around . It has 1.19 times the mass of the Sun, 1.39 times the Sun's radius, and has a relatively high rate of spin with a projected rotational velocity of 90 km/s. The star is radiating 3.74 times the luminosity of the Sun from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 6,811 K. Its metallicity ‚Äì the abundance of elements other than hydrogen and helium ‚Äì is nearly the same as in the Sun. HD 15115 was shown to have an asymmetric debris disk surrounding it, which is being viewed nearly edge-on. The reason for the asymmetry is thought to be either the gravitational pull of a passing star (HIP 12545), an exoplanet, or interaction with the local interstellar medium.

Production peaked in 1965 with 7,010,218 barrels brewed, and then dropped 70% in the next 10 years.Yenne, B. (2004) Great American Beers: Twelve Brands That Became Icons.

The rights to the brand are currently owned by Pabst Brewing Company. History The Falstaff Brewery located in the north side of St. Louis. Falstaff Brewing's earliest form was as the Lemp Brewery, founded in 1840 in St. Louis by German immigrant Johann Adam Lemp (1798-1862). Over the next 80 years, the Lemp family was devastated by personal tragedies as it built its beer empire over the caves of St. Louis. It adopted its famous \\"Blue Ribbon\\" moniker quickly, as an 1898 trial proved when it took the Storz Brewing Company of Omaha to court for tying blue ribbons on its bottles, and won.Yenne, B. (2004) p 106. The Lemp Brewery company closed in 1921, and sold its Falstaff brand to the then-named Griesedieck Beverage Company. Griesedieck Beverage was renamed the Falstaff Corporation and survived Prohibition by selling near beer, soft drinks, and cured hams under the Falstaff name.Tremblay, V.J. (2005) The U.S. Brewing Industry: Data and Economic Analysis. MIT Press. p. 96.Mittleman, A. Brewing Battles: History of American Beer. Algora Publishing. p 110. Falstaff Brewing was a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange, which was rare for a brewing industry in which families closely guarded their ownership. Falstaff Brewery building, New Orleans When Prohibition was repealed in 1933, the first two cases of beer made by the brewery were airlifted from nearby Curtiss Stienberg Airport to the governors of Illinois and Missouri. After Prohibition, the company expanded greatly. Its first acquisition was the 1936 purchase of the Krug Brewery in Omaha, which made Falstaff the first brewery to operate plants in two different states. Other facilities bought in this period included the National Brewing Company of New Orleans in 1937, the Berghoff Brewing Company of Fort Wayne, Indiana, in 1954, the Galveston- Houston Brewing Company of Galveston, Texas, in 1956, and the Mitchell Brewing Company of El Paso in 1956. Vintage Falstaff Beer sign By the 1960s, Falstaff was the third-largest brewer in America with several plants nationwide. The 1965 acquisition of the Narragansett Brewing Company of Rhode Island proved disastrous, with the state government of Rhode Island pursuing an antitrust case against them. The Supreme Court found in Falstaff's favor in United States v. Falstaff Brewing Corp. (1973), but the company never recovered. Fortunes declined throughout the 1970s as consolidation swept the beer industry, and the company was bought in April 1975 by the S&P; Company, owned by Paul Kalmanovitz. In the interim, Chicago White Sox announcer Harry Caray endorsed the brew in live TV commercials, many times with a glass of beer in his hand and sipping it. Kalmanovitz also owns General Brewing, Pabst, Pearl, Olympia, and Stroh's. That year, the company ranked 11th in sales nationally, and the original St. Louis plant was closed. Subsequent closures included New Orleans in 1979, Cranston and Galveston in 1981, and Omaha in 1983.Yenne, B. (2004) p 45. There seems to be no widely available credible source for the exact years the San Francisco, California 94124 and the Vancouver, Washington 98660 breweries closed. After the 1990 closing of the last Falstaff brewery in Fort Wayne, the brand name became a licensed property of Pabst, which continued to produce Falstaff Beer through other breweries.

World War I service  = Difficulty in crossing the Atlantic = After loading cargo, mainly iron, in Maryland, Hatteras joined a convoy at Norfolk, Virginia, and sailed for France on 26 January 1918. On 4 February the convoy ran into a severe North Atlantic Ocean storm, and Hatteras' steering gear broke down completely. The disabled ship headed back to Boston, Massachusetts, using a jury-rigged steering system arriving 11 days later.

Cargo successfully discharged, she returned to Baltimore on 23 May. Thereafter she made four more Atlantic crossings, one to Nantes and three to Bordeaux, finally returning to New York City 19 March 1919.  Post-war disposal  Hatteras decommissioned there on 8 April 1919 and the same day was returned to the United States Shipping Board (USSB), which retained her until she was abandoned at Shanghai in 1938.

There is a temple of Sree Panickanar where a yearly festival called Padur Vela is celebrated, which is the curtain raiser for Vela-Poorams in Palakkad. Location Padur is a village in Palakkad District of Kerala State. It is a border village between Palakkad and Thrissur Districts. Padur comes under Kavassery Village II of Alathur revenue taluk. In about 5 km2 geographical area, the population is nearly 5,000. Padur is situated 31 km from Palakkad district headquarters, 8 km from Alathur and 8 km from Pazhayannur. Geography Padur is surrounded by rivers on its 3 sides. River Gayathri forms boundary on north and River Mangalam on south and they meet at the west side of Padur and together flows to merge in River Bharatapuzha, the largest river in Kerala. Because of this natural distinctiveness, Padur has thick greenery, including paddy fields, banana farms and coconut trees. Etymology The name Padur (Padoor:‡¥™‡¥æ‡¥ü‡µÇ‡¥∞‡µç) is derived from the usage : \\"The land (oor : ‡¥ä‡¥∞‡µç) of Palakkad King (‡¥™‡¥æ‡¥≤‡¥ï‡µç‡¥ï‡¥æ‡¥ü‡µç‚Äå ‡¥∞‡¥æ‡¥ú‡¥æ‡¥µ‡µç)\\". This is why, the 'Vela-Pooram' celebrations in Palakkad starts from Padur. Temples Padur Vela, usually celebrated on 23 or 24 February every year is the curtain raiser for Vela Poorams in Palakkad. The festival is celebrated as birthday of Lord Sree Panickanar, an incarnation of Lord Ayyappa. The culture, belief, and prosperity of this village is bound to Sree Panickanar.

Rabbi Hakham was born into a religious family and is the great-grandson of Rabbi Yosef Maimon, who led a religious revival among Bukharian Jews. Taking a great interest in literature, Hakham spoke his native Bukhori, Persian, Hebrew, and Arabic. In 1870, he opened the \\"Talmid Hakham' yeshiva in Bukhara, where religious law was promoted. At that time Bukharian Jews were getting only a general education, which mostly consisted of religious laws, reading, writing and some math. Even though studying religion took most of the time, many Bukhairan Jews did not speak fluent Hebrew. Only a few books were written in Persian and many of them were old and incomplete. Shimon Hakham decided to change this situation by translating religious books into Bukharian language. But since there was no printing in Bukhara at that time, he went to Jerusalem to print his books. In 1892 Shimon Hakham was one of the organizers of Jerusalem‚Äôs Bukharian Quarter(Heb: Sh'hunat HaBucharim), where Bukharian synagogues, schools and printing were opened. After coming back to Bukhara, where he distributed his books, Shimon again went to Jerusalem and spent there his remaining years. The period from 1900 until Shimon‚Äôs death in 1910 was one of the best in Bukharian literature. Shimon Haham rewrote the whole Torah in the Bukharian language. He also wrote and translated the following books: Likudei dinim (1900), Dreams and their meaning (1901), Yosef and Zuleiha (1902), The Passover Haggadah (1904), and Meghilat Ester (1905). Among his secular translations was the novel Ahavat Zion (Kissaii Amnun va Tomor)by Avraham Mapu. During his life Shimon Hakham wrote and translated into Bukharian more than 50 books. Many of his books and translations are still popular among Bukharian Jews. He died in 1910 and is buried on the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem. In 1986, the Hebrew Union College published an English study and translation of Hakham's Musa-Nama, edited by Herbert. H. Paper. This work is Bukhori for \\"Book of Moses.\\" In 1991, he was honored with a postage stamp issued by the state of Israel.

The formation of an artillery unit began in early 1917, when artillerymen started gathering into a trench artillery unit, which, by December 1917, consisted of a couple hundred men. On 26 December 1917, an artillery commando () was formed under the 1st Estonian Infantry Company, according to a decree by the commander of the 1st Division. Junior ensign Joosep Sild became the units commander. The unit was equipped with 24 Russian three-inch model 1902 field guns and ammunition from 44th and 45th Artillery Brigade of the Russian Empire. The 1st Estonian Artillery Brigade () was formed on 16 January 1918 in Haapsalu, with podpolkovnik Andres Larka appointed as its commander. By February, the brigade consisted of five batteries, with 26 artillery pieces, 21 officers and 801 soldiers. However, it was quickly disbanded by bolsheviks on 21 February 1918. After the bolsheviks retreated in front of the Germans, the Estonian division was allowed to form again on 26 February, with captain Karl Tiitso becoming the artillery brigades commander. The brigade was finally demobilized and disarmed by German occupation forces on 5 April. On 15 November 1918, captain Hugo Kauler started gathering former artillery officers in Tallinn. On 21 November 1918 the Estonian Minister of War Andres Larka appointed him as the commander of the 1st Artillery Regiment () and gave him the task of forming it. Initially, the unit had a hard time finding equipment, and the first battles of the Estonian War of Independence were fought on 28 November 1918 in Narva as infantry. In December 1918, the Estonians managed to buy two 7.7 cm FK 16 field guns from the Germans. Another batch of guns was received from Finland, consisting of twenty 87 mm model 1877 and four 76 mm model 1900 field guns. By 1919, the regiment consisted of three divisions, each containing two batteries. In total, 18 batteries participated in the War of Independence, which saw action on the Viru front, in Viljandi, Valga, V√µru, and under Cƒìsis in Latvia, against the Baltic Landwehr. = Republic of Estonia and Soviet occupation (1920‚Äì1940) = In March 1920, the unit was demobilized and relocated to Narva. It consisted of four batteries, a training commando and the 1st Fortress Artillery Group. The unit was renamed multiple times. On 1 June 1920, it was named the . on 1 January 1921, it was named the . On 24 November 1922, it was named the . On 15 March 1924, the unit was reformed into the 1st Division Artillery Force (), which consisted of the 1st Artillery Group (), based out of Narva, and 2nd Artillery Group (), based out of Rakvere. Major Georg Leets became the commander of the division and major Erich Toffer became the commander of the 1st Artillery Group. The unit received its flag on 28 October 1928. By 1939, the 1st Artillery Group consisted of a headquarters, a specialist commando, three batteries with four Russian 76 mm model 1902 field guns each, and one battery with two German 150 mm heavy field howitzers. On 19 September 1940, when the Soviets had occupied Estonia, a decree ordering the disbandment of the unit was released. The liquidation of the unit was concluded on 19 December 1940. = Restoration and present day (1996 ‚Äì present) = Artillery Battalion reserve soldiers during an exercise in 2011 Efforts to form an artillery battalion in the newly re- established Republic of Estonia started taking shape in 1996, when a working group, called \\"Viro projekti\\" (), was established under the Finnish Defence Command to assist the development of Estonian Defence Forces. Reserve colonel Jouko Kivim√§ki was chosen to assist the restoration and development of the artillery unit. Formation of the unit was not easy, because there were very few officers available, infrastructure was severely lacking and there was almost no necessary equipment. Due to these limitations, the first soldiers started receiving training in Finland in September 1997. By early 1998, the soldiers had completed their training. Finnish Defence Forces also donated various equipment, including 105 mm H61-37 howitzers, which arrived between December 1997 to February 1998. The unit was officially restored on 20 March 1998, when the Northern Separate Infantry Battalion was transformed into the Artillery Group. The unit received its flag on 20 March 2001. On 1 February 2003, the unit was subordinated to the Tapa Training Center. Between 2003‚Äì2004, the Artillery Group received 155 mm FH-70 howitzers from Germany, and in 2008, it received 122 mm howitzers from Finland, which replaced the old 105 mm howitzers. On 1 July 2008, the unit was transferred under the North- Eastern Regional Defence Command. On 1 January 2009, the Artillery Group was renamed the Artillery Battalion. On 1 August 2014, the battalion was made part of the 1st Infantry Brigade. As of 2014, the Artillery Battalion consisted of a headquarters, headquarters and support battery, artillery school, and a fires battery. The first commander of the unit, since 1998, was lieutenant Rein Luhav√§li. Between 2004‚Äì2005, the unit was headed by captain Enno M√µts. On 8 August 2007, captain Vahur K√ºtt replaced captain Viktor Kalnitski as the commander of the unit. Since August 2012, the Artillery Battalion was commanded by lieutenant colonel Kaarel M√§esalu. On 30 July 2015, major Arbo Probal became the commander of the unit.

She was the last person to be publicly executed in the city of Bremen.  Psychiatric Profile  Gottfried was born into a poor family; she had a twin brother, Johann Timm, Jr. Her parents, Johann Timm and Gesche Margarethe Timm, always had a preference for her brother. The reasons behind Gottfried's crimes remain unclear and widely debated, but the emotional deprivation she suffered during her childhood and her modus operandi lead to the assumption that she suffered from Munchausen syndrome by proxy, a very common disorder among female serial killers. Gottfried's victims included her parents, her two husbands, her fianc√© and her children. Before being suspected and convicted of the murders, she garnered widespread sympathy among the inhabitants of Bremen because so many of her family and friends fell ill and died. Because of her devoted nursing of the victims during their time of suffering, she was known as the \\"Angel of Bremen\\" until her murders were discovered.  Modus operandi  She used a rat poison called \\"mouse butter\\" (in German \\"M√§usebutter\\") very common at the time, which consisted of small flakes of arsenic mixed in animal fat. She mixed small doses into her victims food, eventually they started to get sick and Gottfried \\"friendly, selfless and resignedly\\" offered to take care of them during their convalescence, while continuing to poison them. During the period of her criminal activity, Gesche Gottfried was considered a model citizen and was well liked in the community. Even after the constant loss of relatives who suffered, it seemed that the friendly, candid and kind Gesche chased a \\"cloud of misfortune\\". Her neighbors, moved by the zeal and resignation with caring not only for her family but also her sick friends began to call her \\"the angel of Bremen\\".  Gesche Gottfried's victims  * 1 October 1813: Johann Miltenberg (first husband) * 2 May 1815: Gesche Margarethe Timm (mother) * 10 May 1815: Johanna Gottfried (daughter) * 18 May 1815: Adelheid Gottfried (daughter) * 28 June 1815: Johann Timm (father) * 22 September 1815: Heinrich Gottfried (son) * 1 June 1816: Johann Timm (brother) * 5 July 1817: Michael Christoph Gottfried (second husband) * 1 June 1823: Paul Thomas Zimmermann (fianc√©) * 21 March 1825: Anna Lucia Meyerholz (music teacher and friend) * 5 December 1825: Johann Mosees (neighbor, friend and advisor) * 22 December 1826: Wilhelmine Rumpff (landlady) * 13 May 1827: Elise Schmidt (daughter of Beta Schmidt) * 15 May 1827: Beta Schmidt (friend, maid) * 24 July 1827: Friedrich Kleine (friend, creditor; murdered in Hanover)  Arrest, conviction and execution  Johann Christoph Rumpff, Gesche's would be twelfth victim, got suspicious after finding small white granules on food she had prepared for him. He confided to his physician, Dr. Luce, who, incidentally, had already attended several of the earlier victims and handed over the substance he had found. Luce determined that it was arsenic and alerted authorities, but by then Gottfried had already claimed two more victims and had moved to Hannover, where she was withering the life of her latest victim, Friedrich Kleine. On the night of 6 March 1828, her 43rd birthday, she was arrested. She was sentenced to death by decapitation. She was publicly executed on 21 April 1831. It was the last public execution in the history of Bremen. Gottfried 's death mask was made to study the facial patterns of criminal women. This is within the now-obsolete field of study of phrenology.  Influences On Literature  In addition to her crimes, Gottfried inspired the creation and writing of several pieces of art and literature. One piece of art/literature that Gottfried inspired is a book by Sarah Bodeman called GIFT: I Made This For You. Written in 2016, the art book is set up like a pamphlet with recipes. There are 14 recipes for each of Gottfried's victims. All of the food was cooked and photographed with the same ingredients and the same sequence of the original food that was made for Gottfried's victims. Another piece of literature that Gottfried inspired was a graphic novel titled ‚ÄúGift‚Äù by Barbra Yelin. The graphic novel is about Gottfried's story and her manner of poisoning her victims. Finally, in 2009 Susanne Kord wrote a book called Murderesses in German Writing, 1720-1860: Heroines of Horror. In this book, the author discusses Gottfried and other woman murders, as well as how literature has portrayed these women. Despite her crimes, Gottfried will go down in history as not only committing fatal crimes, but influencing creative pieces of literature References  External links   Gesche Gottfried * Detention House * Gesche Gottfried in Stade * Gesche Gottfried's death mask * Article about the execution * Willibald Alexis / Julius Eduard Hitzig: Kriminalf√§lle des neuen Pitaval - Gesche Margaretha Gottfried *Effigy ‚Äì Poison and the City (2019): historical thriller about the Gesche Gottfried case Category:1785 births Category:1831 deaths Category:People from Bremen Category:Executed serial killers Category:Executed German people Category:German female serial killers Category:German female murderers Category:Filicides in Germany Category:Executed German women Category:German people convicted of murder Category:19th-century executions by Germany Category:19th-century German criminals Category:Poisoners Category:People executed by Germany by decapitation Category:Executed people from Bremen (state) Category:Twin people from Germany Category:Murder in 1813 Category:Criminals from Bremen (state) ","title":"Gesche Gottfried"},{"id":"16729204","text":"Branko Cvetkoviƒá (, born 5 March 1984) is a retired Serbian professional basketball player.

The sanctuary was founded in the 13th century after a Moorish shepherd found a statue of the Virgin Mary on the site where the monastery was later erected. Lluc is considered to be the most important pilgrimage site on Majorca. It is also known for its boys' choir, Els Blauets (a name derived from the blue cassocks worn by the boys), which was founded in 1531; the choir holds regular concerts and has gained international fame. A boarding school and numerous tourist-orientated facilities are to be found in the town. Today, the cells of former monks are leased to visitors. As it is located centrally in the Serra de Tramuntana the monastery is often used as a starting point for walking-tours. Each year, on the first weekend in August, there is a night walk from Palma to the sanctuary. The walk commences at 23:00 hours, leaving from the capital's Pla√ßa G√ºell.

He lives in Como, New South Wales . He started cycling at 10 and became a professional in 1990. Despite competitive aggression on the track, he is a \\"gentle giant\\" off the track. Prior to becoming a full-time cyclist, Eadie was a kindergarten teacher. He was awarded a Diploma of Teaching (Primary) from the Australian Catholic University. In 2002 Eadie broke the Commonwealth Games record for a flying 200m in 10.145 on his way to winning silver in the sprint. Eadie competed in the 2004 Olympic Games in Athens following controversy. He was cleared by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, after insufficient evidence, of allegations that he had tried to import human growth hormone. A package containing Peptides was sent to Eadie from San Diego. It was intercepted by customs officers. At the hearing, Eadie said that he did not know who had sent the package and that checks of his credit-card records would show no link. Eadie has never failed a drugs test. Eadie is known for his large beard, which earned him many nicknames, including Captain Haddock.

The best English translation may be \\"cheesy\\" or \\"tacky\\". Norsk ordbok defines \\"harry\\" as \\"tasteless, vulgar\\". The term \\"harry\\" was first used by upper class youth in Oslo in the beginning of the 20th century and was used to describe people who belonged to the working class. People in the lower social classes at the time often gave their children English first names such as Harry. The middle and upper classes mostly preferred Scandinavian or German (and occasionally French) names. English names (except English names that are also widely found in other European languages) had no tradition in Scandinavia and were generally considered bad taste and as a phenomenon of the working- class of the time in all the Scandinavian countries. The traditional elite of Norway mostly used conservative Danish names. A person who is harry is often perceived as unsophisticated, vulgar or with bad taste. The effect of bad taste is often characterized with the term harry, e.g. a harry dress or a harry car. Since the definition of good and bad taste is defined by fashion, there is no precise definition of harry. D.D.E., Sputnik, shopping in Sweden, Raggare culture and mullets are often mentioned today. In the 1970s, it was the 1960s hairwax or sharp shoes that were harry. In the 1980s, the 1970s flared pants or whiskers and in the 1990s, more or less everything that could be associated with the 1980s. Yesterday's fashion will often be interpreted as harry. Often what is harry in one period can be hip retro fashion the next year. Harry may also be interpreted as something like macho. The feminine parallel is doris. The term was repopularised by then Minister of Agriculture Lars Sponheim in 2002 to describe Norwegians who drive (in some cases, for hours) to reach and cross the border to Sweden in order to purchase groceries, tobacco, and alcohol at cheaper prices. Responses to this were retorts that seeking out bargains is smart shopping and Swedish shops introduced humorous campaigns with one shopkeeper giving 1000 SEK to customers named \\"Harry\\". The terms Harrytur (\\"Harry trip\\") or Harryhandel (\\"Harry trade\\") have since been popular descriptions of this trade.Harryhandel til halv pris Dagbladet, February 16, 2009 See also * Bogan, Australian term References Literature * Kalv√∏, Are: Harry.

It is southwest of Kilcullen, near the N78 road to Athy. It is a large circular enclosure covering most of the hilltop; about 13 hectares. While there is no longer anything visible on the ground surface, archeological investigations show that there were once circular timber structures (or rings of upright timbers) inside the enclosure during the Irish Iron Age (ca 400 BCE - 400 CE). According to Irish mythology, D√∫n Ailinne was one of the great royal sites of early Gaelic Ireland and was believed in the Early Medieval period to have been where the Kings of Leinster were inaugurated. These documents were written long after the site was in common use, however, and the site's relationship to Early Medieval kings remains unclear. It is similar to the other royal sites of Tara (Kings of Meath), Navan Fort (Kings of Ulster) and Rathcroghan (Kings of Connacht). The site is on private property and is not open to public access. The hill is above sea level and so visible from many places in the surrounding area. The best view of the site is from the Old Kilcullen churchyard in Old Kilcullen (where there is also a round tower), which is free and open to the public. D√∫n Ailinne should not be confused with the Hill of Allen (Cnoc Al√∫ine), which is to the northwest. History and purpose The site is circular, about 13 ha (32 ac) in area, ringed by an earth bank and ditch (or \\"henge\\"). As with most henges, the ditch is on the inside, meaning that it was likely to have been symbolic rather than defensive. It is believed that D√∫n Ailinne was a royal centre and inaugural or ceremonial site for the Kings of Leinster. In terms of its ritual use, the internal structures and layout, and its location and association, is similar to the other royal sites of Tara, Navan Fort and Rathcroghan (Johnston 2006). Indications of earliest use are from the Neolithic period, but the main activity there was during the Iron Age. It does not seem to have been dwelt in year-round, but was instead mostly used for short-term activity, including ritual. It seems to have been occupied during the Spring/Summer months and there is evidence of cooking, which include a great deal of bone from cows, sheep, pigs, deer and horses (Crabtree 2007, in Johnston and Wailes 2007). A La T√®ne style sword and Roman bronze fibulae have also been found at the site (Johnston and Wailes 2007). While it figures in some early historical references, D√∫n Ailinne was mostly abandoned about the time the nearby early Christian settlement at Old Kilcullen was established in the 6th century. Structures Excavations during the 1960s and '70s found that there were once timber structures within the ring. There were three phases of construction, each including rings of upright timber posts. One of these, the Rose phase, had a figure of eight layout, with one large ring, an annexe to the south, and an elaborate funnel-shaped entrance. The later Mauve phase had a stakewall, within which were a timber ring and smaller, closed, circular structure. The last phase was characterized by ceremonial feasting, indicated by a large amount of animal bone (Johnston and Wailes 2007). Study D√∫n Ailinne was the subject of archeological research between 1968 and 1975 by a team from the University of Pennsylvania led by Bernard Wailes. More recently, a geophysical survey of the interior was carried out by a joint American and Irish team (Johnston, Campana, and Crabtree 2009). This revealed a large number of new subsurface features whose character is unclear. Following some scholarly journal publications, a book was released by an American university publisher in 2007, by Bernard Wailes and Susan Johnston. In 2008, an interpretative site was opened at Nicholastown, a townland just south of Kilcullen, featuring a bilingual information panel (Irish and English) and a small-scale reproduction of the mound, topped by a sculpture. Current status and access The whole site is on private farmland and casual access is restricted due to difficulties with livestock; if there are cattle on the hill then access is not possible. If they are not there, however, you can ask the landowner and you may be given permission to have a stroll around the site.

K-58's western terminus is at K-99 west of Madison. It runs east through Lamont and Gridley and after a short concurrency with US-75, it goes through LeRoy before ending at the eastern terminus at U.S. Route 169 (US-169) near Colony. It is one of the newer state highways in Kansas formed on September 20, 2004, when K-57 was truncated at K-4 in Dwight. The route changes were made because of K-57's long concurrencies with K-4, K-177, US-50 and K-99. Route description K-58 begins at K-99 west of Madison, begins travelling east, and then enters Madison as West Madison Street. It continues through Madison, then turns south and follows 4th Street to the northern terminus of K-249. Here the highway turns eastward to follow Lincoln Street out of the city. As it exits Madison, it continues east for , then crosses the Verdigris River. From here, it continues east , turns south for , then back east. The highway then crosses Halderman Creek, as it turns southeastward. It soon curves back east and after , passes through Lamont. Just past Lamont, K-58 crosses Long Creek, then crosses into Coffey County later. Roughly into the county, the highway turns south for , then back east. It continues east as it enters Gridley. It continues through the city for then exits the city. As it exits Gridley, it crosses Varvel Creek, as it continues east. Roughly east from here, it joins US-75, and the two routes head south. The two routes cross South Big Creek, then K-58 leaves the overlap and heads east. It continues for , where it crosses the Neosho River, then shortly enters Le Roy. Within Le Roy, K-58 crosses the BNSF Railway, and then exits the city. About past Le Roy, the highway enters into Anderson County. About into the county it crosses Little Indian Creek then Indian Creek, later. It continues east from here another roughly , where it intersects US-169 northwest of Colony. The Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) tracks the traffic levels on its highways, and in 2018, they determined that on average the traffic varied from 325 vehicles just east of Lamont to 2410 vehicles on the overlap with US-75. The only section of K-58 included in the National Highway System is its overlap with US-75. The National Highway System is a system of highways important to the nation's defense, economy, and mobility. K-58 also connects to the National Highway System at its junction with US-169. History =Former designation= The first K-58 was formed in 1927, with its western terminus at US-50 northeast of Lenexa, and its eastern terminus at US-73E, or Metcalf Avenue. By 1936, US-73E was renumbered as US-69, and K-58 was realigned. It began at US-50 near Lenexa, Kansas, and followed Metcalf Avenue/US-69 north to Southwest Boulevard (now Merriam Drive). It turned east to Antone Road (now 34th Street) near the Argentine neighborhood of Kansas City, Kansas, where it headed north to Strong Avenue. It turned east on Strong, and headed north on (what is today) the Goddard Viaduct. It then headed east on Argentine Boulevard, crossed the Kansas River on the Argentine Bridge, and headed north on 18th Street to K-5, the Quindaro Boulevard, where it ended. In 1956, the 18th Street Expressway was completed, allowing a rerouting of US-69 off of then Southwest Boulevard. A new toll bridge over the Kansas River was built for the expressway, and the Argentine Bridge was demolished. K-58 then was rerouted to leave Metcalf and follow east on Shawnee Mission Parkway, then follow north on the 18th Street Expressway to K-5. Due to the rerouting of US-50 out of downtown Mission, Kansas, K-158 was created. It ran on Johnson Drive from 18th Street Expressway to Metcalf. In 1979, K-58 and K-158 were given to the cities of Roeland Park, Overland Park, and Mission, Kansas. K-58 became the first of several highways to be turned back, shortened, or realigned in Kansas City, as the Interstate highways were being completed. In 1996, extensive reconstruction was completed in Roeland Park, Kansas, where K-58 formerly traveled. As a result, the former Skyline Drive interchange was transformed into an at-grade intersection, also eliminating the Skyline tunnel underneath the expressway. When this was completed, Johnson County, Kansas renamed the segment from Shawnee Mission Parkway to I-35 as \\"Roe Boulevard\\", a continuation of \\"Roe Avenue\\" from Fairway, Kansas to I-35. =New designation= The current K-58 was designated in a September 20, 2004 resolution. It replaced a former alignment of K-57, which was truncated to Dwight at this time.

She subsequently sailed under the names Regina, Mediterranean Sun, Odysseas Eleytis, Scandinavia Sky, Tallink, El Tor, Monte Carlo and El Safa, until scrapped in Alang, India in 2005. As Svea Regina she was, together with her sister , the first ship to start year-round daily traffic between Helsinki and Stockholm, the capitals of Finland and Sweden, respectively. Concept and construction In the late 1960s, ships operated in the Helsinki‚ÄìStockholm service were small liners owned by Finland Steamship Company (F√ÖA), Rederi AB Svea and Steamship Company Bore. The ships used in the service were not built for navigating through thick sea ice, and as a result service had to be suspended during the winter months. Siljavarustamo, a joint subsidiary of the three companies mentioned before, had begun operating purpose-built car/passenger ferries from western Finland to Stockholm and other nearby ports in 1961,Malmberg, Stampehl (2007). p. 56 and by the end of the decade Siljavarustamo begun planning for ferries for the Helsinki‚ÄìStockholm service as well. Plans were to construct two ferries for a daily service, with high enough ice classification to allow year-round traffic on the route, and high enough speed to allow them to depart in the evening, with an arrival in the following morning (instead of the daytime departures of the ships used in the service at the time).Malmberg, Stampehl (2007). pp. 116‚Äì117 The main responsibility for designing the ships was given to Carl- Bertel Engstr√∂m, following objectives set by marketing executives G√∂sta Ryning and Kalevi Etel√§. On 3 January 1971 Siljavarustamo placed an order for the new ships with the Dubigeon Normandie shipyard in Nantes, France. At the same time as the ships were ordered, the owners of Siljavarustamo were drawing up plans to reorganise their operations. The decision was made to turn Siljavarustamo into a joint marketing company for F√ÖA, Svea and Bore under the new name Silja Line, while the ships owned by Siljavatustamo would be transferred to the fleets of Siljavarustamo's owners.Malmberg, Stampehl (2007). pp. 106‚Äì107 Just five days after the new ships were ordered, and attendum was signed, allowing for the building contract to be transferred to F√ÖA, Svea or Bore. In February 1970 the contract of the first ship was transferred to F√ÖA, eventually becoming their , while the contract of the second ship was transferred to Svea on 9 November 1970.Malmberg, Stampehl (2007). p. 248 The keel of the Svea- owned ship was laid on 2 June 1971, and she was launched six months later on 3 December 1971. On 13 February 1972 a storm broke the ship loose from her fitting-out berths, resulting in minor damage. Despite the difficulties the ship was delivered to Rederi AB Svea on 26 May 1972, and christened Svea Regina by Mrs Ingegerd H√§ggl√∂f, the wife of Mr Ingemar H√§ggl√∂f, the Swedish Ambassador to Finland. Following delivery the Svea Regina sailed from Nantes to Stockholm via the Kiel Canal. On 30 May 1972 she arrived at Nybroviken, Stockholm. Service history =1972‚Äì79= On 5 June 1972 the Svea Regina set on her maiden voyage from Stockholm to Helsinki. The Aallotar had entered service four months previously, and with a Svea Regina joining her sister on the route, daily year-round service was initiated between the capitals of Finland and Sweden for the first time. Despite doubts voiced, even by people within the Silja consortium, the Aallotar and Svea Regina proved to be a phenomenal success. In practice the ships proved to be too small for the route within their first year of service, and already on 4 June 1973 F√ÖA, Svea and Bore placed orders for three larger ships to replace the Svea Regina and Aallotar on the Helsinki service.Malmberg, Stampehl (2007). pp. 257‚Äì262 The Svea Regina ended service on the Helsinki‚ÄìStockholm route on 24 May 1975 after less than three years, when she was replaced by the new and larger . The Svea Regina was initially moved to the Turku‚ÄìMariehamn‚ÄìStockholm service on the same date, but she returned to the Helsinki‚ÄìStockholm route during a docking of the Svea Corona between 20 June and 17 July of the same year. Following this she returned to the Turku‚ÄìStockholm service until 4 October 1975, when she joined the Aallotar in Turku‚ÄìNorrt√§lje service.Malmberg, Stampehl (2007). p. 248, 257 The line to Norrt√§lje was closed a year later, on 1 September 1976, and the Svea Regina was laid up in Stockholm. Between 2 June and 30 August 1977 the Svea Regina was chartered to Compagnie Nationale Algerienne de Navigation Maritime (CNAN) for services from Marseilles to Algiers, Bejaia and Oran. Following the end of the charter she returned to Norrt√§lje for another lay-up period. In March 1978 the ship briefly returned to Silja Line service on the Turku‚ÄìStockholm route, before chartered as an accommodation vessel to Det Bergenske D/S A/S between 31 March and 20 May 1978. Following the end of the charter the ship again returned to Silja Line's Turku‚ÄìStockholm service for the duration of the 1978 summer season, after which she was again laid up, this time in Turku. On 18 September 1978 the Svea Regina again returned to service this time for Silja Line's cruise traffic. Four days later she was sold by Rederi AB Svea to the Finland Steamship Company, and on 2 October 1978 her name was shortened to Regina and she was re-registered to Helsinki. Her initial service with Silja Cruise proved short, as she was chartered to Polferries on 27 October 1978, for use on their Helsinki‚ÄìNyn√§shamn‚ÄìGda≈Ñsk service. Polferries had also chartered the Aallotar for the same service, and for a while the two sisters again served together on the same route. The charter contracts for both the Regina and Aallotar included a purchase options, but although a Memorandum of Agreement about the sale of both ships had been signed in November and December 1978, respectively, in the end Polferries decided to purchase the Aallotar but not the Regina. The charter to Polferries ended in April 1979, and subsequently the Regina was chartered to a German travel agency for cruises from Kiel to the Norwegian Fjords from 20 March until 12 June 1979. After that charter she again returned to Turku‚ÄìStockholm service for Silja Line until 1 September 1979. After this she was briefly chartered to Brittany Ferries for their St Malo‚ÄìPortsmouth service. Between 28 October and 29 November 1979 she returned to Turku‚ÄìStockholm service for one last time, for duration of the docking of the . =1979‚Äì89= On 29 November 1979 the Regina was sold to a holding company of the Karageorgis Lines, renamed Mediterranean Sun and re-registered in Greece. In 1980 she entered service on Karageorgis Lines' Patras‚ÄìAncona route. During the same year her ownership was transferred to a different Karageorgis Lines holding company, and she was re-registered in Cyprus. She remained on the Patras‚ÄìAncona service until 1981, when she was laid up in Patras. In 1982 the Mediterranean Sun was sold to the Maritime Company of Lesvos, again re- registered in Greece, renamed Odysseas Eleytis and placed in NEL Lines service on the Piraeus‚ÄìLesvos, Rhodes‚ÄìLimassol‚ÄìAlexandria and Piraeus‚ÄìRhodes services. In December 1983 the Odysseas Eleytis participated in the evacuation of Palestine Liberation Organization members, including Yasser Arafat, from Lebanon. In June 1985 the Odysseas Eleytis was sold to the DFDS subsidiary SeaEscape, renamed Scandinavian Sky and re-registered at The Bahamas. She was radically rebuilt at Werft Nobiskrug, Rendsburg, Germany for use on SeaEscape's Miami‚ÄìBahamas cruise service, on which she entered service in August 1985.

Expanding into plastic production for its own use, Ekco Plastics produced both radio cases and later domestic plastic products; the plastics company became Lin Pac Mouldings Ltd. Early history E.K. Cole (1901‚Äì1966) The company's founder Eric Kirkham Cole was born on 4 July 1901 at Prittlewell, Southend-on-Sea, Essex, and was educated at Southend Day Technical School, followed by a three- year apprenticeship. Cole and his future wife Muriel Bradshaw started out making radio sets in 1924.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: Cole, Eric Kirkham by Rowland F. Pocock William Streatfield Verrells, a schoolmaster and freelance journalist from Southend-on-Sea, wrote an article in a local newspaper asking if it was possible to power a radio set from the mains electricity supply rather than batteries. Cole saw a possible business opportunity and set about building his battery eliminator, which he later demonstrated to Verrells. Suitably impressed, Verrells joined Cole in a business venture, with Cole manufacturing the battery eliminators, and Verrells marketing them. In 1926 a private company E.K. Cole Ltd was formed with Verrells as chairman and Cole as vice-chairman. With the extra funding that was raised, the company set up a new factory at Leigh-on-Sea in 1927. After further expansion E.K. Cole Ltd became a public limited company in 1930, and moved to a spacious new factory at Southend-on-Sea. The company also began to concentrate on the manufacture of mains powered radios rather than battery eliminators which were becoming obsolete. The company suffered a major financial setback in 1932, when a fire swept through its research and development laboratories. The blaze destroyed much of the design work for the company‚Äôs new range of receivers. Architect-designed EKCO bakelite radios from the 1930s Ekco launched its first car radio at the 1934 Radiolympia exhibition. Another important development for the company was the introduction of bakelite cabinets for its radios. Initially these cabinets were made for the company in Germany by AEG, however the introduction of high import duties on the cabinets in 1931 led Ekco to establish its own bakelite moulding shop adjacent to its Southend-on-Sea works.The Setmakers by Keith Geddes and Gordon Bussey () The company employed famous architects such as Serge Chermayeff and Wells Coates to design its bakelite radio cabinets.Art Deco Artists and Art Deco Designershttps://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O22790/radio-wireless-ekco- ad-65/ 'ECKO (sic) Model AD-65' radio, 1932 In 1935 Ekco made a substantial investment in Scophony Limited, the developers of the ingenious Scophony projection television system. Although the system showed great promise, its development was halted by the Second World War, and not resumed postwar. World War II R1155 Receiver on top of T1154 Transmitter Before the start of the Second World War, the Government decided to disperse certain production to locations away from obvious bombing targets. This led to a shadow factory at Cowbridge House,Browning, B (2005). EKCO's of Cowbridge: House and War Factory. Cowbridge Publishing. . Malmesbury, Wiltshire, being established by Ekco. This was followed by other shadow factories at Aylesbury, Woking, Preston, and Rutherglen. The wartime headquarters of Ekco was based at Aston Clinton House in Buckinghamshire. Following the outbreak of war, the Southend- on-Sea factory was evacuated apart from the bakelite moulding shop whose large moulding presses could not be moved easily. Less than a year later, the empty factory was re-equipped to make wiring looms for aircraft such as the Avro Lancaster. Malmesbury specialised in the top-secret development and production of the new radar systems as part of the \\"Western Development Unit\\". Radar equipment produced at Malmesbury during the war included the AI Mk. IV and AI Mk. VIII air interception radars, and the ASV Mk. II air to surface vessel radar. In addition to radar equipment, Ekco also manufactured the ubiquitous R1155 and T1154 aircraft radios at its Aylesbury shadow factory. Ekco carried out extensive development work on both units before putting them into production, significantly improving on the original Marconi design. The R1155 and T1154 were also produced by Marconi, Plessey, and EMI. The company also manufactured the Wireless Set No. 19 tank radio at Woking. It was a Pye designed set made by several other British and American companies. In 1942, Ekco began production of its Wireless Set No. 46 portable man-pack radio, and large numbers of these were made at the company's Woking and Southend-on-Sea factories. Post war history Ekco Electronics Avro Anson XI at Blackbushe Airport in 1954, the company's trademark on its tail It is estimated that by 1945 EKCO had over 8,000 people working for it across various sites making mains and portable TVs, mains and portable radios, radiograms, tape recorders, car radios, electric heaters, thermovent heaters, electric blankets, plastic toilet seats, various plastic utensils, plastic bathroom fittings and 'Superbath' baby-baths. It was at one of those sites in Malmesbury, Wiltshire that in 1948 production of the 'Thermotube' tubular heaters started. In 1947, the company introduced the Wireless Set No. 88 VHF man-pack transceiver for use by the British Army. Ekco bought the Dynatron business in 1954Dynatron Museum - History and the Ferranti brown goods brand in 1957 (though not Ferranti's heavy industries, defence electronics or meter businesses). EKCO manufactured geiger counter =Radar= During the 1950s, the company produced a number of military radar systems including the ARI 5820 ranging radar for the Hawker Hunter, the ASV Mk. 19 air to surface vessel radar for the Fairey Gannet and the Red Steer tail warning radar for the Avro Vulcan. EKCO also supplied weather radars for a variety of civil aircraft such as the Bristol Britannia, De Havilland Comet, Vickers Vanguard, Vickers VC10 and BAC 111. The company also made the E390/564 weather radar for the Concorde. In 1970, EKCO's radar activities were subsumed into MEL, the military electronics subsidiary of Philips. =British Electronic Industries= Ekco merged with Pye in 1960 to form a new holding company, British Electronic Industries Ltd, with C.O. Stanley as Chairman and E.K. Cole as Vice-Chairman. The following year Cole resigned from the board and retired. He died on 18 November 1966 in the Bahamas due to a bathing accident, his wife Muriel having predeceased him in 1965. British Electronic Industries was put up for sale in 1966, and in the same year Pye closed the Southend-on-Sea factory (but maintained its car radio repair workshop until 1977) as part of its restructuring plan. In 1967, Philips Electrical Industries emerged as the new owner of the Ekco/Pye business which was then split into three different companies. By the early 1970s the Ekco brand had all but disappeared. Ekco-Ensign In the late 1930s, Ekco began producing its own radio valves at its Southend-on-Sea works. Following the company's decision to abandon the venture, the plant was converted to a lamp factory. In 1943, Ekco acquired Ensign Lamps based in Preston. In 1950, Ekco sold 51% of its lighting subsidiary, Ekco-Ensign Electric Ltd, to Thorn Electrical Industries.  Legacy  The main factory at Southend-on-Sea was, after being sold to the Access credit card company, demolished to make way for a housing development. The Ekco name lives on within the development. and the site still hosts the Ekco Social and Sports Club. A statue of Eric Cole was commissioned for the housing development in 2020.

The fuselage wing center section and undercarriage were constructed in duralumin, while the wings and tail were of wood and canvas. The aircraft was powered by a single Nakajima Kotobuki Ha-1-3 radial engine. Proposed armament consisted of twin 7.7 mm (.303 in) machine guns firing from between the engine cylinders.

Education Chatigny received an Artium Baccalaureus degree from Brown University in 1973 and a Juris Doctor from Georgetown University Law Center in 1978, where he was Case and Note Editor of the Georgetown Law Journal. Legal career Chatigny served as a law clerk to three different judges: Samuel Conti of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California (1979‚Äì1980); Jos√© A. Cabranes of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut (1980); and Jon O. Newman of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (1980‚Äì1981). He was in the private practice of law in Washington, D.C., from 1981 to 1983 and in Hartford, Connecticut, from 1984 to 1994. Federal judicial service Chatigny was nominated to the court by President Bill Clinton on August 5, 1994, to a seat vacated by Warren W. Eginton, confirmed by the United States Senate on September 28, 1994, and received his commission on September 29, 1994. He served as chief judge of the court from 2003 to September 2009. He assumed senior status on January 1, 2017. Consideration for Second Circuit Chatigny was nominated by President Barack Obama to a seat on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. The nomination received a unanimous rating of \\"well qualified\\" from the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, and the U.S. Judiciary Committee approved the nomination on June 10, 2010, on an 11-7 party-line vote. No date was set for full Senate consideration. =Support for the nomination= Supporters included three Republican former appointees as United States Attorney for the District of Connecticut who said in a letter to the Judiciary Committee in April 2010 that they \\"support, without any reservation,\\" this nomination. They wrote: \\"While each of us has dealt with Judge Chatigny under different circumstances, we have found him to be even tempered, thorough and without agenda. We believe that he is a fair minded and impartial judge, who has appropriate fitness and temperament for the appellate court.... We believe that a close examination of Judge Chatigny's record in sentencing federal criminal defendants shows that he is appropriately sensitive to the facts of the person before him and the rights of victims of the crimes that have been committed. Indeed, it is our understanding that the government has never filed an appeal from Judge Chatigny's sentencings and that there has only been one defendant who has appealed from an upward departure. We are of the strong opinion that Judge Chatigny's record on the bench makes him an outstanding and very qualified candidate.\\"Mayko, Michael. \\"Three state Republican lawyers support Democratic judge.\\" The Connecticut Post. 2010-04-22. Seventeen former federal prosecutors who have worked with Judge Chatigny wrote to the Senate Judiciary Committee that \\"in criminal as well as civil matters Judge Chatigny has proven himself over the course of 15 years on the bench to be unbiased, compassionate and temperate.\\" =Opposition to the nomination= Opposition has centered upon judicial restraint and attitude toward sexual offenders. On March 5, 2010, one of the prosecutors in the Ross case, Michael E. O'Hara, Supervisory Assistant State's Attorney for the State of Connecticut, wrote a 12-page letter to the U. S. Senate Judiciary Committee to elaborate upon the complaint that was filed and dismissed in 2005/2006, stating that Judge Chatigny's actions \\"certainly call into questions Judge Chatigny's fitness to serve on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\\"http://pdfserver.amlaw.com/nlj/O%27Hare%20letter.pdf A May 26, 2010 Washington Times editorial enumerated 1) that Chatigny served as co-counsel for director Woody Allen when he unsuccessfully complained against a prosecutor who had publicly stated he had probable cause grounds for Allen's reportedly abusing a minor stepchild; 2) that Judge Chatigny was reversed by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2001 \\"when the judge tried to rule against one aspect of his state's sex-offender registry\\"; 3) that the sentences imposed by Judge Chatigny in 12 child-pornography cases were \\"either at or more lenient than the recommended minimum - with most downward departures involving sentences less than half as long\\"; and 4) that, in the Ross case, Judge Chatigny \\"threatened to take away an attorney's law license if the lawyer failed to appeal the death sentence of an eight-time murderer of girls and young women. The judge claimed the killer's 'sexual sadism' was a mental disorder that made the murderer himself a victim.\\" Notable rulings He gained national attention in 2005 when he delayed the execution of Michael Bruce Ross in order to determine if he was competent to waive challenges to his death sentence and potentially prevent a violation of the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment. Ross was subsequently found competent to waive his rights and was executed. The prosecution filed a complaint against Judge Chatigny that was dismissed by the Second Circuit Judicial Council in a 24-page decision on July 26, 2006. In its 2006 dismissal of charges in the Ross case, the Second Circuit Judicial Council found that Judge Chatigny's actions \\"were not motivated by any bias in favor of Ross [the prisoner] or against the death penalty, but only by the judge's reasonable perception that the discharge of his own judicial duty...required that he take forceful steps on Ross's behalf.... While the judge used strong language, there was no misconduct....[I]n the judge's reasonable view, the circumstances thrust on him called for unusual action in discharge of judicial duty to ensure the fair resolution of the important proceeding before him.\\" Chatigny has yet to rule on the appeal of former Yale professor James Van de Velde, who had sued the city of New Haven in 2001,http://siliconinvestor.advfn.com/readmsg.aspx?msgid=16763835 then Yale in 2003, for allowing his name to be leaked at the inception of the investigation into the death of Yale student Suzanne Jovin in December, 1998. Chatigny dismissed the federal fourth amendment claims in March 2004, but left alone the state claims relating to the ruination of Van de Velde's career. By not allowing the case to proceed, Van de Velde claims his efforts to \\"shed light on the cold case and pressure the authorities try to solve the case\\" have been stonewalled. Of the 440-some opinions Judge Chatigny has issued as a federal court judge since 1994, 16 have been reversed.

Background  On 16 November 1720, Maria, the widow of the military furir Nils Dullfj√§r (d. 1718), gave birth to a child two years after the death of her husband. The child, a son, was weak and a priest was called upon to baptize it the day after. On his way to the farm, the mother of Maria told the priest that the father of the child was corporal Albrekt Nilsson Dullfj√§r, her 24-year-old former stepson; his mother had been the first wife of Maria's husband. When the priest arrived to the farm, he asked Maria who the father was. She did not wish to answer, but finally, he managed to make her admit that the father was her former stepson. The priest then forced her to repeat her confession; first to her relatives, and then in front of three other witnesses, before the child was baptized.  Trial and execution  The 12 January 1721, Maria Ersdotter and Albrekt Dullfj√§r were put on trial for incest, a crime which during this period was still punishable by death. According to the law of religion, founded on the words of the Bible, it did not matter that they were in fact not blood relatives; relations by marriage were counted as equivalent to relations by blood, and therefore, Maria and Albrekt were to be judged as if they were biologically mother and son. Maria's maids testified that Albrekt, during his leave of absence from the army, often wanted to stay on the farm of his former stepmother, and that they seemed to be in love with each other, and even slept in the same bed occasionally, though, as one maid said; \\"Yes, you could plainly see that they wanted to be with each other, but could not because of their ties\\"; Maria and Albrekt were both, as it seemed, well liked. Albrekt himself answered that although he might have shared bed with Maria \\"in youthful vanity\\", they had not done more than that. The court decided to take a pause so that Albrekt could be interrogated by two priests. When he returned, he confessed with the words, \\"Be that as it may, I admit that it is true.\\" The court judged Maria and Albrekt guilty of incest and sentenced them to death in keeping with the penalty prescribed for the offense in verse 11 chapter 20, of the biblical Book of Leviticus. The sentence was confirmed by the high court, and the 19 July 1721, Maria and Albrekt were executed together by decapitation.  Context  In the 18th century people were still executed for incest even when they were not related by blood, because relations by marriage were considered by religious criteria to be equivalent to blood relatives. There was a similar case in V√§stmanland, where Brita Johansdotter ran away from her husband with her stepson Mats, four years younger than herself, in 1739; they lived in the wilderness together until they were captured, put on trial in V√§ster√•s and decapitated in 1741. Sexual relationship with all kinds of in-laws were considered incestuous by the church: Oluf Svensson and the wife of his uncle, Anna Olufsdotter, were executed in 1704, Erik Ohlsson and his sister-in-law Karin Andersdotter were executed in 1721, Dordi Rasmusdotter and her brother-in-law in 1724, and as late as 1797 Caisa Larsdotter was decapitated for having sex with her father- in-law.

The project started under John F. Kennedy's administration, and was authorized by his Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, as part of a total review of the US military. The name \\"Project 112\\" refers to this project's number in the 150 project review process authorized by McNamara. Funding and staff were contributed by every branch of the U.S. armed services and intelligence agencies‚Äîa euphemism for the Office of Technical Services of the Central Intelligence Agency's Directorate of Science & Technology. Canada and the United Kingdom also participated in some Project 112 activities. Project 112 primarily concerned the use of aerosols to disseminate biological and chemical agents that could produce \\"controlled temporary incapacitation\\" (CTI). The test program would be conducted on a large scale at \\"extracontinental test sites\\" in the Central and South Pacific and Alaska in conjunction with Britain, Canada and Australia. At least 50 trials were conducted; of these at least 18 tests involved simulants of biological agents (such as BG), and at least 14 involved chemical agents including sarin and VX, but also tear gas and other simulants. Test sites included Porton Down (UK), Ralston (Canada) and at least 13 US warships; the shipborne trials were collectively known as Shipboard Hazard and Defense‚ÄîSHAD. The project was coordinated from Deseret Test Center, Utah. publicly available information on Project 112 remains incomplete. Top-level directives YAG 39 USS George Eastman (After being refitted with scientific equipment) In January 1961, McNamara sent a directive about chemical and biological weapons to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, urging them to: \\"consider all possible applications, including use as an alternative to nuclear weapons. Prepare a plan for the development of an adequate biological and chemical deterrent capability, to include cost estimates, and appraisal of domestic and international political consequences.\\" The Joint Chiefs established a Joint Task Force that recommended a five-year plan to be conducted in three phases. On April 17, 1963, President Kennedy signed National Security Action Memorandum 235 (NSAM 235) which approved: Project 112 was a highly classified military testing program which was aimed at both offensive and defensive human, animal, and plant reaction to biological and chemical warfare in various combinations of climate and terrain. The U.S. Army Chemical Corps sponsored the United States portion of an agreement between the U.S., Britain, Canada, and Australia to negotiate, host, conduct, or participate in mutual interest research and development activity and field testing.  Command  Deseret Test Center Logo features globe in aerosol cloud The command structure for the Deseret Test Center, which was organized to oversee Project 112, somewhat bypassed standard Defense Department channels and reported directly to the Joint Chiefs of Staff and US Cabinet consisting of Secretary of Defense, Secretary of State, and to a much smaller extent, the Secretary of Agriculture . Experiments were planned and conducted by the Deseret Test Center and Deseret Chemical Depot at Fort Douglas, Utah. The tests were designed to test the effects of biological weapons and chemical weapons on personnel, plants, animals, insects, toxins, vehicles, ships and equipment. Project 112 and Project SHAD experiments involved unknowing test subjects who did not give informed consent, and took place on land and at sea in various climates and terrains. Experiments involved humans, plants, animals, insects, aircraft, ships, submarines and amphibious vehicles.  Biological weapons tests  There was a large variety of goals for the proposed tests, for example: \\"selected protective devices in preventing penetration of a naval ship by a biological aerosol,\\" the impact of \\"meteorological conditions on weapon system performance over the open sea,\\" the penetrability of jungle vegetation by biological agents, \\"the penetration of an arctic inversion by a biological aerosol cloud,\\" \\"the feasibility of an offshore release of Aedes aegypti mosquito as a vector for infectious diseases,\\" \\"the feasibility of a biological attack against an island complex,\\" and the study of the decay rates of biowarfare agents under various conditions. Project 112 tests used the following agents and simulants: Francisella tularensis, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Bacillus globii, staphylococcal enterotoxin Type B, Puccinia graminis var. tritici (stem rust of wheat). Agents and simulants were usually dispensed as aerosols using spraying devices or bomblets. In May 1965, vulnerability tests in the U.S. using the anthrax simulant Bacillus globigii were performed in the Washington D.C. area by SOD covert agents. One test was conducted at the Greyhound bus terminal and the other at the north terminal of the National Airport. In these tests the bacteria were released from spray generators hidden in specially built briefcases. SOD also conducted a series of tests in the New York City Subway system between 7 and 10 June 1966 by dropping light bulbs filled with Bacillus subtilis var. niger. In the latter tests, results indicated that a city-level epidemic would have occurred. Local police and transit authorities were not informed of these tests.  SHAD ‚Äì Shipboard Hazard and Defense  USS Granville S. Hall  1965 Project SHAD, an acronym for Shipboard Hazard and Defense (or sometimes Decontamination), was part of the larger program called Project 112, which was conducted during the 1960s. Project SHAD encompassed tests designed to identify U.S. warships' vulnerabilities to attacks with chemical or biological warfare agents and to develop procedures to respond to such attacks while maintaining a war-fighting capability. The Department of Defense (DoD) states that Project 112 was initiated out of concern for the ability of the United States to protect and defend against potential CB threats. Project 112 consisted of both land-based and sea-based tests. The sea-based tests, called Project SHAD were primarily launched from other ships such as the USS Granville S. Hall (YAG-40) and USS George Eastman (YAG-39), Army tugboats, submarines, or fighter aircraft and was designed to identify U.S. warships' vulnerabilities to attacks with chemical or biological warfare agents and to develop decontamination and other methods to counter such attacks while maintaining a war-fighting capability. The classified information related to SHAD was not completely cataloged or located in one facility. Furthermore, The Deseret Test Center was closed in the 1970s and the search for 40-year-old documents and records kept by different military services in different locations was a challenge to researchers. A fact sheet was developed for each test that was conducted and when a test cancellation was not documented, a cancellation analysis was developed outlining the logic used to presume that the test had been cancelled.  Declassification  The existence of Project 112 (along with the related Project SHAD) was categorically denied by the military until May 2000, when a CBS Evening News investigative report produced dramatic revelations about the tests. This report caused the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs to launch an extensive investigation of the experiments, and reveal to the affected personnel their exposure to toxins. Revelations concerning Project SHAD were first exposed by independent producer and investigative journalist Eric Longabardi. Longabardi's 6-year investigation into the still secret program began in early 1994. It ultimately resulted in a series of investigative reports produced by him, which were broadcast on the CBS Evening News in May 2000. After the broadcast of these exclusive reports, the Pentagon and Veteran's Administration opened their own ongoing investigations into the long classified program. In 2002, Congressional hearings on Project SHAD, in both the Senate and House, further shed media attention on the program. In 2002, a class action federal lawsuit was filed on behalf of the US sailors exposed in the testing. Additional actions, including a multi-year medical study was conducted by National Academy of Sciences/Institute of Medicine to assess the potential medical harm caused to the thousands of unwitting US Navy sailors, civilians, and others who were exposed in the secret testing. The results of that study were finally released in May 2007. Because most of the participants that were involved with Project 112 and SHAD were unaware of any tests being done, no effort was made to ensure the informed consent of the military personnel.Atlanta Journal- Constitution (June 13, 2008) 40. \\"Cold War Test Victims Seek Aid\\" The US Department of Defense (DoD) conducted testing of agents in other countries that were considered too unethical to perform within the continental United States. Until 1998, the Department of Defense stated officially that Project SHAD did not exist. Because the DoD refused to acknowledge the program, surviving test subjects have been unable to obtain disability payments for health issues related to the project. US Representative Mike Thompson said of the program and the DoD's effort to conceal it, \\"They told me ‚Äì they said, but don't worry about it, we only used simulants. And my first thought was, well, you've lied to these guys for 40 years, you've lied to me for a couple of years. It would be a real leap of faith for me to believe that now you're telling me the truth.\\"Martin, David, 41. \\"Retired Navy Officer Seeks Justice\\", CBS News, June 12, 2008. The Department of Veterans Affairs commenced a three-year study comparing known SHAD-affected veterans to veterans of similar ages who were not involved in any way with SHAD or Project 112. The study cost approximately 3 million US Dollars, and results are being compiled for future release. DoD has committed to providing the VA with the relevant information it needs to settle benefits claims as quickly and efficiently as possible and to evaluate and treat veterans who were involved in those tests. This required analyzing historical documents recording the planning and execution of Project 112/SHAD tests. The released historical information about Project 112 from DoD consists of summary fact sheets rather than original documents or maintained federal information. As of 2003, 28 fact sheets have been released, focusing on the Deseret Test Center in Dugway, Utah, which was built entirely for Project 112/SHAD and was closed after the project was finished in 1973. Original records are missing or incomplete. For example, a 91-meter aerosol test tower was sprayed by an F-4E with \\"aerosols\\" on Ursula Island in the Philippines and appears in released original Project SHAD documentation but without a fact sheet or further explanation or disclosure as to the nature of the test that was conducted or even what the test was called.  Criticisms after disclosure of CBW testing = (1945‚Äì1946) Transfer of Japanese Technical Information = Camp Detrick, Maryland (Photo, 1940s) Author Sheldon H. Harris researched the history of Japanese Biological warfare and the American cover-up extensively. Harris and other scholars found that U.S. intelligence authorities had seized the Japanese researchers' archive after the technical information was provided by Japan. The information was transferred in an arrangement that exchanged keeping the information a secret and not pursuing war crimes charges. The arrangement with the United States concerning Japanese WMD research provided extensive Japanese technical information in exchange for not pursuing certain charges and also allowed Japan's government to deny knowledge of the use of these weapons by Japan's military in China during World War II. German scientists in Europe also skipped war crimes charges and went to work as U.S. employed intelligence agents and technical experts in an arrangement known as Operation Paperclip. The U.S. would not cooperate when the Soviet Union attempted to pursue war crimes charges against the Japanese. General Douglas MacArthur denied the U.S. Military had any captured records on Japan's military biological program. \\"The U.S. denial was absolutely misleading but technically correct as the Japanese records on biological warfare were then in the custody of U.S intelligence agencies rather than in possession of the military\\". A formerly top secret report by the U.S. War Department at the close of World War II, clearly stipulates that the United States exchanged Japan's military technical information on BW experimentation against humans, plants, and animals in exchange for war crimes immunity. The War department notes that, \\"The voluntary imparting of this BW information may serve as a forerunner for obtaining much additional information in other fields of research.\\"U.S. War Department, War Crimes Office Report (undated), retrieved: January 17, 2014 Armed with Nazi and Imperial Japanese biowarfare know-how, the United States government and its intelligence agencies began conducting widespread field testing of potential CBW capabilities on American cities, crops, and livestock. It is known that Japanese scientists were working at the direction of the Japan's military and intelligence agencies on advanced research projects of the United States including America's covert biomedical and biowarfare programs from the end of World War II through at least the 1960s. = Congressional action and GAO investigation = The U.S. General Accounting Office (GAO) in September 1994 found that between 1940 and 1974, DOD and other national security agencies studied \\"hundreds, perhaps thousands\\" of weapons tests and experiments involving large area coverage of hazardous substances. The report states: Innocent civilians in cities, on subways and at airports were sprayed with disease carrying mosquitoes, \\"aerosols,\\" containing bacteria, viruses, or exposed to a variety of dangerous chemical, biological and radiological agents as well as stimulant agents that were later found to be more dangerous than first thought. Precise information on the number of tests, experiments, and participants is not available and the exact number of veterans exposed will probably never be known. On December 2, 2002, The President signed Public Law 107‚Äì314 or the Bob Stump National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2003 which included Section 709 entitled Disclosure of Information on Project 112 to Department of Veterans Affairs. Section 709 required disclosure of information concerning Project 112 to United States Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA) and the General Accounting Office (GAO). Public Law 107‚Äì314 required the identification and release of not only Project 112 information to VA but also that of any other projects or tests where a service member might have been exposed to a CBW agent and directed The Secretary of Defense to work with veterans and veterans service organizations to identify the other projects or tests conducted by the Department of Defense that may have exposed members of the Armed Forces to chemical or biological agents. However, the issues surrounding the test program were not resolved by the passage of the law and \\"the Pentagon was accused of continuing to withhold documents on Cold War chemical and biological weapons tests that used unsuspecting veterans as \\"human samplers\\" after reporting to Congress it had released all medically relevant information.\\" A 2004 GAO report revealed that of the participants who were identified from Project 112, 94 percent were from ship-based tests of Project SHAD that comprised only about one-third of the total number of tests conducted. DoD informed VA that Project 112/SHAD and Mustard Gas programs have been officially closed as of June 2008 while Edgewood Arsenal testing remains open as DoD continues to identify Veterans who were \\"test participants\\" in the program. DoD's current effort to identify Cold War exposures began in 2004 and is endeavoring to identify all non-Project 112/SHAD veterans exposed to chemical and biological substances due to testing and accidents from World War II through 1975. \\"America has a sad legacy of weapons testing in the Pacific...people were removed from their homes and their islands used as targets.\\" While this statement during congressional testimony during the Department of Defense's inquiry into Project 112 was referring a completely different and separate testing program, there are common concerns about potential adverse health impacts and the timely release of information. Congress was unsatisfied with the DOD's unwillingness to disclose information relating to the scope of America's chemical and biological warfare past and provide the information necessary to assess and deal with the risks to public safety and U.S. service members' health that CBW testing may have posed or continue to pose. Seal of the U.S. Defense Technical Information Center. A Government Accounting Office May 2004 report, Chemical and Biological Defense: DOD Needs to Continue to Collect and Provide Information on Tests and Potentially Exposed Personnel states: Legal developments On appeal in Vietnam Veterans of America v. Central Intelligence Agency, a panel majority held in July 2015 that Army Regulation 70-25 (AR 70-25) created an independent duty to provide ongoing medical care to veterans who many years ago participated in U.S. chemical and biological testing programs. Prior to the finding that the Army is required to provide medical care long after a veteran last participated in a testing program was a 2012 finding that the Army has an ongoing duty to seek out and provide \\"notice\\" to former test participants of any new information that could potentially affect their health. The case was initially brought forward by concerned veterans who participated in the Edgewood Arsenal human experiments.  Controversy over inclusion of Okinawa as Extracontinental Site 2  According to the document, \\"the 267th Chemical Company (SVC) had the mission of operation of Site 2, DOD Project 112.\\" Corroborating suspicions of Project 112 activities on Okinawa include \\"An Organizational History of the 267th Chemical company\\", which was made available by the U.S. Army Heritage and Education Center to Yellow Medicine County, Minnesota, Veteran's Service Officer Michelle Gatz in 2012. According to the document, the 267th Chemical Company was activated on Okinawa on December 1, 1962 as the 267th Chemical Platoon (SVC) was billeted at Chibana Depot. During this deployment, \\"Unit personnel were actively engaged in preparing RED HAT area, site 2 for the receipt and storage of first increment items, [shipment] \\"YBA\\", DOD Project 112.\\" The company received further shipments, code named YBB and YBF, which according to declassified documents also included sarin, VX, and mustard gas.Mitchell, Jon, \\"'Were we marines used as guinea pigs on Okinawa?',\\" Japan Times, 4 December 2012, p. 14 The late author Sheldon H. Harris in his book \\"Factories of Death: Japanese Biological Warfare, 1932‚Äì1945, and the American cover up\\" wrote about Project 112: The U.S. government has previously disclosed information on chemical and biological warfare tests it held at sea and on land yet new-found documents show that the U.S. Army tested biological weapons in Okinawa in the early 1960s, when the prefecture was still under U.S. rule. During these tests, conducted at least a dozen times between 1961 and 1962, rice blast fungus was released by the Army using \\"a midget duster to release inoculum alongside fields in Okinawa and Taiwan,\\" in order to measure effective dosages requirements at different distances and the negative effects on crop production.U.S. Army tested biological weapons in Okinawa, January 12, 2014, Japan Times.Thomas H.

It is located in the municipality of Hulst, about 5 km east of Kloosterzande on the dyke of the Westerschelde.ANWB Topografische Atlas Nederland, Topografische Dienst and ANWB, 2005. The name of the hamlet refers to an old pier to the north, \\"Ten Ballen\\", used by a ferry. When the village of Hontenisse disappeared in a flood in 1509, this pier and some of the remaining dykes formed a corner (\\"hoek\\"), named \\"Ballenhouck\\". The pier disappeared into the Westerschelde around 1600, but the name remained.Municipality of Hulst, Gemeentelijk voorlichtingsblad 5 nr. 3, June 2007. http://www.gemhulst.nl/mdcms/showdetails.php?contentid=982 According to the 19th-century historian A.J. van der Aa, Baalhoek (or \\"Balhoek\\") was the only settlement in the Kruispolder, a polder that was reclaimed from the sea in 1616. In the middle of the 19th century, it consisted of 19 houses, and had a population of more than 70. All of the houses of the hamlet were located on or near the sea dyke. There was a little harbour here. Around the harbour, a new hamlet Kruispolderhaven arose. Nowadays, the hamlet is the smallest of the three hamlets in the Kruispolder, including Kruisdorp and Kruispolderhaven. Together, these three settlements are also named \\"Kruispolder\\". Baalhoek is mostly associated with the \\"Baalhoekkanaal\\" (Baalhoek Canal), a plan for a shortcut to the harbour of Antwerp to bypass the narrows of Bath that was proposed in 1967, but finally rejected in 1998 due to the resistance of a coalition of environmentalists and farmers.

It was the first high-rise building in Orange County. Samuel Kraemer 'made a fortune' from oil being discovered on his land. Kraemer invested his wealth in developing much of downtown Anaheim during the 1920s, including this six-story building for the American Savings Bank of Anaheim. The rich use of Gladding-McBean tile on the entire south and west facades arguably made it the most outstanding building in North Orange County when it was built. Designed by local architect M. Eugene Durfee, the building was the tallest in Orange County. It remained so for over four decades. The building once was the headquarters of El Camino Savings and Loan. The Samuel Kraemer Building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. It was noted to be \\"an excellent example of Renaissance Revival architecture\\", and to be one of few buildings surviving in Anaheim that featured extensive use of terra cotta glazed tiles. with See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Orange County, California References External links * Category:Buildings and structures in Anaheim, California Category:Tourist attractions in Anaheim, California Category:National Register of Historic Places in Orange County, California Category:Commercial buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in California Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1925 Category:History of Anaheim, California ","title":"Samuel Kraemer Building"},{"id":"16729979","text":"Stephen Tanzer is an American wine critic and editor at Vinous. From 1985 until he joined Vinous in 2014, Tanzer was the publisher of the critically acclaimed bimonthly International Wine Cellar, an independent journal read by wine professionals and other wine lovers in all 50 U.S. states and 34 countries, and the first American wine periodical to be translated into French and Japanese. Tanzer has particular expertise on the wines of Bordeaux, as well as other prominent wine regions, including Burgundy, California, Washington State, and South Africa. Tanzer has written wine columns for Food & Wine Magazine and Forbes FYI. Among his books are The WineAccess Buyer's Guide and Food and Wine Magazine's Official Wine Guide. Tanzer's International Wine Cellar, which employed a modern wine rating system on a 70-100 point quality scale, was considered in direct competition with Robert Parker's The Wine Advocate, though Tanzer's \\"controlled prose\\" is in contrast to the more flamboyant style of Parker. Tanzer still uses this scale in his ratings and reviews with Vinous. In February 2010, Tanzer launched the website \\"Winophilia\\" in the wine blog format, which published short articles by Tanzer, IWC collaborator Josh Raynolds, and other IWC contributors. On November 18, 2014 Vinous, founded by Antonio Galloni, announced it had agreed to acquire Stephen Tanzer's IWC and in late 2014 IWC's archive had been transferred in a combined site home, available to both Vinous and IWC readers.

King was elected to the Colorado Senate in 2010, and was sworn in January 2011. He represented Senate District 7 which includes Mesa County and part of Garfield County. He did not run for reelection to the State Senate in 2014, so his term ended in January, 2015.Ballotpedia. Steve King (Colorado). Viewed: 2017-01-28. Biography and early career King graduated from Colon High School in Colon, Michigan in 1977, and then earned an associate's degree from Mesa College in 1980. After graduation, he worked as a police officer for the Grand Junction Police Department, receiving law enforcement officer certification from the Colorado Law Enforcement Training Academy in Golden, Colorado. King was promoted to detective in 1982, and then transferred back to the patrol division in 1986 while finishing an undergraduate degree. From 1987 to 1988, he worked briefly as an investment broker, and received his bachelor's degree in psychology from Mesa State College in 1988. He returned to the Grand Junction Police Department in 1988 as a field training officer. In 1990, King received the Grand Junction Police Department Medal of Honor for Life Saving. From 1991 to 1993, King served as president of the Grand Junction Police Officer's Association; in 1992, he was vice-president of the City of Grand Junction's Employees Association, and served as its president in 1993. King began training in martial arts in 1977; he is a second degree black belt in Jeet Kune Do and Shorin-Ryu Karate. He received a gold medal in karate at the 1993 World Police and Fire Games and a silver medal at the 1995 games. Shortly after marrying in 1991, King, with his wife, Daun, founded American National Protective Services, a company providing self-defense instruction to women and incident management and robbery prevention instruction to businesses. He remains the chief operating officer of the company. In 1999, King joined the Mesa County Sheriff's Office as an investigator for the Complex Crimes Unit. From 2000 through 2006, he served as president of the Mesa County Deputy Sheriff's Association. King still worked part-time with both the Mesa County Sheriff's Office and American National Protective Services during his first term as a legislator. He and his wife Daun have three children. Colorado House of Representatives =2006 election= In the 2006 general elections, King defeated Democrat Richard Alward with 62 percent of the popular vote. =2007 legislative session= During the 2007 legislative session, King served on the House Business Affairs and Labor Committee and the House Judiciary Committee. In his first legislative session, King introduced a bill, cosponsored by House Speaker Andrew Romanoff and signed into law by Gov. Ritter, to allow rape or domestic violence victims to use false addresses in public records. He was also an outspoken proponent of expanding Colorado's \\"Make My Day\\" law to cover businesses, and against legislation which would have ended Colorado's use of the death penalty. In September 2007, King was appointed by Gov. Bill Ritter to a 21-member task on handling and use of DNA evidence. The task force recommended legislation, co-sponsored by King in the state house, to require that DNA evidence in capital cases be preserved. The bill spurred opposition from a number of district attorneys because of a provision that would require new trials in cases where evidence had been lost by law enforcement. After the bill passed and was signed into law, Grand Junction law enforcement officials expressed concern about the storage capacity required to meet the law's evidence preservation requirements, and approached King for assistance. In November 2007, King led Republican legislators in a letter to President George W. Bush prohibiting illegal immigrants from being detained at jails using tasers. =2008 legislative session= In the 2008 session of the Colorado General Assembly, King sat on the House Judiciary Committee and the House Local Government Committee. King was a co-chair of a special legislative committee that recommended the censure of Rep. Douglas Bruce for kicking a photographer; King had called for his suspension from the House, and voted to require Bruce to apologize for his actions. During the 2008 session, King sponsored legislation to give universities (specifically, Mesa State College in his district and Colorado State University) greater control over their own investment funds, to raise bails for DUI charges in which suspects also commit \\"aggravating offenses\\", and to prevent child pornography from being copied during legal proceedings. He also sponsored a ballot measure to allow senior citizens to take advantage of property tax credits even after moving. In total, King sponsored 12 House and Senate bills, seven of which were passed into law. Following the legislative session, King was named to an interim committee focusing on wildfire and development issues in mountain areas of Colorado. In October, King called for a legislative audit on enforcement of a state law prohibiting sanctuary city policies. In December 2008, King, frustrated with new regulation and with comments made regarding job losses in Colorado's energy industry, called for Gov. Ritter to fire Dave Neslin, the director of the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission. =2008 election= Rep. King sought re-election to the Colorado legislature in 2008; he faced no opposition for the Republican nomination and ran unopposed in the general election as well. King named education and energy issues as his priorities for the next legislative session. In contrast to his typical opposition to tax increases, King also supported a local school bond measure in Grand Junction that was on the 2008 ballot. =2009 legislative session= For the 2009 legislative session, King was appointed to the House Judiciary Committee and the House Transportation and Energy Committee. In 2009, King continued his active engagement in the legislature by serving as primary sponsor for 13 bills. His major focus included legislation with an emerging focus on increasing government accountability and transparency. In particular, he sponsored two measures: SB09-241 and HB09-1180. SB09-241 (Katie's Law) requires DNA sampling upon arrest for felony offenses, to be expunged if no conviction is obtained, and Rep. King received national recognition when he was awarded the \\"Katie's Heroes\\" award for his role in passing this legislation. HB09-1180 would have provided more Second Amendment personal safety options for Colorado concealed carry permit holders, but it was postponed indefinitely in committee. =2010 legislative session= In 2010, King presented a bill that would have required all schools, kindergarten‚Äìtwelfth grade, to perform emergency safety drills each academic year, in addition to the normal fire evacuation drills. The emergency safety protocol drills would include lockdown, evacuation and reverse-evacuation, and shelter in place drills. However, HB10-1136 was assigned to the House Education Committee, where it was postponed indefinitely. Colorado Senate 2011-2015 =2010 Election= In 2010, Rep. King was eligible for re- election to the 54th House seat; however, he instead chose to run for the open Senate seat in District 7. In the general November election, he defeated Democrat Claudette Konola and Libertarian Gilbert Fuller with 67% of the vote. =2011 Legislative Session= For the 2011 legislative session, Senator King focused on a bill that would have phased-out the property tax on business personal property. SB11-098 allowed for future enactment, once the state has reached prosperity levels adequate to deal with the decrease of tax income. The bill was assigned to the Senate State, Veterans, and Military Affairs Committee, and it was postponed indefinitely on a party-line 3-2 vote. King was appointed to serve on the Senate Transportation, Judiciary, and Legislative Audit Committees for the 68th General Assembly. Senator King was appointed to the Mental Illness in the Criminal Justice System Interim Committee for the 2011 Interim; this committee focused on maintaining legislative oversight into the continuing examination of persons who are mentally ill in the Colorado Justice System. King was appointed to the Police Officers' and Firefighters' Pension Reform Commission and the Senate Transportation Legislation Review Committee for the 2011 Interim as well. =2012 Legislative Session= In 2012, King focused on addressing a number of important issues in Colorado: addressing technological changes for the Safe2Tell program, updating penalties for impaired driving, and focusing on correcting gun limitation laws. HB12-1064 would prohibit government and law enforcement from banning possession and use of firearms during a state emergency unless that weapon was being used for a crime. The bill, one of four gun bills proposed during session, passed on a party-line vote in the Republican-controlled House before being sent over to the Democrat-controlled Senate. In the Senate, it was introduced to the Senate State, Veterans, and Military Affairs Committee and failed to be referred to the Committee of the Whole on a 2-3 party-line vote. King maintained his appointments on two Interim Committees for the 2012 off-session as well: the Police Officers' and Firefighters' Pension Reform Commission and the Senate Transportation Legislation Review Committee. =2013 Legislative Session= King was appointed to serve on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Transportation Committee, and the Legislative Audit Committee. Run for sheriff and criminal indictment and plea While still serving as Senator, on June 6, 2014, King was accused by Mesa County Sheriff Stan Hilkey of falsifying timecards King had filed in association with his part-time job with the department. At the time, King was running to replace Hilkey as sheriff, and denied all allegations and initially refused to drop from the race. On July 16, King announced he would be withdrawing from the race due to the impending allegations.http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_26246364/state-sen-steve-king- charged-three-felonies?source=pkg On January 23, 2015, King pleaded guilty to embezzlement and official misconduct. He was ordered to pay restitution and serve 2 years probation.

History It was the outcome of a process started in 1984, when the Portuguese Parliament hosted a conference held by the Council of Europe's Parliamentary Assembly on \\"North‚ÄìSouth: Europe's role\\". The Lisbon Declaration, adopted at the end of the conference, broached the idea of a European public campaign on North‚ÄìSouth interdependence and solidarity. The campaign was launched in 1988 with the support of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and the European Parliament. It ended with a European conference of parliamentarians and non-governmental organisations (Madrid, 1‚Äì3 June 1988), which launched the Madrid Appeal. The Madrid Appeal laid the foundations for a dynamic dialogue between North and South in a spirit of respect for democracy and human dignity in order to allow all the world's inhabitants to enjoy fair, balanced and sustainable development. The Portuguese government then proposed setting up a European Centre for Global Interdependence and Solidarity, a proposal supported by the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly in a recommendation adopted in January 1989. The North‚ÄìSouth Centre, was established in Lisbon in May 1990 with the purpose of promoting dialogue between North and South, fostering solidarity and raising awareness of global interdependence. The Centre fulfils a dual political role of representing \\"the voice of the South\\" within the Council of Europe and of promoting and transmitting the values of democracy and human rights that are central to the Council of Europe's mission in neighbouring regions. The Centre strives to promote gender empowerment, youth participation and democratic consolidation through intercultural dialogue in cooperation with civil society, local authorities, governments and parliaments.

It ended with a European conference of parliamentarians and non- governmental organisations (Madrid, 1‚Äì3 June 1988), which issued the Madrid Appeal \\\\- 1984 : Conference organised in Lisbon held by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe on the theme, ‚ÄúNorth-South : Europe‚Äôs role‚Äù and adoption of the ‚ÄúLisbon Declaration‚Äù (9‚Äì11 April) On 5 May 2011, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted a new statutory resolution for the North‚ÄìSouth Centre. This crucial step positively concluded a process launched in November 2009 by the Parliamentary Assembly, in connection with the 20th Anniversary of the Centre. Through this decision, the member States - and indeed all the stakeholders of the North‚ÄìSouth Centre - have confirmed its relevance and importance, at a time when the Arab countries - our neighbours - are facing historical changes. The main lines of the Centre's new statute, which entered into force on 1 June 2011, are the following : \\\\- the Centre has kept its present legal nature, and continues to function as an enlarged partial agreement of the Council of Europe; \\\\- an invitation is made to all member States of the Council of Europe as well as to the European Union to join the Centre as soon as possible; \\\\- the Centre acts as an interface between the Council of Europe and countries in neighbouring regions which are interested in cooperating with the Organisation, by offering them a platform for structured cooperation at different levels (governments, parliamentarians, local and regional authorities, civil society); \\\\- the two former statutory organs of the Centre merged into a new \\"Executive Committee\\", which is the single decision making body of the North‚ÄìSouth Centre : through this important structural change, the \\"quadrilogue\\" functioning of the Centre has been preserved, while full participation of all member states in the decision making process is ensured; \\\\- the relationship with the European Union has been reinforced, through the introduction of the EU Committee of Regions as a new stake-holder of the North‚ÄìSouth Centre; \\\\- the priority areas of the Centre are confirmed (education, youth, intercultural dialogue), with an increased focus on the promotion of Council of Europe principles and values beyond the European continent. Mission Building on the experience, knowledge and network of contacts established over the years, the Centre is an important asset of the Council of Europe and its role has been refocused to contribute to implementation of the Council of Europe's neighbourhood policy. The Centre's multilateral activities contribute to processes of democratic consolidation in member states and in neighbouring regions, mainly through education to democratic citizenship and intercultural dialogue. The focus of many of these activities is on strengthening civil society, in particular with regard to youth and women. The Centre works in close cooperation with the European Union in the framework of a Joint Management Agreement concluded between the NSC and the European Commission to raise awareness of global interdependence and solidarity through global/development education and youth cooperation in Europe and beyond. A key objective of the activities carried out under this agreement is to strengthen the role of youth and facilitate the development of policies and structures for youth participation, particularly in Europe and Africa. Structure The European Centre for Global Interdependence and Solidarity, more commonly known as the North‚ÄìSouth Centre, was established in November, 1989 as an \\"Enlarged Partial Agreement\\" so that other states not members of the Council of Europe can also join. There are currently 17 member States, two of whom are not members of the Council of Europe. Management of the North‚ÄìSouth Centre is overseen by an Executive Committee that is composed of members representing each of the components of the \\"quadrilogue.\\" The \\"quadrilogue\\" is a unique North‚ÄìSouth Centre concept coined to explain a partnership which brings together representatives of governments, national parliaments, local and regional authorities and civil society to ensure good governance of the Centre representative of all the relevant stakeholders. This system helps build bridges between political actors with different approaches, viewpoints and priorities, generating constructive synergies and offering a platform for structured dialogue and exchange of experience and good practice. =The Executive Council= The Executive Committee is the decision-making statutory organ of the Centre. On 5 May, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe adopted a new statutory resolution for the North‚ÄìSouth Centre. One of the main lines of the Centre's new statute, which entered into force on 1 June 2011, concerns its statutory bodies. In fact, the two former statutory organs of the Centre merged into a new \\"Executive Committee\\". The Executive Committee is the decision-making body of the Centre. The different components of the quadrilogue are represented as follows: ‚Ä¢ A government representative for each member state of the Centre ‚Ä¢ Four parliamentarians, 2 each from the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and the European Parliament ‚Ä¢ Four members representing organised civil society active in priority activity areas for the Centre and ready to engage in concrete cooperation ‚Ä¢ A representative of the European Commission ‚Ä¢ A representative of the Secretary General of the Council of Europe in an advisory The Executive Committee meets twice a year, in principle in Lisbon and in Strasbourg. The current president of the Executive Council is Jean- Marie Heydt. Composition of the Executive Committee =The Bureau= To facilitate efficient management, the Executive Committee shall elect a Bureau from among its members, ensuring representation of each of the 4 components of the quadrilogue. The Bureau monitors the preparation and execution of programmes and report to the Executive Committee. It also prepares the meetings of the Executive Committee, with the assistance of the Centre's Secretariat. The Bureau shall also carry out any other task entrusted to it by the Executive Committee. The bureau meets twice a year, in principle in Lisbon and in Strasbourg.

This work should be developed in close co-operation with youth organisations, the Youth Department of the Council of Europe, the EU-CoE youth partnership and other relevant institutions working in the youth field. The Youth Co-operation Programme is composed by 3 main dimensions: 1\\\\. A Euro-Arab and Mediterranean Dimension 2\\\\. The Network of Universities on Youth and Global Citizenship 3\\\\. The Africa-Europe Youth Co-operation activities in the framework of the ‚ÄúJoint Management Agreement‚Äù (JMA), signed with the European Commission in November 2008 and renewed until 2015. For more information, consult our official website =Women= The Programme \\"Women\\" aims to strengthen the role of women as developing actors in the southern and eastern Mediterranean region, and to enhance women's empowerment at all level of governance in order to contribute to the ongoing democratic processes in this geographic area, with particular attention to Morocco and Tunisia. The programme is based on the following dimensions: \\\\- Women's participation in politics \\\\- Prevention of the violence against women and adoption of the CoE's Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (Istanbul Convention) \\\\- Women and media \\\\- Euro-Med Women Network \\\\- Prevention of the human trafficking The activities of the Women Programme are implemented in the framework of the North-South Process for the Empowerment of Women (NSPEW) and its Euro-Med Women Network (EMWN). North-South Process for the Empowerment of Women: The North‚ÄìSouth Centre acts as Secretariat and monitors the Euro-Med Women Network launched in 2012. The Euro-Med Women Network aims at contributing to the empowerment of women by providing its members with an online platform, supported by a website, which will facilitate the exchange of best practices, the identification of common challenges and the sharing of experiences as well as will contribute to the identification of projects and partnerships. For more information, consult our official website Other Activities As a partial agreement of the Council of Europe, the centre shares the advantages of being institutionally an integral part of Europe's oldest political organisations of States. The Council of Europe is often defined as the \\"custodian\\" of Europe's political culture of pluralism, democracy and respect of human rights. The centre is under the administrative responsibility of the Directorate of Democracy. This tutelage reinforces the intercultural dialogue, education and youth dimensions in the centre's activities. The centre is a unique confidence-building instrument that enables its partners to analyse, discuss and compare their policies and experiences so that they can share best practices, reach consensuses and influence political debate. The North‚ÄìSouth Centre's work is based on three principles: dialogue, partnership and solidarity. Governments, parliaments, local and regional authorities and civil society organisations constitute the partners in the quadrilogue and are involved in the centre's activities. They are also represented in the centre's statutory bodies. This approach helps to bring the different players in North‚ÄìSouth cooperation closer, thereby creating constructive synergies. The centre carries out studies and organises debates, workshops and training courses. It acts as a catalyst by facilitating meetings between players from different horizons and countries, working on issues of common interest and encouraging the formation of networks. Its expertise is used and recognised by its partners. =Global education activities= Strategies and Capacity Building for Global Education The North‚ÄìSouth Centre's objective as regards global education is to develop, enhance and sustain strategies and capacity-building for global education, targeting institutions and practitioners in the field of global education in the formal and non-formal sector. Reinforcement of policies, partnerships and networking of key stakeholders in the field of global education \\\\- Joint Management Agreement between the EC and the NSC Objectives: elaborate on the prospects of developing a European framework for global/development education, facilitate and provide the space for dialogue and networking between international and European actors, in particular in the new EU member states, and to share experiences and identify common priorities.

Themes of the Forum have been closely related to the core mission of the Council of Europe: to promote democracy, human rights and the rule of law. In light of the events of the 'Arab Spring' and of the changes in the countries of the region, recent editions of the Forum have sought to address key challenges faced by Arab societies and explore possibilities for renewed cooperation with Europe. The Lisbon Forum 2014, building on the conclusions of the previous editions, was devoted to 'Electoral processes and democratic consolidation in the countries of the Southern Mediterranean'. It offered to the participants an opportunity to exchange on the main issues related to the electoral process as well as on the importance of democratic awareness of all actors involved. For more information about the Lisbon Forum edition. =North‚ÄìSouth Prize= The North-South Prize has been awarded every year since 1995 to two candidates who have stood out for their exceptional commitment to promoting North-South solidarity. The candidates, preferably a man and a woman, must have distinguished themselves in the following areas: protection of human rights, defense of pluralist democracy, public awareness raising on issues of global interdependence and solidarity, and strengthening the North-South partnership. * 1995: Vera Duarte * 1996: Danielle Mitterrand * 1997: Mary Robinson * 1998: Gra√ßa Machel * 1999: Emma Bonino * 2000: Marguerite Barankitse * 2001: * 2002: Albina du Boisrouvray * 2003: Frene Ginwala * 2004: Nawal El Saadawi * 2005: Bogaletch Gebre * 2006: Mukhtaran Bibi * 2007: Simone Veil * 2008: Rania of Jordan * 2009: Rola Dashti * 2010: Louise Arbour * 2011: Souhayr Belhassen * 2012: Monika Hauser * 2013: Suzanne Jabbour * 2014: Maura Lynch * 2015: Joaquim Chissano * 2016: Mbarka Brahmi * 2017: Abbas Gullet * Peter Gabriel * Women of Algeria (symbolic) * Patricio Aylwin * Lloyd Axworthy * Abderrahmane Youssoufi * M√°rio Soares * Cornelio Sommaruga * Xanana Gusm√£o * Ant√≥nio de Almeida Santos * St√©phane Hessel * Bob Geldof * Frans van der Hoff * Kofi Annan * Jorge Sampaio * Mikhail Gorbachev * Lula da Silva * Boris Tadic * Asma Jahangir * Aga Khan IV * Andr√© Azoulay * Joaquim Chissano * Giuseppina Nicolini * Kristiina Kumpula =Joint management agreement= Global/development education aims at raising awareness and at strengthening citizens‚Äô capacity to take action, advocate for their rights and take part in the political debate at local, national and international level for social justice and sustainable development.

He is most notable for his roles in the Comic Strip Presents.. and separate roles in other British comedy films. He had a long spell as a musician in the Royal Marines between 1940 and 1960. During this time, he is reported to have been accused of mutiny on two separate occasions. On both occasions, however, he was excused from any punishment; it is believed due to his charm and wit as a comedian. During his time as a marine Fagg forged a career as a stand-up comedy actor, performing in the traditional pub circuit of musicians. He performed in a number of pubs in the East End of London throughout this time. He became most popular as a weekend performer at The Imperial Crown pub, performing every Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights. His talent as a pianist was often at the core of his performances. Both his talent as a musician and as a comedian were honed during his time in the band of the Royal Marines. While performing in the early 1980s, his talent as a comic was spotted by the then newly formed Comic Strip. He appeared on a number of the features produced by them including; The Bullshitters: South Atlantic Raiders: Part 2 Argie Bargie!, GLC: The Carnage Continues, Oxford, Spaghetti Hoops, Les Dogs, The Crying Game, Detectives on the Edge of a Nervous Breakdown, Space Virgins from Planet Sex, Queen of the Wild Frontier.

Similar to a World War II reenactment, Korean War reenactments can be divided into two categories, \\"living history\\" or a public-oriented display (generally part of a larger venue) or as a \\"tactical event\\", a closed event where participants re- create a battle or event of the war. Living history In this type of event, participants set up a display attempting to show the public a small part of what soldiers, marines, sailors or airmen experienced during the war. Such displays normally focus on the \\"material culture\\" of the military during the war, with tents, vehicles, weapons, and other everyday items on display in as close to their original context as possible. Participants in uniform are generally available to answer questions or perform period activities for public observation. Tactical re-enactment In this form of Korean War re- enactment, participants attempt to \\"walk in the shoes\\" of a Korean War soldier, and simulate the experience as completely as possible with all its discomforts, but without physical danger. While other re-enactors may be portraying Chinese or North Korean soldiers, Korean War events lack the competitive \\"win or lose\\" wargaming aspect of more mainstream World War II re- enactments, and tend to be much more scripted. Participants are generally required to create a persona and remain \\"in character\\" throughout the event.

Deep-water corals belong to the Phylum Cnidaria and are most often stony corals, but also include black and horny corals and soft corals including the Gorgonians (sea fans). Like tropical corals, they provide habitat to other species, but deep-water corals do not require zooxanthellae to survive. While there are nearly as many species of deep-water corals as shallow-water species, only a few deep-water species develop traditional reefs. Instead, they form aggregations called patches, banks, bioherms, massifs, thickets or groves. These aggregations are often referred to as \\"reefs,\\" but differ structurally and functionally. Deep sea reefs are sometimes referred to as \\"mounds,\\" which more accurately describes the large calcium carbonate skeleton that is left behind as a reef grows and corals below die off, rather than the living habitat and refuge that deep sea corals provide for fish and invertebrates. Mounds may or may not contain living deep sea reefs. Submarine communications cables and fishing methods such as bottom trawling tend to break corals apart and destroy reefs. The deep-water habitat is designated as a United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan habitat. Discovery and study Deep-water corals are enigmatic because they construct their reefs in deep, dark, cool waters at high latitudes, such as Norway's Continental Shelf. They were first discovered by fishermen about 250 years ago, which garnered interest from scientists. Early scientists were unsure how the reefs sustained life in the seemingly barren and dark conditions of the northerly latitudes. It was not until modern times, when manned mini-submarines first reached sufficient depth, that scientists began to understand these organisms. Pioneering work by Wilson (1979) shed light on a colony on the Porcupine Bank, off Ireland. The first ever live video of a large deep-water coral reef was obtained in July, 1982, when Statoil surveyed a tall and wide reef perched at water depth near Fugl√∏y Island, north of the Polar Circle, off northern Norway. During their survey of the Fugl√∏y reef, Hovland and Mortensen also found seabed pockmark craters near the reef. Since then, hundreds of large deep-water coral reefs have been mapped and studied. About 60 percent of the reefs occur next to or inside seabed pockmarks. Because these craters are formed by the expulsion of liquids and gases (including methane), several scientists hypothesize that there may be a link between the existence of the deep-water coral reefs and nutrients seepage (light hydrocarbons, such as methane, ethane, and propane) through the seafloor. This hypothesis is called the 'hydraulic theory' for deep-water coral reefs. Hovland and Risk, 2003 Lophelia communities support diverse marine life, such as sponges, polychaete worms, mollusks, crustaceans, brittle stars, starfish, sea urchins, bryozoans, sea spiders, fish and many other vertebrate and invertebrate species. The first international symposium for deep-water corals took place in Halifax, Canada in 2000. The symposium considered all aspects of deep-water corals, including protection methods. rockfish hides in a red tree coral (Primnoa pacifica) in Juan Perez Sound in Haida Gwaii, British Columbia. In June 2009, Living Oceans Society led the Finding Coral Expedition on Canada‚Äôs Pacific coast in search of deep sea corals. Using one person submarines, a team of international scientists made 30 dives to depths of over and saw giant coral forests, darting schools of fish, and a seafloor carpeted in brittle stars. During expedition, scientists identified 16 species of corals. This research trip was the culmination of five years of work to secure protection from the Canadian Government for these slow-growing and long-lived animals, which provide critical habitat for fish and other marine creatures. Taxonomy A specimen of Madrepora oculata coral, collected off the coast of South Carolina. Corals are animals in the phylum Cnidaria and the class Anthozoa. Anthozoa is broken down into two subclasses Octocorals (Alcyonaria) and Hexacorals (Zoantharia). Octocorals are soft corals such as sea pens. Hexacorals include sea anemones and hard bodied corals. Octocorals contain eight body extensions while Hexacorals have six. Most deep-water corals are stony corals. Distribution Soft alt=Photo of pink branching coral Deep-water corals are widely distributed in Earth‚Äôs oceans, with large reefs/beds in the far North and far South Atlantic, as well as in the tropics in places such as the Florida coast. In the north Atlantic, the principal coral species that contribute to reef formation are Lophelia pertusa, Oculina varicosa, Madrepora oculata, Desmophyllum cristagalli, Enallopsammia rostrata, Solenosmilia variabilis, and Goniocorella dumosa. Four genera (Lophelia, Desmophyllum, Solenosmilia, and Goniocorella) constitute most deep-water coral banks at depths of . Madrepora oculata occurs as deep as and is one of a dozen species that occur globally and in all oceans, including the Subantarctic (Cairns, 1982). Colonies of Enallopsammia contribute to the framework of deep-water coral banks found at depths of in the Straits of Florida (Cairns and Stanley, 1982). =Lophelia pertusa distribution= alt=Map showing concentration of L. pertusa with greatest density in the Northeast Atlantic One of the most common species, Lophelia pertusa, lives in the Northeast and Northwest Atlantic Ocean, Brazil and off Africa‚Äôs west coast. In addition to ocean bottoms, scientists find Lophelia colonies on North Sea oil installations, although oil and gas production may introduce noxious substances into the local environment. The world's largest known deep- water Lophelia coral complex is the R√∏st Reef. It lies between deep, west of R√∏st island in the Lofoten archipelago, in Norway, inside the Arctic Circle. Discovered during a routine survey in May 2002, the reef is still largely intact. It is approximately long by wide. Some further south is the Sula Reef, located on the Sula Ridge, west of Trondheim on the mid-Norwegian Shelf, at . It is long, wide, and up to high, an area one-tenth the size of the R√∏st Reef. Discovered and mapped in 2002, Norway's Tisler Reef lies in the Skagerrak on the submarine border between Norway and Sweden at a depth of and covers an area of .Guihen, D., White, M., and Lund√§lv, T. (2012). Temperature shocks and ecological implications at a cold-water coral reef. Marine Biodiversity Records 5: 1-10. It is estimated to be 8600‚Äì8700 years old.Wisshak, M. and Ruggeberg, A. (2006). Colonisation and bioerosion of experimental substrates by benthic foraminiferans from euphotic to aphotic depths (Kosterfjord, SW Sweden). Facies 52: 1‚Äì17. The Tisler Reef contains the world‚Äôs only known yellow L. pertusa. Elsewhere in the northeastern Atlantic, Lophelia is found around the Faroe Islands, an island group between the Norwegian Sea and the Northeast Atlantic Ocean. At depths from , L. pertusa is chiefly on the Rockall Bank and on the shelf break north and west of Scotland. The Porcupine Seabight, the southern end of the Rockall Bank, and the shelf to the northwest of Donegal all exhibit large, mound-like Lophelia structures. One of them, the Therese Mound, is particularly noted for its Lophelia pertusa and Madrepora oculata colonies. Lophelia reefs are also found along the U.S. East Coast at depths of along the base of the Florida-Hatteras slope. South of Cape Lookout, NC, rising from the flat sea bed of the Blake Plateau, is a band of ridges capped with thickets of Lophelia. These are the northernmost East Coast Lophelia pertusa growths. The coral mounds and ridges here rise as much as from the plateau plain. These Lophelia communities lie in unprotected areas of potential oil and gas exploration and cable-laying operations, rendering them vulnerable to future threats. Lophelia exist around the Bay of Biscay, the Canary Islands, Portugal, Madeira, the Azores, and the western basin of the Mediterranean Sea. Darwin Mounds Among the most researched deep-water coral areas in the United Kingdom are the Darwin Mounds. Atlantic Frontier Environmental Network (AFEN) discovered them in 1998 while conducting large- scale regional sea floor surveys north of Scotland. They discovered two areas of hundreds of sand and deep-water coral mounds at depths of about in the northeast corner of the Rockall Trough, approximately northwest of the northwest tip of Scotland. Named after the research vessel Charles Darwin, the Darwin Mounds have been extensively mapped using low-frequency side-scan sonar. They cover an area of approximately and consist of two main fields‚Äîthe Darwin Mounds East, with about 75 mounds, and the Darwin Mounds West, with about 150 mounds. Other mounds are scattered in adjacent areas. Each mound is about in diameter and high. Lophelia corals and coral rubble cover the mound tops, attracting other marine life. The mounds look like 'sand volcanoes', each with a 'tail', up to several hundred meters long, all oriented downstream. Large congregations of Xenophyophores (Syringammina fragilissima) which are giant unicellular organisms that can grow up to in diameter characterize the tails and mounds. Scientists are uncertain why these organisms congregate here. The Darwin Mounds Lophelia grow on sand rather than hard substrate, unique to this area. Lophelia corals exist in Irish waters as well. =Oculina varicosa distribution= Oculina varicosa is a branching ivory coral that forms giant but slow-growing, bushy thickets on pinnacles up to in height. The Oculina Banks, so named because they consist mostly of Oculina varicosa, exist in of water along the continental shelf edge about 42‚Äì80 km (26‚Äì50 miles) off of Florida's central east coast. The Oculina Banks stretch along 170 kilometers (106 miles) reaching from Fort Pierce to Daytona. Discovered in 1975 by scientists from the Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution conducting surveys of the continental shelf, Oculina thickets grow on a series of pinnacles and ridges extending from Fort Pierce to Daytona, Florida Like the Lophelia thickets, the Oculina Banks host a wide array of macroinvertebrates and fishes. They are significant spawning grounds for commercially important food species including gag, scamp, red grouper, speckled hind, black sea bass, red porgy, rock shrimp, and calico scallop. Growth and reproduction Bubblegum coral (Paragorgia arborea) at 1257 meters water depth (California). Most corals must attach to a hard surface in order to begin growing but sea fans can also live on soft sediments. They are often found growing along bathymetric highs such as seamounts, ridges, pinnacles and mounds, on hard surfaces. Corals are sedentary, so they must live near nutrient-rich water currents. Deep-water corals feed on zooplankton and rely on ocean currents to bring food. The currents also aid in cleaning the corals. Deep-water corals grow more slowly than tropical corals because there are no zooxanthellae to feed them. Lophelia has a linear polyp extension of about per year. By contrast, branching shallow-water corals, such as Acropora, may exceed 10‚Äì20 cm/yr. Reef structure growth estimates are about per year. Scientists have also found Lophelia colonies on oil installations in the North Sea. Using coral age-dating methods, scientists have estimated that some living deep-water corals date back at least 10,000 years. Deep-water corals use nematocysts on their tentacles to stun prey. Deep-water corals feed on zooplankton, crustaceans and even krill. Coral can reproduce sexually or asexually. In asexual reproduction (budding) a polyp divides in two genetically identical pieces. Sexual reproduction requires that a sperm fertilize an egg which grows into a larva. Currents then disperse the larvae. Growth begins when the larvae attach to a solid substrate. Old/dead coral provides an excellent substrate for this growth, creating ever higher mounds of coral. As new growth surrounds the original, the new coral intercepts both water flow and accompanying nutrients, weakening and eventually killing the older organisms. Individual Lophelia pertusa colonies are entirely either female or male. Deep-water coral colonies range in size from small and solitary to large, branching tree-like structures. Larger colonies support many life forms, while nearby areas have much less. The gorgonian, Paragorgia arborea, may grow beyond three meters. However, little is known of their basic biology, including how they feed or their methods and timing of reproduction. Importance A alt=Photo of crab suspending itself by gripping a branching coral colony Deep sea corals together with other habitat-forming organisms host a rich fauna of associated organisms. Lophelia reefs can host up to 1,300 species of fish and invertebrates. Various fish aggregate on deep sea reefs. Deep sea corals, sponges and other habitat-forming animals provide protection from currents and predators, nurseries for young fish, and feeding, breeding and spawning areas for numerous fish and shellfish species. Rockfish, Atka mackerel, walleye pollock, Pacific cod, Pacific halibut, sablefish, flatfish, crabs, and other economically important species in the North Pacific inhabit these areas. Eighty-three percent of the rockfish found in one study were associated with red tree coral. Flatfish, walleye pollock and Pacific cod appear to be more commonly caught around soft corals. Dense schools of female redfish heavy with young have been observed on Lophelia reefs off Norway, suggesting the reefs are breeding or nursery areas for some species. Oculina reefs are important spawning habitat for several grouper species, as well as other fishes. Human impact The primary human impact on deep-water corals is from deep-water trawling. Trawlers drag nets across the ocean floor, disturbing sediments, breaking and destroying deep-water corals. Another harmful method is long line fishing. Oil and gas exploration also damage deep- water coral. A study conducted in 2015 found that injury observed in populations in the Mississippi Canyon in the Gulf of Mexico increased from 4 to 9 percent before the Deepwater Horizon oil spill to 38 to 50 percent after the spill (Etnoyer et al., 2015). Deep-water corals grow slowly, so recovery takes much longer than in shallow waters where nutrients and food-providing zooxanthellae are far more abundant. In a study during 2001 to 2003, a study of a reef of Lophelia pertusa in the Atlantic off Canada found that the corals were often broken in unnatural ways. And the ocean floor displayed scars and overturned boulders from trawling. In addition to these managed pressures, deep water coral reefs are also vulnerable to unmanaged pressures (e.g. ocean acidification) and in order to protect these habitats in the long-term methods which assess the relative risks of different pressures are being promoted. =Oculina Banks= Bottom trawling and natural causes like bioerosion and episodic die-offs have reduced much of Florida's Oculina Banks to rubble, drastically reducing a once-substantial fishery by destroying spawning grounds. In 1980, Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution scientists called for protective measures. In 1984, the South Atlantic Fishery Management Council (SAFMC) designated a area as a Habitat Area of Particular Concern. In 1994, an area called the Experimental Oculina Research Reserve was completely closed to bottom fishing. In 1996, the SAFMC prohibited fishing vessels from dropping anchors, grapples, or attached chains there. In 1998, the council also designated the reserve as an Essential Fish Habitat. In 2000, the deep- water Oculina Marine Protected Area was extended to . Scientists recently deployed concrete reef balls in an attempt to provide habitat for fish and coral. =Sula and R√∏st= Scientists estimate that trawling has damaged or destroyed 30 to 50 percent of the Norwegian shelf coral area. The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea, the European Commission‚Äôs main scientific advisor on fisheries and environmental issues in the northeast Atlantic, recommend mapping and closing Europe‚Äôs deep corals to fishing trawlers. In 1999, the Norwegian Ministry of Fisheries closed an area of containing the large Sula Reef to bottom trawling. In 2000, an additional area closed, covering about . An area of about enclosing the R√∏st Reef, closed in 2002. =Darwin mounds= The European Commission introduced an interim trawling ban in the Darwin Mounds area, in August 2003. A permanent ban is expected to follow. See also * Coral reef References *Etnoyer, P. J., Wickes, L. N., Silva, M., Dubick, J. D., Balthis, L., Salgado, E., & Macdonald, I. R. (2015).

His most important technical innovation was one of the world's first electrically-powered analogue computers, patented as the Argo Clock: a differential analyser which enabled big guns to engage with long- range targets when both ships were moving at speed in different directions. Early life Pollen was born on 13 September 1866, the sixth son and eighth child of eight sons and two daughters born to John Hungerford Pollen and Maria Margaret Pollen. His father being a leading convert to Catholicism along with Cardinal Newman, Arthur was educated at the school which the latter founded in Birmingham, The Oratory School (1878‚Äì1884). He then went up to read Modern History at Trinity College, Oxford where he gained a second-class degree in 1888. In 1893 he was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn. He then took an interest in parliamentary politics, standing as Liberal candidate for the Walthamstow Division of Essex in the General Election of 1895 which he lost; his 4,523 votes to the 6,876 of his opponent, Edmund Widdrington Byrne, MP, QC. After this setback he continued to speak at Liberal Party events, but declined to stand in the by-election brought about by Byrne's resignation in 1897. On 7 September 1898 he married Maud Beatrice, the only daughter of the leading Conservative politician Joseph Lawrence, (later Sir Joseph Lawrence, Bart.) who was also chairman of Linotype & Machinery Co. Ltd.Confirmed by F.C Burnand. The Catholics Who's Who & Year Book 1908 pp. 326‚Äì328. Available online via Google Books. For Linotype & Machinery Co. Ltd., see . See also Linotype machine. With Maud he had one daughter, who died aged four, and two sons.The elder son was Arthur Joseph Lawrence Pollen (1899‚Äì1968) who married 1926 Hon. Daphne Baring, a daughter of Cecil Baring, 3rd Baron Revelstoke and had issue. Their granddaughter is Clare Asquith nee Mary Clare Pollen. In 1898 Pollen was made the managing-director of Linotype, which he ran successfully for the next decade. Fire control Through a relative, Commander William Goodenough, Pollen saw a naval gunnery practice near Malta in 1900, and the accuracy was so poor that even at ranges of less than a mile the big guns could not reliably hit their targets.Pollen 'Gunnery' p. 23 On the board of the Linotype Company at the time was Lord Kelvin, widely regarded as Britain's leading scientist. It was Kelvin who proposed using an analogue computer to solve the equations which arise from the relative motion of the ships engaged in the battle and the time delay in the flight of the shell to calculate the required trajectory and therefore the direction and elevation of the guns. Kelvin's brother James Thomson was responsible for producing a tidal analyser using a ball, disc and cylinder differential analyser which was the original source of the suggested analogue computer.Pollen 'Gunnery' p. 35 However first accurate data is needed of the target's position and relative motion. Pollen developed a plotting unit (or plotter) to capture this data. He added a gyroscope to allow for the yaw of the firing ship. Again this required substantial development of the, at the time, primitive gyroscope to provide continuous reliable correction.Pollen 'Gunnery' p. 36 Pollen used the resources of Linotype for his work, specifically the services of a designer named Harold Isherwood. Trials were carried out in 1905 and 1906, which although completely unsuccessful showed promise. To further the development of fire-control Pollen set up in 1909 the Argo Company, and in 1911 took a holding in the firm of Thomas Cooke & Sons of York, who had been manufacturing components for his equipment. Early on Pollen was encouraged in his efforts by the rapidly rising figure of Admiral Jackie Fisher, Admiral Arthur Knyvet Wilson and the Director of Naval Ordnance and Torpedoes (DNO), John Jellicoe. Many officers in the navy were naturally interested in the prospect of being able to have ranges calculated for them so that they could achieve a greater rate of hits against the enemy. In early 1906, while presenting his planned \\"Aim Correction\\" system to naval officers, he met for the second time a promising gunnery lieutenant, Frederic Dreyer. The nature of Pollen's work involved close cooperation with the Navy, and upon Dreyer's appointment as Assistant to the DNO with responsibility for fire-control he was invited to view Pollen's Linotype works at Broadheath, near Altrincham. Pollen had had a long relationship with Dreyer's predecessor, Lieutenant Harding. Pollen continued his work, with tests carried out on Royal Navy warships intermittently. Equipment was repeatedly purchased, despite the misgivings of successive DNOs Reginald Bacon and Gordon Moore. Dreyer began producing his own fire-control computer. The fundamental difference between the systems was that the Dreyer system was a \\"dual rate\\" approach that plotted ranges and bearings separately, versus time rather than using a single rangefinder to take both ranges and bearings to drive the drawing of a plan view of own and target ships, as in the Argo system.Pollen Aim Correction System. Part I. Technical History and Technical Comparison with Commander F.C. Dreyer's Fire Control System The systems differed in other particulars.

Dreyer's Fire Control System, Chapter V, Figure 3 was later discarded in favour of manual plotting keyboards which were capable of plotting the data of multiple rangefinders.Handbook of Captain F. C. Dreyer's Fire Control Tables, Plate 45 Dreyer played a key role within the Admiralty in deciding which system to use, and always chose his own. Certain aspects of the Dreyer Table Mk III were found by a subsequent Royal Commission to be similar to Pollen's work and ¬£30,000 compensation was paid to Pollen in 1926 based on a theoretical number of his Argo units which might have been fitted in Royal Navy ships, most of which were never constructed. Pollen's supporters have argued that the poor performance of Naval gunnery at the Battle of JutlandPollen 'Gunnery' p. 180 and at GallipoliPollen 'Gunnery' p. 173 was due to the shortcomings of the Dreyer system, but others cite the tactics of the commander of the British battlecruisers, Vice-Admiral David Beatty.Pollen 'Gunnery' pp. 231‚Äì249 Journalism At the outbreak of World War I Pollen's relationship with the admiralty had broken down to the extent that he had been removed from the list of recognised Naval contractors. The war also interrupted negotiations which had begun with foreign navies aimed at selling the argo system to them. Some units had been purchased by Russia before the outbreak of war and some more were sold, but no other countries purchased units. Pollen was thus under-employed. He wrote to a friend, Alfred Spender, editor of the Westminster Gazette, asking whether he would be interested in articles about the naval war. Spender agreed. In April 1915 he accepted a post as a feature writer for Land and Water, making this a full-time employment rather just supplying one weekly article. His task was made easier by ongoing good relations with various naval officers he had met as part of his work on the Argo AC system. He remained in contact with James Masterton-Smith, Private secretary to the First Lord of the Admiralty, and with William Reginald Hall, who had been impressed by tests conducted on his ship, HMS Natal, and was appointed Director of Naval Intelligence shortly after the start of the war. Hall commented on the usefulness to him of a responsive journalist, should he need to present a story to the public. Pollen also embarked on a career as a lecturer, speaking at public meetings about naval affairs.Pollen 'Gunnery' pp. 146‚Äì149 After news of the Battle of Jutland began to break in Britain, based upon German reports of victory, Pollen attempted to redress the shortcomings of official reports issued by the admiralty, which as a terse statement of facts known to them, invited the worst possible interpretation of events. Writing for the 'Westminster Gazette' he attempted to stress the overarching result of the engagement, that the German fleet had fled in the presence of the British, and to spread this view amongst other journalists. This response to the news was in contrast to many other leading newspapers, which only belatedly began to regard the battle as a victory.Pollen 'Gunnery' pp. 151‚Äì155 Pollen was generally supportive of the establishment and admiralty. However, on occasions he disagreed publicly with their handling of the war. Commentators, such as Winston Churchill had written articles observing that British supremacy at sea was secured by the dominance of the British fleet over the German, even though no battle had been fought. This was in accord with theories of sea power, such as advocated by Alfred Thayer Mahan. Pollen argued that the cost in this case of the unresolved conflict was that Germany retained significant control of the Baltic Sea, and tied up the larger part of the British fleet patrolling the North Sea. The fleet might otherwise have been used combatting submarine attacks.Pollen 'Gunnery' pp. 159‚Äì162 In April 1917 Pollen wrote an article in Land and water critical of the way the war against submarine attacks was being conducted, and against failures in administrative organisation of the admiralty. This was followed by another article of 3 May arguing Britain had lost control of the seas in the face of mounting losses of merchant shipping to submarines, which drew the attention of the official censor and could not be published. Reaction to the censorship of a respected columnist inevitably led to greater publicity of the issue than if the article had been published, and its contents became known. The admiralty had resisted introducing a convoy system for merchant ships for some time, believing it was impractical and that too few naval vessels were available as escorts. By the end of April the admiralty had agreed to start forming ships into convoys, although it remains a source of debate to what extent this was a result of public pressure, the direct intervention of the prime minister, David Lloyd George or the natural result of convoy trials already being conducted. Although there was great concern at mounting shipping losses and shortages of materials and food, it also remains unclear to what extent the situation was sufficiently critical to have affected Britain's ability to conduct the war.Pollen 'Gunnery' pp. 203‚Äì212 In June 1917 Pollen embarked on a visit to America to discuss possible sales of Argo systems. He was approached by John Buchan, Director of Propaganda in the British Foreign Office, asking that he could publicise the work of the navy while there and encourage the development of the American navy. Pollen sought to address a perception amongst Americans that the British fleet had failed to defeat the German fleet, or resolve the submarine issue, thus leaving American ships open to attack. It was felt that his position as a critic of British policy added to his credibility when defending it. The success of his visit led to an offer by the British government of a knighthood and salary, should he return to America and continue a propaganda campaign. Pollen declined, arguing that he would be received entirely differently if acting in an official capacity than as an independent commentator.Pollen 'Gunnery' pp. 215‚Äì 224 =Jutland and Jellicoe= Pollen became extremely critical of the actions of the British Grand Fleet, in particular as commanded by Jellicoe. Ethel Beatty, wife of Admiral Beatty, made a point of becoming friendly with Pollen in May 1917. Pollen declared to her that he intended to have Jellicoe removed from his post as First Sea Lord within a month, and proceeded with a campaign seeking to impress his views upon anyone he could get to listen.Massie 'Castles' pp. 741‚Äì742 citing Beatty Papers II pp. 422, 429 Pollen later wrote a book about the Battle of Jutland which argued that any positive actions credited to Jellicoe must have been the work of Admiral Beatty (\\"The Navy in Battle\\", 1918). The book was described by the author of the official report on Jutland as a work which \\"teems with inaccuracies\\", and by Jellicoe's biographers as \\"full of errors\\", and \\"almost unreadable\\".Massie 'Castles' p. 677 Jellicoe wrote to a friend in 1921: \\"It fell to me to turn down his inventions on more than one occasion\\".Jellicoe 'Jellicoe Papers' II p. 412 Post-War After World War I the Argo company had effectively ceased trading, and interest in naval journalism declined. Pollen had continued as a part-time director of Linotype and now joined the board of The Birmingham Small Arms Company Limited (BSA). He became an active member of the Council of the Federation of British Industries and became its vice-president. He became chairman of the British Commonwealth Union and espoused the role of the entrepreneur in growth of industry, campaigning against the growth of socialism. In 1926 the post of managing director of Linotype became vacant, and he returned to it, hiring one of the first management consultants, T. Gerald Rose, to help reorganise the company. He was invited to become chairman of BSA, but declined, not having sufficient time to manage two companies. In 1936 he was part of a group of Catholics who acquired the Catholic magazine, The Tablet, and served as its chairman for a year while its fortunes were restored.Pollen 'Gunnery' pp. 245‚Äì249 References Bibliography    * External links * Category:1866 births Category:1937 deaths Category:Alumni of Trinity College, Oxford Category:Firearm sights Category:Control theorists Category:History of computing hardware Category:Military computers Category:People educated at The Oratory School Category:Real-time computing ","title":"Arthur Pollen"},{"id":"16730683","text":"Bent is a small hamlet in the Dutch province of South Holland.

The highway travels north along Nason Creek from an intersection with U.S. Route 2 (US 2) at Coles Corner to Chiwawa Loop Road on the eastern shore of Lake Wenatchee. SR 207 was previously signed as part of Secondary State Highway 15C (SSH 15C) and SSH 15D until the 1964 highway renumbering, when SSH 15C was split between SR 207 and SR 209\\\\. SR 209 was removed from the highway system in 1991 and SR 207 was shortened to end at the former terminus of SR 209\\\\. Route description SR 207 begins at an intersection with US 2 at Coles Corner within Wenatchee National Forest, and travels northeast parallel to Nason Creek upstream. SR 207 crosses the Wenatchee River into Lake Wenatchee State Park and crosses the Wenatchee River, where it ends at an intersection with Chiwawa Loop Road, formerly SR 209, south of Lake Wenatchee State Airport. Every year the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that between 2,000 and 2,400 vehicles per day used the highway, mostly at Coles Corner. History A road connecting a Great Northern rail line to Lake Wenatchee was built by 1904, and was designated as part of SSH 15C in 1937, traveling from PSH 15, concurrent with US 10, at Coles Corner to PSH 15 and US 10 in Leavenworth via Lake Wenatchee State Park. SSH 15D was also established in 1937, traveling west from SSH 15C to Telma. US 10 was moved south in the 1940s and replaced by US 10 Alternate, which was later replaced by US 2 in 1946. After the 1964 highway renumbering, SSH 15C was split between SR 207 and SR 209, with SSH 15D becoming an extension of SR 207. SR 209 and a segment of SR 207 from Chiwawa Loop Road to Telma were removed from the state highway system in 1991, and no major revisions to the highway have occurred since 1991.

The species name Halophila ovata is now regarded as a synonym of this species.Name Currency The plant occurs around reefs, estuaries, islands, inter-tidal areas, on soft sand or mud substrates. The leaves are ovate in outline, appearing on stems that emerge from rhizome beneath the sand. The roots get up to 800 mm long and covered in fine root hairs. It is often found in meadows that dominate a sand bank or other patch of sea floor. The arrangement of the plant, above and below ground, provides stability to the sea floor and habitat for other species. It is used as food by dugong, as is therefore known as dugong grass.

In this book, Stevenson has shown that he has the gift of taking vast quantities of knowledge and experience and translating them into lucid, sparkling prose, easily graspable by the novice, yet still interesting and instructive to the connoisseur. With The Oxford Companion to Wine, The Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia is regarded as one of the essential wine reference books in English.

There he worked with some of the most renowned Hungarian trainers and played numerous tournaments on Magyar soil. As a result, he became International Master in the summer of 1995 and later in 1996 the Absolute Mexican Champion. After four years of living in Hungary, in 1999, he put an end to his first European period returning to Mexico, where he got an offer to join a chess school for talented players in Yucatan Peninsula. There he started his fruitful career as a trainer. Amongst his pupils can be counted some GMs, IM‚Äôs and several titled players. The years of inactivity as a player, where he worked only in the interest of his pupils, reached an end as he returned to the competitive chess, winning the Memorial Capablanca in 2003 https://es.chessbase.com/post/xxxviii-capablanca-in-memoriam-1 and achieving the bronze medal, on the third board of the Mexican team at Calvia Chess Olympiad in 2004 https://www.olimpbase.org/2004/2004in.html. He has defended the Mexican team in eight chess Olympiads, seven times as a player and once as a coach. He moved back to Europe in 2004, becoming a resident of Barcelona where he still lives with his spouse and family. In the summer of 2005 he achieved his last GM norm, becoming the fourth Mexican Grandmaster. That same year his career as a trainer got a new and important boost as he was selected to direct Barcelona‚Äôs Chess Training Centre. That was a sweet period for him as some of his pupils achieved very good results in Spanish competitions. Nowadays he is still collaborating with the Catalan Chess Federation, preparing and accompanying the Catalan youngsters to various Spanish junior competitions.

Life and work Guillermo Vargas studied to be a special education teacher at the Universidad Interamericana de Costa Rica, but he did not graduate. (Spanish) Vargas describes himself as a self-taught artist. (Spanish) Vargas's media include photography, paintings, performance art, installation art, theatrical dance, and video. (Spanish) He has exhibited In Mexico, Nicaragua and Costa Rica, as well as at the Inter-American Development Bank in the United States. Vargas was chosen as one of six representatives from Costa Rica to present at the Bienal Centroamericana Honduras in 2008 and again for the Bienal del Istmo 2010. (Spanish) In June, 2010, two of Vargas's videos were to be presented at the Bienal de Pontevedra in Spain; however, after Vargas showed up wearing a T-shirt that read \\"camisETA,\\" his videos were removed from the program. (Spanish) Exposici√≥n N¬∞ 1 One of the images that spread via the Internet along with allegations that the dog was starved to death In August, 2007, Vargas displayed his \\"Exposici√≥n N¬∞ 1\\" in the C√≥dice Gallery in Managua, Nicaragua. The exposition included the burning of 175 pieces of crack cocaine and an ounce of marijuana while the Sandinista anthem played backwards. The work also included an emaciated dog tied to a wall by a length of rope with \\"Eres Lo Que Lees\\" (\\"You Are What You Read\\") written on the wall in dog food. According to Vargas, the work included a fifth element: the media. The work attracted controversy when it was reported that the dog had starved to death as part of Vargas's work.(Spanish) Photographs of the exhibit appeared on the Internet, showing the dog tied to the wall in a room full of standing people. There are no indications in the photos of where or when they were taken, nor of who took them. The outrage triggered by the photos and the allegations that the dog had been left to starve to death quickly spread internationally via blogs, e-mails, and other unconfirmed sources, including internet petitions to prevent Vargas from participating in the 2008 Bienal Centroamericana in Honduras that received over four million signatures. Vargas has endorsed the petition, saying that he, too, has signed it. (Spanish) Juanita Berm√∫dez, the director of the C√≥dice Gallery, stated that the animal was fed regularly and was only tied up for three hours on one day before it escaped. (Spanish) Vargas himself refused to comment on the fate of the dog, but noted that no one tried to free the dog, give it food, call the police, or do anything for the dog. Vargas stated that the exhibit and the surrounding controversy highlight people's hypocrisy because no one cares about a dog that starves to death in the street. In an interview with El Tiempo, Vargas explained that he was inspired by the death of Natividad Canda, an indigent Nicaraguan addict, who was killed by two Rottweilers in Cartago Province, Costa Rica, while being filmed by the news media in the presence of police, firefighters, and security guards. (Spanish) Upon conducting a probe, the Humane Society of the United States was informed that the dog was in a state of starvation when it was captured and escaped after one day of captivity; however, the organization also categorically condemned \\"the use of live animals in exhibits such as this.\\" The World Society for the Protection of Animals (WSPA) also investigated the exhibit. WSPA found the information regarding the issue to be \\"inconsistent\\" and met with sponsors of the Honduras Bienal to ensure that no animals would be abused at the 2008 exhibition in that country. Axioma In December 2013, Vargas presented his work Axioma in a gallery in Heredia, Costa Rica. Habacuc presented a healthy dog (named Axioma) and promised to begin a blog, publishing one photo per day of the dog until the Costa Rican elections in February 2014. The photos were said to show the effects of the passing of time on the dog and were to paired with images of the \\"myths\\" reported in the official report on the state of the nation. (Spanish) Vargas was accused of planning to document the starvation of the dog. The animal welfare organization Asesor√≠a Legal Animal published one of the photos on Facebook, asking for help in stopping Vargas. (Spanish) In the ensuing controversy, the blog was taken down, and the Costa Rican National Animal Health Service investigated the case, finding the dog in good health. Vargas explained that he had found the dog in the street in 2010 and had documented its recuperation over time. (Spanish) The idea had been to upload the photos of the dog's recuperation in reverse order. Vargas described the reaction to his work as typical of a world in which people form opinions without being informed.

The highway travels northeast parallel to the Okanogan River from SR 20 in Okanogan to SR 155 Spur in Downtown Omak. SR 215 turns east to end at an intersection with SR 20 and U.S. Route 97 (US 97) in North Omak. The highway was previously part of State Road 10 and Primary State Highway 10 (PSH 10), concurrent with US 97, until a bypass of Omak was built in the 1960s. SR 20 was routed onto the highway after the 1964 highway renumbering, but was moved to the bypass and replaced by SR 215 in 1973. Route description SR 215 begins as 2nd Avenue in Okanogan at an intersection with SR 20, which turns southeast to cross the Okanogan River. 2nd Avenue crosses over Salmon Creek before it empties into the Okanogan River at Alma Park. The highway continues northeast and passes the Okanogan Community Library before leaving Okanogan for Omak, becoming Elmway. SR 215 passes the Omak Memorial Cemetery and Mid-Valley Hospital before becoming Okoma Drive and entering Downtown Omak. The roadway turns east onto 4th Avenue and back north onto Main Street, passing the local post office, before intersecting Omak Avenue, signed as SR 155 Spur. Main Street continues north and passes the Omak campus of Wenatchee Valley College, before turning east onto Riverside Drive and ending at an intersection with SR 20 and US 97. Every year the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2011, WSDOT calculated that between 4,200 and 13,000 vehicles per day used the highway, mostly in Downtown Omak. History A north-south road connecting Okanogan to Omak along the Okanogan River has existed since 1903, and was designated as part of State Road 10 in 1905. The highway was named the Chelan and Okanogan Highway in 1919 and became part of US 97 in 1926 during the creation of the United States Numbered Highways, and became PSH 10 during the creation of the Primary and secondary state highways in 1937. Beginning in 1962, a bypass of Omak was constructed on the east side of the Okanogan River, and US 97 was re- routed onto it in 1967. SSH 16A was created using the old alignment of US 97 and PSH 10, extending from PSH 16 in Okanogan to US 97 and PSH 10 in Omak. After the 1964 highway renumbering, SSH 16A became part of SR 20 and was signed into law in 1970, however SR 20 was extended east along US 97 and the old route became SR 215 in 1973. No major revisions to the route of the highway has occurred since 1973.

This length feature is produced by the National Film Board of Canada (NFB). Synopsis In the 1930s, in the throes of the Great Depression, the government of Quebec relocated more than 80,000 citizens to found a new settlement in the virgin forests of Quebec's Abitibi region. After enduring backbreaking work to clear the land, however, many left, seeking a better life in the city or as labourers for the large corporations that had come to exploit the North's valuable resources. The Lalancette family, however, have persisted in forging their future on the land from one generation to the next, earning their keep from farming, and defying the constraints of globalization and the mining and forestry companies that control the area. Revisiting the heritage of Quebec filmmakers who documented Abitibi, following in the footsteps of Pierre Perrault, among others, this documentary traces a defining chapter of Quebec history and raises fundamental questions about regional development.

The population is more than 20,000. The meaning of the name of this village is 'Killing the Tigers'. In times prior to Independence of India (1947), the area was deeply forested and populated with wild animals. History The first mention of this village in chronicled history appears in the Madala Panji entries recorded during the reign of Gajapati Shri Mukunda Deva Maharaj, the last of the Gajapatis of State of Orissa and Khurda King Raja Ramachandra Dev-I. This Gajapati Mukunda Deva's summer residence was transferred to the village Baghamari during the heights of Paika Rebellion (Mutiny of the Peasant Warriors) of 1817 A.D. Baghamari remained the main centre of strategic resistance for a short time during that period. Baghamari was one out of the 74 'Gadas' (military strongholds) in the Khurda area at the command of the then Gajapati King of Khurda during the Paika Rebellion. Thereafter, the village appears in military history of Orissa as chronicled by the war records-keeper Shri Brajanath BadaJena.  Geography  Baghmari is located at co-ordinates . The Kenduli River, which is a tributary of the Mahanadi, flows through the Western-Northern flank of the village and almost outline the extent of the village in these directions. The main locality the village is surrounded on all sides by green paddy fields. On the south-eastern boundary of the village, there is the famous hot-spring of Atri. The Atri hot-spring is a typical sulphur spring. There are now more than 25 baths and 2 pools in a lush green setting. This hot-spring acts as a big tourist attraction of the region.  Demography  The population of the village is more than 20,000. The sex ratio of the village is close to 972 females per 1000 males. The village can be said to be located on the southern side of the State Highway No. 1. There are 7 major localities in the village, called the 'Sahis'. Originally, the 'Sahis' had been formed on the basis of occupational homogeneity and concept of 'Clan'. However, presently, there has been enormous inter-mixing and mingling among the 'sahis' leading to a mixed occupational structure in the 'sahis'. Settlement Pattern/Structural Lay-out of the Village Layout of Baghamari The village has two distinct areas of concentrated settlement, thus making the form that of a fragmented 'double village'. The larger settlement is of polygonal pattern on account of the influence of State Highway No. 1 on settlement structure. However, the settlement in the secondary settlement region is circular. The internal lanes are clustered with rectangular houses on both sides.  Economy  Backbone of economy of this village is agriculture. Stone quarrying also contributes to income of the inhabitants. The village of Baghamari is located on a fork (One arm leading to Nayagarh city and the other to Banki city) of State Highway No. 1. Because of its vantage location, the village acts as a central place to nearby regions. In agriculture, on account of the absence of irrigation facilities, the only 2 crops could be grown on the fields. Migration Forces of urbanization and globalization have led to emergence of 'pull' factors like better employment opportunities, higher income earning potential etc.. These have resulted in out-migration of large numbers of inhabitants of the village Baghamri to nearby townships of Khurda and city of Bhubaneswar, creating geographies of economic displacement. The complex process of migration have resulted in drastic alterations in the web of social relations and cultural affinities in Baghamri's rural fabric, and have erased the simplistic notions of homogeneous rural cultures as regarded in normal Odia cultural paradigms. Educational Scenario The educational scenario in the village is not satisfactory. Alpha-numeric literacy in the village is mere 63%, which is higher than the State average. There is only one school named the Raghunath Dev School for basic, primary, secondary and high school education. Places of tourist interest Hattakeshwara =Atri hot spring= Atri hot spring is situated in the village of Baghamari. Atri has a sulfur hot-Spring (Locally called the 'Kua Kunda' - Crow's Tank). Atri also has a famous temple dedicated to Lord Hatakeswara (a variant of Lord Shiva). The Famous Makar Mela is celebrated here at the time of makar sakranti (as of Hindu calendar) for 30 days. Nearly 100,000 people gather here to see the mela in the first day of mela. On 2016, First time Mela is arranged by odisha tourisim department for 3 days with cultural programme. Junction The junction divides the SH-1 to two parts one goes with SH-1 to Balangir and other one goes to the famous Kantilo where Nilamadhab temple is situated.

Humanae vitae was essential for the Church in Poland to continue its struggle with the government. Background The Catholic Church in Poland suffered much during German occupation but its persecution continued and even intensified under the Stalinist regimes until 1956. With the change of leadership to W≈Çadys≈Çaw Gomu≈Çka, relations improved, but continued to be difficult. Attempts to threaten the Church and paint it as anti-modern and reactionary became more subtle.L'Osservatore Romano, July 11‚Äì12, 1960 One element was a governmental campaign for abortion and birth control. This took place against the background of the largest birth rate in Europe. The population grew annually by 500,000 persons. About 57,000 abortions were reported in the first quarter of 1960. The Polish hierarchy responded forcefully, by placing Poland in the millennium year of its Christianisation under the theme \\"Respect for life\\". HK 1960-1961, 15, 172 Cardinal Wyszy≈Ñski In the following years, Cardinal Stefan Wyszy≈Ñski campaigned hard against birth control and abortion, claiming that they are immoral and unnecessary since Poland was large enough to feed not only the existing thirty, but eighty million Poles. Gomu≈Çka replied publicly, asking the Church for miraculous means to solve the nation's food and economic problems especially in housing and employment. * The Polish state accepts that the Church cannot alter its position on birth control, but she should display more understanding for a modern society. Instead she refuses to live in the spirit of coexistence and tolerance and is disloyal to the Polish State. Gomu≈Çka and his government succeeded in large Polish cities like Warsaw, where according to statistics, birth control was very much in fashion. Cardinal Wyszy≈Ñski was therefore concerned about the \\"growing fear of professing faith in the Polish countryside and the need to fight for its Catholic social and cultural identity and autonomy\\" Micewski, 293 He needed Vatican support and handed Pope Paul VI a letter of thanks for Humanae vitae, signed by Polish physicians including 100 university professors. A second letter to the Pope was signed by 100 large families some of which had more than a dozen children.Micewski, 294 For the Church in Poland, birth control, as part of the ongoing struggle with the regime, was not only a matter of theology, it was also a matter of continued Church influence and survival. A change of birth control policy by the Vatican in Humanae vitae could have implied a major loss of face, and a weakening of the hierarchy of the Catholic Church within Poland.

Swix was the first producer of modern ski wax, and had a scientific approach to the challenge. The wax was colour-coded according to type, a practice that has since been adopted by the entire ski wax industry. Production was in Sk√•ne in Sweden and in Fjellhamar near Oslo, Norway. By 1964 all production had been moved to Norway. In 1974, Swix bought Liljedahls Skistavfabrikk in Lillehammer, bringing the brand under the Swix name and becoming a leading ski pole manufacturer. Swix was bought by Ferd in 1978. In 1989, Swix bought Norheim, which was once owned by Gresvig AS, and has since been expanding into the technical sportswear market.

The company presents an annual summer season of three fully staged and orchestrated productions: a traditional opera, a piece of classical music theater, and an American opera. Opera North productions are staged at the Lebanon Opera House. Opera North is a member of Opera America. History Opera North was founded as the Light Opera of Norwich in 1981 as an offshoot of the Parish Players, a community theater in Thetford, Vermont, by David Strohmier. At this time the company was merely a non-profit community theater organization. Under Strohmier's leadership the company focused mostly on light opera and operettas with a particular focus on the works of Gilbert and Sullivan. Strohmier worked closely with Louis Burkot, the then director of the Dartmouth Glee Club. After Strohmier's departure in 1987, Burkot became artistic director of the company and began moving Opera North towards a more serious operatic repertoire. The 1988 Opera North hired producer Flo Klausner and opera director Ron Luchsinger for the company's production of Gilbert and Sullivan's Iolanthe. Since then Klausner has served as executive producer for many of Opera North's productions, and Luchsinger became Director of Productions for the company. Klausner and Luchsinger were involved in changing Opera North into a professional regional opera company. In 1996, Opera North hired executive director Patricia Compton and officially became a professional opera company. Compton stayed with the company until 2006 when Risa Bridges-Hall joined Opera North as the first full-time executive director of the company. In 2009, former opera soprano Pamela A. Pantos became the second full-time executive director of the company. During her six years with the company, Pantos put the company on more solid financial footing and implemented a strategic plan that increased ticket sales by an average of 15% over the last three seasons. In 2011, the company was devastated by Hurricane Irene, and Pantos worked with the Board of Directors to secure donations to cover the enormous resulting loss of costuming and props. Pantos was named one of New Hampshire's four Outstanding Women in Business for 2014 by New Hampshire Business Review. The 2014 Opera North Summer Festival included the production of Giuseppe Verdi's La traviata, Lerner and Loewe's My Fair Lady, and Kurt Weill's Street Scene.

It was intended as an updated version of John Ford's 1935 film The Informer, based on the book of the same name by Liam O'Flaherty, but the setting was transposed from Dublin, Ireland to Cleveland, Ohio, United States. The soundtrack was performed by Booker T. & the MG's. The film opens with documentary footage of the funeral procession of Martin Luther King, Jr., which is used as a backdrop for the film's fictional narrative. The film was released on DVD by Olive Films on October 16, 2012. Plot In Cleveland, Ohio, at the time of the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., protesters riot in the streets. Johnny Wells (Max Julien), a charismatic black revolutionary, leads a group of black men on a mission to steal guns from a warehouse as preparation for violent racial conflict. Johnny's best friend Tank (Julian Mayfield), who formerly worked at the steel mill with several of the men, is supposed to help with the robbery, but when the group goes to his house, they find him drunk and watching the television coverage of King's funeral. Tank is a middle-aged, unemployed alcoholic who supported King's non- violent approach, which the others have rejected in favor of violent revolution. It is later revealed that Tank lost his longtime job at the steel mill when he attacked a white co-worker who harassed the black mill workers. As a result, Tank was sent to prison and since being released, has been unable to find work. The black revolutionary group is going through a deeper radicalization, and they see Tank's inconsistent behavior as threatening to their cause. Johnny tries to sober Tank up and talk him into coming along on the robbery, but Tank, drunk and upset, finally refuses to go. Johnny, noting that this isn't the first time Tank has let them down, leaves without him. At first things go smoothly because the white security guard is asleep, but since the robbers are short one man, Johnny needs to make a second trip into the warehouse to steal enough guns, and the guard wakes up and fires on the robbers. Johnny returns fire, killing the guard. In the melee, Johnny leaves behind his sweater with his name tag in it, and thus becomes a wanted man. The next day, Tank, feeling remorseful, goes to visit B.G. (Raymond St. Jacques), the leader of the revolutionary group, and his girlfriend Jeannie (Janet MacLachlan), who is Johnny's sister. B.G. and Jeannie are angry that Tank failed to help with the robbery, and Jeannie blames him for Johnny ending up a fugitive. Tank begs B.G. to find him work as a bodyguard, pointing out that he is broke. But B.G. tells him the committee has decided to expel him from the group due to his drinking and unreliability, noting that they don't have time to run a rehab. On the street, Tank meets Clarence \\"Daisy\\" (Roscoe Lee Browne), a homosexual black man who makes good money as a police informant. Daisy brings Tank to his fancy apartment, plies him with drink, and shows him two photographs: one of them shows Tank fighting two police officers during a riot, and the other one is Johnny's wanted poster advertising a $1,000 reward for information. Daisy suggests that if Tank helps find Johnny, then Daisy might make the photo of Tank fighting the officers disappear from the police files. The disillusioned Tank seeks comfort from his girlfriend Laurie (Ruby Dee), a single mother who lives in the Hough ghetto neighborhood and supports her two small children through a combination of welfare and prostitution. When Tank arrives at Laurie's house, he has to hide because the representative of the welfare office is visiting Laurie to verify that she does not \\"have a man around,\\" which would cause her welfare benefits to be terminated. The representative spots Tank and starts berating him and putting him down for not working and supporting his children (though Laurie argues they aren't his). Tank, who is already feeling bad about himself, angrily throws the representative into the street where he is nearly hit by a car. Tank begs Laurie to come away with him, but Laurie, upset about losing her meager welfare benefits and Tank not having any money to give her, dumps him. When Tank is leaving Laurie's, a voice calls him from inside of a burnt house. It is Johnny, who has been hiding near Laurie's house looking for Tank. Johnny tells Tank he doesn't blame him for the failed robbery, saying Tank is \\"from another era\\" and not prepared to join in revolutionary activities. Johnny also tells Tank that he plans to leave town, but needs to visit his sick mother first, though it's risky. He asks Tank to go to the revolutionaries' meeting that night and have them send some men to watch outside his mother's house while he visits. Tank begs Johnny to please talk to B.G. about getting him reinstated in the revolutionary group. They leave each other saying they love each other. Tank bursts in on the revolutionaries' meeting and relays the message from Johnny. B.G. sends men to Johnny's house but when Tank tries to go as well, B.G. won't let him and reiterates that he is out of the group. Tank argues that Johnny trusted him to deliver the message, and B.G. says that Johnny was the one who told them to get rid of Tank. Tank, stunned and upset by this news, walks out of the meeting, goes to the police station and informs on Johnny. The police rush to Johnny's mother's apartment and shoot Johnny dead as he tries to escape. Meanwhile Tank goes to a bar and uses the reward money to buy everybody many drinks. The bar patrons assume Tank won his money in the local numbers game lottery. Tank then wanders aimlessly around town, donating money to a street preacher, visiting the steel factory where he worked for 20 years, and stopping at an amusement arcade where he shoots a cowboy puppet and rambles about black revolution with some wealthy, slumming white people in front of \\"fun-house\\" distortion mirrors. After a long night of drinking and wandering, a drunken Tank goes to Johnny's wake, where he sees Johnny's grieving mother, sister and revolutionary friends. His guilty demeanor, plus leaving a large donation in the collection for Johnny's family, arouses the suspicions of B.G. and the others. Tank tries to deflect their suspicion onto Daisy, but when they confront Daisy, Daisy convinces them that Tank was actually the informant. The revolutionaries question Tank and hold their version of a trial, and Tank is sentenced to death. Two of his ex- comrades take him out to a burning scrapyard to kill him, but he manages to get away, hop a passing train, and hide in a rundown hotel on the edge of the Flats, an industrial area. He calls Laurie, who visits him. He confesses to her what he did, and they both recognize he is \\"a dead man\\". Tank says he doesn't understand why he did it, and that Laurie and Johnny were the only people in the world he ever loved. Laurie says she loves him. Tank leaves the hotel and wanders through the Flats. The men assigned to kill him see him, and pursue him to an area where iron ore is kept in huge piles. Tank climbs to a platform over an ore pile, and waves and shouts at them. One of the men can't bring himself to shoot Tank, so the other one grabs the gun and fires. Tank, dying, falls from the platform into the ore pile. A giant excavator dumps several tons of iron ore over his body. Cast * Raymond St. Jacques as B.

His early research, carried out under the auspices of the University of California, Berkeley, focused on the Hupa and adjacent Athabaskan groups in northwestern California. After moving to New York in 1909 at the invitation of Franz Boas his scope expanded to include the Athabaskans of the Southwest, Canada, and Alaska. During the 1910s and 1920s. as Boas's junior colleague at the American Museum of Natural History and Columbia University, Goddard played a major role in creating the academic infrastructure for American Indian linguistics and anthropology in North America. Life and Works = The California Years = Goddard was born in Lewiston, Maine, on November 24, 1869, into a Quaker family of modest means. He attended Earlham College in Richmond, Indiana (A.B. 1892, M.A. 1896), where he studied Classics. Between 1892 and 1896 he taught Latin in secondary schools in Indiana and Kansas, but the hard economic times of the mid-1890s led him to accept a position as an interdenominational missionary to the Hupa of northwestern California. Finding it necessary to learn enough of the Hupa language to communicate with his flock, Goddard soon became engrossed in analyzing a linguistic system radically different from any he had previously studied. In 1900 he resigned from his missionary post and began graduate study at Berkeley. The following year he was given an Assistantship in the university's newly formed Anthropology department, joining Alfred L. Kroeber, who had been hired to administer the fledgeling program. Photograph by Goddard of Black Rock in Mendocino County, California Goddard was awarded a Ph.D. in 1904 for a detailed grammatical study of Hupa,Published as Goddard (1905). the first doctorate in anthropological linguistics granted by any American university. He was promoted to Assistant Professor in 1906 and had responsibility for much of the undergraduate instruction in anthropology and linguistics offered by the university. After finishing his documentation of Hupa, Goddard devoted most of his summers to amassing data on the other surviving varieties of California Athabaskan, traveling hundreds of miles on muleback in search of speakers of such languages as Kato, Wailaki, and Sinkyone.Much of this material remains unpublished Finding Aid to the Ethnological Documents of the Department and Museum of Anthropology, University of California, Berkeley, 1875-1958. Goddard's preferred technique of working from narrative texts rather than wordlists was in advance of its time, and his notes continue to be of interest.A. L. Kroeber, Goddard's California Athabascan texts. IJAL 33, 269-275, 1967 The most significant source of unpublished Goddard material is his set of notebooks, compiled between 1902 and 1908, that are archived at the American Philosophical Society (APS) in Philadelphia. The notebooks were originally housed at the University of California, Berkeley, but were sent to the APS in the 1940s to become part of that institution's Franz Boas Collection. The notebooks contain interviews with elderly Indians from several tribal groups, including those groups most commonly referred to as the Sinkyone, Mattole, Nongatl, Tolowa, Chilula, Whilkut, Tsnungwe, and Hupa. Much of the material consists of vocabularies and stories, but there are substantial sections containing precise geographical information. Transcriptions of the geographical information have been created by the Cultural Resources Facility, Humboldt State University, Arcata, California.Selected Notebooks of Pliny Earle Goddard Relating to Humboldt County Tribes. Jerry Rohde, ed. A set of PDF files archived at the Cultural Resources Facility, Humboldt State University, Arcata, CA. In addition to the APS notebooks relating to California Athabascan Indians, Professor Melville Jacobs of the University of Washington Department of Anthropology received four Goddard notebooks relating to the Lassik tribe. = The New York Years = In 1909 the substantial subvention from Regent Phoebe Apperson Hearst that had supported much of UC's anthropological research during the early years of the century was greatly reduced, and a fierce contest ensued between Kroeber and Goddard for control of the diminished program.Golla 1984 When Kroeber emerged victorious, Goddard resigned to take a curatorship in ethnology at the American Museum of Natural History, in New York, engineered for him by Franz Boas. From this position Goddard came to exert wide influence, primarily as a writer on general ethnological topics and as the editor of the American Anthropologist (1915‚Äì20). Goddard became a forceful proponent of Boas's views in anthropology and linguistics, in particular of Boas's conservative view of the validity of deep linguistic relationships. In 1917 Boas and Goddard co- founded and edited the International Journal of American Linguistics, which soon became the principal organ of American Indian linguistic scholarship. = The Dispute with Sapir over Athabaskan Tone = Goddard continued his Athabaskan linguistic research with trips to the Southwest and to Canada, as well as several return visits to California. This work, however, was increasingly overshadowed by that of Edward Sapir, who had begun his own research on Athabaskan in 1922 with a field study of Sarsi. Sapir's interest in Athabaskan was ultimately grounded in his conviction that the \\"Na-Dene\\" relationship that connected Athabaskan, Tlingit, and Haida was part of a much older historical relationship that included Chinese and TibetanThe Similarity of Chinese and Indian Languages, Science 62, no. 1607, supplement of 16 October 1925, p. xii (summary of an interview with Sapir) He believed that decisive evidence in support of the \\"Sino-Dene\\" hypothesis was his discovery in Sarsi of a tonal system \\"so fundamental...to the phonetic and morphological understanding of [the language] that it is inconceivable that it should not be shared by the other Athabaskan dialects as well.\\"Edward Sapir, Pitch accent in Sarcee, Journal, Soci√©t√© des Am√©ricanistes de Paris 17, 185, 1925 This claim brought Sapir into direct conflict with Goddard, who had reported no tonal contrasts in California Athabaskan, in Navajo or Apache, or in the three Canadian languages he had studied, Sarcee, Chipewyan, and Beaver. Goddard wisely chose not to dispute the presence of tonal contrasts in the Southwestern and Canadian languages (they are indeed tone languages), but he stood his ground with Hupa, devoting what would be his last published paper (1928) to a close examination of mechanical tracings of Hupa speech, none of which showed evidence of regular differences in pitch. By this time, however. Sapir had had ample opportunity to hear Hupa himself, and for his graduate student Li Fang-Kuei, a native speaker of Mandarin, to hear two other California Athabaskan languages, and to observe their complete lack of tonal contrasts.Edward Sapir. A summary report of field work among the Hupa, summer of 1927. American Anthropologist 30, 359-361, 1928 Goddard apparently did not see Sapir's concession before dying quite suddenly on July 12, 1928. during the heat of a New York summer, at the age of 59. = Family and Personal Life = One of Goddard's sons, David R. Goddard (1908-1985), also attended UC Berkeley, where he studied botany. He went on to have a distinguished academic career as a plant physiologist and geneticist. He was nominated to the National Academy of Science and served as Provost of the University of Pennsylvania. In the early 1920s Goddard left his wife and children and began a relationship with Gladys A. Reichard (1893-1955), which continued until his death. Although the couple lived together openly, the relationship was as much an intellectual partnership as it was a romantic one. Reichard accompanied Goddard during his field trips to the Southwest and California and began her long-term research on Navajo under his tutelage.Julia S. Falk, Women, Language and Linguistics: Three American Stories from the First Half of the Twentieth Century. Routledge, 1999. = Personality = A. L. Kroeber wrote of Goddard: Where an issue concerned chiefly himself, a sense of futility seemed often to invade him: he became half-hearted, non-resistant, sometimes pacifistically resigned. He needed a cause to bring out his best; in a cause, his eye lit up, the steel in him flashed, and he rejoiced in the cleanness of combat. All his life he was a hero-worshipper: and he threw into the worship a quality of heroism of his own, as well as endless devotion. There flowed in him in these qualities much of his ancestral Quakerism, of which even external mannerisms persisted as symbols long after he had given up its formal tenets. Essentially he remained a Quaker to the end‚Äîidealist, devotee of the simple in humanity and the direct in relations, martyr if necessary. His habits were consistent. He was personally frugal to abstemiousness, fond of the homespun in speech and manner, distrustful of all incitements from the outer world, little susceptible to the esthetic forms of emotion, but sensitively responsive to the emotions of living beings. Often almost shy in casual company or official relation, he was frankness itself in the contact of man to man, and then not only at ease but overflowing with playfulness and quite unusual charm. His wit was pungent to bitingness; his fundamental humility unwavering and unabashed; his friendships were loyalties.A. L. Kroeber, [Obituary of] Pliny Earle Goddard.

It is the prototype for the FK Comae Berenices (FK Com) class of variable stars. The variability of FK Com stars may be caused by large, cool spots on the rotating surfaces of the stars. This star is thought to be the result of a recent binary merger, resulting in a high rate of both spin and magnetic activity. The spectral class of FK Comae Berenices is G4 III, although it is considered unusual in having very broad absorption lines as well as some emission lines. The broadened spectral lines are due to rapid rotation. The rotation rate of FK Comae Berenices is unusually fast for a cool giant star. It is speculated that this is due to the merger of a contact binary pair of stars into a single star. The rotation produces extremely strong magnetic fields which are expected to brake the star to a slower rotation rate. Analysis of variability due to star spots on the surface show that the star rotates at different speeds at different latitudes. FK Comae Berenices is listed as a companion to the slightly brighter HD 117567. The two are not thought to be physically associated, with HD 117567 being a much closer F2 main sequence star.

He died in York, England, on October 1, 2009. Early life and education Charles Tanford was born in Halle, Germany in 1921 to Majer and Charlotte Tannenbaum. His parents, who were Jewish, fled to England in 1929 anticipating the coming rule of the Nazi Party, and changed their name to Tanford. At the outbreak of war in Europe in 1939, Tanford was sent to New York to live with relatives. Despite Tanford's attempts to persuade them to leave, many of his relatives stayed behind in Germany and subsequently perished in the Holocaust. While in the United States, Tanford earned a B.A. in chemistry from New York University in 1943 and worked on the Manhattan Project in Oak Ridge. In 1947, Tanford received his Ph.D. in Chemistry at Princeton University, working on combustion. He is credited with contributing to the \\"Tanford-Pease Theory of burning velocity\\". After graduating from Princeton, Tanford spent two years at Harvard University in the laboratory of E. J. Cohn and John Edsall, where he changed his research focus to protein biochemistry. Independent career Tanford was hired as an assistant professor by the University of Iowa, where, in 1954, he was then promoted to associate professor and, again, in 1959, to full professor. In 1960, Tanford joined the faculty at Duke University as a professor of biochemistry. In 1970, he was named James B. Duke Professor of Biochemistry. He moved to the Department of Physiology in 1980, where his research efforts were concentrated on the movement of ions across cell membranes together with his collaborators Dr. E. A. Johnson and Dr. Jacqueline Reynolds. In 1994 Tanford recalled, \\"I had been stimulated by Walter Kauzmann to move into protein chemistry and that made it logical that 'large molecules' should be my domain.\\"C. Tanford (1994) Recollections: Macromolecules Protein Science 3:857‚Äì61 His postdoctoral research was concerned with physical chemistry inspired by Kai Linderstrom- Lang. He wrote, \\"What I had been taught was the more elegant process of using equations: equations that linked thermodynamic properties, dielectric constant and dipole moment, binding equilibria, and a host of other possibilities to revealing molecular characteristics.\\" His book on macromolecules, The Physical Chemistry of Macromolecules (1961) took ten years to write, and peer review \\"came only after submission of the final manuscript, and when it came it was a disaster. There were 2 reviewers and their criticism was scathing; I had got it all wrong, they said, and the book was declared effectively unpublishable...John Wiley & Sons reluctantly agreed to publish...the book was in fact a success...\\"C. Tanford 1994 In 1973 Tanford published The Hydrophobic Effect, which covered proteins in all their various guises including those within cell membranes. Although he popularized the term hydrophobic effect, in all his publications he attributed the origin of this concept to G.S. Hartley and the later efforts of Walter Kauzmann. Tanford gave great credit to the giants upon whose shoulders he stood. In 1981, Tanford became a founding member of the World Cultural Council. Developing the theme of proteins as autonomous effectors, like robots, Charles and Jacqueline wrote Nature's Robots: A history of proteins, published by Oxford University Press in 2001. Tanford retired in 1988 but remained James B. Duke Professor Emeritus in the Department of Cell Biology until his death in 2009. Honors In recognition of his scientific contributions, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences Directory search and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He was also awarded fellowships from the Guggenheim and Alexander von Humboldt Foundations (1984). He received the Merck Award for Molecular Biology. He was distinguished Eastman Professorship at Oxford. On August 28, 2017, the Charles-Tanford-Proteinzentrum was opened in Halle (Saale), city of his birth, by Prof. Dr. Johanna Wanka, Federal Minister of Science and Education. Personal life While at Harvard, he married Lucia L. Brown. They had three children, Vicki, Alex and Sarah. Charles was divorced in 1968, and soon thereafter began a professional and personal relationship with Dr. Jacqueline A. Reynolds, a fellow biochemist, that would last until his death. Dr. Reynolds and Tanford's blended family include Jackie's children, Tom Reynolds (d.2000), Ben Reynolds, Deborah Reynolds Jackson, and Rebecca Reynolds Newton. He and Reynolds retired in 1988 to Easingwold, England, a remote Georgian market town in North Yorkshire. There, he began a second career writing about the history of science primarily for lay readers. He and Reynolds published two travel books A Travel Guide to the Scientific Sites of the British Isles: A Guide to the People, Places and Landmarks and The Scientific Traveler: a Guide to the People, Places and Institutions of Europe. They were also frequent contributors to the British scientific magazine Nature. Throughout his life, Tanford was known for conversation, walking, wine, good food, travel, cricket, hiking, Switzerland, France, classical music, murder mysteries and birds.

The highway serves to connect the unincorporated community of Paterson to the county seat Prosser. The highway has existed since at least 1926 and was designated as Primary State Highway 8E from 1937 until the 1964 renumbering of Washington state highways.  Route description  Washington State Route 221 (SR 221) starts at an intersection with SR 14 in the unincorporated community of Paterson. After leaving Paterson the highway travels north through rural farm land as a two-lane highway. A few minor roads are intersected before the roadway turns to the west after about , before turning back to the north. After the highway resumes its northerly course it climbs into the Horse Heaven Hills, gaining a passing lane through the uphill segments, before finally terminating at SR 22 in south Prosser. Every year the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2009, WSDOT calculated that as few as 2,000 cars traveled through the central part of the highway, and as many as 2,500 cars at the interchange with SR 22.  History  The roadway on its current alignment has existed since at least 1926, however there are records of a road between Paterson and Prosser since 1906. The highway was designated Secondary State Highway 8E (SSH 8E) in 1937, but the route number was changed to SR 221 during the 1964 state highway renumbering. High winds have forced the closure of SR 221 in 2003, 2004, and 2005 due to large amounts of dust being blown around, causing visibility to drop to almost zero through the Horse Heaven Hills.

Curtin to mean: ‚Äúcommunities of merchants living among aliens in associated networks‚Äù.Gosch, Steve. \\"Cross Cultural Trade as a Framework for Teaching World History: Concepts and Applications.\\" The History Teacher 27, no. 4 (1994): 427. History Trading diasporas were formed as a result of international trade that resulted in the settlement of merchants in certain countries where they sold their products. Their importance to the global world was marked by their impact on the spread of cultures and ideologies of certain areas to the rest of the world. First mention of trading diasporas dates back around 2000 BCE when the Assyrian merchants traveled to the Anatolian Peninsula in order to sell their goods.Gosch, 427 Trading diasporas in this period of time were created as a result of the Assyrian traders staying as ‚Äúsemi-permanent residents‚Äù in cities of the Anatolian peninsula. According to Steve Gosch of the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìEau Claire divides the Assyrian traders into ‚Äústayers‚Äù and ‚Äúmovers.‚ÄùGosch , 428 Gosch further explains that ‚Äústayers‚Äù were the merchants who permanently settled on the Anatolian peninsula while ‚Äúmovers‚Äù traveled back and forth in order to sell their goods. According to Jane Schneider, the merchants trading prior to 15th century were able to create ‚Äúasymmetrical links between world regions.‚ÄùGosch , 429 Barry Gillis and Andre Gunder Frank go on to say that ‚Äúthe earliest world system contained the essential features of its modern counterpart: asymmetrical relationships between regions in the core and periphery, continuing struggles for hegemony within the core and alternating periods of expansion and contraction in the system as a whole.‚Äù This means that the relations between different regions in the early modern world were not perfect and differed from the international relations of the modern time. Trading diasporas were able to create cultural and economical ties with different regions rather than a political relationship. Causes There are several reasons for the creation of trading diasporas some of which included a demand for products that were not available in particular regions of the world, the division of the world into small city states who wanted to create economic and cultural ties with the rest of the world and the willingness of people living in certain areas to create their communities abroad and to be represented by them. As Gosch explains ‚Äúpremodern world system was to some extent an ‚Äúarchipelago of towns\\" in which urban centers in Europe (Bruges, Ghent, Genoa and Venice), the Middle East (Cairo, Aden, and Hormuz), and Asia (Samarkand, Calicut, Kanchipuram, Malacca, Quanzhou and Hangzhou) were connected to one another by trade and shared in a common culture of commerce.‚Äù Strong empires like China and several European states were also using the merchants to create trading diasporas in order to gather information about a certain country and possibly exploit it either in the event of conflict or just for sociable reasons. Long distance trade at this time mainly ‚Äúdealt largely if not exclusively with luxury goods or high value relative to their bulk.‚ÄùBentley, Jerry H. \\"Cross Cultural interaction and Periodization in World History.\\" The American Historical Review 101, no. 3 (1996): 752. Therefore, protection of trading diasporas in the countries where diasporas settled was important as it guaranteed supply of luxury products into the country. Jewish diaspora The Jewish diaspora in India in an area called Goa is considered one of the oldest and strongest of the Early Modern World diasporas. The migration of Jews to India can be marked by the discovery of the route to India through the South African coast by the Portuguese.Fischel, Walter J. \\"Leading Jews in the Service of Portuguese India.\\" The Jewish quarterly review 47, no. 1 (1956): 37 As Walter Fischel, the author of Leading Jews in the service of Portuguese India notes ‚ÄúAlready in 1498 there appeared in the vicinity of Goa on the island of Anjediva the first Western Jew to play a role in the Portuguese Indian history.‚ÄùFischel , 38 Prior to the diamond trade, Jews in Portugal were employed as letter carriers, translators and agents. As the Portuguese expansion in India continued, Jews were able to create their own communities and practice their religious traditions. As Dutch traveler J. Van Linschoten noted ‚ÄúThere are great numbers of Moores and Jews in all places of India as at Goa, Cochin and within the land‚Ä¶ amongst the Indians they have their Synagogues‚Ä¶ wherein they use all ceremonies according to their law.‚ÄùFischel , 39 Linschoten‚Äôs statement clearly explains that Spanish Muslims‚ÄìMoors and Jews were able to practice their religions in India. This meant that they were able to create communities within the Indian peninsula and preserve their culture and religion. Such cases strongly suggest that rather than living like Indians, Jews created diasporas which helped them preserve their identity. Jews in India were able to trade and practice their religion unlike in Europe, where they were oppressed and killed. This meant that ‚Äúa Jew could rise to power and prominence in public life and could become an agent and diplomat in the service of the Portuguese viceroy in Goa.‚ÄùFischel , 40 As Fischel states Jews were also used by the Portuguese to negotiate with the Muslim rulers of India. This was due to the ‚Äúskill, knowledge and linguistic abilities of non- Christians.‚ÄùFischel , 43 Surat Surat was a city in Gujarat which at the time of the Portuguese conquest on the northern shores of India became one of the most important trading centers of Asia. Jewish diaspora was closely related to Surat as Jewish merchants plied their commerce through Surat. They, for the most part were jewelers and diamond merchants.Fischel, 47 ‚ÄúThey came from many parts of the world, from Constantinople, Safed, Baghdad and Portugal, Italy and England, as well as from Yemen, Persia and Jewish colony at Cochin‚Äìall attracted by the great economic potential and possibilities of Surat.‚Äù Therefore, Surat can be considered to be one of the largest centers of Jewish trading and diaspora. Significance Trading diasporas were important in a way that they were crucial in a process of establishing long-distance trade, ‚Äútransfers of technology, imperial and colonial ventures, missionary campaigns, the transatlantic slave trade, and the development of global capitalism.\\"Bentley, p.752 Therefore, trading diasporas were not always a positive community as it led to the establishment of the slave trade and colonialism. However, the interaction between the different nations and long distance trade which was made possible by the existence of trading diasporas was an important vanguard as it led to the development of global markets. In addition to the development of global markets trading diasporas also triggered an exchange of cultures, ideas and technology between the host country and the merchant.

With more than 35 subsidiaries worldwide, Sonoton licences the use of its music for TV, motion picture, advertising and internet productions. History 1965 Rotheide and Gerhard Narholz establish Sonoton as a company in Munich, Germany. Gerhard Narholz, songwriter for artists such as Petula Clark, Bill Ramsey and Heidi Br√ºhl, and composer for German feature films and television series, provides specific film and television music as background music, thus introducing library music in Germany. 1965 - 1970 Sonoton continues to develop the library business in Germany. The initial TV-specific music catalogue is expanded into a variety of genres through works of other composers. 1969 Sonoton enters the international market through the British BERRY MUSIC company, who sub- publishes Sonoton productions worldwide on the library music labels CONROY, STUDIO ONE and PROGRAMME PRODUCTIONS. Sonoton enters the commercial record market, producing Easy Listening Music for Japan, which is released on Polydor Records and King Records, Tokyo. 1970 - 1980 Using the a.k.a. Norman Candler, Gerhard Narholz composes, arranges and conducts over 20 LPs with his large string orchestra, the MAGIC STRINGS, internationally released on the labels Decca Records/ Telefunken and King Records. In 1971, Norman Candler receives the ‚Äú3 Star Award‚Äù from BBC London for ‚ÄúBest Album of the Year‚Äù. Sonoton expands its Easy Listening catalogue with recording artists Nelson Riddle, Billy May, Ted Heath, Acker Bilk, Xavier Cugat, Horst Jankowski and Franck Pourcel. 1973 EMI buys BERRY MUSIC, the former Sonoton agent in the UK. This marks the birth of Sonoton's own record label. The unicolored album covers for library music LPs are replaced with individually designed, full color sleeves. 1975 Sonoton introduces the British KPM label to the German market. More international labels follow. 1981 Sonoton establishes its world music label SAS (Sonoton AUTHENTIC SERIES). 1984 Sonoton is the first library to release its music on CD. 1987 Sonoton establishes the CNS label (COMMERCIALS NON STOP), featuring specific commercial and promo tracks. 1991 Sonoton represents SONIA Classics, a collection of classical works on CD, for synchronization. 1992 Sonoton is the first music library to present its own music search programme, SONOfind, on floppy disk. 1993 Sonoton is represented by ASSOCIATED PRODUCTION MUSIC (APM) in USA. 1995 Sonoton begins operating its own music recording studio in Munich, Germany. 1997 Sonoton creates its own sound effects series, SONOspheres, which focuses on atmospheric sounds and effects. 1998 Sonoton introduces an online music search programme and makes its entire repertoire accessible via the Internet. 2001 Sonoton opens a new digital 5.1 music recording studio in Munich and presents library DVDs with 5.1 mixes of large orchestral recordings. 2006 Sonoton offers its entire repertoire on hard drive including an offline search system. 2010 Sonoton is the first European production music library to release its SONOfind music searchSONOfind - MusicSearch program as an app for iOS and Android based mobile devices. Business model Based on contracts with composers and recording artists, Sonoton owns the Synchronization and Performing Rights of its compositions and recordings, and licenses these rights to the audio-visual industry on a track- by-track or project-by-project basis. In countries where a Mechanical Copyright Society is in function (such as MCPS (Mechanical-Copyright Protection Society) in UK or GEMA in Germany), Synchronization Rights (the right to combine music with audio-visuals or/and advertising) are licensed through these societies. In all other countries (such as US) synchronization licenses have to be obtained from the local Sonoton representative. Performing Rights (the right to perform music publicly, live or in any media, such as TV, film, etc...) are granted through local performing right societies, which usually have blanket agreements with broadcasters. Composers get their shares of licenses either through membership of a Mechanical and/or Performing Rights Societies, and/or through Sonoton, depending on the local legal conditions.

Loomis sends ruthless killer Armor O'Malley (Denis Leary) to find the boat and recover the money‚Äîhe and sidekick Marie (Brenda Bakke) kill Carlos before they can get the name and location of the boat, but they learn that Carlos's brother Dani (Christopher Lambert) knows where it is, and set out to find him. Dani is sprung from a South American prison by Cole Parker (Mario Van Peebles), a bounty hunter working for the DEA who is bent on taking down Loomis‚ÄîCole knows the name of the boat, Dani knows the location, and both men want the money for their own reasons. Complicating matters is a mole in the DEA who feeds intel to O'Malley about the heroes' movements. Alone and outnumbered, Cole and Dani are forced into a reluctant alliance as they quest for the 400 million dollar boat, with O'Malley and his men chasing them every step of the way. Loomis quickly realizes that O'Malley wants the fortune for himself and tries to have him and his men assassinated, but the attempt fails. O'Malley returns to Loomis's estate and makes it clear that he now wears the pants in their relationship: without the $400 million, Loomis can't pay his soldiers, and O'Malley will get his hands on the money before the stay-at-home cripple does. Loomis is killed and O'Malley renews the chase with a small army at his disposal. After numerous betrayals on both sides of the conflict, the chase ends at a Puerto Vallarta harbor, and a yacht called the \\"Matador\\" according to Cole. Dani and Cole shoot it out with O'Malley's soldiers and leave the boat a flaming wreck (and Dani beside himself at the loss of the money). But Cole reveals he lied about the boat name to mislead and eliminate O'Malley: the fortune was actually stashed on a rickety old fishing boat called the \\"Gunmen.\\" The heroes agree to split the money and sail into the sunset.

Today the MCA continues to publish the Gazette alongside Leatherneck Magazine. The headquarters of the Gazette is in Quantico, Virginia. Originally published quarterly from 1916 through 1942, the Gazette transitioned to a bi-monthly cycle in 1943 and then monthly in 1944. Active duty Marines staffed the journal until a change of law in 1976 prompted the Gazette to rely on retired Marines and civilians for publication. Since November 2006, the entire Gazette is available online to members.  Mission and Focus  The Gazette's mission is to provide a forum for the exchange of ideas that will advance knowledge, interest, and esprit in the Marine Corps. The Gazette is also a vehicle for the dissemination of military art and science among Marines. The focus of the journal is to invite debate from readers on the important issues facing the Marine Corps today. The Gazette is of, by, and for Marines and uses a combination of solicitation for articles, writing contests, and unsolicited manuscripts. The journal occasionally reprints articles from other professional journals.  Notable editors  * Oliver P.

The German colonial rule was marked by tensions and led to the genocide of the Herero and Namaqua people from 1904 to 1907, resulting in the deaths of 65,000 Herero (80 percent of the total Herero population), and 10,000 Nama (50% of the total Nama population). The colony was ruled by Germany until 1915 when it was conquered by troops from the Union of South Africa. =World War I until Namibian independence= During South African rule, German was one of the three official languages of Namibia, the other being English and Dutch, the latter replaced by Afrikaans in 1925. =Since Namibian independence= Namibian independence in 1990 coincided with German reunification, resulting in an initially slow development of diplomatic relations. However, in both 1989 and 2004 the German government acknowledged its responsibility for Namibia as a priority partner country. In 2004 German Development minister Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul visited Namibia, asking the country for forgiveness of the past.http://www.dw- world.de/dw/article/0,1564,1298060,00.html In her speech at the 100th anniversary of the Herero war in Okakarara she was the first German government official to officially apologise, and to call the incident a \\"V√∂lkermord\\" (genocide), a word that was previously carefully avoided in order not to invite reparation claims. , not least due to substantially improved co- operation and exchange, as well as by fate of the permanent presence of the \\"German tribe in Namibia\\", the two countries have mostly learnt to a new dialogue, which at times also still stagnates.

Family Salmon's father, Alexander Salmon (Solomon, 1822‚Äì1866), was an English Jewish merchant. While secretary to P≈çmare IV of Tahiti, he fell in love with her twenty-year-old adoptive sister Oehau. For three days the queen suspended the law forbidding a Tahitian to marry a foreigner, gave Princess Oehau the title ari'i Taimai, and they married. Their daughter, Salmon's sister, Johanna Marau Ta'aroa (1846‚Äì1934), married her uncle, the future King P≈çmare V, and was de facto ruler as Queen Marau (1877‚Äì1880) until he abdicated to the French colonial government. Another daughter married the Scottish merchant John Brander. Alexander Ari ªipaea Salmon was their son, Alexander Jr., known as \\"Pa'ea\\" (Mangarevan for 'hobble'). He inherited his father's business interests and became co- owner with Brander of the Maison Brander copra and coconut oil plantations in Tahiti, the Marquesas, and the Cook Islands. Easter Island The Maison Brander owned a large sheep ranch on Easter Island for exporting wool. The ranch was managed by the power-hungry convicted murderer Jean-Baptiste Dutrou- Bornier, who had acquired additional land and appointed his Rapanui wife \\"Queen\\". This was the low point in the island's history; by 1872 its resident population had been reduced to 111. In 1871 Alexander Jr had picked up rudimentary Rapanui from his hundreds of indentured Easter Island labourers at the Mahina coconut plantation on Tahiti. In 1877 Queen P≈çmare IV died, and Alexander's sister became regent. John Brander also died that year, and Dutrou-Bornier was assassinated. Alexander set off for Easter Island to manage the sheep station in around October 1878 with twenty Tahitian workers and an unknown number of Rapanui whose indentures had expired and ran the island for a decade. He introduced the coconut, the first sizeable tree on the island since its deforestation two centuries earlier, apart from some fruit trees at the SSCC Catholic mission and Dutrou-Bornier's estate. Salmon returned to Tahiti in 1883‚Äì1884 for business. Upon his return to Easter Island he bought up all remaining land apart from the SSCC mission at Hanga Roa. As owner of nearly all the island and sole source of employment, Salmon was de facto ruler. As he was not a religious man, and a Jew, the priests did not like him, especially Hippolyte Roussel, who had been forced to leave the island in 1871 due to conflict with Dutrou-Bornier but who visited again in 1879. Bishop Jaussen in Tahiti appointed a Rapanui, Atamu te Kena, \\"king\\" to protect church interests from the Maison Brander, but Salmon ignored him and he never had any influence. However, Salmon was an honest man and sincerely interested in the welfare of the people, and the population started to recover. This was the era of the strong Tahitian influence on the Rapanui language and culture. In addition to wool exports, Salmon developed a tourist industry. He encouraged the manufacture of Rapanui artworks, including imitation rongorongo inscriptions, and helped sell them to passing ships for good prices as cultural artefacts, though he never claimed they were genuine. The artisans knew currency exchange rates and could deal with Europeans and Americans on their own terms. Salmon served as the principal informant for the British and German archaeological expeditions to the island in 1882 and for the Americans in 1886, as guide, translator, and hotelier. Cooke, surgeon of the USS Mohican, which dropped anchor in December 1886, said,Fischer pp 131‚Äì132 The information Salmon provided, despite its often poor quality, is still among the most important of Easter Island's early historical period. He also sent three genuine rongorongo tablets to his niece's husband, Heinrich August Schlubach, the German consul of Valpara√≠so, which are now kept in Vienna and Berlin. Prince K≈´hi≈ç in 1907 Salmon sold the Brander Easter Island holdings to the Chilean government on 2 January 1888 and signed as a witness to the cession of the island. He returned to Tahiti in December of that year. He left for the remote Tuamotu Islands after being arrested and put in prison for assault and battery. He collected the oral histories of the people of the Tuamotus. He moved to San Francisco in later life and was involved in a scheme to marry ex-Queen Liliuokalani of Hawaii, who he claimed he had been engaged to from birth. The plot was merely a heist to take Liliuokalani's money to pay his debt. He died in 1914.Tandfonline  Ancestry  Family tree References *Fischer, Stephen. 2005.

The evolutionary factors that produced these changes have been the subject of several theories. Energy efficiency Human walking is about 75% less costly than both quadrupedal and bipedal walking in chimpanzees. Some hypotheses have supported that bipedalism increased the energetic efficiency of travel and that this was an important factor in the origin of bipedal locomotion. Humans save more energy than quadrupeds when walking but not when running. Human running is 75% less efficient than walking. A study helped to prove that walking of living hominin bipeds is noticeably more efficient than walking of living hominin quadrupeds, but the costs of quadruped and bipedal travel are the same. Foot Human feet evolved enlarged heels to bear the weight that evolution also increased. The human foot evolved as a platform to support the entire weight of the body, rather than acting as a grasping structure, as it did in early hominids. Humans therefore have smaller toes than their bipedal ancestors. This includes a non-opposable hallux, which is relocated in line with the other toes. Moreover, humans have a foot arch rather than flat feet. When non-human hominids walk upright, weight is transmitted from the heel, along the outside of the foot, and then through the middle toes while a human foot transmits weight from the heel, along the outside of the foot, across the ball of the foot and finally through the big toe. This transference of weight contributes to energy conservation during locomotion. Knee Human knee joints are enlarged for the same reason as the hip ‚Äì to better support an increased amount of body weight. The degree of knee extension (the angle between the thigh and shank in a walking cycle) has decreased. The changing pattern of the knee joint angle of humans shows a small extension peak, called the ‚Äúdouble knee action,‚Äù in the midstance phase. Double knee action decreases energy lost by vertical movement of the center of gravity. Humans walk with their knees kept straight and the thighs bent inward so that the knees are almost directly under the body, rather than out to the side, as is the case in ancestral hominids. This type of gait also aids balance. Limbs An increase in leg length since the evolution of bipedalism changed how leg muscles functioned in upright gait. In humans the \\"push\\" for walking comes from the leg muscles acting at the ankle. A longer leg allows the use of the natural swing of the limb so that, when walking, humans do not need to use muscle to swing the other leg forward for the next step. As a consequence, since the human forelimbs are not needed for locomotion, they are instead optimized for carrying, holding, and manipulating objects with great precision. This results in decreased strength in the forelimbs relative to body size for humans compared to apes. Having long hindlimbs and short forelimbs allows humans to walk upright, while orangutans and gibbons had the adaptation of longer arms to swing on branches. Apes can stand on their hindlimbs, but they cannot do so for long periods of time without getting tired. This is because their femurs are not adapted for bipedalism. Apes have vertical femurs, while humans have femurs that are slightly angled medially from the hip to the knee, thus making human knees closer together and under the body‚Äôs center of gravity. This adaptation lets humans lock their knees and stand up straight for long periods of time without much effort from muscles.Saladin, Kenneth S. \\"Chapter 8.\\" Anatomy & Physiology: the Unity of Form and Function. 5th ed. Dubuque: McGraw- Hill, 2010. 281. Print. The gluteus maximum became a major role in walking and is one of the largest muscles in humans. This muscle is much smaller in chimps, which shows that it has an important role in bipedalism. When humans run, our upright posture tends to flex forward as each foot strikes the ground creating momentum forward. The gluteus muscle helps to prevent the upper trunk of the body from \\"pitching forward\\" or falling over. Hip and pelvis Modern human hip joints are larger than in quadrupedal ancestral species to better support the greater amount of body weight passing through them, as well as having a shorter, broader shape. This alteration in shape brought the vertebral column closer to the hip joint, providing a stable base for support of the trunk while walking upright. Also, because bipedal walking requires humans to balance on a relatively unstable ball and socket joint, the placement of the vertebral column closer to the hip joint allows humans to invest less muscular effort in balancing. Change in the shape of the hip may have led to the decrease in the degree of hip extension, an energy efficient adaptation. The ilium changed from a long and narrow shape to a short and broad one and the walls of the pelvis modernized to face laterally. These combined changes provide increased area for the gluteus muscles to attach; this helps to stabilize the torso while standing on one leg. The sacrum has also become more broad, increasing the diameter of the birth canal and making birthing easier. To increase surface for ligament attachment to help support the abdominal viscera during erect posture, the Ischia spines became more prominent and shifted towards the middle of the body. Vertebral column The vertebral column of humans takes a forward bend in the lumbar (lower) region and a backward bend in the thoracic (upper) region. Without the lumbar curve, the vertebral column would always lean forward, a position that requires much more muscular effort for bipedal animals. With a forward bend, humans use less muscular effort to stand and walk upright. Together the lumbar and thoracic curves bring the body's center of gravity directly over the feet. Also, the degree of body erection (the angle of body incline to a vertical line in a walking cycle) is significantly smaller to conserve energy.  Skull  The human skull is balanced on the vertebral column: The foramen magnum is located inferiorly under the skull, which puts much of the weight of the head behind the spine. Furthermore, the flat human face helps to maintain balance on the occipital condyles. Because of this, the erect position of the head is possible without the prominent supraorbital ridges and the strong muscular attachments found in, for example, apes. As a result, in humans the muscles of the forehead (the occipitofrontalis) are only used for facial expressions. Increasing brain size has also been significant in human evolution. It began to increase around 2.4 million years ago but modern levels of brain size were not attained until after 500,000 years ago. Zoological analyses have shown that the size of human brains is significantly larger than what you would expect for their size. The human brain is in fact three to four times larger than its closest relative - the chimpanzee.  Significance  Even with much modification, some features of the human skeleton remain poorly adapted to bipedalism, leading to negative implications prevalent in humans today. The lower back and knee joints are plagued by osteological malfunction, lower back pain being a leading cause of lost working days, because the joints support more weight. Arthritis has been a problem since hominids became bipedal: scientists have discovered its traces in the vertebrae of prehistoric hunter- gatherers. Physical constraints have made it difficult to modify the joints for further stability while maintaining efficiency of locomotion.

Aural rehab includes specific procedures in which each therapy and amplification device has as its goal the habilitation or rehabilitation of persons to overcome the handicap (disability) caused by a hearing impairment or deafness. Aural rehabilitation is frequently used as an integral component in the overall management of individuals with hearing loss and refers to services and procedures for facilitating adequate receptive and expressive communication in individuals with hearing differences. Aural rehabilitation is often an interdisciplinary endeavor involving physicians, audiologists and speech-language pathologists.Treatment & Rehabilitation  Scope of practice  Audiologists and speech-language pathologists are professionals who typically provide aural rehabilitation components. The audiologist may be responsible for the fitting, dispensing and management of a hearing device, counseling the client about his or her hearing loss, the application of certain processes to enhance communication, and the skills training regarding environmental modifications which will facilitate the development of receptive and expressive communication.http://www.asha.org/public/hearing/treatment/adult The speech- language pathologist is typically responsible for evaluating the client‚Äôs receptive and expressive communication skills and providing the services to anchor improvement. The speech-language pathologist also provides training and treatment for communication strategies, speech-perception training (e.g., speechreading, auditory training and auditory-visual-speech-perception training), speech and voice production, and comprehension of oral, written, and sign language.  History  In the United States, adult aural rehab started as a result of the number of soldiers who incurred hearing loss in World War II and were in need of services. Back then, audiologists and speech- language pathologists would put emphasis on speech reading (lip-reading) auditory training, and would fit the soldiers with very primitive hearing aids. In the past, the main components of the rehab process were training clients in lip-reading techniques and listening exercises. Today, the list includes a thorough hearing evaluation, intervention with hearing instruments, and counseling for the client before and after the hearing device is selected.  Types of aural rehabilitation therapies  Hearing Aid *Hearing aid orientation: The process of providing education and therapies to persons (individual or group) and their families about the use and expectations of wearing hearing aids to improve communication. *Listening strategies: The process of teaching hard of hearing persons common and alternative strategies when listening with or without amplification to improve their communication.Nicolosi 2003. *Speechreading: The process of using or teaching the understanding communication using visual cues observed from the speaker‚Äôs mouth, facial expressions, and hand movements. *Auditory Training: The process of teaching an individual with a hearing loss the ability to recognize speech sounds, patterns, words, phrases, or sentences via audition. *Unisensory: Therapy philosophy that centers on extreme development of a single sense for improving communication. *Cued speech: The process of using and teaching manual hand or facial movements used to supplement an auditory-verbal approach to the development of communication competence. *Total communication: The process of using and teaching speech, language, and communication skills simultaneously using manual communication, speech, and hearing. *Manual communication: The process of using and teaching communication via finger- spelling and with a sign language.  General steps included in the aural rehab of a child (infant, toddler, child)  Infant wearing hearing aid #Identification of Hearing loss #Audiological evaluation #Hearing aid and or assistive listening device evaluation and use #Parental guidance to select appropriate therapy program #Early intervention program #Communication skill development (auditory, speech/language, sign) #Literacy development (cognition, writing, reading)Winter 1999, p. 1051 Regardless of treatment method for an infant, toddler, or child, the following problems have to be considered: #Perceptual problems #Communication problems (aural, oral, manual) #Literacy problems (cognitive, memory, dexterity) #Social, emotional, psychological problems #Education and vocational placement problems #Family and societal problemsAlpiner 1993.  General steps included in an aural rehab program for an adult  Adult programs differ from child programs because adults typically have a later onset of significant hearing loss; they have acquired a worldly knowledge, and have experienced normal speech/language development. Consequently, treatment and therapy strategies are much different compared with a child. #Assessment and impact of hearing loss #Assessment for the use of hearing aids and or assistive listening devices #Assessment of listening strategies and speech reading skills #Developing a treatment program including the family #Delivery of the treatment program #Outcome measures Treatment strategies for adults center on: *Hearing aid and or assistive listening device evaluation and orientation *Providing therapy to maintain speech and language *Providing therapy to increase listening strategies and speech reading *Counseling to facilitate adjustment to hearing aid and or assistive listening device and possible psychological, emotional, and occupation impacts of hearing loss Regardless of whether the aural rehab program is designed for a child or an adult, the members of the hearing care team are the same. The principal members are the audiologist, speech-language pathologist, otologist, and the family physician. Additional members of the hearing care team can include any of the following: educators of the child who is hard of hearing, has mental health counselors, school psychologists, sensory device manufacturers and distributors, social workers, telecommunication and captioning service providers , and vocational counselors .

Electric vs. electro-acoustic A solid-body electric ukulele produces very little sound acoustically, requiring an amplifier to be heard from more than a few feet away. Some solid-body electric ukuleles have steel strings and active humbucker style or single-coil magnetic pickups, such as the Blue Star Konablaster, Mahalo MEU1/S, RISA, Monkey Wrench, Mark Vinsel, Stagg, and Vorson electric ukuleles, while other electric ukuleles, such as Eleuke ukuleles, are solid-body electric ukuleles with nylon strings and passive pick-ups under the saddle. An electro-acoustic ukulele is a standard acoustic instrument to which a passive pickup has been added, a method similar to that used for an acoustic-electric guitar. Such ukuleles have nylon or gut strings, not the metal strings necessary for ukuleles with magnetic pickups. Electro- acoustic ukuleles may be played either unplugged or plugged into an amplifier. Such nylon-strung ukuleles include those designed to look like metal-strung electric guitars, such as the Epiphone Les Paul-style acoustic-electric ukulele. The acoustic and electric tone qualities will often differ between electric ukuleles, and some \\"a/e\\" ukuleles are built with the aim of producing quality sound when amplified, to the detriment of the acoustic sound. Electric ukuleles come in the same four standard sizes as acoustic ukuleles.

Vinzant Software develops and markets enterprise job scheduling solutions for most platforms including Windows, Unix, Linux, AS400 and MPE/ix. It was founded in 1988 by David Vinzant and has solely focused on job scheduling since 1995.  History  Vinzant, Inc. was started in 1987 by Dave Vinzant. Initially, it developed add-on programs to a property management software package called SKYLINE, which Vinzant had been involved in developing. As client‚Äìserver computing was first getting started in 1988, Vinzant, Inc. worked with Microsoft and Novell. Vinzant developed SQLFile, the first shipping front end for the Ashton-Tate/Microsoft SQL Server in 1989.Vinzant Ships Front End for SQL Server,\\" PC Week, June 12, 1989. SQLFile was expanded to include support for DOS, OS/2 and Windows. It was a flexible development tool that created screens and reports that accessed data stored in Microsoft SQL Server, NetWare SQL and Oracle Server.Vinzant, David R.: \\"Running SQL Server on NetWare\\", LAN Times, Aug. 7, 1989. In 1990, Novell announced the NetWare Loadable Module(NLM) version of NetWare SQL and the SQLFile System for DOS was shipped to thousands of users worldwide as part of Novell's 'Client Server Starter Kit'.SQLFILE Software License Agreement between Novell, Inc. and Vinzant, Inc., Dec. 26, 1990 Due to their experience with Oracle and NetWare, Vinzant, Inc. was selected by Oracle to develop the installation program for the Oracle Server for NetWare.Software Magazine, Sept., 1994 Other SQL-based products developed by Vinzant, Inc. include the SQL BASIC Library which allowed compiled BASIC to be used with Microsoft SQL Server and the SQL Server Connectivity Pack which allowed SQL Server to be run on Novell networks. Due to its involvement with companies that were beginning to downsize their operations to PC's, Vinzant, Inc. recognized the need for a mission-critical job scheduling product. With their development of the Event Control Server (ECS) in the early 1990s, Vinzant shifted its focus to the emerging job scheduling and batch processing market. At that time a variety of simple PC utility products were on the market, but the 'downsizers' were looking for a product that could manage mission-critical applications. ECS was developed to provide solutions to some of the problems with other products, such as providing a central point of control for a network of DOS, OS/2, and Windows-based PC's. In 1999, ECS was re-designed to provide support for Unix and Linux systems. The result was the Global Event Control Server (Global ECS or GECS)due to its IP-based architecture and ability to control computers and processes worldwide. Solutions *Business Process Automation *Job Scheduling *Batch Scheduling  Products  =Global ECS= Global ECS is the main product offering from Vinzant Software. It is an event-driven enterprise level job scheduling solution. It supports native Agents for other platforms including Unix, Linux, AS400 and MPE/ix that can all be managed from a single point using either a Windows or browser-based client. In addition to traditional time-based job scheduling, it supports triggers such as the existence of a file or completion of another job(s)or batch. Global ECS includes user-definable recovery actions that allow for built in job logic to allow the production flow to self-correct. It also includes flexible exception management that allows for multiple methods of notification. Implementations Job scheduling and batch processing are tools to help manage data processing systems by automating operations, improving quality, reducing costs, and improving resource utilization. Typical uses are scheduling file transfers, database updates, report generation, compilations and backups. Global ECS is particularly used by businesses whose core product is their information or data, such as financial institutions (banking, insurance, securities, brokerage, retirement and credit cards), government agencies, and information resources.

Social background Paraguay highlighted on the map Paraguay is a landlocked country in South America, bordered by Argentina to the south and southwest, Brazil to the east and northeast, and Bolivia to the northwest. The vast majority of its population identifies as Roman Catholic, and religion in Paraguay plays a very important role. Paraguay is a socially conservative society;https://www.gov.uk/foreign- travel-advice/paraguay/local-laws-and-customs http://www.everyculture.com/No- Sa/Paraguay.html and has been slow to change traditional views on family: divorce was legalized only in 1991.Sex and the State: Abortion, Divorce, and the Family Under Latin. American Dictatorships and Democracies, by Mala Htun, pp 102 Extent of domestic violence It is very difficult to assess the extent of domestic violence. Most cases are not reported to authorities, and victims endure the violence privately. In a 2008 survey, 20.4% of the women interviewed in the survey (aged 15-49) said they suffered physical or sexual violence by a current or former partner. This was lower than many other countries in the area, but these figures, being self-reported, may reflect differing personal understanding of what constitutes abuse. Of women who said they experienced domestic abuse in the past 12 months, 12.9% said they sought any institutional help for the abuse. In 2017, 770 instances of domestic violence against men by their partners were recorded (1,540 annualised). Legislative response The legal response of Paraguay to domestic violence has been very weak, even by Latin American standards. Although Paraguay enacted in 2000 Law No. 1,600 Against Domestic Violence (Ley No 1.600 contra la Violencia Dom√©stica), this law - while having a broad definition of domestic violence (including physical, psychological and sexual abuse \\"lesiones, maltratos f√≠sicos, ps√≠quicos o sexuales\\" http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/population/domesticviolence/paraguay.dv.00.htm) - is civil in nature, and as such does not provide for any sanctions against the perpetrators. While the Criminal Code provides for a crime of domestic violence, this crime has a very narrow definition, as physical violence that is carried out habitually, and is punishable by a fine only. http://www.refworld.org/docid/42df61652.htmlhttp://www.eurasiareview.com/07072011-paraguay- makes-step-forward-for-women%E2%80%99s-and-indigenous-rights-analysis/ As of 2014, there have been increasing calls, from both inside and outside of the country, for the enactment of a comprehensive law against violence against women.http://www.pj.gov.py/contenido/136-secretaria-de- genero/609http://noticias.lainformacion.com/politica/derechos- humanos/paraguay-requiere-ley-contra-violencia-de-genero-dice-representante- de-onu_StZtbOZvhADLnLJA5rcFN6/http://www.hoy.com.py/nacionales/a-paraguay-le- urge-una-ley-contra-violencia-de- generohttp://www.paraguay.com/nacionales/reclaman-ley-integral-contra-la- violencia-hacia-las-mujeres-99037http://www.abc.com.py/especiales/fin-de- semana/un-salto-legal-contra-la-violencia-hacia-las-mujeres-1303660.html  See also  * Crime in Paraguay * Women in Paraguay References Category:Violence in Paraguay Paraguay Category:Crimes against women ","title":"Domestic violence in Paraguay"},{"id":"16732126","text":"In sports and particularly exercise testing, the rating of perceived exertion (RPE), as measured by the Borg rating of perceived exertion scale (RPE scale), is a frequently used quantitative measure of perceived exertion during physical activity.

The original scale introduced by Gunnar Borg rated exertion on a scale of 6-20. Borg then constructed a category (C) ratio (R) scale, the Borg CR10 scale, rated on a scale from 1-10. This is especially used in clinical diagnosis of breathlessness and dyspnea, chest pain, angina and musculo-skeletal pain. The CR-10 scale is best suited when there is an overriding sensation arising either from a specific area of the body, for example, muscle pain, ache or fatigue in the quadriceps or from pulmonary responses. The Borg scale can be compared to other linear scales such as the Likert scale or a visual analogue scale. The sensitivity and reproducibility of the results are broadly very similar, although the Borg may outperform the Likert scale in some cases.

The MƒÅori presence in Australia dates back to the 19th century when MƒÅori traveled to Sydney to trade, acquire new technology, and learn new ideas. The MƒÅori population in Australia remained marginal until the 1960s. During the second half of the 20th and early 21st centuries, thousands of MƒÅori would emigrate from New Zealand to pursue employment opportunities in blue collar occupations such as shearing, construction, manufacturing, and mining. In 2013, there were approximately 140,000‚Äì170,000 people with MƒÅori ancestry living in Australia. MƒÅori Australians constitute Australia's largest Polynesian ethnic group.  History  People with Maori ancestry as a percentage of the population in Australia divided geographically by statistical local area, as of the 2011 census =19th century= There was no known prehistoric contact between Australian Aboriginal people and New Zealand MƒÅori, although the Polynesian ancestors of MƒÅori were accomplished navigators, who did establish short-lived settlements on Norfolk Island. The first MƒÅori known to have visited Australia travelled to Sydney (then known as Port Jackson, or PoihƒÅkena in te reo MƒÅori) in 1793. Ngahuruhuru and Tuki Tahua from the Bay of Islands were taken against their will by Governor Philip Gidley King to Norfolk Island, in an attempt to teach flax-weaving to the convicts there, and then to Port Jackson. They remained as guests of Governor King before returning to the Bay of Islands. MƒÅori chiefs continued to trade with Europeans in Australia, bringing back rare goods to New Zealand. An 1823 image of Sydney depicts the presence of MƒÅori. There were at least 700 MƒÅori visitors to Sydney prior to 1840, with some of the more notable being the chiefs Te Pahi, Ruatara, Hongi Hika, Taonui, Patuone, Rewa and Te Wharerahi. These visiting MƒÅori participated in commercial trade and were employed on the many vessels visiting or based in Sydney, particularly whaling vessels. Many MƒÅori lived in the Rocks area around the Whaler's Arms tavern, reflected in the streetname \\"Maori Lane\\". =20th century= Avoiding the White Australia Policy, 1902-1950s MƒÅori generally benefited from the same immigration and voting rights as white New Zealanders in Australia, making them a notable exception to the White Australia policy. In 1902, with the Commonwealth Franchise Act, MƒÅori residents in Australia were granted the right to vote, a right denied to Indigenous Australians. During that same period, their right to settle in Australia was facilitated by their shared status as British subjects. The Australian government granted equal rights to MƒÅori only reluctantly. In 1905, the New Zealand government made a formal complaint about the exclusion of two MƒÅori shearers, after which the Australian government changed its customs regulations to allow MƒÅori to freely enter the country. Other Pacific Islanders were still subject to the White Australia policy. In 1948, Australian immigration minister Arthur Calwell ordered the deportation of three Tongan women, the wife and daughters of an Australian man. He was subsequently questioned in parliament whether the same standard would apply to MƒÅori, and stated \\"within the meaning of the Immigration Act, they [MƒÅori and Tongans] are regarded as the same people, and under existing law and practice, such people will not be permitted to settle permanently in Australia\\". Calwell's comments caused an international incident and \\"triggered outrage in New Zealand\\". The country's prime minister Peter Fraser stated that \\"any hint of discrimination, against our Maori fellow citizens would be indignantly and bitterly resented as an unforgivable insult to our country and every one of us\\". Calwell subsequently reversed his previous statement and allowed MƒÅori to continue entering Australia on the same terms as white New Zealanders. MƒÅori migration wave, 1960s-1990s Some of the MƒÅori who travelled to Australia from the 1840s onwards remained in Australia. From the 1960s, thousands of MƒÅori migrated to Australia seeking new life and work opportunities in Sydney, which ushered in a wave of MƒÅori emigration to Australia during the second half of the 20th century. The author, film-maker, and historian Bradford Haami argues that MƒÅori emigration from New Zealand was motivated by economic opportunities overseas, particularly Australia, growing unemployment in New Zealand, and a desire to escape the perceived discriminatory attitudes of European New Zealanders in the work force. In the 1970s and 1980s, MƒÅori hit by a downturn in their home country's economy emigrated to Australia in search of work. Between 1984 and 1999, the closure of the freezing works and factory industries in New Zealand, where the majority of MƒÅori were employed, led many to emigrate to Australia. MƒÅori immigrants to Australia sought work in blue collar occupations such as construction, mining, seasonal work such as sheep shearing, security, truck driving, entertainment, and the horse-raising industry. In addition, MƒÅori migrants sought employment as correction officers and in the Australian Army. MƒÅori migrants in Australia developed a reputation as hard workers among employers. MƒÅori migrants also found work in the Australian sheep shearing industry. MƒÅori shearers preferred the wider 86-mm comb over the standard Australian regulation 64-mm comb since it increased the rate of production. The use of the 86-mm comb created friction between Australian and expatriate New Zealand shearers, leading to a ten-week strike organized by the Australian Workers' Union in 1983. The dispute was resolved with the allowance of wider combs for increased productivity. As of 2018, MƒÅori are still well represented in the shearing industry. In 1998, a survey of 1,149 New Zealand-born Maori in Australia conducted by Te Puni K≈çkiri, the Department for MƒÅori Development, found that motivations for emigrating to Australia included better employment opportunities, family reunification, starting a new life, seeking better weather, education, and sports, and to escape MƒÅori politics or negative experiences in New Zealand. In addition, some MƒÅori men came to Australia to play rugby while others migrated to avoid having to pay child support to their families. Other MƒÅori emigrated to Australia to escape abusive relationships and domestic violence in their families. =21st century= In 2001, the Australian Government tightened immigration regulations. While New Zealanders arriving in Australia have freedom to work through a non-protected Special Category Visa, they are unable to access social security, tertiary student loans, and other economic opportunities unless they obtain permanent residence. These policy changes have affected MƒÅori in Australia. According to Haami, half of all New Zealand-born MƒÅori who arrived prior to 1971 are Australian citizens. In 2011, only 23.3% of MƒÅori who had lived in Australia for at least five years had attained Australian citizenship. This was a lower figure than other migrant ancestry groups with the exception of Japanese Australians. In 2011, it was also estimated that only 16.6% of MƒÅori living in Australia held Australian citizenship; significant lower than the 38% observed for non-MƒÅori New Zealanders in Australia. In December 2014, the Australian Government amended the Migration Act to facilitate the cancellation of visas for non-citizens who had served a prison sentence of more than 12 months and \\"character grounds.\\" This character test also targets non-citizens who have lived for most of their life in Australia or have roots there. Refusal or cancellation of visa on character grounds. As of July 2018, 1,300 had been deported from Australia. Of these, at least 60% were of MƒÅori and Pacific Islander descent. This has strained Australia‚ÄìNew Zealand relations; with Australian officials defending their \\"tough on crime\\" policy and New Zealand officials countering that it undermines the historic bonds of \\"mateship\\" and free movement between the two countries. According to a 2014 report published by the Bay of Plenty Regional Council, legislative restrictions on access to social security, student loans, and housing, an economic downturn in Australia, and perceived racism has led a growing number of Australian-based MƒÅori to return to New Zealand. In addition, pull factors for returning to New Zealand included trade work opportunities in Auckland and Christchurch, and better family and lifestyle options in New Zealand. While the majority of returnees have settled in main centers like Auckland, others have returned to provincial centers like the Bay of Plenty. In 2013, 14% of Australian MƒÅori returnees lived in Bay of Plenty compared to 8% of NZ European returnees from Australia. While the majority of European returnees were in the 30-39 age and 60 and over age brackets, the majority of MƒÅori returnees were families with children under the age of 14 years. In mid-August 2019, a MƒÅori group known as the NgƒÅti Rangihou Kanguru hap≈´ laid claim to 112 acres of land in Parramatta in Sydney, claiming that local Indigenous Australian leaders had entrusted the land to the MƒÅori King with the help of Anglican priest Samuel Marsden. The disputed land is in an eastern section of central Parramatta and takes in several parks and reserves. Earlier in March 2019, the MƒÅori group had occupied the land for several days before being evicted. The City of Parramatta Council has applied in court to have the claim dismissed. Demographics A 1933 census indicated there were 197 MƒÅori living in Australia. That number increased to 449 in 1961, 862 in 1966, 26,000 in 1986 and 84,000 in 2001. According to Haami, the number of MƒÅori emigrating to Australia rose from 290 in 1960 to 1,750 in 1967. By 1966, Australia was home to an estimated 4,000 MƒÅori. The number of New Zealand-born MƒÅori also rose from 1,379 in 1971 to 4,445 between 1976 and 1980. Between 1986 and 1990, this figure rose to 7,638. The 1986 Australian Census found that there were approximately 27,000 MƒÅori living in Australia. The 2001 Australian Census found that the MƒÅori population in New Zealand numbered 101,100. The 2001 Census also revealed that 35.5% of the Australian MƒÅori population lived in New South Wales, 29.7% in Queensland (including 19,000 in Brisbane), 14% in Victoria, and 6% in other territories. Of the 79,000 resident MƒÅori who identified their iwi/tribal affiliations, 20,000 were NgƒÅpuhi, 12,500 NgƒÅti Porou, 11,500 Waikato, 10,000 NgƒÅti Kahungunu, and 3,000 NgƒÅi Tahu. There were also around 30,000 to 45,000 NgƒÅpuhi residing in Sydney and the Gold Coast. There are significant MƒÅori communities in certain suburbs of Sydney (Penrith, Parramatta, Liverpool, Blacktown, Campbelltown) as well as Brisbane (Woodridge, Forest Lake, Wynnum, Redbank), Darwin, Melbourne and Perth. In 2001, there were 19,000 MƒÅori living in Brisbane. By 2013, a Dominion Post report estimated that there were more MƒÅori living in Queensland than in ten of New Zealand's sixteen regions. In 2007, the co-leader of New Zealand's MƒÅori Party, Pita Sharples, proposed the creation of an additional overseas seat in the New Zealand Parliament for MƒÅori living in Australia. The 2011 Australian Census found there were 128,420 MƒÅori living in Australia. Two- thirds of this population were born in New Zealand. Based on this census, it was estimated that as much as one-sixth of the MƒÅori population lived in Australia and that one in three MƒÅori in Australia were born there, with 80% of this generation being under the age of 25. Socioeconomics =Citizenship= According to the 2011 Australian Census, only 16.6% of New Zealand-born MƒÅori hold Australian citizenship. By contrast, the figure is 38% for New Zealand-born non-MƒÅori and 63.7% for other people not born in Australia. Half of New Zealand-born MƒÅori who arrived prior to 1971 are Australian citizens with the figure decreasing the more recently they arrived. The reduced citizenship rates among MƒÅori reflects legislative changes to Australia's immigration policy in 2001 including the establishment of a Special Category Visa for New Zealand citizens, which allows them to work but limits access to social security benefits. =Education= In 2011, only 45.2% of New Zealand-born MƒÅori between the ages of 25 and 54 years living in Australia had graduated high school with a Year 12 qualification. Only about 6% of NZ-born MƒÅori men held a bachelor degree, compared to the Australian national average of 26% for men. Only a small proportion of MƒÅori migrant men between the ages of 20 and 29 years were enrolled in university education. According to Te Puni K≈çkiri, 54% of Australian-born MƒÅori have high school qualifications in comparison to 55% for non-MƒÅori New Zealanders and the Australian national average of 59%. According to Te Puni K≈çkiri, 59 percent of MƒÅori within the prime working age population (25 to 54 years) have no tertiary qualification, compared with 37% of the Australian prime working population and 41% of New Zealand-born non-MƒÅori. Dr Tahu Kukutai and Dr Shefali Pawar, of the National Institute of Demographic and Economic Analysis (NIDEA) at the University of Waikato, have attributed the lower MƒÅori participation in tertiary education to changes to immigration legislation in 2001 which restricted access to social security and student loans for Australian non-citizens. =Employment= In 2013, 84% of MƒÅori in Australia between the ages of 25 and 54 years were participating in the Australian labour force. In 2011, the labour force participation rate for New Zealand- born MƒÅori males was 92.6% while that for Australian-born MƒÅori was 87.5% due to the latter's higher participation in tertiary education. An estimated 89% of MƒÅori migrant women in Australia were employed. Female MƒÅori participation in the Australian workforce was 76%, a gendered difference consistent with both MƒÅori and non-MƒÅori as well as NZ-born and Australian-born. In 2011, MƒÅori who lived and worked in Australia were disproportionately represented in lower-skilled occupations and under-represented in skilled occupations in comparison to the Australian national work force. Almost half of MƒÅori in Australia worked as labourers, machinery operators, or drivers. Less than one third of MƒÅori in Australia were employed in skilled occupations such as managers, professionals, and technicians and trades workers, compared with over half for all workers in Australia. 32% of MƒÅori in Australia worked in the construction, manufacturing, and mining sectors, compared with 20% of the Australian working population. In addition, other MƒÅori in Australia worked in occupations such as seasonal work, security, truck driving, and entertainment. Others have also found work as corrections officers and in the Australian Army. In 2011, 28.5% of MƒÅori worked in the construction and manufacturing sectors in comparison to 18.8% of all Australian workers and 21.2% of non- MƒÅori New Zealanders. A further 6.5% of MƒÅori were employed in the mining sector. In 2011, an estimated 25.3% of MƒÅori living in New South Wales were working in the construction and manufacturing sectors. This figure was similar in neighbouring Queensland where 29.7% of Maori in the state were employed in construction and manufacturing. Meanwhile, 13.7% of MƒÅori living in Western Australia were employed in the mining industry. Only about 7.9% of MƒÅori migrants in Australia were self-employed, compared to the non-MƒÅori New Zealand figure of 14.3% and the Australian national average of 15.3%. =Income= MƒÅori in Australia on average earn less than others including New Zealand-born non-MƒÅori. According to the 2011 Australian Census, the median incomes for prime working age MƒÅori was A$44,556, lower than the Australian median income of A$46,571 and the New Zealand-born non-Maori median income of A$51,619. MƒÅori women in Australia have a median income of A$35,903, compared with A$53,304 for MƒÅori men. This reflects their lower participation in the Australian labour force. =Family and childcare= In 2011, MƒÅori in Australia had a higher rate of single parents in comparison to the Australian national population. This ranged from 3.4% at the 15‚Äì24 years age bracket to 13.2% in the 40‚Äì44 years age bracket. In addition, an estimate 40% of MƒÅori in Australia provided unpaid childcare in contrast to the Australian national average of 30%. Culture =Language use= In 1986 only 22% of MƒÅori Australians spoke MƒÅori (or Te Reo) at home, and very few children spoke the language. At present, MƒÅori language classes exist in Australia in an attempt to preserve Te Reo there, and there is a MƒÅori-language radio station in Sydney. In 2011, 6.3% of MƒÅori living in Australia spoke Te Reo at home; a slight increase from the 5.7% recorded in 2006. In addition, 8.2% of NZ-born MƒÅori spoke Te Reo at home, compared to 2.4% of Australian-born MƒÅori. =Music and performing arts= Between the 1950s and 1980s, several MƒÅori showbands emigrated to Australia to exploit opportunities in the music entertainment industry and to escape perceived racism at New Zealand music venues. Some notable showbands have included Gugi and Nuki Waaka's Maori Volcanics Showband, Prince Tui Teka's The Maori Troubadours, the MƒÅori Hi- Five, the Quin Tikis, MƒÅori Kavaliers, the MƒÅori Castaways, and the Young Polynesians. The showband era began waning during the late 1970s, leading many musicians to continue their careers as soloists or smaller cabaret groups that played in north Queensland, Sydney, and the Gold Coast. While some returned to New Zealand, other showband families stayed in Australia. One notable musician was the Young Polynesian Darren Rehu, who played kapa haka and featured as a child star on QTQ-9's Happy Go 'Round show. Darren later played on the Auckland music circuit with popular jazz/funk band 358s. He also played backing for the state productions of Jesus Christ Superstar and The Lion King musical in Australia. Rehu subsequently migrated to the United Kingdom in 2005, joining the MƒÅori diaspora there. Sydney was also home to two kapa haka (traditional MƒÅori performance arts) groups Te Huinga Waka and Tupuranga. Te Huinga Waka has competed in New Zealand kapa haka competitions since 1988. =Sports= Several Australian-based MƒÅori have built successful careers in various sports including rugby union, rugby league, and volleyball. Stewart Simpson emigrated from Kawerau to Australia to play rugby and subsequently became the manager of the Australian national beach volleyball team. Another MƒÅori Australian is Danielle Drady-Harte, a former professional squash player who became the World Number 2 woman player of 1991. She later established the first squash and fitness academy at the Emirates Golf and Country Club in Dubai. Other notable MƒÅori Australian sportspersons have included former Australian Kangaroos player Ted Goodwin, Australian Football League player Wayne Schwass, rugby union player Jeremy Paul, and Newcastle Knights player Timana Tahu, and long jumper Jai Taurima. =Notable MƒÅori Australians= *Jodi Anasta - Actress and model *Gerard Beale - Rugby league player *Ricki- Lee Coulter - Singer *Manu Bennett - Actor *Keisha Castle-Hughes - Actress *Quade Cooper - Rugby union player *Russell Crowe - Film director and actor *Dane Gagai - Rugby league player *Megan Gale - Model *Ted Goodwin - Rugby league player *Courtney Eaton - Actress and model *Josh Hoffman - Rugby league player *Valentine Holmes - Rugby league player *Deborah Mailman - Actress *Dustin Martin - Australian rules footballer *Colleen McCullough - Author *Callan Mulvey - Actor *Kotuku Ngawati - Swimmer *Corey Norman - Rugby league player *Jeremy Paul - Rugby union player *Kalyn Ponga - Rugby league player *Shane Savage - Australian rules footballer *Wayne Schwass - Australian rules footballer *William Singe - Singer and songwriter *Chase Stanley - Rugby league player *Luke Steele - Musician *Timana Tahu - Rugby League player *James Tamou - Rugby league player *Kevin Taumata - Actor *Jai Taurima - Long jumper *Morgan Turinui - Rugby union player *Robert Whittaker - Mixed martial artist See also * New Zealand Australians * MƒÅori Americans References Further reading  * (History of Maori in Sydney)  * External links *Te Arohanui MƒÅori Culture Club, founded in Perth, Western Australia, in 1977 Category:Australian people of New Zealand descent Category:Australian people of MƒÅori descent Category:Polynesian Australian Category:MƒÅori diaspora Category:New Zealand emigrants to Australia ","title":"MƒÅori Australians"},{"id":"16732148","text":"Violence against women in Peru is defined as harassment or violence propagated against those who are born women. Intimate partner violence (IPV) is the most common form of gender-based violence that occurs though it can occur concurrently with sexual and emotional violence.Gomez-Beloz, Alfredo, Michelle A.

World Bank Policy Research Working Paper #4606. According to the World Health Organization, 49% of ever-partnered women (women who had been married, lived with a man, or had a regular sexual partner) in Lima and 61% in Cusco reported physical violence by a partner at some time in their life. For sexual violence by a partner these percentages were 23% in Lima and 47% in Cusco.\\"WHO Multi-Country Study on Women's Health and Domestic Violence against Women.\\" 2005. Accessed March 22, 2017. http://www.who.int/gender/violence/who_multicountry_study/fact_sheets/Peru2.pdf.  Gender-based violence  The status and discrimination of women in Peru is complex because it varies with class, ethnicity, and the economic place of women in traditional Peruvian society. Unlike women in the U.S., women who live in Peru have often been involved in agricultural products as well as handicraft.Orihuela, Sandra, and Abigail Montjoy. \\"The Evolution of Latin America's Sexual Harassment Law: A Look at Mini Skirts and Multinationals in Peru.\\" Cal. W. Int'l LJ 30 (1999): 323. This complexity has often not been recognized by the Peruvian government. The Peruvian Constitution of 1993 recognized a person's fundamental right to its moral, physical, and psychological integrity. However, it didn't specifically expand these protections to women, nor does it have specific discrimination laws that apply to women. The following sections outline the types of gender-based violence that women experience. = Domestic violence = In 2006, Ministry of Women and Social Development (MIMDES) centers reported 25,036 cases of domestic violence in Peru.Report on Human Rights Practices 2006: Peru. United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (March 6, 2007). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. The centers helped an average of 2,067 men and women per month. MIMDES also operated a toll-free hot line, which handled 7,785 requests for assistance regarding family disturbances during 2006. Women's organizations noted that alcohol abuse and traditional attitudes toward women aggravated the problems of rape and sexual abuse - particularly in rural areas. In November 2006, the World Health Organization reported that 69 percent of Peruvian women said they had suffered from some form of physical violence in their lives. Abuses are aggravated and perpetuated law enforcement practice, and laws that government discrimination against women. MIMDES and NGOs stated that many domestic abuse cases went unreported. NGO sources stated that the majority of reported cases did not result in formal charges because of fear of retaliation or because of the expense of filing a complaint. The legal and physical protections offered were limited because of legal delays, ambiguities in the law, and the lack of shelters for victims. According to a study done in Lima, Peru in 2007, abused women have a 1.63-fold increased risk for unintended pregnancy. Additionally, women who have experienced both physical and sexual abuse are 3.31 fold more likely to get unintentionally pregnant.Cripe, Swee May, Sixto E. Sanchez, Maria Teresa Perales, Nally Lam, Pedro Garcia, and Michelle A. Williams. \\"Association of intimate partner physical and sexual violence with unintended pregnancy among pregnant women in Peru.\\" International Journal of Gynecology & Obstetrics 100, no. 2 (2008): 104-108. Stereotypes and traditions normalize cycles of abuse. Across socioeconomic urban classes, \\"Mas me pegas, mas te quiero\\" (The more you beat me, the more I love you) is used to refer to amor serrano (high land love). This suggest two things: first, those in Peru tend to blame battered women who are poor and indigenous for the abuse they experience and second, that women enjoy violence. Migration within Peru remains a significant issue in Peru. According to Alcalde, it can produce one of two outcomes. First, it may allow a women to leave her abuser behind but second, migration to Lima may further entrench violence because women (in a new city) have to rely on an abusive partner.Alcalde, M. Cristina. \\"Migration and Class as Constraints in Battered Women's Attempts to Escape Violence in Lima Peru.\\" Latin American Perspectives 33, no. 6 (2006): 147-164. = Femicides = Between the years 2010 and 2017, 837 women were murdered in Peru while another 1,172 murder attempts were made during the period. A 2015 study found that in about 81% of the cases of attempted femicide, no measures were taken by authorities to protect the survivor, and 24% of women who turned to the justice system for help were later murdered by the very men from whom they had sought protection. = LGBTQ violence = There has been a significant amount of violence propagated against the Peruvian LGBTQ population.Caceres, Carlos F., Barbara Vanoss Marin, and Esther Sid Hudes. \\"Sexual coercion among youth and young adults in Lima, Peru.\\" Journal of adolescent health 27, no. 5 (2000): 361-367. First, according to a study done to determine the prevalence of sexual coercion among young adults in Peru, men and women who reported heterosexual coercion reported more lifetime STDs, lower age at first sex, and future homosexual behavior in men. Second, the Peruvian transgender population has also faced discrimination and violence.Silva-Santisteban, Alfonso, H. Fisher Raymond, Ximena Salazar, Jana Villayzan, Segundo Leon, Willi McFarland, and Carlos F. Caceres. \\"Understanding the HIV/AIDS epidemic in transgender women of Lima, Peru: results from a sero-epidemiologic study using respondent driven sampling.\\" AIDS and Behavior 16, no. 4 (2012): 872-881. Studies among MSM in Peru have shown that trans women show a higher proportion of HIV infection. This is often linked to higher rates of drug abuse, sex work, and lack of access to education.Melendez RM, Pinto R. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs really a hard life‚Äô: love, gender and HIV risk among male-to-female transgender persons. Cult Health Sex. 2007;9(3):233‚Äì45. Additionally, trans women in Peru are often victims of IPV and do not receive aid from the police.Silva-Santisteban A, Salazar X. Informe final de mapeo y encuesta sociodemogra¬¥fica del trabajo sexual en cuatro ciudades del Peru¬¥. Lima: UNFPA; 2009 These factors have caused overall HIV prevalence among trans women in Lima, Peru to be 29.6%. = Sexual violence = Peru demonstrates the complicity of the state government in the perpetration and perpetuation of sexual violence. However, the rationale and motives for committing sexual violence have differed across region and changed over time. Whether the state promotes sexual violence or rather just allows it to occur is difficult to ascertain because of lack of access to classified state record or testimonies. However, aggregated analyses have shown a pattern in state conflict and sexual violence. Through Peru's conflict with rebels, there were two peaks in the number of sexual abuses that corresponded with particularly difficult times during the conflict. Linked with the weakening of the PCP-SL after Abimael Guzman was captured in 1992, the number of sexual violence incidents in Peru decreased significantly. This correlation suggests that the state used sexual violence as a tool of war. However, though it was widespread, sexual violence in Peru tended to be more selected and perpetrated with deliberation - about 71% of cases involved a single victims. Rather than engaging in gang-rape, victims were often picked if they were identified as opposition to the state.Leiby, Michele L. \\"Wartime sexual violence in Guatemala and Peru.\\" International Studies Quarterly 53, no. 2 (2009): 445-468. Past sexual violence against women during this period of internal conflict, the shocks of the violence had long-term health implications for women.Grimard, Franque, and Sonia Laszlo. \\"Long-term effects of civil conflict on women‚Äôs health outcomes in Peru.\\" World Development 54 (2014): 139-155. Based on a study done by Grimard et al., the shock of the violence had an adverse effect on pregnant women, often stunting the growth of their children. This was true even when controlling for socioeconomic conditions. In 2001, Interim President Valentin Paniagua chartered a twelve- person commission to investigate human rights violations. The commission took about two years to submit its final report. The report found that rape was the most frequent for of abuse, constituting about 48% in Peru. Military officials were the most frequent offender (48% in Peru). Additionally, sexual violence was most often committed while victims were detained (52% in Peru). Finally, sexual violence in Peru was and often still is perpetuated towards its indigenous population. According to the National Statistics Institute, 20% of Peru's population is indigenous. These communities are politically and economically disadvantaged in comparison with the national population. The state responded with disproportionate violence and repression. = Street harassment = On par with other Latin American countries, street harassment is a prevalent problem in Peru. As a result, citizens created the Paremos el Acoso Callejero (PAC) initiative in 2012, which translates to 'Let's stop street harassment'. The purpose of this initiative was to analyze the structures of everyday violence towards women in Peru, such as catcalling. Additionally, this initiative was unique because it started on Facebook, Twitter, and DATEA, a platform that gives women the opportunity to geo- reference their experiences. Past being broadly successful with women, the PAC initiative has partnered with the Peruvian parliament spurring the only anti- street harassment law in Latin America.Vallejo, Elizabeth. \\"The Struggle Against Street Harassment in per√∫: New Media, Youth Feminism and International Political Advocacy.\\" In Third ISA Forum of Sociology (July 10‚Äì14, 2016). Isaconf, 2016.  Prevention programs  The Peruvian government and population has recognized gender-based as a prevalent issue. Therefore, it has instituted a variety of programs to address violence directed towards women. = Law = The law prohibits domestic violence, and penalties range from one month to six years in prison. The law gives judges and prosecutors the authority to prevent the convicted spouse or parent from returning to the family's home and authorizes the victim's relatives and unrelated persons living in the home to file complaints of domestic violence. The law also allows health professionals to document injuries. The law requires police investigation of domestic violence to take place within five days and obliges authorities to extend protection to women and children who are victims of domestic violence. Specific laws that address intimate partner violence (IPL) in Peru include the Family Violence Law (FVL) in 1993. Several non-partisan organizations in Peru have applauded this law to address domestic violence, but say that there should be other factors included. For example, non-married couples are not included under the law. Additionally, the law does not cover victims of sexual violence and victims have to undergo a long, bureaucratic processes to press charges. Finally, the other flaw is that the laws require couples to attempt reconciliation even with proof of abuse. Attempting to use Western-informed laws to address gender-based violence in Peru often fail because they don't take into account unique cultural or political factors that affect behavior.Flake, D. F. (2005). Individual, family, and community risk markers for domestic violence in Peru. Violence Against Women, 11 (3), 353‚Äì373. Studies contend that Peru should attempt to identify its own risk factors. = NGOs = MIMDES runs the Women's Emergency Program, which seeks to address the legal, psychological, and medical problems facing victims of domestic violence. As of 2006 MIMDES operated 39 centers, bringing together police, prosecutors, counselors, and public welfare agents together to help victims of domestic abuse. MIMDES continues efforts to sensitize government employees and the citizenry to domestic violence. In 2006, the Ombudsman's Office continued to complain that police officers reacted indifferently to charges of domestic violence, despite legal requirements to investigate the complaints. Also in 2006, female community leaders, former members of congress, and local media outlets launched awareness campaigns to provide citizens with more information about domestic violence. Second, the Women's Information and Documentation Centre's main objective is to contribute to the equality between the genders and to facilitate changes in Peruvian society. Through mostly cultural means, it retains bibliographical information.\\"Peru Women's Organisations.\\" Peru Women's Organisations. Accessed March 23, 2017. http://www.distel.ca/womlist/countries/peru.html. Third, there have been several groups that have engaged in advocacy and consciousness-raising regarding violence against the Peruvian LGBTQ population. For example, GALF, a Peruvian feminist lesbian group, organized to spur change against lesbophobia. GALF built partnerships within the gay community as well as with heterosexual feminist groups and services.Jitsuya, Nelly, and Rebeca Sevilla. \\"All the bridges that we build: Lesbophobia and sexism within the women's and gay movements in Peru.\\" Journal of Gay & Lesbian Social Services 16, no. 1 (2004): 1-28.

Built in the Sengoku period, it was occupied by a succession of daimy≈ç of ≈åno Domain under the Edo period Tokugawa shogunate. Background ≈åno Castle is located in northeastern Echizen Province on the main highway connecting Echizen with Mino Province. The castle is sited on the ridgeline of Kameyama Hill, extending east-to-west for approximately 300 meters. The inner bailey is located at the peak of the hill and is reinforced by stone ramparts made of mostly unmodified natural boulders. Secondary enclosures were located at lower levels and were also protected by water moats. History During the early Sengoku period, the area around ≈åno was under the control of the Asakura clan; however ≈åno was also a major stronghold of the Ikk≈ç-ikki movement. After both the Asakura and the Ikk≈ç-ikki were destroyed by Oda Nobunaga in 1575, he assigned the area to his general Kanamori Nagachika under the regional control of Shibata Katsuie. Kanamori began the construction of ≈åno Castle using the latest contemporary designs, and the castle was completed by 1580. Kanamori was subsequently promoted to governor of Hida Province in 1586, and the area was assigned to Aoki Kazunori followed by Oda Hidekatsu by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. After the Battle of Sekigahara, the entire province of Echizen was assigned by Tokugawa Ieyasu to his second son, Y≈´ki Hideyasu in 1601 as Fukui Domain. In 1624, Fukui Domain was divided, with Y≈´ki Hideyasu's third son, Matsudaira Naomasa being awarded a 55,000 koku fief centered at ≈åno. This became ≈åno Domain. Naomasa was transferred to Matsumoto Domain in 1633 and was replaced by his younger brother Matsudaira Naomoto in 1635. Naomoto was then transferred to Yamagata Domain in 1644, and was replaced by his younger brother, Matsudaira Naoyoshi. Naoyoshi's son Matsudaira Naoakira was in turn transferred to Himeji Domain in 1682. The domain was then assigned to a cadet branch of the Doi clan under Doi Toshifusa. The Doi clan would rule ≈åno for the next eight generations until the Meiji restoration. The castle burned down in 1775, but with the exception of the donjon was reconstructed by 1795. Throughout its history, ≈åno suffered from severe financial problems; however, Doi Toshitada (1811-1869) implemented substantial reforms and introduced rangaku and western technology. Although a small domain, ≈åno was noted in the Bakumatsu period for its westernised army and its han school. Following the Meiji restoration, the castle was pulled down, with the exception of a couple of gates which were given to nearby Buddhist temples, and the area was used for government buildings. Current situation Some remnants of the original stone ramparts remain, and parts of the old j≈çkamachi with traditional samurai houses and merchant houses remain. In 1968, a faux-donjon was built for use as a local history museum. The castle was listed as one of the Continued Top 100 Japanese Castles in 2017.

They fuse elements of folk, indie rock and post-punk using eclectic instrumentation including trumpet, violin, mandolin, musical saw, clarinet and saxophone. Since their formation they have released three studio albums and one EP.  Background  The band, whose name comes from the Charles Baudelaire novella La Fanfarlo, started performing live in small London indie clubs in 2006, and released four limited edition 7\\" singles on London-based indie labels (one of which a split single with Sleeping States) throughout 2006‚Äì2008. Their debut album Reservoir was recorded in October/November 2008 at Tarquin Studios, Connecticut, USA and was produced by Peter Katis (The National, Interpol). The album was released in February 2009 on the band's own label Raffle Bat and later licensed to the Atlantic imprint Canvasback, who released it in the UK and US in October 2009 and in Europe in April 2010. Their single \\"The Walls Are Coming Down\\" was released during September 2009. The music video for the single was directed by Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard and features escape artist Roslyn Walker performing the Hanging Straitjacket Escape, a stunt first performed by Harry Houdini in the early 1900s. The stunt was also incorporated into the band's show at Webster Hall in New York on 19 December 2009 (this time by escape artist Michael Lee). In early September 2011, the band announced on their website that their newest album, Rooms Filled with Light was finished and posted a video of the first song, \\"Replicate\\". The album was released on 28 February 2012 in the United States, and on 27 February everywhere else. In October 2013 the band released The Sea EP which is the first part of a Science Fiction/speculative/Utopian concept project. The lyrical content of this whole project presents a discussion about where humanity has come from (potentially), what we have become, and where we are heading. This is spoken of in terms of culture and science. The band have described their current sound as Space Opera meets Spaghetti Western. Tom Paull Maya, 'Interview with Simon Balthasar from Fanfarlo', Made in Shoreditch Magazine, 26 September 2013.

Early life and education  Garbowsky was born and raised in South Plainfield, New Jersey, the son of Lois and Robert Garbowsky. He has one sibling, Juliann. He attended John E. Riley Elementary School and began playing violin in 3rd grade. He played drums in middle school and when he was 13, he asked his parents for a bass guitar for Christmas. Garbowsky graduated from South Plainfield High School in 2004 and that fall enrolled in Seton Hall University in South Orange. He played bass in a band called Level Zero, which won a Battle of the Bands at Seton Hall in 2005. In the spring of 2005, he had just finished his freshman year when he decided he wanted to go into music production.

It uses the story of the Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen's attempt to reach the North Pole, and his subsequent campaign to relieve famine in the Soviet Union to explore the role of art in a world beset by seemingly greater issues. It is named after Fram, the ship built for Nansen for his Arctic journey, and subsequently used by Roald Amundsen to reach the South Pole. Fram received its premiere at the Olivier auditorium of the Royal National Theatre, London on 10 April 2008. The National Theatre's production was directed by Tony Harrison and Bob Crowley; its cast included Jasper Britton as Nansen, Mark Addy as Hjalmar Johansen, Sian Thomas as Sybil Thorndike and Jeff Rawle as Gilbert Murray.National Theatre : Productions : Fram Plot The play starts in Poets' Corner, Westminster Abbey in London, where the ghost of Gilbert Murray enlists Sybil Thorndike to join her in his new play, Fram, at the Royal National Theatre. They travel from the Abbey to the theatre to begin the play, and it starts in the Arctic with Fridtjof Nansen and his suicidal alcoholic companion Hjalmar Johansen trying to reach the North Pole. It skips forward in time to after Nansen and Johansen's record has been broken. In despair, Nansen becomes desperate, and Johansen shoots himself. Nansen then goes on to try to help the victims of the Russian famine, though he is haunted by the ghost of Johansen. Nansen associates with Gilbert Murray and Sybil Thorndike in his attempts to support the work in helping the children in Russia. Murray and Thorndike returning to Poets' Corner where they are haunted by a muted Kurdish refugee poet (based on Abas Amini ). As he is about to ascend to the afterworld of the poets, Murray declares himself unworthy and storms off. The play ends with Nansen and Johansen describing the plight of two African refugees who died of cold aboard a plane. Themes There are many themes used in the play, most of which relate to modern day problems in the world. *Refugees: both the mute Kurdish refugee and the two African boys are refugees, and they are portrayed as great heroes, heading for a destination. This is linked into the Nansen passport scheme, and the inability of the famine victims to flee to the west. *Climate Change: the plays' final scene is a projection of London under snow, and Nansen himself described the end of the world as one that would be covered in ice, which he contrasted with the fiery Ragnarok of Norse myth. *Famine: the play largely bases itself around the Russian famine of 1921, and deals with the theme of famine. Eglantyne notes that if some sort of projection device could be put into people's homes (an allusion to the television), then the scenes of famine could be broadcast to the masses, and everyone would send money. Murray replies with the fact that they could simply turn it off. *Socialism versus Social Darwinism: Nansen goes from being a Social Darwinist to supporting humanitarianism with the Russian aid movement, whereas Johansen goes from believing in a united socialist world to a social Darwinist view after his death. *The value of Art: A debate is held to discover which art form, including poetry, theatre or cinema is best at describing the horrors of famine.

The use of verse received criticism, with many reviewers lampooning it with their own attempts at doggerel. Rhoda Koenig wrote, ‚ÄúSince the play stands up for poetry in a world dominated by fact and image, it's unfortunate that Harrison's verse does not provide much evidence for the defence.‚ÄùIndependent review There was some admiration for the scope of the themes addressed. Heather Neill of The Stage wrote, ‚Äú... no-one is in any doubt that serious issues are being addressed.‚ÄùThe Stage review Michael Billington commented, ‚ÄúIt hardly makes for a coherent whole, but it has exciting moments and a wild madcap inventiveness...He has bitten off more than any single play can chew and, dramatically, there are dead patches. But I can forgive any play that aims high.‚Äù.Guardian review However, some reviewers found the play too long and self-indulgent. For example, The Daily Telegraph complained, ‚ÄúHarrison the director appears to have done nothing to curb Harrison the poet's intolerable logorrhea.‚ÄùTelegraph review Many critics praised Sian Thomas's Thorndike. The Stage called it ‚Äúa brilliant, brave, performance as a red-gowned Thorndike demonstrating the power of theatre to change minds by acting a starving Russian.‚Äù The journal Arion published a critical appraisal by Rebecca Nemser describing Fram as \\"not just a play within a play, but a theater within a theater. Most of all, it is a poem about poetry.\\" Nemser praises the play while recognising its problematic reception: :\\"At intermission, the audience drank wine and talked about the play on the terrace of the National Theatre on London's South Bank. London's monuments were all illuminated, reflected in the dark waters of the Thames. 'It's in verse,' one woman hissed, outraged. Some drifted away into the lovely spring night and did not return. And indeed Fram is not for the squeamish; it is full of evocations of foul smells, buzzing flies, rotted flesh, cannibalism, horse- dung bread, the horrors of war, famine, despair, and doubt.\\" Doubt, in Nemser's view, lies at the thematic heart of the play.Rebecca Nemser, \\"The Scream,\\" Arion 16 (2008) 149‚Äì156, pdf online and archived.

He had failed to pay $100,000 to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and had hidden some personal assets under the names of relatives. Graziano was sentenced to five years in prison and fined $250,000. In 1994, Graziano ordered his crew to find and kill John Pappa and Calvin Hennigar, both mobsters with the Colombo crime family. On one occasion, the two men had fired shots inside a topless bar in Staten Island owned by Graziano, wounding one patron. An enraged Graziano had sent his Brooklyn crew hunting for them. However, Graziano later met with Colombo family representatives and agreed on a settlement to the problem. Graziano called off the murder order, but in 2002 he would be indicted on two counts of murder conspiracy due to this episode. =Consigliere= In March 2002, Graziano was indicted on separate racketeering charges in New York, Arizona and Florida.

Plot In the film, Karl Hulten (Kiefer Sutherland) is an American GI who is stalking the black market of London after stealing an army truck and going AWOL. There he meets up with Betty Jones (Emily Lloyd), a stripper with a deluded fantasy world view formed by watching a steady stream of Hollywood film noir and gangster pictures. Seeing Karl, who claims he is Chicago Joe doing advance work in London for encroaching Chicago gangsters, Betty takes the opportunity to set her fantasies to life as she connives Karl into a spree of petty crimes. With luck on their side, the spree keeps escalating, until Betty urges Karl to commit the ultimate crime: murder.

Environmental, educational, and political activism  After serving on the City Council, Skinner served in leadership capacities for several nonprofit organizations concerning the environment. She co-founded ICLEI ‚Äî Local Governments for Sustainability, a coalition of 800 global cities, and Cities for Climate Protection with 500 U.S. member cities, to assist urban regions with environmental and global warming policy, respectively. She was the U.S. director of The Climate Group, an international organization that works with businesses to address global warming. She also coauthored the best selling book series, Fifty Things You Can Do to Save the Earth and has written a pair of articles concerning global warming for the San Francisco Chronicle. Skinner was an active member in the Parent-Teacher Association (PTA) and worked on a campaign to pass a parcel tax to fund Berkeley schools. She was Chair of the Berkeley School Enrichment Program Committee at Martin Luther King Jr. High School. Skinner coordinated Loni Hancock's 2002 State Assembly campaign and was a Field Manager for Barbara Lee's 2002 Congressional campaign. She has worked for the campaigns of several local, state, and national democratic candidates, including presidential candidates Al Gore and John Kerry.  Recent political career  Skinner was appointed to the East Bay Regional Park Board of Directors in March 2006 to fill a vacancy due to the death of incumbent Jean Siri. She was appointed by a 6‚Äì0 vote and was selected over several other candidates for the position, including former Berkeley mayor Shirley Dean. Skinner was then elected to the East Bay Regional Park Board in 2006 with 84% of the vote. Her park district included parts of Albany, Berkeley, El Cerrito, El Sobrante, Emeryville, Kensington, Richmond, San Pablo, Pinole & Oakland. Skinner was considered a likely candidate for the California state Assembly as early as 2006 and had previously considered a run in 2002. She ultimately announced her candidacy in late January 2008. She defeated several opponents in the primary election; the most well-known of which included Richmond City Councilman Tony Thurmond, Berkeley City Councilman Kriss Worthington, and Berkeley resident Dr. Phil Polakoff. She was elected to the State Assembly in 2008 and re-elected in 2010 and 2012. In 2016, Skinner ran for the California State Senate to replace Senator Loni Hancock, who was termed-out of office in 2016. Skinner won the June 2016 Primary Election by over 17%.

In the 2019 legislative session, she chaired the state Senate's Public Safety committee.  Legislation  = Income equality = *Income Taxes on the Super Rich ‚Äî AB 1130: Skinner pushed for legislation in 2011 that restored income tax rates on millionaires to the rate they were under Republican Governors Reagan and Wilson. The California Federation of Teachers fought for these tax rates to be in Proposition 30, which increased Proposition 30 revenue by over $2 billion a year. *Hungry Free Kids Act ‚Äî AB 402: In 2011 Skinner passed a bill updating the CalFresh program. Children in the program live in households struggling to make ends meet. CalFresh can help struggling families have access to daily nutritious meals, yet thousands were not enrolled, the bill makes it easy for these families to be enrolled and receive the food assistance they need. *College Student Access to CalFresh ‚Äî AB 1930: Skinner carried AB 1930 in 2014 to give college students who were previously not considered eligible to CalFresh programs better access to food assistance. = Ending corporate loopholes = *Internet Fairness ‚Äî AB 155: Skinner pushed legislation to tax online sales that was approved in 2009 as part of the state budget. Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed the legislation.California lawmaker pushes to tax online sales, by Marc Lifsher, Los Angeles Times, 20 January 2011 On 19 January 2011 Skinner introduced similar legislation in the form of AB153. The bill requires out-of-state online sellers with affiliates in California to collect sales tax on purchases made by state residents. The affiliate provision was included to ensure that only sellers with a California nexus are taxed, as required by federal law.Russian investment gives Plastic Logic flexibility, by Andrew S. Ross, The San Francisco Chronicle, 19 January 2011 \\"This legislation will close the current loophole in tax law which has allowed out-of-state companies to avoid collecting California sales and use tax,\\" stated Skinner. Skinner estimated that AB153 could produce between $250 million and $500 million per year in new revenue. She and other supporters of the bill believe that the election of Jerry Brown to the governorship and support from retailers such as Barnes & Noble will help the measure become law.Major retailers back bid for 'Amazon tax', by Kevin Yamamura, Sacramento Bee, 20 January 2011 *Enforcing Workplace Safety ‚Äî AB 1634: Skinner highlighted the dangerous conditions cited by California's workplace safety regulator that had to be fixed immediately, even if the employer appeals, so workers and communities aren't put at risk, passing AB 1634 to enforce workplace safety. = Education = *Childcare and PreSchool Expansion ‚Äî 2014 Budget Bill: As Budget Chair Skinner facilitated the largest funding increase for early childhood education in over a decade, enabling the State to enroll thousands more children in preschool and quality childcare. *Higher Ed Funding While Halting Tuition Increases ‚Äî 2014 Budget Bill: The University of California and California State University systems suffered huge recession cuts resulting in student tuition and fee increases. As Budget Chair Skinner worked for a larger state allocation to UC and CSU with language that would rescind the funds if UC/CSU increased student tuition. *Saving Energy Saving Schools ‚Äî AB/SB 39: Schools spend millions of dollars each year on energy, Skinner's legislation, AB/SB 39, provided every California school district Proposition 39 funds to pay for energy upgrades, enabling the money saved on utility bills to go back into the classroom. = Criminal justice reform = *Foster Youth Detention ‚Äî AB 2607: In 2014 Skinner called attention to the fact that foster children get stuck in detention longer just for the \\"crime\\" of not having a home, she wrote AB 2607 to stop the practice of using juvenile hall as a substitute for finding real homes for children. *Juvenile Justice ‚Äî AB 999: Skinner wrote AB 999, which was included in the 2014 Budget Bill, in 2009 to fix the unfair system used to incarcerate youth. Guards in state juvenile facilities used \\"time-adds\\" to unfairly prolong the time youth were incarcerated. Within three years of stopping \\"time adds\\" the number of youth in state incarceration was cut in half. *Recidivism Reinvestment Fund ‚Äî 2014 Budget Bill: As part of the 2014 budget bill Skinner saw that $100M was provided for community services to support reentry of our formerly incarcerated, required inmates be issued State IDs and be enrolled in MediCal prior to being released, and eliminated the lifelong ban imposed on those sentenced for non-violent drug crimes from ever accessing CalFresh or CalWorks. = Climate and environment = *Doubling Rooftop Solar ‚Äî AB 560: Written by Skinner in 2009, AB 560 expanded net metering so that homes and businesses could get credit on their utility bills for the electricity produced by their rooftop solar. *Electricity from Renewable Energy ‚Äî SB X1-2: Skinner's SB X1-2 bill set a 33% Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) requiring 33% of California's electricity to be generated from solar, wind, geothermal and other renewable energy by 2020. *Energy Storage ‚Äî AB 2514: Energy storage captures extra electricity produced by wind, solar and other renewable energy. Skinner's bill, AB 2514, makes sure utilities use energy storage electricity when we need it. *Naming Eastshore State Park after Save the Bay Founder ‚Äî AC 55: California's 8.5-mile (13.7 km) ribbon of parkland along the eastern side of San Francisco Bay is now named after Save the Bay co-founder Sylvia McLaughlin due to Skinner, a worthy recognition of her significant leadership. = Gun violence prevention = *Gun Violence Restraining Orders ‚Äî AB 1014: Skinner saw that many instances of gun violence were preventable if the family was allowed to act when they saw one of their own show violent tendencies, as was the case with the Isla Vista Shooter. Her bill established a firearm restraining order so every family now has a tool to get guns out of the hands of those threatening violence. *Assault Weapons Loophole ‚Äî AB 48: California's assault weapons ban had loophole, it was perfectly legal to buy kits that converted guns into working like assault weapons. Skinner introduced AB 48, which made these ammo kits illegal. = Housing = *Transit-Rich Housing/Local Zoning Preemption ‚Äî SB 827: In 2018, Skinner co-sponsored a sweeping bill to address the state's acute housing shortage by overriding local zoning laws to permit denser housing near mass transit and bus stops statewide. The bill failed to advance out of its first committee review. *AP News Quote: ‚ÄúI want to thank Moms 4 Housing for taking that house and for demonstrating that nowhere, nowhere should there be a vacant house anywhere in California when we have the housing crisis that we have,‚Äù said Democratic Sen.

Origins Rhythm guitarist/vocalist David Price (born on September 23, 1944 in Ballinger, Texas) and drummer/vocalist Don Poncher (born on July 29, 1947 in Chicago, Illinois) were original members of The New Buffalo Springfield, formed in September 1968 by Dewey Martin, the drummer in the original Buffalo Springfield. David Price had previously played with Austin, Texas group, The Chelsea in the mid-1960s and (briefly), L.A-based Armadillo in mid-1968. Price was also Davy Jones's stand-in in The Monkees TV show thanks to his connections with his old friend Mike Nesmith. Don Poncher, who'd worked with Tex Williams when he was 16 years old, had also played with Brothers Keepers in the San Fernando Valley in the mid-1960s. The new version of the legendary group, which also included lead guitarist Gary Rowles, bass player Bob Apperson and horn player Jim Price, played extensively between November 1968 and February 1969 before imploding when Stephen Stills and Neil Young took legal action to prevent Martin from using the \\"Buffalo Springfield\\" name. In spring 1969, Dewey Martin and David Price formed a second version of New Buffalo Springfield with bass player/vocalist Randy Fuller (born on January 29, 1944 in Hobbs, New Mexico) (formerly of Bobby Fuller Four) and lead guitarist/vocalist Bob BJ Jones (born on November 9, 1942 in Woodbury, New Jersey died on June 15, 2013 in Sioux Falls, South Dakota), who'd worked with Little Richard briefly. The new line up, now going by the name Blue Buffalo, recorded some tracks for Atlantic which were never completed and in June added second lead guitarist Joey Newman from L.A band, Touch. Newman (b. Vern Kjellberg, August 29, 1947, Seattle, Washington) had previously worked with Don & The Good Times, The Liberty Party and Merrilee Rush & The Turnabouts. After a tour of the North West (billed as New Buffalo Springfield) in July 1969, the musicians sacked Dewey Martin and returned to Los Angeles where they added Don Poncher from the earlier line up. Signs to Atlantic Records In August, the group adopted the name Blue Mountain Eagle, which the musicians had taken from a newspaper in Grant County, Oregon during their time with Dewey Martin. After Ahmet Ertegun personally signed them to Atlantic Records, the band recorded its lone album live in one session at Wally Heider's studios in Los Angeles in December 1969. The group toured extensively, opening for Santana, Jimi Hendrix, Love, Pink Floyd and many others. During April 1970, Randy Fuller left to briefly join Dewey Martin's Medicine Ball and the band recruited studio bassist David L. Johnson (born on October 21, 1945 in Burbank, California) from the Beach Boys and Dr John's touring band. The following month, Atlantic released the group's eponymous lone album which only sold a few thousand copies. The group then recorded a version of Stephen Stills's \\"Marianne\\" as a single but when that failed to become a hit, the group disbanded around September 1970.

Training includes courses that prepare a student for a career as a Paralegal/Legal Assistant, Pharmacy Technician, Medical Transcription, Medical Billing and Coding, Medical Office Assistant, Dental Office Assistant, Physical Therapy Aide, Veterinary Assistant and Child Care Provider. The Institute was preceded by the Blackstone College of Law (or Blackstone School of Law), an unaccredited correspondence law school in operation until the 1970s. In 1948, the Federal Trade Commission ordered Blackstone to cease misrepresenting its qualifications as a law school, and characterized the institution as a \\"diploma mill\\".In re Blackstone College of Law, Inc., Federal Trade Commission Decisions, Volume 44 (1948), p. 756-772.  History  In 1890, students with a desire to study law were confronted with many difficulties. Most textbooks were written in a technical style which was difficult to understand. The texts dealt primarily with practice and procedure, while the branches of the law that pertain to business transactions, such as private corporations and partnerships, were not readily accessible for student use. Around 1912, a group of prominent educators identified with the Chicago-based Blackstone Institute decided to prepare an up-to-date commentary dealing with the modern rules of law and their origin, nature, and growth. Eugene A. Gilmore, at the time Professor of Law at the University of Wisconsin and a member of the Educational Committee of the American Bar Association, was appointed Editor-in-Chief of the new series. The entire field of law was divided into sixty branches. The best authors for each subject were selected, and the decision was made to leave out as many of the Latin phrases, unnecessary technical matter, and useless citations as possible. In the late 1970s, the educational component of the Blackstone Institute changed from a School of Law to a legal assistant/paralegal program of study. The Institute moved from Chicago to Dallas and assumed operations under the name Blackstone Paralegal Studies, Inc. Additional study units on legal research, ethics, and employment skills were added so that graduating students could sit for the prestigious Certified Legal Assistant (CLA) exam. Direct Learning Systems, Inc., a distance education school, purchased the legal assistant/paralegal school from the retiring owner in September 2001. In December of that year, the school was moved to Emmaus, PA, and later relocated in the summer of 2007 to Allentown, PA.  Accreditation and Licensing  The Blackstone Career Institute is privately licensed by the Pennsylvania Department of Education1 and accredited by the Accrediting Commission of the Distance Education and Training Council (DETC), Washington, D.C., and the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.

The character debuted in Thun'da #1 (1952), with writer Gardner Fox scripting. After only a few issues the title was discontinued in 1953. http://www.toonopedia.com/thunda.htm The character, played by Buster Crabbe, was the main character in the 1952 Columbia Pictures serial King of the Congo. Publication history The character first appeared in 1952 in the comic series Thun'da #1. Editor Ray Krank asked Frazetta to remove the prehistoric elements but he left the title instead and started looking for work outside comic books. Fictional character biography Thun'da was Roger Drum, a World War II United States Air Force officer who was shot down while flying over a valley deep in the heart of Africa. After crashing, he freed himself from his aircraft only to be captured by hostile ape-men. He managed to escape, and wandered through the valley, pushing himself to exercise daily and becoming a paragon of physical perfection. It was while he was wandering that he was spotted by Pha, the queen of the people who lived in the valley. After fighting and destroying the hostile ape-men, Thun'da rushed to their temple and rang the sacred gong, thereby summoning \\"the mother of all serpents,\\" whom he killed with the last three shots from his revolver. He won the respect of Pha's people, and they worshipped him as if he were a god. Later, after an earthquake ravaged the lost valley, Thun'da was able to get Pha to safety along with their pet sabretoothed tiger, but her people were killed and the lost valley was sealed from them forever. Collected editions The comic series was reprinted in 1987 by Fantagraphics Books as Frank Frazetta's Thun'da Tales, and, in August 2010, Dark Horse Comics released a hardcover collection Thun'da, King of the Congo Archive (). Other media The screen rights for the character were bought by Columbia Pictures, who brought Thun'da to the screen in the serial King of the Congo (1952), featuring Buster Crabbe as Roger Drum, the officer who becomes Thunda. In the serial, Roger Drum was assigned to take a valuable microfilm to a new location, but was shot down en route, and crashed in the secluded lost valley. The spies named in the microfilm try to obtain it, and Thunda must try to get it back. King of the Congo was both the last Tarzanesque serial and the last serial to star Buster Crabbe.

Though the lake is naturally occurring (a former channel of the Tualatin River), it has been significantly altered because of the concrete dam that has increased its size to . The United States Geological Survey records the official name as Lake Oswego and, because of its artificially increased size, classifies it as a reservoir. To distinguish it from the city, however, the lake is usually called Oswego Lake. Geologic history The lake is a former channel of the Tualatin River, carved in basalt to the Willamette River. Eventually, the river changed course and abandoned the Oswego route. About 13,000 to 15,000 years ago, the ice dam that contained Glacial Lake Missoula ruptured, resulting in the Missoula Floods, which backed the Columbia River up the Willamette River. The flooding created an underwater vortex called a kolk, which scoured out and enlarged the old Oswego channel, creating a natural lake. The rocks and boulders were flung by the kolk up to a mile away to present-day Durham and Tualatin, where they were quarried for many years before the site was converted to the Bridgeport Village shopping center. Early human habitation The lake was known to the native Clackamas people as Waluga (\\"wild swan\\"), for the birds they hunted there. With the arrival of European settlers in the mid-19th century, the lake was called Sucker Lake for a type of fish that was abundant in its waters.Fulton, p. 15 In 1847, Albert Alonzo Durham built a sawmill on Sucker Creek, the lake's outlet to the Willamette River. In 1850, he made the first Donation Land Claim in the area, which he named Oswego after Oswego, New York. Iron industry Remains of the Oregon Iron Company Furnace in Lake Oswego's George Rogers ParkIn 1865, the Oregon Iron Company was incorporated with the goal of making the town of Oswego an industrial center for the smelting of the abundant iron ore in the area. The company purchased the entire town of Oswego, including the lake and surrounding hills, which were rich in not only iron ore, but trees that would be turned into charcoal to feed the furnaces. Population in the town boomed, aided by the opening of a narrow gauge railroad from Portland in 1886. The Oregon iron industry peaked in 1890, but with the availability of cheaper coke-fired iron and steel mills, by the early 20th century it had nearly collapsed. Lake expansion The Lake Oswego Canal was built in 1872 to connect then-Sucker Lake to the Tualatin River.In 1871, the Tualatin River Navigation & Manufacturing Company began work to build a continuous waterway that would connect the Tualatin River to the Willamette. The company planned to build two canals: one to connect the Tualatin to the lake to provide access to the iron smelter, and a second with locks that would connect the lake to the Willamette via Sucker Creek.Fulton, p. 33 The first canal was finished in 1872, but due to low water, was not passed through until January 21, 1873, when the sternwheeler Onward made the first trip. In 1873, the completion of the Willamette Falls Locks made traffic past Willamette Falls possible without portage; since the Tualatin was more difficult to navigate anyway, the idea of a second canal was abandoned. A series of wooden dams had been built at the outlet to Sucker Creek beginning in 1860 to provide water power; but since winter floods would wash out these dams within a few years, in 1921 a concrete dam was built, which not only provided a more reliable power source, but also allowed the lake level to be precisely controlled. The level was allowed to rise several feet to cover the unsightly stumps left over from logging and create a more visually appealing shoreline.Fulton, p. 80 With the name Sucker Lake considered unappealing to potential residents, the community decided to rename the lake. While \\"Lake Tualatin\\" was considered, in 1913 the United States Board on Geographic Names officially renamed it Oswego Lake. In 1961, the USGS officially changed the name to \\"Lake Oswego,\\" though the old name is usually used to avoid confusion with the name of the city. In 1928, a marshy area known as the Duck Pond adjacent to the lake was flooded, and a canal dug to it to connect to the main lake to create Lakewood Bay, which allowed more shoreline homes to be built next to the newly completed Pacific Highway (now part of Oregon Route 43).Fulton, p. 83 Land development The Lake Grove Swim Park on the north shore of Oswego Lake, one of several swim parksWith the demise of the iron industry, the now-renamed Oregon Iron & Steel Company turned to development of its approximately of land surrounding the lake. The company built a power plant in 1909, just before the incorporation of the City of Oswego in 1910. Headed by Oregon Iron & Steel president William M. Ladd (son of former Portland mayor William S. Ladd, who was one of the original investors in the Oregon Iron Company), the Ladd Estate Company converted the iron town into a prestigious lakeside retreat. In 1924, Paul Murphy developed the Oswego Lake Country Club to promote Oswego as a place to \\"live where you play.\\" The Paul Murphy Company replaced Ladd's company as developer of Oregon Iron and Steel's property in 1940, and the following year, Oregon Iron and Steel created the Lake Oswego Corporation, which still owns the lake as a private corporation of lakefront property owners. In 1960, shortly before ending its existence, Oregon Iron & Steel deeded the powerhouse and dams to the corporation. With the relative scarcity of building easements, lakefront property remains prestigious, and a number of architecturally significant homes have been built along its shores, including the Carl C. Jantzen Estate, a Tudor-style estate on the National Register of Historic Places, built on an island on the lake's north shore by the founder of the Jantzen swimwear company in 1930. In addition, the lakeshore features homes by noted Portland architects such as Richard Sundeleaf and Van Evera Bailey. Ownership and access Sign in Millennium Plaza Park in Lake Oswego, asserting private status of the lake Despite a decades-old status quo in which the Lake Oswego Corporation maintains that it owns the lake and has the authority to restrict access to it, state and local law enforcement have recently indicated that they consider the lake to be public and that they will not pursue charges against anyone for using it. As of 2012, local law enforcement was on the record saying the water is public property and that it was more likely to charge the corporation's security patrols with unlawful arrest than to cite swimmers or boaters for enjoying the water. To control the waters, the corporation has posted \\"no trespassing\\" signs and issued permits to select individuals who overcome various administrative hurdles. The corporation also regulates boat and operator licensing, water safety, and water quality, but those regulations may not be actually binding. With most land around the lake privately owned, and following a unanimous vote by the Lake Oswego City Council to bar entry to the lake from several lakefront parks, few people have been able to test the authority of the corporation to enforce those regulations. The ability of the corporation to restrict access to the water has been questioned on numerous occasions. According to recent independent assessments of the legal situation, including a 2005 Oregon Attorney General opinion regarding the public's right to use navigable waterways in Oregon, the waters are publicly owned, though the ground beneath the lake is owned by the shareholders of the corporation, including 690 lakefront property owners and another 515 families who belong to one of 20 waterfront easement associations. The corporation argues that the federal Water Resources Development Act of 1976 specifically classified the lake as non-navigable; therefore, the Attorney General opinion‚Äîwhich states that waterways over private land are only public if they are \\"navigable-for-public-use\\"‚Äîdoes not apply. The corporation also asserts that the lake is an artificially-expanded power reservoir and not a natural body of water. In May 2012, a federal lawsuit was filed against the city of Lake Oswego to prevent it from limiting public access to the lake. The case was dismissed from federal court in October, with the judge indicating that the state of Oregon, due to its presumed ownership interest, should be able to weigh in on the case. The plaintiffs refiled in state court in November 2012, and in 2014, the judge ruled that the city had the right to block access. The Oregon Court of Appeals upheld the lower court ruling in 2017. The plaintiffs appealed to the Oregon Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case in April 2018 to determine whether the lake is public and if the city can prohibit access. In August 2019, the Oregon Supreme Court ruled partially in favor of the City of Lake Oswego, but remanded the case back to the trial court. The Oregon Supreme Court held that \\"if Oswego Lake is among the navigable waterways that the state holds in trust for the public, then neither the state nor the city may unreasonably interfere with the public‚Äôs right to enter the water from the abutting waterfront parks.\\"https://cdm17027.contentdm.oclc.org/digital/collection/p17027coll3/id/7446/rec/1 Lake health Lakewood Bay during 2010‚Äì2011 drawdown.Periodically, the corporation lowers the water level in the lake by opening the dam to enable lakefront property owners to conduct repairs on docks and boathouses. In September 2010, the lake was drawn down approximately to allow replacement of an aging sewer pipe that traverses the lake, the lowest lake level since 1962 when the original sewer line was installed. The lake was refilled to its usual level in the summer of 2011. In recent years, the lake has experienced explosive algae growth in the lake, due in part to runoff from lawn fertilizer, which is rich in phosphorus.

Although this first flight took place in 1932, manufacture did not commence until 1934, by which time General Motors had, in turn, gained a controlling interest in North American Aviation and merged it with General Aviation, which they already owned. The upshot of this was that the GA-43 became the first aircraft produced by North American. The GA-43 was a conventional low-wing cantilever monoplane of all-metal construction. The prototype had fixed tailwheel landing gear, but the main units of this were later changed to be made retractable, and three of the four production examples also had retractable mainwheels, the fourth aircraft having twin pontoons instead.

A synthesizable CPU core, it was for many years maintained by developers at OpenCores.org, although, since 2015, that activity has now been taken over by the Free and Open Source Silicon Foundation at the librecores.org website. The Verilog RTL description is released under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL). Architecture  Block diagram of the OR1200 CPU/DSP The IP core of the OR1200 is implemented in the Verilog HDL. As an open source core, the design is fully public and may be downloaded and modified by any individual. The official implementation is maintained by developers at OpenCores.org. The implementation specifies a power management unit, debug unit, tick timer, programmable interrupt controller (PIC), central processing unit (CPU), and memory management hardware. Peripheral systems and a memory subsystem may be added using the processor's implementation of a standardized 32-bit Wishbone bus interface. The OR1200 is intended to have a performance comparable to an ARM10 processor architecture.  CPU/DSP  The OR1200 CPU is an implementation of the 32-bit ORBIS32 instruction set architecture (ISA) and (optionally) ORFP32X ISA implementing IEEE-754 compliant single precision floating point support. The ISA has five instruction formats and supports two addressing modes: register indirect with displacement, and program-counter relative. The implementation has a single-issue 5-stage pipeline and is capable of single cycle execution on most instructions. The CPU also contains a MAC unit in order to better support digital signal processing (DSP) applications.  Memory management  The OR1200 design uses a Harvard memory architecture and therefore has separate memory management units (MMUs) for data and instruction memories. These MMUs each consist of a hash-based 1-way direct-mapped translation lookaside buffer (TLB) with page size of 8KiB and a default size of 64 entries. The TLBs are individually scalable from 16 to 256 entries. There is also a one-way direct-mapped cache each for both the instruction memory and for the data memory. Each cache has a default size of 8KiB, but both are individually scalable between 1 and 64KiB. The MMU includes support for virtual memory.  Performance  The core achieves 1.34 CoreMarks per MHz at 50 MHz on Xilinx FPGA technology.http://opencores.org/or1k/OR1200_OpenRISC_Processor#Implementation_information Under the worst case, the clock frequency for the OR1200 is 250 MHz at a 0.18 Œºm 6LM fabrication process. Using the Dhrystone benchmark, a 250 MHz OR1200 processor performs 250 Dhrystone millions of instructions per second (DMIPS) in the worst case. Estimated power usage of a 250 MHz processor at a 0.18 Œºm process is less than 1 W at full throttle and less than 5 mW at half throttle.  Applications  Generally, the OR1200 is intended to be used in a variety of embedded applications, including telecommunications, portable media, home entertainment, and automotive applications. The GNU toolchain (including GCC) has also been successfully ported to the architecture, although it is not bug- free.http://opencores.org/or1k/UClibc_tool_chain_test_results There is a port of the Linux kernel for OR1K which runs on the OR1200. Recent ports of the embedded C libraries newlib and uClibc are also available for the platform.  Implementations  The OR1200 has been successfully implemented using FPGA and ASIC technologies.

It is said to be one of the remotest areas in the contiguous United States. Description The canyon begins in southwestern Uintah County and then meanders roughly south along (and becomes) the county line between Uintah and Carbon counties (including the entire eastern border of Carbon County). Continuing its southerly meander, it then becomes the county line between Emery and Grand counties, until it reaches its mouth in the Roan Cliffs. (The Green River continues flowing south through Gray Canyon.) Desolation Canyon is situated between the West Tavaputs Plateau on the west and the East Tavaputs Plateau on the east. At its deepest point, a relief of over exists from river level to the unseen rim of the Tavaputs Plateau. History Over the last few thousand years, different groups of humans have occupied the area and left their traces behind. Fremont and Ute pictographs and petroglyphs are abundant in Desolation Canyon and its numerous tributary canyons, such as Nine Mile and Range Creek. Fremont granaries, as well as several abandoned homesteaders' ranches, testify to the agricultural potential of riparian alluvial fans, which are larger in Desolation Canyon than in any other canyon of the Colorado - Green river system. The canyon was traversed by John Wesley Powell in 1869 as part of an expedition that was sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution. Originally homesteaded by the Seamount family in 1914, Rock Creek Ranch is still used as a horse pasture by the ranches' contemporary owners, which makes it the last property in the canyon still commercially in use. Desolation Canyon was added to the NRHP and declared a National Historic Landmark in 1968 as part of the centennial celebration of the Powell expedition. Recreation BLM photograph of a boat on the Green River within Desolation Canyon Each year during the spring, summer, and fall months, many boaters make the trip through Desolation and Gray canyons from Sand Wash to Swasey's Rapid, just upstream of the city of Green River. This section is managed by the Price office of the Bureau of Land Management, which issues permits. An additional permit must be obtained to camp or hike on the eastern side of the river, which is part of the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation for most of the canyon's length. As of spring 2015, the Utes are no longer offering permits to non-tribal members. Over 60 named class two and three rapids challenge boaters, and the gradual increase in size and difficulty of rapids make it an ideal place for beginner to intermediate boaters to develop their skills. At high water (over ), Joe Hutch Canyon Rapid (Cow Swim) approaches a class IV difficulty. Rapids in the canyon are big enough to swamp an open canoe at any water level.

Here, the residents have adapted to white society while retaining traditional links to the land through fishing, trapping and hunting. The show details the spiritual kinship between Spirit Bay families, nature, and modern life on the reserve from a young person's viewpoint. Being the first true aboriginal television series, it set the stage for all other native Canadian programming thereafter (such as The Rez, North of 60 and Moccasin Flats), and paved the way for many famous First Nations, Canadian actors.

It is set against the backdrop of a workers' strike in 1955 Nantes. Like Demy's most famous film, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, it is an operetta-musical in which every line of dialogue is sung. But unlike Cherbourg, it is closer to tragedy, with a darker, more explicitly political tone. The film won the Prix M√©li√®s, and was nominated for nine C√©sar Awards: Best Film, Best Director, Most Promising Actress, Best Supporting Actor, Best Supporting Actress, Best Cinematography, Best Music, Best Production Design and Best Sound. Plot The story is set during a workers' strike in Nantes in 1955. Young shipyard worker Fran√ßois Guilbaud is one of the strikers, and he rents a room from Madame Langlois, a widow who sympathizes with the strikers although she is herself upper-class, born a baroness. His girlfriend Violette Pelletier, who works in a shop and lives with her mother, wants to get married but he is unwilling, partly because they have no money and nowhere to live. In the street Fran√ßois is accosted by a beautiful woman wearing only a fur coat. This is √âdith Leroyer, unhappily married to the owner of a television shop, who has taken to part- time prostitution. The two have a blissful night together in a cheap hotel and fall in love. In the morning Violette comes looking for Fran√ßois because she has learned she is pregnant, but he tells her he loves another woman. Meanwhile, √âdith, going back to her husband's shop to collect some things and leave him, has a terrible row with him during which he cuts his throat. She flees back to her mother, who is Fran√ßois' landlady. Next morning, Fran√ßois joins a demonstration which is broken up by the police and is fatally injured. His workmates carry him up to the flat of the baroness, where he dies in the arms of √âdith. Unable to live without him, she shoots herself.

She gained notoriety for her bizarre 10-year affair with Otto Sanhuber (aka: Otto Weir, Walter Klein), which culminated in the shooting death of her husband. The story inspired the feature film The Bliss of Mrs. Blossom as well as two made-for-TV movies: The Man in the Attic, with Neil Patrick Harris, and \\"Lover in the Attic\\", with Molly Burnett. Oesterreich was also the subject of Investigation Discovery's series A Crime to Remember in 2017 (Season 4, Episode 6, \\"Guess Who?\\"). Dolly Oesterreich, 33 at the time, first became friendly with 17-year-old Otto Sanhuber around 1913 and described him as her \\"vagabond half-brother.\\" The two quickly became lovers and met clandestinely at Sanhuber's boarding room or at a nearby hotel. They also arranged trysts at Dolly's home but, when neighbors began noting Otto's increasingly frequent comings and goings, and alerted her husband, Dolly suggested to Otto that he quit his job and secretly move into the Oesterreichs' upstairs attic to allay any further suspicions. He readily agreed to the arrangement. Not only would this put him in closer proximity to his lover but it would also give him time to pursue his dream of writing pulp fiction stories. Sanhuber would later describe himself as having been enslaved by Dolly. Dolly's husband Fred remained unaware of the new \\"boarder\\", though on several occasions he came close to discovering the deception. When the Oesterreichs moved to Los Angeles in 1918, Dolly had already sent Sanhuber to await their arrival. Dolly deliberately chose a new house with an attic (somewhat of a rarity in Los Angeles), and once again Otto moved in to resume their affair. On August 22, 1922, after overhearing a loud argument between the Oesterreichs and believing Dolly to be in danger of physical harm, Sanhuber rushed from the attic, with .25 caliber pistols in hand. In the ensuing struggle, Sanhuber shot Fred Oesterreich three times, killing him. The two lovers then hastily staged the scene to look like a botched burglary. Sanhuber pocketed Fred's diamond watch while Dolly hid herself in a closet. Sanhuber had locked the closet door from the outside and tossed the key aside before returning to his attic refuge, and this fact played a key role in frustrating police efforts to press murder charges against Dolly despite their strong suspicions. With no knowledge of Otto Sanhuber's long-time presence in the house, they were hard-pressed to explain how Dolly could have killed her husband while locked in a closet. Sanhuber remained at large for eight years, eventually moving to Canada, changing his name to Walter Klein and marrying another woman before returning to Los Angeles. In 1930, after a falling out, Dolly's personal attorney (and current lover) Herman Shapiro revealed to police what he knew about Otto Sanhuber's involvement in the murder. Sanhuber was arrested and convicted of manslaughter but later released because the statute of limitations had expired. Dolly was arrested but her trial ended in a hung jury (most of the jurors leaning towards acquittal), and in 1936 the indictment against her was finally dropped. She remained in Los Angeles until her death in 1961.

High salt marsh dieback, or salt marsh browning, is the primary force in salt marsh degradation in the high marsh. The general effect is that the plants in the marsh die off and brown, leaving dead organic matter, and ultimately open sediment. Without strong plant roots holding the sediment, these open areas of land erode, causing the salt marsh to retreat back to the mainland.Webb E.C., Mendelssohn I.A., Wilsey B.J. (1995) \\"Causes for vegetation dieback in a Louisiana salt marsh: a bioassay approach\\". Aquatic Botany 51: 281‚Äì289 Dieback zones lack their main producers, such as the salt marsh cord grass, or Spartina alterniflora, and ultimately become completely unproductive.Bertness M, Silliman B.R., Jefferies R. (2004) \\"Salt marshes under siege\\". American Scientist 92(1): 54  Overview of hypotheses  Scientists have studied salt marsh dieback for decades, and they still argue about its causes. One of the main ideas suggests that salt marsh dieback is caused by waterlogging in S. alterniflora from increased submersion within the tides, increased sediment, and oxygen deficiency.Goodman P.J, Williams W.T. (1961) \\"Investigations into 'die-back' in Spartina townsendii agg.\\" Journal of Ecology 49(2): 391‚Äì398 Other scientists have researched the possibility of increased soil salinity and decreased soil water as the causes for dieback.Brown C.E., Pezeshki S.R. (2007) \\"Threshold for recovery in the marsh halophyte Spartina alterniflora grown under the combined effects of salinity and soil drying\\". Journal of Plant Physiology 164: 274‚Äì282 = Importance of salt marshes = Salt marshes are important in preserving the brooding and nursery habitats of shellfish, fish, and insects.  Waterlogging hypothesis  Waterlogging is the result of too much water in a plant's root system and the surrounding soil, and usually occurs in the inland areas of the marsh. With the increase of surface water, waterlogged soils contain many reduced molecules, which can induce the accumulation of sulfide and other toxic compounds.Mendelssohn I.A., McKee K.L. (1988) \\"Spartina alterniflora die-back in Louisiana: Time-course investigation of soil waterlogging effects\\". Journal of Ecology 76: 509‚Äì521 Current studies suggest that increased waterlogging is caused by sea level rise, a possible effect of global warming, which has many natural and anthropologic causes of its own.Mendelssohn I.A., Kuhn N.L. (2003) \\"Sediment subsidy: effects on soil- plant responses in a rapidly submerging coastal salt marsh\\". Ecological Engineering 21: 115‚Äì128 = Reduced aerobic respiration = Salt marsh dieback results in the death of marsh-specific plants and the erosion of the landscape. One of the causes of waterlogging is the reduced aerobic respiration by the roots of S. alterniflora. It occurs mainly in the inland zones, though the streamside plants show partial anaerobic respiration. Aerobic respiration takes sugars and oxygen to create carbon dioxide, water, and energy. As aerobic respiration decreases, the plants become oxygen deficient, since the roots are unable to produce enough oxygen in the reduced soil conditions. Decreased oxygen uptake can also decrease plant productivity.Mendelssohn I.A., McKee K.L., Patrick, W.H. (1981) \\"Oxygen deficiency in Spartina alterniflora roots: Metabolic adaptation to anoxia\\". Science 214: 439‚Äì441 To gain energy, these plants then go through a process of alcoholic fermentation (Mendelssohn et al. 1981). This fermentation process has an end product of carbon in the form of ethanol, which is diffused from the roots. Therefore, the plants are unable to use the diffused carbon, so the available plant energy decreases. = Increased soil sulfide = Another product of waterlogging is the increase of sulfide in soil. The increase of sulfide is caused by anaerobic and aerobic bacteria, which are mainly seen in reduced soils. Increased sulfide has been shown to inhibit NH4-N (ammoniacal nitrogen, an ammonium salt) uptake within the plant. NH4-N is the most available form of nitrogen within the soil and it is a limiting nutrient in S. alterniflora productivity. A higher concentration of NH4-N in the soil may show that the plant's uptake of NH4-N has decreased, leaving excess molecules in the soil. In addition, reduced soils can cause plant nitrification to decrease, leading to a greater lack of NH4-N uptake. = Possible solutions = Some scientists have found solutions to this problem. Mendelssohn and Kuhn set up an experiment with plants and soils in a Louisiana salt marsh in 2003. They found that when sediment deposits are increased within an unhealthy salt marsh area, the plants and soils are in better conditions. The experiment showed that the plants with the greater sediment levels had more plant cover, with higher plants and a greater bulk density. The surface elevation increased with the increase of sediment, therefore reducing flooding. The roots could respire aerobically, so they did not have to rely on fermentation for energy. The plants with more sediment also showed a decrease in sulfide and NH4-N concentrations in the soil. Mendelssohn postulates that since the concentration of NH4-N decreased after the addition of sediment, more of the nitrogen was used by the plants.  Salinity hypothesis  A second hypothesis of salt marsh dieback focuses on increased salinity and lack of soil water being the main causes of salt marsh dieback. Some scientists see this hypothesis as relevant, since global warming suggests that increased global temperatures may lead to increased evaporation and transpiration. Brown and Pezeshki devised an experiment in which many S. alterniflora individuals were put under situations of increased salinity, increased water stress, and then a combined treatment. They found that those plants that experienced the combined treatment exhibited an increase in water stress, where plants are unable to get a sufficient amount of water from the soil, a decrease in photosynthetic activity, and ultimately death (Brown & Pezeshki 2007).

Early life Emmanuel was born in Obermais, Meran on 18 January 1872. He was the second child and only son of Ferdinand Philippe d'Orl√©ans, Duke of Alen√ßon and his wife Duchess Sophie Charlotte in Bavaria.de Badts de Cugnac, Chantal. Coutant de Saisseval, Guy. Nouvelle Imprimerie Laballery. Paris. 2002. pp. 474‚Äì476 (French) His mother was the famed duchesse d'Alen√ßon who died in a fire at a charity bazaar in Paris on 4 May 1897. His older sister, Louise d'Orl√©ans, married Prince Alfons of Bavaria. His paternal grandparents were Prince Louis, Duke of Nemours (son of Queen Maria and King Louis Philippe, who was forced to abdicate after the outbreak of the French Revolution of 1848) and Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha (a first cousin of Queen Victoria). His maternal grandparents were Duke Maximilian Joseph in Bavaria and Princess Ludovika of Bavaria. Career The Duke was a Major in the Austro-Hungarian Army, however, he was not allowed to serve in World War I due to an 1886 law barring all princes of the two former sovereign houses of France from being permitted serving their county in the army or navy or hold office in the French government. The Prince, undeterred, volunteered with the French Red Cross, was appointed a principal delegate on the Belgian front and served as a director of the Franco-Belgian Hospital in Calais. In 1926, he led an excavation party that unearthed the village of Roquebilli√®re, in the Alpes-Maritimes department, where several Roman tombs were found containing rare jewels, vases and objects d'art. Personal life On 12 February 1896, he married Princess Henriette of Belgium (1870‚Äì1948) in Brussels. Henriette was a daughter of Prince Philippe, Count of Flanders and Princess Marie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, and the sister of King Albert I of Belgium. Together, they were known as the Sporting Duke and Duchess, and had four children: * Princess Marie-Louise (1896‚Äì1973), who wed Prince Philip of Bourbon-Two Sicilies (1885‚Äì1949) on 15 January 1916. Before their marriage was annulled in 1926, they had children together. * Princess Sophie (1898‚Äì1928), who died unmarried in Lugrin in 1928. In 1921, she was rumored to have been engaged to the Crown Prince and Regent of Serbia. * Princess Genevi√®ve (1901‚Äì1983), who wed Antoine, Marquis de Chaponay (1893-1956) in Neuilly, France on 2 July 1923. Antoine, a widower of Diane de Coss√© Brissac, and Genevi√®ve had children together. * Prince Charles-Philippe (1905‚Äì1970), Duke of Nemours, who wed non-dynastically Marguerite Watson (1899‚Äì1993), daughter of Garrett Fitzgerald Watson of Richmond, Virginia, in Paris on 24 September 1928, without issue. The couple had estates in Belgium, France and Switzerland until after World War I, when their fortune diminished rapidly and they were forced to sell some properties. Philippe died unexpectedly in 1931 from heart failure after catching a cold, in Cannes, France. He is buried in the Chapelle Royale de Saint Louis, in Dreux.

Though the album was originally announced as a 20-track double-CD release, frontman Jack Dangers decided to shorten the album to a single disc with different track listings between the US and European releases. Stylistically, it steps up the pace from other recent Meat Beat Manifesto albums, using elements of dub, hip-hop, industrial, breakbeat and more, and it is regarded as a partial return to the early industrial sound of the band in the late 1980s. The album has also been described as Dangers' take on dubstep, though he has stated that Meat Beat Manifesto has always utilized the underlying concepts of that particular genre. Autoimmune is the first Meat Beat Manifesto album with Danger's vocals since Actual Sounds + Voices in 1998; he appears on the track \\"Solid Waste\\". The album cover continues the checkerboard/grid theme also seen on earlier Meat Beat Manifesto albums Actual Sounds + Voices, RUOK? and the Off-Centre EP.

It stars Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, Brian Geraghty, Christian Camargo, Ralph Fiennes, David Morse, Guy Pearce, J.J. Kandel, and Ryan Tramont. The film follows an Iraq War Explosive Ordnance Disposal team who are targeted by insurgents, and shows their psychological reactions to the stress of combat, which is intolerable to some and addictive to others. Boal drew on his experience during embedded access to write the screenplay. The Hurt Locker premiered at the 2008 Venice International Film Festival before it was released in the United States on June 26, 2009, by Summit Entertainment. The film earned near universal acclaim from critics, who praised Bigelow's directing, Renner's performance, writing, and action sequences. The film was nominated for nine Academy Awards and won six, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Original Screenplay. It remains the only Best Picture winner to have been directed by a woman. The film grossed $49.2 million worldwide. Plot In 2004, Sergeant First Class William James arrives as the new team leader of a U.S. Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) unit in the Iraq War. He replaces Staff Sergeant Matthew Thompson, who was killed by an improvised explosive device (IED) in Baghdad. His team includes Sergeant J. T. Sanborn and Specialist Owen Eldridge. James is often approached by an Iraqi youth nicknamed \\"Beckham\\", attempting to sell DVDs. James challenges him to a game of football and takes a liking to him. Sanborn and Eldridge consider James' maverick disposal methods and attitude reckless, raising tensions. When they are assigned to destroy explosives, James returns to the detonation site to pick up his gloves. Sanborn openly contemplates killing him by \\"accidentally\\" triggering the explosives, making Eldridge uncomfortable. Nothing is done, and tensions continue to increase. Returning to Camp Victory in their Humvee, the team encounters five armed men in traditional Arab garb and casual attire standing near a Ford Excursion, which has a flat tire. James' team has a tense encounter with their leader, who reveals they are private military contractors and British mercenaries. They have captured two prisoners featured on the most-wanted Iraqi playing cards. The group comes under fire; when the prisoners attempt to escape in the confusion, the leader of the mercenaries shoots them, as they are valuable dead or alive. Enemy snipers kill three of the mercenaries, including their leader. Sanborn and James borrow a gun to dispatch three attackers, while Eldridge kills a fourth. During a raid on a warehouse, James discovers a body he believes is Beckham, in which a bomb has been surgically implanted. During the evacuation, Lieutenant Colonel John Cambridge, the camp's psychiatrist and a friend of Eldridge, is killed in an explosion; Eldridge blames himself for his death. James breaks into the house of an Iraqi professor, seeking revenge for Beckham, but his search reveals nothing. Called to a petrol tanker detonation, James decides to hunt for the insurgents responsible, guessing they are still nearby. Sanborn protests, but when James begins a pursuit, he and Eldridge reluctantly follow. After they split up, insurgents capture Eldridge. James and Sanborn rescue him, but one of James' rounds hits Eldridge in the leg. The following morning, James is approached by Beckham, whom James believed was dead, and James walks by silently. Before being airlifted for surgery, Eldridge angrily blames James for his injury. James and Sanborn's unit is called to another mission in their last two days of their rotation. An innocent Iraqi civilian has had a bomb vest strapped to his chest. James tries to cut off the locks to remove the vest, but there are too many of them. He abandons the man who is then killed when the bomb explodes. Sanborn is distraught by the man's death. He confesses to James he can no longer cope with the pressure and wants to return home and have a son. After Bravo Company's rotation ends, James returns to his wife Connie and their infant son, who still lives with him in his house. However, he is bored by routine civilian life. James confesses to his son there is only one thing he knows he loves. He starts another tour of duty, serving with Delta Company, a U.S. Army EOD unit on its 365-day rotation.

The film premiered at the Venice Film Festival in Italy during 2008. After being shown at the Toronto International Film Festival, it was picked up for distribution in the United States by Summit Entertainment. In May 2009, it was the Closing Night selection for Maryland Film Festival. The film was released in the United States on June 26, 2009 but received a more widespread theatrical release on July 24, 2009. Since the film was not released in the United States until 2009, it was eligible for the Academy Awards only the following year, where it was nominated for nine Academy Awards. Although the film had not recovered its budget by the time of the ceremony, it won six Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director for Bigelow (the first woman to win this award), and Best Original Screenplay for Boal. =Writing= The Hurt Locker is based on accounts of Mark Boal, a freelance journalist who was embedded with an American bomb squad in the war in Iraq for two weeks in 2004.Goodwin, Christopher (August 16, 2009). \\"Kathryn Bigelow is back with The Hurt Locker,\\" The Sunday Times. The director Kathryn Bigelow was familiar with Boal's work before his experiences, having adapted one of his Playboy articles as the short-lived television series The Inside in 2002. When Boal was embedded with the squad, he accompanied its members 10 to 15 times a day to watch their tasks, and kept in touch with Bigelow via email about his experiences.Keogh, Tom (July 8, 2009). \\"Hurt Locker goes for 'you-are-there' effect in war story,\\" The Seattle Times. Boal used his experiences as the basis of a fictional drama based on real events. He said of the film's goal, \\"The idea is that it's the first movie about the Iraq War that purports to show the experience of the soldiers. We wanted to show the kinds of things that soldiers go through that you can't see on CNN, and I don't mean that in a censorship-conspiracy way. I just mean the news doesn't actually put photographers in with units that are this elite.\\" Bigelow was fascinated with exploring \\"the psychology behind the type of soldier who volunteers for this particular conflict and then, because of [their] aptitude, is chosen and given the opportunity to go into bomb disarmament and goes toward what everybody else is running from.\\"Dawson, Nick (2009). \\"Time's Up: Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker,\\" The Times While working with Boal in 2005 on the script, originally titled The Something Jacket, Bigelow began to do some preliminary, rough storyboards to get an idea of the specific location needed. Bomb disarmament protocol requires a containment area. She wanted to make the film as authentic as possible and \\"put the audience into the Humvee, into a boots- on-the-ground experience.\\" =Casting= For the main characters, Bigelow made a point of casting relatively unknown actors: \\"it underscored the tension because with the lack of familiarity also comes a sense of unpredictability.\\" Renner's character, Sergeant First Class William James, is a composite character, with qualities based on individuals whom screenwriter Boal knew when embedded with the bomb squad. Bigelow cast Renner based on his work in Dahmer, a film about Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious serial killer whose victims were boys.Ayres, Chris (March 6, 2010). \\"The Hurt Lockers Jeremy Renner on his long road to the Oscars,\\" The Times To prepare for the film, Renner spent a week living and training at Fort Irwin, a U.S. military reservation in the Mojave Desert in California.

Describing the experience of filming in Jordan in the summer, he said, \\"It was so desperately hot, and we were so easily agitated. But that movie was like doing a play. We really looked out for each other, and it was a great experience. It made me believe in film.\\"Stewart, Sara (August 24, 2009). \\"Mackie's back in town\\", New York Post. Several hundred thousand refugees of Iraq live in Jordan. Bigelow cast refugees who had theatrical backgrounds, such as Suhail Aldabbach. He plays the innocent man used as a suicide bomber at the film's end. =Filming= The film was shot in Jordan, within miles of the Iraqi border, to achieve Bigelow's goal of authenticity. Iraqi refugees were used for extras and the cast worked in the intense heat of the Middle East. The filmmakers had scouted for locations in Morocco, but director Kathryn Bigelow felt its cities did not resemble Baghdad. In addition, she wanted to get as close to the war zone as possible. Some of the locations were less than three miles from the Iraq border. She had wanted to film in Iraq, but the production security team could not guarantee their safety from snipers. Principal photography began in July 2007 in Jordan and Kuwait. Temperatures averaged over the 44 days of shooting. Often four or more camera crews filmed simultaneously, which resulted in nearly 200 hours of footage.Olsen, Mark (September 8, 2008). \\"'Hurt Locker' a soldier's-eye view of the Iraq war\\".

The producer Greg Shapiro spoke about security concerns of filming in Jordan, \\"It was interesting telling people we were going to make the movie in Jordan because the first question everybody asked was about the security situation here.\\" Her choice to film in the Kingdom met some resistance. In discussion, Bigelow found that her cast and crew shared stereotypes of the region from American culture. \\"Sadly people in America and Los Angeles have these perceptions\\", she said. \\"But once you get off the plane you realise it's like Manhattan without the trees\\", she continued. As Iraq dominated discourse in America and across the world, Bigelow believed that filmmakers would continue to explore the conflict, making Jordan the natural place to film.

In a scene in which his character carries a dead Iraqi boy, Renner fell down some stairs and twisted his ankle, which delayed filming because he could not walk. At that point, \\"people wanted to quit. All the departments were struggling to get their job done, none of them were communicating\\". A week later, filming resumed. The producer Tony Mark recalled the armorer David Fencl's finishing a 12-hour day. He found he had to stay up all night to make proper ammunition for a sniper rifle, as the supplies did not clear Jordanian customs in time for the scheduled shoot. Due to import restrictions on military props, the film's special effects artist Richard Stutsman used Chinese fireworks for gunpowder. One day, he was assembling a prop, and the heat and friction caused the fireworks to blow up in his face. Two days later, he returned to work. The film shoot had few of the normal Hollywood perks; nobody on the set got an air-conditioned trailer or a private bathroom. Renner said that great care was taken to ensure the film's authenticity.Elliot V. Kotek \\"Jeremy Renner ‚Äì The Hurt Locker\\", Movie Pictures Magazine. According to Renner, shooting the film in the Middle East contributed to this. \\"There were two-by-fours with nails being dropped from two-story buildings that hit me in the helmet, and they were throwing rocks....

Impressed with cinematographer Barry Ackroyd's work on United 93 and The Wind That Shakes the Barley, Bigelow invited him to work on her film. While the film was independently produced and filmed on a low budget, Bigelow used four Super 16 mm cameras to capture multiple perspectives, saying, > \\"That's how we experience reality, by looking at the microcosm and the > macrocosm simultaneously. The eye sees differently than the lens, but with > multiple focal lengths and a muscular editorial style, the lens can give you > that microcosm/macrocosm perspective, and that contributes to the feeling of > total immersion.\\" In staging the film's action sequences, Bigelow did not want to lose a sense of the geography and used multiple cameras to allow her to \\"look at any particular set piece from every possible perspective.\\" =Editing= The Hurt Locker was edited by Chris Innis and Bob Murawski.\\"Artful Editing and All-Avid Workflow Propel The Hurt Locker,\\" Avid.com The two editors worked with almost 200 hours of footage from the multiple hand-held cameras in use during the shoot. Adding to the challenge, Boal's screenplay had a non-traditional, asymmetrical, episodic structure. There was no traditional \\"villain\\", and tension was derived from the characters' internal conflicts and the suspense from the explosives and snipers. > \\"This movie is kind of like a horror film where you're unable to see the > killer,\\" says Innis. \\"You know a bomb could go off at any minute, but you > never know just when it's going to happen, so the ideas of [Alfred] > Hitchcock‚Äîabout making your audience anxious‚Äîwere influential for us when we > did the editing.\\"Karen Idelson, \\"Editors Get in Rhythm\\", Variety, 12 January > 2010 The raw footage was described as a \\"hodge-podge of disconnected, nausea- inducing motion that was constantly crossing the 180-degree line\\". Innis spent the first eight weeks editing the film on location in Jordan, before returning to Los Angeles, where she was joined by Murawski. The process took over eight months to complete.Guy Lodge, \\"The Crafts of 'The Hurt Locker'\\", In Contention, January 7, 2010 The goal was to edit a brutally realistic portrayal of the realities of war, using minimal special effects or technical enhancement. Innis stated that they \\"really wanted the film to retain that 'newsreel' documentary quality... Too many stage-y effects would have been distracting. The editing in this film was all about restraint\\". Editing on location led to additional complications in post-production. The production was unwilling to risk sending undeveloped film through high-security airports where the cans could be opened, X-rayed, or damaged. Accordingly, film was hand-carried on a flight by a production assistant from Amman to London. After the Super 16mm film was transferred to DVcam at a lab in London, the video dailies were transported by plane back to the Middle East to be imported into the editing system. The whole journey would take anywhere from three days to a week and was described by Innis as the \\"modern-day equivalent of shipping via donkey cart\\". The low production budget and the lack of a developed film infrastructure in the area hampered the process, according to Innis. \\"We were working with grainy Super 16mm film, editing in standard definition. We tried doing FTP downloads, but at the time the facilities in Jordan simply couldn't handle it.\\" The producer Tony Mark later negotiated the use of a local radio station late at night to receive low-grade QuickTime clips over the Internet so the crew would not be shooting blindly. Release =Festival screenings= The Hurt Locker had its world premiere at the Venice International Film Festival on September 4, 2008, and the film received a 10-minute standing ovation at the end of its screening. At the festival, the film won the SIGNIS award, the Arca Cinemagiovani Award (Arca Young Cinema Award) for \\"Best Film Venezia 65\\" (chosen by an international youth jury); the Human Rights Film Network Award; and the Venezia Cinema Award known as the \\"Navicella\\". The film also screened at the 33rd Annual Toronto International Film Festival on September 8, where it generated \\"keen interest\\", though distributors were reluctant to buy it since previous films about the Iraq War performed poorly at the box office. Summit Entertainment purchased the film for distribution in the United States in what was perceived as \\"a skittish climate for pic sales\\". In the rest of 2008, The Hurt Locker screened at the 3rd Zurich Film Festival, the 37th Festival du Nouveau Cin√©ma, the 21st Mar del Plata Film Festival, the 5th Dubai International Film Festival, and the 12th Tallinn Black Nights Film Festival. In 2009, The Hurt Locker screened at the G√∂teborg International Film Festival, the 10th Film Comment Selects festival,Scott, A. O.

It was the closing night film at Maryland Film Festival 2009, with Bigelow presenting. It had a centerpiece screening at the 3rd AFI Dallas International Film Festival, where director Kathryn Bigelow received the Dallas Star Award. Other 2009 festivals included the Human Rights Nights International Film Festival, the Seattle International Film Festival, and the Philadelphia Film Festival. =Theatrical run= The Hurt Locker was first publicly released in Italy by Warner Bros. on October 10, 2008. Summit Entertainment picked the film up for distribution in the United States for $1.5 million after it was shown at the Toronto International Film Festival. The Hurt Locker was released in the United States on June 26, 2009, with a limited release at four theaters in Los Angeles and New York City. Over its first weekend the film grossed $145,352, averaging $36,338 per theater. The following weekend, beginning July 3, the film grossed $131,202 at nine theaters, averaging $14,578 per theater. It held the highest per-screen average of any film playing theatrically in the United States for the first two weeks of its release, gradually moving into the top 20 chart with much wider-released, bigger budget studio films. It held around number 13 or number 14 on box office charts for an additional four weeks. Summit Entertainment took The Hurt Locker wider to more than 200 screens on July 24, 2009 and more than 500 screens on July 31, 2009. The film's final gross was $17,017,811 in the United States and Canada, and $32,212,961 in other countries, bringing its worldwide total to $49,230,772. It was a success against its budget of $15 million. According to the Los Angeles Times, The Hurt Locker performed better than most recent dramas about Middle East conflict. The film outperformed all other Iraq-war-themed films such as In the Valley of Elah (2007), Stop-Loss (2008) and Afghanistan-themed Lions for Lambs (2007). In the United States, The Hurt Locker is one of only five Best Picture winners (The English Patient, Amadeus, The Artist, and The Shape of Water being the other four) to never enter the weekend box office top 5 since top 10 rankings were first recorded in 1982. It is also one of the only two Best Picture winners on record never to have entered the weekend box office top 10 (The Artist being the other). The Hurt Locker opened in the top ten in the United Kingdom in 103 theaters, scoring the fourth-highest per-screen average of $3,607, ranking between G-Force and G.I. Joe in overall grosses. The film garnered half a million dollars in its opening weekend in the United Kingdom of August 28 through August 30, 2009, and grossed over a million dollars in the UK, Japan, Spain, and France through March. =Distribution: Independent film print shortage= According to an article in the Springfield, Illinois State Journal-Register, as of August 2009 there was a shortage of film prints of The Hurt Locker, as well as other hit independent films such as Food, Inc. Distributors told theater owners that they would have to wait weeks or months past the initial U.S. release date to get the few available prints that were already in distribution. \\"Sometimes the distributors goof up,\\" said a film buyer for one theater. \\"They misjudge how wide they should go.\\" One theory is that the independent films have a hard time competing for screen space during the summer against blockbuster tent-pole films that take up as much as half the screens in any given city, flooding the United States market with thousands of prints. Theater owners have also complained about distributors \\"bunching too many movies too close together\\". It is also thought that independent film distributors are trying to cut their losses on prints by recycling them. Given the popularity of some of the films that are \\"hard to come by\\", this strategy may be leaving box office money on the table. =Home media= The Hurt Locker was released on DVD and Blu-ray in North America on January 12, 2010. This disc includes an added audio commentary featuring director Kathryn Bigelow, writer Mark Boal, and other members of the production crew; an image gallery of photos from shooting; and a 15-minute EPK featurette highlighting the filming experience in Jordan and the film's production. The UK DVD and Blu-ray has no commentary. U.S. sales of the DVD topped $30 million by mid-August 2010. Reception =Critical response= The Hurt Locker received widespread acclaim, with Renner's performance receiving praise from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 97%, based on 285 reviews, with a weighted average rating of 8.51/10. It was the second highest- rated film of 2009, behind Pixar's Up. The critics' consensus reads, \\"A well- acted, intensely shot, action filled war epic, Kathryn Bigelow's The Hurt Locker is thus far the best of the recent dramatizations of the Iraq War.\\" Metacritic, which assigns a normalized score, gave the film an average score of 95 out of 100, based on 37 critics, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Roger Ebert of The Chicago Sun Times rated the film as the best of 2009, writing, \\"The Hurt Locker is a great film, an intelligent film, a film shot clearly so that we know exactly who everybody is and where they are and what they're doing and why.\\" He applauded how the suspense was built, calling the film \\"spellbinding\\". Ebert considered Renner \\"a leading contender for Academy Awards\\", writing, \\"His performance is not built on complex speeches but on a visceral projection of who this man is and what he feels. He is not a hero in a conventional sense.\\" He eventually ranked it the second-best film of the decade, behind only Synecdoche, New York. Richard Corliss of Time magazine also spoke highly of Renner's performance, calling it a highlight of the film. Corliss wrote, > \\"He's ordinary, pudgy-faced, quiet, and at first seems to lack the screen > charisma to carry a film. That supposition vanishes in a few minutes, as > Renner slowly reveals the strength, confidence and unpredictability of a > young Russell Crowe. The merging of actor and character is one of the big > things to love about this movie ... It's a creepy marvel to watch James in > action. He has the cool aplomb, analytical acumen and attention to detail of > a great athlete, or a master psychopath, maybe both.\\" Corliss praised the film's \\"steely calm\\" tone, reflective of its main character. Corliss summarized, \\"The Hurt Locker is a near-perfect movie about men in war, men at work. Through sturdy imagery and violent action, it says that even Hell needs heroes.\\" A. O. Scott of The New York Times called The Hurt Locker the best American feature film yet made about the war in Iraq: > \\"You may emerge from The Hurt Locker shaken, exhilarated and drained, but > you will also be thinking ... The movie is a viscerally exciting, > adrenaline-soaked tour de force of suspense and surprise, full of explosions > and hectic scenes of combat, but it blows a hole in the condescending > assumption that such effects are just empty spectacle or mindless noise.\\" Scott noticed that the film reserved criticism of the war but wrote of how the director handled the film's limits, \\"Ms. Bigelow, practicing a kind of hyperbolic realism, distills the psychological essence and moral complications of modern warfare into a series of brilliant, agonizing set pieces.\\" He also applauded the convergence of the characters in the film, saying that it \\"focuses on three men whose contrasting temperaments knit this episodic exploration of peril and bravery into a coherent and satisfying story.\\" Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote that the performances of Renner, Mackie, and Geraghty would raise their profiles considerably, and said their characters reveal their \\"unlooked-for aspects\\", such as Renner's character being playful with an Iraqi boy. Turan applauded Boal's \\"lean and compelling\\" script and said of Bigelow's direction, \\"Bigelow and her team bring an awesome ferocity to re-creating the unhinged mania of bomb removal in an alien, culturally unfathomable atmosphere.\\" Guy Westwell of Sight & Sound wrote that the cinematographer Barry Ackroyd provided \\"sharp handheld coverage\\" and that Paul N.J. Ottosson's sound design \\"uses the barely perceptible ringing of tinnitus to amp up the tension.\\" Westwell praised the director's skill: > \\"The careful mapping of the subtle differences between each bomb, the play > with point of view ... and the attenuation of key action sequences ... lends > the film a distinctive quality that can only be attributed to Bigelow's > clever, confident direction.\\" The critic noted the film's different take on the Iraq War, writing that \\"it confronts the fact that men often take great pleasure in war.\\" He concluded, > \\"This unapologetic celebration of a testosterone-fuelled lust for war may > gall. Yet there is something original and distinctive about the film's > willingness to admit that for some men (and many moviegoers) war carries an > intrinsic dramatic charge.\\" Amy Taubin of Film Comment described The Hurt Locker as \\"a structuralist war movie\\" and \\"a totally immersive, off-the-charts high-anxiety experience from beginning to end.\\" Taubin praised Ackroyd's \\"brilliant\\" cinematography with multiple viewpoints. She said of the film's editing, \\"Bob Murawski and Chris Innis's editing is similarly quick and nervous; the rapid changes in POV as they cut from one camera's coverage to another's makes you feel as if you, like the characters, are under threat from all sides.\\" Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal called it \\"A first-rate action thriller, a vivid evocation of urban warfare in Iraq, a penetrating study of heroism and a showcase for austere technique, terse writing and a trio of brilliant performances.\\" The Toronto Star critic Peter Howell said, \\"Just when you think the battle of Iraq war dramas has been fought and lost, along comes one that demands to be seen... If you can sit through The Hurt Locker without your heart nearly pounding through your chest, you must be made of granite.\\" Entertainment Weekly's film critic Lisa Schwarzbaum gave the film the rare \\"A\\" rating, calling it, \\"an intense, action-driven war pic, a muscular, efficient standout that simultaneously conveys the feeling of combat from within as well as what it looks like on the ground. This ain't no war videogame.\\" Derek Elley of Variety found The Hurt Locker to be \\"gripping\\" as a thriller but felt that the film was weakened by, \\"its fuzzy (and hardly original) psychology.\\" Elley wrote that it was unclear to know where the drama lay: \\"These guys get by on old-fashioned guts and instinct rather than sissy hardware‚Äîbut it's not a pure men-under-stress drama either.\\" The critic also felt that the script showed \\"signs of artificially straining for character depth.\\" Anne Thompson, also writing for Variety, believed The Hurt Locker to be a contender for Best Picture, particularly based on the unique subject matter pursued by a female director and on being an exception to other films about the Iraq War, which had performed poorly. Tara McKelvey from The American Prospect wrote that the film is pro-U.S. Army propaganda, although it suggests it is anti-war with the opening statement: \\"War is a drug.\\" She continues, > \\"You feel empathy for the soldiers when they shoot. And in this way, the > full impact of the Iraq war‚Äîat least as it was fought in 2004‚Äîbecomes clear: > American soldiers shot at Iraqi civilians even when, for example, they just > happened to be holding a cell phone and standing near an IED.\\" She > concludes, \\"For all the graphic violence, bloody explosions and, literally, > human butchery that is shown in the film, The Hurt Locker is one of the most > effective recruiting vehicles for the U.S. Army that I have seen.\\" John Pilger, journalist and documentarian, criticized the film in the New Statesman, writing that it \\"offers a vicarious thrill via yet another standard-issue psychopath high on violence in somebody else's country where the deaths of a million people are consigned to cinematic oblivion.\\" In 2010, the Independent Film & Television Alliance selected the film as one of the 30 Most Significant Independent Films of the last 30 years. The Hurt Locker was named the tenth \\"Best Film of the 21st Century So Far\\" in 2017 by The New York Times chief film critics A. O. Scott and Manohla Dargis. =Top ten lists= The Hurt Locker was listed on many critics' top ten lists. * 1st ‚Äì David Ansen, Newsweek * 1st ‚Äì J.

Writing for The Huffington Post, Iraq veteran Kate Hoit said that The Hurt Locker is \\"Hollywood's version of the Iraq war and of the soldiers who fight it, and their version is inaccurate.\\" She described the film as being more accurate than other recently released war films, but expressed concerns that a number of errors‚Äîamong them wrong uniforms, lack of radio communication or misbehavior of the soldiers‚Äîwould prevent service members from enjoying the film. Author Brandon Friedman, also a combat veteran of Iraq and Afghanistan, shared a similar view at VetVoice: \\"The Hurt Locker is a high-tension, well-made, action movie that will certainly keep most viewers on the edges of their seats. But if you know anything about the Army, or about operations or life in Iraq, you'll be so distracted by the nonsensical sequences and plot twists that it will ruin the movie for you. It certainly did for me.\\" Friedman criticized the inaccuracy of the film's representation of combat, saying \\"in real life, EOD techs don't conduct dangerous missions as autonomous three-man teams without communications gear ... Another thing you'll rarely hear in combat is an EOD E-7 suggesting to two or three of his guys that they leave the scene of an explosion in an Iraqi city by saying: 'C'mon, let's split up. We can cover more ground that way. At the blog Army of Dude, infantryman and Iraq veteran Alex Horton noted that \\"the way the team goes about their missions is completely absurd.\\" He still generally enjoyed it and called it \\"the best Iraq movie to date.\\" Troy Steward, another combat veteran, wrote on the blog Bouhammer that while the film accurately depicted the scale of bomb violence and the relations between Iraqis and troops, \\"just about everything else wasn't realistic.\\" Steward went on to say: \\"I was amazed that a movie so bad could get any kind of accolades from anyone.\\" A review published March 8, 2010 in the Air Force Times cited overall negative reviews from bomb experts in Iraq attached to the 4th Brigade, 1st Armored Division, quoting a bomb disposal team leader who called the film's portrayal of a bomb expert \\"grossly exaggerated and not appropriate,\\" and describing the lead character as \\"more of a run and gun cowboy type ‚Ä¶ exactly the kind of person that we're not looking for.\\" Another bomb disposal team member said that the lead character's \\"swagger would put a whole team at risk. Our team leaders don't have that kind of invincibility complex, and if they do, they aren't allowed to operate. A team leader's first priority is getting his team home in one piece.\\" On the embedded side, former correspondent for The Politico and Military Times Christian Lowe (who embedded with U.S. military units each year from 2002 to 2005) explained at DefenseTech: \\"Some of the scenes are so disconnected with reality to be almost parody.\\" Former British bomb disposal officer Guy Marot said, \\"James makes us look like hot-headed, irrational adrenaline junkies with no self-discipline. It‚Äôs immensely disrespectful to the many officers who have lost their lives.\\" On the other hand, Henry Engelhardt, an adjutant with the National Explosive Ordnance Disposal Association having twenty years' experience in bomb defusal, complimented the film's atmosphere and depiction of the difficulties of the job, saying, \\"Of course, no film is realistic in all its details, but the important things were done very well.\\" Lawsuits =Sarver lawsuit= In early March 2010, U.S. Army bomb disposal expert Master Sergeant Jeffrey Sarver filed a multimillion- dollar lawsuit against The Hurt Locker. Sarver's lawsuit claimed he used the term \\"hurt locker\\" and the phrase \\"war is a drug\\" around Boal, that his likeness was used to create the character William James, and that the portrayal of James defames Sarver. Sarver said he felt \\"just a little bit hurt, a little bit felt left out\\" and cheated out of \\"financial participation\\" in the film. Sarver claimed he originated the title of the film; however, according to the film's website, the title is a decades-old colloquialism for being injured, as in \\"they sent him to the hurt locker.\\" It dates back to the Vietnam War where it was one of several phrases meaning \\"in trouble or at a disadvantage; in bad shape.\\" Boal defended himself to the press, saying \\"the film is a work of fiction inspired by many people's stories.\\" He said he talked to more than 100 soldiers during his research. Jody Simon, a Los Angeles-based entertainment lawyer, noted that \\"soldiers don't have privacy\\", and that when the military embedded Boal they gave him full permission to use his observations as he saw fit. Summit Entertainment, the producers of the film, said in early March that they hoped for a quick resolution to the suit. In the December 8, 2011, issue of The Hollywood Reporter, it was announced that Master Sergeant Sarver's lawsuit was thrown out by the court, and a federal judge ordered him to pay more than $180,000 in attorney fees.Belloni, Matthew (December 8, 2011) \\"Iraq War Vet Ordered to Pay $187,000 in Failed Lawsuit Against 'Hurt Locker' Producers\\", The Hollywood Reporter =Copyright infringement lawsuit= On May 12, 2010, Voltage Pictures, the production company behind The Hurt Locker, announced that it would attempt to sue \\"potentially tens of thousands\\" of online computer users who downloaded unlicensed copies of the film using the BitTorrent and P2P networks. It would be the largest lawsuit of its kind. On May 28, 2010, it filed a complaint against 5,000 unidentified BitTorrent users in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia; Voltage announced its intention to demand $1,500 from each defendant to release him or her from the suit. Several people, however, have refused to settle with the studio.Sandoval, Greg. \\"Accused pirates to indie filmmakers: Sue us\\" Cnet News. The US Copyright Group (USCG) has since dropped all cases against the alleged Hurt Locker downloaders. On August 29, 2011, the Federal Court of Canada ordered three Canadian ISPs‚ÄîBell Canada, Cogeco, and Vid√©otron‚Äîto disclose the names and addresses of the subscribers whose IP addresses were suspected to have downloaded a copy of the film. The ISPs were given two weeks to comply with the order. Awards and accolades Starting with its initial screening at the 2008 Venice International Film Festival, The Hurt Locker has earned many awards and honors. It also ranked on more film critics' top 10 lists than any other film of 2009. It was nominated in nine categories at the 82nd Academy Awards and won in six: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Film Editing. It lost the award for Best Actor to Crazy Heart, Best Original Score to Up, and Best Cinematography to Avatar. Bigelow became the first and, to date, only woman to win an Oscar for Best Director. Kathryn Bigelow was awarded the Directors Guild of America Award for Outstanding Achievement in Feature Film for the film, the first and, to date, only time a female director has ever won. The film won six awards at the BAFTAs held on February 21, 2010, including Best Film and Best Director for Bigelow. The Hurt Locker was nominated for three Golden Globe Awards. The Washington D.C. Area Film Critics Association Award for Best Director was given to Kathryn Bigelow, the first time the honor has gone to a woman. The film swept most critics groups awards for Best Director and Best Picture, including Chicago, Boston, and Las Vegas, Los Angeles, New York' film critics group associations. The Hurt Locker is one of only five films that have won all three major U.S. critics group prizes (LA, NY, NSFC), together with Goodfellas, Schindler's List, L.A. Confidential, and The Social Network. The five awards from the Boston Society of Film Critics were the most by that organization to a single film in the group's 30-year history.

It was the second aircraft built in Poland after World War II. Design and development The aircraft was designed by engineer Eugeniusz Stankiewicz, being a teacher in the Aviation School in Zamo≈õƒá. Works started in late 1944, soon after the liberation of eastern Poland, when central and western parts were still occupied by the Germans. The design of a trainer and liaison plane was approved by the Polish military Aviation Command, and Stankiewicz completed documentation in an aircraft factory PZL- Mielec in Mielec (the factory was destroyed by the Germans and at that time existed as repair works only). There, a prototype was built, utilizing parts of the Soviet Polikarpov Po-2, like an engine with a propeller, wheels and seats, also a construction of a fuselage was similar to the Po-2. The plane, named S-1 (for Stankiewicz), was very simple. It was flown on 15 November 1945, by the Soviet pilot Piotr Kondratyenko. It was the second Polish- designed plane, that flew after the war (the first was LWD Szpak). Further aircraft were not produced. The prototype crashed on 14 May 1946 in Warsaw in a bad weather, its pilot, who was Stankiewicz himself, survived. Description Wooden construction braced high-wing (parasol wing) monoplane, conventional in layout. Fuselage built of a frame, plywood and canvas covered. Rectangular wing with rounded tips, two-spar.

The Central Indian Ridge (CIR) is a north-south-trending mid-ocean ridge in the western Indian Ocean. Geological setting The morphology of the CIR is characteristic of slow to intermediate ridges. The axial valley is 500‚Äì1000 m deep; 50‚Äì100 km-long ridge segments are separated by 30 km-long transform faults and 10 km-long non-transform discontinuities. Melt supply comes from axial volcanic ridges that are 15 km- long, 1‚Äì2 km wide, and reaches 100‚Äì200 m above the axial floor. With a spreading rate of 30 mm/yr near the Equator and 49 mm/yr near the Rodrigues Triple Junction (RTJ) at its southern end, the CIR is an intermediately fast spreading ridge characterised by moderate obliquity and few large offsets, the obvious exception being the almost 300 km-long Marie Celeste Fracture Zone at 18¬∞S. Between 21¬∞S and the Marie Celeste Fracture Zone (18¬∞S) the CIR deviates westward. Along this section the larger offsets switch from right-lateral to left-lateral but return to right-lateral north of 18¬∞S. Otherwise, the southern section (RTJ-Argo Fracture Zone, 25¬∞S-13¬∞S) of the CIR is near- orthogonal relative to the spreading direction. North of the Argo FZ it is highly oblique and dominated by numerous small ridge segments. The northern section of the CIR, including the Carlsberg Ridge, trends NNW and lacks fracture zones. The axial depth of the CIR increases from 3200 m at 20¬∞S to 4000 m at the RTJ. Boundaries The CIR is traditionally said to separate the African Plate from the Indo-Australian Plate. Likewise, the Owen Fracture Zone in the northern end of the CIR is traditionally said to separate the Indian-Australian plate from the Arabian Plate. Movements in the Owen Fracture Zone are, however, negligible and Arabia and India are moving as a single plate. This plate, in turn, is separated from the Australian Plate by a diffuse boundary, the India‚ÄìCapricorn boundary, which stretches east from the CIR near Chagos Bank to the Ninety East Ridge and north along the Ninety East Ridge to the northern end of the Sunda Trench. This diffuse boundary was probably initiated in the Late Miocene and is probably related to opening of Gulf of Aden and the uplift of the Himalayas. Tectonic history and hotspot interaction The CIR was opened during the separation of the Mascarene Plateau and the Chagos-Laccadive Ridge about 38 Ma, both of which are the products of the R√©union hotspot, the only hotspot known to have interacted with the CIR. Now located 1100 km from the CIR, hotspot crossed the CIR near 18-20¬∞S, from the Indian to the African plate, at 47 Ma. The R√©union hotspot track includes the Chagos-Laccadive Ridge on the Indian Plate which leads to the Indian west-coast where the newborn hotspot produced the Deccan Traps in north-west India at 66 Ma. The only above-water structure near the CIR is the Rodrigues Island, the top of the enigmatic Rodrigues Ridge between Mauritius and the CIR. The Rodrigues Ridge reaches the CIR at 19¬∞S via a series of en echelon ridges known as the Three Magi. Volcanic rocks from the Rodrigues Island are, however, similar to 1,58-1,30 Ma-old rocks from R√©union and Mauritius and the Rodrigues Ridge can't therefore have originated on the CIR leaving the R√©union hotspot the most likely candidate.

The highway serves to connect SR 225 to Interstate 82 (I-82) and U.S. Route 12 (US 12), and to link Benton City to West Richland and Richland. Before the 1964 state highway renumbering the highway was numbered Secondary State Highway 3R. SR 224 is a lightly traveled rural highway except through Richland, where an average of 16,000 cars traveled the highway daily in 2009. The Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) rebuilt its southern terminus as a roundabout in 2016, as part of a project to improve traffic congestion near the Red Mountain AVA.  Route description  SR 224 begins at an interchange with I-82 in southern Benton City. After only , SR 224 intersects SR 225 at a roundabout and turns to the east as Kennedy Road. After passing a park and ride lot on the south side of the highway, the road turns back to the north off of Kennedy road, paralleling the Yakima River, slowly turning northeast through a rural area of Benton County. After passing through farmland SR 224 enters West Richland and becomes Van Giesen Street, the main east‚Äìwest thoroughfare of the city. Exiting the town, the highway passes over the Yakima River and enters Richland, passing through a rural area on the south side of Richland Airport. At the southeast corner of the airport, SR 224 crosses over a single track belonging to the Port of Benton and managed by Tri-City Railroad and terminates at an intersection with SR 240 (the Richland Bypass Highway). Van Giesen Street continues east from the terminus of SR 224 for another , intersecting SR 240 Business near the western shore of the Columbia River. The highway is primarily a two-lane road between Benton City and West Richland. The road expands to four lanes in West Richland, a width the highway remains to its terminus in Richland. Speed limits posted on the highway range from to . Every year WSDOT conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2009, WSDOT calculated that as few as 3,200 cars traveled through the intersection at Keene Road, west of West Richland, and as many as 16,000 cars at the eastern terminus.  History  Shield of former SSH 3R A roadway has connected Benton City to Richland since at least 1926, while a road with an alignment more similar to that of the current highway first appeared on maps in 1939, with termini at the concurrent highways U.S. Route 410 and PSH 3\\\\. The highway now known as SR 224 was numbered Secondary State Highway 3R (SSH 3R) between 1937 and the 1964 state highway renumbering, which abolished the Primary and Secondary highway numbers, replacing them with Sign Route numbers, later renamed State Routes. The twin set of bridges that carry I-82 over the highway at the western terminus were built in 1973, which was during the initial construction of I-82 through southern Washington. The current bridge that carries SR 224 over the Yakima River was constructed in 1993, replacing the original bridge on the highway. The highway's southern terminus, at I-82 and SR 225, was converted into a roundabout in June 2016 to improve traffic flow. The $4.5 million project was the first project funded by the Connecting Washington tax package, passed in 2015 by the state legislature. A road connecting SR 224 near the Red Mountain AVA to the a new interchange on I-82 is planned to begin construction in 2019 and will cost $24.9 million.

Tajo was born in Pinerolo, Piedmont, Italy and studied violin and voice at the Music Conservatory of Turin with Nilde Stichi-Bertozzi. He made his stage debut in 1935, as Fafner (Das Rheingold), under Fritz Busch. At Busch's invitation, he followed him to Glyndebourne, where he became a member of the chorus, also appearing in comprimario roles. In 1939, he returned to Italy, where he became a member of the Rome Opera, in 1942 taking part in the Italian premiere of Berg's Wozzeck. In 1940, he joined the Teatro alla Scala in Milan, where he sang regularly until 1956. He appeared with the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino in 1942, as Leporello in Don Giovanni, a role he would sing numerous times during his career. In 1961, the bass performed in the world premiere of Luigi Nono's Intolleranza 1960, in Venice. The war over, his career quickly took an international turn, with debuts in Paris, London, Edinburgh and Buenos Aires. In 1946, he made his debut at the Chicago Opera Company, and 1948 saw his debut at both the San Francisco Opera and Metropolitan Opera in New York (Don Basilio in The Barber of Seville, with Giuseppe Valdengo); his other roles at the Met included Figaro, Leporello, Don Basilio, Dulcamara, Don Pasquale and Gianni Schicchi. Although he made a specialty of comic roles, he sang a fair number of dramatic roles, notably Verdi's Attila and Banco, and Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov. He also created Samuel in Darius Milhaud's David, as well as roles in operas by Berio, Lualdi, Malipiero and Nono. In 1953, he appeared at the Teatro Comunale Florence as Count Rostov and Field-Marshal Kutuzov in the near-complete Italian-language premiere of Prokofiev's War and Peace. In 1957, he replaced Ezio Pinza in the role of Emile de Becque in the musical South Pacific on Broadway, later also appearing in Kiss Me, Kate. In 1966, he began teaching at the University of Cincinnati, where he was largely responsible for the establishment of an opera workshop. One of his notable pupils was baritone Tom Fox. He continued singing until well into his seventies, mostly at the Metropolitan Opera in character roles such as Geronte, Benoit, Alcindoro, and the Sacristan. His last stage appearance was at the Met as the Sacristan in Tosca in 1991. Tajo made relatively few recordings, the most famous being the acclaimed 1950 RCA Victor Rigoletto, with Leonard Warren, Erna Berger and Jan Peerce, conducted by Renato Cellini. He also recorded The Marriage of Figaro and Don Giovanni for Cetra. Tajo can be heard in live broadcasts of Macbeth, opposite Maria Callas, conducted by Victor de Sabata; and the Florence War and Peace. In the late 1940s, Tajo appeared in film versions of The Barber of Seville, L'elisir d'amore, and Lucia di Lammermoor, as well as in television production such as Don Pasquale in 1955, released as a Hardy Classic Video (DVD). As a special guest, Tajo sang an excerpt from Don Pasquale during the Metropolitan Opera Centennial Celebration in October 1983. In 1988, he appeared in Francesca Zambello's production of La boh√®me, as Benoit and Alcindoro, which was a film of a San Francisco Opera production starring Mirella Freni and Luciano Pavarotti.

The highway travels over the Benton City ‚Äì Kiona Bridge, which is listed on the Washington Heritage Register and National Register of Historic Places, over the Yakima River. After turning through Benton City, the highway parallels the river for the remainder of the route. Several different proposals have been introduced to alleviate traffic flow issues at the SR 224 / SR 225 interchange, which was ultimately replaced with a roundabout in 2016.  Route description  Benton City ‚Äì Kiona Bridge from the north SR 225 starts at a roundabout with SR 224 just north of the Interstate 82 / U.S. Route 12 interchange in south Benton City. The highway passes over the Yakima River on the Benton City ‚Äì Kiona Bridge, which is listed on the Washington Heritage Register and the National Register of Historic Places. After a brief turn to the west, the highway resumes northerly into Benton City, serving as the main street through town. The Yakima River continues to parallel the highway as it exits town, passing between a hill on the west side and the river, followed by Horn Rapids County Park on the east until the highways terminus at SR 240. Every year the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2009, WSDOT calculated that as few as 1,000 cars used the highway at the terminus at SR 240, and as many as 7,800 cars at the interchange with SR 224.  History  SR 225 was added to the highway logs during the 1991 legislative session, and since then the only major changes to the highway have been the replacement of the bridge over a drainage canal about from the western terminus of the highway. In 2010, WSDOT began studying several different designs for the SR 224 / SR 225 interchange to improve traffic flow, including signalizing the intersection, moving the off ramp from I-84 and making a 5-way stop, and multiple different roundabout solutions. The highway's southern terminus was converted into a roundabout in June 2016, at a cost of $4.5 million.

Geothermal power in Turkey began in the 1970s in a prototype plant following systematic exploration of geothermal fields. In the 1980s, a first power plant has grown up out of the pilot facility. Turkey is ranked seventh richest country in the world in geothermal potential. The small-sized geothermal power plant was expanded to the country's biggest one in 2013. 55 power plants operate in Turkey as of February 2019 . Its theoretical geothermal potential is 60GW and potential is 4.5GW As well as the electricity sector in Turkey, geothermal heat is used directly. At the end of 2019 Turkey had 1.5 GW installed capacity, the fourth largest in the world after the United States, Indonesia and the Philippines: and for heat is second only to China. Geology The high geothermal potential is due to geology such as the Western Anatolian Graben systems. However \\"many of Turkey‚Äôs existing geothermal plants are situated on reservoirs where the carbon content of non-condensable gases (NCGs) in the geothermal fluids are high\\", therefore care must be taken to avoid excessive carbon emissions. =Carbon-dioxide emissions= The CO2 emissions from new geothermal plants in Turkey are some of the highest in the world, ranging from 900 to 1300 g/kWh but gradually decline: lifecycle emissions are still being researched as of 2019. Direct use of heat Turkey is second to China in direct use. History In 1965, the state-owned Turkish Mineral Research and Exploration Co. began with the first geological and geophysical surveys in southwestern Turkey. The Kƒ±zƒ±ldere geothermal reservoir, a field on the western branch of B√ºy√ºk Menderes Graben, was discovered in 1968 as a geothermal field suitable for electricity generation. The first power plant was built as a prototype facility in 1974 with 500 kW installed capacity. The generated electricity was distributed to the households in the vicinity free of charge. The state-owned Elektrik √úretim A.≈û. (E√úA≈û) enlarged the installed capacity up to 17.4 MW in 1984. However, the average actual power was around 10 MW. In 2008, the power plant was transferred to Zorlu Energy in the frame of privatization. Zorlu Energy obtained the right of operating lease for 30 years, and increased the capacity from 6 MW to 15 within a short time. The company invested US$250 million to expand the facility. In December 2013, the Kƒ±zƒ±ldere Geothermal Power Plant reached an installed capacity of 95 MW making it Turkey's biggest. As of 2005, Turkey had the 5th highest direct usage and capacity of geothermal energy in the world. Turkey's capacity as of 2005 is 1,495 MWt with a usage of 24,839.9 TJ/year or 6,900.5 GWh/year at a capacity factor of 0.53. Most of this is in the form of direct-use heating however geothermal electricity is currently produced at the Kizildere plant in the province of Denizli producing 120,000 tons of liquid carbon dioxide and dry ice. As of 2006 and 2010, there were two plants generating 8.5 and 11.5 MWe respectively, in Aydƒ±n. The direct-use heating has been mostly district heating serving 103,000 residences (827 MWt and 7712.7 TJ/year). There is also individual space heating (74 MWt and 816.8 TJ/year); 800,000 m2 of heated greenhouses (192 MWt and 3,633 TJ/year); and 215 balneological facilities, 54 spas, bathing and swimming pools (402 MWt and 12,677.4 TJ/year). It is stated that at least 1.5 million houses, currently heated by natural gas, can switch to being heated by thermal waters. As of 2005, 170 future geothermal prospects had been identified with 95% in the low-to medium enthalpy range suitable for direct-use applications (Simsek et al., 2005). In 2010 the installed geothermal electricity generation capacity was 100 MWe while direct use installations were approximately 795 MWt. Turkey reaches milestone 1,100 MW of installed geothermal power generation capacity in December 2017.

Note the \\"wake\\" of the eastward propagating triple junction. The Rodrigues Triple Junction (RTJ), also known as the Central Indian [Ocean] Triple Junction (CITJ) is a geologic triple junction in the southern Indian Ocean where three tectonic plates meet: the African Plate, the Indo-Australian Plate, and the Antarctic Plate. The triple junction is named for the island of Rodrigues which lies north-west of it. The RTJ was first recognized in 1971, then described as a stable R-R-R (ridge-ridge-ridge) triple junction based on coarse ship data. Boundaries The boundaries of the three plates which meet at the Rodrigues Triple Junction are all oceanic spreading centers, making it an R-R-R type triple junction. They are: the Central Indian Ridge (CIR, between the African and Indo- Australian plates) with a spreading rate of 50 mm/yr; the Southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR, between the African and Antarctic plates) 16 mm/yr; and the Southeast Indian Ridge (SEIR, between the Indo-Australian and Antarctic plates) 60 mm/yr. The SEIR has the highest spreading rates at the RTJ, and, while now considered an intermediate spreading centre, it was a fast spreading ridge between anomalies 31 and 22, with a rate of 110 km/myr at anomaly 28. The spreading rate is similar in the CIR but slower and the ridge has a more complex geometry. The SWIR has ultra-slow spreading rates, a rough topography, and great number of large offset fracture zones. All three boundaries are themselves intersected by diffuse boundaries: the CIR is intersected by the Indian‚ÄìCapricorn boundary; the SEIR by the Capricorn‚ÄìAustralian boundary; and the SWIR by the Nubian‚ÄìSomalian boundary. For example, the East African Rift divides Africa into the Nubian and Somalian plates. These plates converge in the southern part of the rift valley (2 mm/yr) but diverge in the northern part (6 mm/yr) and a very slight difference in spreading rates across the central part of the ultra-slow SWIR indicates there is a vague triple junction somewhere south of Madagascar. Tectonic evolution The RTJ was born when the Seychelles microcontinent drifted off the Indian Plate at 64 Ma and the Carlsberg Ridge opened. Since then the RTJ has moved eastward from south of Madagascar (modern coordinates) to its current location. Since 65 Ma the RTJ has been migrating north-east at a decreasing rate: originally the velocity was 10 cm/yr, at 43 Ma 2.6 cm/yr, and since 41 Ma around 3.6‚Äì3.8 cm/yr. The stability in migration rate around 41 Ma coincide with the bend in the Hawaiian‚ÄìEmperor seamount chain ‚Äî hinting at a global reorganisation of tectonic plates at this time. Originally considered a stable RRR (ridge-ridge- ridge) triple junction, the RTJ is now believed to be an unstable RRF (ridge- ridge-fault) triple junction in which the axis of the CIR is offset eastward by 14 km/myr because of differences in spreading rates between the SEIR and CIR. This is a configuration similar to that of the Galapagos Triple Junction in the east Pacific. Each time the RTJ offset eastward a new segment is added to CIR. resulting in a constant length for the SEIR while CIR constantly lengthens. Spreading rates in the SWIR, in contrast, is intermittent and very slow, but the extension of the plates in the SEIR and CIR causes constant lengthening of the SWIR near the RTJ.

The highway begins at SR 22 in Mabton and travels north to Sunnyside, where it intersects Interstate 82 (I-82) and U.S. Route 12 (US 12). SR 241 continues north into the Rattlesnake Hills and ends at a junction with SR 24\\\\. Prior to the formal establishment of SR 241 in 1970, the highway between Sunnyside and the Rattlesnake Hills was briefly designated as Secondary State Highway 3V (SSH 3V). SR 241 was moved during the construction of I-82 during the 1980s and was extended south to Mabton in 1991. Route description SR 241 begins as an extension of Boundary Road at an intersection with SR 22 in Mabton, located at the northeastern edge of the Yakama Indian Reservation. The highway travels northeast towards downtown Mabton, crossing over a section of the BNSF Railway's Yakima Valley subdivision, and turns north at Washington Street to follow 1st Avenue on the border between the Yakama Indian Reservation and Mabton. SR 241 leaves Mabton after passing several suburban blocks and crosses over the Yakima River near a boat launch in the Sunnyside State Wildlife Recreation Area. The highway continues north through Givens Corner and across flat farmland predominately used for herb growing and vineyards. In the southern outskirts of Sunnyside, SR 241 briefly turns east on Alexander Road and north on Waneta Road to intersect I-82 and US 12 at a diamond interchange. The interchange is also the planned location of a new hospital building for the Astria Health system. The highway continues north and crosses over the Central Washington Railroad and the Lower Yakima Valley Pathway trail at an intersection with the Yakima Valley Highway (formerly part of US 12). SR 241 travels around the eastern outskirts of Sunnyside, passing several food processing plants and the Sunnyside Municipal Airport, before leaving the city. It continues north into rolling farmland on Hanford Road, turning northeast to follow Sulphur Creek as it ascends into the Rattlesnake Hills. Within the Rattlesnake Hills, the highway leaves the creek and crosses barren rangelands and shrub-steppe highlands. SR 241 turns north and northeasterly to follow a pass in the hills and begins its descent into the pastures of the Black Rock Valley. The highway briefly crosses into Benton County and re- enters Yakima County while turning northwest to avoid a part of the Yakima Ridge. SR 241 terminates at a junction with SR 24, the main east‚Äìwest route between Yakima and the Hanford area, at the Silver Dollar Cafe. SR 241 is maintained by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), which conducts an annual survey of traffic volumes on state highways measured in terms of average annual daily traffic. Traffic volumes on the highway range from a minimum of 1,600 vehicles near its northern terminus in the Rattlesnake Hills to a maximum of 14,000 vehicles at its interchange with I-82. History Looking south on SR 241 from its northern terminus at SR 24 SR 241 follows a section of the 19th-century White Bluffs Road, which connected Sunnyside to the White Bluffs ferry crossing on the Columbia River. A county road connecting Sunnyside to Mabton was constructed by the early 1910s and paved during the following decade. The original bridge over the Yakima River was replaced in 1954 by a new span. The state legislature created SR 241 in 1967, assigning it the unsigned designation of Secondary State Highway 3V (SSH 3V). The highway connected US 12 and Sunnyside to SSH 11A in the Rattlesnake Hills. The assignment came during the transition between highway numbering systems, which was completed in 1970; SR 241 was officially signed, while SR 24 replaced SSH 11A under the new system. Several low-speed curves on sections of the highway were improved to handle higher-speed travel. The three bridges carrying the highway over the Rosa Irrigation Canal system northeast of Sunnyside were rebuilt by the state government in 1977. SR 241 was extended south to the Waneta Road interchange on I-82 in 1987, five years after the freeway was completed through Sunnyside. The initial selection of Waneta Road instead of the Sunnyside‚ÄìMabton Road was controversial with Mabton residents and officials, who sought to change the state government's tentative plans in the 1970s. The state government ultimately chose the Waneta interchange, but promised improvements to nearby roads to appease Mabton. SR 241 was extended further south to a junction with SR 22 in Mabton in 1992, following an act of the state legislature the previous year. The highway is periodically closed during wintertime due to large snow drifts caused by high winds, necessitating the construction of snow fences along sections of SR 241\\\\. The fences were, however, damaged in 2016 by wildfires and were not replaced due to funding shortfalls.

More detail can be seen at high resolution. Mars Lights are signal-safety lights used in the United States and built by Mars Signal Light Company for railroad locomotives and firefighting apparatus. Mars Lights used a variety of means to cause the light to oscillate vertically, horizontally, or both, to catch the attention of motorists and pedestrians. Mars lights were developed by Jerry Kennelly, a Chicago firefighter who realized that oscillating lamps would benefit fire departments and railroads. He performed an operational test with the C&NW; railroad in 1936, and Mars Lights began appearing on locomotives in the 1930s. Tri Lite, Inc. announced their acquisition of the Mars Signal Light Company, effective January 23, 1991. Tri Lite still manufactures many of the traditional Mars Lights under the Tri Lite Mars brand. The company has updated the Mars \\"888\\" Traffic Breaker with energy-efficient light-emitting diodes replacing the earlier halogen incandescent bulbs. Design variations There were many models of Mars Lights, which used several methods to oscillate the beam. Sometimes the bulb and assembly were moved, other times a reflector behind the light was rotated. The beam was usually oscillated in a triple eight pattern, i.e., the beam would oscillate up and down two or more times for every horizontal sweep, providing a source for the company slogan, \\"The Light from Mars\\". The beams came in a variety of shapes and colors, some locomotives having red and white lights. Railroad use Many railroads used Mars lights on a variety of locomotives, both steam and diesel. Mars Lights are no longer used by railways, having been replaced by ditch lights, with the exception of some passenger carriers, such as Chicago's Metra, which uses both Mars Lights and ditch lights on their equipment. Older locomotives originally equipped with Mars Lights may still use them if fitted and still functioning. They are still used on fire fighting apparatus, and are available from Tri Lite / Mars, located in Chicago, Illinois. LACoFD requirement The Los Angeles County Fire Department required Mars lights as a standard LACoFD warning device until the Federal Sign & Signal BeaconRay was adopted as a replacement. Gyralite Gyralite is a similar type of gyrating warning light formerly made by The Pyle-National Company and now by Trans-Lite, Inc. It is distinguishable from the Mars Light in that the ratio of vertical oscillations to horizontal oscillations is unitary, producing a circular or elliptical scan effect.

The Mother of the Forest is the second one from the left. The Mother of the Forest (667 BCE ‚Äì c1856 CE) was an ancient and huge Sequoiadendron giganteum tree. The tree lived in the Sierra Nevada Mountains in eastern central California, United States. The dead tree's remains are within the Calaveras Grove of Big Trees State Park, in Calaveras County, California. History When the 92 giant sequoias in the valley were discovered and documented in 1852 by Augustus T. Dowd, the Mother of the Forest was the second largest tree after the Discovery Tree, which in 1853 got the name The Big Stump.California State Parks 2006 Guide to the North Grove Trail of Calaveras Big Trees The Mother of the Forest was said to stretch into the air, with a girth of . Mother of the Forest c.1873-83 At the time of the California Gold Rush, people were searching California for undiscovered riches. As photography wasn‚Äôt developed enough yet to satisfy people‚Äôs curiosity, trees were felled and transported to big cities to prove their existence at great costs. In 1854 after unsuccessful exhibitions of the Discovery Tree, William Lapham, George L. Trask and George Gale set about to have the bark from the trunk of the Mother of the Forest removed, ready to be reassembled at exhibitions. Workers made holes in the tree using pump-augers, and inserted rods into the holes to support the weight of the scaffolding and the workers while the bark was sawed off. Over 90 days, 60 tons of bark was removed in high and wide sections up to the height of . The bark was thick at the base,Advertisement for the 1856 exhibition at Crystal Palace, Sydenham and on average . Gale sent samples of the tree to foresters in the east where it was discovered to be 2,520 years old. The bark of the Mother of the Forest on exhibit in London as \\"The Mammoth Tree from California\\" in 1859 The removed sections of the bark were shipped by sea around Cape Horn to New York, where they were reassembled in 1855 in the shape of the tree for a \\"vegetable wonders of the gold regions\\" exhibition in the New York Crystal Palace. After New York, the bark was shipped in 1856 to London, where the sections accommodated by the building in Hyde Park attracted so much attention that all the sections were placed in their full length permanently in The Crystal Palace in London's Sydenham the next year. It was presented to the public as the trunk of a 3,000 year old tree, and was a financial success. It stayed there until the nave of the palace, along with the bark and other exhibits, were destroyed in a fire in 1866. 1866 with empty branches and scaffolding still in place Stereoscopic photograph of the Mother of the Forest from the top of the scaffolding The Mother of the Forest in Calaveras Grove did not survive for long once the bark had been removed. In 1856 the tree still had full foliage, but within five years no leaves remained. The plan for the remaining tree was to build a spiral staircase around the bare section and create a vista for visitors high up in the tree. Hutchings‚Äô 1886 book makes a mention of names and dates of visitors having been carved into the tree at different heights, especially at the top. In 1908, with the tree unprotected by its fire resistant bark, a fire swept through the area and burned away much of what was left of the tree. Legacy Despite or due to the 1850s exhibitions, the destruction of the big trees was met with public outcry. In 1864, on introducing the bill that would become the Yosemite Grant, senator John Conness opined that even after people had seen the physical evidence of the Discovery Tree and the Mother of the Forest, they still didn‚Äôt believe the trees were genuine, and that the areas they were from should be protected instead. In 1903, after having spent several days under the Yosemite sequoias with John Muir, president Theodore Roosevelt gave a speech saying that \\"As regards some of the trees, I want them preserved because they are the only things of their kind in the world.\\" The tree and its environments were owned by several lumber companies around the turn of the century, with plans to cut the remaining trees down, as sequoia and giant sequoia with their thick trunks were seen as great sources of lumber at the time. This again caused a chorus of public outcry by locals and conservationists, and the area continued to be treated as a tourist attraction. The Yosemite protection was gradually extended to most sequoias, and Calaveras Grove was joined to California State Parks in 1931. Present day According to a 2006 trail guide, what is left of Mother of the Forest stands as a large fire-blackened snag along the loop trail through the North Grove, at the far end of the loop.

Crustal thickness decreases quickly as spreading rates drop below c. 20 mm/yr and in the SWIR there is an absence of volcanic activity along stretches of ridge axis. Along large sections, the SWIR runs obliquely relative to the spreading direction, typically about 60¬∞. Because obliquity increases ridge length while decreasing mantle upwelling rates, the SWIR is transitional between slow and ultra-slow ridges. The slow- spreading sections of the SWIR have magmatic segments linked by transform faults, while the ultra-slow sections lack such transforms and have magmatic segments linked by amagmatic troughs. =Diffuse plate boundaries= Spreading in the SWIR is slow, but the plate boundary is intersected by the much slower but more diffuse Nubian‚ÄìSomalian boundary. The variation in spreading rates indicate the SWIR is not a spreading centre between two rigid plates, but that the previously assumed single African Plate north of the SWIR is in fact divided into three plates: the Nubian, Lwandle, and Somalian plates. The location on the SWIR of this \\"diffuse\\" triple junction between the Nubian, Somali, and Antarctic plates has been estimated to between 26¬∞E and 32¬∞E or just west of the Andrew Bain transform fault. This diffuse triple junction forms the southern end of the East African Rift system. =In situ Jurassic rocks= 180 Ma-old rocks, dated from zircons in diorite and gabbro, were dredged from a location south of the SWIR in 2010. This age is comparable to that of the break-up of Gondwana, the opening of the Indian Ocean, and emplacement of the Karoo Large Igneous Province (179-183 Ma) ‚Äî in sharp contrast the Neogene age of the ocean floor near the SWIR. It can be assumed the rocks were deposited near the SWIR by an external force, such as an ice- rafting or a tsunami, but the SWIR is located far away from any continental margin and rocks of similar age have been reported from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. If the rocks came directly out of the mantle it would have lost most of its isotopic lead. Ice-rafted dropstones commonly show sign of rounding. Hydrothermal circulation at mid-ocean ridges can, however, bring intrusive rocks into the shallow mantle, and it is possibly a good candidate in this case. Most rocks in Africa facing the SWIR are Archean cratons. The Neoproterozoic Pan-African Orogenic Belt, however, was accreted during the closure of the Mozambique Ocean and some rocks from eastern Africa, Madagascar, and Antarctica are associated with this event. During the break-up of Gondwana the Karoo volcanics intruded the Pan-African rocks and it is possible, rather than evident, that these rock found their way to the SWIR this way. Because spreading in the SWIR is ultra-slow, the mantle beneath should be abnormally cool, which could prevent melting of the rocks. Subsections =Bouvet TJ‚ÄìAndrew Bain TF= The western end of the SWIR, known as the Bouvet Ridge, is bounded by the Bouvet and Moshesh transforms north and south of it respectively. The Bouvet Ridge is -long with a full spreading rate of during the last 3 Ma. The axial valley is a kilometres deep, typical of slow-spreading ridges, and 16 km wide, which is unusually wide. The zero-age axis lies below sea level in the central segment, but deeper closer to the two transforms: This is roughly a kilometre shallower than similar slow-spreading ridges, probably because of the vicinity to the BTJ. Between 9 and 25¬∞E, the SWIR trends E-W and lacks transforms. This section is composed of orthogonal magmatic accretionary segments linked by oblique amagmatic accretionary segments. The oblique portion of this area (9 to 16¬∞E), the \\"oblique supersegment\\" is highly variable in axial orientation, ranging from orthogonal to 56¬∞, and its series of magmatic and amagmatic segments results in abruptly fluctuating magmatism and ultra-slow spreading. West of a discontinuity at 16¬∞E axial depth drops 500 m and there is an abrupt change in morphology and magnetism. In the western end of this area (9¬∞30'‚Äì11¬∞45') a short magmatic ridge segment intersects the Shaka FZ. The rough topography here obscures the SWIR which runs into the western flank of the Joseph Mayes Seamount, one of few volcanic centres along the oblique supersegment. The seamount splits an old peridotite block, the remains of which project on either side of the ridge, and fills the rift valley in between, resulting in a double-peaked volcano sitting on the SWIR. East of the seamount (11¬∞30'-10¬∞24'E) there is a 180 km-long and 4,200 m-deep amagmatic segment. Reaching a maximum depth of 4,700 m, its deepest part has a rough floor void of signs of recent volcanism but filled with irregular horst blocks partially made of serpentinised peridotite. The \\"orthogonal supersegment\\" (16 to 25¬∞E), in contrast, is almost perfectly orthogonal relative to the spreading direction and is composed of magmatic accretionary segments linked by short non-transform offsets. Where the obliquity of the SWIR increases so does its length. This lengthening results in a decrease in mantle upwelling and a ridge geometry characteristic of ultra-slow spreading ridges (<12 mm/yr). The orthogonal supersegment is similar to larger ridge segments of the Mid- Atlantic Ridge. =Andrew Bain TF= A series of fracture zones ‚Äî Du Toit, Andrew Bain, Marion, and Prince Edward ‚Äî offsets the SWIR between 45¬∞S,35¬∞E‚Äî53¬∞S,27¬∞E. The largest of these, the 750 km long-long Andrew Bain FZ, is where the Nubia-Somalia boundary intersects the SWIR. The active section of the Andrew Bain TF represents the largest age-offset (65 Ma) of any oceanic transform fault and it's also the widest (120 km). Its extension extends south from the Mozambique Escarpment (between the Mozambique Ridge and Basin) to the Astrid Ridge off Antarctica. East of the Andrew Bain TF is the \\"Marion Swell\\", the geoid high of the Southern Ocean, between 35¬∞E and 50.5¬∞E, and the Madagascar Plateau and the Del Cano Rise. The SWIR crosses the flank of the swell before reaching the Marion hotspot at 36¬∞E. Marion Island, where the Marion hotspot is located, lies from the SWIR on 28 Ma crust. Bouvet Island, located from the Bouvet triple junction and from the SWIR, is located on 7 Ma crust, though the exact location of the Bouvet hotspot has not been determined. =Andrew Bain TF‚ÄìMelville FZ= Between the Marion hotspot and Gallieni FZ there is an irregular segmentation with relatively shallow axial depth. Between Prince Edward FZ and Atlantis II FZ (35‚Äì57¬∞E), all major transform faults (and their 35 Ma associated magnetic anomalies) are increasingly trending more directly north‚Äìsouth. Magnetic anomalies in the Mozambique Basin indicate this is the dominant spreading direction for the past 80 Ma. Major changes at Discovery FZ (42¬∞E), Galliene FZ (52¬∞E), and Melville FZ (60¬∞E) define large-scale segmentation of the SWIR. Mean axial depth varies between between Melville FZ and Rodrigues TJ, a section underlain by either thin crust or cold mantle, to between Andrew Bain FZ and Discovery FZ, a section affected by the Marion hotspot. Between Indomed and Gallieni FZs the SWIR is more shallow and has a higher magma supply than neighbouring deeper sections; the crust is also thicker and/or the mantle hotter. This is probably due to the interaction with the Crozet hotspot, the increased magmatism of which resulted in the large Crozet volcanic plateau at c. 10 Ma. The hotspot also triggers thermal plumes and incorporates small amounts of lower mantle material (resulting in a mixed Ocean Island Basalt (OIB)/Mid- ocean ridge basalt (MORB) signature). The Crozet hotspot/Bank is, however, located more than 1000 km from the SWIR and ridge-hotspot interaction at distances beyond 500 km is, theoretically, supposed to be insignificant. The Kerguelen and R√©union hotspots are, however, probably interacting with the Southeast Indian Ridge and Central Indian Ridge over similar distances, as suggested by volcanic chains and lineaments connecting those ridges and hotspots. The absence of such lineaments between the SWIR and Crozet can be explained by plate age and thickness ‚Äî plates older than 25 Ma are thought to be to thick for plumes to penetrate. Between the Gallieni and Melville FZs the SWIR was originally roughly perpendicular to the spreading direction with few and small offsets. About 40 Ma a clock-wise change in spreading direction quickly resulted in evenly spaced offsets and a more rugged terrain. Since then, the Atlantis II transform fault has grown while the offsets west and east of it have begun to disappear. About 40 Ma in the future the Gallieni, Atlantis II, and Melvilles transform faults will continue to grow while the SWIR segments between them will keep most of their present length and shape. =Melville FZ‚ÄìRodrigues TJ= East of the Indomed FZ (south of Madagascar) the SWIR is the product of the 64 million years of eastward propagation of the Rodriguez triple junction. This section is composed of regularly spaced non- transform discontinuities, short oblique amagmatic segments, and the Atlantis II, Novara, and Melville transforms. An increase in axial depth east of 49¬∞E reflects non-magmatic extension. The segmentation and morphology in the axial valley of the easternmost SWIR is unique to ultra-slow spreading ridges. 3000 m-high ridge segments are linked by more than 100 km-long axial segments. There is no volcanism along this section. The flanks of the ridge axis are wide and lack a volcanic crustal layer. These flanks are rounded and smooth and lack the corrugated pattern associated with oceanic core complexes. This non-volcanic sea-floor is made of seawater-altered mantle-derived rocks brought to the surface by large-scale detachment faults. During the last 10 Ma these detachment faults have flipped back and forth across the ridge axis and produced almost all the divergence along this section of the SWIR. In the easternmost SWIR, east of Melville FZ (60¬∞45' E), the mantle is unusually cold and the crust thin (3.7 km in average) resulting in only partial melting in the mantle and a decrease in melt supply to the SWIR in this region. This shortage in magma supply has resulted in fewer but taller seamounts east of Melville; there are more than 100 seamounts per 103 km2 about 50 m tall west of Melville whereas east of Melville there are fewer than 10 seamounts per 103 km2 more than 100 m tall. Tectonic history The SWIR is characterised by deep, sub-parallel, and well-delineated fracture zones, sometimes deeper than , delineated by elevated rims, sometimes reaching up to below sea level. These fracture zones are very long and often align with older structures near the continental shelves. These fracture zones, and their extensions into the Agulhas Basin, are flow-lines describing the motion of Africa and Antarctica since break-up of Gondwana in the Late Cretaceous. The SWIR opened during the break-up of Gondwana when Antarctica broke off from Africa during the Permian- Triassic Karoo large igneous province c. 185‚Äì180 Ma in what is now the Mozambique Basin and the Riiser-Larsen Sea. The spreading direction between the continents started to change around 74 Ma and 69‚Äì64 Ma spreading slowed (c. 1 cm/yr) then changed orientation to NE-SW. Fracture zones near Prince Edward FZ are from the Eocene, much younger than could be assumed from their length.

A divergent tectonic plate boundary stretching almost between the Rodrigues Triple Junction () in the Indian Ocean and the Macquarie Triple Junction () in the Pacific Ocean, the SEIR forms the plate boundary between the Australian and Antarctic plates since the Oligocene (anomaly 13). The SEIR is the spreading centre closest to the Kerguelen and Amsterdam‚ÄìSaint-Paul hotspot. The SEIR has an intermediate full spreading rate of 65 mm/yr, and, because Antarctica is virtually stationary, this results in a northward ridge migration of half that rate. Spreading rates along the SEIR varies from 69 mm/yr near 88¬∞E to 75 mm/yr near 120¬∞E. Geology =Amsterdam‚àíSt. Paul hotspot= During the past 1 Ma the Amsterdam‚ÄìSt. Paul hotspot (ASP) has produced a 150√ó200 km plateau straddling on the SEIR. The ASP Plateau covers and area of 30,000 km2 and rises 500 m above the surrounding seafloor. Both Amsterdam and St. Paul are located on the Antarctic side within 40 km of the SEIR. North-east of the ASP Plateau a string of submarine volcanoes, 1‚àí3 km-high and 40 km-wide, mark the track of the ASP hotspot across the Australian Plate. This track leads to the intersection of the Broken Ridge and Ninety East Ridge west of Australia. The ASP hotspot ceased to produce these volcanoes some 10‚àí5 Ma when the SEIR started to interact with it and the hotspot started to build the shallow plateau. The Kerguelen hotspot, located more than 1,000 km from the SEIR, also influences the MORB composition of the SEIR near the ASP Plateau. Furthermore, there is an active submarine volcano, the 1100 m-high Boomerang Seamount, 18 km north of Amsterdam Island near the SEIR. Analyses of the isotope composition of basalts recovered from its caldera support that the ASP hotspot contributed to the formation of the Ninety East Ridge. =Australian‚àíAntarctic Discordance= Trending east-west between Australia and Antarctica, the SEIR traverses the Australian-Antarctic Discordance (AAD), a morphologically complex region overlying an area of mantle down-welling. Located midway between the ASP-Kerguelen and the Balleny-Tasmantid hotspots, the AAD overlies a region where cooler mantle temperatures have produced a thin oceanic crust and a rough topography with deep valleys. Between the AAD and the Amsterdam and St. Paul islands, spreading rate is constant at 69‚Äì75 mm/yr while axial depth increases by more than 2300 m. This has been interpreted as an eastward decrease in mantle temperature of perhaps 100 ¬∞C caused by a magma flow from the Kerguelen‚ÄìASP hotspots to the AAD 'cold spot' at 120‚Äì128¬∞E. Located at 126¬∞E, the AAD would thus mark the 40 km-long transition between Indian Ocean and Pacific MORBs (mid-ocean ridge basalts), a boundary that has been migrating westward during the past tens of million years. Between 102¬∞E and the AAD, where the spreading rate is constant, the left-stepping transform faults suggest the presence of oblique extensional forces while the presence of a long, elevated ridge near the 96¬∞E right-stepping transform suggests a compressional force is also active. Together these features indicate the two tectonic plate made a recent counter-clockwise change in relative motion. Between 88¬∞E and 118¬∞E there are nine transform faults offsetting the SEIR 21‚Äì135 km or an age of 0.5‚Äì3.6 Ma, accompanied by eight first-order segments (older than 5 Ma) and five east-migrating rifts. These transform faults and migrating rifts are located were the SEIR reaches its maximum axial depths. The first-order transform faults are off-set 2‚Äì17 km by 19 non-transform discontinuities, resulting in 18‚Äì180 km-long second-order segments. The flanks of the SEIR are dominated by fracture zones perpendicular to the ridge and gravitational lineations oblique to the spreading direction and sometimes zigzag-shaped. This suggests that the SEIR evolves rapidly within the framework of the stable transform faults. Tectonic history Australia and Antarctica were neighbours before the break-up of Gondwana in the Cretaceous and several conjugate structures exist on either side of the SEIR. In south- western Australia the Albany-Fraser Orogen formed during the Mesoproterozoic collision between the Australian Yilgarn and Antarctic Mawson cratons. The continental basement of the submarine Naturaliste Plateau is also associated with this orogeny. The Darling Fault on the Australian west coast has a possible continuation beneath the Antarctic Denman Glacier. Archaean and Paleoproterzoic rocks in the Kalinjala Mylonite Zone of the Eyre Peninsula, Australia, match those found in Terre Adelie in Eastern Wilkes Land, Antarctica. Faults in Tasmania‚ÄìVictoria and Northern Victoria Land have been identified as Cambrian remains of the west-dipping subduction zone along the eastern margin of Gondwana. Australia and Antarctica broke-up around 110 Ma but spreading in the SEIR first began during the Eocene (40 Ma) when the Kerguelen hotspot separated Broken Ridge from the rest of the Kerguelen Plateau. The SEIR has been migrating northeast since and is now located 1400 km from the Kerguelen hotspot. The ASP hotspot was originally located beneath Australia and a chain of seamounts connecting it to the southern end of the Ninety East Ridge, i.e. the ASP hotspot track, indicate it probably contributed to the formation of the Ninety East Ridge before the SEIR opened. The opening of the Southern Ocean began west of Australia around 100 Ma from where it propagated eastward at about 2 cm/yr. This rifting was not the direct product of hotspot interaction as it occurred over a cooler than normal mantle. Initially spreading was extremely slow, a half rate of 2‚Äì6 mm/yr during the period 96‚Äì45 Ma after which it accelerated to 30‚Äì35 mm/yr. Oceanography The SEIR divides the channel between Australia and Antarctica into the South Indian Basin to the south and the South Australian and Tasman basins to the north. The AAD forms a saddle across the channel while also offering the deepest connection between the Australian and South Indian basins. There is a voluminous contourite drift along the southern flank of SEIR. Volcanic in origin, it is most likely derived from the slopes of the Kerguelen Plateau and Crozet Islands. This redistribution of sediments has occurred during the last 40000 years. Elevated contributions during the Last Glacial Maximum are thought to be caused by the Antarctic Circumpolar Current and Circumpolar Deep Water and their interaction with the Circumpolar Bottom Water.

His innovations included the magazine subscription card, the toll-free 1-800 number, loyalty rewards programs, and many more. He identified, named, and defined the term \\"direct marketing\\" in a 1967 speech at MIT, and was inducted into the Advertising Hall of Fame in 1998.  Biography  Wunderman was born on June 22, 1920 in the Bronx, the son of Dorothy (Horowitz) and Harry Wunderman, and was educated at New York City public schools. Both his parents were Jewish immigrants: his father from Austria and his mother from Romania. He attended classes at each of New York City‚Äôs colleges and universities so he could create his own ‚Äúdegree.‚Äù He never held a formal college degree. In 1947, he was hired as a copywriter at Maxwell Sackheim & Co. While there, he noted that their \\"mail order\\" accounts had the potential to be built into a broader line of business. He introduced a \\"direct marketing\\" approach to service them, using the medium of clients‚Äô mailboxes as a way to develop a more personal connection with potential customers than general advertising had previously found possible. To expand the direct marketing approach, Wunderman and his brother Irving, along with two colleagues, Ed Ricotta and Harry Kline, met on August 20, 1958, in Wunderman's \\"office\\" ‚Äì a $30-a-night room at the Hotel Winslow in New York City ‚Äì and with combined assets of $60,000 founded their own agency, Wunderman, Ricotta & Kline. In 1958, the firm opened its doors in New York City with a staff of seven. There were no clients. Nevertheless, WR&K; attracted more than $2 million in billings during its first year. WR&K; (later acquired by Young & Rubicam and eventually called Wunderman) was responsible for developing and/or promoting the Columbia Record Club, the 1-800 toll-free number for businesses (developed for a Toyota campaign), the magazine subscription card, and the postal ZIP code system. A long-time relationship with American Express also led to the first customer rewards program ‚Äì a breakthrough means of keeping customers loyal to a brand that has since transformed the travel and retail industries as well. Wunderman was elected to the Direct Marketing Hall of Fame in 1983 and the Advertising Hall of Fame in 1998. He received an honorary doctorate from Brooklyn College, City University of New York in 1984. He was named one of twenty ‚ÄúAdvertising Legends and Leaders‚Äù by AdWeek Magazine in 1998. In the July 23, 2001 issue of Time Magazine, he along with David Ogilvy and Sergio Zyman were heralded as ‚ÄúGreat Pitchmen Over the Years.‚ÄùTime International (South Pacific Edition), 7/23/2001, Issue 29, p53 Wunderman lectured at a host of schools, including Columbia University, Fordham University, Boston University, and M.I.T. His book Being Direct: Making Advertising Pay was published in January 1997 and republished with new material in 2004. An ebook version, which includes a new introduction from the author, was published in 2011. An avid art collector, Wunderman donated nearly 300 works of Dogon artifacts to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the balance of his Dogon collection to the Mus√©e de l'Homme in Paris, France. He was an exhibited photographer for many years. He studied photography at the New School for Social Research and then with private instructors. Fifty of his photographs of his Dogon art are part of the permanent collection of New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art and thirteen other museums. His work has been represented by galleries in New York and the village of Mougins, France. He, Jacqueline Kennedy, Karl Katz, and Cornell Capa helped found the International Center of Photography in New York. His book of photographs, named \\"Wunderman\\", has been published and distributed in 2008 by the global advertising agency that bears his name. Beginning in 2010, a collection of Wunderman's papers have been housed at the Rubenstein Library at Duke University. He also served as Chairman Emeritus of Wunderman. Personal life Wunderman married twice. His first wife was Liljan Darcourt Malina (divorced from Frank Malina) with whom he had two children, Marc Wunderman and Karen Wunderman Cusworth, before divorcing. At the time of his death, lived in New York City with his second wife, Dr. Suzanne Cott (born Suzanne Oksman in 1935), who, in the 1950s and 1960s, appeared on television shows such as What's My Line as Sue Oakland, and for many years afterward, was Director of Editorials for WCBS-TV in New York. He had three stepsons, Patrick Cott, James Cott, and Thomas Cott. He was a congregant at the Eldridge Street Synagogue. He died on January 9, 2019 at the age of 98 in New York.

He was a son of Harald the Younger and thus a nephew of Rorik of Dorestad, and a relative of both Harald Klak and Godfrid Haraldsson, but he was \\"the black sheep of the family\\".Simon Coupland (1998), \\"From Poachers to Gamekeepers: Scandinavian Warlords and Carolingian Kings\\", Early Medieval Europe, 7 (1), 101‚Äì103. He was baptised, but under what circumstances is unknown. His career is obscure, but similar accounts are found in the three major series of Reichsannalen from the period: the Annales Bertiniani from West Francia, the Annales Fuldenses from East Francia, and the Annales Xantenses from Middle Francia. He died in an unsuccessful attempt to impose a danegeld on the locals of the Ostergo.Einar Joranson (1923), The Danegeld in France (Rock Island: Augustana), 237‚Äì39. In 864 Rodulf led a band of mercenaries (locarii) into Lotharingia to extract a payment from Lothair II, who exacted four denarii from every mansus (landholding) in the kingdom, as well as large number of cattle and much flour, wine, and beer. The only source to mention it is the contemporary Annales Bertiniani: > Hlotharius, Hlotharii filius, de omni regno suo quattuor denarios ex omni > manso colligens, summam denariorum cum multa pensione farinae atque pecorum > necnon vini ac sicerae Rodulfo Normanno, Herioldi filio, ac suis locarii > nomine tribuit. > > Lothar, son of Lothar, raised four denarii from every manse in his whole > kingdom, and handed over the sum in cash, plus a large quantity of flour and > livestock and also wine and cider, to the Norseman Hr√≥√∞ulfr [Rodulf], son of > Haraldr [Harald], and his men, all this being termed a payment for > service.The translation is Janet Nelson's, available here. The word translated \\"cider\\" or \\"beer\\", sicera, is derived from ancient Hebrew and can refer to any alcoholic beverage that is not wine. It has been translated sherbet. The whole amount of the cash is not recorded. Whether it was paid as a stipend or as a tribute is debated: Einar Joranson could not tell, but Simon Coupland has argued that locarii (plural of locarium) refers consistently in Carolingian sources to payment for mercenary services, as opposed to tributum (defensive payment). Twice in 872 Rodulf joined his uncle, Rorik, in paying a visit to Charles the Bald, as recorded in the Annales Bertiniani: > On 20 January he [Charles the Bald] left Compendio and went to the monastery > of [name missing in surviving manuscripts] to hold talks with the Norsemen > Hr√∏rek [Rorik] and Hr√≥√∞ulfr [Rodulf]. . . In October he [Charles the Bald] > came by boat down the Meuse to Maastricht and held talks with the Norsemen > Hr√∏rek and Hr√≥√∞ulfr who had come up the river to meet him. He gave a > gracious reception to Hr√∏rek who had proved loyal to him, but Hr√≥√∞ulfr he > dismissed empty-handed, because he had been plotting acts of treachery and > pitching his demands too high. Charles prepared his faithful men for defense > against treacherous attacks of Hr√≥√∞ulfr. Then he rode back by way of Attigny > to Saint Medard's Abbey, where he spent Christmas. Added to his possible paid military service to Lothair II, his close relations with the Frankish kings suggests he may have had a fiefdom in Frisia, perhaps having succeeded his father there in the 840s. If so, then Charles became his overlord by the Treaty of Meerssen in 870. His major Viking activities took place, according to the annals, in West Francia and \\"across the water\\", presumably referring to the British Isles. According to the Annales Bertiniani, in the autumn of 873 Charles the Bald warned his leading vassals in the north of his kingdom to beware of Rodulf possible treachery. Janet Nelson, commenting on the Annales, speculated that Rodulf was conspiring with Charles rebellious younger son Carloman. According to all three annals, Rodulf arrived in northern Frisia in June 873 and sent messengers to the Ostergo calling for tribute (tributa in the words of the Annales Fuldenses). The Frisians replied that they owed taxes only to their king, Louis the German, and his sons (Carloman, Louis, and Charles). A battle ensued, in which Rodulf was killed and his troops routed. The Annales Fuldenses record that a Scandinavian Christian, whom they do not name, fought on the Frisian side and provided counsel that was crucial to victory. These Annales also provide a full and detailed account of the battle.The translation from Timothy Reuter, trans., The Annals of Fulda, Manchester Medieval series, Ninth-Century Histories, Volume II (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1992), is available here: > In June Hr√≥√∞ulfr (), a certain Norseman of royal stock, who had often raided > Charles' kingdom [West Francia] with pillage and arson, led a fleet into the > kingdom of King Louis [the German], in Albdag's county [Oostergo] and sent > messengers ahead with a demand that the inhabitants of the region should pay > him tribute. When they replied that they were not bound to pay tribute to > anyone except to King Louis and his sons, and that they would not agree to > his demands in this matter under any circumstances, he was enraged, and in > his pride swore that after all the males had been killed the women and > children with all their movable wealth should be taken off into captivity > not knowing of the revenge which was to pursue him from[heaven. He at once > invaded their lands and began to make war against them.

The account of the Annales Bertiniani is more brief: > Meanwhile the Norseman Hr√≥√∞ulfr (Latin: Rodulfus), who had inflicted many > evils on Charles's realm, was slain in the realm of Louis with 500 and more > of his accomplices. Charles got reliable news of this as he remained in his > position in Angers. The anonymous author of the Annales Xantenses remarks acidly on his death: > Quamvis baptizatus esset, caninam vitam digne morte finivit. > > Even though he had been baptized, he ended his dog's life with a fitting > death.Translation from Coupland, 102. A fuller translation of the passage > can be found here : > >> Ruodoldus, cousin (nepos) of the mentioned tyrant [Rorik], who plundered many regions across the sea and the kingdom of the Franks from all directions and awfully plundered Gaul [West Francia] and almost entire Frisia (came to him). In the same region in the pagus Oostergo he was nimbly killed with five hundred men by the very same people and, although he has been baptized, he finished his doggish life by a deserved death.

Together with his brothers Giovanni, Giorgio and Orazio he headed the De Stefano 'ndrina. Early years De Stefano clan hailed from the Archi neighbourhood in Reggio Calabria. Paolo and his brother Giorgio De Stefano went to university for several years.Arlacchi, Mafia Business, p. 121 According to the pentito Giacomo Lauro, who held important positions in the Reggio Calabria clans: ‚ÄúIn 1970 ‚Ä¶ the De Stefanos ‚Ä¶ were nobody, they were nobody. The De Stefano brothers became the owners of Reggio Calabria after the war, the first mafia war. ‚Ä¶ I do not want to swear, but who the fuck were the De Stefanos in the 1970s? They had killed a certain Sergi for four oxen, for a fraud of four oxen in Modena ‚Ä¶ These were the De Stefanos. They committed petty fraud for four cows, ‚Ä¶ then with cigarettes.‚Äù The De Stefano brothers would come to prominence as members of the clan of Domenico Tripodo, the old capobastone of Reggio Calabria, who had acquired considerable financial resources through tobacco smuggling. Within two years (as a result of the First 'Ndrangheta war in 1974-1976) they moved from being simple 'Ndranghetisti to being the new \\"lords\\" of Reggio Calabria.Paoli, Mafia Brotherhoods, pp. 50-51 They won a monopoly of construction work in northern Reggio Calabria, moving the rival Tripodo group out of the market of public work contracts with the support of the Piromalli and Mammolito cosche.Arlacchi, Mafia Business, p. 156 They also robbed a shipment of smuggled tobacco belonging to Tripodo. Relazione mafie nel Lazio: Le famiglie mafiose operanti nel Lazio, LiberaInformazione Paolo‚Äôs brother Giovanni De Stefano was killed in 1974 and his other brother Giorgio was wounded. The attack triggered the First 'Ndrangheta war. Tripodo was arrested in February 1975 and incarcerated in the Poggioreale prison in Naples. He was killed with the help of Camorra boss Raffaele Cutolo, the boss of the Nuova Camorra Organizzata (NCO) who worked with the De Stefano‚Äôs in drug trafficking., Nisio Palmieri, Dossier della Fondazione Cesar e dell‚ÄôAssociazione Sicurstrada per conto della Consulta Nazionale dei Consigli Regionali Unipol Assicurazioni Political connections The De Stefano brothers had connections with the political right in all its political expressions (that is, from the official party, the Movimento Sociale Italiano, up to the extra-parliamentary movements) and actively supported them in the organisation of the revolt that took place in Reggio Calabria in 1970 against making Catanzaro the regional capital.Godson, Menace to Society, p. 42 He also supported prince Junio Valerio Borghese and his plans for a neo-fascist coup. The so-called Golpe Borghese fizzled out in the night of December 8, 1970. In the second half of the 1970s, he co-founded with Girolamo Piromalli La Santa, a branch of the Italian 'ndrangheta Born with the purpose of establishing permanent contacts between the Freemasonry, the mafia and political world. De Stefano entered in a masonic lodge in order to better take care of business and political interests.Nicola Gratteri e Antonio Nicaso, Fratelli di sangue. Storie di boss e affari dell'ndranghetaMario Guarino, Poteri segreti. L'intreccio inconfessabile tra 'ndrangheta, massoneria e apparati dello stato His cousin Giorgio De Stefano was prosecuted and jailed for his activity as mediator between the Freemasonry-mafia and a set of prominent Italian politicians. Paul supported his cousin, the lawyer Giorgio De Stefano, to be elected for the Christian Democrat party (DC - Democrazia Cristiana). After the First 'Ndrangheta war, De Stefano became one of the undisputed bosses of Reggio Calabria, and attracted significant police attention. He was convicted in the maxi trial against the 'Ndrangheta in 1979 (known as de Stefano+59 trial) and sent into internal banishment, a legal measure to dislodge mafiosi from their home towns. He fled to France and in 1983 he was arrested in Cap d'Antibes on the C√¥te d'Azur. However, due to pre-arrest bail (Italian: libert√† su cauzione), release on ground of health and being a fugitive, he did not spend many days in jail. Second 'Ndrangheta war A second 'Ndrangheta war was triggered by the marriage between Giuseppina Condello ‚Äì the sister of the Condello brothers, underbosses of De Stefano ‚Äì and Antonio Imerti, the leader of a neighbouring 'ndrina in Villa San Giovanni. The conflict exploded in 1985, two years after the marriage and saw practically all the ‚Äòndrine in the city of Reggio Calabria grouped into either one of two opposing factions. De Stefano had become fearful of the new alliance that might challenge his power base.

Nixon Theater  From December 7, 1903 until April 29, 1950 the site of the Regional Enterprise Tower was home to the original incarnation of the Nixon Theater built by Samuel F. Nixon-Nirdlinger and Senator George T. Oliver. On opening night it was described as the \\"world's most perfect playhouse\\". An ornate Beaux Arts structure, crowned by a large dome it was arguably the most opulent theater in city history. S. Trevor Hadly in Only in Pittsburgh describes that the interior \\"was in the Louis XVth style. Inside were massive imitation Parawazza marble columns capped with solid gold. ... The side walls were paneled to look like damask silk ... framed in a molding and styling of green, gold, and red. Velvet and silk draperies added profusely to the d√©cor.\\" Productions such as the 1905 staging of Ben Hur used four horse-drawn chariots while Garden of Allah \\"called for a herd of camels, horses, and goats and 50 camel drivers.\\" The sale of the site to Alcoa in 1950 was met with protests, with actress Katharine Hepburn writing to the city before demolition: \\"I'm infuriated, The new skyscraper will be just another building  maybe fascinating, but not glamorous.\\" A second smaller and less glamorous incarnation carried the Nixon Theater name at 956 Liberty Avenue until 1976. That playhouse had opened in 1914 and previously operated under the names \\"The Victoria\\", \\"The Shubert\\" and \\"The Senator\\" but was renamed and refurbished by September 1950.

An element of this later appointment is said to have been to keep an eye on his successor Robert Birley. Early life Elliott was born in India, the only child of Sir Charles Alfred Elliott (1835‚Äì1911), the Lieutenant Governor of Bengal, and his second wife, Alice Louisa. Sir Charles had three sons and a daughter from a previous marriage. From Rokeby School, Claude Elliott was elected a King's Scholar of Eton College in 1902. He had an undistinguished scholastic career at Eton, but on going up to Trinity College, Cambridge, he discovered a natural bent as an historian, taking his BA in 1909, and becoming a Fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge in 1910, and a Tutor in 1914. On 17 June 1913 he married Gillian (d. 1966), the daughter of Frederick Turner Bloxam, chief Chancery Registrar, with whom he had a son, John Nicholas Rede Elliott (1916‚Äì1994), who worked in Military Intelligence during and after the Second World War, and who was awarded the US Legion of Merit for his services to the Office of Strategic Services.D. H. Macindoe, ‚ÄòElliott, Sir Claude Aurelius (1888‚Äì1973)‚Äô, rev., Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, (2004) First World War As a boy, Elliott enjoyed mountaineering, which interest he practised in Britain, Switzerland, and France, hoping one day to climb the Caucasus and the Himalayas, but he was prevented from pursuing this by a fall in the Lake District in 1912, which broke his kneecap and damaged his hand. These injuries did not stop him climbing, but they prevented active service in the First World War. Instead, Elliott served in a Red Cross unit in Flanders in 1915, after which he spent the remainder of the War at the Admiralty, being appointed OBE in 1920 for his War service. After the War he returned to Jesus College, where he served on the University's Financial Board, the General Board, and the Council of Senate.The Times, Obituary, 24 November 1973. Eton College Elliott was Head Master of Eton College from 1933 to 1949. His had been an unlikely selection. For example, he was the first Head Master of Eton who was not in holy orders, and neither his preaching in chapel nor his teaching in school were as impressive as those of his charismatic predecessor, Cyril Alington. However, he was an effective headmaster who was respected by the school's governing body for his sound judgement and his administrative skill. He was known to his students as 'The Emperor', because of his imposing presence and his coolness towards the majority of his pupils. Elliott made no significant changes to the school, believing that the selection of good and effective teachers was the school's best way forward. During World War II, some parents suggested that Eton should be moved to a location safe from the bombs of the enemy. If London's poor could not move from London, said Elliott, the Etonians would not move from Eton. Later, in 1940, two bombs did actually fall on Eton, only just missing a library full of studying boys, but this only made him more determined to stand firm. Elliott never did move the school. In 1949, after sixteen years as Head Master, Elliott was appointed Eton College's Provost, a post he held until 1965. During his fifteen years as Provost he launched an appeal to rebuild and modernise the College. He was responsible for the replacement of the shattered glass in the chapel windows with designs by Evie Hone and John Piper. As Provost it was said that he had done more for the fabric of the school than any of his predecessors for five centuries.The Times, 10 December 1973. Later years On his retirement, Elliott continued mountaineering, living in Buttermere where he could see the mountains he loved so well. He was personally acquainted with all the famous climbers of his time. He made forty visits to the Alps, and numerous other expeditions in Wales, the Lake District and Skye. Had it not been for his earlier climbing injuries he would have taken part in the Everest expeditions of 1921‚Äì24. Elliott was President of the Alpine Club from 1950‚Äì52. in that capacity, he selected John Hunt to lead the successful 1953 Everest expedition. Elliott was a successful oarsman, being a member of the Leander Club. He was knighted in 1958. He died at his home, Lower Gatesgarth, Buttermere, on 21 November 1973 aged 85.

Emotion. = Independent and interdependent selves = Markus and Kitayama distinguished between independent and interdependent selves, and among the different types of social contexts that give rise to these different ways of being a self or an agent. Selves in European American middle class contexts, for example, tend to emphasize independence and to view people as fundamentally separate individuals, unique, influencing others and their environments, free from constraints, and equal to others. Selves crafted in more interdependent national contexts such as Japan, by contrast, tend to view people as fundamentally relational, similar to others, adjusting to their situations, rooted in traditions and obligations, and ranked in hierarchies.Kitayama, S., & Markus, H. R. (2003). Models of agency: Sociocultural diversity in the construction of action. In V. Murphy-Berman & J. Berman (Eds.), The 49th Annual Nebraska symposium on motivation: Cross-cultural differences in perspectives on self (pp. 1‚Äì57). Lincoln, NE: University of Nebraska Press. Markus, H. R. (2017). American = Independent? Perspectives on Psychological Science, 12(5), 855‚Äì866. People in all contexts become selves through their interactions with others and the social context. The difference rests with the nature of their relationships with others and their contexts. With former students and colleagues, Markus validated the distinction between independent and interdependent ways of being with many laboratory studies comparing people in middle class European American contexts with those in East or South Asian contexts, showing, for example how cultural contexts influence choice, i.e., what is chosen, what choice means, the consequences of exercising choice or having choice denied, and how the opportunity for expression of preferences through choice is particularly characteristic of European American middle class contexts.Savani, K., Markus, H. R., Naidu, N. V. R., Kumar, S., & Berlia, N. (2010). What counts as a choice? U.S. Americans are more likely than Indians to construe actions as choices.

Perspectives of Hurricane Katrina observers and survivors. Psychological Science, 20, 878-886. Markus was among the first in social psychology to investigate social class as a significant cultural context and reveal how the ideas and practices of well-resourced middle or upper class contexts tend to foster independent selves, while ideas and practices common in less resourced, low income or working class contexts tend to foster interdependent selves. These studies also illuminate the powerful role of mainstream institutions in the U.S, such as universities, in fostering independent ways of being.Stephens, N., Markus, H. R., & Townsend, S. (2007).

Daedalus, 148(3), 19-45. = The culture cycle = Their research conceptualizes cultures as multilayered cycles of individuals, interactions, institutions, and ideas. Different blends of these culture cycles create different forms of agency. As described by Markus and Conner, the culture cycle is a model that represents culture as a system of four interacting layers. Culture includes the ideas, institutions, and interactions that guide individuals‚Äô thoughts, feelings, and actions. From the left side, the ideas, institutions, and interactions of an individual‚Äôs mix of cultures shapes the ‚ÄúI‚Äù, so that a person thinks, feels, and acts in ways that reflect and perpetuate these cultures. From the right side, I‚Äôs (i.e., individuals, selves, minds) create (i.e., reinforce, resist, change) cultures to which other people adapt. The ‚Äúindividuals level‚Äù is the usual focus of psychologists and includes thoughts, beliefs, attitudes, feelings, emotions, biases, motives, goals, identities, and self-concepts. The ‚Äúinteractions level‚Äù is the part of the culture cycle in which most people live their lives. As people interact with other people and with human-made products (artifacts), their ways of life manifest in everyday situations that follow seldom-spoken norms about the right ways to behave at home, school, work, worship, and play. The next layer of culture is made up of the ‚Äúinstitutions‚Äù level,‚Äù within which everyday interactions take place. Institutions spell out and formalize the roles for a society and include government, religious, legal, economic, education, and scientific institutions. The last and most abstract layer of the culture cycle is the ‚Äúideas level,‚Äù and it is made up of the pervasive, often invisible, historically derived and collectively held ideologies, beliefs, values, narratives and mindsets about what is good, right, moral, natural, powerful, real and necessary. These ideas inform institutions, interactions, and ultimately, the I‚Äôs. Culture cycles are embedded in ecological systems, and all of the systems  within the individual and without  are coevolving. Markus and Conner analyzed eight cultural divides that are consequential for people‚Äôs answers to the universal questions of identity and belonging (i.e., ‚Äúwho am i/are we?‚Äù). These include: East versus West, Global North versus Global South, men versus women, rich versus poor, whites versus people of color, businesses versus governments and nonprofits, liberal religious groups versus conservative religious groups, and coasts versus heartlands. Using a blend of experiments, surveys, and analyses of cultural products, they show that one set of culture cycles (i.e., those of the West, the Global North, men, the rich or middle-class, whites, businesses, liberal religious groups, and the coasts) tend to promote independence, while the culture cycles of the less well-resourced and less powerful sides of these divides tend to promote interdependence. Any given person‚Äôs social orientation toward independence or interdependence will depend on that person‚Äôs mix of these culture cycles and on which ones are salient at a given time or situation. Given the hegemony of independence in American ideas and institutions, along with the historical dominance of color, culture and gender blindness, the more interdependent tendencies that arise from intersections of national culture with social class, race and ethnicity, and gender may go unrecognized and can be misunderstood and stigmatized.Adams, G., Estrada-Villalta, S., Sullivan, D., & Markus, H.

Psychological Review. = Race and diversity = Markus has also explored concepts of race, ethnicity, diversity, colorblindness and multiculturalism. With literary scholar Paula Moya, she examined what race and ethnicity are, how they work, and why achieving a just society requires taking account of them. In their book, Doing Race, they emphasize that race is not something that people or groups have, or are, but rather a set of actions that people do. Specifically, race is a dynamic system of historically-derived and institutionalized ideas and practices. She has studied both the pride and prejudice consequences of racial identities, mixed racial identities, and the role of narratives and practices of colorblindness and multiculturalism.Brannon, T.

De ludo scachorum (), also known as Schifanoia (\\"Boredom Dodger\\"), is a Latin-language manuscript on the game of chess written around 1500 by Luca Pacioli, a leading mathematician of the Renaissance. Created in the times when rules of the game (especially the way queen and bishop move) were evolving to the ones known today, the manuscript contains over a hundred chess problems, to be solved ‚Äì depending on the problem ‚Äì using either the old or the modern rules. The long-lost manuscript was rediscovered in 2006 and gathered public attention in 2008, following the plausible suggestion that the chess pieces in its illustrations were designed or perhaps even drawn by Leonardo da Vinci. Discovery The manuscript was discovered in 2006 by book historian Duilio Contin, in the 22,000-volume library of the Palazzo Coronini Cronberg in Gorizia, Italy. The owner, Count Guglielmo Coronini, bought it alongside other old books from an unnamed \\"Venetian poet and bibliophile\\" in 1963. The manuscript gathered public attention in February 2008, after Franco Rocco, who was researching the work, suggested that the chess pieces in diagrams illustrating it were designed or perhaps even drawn by Leonardo. History and contents Pacioli created the manuscript at the beginning of the 16th century, soon after a new way of movement for queen and bishop was introduced to the rules of chess in the 1470s, making those pieces considerably stronger. In addition, pawn promotion became more dangerous, since getting an additional queen now had bigger impact on the game. The forty-eight-page manuscript contains over a hundred educational positions and chess problems, drawn in red and black, featuring both the original and the new rules, the latter known as a la rabiosa (meaning \\"angry\\" in Spanish), a reference to the enhanced powers of the queen. =Possible involvement of Leonardo da Vinci= It is plausible that Leonardo da Vinci had a hand in the representation of the chess pieces. Pacioli and Leonardo were friends, and Leonardo is known to have provided illustrations for Pacioli's book De divina proportione (English: About the Divine Proportions). De ludo scacchorum was created somewhere after 1499, when they both fled from Milan to Mantua (after the former was invaded by Louis XII of France), where they were protected by the chess-loving Isabella d'Este, to whom the manuscript is dedicated. It has been noted that the artistic quality of initial representation of the pieces at the start of the book, where they are drawn in array, appears to be superior to that found in the later diagrams. It is plausible that Leonardo may have created the \\"original designs\\" featured at the beginning, while the pieces illustrating the rest of manuscript were drawn by someone else. The design of the queen is remarkably similar to the form of a fountain drawn by the artist in his Codex Atlanticus, a twelve-volume, bound set of drawings and writings. Furthermore, the pieces were drawn using both left and right hands, and Leonardo is known to have been left-handed. The proportions of the pieces follow the principle of the golden ratio, a phenomenon which fascinated both the polymaths. Modern analysis Chess theoreticians analyzed Pacioli's knowledge of the subject after one of the problems from the manuscript was published first by The Guardian and later elsewhere, including Raymond Keene's column in The Times and Susan Polgar's blog. It was unclear whether the position was supposed to be played using the old or the new rules; furthermore, the diagram included a white pawn on the first rank (on the d1 square), an illegal position. Keene surmised that the problem should be solved using modern rules, while the pawn should be replaced with a white knight, as it was most likely drawn mistakenly. Based on this personal interpretation, Keene described the puzzle as \\"fiendishly difficult\\" and \\"highly advanced for its time\\", while Richard Eales noted \\"nothing like this puzzle has so far been found in other publications, or the older manuscripts or printed chess books\\". Keene considers the author a \\"chess genius\\", because of how he was able to quickly develop a deep understanding of the way the new rules will change chess. He also believes that it is possible Leonardo created some of the problems in the manuscript, including the one presented by The Guardian.

The Lord of Universe Church is actually a later development of the former, established in the 1980s. These religions focus on the worship of the \\"Heavenly Deity\\" or \\"Heavenly Emperor\\" (TiƒÅnd√¨ Â§©Â∏ù), on health through the proper cultivation of qi, and teach a style of qigong named Tianren qigong.Micollier, 1998.

Tiandiist bodies =Holy Church of the Heavenly Virtue= The origins of the Holy Church of the Heavenly Virtue (Â§©Âæ∑Âú£Êïô TiƒÅnd√© sh√®ngji√†o) go back to Sichuan in 1899, with the alleged resurrection of a young boy named Xiao Changming (Ëï≠ÊòåÊòé, 1896-1943) who had apparently died three days earlier. After his revival, he declared that he had received Heaven's mandate (tianming) to save humanity from suffering. He embarked on a successful religious career and attracted a large following. In 1937 he established his headquarters on Mount Huang in southern Anhui province where he died in 1943. Like other sects, Xiao Changming's movement was suppressed in China after 1949, but survives in Taiwan and Hong Kong. In Taiwan, one of Xiao's disciples, Li Yujie, eventually decided to walk his own path and founded a new group called the Lord of Universe Church in 1978, which diverges doctrinally in several aspects from the mother group, yet also sees itself in the tradition of Xiao Changming's teachings. Currently, there exist two regional organizations for this religion. Its Hong Kong headquarters is located at Castle Peak in the New Territories. In Taiwan the religion's situation is characterized by disunity, with several separate organizations claiming to continue original Xiao's teachings. =Lord of Universe Church= Tiandi church under construction in Miaoli County, Taiwan. The Lord of Universe Church (Â§©Â∏ùÊïô TiƒÅnd√¨ jiƒÅo) is based in Taiwan and is devoted to the Tiandist beliefs as proclaimed by Li Yujie. It is an offshoot of the Holy Church of the Heavenly Virtue and it emphasizes chanting, traditional medicine, and a form of meditation which it calls \\"quiet sitting\\" in English. Li Yujie (1901-1994) was born in Suzhou. He worked in the Guomindang but left in 1958 to ensure political independence for his fledgling newspaper. In 1980 he claimed he was given permission by God to retransmit the message of the Heavenly Deity, which emphasize nuclear disarmament and Chinese unification. His book, The Ultimate Realm, was translated into Japanese and English under his guidance.Ownby, 2020. See also * Tian * Xiantiandao * Chinese folk religion * Taoism * Confucianism Bibliography  D.

Mission statement What MONU has been aiming at since the very beginning is exploring every kind of urban aspect, everything that appears around the city. The magazine was always intrigued to find out the hidden political, social and economic truths, formal realities and interdependencies in cities. Opinions MONU is generally critical of the fact that often urban spaces only fulfill the wishes and dreams of a powerful minority, who neglect the needs of most other people. MONU criticizes the consequences of a financially powerful elite developing real estate projects in cities merely to accommodate their consumerist desires. (#12 in 2010) The magazine also dismisses the lack of interest among architects and urban designers in dealing with the enormous potential of the existing urban material and topics such as urban and architectural restoration, preservation, renovation, redevelopment, renewal or adaptive reuse of old structures as socially irresponsible and economically and culturally unacceptable. (#14 in 2011) MONU disapproves of the non- ideological - or better post-ideological - conditions of our society when it comes to cities and aims for a new sincerity that is needed in a world consisting of a multiplicity of choices and urban outcomes without a single consistent urban ideology.

An interest in cricket resulting from the nation's success in Test cricket and participation in the Cricket World Cup overshadowed the past fame in the nation's football legacy. However, this did not affect football's popularity. More and more football tournaments are being organised in and outside Dhaka than of any other sports and football fever grips the nation during every FIFA World Cup. Federation officials and experts are still hopeful about the development of football in the country within the next ten years despite huge financial obstacles, inadequate technical adaptation and lack of professionalism.  History  During the liberation war in 1971, football was the way to create international awareness about the war of independence. The Swadhin Bangla Football Team was established which played 16 matches in India and was officially received by the BFF in 2009. The period before the 1990s saw national soccer fever in league football, specifically in the Dhaka League, which possessed club teams which were famous both at home and abroad. League football was popular even before independence, from the 1940s to 1960s under Pakistan. There were quite a number of premier football clubs in Dhaka. in the 1940s, the most prominent being Dhaka Wanderers, Victoria SC, Wari Club, Mohammedan SC, EP Gymkhana, Railways, and Fire service. A match between East Pakistan Governors XI vs. West Bengal XI was held at Dhaka in the late forties. The first Dhaka League was won by Bangladeshi Victoria SC in 1948, three years prior to the Mother Language Movement while still under Pakistani rule. Dhaka League was very prestigious in the South-Asia and Asia itself. Many of Dhaka league teams went on to become among the most successful teams in the Asian continent (mostly between the 1970s to the early 1990s). The league also went as far as having players from top European teams. Football was played both in the domestic leagues and abroad. Bangladeshi clubs such as BKSP and Bangladesh Red played with success in international football tournaments like Aga Khan Gold Cup, President Gold Cup, Dana Cup and Gothia Cup. BKSP won the later two in 1990 while Bangladesh Red were runners-up in the first President Gold Cup in 1981 and won it in 1989. Except that, Bangladeshi clubs bagged three more titles abroad: Quaid-E-Azam Trophy of Pakistan in 1985, Four-nation invitational tournament of Myanmar in 1995 and Jigme Dorji Wangchuk Memorial Football of Bhutan in 2003. Bangladesh's best player of all time is Kazi Salahuddin, who played professional football in Hong Kong in 1979, and is now president of the BFF. After the establishment of BFF (Bangladesh Football Federation) in 1972, the national team played their first international match against Thailand in the 1973 Merdeka tournament in Malaysia. After its membership with FIFA in 1974 and the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), the national team participated in the 1980 AFC Asian Cup and the 1986 FIFA World Cup qualifiers. But the nation's best results came at South Asian level where it won the SAFF Championship once and were gold medalists in South Asian Games twice. The last ten years saw a series of managerial changes in the national team and many famous coaches were appointed like the Austrian Gy√∂rgy Kott√°n and German Otto Pfister, who coached Ivory Coast to qualification of their first FIFA World Cup finals in 2006. However, in 2006, Bangladesh reached the quarterfinals of the AFC Challenge Cup under Argentine coach Andres Cruciani and in 2010, Bangladesh won the 11th South Asian Games on home soil under the Serbian Zoran ƒêorƒëeviƒá, who left in February the same year. 6 September 2011 was the most unforgettable moment of Bangladeshi football. Lionel Messi and his national team Argentina, played a friendly match against Nigeria at Bangabandhu National Stadium. Bangladeshi footballers were privileged to see the match and practic Bangladeshi footballers were encouraged and motivated by Argentine footballers. They believe Bangladesh football can go far ahead if world class facilities are brought into the footballing system. On 4 April, Bangladeshi football legend Kazi Salauddin was re-elected as the president of Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF).He has been enlightening Bangladesh football since he took the charge of the BFF board. He took the first initiative of Bangladesh Super League known as \\"Koti Takar League\\". His initiations attract international players as well as highly rated international coaches. On 4 November 2018, Bangladesh national under-15 football team won the 2018 SAFF U-15 Championship, defeating Pakistan national under-15 football team in the final.https://www.samaa.tv/sports/2018/11/bangladesh-defeat-pakistan-to- win-2018-u15-saff-championships/  Governing body  The Bangladesh Football Federation (BFF) was established on 15 July 1972 as the governing body, and has been a member of the FIFA since 1974 and AFC in 1973. The federation is responsible for organising all club championships and the professional league. It is currently working with AFC's Vision Asia programme to improve the domestic football infrastructure. The BFF is presided by Kazi Salahuddin since April 2008.  Clubs, leagues and championships  =Clubs= Successful ones among earlier clubs were BKSP and Dhaka Wanderers, Victoria SC, Wari Club, East Pakistan Gymkhana and Azad SC. Among a total of 4,100 clubs, the most renowned clubs today are namely Abahani Limited, Mohammedan SC, Muktijoddha SKS, Brothers Union, Sheikh Jamal Dhanmondi Club and Sheikh Russel KC. =Domestic tournaments= * Bangladesh Premier League, formerly known as B.League, is the national pro league and the top-tier league in Bangladeshi football. Before that, the Dhaka League was the most renowned and top-tier football league. * Bangladesh Championship League is the second-tier league in Bangladesh. * National Football Championship (Bangladesh) was the semi-pro football league replaced by the pro league in 2007 as the top-tier league. * Federation Cup is the top national cup competition. * Super Cup is the highest budgeted football tournament organised by BFF. Other regional leagues include the Dhaka League, Chittagong League, Rajshahi League, Cox's Bazar League and the Comilla League. =International tournaments= * SAFF Championship * AFC Challenge Cup * South Asian Games * AFC President's Cup (club) * 2015 Sheikh Kamal International Club Cup (club) =Former players= * Kazi Salahuddin * Sheikh Aslam * Sayeed Hassan Kanan * Syed Abdus Samad * Kaiser Hamid * Md. Monwar Hossen * Aminul Hoque * Rajani Kanta Barman  National team achievements   Women's football  In a country whose population is predominantly Muslim, there is some resistance towards women's football. The women's game has struggled to gain a foothold in Bangladesh in the past and many tournaments dedicated to women have failed. Women's football finally saw light in Bangladesh when the first ever women's football tournament was staged under the Vision Asia programme in November 2007. Eight teams from different districts all over the country took part in the tournament and made it a success amidst security threats. In October 2008, first women's school football tournament was held under the Vision Bangladesh programme with BFF hopeful of continuing and developing the women's game in the country. Women's football was included in the 2010 South Asian Games hosted in Dhaka, while the first Women's SAFF Championship was to be held that December in the country. Bangladesh had their first women's national team in the AFC U-19 Women's Championship qualifiers with India, Jordan and Iran in their group.
