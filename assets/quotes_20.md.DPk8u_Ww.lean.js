It has been a Grade II* Listed Building since 1970. It has served as the offices of the High Commission of Canada in the United Kingdom since 1925.  History  The building which would later become known as Canada House was built between 1824 and 1827 to designs by Sir Robert Smirke, the architect of the British Museum.Major contest launched for overhaul of London's Canada House Architects Journal, 15 March 2013 It was originally two buildings used by the Union Club and the Royal College of Physicians. Under the leadership of High Commissioner Peter Charles Larkin the Canadian government acquired the Union Club in 1923 for the sum of ¬£223,000.Canada House ‚Äì the Government of Canada's showpiece for close to a century Canada International It was Larkin's intention to centralise the work of 200 Canadian employees scattered among offices in Victoria Street in one central building. Renovations cost $1.3 million CDN and were supervised by the architect Septimus Warwick, who moved the main entrance from Trafalgar Square to Cockspur Street. The designers imported Canadian furniture, carpets and maple and birch flooring. The exterior was reclad in Portland stone to match the facade of the Royal College of Physicians. The building was officially opened on 29 June 1925 by King George V. When he declared Canada House open, King George said: \\"Canada is a great country: alike in the literal sense of vast extent from 'sea to sea' and great in achievement and in promise: and it is right and necessary that its official representatives here should be housed in a manner worthy of the Dominion and adequate to the discharge of their ever-growing and important duties.\\" During the London Blitz, a bomb fell near the building, only away from future Canadian prime minister Lester B. Pearson, who was the secretary to the High Commissioner at the time.Canada House, circa 1941, after the London Blitz Canada increased its presence by acquiring the future Macdonald House, located at 1 Grosvenor Square in Mayfair, in 1961.Good riddance to Grosvenor Square: Canada House is our real home The Globe and Mail, 29 November 2013 In 1993, Canada House was closed by the Canadian government as a cost-cutting measure with the intention of selling it. A change of government in Canada saw this decision reversed and renovations were planned instead, beginning in 1997. The building was officially reopened by Queen Elizabeth II, as Queen of Canada, in May 1998. To commemorate the reopening, a detachment from the 3rd Battalion, Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, came to London and mounted the Queen's Guard at Buckingham Palace.Changing the Guard The Ontario Room, Canada House Canada House was closed again in 2010 and re- opened in 2012 for the Diamond Jubilee. It was used as Canada Olympic House during the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. The main work of the High Commission, including consular, public affairs, political, trade and administrative functions was then carried out from Macdonald House in Mayfair.Passport and Services In February 2013 the Government of Canada announced that it would consolidate its diplomatic presence at Canada House and sell off Macdonald House. As part of the plan the building next door to Canada House, known as 2-4 Cockspur Street, was acquired by Canada in 2013 (until this date 2-4 Cockspur Street served as headquarters of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport). The building at 2-4 Cockspur Street was constructed between 1926-29 for Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada and had served as the Canadian Army's overseas headquarters in London during World War II. Over the next two years 2-4 Cockspur Street and Canada House were renovated. As part of the renovation, 2-4 Cockspur Street was joined to Canada House in July 2014. In November 2013 Macdonald House was sold, although as part of the transaction the diplomatic staff was permitted to stay until the renovations to Canada House were completed and the diplomatic staff did not move to Canada House until December 2014.Canada.com ‚Äì Canada sells diplomatic mansion Macdonald House in London to Indian developer for $530M.

Seam Zone () is a term used to refer to a land area in the Israeli-occupied West Bank located east of the Green Line and west of Israel's separation barrier, populated largely by Israelis in settlements such as Alfei Menashe, Ariel, Beit Arye, Modi'in Illit, Giv'at Ze'ev, Ma'ale Adumim, Beitar Illit and Efrat. As of 2006, it was estimated that about 57,000 Palestinians lived in villages located in enclaves in the seam zone, separated from the rest of the West Bank by the Wall (according to the ICJ Wall Case opinion). The United Nations estimated that if the series of walls, fences, barbed wire and ditches is completed along its planned route, about a third of West Bank Palestinians will be affected‚Äî274,000 will be located in enclaves in the seam zone and about 400,000 separated from their fields, jobs, schools and hospitals. The Supreme Court of Israel ordered changes to the barrier route to reduce the number of people leaving or affected by the seam zone‚Äîaccording to the court verdict the number now stands at 35,000. In July 2006, B'Tselem forecast that 8.5 percent of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, would be situated in the seam zone. This area also contains ninety-nine Israeli settlements (including twelve in East Jerusalem) in several densely populated areas near the Green Line‚Äîareas that Geneva Accord suggested could be transferred to Israel as part of a mutually agreed land-swap with the Palestinians. The Seam Zone is home to some 381,000 Israeli settlers (192,000 in East Jerusalem). Purpose According to the Israeli officials, the decision to create the zone involved multiple reasons. Among them was, \\"The need to create a \\"buffer zone\\" by distancing the Barrier from the homes of Israelis living nearby, whether they be in communities in Israel or in the settlements.\\"Under the Guise of Security: Routing the Separation Barrier to Enable Israeli Settlement Expansion in the West Bank. B'Tselem - The Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories. According to the State Attorney's Office, \\"this buffer zone is vital to strike against terrorists who are liable to cross the Barrier before carrying out their scheme.\\" Another consideration cited is the need to \\"defend the forces protecting the barrier by running the route in areas that cannot be controlled [topographically] from east of the barrier.\\" It is contended that due to the topography of the area, running the entire Barrier along the Green Line, \\"would not enable protection of the soldiers patrolling the Barrier, who would find themselves in many cases in a lower topographical position.\\"HCJ 4825/04, Muhammad Khaled 'Alian et al. v. The Prime Minister et al., Response, Section 469, section 64 =Legal structure and permit system= The seam zone is designated as a \\"closed area\\" for persons other than Israelis and Jews abroad by way of a military order, the IDF Order Regarding Security Regulations (Judea and Samaria) (No. 378), 5730-1970, Declaration Concerning Closing an Area no. S/2/03 (Seam Zone),PLO- NAD, Israeli Military Order Declaring West Bank Land Between Israel's 1967 Border and the Wall as a ‚Ä≥Closed Zone‚Ä≥. Accessed January 2014International Court of Justice - Legal consequences of the construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory - Written Statement submitted by Palestine, 30 January 2004, p. 364. issued on 2 October 2003. The order stipulates that \\"no person will enter the seam area and no one will remain there\\". The regulation does not, however, apply to Israelis. For the purposes of the order, an \\"Israeli\\" is defined as \\"a citizen of the State of Israel, a resident of the State of Israel registered in the population registry in accordance with the Population Registry Law and anyone who is eligible to emigrate to Israel in accordance with the Law of Return.\\" The day prior to the issuing of the military order, the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a Cabinet Communique which explained that the establishment of the seam zone was of the \\"utmost importance,\\" citing also the \\"strong security need for building a security barrier in the 'seam zone' and in the 'Jerusalem envelope'.\\" Photo of a tasrih, the work permit required for Palestinian residents living in or near the Seam Zone Palestinians who live near the seam zone are allowed to enter and stay if they possess a written permit, ta·π£rƒ´·∏• () in Arabic, authorizing permanent residence. Palestinians who are not residents of the seam zone can apply for personal permits provided they have a specific reason. Permits must be applied for in advance. There are 12 different categories of personal permits, including for farmers, employees, business owners and employees of the Palestinian Authority. Specific criteria for the acceptance or refusal of personal permits is not outlined in the regulations. Permit holders must apply for special permission if they wish to travel by automobile, bring in goods or stay overnight in the seam zone. Even those holding permanent or personal permits are limited to crossing the barrier at the single gate specified in the permit. Personal permits granted, including those issued to farmers who wish to access their land, are often only valid for a limited period. Access to the seam zone for permit holders is further limited by the specific operating regimes of the gate in question. Procedures and their opening hours differ from gate to gate and are not always entirely predictable. According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), in July 2005, 38% of the applications for a permit were denied. Israeli and Palestinian human rights groups have noted that there is an increasing tendency to grant permits only to registered landowners and their direct descendants. The workforce in the labour-intensive Palestinian agricultural sector is therefore often excluded. Combined with the restrictions faced even by permit holders, there is an increasing tendency for land in the seam zone not to be cultivated. Under Israeli law, land areas not cultivated for three consecutive years can be confiscated and declared \\"state land\\". According to the UNOCHA, much of the land in the seam zone has already been declared \\"state land\\". Criticism Human rights groups, including those in Israel, have challenged the legality of both the separation barrier and the seam zone under international law. For example, in a petition to Israel's Supreme Court, the Israeli non-governmental organization Hamoked (Center for the Defense of the Individual) stated that, > \\"the web of the Declaration and the Orders has spun, in the seam zone, a > legal apartheid, which is intolerable, illegal and immoral. In other words, > the discriminatory and oppressive topographical structure stands upon a > shameful normative infrastructure, unprecedented in Israeli law.\\" Towns and villages in enclaves in the seam zone As of 2010, the separation barrier is not yet completed in all areas. According to the official map published by the Israeli government,http://www.securityfence.mod.gov.il/Pages/Eng/seamzone_map_eng.htm the following Palestinian towns and villages will lie west of the completed or planned separation barrier: * Barta'a enclave (north of Tulkarm): includes Barta'a Sharqiya, Umm ar-Rihan, Khirbet 'Abdallah al-Yunis, Khirbet Ash-Sheikh Sa'eed, Khirbet al-Muntar al-Gharbiya, Khirbet al-Muntar ash-Sharqiyya, and Dhaher al-Malik * Bir Nabala enclave (northwest of Jerusalem), also includes Beit Hanina, al-Judeira, and al-Jib * 9 villages in the Bethlehem area: Battir, Husan, Nahalin, Wadi Fukin, Al Jab'a, Khirbit Zakariyya, Khirbit Al Ballouta, Khallet 'Afana and Al-Walaja The localities of Khirbet Jabara (near Tulkarm), Azzoun, Ras Tira, Dab'a, Wad Rasha and Arab a-Ramadeen (all near Qalqilya) were originally planned to be west of the barrier. Subsequently, the Supreme Court of Israel ordered a re-routing of the barrier to place these localities east of the barrier. Qalqilya and the Hableh area (including Ras Atiya and Izbat Jalud) are strictly speaking not enclaves, as narrow strips of land connect them to areas east of the barrier. Periodically the Israeli military employ checkpoints to restrict access to these areas for security reasons. References External links *Humanitarian Atlas - West Bank & Gaza Strip.

The Ottomans were invited by Karlo Thopia to support him in his feud against Bal≈°a II.  Background  In 1372, Bal≈°a II married Komnina, the daughter of John Komnenos Asen, the Despot of Valona. As a dowry, Bal≈°a gained the cities of Valona (modern Vlor√´), Berat, and Kanina (in modern-day southern Albania), located in Asen's province.Fine 1994, p. 372 In 1385 Bal≈°a II conquered Durazzo (modern Durr√´s), presumably from Karl Topia. In a charter to Ragusa issued in April 1385, he called himself \\"Duke of Durazzo\\". The expansion of Bal≈°iƒá's realm into Epirus brought him to the frontline against the Ottomans. Being aware of Ottoman aspirations to his territory, on 8 August 1385 Bal≈°a II asked Venetians to support him with four galleys.  Battle  Karlo Thopia invited the Ottomans to support him in conflict with Bal≈°a II. Thopia's invitation was accepted and Hayreddin Pasha brought his forces from the region of Ohrid (modern-day Macedonia) to Saurian field, near Lushnj√´. News about the incursion of the Ottoman forces into the region of Berat reached Bal≈°a II while he was in Durr√´s. According to Mavro Orbini, Bal≈°a II rounded up one thousand men in Durr√´s and, ignoring the advice of his nobles, headed out to take on the Ottoman raiders. Unsurprisingly, Bal≈°a's small forces had little success and Bal≈°a II was killed. Orbini's work is the only source that mention Ivani≈° Mrnjavƒçeviƒá as participating in this battle. Some scholars believe he did not even exist, while others believe that he was not an independent medieval lord, but a loyal member of the Bal≈°iƒá family.Veselinoviƒá, Andrija & Lju≈°iƒá, Rado≈° (2001). –°–†–ü–°–ö–ï –î–ò–ù–ê–°–¢–ò–à–ï, –°–†–ï–î–ä–û–í–ï–ö–û–í–ù–ï –î–ò–ù–ê–°–¢–ò–à–ï Another person mentioned only by Orbini is Bal≈°a's voivode ƒêuraƒë Krvavƒçiƒá, described as a brave warrior who also died in this battle. Mavrini explains that the body of Bal≈°a II was decapitated and his head taken to Hayreddin Pasha.  Aftermath  Since the Ottomans were victorious, most of the local Serbian and Albanian lords became vassals.Sedlar, Jean W. East Central Europe in the Middle Ages, 1000-1500, University of Washington Press, p. 385 Immediately after this battle Thopia recaptured Durr√´s, probably under the Ottoman suzerainty. The Ottomans captured Kruj√´, Berat, and Ulcinj and soon retreated from them keeping only Kastoria under their permanent control. Some sources explain that Ottomans probably remained in Berat with the intention to use it as a foothold to capture Vlor√´. The work of Mavro Orbini (The Realm of the Slavs) is one of the main primary sources about this battle. It contains many incorrect and imprecise data. Another primary source about the Battle of Savra is Marin Barleti who explained that Bal≈°a II was brave and idealistic. This battle set the foundation for centuries-long Ottoman presence in this part of the Balkans. Serbian historian Stojan Novakoviƒá emphasized that the battle's importance for these Serbian and Albanian lords was comparable to that of the Battle of Marica and Battle of Kosovo together. The important result of this battle was the influx of Albanians into Ottoman forces who had been a significant source of its strength during the next 527 years.

His late father, Mark Burgess who died of Motor neurone disease, was also a rugby league footballer who played for Nottingham City, Rochdale Hornets, Dewsbury and Hunslet; whilst his mother Julie is a teacher, currently employed at The Scots College in Bellevue Hill, Sydney.http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney- confidential/meet-the-magnificent-mrs-burgess/story-fni0cvc9-1226690449682 His younger brothers Sam, Tom and George play professional rugby league with the South Sydney Rabbitohs, while Sam previously played rugby union for Bath Rugby. He attended Heckmondwike Grammar School to receive a secondary education before becoming a professional rugby league footballer. He played his junior rugby for Dewsbury Moor, and also played for Liversedge Cricket Club. Professional playing career Luke Burgess with the Super League trophy in 2009. =Super League= Burgess played for the Leeds Rhinos having previously been on loan to Harlequins RL and Doncaster. He made his first appearance for Leeds in defeat at Castleford Tigers in March 2008. Burgess' d√©but game was against Castleford Tigers at Wheldon Road, Leeds lost this game. Burgess scored his first try on his second game against Harlequins RL. At the end of the 2008 season, Burgess became the inaugural winner of the Albert Goldthorpe Rookie of the Year Award, presented by the leading trade newspaper, Rugby Leaguer & League Express. In 2009, Burgess played in 28 games, however, he only scored one try for the club against Salford City Reds, compared to five tries from only five appearances in 2008. He played in the 2009 Super League Grand Final victory over St. Helens at Old Trafford. On 21 June 2011 it was confirmed that Luke had signed for the South Sydney Rabbitohs, joining brothers Sam and George at the club who play in the Australian NRL Brother Tom Burgess came later. =National Rugby League= During the 2011 NRL season Burgess was named to make his NRL d√©but for Souths having been in Australia for less than two weeks. In May 2013, model Yolanda Hodgson who had been a contestant on Australia's Next Top Model in 2011, gave birth to the couple's first child, daughter Grace Luca. In August 2013, the Burgess brothers became the first set of four brothers to line up in the same Australian side since Ray, Roy, Rex and Bernard Norman played for Sydney's Annandale club in the 1910 NSWRFL season. In 2015, he joined the Manly Warringah Sea Eagles, after being granted an early leave by the South Sydney Rabbitohs, after an incident at a club after the Rabbitohs' high-altitude training camp in Arizona, United States. It was alleged that a doorman working at an Arizona bar had told Burgess and South Sydney captain John Sutton to leave as they were intoxicated. Sutton allegedly became restless and Burgess got into a fight with the bouncer. Images were released of the pair handcuffed. The bouncer eventually dropped all charges after reaching an agreement with the two players.

The name was eventually changed to Noisy Mothers which aired Nationwide in 1994 and 1995 and the format of the show changed. The show was axed in late 1995, to make way for an overhaul of scheduling. Origins Before the advent of rock-focussed satellite television stations such as MTV2 and Kerrang, heavy metal & rock music in general got very little airplay on British National Network television. Featuring live performances, music videos, interviews and competitions (all with a heavy metal theme) the show aired in the early hours of Saturday mornings (sometime between Midnight and 3:00am), and sought to redress the balance. Before Raw magazine got involved, the show was known as The Power Hour, originally presented by Dante Bonutto and Amanda Redington, and later by Alison Craig, Jacky Lynn and Nikki Groocock. It used to be shown from 1985 to 1990 on cable and satellite music channel Music Box, which stopped being a channel on its own to become producer of music shows for major British broadcasters including ITV. The theme tune of Raw Power was an edited version of the guitar solo from \\"Love in an Elevator\\" by Aerosmith. The show was filmed at The Marquee in London and on various locations across the country, in Europe and the USA. Megadeth and Pantera were also used as theme tunes on Raw Power and Noisy Mothers. Presenters Originally presented by Phil Alexander (then editor of Raw magazine) and Nikki Groocock, the show was later to feature Ann Kirk replacing Nikki Groocock in mid-1991. Ann Kirk was the producer of later episodes of The Power Hour and created and produced \\"Raw Power\\" and \\"Noisy Mothers\\". Phil Alexander was replaced by Krusher as presenter and also appeared in a segment entitled Krusher's Kouch (later in Noisy Mothers Krusher's Kosmos). The show was Directed by Andrew Nicholson and Jerry Duller. Camera work was by John Keedwell, who went on after the show closed to produce the Bon Jovi \\"Access All Areas\\", a documentary film of the world tour in 1988 to 1989. The segment would always start with Krusher's greeting of \\"Droogies, boozers, strumpets and losers\\" and featured CD reviews, competitions and irreverent comment. Krusher would usually be accompanied by a Jack Russell Terrier named Bullseye (who died in 1995). Later editions also featured various bands presenting the show, including The Almighty, Thunder, Alice Cooper, Megadeth, Iron Maiden and Mot√∂rhead and later on Noisy Mothers, Sepultura, Pride & Glory, Extreme, and Paradise Lost. Raw Power/Noisy Mothers would film band performances and cover the major rock festivals such as Donington Monsters of Rock and Reading. Bands performances filmed include The Black Crowes, Blind Melon, and Megadeth. Raw Power and Noisy Mothers won \\"Best TV Show\\" category in all the Rock Music Magazines in Britain during its run on ITV.

It starts at Aldersgate in the City of London, passing through the capital to Borehamwood on the northern fringe of Greater London, before continuing to Edinburgh. The road travels through the City and three London boroughs: Islington, Haringey and Barnet, which include the districts of Islington, Holloway, Highgate, Hendon and Mill Hill, and travels along Upper Street and Holloway Road, crossing the North Circular Road in Hendon, a district in the London Borough of Barnet. The A1 is the most recent in a series of routes north out of London to York and beyond. It was designated in 1921 by the Ministry of Transport under the Great Britain road numbering scheme, comprising existing roads and streets, mostly historic, and later using stretches of purpose-built new roads in what is now the outer London borough of Barnet. The Archway Road section was built by Thomas Telford using Roman cement and gravel, an innovative technique that was used there for the first time, and is the basis for modern road building. The route closely follows the historic route of the Great North Road, though from 1954 it has diverted round the congested suburbs of Finchley and High Barnet along modern roads constructed in the 1920s and 1930s. The A1 is one of London's main roads, providing a link to the M1 and the A1(M) motorways, and on to the Midlands, Northern England and Scotland. Despite this, its main use is to connect a number of neighbourhoods within north London; less than 5% of its vehicles are through traffic ‚Äì the bulk is local. The roads along which the A1 route travels are the shared responsibility of the local boroughs, the Greater London Authority, and the British Government via the Department for Transport. History The start of the A1 in London at the time of classification in 1921 The A1 is the latest in a series of routes north from London to York and beyond, and was formed in 1921 by the Ministry of Transport as part of the Great Britain road numbering scheme. The earliest documented northern routes out of London are the roads created by the Romans during the period 43 to 410 AD, which consisted of a variety of \\"Iters\\" on the Antonine Itinerary, a combination of which were used by the Anglo-Saxons as the route from London to York, and which became known as Ermine Street. Ermine Street later became known as the Old North Road, and is used within London by the current A10. By the 12th century, because of flooding and damage by traffic on Ermine Street, an alternative route out of London was found through Islington and Muswell Hill, and this was the origin of the Great North Road that would become the A1. Until the 14th century the route went up what is now Hornsey Road ‚Äì the A103 road, but when that became impassable a new route along Holloway Road via Highgate was created in the 14th century. The section through Highgate was bypassed in the early 19th century by the creation of a new road, Archway Road, and around the same time a turnpike road, New North Road and Canonbury Road (the A1200 road), was constructed linking the start of the Old North Road around Shoreditch with the Great North Road at Highbury Corner. The route of the A1 in London originally started at Aldersgate Bars, which marked the boundary of the City of London, and followed the Great North Road mail coach route through Barnet; the route was re-designated in 1954 to follow the East Finchley and Barnet by-passes built in the 1920s and 1930s, so within London the coaching route is now mainly only followed when passing through the borough of Islington. During the early 1970s plans to widen the A1 along the Archway Road section were abandoned after considerable opposition and four public inquiries during which road protesters disrupted proceedings. The scheme was finally dropped in 1990. Governance Responsibility for the roads along which the A1 route travels are shared by the individual local boroughs, the Greater London Authority (GLA), and the British Government. The first organised London-wide authority dealing with roads in London was the Metropolitan Board of Works (MBW), set up in 1856. The MBW replaced the disparate turnpike trusts which had already been amalgamated in 1826 into the single control of Government Commissioners, and was itself replaced by the London County Council (LCC) in 1889. The LCC became the Greater London Council (GLC) in 1965, and during the 1960s when traffic management in London was being modernised, and the London Ringways was proposed, the GLC, which was not in favour of increasing traffic into central London, had control of the inner London roads, while the government, through the Ministry of Transport, which was in favour of widening roads, had control of outer London. These different approaches resulted in the Ministry of Transport widening a stretch of the A1 until it reached the control of the GLC, when the widening abruptly stopped. Due to the problems associated with two different and opposing bodies having responsibility for London's roads, the government were keen to take control of the major routes, and made plans in 1983 for the Department of Transport to take over 70 miles of road, including significant parts of the A1; when the GLC was abolished in 1986, the Department of Transport took over direct control of the 70 miles of major routes, plus had a significant influence on another 300. In 2000 control of roads in London passed to Transport for London, a department of GLA created in 2000 as part of the Greater London Authority Act 1999, and the major roads, including the A1, were declassified as trunk roads. Route The current route of the A1 (red) and the historic route of the Great North Road (blue) The route of the A1 in London runs from the northern end of St. Martin's Le Grand in the City to Borehamwood in Hertfordshire, then travels on the northern fringe of Greater London to Bignell's Corner, where it crosses the M25 and becomes a motorway, designated A1(M), which alternates with the dual carriageway A1 as it continues to Edinburgh. The London section of the road passes through part of the City of London and three London boroughs: Islington, Haringey and Barnet. The A1 is one of London's main northern routes, providing a link to the M1 motorway and the A1(M) motorway, and on to the Midlands, Northern England and Scotland. It connects a number of major areas within London, and sections of it serve as the High Street for many of the now-joined villages that make up north London. Even though it is one of London's major roads, less than 5% of its approximate 60,000 vehicles a day are through traffic ‚Äì the bulk is local. The current start of the A1 is the modern roundabout at the northern end of St. Martin's Le Grand where it meets Aldersgate Street, near the site of the now demolished General Post Office, London, the headquarters of the Post Office from 1829 to 1910. When originally designated in 1921 the A1 started a little further north along Aldersgate Street at Aldersgate Bars, which marked the boundary of the City, though some later maps indicate it starting at the southern end of St. Martin's Le Grand, near St Paul's Cathedral. The route runs north from Aldersgate along Aldersgate Street which is a modern dual carriageway, and from the 13th century was known as a wide street with fine buildings and travellers' inns; these were destroyed or badly damaged during the Blitz, and from 1965 to 1976 the 40 acre (162,000m¬≤) Barbican Estate, an arts complex and residential estate, was constructed along the entire eastern side of the street. At the end of Aldersgate Street stood Aldersgate Bars, which marked the limits of the City of London. =Islington= The route enters the London Borough of Islington at Goswell Road becoming a single carriageway running north from the border of the City to Angel through a mix of offices and urban housing. Goswell Road and St John Street were the ancient routes from the City to Islington, with St John Street being the start of the Great North Road until the General Post Office headquarters was built at St Martin's-le-Grand in 1829, whereafter stagecoaches used Aldersgate Street and Goswell Road.Norman W. Webster (1974) The Great North Road: 22‚Äì23 The New River originally flowed down the centre of Goswell Road, but is now underground and no trace of it can be seen at the surface. The street was reported in 1720 to be \\"meanly built and inhabited\\", containing numerous inns and brothels, and it largely remained a slum area until the rebuilding that took place after the Second World War, and in particular the residential development that spread out from the Barbican since 1980. The Peacock Inn by James Pollard, one of several travellers' inns that were on Islington High Street from the 16th to 19th centuries At the northern end of Goswell Road, the route northwards follows a one-way section to the Angel, turning right into Islington High Street. The southwards route from Islington High Street follows City Road for a short distance before joining Goswell Road via Wakley Street. The earliest reference to Islington High Street is its appearance on a 1590 map of the area. At this time, nine inns (including the Angel, which subsequently gave its name to the area), as well as housing and a public pond were shown lining the street. The Peacock Inn, one of the nine inns, and which operated on Islington High Street from 1564 to 1962, was where Tom of Tom Brown's Schooldays stayed prior to travelling to Rugby School. In 1716 Islington High Street came under the control of the newly formed Islington Turnpike Trust. The Trust grew rapidly and soon had control of most major roads in the area, building a number of major road arteries through the expanding residential areas, including Caledonian Road, Euston Road, City Road and New North Road. Upper Street, running roughly north from Islington High Street to Highbury Corner, is the main shopping street of Islington, and dates back to at least the 12th century. Livestock herded along the Great North Road for Smithfield Market, would ‚Äì when passing through what was mainly fields and farmland ‚Äì pause at lairs built between Upper Street and Liverpool Road by an enterprising farmer, Richard Laycock; Laycock's lairs would be used in 1861 for the site of the Royal Agricultural Hall, and a number of pubs and shops existed along the street to serve farmers and travellers headed for Smithfield. In the 18th century, Upper Street began to develop from an agricultural to a residential area. Ten houses were built in 1768 (later named Hornsey Row), and a further group built immediately south of Hornsey Row in 1792. Liverpool Road, originally called Back Road, was used as an alternative to Upper Street for the Smithfield herders, and both streets have a \\"high pavement\\" constructed to protect pedestrians from being splashed by the passing animals; in places, the pavement is approximately 1 m above the road surface. After reaching the eight-way interchange at Highbury Corner, the A1 turns north-west as Holloway Road. Until the 14th century the route turned off along what is now Hornsey Road ‚Äì the A103 road ‚Äì to go through Muswell Hill, but when that became impassable a new route along Holloway Road via Highgate was created in the 14th century. The earliest record giving the name of the road as the Holloway dates from 1307. The main stretch of Holloway Road runs through the site of the villages of Tollington and Stroud. The exact time of their founding is not known, but the earliest record of them dates from 1000. The names ceased to be used by the late 17th century but are still preserved in the local place names \\"Tollington Park\\" and \\"Stroud Green\\"; since that time, the area has been known as Holloway. The northern point of Holloway Road is the complex interchange at Archway. The construction of the interchange left a few buildings isolated in the centre of the roundabout, including the Archway Tavern, which appears on the cover of the Kinks' 1971 album Muswell Hillbillies. =Haringey= John Nash's original bridge over Archway Road After the Archway roundabout, the A1 enters a cutting, and becomes Archway Road. The original road north went up the very steep Highgate Hill (now the B519) to the village of Highgate. By 1808 this was proving unsuitable for increasingly heavy traffic, and a road, crossing the hill through a tunnel at a shallower gradient, was proposed by a mining engineer, Robert Vazie; a turnpike trust ‚Äì the Highgate Archway Company ‚Äì was set up and work started in 1810. The brick built tunnel collapsed during construction on 13 April 1812, and John Nash constructed a brick bridge, using a series of arches like a canal viaduct, to carry Hornsey Lane over what was now a cutting. Nash's Archway Bridge, a little way south of the current bridge, and the new Archway Road were opened in 1813, though the road surface, being constructed of sand and gravel, proved difficult for heavy traffic. Parliamentary Commissioners took over the road, and John Benjamin Macneill, chief engineer to Thomas Telford, proposed using Roman cement and gravel, an innovative technique that was used for the first time on Archway Road, and is the basis for modern road building. The construction was financed by tolls which were abolished in 1876 ‚Äì traffic increased substantially thereafter, particularly after the introduction of trams on the road. Between 1897 and 1900, Nash's bridge was replaced with the present cast-iron Hornsey Lane Bridge, designed by Sir Alexander Binnie, accessible from the Archway Road level by a steep flight of steps. Hornsey Lane Bridge, designated a Grade II listed building by English Heritage in 1972, is informally called \\"Suicide Bridge\\" as it is a known suicide spot. It was the venue for the mental illness campaign group Mad Pride's inaugural vigil in 2000, and was the subject of Johnny Burke's 2006 film The Bridge. When, at the end of 2010, three men in three weeks committed suicide by jumping from the bridge, a campaign was set up by local residents for better anti-suicide measures to be put in place. Hornsey Lane and the bridge marks the boundary between the Inner London Borough of Islington and the Outer London Borough of Haringey. The A1 (Aylmer Road, left) diverging away from the original Great North Road (right) An inquiry was held into widening the section from the Archway intersection to the Hornsey Lane Bridge to a three lane dual carriageway in 1969 and work started in 1971. It was originally intended to widen a further section of the road, but severe disruption led to the first inquiry being abandoned in 1978, and a second inquiry in 1984, chaired by Air Marshal Sir Michael Giddings, was also abandoned. The traffic flow was projected to increase to 180,000 cars a day by 1981, but by 1986 the actual flow was only 30,000 a day. When originally constructed, Archway Road went through countryside with few buildings - though by 1828 the Woodman pub at the junction with Muswell Hill Road, and the now demolished Wellington pub at the junction with North Hill provided refreshments to travellers; however, with the coming of the railways in 1867 ribbon development started along the road, including the Camra Heritage listed Winchester Tavern with the distinctive attached parade of shops and house with deep arched eaves built by the Imperial Property Investment Co in 1881. At the northern end of Archway Road, the road re-intersects with the traditional Great North Road route (at this point called North Hill). The roads almost immediately re-diverge, with the Great North Road route heading north as the A1000 towards Finchley, Whetstone and Barnet and the A1 heading west as Aylmer Road. Aylmer Road is a very short stretch of road, running west for less than half a mile between the junction with the A1000 in Haringey to the junction with The Bishops Avenue in Barnet. The entire southern side of the road is taken up by Highgate Golf Course, while the northern side is a mixture of small shops, flats and allotments. The road is named after Sir Fenton Aylmer, who received the Victoria Cross for his part in the assault on Nilt Fort on 2 December 1891. =Barnet= View west along Lyttleton Road After crossing The Bishops Avenue, the A1 becomes Lyttelton Road, which was laid out in 1931 as part of the residential development of the area, and runs east‚Äìwest along the northern foot of Highgate Hill between Hampstead Garden Suburb and East Finchley. It is for the most part residential; on the northern side stands the Belvedere Court block of flats. Built with the road in the 1930s, the building is now Grade II Listed as an example of 1930s architecture. After passing playing fields to the south, the A1 briefly becomes Market Place, a former street market that has evolved into a short stretch of shops, then becomes Falloden Way ‚Äì built between 1914 and 1924 as part of a programme of planned extensions to Hampstead Garden Suburb, and runs on an embankment due to a dip in the ground caused by Mutton Brook, a tributary of the River Brent, which runs parallel to the road immediately to the south for its entire length. The north side of the road is occupied by 1930s housing blocks, whilst the southern side is occupied by a narrow strip of parkland following the brook, and by the northern tip of Big Wood and Little Wood ‚Äì two of the few surviving remnants of the ancient woodland that once covered what is now north London. The A1 merges with the North Circular Road (A406) and the two routes run briefly together, crossing over the Henlys Corner interchange. Henlys Corner is a junction with the 1820s turnpike road, Finchley Road, which was built to provide a by-pass to the route north from London through Hampstead; the name changes to Regents Park Road on the northern, Finchley, side of the junction. The junction had an ¬£8 million upgrade completed in January 2012, which included Britain's first \\"hands-free\\" pedestrian crossing to allow Orthodox Jews to reach the nearby Finchley Synagogue, one of Europe's largest, without operating machinery on the Sabbath. While a synagogue has stood on the site since 1935, the current building dates from 1967. A406. This junction was modified in 2011 to provide extra filter lanes. After the Henlys Corner interchange, the routes diverge, with the A406 going south to Brent Cross, while the A1 turns north-west as Great North Way through the leafy suburbs of Mill Hill and Hendon. Great North Way, built in 1926, joins Watford Way carrying the A41, completed in 1927, at Fiveways Corner, and in 1970 a junction with the M1 motorway was created. The A41 and A1 continue together as Watford Way via Mill Hill Circus to Apex Corner, where they separate, with the A41 turning west, and the A1 turning to run straight north. After passing Apex Corner, the A1 runs north and out of London as the dual carriageway Barnet Way / Barnet Bypass. This dual carriageway was part of a 1920‚Äì4 road improvement programme that was mentioned in parliament in 1928 as hopefully being completed by the end of that summer. The northbound carriageway passes the entrance to Scratchwood, an area of ancient forest which is now a local nature reserve, then crosses the A411 from Watford to Barnet at the Stirling Corner roundabout. A proposed link road at this roundabout, estimated at ¬£22.8m in 1987, would have provided access to the M1, but the plans were subsequently abandoned. The link had been planned during discussions for the Hendon Urban Motorway, which was intended to carry the M1 all the way down to Hyde Park Corner as part of the London Ringways scheme; the interchange would have been junction 3 on the motorway; which is currently the unnumbered junction for London Gateway services. Past Stirling Corner, the A1 skirts Borehamwood, before turning northeast and running through open countryside to Bignell's Corner. At Bignell's Corner the A1 crosses under the M25 motorway at a large roundabout near South Mimms services. North of Bignell's Corner the A1 becomes the A1(M) motorway for a while, and follows the Great North Road route, running north to Edinburgh. Construction The A1 route was designated in 1921 by the Ministry of Transport under the Great Britain road numbering scheme. Through the inner boroughs of the City, Islington, and Haringey it uses existing roads and streets; when it reaches what is now the outer London borough of Barnet, some stretches of purpose-built new roads were built, and others have been widened and made into dual carriageways. In 1828, John Benjamin Macneill, chief engineer to Thomas Telford, used Roman cement and gravel to solve problems with wear and tear on the Archway Road section of what is now the A1, an innovative technique that was used there for the first time, and is the basis for modern road building.

The primary role played by EROs are to check out any reported incident locally and assess the situation. If deemed appropriate the professional emergency services like the police, ambulance and/or fire brigade will be called up and the EROs will facilitate the access of the professional services to the right location and provide the initial briefing. This is very important as the EROs are local to a building or complex and are normally able to reach the location of a reported incident before the professional services can get there. The first few minutes are crucial and any assistance provided in that period can be the difference between the life and death of a victim. The response team consists of security, medical and fire crew and should be conversant with alarm systems and CCTV monitoring.

The service recruited only men born before 1910 (although younger men were eligible if they had been certified unfit for military service) who had previous experience in the building industry. They signed on for a year at a time and were paid top building industry rates.

Broadcasting on Channel 32 exclusively on Charter Spectrum systems in the Milwaukee and Green Bay/Fox Cities areas, the channel launched in February 2007. This is not to be confused with WACY, Green Bay's actual broadcast Channel 32, which airs on Spectrum channel 83 on its northeastern Wisconsin systems. The channel featured a mix of local sports roundtable discussion shows, UW-Milwaukee Panthers sporting events, programs featuring the former sports directors of several local television stations and newspapers, coaches' shows, high school sports, and other minor professional sports within the Milwaukee and Green Bay franchise areas of Spectrum. Until 2013 the network also aired Marquette Golden Eagles sports, including men's college basketball games from ESPN Plus, rebroadcasts of ESPN Marquette games, other Marquette sports, and archived Marquette sports programming; this was discontinued that year due to the new Big East Conference contract with Fox Sports 1 which will see some games sub- licensed to Fox Sports Wisconsin locally, and the athletic department considering taking their coach's shows online-only or discontinuing them altogether. The Horizon League also moved to a mix of airing their games through ESPN+ and Stadium (the latter sometimes simulcast by WVTV's \\"My 24\\" subchannel), leaving the network without much college game programming. The network also had rights through Time Warner Cable/Spectrum's 'official cable partner' designation to carry programming produced by and revolving around the Green Bay Packers. On May 18, 2016, Charter completed its merger with Time Warner Cable, after an earlier attempt by Comcast to merge with Time Warner had failed the year before, placing the network and Time Warner Cable's Milwaukee operations under the control of Charter. As a result, it and the other ex-TWC RSNs rebranded under the umbrella of Spectrum Sports. Replacement with Spectrum News 1 Wisconsin The channel was never added to Charter's legacy systems in Wisconsin. This was due to Spectrum launching a statewide 24-hour news channel, Spectrum News 1 Wisconsin; a lack of sports job postings for the effort suggested that the content of Spectrum Sports would be merged into the new effort, with a relocation of the rebranded channel space to Channel 1 statewide. This was confirmed by Spectrum in October 2018, and Spectrum Sports ended autonomous operations before the launch of the new Spectrum News channel on November 27 at 6 a.m., using space in Spectrum's downtown Milwaukee headquarters. Time Warner planned to launch \\"Time Warner News Wisconsin\\" in the mid-2000s before deciding not to launch a news channel at the time and focus on a more scalable local sports channel. The network continued with archived content for the next month, going off the air late on December 31, 2018.  Programming  The following shows were broadcast and produced by the network: *The Roundtable ‚Äì A roundtable show featuring Spectrum Sports' Sports Director Dennis Krause and state sports journalists.

His goalscoring form won him a move to Dundee United where he kept up his prolific record, netting fourteen goals in just nineteen league games. This included scoring a hat-trick against Hamilton Academical in his first match for club.

However, by November 1960 he had dropped out of the first team line-up.

It was loaned into Old Latin via Etruscan as ', in Classical Latin taking the form ', the Roman triumph where the victorious general takes the role of Dionysus as leader of the procession, later associated with rather than Dionysus. Arrian traces the custom to Alexander the Great when he states (Anabasis 6b.28): > Certain authors have said (though to me the statement seems incredible) that > Alexander led his forces through Carmania lying extended with his Companions > upon two covered waggons joined together, the flute being played to him; and > that the soldiers followed him wearing garlands and sporting.

The term's etymology is connected with the word \\"fig leaf\\" by Aemilius Luetcke (1829) who refers to the epithet \\"of the fig tree\\" of Dionysus. An old hypothesis is that the word is borrowed from Phrygian or Pelasgian, and literally means \\"Dreischritt\\", i. e., \\"three-step\\", compare iamb and dithyramb, but H. S. Versnel rejects this etymology and suggests instead a derivation from a cultic exclamation. From the time of Roman Greece (2nd century BC), the Greek term increasingly narrows to a translation of Latin triumphus. In Modern Greek, is used in the same generalized meaning as English triumph.

For its performance by a local artist - a requirement for all songs in contention to become the Latvian Eurovision entrant - it was decided to take the song in a different vocal direction than the female vocal on its demo: Platforma Records (lv) assembled a sextet of classical-style male vocalists who were dubbed Bonaparti.lv, with Jennstig's original song being customized for an operatic act by having its lyrics rendered in Italian - by Francesca Russo and Torbj√∂rn Wassenius - and a consequent re-entitling as \\"Questa Notte\\".

Barbu sings about the need to \\"fight\\" in order \\"to face this cruel world\\", and sings that this is in fact the only way to get ahead.

In 1937 it moved to a former chapel in Goldington Street, also in Somers Town in the London Borough of Camden. Although the theatre was destroyed by fire in 1975, productions continued sporadically until 1994, when the site was sold for social housing.\\"The View from stage Left\\" New York Times review 28 January 1990 accessed 26 June 2007 Unity Mews is today on the site and a bronze plaque commemorates the theatre. It had links to the Left Book Club Theatre Guild and the Communist Party of Great Britain.Unity Theatre archive accessed 11 May 2007 By the end of the theatre's first decade, it had spawned 250 branches throughout Britain. History The theatre grew from the Workers' Theatre Movement, formed in the East End of London. This was an attempt to bring contemporary social and political issues to a working class audience; it introduced plays by, about and for workers. The company used agitprop theatre techniques to highlight the suffering of unemployment and hunger marches in the Great Depression and to challenge the rise of Nazism in Germany and Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists. They sought to show the republican struggle in Spain.Theatre Museum on Unity Theatre accessed 11 May 2007 The company was notable for pioneering new dramatic forms, such as company-devised documentary pieces, 'Living Newspapers' and satirical pantomimes, including Babes in the Wood (whose cast included Bill Owen, Mark Cheney, Vida Hope, Alfie Bass and Una Brandon-Jones). Ann Davies appeared as Robin Hood (the Principal Boy) in a political version of the pantomime Babes in the Wood which lampooned Neville Chamberlain's appeasement policy and had her as saviour in a Russian uniform. The production ran for seven months and Montagu Slater credited the play with making real political change. The theatre also created Plant In The Sun (starring Paul Robeson, along with Alfie Bass).Unity Theatre website accessed 11 May 2007 The improvisational technique brought them into conflict with the Lord Chamberlain's Office, who retained the right to approve theatre scripts under the Theatres Act 1843. Nevertheless, the company managed to present important works throughout the 1930s, and audiences, suspicious of politics as usual, and tired of the light and fluffy entertainments designed for the upper classes, responded. There was a ban on theatre at the outbreak of war, but once lifted, the theatre remained active throughout World War II. The company also provided groups of entertainers to tour factories and air- raid shelters. In addition, there was an associated Unity Theatre School. Unity was a volunteer theatre, neither fully amateur, nor professional (apart from a short-lived professional company founded in 1946 by Ted Willis) and loosely linked to a national network. By the outbreak of World War II, there were over 250 branches throughout the country. The end of theatrical censorship in 1968 meant that mainstream theatre could perform more radical plays, and the movement fell into decline, with the London theatre closing after a fire in 1975. According to The New York Times, \\"...it finally expired in 1983 because it represented a spirit of old-fashioned opposition and could not find its place in a more strident and increasingly prosperous age.\\" Attempts were made to revive the theatre in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and for a while a studio theatre was created in Somers Town (in the space now occupied by Camden People's Theatre), but today, whilst the Unity Theatre Trust continues in London, only the Unity Theatre, Liverpool retains an active theatre under the Unity Theatre name. However, Unity Theatre Cardiff has been in continuous existence since its formation in 1942. The company left the Unity Theatre movement in 1948, and was renamed Everyman Theatre Cardiff. Despite leaving the movement, the company continues to adhere to much of the Unity ethos, and remains neither fully amateur nor professional. Notable writers and actors Unity introduced new writers, both British and international, presenting Se√±ora Carrara's Rifles (1938), the first Brecht play in Britain and premi√®res of Clifford Odets's Waiting for Lefty, Se√°n O'Casey's The Star Turns Red (1940), Strike and The Musical Adventures of Mr. Pickwick by Arnold Hinchliffe, and Jean-Paul Sartre's Nekrassov (1956). The theatre also helped popularise the plays of Maxim Gorky. Notable actors associated with Unity Theatre have included Lionel Bart, Alfie Bass, Una Brandon-Jones, Michael Gambon, Julian Glover, Jack Grossman, Harry Landis, Michael Redgrave, Herbert Lom, Vida Hope, Bob Hoskins, David Kossoff, Warren Mitchell, Bill Owen, who was then known as Bill Rowbotham, Eric Paice, Ted Willis and Roger Woddis. Bart's earliest contributions were lyrics for the revue Turn It Up. Bart also wrote the lyrics for an agitprop version of Cinderella and also wrote a revue called Peacemeal and a play called Wally Pone for the group. During the war, Ann Davies became the theatre's first woman president.

They performed across the United Kingdom and appeared at various festivals including Lounge On The Farm, BoomTown Fair, Zoo Thousand, Endorse It in Dorset, Sellindge Music Festival and the Rochester Sweeps Festival. Biography The band originally formed as a loose folk punk collective in 2004, and went through many line-up changes before arriving at its acoustic, folk-influenced sound with the addition of Hannah Ellerby on violin and French horn player Vicky Price. Despite moderate success on the UK punk scene between 2004 and 2008 including high-profile support slots with Neck, Pronghorn, The Dangerfields and The Ghost of a Thousand, Los Salvadores continued to explore the folk elements in their music, eventually deciding to go fully acoustic in early 2009. The first EP showcasing the new style was recorded at Barnroom Studios with Bernie Torme. Titled Wasps Birds and Clients, it featured four reworked songs and two new songs. Los Salvadores based many songs on Kent legends and history, such as the Smugglers Leap, and Bartholemew's Day, the story of the Battle of Sandwich (1217). The band performed at a variety of folk clubs and festivals across the UK, and shared stages with a variety of artists such as Emily Barker and the Red Clay Halo, Jez Lowe, The Bad Shepherds, Eliza Carthy and Tunng.

The name chital is not used in Sri Lanka. Its validity is disputed, and some maintain that the axis deer is monotypic (i.e., has no subspecies). Food Sri Lankan axis deer are active primarily during early morning and again during the evening, but they are commonly observed near waterholes anytime. The Sri Lankan axis deer eats primarily grasses, but it also eats fallen fruits and leaves. The Sri Lankan axis deer graze closely with langur, peacock, wild buffalo, and sambar deer. They usually lives in groups of between 10-60 animals, though herds may include up to 100 animals. Axis deer are important prey for the Sri Lankan leopard. It is also prey for sloth bears and jackals. Habitat range and conservation status A pet deer at the Veddah village outside the chief‚Äôs house These deer inhabit lowland dry forests, savannas, and shrub lands. Very rarely, these deer inhabit dry mountain areas. Unlike the mainland axis deer (Axis axis) which is plentiful, Sri Lankan axis deer populations are considered to be vulnerable. Threats include hunting for meat and deforestation. Historically, axis deer were found in very large numbers in the entire dry zone of Sri Lanka, but these numbers have been significantly reduced. Today several thousands of these deer are found in Sri Lanka.

The use of a dream world creates a situation whereby a character (or group of characters) is placed in a marvellous and unpredictable environment and must overcome several personal problems to leave it. The dream world also commonly serves to teach some moral or religious lessons to the character experiencing it ‚Äì a lesson that the other characters will be unaware of, but one that will influence decisions made regarding them. When the character is reintroduced into the real world (usually when they wake up), the question arises as to what exactly constitutes reality due to the vivid recollection and experiences of the dream world. According to J. R. R. Tolkien, dream worlds contrast with fantasy worlds, in which the world has existence independent of the characters in it.J.R.R. Tolkien, \\"On Fairy-Stories\\", p. 14, The Tolkien Reader, Ballantine Books, New York 1966 However, other authors have used the dreaming process as a way of accessing a world which, within the context of the fiction, holds as much consistency and continuity as physical reality.\\"Whilst the greater number of our nocturnal visions are perhaps no more than faint and fantastic reflections of our waking experiences... ... Sometimes I believe that this less material life is our truer life, and that our vain presence on the terraqueous globe is itself the secondary or merely virtual phenomenon.\\" ‚Äì H.P. Lovecraft, from \\"Beyond the Wall of Sleep\\", as reprinted in The Dream Cycle of H. P. Lovecraft: Dreams of Terror and Death (Del Rey, 1995) The use of \\"dream frames\\" to contain a fantasy world, and so explain away its marvels, has been criticized and has become much less prevalent.John Grant and John Clute, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, \\"Dreams\\", p. 297 Fictional dream worlds =Literature= A similar motif, Locus amoenus, is popular in medieval literature (esp. allegory and romance). A dream world is sometimes invoked in dream visions such as The Book of the Duchess and Piers Plowman. The Cheshire Cat vanishes in Wonderland. One of the best-known dream worlds is Wonderland from Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, as well as Looking-Glass Land from its sequel, Through the Looking-Glass. Unlike many dream worlds, Carroll's logic is like that of actual dreams, with transitions and causality flexible. James Branch Cabell's Smirt and its two sequels taken together form an extended dream and most of their action takes place in a dream world. The action of The Bridge by Iain M. Banks takes place in a dream world. Other fictional dream worlds include the Dreamlands of H. P. Lovecraft's Dream Cycle and The Neverending Storys world of Fantasia, which includes places like the Desert of Lost Dreams, the Sea of Possibilities and the Swamps of Sadness. Dreamworlds, shared hallucinations and other alternate realities feature in a number of works by Philip K. Dick, such as The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch and Ubik. Similar themes were explored by Jorge Luis Borges, for instance in The Circular Ruins. In The Wheel of Time book series, Tel'aran'rhiod is a dream world that exists in close proximity to the real world. Objects and physical locations that do not frequently change in the real world have parallels in Tel'aran'rhiod. Ordinary people can occasionally slip into Tel'aran'rhiod, and events that occur within this dream world have physical consequences. A person that dies in Tel'aran'rhiod will never wake up again, and in several cases it is shown that physical injuries gained there persist to the waking world. Tel'aran'rhiod can be controlled similar to a lucid dream, and several characters in the series can enter and manipulate Tel'aran'rhiod at will. Paprika (1993) by Yasutaka Tsutsui is a science fiction novel that involves entering dream worlds using technology. In the book, dream monitoring and intervention as a means of treating mental disorders is a developing new form of psychotherapy in the near future. Unrest ensues when a new psychotherapy dream-analysis device is stolen, allowing the assailant to enter and manipulate people's dreams. In the feminist science fiction novel The Kin of Ata Are Waiting for You, the Kin of Ata maintain the real world through their dreaming, making the real world a form of dream. =Film= In the 1939 movie, Oz from The Wonderful Wizard of Oz was altered from a fantasy world (in the novel) to a dream world of Dorothy's; characters who were independent inhabitants of Oz were transformed into dream parallels of introduced Kansas characters.L. Frank Baum, Michael Patrick Hearn, The Annotated Wizard of Oz, p. 96, In The Matrix, Neo and the rest of the humans live inside a dream world. Their brains are hooked up to a computer network that creates this dream world. However, some may argue that this is not a dream world, as it seems completely normal and indistinguishable from reality (aside from time differences). In the 1980s, the Nightmare on Elm Street series of horror films introduced a dark dream realm inhabited by the supernatural serial killer Freddy Krueger. In the movie Sharkboy and Lavagirl the main characters enter a world dreamt up by a small boy in order to save the real world. Down Town is the land of nightmares where all people who are in comas go in the movie Monkeybone. Dreamworlds also appear in Total Recall and Vanilla Sky. Paprika (2006) is an anime film adaptation of the 1993 novel of the same name, which involves entering and manipulating dream worlds using dream-analysis devices. The film Waking Life takes place almost entirely in a dream realm. In the 2010 film Inception, main characters create artificial, vivid dream worlds and bring others into the dream worlds and perform various things with their brains, without them knowing. This may involve 'Extraction' (stealing memories and secrets), 'Inception' (planting an idea into the mind) and others. =Comic books, graphic novels and animation= A panel from Little Nemo (1906). One of the earliest newspaper comic strips, recounting Little Nemo's adventures in Slumberland, had a dream world theme. Writer Neil Gaiman was tasked with re-imagining a Golden Age character, \\"The Sandman\\". In his version, the Sandman becomes Dream, the Lord of Dreams (also known, to various characters throughout the series, as Morpheus, Oneiros, the Shaper, the Shaper of Form, Lord of the Dreaming, the Dream King, Dream-Sneak, Dream Cat, Murphy, Kai'ckul, and Lord L'Zoril), who is essentially the anthropomorphic personification of dreams. At the start of the series, Morpheus is captured by an occult ritual and held prisoner for 70 years. Morpheus escapes in the modern day and, after avenging himself upon his captors, sets about rebuilding his kingdom, which has fallen into disrepair in his absence. Dream worlds also appear in Rozen Maiden, in the Outback(s) of The Maxx; in Dream Land, the main setting of many Kirby games, in the webcomic The Dreamland Chronicles, and the movie Sailor Moon Super S the Movie: Black Dream Hole also have dream realms in their universes. The American Dragon Jake Long episode \\"Dreamscape\\" takes place mainly in a dream realm. Similarly, the Xiaolin Showdown episode of the same title also uses the dream world in its plotline. In Clamp manga series such as X/1999, Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle and xxxHolic, the dream world is very important to the events that occur within each story. It is later revealed in xxxHolic that the dream world itself is its own world, as part of the Clamp multiverse. Similarly, in the Bone graphic novel series by Jeff Smith, the primary plot device is a dream world called \\"The Dreaming.\\" It exists independently from the real world, and it is described similarly to a river, being said to \\"flow\\" through people in \\"currents.\\" In JoJo's Bizarre Adventure part 3 \\"Stardust Crusaders,\\" Jotaro and his friends and grandpa are put in a dream world which takes the form of an amusement park by Mannish Boy and his Death 13 stand. In the Jay Jay the Jet Plane cartoon series, adventures where air-breathing jet planes cannot go (underwater and in space) happen as dreams. In Gravity Falls episode \\"Dreamscaperers\\" also takes place in a dream realms which characters put into a person's mindscape. In this episode, Gideon summons a dream demon, Bill Cipher to invade Stan's mind and steal the combination to the safe, which is vincindoria. Dipper Pines with his sister Mabel and friend Soos also go into Stan's mind to stop Bill from finding out the combination. =TV= The Star Trek: Voyager episode \\"Waking Moments\\" uses several dream realms and false awakenings. In the UFO episode \\"Ordeal,\\" Foster's abduction and rescue is explained away as a dream. The whole of season 8 of Dallas was retroactively explained, at the start of Season 9, as a dream had by Bobby Ewing. In the Xena: Warrior Princess episode, \\"Dreamworker\\", Morpheus, god of dreams, abducts Gabrielle to take as his bride. But Xena follows them into his realm, the DreamScape, where she battles to stop the impending forced marriage. The Doctor Who episode, \\"Amy's Choice\\" also depicts multiple dream worlds, which were found out to have been induced by a parasitic seed. Dreamworlds are revisited in the Doctor Who Christmas special, \\"Last Christmas,\\" which depicts dreams within dreams caused by mind-leeching aliens. =Video games= The video games Link's Awakening and Super Mario Bros. 2 take place in a dream of the Wind Fish's (whom Link must wake up) and Mario's respectively. Alundra revolves around a dreamwalker who can enter people's dreams. It takes place on an island, where a village has locals suffering from recurring nightmares that sometimes cause death. With his dreamwalking ability, the titular protagonist Alundra attempts to help the locals by entering their dreams. In the first two games of the EarthBound series, the protagonist (Ninten in EarthBound Zero and Ness in EarthBound) must travel to a dream world named Magicant. However, the two Magicants are different from each other. Ninten visits his Magicant, which is light pink and has seashell spires and clouds, multiple times during the story, until it is revealed to not be his own Magicant but instead just a collection of the memories of his great-grandmother, Maria. Ness's Magicant is a surreal, spacelike land in a purple sea that Ness only gains access to once he records the eight melodies into his Sound Stone, which he then must travel to the center of in order to overcome his weaknesses, characterized by a boss battle against his 'Nightmare' (with an appearance similar to the 'Mani-Mani Statue', a mysterious object encountered in another dreamworld called Moonside), and absorb the power of the Earth into his heart. About a half of Tak 2: The Staff of Dreams takes place in the Dream World, home to the Staff of Dreams, which was later split by Pins and Needles, where Tak has a half of the staff and Pins and Needles have the Staff of Nightmares half. By the end of the game, Tak restored the staff. In Dragon Quest VI: Realms of Reverie, the game is split between two worlds initially known as the Real World and the Phantom World, named such because any being from the Real World is rendered unseen by the inhabitants of the Phantom World, like a phantom, and are only capable of becoming visible after drinking a special elixir. After a time, it is revealed that the Phantom World is in fact the true Real World, while the former Real World is called the Dream World, created from the dreams of the people of the Real World, in which each inhabitant has a Dream World counterpart. In addition, the main antagonist of the game, Deathtamoor, plots to try to merge both the Real World and Dream World with his own \\"Dark World\\" in an attempt for world domination. In Dreamfall: The Longest Journey and Dreamfall Chapters the protagonist Zo√´ Castillo can travel to Marcuria by dreaming. There's a third world called 'Storytime' inspired by the Australian Dreamtime myths which is the place of the creation and where every story begins and ends. Also, the protagonist must stop a corporation called WATI- Corp which want to steal dreams and memories from people through their new entertainment device: the Dreamachine which allows people to make lucid dreams. In Final Fantasy VIII, the main group of protagonists sometimes experience the lives of three soldiers, Laguna, Kiros, and Ward in what they call \\"the dream world\\" (which is actually the past) through a mysterious and gifted woman who is acquainted with both parties. The whole of Zanarkand in Final Fantasy X and its HD remake was a dream, along with the main character, Tidus. In the video game The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, there is a short quest which takes place in a dream world. In the video game, Fallout 3, a main storyline quest involves the main character going into a virtual reality simulator, referred to as \\"Tranquility Lane,\\" a dream world simulation of a 1950s suburban neighborhood. Other dreamworlds are the Maginaryworld from Sonic Shuffle, Dream Depot from Mario Party 5, and in Nightopia and Nightmare (collectively known in a place called the \\"Night Dimension\\") from Nights into Dreams... and its sequel for the Wii, Nights: Journey of Dreams. In the video game Driver: San Francisco, main character John Tanner suffers a car accident that leaves him in a coma. The game take places in his dream, but the character himself doesn't realize he's dreaming. Instead, he thinks he had a lucky escape and with this, thinks that he got an ability to possess other people. During the game, many billboards will turn black and show \\"wake up\\" messages. the \\"dream world\\" of Mario And Luigi: Dream Team for the nintendo 3ds is rather complicated. in the game, there are stone pillows that luigi can use to summon a portal to this \\"dream world\\" so that mario can jump in and rescue the Pi'Illo creature trapped within the pillow. Mario is accompanied by a Dreamy version of Luigi named, what else, Dreamy Luigi, who possesses vast powers, notably cloning, as seen in the game's unlockable \\"luiginary attacks\\". In Pok√©mon Black and White and its following sequel, players can tuck in one of their Pok√©mon via a system known as Game Sync. As the tucked in Pok√©mon falls asleep, it will then be sent to special website, where the player can play with his/her Pok√©mon in an alternate world called the \\"Dream World\\". In Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance, the seventh installment in the game series Kingdom Hearts, the two main protagonists are sent to worlds that are in slumber and that are dreaming in order to pass the Mark of mastery exam. The Dream World is the main focus of Mario & Luigi: Dream Team where Mario and Luigi travel through a world full of Luigi's dreams. Klonoa 2: Lunatea's Veil takes place in Lunatea, a dream world. Bloodborne takes place in, or partially in, a dream realm, with areas such as the Nightmare of Mensis and the Hunter's Dream. The entire city the game takes place in is implied to be a collective, self-sustaining dream that all its inhabitants, human, mutant, and Cosmic Entity, contribute to. The game Tales of Maj'Eyal features a class called the Solipist, who believes the world is their own dream (although this is closer to the Dream argument than solipism), granting them psychic powers based on Lucid Dreaming.

Biography  Woodcroft was born in Heaton Norris, Lancashire. He was the founder of the Patent Office Library, now part of the British Library, and of the Patent Museum, whose collections are now in the Science Museum. Woodcroft was later Professor of Machinery at University College London. He married Agnes Bertha Sawyer (7 September 1833 ‚Äì 10 March 1903) in Hampstead in the September Quarter of 1866. She was born in Bosworth, Leicestershire. At this time he was 63 and she 33. They had no children. On the 1871 census they lived alone with servants, on the 1881 census she is widowed living with the cook only. Woodcroft died in 1879 and is buried in Brompton Cemetery, London. His portrait is in the National Portrait Gallery.  Work  Woodcroft patented fundamental improvements in textile machinery and ship propulsion, and this in turn led to an absorbing interest in the history of the patent procedure. As a result of a reorganisation of the British Patent Office in 1852, he became Superintendent of Specifications. This gave him the opportunity to develop a private collection of historical machinery. When the South Kensington Museum was being planned in the mid-1850s, the Patent Office, through Woodcroft, was invited to assemble a collection of industrial devices for display. When the Museum opened in 1857, the building incorporated a separate Patent Office Museum and Woodcroft remained its driving force until his retirement in 1876. A born collector, Woodcroft displayed a passion for securing notable items of historical machinery. 1862 was a particularly fruitful year, when due to his efforts, his museum secured Puffing Billy the world's oldest surviving steam railway locomotive (1814), Stephenson's Rocket (1829), which set the design standard for locomotives, and the engine of Henry Bell's Comet (1812), the first steamship to be operated commercially in Europe. Funerary monument, Brompton Cemetery monument A letter to his subordinate at South Kensington typifies his single-minded approach: \\"Get the Comet engine in all its filth\\" he commanded, emphasising the urgency of the quest. The Patent Office Museum also acquired several examples of stationary steam engine, including a Boulton and Watt beam engine which was the oldest surviving of its type in the world. Without Woodcroft it is doubtful that some of the most important artefacts of the first industrial revolution would have ever been preserved.  Publications  * Bennet Woodcroft. Steam navigation.

Chestnut Avenue, as its name suggests, is lined on both sides by many conker trees. At its northerly end is a public footpath, which leads between agricultural fields, and around the walls of Crosby Hall to Little Crosby. Moor Park is also home to the Northern Club, situated in Elm Avenue, who moved there in 1907 while the residential site was in its infancy. The club has continued to evolve, and has facilities for cricket, hockey, crown green bowling and squash.

More recently, Cowan is playing John Bosco Walsh on the RTE soap opera Fair City.  Early life  Rory Cowan was born in the Coombe Hospital in Dublin, Ireland, on to Rory Cowan Sr., and Esther Cowan. His parents were trade-union activists, and the Cowans lived in Dublin, Athlone and Limerick. Career Cowan's mother wanted him to go into banking, but Cowan deliberately failed his maths exam in order to avoid this. He then worked in a record shop owned by EMI, eventually becoming marketing manager of the holding company in Ireland. While there, he managed Christy Dignam and the drag act Mr Pussy, and first saw Brendan O'Carroll in performance. After being made redundant in 1992, he was asked to book an act for a venue that would bring in similar crowds to those that had accompanied Mr Pussy and Dignam; and suggested O'Carroll. As a result of this, he became O'Carroll's publicist, and has worked alongside him well into the 2010s. Soon afterwards, O'Carroll developed the Mrs Brown routine, creating the character of Rory Brown specifically for Cowan, although at first, Cowan did not take on the role as he was simply \\"the logistics man\\" who organised shows and bookings. The character of Rory Brown originally appeared in the radio slots, and was originally played on stage by another actor who resigned at short notice. As a result, Cowan, despite never having acted in front of an audience before, was asked to take on the role by O'Carroll, and his deliberately camp performance quickly became the definitive portrayal. In 2016, alongside actress Deirdre O'Kane, Cowan was signed up to the Irish version of Gogglebox, screened by TV3. On 16 June 2017, Cowan gave O'Carroll his resignation notice, and the following month announced he had quit Mrs Brown's Boys. He described his parting from the company as \\"amicable\\" and completed a stage tour of the show, but did not appear in the 2017 Christmas special. In 2019, Cowan landed a role on the RTE soap drama Fair City. Personal life Cowan is openly gay, and has often discussed his sexuality in the press and in interviews. He has lived in Kilmainham since 1990, and credits his work with O'Carroll with enabling him to afford to buy his house and achieve financial security. In December 2016, Cowan was a victim of homophobic online abuse on Twitter, which led to police reports being filed and an official investigation launched by the Gardai. No charges were laid; and while initially offended and hurt by the online statements Mr. Cowan has not claimed irreparable harm. On 12 August 2020, Cowan announced on Twitter that he had joined Fine Gael, after being persuaded by former Fine Gael TD Noel Rock.

History  It is assumed that the first cinematographic performances in Mongolia happened between 1903 and 1913, as private events for the prince T√∂gs-Ochiryn Namnans√ºren and the Jebtsundamba in the capital Urga. After the socialist revolution, the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party decided in its fifth congress of 1925 to use movies as an instrument of mass education. From 1926 on, mobile projection facilities would regularly show Soviet films to the Mongolian people. The first permanent cinema \\"Ard\\" (, people) opened in the capital (now named Ulaanbaatar) in 1934. Eventually, every aimag center would have fixed cinemas, and every sums of Mongolia or negdel would have a mobile cinema. In the 1990s, many cinemas, fixed and mobile alike, closed down or reduced activities. = Mongol Kino = The national film studios, Mongol Kino, were founded in 1935, with Soviet technical assistance. Their first productions were a documentary on the \\"47th anniversary of the 1st May\\" and a fictional story named A Mongol son (Mongol Kh√º√º) directed by the Russian Ilya Trauberg and Mongolian Demberel Baldan. The first Mongolian-directed movie was the black-and-white short feature Norjmaa's Destiny (Norjmaagiin Zam) by Baldan in 1938. From then on, the Mongolian movie production focused around heroic revolutionary propaganda and ancient popular legends, still often under Russian direction. This program was very successful with movies like S√ºkhbaatar (1942) and Tsogt Taij (1945). The studios of Mongol Kino also produced documentaries and current news reports. = 1950s and 1960s = After World War II, the party moved the focus on working-class heroes, reflected in movies like New Year (Shine Jil, 1954) by Tseveeny Zandraa. Examples of this genre are Awakening (Serelt, 1957) by S. Genden and The Rejected Girl (Gologdson kh√º√ºkhen) by Dendevyn Chimid-Osor. In 1955, the first musical comedy appeared, which started a trend that continued into the 1960s. The first color movie was The Golden Yurt (Altan √ñrg√∂√∂, 1961), based on a folktale. It was produced in cooperation with the East German DEFA studios. The music of the film, written by L. M√∂rdorj, was played and recorded by the GDR Radio orchestra and became a classic of the Mongolian symphony. As a fairy tale film, it is rich with match moving and other special effects of cinematography. = 1970s and 1980s = While the production of documentaries increased, the fictional stories turned to everyday life in the 1970s. One of the most famous movies of that time, The Crystal Clear Tamir River (Tungalag Tamir, 1970) by Ravjagiin Dorjpalam, based on the novel by Chadraabalyn Lodoidamba, is however set during Mongolia's 1921 revolution. Other well-known productions were \\"The Legend of the Mother Oasis\\" (\\"Ehe B√ºrdiin domog\\"), made in 1976 by Gombojav Jigjidsuren (–ì–æ–º–±–æ–∂–∞–≤—ã–Ω –ñ–∏–≥–∂–∏–¥—Å“Ø—Ä—ç–Ω) and Jamyangiin Buntar (–ñ–∞–º—ä—è–∞–Ω–≥–∏–π–Ω –ë—É–Ω—Ç–∞—Ä), and The Five Colors of the Rainbow (Solongiin tavan √∂ng√∂) in 1979. The Leading Wrestler Garuda (Garid Magnai, 1983) by Jamyangiin Buntar marks a turning point, where the authors liberate themselves from the existing power structures. Queen Mandukhai the Wise (Mongolian: –ú–∞–Ω–¥—É—Ö–∞–π —Å—ç—Ü—ç–Ω —Ö–∞—Ç–∞–Ω, 1987) is a Mongolian film based on a novel of the same title by Shagdarjavyn Natsagdorj (1981) and directed by Begziin Baljinnyam, marks the reflection of the political reformation movement perestroika in Mongolia. = 1990s and 2000s = After the introduction of the market economy, most mobile and permanent cinemas closed down. Mongolian productions had to seek partners outside of the former COMECON. However, some young filmmakers of the transformation period, such as N. Gankhuyag, B. Uranchimeg, J. Binder, made domestic success films. The movie \\"Genghis Khan, Under Power of the Eternal Sky\\", starring Enkhtaivan Agvaantseren was the first Mongolian-Japanese co- production. State of Dogs (Nokhoin Oron, 1998) was written and directed collaboratively by the Belgian Peter Brosens and the Mongolian Dorjkhandyn Turmunkh. The director Byambasuren Davaa has had international success with the German-Mongolian co-productions The Story of the Weeping Camel (2003, nominated for an Academy Award as a foreign documentary in 2005) and The Cave of the Yellow Dog (2005). Elsnii Nuudel (, movement of sand), was a successful movie produced for the domestic market in 2007. Later known films are Iim negen durlal, Goyoliin Daashinz, etc. The 2008 historical film A Pearl in the Forest () by director Enkhtaivan Agvaantseren is one of the first films to openly talk about events of the 1930s and the impact of the rise of Soviet communism on Mongolia. It is also one of the first films intended to present the history of the Buryats, one of the ethnic groups present in Mongolia.

The campus consists of a school for girls only in Year 7 to Year 12 and a co-educational junior school for boys and girls in Year K to Year 6, sporting grounds, and boarding facilities for 137 students. The college's brother school is Mazenod College, where many male students attending St Brigid's Primary School continue their education. History St Brigid's College was founded in 1929 by the Sisters of Mercy as an extension of the West Perth convent and college also named after Saint Brigid of Kildare. Construction of the buildings commenced in 1913 for Archibald and Maude Sanderson, and were used as a private day and boarding school for approximately 20 students.Sanderson, H.: \\"Lesmurdie: A Home in the Hills.\\" The Nine Club, 1979 In 1919, at the end of World War I, the buildings were sold to the Red Cross to be rented to the Repatriation Department to house sick and wounded soldiers. During this period the building was completed and oak trees from Windsor Castle were planted in the grounds. In 1929, the building was let to the Perth Hospital as a convalescent home. Later in that same year, it was sold to the Sisters of Mercy for A‚Ç§9,000. It was purchased by the Congregational Superior, Reverend Mother Brigid Watson. On 21 April 1929, Mother Teresa Rielly and seven Sisters took up residence with their first pupils ‚àí 35 boarders and 3-day students. In 2005 St Brigid's College was entered in the Register of Heritage Places by the Heritage Council of Western Australia. Campus St Brigid's College is located in the suburb of Lesmurdie, which is atop the Darling Scarp in Perth. The school falls into the South Ward of the City of Kalamunda. The campus has been extended over its history as funds and space have become available. A Sisters Convent and Chapel was constructed in 1965 as an addition to the original building, which has been listed on the WA Register of Heritage Places. This was followed in 1990 by the construction of a 157-person Boarding House to the rear of the campus. The McAuley Wing was constructed in 1999 as a dedicated Technology, Science and Art building. One of the college's additions is the Sister Mary Rose Fitness Centre, completed in 2002, which houses an indoor heated swimming pool, sprung dance floor and fitness equipment. The facility is available for paid use by the public. 2012 heralded the completion of the new \\"One World Centre\\", a $13 million building created on of land which was once a road that separated the Junior School from the Middle and Senior Schools, Catherine Place. The One World Centre includes a new innovative library and resource space titled the Learning Plaza, student and public administration, staff offices and facilities as well as the Wandju room, a multi-purpose hall which uses the Noongar word for \\"Welcome\\" as its namesake. In 2013, plans were announced in the Friends of St Brigid's College magazine for a new addition to the college, a performing arts facility, the building of which will commence in 2014. Curriculum St Brigid's College is an accredited International Baccalaureate \\"World School\\", meeting the standards and practices of the Primary Years Programme and the Middle Years Programme. St Brigid's College is the only IB Catholic school in Western Australia and one of only a handful overall in the state to attain this status. Community service St Brigid's contributes to the community through community service activities including school-wide projects such as fundraising and food drives on behalf of charities. Students in years 7 to 12 are also involved in a service-learning program called \\"Mercy in Action - Making A Difference\\", which encourages the spirit of mercy as espoused by Catherine McAuley, the founder of the Sisters of Mercy. This program requires students to complete a number of community service hours each year as part of their Religious Education study. Some of the suggested activities in Years 11 and 12 are blood donation, Red Cross soup patrol, peer mentoring and assisting community organisations.St Brigid's College, Lesmurdie: \\"Mercy in Action - Making A Difference\\" St Brigid's College, 2006 As part of the service-learning component to St Brigid's College, each year a group of staff and students visit a Mercy Sisters outpost in Cambodia, having raised money and donations to contribute to communities there.

In November 1945, Jackson Pollock and his wife Lee Krasner moved to what is now known as the Pollock-Krasner House and Studio in Springs in the town of East Hampton on Long Island, New York. The wood-frame house on with a nearby barn is on Accobonac Creek. History Pollock and Krasner had visited friends nearby when they found this house for sale in 1945. The price was $5,000 and Peggy Guggenheim loaned them the $2,000 down payment in exchange for artwork. At first Pollock used an upstairs bedroom as a studio. In 1946, after moving the barn to improve the view from the house, Pollock started using that building as his studio. Krasner began using the bedroom as her studio. Pollock's brother had given him a large collection of square Masonite baseball game boards, and in 1953, Pollock used them to cover the floor of the house and studio. After Pollock's death, Krasner started using the barn as her studio. Barn studio floor After Krasner died, the property was given to the Stony Brook Foundation which is administered by Stony Brook University. Conservators examined the house and studio. Underneath the Masonite squares, they discovered the original barn floor, covered in stray paint. The foundation schedules tours of the studio and house during the summer. Part of the property was donated by Krasner to The Nature Conservancy in the 1970s. The surrounding Springs neighborhood is on the National Register of Historic Places. The house and studio was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1994. In popular culture The house and studio were used in the making of the biopic Pollock (2000), starring and directed by Ed Harris.

It ran from as far south as Sneek northward to the Wadden Sea and marked the border between main Frisian regions of Westergoa (Westergo) and Eastergoa (Oostergo). Other historical names for the Middelzee include Bordaa, Borndiep, Boerdiep, and Bordena. The names like Bordine, mean \\"border\\". Pre-history Back in the Pleistocene the Boorne was a river that had a drainage basin in Friesland, Drenthe, and Groningen. It flowed from Saalien glacial till plateau in a southwest direction, and met the sea west of Het Bildt. The Boorne passed the current location of Akkrum and Rauwerd. The connection to the Wadden Sea became blocked by sand dunes in the Weichselian time period, and the mouth of the river was forced more and more easterly, until it was heading in a north- northwest direction from Akkrum. In the Holocene, the sea rose flooding the valley to form an estuary. Before 7000 years ago, the sea was rising at a rate of 0.75 meters per century, and the rising sea was faster than the sedimentation There are still estuary sediments west of Jorwerd, that were deposited during 6400-5300 before present (Mid-Atlantic). After 5500 years ago, sea level rise slowed down to a rate of 0.15 meters per century. This allowed sedimentation to catch up and fill in the estuary. Tidal inlets further to the west were blocked by sediment by 3300 years ago. However the Boorne remained open and gradually eroded further and further south and then branched west south of what is now Westergo. People started living adjacent to the channels about 600 BC. The tidal channel moved to the east to what would become the Middelzee. Before the year 900, the new tidal channel scoured deeper and deeper and flooding extended even further inland. After 900 the flooding reached its maximum extent, and it became known as the Middelzee. The southwestern extremity joined up with the Marne Estuary near Bolsward. Map of the former Middelzee in West Frisian showing dates of land reclamation Reclamation At the beginning of the 10th century people became more organised and worked to prevent the further encroachment of the Middelzee. Levees and natural marsh bars were raised along the shore north of Steins on the western coast of Oostergo. This also happened on the north west facing coast of Westergo along the Reid. During the 10th century a dyke was established along the east coast of Westergo along the coast of the Middelzee. The mother polders were established as regions of land completely encircled by dykes. The southwestern arm of the Middelzee was progressively sectioned off by building dykes across the arm, in four stages. Around 1200 AD a dyke near Rauwerd finished the closure of the arm. This turned what was a mud flat into a salt marsh, and silt gradually collected to fill the areas in. The northern section of the Middelzee, passing Leeuwarden was dyked off in the first half of the 13th century, and by 1300 it was reclaimed up to Stiens and Beetgum. The 12th century also saw land reclamation along the north west shore of Oostergo, shrinking the funnel shaped part of the Middelzee. Leeuwarden and the trading terp villages along the coast of Middelzee lost their ability to trade with watercraft when they became isolated from the route to the Wadden Zee. Gradually the Middelzee silted up, forming the nije lannen (\\"new lands\\"). One village is called Nijl√¢n, literally meaning \\"new land\\", and also there are several villages where the lands formerly of the Middelzee are still called it Nijl√¢n. It can still be recognized as new land since there are only a small number of villages lying in the area of the former Middelzee. The fertile sea clay bottom is mostly used as meadow land but also Leeuwarden Air Base is situated on the new lands. The border between Eastergoa and Westergoa in the former Middelzee is now drained by the River Zwette (West Frisian: Swette), that runs from Sneek to Leeuwarden, but which once reached the southern edge of Het Bildt. By the fifteenth century the Middelzee was reduced to a funnel shape along Frisia's north coast and further silting of the remaining part rendered it unusable. From the early sixteenth century the polder of Het Bildt was formed in that funnel, and is now a Frisian municipality that fills the mouth of what once was the Middelzee. The name Middelzee is still used as a name for an administrative coalition between the so-called Middelzee municipalities of Het Bildt, Ferwerderadiel, Leeuwarderadeel, and Menameradiel.

It is within the townland of Ballyregan, beside the A20 road. It provides acute services in the North Down, Ards and Castlereagh council areas, as well as east Belfast. It is managed by the South Eastern Health and Social Care Trust. History The hospital was first founded as the Ulster Hospital for Women and Sick Children in 1872. It was initially located on Chichester Street in Belfast City Centre but moved to Templemore Avenue in Mountpottinger in 1892. The first X-ray machine at the hospital was installed in 1920 and Dr Beath was employed to operate it. While located in Mountpottinger the hospital was severely damaged in the Belfast Blitz in 1941. In 1962 it was relocated to Dundonald and renamed the Ulster Hospital. A refurbishment programme, announced in 2001, included a renal unit (completed in 2006), a maternity unit (completed in 2007), a multistorey car park (completed in 2007) and a critical care complex accommodating theatres, laboratories and a sterile services department (completed in 2010). In February 2003 the hospital was designated as one of the nine acute hospitals in the acute hospital network of Northern Ireland on which healthcare would be focused under the government health policy 'Developing Better Services'.

The second, which replaced the first, was Directive 80/181/EEC made in 1979 and amended in 1984, 1989, 2000 and 2009. It issued a number of derogations to the United Kingdom and Ireland based on the former directive. Directive 71/354/EEC When the first units of measurement directive was issued, the six members of the EEC had been using the metric system for a hundred years or more. During that time the metric system had undergone a number of changes, particularly in science and engineering. Some industries were based on the CGS variant of the metric system and other on the MKS variant. In 1960, the CGPM published the International System of Units (SI), a coherent version of the metric system based on the MKS variant. Directive 71/354/EEC sought to rationalise the system of units within the EEC by standardising on SI. The directive catalogued the units of measure that were permitted for measuring instruments (for instance scales), measurements and indications of quantity expressed in units for economic, public health, public safety and administrative purposes. The catalogue was consistent with the SI standard. The directive explicitly proscribed a number of mainly CGS units of measure that were not to be used after 31 December 1977. The directive explicitly exempted member states from having to use those units of measure in the catalogue in situations where other units of measure had been laid down by international intergovernmental conventions or agreements in the field of air and sea transport and rail traffic. Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom joined the EEC in 1973. The directive had little impact in Denmark which was in a similar situation to the other EEC member vis-√†-vis the use of metric units. Ireland and the United Kingdom were in the process of metrication programmes and the directive was consistent with those countries policies as they stood at the time. The three new member states had five years to implement this directive (as well as all other directives that had been published by the EEC). Directive 80/181/EEC By the late 1970s the metrication programme in the United Kingdom had lost momentum. In particular the government had decided to postpone the metrication of road signs. Furthermore, the metrication of trade in many consumer areas had not been completed. The United Kingdom asked the EEC for a derogation to permit the continued use of imperial units. The result was a repeal of Directive 71/354/EEC and its replacement by Directive 80/181/EEC. The principal changes were: * A number of units that had been proscribed under Directive 71/354/EEC could continue to be used until the end of 1985. * A number of imperial units including the pound, ounce, yard, foot, inch, gallon and pint could continue to be used until the end of 1989. * The mile, yard, foot and inch could be used on road traffic signs, distance and speed measurement, pints could be used for the sale of milk in returnable containers and for the measurement of draught beer and cider, acres could be used for purposes of land registration and troy ounces could be used when dealing with precious metals until a date to be determined by the states in question. * Supplementary units were permitted until the end of 1989. =Amendments= * Directive 85/1/EEC of 18 December 1984 was a technical amendment to reflect the change in the definition of the metre and included other minor changes to the catalogue of allowable units. * Directive 89/617/EEC of 27 November 1989 changed the cutoff dates for supplementary units to 31 December 1999 and cutoff dates for those imperial units that were previously allowed were extended to 31 December 1994 for some units and to 31 December 1999 for other units. * Directive 1999/103/EC of 24 January 2000 included minor changes to the catalogue of allowable units. The cutoff date for the use of supplementary units was extended to 31 December 2009. * Directive 2009/3/EC of 11 March 2009: In 2006 it became apparent that the 2009 cut-off for the use of supplementary units could cause problems in US-EU trade. The EU Commission published a consultation document and on the basis of responses received proposed modifications of Directive 80/181/EEC which would continue the current practice by:  Permitting indefinitely the use of supplementary indications. This will ensure a continued application of the current practice and will allow continuing flexibility as regards nonmetric units when no metric units exist, e.g. binary measurements in computing (bits, bytes).  Including the new SI unit for catalytic activity (the \\"katal\\"), adopted by the General Conference on Weights and Measures.  Allowing the United Kingdom and Ireland to continue the limited exemptions concerning specified uses of the pint, mile and the troy ounce, considering absence of impact of these exemptions on cross border trade and the principle of subsidiarity; whilst repealing the exemption for the use of acre for land registration which is no longer applied.  Clarifying the scope of the Directive to be fully in line with the existing Treaties by no longer mentioning specific fields to which the Directive is applicable These amendments were published on 7 May 2009 and became effective on 1 January 2010. Public reactions =Protests in the United Kingdom= The directive, or more precisely the British legislation amended to implement the directive, was the subject of considerable controversy in the United Kingdom. In particular, some food sellers refused to comply, selling vegetable by the pound without a metric equivalent. Others used only non-metric scales or sold beer or cider by the litre and half-litre, even though the law required the use of pints. Some were convicted of offences under weights and measures legislation and became known as the \\"Metric Martyrs\\". =Reactions in the United States= In spite of the extension till 2009, the provisions of this directive, in particular the provisions prohibiting dual labelling were a cause of serious concern in the United States. In 2005 there were informal consultations between the USA and the EU. In 2006, the US Department of Commerce made US companies aware of potential problems and lobbied for a further extension of dual labelling, which would be more consistent with United States legislation, in particular the Federal Fair Packaging and Labeling Act.EU Standards/ Metric Directive ‚Äì U.S. Commercial Service Germany Commerce Department Invite Regarding EU Metric Directive 2010 US White House Federal Register: 06-8618 =Consultations in 2007= In the light of the impending termination of the acceptance of non-metric units as supplementary units in 2009 and in view of the extension of the SI system at an international level (especially in the United States), the European Commission decided in 2007 to consider amendments to the directive and initiated consultations with interested parties, including the United States government.> The United States raised serious concerns concerning mutual trade and incompatibility with US legislation, such as the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act. There was also concern as to how the directive would be interpreted.EU Metric Directive Update http://www.scte.org/documents/standards/bulletin/Winter20062007.pdf Other organisations also voiced criticisms.Units and Measurements Question Many organisation, such as the AeA (formerly the American Electronics Association) advocated a continuation of \\"dual labelling\\".http://www.aeanet.org/Forums/SubmissiontoconsultationonMetricLabellingDirective27_02_07.asp Eurosceptic groups in the UK, such as the United Kingdom Independence Party also expressed concern.http://www.ukipcambs.co.uk/news.php?subaction=showfull&id;=1161333116&archive;=&start; from=&uca;=3&TB;=home6 Other US trade organisations pointed to incompatibilities with US legislationAASA Events‚ÄîArticle Detail and noted that the directive applies not just to labelling but also to advertising, instruction manuals, etc.MEMA Publications The report on the consultations lists other problems in the United States. Many different groups and individuals contributed to the consultations on amendments to the directive carried out in 2007. The majority of private individuals who responded were in favour of ending the use of supplementary indications.http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/prepack/unitmeas/uni_ms_result-a- priv_person.htm However, without exception the European and American industry federations and individual firms who responded were in favour of retaining supplementary indications for another ten years or indefinitely. They pointed to conflicting federal law in the United States that would have necessitated relabelling. All member states who responded were also in favour of extending supplementary indications. =Response to the European Commission proposal= The proposal met with measured approval by advocacy groups that had opposed the legislation.http://www.afterdawn.com/news/press_releases/press_release.cfm/708/hackney_council_seize_imperial_weighing _scaleshttp://www.bwmaonline.com/EC%20%Directive%20%20%EC%20proposals%20Sept%202007.htm The Commission proposal was also welcomed, even before it was officially published, by metrication advocates in the United States, who hoped that it would help promote the cause of metrication in the United States.

He taught yoga to more than 4.5 million people all over the world from his base as Malladihalli near Holalkere in Chitradurga district, a village in Karnataka, India. Early life Raghavendra Swami, was born on 27 July 1890, in a small village Barkur, in Karnataka. He was their only child. His parents named him Kumaraswamy. Later, urged by the head priest of Mantralaya Mutt, his name was changed to Raghavendra. He suffered from numerous ailments, including epilepsy, in his childhood. Later in his life, he met Palani Swami, a yogi from whom he learned hatha yoga, asanas and pranayama. His health improved and his body became strong after a few years with this yogi. He was adopted by Puthali Bai and Narasimhaiah on the advice of Bhirthi Ramachandra Shastry after the death of his mother. Anantha Padmanabha, leaving his son in the care of the foster parents went on a pilgrimage to Himalayas. Raghavendra's health gradually improved, and his foster parents began sending him to school. He performed well in every subject, except English. He was very fond of music, and learnt Carnatic music. He learned singing Bhajans and devotional songs. As a school boy he participated and acted in many plays, Yakshagana, and Thala Maddale. Later life He met Siddharudha Swami to do social works in Hubli, Karnataka; but left the work later. After staying some days at Siddharudha Mutt he left for Tumkur. Kumaraswamy started his association with K. Shivaram Karanth, a budding artist, who later, acquired the skills of drama, and its intricate styles, at the Amba Prasaditha Nataka Company, in Tumkur. Shivaram Karanth took Raghavendra to Ranganatha Thamankar, who offered him a job as a clerk at his drama company. He was entrusted with the sales of tickets and disbursement of salaries and wages to the staff of the drama company. Later during this period, he left his job. He met Paramahamsa Yogananda, and Swami Shivananda Tirtha and was impressed by him. He was later introduced to Baroda professor Manekrao, who had taught Swami Shivananda physical exercises and the use of weapons, as a disciple. Manekrao (1878‚Äì1954) had acquired knowledge from his preceptor Jumma Dada, who lived up to the age of one hundred and ten years . Kumaraswamy learnt various martial arts under the guidance of Manekrao. He was sent to Lahore to learn Ayurveda from Lakshman Das, a scholar of Yoga and Ayurveda, and an Ayurvedic practitioner. Jaggi Vasudev was an 11-year-old boy when he came in contact with Swamiji (who was then 78 years old) and learned hatha yoga from him. Later on Jaggi Vasudev founded the Isha Foundation and came to be known as Sadhguru by his followers. Social works He claimed that he had treated more than 3 million people for various diseases with ayurvedic medicines, and yoga without any surgery. He built an Ayurvedic hospital at Malladihalli and Vishwa Yoga Mandira (World Yoga Trust) and various educational institutions, on a non-profit basis. Recognition The State Government of Karnataka and the Central Government of India gave him several awards but he declined to accept them. Bibliography He was the author of books on yoga and ayurveda, as well as on Kannada literature, drama, music, etc., published under the pen name of Tiruka.

Style Informed by her background in architecture, the work focuses on signage within urban landscapes. In particular, addressing ideas of intertopia, margins of error, interstitial and impermanent spaces represented through freeway signage and billboards. Through tapestry she explores everyday limitations - capturing small intense sped-up moments. Using this traditional technique, Hamer explores an ironic romanticism present between tapestry and the digitalisation of imagery in contemporary society. Hamer was awarded funding by the Australia Council in 2011 to undertake study in the USA. Work =Stitched= Hamer's earliest works used wool and perforated plastic grids. The plastic grids are off the shelf products manufactured for the home craft, DIY market. Different colored wool is sourced, appropriate to each work. In 2014 Hamer was part of the Artists in Residence program at the Australian Tapestry Workshop where she was able to make yarns uniquely for her stitched works. Hamer has also worked in larger stitched formats; using barrier tape to stitch through polypropylene debris mesh. =Ink on paper= Hamer has continued to develop her technique(s) using perforated plastic grids. In the medium of ink on paper, Hamer uses the plastic grid as a stencil template through which to make marks on the paper. The process of slowly rendering an image is common to both the stitched and ink works. =Installation= There are no words was first seen at the NGV, as part of Melbourne Now in early 2014. Alongside the exhibition, Hamer ran two programs which allowed the public to stitch with her, contributing to the making of a large series of pieces. There are no words includes over 200 stitched black and white pieces. Individual pieces have black text stitched on a background of white stitches. The first installation of There are no words was at Ararat Regional Art Gallery in 2015, where a site specific workshop was run prior to the installation. The unique footage from the workshop became one half of the installation.

History Balatonszepezd was first settled in the 13th century as a fishing village. It was first the domain of royal stewards, then of local nobles, and later on the bishop of Veszpr√©m and the Benedictine Somogyv√°r Abbey. The old Roman Catholic church was built during this period. As a result of the Turkish invasion, it was almost completely destroyed; after the war, it was repopulated primarily by Germans. The village continued to grow and by the 18th century it was home to another two churches of Calvinist and Lutheran denomination, respectively. By the 19th century, the village was already a popular holiday destination, but mostly for artists and writers from the relatively nearby towns of R√©vf√ºl√∂p and Balatonbogl√°r. However, the efforts of P√°l Nagy and Vince Viriusz, coupled with the village's connection to the national railroad system during the early 20th century, soon brought visitors and tourists from all over the country and from abroad. Two distinct new neighborhoods, Szepezdf√ºrd√µ and Viriusztelep, developed on either side of the old village center with the influx of vacationers and their lake houses. At the same time, the permanent local population decreased due to urbanization. Today, the smallish village continues to serve as a holiday spot. The main sources of work are tourism and viticulture. Notable historic sites within the village are the buildings on the main street, √Årp√°d street, and the vicinity, which are built in the eclectic and baroque styles, and the three old churches.

History  After the founding of the state, it was the property of the Hungarian kings, but in a record from 1164, it is referred to as the possession of the Atyuz Clan. In 1211, the Tihany Abbey had 6 households here. Properties were donated to the Episcopate and Chapter of Veszpr√©m and to the Carthusian Monastery of L√∂v√∂ld as well. Though the village had been ruined several times during the 150 years of Turkish rule, it was still an inhabited place with some 15 years of interruptions throughout all this time.  Tourist sights  Heart-shaped tombstones There is a graveyard in Balatonudvari where heart-shaped tombstones can be found. These tombstones are made of white marble. Presumably, the tombstones are made between 1808 and 1840, although some of the signs became unreadable through the passing of the time. Here you can find more than sixty tombstones, which are unique to Hungary. Tombstones like these can only be found in few places (for example in Balatonf√ºred's graveyard). Also in Balatonudvari is one of Hungary's few 18 hole championship golf courses, the BalatonGolf Club. This Par 72 course is played over old quarry areas, through wooded hills and over many lakes.

The districts Aubing, Lochhausen and Langwied were incorporated together in 1942, thus forming the largest borough of the city at 3,400 hectares, yet having the lowest density of population with 37,352 residents as of 2002. This large borough still accommodates many vast agricultural and forest areas that together with the Aubinger Lohe and the Langwieder lake district, fulfill the balance of nature in the area and offer recreational facilities to all of western Munich. A large area between Aubing/Neuaubing and Germering on Munich ground of the Freiham district, east of Gut Freiham is currently under development.  History and Description  = Aubing = Aubinger Lohe forest Aubing was first documented in 1010 AD as Ubingen. This name was most likely derived from the name Ubo of the Bavarii, however no such person with that name is actually known of. The longer story which most school children are told, is of \\"Founder Ubo, who settled here with his cart\\" is just as well established as the neighbouring borough of Pasing's founding story, in that its name stemmed from \\"Paoso\\". Neither are accurate. In 1818 the municipality of Aubing was established, with the districts Aubing, Freiham and Moosschwaige. On 1 April 1942 the Aubing municipality was connected to Munich, but without a treaty of incorporation. Aubing is divided by the Munich-Buchloe railway line in Alt-Aubing and Neu-Aubing. Alt-Aubing reflects the origins of Aubing with buildings that still stand today. The old village centre is built around the gothic/baroque parish church St. Quirin with its approximately one- thousand-year-old romanesque tower built in 1480. Neuaubing arose at the start of the 20th century as settlement for railwaymen and workers.  Coat of Arms  Coat of Arms of Aubing The Aubing coat of arms goes back to a local aristocratic family from the 12th to the 14th century. It was first mentioned in a document of a known Hartmann of Aubing on 1 May 1334. The layout goes back to Otto Hupp. This was assessment was approved of on 23 February 1933. The coat of arms shows 3 leaves on a silver background. Today like all other Munich districts, Aubing carries the Munich coat of arms.  Clubs  Alt- Aubing has many clubs and associations, one of which is the Burschenverein Aubing (Aubing Gentleman's Club) that sets up the maypole in the village centre every three years. Many figures are carved into the wood of the maypole. = Lochhausen = Lochhausen was first documented in 948/955 AD as Lohhusa. The name means house or houses in the forest. In 1818 Lochhausen became part of the Langwied municipality. On 1 April 1942 this municipality then became part attached to the city of Munich. The old village centre is formed around the parish church of St. Michael. = Langwied = Langwieder See Langwied was first document in 1269/1271 as \\"Lanquat\\". The name Langwied means am langen Wald (althochdeutsch: daz witu = wood, forest). The ending \\"quat\\" used up to the 15th century could come from waten (the verb \\"to wade\\"), and could allude to a fjord for wading through of the Langwieder brook. In 1818 the Langwied municipality was formed with Lochhausen and Gr√∂benzell. On 1 April 1942 the municipality was incorporated into the city of Munich by treaty from 29 August/2 September 1941. Northern parts of Langwied formed the Gr√∂benzell municipality in 1952 along with other parts of municipalities.  Transport  = Car = The area in and directly around Aubing, Lochhausen and Langwied is connected to by the following junctions: A 99 *Junction 5 M√ºnchen-Freiham-Mitte *Junction 7 M√ºnchen-Lochhausen *Junction 8 Kreuz M√ºnchen-West A 8 *Junction 80 M√ºnchen-Langwied *Junction 81 Kreuz M√ºnchen-West = Public Transport = By Munich S-Bahn, the district is bound by the S4, S5, S6 and S8 lines, at the stops and stations of Langwied, Lochhausen, Leienfelsstra√üe, Aubing, Westkreuz and Neuaubing of the MVV. Numerous bus lines further connect the district. = Longest tunnel in Bavaria = Since the opening of the section of the A 99 as a connection between the M√ºnchen- Lochhausen junction and the A 96 M√ºnchen-Lindau route in February 2006 which resulted in the tunneling of large parts of Aubing, at 1,935m long Aubing has the largest automobile tunnel in Bavaria.

He is probably best known for applying worm gear drive to tramcars. This was not a great success on full-size vehicles but was later very widely used on electrically powered model railway locomotives. Early life and education Born in Graz, Austria on 23 March 1850, and died of consumption at his home in Stockwell, London at 2 a.m. on 11 November 1893. He was 43 years old.There are numerous obituaries in contemporary electrical industry and kindred journals, see: Journal of the Society of Arts, Vol.42, 17 November 1893, p.20.; The Engineer, Vol.76, 17 November 1893, p.468 At an early age he had first-hand opportunities of practical engineering, seeing the operations in the ironworks of his father who carried out large contracts for brewery plants, tanneries, buildings and railway materials - especially for the Hungarian railways.The Electrician, Vol.XXXII, 17 November 1893, p.66 (London: The Electrician) After receiving a practical education at the Technical School in Graz, and with a view to widening his engineering knowledge, he moved to England in 1872. Life and work in England He was first employed by Messrs Ravenhill, Miller & Co, the noted steam engine manufacturers and marine engineers of London. When John Richard Ravenhill left the partnership in 1875, the business transferred to the works of his former co-partners, Messrs Easton and Anderson of Erith, Kent - engineers, millwrights, and lead pipe manufacturers, and Reckenzaun followed the firm. In connection with the Erith ironworks, Reckenzaun established evening classes for the workmen, lecturing in machine construction and drawing, and steam. First, however, he had to qualify himself under the rules of the South Kensington Science and Art Department in these subjects, which he took with first class honours. Afterwards he attended the course of lectures given to qualified science teachers at the Royal School of Mines in 1877 and 1879. Again he obtained first class passes in steam and mechanics. Electrical engineering work After visiting the Paris Exposition of 1878, he determined to pursue a career in electrical engineering and attended Professor William Edward Ayrton's lectures at Finsbury Technical College which later became the City and Guilds. At the time of his death he was vice-president of the Old Students' Association of that body. He returned to Paris for the 1881 exhibition, studying the electrical exhibits at the Palais d'Industrie over three months. When he returned to England, he briefly joined the Faure Electric Accumulator Company before accepting the post of engineer to the Electrical Power Storage Company. In connection with the E.P.S. company he undertook much original and pioneering work on various forms of electric traction. In 1882 he designed the first significant electric launch driven by storage batteries, named ElectricityIllustrated with wood engravings in the Electrical Review, Vol.XI, No.255, 14 October 1882, pp.296 and 297 Soon afterwards he was building an electric tramcar which was exhibited in March 1883 on the West Metropolitan Tramways Company's line in London. From 1884 onwards Reckenzaun continued his electrical work independently, to build boats, cars and electric motors for various purposes. He conducted numerous investigations into electric traction and patented improvements in secondary batteries, electric motors, electric meters and related devices.Search Reckenzaun US patents via Google Patents He was an early electric motor designer and, paid particular attention to bogie cars and worm gear in this connection. This was not a great success on full-size vehicles but was later very widely used on electrically powered model railway locomotives. His storage battery tramcars were tried out on a number of tramlines, in the U.K. but mainly in the US, where his inventions were assigned to the Electric Car Company of America and his brother Frederick Reckenzaun, based in New York City developed associated electrical businesses and was his representative there. His traction motors were applied to the first large scale telpherage system for the Sussex Portland Cement Company at Glynde in 1885. The telpherage system, had originally been tested on the estate of Mr Marlborough.R. Pryor at Weston, Hertfordshire and also a line in Peru by Professor Fleeming Jenkin in association with Professors William Edward Ayrton and John Perry and the Telpherage Company, Limited. Perhaps one of his most noteworthy developments came in electric launches. On 13 September 1886 the boat Volta made the double voyage from Dover to Calais and back. He also built perhaps the first significant electric boat in the United States, named Magnet.For a very useful summary of his work over this period, with illustrations of machinery, see [https://archive.org/details/electricmotorits00martrich Thomas Commerford Martin (1892) The electric motor : and its applications (available via the Internet Archive). Professional and scientific societies He was a member of, and contributor of papers to, various professional and scientific bodies, both English and International. In 1882 he was elected a member of the Society of Arts. On 16 January 1884 he read a paper before that society on 'Electric Launches'.Journal of the Society of Arts, Vol.32, No.1626, 18 January 1884, pp.135-147 On 20 April 1887 he gave a paper on 'Electric Locomotion'.Journal of the Society of Arts, Vol.35, 22 April 1887, pp.556-568 For this latter paper he received the society's silver medal.Journal of the Society of Arts, Vol.35, No.1803, 10 June 1887, p.733 On 1 November 1887 he was elected an Associate Member, and on 6 December the same year, a Full Member of the American Institute of Electrical EngineersSee Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, Vol.X, 1893, pp.667-668 In 1889 he was elected to the Society of Telegraph-Engineers and Electricians now the Institution of Engineering and Technology. In December 1892 the I.E.E. awarded him the Paris Electrical Exhibition Premium for his paper on 'Load diagrams and the cost of electric traction'. He also gave papers at the British Association, the American National Electric Light Association and the Vienna Electro-Technical Society. In later years he associated himself with the General Electric Company and Greenwood and Batley and was a regular contributor to the electrical journals of the day. He published a collection of much of his work on electric traction was published in 1892 by Biggs & Co, London, entitled 'Electric traction on railways and tramways'.

Geotargeting in geomarketing and internet marketing is the method of determining the geolocation of a website visitor and delivering different content to that visitor based on their location. This includes country, region/state, city, metro code/zip code, organization, IP address, ISP or other criteria.Michael Freedman, Mythili Vutukuru, Nick Feamster and Hari Balakrishnan, Geographic Locality of IP Prefixes, Internet Measurement Conference (IMC), 2005 A common usage of geo targeting is found in online advertising, as well as internet television with sites such as iPlayer and Hulu. In these circumstances, content is often restricted to users geolocated in specific countries; this approach serves as a means of implementing digital rights management. Use of proxy servers and virtual private networks may give a false location. Geographical information provided by the visitor In geotargeting with geolocation software, the geolocation is based on geographical and other personal information that is provided by the visitor or others. =Different content by choice= Typical examples for different content by choice in geotargeting are the FedEx and UPS websites where users have the choice to select their country location first and are then presented with different site or article content depending on their selection. =Automated different content= In internet marketing and geomarketing, the delivery of different content based on the geographical geolocation and other personal information is automated.Wall Street Journal, ‚ÄúOn the Web's Cutting Edge, Anonymity in Name Only‚Äù, August 4, 2010 A good example is the Ace Hardware website at www.acehardware.com. The company utilizes geolocation software to power the ‚ÄúMy Local Ace‚Äù section of its website. Based on a site visitor's location, the website's online locator service can show the visitor how many stores are in their area, as well as a city-level locator map to help the customer find the store closest to their address.Chain Store Age, ‚ÄúMaking it Personal‚Äù, November, 2008 IP spidering The automated discovery of user person/organisation/city-level geolocation information based on IP addresses by traceroute, pings, and a combination of other tools and methods is far more advanced. Discussing automated spidering technology It is dependent on the pre-analysis of the entire IP address space. There are more than 4 billion possible IPv4 addresses, and detailed analysis of each of them is a Herculean task, especially in light of the fact that IP addresses are constantly being assigned, allocated, reallocated, moved and changed due to routers being moved, enterprises being assigned IP addresses or moving, and networks being built or changed. In order to keep up with these changes, complex algorithms, bandwidth measurement and mapping technology, and finely tuned delivery mechanisms are necessary. Once all of the IP space is analyzed, each address must be periodically updated to reflect changes in the IP address information, without invading a user's privacy. This process is similar in scale to the task of Web spidering. IP delivery in SEO IP delivery for search engine optimization (SEO) is the method of delivering different content to search engine spiders (also known as robots and crawlers) then to human visitors. The IP address determines if a visitor is a known search engine spider. SEOs compare the visitor's IP address with their list of IP addresses, which are known to be servers that are owned by a search engine and used to run their crawler applications (spiders). The delivery of different content to search engine spiders than to human visitors is called cloaking and is against most search engines' webmaster guidelines.Google webmaster guidelinesYahoo! search content quality guidelinesMS Search guidelines for successful indexing Although the search engine guidelines seem to imply that any type of cloaking is bad, there are cases where cloaking might be legitimate. The subject is very controversial and SEO experts continue to debate about when cloaking might be acceptable and when not.Chris Sherman (July 18, 2001), Search Engine Cloaking: The Controversy Continues , Search Engine Watch, retrieved on December 9, 2007 \\"Cloaking\\" via IP delivery works differently from cloaking via \\"user agent\\". While IP address spoofing is harder than user-agent spoofing and more reliable, it is also harder to keep the list of IP addresses used by search engines for their crawlers up-to-date. An outdated list with active crawler IP addresses missing enables the search engines to detect the cloaking and may result in a removal of the site from the search engine's index.

He was the son of the Reverend James Johnston, of Springburn's United Presbyterian Church. George spent the early part of his career in locomotive engineering before designing and constructing Scotland's first automobile, the Mo-Car, which led to the formation of the Arrol-Johnston Car Company Ltd. Career =Locomotives and trams= George Johnston worked as a locomotive engineer for the Hyde Park Locomotive Company Limited of Springburn, Glasgow. In 1894 Johnston was commissioned by the City of Glasgow to build an experimental steam tram-car to replace the horse trams. When it was having a final test before a Corporation committee it took fire and it was abandoned. =Motor cars= Johnston's attention was then turned to a detailed examination of continental makes of motor car. He came to the conclusion that he could design and make a better vehicle than any of them and in particular a better engine. The first British- built motor car was thus conceived and by the end of 1895 was ready for financial backing. =Mo-Car Syndicate= In the autumn of 1895 Johnston was joined by his cousin Norman Osborne Fulton and T. Blackwood Murray, former Works Manager with Mavor and Coulson, makers of mining machinery in Bridgeton. and Johnston formed a joint venture with Sir William Arrol, an engineer of the Forth Bridge to form the Mo-Car Syndicate Limited, which was to produce his car. Sir William was Chairman and Johnston was Managing Director, and the Syndicate included a Mr. Archibald Coats, and a Mr. Millar of Paisley, while his cousin Norman Fulton was Works Manager. Sir William's main interest in the business was as the financial backer. Fulton and Murray later parted company with Johnston in 1899 to set up Albion Motors. =All British Car Company= Johnston departed the Arrol-Johnston company in 1903 after it had been restructured financially, as a result of a disagreement, to join the All British Car Company.

History The first recorded yacht race was to be held on Windermere in 1818, using, as its land base, the inn at Ferry Nab. However, the race was not to be, the wind was then, as it is now, and that is unpredictable! (or in the case of 1818, absent). Undeterred, the hardy souls who wished to race were not put off and racing in an 'ad hoc' manner, continued for many years. Indeed, the regatta of 1824 was witnessed by an illustrious company, including such luminaries of the time as Sir Walter Scott, William Wordsworth and Robert Southey. This 'ad hoc' affair gained in popularity and became increasingly organised. The Windermere Sailing Club was founded in 1860 and started to organise yacht racing on Windermere in a more formal manner. In doing so, it introduced limits on size and handicapping for different types of yacht. However, the club members were not averse to stretching the rules on size, apparently taking the line that everything not mentioned in the rules was permissible. This rule bending resulted in the construction of a 'one design' class, where all racing yachts had to conform to rather more stringent parameters than had hitherto been the case. This resulted in the first 'Windermere' class racing yacht, having a waterline of 22' In 1887 Sir William Forwood acquired the Royal Warrant for the club. This was on the occasion of the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. The 22' Windermere Class continued to be the only racing yachts on the lake for many years. But, in 1904 a new class was proposed. The design brief for the boat was that it should be cheap, easy to handle, suitable for amateurs, capable of being taken out quickly and may be sailed single handed if necessary. The design evolved into the Windermere 17' class yachts, or as they were called in those days, the 'second class' yachts. The 22' and 17' fleets co-existed quite nicely for several years, but eventually the 22' class dwindled, with fewer and fewer new boats being built. This apparent malaise also set in with the 17' class, so that by 1914, the entire fleet of the club numbered 14 boats. In 1922, the club introduced the 19' class. This was not a popular class as construction prices had increased markedly, following the Great War and there were plenty of 17' boats still in use. The 19' fleet often sailed in handicap races with the 17' fleet. Dinghies On 23 October 1948, the club decided that something must be done to encourage more people to sail on Windermere. The decision they took on that date was to introduce sailing dinghies. The decision was not accepted with universal jubilation; the proposed club dinghy was to be the 'Firefly' many members were of the opinion that a dinghy would be unsafe on the lake and that catastrophe was inevitable. They might also attract 'young people'! In 1951, the club agreed to introduce a second dinghy class. The GP14 fleet came into being. The GP was seen as a much more suitable family boat than the firefly, which was designed solely for racing. The GP Fleet remains popular with club members and a strong racing fleet can be seen on the lake during the season. Racing Fleets Racing at RWYC is divided into six classes.

Word history The Oxford English Dictionary records the earliest usages of cannabis meaning the plant \\"common hemp Cannabis sativa\\" - in 1548 , and meaning - parts of the plant \\"smoked, chewed, or drunk for their intoxicating or hallucinogenic properties\\" - in 1848.Oxford English Dictionary, 2009, 2nd ed., v. 4.0, Oxford University Press. This 1548 usage was in William Turner's The names of herbes, \\"Cannabis is called in Englishe Hemp.\\" The OED traces the etymology to the New Latin botanical term cannabis ‚Äì proposed in 1728 and standardized in Carl Linnaeus's (1753) Species Plantarum ‚Äì from an earlier Latin cannabis, coming from Greek k√°nnabis. Herodotus (c. 440 BCE) recorded the use of cannabis in The Histories. \\"The Scythians, as I said, take some of this hemp-seed [presumably, flowers], and, creeping under the felt coverings, throw it upon the red-hot stones; immediately it smokes, and gives out such a vapour as no Grecian vapour-bath can exceed; the Scyths, delighted, shout for joy.\\" 4.75 The historian and linguist Douglas Harper gives an etymology of English cannabis from Greek kannabis, from a Scythian or Thracian word, which is also the source for English canvas (viz., hempen fabric) and possibly hemp. Indo-European etymologies Based upon the botany, archeology, and linguistic history of cannabis, Elizabeth Wayland Barber concluded, > People all across the middle latitudes of Europe and Asia ‚Äì and that would > include the early Indo-Europeans (IE's) ‚Äì knew and were using hemp since > 5000 B.C. So when IE groups started borrowing a new word four millennia > later, it had to have been for a new use: drugs. The old northern varieties > of hemp did not contain the narcotic THC; and the 2nd millennium was > probably the first time that enough people were travelling back and forth > between Iran (where it grew) and eastern Europe that they could spread a > habit, along with its source, the THC-bearing hemp.

Prehistoric Textiles: The > Development of Cloth in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages with Special Reference > to the Aegean. Princeton University Press. p. 36. Barber analyzed cognate words for \\"hemp\\" and \\"cannabis\\" in Indo-European languages, and proposed an etymological root of *kan(n)aB- (where *B represents a *p or *b bilabial stop). A reconstructed Proto-Indo-European (PIE) *p is evident in many IE subgroups: * Albanian (kan√´p) * Armenian (kanap) * Baltic languages (Lithuanian kan√£pƒó, Latvian ka≈Üepe, and Old Prussian knapios) * Some Finnic languages (Ingrian kaneppi and Estonian kanep) have loaned the word from Baltic. * Romanian (c√¢nepƒÉ) * Slavic languages (Russian konoplj√°, Croatian konoplja, Bulgarian konop, and Czech konopƒï) Words in Germanic languages (Old English h√¶nep, Old Norse hampr, and German der Hanf) go back to *hanap-, which by Grimm's Law would come from a *kanab- form, but this loanword preceded Romano-Germanic culture.Barber (1992), p. 36. A reconstructed PIE *b is evident in Latin cannabis (Vulgar Latin *can(n)abum, *canaba) from Greek kannabis, the earliest recorded term for the drug, which transcribed a Scythian or Thracian word. The Scythians spoke Iranian dialects, and Indo-Iranian languages have two words, represented by Sanskrit ≈õa·πáa- \\"a kind of hemp\\" (from *kana- or *kene- forms) and bhanga \\"narcotic hemp\\" (cf. bhang). From the Uralic and Turkic languages, Barber cited Mari kene or kine \\"hemp\\", Chuvash kant√§r, Old Turkish k√§ntir, Turkish kendir and kenevir, and Karakalpak kenep.Barber (1992), p. 37. Further corroboration comes from 1st millennium BCE Neo-Assyrian cuneiform texts, \\"where a word qunabu (qunnapu, qunubu, qunbu) begins to turn up, for a source of oil, fiber and medicine.\\"Barber (1992), p. 38. Thus, Barber's well-researched hypothesis involves two stages: in the late Palaeolithic and early Neolithic, a *ken- or *kan- name spread across Asia with the hemp plant, which was used for fiber and food; then in the early Iron Age, \\"an enlarged version of this very word, local to Iran and perhaps northern India‚Ä¶spread with the drug-bearing variety.\\" Michael Witzel suggests an ultimate derivation of both *kana and *bhang from the language(s) of the Bactria‚ÄìMargiana Archaeological Complex.Witzel, Michael. \\"The Home of the Aryans\\".

Raphael Mechoulam and co-workers at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem suggest an alternative etymology for cannabis: Greek cannabis < Arabic kunnab < Syriac qunnappa < Hebrew pannag (= bhanga in Sanskrit and bang in Persian). They explain that in Hebrew, only the consonants form the basis of a word and the letters p and b are frequently interchangeable. The authors think it probable that 'pannag', mentioned in the Bible by the prophet Ezekiel (27:17), is in fact Cannabis.Mechoulam, R., W. A. Devane, A. Breuer, and J. Zahalka. 1991.

Hildeshein: Georg Olms (source not confirmed) The Hebrew Bible mentions it in Exodus 30:23 where God commands Moses to make a holy oil of myrrh, cinnamon, qƒõnƒìh bo≈õem and cassia to anoint the Ark of the Covenant and the Tabernacle (and thus God's Temple in Jerusalem).Rabbi Kaplan. 1981. The Living Torah, pp. 40‚Äì41. Notably, this anointing oil is a special herbal formula that functions as a kind of polish and fragrance for the Ark and Tabernacle, and the Bible forbids its manufacture and use to anoint people (Exodus 30:31‚Äì33) with the exception of the Aaronic priesthood (Exodus 30:30). Elsewhere, the Hebrew Bible simply uses \\"reed\\" qƒÅnƒìh as the name of a plant in four places whose context seems to mean \\"reed of balm\\" as a fragrant resin, Isaiah 43:24, Jeremiah 6:20, Ezekiel 27:19 and Song of Songs 4:14. The Hebrew name \\"reed of balm\\" comes from qƒõnƒìh (the noun construct form of qƒÅneh) means a \\"reed\\" or \\"cane\\" and bo≈õem means \\"balm\\" or \\"aromatic\\" resin. Hebrew may have adapted the name qannabb√¥s from \\"reed of balm\\" qƒõnƒìh bo≈õem as a substitute for the ambiguous name \\"reed\\". Unambiguous Hebrew or Aramaic references to cannabis are rare and obscure. Syriac has qanpa (a loan from kannabis) and tanuma (see the Comprehensive Aramaic Lexicon.) but neither is found in the Peshitta, the Syriac Bible. Late Syriac Ahiqar texts include qanpa as \\"ropes of hemp\\" (tunbei de-qanpa). The Hebrew word qanbes, a loan word from kannabis, is used in the Mishnah as hemp [Kilaim 2:5; 5:8; 9:1,7; Negaim 11:2] in the sense of a constituent of clothing or other items. Cannabis was a common material among the Hebrews. The hempen frock called \\"Simlah\\" in HebrewFrock, The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia Online, http://www.internationalstandardbible.com/F/frock.html was worn as a mark of the lowly. The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia also asserts the following: * \\"The usual material for ropes was certainly flax (hemp)\\"Rope, The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia Online, http://www.internationalstandardbible.com/R/rope.html * That the cloth for tents called bait sha\`r, meaning \\"house of hair\\" were stretched over poles by ropes of goats hair or hemp.Tent, The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia Online, http://www.internationalstandardbible.com/T/tent.html * \\"The poorer classes probably wore wrappers made either of unbleached flax or hemp\\"Linen, The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia Online, http://www.internationalstandardbible.com/L/linen.html (the hempen, again, being the Simlah).

Overview Hackescher Markt about 1900 Originally a marsh north of the city fortifications on the road to Spandau, the Prussian king Frederick the Great about 1750 had a market square laid out under the surveillance of Townmajor Hans Christoph Friedrich Graf von Hacke in the course of a northern town expansion. It was officially named after Hacke on 23 July 1840. In 1882 the area received access to the Berlin Stadtbahn railway line at Berlin Hackescher Markt station, then called B√∂rse after the nearby stock exchange. The station was renamed Marx-Engels-Platz during the GDR era. Formerly a rather neglected area, Hackescher Markt with its old buildings has developed into a cultural and commercial centre after German reunification, famous for its nightlife centered on the Hackesche H√∂fe courtyard ensemble. The square is also served by several tramway and night bus lines. A weekly market is still held every Thursday and Saturday.

Per post-WWII Macedonian historiographyThe origins of the official Macedonian national narrative are to be sought in the establishment in 1944 of the Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. This open acknowledgment of the Macedonian national identity led to the creation of a revisionist historiography whose goal has been to affirm the existence of the Macedonian nation through the history. Macedonian historiography is revising a considerable part of ancient, medieval, and modern histories of the Balkans. Its goal is to claim for the Macedonian peoples a considerable part of what the Greeks consider Greek history and the Bulgarians Bulgarian history. The claim is that most of the Slavic population of Macedonia in the 19th and first half of the 20th century was ethnic Macedonian. For more see: Victor Roudometof, Collective Memory, National Identity, and Ethnic Conflict: Greece, Bulgaria, and the Macedonian Question, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002, , p. 58; Victor Roudometof, Nationalism and Identity Politics in the Balkans: Greece and the Macedonian Question in Journal of Modern Greek Studies 14.2 (1996) 253-301.Yugoslav Communists recognized the existence of a Macedonian nationality during WWII to quiet fears of the Macedonian population that a communist Yugoslavia would continue to follow the former Yugoslav policy of forced Serbianization. Hence, for them to recognize the inhabitants of Macedonia as Bulgarians would be tantamount to admitting that they should be part of the Bulgarian state. For that the Yugoslav Communists were most anxious to mold Macedonian history to fit their conception of Macedonian consciousness. The treatment of Macedonian history in Communist Yugoslavia had the same primary goal as the creation of the Macedonian language: to de-Bulgarize the Macedonian Slavs and to create a separate national consciousness that would inspire identification with Yugoslavia. For more see: Stephen E. Palmer, Robert R. King, Yugoslav communism and the Macedonian question, Archon Books, 1971, , Chapter 9: The encouragement of Macedonian culture.At any rate, the beginning of the active national-historical direction with the historical ‚Äúmasterpieces‚Äù, which was for the first time possible in 1944, developed in Macedonia much harder than was the case with the creation of the neighbouring nations of the Greeks, Serbs, Bulgarians and others in the 19th century. These neighbours almost completely \\"plundered\\" the historical events and characters from the land, and there was only debris left for the belated nation. A consequence of this was that first that parts of the ‚Äúplundered history‚Äù were returned, and a second was that an attempt was made to make the debris become a fundamental part of an autochthonous history. This resulted in a long phase of experimenting and revising, during which the influence of non-scientific instances increased. This specific link of politics with historiography in the Socialist Republic of Macedonia... was that this was a case of mutual dependence, i.e. influence between politics and historical science, where historians do not simply have the role of registrars obedient to orders. For their significant political influence, they had to pay the price for the rigidity of the science... There is no similar case of mutual dependence of historiography and politics on such a level in Eastern or Southeast Europe.For more see: Stefan Trobest, ‚ÄúHistorical Politics and Histrocial ‚ÄòMasterpieces‚Äô in Macedonia before and after 1991‚Äù, New Balkan Politics, 6 (2003). he was an ethnic Macedonian.Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts  Biography  Badev was born in Prilep, Ottoman Empire, present day North Macedonia.

Western Barta'a is in the Haifa District of Israel, and forms part of the Basma local council. Its 4,700 residents are Arab citizens of Israel. Eastern Barta'a is in the Palestinian territories in the northern part of the Jenin Governorate of the West Bank in what was designated under the Oslo Accords as Area C.

According to oral traditions, the tribe moved in the middle of the 18th century from Beit Jibrin to Ya'bad. In the middle of the 19th century, some of the Kabhaites left Ya'bad in search of a living area and purchased the land of Barta'a, where they found a spring and grazing land. In time, Barta'a developed and was built around it by satellite villages, also belonging to the sons of Kabha: Umm al- Qutuf, 'Ein al-Sahala, Wadi' Ara and Tura al-Arabiya.Amara, 1999, p. 12 =British Mandate era= In the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Barta'a had a population of 468, all Muslim,Barron, 1923, Table IX, Sub-district of Jenin, p. 30 increasing in the 1931 census to 692, still all Muslims, in 94 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 67 In the 1945 census (including Khirbat Tura el Gharbiya) had a population of 1,000 MuslimsDepartment of Statistics, 1945, p. 16 with 20,499 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics.

The western part fell under Israeli control, while the eastern part fell under Jordanian control. From 1949 to 1967, travel between the two halves was practically impossible. In the armistice agreements at the end of the War of Independence, the village was divided into two, on the basis of the Wadi al- Umiya outline, which crosses the village and constitutes a convenient natural border. Its north-western part was transferred to Israel with about a third of the population (500 people), while its eastern-southern part, which is located on the hilltop, was incorporated into Jordan with about 1,000 residents. The distance between the houses of Barta'a in Israel and the houses of Barta'a in Jordan was a few dozen meters and in some places only a few meters. In the first years after the 1948 War the villagers moved almost freely between the two parts of the village. The residents of Barta'a used to go to the mosque in the Jordanian section, and the mukhtar was in charge of the two parts of the village. As a result, the village was a convenient place for meetings between Israeli Arabs and their relatives who lived in the Jordan. In May 1955, the Jordanian authorities evacuated the refugees who settled in East Barta'a from the area, in order to make it difficult to smuggle into Israel. In March 1956, a serious border incident occurred in which an Israeli policeman and four Arabs from Jordan were killed. During the incident, most residents of East Barta'a fled their homes. Following the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel captured the West Bank and the two parts of the town were informally reunited, operating as one municipal unit. Since many of the residents in both parts of the town belong to the same extended family (the Kabha family), the de facto \\"reunification\\" was viewed positively by town residents. Residents of East Barta'a began to work in Israel and agriculture became a source of secondary income. Thanks to the proximity to Israel, the standard of living in East Barta'a rose faster than in the rest of the West Bank. In 1978, East Barta'a was connected to electricity from generators, and in 1984, it was connected to the Israeli electricity grid. Barta'a students study at high schools in Ya'abed and Jenin, In 1995, an outline plan for East Barta'a, intended to meet the expansion needs of East Barta'a by 2015, came into effect. Following the second intifada, the village of Barta'a became an important commercial center for the residents of Wadi Ara and a large part of the Galilee residents to buy cheap goods at the prices of the Palestinian Authority after the entry of Israelis into the West Bank, Many businessmen from the West Bank relocated their businesses to East Barta'a as part of the Palestinian Authority but have access to and proximity to the target market for goods in the Wadi Ara area. With the construction of the separation fence, East Barta'a was included in an enclave located on the Israeli side of the fence, and the trend of Israelis traveling to Barta'a for cheap shopping increased. Many of the houses in the village became stores and warehouses for merchandise, and many of the villagers became rich. However, there were also allegations of harm to residents of the village who are forced to move to the towns of Yabed and Jenin via an IDF checkpoint. The development of Barta'a into an important commercial center resulted in many workers' from the West Bank settling in the village regularly. This led to social tension between foreign workers and residents, who saw workers as a threat to their livelihood. In addition, the prolonged stay of workers, most of whom are young without families, has long been viewed by many as a threat to the conservative customs of the residents. In the absence of recreation and welfare centers in the village, workers tend to spend their free time on the streets of the village and next to the residential areas of the local residents. The proximity between parts of Barta'a was exploited by the terrorist organizations to smuggle people into the State of Israel. For example, the suicide bomber who carried out the attack at the Maxim restaurant crossed the Green Line in Barta'a. Barta'a enclave The Israeli West Bank barrier passes east of Barta'a, separating the town from the rest of the West Bank. The portion of the town lying outside Israeli territory (Eastern Barta'a) is in what is known as the Seam Zone, an area between the Green Line and the barrier. Other towns and villages in this enclave include Umm ar-Rihan, Khirbet 'Abdallah al-Yunis, Khirbet Ash-Sheikh Sa'eed, Khirbet al-Muntar al-Gharbiya, Khirbet al-Muntar ash-Sharqiyya, and Dhaher al-Malik. There are no checkpoints to the west on the border with Israel, but long-term residents of the Barta'a enclave who do not have Israeli citizenship face fines if they leave the enclave to venture into Israel. Access from the Barta'a enclave to the West Bank is through two entry/exit gates: Barta'a and Shaked. People who wants to enter the enclave must also apply for a permit. The market in the Barta'a enclave has become a hotspot for customers from Israel. Because the residents do not live under Israeli social system, products are cheaper than in Israel. The area is accessible for Palestinians and Israelis, and thus has become a kind of free-trade zone.Arab town, both Israeli and Palestinian, divided by shopping, Haaretz on 1.

The development then slows in the 1970s, with some facility flags in the street of General de Gaulle. The 1980s knew no real development. The urbanization of the village took place in the early 1990s, in a context of population growth in part linked to the development of Val d'Europe and the installation of Disneyland Paris . The first subdivision located between the street from the Obelisk and the rue de Bellevue (rue des Bouleaux and street Saulnes) was implemented in 1992 and completed in 1994, establishing a continuity between the village and the farm Bellevue. The second subdivision located between General de Gaulle and rue the Obelisk (street Warblers rue des M√©sanges) was implemented in 1994 and completed in 1997. The third subdivision of Reeds Street was built in parallel. The last subdivision street Harvest and street Spica was built in 2003.

Thophanous was a member of parliament in the state of Victoria. He entered politics in 1988 as a member of the Victorian Legislative Council. Theophanous served from 1988 to 2006 as one of the two members for Jika Jika Province, before the reforms to the Victorian Legislative Council that introduced proportional representation. He served as a Minister in the Kirner Government and as the leader of the opposition in the Legislative Council from 1993 until 1999. From 2006 until 2010 he represented the Northern Metropolitan Region and served as Minister in the Bracks and Brumby Governments. Before entering Parliament he was active in Labor Party (ALP) politics in the federal electorate of Batman and published his views about Ethnicity and Politics in Northcote.Theo Charles Theophanous (1988), 'The Changing Nature of Greek Involvement in Australian Politics', in A. Kapardis and A. Tamis (eds.), Afstraliotes Hellenes: Greeks in Australia, River Seine Press, Melbourne, pp.231‚Äì244 He was active in the Socialist Left (SL) faction of the Victorian ALP.Ernest Healy (1993), 'Ethnic ALP Branches ‚Äì The Balkanisation of Labor,' in People and Place, Vol.1, No.4, Page 40 In 1995 he was a candidate for ALP preselection for the seat of Batman for the 1996 Federal election, but withdrew due to pressure from within the party for the preselection to be given to then Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) President Martin Ferguson. Despite a public campaign to \\"Let Batman Vote\\", Theophanous withdrew after threats that the National Executive of the ALP would intervene to overturn any local vote and give the preselection to Ferguson. Theophanous' withdrawal from the Batman preselection meant that he was not able to join his brother Andrew Theophanous in Federal Parliament. Ironically Martin Ferguson joined his own brother Laurie Ferguson in Federal Parliament. In 1996, Theophanous‚Äô supporters moved a motion of no confidence in the leadership of the Socialist Left faction. This motion was defeated by a narrow margin in a meeting of more than 500 members. Theophanous then walked out of the Socialist Left meeting and left the faction. Theophanous then formed the Labor Renewal Alliance (LRA) with support from Greek, Latin American and Lebanese branches. The LRA allied itself and eventually merged with the Labor Unity Faction. This dramatically changed the balance of power in the Victorian Labor Party, with Labor Unity and the LRA gaining control of the Australian Labor Party. With the election of the Bracks government in 1999, Theophanous was made Parliamentary Secretary. He was appointed Minister for Energy and Resources after the 2002 Victorian election. Theophanous resigned as a Minister in December 2008. He was subsequently cleared of allegations against him; he then resigned from Parliament in February 2010.

After the re-election of the Bracks Government in 2002, Theophanous was appointed Minister for Industry and State Development and Minister for Major Projects. He introduced the Victorian Renewable Energy Target Scheme and the Basslink Electricity Connection between Victoria and Tasmania during this time. =Brumby years (2007‚Äì2010)= During the Brumby Government between 2007 and his resignation as a Minister in December 2008, Theo Theophanous was Minister for Industry and Trade, Minister for Major Projects and Minister for Information, Communication and Technology. Theophanous was the Minister responsible for the construction of the Melbourne Recital Centre, Melbourne Rectangular Stadium, the Melbourne Convention Centre, the supercomputer at Melbourne University and the La Trobe University Research Centre. Theophanous developed the airline industry in Victoria through the introduction of Etihad Airways, Tiger Airways, Qatar Airlines, and Emirates flights to Melbourne. Exit from politics In December 2008 Theo Theophanous resigned as a Minister in the Brumby Government as a result of impending court proceedings based on an allegation by a woman living in Greece of an incident of rape 10 years earlier. On 24 July 2009, the charge against him was dismissed after the magistrate ruled that 'the prosecution's case was not sustainable on the evidence at any level\\" and that it lacked \\"credibility, reliability and truthfulness\\". The magistrate criticized the complainant for \\"possible coercion\\" of witnesses and the Victoria Police for \\"benign acceptance of her allegations without objectivity\\", describing the complainant's evidence as \\"unreliable\\" and \\"concocted\\". Theophanous subsequently asked the Greek authorities to pursue charges of criminal defamation against the complainant in an Athens court, claiming the woman had concocted the allegation in an attempt to gain financial benefit. The court found the complainant guilty and sentenced her to 3 years jail (suspended). An appeal was filed on October 2010 which was subsequently heard in a superior Athens court, however the original conviction for criminal defamation was upheld albeit with a reduced 2 years sentence. Theophanous sought an adjudication from the Australian Press Council in relation to articles published in The Age newspaper which he claimed were false and based in part on an undisclosed conflict of interest by Age journalist Carolyn Webb who was a friend of the complainant. The Australian Press Council upheld the major complaints by Theophanous and their findings were made public on 30 July 2010. The Age newspaper and Victoria Police were subsequently criticised by the Herald Sun. This was followed by further critical comment published by the VexNews website. Theo Theophanous resigned from Parliament in February 2010 after 22 years of public service. Post-political career Since leaving politics, Theo Theophanous has served on the Board of National Information Communication Technology Australia (NICTA) and the Metropolitan Planning Authority (MPA) Board. He was appointed Ambassador on charitable basis for the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute. Theophanous is an active political and social commentator in major Australian newspapers.

The station was started by Radio Otago and broadcast from Radio Otago House. The station's music was a mix of classic and new rock, kiwi and local artists and at night a little top 40 flavour added to keep the younger demographic. In 1997 Radio Otago purchased Christchurch station C93FM and in August 1997 93Rox became C93FM. At this point the programme was networked to Invercargill on 90.8FM but remained independent from the Christchurch C93FM. At the end of 1998 local content on C93FM was replaced with a network programme from Christchurch.

This has the effect of determining whether assets can be disposed of in wills, or whether the wording of the will is too vague to allow beneficiaries to collect what appears on the face of the will to be theirs. The case has been followed in most common law jurisdictions. Facts Richard I Knight (1659‚Äì1749) of Downton in the parish of Downton on the Rock in Herefordshire, a wealthy ironmaster from Madeley, Shropshire, proprietor of the Bringewood Ironworks, and founder of the family's fortune, made a settlement on 26 April 1729, which passed the manors of Leintwardine and Downton, Herefordshire, including Croft Castle down the family line. The first grandson (son of his second son Rev. Thomas Knight (1697‚Äì1764) of Wormsley Grange, Rector of Bewdley, Worcestershire) was (Richard) Payne Knight (1750-1824), MP, an art connoisseur (and specialist on phallic imagery), who re-built the old manor house at Downton in the Gothic revival style as Downton Castle. Payne Knight made his will on 3 June 1814, leaving the property to his brother, Thomas Andrew Knight (a horticulturalist), and in tail male to his male descendants. But if there were none, the property was to pass to the \\"next descendant in the direct male line of my late grandfather, Richard Knight of Downton\\". However, he also stated: > \\"I trust to the liberality of my successors to reward any others of my old > servants and tenants according to their deserts, and to their justice in > continuing the estates in the male succession, according to the will of the > founder of the family, my above-named grandfather\\". Thomas Knight died intestate, having been pre-deceased by his only son. His daughter, the horticulturalist Charlotte Knight (c.1801-1843), had married Sir William Edward Rouse-Boughton, 2nd and 10th Baronet (1788-1856), a Member of Parliament for Evesham. Payne's uncle, Edward Knight (1699-1780) (3rd son of the patriarch Richard I Knight), had a grandson John Knight (1765-1850),Burke's Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Landed Gentry, 15th Edition, ed. Pirie-Gordon, H., London, 1937, p.1305, pedigree of Knight of Wolverley of Lea Castle, Wolverley, the pioneering developer of the Forest of Exmoor in Somerset, who brought a claim alleging that Thomas had been bound to make a strict settlement in favour of the male line, of which he was the senior representative. Sir William Rouse-Boughton argued that no such trust had been created and that the property had in fact gone to Thomas absolutely, and thus on to Charlotte and his family. Judgment Lord Langdale MR held that the words of Payne's will were not sufficiently certain, which meant that there had been an absolute gift to Thomas, who had taken the property unfettered by any trust in favour of the male line. He formulated a legal test, now known as the \\"three certainties\\". This test specified that for a valid trust to be created, there must be three certainties: *(1) Certainty of intention: there must be intention to create a trust; *(2) Certainty of subject matter: the assets constituting the trust must be readily determinable; *(3) Certainty of objects: the people to whom the trustees are to owe a duty must be readily determinable.

He has been a Labor Party member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly since 2006, representing the electorate of Tarneit until 2014 and Werribee thereafter. He has served as Treasurer of Victoria in the Andrews Ministry since December 2014. Pallas previously served as Minister for Roads and Ports and Minister for Major Projects in the Brumby Ministry until 2010. Before politics Pallas, a former trade union official with the National Union of Workers, was the chief of staff to Premier of Victoria Steve Bracks before entering politics. Political career He first contested the open preselection for the federal seat of Melbourne Ports in 1998, but was defeated by Michael Danby. In 2005, Pallas challenged incumbent backbencher Mary Gillett for preselection in the safe seat of Tarneit, and with Bracks' backing, was successful. He was easily elected at the 2006 state election, and was immediately appointed to Cabinet, being assigned the roads and ports portfolio. In 2010, Pallas courted controversy when whilst launching a road safety campaign he called Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton a \\"dickhead\\". Hamilton had been caught by police engaging in an act of 'hoon driving' in a $160,000 Mercedes on the previous Friday night.http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/new-road-safety- campaign/story-e6frf7jo-1225846731084 During his ministry, he implemented a number of measures to improve traffic flow on the major Victorian freeways including the Monash CityLink West Gate Upgrade. In February, he launched a $5 million study into traffic flow along Hoddle Street between CityLink and the Eastern Freeway. The study had been previously announced in the Victorian Transport Plan in 2008. In March, he approved a ban on trucks using the right- hand lane on busy sections of three-lane freeways. The RACV had campaigned for the ban for two years, attracting support from an \\"overwhelming 83% of motorists [it] surveyed\\". He was appointed Treasurer in 2014 after the election of the Andrews Labor Government in November 2014. His first budget in May 2015 provided for the biggest spend on education in Victoria's history.

He found that the global fall in coffee prices resulted in an increased demand for cow dung used as manure in coffee estates in several areas in the Nilgiris and Western Ghats resulting in a large-scale export of dung transforming it from a locally produced and locally consumed manure for village agriculture to a high-value organic fertilizer for commercial export to coffee plantations. Following the dung export, livestock numbers in the region increased, aggravating grazing pressures on the forests. This work challenged the prevalent notion that resource use for subsistence is distinguishable from and preferable to commercial resource use in the context of protected-area management in India.Madhusudan, MD (2004) The Global Village: Linkages between International Coffee Markets and Grazing by Livestock in a South Indian Wildlife Reserve.

John Skinner (1772‚Äì1839) was a parish vicar and amateur antiquarian and archaeologist operating mainly in the area of Bath and the villages of northern Somerset in the early nineteenth century.  Life  Skinner was born in Claverton and educated at Oxford, before becoming vicar of Camerton, Somerset from 1800 to 1839. He excavated numerous antiquities, especially barrows, such as those at Priddy, Stoney Littleton and the site which later became RAF Charmy Down; and he made visits for antiquarian purposes to many places.Coombs, Howard and Peter (eds), Journal of a Somerset Rector (OUP, 1971, 1984) pp 508‚Äì510 has a fill list of all his tours up to 1832. He carried excavations at Priddy Nine Barrows and Ashen Hill Barrow Cemeteries opening many of the barrows identified cremation burials in an oval cyst which was covered by a flat stone just below where ground level would have been in the Bronze Age. He also uncovered bronze daggers and spear head, decorative amber beads, a bronze ring and a small incense cup. Before his role as the vicar of Camerton from 1800 to 1839, he worked in a lawyers office.  Writings  His journals (1803‚Äì34), published many years after his death, are reckoned to be an important historical document, and they are preserved at the British Library. He also left other manuscripts and published accounts of a West Country tour (1797), Hadrian's Wall (1801) and the isle of Anglesey (1802). His 1802 visit to Anglesey to see the island's Celtic remains, began by rowing across the Menai Strait to land at Llanidan. His view was that the Old Church of St Nidan \\"seems superior to the generality of Welsh buildings of the kind\\", with its double roof and two bells, but he also said that \\"the interior of the building has little to attract notice\\". His tour of Wales in 1835, when he was 63, now consists of 4 bound volumesBritish Library, Egerton Mss 3110‚Äì3113 comprising descriptive text (rather difficult to read) and nearly 750 sketches, an average of 15 a day, starting with coastal scenes taken when on the packet from Bristol to Swansea, landscapes, castles, abbeys, cromlechs, inscribed stones and towns, but rarely mansions. His obsession with Roman roads is reflected in the illustrations ‚Äì any road which was reasonably straight was sketched and commented on.  Death  Skinner committed suicide by shooting himself in 1839, despite which he may have been buried in consecrated ground at Camerton.  References   Further reading  * Coombs, Howard and Arthur N.

Since the 1950s, the courts have been more willing to conclude that there was intention to create a trust, rather than hold that the trust is void. \\"Certainty of subject matter\\" means that it must be clear what property is part of the trust. Historically the property must have been segregated from non-trust property; more recently, the courts have drawn a line between tangible and intangible assets, holding that with intangible assets there is not always a need for segregation. \\"Certainty of objects\\" means that it must be clear who the beneficiaries, or objects, are. The test for determining this differs depending on the type of trust; it can be that all beneficiaries must be individually identified, or that the trustees must be able to say with certainty, if a claimant comes before them, whether he is or is not a beneficiary. There are four categories of uncertainty that can affect the validity of a trust: conceptual uncertainty, evidential uncertainty, ascertainability and administrative unworkability. \\"Conceptual uncertainty\\" is where the language is unclear, something which leads to the trust being declared invalid. \\"Evidential uncertainty\\" is where a question of fact, such as whether a claimant is a beneficiary, cannot be answered; this does not always lead to invalidity. \\"Ascertainability\\" is where a beneficiary cannot be found, while \\"administrative unworkability\\" is where the nature of the trust is such that it cannot realistically be carried out. Trustees and the courts have developed various ways of getting around uncertainties, including the appointment of experts to work out evidential uncertainty, and giving trustees the power to decide who is or is not a beneficiary. The rule came out of the case of Knight v Knight.(1840) 3 Beav 148 The testator, after giving away his personal and real property, added to the end of his will that \\"I trust to the justice of my successors, in continuing the estates in the male succession, according to the will of the founder of the family\\". Langdale MR, hearing the case, held that this was not specific enough to create a valid trust;Hill (1854) p.97 furthermore, to be held as valid, trust instruments would have to have: *Certainty of intention: it must be clear that the testator intends to create a trust *Certainty of subject matter: it must be clear what property is part of the trust and property, including sum of money, cannot be separated. *Certainty of objects: it must be clear who the beneficiaries (objects) are.Bowman v Secular Society [1917] AC 406 Note: The 'Three certainties' rule is not novel to Knight v Knight. It was first stated in Wright v Atkyns,(1823) Turn & R 143, 157 by Earl Eldon LC. Certainty of intention The first principle when deciding if there is certainty of intention is the nature of the language used; the words, as said in Wright v Atkyns,(1823) Turn & R 143 \\"must be imperative\\". Past this, there is no requirement that particular language be used. In Re Kayford,[1975] 1 All ER 604 Megarry J held that \\"it is well settled that a trust can be created without using the word \\"trust\\" or \\"confidence\\" or the like; the question is whether in substance a sufficient intention to create a trust has been manifested\\". In Paul v Constance, [1977] 1 All ER 195 it was held that the phrase \\"the money is as much yours as it is mine\\" was sufficient to translate to a trust. A trust will not be formed if it is clear that some other intention was there, such as the intention to make a pure gift, as in Jones v Lock.(1865) LR 1 Ch App 25Edwards (2007) p.93 Historically, precatory words such as \\"it is hoped\\" and \\"it is desired\\" were held to be valid. Since Lambe v Eames,[1871] 6 Ch App 597 the courts have instead taken the approach that the circumstances and the reading of the statement as a whole are the factors, and that no particular words will impose a trust on their own.Edwards (2007) p.95 It is possible to create an express trust without being aware that one is doing so, so long as the court can determine from the person's intention that a beneficial entitlement should be conferred which the law (or equity) will enforce. In the Constance case, Constance was described as a man of \\"unsophisticated character\\" who did not know he was creating a trust see: \\"Byrnes v Kendle [2011] HCA 26 ‚Äì nevertheless, the courts found that was what he had done. In Re Kayford, the company involved took actions to protect its customers by moving their funds into a separate bank account. Even though they had never indicated a desire to create a trust, their intention had been in line with the purpose of a trust, and thus it was considered valid.[1975] 1 All ER 604 Many trusts are formed through wills, which create additional issues when determining intention. In Re Hamilton,[1895] 2 Ch 370 Lindley LJ set out the standard rule that to \\"take the will you have to construe and see what it means, and if you come to the conclusion that no trust was intended you say so\\"; essentially that judges should not simply assume that there is a trust. This literal approach was followed until the 1950s; since then, the judiciary have been more willing to interpret trust documents in such a way as to make the trusts valid rather than void.Hudson (2009) p.87 According to Byrnes v Kendle, the question that needs to be answered in determining whether a certainty of intention exists is \\"What is the meaning of what the parties have said?\\" and not \\"What did the parties mean to say?\\" Byrnes v Kendle [2011] HCA 26 [53]. Certainty of subject matter It is a requirement that the subject matter be certain ‚Äî that the property intended to be in the trust be separated from other property, showing clarity in what is intended to be trust property. If there is no clear separation, the trust will fail, as in Re Goldcorp Exchange Ltd.[1994] 2 All ER 806Hudson (2009) p.97 This point was illustrated by Re London Wine Co (Shippers) Ltd,[1986] PCC 121 where creditors of a bankrupt wine trading company argued that they should be able to claim the wine they had paid for. The problem was that these bottles were not individually identifiable, and Oliver J held that: A sum of money, say 10,000, does not satisfy the requirement, rendering uncertainty. This is part of the \\"orthodox\\" or \\"strict\\" rule, along with Re Goldcorp. The exception to this rule is found in Hunter v Moss,[1994] 1 WLR 452 which concerned 50 shares meant to be transferred to an employee out of a total holding of 950. These shares were not individually identified, but Dillon LJ held that this was irrelevant because the shares were all of the same type and in the same company, and so it made no difference which particular shares were transferred.Hudson (2009) p.102 This was applied in Re Harvard Securities,[1997] 1 WLR 934 where Neuberger J held that there was a difference between tangible property, such as wine, and intangible property, such as shares. Intangible property, by its very nature, does not require segregation.Hudson (2009) p.104 A failure in the formality of this head would lead to the property being result back to the estate on resulting trust. Certainty of objects There is a requirement that the beneficiaries of a trust, known as the objects, be certain. Within express trusts this is a particularly complex area, because the test used to determine certainty varies between fixed trusts, mere powers and discretionary trusts.Hudson (2009) p.117 Fixed trusts are trusts for a specific, named list of individuals, with Alastair Hudson giving the example of \\"¬£10,000 to be held upon trust equally for the complete team of 11 Sunderland Football Club players who started the 1992 Cup Final at Wembley\\". The test for fixed trusts is that the trustees must be able to give a complete list of the beneficiaries, as laid down in IRC v Broadway Cottages.[1955] Ch 20 If there are any potential beneficiaries who the trustees are not certain of, or the trustees cannot compile a complete list, the trust is void for uncertainty.Hudson (2009) p.120 A more complex test is found with mere powers. These are where a person is granted the power (the ability) to exercise a trust-like power, but without any obligation to do so, such as \\"the trustee may give ¬£1,000 to X\\", or \\"the trustee can, at his discretion, give ¬£1,000 to X\\" as opposed to \\"the trustee shall give ¬£1,000 to X\\". In Re Hay's ST,[1981] 3 All ER 786 Megarry VC said that: The holder of a mere power is therefore free to do what he wants with the property he holds; if he fails to consider his exercise of the power, the courts may force him to do so. The leading test for mere powers is the \\"any given postulant\\" test, laid down in Re Gulbenkian.[1968] Ch 126 This states that the trustees must be able to say with certainty, when a potential beneficiary comes before them, that he either is or is not a beneficiary.Hudson (2009) pp.123‚Äì4 Discretionary trusts are trusts which require that the trustees exercise their powers, in the same way as a fixed trust, but allow some discretion in how to do so, in a similar manner to mere powers. Since trustees hold the discretionary power to choose how to act under an established boundary set out by the settlor of a trust, evidential certainty is not relevant and does not affect discretionary trusts anyway. The leading test of certainty of objects here is also the \\"any given postulant test\\", applied to discretionary trusts in McPhail v Doulton.[1970] 2 WLR 1110 The courts attempted to mitigate this test in Re Baden‚Äôs Deed Trusts (no 2);[1973] Ch 9 however, all three judges of the Court of Appeal gave separate reasons. Stamp LJ had an approach based entirely on the facts, with no greater impact on certainty of objects. Sachs LJ took the approach that the burden of proof was on the claimants to prove they were beneficiaries, not on the trustees to prove the trust was valid.Hudson (2009) p.127 Megaw LJ, however, took the approach that a trust could be valid, even with uncertain beneficiaries, if there was a \\"core number\\" of beneficiaries who were certain.Hudson (2009) p.128 Megaw LJ's stand reflects the current position. Otherwise, trusts would have been failed if there is one individual who cannot be said to be the \\"given postulant\\". Uncertainty Where there is not sufficient clarity, the trust may be held void as uncertain. The applicable forms of uncertainty have been categorised as: #Conceptual uncertainty. #Evidential uncertainty. #Ascertainability. #Administrative unworkability.Hudson (2009) p.143 Conceptual uncertainty is the \\"most fundamental in the validity of a trust or power\\", and is where the language used in the trust is unclear. Examples include where familiar but overly vague terms are used, such as \\"good customers\\" or \\"useful employees\\"; if the concept cannot be certain, the trust fails.Re Gulbenkian‚Äôs Settlements [1970] AC 508 Evidential uncertainty, on the other hand, is where there is a question of fact it is impossible to answer, such as when a claimant cannot prove he is a beneficiary. This does not necessarily invalidate the trust, as Jenkins J (as he was then) said in Re Coxen:[1948] Ch 747 The next type of uncertainty, ascertainability, is where it is impossible to find the beneficiaries, either because they have died, moved or changed names. This is not necessarily fatal; the test for deciding if it is or not was laid out by Wynn-Parry J as: \\"mere difficulty of ascertainment is not of itself fatal to the validity of the gift. As has been pointed out, it is a matter of degree, and it is only when one reaches, on the evidence, a conclusion that it is so vague or that the difficulty is so great that it must be treated as virtually incapable of resolution, that one is entitled, to my mind, to say that a gift of that nature is void for uncertainty\\". If a beneficiary cannot be found despite strenuous steps to find one, the trustees can apply for a Benjamin Order, named after the case of Re Benjamin,[1902] 1 Ch 723 which authorises them to distribute the property as if the beneficiary is dead.Hudson (2009) p.145 The final type of uncertainty is administrative unworkability ‚Äî where the trust is, by its very nature, so impractical that the trustees cannot carry out their duties. Where this prevents the trustees carrying out their duties, the trust will be declared invalid, and not applied.Hudson (2009) p.146-7 Resolving uncertainties Drafters use three principal devices to resolve problems of potential uncertainty. These are: #To provide that an expert can give advice as to who is or is not a beneficiary; #to give the trustees power to decide who is or is not a beneficiary; #and to allow the trustees to grant property to almost anyone, hoping this will reduce the risk of uncertainty.Hudson (2009) p.138 The first device has been approved by the courts: in Re Tuck's Settlement Trusts,[1978] 2 WLR 411 Lord Denning allowed the court and trustees to engage a Chief Rabbi to determine whether a beneficiary's wife was \\"of the Jewish faith\\" which determined the beneficiary's eligibility to the trust. Though this condition was conceptually uncertain, owing to the court's inability to determine with certainty whether someone is of a particular faith, the trust document explicitly set out that a Chief Rabbi could determine it. Lord Denning stating \\"any conceptual uncertainty\\" was \\"cured by the Chief Rabbi clause\\". The second device was condemned as ineffective by Jenkins J in Re Coxen, when he wrote: As such, simply giving the trustees this power was not enough to defeat uncertainties. If, however, the testator \\"had sufficiently defined\\" the way in which trustees should exercise their judgement, it would be valid.Hudson (2009) p.140 The final device is to give the trustees the power to give trust property to \\"anyone in the world\\" or to \\"anyone whom the trustees consider appropriate\\". This has two problems; firstly, the class could be too broad to be administratively workable, and second, the courts are unable to judge if the power has been exercised appropriately. However, in Re Hay's Settlement Trust, Megarry V-C held that, exercised properly, this sort of agreement could be administratively workable, and would not be immediately void.[1982] 1 WLR 202 But if the gift were given to a wide class of people for a charitable purpose, it will be valid.Re Smith [1932] 1 Ch. 153 See also *Certainty in English contract law References Bibliography  * Category:English trusts law ","title":"Three certainties"},{"id":"11170658","text":"Lieutenant-General Sir Henry James FRS MRIA (1803-1877) was a Royal Engineers officer who served as the director-general of the Ordnance Survey, the British Government mapping agency, from 1854 to 1875. Sir Henry was described by the agency itself as \\"perhaps Ordnance Survey's most eccentric and egotistical Director General\\".A brief history of Ordnance Survey , Ordnance Survey. Sir Henry spent most of his life working for the Ordnance Survey and after becoming its head he introduced the new science of photography. He also would later claim to be the inventor of the process known as Photozincography or Zinco. Sir Henry also played a part in the resolving of the battle of the scales. Career and early life Born in 1803 at Rose Vale near St Agnes, Cornwall, he was the fifth son of John James of Truro and Jane, daughter of John Hoskers. He attended a grammar school in Exeter, going on to study at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich; Upon leaving he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 22 September 1826. He was promoted to captain in 1846 and then to Colonel in 1857.R. H. Vetch, rev. E. Baigent \\"James, Sir Henry (1803-1877) surveyor\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography In 1827 he joined the Ordnance Survey and spent the majority of his career working for it, mainly in Ireland, though after a brief stint at the Admiralty, he eventually climbed through the ranks to take charge of the Edinburgh Office of the Ordnance Survey in 1850. His appointment to become head of the Ordnance Survey was controversial as his father-in-law Major- General Edward Watson RE aided him above two more obvious candidates. He married Anne, the daughter of Major General Watson, Royal Engineers. Director-General A picture showing the photography building and Henry James In 1854, at the age of 51, he became Superintendent of the Ordnance Survey, taking over from Lieutenant Colonel Lewis Hall. He was far more experienced than his predecessor having worked most of his life for the Survey.T. Owen & E. Pilbeam, Ordnance Survey: Map Makers to Britain since 1791, (Southampton: Ordnance Survey; London: H.M.S.O., 1992), p.53 Upon assuming the directorship, Sir Henry became involved in the battle of the scales. While the Ordnance Survey had surveyed a large part of the country, the scale at which the maps should be made and what was the most useful had yet to be decided. Sir Henry was a firm believer in the 1.2500 scale, and he used his position to effect this change despite the less than full approval of his superiors.T. Owen & E. Pilbeam, Ordnance Survey: Map Makers to Britain since 1791, (Southampton: Ordnance Survey; London: H.M.S.O., 1992), pp. 53-56 James created a photography department to the Ordnance Survey in 1855 as a means of reducing the scale of maps. He claimed to have invented photozincography, a photographic method of producing printing plates. In fact, the process had been developed by two of his staff. However James was the driving force behind using the process to create and publish a facsimile of the Domesday Book in the 1860s. Sir Henry has been called, by T. Owen, one of the greatest image builders the Ordnance Survey ever had, because Sir Henry made all the advances he and his department made freely available.T. Owen & E. Pilbeam, Ordnance Survey: Map Makers to Britain since 1791, (Southampton: Ordnance Survey; London: H.M.S.O., 1992), pp. 53-61 This was taken up by many foreign governments who were suitably impressed, the Queen of Spain making him a member of the Order of Isabella the Catholic in 1863; which he added to his knighthood of 1860 for services to science. Sir Henry James continued using his photozincographic process to preserve historic manuscripts. He went on to publish a whole series of English historical documents, the process of which continued on after his death.G. Wakeman, Aspects of Victorian Lithography: Anastatic printing and photozincography, (Wymondham: Brewhouse Press, 1970), pp.56-58 Similarly he ordered the Ordnance Survey of Jerusalem which was commissioned to help improve the water supply to the city. A copy of this map still survives at the National Archives. Retirement Due to failing health Sir Henry retired in 1875 at the age of 72, having been Director General of the Ordnance Survey for 21 years. His retirement was welcomed by his colleagues and soon after his departure a thinly veiled attack on his running of the survey was released in the Hampshire Independent in 1875.T. Owen & E. Pilbeam, Ordnance Survey: Map Makers to Britain since 1791, (Southampton: Ordnance Survey; London: H.M.S.O., 1992), p.66 Sir Henry James died on 14 June 1877, at the age of 75, at his home in Southampton. Despite his death his mark remained on the Ordnance Survey, with a plaque with his name and the date being attached to every building at the Ordnance Survey offices that was built during his tenure.

After 1544 he became the first ruler of the principality of Anhalt- Pl√∂tzkau. George was the third (but second surviving) son of Ernest I, Prince of Anhalt-Dessau, by his wife Margarete, daughter of Henry I, Duke of M√ºnsterberg-Oels and granddaughter of George of Podƒõbrady, King of Bohemia. Life He was mainly brought up with his brothers John V and Joachim I by his devout mother. After the death of his father in 1516, he inherited Anhalt- Dessau as a co-ruler with his brothers (at first with their mother serving as regent). With the assistance of his kinsman Adolph, the Bishop of Merseburg, George was elevated to the rank of Canon in that see in 1518, and attended the University of Leipzig, where the theologian Georg Helt of Forchheim became his \\"highly beloved teacher.\\" In 1524 Adolph consecrated George as a priest. That he might be better able to refute Lutheran beliefs, he made a thorough study of the Bible, the Church Fathers, and church history. The extreme emotional tensions and qualms of conscience into which his investigations brought him induced a violent illness that left its mark on him for the rest of his life. It was only after his mother's death (28 June 1530) that he made peace with his religious convictions; from the time of the Diet of Augsburg in 1530 both George and his brothers allied themselves with the Lutherans. After the first Evangelical celebration of the Mass at Dessau, on Maundy Thursday in 1534, George visited the district churches, making the fewest possible changes in the church practises in accordance with his natural disposition and with Luther's acquiescence. In the interest of peace, he sought to deter Luther, in 1538, from publishing his tract \\"Against the Bishop of Magdeburg\\" (Wider den Bischof zu Magdeburg) and persuaded him in 1542 not to circulate his sharply worded tract on the feud of Wurzen. In 1544 the protector of Merseburg Cathedral, Maurice of Saxony, appointed his brother Augustus as administrator, but because the latter was not a cleric, Maurice designated George as his \\"coadjutor in spiritual affairs.\\" That year, he and his brothers decided to divide their principality of Anhalt-Dessau formally; George received Pl√∂tzkau. In his new capacity as coadjutor, George forthwith proceeded, in company with Antonius Musa, just then appointed cathedral preacher at Merseburg, to visit all of the cathedral parishes, exhibiting great patience, tactful discretion, and forbearance. He next conferred with Maurice in the matter of a prospective liturgy, which, in accordance with his suggestions and by virtue of the deliberations of the consistories of Merseburg and Meissen, was officially completed at Altenzelle in 1545. From then on George convened the cathedral clergy twice a year to a synod in Merseburg Cathedral, and on such occasions discoursed upon the questions and evils of the time (and also upon proper official conduct). He based these conciones synodicae on outlines furnished to him by Melanchthon. Of the many sermons which he delivered in the cathedral, only a few have been preserved. They are distinguished by temperate and lucid exposition. When the Schmalkald War broke out in spite of his efforts to prevent it, George received under his roof the fugitive Camerarius and his family. He also interceded for Jonas, who had incurred the anger of Maurice of Saxony, and sought to restrain the clergy from \\"suspicious and frivolous words that might serve to cause discord.\\" Although he \\"hated\\" the Augsburg Interim, he felt that he ought to lend a hand in the preparation of the Leipzig Interim, in order to preclude still worse results. In 1549 the emperor's candidate Michael Helding (Sidonius) was postulated by the chapter as Bishop of Merseburg. Until his arrival, George was to continue administering the diocese. To strengthen the Lutheran confession as firmly as possible before the threatening storm, he now delivered his powerful sermons \\"On the False Prophets,\\" and \\"On the Right Worthy Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ,\\" which were directed both against Rome and Protestant religious fanatics. Afterward he retired to his estates in Anhalt. Traveling often to Warmsdorf, he continued to preach there, and when the occasion presented itself, he sought to mediate the Osiandrian dispute. He died unmarried after lingering sickness, and Melanchthon composed his epitaph. His unfeigned piety, gentleness, and love of peace, his benevolence and freedom of service, all earned him the honorable epithet \\"devout\\" or \\"pious.\\" His theology was that of Luther. His personal library has been preserved intact, and is now part of the Anhaltische Landesb√ºcherei at Dessau, along with an exhibition to honor his 500th birthday.

It actually comprises two entirely separate bridges, one of 4,414 feet long carrying the northbound carriageway, which was the longest motorway bridge in England when it was opened in July 1963, and one 4,500 feet long carrying the southbound carriageway which was opened in 1995. The longest single span is the one of 336 feet crossing the ship canal. In July 2002 a failed roller bearing was discovered and it became necessary to close all but one northbound lane. As the M6 at the time carried an estimated 150,000‚Äì160,000 vehicles per day, this led to serious congestion. The viaduct was not completely reopened to daytime traffic until February 2005, and subsequently remained partially closed at night for further remedial work to take place. In all, 148 bearings were replaced, with the repair scheme costing around ¬£52 million. Given the bridge's height and openness to the elements it has frequently been the subject of speed reductions due to strong gusts of wind that badly affect the stability of high-sided vehicles. On several occasions lane closures have resulted as a consequence of articulated vehicles simply being blown over. However, the open sides of the bridge are a deliberate design feature to reduce the likelihood of snow drifts building on the carriageways. In April 2011 a massive free party took place under the bridge, with reportedly over 5,000 ravers in attendance. 1971 accident At approximately 8am on 13 September 1971 thick fog led to a catastrophic multiple vehicle crash on the viaduct. More than 200 cars, trucks and tankers piled up, five vehicles burst into flames, 10 people were killed and 70 injured. It was the worst accident ever recorded on British roads at that time.

The Alpini have a very strong group identity, as they were recruited for over a hundred years locally from the people living in the valleys of the Italian Alps. This meant that every man from a village had served with all the other men - be it the younger or older - in his village in the same company of the same battalion of the same regiment and thus shared a common tradition. Therefore, even as veterans every Alpino would keep on showing his belonging to the Alpini by becoming a member of the ANA (Associazione Nazionale Alpini or National Alpini Association), which defines itself a quick reaction reserve corps to the active Alpini units. Because of this constant readiness of its members the ANA has been nicknamed 10th Alpini Regiment. Accordingly, the Italian Army never had a 10th Alpini Regiment.

History The Trent and Mersey Canal was conceived as a way to provide a link between Liverpool and Hull, passing through the Potteries. It was authorised by an Act of Parliament in 1766, and with James Brindley acting as engineer, its were completed eleven years later in 1777. Brindley also built the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal, which was begun at much the same time as the Trent and Mersey, and was completed in 1772. It joined the Trent and Mersey Canal at Great Haywood, and was part of his Grand Cross plan to link four English estuaries: the Humber, Thames, Severn and Mersey. Haywood Junction therefore became a major transport interchange. Location At Great Haywood, the Trent and Mersey Canal heads north, as it continues its ascent from Derwent Mouth towards its short summit near Stoke on Trent. Haywood Lock is just to the south, while Hoo Mill Lock is a little further to the north. The River Trent runs to the west of the canal, much too small at this point to support navigation. Derwent Mouth, where the canal joins the river, is from the junction, while Etruria Lock, where the summit level begins, is away. The Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal heads west from the junction. The Trent and Mersey towpath is carried over it by a bridge, and almost immediately, it crosses the River Trent on an aqueduct. It follows the valley of the River Sow, which joins the Trent below the junction, and soon reaches Tixall Wide, a broad expanse of water, which, although it looks like a lake, is deep enough to allow boats to reach its edges. Shugborough Park and Hall, now owned by the National Trust, is located to the south, and Tixall Gatehouse is to the north. The canal ascends through Tixall Lock, after which is crossed the Sow on another aqueduct. Tixall Lock is from the junction. Shugborough Hall was begun in 1695, was extended in the 1760s, and some remodelling was carried out at the end of the eighteenth century by Samuel Wyatt. Internally, the plasterwork is magnificent, and the building is grade I listed. Many of the structures within the grounds are also listed. Tixall Lodge is a small octagonal-shaped building with a stone dome, which bears the date 1807. It is grade II listed, as is the roving bridge at the junction. Just to the south of Haywood Lock, a bridge carries a footpath from Great Haywood to Shugborough Hall. The path crosses the Trent at Essex Bridge, a grade I listed structure with fourteen arches, which is only wide. It was probably built in the 1500s, and is virtually unaltered.

It originates from Kendal in Cumbria, England. Kendal Mint Cake is popular among climbers and mountaineers, especially those from the United Kingdom, as a source of energy. History Kendal Mint Cake is based on a traditional recipe known as mint cake, peppermint tablet, and various other names. There are currently three companies that still produce Kendal Mint Cake. The origin of the cake is allegedly the result of a batch of glacier mint sweets that went wrong. In 1869 Joseph Wiper, who married into the Thompson family of confectioners based in Kendal, supposedly left the boiled solution for glacier mints overnight and it turned cloudy and solidified. The 'mint cake' was then discovered in the morning.Tom Holman, A Lake District Miscellany, Frances Lincoln, 2007 Wiper began producing mint cake, with several other confectioneries following suit. After Joseph Wiper emigrated to Canada in 1912 his great-nephew, Robert Wiper, took over the family business. Robert marketed Kendal mint cake as an energy snack used on famous expeditions, including the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition led by Sir Ernest Shackleton, which largely led to its rise in international popularity amongst mountaineers and hikers.Advertisement for Robert Wiper's Original Kendal Mint Cake.

Neo-Zionists consider these lands part of Israel and advocate their settlement by Israeli Jews. Some advocate the transfer of Arabs not only from these areas but also from within the Green Line. The term \\"Post- Zionism\\" entered Israeli discourse following the publishing of a book by Uri Ram in 1993. In the same volume, Gershom Shafir contrasted Post-Zionism with what he termed Neo-Zionism. In a widely cited 1996 essay, sociologist Uri Ram used the term Neo-Zionism to describe a political and religious ideology that developed in Israel following the 1967 Six-Day War. He considers it as an \\"exclusionary, nationalist, even racist, and antidemocratic political-cultural trend\\" in IsraelUri Ram \\"Historiosphical Foundations of the Historical Strife in Israel\\" in Israeli Historical Revisionism: from left to right, Anita Shapira, Derek Jonathan Penslar, Routledge, 2002, pp.57-58. that evolved in parallel with, and in opposition to, the left-wing politics of Post-Zionism and Labor Zionism. Ideology Uri Ram contends that Neo-Zionism is not a new phenomenon, instead arguing that it emerged from the Six-Day War in 1967 and the conquest of Jerusalem. Ram contends that Jerusalem is the symbolic capital of Neo-Zionism, while Post-Zionism is orientated around Tel Aviv. It rose with the anxiety following the near loss of the 1973 war. Neo-Zionists consider \\"secular Zionism\\", particularly the labor version, as too weak on nationalism and that it never understood the impossibility of Arabs and Jews living together in peace. Neo-Zionists claim that the Arab attitude to Israel is inherently rooted in anti-Semitism and that it is a Zionist illusion to think living in peace and together with them is possible. They consider Arabs in Israel to be a fifth column and to pose a demographic threat to the Jewish majority in Israel. From their point of view, the only solution for achieving peace is through \\"deterrence and retaliation\\" or preferably \\"transfer by agreement\\" of the Israeli Arabs and the Palestinian population of the occupied Palestinian Territories to neighboring Arab states.Uri Ram, \\"The Future of the Past in Israel - A Sociology of Knowledge Approach\\", in Benny Morris, Making Israel, pp. 210-211. Uri Ram characterizes both Neo-Zionism and Post-Zionism as reactions to the post-nationalist environment. For Neo-Zionism, \\"the weakness of Israeli Nationalism derives from his alienation of Jewish sources and culture (...). Only a new national-religious and orthodox coalition [could] cure Zionism of this moral bankruptcy\\". Neo-Zionists consider all areas under Israeli military control to be part of \\"the biblical Land of Israel\\". Neo-Zionists assert that the goal of Jewish statehood is not only about creating a safe refuge for Jews but also about the national-historic destiny of the people of Israel in the land of Israel. For Uri Ram, Neo- Zionism is a reinterpretation of Zionism that is religious rather than secular. Judaism, instead of being a peripheral cultural tradition, is a core element in his definition. In Ram's formulation, Post-Zionism is globalist and liberal, while Neo-Zionism is local and ethno-religious. Asima Ghazi-Bouillon challenges Ram's classification of Neo-Zionism as anti-globalist. He instead sees some strains of Neo-Zionism as globalist, similar to Neo-Conservatism and Neo-Nationalism. Whereas Post-Zionism was a largely unsuccessful direct challenge to Zionism, Neo-Zionism is instead a challenge to Labour Zionism. Asima Ghazi-Bouillon argues that Neo-Zionism is not entirely an ethno- religious movement but also incorporates a national security discourse. Ilan Papp√© sees four currents which have contributed to Neo-Zionism‚Äôs rise: The conversion of the Haredim to Zionism; the settler movement combined with the state funding of Yeshivas; the culturally insular and economically deprived Mizrahi community; and finally the integration of Israel into the global capitalist system. Representation Uri Ram uses the Movement for Greater Israel and the Gush Emunim settler movement founded in 1974 as examples of Neo-Zionism and its precursors, Gush Emunim being a hybrid of religion and nationalism. Ram also labels parts of Likud and the National Religious Party, as well as other, smaller, splinter parties including Yisrael BaAliyah, Moledet, Tehiya and Tzomet as Neo-Zionist. In the media Neo-Zionism is associated with Arutz Sheva. According to Yishai Fleisher, Arutz Sheva director of programming and founder of the Kumah neo-Zionist lobby, \\"Zionism is the yearning of the Jewish people to come back to the land of Israel with the creation of the Jewish commonwealth and the era of the third Temple. It's a renewal of lost values, and an answer to post-Zionism. If post-Zionism is the theory that Israel was created and the project is now finished, then neo- Zionism states that we are far from done with the project. The Jewish people are not yet back home, and we have yet to educate Jews to the concept of living a Torah life in the land of Israel.\\" Some associations in Israel, such as Im Tirtzu, defend Neo-Zionist ideology. Ronen Shoval, founder of the association states that \\"We need every Jewish heart and Zionist soul. Coordinators and activists of Im Tirtzu are hereby called to the flag. (...) [W]e will turn the Hebrew University into a Zionist society, and continue the second Zionist revolution!\\" His aims are \\"to restore Zionism to the center - for poets to poetize Zionism, for the writers to write Zionism, for academia to support Zionism and for the Ari Folmans (...) to make films about our ethos. Just as there are movies about gladiators, we will have movies about Judah Maccabee. What's wrong with that?\\" Critics According to Uri Ram, \\"Neo-Zionism (...) is an exclusionary, nationalist, even racist, and antidemocratic political-cultural trend, striving to heighten the fence encasing Israeli identity\\"; a point of view also reported by Gilbert Achcar. According to Dana Eyal, \\"[her] country is hijacked by a group of racist religious Jews, who are much more of a threat to Israel than any Arab or Muslim country, including Iran\\". She gives the example of children of illegal immigrants born and living in Israel for years and that neo-Zionist groups want to see expelled because their presence is un-Zionistic. She thinks that \\"[t]his very narrow definition of Zionism dictates that Israel is and will remain a racist Jewish state\\" but also \\"that in Israel itself there is a (lazy) majority that is far from this. Zionism for us equals patriotism much like it does to Americans; wanting the best for your country, believing in its principals and defending it when necessary. Only we don't believe in many of the neo-orthodox principals popping out like mushrooms in the rain. For that matter, we no longer feel very Zionistic in an environment that embraces totality and purity of race (a calamitous similarity to things that should not be named)\\".Dana Agmon, Neo-Zionism  Israel's True Threat, The Huffington Post, October 12, 2010. Post-Zionists have argued that Israel must choose between a Post-Zionist future and a Neo-Zionist future. Today, Israeli centrists have come to view both \\"Post-Zionism\\" and \\"Neo-Zionism\\" positions as threats to their position.

It was the first garden city in Germany. The northern section of Hellerau absorbed the village of Klotzsche, where some 18th century buildings remain. Origins Based on the ideas of Ebenezer Howard, businessman Karl Schmidt-Hellerau founded Hellerau near Dresden in 1909. The idea was to create an organic, planned community. Several well-known architects participated in its construction, including Richard Riemerschmid, Heinrich Tessenow, Hermann Muthesius, Kurt Frick, Georg Metzendorf, Wilhelm Kreis and Bruno Paul. Hellerau attracted cultural visionaries from all over Europe. Among them were √âmile Jaques-Dalcroze, composer, and Mary Wigman, choreographer. Until the start of World War I annual festivals attracted further members of the progressive elite of the time. In 1921 educator A. S. Neill founded his Summerhill School here. With the establishment of the National Socialist (Nazi) government in Germany in 1933, the progressive community at Hellerau ended. Pattern The development lies on gently sloping ground and is laid out as a series of curvilinear streets, of an overall organic type form. Materials are typically cream rendered walls on a stone base, with red tile roofs and green windows (mainly with shutters). The landscape is dominated by tall conifers. The Deutsche Werkstatten, a large factory involved in the production of craft furniture, played a central role in the function of the community, but geographically lies on its southern edge. Functionally this has been superseded by a modern facility further to the south. The layout physically centres upon a small rectangular market square. Buildings are generally from one storey and attic to three storey, but all adopt a gentle cottage style. The exception to this is the large former water tower, now converted to housing use. Festspielhaus To the north-west the Festspielhaus provides a cultural focus. This housed a Rhythmic Gymnastics centre during the Second World War. The central building here still holds some remnants of its communist past, when it served as a Russian barracks from 1945 until 1989. The building has been restored and is now a base for a dance company. Surrounding buildings are partly restored, with sections also hoped to create a base for resident artists. The community park surrounding the complex, Golgi Park, creates a multi-functional space serving the local community.

She was first introduced in November 1999, created by then-head writer Tom Langan. Bjorlin played Chloe nearly continuously from 1999 through 2005, and from 2007 until 2011, when she decided not to renew her contract with the soap. In 2012, Bjorlin announced during an interview with TV Guide that she would return to Days of our Lives once again, making her return on January 7, 2013 and remaining through April 16, 2013. Bjorlin returned to the role, in a two- episode stint in celebration of the soap's fiftieth anniversary celebration on August 3, 2015. She returned for another visit in January 2016 and returned full-term in June 2016. Chloe arrived in Salem in the year 1999, having lived in an orphanage for fifteen years. She reunited with her birth mother, Nancy Wesley and they faced issues in their mother-daughter relationship. Chloe's social life was also bad as she was bullied at school for her personality and appearance, leading to her being popularly called \\"Ghoul girl\\" by her peers. In spite of this, she managed to form a relationship with Philip Kiriakis. Chloe, who is also an opera singer, has diverted away from her early dark image over the years. She has been married three times, two of which have ended in divorce with one being annulled. She also shares a child with her late ex-husband Daniel Jonas, Parker. Casting and creation The role of Chloe Lane was introduced by head writer Tom Langan in November 1999. She has been portrayed by Nadia Bjorlin since the beginning. The character was born on August 20, 1984. Her birth-date was originally 1985, as she appeared to be 16 years old in 2001. Bjorlin's contract on Days of our Lives lasted until June 13, 2003 and she departed the series. She briefly returned from December 24, 2003 to January 12, 2004. She had another stint from August 13 to September 2004. She returned on a recurring status from December 2004 to September 16, 2005, when she left Days of our Lives to pursue a role in the UPN series Sex, Love & Secrets. She returned on November 29, 2007 after an absence. Discussing her return, the actress said: \\"I love working with the people I used to and [who] I know, but it's also fun to work with new people, because you don't know what they're going to do in a scene\\". While absent, she had landed roles in primetime series, as well as working in films. She departed again in September 2011, and made her return on January 4, 2013, but departed the role a couple months later on April 16, 2013. The May 13, 2013, issue of Soaps In Depth confirmed that Bjorlin would make a brief return later in the year, airing September 24, 2013 and September 25, 2013. In March 2015, it was announced that Bjorlin would return as part of the show's fiftieth anniversary; she returned for a two-day stint on August 3 and August 4, 2015. In September 2015, it was hinted in an interview with Patrika Darbo that Bjorlin would be returning to the show at an unknown date. Bjorlin made her brief return on January 8 till 28, 2016. In December 2015, it was confirmed that Bjorlin will return as Chloe, but in a contract role, airing on June 10, 2016.  Development  =Characterization = Chloe as she appeared in 1999. Her image was extremely dark, and she was labeled \\"Ghoul girl\\" by bullies. Chloe has been described by William Keck of USA Today as: \\"soap's tragically disfigured soprano diva.\\" Chloe's teenage years weren't bright, she was often a victim of bullying at school. She had a dark personality; wearing black clothes all the time and also wearing large glasses. She had a \\"defensive\\" attitude, which allowed her to be bullied by her peers and was referred to as \\"Ghoul girl\\", and was a social outcast. They even left live chickens at her doorstep. Her turning point came when Belle Black (Kirsten Storms) and Philip Kiriakis (Jay Kenneth Johnson) befriended her. At the school dance in June 2000, she wore a bright red dress and had changed her appearance, stunning everybody. A writer of The Spokesman-Review newspaper called her a \\"stunning beauty\\". Michael Logan of TV Guide noted twelve years later in 2012 that: \\"She's had the craziest trajectory from Ghoul Girl.\\" In recent times, however, Chloe has diverted far away from her early image and her storylines focus more on her relationships, especially her habit of cheating. In 2010, Bjorlin said: \\"You know what? Chloe is not a naughty girl! She just makes bad decisions. She is always the one that gets stuck paying the ultimate consequences for her actions. She does not think things through realistically\\". Soap opera journalist Michael Fairman noted that Chloe tends to befriend women who have done her wrong, such as Nicole Walker (Arianne Zucker) and Carly Manning (Crystal Chappell), to which Bjorlin responded: \\"At least Carly was horrible within reason, but Nicole I don‚Äôt understand. It sort of adds to the fact that Chloe in her last few years, was being written like such a push-over and na√Øve. I am trying to see that she tries to see the best in all people and everyone makes mistakes.\\" When asked in 2009 who she would like to see Chloe possibly paired with, Bjorlin said E.J. DiMera (James Scott), stating: \\"I've had a lot of fun with the whole Chloe and Philip and Chloe and Brady thing, but you know I think it would be kind of fun to create some controversy and stir things up. Maybe a Chloe and EJ thing\\". =Brady Black and Philip Kiriakis= Despite her being hated at school, she developed a romance with Philip. After their first kiss, she was appalled to find out that he only invited her to the dance because he lost a bet. During this time, she found herself falling in love with Brady Black (Kyle Lowder), though still dating Philip. She suspected that Philip's father, Victor Kiriakis (John Aniston) was using Brady to break up her romance with Philip; Philip also too suspected this and warned Brady to stay away from Chloe. After her relationship with Philip ended she eventually became involved with Brady. They married in 2005; however, shortly after their marriage was destroyed because of Brady's drug addiction. When she returned in 2007, many thought it might have been her fault. In 2008, they divorced. Of this storyline, Bjorlin said: \\"I personally was kind of glad that they didn‚Äôt take it in the approach that Chloe had done something, that it was Chloe‚Äôs fault or that Chloe killed him or had been unfaithful or whatever it may have been. I‚Äôm sort of glad that in the best manner they could, they didn‚Äôt really taint the relationship in that sense and they left the characters with integrity.\\" In 2003, Philip was re-cast with Kyle Brandt, who remained in the role in 2006. Upon Bjorlin's own return to the series in 2007, Johnson had returned to the role. Of this, Bjorlin stated that it was easy for her to fall right back into place as far as Philip and Chloe's relationship goes: \\"It's sort of undeniable. Jay and I have always had a really great time working together. We sometimes can't keep it together and be serious, especially now that Philip is so serious. He's a man now, so angry and stern. We'll start cracking up and we can't stop laughing.\\" She again said in 2009: \\"I think there‚Äôs such a camaraderie and trust and respect between both of us that‚Äôs been built for years that we truly enjoy working with each other\\". =Daniel Jonas and infidelity = Shawn Christian (pictured) plays Daniel Jonas. Chloe began romancing Lucas Roberts (Bryan Dattilo) after the demise of his relationship with Sami Brady (Alison Sweeney). On New Year's Eve of 2008, they became engaged. She cheated on Lucas with Dr. Daniel Jonas (Shawn Christian) and soon went into a coma after being poisoned by Kate Roberts (Lauren Koslow), Lucas' mother. Her relationship with Daniel was popular with viewers, labeled as \\"Danloe\\". She awakened and her brief marriage to Lucas ended. She became involved with Daniel, but ended up cheating on him too. Chloe‚Äîafter being duped by Vivian Alamain into thinking Daniel and Carly were having an affair‚Äîhad a one-night stand with Philip while they were drunk and she ended up pregnant. Of this, Bjorlin stated: \\"She probably did not deal with her grief in the most appropriate way possible. Chloe does crazy things\\". Carly, feeling guilty because Chloe's being duped into thinking her and Daniel were having an affair as a cruel attempt on VIvian's part to get Chloe to kill Carly, agreed to help Chloe secretly obtain a DNA test. Chloe came to form a friendship with Carly. Bjorlin said of their friendship: \\"I was feeling slightly juvenile for awhile just spewing venom on her. It is nice that we formed this friendship.\\" Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps said during his interview with Bjorlin and Christian \\"Dr. Daniel is becoming a dim-wit! Can‚Äôt he figure something is going on behind his back?\\". Bjorlin said: \\"It is kind of hysterical that everybody in Salem knows about this cheating incident except Daniel, at this point.\\" Because the DNA test had supposedly been switched, Chloe believed herself that Daniel could very well be the baby's father. She said: \\"[Chloe] got the relief of a lifetime when she found out the baby was Daniel‚Äôs. So she thought, ‚ÄúNow I am going to have my wedding. Nothing can go wrong.\\" Chloe gave birth to a son, who she named Parker Jonas initially. However, the supposed truth came out at Parker's baptism in front of family and friends that Philip was Parker's father. This led to the end of the marriage. Having lost Daniel, Chloe sank into a state of post partum depression and tried to commit suicide. Upon returning to Salem in January 2013, she's attempting to reestablish her relationship with Daniel, since it turns out that Parker really is his son. =2011 departure = After four years on June 7, 2011, TV Line among other sources confirmed that she was to depart once again. Her last air date was September 28, 2011. Bjorlin said of her decision not to renew her contract: \\"It‚Äôs a bittersweet moment for me, but fortunately I have been at these crossroads before, and I‚Äôve always rose to the challenge in everything I pursued I will miss the cast and crew dearly, and they ‚Äî including executive producer Ken Corday ‚Äî will always be considered family to me. At the same time, I am excited for where this next chapter in my life takes me\\". While away, Bjorlin worked on the series Venice: The Series with fellow Days co-star Crystal Chappell and also appeared on the reality television show Dirty Soap, a series which followed the real lives of soap stars. She also starred in the film Divorce Invitation. Dirty Soap provided viewers with insight about her decision to leave the show. = 2013 return = Patrika Darbo (pictured) plays Chloe's mother Nancy Wesley. She returned with Chloe in 2013. Bjorlin announced during an interview with TV Guide on August 21, 2012, that she would return to the role of Chloe, with her first airdate being January 4, 2013. She began filming in September. Speaking out about all of the rumors that had circulated, Bjorlin stated: \\"I find out a lot about myself through reading magazines There was a little bit of talk throughout the year. \\"Would you ever be interested in returning?\\" That sort of thing. But never anything concrete Now the timing is right. It's been a year since we've seen Chloe. Hopefully, the audience has forgotten what she was up to.\\" Speaking of her exit storyline the previous year, Bjorlin said that she herself would have written the character out: \\"Chloe is so near and dear to my heart and even I would have written her off after that storyline. She was spiraling out of control and the fans had stopped being able to recognize the character. I couldn't recognize her, either! A lot of what made Chloe so lovable ‚Äî her integrity, her fun, her wit ‚Äî was gone and I don't blame anyone for dropping her from the show.\\" She teased the character's return, hinting that she would return as \\"herself\\", and will have good self-esteem with a stronger and more confident mentality. In addition to Chloe's return to Salem, Patrika Darbo returned as Nancy, after an eight-year absence. Darbo said that Nancy is \\"going to be supporting her daughter; whether she‚Äôs right or whether she‚Äôs gone. Family takes care of family.\\" Of working with Bjorlin again, Darbo said they \\"just fell right back into it.\\" She also noted that in the past seven years, \\"some of the things that happened to Chloe would have happened, if Nancy had been there\\" and said \\"However, she‚Äôs back now, and she might start taking care of those people who hurt her daughter.\\" Storylines =1999‚Äì2005= Chloe lived in an orphanage for the first fifteen years of her life. Nancy Wesley (Patrika Darbo) offered her the chance to move in with her, and Chloe accepted, later learning Nancy is actually her biological mother. Originally introduced as a brainy \\"nerd\\" character with few friends, Chloe hides her incredible beauty behind frumpy clothes and horn-rimmed glasses making her an outsider at Salem High where she is picked on and often referred to as \\"Ghoul Girl.\\" She becomes friends with Shawn-Douglas Brady (Jason Cook), and Belle Black. Chloe goes to a dance with the wealthy Philip Kiriakis, at which time she unveils her true appearance, and Philip immediately falls for her. They date until Chloe learns the first date was all because Philip lost a bet with Shawn. Philip wanting Chloe back, does everything possible to win her back. The two fall in love again, but it is short-lived when Brady Black comes to town. Chloe immediately bonded with Brady over their shared love of the opera. Chloe, still dating Philip, assures him that nothing is going on between them. Brady, and Chloe's relationship begins to grow closer, causing more tension in Philip and Chloe's relationship. Philip attempts to sabotage Brady to make it look like he is a thief, Chloe ends her relationship with him and pursues one with Brady. Meanwhile, Chloe is diagnosed with leukemia, and with the help of Brady searches for her birth father to provide her with bone marrow. It is ultimately revealed that Nancy's husband Dr. Craig Wesley (Kevin Spirtas) is Chloe's father, Nancy having given Chloe up for adoption without telling Craig. Chloe survives when her sister, Joy, is born and proves to be a match. Shortly after, Chloe leaves town to pursue her dream of being an opera singer in June 2003. Her relationship with Brady suffers from it. Brady is about to confront Chloe about ending their relationship, when Chloe is in a horrible car accident, her face was disfigured. Disgusted with her scars, she makes Brady believe she is dead. She does so for many months, until Brady finds out she is alive. Chloe gets several reconstructive surgeries, restoring her face to its original beauty. Chloe reveals her new face to Brady, at their wedding. After they are married, Chloe and Brady move to Vienna so Chloe can once again pursue her passion for opera singing. =2007‚Äì11= Chloe returns in 2007, without Brady. She begins to rekindle her friendship with Belle, Shawn, and Philip. Brady comes back to town, revealing that he has a drug addiction, and that is why he and Chloe broke up. Chloe pursues a relationship with Lucas Horton, but it ends when she cheats on him with Daniel Jonas.SOW: Dr. Dan & Chloe Article 2009 Chloe eventually began a relationship with Daniel. Daniel and Chloe were engaged, but their relationship was complicated when Daniel's friend, Carly Manning, came to town, and they discovered that Daniel had fathered Carly's daughter, Melanie Jonas (Molly Burnett). The situation was only complicated when Chloe had a hysterical pregnancy and was told that she would probably never have a child. One night, having been tricked by Vivian Alamain (Louise Sorel) to think that Carly and Daniel were having an affair, Chloe turned to Philip. The two slept together and when Chloe later learned she was pregnant, she did not know if the father was Daniel or Philip. Test results confirmed Daniel as the baby's father so Chloe didn't tell Daniel about the affair. Chloe married Daniel and gave birth to a son Parker. On the day of Parker's baptism, Caroline revealed that she had switched the test results, and that Philip was Parker's father. Daniel was heartbroken and left Chloe. Unable to deal with the pain of losing Daniel, Chloe slipped deep into depression and tried to commit suicide. Social services gave Philip full custody but Philip moved Chloe into the Kiriakis mansion with Parker so they could raise him together. Chloe's mental health was still fragile and during a drunken rant to Kate, Chloe threatened to take Parker and no one would ever see him again. Fearful that she would make good on her threats, Philip took Parker and moved to Chicago. Chloe tried to get herself together by giving voice lessons to students in Salem and petitioning the court for supervised visits with Parker. Then Chloe met a handsome stranger named Quinn Hudson (Bren Foster), whom she hooked up with, later finding out that he had taped the encounter and used it to blackmail her into prostitution. Quinn (later revealed to be Vivian‚Äôs estranged son) had been hired by Kate Roberts to ruin Chloe's life and keep her away from Parker. However her call girl days end when she was viciously attacked by Gus, Vivian‚Äôs manservant-turned-vigilante who was assaulting hookers, putting her into a second coma (although it was shorter this time). When she awoke from the coma she identified Gus and received a sizable reward which gave her the means to move to Chicago, to pursue a more lucrative singing career and work towards regaining custody of her son, Parker. =2013‚Äì2019= On January 7, 2013, Chloe returned to Salem and revealed to Daniel that he is actually Parker's father, hoping they could be a family again. When Chloe learned Daniel had moved on with Jennifer she set about trying to break them up. Chloe blackmailed Jennifer into rejecting Daniel, by threatening to keep Daniel from seeing Parker, going so far as to have her mother Nancy take Parker to Brazil, but not telling Daniel, so Jennifer felt she had to publicly reject Daniel and leave the hospital, to protect Daniel from losing access to his son Parker, while never revealing her true feelings. After seeing a passport at Chloe's mother Nancy's place, Daniel figured out Chloe's scheme, with help from Rafe, and reconciled with Jennifer, who also got her job back at the hospital. After that Chloe decided to go back to Chicago, leaving Parker with Daniel. On August 3, 2015, Chloe returned to Salem when she learned Daniel and Nicole were engaged and she objected to Nicole becoming Parker's stepmother. She ultimately accepted after a talk with Daniel. In January 2016, Chloe came back to Salem to comfort Nicole after Daniel died in a car accident on New Years Day. Chloe again left Salem in August 2019.

White Wolf's page dedicated to the set indicates the reasoning for calling it the third edition: \\"White Wolf's eleventh expansion for Vampire: The Eternal Struggle is a stand-alone base set. It is called Third Edition (after the Camarilla Edition, which is reckoned as the second edition).\\"V:TES Third Edition The expansion also happens to be the third set based on the Sabbat sect. It contained a whole new set of vampires, but mainly reprints of library cards. Due to insufficient quality management the distribution of the cards in the boosters and the overall printing quality was significantly worse than in previous expansions. In addition the card backs are printed upside-down (in comparison to all other expansions). De facto it is now required to use card sleeves in tournaments when a player uses cards from the 3rd Edition set mixed with cards from other expansions. These flaws caused some resentment towards the 3rd Edition set in the player community. Nonetheless the expansion won the InQuest Gamer 2007 Fan Awards for best trading card expansion.Inquest Gamer 2007 Fan Awards. Contents Part of the expansion are 4 different pre- constructed decks with 89 cards each as well as boosters with 11 cards each (5 common, 3 vampire, 2 uncommon and 1 rare). There is a total of 390 cards in this set, of which 136 cards are new, i.e. 10 new common, 10 uncommon, 10 rare cards, 6 fixed cards (from the starters) and 100 vampire cards; the rest of the 254 library cards are actually reprints from older sets. The pre- constructed decks are: * Brujah antitribu * Malkavian antritribu * Tremere antitribu * Tzimisce The vampires White Lily and Duality (also included in this set) were given as promo cards in a number of magazines. Simultaneously White Wolf released a players kit which contained half of each of the four pre-constructed starters as well as counters and an extensive example of play. Mechanics * Trifles‚ÄîIt is now allowed to play a second trifle master card if the first master card played was also a trifle. Before this the second master card couldn't be a trifle master card. * Draft Effects‚Äîa number of library cards contain a draft effect, that the card can be played during a draft format game, usually with a lesser effect and other requirements that the base version of the card. Notable Cards * Heart of Nizchetus‚Äîan equipment card which provides a very good card drawing/replacement ability that does not waste the currently unwanted cards. * Helicopter‚Äîan equipment card which allows a minion to untap once each turn after a successful action, similar to the Freak Drive card. * Mirror Walk‚Äîan action modifier requiring the Thaumaturgy discipline which gives stealth to a minion's action, while denying any combat if the action is blocked. * Wash‚Äîa master out-of-turn card which allows to counter a master card played by another player. Due to the trifle property of Wash the player is still allowed to play a master card by himself in his own master phase next turn. * Yawp Court‚Äîa master card which allows a Sabbat vampire to block a political action without regard to the stealth/intercept ratio.

It was a spin-off from the TV series Up Pompeii! Synopsis Howerd played dual roles as King Richard the Lionheart and cowardly peasant Lurkalot [his character in Up Pompeii was the slave Lurcio]. The film also featured Eartha Kitt singing \\"A Knight for My Nights\\" and Hugh Paddick (of Julian and Sandy fame in the Round the Horne BBC radio series) as Robin Hood, leader of a band of men who were camp rather than merry. Plot Eleanor of Aquitaine gave birth to twin sons ‚Äì Lurkalot first and then Richard. But the nobles of the country ‚Äì led by Sir Braggart de Bombast intercepted Lurkalot, stole him away and abandoned him in a forest to die. He was raised by a family of pigs who belonged to Sir Coward de Custard who realised he wasn't a pig and took him in as a serf. By way of remittance, Lurkalot aids his master by selling love potions and chastity belts as well as some unusual inventions in the local village as Sir Coward isn't particularly successful a noble. Lurkalot is also visited by strange \\"voices\\" in the middle of the night who speak to him and try to tell him who he really is but get drowned out by events like lightning. All grown up, Richard is bored by ruling England and decides to go on a crusade. Meanwhile, Sir Braggart de Bombast wants to acquire Sir Coward's lands and daughter for himself and makes him an offer. Sir Coward refuses but invites Sir Braggart and his followers to a banquet so as not to offend where a scene is made and Sir Coward refuses to toast Prince John. Offended, Sir Braggart challenges Sir Coward to a duel with Lady Lobelia as the prize. Lurkalot, although not a Knight, takes up the challenge as the \\"Man with no name\\" and defeats Sir Braggart's champion, Sir Grumbell de Grunt with the aid of a giant magnet. Realising that the rules of chivalry have not been met, Sir Braggart declares the duel void and declares war. Lurkalot and Lady Lobelia flee the scene to his workshop where to protect his master's daughter, he locks her up with a chastity belt. Sir Coward responds to the challenge by running away to join the crusades whilst Lurkalot, encouraged by his voices, goes to find both him and Richard the Lionheart. Once in the Holy Land, he discovers that the \\"crusades\\" are actually a Bacchanalian orgy, an excuse to leave the wives and families for a few years. Saladin is actually a friend of a crusader and started everything. Richard won't leave the Holy Land as he's in his tent with Scheherazade and insists on trying every position in the Kama Sutra. Lurkalot's voices provide inspiration and he takes all the unused weaponry and fashions them into chastity belts. He then brings feminism to Saladin's women, who go on strike, and Richard is forced to return home, albeit very unwillingly. In Germany, Richard meets a local woman and decides to stay with her. He casually tosses Lurkalot the crown and says that if he looks like him, he can be him. Lurkalot returns to his home and attempts to rally the people but he is recognised as Lurkalot and is accused of witchcraft following his earlier escape from the castle where he used his flying machine. After being ducked, he is sentenced to death by burning, but is rescued by Robin Hood. They plan an attack on Sir Braggart and are joined by Sir Coward, who is fed up with being bullied and fortified by smoking from a hookah pipe. Meanwhile Richard has had to flee to England following an ignoble episode with his German woman and returns to Lurkalot's village, where he is captured by people thinking he is Lurkalot. Sir Coward feigns severe illness to get him and Lurkalot into the castle, where they are incarcerated. He suffers withdrawal symptoms from the loss of his hookah and Lurkalot offers to make him a remedy based on sulphur and charcoal but spills in saltpetre by accident. He mixes it together, but Sir Coward, who hates taking medicine, throws it in the direction of a fire, where it ignites and blows open the door. Lurkalot calls his new invention \\"gone powder\\" and they use it to open the castle gate, where Robin Hood can attack. Meanwhile Sir Braggart duels Lurkalot and reveals that he must be Richard's twin brother. The two battle all over the castle and he is eventually forced to flee in disgrace. Richard then resumes his rule and everything is right in the land. He agrees to marry Lady Lobelia and makes Lurkalot a Knight but in the final scene, Lurkalot gets Lady Lobelia whilst Richard returns to Scheherazade.

Its grounds cover most of the valley between the Aventine Hill and the Caelian. Location The Villa Celimontana is situated on the summit of the Celian Hill in the south-east of Rome in the Rione Celio. The principal entrance is near the Piazza della Navicella, beside the Basilica Santa Maria in Domnica. A secondary entrance is situated on the Clivo di Scauro near the Basilica Santi Giovanni e Paolo. The park is a continuation of Baths of Caracalla. Site The Herm of Socrates and Seneca, found in the Villa's grounds (Pergamonmuseum) Tradition holds that Numa Pompilius met the nymph Egeria on the site, and within the grounds of the present villa, to the left of the present entrance from piazza della Navicella, was the base of the 5th cohort of the Vigiles - these Trajanic-era remains were excavated in 1820, 1931 and 1958. In the mid-16th century the site of the grounds was occupied by a vineyard belonging to the Paluzzelli family, near Santa Maria in Domnica. That family ordered excavations there which found the coloured marbles (probably from a temple) which were re-used in Sangallo's Sala Regia at the Vatican. Villa In 1553 the vineyard was acquired for 1000 gold scudi by Giacomo Mattei (who also built the 15th century building in piazza Mattei), but it was Ciriaco Mattei who transformed it into a villa in 1580, instructing the architect Giacomo Del Duca (a student of Michelangelo) to build the villa and the first garden scheme. The original villa has been much adapted, but was probably a single-floor structure with a portico along its facade, topped by a Doric frieze and balustrade which still survive. It now has a quadrangular plan with two low wings and a piazza on an artificial platform supported by large ancient walls (largely Flavian and still visible from the south side). Villa Celimontana from the south The Mattei collections began to be gutted in 1770 with the sale of 10 statues to the Vatican (including the Amazon, Pudicitia, and seated Trajan, all now at the Louvre) and in 1802 with the head of Augustus (still in the Vatican). The villa, however, remained in the Mattei family until sold by them 1802. The villa then changed hands rapidly - in 1813 it was acquired by prince Manuel de Godoy, prince of La Paz and minister of Charles IV of Spain. The villa was then taken over by Princess Marianne of the Netherlands (daughter of William I of the Netherlands), then by Frederica (princess of Prussia and of Bauffremont) in 1857, and finally by the Bavarian baron Richard Hoffman in 1869. In the First World War the Italian State confiscated the villa as the property of an enemy national, and in 1923 the most important sculptures in the gardens were moved to the Museo Nazionale Romano. In 1926 the villa was given to the Societ√† Geografica Italiana. Gardens View of the gardens of the Villa Mattei, print by Jean-Claude Richard from a painting by Hubert Robert, 1761 A path through Villa Celimontana In the gardens were displayed artworks from the Mattei collection. In 1552 Filippo Neri instituted the ceremony of Visiting the Seven Churches (San Pietro, San Giovanni in Laterano, Santa Maria Maggiore, San Paolo fuori le mura, San Lorenzo fuori le mura, San Sebastiano all'Appia Antica and Santa Croce in Gerusalemme) and the Mattei family opened their villa's grounds for pilgrims to rest in and provided them with bread, wine, cheese, eggs, apples and salami. The gardens were later redefined by Giovanni Fontana and Domenico Fontana, in a scheme including the obelisk. The gardens were also famous for their fountains, realised by Bernini for Girolamo Mattei - they included the fontana dell'Aquila (after the Mattei's heraldic emblem of the eagle) and fontana del Tritone, and have now all been relocated to the piazza dei SS.Giovanni e Paolo. (Girolamo is also mentioned in the inscription before Santi Giovanni e Paolo relating to its 1651 restoration.) In 1926 the villa gardens were granted by the state to the Commune of Rome as a public park. The park's current entrance-gate - in bugnata work, dating to the early 17th century and designed by Carlo Lambardi - was formerly the main entrance to Villa Giustiniani before being moved to the present site in 1931. To its left is the obelisk, at the end of the central route. Obelisk The obelisk. The obelisk is a small example given to the Mattei in 1582. Its lower part is made up of parts of several obelisks and is of unknown origin, but the top part (2.68m high) has hieroglyphics of Ramesses II, derives from the Temple of the Sun at Heliopolis, and was (like those now in piazza della Minerva and via delle Terme di Diocleziano) brought to Rome in antiquity to adorn the Temple of Isis in Campidoglio. In the 14th century it was placed on the steps of the Campidoglio - legend holds that the globe placed on its tip held the ashes of Augustus and that the obelisk was raised on the Campidoglio by Cola di Rienzo as a symbol of Roman liberty. It was presented to Ciriaco Mattei in 1582 by the Senate of Rome and moved to the park in 1587 as the centrepiece of the villa's theatre. Manuel de Godoy had the obelisk moved to its present position at the end of the central route by the Spanish architect Antonio Celles in 1817. It was on this occasion that it was placed on its present 16th century base, consisting of 4 lions. In the works a support broke and worker had his hand and part of his arm trapped under the obelisk (where they still remain) - they had to be removed in an emergency amputation.

History  On 15 September 1969 the IV Supply, Repairs, Recovery Battalion was formed in Bolzano as support unit of the 4th Alpine Army Corps. On 1 October 1981 the unit was renamed 4th Maneuver Logistic Battalion. On 1 September 1982 the 4th Army Corps Transport Group \\"Claudia\\" based in Eppan was merged into the battalion.

It reached number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. The song was written and composed by Brian Wilson, Artie Kornfeld, Roger Christian, and Jan Berry at Wilson's mother's house in Santa Monica. It was part of the teenage tragedy song phenomenon of that period, and one of the most popular such selections of all time. Premise The singer goes out for a leisurely drive one night in his Corvette Sting Ray, when a driver pulls up alongside in his Jaguar XKE and challenges him to a drag race. According to the song, the race starts at Sunset and Vine, traveling westbound on West Sunset Blvd., passing North La Brea Ave., North Crescent Heights Blvd., and North Doheny Dr. The original Schwab's Drug Store was located just east of Crescent Heights on Sunset. The North Whittier Drive curve, a nearly 90¬∞ right turn traveling west on Sunset Boulevard just past North Whittier Drive, may have been the \\"dead man's curve\\" in the song, but there is debate on the actual location of the curve. Coincidentally, Jan Berry, of Jan and Dean, would himself later be involved in a near-fatal incident in 1966, when he crashed his own Sting Ray into a parked truck on North Whittier Drive near (but not on) Dead Man's Curve. The song ends with the singer relating his last memories of the ill-fated race to a doctor. Sound effects of screeching tires and crashing are also heard in the song. Deadman's Curve was used as the title for the 1978 biographical nationally televised movie about Jan and Dean, starring Richard Hatch and Bruce Davison respectively portraying Berry and Torrence.

This rate can have different meanings in different countries and jurisdictions, depending on how that jurisdiction's labor law defines overtime. In many jurisdictions, additional pay is mandated for certain classes of workers when this set number of hours is exceeded. In others, there is no concept of a standard workweek or analogous time period, and no additional pay for exceeding a set number of hours within that week. The overtime rate calculates the ratio between employee overtime with the regular hours in a specific time period. Even if the work is planned or scheduled, it can still be considered overtime if it exceeds what is considered the standard workweek in that jurisdiction. A high overtime rate is a good indicator of a temporary or permanent high workload, and can be a contentious issue in labor-management relations. It could result in a higher illness rate, lower safety rate, higher labor costs, and lower productivity. United States In the United States a standard workweek is considered to be 40 hours. Most waged employees or so-called non-exempt workers under U.S. federal labor and tax law must be paid at a wage rate of 150% of their regular hourly rate for hours that exceed 40 in a week. The start of the pay week can be defined by the employer, and need not be a standard calendar week start (e.g., Sunday midnight). Many employees, especially shift workers in the U.S., have some amount of overtime built into their schedules so that 24/7 coverage can be obtained.

There she served as one of many floating ammunition depots for what was at the time the world's largest naval base. Like other \\"ammo\\" ships, the Davidson Victory was stationed at a safe distance from the anchored fleet due to her volatile cargo. She left Ulithi in the summer of 1945 en route to the Philippines to prepare for the invasion of the Japanese home islands when the Japanese surrender was announced. After the surrender the ship was directed back to the Bay Area to unload its remaining cargo and discharge its United States Navy Armed Guard and cargo crew. Due largely to its late entry into the war, the Davidson \\"never heard a shot fired in anger.\\" Nevertheless, she and her sister ships served a vital role in the war effort. The Davidson Victory continued to transport foodstuffs and other cargo to Japan under the direction of the US War Shipping Administration until 1948, when it was leased to the Pacific- Atlantic Steamship Company of Tacoma, Washington and renamed the SS Montana.

He studied history and philology (with a particular emphasis in Latin and Greek) and graduated from the university in 1911. During his student years, Orbeli accompanied his professor, Nikolai Marr, to Russian Armenia, where he took part in excavations of the ruins of the medieval Armenian capital of Ani. Marr pushed his pupil to fully immerse himself in the fields of archaeology, literature, lithography and linguistics; otherwise, Marr reasoned, he would find himself unprepared in his research and his studies. =Archaeological studies= Following his graduation, Orbeli departed for Armenia once more. He became the director of an on-site museum that was established at Ani and, during Marr's absences, frequently headed the excavations himself. He also traveled to Nagorno-Karabakh (more precisely, to the historical region of the Principality of Khachen), gathering and categorizing lithographic material. Orbeli also managed to travel to Western Armenia, where he was able to study Armenian, Seljuq, and Urartian monuments and conduct research on Armenian and Kurdish dialects. Gradually, Orbeli was emerging as the leading authority on Armenian antiquities in the world. In 1912, he became a member of the Imperial Russian Archaeological Society and in 1914, he began teaching Armenian and Kurdish studies at Saint Petersburg University. In 1916, he participated in a Russian archaeological expedition around the Lake Van region; it was here where he discovered an inscription attributed to the Urartian king Sarduri II. He continued his work at Saint Petersburg University; in 1917, he was appointed an assistant professor of Armenian-Georgian studies, but occasionally taught at Moscow's Lazarev Institute of Oriental Languages as well. =Academic work= In the years leading up to the Russian Revolution, Orbeli published a number of books, including a catalogue of artifacts found at Ani and a series of studies dealing with classical philology, Armenian history, archaeology and art. This led to his appointment to the Hermitage Museum in July 1934,Strube V. V. (red). Issledovaniia po istorii kul'tury narodov Bostoka: sbornik v chest' akademika I. A. Orbeli. Moskva Leningrad. Izdatel'stvo Akademiii Nauk SSSR, 1960, p. 9 which he would steer through the hardships of Joseph Stalin's purges. In December 1941, the deadliest month of the Siege of Leningrad, Orbeli led a festival dedicated to Ali-Shir Nava'i, a medieval Turkic poet and philosopher. Orbeli considerably enhanced the museum's holdings of Oriental art, making it one of the top Oriental art museums in the world. No less important was Orbeli's role as head of the national school of Caucasus studies. Orbeli underscored the importance of linguistic studies for proper understanding of historical processes. In 1934, as a member of the Soviet delegation, he went to Iran for the Ferdowsi millennial celebrations and visited the cities of Tehran and Mashhad.Strube V. V.

Born in Perth, he was the son of John Mylne, also a master mason, and Isobel Wilson. Practising as a stonemason, he also took on the role of architect, designing as well as building his projects. He was one of the last masters of Scottish Renaissance architecture, before new styles were imported by his successors. Alongside his professional career, he also served as a soldier and politician. He married three times but had no surviving children. Career Mylne learned his trade from his father, assisting him with projects including the sundial at Holyrood Palace. In 1633 Mylne was made a burgess of the royal burgh of Edinburgh, and was admitted to the Edinburgh lodge of masons, both due to his father's position.Colvin, p.569-70 He was first appointed to the town council in 1636 and, in the same year, was appointed master mason to the Crown, succeeding his father.Colvin, p.569-70 The Tron Kirk, Edinburgh, as it appeared in the late 18th century His building projects were concentrated in Edinburgh, where, from 1637, he served as principal master mason to the city. For ten years he was involved in the construction of the Tron Kirk on the High Street, which opened in 1647. The Tron was built to house the congregation of St Giles', which had been raised to cathedral status, and was laid out in the new T-plan form with the pulpit in the centre, to suit reformed worship. The design was informed by contemporary Dutch architecture and, in particular, by the work of Hendrick de Keyser whose Architectura Moderna showcased his church designs in the Netherlands.Howard, p.192 Mylne worked on the building with master wright John Scott who was responsible for the timber work. The building was executed in a Dutch influenced style with both gothic and classical details. The church was not fully complete before Mylne's death and was subsequently remodelled in the 18th century. A new spire was added in the 19th century following a fire, but Mylne's work can be seen in the body of the kirk. The carved tympanum was executed by Mylne's brother Alexander.Gifford, et al., p.174 From 1637 to 1649 he was also engaged on the design of Cowane's Hospital in Stirling, which was executed by Stirling mason James Rynd. Mylne also carved the statue of its founder for the facade.Colvin, p.569-70, Gifford & Walker, p.707-8 In 1642, Mylne surveyed the crumbling remains of Jedburgh Abbey, for which services he was made a burgess of Jedburgh. He built the choir, steeple, and north aisle of Airth Old Church, commencing 15 July 1647.Contract of June 1647 in National Archives NAS GD156/8 From 1643 to 1659, he served as master mason for the construction of Heriot's Hospital (now a school), succeeding William Aytoun. The building had been started in 1628 by William Wallace, and would not be finally completed until 1700; Mylne rebuilt one or two of the towers in 1648.Colvin, p.569-70, Gifford, et al., p.179-82 Also in 1648, Mylne was engaged to repair the crown steeple of St. Giles'.Colvin, p.569-70, Gifford, et al., p.109 Projects in the 1650s included the building of fortifications in Leith, and the addition of artillery emplacements to Edinburgh's town wall.Gifford, et al., p.84 He undertook a division of Greyfriars Kirk, to serve two congregations, and constructed a professor's house for Edinburgh University, which was demolished in the 18th century. Following the Restoration of Charles II, Mylne was reconfirmed in his post of Royal Master Mason, and was commissioned in 1663 to survey the upper floors of Holyrood Palace. The resulting plans are the earliest surviving architectural drawings from Scotland, and are held in the Bodleian Library in Oxford.Howard, p.213 His design for the completion of the palace went unexecuted, with the work eventually being carried out by Sir William Bruce in the 1670s. In 1666 John Mylne designed and was engaged to build Panmure House, near Forfar, for the 2nd Earl of Panmure. After his death, the work was continued by Alexander Nisbet, possibly with the assistance of William Bruce.Glendinning, et al., p.90 This house, demolished in 1950, resembled Heriot's Hospital and other Scottish 17th-century buildings, rather than looking forward to the new classical styles which would be introduced by Bruce. During the Second Anglo- Dutch War of 1665‚Äì1667, Mylne designed and built fortifications at Lerwick, which were later reconstructed as Fort Charlotte. He provided a design for Linlithgow's tolbooth in 1667, but following his death another mason was sought, and a different design built. Another scheme was for Leslie House, carried out after his death by Robert Mylne, again with the advice of Bruce.Glendinning, et al., p.83 Mylne's architectural works are in the Scottish Renaissance tradition, which combined gothic and classical elements, together with mannerist ornament, often derived from imported pattern books.Howard, p.218 Colvin describes Mylne as \\"the leading master of the last phase of Scottish mannerism\\".Colvin, p.570 By the 1660s, Mylne's work was becoming old-fashioned, as the European-inspired Palladian began to be imported by William Bruce.Glendinning et al., p.97 Political and military service In 1640, Mylne joined the Scottish army which invaded northern England during the Second Bishop's War. He was promoted in 1646 to Captain of Pioneers, and Master Gunner of Scotland. As well as serving on Edinburgh's town council from 1636 to 1664, Mylne played several other political roles in his life. In 1652, he served as part of a commission sent to the English Parliament in London, to discuss a possible Treaty of Union. From 1654 to 1659 he represented Edinburgh at the Convention of Royal Burghs, and in 1662 he was elected a burgh commissioner for Edinburgh, attending Charles II's first Scottish parliament. Death The monument to John Mylne, erected in Greyfriar's Kirkyard by Robert Mylne In 1667 Mylne was in discussions with the town of Perth for construction of a new market cross.DNB, Vol.14, p.4 However, he died at Edinburgh in December. He was buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh, where a monument, erected by his nephew and apprentice Robert Mylne, still stands. Another memorial was erected by the Freemasons at their meeting place, St. Mary's Chapel, although this former church was demolished in the 18th century.Colvin, p.569-70, Gifford, et al., p.37. The chapel, formerly a church, stood off the Royal Mile, and was demolished to make way for the South Bridge. His portrait hangs in the Scottish National Portrait Gallery. Robert Mylne succeeded him as master mason to the crown.

He has been long based in Hong Kong. His research interests include ecology, evolution, pathogenesis, epidemiology of animal-human influenza and other human respiratory viral infections, authoring over 320 research publications. Peiris is most notable for being the first person to isolate SARS virus. He holds the Tam Wah-Ching Professorship, Division of Public Health Laboratory Sciences, University of Hong Kong, where he continues to lead ground breaking research with a particular interest in newly emerging viruses such as Coronaviruses at the animal-human interface. He serves as a member on the Advisory panel on Emerging Infectious Diseases, Health Protection Agency of Hong Kong, was on the Research Grants Council of Hong Kong and was previously a member of the World Health Organisation's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE). Together with his co-workers, he has published more than 600 scientific papers in a research career spanning more than 35 years and is credited with 32 scientific patents relating to diagnosis of viral infections. Early Life and Education Peiris was born on 10 November 1949 in Kandy, Sri Lanka. He completed school education at St. Anthony's College, Kandy, and commenced attending the University of Ceylon, Peradeniya to study medicine in October 1967. He graduated with MBBS honours in September 1972.  Academic and Clinical Training  After completing the clinical internships, he joined the Department of Bacteriology in the Medical School of the University of Ceylon's Peradeniya Campus as a junior lecturer. His mentor and head of department was Professor Sarathnanda ‚ÄúChubby‚Äù Arsecularatne, who greatly influenced his career. In 1977, Peiris was awarded a Commonwealth scholarship for post graduate research training at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology in Oxford, with Dr. J.S. Porterfield as his research adviser and mentor. He was awarded the D.Phil degree in 1981. A major aspect of his dissertation was the paradoxical role that antibodies may play in facilitating rather than blocking the entry of viruses such as the West Nile virus and the dengue virus into macrophages, the first line defense cells of the body. Research training in Oxford was followed by two years of training in clinical pathology as a Registrar in Virology with Professor Richard Madeley at the department of Clinical Virology, Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle upon Tyne, culminating in the award of the Membership of the Royal College of Pathologists. In 1982, he returned to his native University in Sri Lanka where, over a period of six years, he established a pioneering Clinical Virology Laboratory. In reflection, he described his achievements during these years in a resource poor setting as some that he is most proud of. After his period in Sri Lanka from 1982 to 1988, Peiris rejoined the Victoria Royal Infirmary in Newcastle in the UK, as a Consultant Virologist. The final and most significant career change was in 1995, when Peiris shifted his Clinical and Scientific efforts to Hong Kong, based around the HKU-Pasteur Research Centre at the University of Hong Kong, after having founded the Clinical Diagnostic and Public Health Laboratory at Queen Mary Hospital, University of Hong Kong \\"Visit of the Grand Chancellor of the L√©gion d'honneur\\", Consulate General of France in Hong Kong and Macau, 2007, webpage: FHK17 : (states \\"Lap Chee Tsui and Pr Malik Peiris, scientific director of HKU-Pasteur Research Centre received the award of Knight\\").. His team of scientists and doctors were strategically placed to face the challenges of the Avian influenza virus outbreak, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) Coronavirus outbreak, the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) Coronavirus outbreak and most recently the COVID-19 pandemic. Original research carried out by the Hong Kong laboratories have made major contributions to the knowledge of the causative viruses of these diseases and the understanding, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of the diseases that these viruses cause. During the period of 2003 to 2004, Peiris was credited with authoring the highest number of high impact publications in the scientific world. Notable findings = Avian Influenza = In 1997, after the first human outbreak of the Avian Influenza Virus H5N1 in Hong Kong, Professor Peiris's attention was turned to the virus, which claimed the lives a third of its victims. Research in his laboratory showed that the virus induces high levels of chemicals called cytokines when it infects a type of white blood cell. This was later shown to correlate with high levels of cytokines in infected humans. This so-called \\"cytokine storm\\" is now recognized as a major mechanism of avian influenza virus pathogenesis. = Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) = In 2003, Hong Kong suffered another virus outbreak, this time from an unknown respiratory disease, termed SARS. Peiris became known worldwide when his laboratory was the first to isolate the virus, a Novel coronavirus (CoV), now known as SARS-CoV. Peiris led the team which isolated the causal agent for the respiratory infection SARS in early 2003. \\"Features\\", Daily News (online), June 2006, webpage: DailyNews-fea01 : contains \\"Following the discovery of the cause of SARS, Professor Peiris was invited...\\". By June 2003, the Peiris laboratory and their collaborators had developed a rapid diagnostic test for SARS-CoV using Real-time polymerase chain reaction. The team has published the standard laboratory manual book on the SARS coronavirus. = COVID-19 = In February 2020, Peiris and his colleague, Leo L. M. Poon, published a definitive article in the Journal Nature Medicine presaging the pandemic of a new coronavirus. In March 2020, Peiris reported that a Pomeranian dog was infected with COVID-19. At first, these findings were dismissed, but other COVID-19 animal infections across the world, substantiated Peiris's findings that animals could be infected by the virus such as the case of a tiger in Bronx Zoo and a pug dog in North Carolina both testing positive.  Honours  He is the first Sri Lankan to be elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of London (conferred in 2006) . This is considered the highest scientific honour in the Commonwealth. He was decorated as Knight of the L√©gion d'Honneur of France on 15 October 2007 He was awarded the Silver Bauhinia Star (SBS) in 2008 from the government of Hong Kong SAR for \\"outstanding achievements in the field of virology and pathology, in particular his contribution to the prevention and control of infectious diseases.\\" Malik continues to work at the University of Hong Kong and was appointed scientific director of the Hong Kong University- Pasteur Institute. In May 2017, Malik was elected as a foreign associate of the US National Academy of Sciences He holds several academic positions by being the Chair Professor of Microbiology and Tam Wah-ching Professor of Medical Sciences at The University of Hong Kong, Honorary Consultant Microbiologist at Queen Mary Hospital and the Scientific Director of the HKU- Pasteur Research Centre at Hong Kong.  Family Background  He is married to Sharmini Arsecularatne and they have a daughter, Shalini and a son, Shehan. Professor Sarathnanda ‚ÄúChubby‚Äù Arsecularatne was the foundation Professor of Bacteriology at the University of Ceylon, Peradeniya, and was Peiris‚Äô early mentor.

Upper Coomera and Coomera have long been the main centre of urban development on the Gold Coast and are considered to be, along with Southport and Robina, one of the Gold Coast's three urban centres. Upper Coomera is a heavily suburbanised suburb consisting of many large residential developments and commercial centres. Despite already being heavily developed and having a large population, Upper Coomera is predicted by both the Queensland Government and Gold Coast City Council to grow and develop at an exponential rate well into the next decade. Upper Coomera is a popular place of residence for dual-city commuters as it is placed roughly halfway between the central commercial districts of Southport and Beenleigh and within reasonable travelling distance to Brisbane CBD. Geography Upper Coomera is located on the northern side of the Gold Coast on the western side of the M1 Pacific Motorway. It borders Willow Vale in the north, the Coomera River on the south which separates it from Oxenford and the Pacific Highway on the east which separates it from Coomera. History The name Coomera comes from the Yugambeh word kumera, a species of wattle.Upper Coomera War Memorial The Coomera River was used by early timber-getters to reach the hinterland. In 1865 the Binstead family settled in Upper Coomera near a ford in the river that later formed part of a mail run. A ferry service was set up downstream which later became known as Coomera. The first bridge across the Coomera river was built in the 1930s. The Upper Coomera Cemetery was first surveyed in 1871 and it opened in 1885, but it was not until 3 years later that someone was buried there. The Upper Coomera Shire War Memorial is on the corner of Oxenford and Tamborine Road and was unveiled on 18 May 1918. The memorial originally only honoured those from the district who fell in World War I; however, the names of those who perished during World War II were added later. The inscriptions on the memorial read: > \\"This memorial was erected by the residents, in honour of the brave lads of > the Coomera district who fell in the Great War 1914-19. They gave their all. > Let you who pass, saluting here their names,See that through you no slur, > nor stain, nor shame Falls on the land for which they gave their lives - > AUSTRALIA.\\" Coomera Upper Provisional School opened on 23 October 1876.

It was formed from the counties of L√∂wenstein (based in the town of L√∂wenstein) and Wertheim (based in the town of Wertheim am Main) and from 1488 until 1806 ruled by the House of L√∂wenstein-Wertheim who are morganatic descendants (and the most senior line) of the Palatinate branch of the House of Wittelsbach. History Louis I, Count of L√∂wenstein (1494‚Äì1524), morganatic son of Frederick I, Elector Palatine The county of L√∂wenstein belonged to a branch of the family of the counts of Calw before 1281, when it was purchased by the German king Rudolph I of Habsburg, who presented it to his natural son Albert. In 1441 Henry, one of Albert's descendants, sold it to the Frederick I, Count Palatine of the Rhine, head of the Palatine branch of the house of Wittelsbach, and later it served as a portion for Louis (1494-1524), a son of the elector by a morganatic marriage, who became a count of the Empire in 1494. Louis obtained L√∂wenstein in Suabia and received from Emperor Maximilian I the title of Count of L√∂wenstein. The family lost L√∂wenstein to Ulrich, Duke of W√ºrttemberg, but Louis III, Count of L√∂wenstein, through his marriage to Anna, heiress of the Count of Wertheim, obtained that territory. Louis III left two sons: Christopher Louis, a Lutheran, and John Dietrich, who remained a Catholic, so the family was divided in two: L√∂wenstein-Wertheim-Freudenberg, a Lutheran branch, and L√∂wenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg, a Catholic one. The heads of the two branches, into which the older and Protestant line was afterwards divided, were made princes by the king of Bavaria in 1812 and by the king of W√ºrttemberg in 1813; the head of the younger, or Roman Catholic line, was made a prince of the Empire in 1711. With the dissolution of the German Empire in 1806, the county was disbanded and its territory was split among Bavaria, Baden, W√ºrttemberg, and Hesse. Under the protocol of Frankfurt on 20 July 1819 all the family lands were mediatised. The area of the county of L√∂wenstein was about .

Early life Lord Hastings was born at Melton Constable Hall in Norfolk, the son of Albert Astley, 21st Baron Hastings and Marguerite Nevill, daughter of the 3rd Marquess of Abergavenny. The ancient Hastings barony had been established in the 1295, but lay dormant from 1389, when there were multiple claimants, and then abeyant from 1542. It was revived for Jacob Astley in 1841, who became the 16th Baron. He was educated at Eton, but his father decided that he was not clever enough to attend Cambridge University. He was sent to learn French and Spanish overseas. He was a friend of Sarah Churchill, daughter of Winston Churchill. Career =Early career and military service= He worked for the Gold Coast Selection Trust in the City of London, and joined the supplementary reserve of the Coldstream Guards in the 1930s. He spent 14 months in the United States, taking a road trip of in a Ford V-8. He returned to England when the Second World War broke out, arriving home shortly before the evacuation from Dunkirk. He transferred to Intelligence Corps, and was posted to North Africa and then Italy, where his language skills became valuable. He ran radio and theatre services in liberated Italy. =Rhodesia= Back in England, he became a director of London and Eastern Trade Bank, before leaving London to run a farm near Salisbury in Southern Rhodesia, growing Virginia tobacco, maize, peanuts and pasture seed. He became active in the local United Party. He met his wife, the former model Katie Hinton (known as Nicki), daughter of Captain H. V. Hinton, in Africa. They married in 1954 and honeymooned on Elba, where he later built a holiday villa for his family, including three children and his two stepchildren. He supported Garfield Todd's United Rhodesia party. 22nd Baron Hastings He spent more time in England after he succeeded to the titles on his father's death in 1956, although Melton Constable Hall had been sold to the Duke of Westminster in 1948. He became a government whip in the Conservative administrations of Harold Macmillan and Sir Alec Douglas-Home from 1961 to 1962, and a Parliamentary Secretary to Sir Keith Joseph, Bt., the Minister of Housing and Local Government, from 1962 to 1964. He took charge of the Bills that became the Clean Air Act 1968 and Water Resources Act 1968. He joined the Opposition front bench after Labour won the 1964 general election, attacking the new Land Commission, which he likened to land nationalisation. He criticised Labour's policies towards Rhodesia, particularly economic sanctions. He continued to run his farm through the years of UDI and civil war, finally selling it to the Government of Zimbabwe in 1982. He moved to Fulmodeston Hall in Norfolk in 1967. He sat in the House of Lords until the House of Lords Act 1999 removed most of the hereditary peers. Patronage He developed a love of ballet after seeing the Ballets Russes at Covent Garden in the 1930s. He was a governor of the Royal Ballet from 1979 to 1992. He became a trustee of the Sadler's Wells Ballet Fund set up by Ninette de Valois, chairman of the Royal Ballet Benevolent Fund from 1966 to 1983, and chairman of the Dance Teachers' Benevolent Fund from 1982 to 1999. His second son Justin was born with Down's syndrome. He became patron of the Camphill Villages Trust, donating Thornage Hall near Fakenham in Norfolk and surrounding land. He was a vice-president of the British Epilepsy Association from 1962 to 1964, president from 1965 to 1993, and then honorary past president until his death in 2007. The Association named its highest award the Lord Hastings Award in his honour. He was also president of the Epilepsy Research Foundation and the Joint Epilepsy Council. He was a governor and vice-chairman of the British Institute of Florence for almost 40 years, from 1959 to 1997. He was president of the British-Italian Society from 1967 to 1995. He launched the Italian People's Flood Appeal to help Italians caught up in floods in the 1960s, to supplement other charities, such as the Venice in Peril Fund, which were established to conserve artworks. For this work, he was appointed a Grand Officer of the Italian Order of Merit in 1968. Seaton Delaval Hall viewed from the north. Seaton Delaval Hall He spent 51 years restoring Seaton Delaval Hall in Northumberland, an outstanding example of English Baroque architecture, designed by Sir John Vanbrugh in 1718 for Admiral George Delaval. It had been badly damaged by fire in 1822, and used as a prisoner of war camp in the Second World War. The central block and west wing were repaired and refurbished, and a parterre laid out. The house opened to the public. It became his permanent home in 1990. Death Hastings died aged 95 and was succeeded by his son, Delaval Astley, 23rd Baron Hastings.

The theory of ' is associated with Bhart·πõhari ( 5th century \\"Bhartrihari was long believed to have lived in the seventh century CE, but according to the testimony of the Chinese pilgrim Yijing [...] he was known to the Buddhist philosopher Dignaga, and this has pushed his date back to the fifth century CE.\\"), an early figure in Indic linguistic theory, mentioned in the 670s by Chinese traveller Yi-Jing. Bhart·πõhari is the author of the VƒÅkyapadƒ´ya (\\"[treatise] on words and sentences\\"). The work is divided into three books, the Brahma-kƒÅ·πá·∏ça, (or ƒÄgama-samuccaya \\"aggregation of traditions\\"), the VƒÅkya-kƒÅ·πá·∏ça, and the Pada-kƒÅ·πá·∏ça (or Prakƒ´r·πáaka \\"miscellaneous\\"). He theorized the act of speech as being made up of three stages: # Conceptualization by the speaker (Pa≈õyantƒ´ \\"idea\\") # Performance of speaking (MadhyamƒÅ \\"medium\\") # Comprehension by the interpreter (Vaikharƒ´ \\"complete utterance\\"). is of the ' \\"speech monistic\\" school which identifies language and cognition. According to George Cardona, \\"VƒÅkyapadƒ´ya is considered to be the major Indian work of its time on grammar, semantics and philosophy.\\" Origin of the term While the ' theory proper (') originates with , the term has a longer history of use in the technical vocabulary of Sanskrit grammarians, and Bhart·πõhari may have been building on the ideas of his predecessors, whose works are partly lost. Sanskrit ' is etymologically derived from the root ' 'to burst'. It is used in its technical linguistic sense by Pata√±jali (2nd century BCE), in reference to the \\"bursting forth\\" of meaning or idea on the mind as language is uttered. Pata√±jali's spho·π≠a is the invariant quality of speech. The acoustic element (dhvani) can be long or short, loud or soft, but the spho·π≠a remains unaffected by individual speaker differences. Thus, a single phoneme (var·πáa) such as /k/, /p/ or /a/ is an abstraction, distinct from variants produced in actual enunciation. Eternal qualities in language are already postulated by YƒÅska, in his Nirukta (1.1), where reference is made to another ancient grammarian, ', about whose work nothing is known, but who has been suggested as the original source of the concept. The grammarian VyƒÅ·∏çi, author of the lost text Sa·πÉgraha, may have developed some ideas in spho·π≠a theory; in particular some distinctions relevant to dhvani are referred to by Bhart·πõhari. Wujastyk notes, however, that there is no early evidence linking someone called VyƒÅ·∏çi with a text called Sa·πÉgraha that is said to be about language philosophy, and that the connection between the two has grown up through early misreadings of the MahƒÅbhƒÅ·π£ya. Furthermore, the Sa·πÉgraha is mainly referred to for having an opinion about the connection between a word and its meaning (≈õabdƒÅrthasa·πÉbandha). There is no use of ' as a technical term prior to Pata√±jali, but PƒÅ·πáini (6.1.123) refers to a grammarian named ' as one of his predecessors. This has induced PƒÅ·πáini's medieval commentators (such as Haradatta) to ascribe the first development of the ' to '.  The account of the Chinese traveller Yi-Jing places a firm terminus ante quem of AD 670 on Bhartrhari. Scholarly opinion had formerly tended to place him in the 6th or 7th century; current consensus places him in the 5th century. By some traditional accounts, he is the same as the poet Bhart·πõhari who wrote the ≈öatakatraya. In the , the term spho·π≠a takes on a finer nuance, but there is some dissension among scholars as to what Bhart·πõhari intended to say. Spho·π≠a retains its invariant attribute, but sometimes its indivisibility is emphasized and at other times it is said to operate at several levels. In verse I.93, Bhart·πõhari states that the sphota is the universal or linguistic type  sentence-type or word-type, as opposed to their tokens (sounds). Bhart·πõhari develops this doctrine in a metaphysical setting, where he views spho·π≠a as the language capability of man, revealing his consciousness. Indeed, the ultimate reality is also expressible in language, the ≈õabda-brahman, or \\"Eternal Verbum\\". Early Indologists such as A. B. Keith felt that Bhart·πõhari's spho·π≠a was a mystical notion, owing to the metaphysical underpinning of Bhart·πõhari's text, VƒÅkyapƒÅdiya where it is discussed. Also, the notion of \\"flash or insight\\" or \\"revelation\\" central to the concept also lent itself to this viewpoint. However, the modern view is that it is perhaps a more psychological distinction. Bhart·πõhari expands on the notion of spho·π≠a in Pata√±jali, and discusses three levels: # var·πáa-spho·π≠a, at the syllable level. George Cardona feels that this remains an abstraction of sound, a further refinement on Pata√±jali for the concept of phoneme- now it stands for units of sound. # pada-spho·π≠a, at the word level, and # vakya-spho·π≠a, at the sentence level. He makes a distinction between spho·π≠a, which is whole and indivisible, and nƒÅda, the sound, which is sequenced and therefore divisible. The spho·π≠a is the causal root, the intention, behind an utterance, in which sense is similar to the notion of lemma in most psycholinguistic theories of speech production. However, spho·π≠a arises also in the listener, which is different from the lemma position. Uttering the nƒÅda induces the same mental state or spho·π≠a in the listener - it comes as a whole, in a flash of recognition or intuition (pratibhƒÅ, 'shining forth'). This is particularly true for vakya-spho·π≠a, where the entire sentence is thought of (by the speaker), and grasped (by the listener) as a whole. Bimal K. Matilal (1990) has tried to unify these views - he feels that for Bhart·πõhari the very process of thinking involves vibrations, so that thought has some sound-like properties. Thought operates by ≈õabdanaor 'speaking', - so that the mechanisms of thought are the same as that of language. Indeed, Bhart·πõhari seems to be saying that thought is not possible without language. This leads to a somewhat whorfian position on the relationship between language and thought. The spho·π≠a then is the carrier of this thought, as a primordial vibration. Sometimes the nƒÅda-spho·π≠a distinction is posited in terms of the signifier-signified mapping, but this is a misconception. In traditional Sanskrit linguistic discourse (e.g. in KatyƒÅyana), vƒÅcaka refers to the signifier, and 'vƒÅcya' the signified. The 'vƒÅcaka-vƒÅcya' relation is eternal for KatyƒÅyana and the Mƒ´mƒÅ·πÉsakas, but is conventional among the NyƒÅya. However, in Bhart·πõhari, this duality is given up in favour of a more holistic view - for him, there is no independent meaning or signified; the meaning is inherent in the word or the spho·π≠a itself. Reception =VyƒÅkara·πáa= Spho·π≠a theory remained widely influential in Indian philosophy of language and was the focus of much debate over several centuries. It was adopted by most scholars of VyƒÅkara·πáa (grammar), but both the Mƒ´mƒÅ·πÉsƒÅ and NyƒÅya schools rejected it, primarily on the grounds of compositionality. Adherents of the 'sphota' doctrine were holistic or non- compositional (a-khan·∏ça-pak·π£a), suggesting that many larger units of language are understood as a whole, whereas the Mƒ´mƒÅ·πÉsakas in particular proposed compositionality (khan·∏ça-pak·π£a). According to the former, word meanings, if any, are arrived at after analyzing the sentences in which they occur. This debate had many of the features animating present day debates in language over semantic holism, for example. The Mƒ´mƒÅ·πÉsakas felt that the sound-units or the letters alone make up the word. The sound-units are uttered in sequence, but each leaves behind an impression, and the meaning is grasped only when the last unit is uttered. The position was most ably stated by Kumarila Bhatta (7th century) who argued that the 'spho·π≠as' at the word and sentence level are after all composed of the smaller units, and cannot be different from their combination.Gaurinath Sastri A Study in the Dialectics of Sphota, Motilal Banarsidass (1981). However, in the end it is cognized as a whole, and this leads to the misperception of the spho·π≠a as a single indivisible unit. Each sound unit in the utterance is an eternal, and the actual sounds differ owing to differences in manifestation. The NyƒÅya view is enunciated among others by Jayanta (9th century), who argues against the Mƒ´mƒÅ·πÉsƒÅ position by saying that the sound units as uttered are different; e.g. for the sound [g], we infer its 'g-hood' based on its similarity to other such sounds, and not because of any underlying eternal. Also, the vƒÅcaka-vƒÅcya linkage is viewed as arbitrary and conventional, and not eternal. However, he agrees with Kumarila in terms of the compositionality of an utterance. Throughout the second millennium, a number of treatises discussed the spho·π≠a doctrine. Particularly notable is Nage≈õabha·π≠·π≠a's SphotavƒÅda (18th century). Nage≈õa clearly defines spho·π≠a as a carrier of meaning, and identifies eight levels, some of which are divisible. =Modern linguistics= In modern times, scholars of Bhart·πõhari have included Ferdinand de Saussure, who did his doctoral work on the genitive in Sanskrit, and lectured on Sanskrit and Indo-European languages at the Paris and at the University of Geneva for nearly three decades. It is thought that he might have been influenced by some ideas of Bhart·πõhari, particularly the spho·π≠a debate. In particular, his description of the sign, as composed of the signifier and the signified, where these entities are not separable - the whole mapping from sound to denotation constitutes the sign, seems to have some colourings of spho·π≠a in it. Many other prominent European scholars around 1900, including linguists such as Leonard Bloomfield and Roman Jakobson may have been influenced by Bhart·πõhari.Frits Staal, \\"The science of language\\" chapter 16 in Gavin D.

Output  In programming, instrumentation means the ability of an application to incorporate: * Profiling - a means by which dynamic program behaviors can be measured during a training run with a representative input. This is useful for properties of a program that cannot be analyzed statically with sufficient precision, such as alias analysis. * Performance counters - components that allow the tracking of the performance of the application. * Computer data logging - components that allow the logging and tracking of major events in the execution of the application.  Limitations  Instrumentation is limited by execution coverage. If the program never reaches a particular point of execution, then instrumentation at that point collects no data. For instance, if a word processor application is instrumented, but the user never activates the print feature, then the instrumentation can say nothing about the routines which are used exclusively by the printing feature. Some types of instrumentation may cause a dramatic increase in execution time. This may limit the application of instrumentation to debugging contexts. See also * Hooking - range of techniques used to alter or augment the behavior of an operating system, of applications, or of other software components either by intercepting function calls or messages or events passed between software components * Instruction set simulator - simulation of all instructions at machine code level to provide instrumentation * Runtime intelligence - technologies, managed services and practices for the collection, integration, analysis, and presentation of application usage levels, patterns, and practices * Software performance analysis - techniques to monitor code performance, including instrumentation * Hardware performance counter * DTrace ‚Äî A comprehensive dynamic tracing framework for troubleshooting kernel and application problems on production systems in real time, implemented in Solaris, macOS, FreeBSD, and many other platforms and products. * Java Management Extensions (JMX) ‚Äì Java technology for managing and monitoring applications, system objects, devices (such as printers), and service-oriented networks * Application Response Measurement - standardized instrumentation API for C and Java * Dynamic recompilation - a feature of some emulators and virtual machines where the system may recompile some part of a program during execution References * Introduction to Instrumentation and Tracing: Microsoft Developer Network * Apple Developer Tools: Introduction to Instruments * SystemTap provides free software (GPL) infrastructure to simplify the gathering of information about the running Linux system. * cwrap Auto wrap C and C++ functions with instrumentation.

Geography Rockford is situated along the Yadkin River in the Rockford Township of southern Surry County. Rockford sits along the former Southern Railway, now used by the Yadkin Valley Railroad, which follows the Yadkin River through Surry County. History Rockford was founded in 1790 to be the county seat of Surry after Surry was split to form Stokes County (including then modern-day Forsyth County as well as Stokes). The community was incorporated in 1819 but has been municipally inactive for many years . When the portion of Surry County south of the Yadkin River was used to create Yadkin County in 1851, the county government was moved to Dobson. Several notable historical structures from the village's period as county seat are still standing, including the former county courthouse. Ferries shuttled people across the Yadkin River at Rockford until 1900, when piano-seller R.F. Bland charged a quarter to cross a bridge he built that connected the river's banks with an island. Floods swept the bridge away in the 1930s.\\"Against the Flow,\\" Winston-Salem Journal, May 2, 1998 In 1962, a one-lane, low-water bridge was built to link the community with the nearest town, Boonville. A community group fought unsuccessfully to save the bridge. A modern high-rise bridge was built in 2002. The Rockford Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Attractions * Rockford General Store is a popular gathering spot for locals and tourists. The store, with its uneven wooden floors, glass jars of candy and old photos of Rockford, retains much of its original charm. The store first opened about 1890.The General Store is still in operation and its owners are dedicated to preserving the historic value of the store. Rockford General Store official site * The J.F. Bland House, a good example of vernacular Victorian, was constructed around 1900. Mr. Bland was an accomplished musician and credited with bringing the first keyboard instruments to the Rockford Community. He also is credited with building the first bridge to Rockford over the Yadkin River. * Rockford Methodist Church was built in 1913. Although it was closed by the Methodist Conference in 1967, it is still used for special events. The building includes a fresco by North Carolina artist Tony Griffin called \\"Come Unto Me.\\" The work was dedicated in 1989 as part of the village's 200th anniversary celebration.\\"Fresco Dedication Set,\\" Winston-Salem Journal, October 22, 1989 * Historic Rockford Inn Bed and Breakfast (ca. 1848) is situated at the crest of more than *Rockford Post Office, c. 1900 *Dudley Glass Store is currently rented by Sweet Paws Home Goods & Perlie Chic Boutique and is called Davenport Gallery and Museum. *Rockford Park is the site of the Grant-Burrus Hotel, which burned down in 1974. * The Masonic Lodge, c. 1797 Rockford's Masonic hall was built around 1797 for the Unanimity Lodge Number 34 of the Masonic Order. After a new charter was granted in 1866, the lodge was renamed Rockford Lodge Number 251. The wood-and-stone lodge has been evaluated by the N.C. Department of Cultural Resources and officials from the Grand Lodge of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons of North Carolina. It is believed to be the oldest Masonic hall in northwestern North Carolina. Many of the most prominent members of the Rockford community attended meetings in this building. In 1848, the Baptist State Convention also was held there. In the late 19th century, the W.P. Dobson & Company mercantile business operated on the first floor. The business was owned by Charles B. Davis, W.P. Dobson III and G.M. Burrus. In 1914, a addition was built onto the Masonic hall. That portion of the building served as Rockford's last U.S. Post Office between 1914 and 1975 and still has original counter window bars and mail slots. The Masonic building, along with two adjacent properties, were purchased by Evelyn Holyfield and her brother, Robert Hardin Holyfield, in 1970. Since 2002, the properties have been under the ownership of the Rockford Preservation Society, Inc. Restoration In 1972, the Rockford Preservation Society, Inc. was established to begin restoration and preservation measures on the town of Rockford. Many of the buildings were in unstable conditions upon initially receiving the title to them; however, through funding from State and Federal Grants, the buildings have slowly been restored. The Methodist Church, Dudley Glass store, and Post Office building have all been successfully restored and opened up to the public. The Rockford Preservation Society, Inc. are now working on renovating The Mark York Tavern and Masonic Lodge and eventually, opening them up to the public as well. The Rockford Preservation Society, Inc. was unable to restore the Grant-Burrus Hotel building because it was burned down; however, the site of the fire has now been turned into Rockford Park, which still contains some remains of the hotel. Events * The Rockford Sweet Potato Festival has been held annually in September since 1996. The festival is a brainchild of the late Annie Barnette, the owner of the Rockford General Store from 1972 until her death in 2004. The festival includes music, crafts and sweet potato .\\"Sweet Idea: Town borrows theme, opens festival; folks come from all over,\\" Winston-Salem Journal, September 16, 2000 * Rockford Candlelight Christmas serves as a kick off for the holiday season.

As Lypsinka he lip-synchs to meticulously edited, show- length soundtracks culled from snippets of outrageous 20th-century female performances in movies and song. Early life Epperson was born in Hazlehurst, Mississippi. He took lessons in classical piano from an early age. After high school he enrolled at Belhaven College in Jackson, Mississippi. After graduating from Belhaven he got a job playing piano in Colorado, but in 1978 he moved to New York and became a full-time rehearsal pianist for the American Ballet Theatre in 1980. He began doing drag performances at nightspots such as Club 57 and the Pyramid Club. Epperson quit his job with the American Ballet Theater in 1991 in order to perform full-time as Lypsinka. He returned to his position at American Ballet Theater on a part-time basis.Rapp, Linda: Profile , An Encyclopedia of Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Culture online (ed. Claude J. Summers), 2005; accessed November 26, 2006. Work Lypsinka first appeared in 1982, and for the first time Off Broadway in September 1988 when Epperson's act was a late-night addition to the bill of Charles Busch's Vampire Lesbians of Sodom at the Provincetown Playhouse in New York. She has appeared in evening-length solo shows Off-Broadway, including Lypsinka! The Boxed Set and Lypsinka! As I Lay Lip-Synching, both of which were originally produced in New York by TWEED TheaterWorks. However, both those named shows were first produced by Epperson in San Francisco, and Lypsinka! The Boxed Set was titled Lypsinka's Greatest Hits in San Francisco. According to Epperson, the prototype for Lypsinka was singer Dolores Gray.Pela, Robrt L. \\"'Kind of a drag': Lypsinka is much more than a drag queen\\" , Phoenix News Times, April 8, 2004. Epperson is a frequent performer at Wigstock. (That previous sentence perhaps should read was a frequent performer at Wigstock, when it was a land event. Wigstock now takes place on a boat and Epperson has not performed on the boat.) At Studio Theatre in Washington, D.C. Epperson performed an autobiographical theatrical solo show, Show Trash (2004), out of drag, talking, playing the piano and singing in his own voice. In Winter 2004, in a different drag role, Epperson played the Wicked Stepmother in the New York City Opera's revival of Rodgers- Hammerstein's Cinderella in a cast with Eartha Kitt, Dick Van Patten and Ren√©e Taylor. In 1985 at The Pyramid Club Epperson wrote the book, music and lyrics for a musical Ballet of the Dolls, a parody of the novel and film Valley of the Dolls and the ballet world. He also appeared briefly in that production as a reporter named Jonathan Susann. In 1988 Ballet of the Dolls had a second revised production at La Mama Experiment Theatre Club. Also at The Pyramid Club in 1986 Epperson had another musical, Dial \\"M\\" For Model, for which he also wrote the book, music and lyrics. He had a larger role as a female model Mannequin St. Claire. The show was determinedly silly and presented in comic book style in its depiction of cartoonish goings-on in the fashion world of the 1960s. In 1987 \\"Dial 'M' For Model\\" moved from The Pyramid Club to La Mama Experimental Theatre Club. Epperson played Mrs. Wilson in the movie Another Gay Movie. Epperson provided a commentary track for the 2006 Special Edition DVD release of What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?, along with Charles Busch. The second disc of the set also contains a short feature about Bette Davis and Joan Crawford, titled Blind Ambition, with contributions from Busch and Epperson. Epperson wrote a play, My Deah, his version of the Medea tale transplanted to Mississippi which debuted at the June Havoc Theater in New York in 2006. In 1999, Epperson appeared in a non-drag role in the critically acclaimed verbatim play Messages for Gary written by Patrick Horrigan and produced by Paul Lucas. Epperson appears in a speaking role in the 2010 film Black Swan as a rehearsal pianist for a fictional New York City ballet company. More recently in New York in 2014 he appeared in the Off Broadway event Lypsinka! The Trilogy, a production that included three of his shows: revivals of Lypsinka! The Boxed Set and The Passion of the Crawford and John Epperson: Show Trash. The latter production is autobiographical and in it Epperson tells of growing up in Mississippi, moving to New York, working at the ballet, creating Lypsinka, etc. In 2015 he played Queen Aggravain in the Off Broadway revival of the musical Once Upon a Mattress. In 2016 he appeared at Feinstein's/54 Below and Joe's Pub in his cabaret show John Epperson: The Artist Principally Known As Lypsinka. In early 2017 he acted a male role in a play by Wallace Shawn Evening at the Talk House. The Shawn play was produced Off Broadway by The New Group, and included in the cast were Shawn, Matthew Broderick, Larry Pine and Jill Eikenberry. In 2001 he has posed for a PETA's ad campaign promoting vegetarianism. Awards For his show Lypsinka! The Boxed Set Epperson won the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award for Best Sound Design, the LA Weekly Theater Award for Best Solo Performance, and the Helen Hayes Award for Best Non-resident Production in 2003. Quotes * \\"I don't like the term 'drag queen,' because it describes an amateur. Why not call me an actor? I suppose drag artist would be okay.\\" * Epperson has commented that, 'It's so easy to do misogynistic drag humor' but that he has 'deliberately tried to avoid that'. He adds that, 'A lot of women, when they see the show, felt liberated and empowered.' (...) He intends his own work as 'a commentary of performance in general and drag performance specifically.' However outrageous Lypsinka may be, she is always at heart affectionate toward the women to whose work she performs.\\" See also * LGBT culture in New York City * List of self-identified LGBTQ New Yorkers References External links * Lypsinka official webpage  John Epperson at Internet Off-Broadway Database * Profile, MetroWeekly.com Category:1955 births Category:American male stage actors Category:American entertainers Category:American drag queens Category:Gay actors Category:LGBT entertainers from the United States Category:LGBT people from Mississippi Category:Living people ","title":"John Epperson"},{"id":"11171586","text":"\\"I Found Out\\" is a song by the English musician John Lennon from his 1970 album John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band. Writing and recording The song expresses Lennon's disillusionment with a world dominated by what he saw as false religion and idols, and warns against being taken in by such beliefs. Recorded at EMI Studios on 27 September 1970, the instrumentation, style, and production of the song are typical of Lennon's Plastic Ono Band era work. The song features a low, rumbling tremolo guitar, thumping drums, a rolling, minimal bass guitar line, and a scathing vocal delivery. The recording is bare-bones, in stark contrast to the heavy production of Lennon's later albums. It is influenced more heavily by blues music than other songs on Plastic Ono Band. Reception In a review for Plastic Ono Band, website Classic Rock Review described \\"I Found Out\\" as a \\"dark but fine tune\\", along with describing the bass line as the true highlight of the track. Upon its release, much of the controversy over \\"I Found Out\\", which contained the line \\"Some of you sitting there with your cock in your hand\\", which was similarly censored at the record company's request. Also the line \\"I seen religion from Jesus to Paul\\" which is comparable to the Paul is Dead rumour. The lyrics are some of Lennon's most vitriolic, taking shots at religion, his parents and drugs.

On June 21, 1940 (one day before the French surrender) the ‚ÄúPusteria‚Äù division began to advance in southern France with other Italian units during the last days of the Battle of France. The division was then sent to Albania, where it participated in the Italian attack on Greece. After the invasion of Yugoslavia the ‚ÄúPusteria‚Äù was sent to Montenegro where the division was decimated greatly in heavy fighting against Yugoslavian Partisans. On 1 December 1941 this division was victorious against Partisans in the Battle of Pljevlja. In August 1942, the division was repatriated and after two months of rest participated in Case Anton, the Axis occupation of Vichy France. Afterwards the Pusteria took up garrison duties in the southern region of Provence. After the signing of the Italian armistice with the Allies on September 8, 1943, part of the division surrendered to German forces in Southern France while other units managed to return to the Italian region of Piedmont where they disbanded.

He has previously played for several Brazilian clubs as well as in Japan. Playing career Born in Rio de Janeiro, Rodrigo was a product of S√£o Crist√≥v√£o youth (along with others such as Brazilian superstar forward Ronaldo). He earned a transfer to Vasco da Gama at only 17 years of age. Souto built his career in Vasco, initially playing as a defensive midfielder. However, the team back then put many players in that position on the lineup, and so Rodrigo was able to show his attacking skills. He then began to be deployed as a right attacking midfielder. In such position, he made a move to Atl√©tico Paranaense. Although he conquered Paran√° State League in 2005, he did not establish himself as a regular and, after six months, switched clubs again, this time to Figueirense. There he again won the State league and again was deployed as a defensive midfielder, and even as a right back or sweeper in emergencies. =Santos= Souto's performance at Figueirense in 2006 earned him a transfer to Santos where he made a solid pairing with Chilean international, Claudio Maldonado. He was once again State League champion in 2007, with a really high grade on the final game. He had a great year with Santos in 2007, also finishing 2nd in the S√©rie A. In 2008, Santos did not perform well in all competitions but Souto continued as a first-choice player in the midfield.

Lugar is in Auchinleck Parish, Kyle District, Ayrshire. It is ENE of Cumnock, and about from Cronberry and from Gasswater. Lugar is a station on the Mauchline and Muirkirk branch of the Glasgow and South Western Railway. Lugar is about SE of Kilmarnock. Lugar was once dominated by a large ironworks with several blast furnaces. Like the mining industry in nearby areas, though, the iron industry has been decimated by economic decline. The Lugar ironworks closed long ago. Lugar was built to accommodate the workers at the ironworks around 1845. They were housed in \\"miners' raws\\" (sic). On the 1860 Ordnance Survey Map the rows included Peesweip Row, Craigstonholm Row, Store Row, Back Row and Hollowholm Row.(This map also shows a Curling Pond). Other maps included Laigh Row, Double Row and High Row. The population grew to 753 in 1861, and 1374 in 1871. By 1881 it had 1353 people and 1891 people, according to the Ordnance Survey. The Lugar Institute was created in 1892 by a Mr. Weir of Kildonan. The Institute consisted of a lecture hall with a capacity of 400, a reading room, recreation room (for chess etc.), billiard room and bowling alley. It was partially demolished, and some of the remaining parts have been recently restored. A local church, established in 1867, is another prominent feature of Lugar. The Lugar Boswell Thistle Football Club is a Scottish football (soccer) club based there. The club is nicknamed The Jaggy Bunnets. They were formed in 1878 as a senior team, turning to the juniors after a short spell. The 65th Ayrshire scout troop in the Kylesmuir District is based in Lugar. Near Lugar, at Bello Mill Cottage on the estate of James Boswell in Auchinleck, William Murdoch was born in 1784. Murdoch did some important experiments on steam engines and was the inventor of gas lighting. Murdoch's Cave where he carried out a lot of his experiments on coal gas can still be seen on the riverbank of the Lugar Water. Close to the village, and cropping out for a length of about 5 kilometres in a NE-SW direction, is the Lugar Sill, an internationally studied geological feature and a Site of Special Scientific Interest. It has been intruded in several phases (on or close to the Carboniferous-Permian boundary) in molten form into the local sandstone and then crystallised. The thickness of the igneous rock is estimated at 42-49 m. It extends in a general north-easterly direction from Lugar, 2.5 Km beyond the village of Cronberry. Its composition overall is outer Teschenite units and a thick core of layered Theralite and Picrite including Lugarite, (a coarse-grained rock consisting of euhedral crystals of titanaugite and Kaersutite up to 7cm long with corroded feldspars and ilmenite set in a cloudy greyish base of analcime, nepheline and alteration products}. The sill represents a nearby magma source differentiating in situ to give sequentially injected layers of slightly different petrochemical composition.

Located in the neighborhood of Autokomanda, on the site of an old military base, the camp held between 5,000 and 6,500 inmates from its establishment in August 1941 until its closure that December. About 4,300 inmates were killed during its operation, of whom 3,000 were killed as hostages and 1,300 as suspected anti- fascists. Background Jews were rounded up by the Germans after the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia. On 6 April 1941, Axis forces invaded the Kingdom of Yugoslavia. Poorly equipped and poorly trained, the Royal Yugoslav Army was quickly defeated. The country was then occupied and dismembered, with the Wehrmacht establishing the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia under a government of military occupation. The territory included most of Serbia proper, with the addition of the northern part of Kosovo (centred on Kosovska Mitrovica), and the Banat. It was the only area of partitioned Yugoslavia in which the German occupants established a military government, to exploit the key rail and riverine transport routes that passed through it, and its valuable resources, particularly non-ferrous metals. The Military Commander in Serbia appointed Serbian puppet governments to \\"carry on administrative chores under German direction and supervision\\". On 29 August 1941, the Germans appointed the Government of National Salvation under General Milan Nediƒá, to replace the short-lived Commissioner Administration. A pre-war politician who was known to have pro-Axis leanings, Nediƒá was selected because the Germans believed his fierce anti-Communism and military experience could be used to quell an armed uprising in the Serbian region of ≈†umadija. Unable to bring reinforcements due to the need to send soldiers to the Eastern Front, the Germans responded to the revolt by declaring that one-hundred Serbs would be executed for every German soldier killed and that fifty would be executed for every German soldier wounded. By October 1941, this policy had resulted in the deaths of 25,000 Serbs. The Germans also targeted Jews, who were subjected to forced labour, punitive taxing, and restrictive decrees. Jews were also registered with German authorities and forced to wear identifying armbands while Jewish property was confiscated. They, and to a lesser degree Romanis, were targeted on racial grounds, although most were not killed outright. Following the start of the anti-German uprising, German propaganda began associating Jews with Communism and anti-German ideology. Executions and arrests of Serbian Jews followed. Operation The camp at Topovske ≈†upe (lit. cannon sheds) was established on 20 August 1941 on the site of a former Royal Yugoslav Army military base. The former military base was called Logor kraljeviƒáa Andreja, the \\"Prince Andrej Camp\\", after Prince Andrew of Yugoslavia, brother of the king. Located on the outskirts of Belgrade, it was the first extermination camp for Jewish men established by German forces in Serbia and was partly run by the Gestapo. Originally, Jews from the Banat were detained in the camp due to Nazi allegations that Jewish groups were behind the anti-German revolt. They were expelled by the Volksdeutsche from Banat to Belgrade where they originally settled into the Jewish centers, private houses and synagogues. Later, an order was issued that they all should be interned into the Topovske ≈†upe. At first, the inmates were sent to the forced labor. As the rebellion spread over Serbia in 1941, the Nazis organized penal expeditions and mass internment began, so the camp became a \\"hostage reservoir\\". Afterwards, the camp only detained Jewish males of fourteen years and older. Prisoners were held in poor conditions and were guarded by the gendarmes of the Nediƒá government, whose cruelty towards inmates often exceeded that of the Germans. Prisoners who attempted to escape the camp were publicly hanged by the gendarmes as a warning to other inmates. The camp became a hostage centre from where the Germans could select victims for reprisal shootings. Daily, the Germans shot between 150 and 450 predominantly Jewish inmates. Though officially called \\"Jewish Transitional Camp\\", the complex was used for gathering other nationalities, too. Romany population was mostly brought from the neighborhood of Marinkova Bara to the east, but also from other parts of Belgrade. One part of Topovske ≈†upe was declared a Refugee Camp where Serbs, refugees from the Independent State of Croatia, were situated. Executions usually occurred at the Jajinci firing range, in the village of Jabuka or in the Deliblato Sands. They were carried out after inmates were deceived into thinking they were being taken to a camp in Austria where they would experience better treatment and would be fed better food. In the autumn of 1941, trucks transported Jews from Topovske ≈†upe to the locality ƒåardak near Deliblato. The prisoners were told they were to participate in some public works, but instead they dug trenches for their own burial. They were lined in three lines, women and children in the first, and men in the next two. The rows were shot one by one, while those in the next row were then burying them. The last row was thrown in the trench by the German soldiers. Further executions were conducted later that day, including Jews from other places. In total, some 500 people were killed and thrown into seven pits. In June 1944, the Sonderkommando unit No. 150 dug out the bodies and burned them in the crematory. A memorial was later erected at the locality. By December 1941, most Serbian Jews over fourteen were detained at Topovske ≈†upe. That month, the camp was closed. Surviving inmates were used as the forced laborers during the adaptation of the Sajmi≈°te into the camp, to which they were transferred later. It took only several months to annihilate the entire male Jewish population of Belgrade, so mostly women and children were interned in Sajmi≈°te. An estimated 5,000‚Äì6,000 people were detained at Topovske ≈†upe throughout its operation, of whom 3,000 were killed as hostages and 1,300 were killed as suspected anti-fascists. The historian Milan Koljanin has estimated that the camp held 6,000‚Äì6,500 inmates (5,000 Jews and 1,000‚Äì1,500 Romanis). Milovan Pisari, from the Center for Research and Education about Holocaust, writes that there is no evidence that executions were conducted in the camp, but mentions the case of two Jews who were publicly hanged between the barracks after an unsuccessful escape attempt. Aftermath After the war, the site of the camp was neglected by Belgrade authorities. Pisari believes that the reason for neglect, despite very meticulous official politics in former Yugoslavia regarding the memory of victims, is that victims in this camp were neither Communist fighters nor anti-fascists, while later the focus shifted to the Serbian victims. Koljanin says that, as a society, \\"we didn't appear in a good light\\" when it comes to the Sajmi≈°te camp either, and that Topovske ≈†upe should be part of a memorial web, centered in the future commemorative complex in Sajmi≈°te. The remains of the objects are desolate and within the complex near the Tabanovaƒçka Street, only one wall and two one- floor barracks survive today. The memorial plaque, which commemorates the events in Topovske ≈†upe was dedicated only in 2005, when Miroslav Mi≈°koviƒá, a tycoon and one of the richest Serbs and owner of Delta Holding, purchased the lot and announced plans to build a massive Delta Planet Shopping Center and two 40-floor business towers. The plaque was stolen in the summer of 2017, then recovered by the police and handed over to the Jewish Municipality of Belgrade, but as of November 2017 it was still not returned to the location. Only the small central part is arranged, in the form of a rose garden, while the complex extends into an informal settlement. The memorial plaque was dedicated again on 2 May 2019, as part of the Yom HaShoah. The plaque in Serbia, Hebrew and English was unveiled by Estera Bajer Albahari, who was born in the Sajmi≈°te concentration camp in 1942. The announcement by Delta Holding was met by opposition from Jewish groups who argued that it was not \\"[morally] right to build a shopping centre on a site from where people have been taken to death.\\" One of the main contractors behind the project is an architectural group from Israel. As of 2017, Delta Holding still didn't began any works on the mega project, but claim that they will build the planned shopping mall but also that they will keep the memory of the camp. The company also stated that for 10 years they contemplate what to do and how to adapt the ruins into the proper memorial, in collaboration with the architect of the project, Ami Mur from Israel. Before any works done on the complex, the investors would have to obtain permits from the Institute for the culture monuments protection as Topovske ≈†upe are placed under the \\"preliminary protection\\". Serbian Ministry of Labour, Employment, Veteran and Social Policy stated that the investor has to preserve the complex and that nothing can be built in the zone of around the present ruins. The 2018 internal strife in Jewish organizations in Serbia, including both on the local and on the state level, caused the exclusion from the European Jewish Congress, but also affected the future of the Topovske ≈†upe complex. Two groups accused each other, annulling each other's decisions. One group claimed that the others wanted to completely demolish the complex, leaving only one part of the wall within the new shopping mall, and that better solution is relocation of the objects. The other group denied this, claiming that the first group actually wants to demolish everything. Proposed solutions, from 2016 to 2019, included: partial demolition of the complex; relocation and formation of the memorial center on some other location, away from the old one; partial demolition with revitalization of the remaining part; construction of the new memorial in the form of the wall with a fountain parallel to the shopping mall; incorporation of this wall into the shopping mall (proposed by Mur, but rejected by the Jewish organizations). Delta Holding said it will accept any solution accepted by the Jewish organizations, while similar was said by the Institute for the protection of monuments, which in May 2018 extended the preliminary protection of the complex for another 3 years, asking for the full legal protection of the complex as the cultural monument. One of two remaining buildings, however, is on the lot purchased by the Delta (the other one is on the lot owned by the city) and, technically, could be demolished by the investor after August 2019. Romany organizations, whose consent is also needed, gave consent for the demolition of both buildings. On 24 February 2020, Serbian assembly adopted the Law on Memorial Center Staro Sajmi≈°te as an institute for keeping the memory of the victims of Nazi concentration camps Sajmi≈°te and Topovske ≈†upe. For the first time, one law in Serbia recognized the genocide in the Independent State of Croatia, the Holocaust and the Samudaripen, as World War II genocides of the Serbs, Jews and Romani people, respectively. The law will become effective on 1 January 2021.

It was finally captured by military assault on May 11, 1948 by the Givati Brigade during Operation Barak, just prior to the outbreak of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War.Morris, 2004, pp. 256-257 The village suffered some 50 casualties, and many houses were then blown up, and wells and granaries sabotaged.Morris, 2004, p. 256 Bayt Daras had a population of 3,190 living in 709 houses in 1948. In Baroud's account, a massacre took place as people fled the village. Israeli army camp at Bayt Daras, 1948 According to the memoirs of Gamal Abdel Nasser, the empty village was reoccupied by Sudanese forces in June, but they left after a signaling error caused them to be shelled by their own side. Structures in the village were made of stone foundations with vaulted rooms. There were also two elementary schools and two mosques, all of which were demolished after its capture. Following the war the area was incorporated into the State of Israel. In 1950 the moshav of Giv'ati was built on the site of the village, with two other moshavim, Azrikam, Emunim, established on land that had belonged to Bayt Daras. Later in the 1950s a farm called Zemorot was built on Khirbat Awda, which had also belonged to Bayt Daras.Khalidi, 1992, p. 88 In 1992 the village site was described: \\"The only remain of village buildings are the foundations of one house and some scattered rubble. The site is overgrown with wild vegetation interspersed by cactuses and eucalyptus trees. At least one of the streets is clearly recognisable. The surrounding fields are cultivated by the settlements.\\" Culture A woman's thob (loose fitting robe with sleeves) dated to about 1930 from the village of Beit Daras is part of the Museum of International Folk Art (MOIFA) collection at Santa Fe.

It was released as a single from the soundtrack to the 1997 motion picture Spawn. An arena rock and gothic rock song, \\"Long Hard Road Out of Hell\\" was written by Marilyn Manson and Twiggy Ramirez and produced by Manson and Sean Beavan. Its lyrics are about self- loathing and its title is derived from John Milton's Paradise Lost (1667). After the track was written, the Sneaker Pimps' Kelli Ali was recruited to perform background vocals on it, as the Spawn soundtrack featured collaborations between hard rock artists and electronic music artists. The Sneaker Pimps were dissatisfied with the final track and wanted a remix of it to be released as a single instead; conversely, Manson deemed it a personal favorite. \\"Long Hard Road Out of Hell\\" received mixed reviews from music critics; some found it heartfelt while others felt it was too indistinct from other Marilyn Manson songs. Commentators noted that the track encapsulated the evolution of the band's sound from the industrial music of Antichrist Superstar (1996) to the glam rock of Mechanical Animals (1998). Manson initially approached Jonathan Glazer to direct the video for the track, but rejected his concept for it; Glazer later used his concept for the video for Radiohead's \\"Karma Police\\" (1997). The music video for \\"Long Hard Road Out of Hell\\" was directed by Matthew Rolston. It depicts Manson in a dress and a group of models who initially appear to be female but are revealed to be male. The clip garnered acclaim from critics for its imagery. Background and release Todd McFarlane felt that Marilyn Manson \\"epitomizes\\" Spawn. Marilyn Manson's eponymous vocalist told the Phoenix New Times that he wrote \\"Long Hard Road Out of Hell\\" \\"while on the road.\\" He said that the song \\"changes someone's singing and writing at the same time, the rhythm of your vocal.\\" Though it was not written for the film, the song was released on the soundtrack album for Spawn (1997), a film based on the comic book character of the same name; the soundtrack was curated by Happy Walters. Todd McFarlane, the creator of Spawn, told Billboard: \\"If any artist epitomizes my anti-hero Spawn, it's Marilyn Manson.\\" Similar to the Judgment Night soundtrack, another Walters project which featured a fusion of hip hop music and rock music, the Spawn soundtrack consisted of collaborations between hard rock or heavy metal bands and electronic music acts. \\"Long Hard Road Out of Hell\\" features backing vocals from Kelli Ali, the front-woman of British trip hop band Sneaker Pimps. Neither Ali or her band-mate Liam Howe felt that the rock bands featured on the soundtrack were very good, but thought that collaborating with one of the bands would give them the chance to, in Howe's words, \\"polish a turd.\\" Manson would recall that while recording the song, \\"The guitar player of the Sneaker Pimps had just got hit in the foreskin and he told me about it, which is a dumb as fuck thing to do, because the first thing I did was hit him in the dick, and I'm sure that probably added to the tension in the room.\\" The two bands became engaged in a brief dispute soon after the song's release. Ali complained that the Sneaker Pimps were not present during the song's final mixing, and that they were never issued a master tape. She went on to call the song \\"crap.\\" Manson responded by calling the Sneaker Pimps' involvement \\"a bit of a favor, in a sense, because we had already written the song, and I was interested in finding a girl to sing back-up vocals on it, and [they] were asking to be involved. I wasn't that familiar with them. I thought the girl's voice was great. When we worked on the song, I think they were a little upset because there wasn't much for them to do. The song was already done.\\" He also refuted claims that the Sneaker Pimps were never issued with a master recording, suggesting that they had created a remix for the song, but had refused permission for it to appear on the single when they were informed it would appear as a b-side, instead of being released as the main single version. \\"Long Hard Road Out of Hell\\" was released as a single alongside its instrumental, a remix of the song called the \\"Critter Remix\\" and the instrumental mix of \\"Kick the PA\\" (1997) by Korn and the Dust Brothers. Manson has called \\"Long Hard Road Out of Hell\\" \\"one of my favorites\\". The track shares its title with Manson's autobiography, The Long Hard Road Out of Hell (1998), and was included on the band's greatest hits album, Lest We Forget: The Best Of (2004). Composition and style The song's title references Paradise Lost (1667) by John Milton. \\"Long Hard Road Out of Hell\\" was written by Marilyn Manson, Twiggy Ramirez, and produced by Manson with Sean Beavan. The track is an arena rock and gothic rock song with a length of four minutes and twenty-one seconds. The title of the song is a reference to John Milton's epic poem Paradise Lost (1667), wherein Satan says: \\"long is the way/ And hard, that out of Hell leads up to light.\\" The song's lyrics are about self- loathing. According to A.A. Dowd of The A.V. Club, \\"Long Hard Road Out of Hell\\" resembles the music of Marilyn Manson, particularly songs from Antichrist Superstar (1996), far more than the music of the Sneaker Pimps, though its \\"clicking beat\\" and background vocals do separate the track from Marilyn Manson's usual shock rock. Dowd also found the song reminiscent of the kind of music played at Ozzfest. Alec Chillingworth of Metal Hammer saw the track as similar to the singles from Antichrist Superstar only more subdued, in the vein of the band's subsequent album Mechanical Animals (1998). PopMatters Lance Teegarden felt that the tracks' \\"layered buzzsaw guitar riffs\\" and Manson's shout-like vocal performance on the chorus made \\"Long Hard Road Out of Hell\\" sound like \\"Rock Is Dead\\" (1998) and \\"The Love Song\\" (2000). Dowd also noted that the lyrics of the song could be seen as referring to the life of the film's title character ‚Äì an assassin who is murdered, brought back to life, and given super-powers through a Faustian bargain ‚Äì as Spawn's \\"road out of hell [was] long and hard\\". Dowd viewed the track as one of the few songs on the soundtrack which \\"feel[s] specifically catered...to the Spawn mythos.\\" Critical reception Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised \\"Long Hard Road Out of Hell\\". In his review of Lest We Forget: The Best Of, The Chicago Maroon Matt Zakosek wrote that \\"every time you're ready to write him off as the obligatory recording artist of the moment to piss off the religious right, Manson comes out of left field with a surprisingly heartfelt, poetic track like 'The Reflecting God' or 'Long Hard Road Out of Hell.'\\" Jim Louvau of the Phoenix New Times deemed it one of his favorite songs by the band, alongside \\"Get Your Gunn\\" (1994). Chillingworth of Metal Hammer ranked the song sixth on his list of \\"The 10 most underrated Marilyn Manson songs\\", saying \\"'Long Hard Road Out Of Hell' is more than your standard Manson banger. It served as a weird body of water in which Manson tested some of his tricks\\". Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic praised the song for being \\"a good bridge between the goth-industrial Antichrist Superstar and the electronically tweaked glam of Mechanical Animals.\\" MetalSucks' Axl Rosenberg said that \\"Long Hard Road Out of Hell\\" is \\"fine\\" and \\"basically sounds like Antichrist Superstar-era Manson with female backing vocals.\\" Rosenberg found the track superior to other cuts from Spawn: The Album such as the DJ Spooky remix of Metallica's \\"For Whom the Bell Tolls\\" (1985) and \\"Satan\\" (1998) by Kirk Hammett and Orbital. Dowd of The A.V. Club said that, while he initially cared for the song, it \\"is basically just a Manson anthem with some very casual bells and whistles attached\\". Teegarden of PopMatters said that the track \\"adhere[s] to standard-issue, industrial shock-rock formulas\\" and fails to distinguish itself from other Marilyn Manson songs. Thrillist's Dan Jackson did not see \\"Long Hard Road Out of Hell\\" as one of Spawn: The Album \\"standout tracks\\". Music video The clip has an Aleister Crowley-lookalike. MTV News reported in 1997 that the Sneaker Pimps would not be involved in the song's music video. Manson initially approached Jonathan Glazer to direct the video and asked him to watch David Lynch's Lost Highway (1997) for inspiration. Glazer watched the film's opening credits, which feature images of a \\"road rushing beneath the camera\\" before falling asleep. As the film's opening credits had entered his mind, Glazer proposed that the video center on a man being chased down a dark, desolate road by an old car. Manson was unimpressed by this idea and decided not to use it; Glazer would use his rejected concept for his video for \\"Karma Police\\" (1997) by Radiohead. Upon seeing the \\"Karma Police\\" video for the first time, Manson was reportedly upset. The music video for the song was directed by Matthew Rolston, and was filmed at the site of Robert F. Kennedy's assassination, the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. The video features examples of tableaux vivants, images composed of people holding poses. It also features perverted Christian iconography, with the Virgin Mary depicted as being soaked in blood. In the clip, Manson is androgynous, and is shown wearing a dress and posing like a pin-up model. A group of models who strike sexualized poses in the clip initially appear to be female, but are revealed to be male. One of the models transforms into a figure who resembles Aleister Crowley, a Victorian era occultist whose writings have influenced Manson. According to Mike Rampton of Kerrang!, the video got little airplay on television due to contemporary attitudes toward gender and blasphemy. Manson has said that he likes the video because \\"it's one part sexy and one part dark.\\" =Reception= Jonathan Barkan of Bloody Disgusting opined: \\"The video, which plays out almost like a dream, is an absolute visual treat. It's incredibly polished and shiny, makes beautiful use of color, and strongly challenges gender norms\\". Noisecreep Chris Ford ranked the clip sixth on his list of the \\"10 Best Marilyn Manson Videos\\", adding that its use of tableaux vivants is \\"especially effective\\". Writing for Noisey, Alexandra Serio wrote that the depiction of the Virgin Mary in the clip is part of the band's history of \\"pissing off Jesus Christ\\". In Kerrang!, Mike Rampton praised Manson's \\"extraordinarily beautiful\\" hair in the video, adding \\"Clad in the cymbal-like bustier of an ectomorphic Brunhilde or an Amanda Lepore-esque striking sexual Valkyrie, his glorious locks are a sight to behold. Or maybe it's a wig.\\" Track listing Personnel Credits adapted from the liner notes of Lest We Forget: The Best Of. * Marilyn Manson  lead and background vocals, keyboards, production, mixing * Twiggy Ramirez  acoustic, bass and electric guitars * Kelli Ali  background vocals * Sean Beavan  engineering, production, mixing * Devon Kirkpatrick  assistant engineer * Tony Giampaolo  assistant engineer See also *List of songs recorded by Marilyn Manson *Paradise Lost in popular culture References Category:1997 singles Category:Marilyn Manson (band) songs Category:Music videos directed by Matthew Rolston Category:1997 songs Category:Songs written by Marilyn Manson Category:Interscope Records singles Category:Songs written by Jeordie White Category:Gothic rock songs Category:Sneaker Pimps songs Category:Cross- dressing-related mass media ","title":"Long Hard Road Out of Hell"},{"id":"11171858","text":"Panonija i ja (English: Pannonia and me) is an album of Zvonko Bogdan, Bunjevac singer from Vojvodina, Serbia.

Introduced in 1996, the coach was originally intended as a low-cost alternative to the MAN Lion's Star. In July 2020, the coach was awarded \\"Coach of the Year 2020\\" at the EMT Awards. Rear view Sound Clip of a 2016 MAN Lion's Coach Supreme Euro 6 with D2676LOH in the rear cabin on a 15% incline. Please wear headphones or play through monitors for full effect Background In 1992 MAN introduced the Lion's Star coach. This coach influenced the naming system of subsequent MAN coaches. In 1994 the Lion's Star RH 403 was voted Coach of the Year. First Generation - 1996 - 2002 In year 1996, besides the famous ‚ÄúLion's Star‚Äù series, a more cheaper coach model named ‚ÄúLion's Coach‚Äù, produced in Turkey, was introduced. For the first time, it also includes a 3-axles version called MAN Lion's Top Coach. The optical difference to Lion's Star is the redesigned front, especially the grooves with the form of a triangle under the windshield wipers. The 12m FRH version is capable for 49 passengers, 1 tourist guide and 1 driver. The D2866 LOH 23 6-cylinder diesel motor with 294 kW (400 hp) and the D2866 LOH 20 6-cylinder diesel motor with 309 kW (420 hp) were available. A manual transmission with 8 forward and 1 backward gear was standard.  Second Generation - 2002 - 2017  The second generation was introduced in 2002 and manufactured until 2017, which was known as R07, R09 - RHC 414, 464, 444. This model also ran alongside a new generation of the more luxurious top-model, the MAN Lion's Star. In 2003 the MAN Lion's Coach was awarded the Red Dot award and a year later was awarded the iF Product Design Award, which is awarded annually by Industrial Forum Design Hanover, in 2004. The MAN Lion's Coach came with three lengths (12.000mm with 2 axles, 13.260mm and 13.800mm with 3 axles) and two MAN Common Rail engines from the D20 series. The 10.5 litre inline 6 cylinder D2066LOH and the 12.4 litre inline 6 cylinder D2676LOH were rated from 309kW (420hp) to 368kW (500hp). The second generation MAN Lion's Coach also shares the same DNA as the Neoplan Tourliner the only difference is the main body and design. MAN continued to develop the Coach over its lifespan. The second generation model went through upgrades and various facelifts in its lifetime and its engines continued to be cleaner progressing through the Euro emission Class Euro 3 to Euro 6c. The original model 2003-2008 featured a plain nose end with MAN logo and small radiator grill in the centre and the emissions class progressed from Euro III to Euro IV. The first facelift model (2008-2015) featured a new nose-end design of the subtle and traditional radiator grille ribbing depending on the options of the customer. This could also be seen with an edge trim underneath the windscreen with the MAN logo in the centre. The emission class is progressed from Euro IV to Euro VI. The final facelift (2015-2017) model featured a new nose-end with a black panel with the MAN logo in the centre and the emission class remained at Euro VI. Third Generation - 2017 - Present The third generation MAN Lion's Coach was unveiled to the public at the Busworld 2017 in Kortrijk on 24 October 2017. It features a complete new design over its predecessor featuring a distinctive design giving it a modern yet timeless appearance. The Lion's Coach is now available in four lengths: 12,101 mm and 13,091 mm as a 2-axle vehicle, and 13,361 mm and 13,901 mm as a 3-axle vehicle. The 13m version includes six additional seats more than the 12 m version. The customer can select an optional wheelchair lift to cater for disabled passengers. All four variants of the new MAN Lion's Coach models have space for a maximum of 53, 57, 59 or 63 passengers. The luggage compartments have a volume of between 11.7 and 14.3 m3 depending on the model. The D26 Engine and driveline have been up-rated in this model including an extended axle ratio i=2.73 and an increased power output (an increase of 30 hp and 300 Nm compared to its predecessor). All the components are matched specifically which makes the vehicle particularly efficient. T√úV Bavaria have recently certified that the MAN Lion's Coach is able to drive 100 km using just 19.4 litres of fuel, which is an impressive figure indeed. The Lion's Coach also stands out in terms of the innovative safety solutions it provides for drivers, passengers and other road users ‚Äì including OptiView, the first mirror replacement system to feature on a coach. There are cameras on both sides of the vehicle that provide real-time imaging on two displays that can be easily seen by the driver, thus eliminating the blind spot. In 2020 MAN will be introducing a new drive and turn assist system that will ensure an even greater degree of safety. A turn assist system with active warning signals and a pedestrian recognition system, a speed limit display and an automatic road sign recognition system are setting new standards when it comes to safety. The new PCV (Premium Comfort Valve) shock absorber technology and an optimised vehicle configuration deliver enhanced driving comfort, improved handling and higher safety reserves. All of these individual measures make the MAN Lion's Coach an extremely attractive, efficient and reliable vehicle. It boasts innovative safety features, is connected to a digital network and can be used in a range of applications, simplifying bus operators‚Äô business. The third generation MAN Lion's Coach has won several prizes since its introduction, including the \\"Grand Coach Award\\" at Busworld 2017, the \\"Busplaner Innovation Prize 2018\\" in category \\"Vehicles and Fleet\\", the \\"iF Design Award 2018, and the \\"Coach of the Year 2020\\" award at the Busworld 2019 in Brussels.  Models  = MAN Fortuna = MAN Fortuna Mega In the Turkish market the MAN Lion's Coach was also known as the MAN Fortuna between 2004 and 2006. There is not much difference between both models possibly seating arrangement and aftermarket additions at the customers. The 12m version is called Fortuna and the longer version Fortuna Mega. =MAN Lion's Coach Midi= In year 2014, in cooperation with Caetanobus from Portugal, MAN developed a 10m version Lion's Coach, which was presented in Munich, Germany in the same year. This midi-touring coach offers seating for up to 40 passengers, meeting the demands of a luxury coach, and was designed for carrying smaller travel groups. It stands out especially for its compact size and maximum comfort. Similar to Lion's Coach Supreme, its optics are upgraded by silver aluminium stripes. =MAN Lion's Comfort - R313/R353= alt= Parallel to the former √úL interurban bus series, there has been an optimised version based on √úL models with better comfort and equipment for group travels. The engines are powered from 310 to 350 hp. The optical difference to the √úL model was the 2nd door with high panels instead of low ones, which was both available as single or double leaf door. The Lion's Comfort series was discontinued with the introduction of 2nd generation Lion's Coach. =MAN Lion's Star / Lion's Coach Supreme= File:G√≥r Busz 2009 Kft. , 3780 L√°dbeseny≈ë,Hungary MAN Lions Star, FLX-352 - Flickr - sludgegulper.jpgLion's Star 1st generation File:MAN Lions Coach Supreme, Alba Cars, Belgium. 161 BFS - Flickr - sludgegulper.jpgLion's Coach 2nd generation ‚ÄúSupreme‚Äù File:MAN Lion's Coach Supreme - Rear Wheel Cover.jpgMAN Lion's Coach Supreme - (Rear Wheel Cover) The Lion's Star is a luxury coach model introduced by MAN in year 1994, which is based on former FRH series. It became the award ‚ÄúCoach of the Year‚Äù in the same year. The second generation of Lion's Star was introduced in 2002. It owns more optical differences in opposition to Lion's Coach: A silver aluminium stripe on the C-pillar, rear wheel cover, and black \\"radiator grilling\\" in the front as decoration. Even though the second generation Lion's Star was chosen again for ‚ÄúCoach of the Year‚Äù in 2004, its production was concluded in the same year with the introduction of Euro IV emission standards. The optical design elements were succeeded with a special edition named ‚ÄúSupreme‚Äù. =MAN Lion's Coach Team Edition= MAN alt= Inspired by the Bundesliga-teambuses from FC Bayern M√ºnchen, Borussia Dortmunds, VfL Wolfsburg and 1. FC Kaiserslautern, MAN offered a special edition of its successful Lion's Coach in year 2011, which is limited to 50 units. The exterior design of ‚ÄúTeam Edition‚Äù is refined by chrome foil stripes in the front and on the C-pillar. A carpet in football field turf look in the entrance expect the passengers. The headrests on driver's and passenger's seats are decorated with letters about typical football words in German e.g. ‚ÄúChefcoach‚Äù, ‚ÄúFlottengott‚Äù, ‚ÄúSpielmacher‚Äù and ‚ÄúTorj√§ger‚Äù. The travel comfort is guaranteed by a Frenzel FOB 554 mobile kitchen with coffee machine and 19-inch monitors with the possibility of showing map navigation. Three length variants of 12m (30 units), 13.26m (10 units) and 13.8m (10 units) are available to choose. All variants are 2.55m wide and 3.81m high. The baggage room volume is rated from 10 to 11.3 cubic meters. The Lion's Coach Team Edition is powered by a powerful MAN Common- Rail-Diesel engine (D2676 LOH26) rated by 324 kW (440 hp) with a torque of 2100Nm. The MAN Pure Diesel technology realizes EEV without an addition of AdBlue. An automated 12-speed MAN TipMatic manual transmission with EasyStart and ZF Intarder and a 6-speed automatic transmission with Voith-Retarder are available. Electronic stability program (ESP), Electronic Braking System (EBS), Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) and Traction Control (ASR) and a rear camera are equipped for a great safety condition. A toilet on board with smoke detector is standard. The 12m variant is equipped with polished Alcoa aluminium rims, which is optional at other lengths. Depending on length and equipment option, 44 to 57 seats are possible. = MAN Lion's Coach EfficientLine = alt= In 2012 Premiered at IAA 2012 was the MAN Lion's Coach efficient line which championed maximised efficiency, weight saving and total cost of ownership: It had various equipment such as Eco-Hypoid rear axle which was maintenance friendly and designed to run at lower speeds, a Tyre Pressure Monitoring system (TPM) and the MAN AdBlue¬Æ technology with selective catalytic reduction (SCR) which reduces emissions of nitrogen oxides. All would contribute to reducing consumption by up to 4 litres of diesel over 100 km, compared with a conventionally configured Lion's Coach. On an annual mileage of 100,000 km it could save up to 4,000 litres of fuel which equates to a cost saving of up to EUR 5,000* each year.

Hancock built gardens in the UK in the 1920s, 30s and 40s and in the United States in the 1930s. A few are well known ‚Äì the roof gardens at Derry and Toms in Londonwww.roofgardens.com and the Rockefeller Center in New York,www.rockefellercenter.com the garden at Twyn-yr-Hydd Housetrainingwales.com in Margam and the rock and water garden he built for Princess Victoria at Coppins, Iver, England.  Early life  Clarence Henry Ralph Hancock was born at 20 Keppoch Street, Cardiff, Wales on 2 July 1893. His father Clarence Hancock worked for a company known as Evans and Hancock who were Auctioneers and Estate Agents based at Borough Chambers, Wharton Street, Cardiff. In 1917 Ralph married Hilda Muriel Ellis (known as Muriel) and moved to Augusta Road, Penarth. Their first son, Clarence Neville Bramley Hancock (Bramley), was born in 1918 and their second son, Denys, also born in Penarth in 1920. At this time Hancock's occupation was a Marine and General Insurance Broker working from James Street, Cardiff. However, in 1926 he had changed career, becoming a Fellow of the Royal Horticultural Society. He had been known to have an interest in horticulture, particularly orchids. Hancock and his family moved to Downside Road, Sutton, Surrey, England and in 1928 a daughter, Sheila Muriel was born. It was from here in 1927 that Hancock undertook the first of his more famous garden projects, designing and constructing a rock and water garden for H.R.H. Princess Victoria at her home 'Coppins' in Iver, Buckinghamshire. Hancock was reported to be extremely proud of the garden and HRH presented to him \\"a little diamond and sapphire tie pin\\" one of his most treasured possessions. The main influences of this period was William Robinsonwww.gardenvisit.com and Gertrude Jekyllgertrudejekyll.co.uk and Ralph incorporated this \\"arts and crafts movement\\" into his designs.  America and 'The Rock' On 31 May 1930, Hancock set sail for New York. To promote his work in the US, he published an illustrated booklet titled English Gardens in America in which he described himself as being 'Landscape Gardener to HRH the Princess Victoria of England'. The promotional booklet must have worked as Hancock went on to design an exhibition garden at Erie Station in New Jersey. He also staged exhibits at the Massachusetts Horticulture Show where he won several awards, including in 1933 the Presidents Cup. He was also one of the designers of the Lydia Duff Gray Hubbard garden in New Jersey which now forms part of the Garden Club of America Collection. But it was between 1933 and 1935 that Ralph was to embark on one of his most ambitious projects, the construction of spectacular gardens at the Rockefeller Center in New York. For 75 years, formal gardens have bloomed on the roofs of the British Empire Building and Maison Fran√ßaise. Hancock's \\"Gardens of the Nations\\" emulated the cultural styles of gardens from Holland, France, Italy, and England, where each garden had its very own hostess dressed in themed costume. 3,000 tons of earth, 500 tons of bricks, 20,000 bulbs, 100 tons of natural stone, 2,000 trees and shrubs were delivered by the service elevator or man hauled using a block and tackle up the side of the eleven floors of the building. The garden also required 96,000 gallons of water which was lifted by an electric pump. Hancock was confident that what he had created would allow numerous opportunities for other similar gardens in the US. He declared that \\"the day of penthouse gardening are over and miles and miles of roof space in every metropolis in this country remain to be reclaimed by landscape gardening\\". Throughout the project Ralph was in regular correspondence with both John D Rockefeller and Nelson Rockefeller. As well as designing and building the gardens Hancock also ran the \\"Sky Garden Tour\\". Visitors were charged a dollar a time. The enterprise did not prove to be profitable and lost approximately $45,000 per year. By 1938 the attraction had closed. Image:Rockefeller_2007.jpgRockefeller Center English Roof gardens, 2007. Photo taken by granddaughter of Ralph Hancock.  The roof gardens at Derry and Toms  The gardens at the Rockefeller were visited by Trevor Bowen, the managing director of Barkers of Kensington, which had taken over Derry & Toms, a department store in Kensington, London. Bowen liked what he saw and employed Hancock to create a similar effect in the heart of London. This time Hancock was to build three gardens, each with its own unique style and planting. The gardens were; a Tudor garden with herringbone brickwork, impressive Tudor arches and wrought iron. The Spanish garden complete with palm trees and fountains as well as Moorish colonnades. And a woodland garden, built with a cascade, a river and its very own pink flamingoes. Once again the logistics involved in the construction were impressive. Before planting and building could start a thick bitumastic base was laid on the roof, followed by a layer of loose brick and rubble that was arranged in a fan-like pattern to aid drainage. On top of this was a 36-inch layer of topsoil into which the planting was made. Water came from Derry and Toms own artesian wells. On opening day the gardens contained over 500 different varieties of trees and shrubs. The gardens were completed in 1938 at a cost of ¬£25,000 and were officially opened by the Earl of Athlone in May of that year. Visitors were charged a shilling (5p) to tour the gardens and over the next 30 years over ¬£120,000 was raised for local hospitals. Today, the three gardens look virtually as they did in the late 1930s. Many of the original trees, now covered by preservation orders, remain. Image:Ralph Hancock Plaque.jpgRalph Hancock Commemorative Plaque, unveiled by members of the Hancock family on 29 January 2012  Family, the Chelsea Flower Show and World War II  By 1936 the Hancock family were living at 110 Sloane Street in London's fashionable Kensington, as well as owning a country house at Horne, Lingfield, Surrey. Ralph had purchased the derelict 16th century farmhouse in a dilapidated state and set about restoring the property to its former glory. He also designed and built one of his trademark gardens using many of the features that have become familiar, such as a herringbone brickwork path. Ralph and his young family took to the country life. Ralph decided to keep pigs and, although he employed someone to look after them, he even purchased a pig keeper's white coat, much to the amusement of the family. The family house at Horne was sold by Ralph in 1941. Ralph continued to be a very successful exhibitor at the Chelsea Flower Show, winning gold medals in 1936, '37 and '38. The gardens constructed at Chelsea had moved away from the naturalistic rock garden style towards the arts and crafts style that is now more associated with his later work. One of Ralph's specialities became the use of Moon Gates, which he used both at Chelsea and a number of other garden projects. His 1938 Chelsea garden was particularly popular. A review in Amateur Gardening said, \\"Mr Ralph Hancock had one of the most ambitious schemes in the garden avenue; a model of an old mill cottage, complete with millstream and sunken garden, the whole construction being carried out in a most realistic manner. It was a centre of attraction throughout the show.\\" As well as designing gardens, Hancock also wrote a book titled When I Make a Garden, which was reprinted in 1950 and updated to include images of the Derry and Toms roof gardens as well as later work. He also exhibited gardens at the Ideal Home Exhibition in 1936, '37 and '38. Each of the Ideal Homes gardens was required to conform to a theme. In 1936 the theme was Gardens and Music. The garden featured 1,200 plants that were brought over from the USA. The 1937 theme was Gardens of the Lovers. The theme for the 1938 show was Novelist and their Gardens for which the designers had to take as inspiration their favourite living author. Ralph chose as his inspiration Rafael Sabatini. Sabatini was famous for his tales of high adventure such as Scaramouche, Captain Blood and The Sea Hawk, all of which became successful motion pictures. Captain Blood was produced in 1935 and gave a young Errol Flynn his first ever Hollywood starring role. The show catalogue for that year hints at some form of collaboration between the author and the architect. Although of Italian birth Sabatini was living in Hereford. Ralph's garden tribute to Sabatini featured a half-timbered cottage and also his trademark herringbone brickwork. The planting consisted of rhododendrons, heathers and aquatic plants near a winding brook. In 1939 Ralph won a silver cup at Chelsea for a Formal Mediterranean Garden. Gardens and beautiful landscapes were put on hold with the advent of World War II. Ralph, Denys and Bramley all joined the military, even Muriel drove ambulances. Ralph, who had previously served in the Great War, was re-activated. Second Lieutenant Denys Hancock, who was to tragically lose his life in November 1941 at the battle of Sidi Rezegh , North Africa joined the Royal Tank Regiment and Captain Bramley Hancock served as an Artillery FOO (Forward Observation Officer). Sheila, who was only 11 when war was declared, was sent to neutral America to stay with friends. Back home in England, Derry and Toms was damaged during an enemy air- raid. However, after the war ended it was rebuilt. Although the garden was restored to its pre-war splendour neither Ralph nor Muriel fully recovered after the death of their youngest son, Denys.  The latter years  After World War II, Hancock began to work with his son, Bramley. Together they constructed hundreds of private gardens throughout the United Kingdom. Ralph Hancock also submitted elaborate plans to several City Councils, including Gardens for Cardiff, Hull and Peace Gardens at Temple Newsam in Leeds. None of the plans were ever taken up. Nineteen forty-seven saw the Chelsea Flower Show restart. Hancock returned with a rock garden and a formal garden, he also had an exhibit in the garden designers section. It was at one of these post-war Chelsea shows that Sir David Evans Bevans, a Director at Barclays Bank commissioned Ralph and Bramley to build the gardens at Twyn-yr-Hydd. Hancock had also purchased a little cottage at Chailey Green, near Lewes, Sussex. He had planned to restore the cottage and had drawn-up plans to do so. Ralph died before work started and it was left to Bramley to complete the restoration. The gardens at Twyn-yr-Hydd are the last designed by Hancock before his death of a heart attack on 30 August 1950. Books by this author *When I Make a Garden, 1935, Reprinted 1950.

A widely available variety at most UK butchers and supermarkets, the sausage is commonly dominated by the herb sage, rather than the more peppery flavour balance found in other regional English sausages such as the Cumberland sausage. Other herbs such as parsley and thyme are often used, although these are not considered authentic Lincolnshire sausages. Lincolnshire sausages are also characterised by their open, chunky texture, the result of the constituent pork being coarsely ground rather than minced. Ingredients and manufacture Lincolnshire sausages are made with coarsely chopped or ground pork mixed with binders, seasonings and preservative. Traditionally, the dominant seasoning flavour has always been that of the herb sage, but some recipes include other herbs, such as parsley or thyme, and flavourings such as onion. Efforts to standardise and control the manufacture of Lincolnshire sausages have resulted in a proposed ingredients list to which future manufacturers of Lincolnshire sausages may have to adhere: =Ingredients= * British pork, coarse cut, minimum meat content 70% * Maximum fat content 25% * Breadcrumbs/bread rusk * Sage, salt and pepper * Natural pork casings (or sheep casings, for chipolata- style sausages) * Sulphite preservative (to 450 ppm maximum) =Variations= A Lincolnshire sausage, manufactured in the unlinked style more commonly associated with the Cumberland sausage Unlike the Cumberland sausage, there is no standard width or length for a Lincolnshire sausage. Commonly, the variety is associated with a broader style, but Lincolnshire chipolata sausages are also widely available. Some manufacturers produce meat-free sausages that use sage as the dominant flavouring and these are commonly sold as vegetarian Lincolnshire sausages. European Protected Status In 2004, a group of 13 Lincolnshire butchers, led by the large sausage-producing firm of George Adams & Sons, began moves to protect the name of the Lincolnshire sausage, applying for Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) status under European Union law. In support of the PGI application, the Lincolnshire Sausage Association was formed in early 2006. Under these proposals, to qualify as a 'Lincolnshire' sausage, not only would a sausage have to be manufactured in the county, but it would also have to conform to the standard ingredient list, above. In 2010, a group of Lincolnshire butchers introduced a voluntary 5 pence 'tax' in support of the PGI application, and to fund the fight against Lincolnshire sausages being manufactured elsewhere or making too much use of seasonings other than sage.Lincolnshire 'sausage 'tax' is introduced Competitions Every year, a competition is held in Lincoln to find the best Lincolnshire sausage.

He was promoted to lieutenant on 1 July 1896, and served in the Tirah Campaign on the North West Frontier in 1897‚Äì98. Joining the 21st Lancers in South Africa for the Second Boer War, he served as aide-de-camp to Lieutenant-General Sir Edward Locke Elliot between 26 March 1901 and September 1902.Hart‚Ä≤s Army list, 1902 He resigned his commission in the 21st Lancers on 8 October 1902. On the outbreak of the First World War he served on the Western Front before joining Major-General Beauvoir De Lisle‚Äôs 1st Cavalry Division staff. He followed De Lisle to Gallipoli when the latter took command of the 29th Division. Hardress Lloyd was appointed second in command of the 1st Battalion Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers in May 1916, becoming its commanding officer a month later. Whilst commanding this battalion he was awarded the DSO in January 1917. In February 1917 he was appointed commander of D Battalion, one of the founding units of the Heavy Branch Machine Gun Corps. The battalion's first actions were at the Battle of Arras (1917) and included the disastrous Bullecourt operation in April 1917. The 3rd Tank Brigade was formed under his command on 27 April 1917 and Hardress-Lloyd remained in charge of this brigade until the war ended. He was promoted to Brigadier-General on 16 April 1918 and a Bar was added to his DSO in July. He was also mentioned in despatches six times and appointed a Chevalier of the L√©gion d‚ÄôHonneur.

These relationships are formalized through one of a variety of mechanisms, including formal contracts, Other Transaction Agreements, and Cooperative Research and Development Agreements, among others. Occasionally these relationships extend to non-industry entities also, as with the Michigan Department of Transportation and various academic institutions.  Next Generation Combat Vehicle  U.S. Army GVSC is the lead Science and Technology (S&T;) Center for the Next Generation Combat Vehicle (NGCV). As such, it investigates the technologies and develops the capabilities supporting the NGCV requirements. The NGCV is one of the U.S. Army's six modernization priorities.  Robotic Vehicles  U.S. Army GVSC is the Department of Defense's lead agency for automated, driver-optional, and driver-assist technology development for ground vehicles. Developed within its Ground Vehicle Robotics portfolio, these technologies apply through the common, open-source Robotics Operating System- Military to tactical and combat vehicle platforms and applications. = Automated Ground Resupply = GVSC furthers the development of autonomous driving in resupply activities through its Automated Ground Resupply (AGR) program. The keystone project in this program is its AMAS, or Automated Mobility Applique System, an applique kit that enables automated, driver- optional, and driver-assist behaviors to current Army vehicle platforms. This technology is intended to manifest as \\"leader-follower\\" or \\"platooning\\" of line-haul resupply vehicles in which a lead vehicle is manually driven, remotely-driven, or driven autonomously through waypoint navigation and the follower vehicles in a convoy are fed driving instructions from the lead vehicle.  Automated Convoy Testing on Interstate Highways  In 2016, and again in 2017, U.S. Army GVSC with the Michigan Department of Transportation conducted tests and demonstrations of its leader-follower technology on Interstate 69 and across the Blue Water Bridge in Eastern Michigan. The tests, intended to exercise the Dedicated Short Range Communications radios installed both in the vehicles and along the roadways, demonstrated the effectiveness of Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to- Infrastructure (V2I) communications along the interstate. Further tests are expected in conjunction with the American Center for Mobility in Ypsilanti, Michigan. Fuel Cell Electric vehicles Through a cooperative partnership with General Motors, U.S. Army GVSC characterized and demonstrated the unique fuel cell-equipped Chevrolet Colorado ZH2 in 2017‚Äì2018, highlighting the center's pursuit and development of technologies that are nearing a level of readiness applicable to the military. U.S. Army GVSC indicates the technology may provide silent vehicle mobility, power generation, enhanced low-end torque, a reduction in the vehicle's thermal signature, and a broader flexibility for fuel sources. Jointly unveiled by General Motors and U.S. Army GVSC at the 2016 annual meeting of the Association of the United States Army, the vehicle's demonstrations completed in 2018 and follow-on projects are anticipated.

He notably won two successive runnings of the Coronation Cup at Epsom. Background Owned and bred by Saeed Manana of the United Arab Emirates, he was sired by Caerleon, a son of Nijinsky, and out of the mare, Lucayan Princess. Conditioned by veteran trainer Clive Brittain, throughout his life Warrsan was a difficult horse to handle. Racing career His best racing results came late, beginning at age four in 2002 when he had two second-place finishes in the Group 3 Cumberland Lodge Stakes and St. Simon Stakes. The following year, the five-year-old horse began to blossom as a solid competitor, winning the 2003 Group 3 John Porter Stakes in April then a few weeks later the Group 2 Jockey Club Stakes. However, his most important win of the year came at Epsom Downs in June's Coronation Cup, a Group 1 race that attracts the best older horses in the country. Much traveled that year, Warrsan raced in Italy in the 2003 Group I Gran Premio di Milano where he ran second to Leadership. He had third-place finishes in the Gran Premio del Jockey Club in Italy, the Rheinland-Pokal in Germany and in the Hong Kong Vase at Sha Tin Racecourse. In 2004, Warrsan became one of only five horses to win the Coronation Cup twice but then was beaten by Refuse To Bend in July's Eclipse Stakes at Sandown Park. In the fall, he won Germany's most prestigious race, the Grosser Preis von Baden at Iffezheim Racecourse in Baden-Baden. In 2005 he failed to win a record third Coronation Cup but in September won his second consecutive Grosser Preis von Baden. Out of the money in both October's Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe and November's Japan Cup, Warrsan was retired in April 2006. His connections had hoped to find him a place at stud but he reportedly died as a result of a tumor on June 19 at trainer Clive Brittain's yard.

Landowners, land use agencies, stormwater management experts, environmental specialists, water use surveyors and communities all play an integral part in watershed management.  Controlling pollution  In agricultural systems, common practices include the use of buffer strips, grassed waterways, the re-establishment of wetlands, and forms of sustainable agriculture practices such as conservation tillage, crop rotation and inter-cropping. After certain practices are installed, it is important to continuously monitor these systems to ensure that they are working properly in terms of improving environmental quality. In urban settings, managing areas to prevent soil loss and control stormwater flow are a few of the areas that receive attention. A few practices that are used to manage stormwater before it reaches a channel are retention ponds, filtering systems and wetlands. It is important that storm-water is given an opportunity to infiltrate so that the soil and vegetation can act as a \\"filter\\" before the water reaches nearby streams or lakes. In the case of soil erosion prevention, a few common practices include the use of silt fences, landscape fabric with grass seed and hydroseeding. The main objective in all cases is to slow water movement to prevent soil transport.  Governance  The 2nd World Water Forum held in The Hague in March 2000 raised some controversies that exposed the multilateral nature and imbalance the demand and supply management of freshwater. While donor organizations, private and government institutions backed by the World Bank, believe that freshwater should be governed as an economic good by appropriate pricing, NGOs however, held that freshwater resources should be seen as a social good. Oweyegha-Afunaduula, F.C., I. Afunaduula and M. Balunywa (2003). NGO-sing the Nile Basin Initiative: a myth or reality? Paper at 3rd World Water Forum, Japan, March 2003 The concept of network governance where all stakeholders form partnerships and voluntarily share ideas towards forging a common vision can be used to resolve this clash of opinion in freshwater management. Also, the implementation of any common vision presents a new role for NGOs because of their unique capabilities in local community coordination, thus making them a valuable partner in network governance.Evans J: Environmental governance (2012), Routledge, Chapter 4 Watersheds replicate this multilateral terrain with private industries and local communities interconnected by a common watershed. Although these groups share a common ecological space that could transcend state borders, their interests, knowledge and use of resources within the watershed are mostly disproportionate and divergent, resulting to the activities of a specific group adversely impacting on other groups. Examples being the Minamata Bay poisoning that occurred from 1932 to 1968, killing over 1,784 individuals and the Wabigoon River incidence of 1962. Furthermore, while some knowledgeable groups are shifting from efficient water resource exploitation to efficient utilization, net gain for the watershed ecology could be lost when other groups seize the opportunity to exploit more resources. This gap in cooperative communication among multilateral stakeholders within an interconnected watershed, even with the likely presence of the usually reactive and political boundary-constraint state regulations, makes it necessary for the institutionalization of an ecological-scale cooperative network of stakeholders.

Moreover, the need to create partnerships between donor organizations, private and government institutions and community representatives like NGOs in watersheds is to enhance an \\"organizational society\\" among stakeholders.Ewalt, J.

Also, it explicates the concept of network governance, which is \\"the only alternative for collective action\\",5\\\\. Milward H and Provan K (2000). ‚ÄúHow Networks Are Governed.‚Äù In Heinrich C and Lynn L eds. Governance and Performance: Models, Methods and Results, Page 243. Washington, DC: Georgetown University Press. requiring government to rescale its role in decision making and collaborate with other stakeholders on a level playing field rather than in an administrative or hierarchical manner. Several riparian states have adopted this concept in managing the increasingly scarce resources of watersheds. These include the nine Rhine states, with a common vision of pollution control,8\\\\. Transboundary River Basin Management Regimes: the Rhine basin case study, Newater, pp1-37. Also available at: http://www.tudelft.nl/live/binaries/9229ebc0-66d0-47ca-9d25-5ab2184c85f4/doc/D131_Rhine_Final.pdf the Lake Chad and river Nile Basins, whose common vision is to ensure environmental sustainability. As a partner in the commonly shared vision, NGOs has adopted a new role in operationalizing the implementation of regional watershed management policies at the local level. For instance, essential local coordination and education are areas where the services of NGOs have been effective.7\\\\. Prabhakar K, Lavanya K, and Papa Rao A (2010); NGOs and Farmers Participation in Watershed Development Programme in Prakasam District, Asia-Pacific Journal of Social Science, Volume II (1) Pages173-182. Also available at: http://www.socialsciences-ejournal.org/3.9.%20Prabhakar.pdf. This makes NGOs the \\"nuclei\\" for successful watershed management. Recently, artificial Intelligence techniques such as neural networks have been utilized to address the problem of watershed management.  Environmental law  Environmental laws often dictate the planning and actions that agencies take to manage watersheds. Some laws require that planning be done, others can be used to make a plan legally enforceable and others set out the ground rules for what can and cannot be done in development and planning. Most countries and states have their own laws regarding watershed management. Those concerned about aquatic habitat protection have a right to participate in the laws and planning processes that affect aquatic habitats. By having a clear understanding of whom to speak to and how to present the case for keeping our waterways clean a member of the public can become an effective watershed protection advocate.

Its sculpted frieze is a classic example of the \\"plebeian style\\" in Roman sculpture. Eurysaces built the tomb for himself and perhaps also his wife Atistia around the end of the Republic (ca. 50-20 BC). Located in a prominent position just outside today's Porta Maggiore, the tomb was transformed by its incorporation into the Aurelian Wall; a tower subsequently erected by Honorius covered the tomb, the remains of which were exposed upon its removal by Gregory XVI in 1838. What is particularly significant about this extravagant tomb is that it was built by a freedman, a former slave. Three sides of the slightly trapezoidal structure remain largely intact. All have the same form, with over a plain lower storey, now mostly below ground level but exposed, a storey consisting of pairs of engaged columns between flat slabs, all crammed together with no space in between. The effect is far from the classical orders; at the corners the slabs turn to pilasters rising at the top level to unorthodox capitals combining scrolls at the sides with plant forms in the centre.The capitals are more typical of interior decoration in paint or stucco than a large stone facade. They are a sort of anticipation of the Composite order, usually traced to somewhat later. There are unusual circular openings in the topmost storey, now thought to represent kneading-basins or grain- measuring vessels. Below a cornice is the frieze, with continuous scenes in relief showing the operation of the bakery where Eurystaces made what was evidently a considerable fortune. Reconstructions imagine a gently rising roof above this, now lost.Reconstruction drawing  Marcus Vergilius Eurysaces  Although there is no conclusive statement on the monument that Eurysaces was a freedman - there is no \\"L\\" for libertus in the inscription ‚Äì there are a number of reasons for believing that this was the case. His name takes the form of a Roman praenomen and nomen followed by a Greek cognomen, nomenclature typical for a freedman, combining as it does the identity of the former owning family with that of the individual when a slave. The inscription also lacks the filiation usual for the freeborn. The banausic and labour-intensive activities commemorated, those of baking, are not usually celebrated by the freeborn upper classes. The unusual form of the monument and of its inscription have also been used to locate Eurysaces as a nouveau riche parvenu in the manner of Trimalchio, with his \\"na√Øve ostentation\\" vulgarly imitative of √©lite culture. The slightly later Pyramid of Cestius is another individualistic tomb for an evidently wealthy man outside the traditional √©lite; in this case it perhaps referred to his taking part in campaigns in Nubia. Setting Burial within the pomerium or sacred boundary of the city was generally prohibited. Although the precise extent of the pomerium at the various stages of its history is uncertain, it is believed to have later been coterminous with the Aurelian Walls, perhaps extending to the area of the Porta Maggiore after its expansion by Claudius. Streets of tombs in a prominent position just outside the city gates are known from Pompeii as well as the Via Appia. Eurysaces' tomb, at the junction of the Via Praenestina and Via Labicana just before entering Rome, was in a particularly prominent position, and its trapezoidal form was likely dictated by the space available. Other burial complexes in the vicinity are known, including the columbarium of Statilius Taurus, consul at the time of Augustus, with over seven hundred loculi or burial niches; and the first century BC tomb of the Societas Cantorum Graecorum (Association of Greek Singers). An inscription relating to another baker, Ogulnius, has also been found in local excavations.OGULNIUS PISTOR SIMI(laginarius) / AMICUS [Eurysacis?] or \\"Ogulnius, baker, flour- dealer, friend [of Eurysaces?]\\"  Monument  The tomb, dwarfed by the later Aqua Claudia, rises to a height of some thirty-three feet. Of concrete faced with travertine on a tufa base, it stands as a monument both to Eurysaces and, through the frieze, to the wider profession of baking. The style, very different from the classical Roman styles of tombs, makes Eurysaces' tomb stand out. The bakery at work in frieze reliefs The surviving part of the inscription reads \\"EST HOC MONIMENTVM MARCEI VERGILEI EVRYSACIS PISTORIS REDEMPTORIS APPARET,\\" or in English, \\"This is the monument of Marcus Vergilius Eurysaces, baker, contractor, public servant.\\" While the final word in this quote, \\"Apparet\\", is often translated as public servant, the actual Latin word for a public servant is Apparitor. Apparet is a verb meaning to appear or make apparent, this translation however does not seem to fit the rest of the inscription. The word Apparet is yet to be translated within the context of this quotation. In the BBC documentary Meet the Romans with Mary Beard, professor Mary Beard, translates \\"apparet\\" as \\"it's obvious!\\" Beard suggests \\"apparet\\" is signalling a joke, as if to say \\"get it?!\\". Thus Beard translates the epitaph as \\"This is the monument of Marcus Vergilius Eurysaces, baker, contractor, it's obvious.\\" A relief representing various stages of bread production runs along the top of the tomb. The relief depicts, on the south side, the delivery and grinding of grain and sifting of flour; on the north, the mixing and kneading of dough, forming of round loaves, and baking in a domed \\"pizza-type\\" oven; and, on the west, the stacking of loaves in baskets and their being taken for weighing. Related finds The Atistia inscription During demolition of the superimposed late antique fortifications by Pope Gregory XVI in 1838, a full-length relief portrait was discovered of a man and woman in toga and palla (taken to the Palazzo dei Conservatori); along with an inscription honouring one Atistia, a good wife whose remains were placed in a breadbasket; and an urn taking the form of such a breadbasket.FUIT ATISTIA UXOR MIHEI / FEMINA OPITUMA VEIXSIT / QUOIUS CORPORIS RELIQUAE / QUOD SUPERANT SUNT IN / HOC PANARIO or \\"Atistia was my wife; a most excellent lady in life; the surviving remains of her body are in this breadbasket\\" Theft of the female head from the relief in 1934 and uncertainty as to the present whereabouts of the urn, believed to be somewhere in the Museo Nazionale Romano, mean their study is now conducted from excavation drawings and early photographs. Reconstructions generally relate these items to the tomb on the grounds of their style, subject matter, and findspot, with Atistia becoming Eurysaces' wife, and the double relief and inscription occupying the upper register of the now lost east facade of the tomb.  Freedmen's Tombs  This tomb is one of many lavish tombs created by freedmen. These men were at first slaves, but, from the help of their masters, they were able to buy their freedom and begin their own livelihoods. They were proud of their freedom and earnings. Because of this, they many times created such lavish funerary monuments, such as Eurysaces' tomb. These freedmen had no family lines, which were important in Roman society. Therefore, these tombs may have been attempts at beginning a family history for future generations to appreciate.

Background  Turkey's terrain is structurally complex. A central massif composed of uplifted blocks and downfolded troughs, covered by recent deposits and giving the appearance of a plateau with rough terrain, is wedged between two folded mountain ranges that converge in the east. True lowland is confined to the plain of the Ergene river in Thrace, extending along rivers that discharge into the Aegean Sea or the Sea of Marmara, and to a few narrow coastal strips along the Black Sea and Mediterranean Sea coasts. Nearly 85% of the land is at an elevation of at least 450 meters; the median altitude of the country is 1,128 meters. In Asiatic Turkey, flat or gently sloping land is rare and largely confined to the deltas of the Kƒ±zƒ±l River, the coastal plains of Antalya and Adana, and the valley floors of the Gediz River and the B√ºy√ºk Menderes River, and some interior high plains in Anatolia, mainly around Tuz G√∂l√º (Salt Lake) and Konya Ovasƒ± (Konya Basin). Moderately sloping terrain is limited almost entirely outside Thrace to the hills of the Arabian Platform along the border with Syria. More than 80% of the land surface is rough, broken, and mountainous, and therefore is of limited agricultural value. The terrain's ruggedness is accentuated in the eastern part of the country, where the two mountain ranges converge into a lofty region with a median elevation of more than 1,500 meters, which reaches its highest point along the borders with Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran. Turkey's highest peak, Mount Ararat (Aƒürƒ± Daƒüƒ±)‚Äîabout 5,166 meters high‚Äîis situated near the point where the boundaries of the four countries meet.  Geological History  The earliest geological history of Turkey is poorly understood, partly because these oldest rocks in the region are involved into younger deformation phases that hindered their evolution. This created problem of reconstructing how the region has been tectonically assembled by plate motions. Turkey can be thought of as a collage of different continental pieces and remnants of oceanic lithospheric rocks amalgamated together by younger tectonic processes that involve accumulation of igneous (both plutonic and volcanic) and sedimentary rocks. = Plate tectonics = plate tectonics in Turkey: there are geologic faults around the Anatolian Plate, the African Plate, the Arabian Plate, and the Eurasian Plate. Except for a relatively small portion of its territory along the Syrian border that is a continuation of the Arabian Plate, Turkey geologically is part of the great Alpine belt that extends from the Atlantic Ocean to the Himalaya Mountains. This belt was formed during the Cenozoic Era (about 66 to 1.6 million years ago), as the Arabian, African, and Indian continental plates began to collide with the Eurasian Plate. This process is still at work today as the African Plate converges with the Eurasian Plate and the Anatolian Plate escapes towards the west and southwest along strike-slip faults. These are the North Anatolian Fault Zone, which forms the present day plate boundary of Eurasia near the Black Sea coast and, the East Anatolian Fault Zone, which forms part of the boundary of the North Arabian Plate in the southeast. As a result of this plate tectonics configuration, Turkey is one of the world's more active earthquake and volcanic regions.Kaymakci et al., 2010 The Anatolian Plate, together with the Aegean-Peloponnesus block, is located near the centre of a very wide region, including the Arabian Plate with the adjacent Zagros Mountains and central Iran, that moves in a circulatory pattern at a relatively fast rate of 20 mm/yr. The rate of this counter- clockwise motion increases near the Hellenic Trench system south of Turkey and decreases away from it (i.e. the Eurasian and African plates move at a rate of 5 mm/yr), resulting in internal deformations in several areas, including central and eastern Anatolia, south-western Aegean-Peloponnesus, Lesser Caucasus, and central Iran. The dominant process in the region is the subduction of the African Plate beneath the Hellenic Trench, and the deformation in the entire African-Arabian-Eurasian collision zone is most likely driven by the slab roll-back of the subducting African Plate in the East Mediterranean. Biryol et al., 2011 This process is further fuelled by slab-pull forces in the Makran Trench in the Gulf of Oman where the Arabian Plate is subducting under Eurasia. A response to this tectonic maelstrom is the rifting in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden which will separate Arabia from Africa. The tomography of the velocity propagation distributions of the P_n seismic waves both in an isotropic and anisotropic conditions, compared with the lateral variations of that velocity has highlighted the physical properties of the uppermost mantle and crustal thickness of the Earth. A study analyzed 700 earthquakes occurred in Turkey from 1999 to 2010 with magnitude degree major than 4.0 and the related 50.000 Pn first arrivals recorded by 832 seismic stations at a distance range of 180-1500 kms from the epicenter. The tomography highlighted that \\"Pn velocities are found to be lowest in eastern Turkey (<7.6 km s-1) and highest in the eastern Mediterranean Sea and Zagros Suture (>8.3 km s-1). Large Pn anisotropy is observed in the Aegean, central Anatolia and along the southern coast of Anatolia. [...] Large crustal thicknesses are observed along the Dinarides-Hellenides and along the southern coast of Anatolia.\\" = Rocks = Many of the rocks exposed in Turkey were formed long before this process began. Turkey contains outcrops of Precambrian rocks, (more than 540 million years old).Bozkurt et al., 2000 During the Mesozoic era (about 250 to 66 million years ago) a large ocean (Tethys Ocean), floored by oceanic lithosphere existed in-between the supercontinents of Gondwana and Laurasia (which lay to the south and north respectively).≈ûeng√∂r and Yƒ±lmaz, 1981 This large oceanic plate was consumed at subduction zones. At the subduction trenches the sedimentary rock layers that were deposited within the prehistoric Tethys Ocean were folded, faulted and tectonically mixed with huge blocks of crystalline basement rocks of the oceanic lithosphere. These blocks form a very complex mixture or m√©lange of rocks that include mainly serpentinite, basalt, dolerite, and chert.Okay and T√ºys√ºz, 1999 The Eurasian margin, now preserved in the Pontides (the Pontic Mountains along the Black Sea coast), is thought to have been geologically similar to the Western Pacific region today.Kaymakci, 2000 Volcanic arcs and back-arc basins formed and were emplaced onto Eurasia as ophiolites as they collided with microcontinents (literally relatively small plates of continental lithosphere).Ustaomer and Robertson, 1997 These microcontinents had been pulled away from the Gondwanan continent further south. Turkey is therefore made up from several different prehistorical microcontinents. During the Cenozoic (Tertiary about 66 to 1.6 million years) folding, faulting and uplifting, accompanied by volcanic activity and intrusion of igneous rocks was related to major continental collision between the larger Arabian and Eurasian plates.Robertson & Dixon, 1984  Earthquakes  Turkey's most severe earthquake in the twentieth century occurred in Erzincan on the night of 1939-12-27; it devastated most of the city and caused an estimated 30,000 deaths. Earthquakes of moderate intensity often continue with sporadic aftershocks over periods of several days or even weeks. Seismicity in Turkey is more likely to happen in the North Anatolian Fault Zone, East Anatolian Fault Zone and in the subduction region of the Aegeaa Plate between the Anatolian plate.

History Designed to serve the spiritual needs of northeast Bath by James Wilson and built between 1840-1845, from Bath Stone, a limestone sourced from the Limpley Stoke mine which is situated in the Limpley Stoke Valley. St Stephen's Church on Lansdown Road in Walcot cost ¬£6,000. The constructed church, however, remained unconsecrated until 1881. For the Royal School, a northeast aisle was added in 1866, thought to be designed by the Wilson & Willcox firm. The very wide apsidal chancel with the vestry and organ chamber was built by W. J. Willcox built in 1882-1883, for ¬£3,000. W. J. Willcox also designed the painted ceiling in 1886, which was executed by H. & F. Davis. The Lady Chapel's east stained glass window was completed in 1983 by local artist Mark Angus to commemorate one hundred years since the formation of the parish. 'Centenary' depicts St Stephen‚Äôs transformation on the bridge between life and death to the moment of martyrdom: 'With distorted ambiguity between pain and repose, the body rises amid red flames on a blue ground'. The Gothicised font and font cover are marble and dated 1843. The c.1900 transept ceiling and reredos are by Sir T. G. Jackson. The crypt was converted into a community centre in 1993-1994 by Slade, Smith and Winrow. In 2007 the tower stonework was restored and the church bells replaced.

See also Ricklefs received his PhD from Cornell University under the supervision of O. W. Wolters. He held positions at the School of Oriental and African Studies, All Souls College, Monash University, the Australian National University and the University of Melbourne. He retired from the professorship of Southeast Asian history at the National University of Singapore. He was emeritus professor of history at both the Australian National University and Monash University. Academic career Ricklef's publications focused on the history of Mataram, Kartasura, Yogyakarta, Surakarta (locations in Central Java). He also regularly updated his history of Indonesia, A History of Modern Indonesia, ca. 1300 to the present. He dedicated most of his academic career to understanding how Indonesian society reacted to both the European presence (in his earlier works) and the spread of Islam (in his later works), with an emphasis on cultural as well as political history. Few living English-speaking writers can claim the scope of his knowledge of the history of Java from the 17th to the 21st century. In 2010 he edited and co-authored New History of Southeast Asia, which continued the work of his friend and mentor D. G. E. Hall, who first published his own History of South East Asia in 1955. From 2004 to 2015, Ricklefs was sectional editor for Southeast Asia for the new third edition of Encyclopaedia of Islam (16 vols., now appearing in fascicules). He was a member of the editorial boards of History Today, Studia Islamika, Journal of Indonesian Islam and Journal of Southeast Asian Studies. He co-edited the monograph series Handbook of Oriental Studies/Handbuch der Orientalistik and Brill‚Äôs Southeast Asia Library (SEAL). He was a member of the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Editorial Advisory Board for the publication series, Documents on Australian Foreign Policy. Ricklefs was a former member of the Australian National Commission for UNESCO. He was a founding member of the Australian Foreign Affairs Council and also a member of the International Council of the Asia Society (New York). Observations on warfare In his book War, Culture and Economy, he observed a general pattern regarding foreign military interventions. Ricklefs noted that there is a ‚Äúsignificant link between the transfer of military technology and questions of cultural identity‚Äù but said that he was not proposing a sort of ‚ÄúRicklefs‚Äô Rule\\". He observed that in wars of intervention or invasion, where social and economic circumstances on both the local side and an intervening side with superior military (especially infantry) technology were such as to facilitate the transfer of technology, then the intervention was likely to produce a strengthening of cultural and political identities and lead to successful resistance to the foreign force. Thus, the wars of 17th and 18th century Java, with both sides pre-industrial, were unlike the colonial wars of the 19th and early 20th centuries in Asia, Africa and parts of the Americas, where the industrialized military technology of colonial invaders (machine guns, high explosives, barbed wire, etc.) often led to collapses of morale and an end to resistance on the local, pre-industrialized, side.

Honours and awards In 1989 Ricklefs was elected a fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities. The Government of Australia awarded him in 2001 the Centenary Medal for \\"service to Australian society and the humanities in the study of Indonesia\\". In 2010 he was elected as an erelid (honorary member) of the Netherlands Koninklijk Instituut voor Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde, one of only eight people currently recognised in this way. He was awarded the 2015 George McT. Kahin Prize of the Association for Asian Studies, \\"given biennially to an outstanding scholar of Southeast Asian studies from any discipline or country specialization to recognize distinguished scholarly work on Southeast Asia beyond the author's first book\\" for his work Islamisation and its opponents in Java: A political, social, cultural and religious history, c. 1930 to the present (2012). In 2016 the Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture presented Ricklefs with its cultural award (Penghargaan Kebudayaan). In June 2017, Ricklefs was made a member of the Order of Australia. Civil and human rights activity In the early 1980s Ricklefs became deeply involved in education for indigenous Australians, acting as the driving force behind and co-founding the Monash Orientation Scheme for Aborigines, the first bridging program for Aboriginal people in an Australian university. This aimed to prepare Aboriginal students, who suffered from great educational disadvantage, for university study. The scheme was a runaway success and by the time Ricklefs left Monash in 1993 it had been responsible for roughly doubling the number of Aboriginal university graduates.Davison, G . & Murphy, K. University Unlimited: The Monash Story (Melbourne 2012) 173-175 Ricklefs was also involved in the 1980s ‚Äòimmigration debate‚Äô in Australia, which was sparked when his counterpart at the University of Melbourne, Geoffrey Blainey, argued that Australia should limit Asian immigration. This came only a little over a decade after Australia had ended its controversial White Australia immigration policy. Ricklefs published, with Andrew Markus, a critique of Blainey's views entitled Surrender Australia? Essays in the Study and Uses of History (Allen and Unwin, Sydney, 1984).

Sightseeing The chief monument of the village is the romanesque church dating from the age of the √Årp√°dian kings. It was founded in the 11th century by a local landowner family for the provostry of priests. The richly carved stones refer however to royal donator of the ancient romanesque church. The western tower was erected first. The carved stones of the wall reveal that the tower was planned to stand alone and was bordered by walls on three sides. Later the fa√ßade surrounded the walls of the tower and the main western fa√ßade shows the rich sculptural and architectural details. The shape of the three-quarter circle of the eastern apse reveals that a rotunda was once standing on the other side of the recent church. A great number of Hungarian churches are characterized by this structure when the rotunda serves as the main apse of the later romanesque church. This hypothesis is confirmed by the fact that the church was surrounded by a cemetery in ancient times.

Protein A/G contains four Fc binding domains from Protein A and two from Protein G, yielding a final mass of 50,460 daltons. The binding of Protein A/G is less pH-dependent than Protein A, but otherwise has the additive properties of Protein A and G. Protein A/G binds to all subclasses of human IgG, making it useful for purifying polyclonal or monoclonal IgG antibodies whose subclasses have not been determined. In addition, it binds to IgA, IgE, IgM and (to a lesser extent) IgD. Protein A/G also binds to all subclasses of mouse IgG but does not bind mouse IgA, IgM or serum albumin.Sikkema, J.W.D. (1989) Amer. Biotech. Lab, 7, 42. This allows Protein A/G to be used for purification and detection of mouse monoclonal IgG antibodies, without interference from IgA, IgM and serum albumin. Mouse monoclonal antibodies commonly have a stronger affinity to the chimeric Protein A/G than to either Protein A or Protein G. Protein A/G also has been used for purification of macaque IgG. Other antibody binding proteins In addition to Protein A/G, other immunoglobulin-binding bacterial proteins such as Protein A, Protein G and Protein L are all commonly used to purify, immobilize or detect immunoglobulins. Each of these immunoglobulin-binding proteins has a different antibody binding profile in terms of the portion of the antibody that is recognized and the species and type of antibodies.

It was released on August 15, 2007.  Gameplay  Typical \\"Battle\\" gameplay screenshot. The board is one column longer than in the original game to allow for a more effective use of the board and remove two impossible hexagons accessed by the grid (the hexagon in the upper right and the hexagon in the lower right). Hexagons in Hexic 2 are colored red, blue, yellow, green, silver, white, and black. It is even hinted with various screenshots that new skins are available, but possibly as a power for the new multiplayer mode. Combos are still achieved by rotating the cursor in a similar manner to the previous incarnations of the game. Starflower tiles are formed in much the same way, but the black pearl tiles are a bit more challenging to form this time around. New to Hexic 2 is the \\"Battle\\" mode, where the player is pitted against the computer (or another player via Xbox Live) in a race to fill their meter bar before the other (see screenshot above). This is done by clearing pieces from the board, as well as deploying various \\"attacks\\" on the opponent. \\"Marathon,\\" \\"Timed Marathon,\\" and \\"Survival\\" also return in Hexic 2, with the new alterations for the game implemented into the Gameplay. = New pieces and features = * Emeralds ‚Äì 2 piece changer tile. Emeralds are created by forming a row or line of 5 or more same-colored pieces or circling one piece by 6 pieces with all 6 having 1 color. The resulting piece is an Emerald. Lining up 5 or more Emeralds will result in a Starflower or circling one piece by 6 Emeralds. * Rubies ‚Äì 4 piece changer tile. Rubies are created by lining up 5 or more Starflowers in a row or circling one piece by 6 Starflowers. * Black Pearls are no longer created by circling one piece by 6 Starflowers; they are now formed by lining up 5 or more Rubies in a row, or circling one piece by 6 Rubies. *Lines or Rows ‚Äì Forming a line of 5 or more pieces results in the creation of at least one of the next piece in chain of command. Color > Emerald > Starflower > Ruby > Black Pearl. The line in effect creates pieces in all positions of the original line minus the two pieces at each end (#-4). So, using an extreme example, if a line of 11 Starflowers is made (2 rows of 4, then rotate in 3 in the middle), 7 Rubies are made, and a line of 7 Rubies makes 3 Black Pearls. *Detonation ‚Äì Emeralds, Starflowers, Rubies and Black Pearls can be detonated on the player's command. The explosion causes some of the adjacent pieces to explode, making it easier to destroy \\"locked\\" pieces or clear bombs. *Chain Reactions ‚Äì If a piece that is detonated has an Emerald, Starflower, Ruby or Black Pearl next to it, the initial explosion will cause the 2nd piece to explode, which in turn blows up the pieces that are adjacent to it. In this manner, long chains of pieces can be linked together and detonated in a single massive chain reaction.  Bug and fix  The Marathon mode featured a bug in which saved games would remove the bomb threat from the boards, allowing players to play forever. On September 23, 2007, an update fixed this bug, among other minor tweaks.

Several Middle Eastern countries eventually limited their oil shipments, some embargoing only the United States and the United Kingdom, while others placed a total ban on oil exports. The Oil Embargo did not significantly decrease the amount of oil available in the United States or any affected European countries, due mainly to a lack of solidarity and uniformity in embargoing specific countries. The embargo was effectively ended on September 1 with the issuance of the Khartoum Resolution.  Oil Ministers' Conference  During the June 9‚Äì18 Oil Ministers' Conference in Baghdad, Iraq, several Arab countries issued a communiqu√©U.S. Department of State, Foreign Relations of the United States, 1964‚Äì1968, Vol. XXXIV: Energy Diplomacy and Global Issues (Washington: GPO, 1986), Document 232. that two resolutions were unanimously passed: # \\"Arab oil shall be denied to and shall not be allowed to reach directly or indirectly countries committing aggression or participating in aggression on sovereignty of any Arab state or its territories or its territorial waters, particularly the Gulf of Aqaba\\" # \\"The involvement of any country directly or indirectly in armed aggression against Arab states will make assets of its companies and nationals inside the territories of Arab countries subject to the laws of war. This includes the assets of oil companies.\\" Invitees included Egypt, Syria, Kuwait, Libya, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Bahrain, Abu Dhabi, and Qatar. Iraq sent copies of the Council resolution to the Embassies of Iran and Indonesia, and sought the support of Venezuela.  Oil Embargo  The Baghdad Resolutions were important because Egypt broadcast claims of US aircraft support on June 6. Iraq was the first country to limit its oil shipments, embargoing the United States and the United Kingdom on June 6. Iraq, Kuwait, Algeria, and Bahrain eventually embargoed the United States and the United Kingdom. Syria stopped all oil exports, rather than just embargoing specific countries, in order to avoid declaring specific nations as aggressors. The United States advocated emergency measures in OECD meetings and supported the establishment of an International Industry Advisory Board. The Advisory Board was critical in efficiently apportioning limited tanker resources and managing the distribution of the limited oil resources. This was an effective measure to negate the oil embargo as there was no consensus on what countries to embargo, and more importantly, oil shipped to a European country could then be shipped to any of the embargoed countries. Some Arab countries encouraged the oil companies to circumvent the embargo, as the Amir of Kuwait even proposed to the US ambassador that companies simply alter shipping manifests to ship oil to prohibited countries. Egypt sought to bend not only international political policy but also the policies of more moderate governments,This is substantiated in several cables from several different foreign and domestic officials, available in the FRUS volumes (cited above). and sought to export the socialist revolution to neighboring moderate (i.e. conservative) countries. The embargo resulted in public pressure on Middle Eastern leaders to support Arab solidarity. Nasser effectively limited moderate countries' political options lest they risk a revolution.This is substantiated in the June 30 briefing by DCI John McCone to President Johnson, about the danger and effectiveness of constant propaganda from Egyptian State Radio in Cairo. Available in the FRUS volumes, Vol XXXIV Doc 252 (link above).  Khartoum Resolution  The Khartoum Resolution issued on September 1 allowed the moderate oil-producing nations (Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Libya) to resume oil exports and regain this critical source of revenue without risking disquiet or even overthrow from their more radical citizens. In exchange, these countries agreed to give annual aid to \\"victims of Zionist aggression\\", namely Egypt and Jordan ($266 million and $112 million, respectively). The 1967 oil embargo was the main reason for the formation of OAPEC, which would provide a forum for the discussion of using oil politically. The organization's next embargo had a much stronger impact, triggering the oil crisis of 1973‚Äì74.

It was depopulated in May 1948. History Qatra was a Canaanite center of political and economic authority that along with 30 other urban sites in regions bordering the Mediterranean Sea, entered a period of decline in the Late Bronze Age between 1250 and 1150 BCE.Zevit, 2003, p. 94. Qatra is also tentatively identified with the Hellenistic city of Kidron (Cidron, Gedrus) mentioned in the first Book of the Maccabees (15:39, 41; 16:9), and it has been postulated that its name derives from the Hebrew name for Kidron, Qi·π≠r√¥n. Others have suggested that Qatra (Katra) is merely a corruption of the biblical Gederoth mentioned in ,Conder (1879), pp. 173‚Äì174 hence the use of the name in the Gederot Regional Council. Qatra has been named as the place of origin of a holy man named Sheikh Ahmad al-Qatrawani, who set out from the village due to his inability to fulfill his religious duties there, and settled by 'Atara, where his Mamluk shrine still stands.Taha, Hamdan.

He further noted a noria by the well, which he assumed to be ancient. By the well were also six sections of barrels of columns of gray marble, the diameter of which was thirty centimetres. The villagers told Gu√©rin they had \\"always\\" been there. Hedges of cacti surrounded the village and served as fences for figs and olive trees. There were also several \\"magnificent\\" acacias and mimosas there.Gu√©rin, 1869, pp. 35- 36 An Ottoman village list of about 1870 showed that Katra had a population of 353, in 161 houses, though the population count included men only.

Plan Dalets guidelines to the Givati Brigade gave its leader, Lt. Col. Shimon Avidan, wide discretion.

The village offered no resistance. The Givati troops entered and conducted an arms collection operation on 5‚Äì6 May. About 60 weapons were handed over - but a Jewish officer was shot and killed (either by an Arab or by friendly fire while searching (or looting) one of the houses. Three Arabs were then taken hostage and Givati demanded the name of the killer, and the handover of any foreign irregulars and additional weapons.744: ¬¥Doron\`to HIS, ¬¥The village of Qatra¬¥, 9 May 1948, HA 105‚àñ92aleph; and ¬¥Doron (Elitzur)¬¥to HIS-AD, ¬¥The Conquest of Qatra¬¥, 12 May 1948, HA 105‚àñ92aleph.

These fonts are metrically compatible with the most popular fonts on the Microsoft Windows operating system and the Microsoft Office software package (Monotype Corporation‚Äôs Arial, Arial Narrow, Times New Roman and Courier New, respectively), for which Liberation is intended as a free substitute.

Extension to other writing systems was prevented by its unique licensing terms. Since the old fonts were replaced by the Croscore equivalents, expanded Unicode coverage has become possible. History The fonts were developed by Steve Matteson of Ascender Corporation as Ascender Sans and Ascender Serif. A variant of this font family, with the addition of a monospaced font and open- source license, was licensed by Red Hat Inc. as the Liberation font family. Liberation Sans and Liberation Serif derive from Ascender Sans and Ascender Serif respectively; Liberation Mono uses base designs from Ascender Sans and Ascender Uni Duo. The fonts were developed in two stages. The first release of May 2007 was a set of fully usable fonts, but they lacked the full hinting capability. The second release, made available in the beginning of 2008, provides full hinting of the fonts. In April 2010, Oracle Corporation contributed the Liberation Sans Narrow typefaces to the project. They are metrically compatible with the popular Arial Narrow font family. With Liberation Fonts 1.06 the new typefaces were officially released.. Distribution =Version 2.00.0 or above= As of December 2018, Liberation Fonts 2.00.0 and above are a fork of the Chrome OS Fonts released under the SIL Open Font License, and all fonts are developed at GitHub. =Older versions= Red Hat licensed these fonts from Ascender Corp under the GNU General Public License with a font embedding exception, which states that documents embedding these fonts do not automatically fall under the GNU GPL. As a further exception, any distribution of the object code of the Software in a physical product must provide the right to access and modify the source code for the Software and to reinstall that modified version of the Software in object code form on the same physical product on which it was received. Thus, these fonts permit free and open-source software (FOSS) systems to have high- quality fonts that are metric-compatible with Microsoft software. The Fedora Project, as of version 9, was the first major GNU/Linux distribution to include these fonts by default and features a slightly revised versions of the Liberation fonts contributed by Ascender. These include a dotted zero and various changes made for the benefit of internationalization.Bugzilla entries for the revised Liberation fonts included in Fedora 9, Red Hat Bugzilla ‚Äì Bug ListBugzilla screenshot of the revised Liberation Mono font with dotted zero, Red Hat Bugzilla - Bug #252149 (Image) Some other GNU/Linux distributions (such as Ubuntu, OpenSUSE and Mandriva Linux) included Liberation fonts in their default installations. The open source software LibreOffice and OpenOffice.org included Liberation fonts in their installation packages for all supported operating systems. Due to licensing concerns with fonts released under a GPL license, some projects looked for alternatives to the Liberation fonts. Starting with Apache OpenOffice 3.4, Liberation Fonts were replaced with the Chrome OS Fonts ‚Äì also known as Croscore fonts: Arimo (sans), Cousine (monospace), and Tinos (serif) ‚Äì which are newer versions of the same designs but made available by Ascender Corporation under the Apache License 2.0.

He succeeded his father to the head of the Kach≈ç-no-miya household when he was only 2 years old in 1904. Prince Kach≈ç attended the Gakushuin Peers‚Äô School. He entered the 49th class of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy in 1918, graduating 1st out of 176 cadets. Prince Kuni Asaakira was one of his classmates. He served his midshipman duty on the cruiser Yakumo. In January 1922, he served for an obligatory session as a member of the House of Peers in the Diet of Japan, returning to the Imperial Japanese Navy in May of the same year as a second lieutenant. He was assigned to the battleship Mutsu. In 1923, he attended the naval artillery and torpedo schools. He then served on the cruiser Isuzu. In 1924, he was promoted to lieutenant and awarded the Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Chrysanthemum. While serving on Isuzu, he fell ill and had to be hospitalized at the naval hospital at Sasebo, where he died. On his death in 1924, the Kach≈ç-no-miya line became extinct. However, to preserve the Kach≈ç-no-miya name and to ensure that the proper familial and ancestral rites were performed, the 3rd son of Prince Fushimi Hiroyasu agreed to a reduction in status from the imperial household to the kazoku peerage, and was renamed Marquis Kach≈ç Hironobu.

These obstacles often cost the firm financially to leave the market and may prohibit it doing so. If the barriers of exit are significant; a firm may be forced to continue competing in a market, as the costs of leaving may be higher than those incurred if they continue competing in the market.  Types of exit barrier  The factors that may form a barrier to exit include: * High investment in non-transferable fixed assets. This is particularly common for manufacturing companies that invest heavily in capital equipment which is specific to one task. * High redundancy costs. If a company has a large number of employees, employees with high salaries, or contracts with employees which stipulate high redundancy payments, then the firm may face significant cost if it wishes to leave the market. * Other closure costs. Contract contingencies with suppliers or buyers and any penalty costs incurred from cutting short tenancy agreements. * Potential upturn. Firms may be influenced by the potential of an upturn in their market that may reverse their current financial situation.  Implications  As more firms are forced to stay in a market, competition increases within that market.

The uneven quality of the text is a result of the process and easily differentiates thermographic printing from engraving Thermographic printing refers to two types of printing, both of which rely on heat to create the letters or images on a sheet of paper. The simplest type of thermography is where the paper has been coated with a material that changes colour on heating. This is called thermal printing and was used in older model fax machines and is used in most shop till receipt printers. This is called direct thermal. More complex is thermal transfer printing that melts print off a ribbon and onto the sheet of paper. Thermography as raised print process Thermography is also the name of a post print process that is achieved today using traditional printing methods coupled with thermography machines. Thermography machines consist of three sections with a through conveyor. The first section applies thermographic/embossing powder, made from plastic resins, to the substrate (normally paper). The areas selected for raised printing are printed with slow-drying inks that do not contain dryers or hardeners so that they remain wet during the application of powder. This ink is dried and hardened later during the heating process. The second section of the process is a vacuum system that removes excess powder from uninked areas of the substrate.International Paper ‚Äì Thermography. glossary.ippaper.com The third section of the process conveys the product through a radiant oven where it is exposed to temperatures of 900 to 1300 degrees Fahrenheit.John McTigue (2005). THERMOGRAPHY UPDATE: THERMOGRAPHY OFFERS EXPANDED OPTIONS FOR PRINTERS WITH IMPROVED LASER-SAFE TECHNOLOGY. Worldwide Printing Thermographers Association The heating process takes on the order of 2.5 to 3 seconds. The substrate (usually paper) has a peak in IR absorption at the wavelength used. Through conduction from the paper, the powder temperature rapidly increases and starts melting. When the process is correctly adjusted, the center of the largest filmed areas reach sufficient quality level as the product exits the heater. The melted ink then solidifies as the product cools. This process is sometimes produced using manual powdering. The substrate with the wet ink is dipped into the powdered polymer. The sheet is then tilted back and forth, rolling the powder across the image. The excess powder is then removed by raising the substrate to a vertical position and lightly tapping the back side. The powdered sheet is then fed into a radiant heating system (as above) at a speed that achieves a good-quality melted film. In the case of craft applications, the powder is melted using a heatgun that blows hot air. It is commonly used on wedding invitations, letterheads, business cards, greetings cards, gift wrap, packaging, etc... It is sometimes used in diploma printing as a low-cost alternative to engraved embossing.

It was established by the FICAC Act No 11 of 2007, and began operations in April of the same year. The Constitution of the Republic of Fiji stipulates that the Commission may investigate, institute and conduct criminal proceedings, take over investigations and criminal proceedings that fall under its responsibility and functions as prescribed by law, and which may have been initiated by another person or authority and discontinue, at any stage before judgment is delivered, criminal proceedings instituted or conducted by it. FICAC is headed by a Deputy Commissioner, who is appointed by the President of Fiji. The current Deputy Commissioner is Mr Rashmi Aslam after the retirement of Mr George Langman. Mr Aslam served as the Acting Deputy Commissioner from April 2019 until his official appointment as the Deputy Commissioner in May 2020. Function  The FICAC Act No. 11 and the Prevention of Bribery Act No. 12 of 2007 gives the Commission unique powers to investigate, advise and prosecute cases involving public sector corruption. The Commission also has powers to investigate and prosecute breaches under the Crimes Act of 2009, Electoral (Registration of Voters) Act No. 54 of 2012, Political Parties Act No. 4 of 2013, and the Electoral Act of 2014. It is the primary objective of FICAC to promote the integrity and accountability of public administration and educating and enlisting public support to combat corruption. FICAC acceded to the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC) on 14 May 2008 and volunteered for a Pilot Review Program by Serbia and France in 2009. In 2012, Fiji became one of the first 28 State Parties to be reviewed on its implementation of UNCAC by Bangladesh and the United States of America in a peer review process. FACE  The Fiji Anti-Corruption and Ethics Centre was created in 2017 to provide its viewers with access to anti-corruption information and education materials. Visitors to the page can read and download annual reports, statistics, anti-corruption policies and all published work of the Commission. This online resource centre acts as an avenue for building a strong brand amongst its stakeholders and provide a platform for exchanging ideas and proposals to tackle corruption. Anti- corruption policy templates available on this page can assist organisations who have yet to develop any system of internal controls to identify and prevent corruption. The Commission acknowledges and realises that information is absolutely vital to creating a culture of empowerment and that once this is achieved, there will be more people speaking out and against corruption in the country. Reporting corruption  Anyone wishing to report suspected corrupt activity can visit the FICAC website to lodge it online.

History Brentwood Academy was among a wave of private schools formed in response the court ordered desegregation of public schools. Brentwood Academy's leaders claimed the school was established to provide a sound, Christian education in a safer environment, but the sociologist Jennifer Dyer has argued that the school's stated objectives were simply a \\"guise\\" for the school's actual objective of allowing white parents to avoid enrolling their children in racially integrated public schools. Applications to Brentwood Academy increased in 1980 after court rulings expanded desegregation busing in Nashville. At the time, only four of Brentwood Academy's 360 students were black. In 2001, Brentwood Academy was a party in the United States Supreme Court case Brentwood Academy v. Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association.Brentwood Academy v. Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Assn., 531 U.S. 288 (2001). The Academy had sued the Tennessee Secondary School Athletic Association after the school was penalized for \\"undue influence\\" in recruiting football players, and the case was appealed to the Supreme Court. The court in this case held that a statewide association, incorporated to regulate interscholastic athletic competition among public and private schools, is regarded as engaging in state action when it enforces a rule against a member school.

It is located at the western edge of the city, and is bordered to the west by the acreages and estate homes of Springbank. To the east it is bounded by 69 Street W, to the south by Bow Trail and to the north by Old Banff Coach Road, the community of Cougar Ridge and the Canada Olympic Park. The land, previously part of the East Springbank area of the Municipal District of Rocky View, was annexed to the City of Calgary in 1995 and West Springs was established in 2001. It is represented in the Calgary City Council by Ward 6 the councillor. The western extension of the neighbourhood, west of 85th Street, reaching into the aspen parkland, is called Wentworth. Demographics In the City of Calgary's 2012 municipal census, West Springs had a population of living in dwellings, a 4.8% increase from its 2011 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2012. Residents in this community had a median household income of $88,328 in 2000, and there were 9.8% low income residents living in the neighbourhood. As of 2000, 28.2% of the residents were immigrants. All buildings were single-family detached homes, and only 5.9% of the housing was used for renting. Land History The land which West Springs was established was once a 160 acre dairy farm which also housed pens of foxes raised for their furs in the 1940s. The farm was owned by Harvey & Olive Moore who moved into the area from the Indus and Langdon districts. The original farm house and dairy barn built in 1929 was located just west of 69th Street and just north of 8th Ave SW. The land was partially sold off into smaller acreage parcels in the 1970s after they retired. A 10 acre tree lined parcel stayed in the family until 1997 when it was sold when the development of West Springs began construction along the north edge of the 10 acres. In 2016 the 10 acres was developed and there is no longer any signs of the old farm. Education The Calgary Board of Education opened the West Springs Elementary School in September 2010, serving Kindergarten to Grade 4 students residing in West Springs. In January 2017, West Ridge School opened for Grade 5 through Grade 9, serving the communities of West Springs and Cougar Ridge.

He was the uncle of Empress Zhangsun, Emperor Taizong's wife, and a trusted advisor to Emperor Taizong.  Background  Gao Shilian was born in 576, in the waning years of Northern Qi, as a member of Northern Qi's imperial Gao clan. His grandfather Gao Yue (È´òÂ≤≥)Gao Shilian's grandfather's and father's names are per the Book of Northern Qi, vol. 13 . Inexplicably, however, Gao Shilian's biography in the Old Book of Tang, while getting Gao Shilian's grandfather's and father's offices and title correct, were likely erroneous as to their names, rendering Gao Shilian's grandfather's name as Â∂Ω (also pronounced Yue) and father's name as Gao Li (È´òÂãµ). See Old Book of Tang, vol. 65 . As the official history of Northern Qi, Book of Northern Qi was written much nearer to their times, the Book of Northern Qi versions of their names are generally considered the correct ones. (The New Book of Tang used Â≤≥ for Gao Shilian's grandfather's name, but also used Li for his father's name. See New Book of Tang, vol. 95 .) The Zizhi Tongjian followed the Book of Northern Qi. See Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 166. the Prince of Qinghe was a cousin of Gao Huan, the paramount general of Northern Wei and its branch successor state Eastern Wei and the father of three of Northern Qi's emperors; Gao Yue was an important official for Northern Qi until he was forced by Emperor Wenxuan to commit suicide in 555. His father Gao Mai (È´òÂã±) initially inherited the title of Prince of Qinghe, and later had his title changed to Prince of Le'an. He served as an important official under several emperors. When Northern Zhou forces launched a major attack on Northern Zhou in 576 and approached the capital Yecheng in spring 577, Gao Mai advocated resisting to the last man, but the emperor Gao Wei could not accept his suggestion and fled instead. After Gao Wei was captured by Northern Zhou forces and Northern Zhou took over Northern Qi territory, Gao Mai was made a minor official with little power. (Contrary to the fate of most Northern Qi princes, who were slaughtered by Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou late in 577, Gao Mai was not killed.) After Northern Zhou itself was overthrown by Sui Dynasty in 581, Gao Mai was made a provincial governor.  During Sui Dynasty and Xiao Xi's restoration of Liang Dynasty  Gao Shilian was known for proper conduct in his youth, and he was studied in literature and history. He became a friend of the important officials Xue Daoheng (ËñõÈÅìË°°) and Cui Zujun (Â¥îÁ•ñÊø¨), although he was much younger than they were. During the reign of Emperor Wen of Sui, Gao became a junior official at the ministry of ceremonies. Meanwhile, his younger sister married the general Zhangsun Sheng (Èï∑Â≠´Êôü), but after Zhangsun Sheng died in 609, Zhangsun Sheng's son, by a prior wife, Zhangsun Anye (Èï∑Â≠´ÂÆâÊ•≠), expelled her and her two children‚Äîa son named Zhangsun Wuji and a daughter‚Äîfrom the Zhangsun household. She took her children to Gao Shilian's household, and Gao Shilian took them in and raised the children. In 613, it was by his decision that young Lady Zhangsun, then 12, married Li Shimin, the 14-year-old son of the general Li Yuan the Duke of Tang, as he was impressed by Li Shimin. In 614, during the second campaign against Goguryeo by Emperor Wen's son Emperor Yang, the general Yang Xuangan rebelled, and one of Yang Xuangan's associates, the minister of defense Husi Zheng (ÊñõÊñØÊîø), fled to Goguryeo. As Gao was friendly with Husi, he was demoted and exiled to being the secretary general of Zhuyuan County (Êú±È≥∂, in modern northern Vietnam). As he did not want to subject his parents to the distant travel into the remote region, he left his wife Lady Xianyu to stay with his parents and went by himself. Further, in order to allow his sister to continue be able to live without him around, he sold his mansion and bought a smaller house, and then divided the remaining proceeds with his sister before departing for Zhuyuan. In 617, with almost the entire Sui territory engulfed in agrarian rebellions against Emperor Yang's rule, Xiao Xi, a descendant of Liang Dynasty's imperial line, rose as well, declaring a restoration of Liang, and soon seized the modern Hubei and Hunan region and was seeking to expand. In spring 618, Xiao sent his general Ning Changzhen (ÂØßÈï∑Áúü) south. At that time, Gao had become the legal assistant to Qiu He (‰∏òÂíå) the governor of Jiaozhi Commandery (‰∫§Ë∂æ, modern northern Vietnam). Qiu had previously rejected overtures by both Xiao and another rebel ruler, Lin Shihong the Emperor of Chu, but in light of Ning's attack was considering submitting to Xiao. Gao advised against it, arguing that Ning's forces had marched a long distance and would be fatigued, and Qiu agreed, engaging and defeating Ning. However, when news came that Emperor Yang had been killed in a coup at Jiangdu (Ê±üÈÉΩ, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu) led by the general Yuwen Huaji, Qiu submitted to Xiao.  During Emperor Gaozu's reign  Li Yuan, who established Tang Dynasty at Chang'an in 618, sent his nephew Li Xiaogong the Prince of Zhao Commandery and Li Jing to attack Liang in 621. Li Xiaogong and Li Jing were successful in capturing Xiao Xi's capital Jiangling (Ê±üÈôµ, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei) and forcing him to surrender. Thereafter, most of Liang territory submitted to Tang, and in spring 622, Qiu He sent Gao Shilian to Chang'an to show submission to Tang; Emperor Gaozu in turn sent Qiu He's sons Qiu Shili (‰∏òÂ∏´Âà©) to Jiaozhi to accept his submission. Li Shimin, who was then the Prince of Qin and a major general under his father, retained Gao to serve on his staff as part of the government for the capital prefecture Yong Prefecture (ÈõçÂ∑û), of which he was prefect. As Gao was Princess Zhangsun's uncle, Li Shimin respected and trusted him. By 626, Li Shimin was locked in an intense rivalry with his older brother Li Jiancheng the Crown Prince, and he feared that Li Jiancheng would kill him. Gao and his nephew Zhangsun Wuji both suggested Li Shimin to act first, and Li Shimin agreed. In summer 626, he laid an ambush for Li Jiancheng and another brother who supported Li Jiancheng, Li Yuanji the Prince of Qi, killing them at Xuanwu Gate. Gao participated in leading part of Li Shimin's personal guards against the guards of Li Jiancheng and Li Yuanji in the aftermaths. After Li Shimin's victory, he effectively forced Emperor Gaozu to create him crown prince. Gao was made an honored advisor to Li Shimin, and soon was made the Shizhong (‰æç‰∏≠)  the head of the examination bureau of the government (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng) and a post considered one for a chancellor. Two months later, Emperor Gaozu yielded the throne to Li Shimin (as Emperor Taizong).  During Emperor Taizong's reign  Later in 626, when Eastern Tujue's Jiali Khan Ashina Duobi launched a major incursion into Tang territory, reaching all the way to Chang'an, Gao Shilian, along with Fang Xuanling, attended to Emperor Taizong as he personally met Ashina Duobi to promise additional tributes, to induce Ashina Duobi to withdraw. In 627, Emperor Taizong created Gao the Duke of Yixing. Later in 627, there was an incident in which Gao Shilian's deputy, Wang Gui, had written a secret petition to Emperor Taizong and, per protocol, submitted it first to Gao and requested that Gao attach it to his own submission to Emperor Taizong. Gao, however, held onto Wang's petition and did not submit it, and also did not inform Wang that he did so. When Emperor Taizong found out about this, he demoted Gao to the post of commandant at An Prefecture (ÂÆâÂ∑û, roughly modern Xiaogan, Hubei). Gao was later made the secretary general of Yi Prefecture (ÁõäÂ∑û, roughly modern Chengdu, Sichuan), and as the titular commandant at Yi Prefecture was Emperor Taizong's young son Li Ke the Prince of Shu, Gao was effectively commandant. It was said that while serving at Yi Prefecture, Gao disabused the people of superstitions that led them not to attend to their parents when their parents were ill, improved irrigation, and encouraged learning. In 631, Gao was recalled to the capital to serve as the minister of civil service affairs, and was created the greater title of Duke of Xu. One of his sons was also created a lesser duke. When Emperor Gaozu died in 635, Gao was in charge of building Emperor Gaozu's tomb, and was rewarded after the projet was completed. In 637, as part of Emperor Taizong's scheme to bestow prefectures on his relatives and great generals and officials as their permanent domains, Gao's title was changed to Duke of Shen, and he was given the post of a prefectural prefect for his heirs to inherit. Soon, however, with many objections to the system, the strongest of which came from Zhangsun Wuji, Emperor Taizong cancelled the scheme, although Gao's title remained Duke of Shen. Sometime before 638, Emperor Taizong, disgusted with the traditional noble clans of Cui, Lu, Li, and Zheng and believing that they were abusing their highly honored names, commissioned Gao, Wei Ting (ÈüãÊå∫), Linghu Defen, and Cen Wenben to compile a work later to be known as the Records of Clans (Ê∞èÊóèÂøó), with the intent of dividing the clans into nine classes based on their past contributions, good deeds, and ill deeds. In an initial draft that Gao submitted, he nevertheless ranked the branch of the Cui clan that the official Cui Min'gan (Â¥îÊ∞ëÂππ) belonged to as the highest, a decision that Emperor Taizong rebuked, as he pointed out that Gao was merely again looking at tradition and not the recent contributions. He therefore personally intervened in revising the work, reducing Cui's clan to the third class. However, after the work was completed in 638, Emperor Taizong nevertheless rewarded Gao for compiling the work. In fall 638, he made Gao Pushe (ÂÉïÂ∞Ñ), a head of the important executive bureau of the government and also a post for a chancellor. In 641, when Emperor Taizong visited the eastern capital Luoyang, he left his crown prince Li Chengqian in charge of Chang'an, but had Gao serve as his assistant and effectively in charge. Later in 641, Gao and Fang drew rebuke from Emperor Taizong when they inquired of the deputy imperial architect, Dou Desu (Á´áÂæ∑Á¥†) of imperial construction projects ‚Äî which Emperor Taizong saw as an encroachment on his liberty. However, Wei pointed out that chancellors were supposed to be responsible for all affairs of state, and Emperor Taizong, realizing that he had erred, was humbled. In 643, when Emperor Taizong commissioned the Portraits at Lingyan Pavilion to commemorate the 24 great contributors to Tang rule, Gao's portrait was one commissioned. Later in 643, Gao requested to retire from the post of Pushe. Emperor Taizong agreed, but had him continue to serve as a chancellor de facto,The 643 date was per the table of chancellors in the New Book of Tang. See New Book of Tang, vol. 61 . Gao's own biography in the Old Book of Tang indicated that the date was 642. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 65. However, the 642 date was inconsistent with the chronicle of Emperor Taizong's reign in the Old Book of Tang itself. See Old Book of Tang, vol. 3. and also commissioned him and Wei Zheng to lead a project to compile notable literary works into a 1,200-volume compendium known as the Wensi Boyao (ÊñáÊÄùÂçöË¶Å). In 644, when Emperor Taizong, at an imperial gathering, stated to his key officials their strengths and weaknesses, he spoke, with regard to Gao: :Gao Shilian is well studied in both historical and current matters and has a clean heart. Even great disasters could not get him to lose his integrity. He never engaged in factionalism while in government. However, he had no fortitude to criticize and suggest to his superiors. In 645, when Emperor Taizong attacked Goguryeo and left his crown prince Li Zhi (who replaced Li Chengqian in 643 after Li Chengqian was discovered to have plotted to overthrow Emperor Taizong) in charge of logistics at Ding Prefecture (ÂÆöÂ∑û, roughly modern Baoding, Hebei), Gao was left there as well to assist Li Zh, along with Liu Ji, Ma Zhou, Zhang Xingcheng, and Gao Jifu. When Li Zhi heard and decided important matters, he set up a seat for Gao next to him, but Gao declined the honor. In spring 647, Gao was gravely ill. Emperor Taizong personally went to visit him. The next day, Gao died, and Emperor Taizong wanted to personally attend his wake, despite urgings by Fang not to, as Emperor Taizong was also himself recently ill. However, before Emperor Taizong could get to Gao's mansion, Zhangsun Wuji intercepted him and earnestly sought to stop him, lying down in the street before him to stop him. Emperor Taizong instead went up on the city walls to watch Gao's funeral procession in order to mourn. Gao was buried near the tomb of Empress Zhangsun (who died in 636), where Emperor Taizong would eventually be buried as well. By Gao's own will, no treasures were buried with him, only one set of clothes and some of Gao's own favorite books. Later, when Li Zhi became emperor after Emperor Taizong's death in 649 (as Emperor Gaozong), he ordered that Gao, along with Fang and Qutu Tong (Â±àÁ™ÅÈÄö), be worshipped at the same temple as Emperor Taizong.

Located in the major port city of Ostia, this open-air market was essential for Rome as a place of varying and exotic goods from foreign lands. Merchants gathered here to sell anything from grain and shipping services to elephants and giraffes. Rebuilt in the 2nd century AD, The Forum of Corporations was also representative of the many diverse cultures that made up the Roman Empire. Oil importers, grain importers, rope-makers, and ship builders from corporations spanning across the empire came here to benefit from Ostia‚Äôs positioning at the mouth of the Tiber River which easily facilitated the importation and transportation of goods into the empire.  Structure  The forum was enclosed by a wall made of brick surfaced with stucco and measured 100 meters by 80 meters. A total of 61 rooms, each which was 4 meters by 4 meters, opened up to the forum. The rooms were separated by a wooden partition and were arranged based on geographical origin of the merchant or business, the majority which were based in Africa. There is also a temple in the middle of the forum to Annona Augusta, the Divinity of Imperial Supplies, or Ceres Augusta. This temple served as a guild temple and reflects the role of religion in all aspect of Roman life, including business. An example of the mosaics found in the Forum of Corporations The most notable detail of the Forum of Corporations are the intricate black and white mosaics that lie in front of each shop. These mosaics indicated the professional associations of each vendor as well as inspired a sense of nostalgia for the distant homes of each of the merchants. The forum was adjacent to the theater of Ostia and people would also pass through the forum before and after performances.  Center for Guilds  The Piazzale delle Corporazioni was often the home of the offices for approximately 40 guilds. These guilds were religious associations that dealt mainly with grain trade and navigation through Ostia, which served as the main food supply source for Rome. There were six divisions of guilds: Grain Shipping and Related Services, Commerce, Transport, Trades, Civil Service, Cults (Hermansen). The guilds represented a bridge between international and domestic relations through trading, worship and banquets. Many guilds used the temple in the center of the Forum of Corporations as a meeting place where they would worship, and hold banquets and assemblies. The various perennial religious ceremonies that they celebrated were performed at the temple.  References  * Aldrete, Gregory S.

As he was born when the country was still under rule by the Tokugawa Bakufu, he was sent on 12 October 1852 into the Buddhist priesthood, and assigned to serve at the monzeki temple of Chion-in in Kyoto. On 27 October 1860, he was recalled by Emperor K≈çmei, who formally adopted him as a potential heir to the throne. However, a few months later that same year, the 14th Tokugawa Sh≈çgun, Tokugawa Iemochi, requested that a prince from the imperial family be assigned to the Tokugawa household as potential heir to the Shogunate. Prince Hirotsune was chosen for this role, but remained in Kyoto. The Meiji Restoration in 1868 eliminated the possibility that he would become Sh≈çgun, and Prince Hirotsune returned to the Imperial household. Emperor Meiji granted him permission to start a new branch of the Imperial Family, and he took the name of Kach≈ç-no-miya (from the mountain name of the temple of Chion- in). Prince Hirotsune traveled to the United States. He studied at the United States Naval Academy at Annapolis in 1870, but fell ill and returned to Japan in 1872. On 13 May 1876, he was commissioned as a rear admiral in the Imperial Japanese Navy, but he died later that year. His wife was Nambu Ikuko, daughter of Count Nambu Toshihisa, the last daimy≈ç of Morioka Domain. The couple had one son, Prince Kach≈ç Hiroatsu. Notes References * Jansen, Marius B. (2000).

The American rifle units complemented the predominant, musket-equipped, line infantry forces of the war with their long-range marksmanship capability and were typically deployed with the line infantry as forward skirmishers and flanking elements. Scouting, escort, and outpost duties were also routine. The rifle units' battle formation was not nearly as structured as that of the line infantry units, which employed short-range massed firing in ordered linear formations. The riflemen could therefore respond with more adaptability to changing battle conditions. The Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment consisted of nine companies‚Äîfour from Maryland and five from Virginia. The two-state composition of the new unit precluded it from being managed through a single state government, and it was therefore directly responsible to national authority as an Extra Continental regiment. Because most of the newly formed regiment surrendered to British and German forces at the Battle of Fort Washington on November 16, 1776, the service history of the unit's surviving element is complex. Although modern and contemporaneous accounts of the battle convey the impression that it marked the end of the regiment as a combat entity, a significant portion of the unit continued to serve actively in the Continental Army throughout most of the remainder of the war. Elements of the regiment served with George Washington's Main Army and participated in the army's major engagements of late 1776 through 1778. Select members of the regiment were also attached to Col. Daniel Morgan's elite Provisional Rifle Corps at its inception in mid-1777. The Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment was reorganized in January 1779 and was stationed at Fort Pitt, headquarters of the Continental Army's Western Department, in present-day western Pennsylvania primarily to help in the defense of frontier settlements from raids by British-allied Indian tribes. The unit was disbanded with all other Additional and Extra Continental regiments during the reorganization of the Continental Army in January 1781. It was the longest serving Continental Army rifle unit of the war. Organization Otho Holland Williams by Charles Willson Peale.

During the American Revolutionary War, the Continental Congress directed the organization of the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment in resolves dated June 17 and 27, 1776.Ford, v. 5, pp. 452, 486. The unit comprised three of the four independent Continental rifle companies that had formed in Maryland and Virginia by decree of Congress in mid-1775,Ford, v. 2, pp. 89‚Äì90. and six new companies‚Äîtwo from Maryland and four from Virginia. The three 1775 companies, among the first of the colonial units to join the newly constituted Continental Army, were raised and initially commanded by Capts. Michael Cresap, Thomas Price, and Hugh Stephenson.Balch, pp. 4‚Äì5.Wright, p. 319. The nine-company force became a regiment on the same tables of organization as the 1st Continental Regiment, which was originally the Pennsylvania Rifle Regiment.Ford, v. 5, p. 452. Unlike this Pennsylvania unit, however, the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment was an Extra Continental regiment because of its two-state composition.Wright, pp. 98‚Äì99, 319. It was not part of a state line organization but was instead directly accountable to national authority (Congress and the Continental Army). The Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment's field officers were drawn from the original three 1775 companies based on their seniority. Hugh Stephenson from Virginia became the colonel, and Marylanders Moses Rawlings of Cresap's companyHeitman, p. 459. and Otho Holland Williams of Price's company were designated the lieutenant colonel and major, respectively.Ford, v. 5, p. 486. All company officers were appointed in the summer of 1776, and subsequent recruiting for the unit in the two states extended to the end of the year.Hentz, pp. 130‚Äì133. Recruiting occurred in Frederick and Harford Counties, Maryland, and Berkeley, Frederick, Loudoun, Fauquier, Prince William, and Culpeper Counties, Virginia.Hentz, pp. 130‚Äì132. The enlisted men of the regiment served for three years or the duration of the war.Ford, v. 5, pp. 762‚Äì763. Battle of Fort Washington and surviving elements By early November 1776, the majority of the regiment's officers and enlisted men had joined Washington's Main Army while it was engaged in the battle for New York City during the New York and New Jersey campaign.Linn and Egle, series 2, v. 10, p. 106. They were initially stationed at Fort Washington on Manhattan Island and nearby Fort Lee on the opposite side of the Hudson River.Showman et al., v. 1, pp. 328‚Äì329. On November 16, most of the regiment was captured or killed during the Battle of Fort Washington.Rawlings to Washington (August 1778). The riflemen were defending the northern end of the American position from a much larger force of several thousand Hessian troops.The Historical Society of Pennsylvania (1901), pp. 259‚Äì262.Fischer, pp. 112‚Äì113. After heavy fighting that lasted most of the day and during which the Hessians suffered many casualties, the riflemen were eventually driven from the outer works into the fort where they and the rest of the outnumbered American garrison surrendered to the combined British and German attack force.Dandridge, pp. 11‚Äì19. Lieutenant Colonel Rawlings was commanding the regiment during the battle because Colonel Stephenson had died of illness in August or SeptemberWashington to Congress (September 28, 1776). and had not been replaced.With Stephenson's death, Washington recommended to Congress in late September 1776 that the colonel's position be held vacant to allow Capt. Daniel Morgan to replace Stephenson once he was released from British captivity (Washington to Congress, September 28, 1776). Morgan had been taken prisoner in December 1775 at the Battle of Quebec City during the Canadian campaign (Higginbotham, pp. 27‚Äì54). Like Stephenson, he was one of the original captains of the four independent Continental rifle companies that formed in neighboring frontier counties of Maryland and Virginia in mid-1775 (Graham, pp. 53‚Äì54; Hentz, pp. 129, 132); three of these companies composed the core element from which the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment was formed and its field officers were drawn. Washington believed Morgan to be Stephenson's appropriate successor because he was senior in rank to the regiment's two remaining field officers (Rawlings, Williams) when they entered the service. The Virginia state government, however, endorsed Morgan as the colonel of the newly formed 11th Virginia Regiment when, by Congressional mandate, the state was required to raise several new regiments in late 1776 (Wright, p. 108). Anticipating Morgan's impending exchange, Congress issued his commission as colonel of the new Virginia line infantry unit on November 12, 1776 (Graham, p. 118). Morgan took command of the regiment upon his exchange in January 1777 (Higginbotham, p. 56). The position of colonel in the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment was never refilled.

While in winter quarters at Morristown during the winter and spring of 1777,In late January or early February 1777, the effective force of the two composite companies was temporarily diminished when those members of the units who had not already had smallpox marched to Whippany, just northeast of Morristown, where they underwent inoculation (Maryland Historical Society [1910], p. 132), a process that typically lasted four to six weeks. Smallpox had seriously affected the readiness of the Continental Army earlier in the war. Therefore, starting in early 1777, Washington required smallpox inoculation of all troops who had not already suffered from, and thus had no immunity to, the virus (Washington to Shippen, January 6, 1777). the two-company force and other riflemen from Pennsylvania and Virginia Line regimentsMost of the Pennsylvanian riflemen were from the 1st Pennsylvania Regiment, originally called the Pennsylvania Rifle Regiment (Hentz, p. 136). Among the other Virginian riflemen present were members of the three-company rifle elements from each of the few Virginia line infantry regiments that were with the Main Army during most of the winter and spring of 1777 (Wright, pp. 68‚Äì70, 108, 283, 285‚Äì287). supported detached elements of line infantry units in front-line positions and conducted patrols in northern New Jersey,Hendricks to Washington (April 12, 1777). James Hendricks was at this time the lieutenant colonel of the 6th Virginia Regiment (Heitman, p. 285).Hentz, p. 136. primarily to keep the enemy's aggressive foraging activities in check. Because the two units under Captains Smith and Long provided an experienced, if small, force, Washington also used them to bolster the new 11th Virginia Regiment commanded by Col. Daniel Morgan after its arrival at Morristown in early AprilRussell and Gott, p. 171. by formally attaching them to this Virginia regiment. Washington's decision to join the two composite companies with the 11th Virginia Regiment was based on Morgan's earlier direct association with the original three independent Continental rifle companies of 1775 that formed the core element of Rawlings' regiment.Morgan built his new 11th Virginia Regiment around a cadre of officers and enlisted men from his 1775 independent Virginia rifle company (Wright, p. 108), which served alongside the other three independent Maryland and Virginia rifle companies at the Siege of Boston before it left to join Arnold's expedition to Quebec (Hentz, p. 129). He and his company were captured at the Battle of Quebec City in December 1775 and not exchanged until late 1776 and early 1777. As Washington was aware, Morgan's 1775 veterans and many of the new recruits that composed the 11th Virginia Regiment hailed from the same frontier area of northwest Virginia as many members of Long's composite company (Wright, pp. 289, 319). Moreover, a number of men in Smith's composite company came from the adjacent frontier region of western Maryland. Inasmuch as the attachment of one military unit to another was technically a temporary arrangement, however, the permanent unit of Smith's and Long's composite companies remained the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment.Hentz, p. 135. The first muster rolls of the two companies taken after the Battle of Fort Washington, both dated May 16, 1777, were compiled by the army staff as a result of the attachment process and show that the units comprised about 110 officers and enlisted men on active duty in the spring of 1777. The rolls also document that the units had lost a number of men over the winter months following the battle, primarily through desertion and a few deaths due to illness or wounds. Attachment to Morgan's Provisional Rifle Corps Daniel Morgan by Charles Willson Peale The success of these rifle units during the skirmishing period, coupled with the arrival of large numbers of new army recruits, led Washington to create additional provisional rifle companies. He placed them under the command of Daniel Morgan in early June 1777,Washington to Morgan (June 13, 1777). calling the unit the Provisional Rifle Corps, although it was most commonly known as Morgan's Rifle Corps in period documents. Morgan then simultaneously led the 11th Virginia Regiment, his permanent unit, and this provisional unit. Thirty-five officers and enlisted men in Smith's and Long's composite companies, as well as others selected from their regular musket regiments, were detached from their permanent units to form this elite regiment-sized force.Long's Provisional Rifle Co. pay roll (July 1777). The men from the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment all served in one of the Rifle Corps' eight companies, Capt. Gabriel Long's Provisional Rifle Company; with the exception of a single man, all other members of the company came from the 11th Virginia Regiment.Long's Provisional Rifle Co. pay rolls (July 1777 ‚Äì May 1778). Like Morgan, Long was now technically in command of two Continental Army units, one permanent and one provisional. Long served in the Rifle Corps until his resignation in May 1779,Hentz, pp. 137‚Äì138.Heitman, p. 356. at which time command of his company passed to Marylander Lt. Elijah Evans, also one of the original officers of the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment.Long's Provisional Rifle Co. pay rolls (April‚ÄìSeptember 1779).

The Rifle Corps is most notable for the major role it played in the Battles of Saratoga.Higginbotham, pp. 55‚Äì77. Most members of the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment, however, were not chosen for the Rifle Corps and remained with the Main Army.

His efforts met with only limited success, however, despite Washington's request to Maryland governor Thomas Johnson in late December 1777 in anticipation of Rawlings' imminent exchange \\"that the most early and vigorous measures will be adopted, not only to make [Rawlings'] Regiment more respectable, but compleat .\\"Browne (1897), v. 16, pp. 448‚Äì450. Moreover, in early October 1778 Congress permitted Rawlings and his officers to recruit outside Maryland, with each new enlistee being officially entitled to the enlistment bonus and clothing allowance of his own state's line organization.Ford, v. 12, p. 993. Implementation of this unusual ruling, however, added few men to the unit, reflecting the Continental Army's increasing difficulty in recruiting by this time of the war.Wright, pp. 125‚Äì126. The few existing recruiting records for the unit indicate that by the end of 1778, Rawlings' force of Continental regulars at Fort Frederick probably included no more than 30 to 40 new enlistees. Washington initiated more definitive measures to strengthen the regiment in early 1779. At his request,Washington to Congress (January 21, 1779). Congress authorized on January 23 the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment to be reorganized into three companies, recruited to full strength, and reassigned from Fort Frederick to Fort Pitt, headquarters of the Continental Army's Western Department.Ford, v. 13, p. 104. The reorganization, which was implemented on March 21,Washington to Rawlings (March 21, 1779). served to supplement forces engaged in the defense of frontier settlements of present-day western Pennsylvania and vicinity from Indian raids that had started in early 1777. In mid-1778, after more than a year of these attacks, largely by warriors of British-allied Iroquois tribes and Loyalist forces, Washington commenced a concerted effort to neutralize the threat to the backcountry settlements of New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia‚Äîthe war's western front.Williams, pp. 47‚Äì48, 148‚Äì289. In support of the reorganization process, on February 16, 1779, Washington ordered that all the regiment's detached members in the Main Army be reincorporated into the unit.Washington General Orders (February 16, 1779). The officer in Rawlings' regiment to whom the detached members were to be delivered (\\"Lieutenant Tauneyhill \\") is 1st Lt. Adamson Tannehill, an original member of the unit. Pursuant to Washington's order, the enlisted men in Smith's composite company who were attached to the 4th Maryland Regiment rejoined Rawlings' command.Callender and Debruler war-pension testimonies. In contrast, the Virginians of Long's composite company already had been all but formally incorporated into the 11th Virginia Regiment by order of the Virginia state government in February 1777.McIlwaine, v. 1, pp. 320‚Äì324. (Because Long's unit was a component of an Extra Continental regiment and therefore had no administrative connection to an individual state, the Virginia state government had exceeded its authority in this action, which was technically only within the purview of Congress. Washington tacitly accepted the arrangement, but the process was probably not formalized until the reorganization and redesignation of the 11th Virginia Regiment as the 7th Virginia Regiment on May 12, 1779.) Moreover, the enlisted men of Smith's and Long's companies who were still attached to the Provisional Rifle Corps, which was not part of the Main Army at this time, remained in that unit until mid-1779, at which time they left the service because their three-year enlistment periods had expired. Rawlings' force therefore now consisted of almost all Marylanders and was variously identified as the \\"Maryland Corps,\\"Kellogg (1917), p. 454.Returns of the Maryland Corps (December 25, 1780). \\"Maryland Rifle Corps,\\"Browne (1901), v. 21, pp. 339‚Äì340.Tannehill to Roberts (April 24, 1818). Adamson Tannehill signed his one-page letter supporting the war-service pension claim of John Callender, his former subordinate at Fort Pitt and fellow Pittsburgh resident: \\"Witness my hand, A. Tannehill, late Capt. in Rawlings Regt. ‚Äì commonly called the Maryd. Rifle Corps.\\" and \\"Maryland Independent Corps\\"Kellogg (1917), p. 400.Hoenstine, p. 64. during its service on the western frontier. The unit, however, remained outside the state line organization, a source of great frustration for its officers.Beall to Washington (May 7, 1779).Tannehill to Smallwood (December 25, 1780). Because no unit-redesignation orders accompanied the reorganization orders, the unit's formal name remained the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment despite significant variations from the unit's original 1776 configuration.Hentz, p. 139. Fort Pitt and the Western Department Fort Pitt during the American Revolution, located at what is now Pittsburgh, southwestern Pennsylvania After recruitment of the three companies had been no more than partially completed, Rawlings' regiment set off for Fort Pitt, arriving there in late May 1779.Brodhead to Washington (May 29, 1779). The three companies consisted of about 100 enlisted men,Johnson to Washington (April 23, 1779). well below the prescribed total of about 60 enlisted men per company in a Continental Army line infantry regiment in 1779.Ford, v. 11, pp. 538‚Äì539. Moreover, a month after its arrival, the unit lost almost half of its troop strength because the three-year enlistment periods of those men who had joined the regiment during its organization in mid-1776 had terminated. To further complicate matters, Rawlings resigned his command of the regiment on June 2,Steuart, p. 122. primarily because of his frustration over not being able to fully rebuild the unit, and did not accompany his men. He remained the commandant of Fort FrederickBrowne (1901), v. 21, p. 546. and subsequently served as Deputy Commissary of Prisoners for Maryland. Capt. Alexander Lawson Smith also did not proceed to Fort Pitt with the riflemen. He likely stayed with the 4th Maryland Regiment of the Main Army in a continued attached capacity until Congress approved his resignation from \\"the regiment formerly Rawlins \\" in September 1780.Hunt, v. 17, p. 807. The regiment was now commanded by senior captain Thomas Beall and later Capt. Adamson Tannehill, both of whom had been with the unit since its inception.Hentz, pp. 130‚Äì141. The Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment complemented the existing garrison at Fort Pitt: the 8th Pennsylvania and 9th (formerly 13th) Virginia Regiments.Brodhead to Washington ‚Äì Return of troops in the Western Department (April 17, 1779). The men of these Pennsylvania and Virginia line infantry units had been recruited from the central and western frontier counties of the two states and were assigned to the army's Western Department while at Valley Forge, reflecting a clear logic on Washington's part.Wright, pp. 265, 291. With the arrival of Rawlings' regiment, Western Department commander Col. Daniel Brodhead now led a force of largely frontier raised men experienced in Indian-style woodlands warfare. In his most notable tactical achievement, Brodhead headed a campaign of about 600 of his Continental regulars, which included the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment,Pleasants, v. 47, pp. 129‚Äì130.Dowden war-pension testimony. local militia, and volunteers to the upper waters of the Allegheny River in August and September 1779, where they destroyed the villages and crops of hostile Mingo and Munsee Indians.Hazard, series 1, v. 12, pp. 155‚Äì158. Brodhead's expedition was part of Washington's wide-ranging, coordinated offensive of the summer of 1779 that also included the larger, concurrent Sullivan Campaign led by Maj. Gen. John Sullivan and Brig. Gen. James Clinton against enemy Iroquois and Loyalist units in southern and western New York State.Williams, pp. 192‚Äì202, 238‚Äì296. From mid-1779 until late 1780, however, the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment was primarily deployed in detachments to support line infantry contingents at several of the frontier outposts in the general vicinity of Fort Pitt, including Fort Laurens,Kellogg (1916), p. 364. Fort McIntosh,Kellogg (1917), p. 309. and Fort Henry (Wheeling)Hazard, series 1, v. 12, pp. 194‚Äì195. in what is now eastern Ohio, western Pennsylvania, and northernmost West Virginia, respectively. Change in command of the regiment occurred for the third time in late 1780. Under continual pressure to maintain sufficient troop strength in the unit, regimental commander Capt. Thomas Beall ran afoul of army regulations and Western Department commander Brodhead by approving the enlistment of a British prisoner of war in February 1780. Beall tried to rectify his lapse in judgment by discharging the recruit, although after he had already been given his recruitment bounty and service clothes.Steiner (1927), v. 45, pp. 69‚Äì70. On August 14, 1780, at Fort Pitt, Captain Beall was tried by court-martial, found guilty of \\"discharging a Soldier after having been duly inlisted and receiving his regimental cloathing through private and interested views thereby defrauding the United States,\\" and on October 13, was dismissed from the service.Washington General Orders (October 13, 1780). Capt. Adamson Tannehill succeeded Beall as commander of the regiment for the remaining few months of the unit's existence. Disbanding \\"Pennsylvania\\" flintlock rifle On November 1, 1780, Washington issued orders approved by Congress that specified plans for the comprehensive reorganization of the Continental Army effective January 1, 1781.Washington General Orders (November 1, 1780). All Additional and Extra Continental regiments, such as the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment, that had not been annexed to a state line organization were disbanded by that date. The much-diminished unit comprised only 2officers and 50 enlisted men in late December 1780. The officers received discharges on January 1, 1781,Maryland Historical Society (1900), v. 18, p. 365. and the enlisted men of the unit were transferred to the Maryland Line.Washington to Brodhead (January 10, 1781). Relocation of the men from their remote post at Fort Pitt to their new assignments, however, was not completed until November 1781, at least in part because their officers were not present to supervise the process.Pleasants, v. 47, p. 547. The lineage of the regiment's Virginia elements is carried on by the 201st Field Artillery Regiment (United States).Lineage and honors certificate, 201st Field Artillery Regiment (March 12, 2003).

He showed bravery in the fights against Carthage and mercy with the Thurians. =Biography= Leptines was a brother of Dionysius the Elder, tyrant of Syracuse. He is first mentioned as commanding his brother's fleet at the Siege of Motya (397 BCE), and was for some time entrusted by Dionysius with overall command of the siege, while Dionysius was engaged in reducing the other towns still held by the Carthaginians. (Diod. xiv. 48.) Naval Battles After the fall of Motya Leptines was stationed there with a fleet of 120 ships to watch for and intercept the Carthaginian fleet under Himilco. However, Himilco eluded his vigilance and the greater part of his fleet was able to sail to Panormus (modern Palermo) in safety although Leptines did pursue them and was able to sink fifty of Himilco's transports, containing 5000 troops. (Id. 53-55.) The state of affairs was now changed: Himilco was able to advance unopposed along the north coast of the island and took and destroyed Messana (modern Messina); from where he advanced on Syracuse. Himilco's fleet, under Mago, supporting the operations of the army. Dionysius ordered Leptines to immediately advance with the Syracusan fleet to engage Mago's fleet and a great naval action ensued, in which Leptines displayed the utmost valor. However, having imprudently advanced with thirty of his best ships into the midst of the enemy, he was cut off from the rest of his fleet, and only able to escape by setting course to the open sea. The result was that the Syracusans were defeated with significant losses. Many of their ships fell into the hands of the enemy with Leptines retreating with the rest of the fleet to Syracuse. During the siege that followed, Leptines continued to render important services and commanded (together with the Lacedaemonian Pharacidas) the final attack upon the naval camp of the Carthaginians which ended in the complete destruction of the Carthaginian fleet.Diod. xiv. 59, 60, 64, 72. Actions in Italy and exile Nothing more is recorded about Leptines until 390 BC, when he was again dispatched by Dionysius with a fleet to the assistance of the Lucanians against the Italian Greeks. He arrived just as the Greeks had achieved a great victory over the Thurians. However, instead of joining them to crush their enemies, he gave refuge to the Thurian fugitives and succeeded in achieving peace between the contending parties. For this conduct, which was entirely opposite to the views of Dionysius, he was deprived of the command of the fleet, which was given to his younger brother, Thearides. (Id. xiv. 102.) Some time afterward he further offended Dionysius, by giving one of his daughters in marriage to Philistus, without any discussion with Dionysius. As a result, he was banished by Dionysius from Syracuse, together with Philistus. Leptines and Philistus moved to Thurii, where the services Leptines had rendered to that city during the recent war with the Lucanians meant that they were favorably received. Leptines quickly rose in power and influence among the Greeks of Italy to the point that Dionysius judged it prudent to recall his sentence of banishment and invite Leptines to return to Syracuse. Once Leptines returned, he was completely reinstated in Dionysius' favor and received the hand of Dionysius' daughter, Dicaeosyne, in marriage. (Diod. xv. .7; Plut. Dion. 11.) Death In 383 BC, with war having again broken out with the Carthaginians, Leptines once more took an active part in supporting his brother, and commanded the right wing of the Syracusan army in the battle near Cronium, around 375 BC. After displaying the greatest personal prowess, Leptines fell in the action and the troops under his command immediately gave way. (Diod. xv. 17.) See also *Leptines II Notes References  Diod.

The Bodleian Law Library (BLL) is an academic library in Oxford, England. It is part of Oxford University, the Bodleian Libraries and is also the library of the Faculty of Law. It is situated in part of the Grade II*-listed St Cross Building on St Cross Road in the parish of Holywell, on the corner of Manor Road. Overview The library is one of the largest open-access law libraries in Europe Opened in 1964, it now contains over 450,000 volumes on 16,000 linear metres of shelving, and is housed in purpose-built library accommodation designed by the distinguished architects Sir Leslie Martin and Colin St John Wilson. The BLL benefits from the Bodleian's status as a library of legal deposit, by which the BLL has the right to claim a copy of any printed legal material published in the United Kingdom or Ireland. Together with its position as an official Documentation Centre for the European Union and its significant expenditure on foreign legal materials, this means that the BLL adds more than 10,000 new items to its stock each year. The BLL serves a wide and expanding range of university and external readers. Its primary 'client' base is the University of Oxford's Faculty of Law which, with over 1,100 undergraduate and postgraduate students and 80 academic staff, is the largest law faculty in the United Kingdom. At the same time, and because of its legal deposit status, the BLL is also used extensively by legal firms, lawyers, and individual researchers from both home and abroad. The BLL collection supports the teaching and research of Law at the University of Oxford, and shares Criminology and Socio-Legal Studies with the Social Science Library. The St Cross Building is adjacent to the Social Science Building in Manor Road, which houses the Social Sciences departments, including the Economics Department, as well as the Social Science Library. Collection The BLL collection has been built up over a period of four centuries, both from the legal deposit intake, and from specific purchases based on recommendations from academics and researchers alike. The core primary legal materials for the UK, the Commonwealth countries, the US, the EU, individual European countries, and international law are collected on an ongoing basis, together with key legal texts for all jurisdictions. The BLL holds full sets of previous editions of major UK legal monographs on the open shelves. It receives over 2,000 serial titles per annum, including law reports, legislation, journals and looseleaf services from all the jurisdictions held in the collection. The BLL holds several special collections, including rare books, the Viner collection, the Bandar Collection of Islamic Law, and the Kahn-Freund collection of labour law material. Readers have access to all leading UK legal databases, together with a large number of foreign legal databases, supporting the research undertaken by members of the faculty. Network printing, scanning and photocopying are provided. Facilities Main Reading Room. The BLL was designed to hold the law collection of the Bodleian Library on open access shelves, ensuring ready access at all times to scholars. Seating is provided for 430 readers, with over one third of seats reserved for postgraduate student use. There is a Graduate Reading Room. This area occupies a separate wing, and provides students with ethernet access, several PCs, and wireless access for laptops. The BLL has a total of 40 PCs for reader use. The PCs in the Freshfields IT room on the lower floor and in the Gallery computer room require readers to log in, but there are a few PCs for searching the catalogue on each floor. Wireless access for laptop computers is provided throughout most areas of the library and is accessed using the same login as the library PCs. The Baker McKenzie room is available for student use for group discussion, as well as facilities which are offered on a shared basis. Legal research The Law Library staff provide an extensive teaching programme to all postgraduate and undergraduate students. The Legal Research Skills Programme is a compulsory first year subject for undergraduates; all postgraduates are provided with detailed library induction, as well as a wide range of research classes offered each term. Legal information guides to specific countries and to legal subjects is available in leaflet form.

The present education system has not changed since the re-opening of the schools in 1989, under the SLORC. After the collapse of socialist regime, the DBE updated the high schools education system that most of the study syllabus based in socialism were withdrawn and new version was introduced. Government high schools are now known as Basic Education High Schools (abbreviated BEHS), not State High Schools (SHS). The 9th Standard is regarded as the year one of the high school or Grade 10, and 10th Standard is the year two of the high school or Grade 11, where matriculation exams are held. At that time, matriculation exams covered both syllabus from the year one and the year two high school courses. Students who pass the matriculation exams are eligible to enter any universities and institutes according to their choices and total exam scores. Most teachers in Burmese schools are underpaid but some teachers seek high earnings from their private tuitions; an estimated 50 to 80% of students take private tuition classes apart from school lectures. Uniform Colour code of the high schools' uniform is white top and green bottom, although some girls' uniforms are mixed designed. From basic Primary schools to High schools, the uniform with this colour code is designed for students and teachers. Primary school student stunt with a special designed uniform in modern day Syllabus Grade 11 Students in hundreds lined in front of their boarding school in Maymyo High schools students choose one of 2 tracks upon entering high school: science or arts. Science-specialized students have six major subjects: Myanmar, English, Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics and Biology. Arts-specialized students take six major subjects: Myanmar, English, Mathematics, Geography, History and Economics. The student life in Myanmar is much oppressed non-democratic if compared to the western student cultures. Most boarding schools accept more than 500 students per year. At today's context, boarding schools are quite competitive with each other, even creating some under-table enrolling culture black economy in the education market of Burma. Examinations Students in all schools, including government schools, comprehensive schools and private boarding schools take the University Entrance Examination (), commonly referred to as the matriculation exam in English, administered by the Myanmar Board of Examinations. Students from government high schools and comprehensive schools can register for the examinations internally by the guidelines of school teachers, although students from private boarding schools have to register for the exams externally themselves. Students who attend international English-language schools or other private schools are not eligible to sit for the matriculation exam, nor are they allowed to enroll in Burmese universities. Criticism In the meantime, comprehensive schools are developed as only minority rich families can afford to enroll their children. Schools in Yangon such as TTC Yangon, Dagon-1 and Kamayut-2 are among the most well known fee paying schools. Those students who can afford boarding schools have to pay as high as 5 million kyats a year for an overall care of a student (including accommodation, health care and food). Poor students from sub-urban districts cannot afford the high education fees, and thus, critics argue Myanmar education system is most unfair. People hope there will be a fairer education system in the future so that parents will no longer need to spend extra cash to send their children to the expensive schools. Currently, a dispute rises in Myanmar education system when the government enacted against school teachers teaching private tuition.

Like many woman artists of the period, Weems often faced hostility because of her gender. However, she received support from two prominent female artists of the time: Huntington and Brenda Putnam, both of whom were working in New York.http://www.askart.com/AskART/artists/biography.aspx?artist=60876 In 1926 she won two medals: a Bronze Medal at the Philadelphia Sesquicentennial Exposition, and the George D. Widener Memorial Gold Medal from the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. In 1947 she married Carrington Weems and exhibited as Katharine Ward Lane as well as Katharine Lane Weems. She created the dolphins outside the New England Aquarium (Dolphins of the Sea, 1977), and the Lotta Fountain at the Boston Esplanade Plaza. She served as a member of the Massachusetts Arts Commission 1941-1947, and was elected to the National Association of Women Painters and Sculptors in 1925 and to the National Institute of Arts and Letters in 1952. Several of her sculptures are held at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and the Boston Athenaeum among others. Her papers are archived at Harvard University. Works at Harvard Carved brick frieze, campus of Harvard University Weems's works have an important place in many public spaces in the Boston area. Her largest project was to provide the art at Harvard University for the Biological Laboratories built in the early 1930s. Funded by a $12 million grant from the Rockefeller Foundation, the labs were state of the art. It was decided that such a lavish facility should have art that would be equally striking, and Weems was chosen to carry out a number of projects.https://www.mcb.harvard.edu/mcb/news/news- detail/3351/the-return-of-the-rhinos/ First, she made the carved bronze doors at the entrance to the labs, now the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, (MCB). Next, she executed a series of friezes showing over 30 kinds of wildlife. This involved using pneumatic drills to carve images of animals in brick at the top of the buildings. She combined realistic and Art Deco styles and relied on a large group of construction workers to carry out the project. The economics of the Great Depression made it possible to carry out this project on a grander scale than would otherwise have been the case. Wages were lower, workers plentiful, and raw materials cheaper. In preparation for this project, she studied animals at the Bronx Zoo in New York City and also Japanese and Chinese treatments of animals, especially those found on Han Dynasty tombs. She had also studied ancient Egyptian and Indian artistic presentations of animals. [Ambler, 31-33] =Rhinos= Bessie and Victoria The third part of the Biological Laboratories project proved to be the most popular: Bessie and Victoria, two rhinoceros sculptures made of bronze and weighing 3 tons each. They are displayed in the courtyard of MCB. Weems worked on these two for five years and finally had them unveiled on May 12, 1937. From 2003 to 2005, they were removed from the courtyard so as to be protected from any possible damage during the construction of Harvard's new mouse laboratory. On May 11, 2007, the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology held a birthday celebration for Bessie and Victoria. Featured speakers included E.O. Wilson, Woody Hastings and Deborah Dluhy. The two rhinos were decorated in makeup, jewelry and skirts for the festivity.https://www.mcb.harvard.edu/mcb/news/news-detail/3436/rhinos-bessie- and-victoria-celebrate-70-years/ Bibliography * Weems, Katharine Lane, Odds were against me: A Memoir, as told to Edward Weeks, New York: Vantage Press, 1985. * Ambler, Louise Todd.

As commander of the Carthaginian fleet under Himilco in the great sea-fight off Catania, Mago completely defeated the fleet of the Syracusans under Leptines, the brother of Dionysius, sinking or destroying over 100 of their ships, as well as capturing many others. (Diod. xiv. 59, 60.) There is no information as to his role in the subsequent operations against Syracuse itself. However, after the disastrous end to the Carthaginian expedition and the return of Himilco to Africa, Mago appears to have been given the chief command in Sicily, where he endeavoured, through lenient measures and conciliation towards the Greek cities and by concluding alliances with the Sicilian tribes, to re-establish the Carthaginian power on the island. In 393 BCE he advanced against Messana (modern Messina), but was attacked and defeated by Dionysius near Abacaenum, which compelled him to remain quiet for a time. The next year, however, having received powerful reinforcements from Sardinia and North Africa, he assembled an army of 80,000 men, with which he advanced through the heart of Sicily as far as the Chrysas River, but was met there by Dionysius, who having secured the alliance of Agyris, tyrant of Agyrium, succeeded in cutting off the supplies of the enemy. As a result, Dionysius reduced the Carthaginians to such a level of distress that Mago was compelled to conclude a treaty of peace, through which he abandoned his allies, the Sicilians, to the power of Dionysius. (Id. xiv. 90, 95, 96.) After this Mago returned to Carthage, where shortly after he was raised to the office of suffete, a position which he held in 383 BCE, when the ambition and intrigues of Dionysius led to the renewal of hostilities between Carthage and Syracuse. Mago landed in Sicily with a large army, and after numerous petty combats, a pitched battle took place, in which, after a severe contest, the Carthaginians were defeated and Mago was slain.Diod. xv. 15.

The term linear slide is often used interchangeably with \\"linear stage\\", though technically \\"linear slide\\" refers to a linear motion bearing, which is only a component of a linear stage. All linear stages consist of a platform and a base, joined by some form of guide or linear bearing in such a way that the platform is restricted to linear motion with respect to the base. In common usage, the term linear stage may or may not also include the mechanism by which the position of the platform is controlled relative to the base. Principle of operation In three-dimensional space, an object may either rotate about, or translate along any of three axes. Thus the object is said to have six degrees of freedom (3 rotational and 3 translational). A linear stage exhibits only one degree of freedom (translation along one axis). In other words, linear stages operate by physically restricting 3 axes of rotation and 2 axes of translation thus allowing for motion on only one translational axis. Guide types Linear stages consist of a platform that moves relative to a base. The platform and base are joined by some form of guide which restricts motion of the platform to only one dimension. A variety of different styles of guides are used, each with benefits and drawbacks making each guide type more appropriate for some applications than for others. =Rollers= ;Benefits: Inexpensive. ;Drawbacks: low load capacity, poor accuracy, short lifetime. ;Applications: Optics lab stages, drawer slides. =Recirculating ball bearing= ;Benefits: Unlimited travel, relatively inexpensive. ;Drawbacks: Low load capacity, quick to wear, oscillating positioning load as bearings recirculate. ;Applications: = Flexure = ;Benefits: Excellent accuracy, no backlash, no wear (infinite lifetime). ;Drawbacks: Short travel (limited by flexure range), low load capacity, expensive. ;Applications: Optic fiber alignment. = Cylindrical sleeve = ;Benefits: High load capacity, unlimited travel, inexpensive. ;Drawbacks: Susceptible to binding if bending moments are present. ;Applications: Radial arm saws, scanners, printers. = Dovetail = ;Benefits: Highest load capacity, unlimited travel, long lifetime, inexpensive. ;Drawbacks: High positioning force required, susceptible to binding if bending moments are present, high backlash. ;Applications: Machine shop equipment (ex. mill and lathe tables).  Position control methods  The position of the moving platform relative to the fixed base is typically controlled by a linear actuator of some form, whether manual, motorized, or hydraulic/pneumatic. The most common method is to incorporate a lead screw passing through a lead nut in the platform. The rotation of such a lead screw may be controlled either manually or by a motor. = Manual = In manual linear stages, a control knob attached to a lead screw is typically used. The knob may be indexed to indicate its angular position. The linear displacement of the stage is related to the angular displacement of the knob by the lead screw pitch. For example if the lead screw pitch is 0.5 mm then one full revolution of the knob will move the stage platform 0.5 mm relative to the stage base. If the knob has 50 index marks around its circumference, then each index division is equivalent to 0.01 mm of linear motion of the stage platform. Precision stages such as those used for optics do not use a lead screw, but instead use a fine-pitch screw or a micrometer which presses on a hardened metal pad on the stage platform. Rotating the screw or micrometer pushes the platform forward. A spring provides restoring force to keep the platform in contact with the actuator. This provides more precise motion of the stage. Stages designed to be mounted vertically use a slightly different arrangement, where the actuator is attached to the movable platform and its tip rests on a metal pad on the fixed base. This allows the weight of the platform and its load to be supported by the actuator rather than the spring. = Stepper motor = In some automated stages a stepper motor may be used in place of, or in addition to a manual knob. A stepper motor moves in fixed increments called steps. In this sense it behaves very much like an indexed knob. If the lead screw pitch is 0.5 mm and the stepper motor has 200 steps per revolution (as is common), then each revolution of the motor will result in 0.5 mm of linear motion of the stage platform, and each step will result in 0.0025 mm of linear motion. = DC motor with encoder = In other automated stages a DC motor may be used in place of a manual control knob. A DC motor does not move in fixed increments. Therefore an alternate means is required to determine stage position. A scale may be attached to the internals of the stage and an encoder used to measure the position of the stage relative to the scale and report this to the motor controller, allowing a motion controller to reliably and repeatably move the stage to set positions.  Multiple axis stage configurations  For position control in more than one direction, multiple linear stages may be used together. A \\"two-axis\\" or \\"X-Y\\" stage can be assembled from two linear stages, one mounted to the platform of the other such that the axis of motion of the second stage is perpendicular to that of the first. A two-axis stage with which many people are familiar is a microscope stage, used to position a slide under a lens. A \\"three-axis\\" or \\"X-Y-Z\\" stage is composed of three linear stages mounted to each other (often with the use of an additional angle bracket) such that the axes of motion of all stages are orthogonal. Some two-axis and three-axis stages are integrated designs rather than being assembled from separate single-axis stages. Some multiple-axis stages also include rotary or tilt elements such as rotary stages or positioning goniometers. By combining linear and rotary elements in various ways, four-axis, five-axis, and six-axis stages are also possible.

The terms rotary table or rotation stage are often used interchangeably with rotary stage. All rotary stages consist of a platform and a base, joined by some form of guide in such a way that the platform is restricted to rotation about a single axis with respect to the base. In common usage, the term rotary stage may or may not also include the mechanism by which the angular position of the platform is controlled relative to the base.  Principle of operation  In three-dimensional space, an object may either rotate about, or translate along, any of three axes. Thus, the object is said to have six degrees of freedom (3 rotational and 3 translational). A rotary stage exhibits only one degree of freedom (rotation about one axis). In other words, rotary stages operate by physically restricting 3 axes of translation and 2 axes of rotation.  Bearing types  Rotary stages consist of a platform that moves relative to a base. The platform and base are joined by some form of bearing which restricts motion of the platform to rotation about a single axis. A variety of different styles of bearings are used, each with benefits and drawbacks, making them more appropriate for some applications than for others. = Plain bearing = A plain bearing is simply two surfaces sliding against each other. Typically, a circular step on the platform mates snugly with a circular depression in the base allowing free rotation while minimizing side to side motion. A rotary stage built with this type of bearing is usually only used for coarse positioning and is adjusted manually simply by turning the platform. Index marks on either the base or the platform are often provided, allowing for somewhat repeatable positioning of the platform relative to the base. = Rolling-element bearing = This type of rotary stage includes ball bearing stages, crossed roller bearing stages, and possibly others. Any of a number of different rolling-element bearings may be employed. Typically, a pair of bearings is used and they are preloaded to take up any slack which could result in the stage platform lifting relative to the base.  Position control methods  = Manual direct = Some rotary stages are operated simply by turning the platform by hand. The platform may have index marks for setting different angular positions relative to the base. A locking mechanism may be provided to fix the platform to the base at the desired position. = Manual worm drive = For more precise position control, a worm drive may be used. A worm wheel is fixed to the rotating platform and meshes with a worm in the base. Rotation of the worm via a manual control knob causes the platform to rotate with respect to the base. Index marks on both the control knob and the platform can be used to locate the platform very precisely and repeatably with respect to the base. = Stepper motor with worm drive = Replacing the manual control knob in the above manual worm drive scenario a stepper motor allows positioning of the rotary stage to be automated. A stepper motor rotates in fixed increments or steps. The number of steps moved is controlled by the stepper motor controller. In this sense, the stepper motor behaves much like an indexed control knob. = DC motor and encoder with worm drive = A DC motor may also be used in place of a manual control knob. A DC motor does not move in fixed increments. Therefore, an alternate means is required to determine stage position. An encoder may be attached to the DC motor and used to report the angular position of the motor to the motor controller, allowing a motion controller to reliably and repeatably move the stage to set positions. = Linear actuator = When precise angular positioning over only a small total angle is required, a linear actuator (either manual, or motorized) may be used. Typically, the range of motion possible is only 10¬∞ to 20¬∞ of rotation. The linear actuator presses against a contact surface fixed to the stage platform such that extension or retraction of the actuator causes the platform to rotate. The stage platform is sprung against the actuator tip so that the contact surface stays in contact with the actuator tip when the actuator retracts.

The architecturally haphazard structure, originating as two converted barns and a Victorian house, was used from 1906 to 1929 as the studio of Lorado Taft (1860-1936), one of the most influential sculptors of the period. A National Historic Landmark, it now houses the university's visual arts department.Blanche Higgins Schroer (April 3, 1976) , National Park Service and Description and history The Lorado Taft Midway Studio is a conglomeration of structures standing on the south side of the University of Chicago campus, on the west side of South Ingleside Avenue at East 60th Street. The northern end of the structure is a two-story Victorian house, from which a series of single-story sections extend southward, joining the house to adjacent two-story barn structures, one with a gabled roof and the other with a hip roof. Historically, these elements framed a courtyard that was open to the west, except for a fringing hedge and fence; this has since been filled by additional studio space. The interior is as rambling as the exterior, much of it composed of a warren of smaller studio spaces. Lorado Taft was educated at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, receiving both a bachelor's (1879) and master's degree (1880) in art. In the 1880s he continued his studies in Paris, and returned to Chicago in 1885, joining the faculty of the Chicago Art Institute in 1886. In 1906, Taft moved his main studio from the Chicago Loop to a brick barn near the Midway Plaisance. Later, he connected a pair of frame barns to the main building to serve as male and female dormitories. The structure was redesigned by the architectural firm of Pond and Pond to contain 13 studios for Taft and affiliated sculptors. The building was designated a National Historic Landmark on December 21, 1965, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. It is one of the four Chicago Registered Historic Places from the original October 15, 1966 National Register of Historic Places list (along with Chicago Pile-1, Hull House & Robie House). On December 1, 1993, it was named a Chicago Landmark. Today, the building is home to the university's Department of Visual Arts and Creative Writing program, and has been renovated to be classrooms, offices, and studios for students and faculty.

The Manatees originally played their home games at Miami Arena; however, owner David Waronker had an out clause in the teams lease that stated that if the team's attendance average was under 1,500 after 20 of 32 homes games, the Manatees could play their home games elsewhere.Press release stating the team's departure from Miami Arena This would prove to be the case, as recorded attendance was well below the mark for most home games; one contest against the Lakeland Loggerheads drew an estimated attendance of only 250 fans. After this, Waronker wanted to move the team to Maitland, FL to play in the RDV Sportsplex, but the players shot down this idea; then the Manatees' ownership decided to play only away games. The players liked this idea even less and several left to play for other teams, mostly in the South East Hockey League while others tried to catch on with ECHL squads. With the few remaining players, the Manatees wound up playing only 48 regular-season games, but still qualified for the playoffs (see below). The play-by-play voice of the Manatees was Mark Fischel, with color analyst John Daley who was the head coach of the Jr. Manatees ice hockey program, with games carried on IRN.fm internet radio. The Manatees also received limited newspaper coverage in the Miami Herald, and nearby Ft. Lauderdale's Sun-Sentinel. Playoffs The Manatees finished the season in 5th place with 53 points in 48 games, an impressive 20 points over the 6th place Lakeland Loggerheads who played 58 games. However, after the Manatees decided to play only road games, the league changed its playoff format to allow the four best win percentages into the playoffs. This turned out to be bad news for the 4th place Orlando Seals; despite finishing with 59 points, or six more than Miami, they did it in 57 games for only a .517 winning percentage, and thus missed the playoffs. 1 - Jacksonville Barracudas (81 pts in 59 games = .686 percentage) 2 - Alabama Slammers (72 pts in 58 games = .621) 3 - Macon Trax (66 pts in 56 games = .589) 4 - Miami Manatees (53 pts in 48 games = .552) After having their roster severely depleted, the Manatees managed to win one game before losing the best-of-three playoff series with Jacksonville, thus ending their season. After 2003-2004 season Following the 2003-04 season, the WHA2 teams jumped ship to the new Southern Professional Hockey League. The Manatees were given permission to suspend operations for the season and attempt to relocate to a new venue, whether in the Miami area or somewhere else. After that, the franchise quietly folded, and there has not been minor league hockey in Miami since.

History Entrance to St. Peter's church and graveyard - now the heritage centre Balrothery is also the name of two ancient baronies in the old county of Dublin. Although largely obsolete now, these administrative units have their origins in the Norman conquest of Ireland. A single feudal barony of Balrothery was held in 1343 by Richard Costentyn for one knight's fee. It one of the seven which constituted the overlordship of Fingal dating back to 1208. It was later split into the baronies of Balrothery East and Balrothery West. Since 1994, the barony has been an integral part of the modern county of Fingal. The village and eponymous civil parish are located in Balrothery East. It is dominated by the tower of the medieval church of St Peter, which stands on the southern edge of the village. The church has now been de-consecrated and functions as the local heritage centre. Education Balrothery has one primary level national school, named after the saint Oliver Plunkett.

He later took charge of the former Zimbabwe national rugby union team, although his biggest achievement to date was taking charge of the South African national side. He coached the legendary team during the late 1980s and early 1990s. He became a national figure after Natal won their first Currie Cup in 1990, their centenary year. His success with Natal led to him coaching the Springbok side. The year before the 1995 World Cup he was sacked as national coach following a series defeat to the All Blacks in New Zealand in mid-1994.

When Timoleon had made himself master of the citadel of Syracuse after the departure of Dionysius, Hicetas, finding himself unable to cope single-handed with this new and formidable rival, called in the assistance of Mago, who appeared before Syracuse with a fleet of 150 triremes, and an army of 50,000 men. He did not, however, accomplish anything worthy of so great a force; not only were both he and Hicetas unable to make any impression on the island citadel, but while they were engaged in an expedition against Catania, Neon, the Corinthian governor of Syracuse, took advantage of their absence to make himself master of Achradina. Jealousies likewise arose between the Carthaginians and their Syracusan allies, and at length Mago, becoming apprehensive of treachery, suddenly relinquished the enterprise, and on the approach of Timoleon at the head of a very inferior force, sailed away with his whole fleet, and withdrew to Carthage.

History  An image from Vaseline company archives In 1859, Robert Chesebrough went to the oil fields in Titusville, Pennsylvania, and learned of a residue called \\"rod wax\\" that had to be periodically removed from oil rig pumps.

Since 2012, a team of French people tried to help improve hip-hop culture in Albania. They created the first Albanian hip hop festival, which took place in Tirane, Elbasan, Shkod√´r and Kor√ß√´. The second biggest rap group formed in Albania is Banda Butuesi. It was formed by 99ci, DMC a.k.a. Babloki and others from Bajram Curri, a town in northern Albania. The group which brought modern rap to Albania though, was the legendary 2Die4 which were formed by four men from Fier, Albania. Other old school famous Albanian rappers are Mr Elvis, Akrepi, Rudi, West Side Family and Vagabondi. Rap was in Kosovo during the early 1990s, where the most prominent rappers were Getoar Selimi, Unikkatil, Presioni, Ritmi Rruges, Duda, Etno Engjujt, WNC, Lyrical Son etc. Often inspired from the war against Serbia, but also helped by their melodious Nordic Albanian accent (Gege), hip hop artists from Kosovo gained a higher reputation and market sales in the Albanian-speaking territory (including Albania). Kosovo's hip hop has evolved very quickly in production and lyrics, to that point where it influences people and their way of living. Unikkatil AKA Rebeli was one of the first Albanian rap artists. he started rapping in the early 1990s, mainly against the Serbian government. The album called E-Gjeli, released in 2003 by a group called NR (urbaNRoots), was the album that made a revolution in the Albanian rap culture.  Modern hip hop labels, artists and producers Notable Kosova hip hop labels, artists and producers include: TBA (The Bloody Alboz) is the most well known and famous Kosova rap label, with their main artist being Unikkatil. Its other artists include Presioni, Tee, Cyanide, Jeton, N.A.G, B52 and Klepto. PINT (P√´r Inati Njoni Tjetrit) is another well known and famous Kosova rap label with members such as Lyrical Son, MC Kresha, NR and Nuke. BS (BABA STARS) is the most famous and important Kosova rap labels. BS members are Ghetto Geasy, Agon Amiga, Skivi, Cozman, Majk, Onat etc.. Authentic Entertainment is another famous and successful label which includes big names like Capital T and 2po2. Ham Squad is a modern Kosovan rap and was the first Kosovan label to bring rap music to the Kosovan music industry. Its members are Bloodychuck, SingullaR and Buta. T.L.A (The Loco Albas) is an Albanian/Kosova rap group that was formed in Amsterdam (The Netherlands). Their style and name are inspired by Mexican gangs. They record with their main artist (9mili) a.k.a. Real Bangz. There are a lot of Kosovan rappers who are independent or on labels that are not completely hip hop oriented, including Gjiko, Mozzik and Getinjo. E7 Albanian American Rapper OZO. Brief description of the Albanian hip hop music industry post 2010 = Centred in Kosovo = TBA (The Bloody Alboz) is one of the largest labels based in Kosovo. Some of TBA members are UnikKatil, Presioni, Jeton, Cyanide, N.A.G Tee and Buja. Their leader, UnikKatil, is the most famous, although he has been living in New York City since the end of the 1990s. His albums and songs are quite famous, especially on the Internet through social networks. Although the label has a wide support in the public, especially in Kosovo, its market share is low, with no real marketing and lack of albums by other crew members. The BABASTARS group has a huge advantage in the latter aspect. In 2015, the group comprised Ghetto Geasy, Agon Amiga, Skivi, Onat, Dr.Mic and Cozman. The group started and was founded by the two members of Tingulli 3nt, Getoar Selimi (Ghetto Geasy) and Agon Amiga, as a \\"fusion\\" with Skillz (the hip hop group formed by Ledri Vula and Visar (Skivi)). The group expanded and was quite successful, also due to the previous success of the groups involved. However, the co-operation did not always go well, as crew members came and went, as in the case of Ledri Vula, who left the label in 2012. In the meantime, Babastars have featured various and famous pop and hip hop artists in Albanian-speaking territories, like Stresi from Banda Butuesi, Mimoza Ahmeti, Tuna and Flori Mumajesi. Thus, they possess a much bigger market share than the other groups, and as often happens, this was often accompanied by video and lyrical controversy. Nonetheless, BabaStars have a bigger audience than other Kosovo labels in Albania. Another group is P.I.N.T. - Per Inat t'Njoni Tjetrit - which is known in English as 'For Each Other's Ire'. Composed of Kosovars hip hop veterans Lyrical Son, MC Kresha and BimBimma, the group differs in its approach as it tends to compile albums more than singles, and it has a high market share and audience as well. Albums like BimBimma's Rraj't (2011), Lyrical Son & MC Kresha's P.I.N.T (2013) and MC Kresha's Emceeclopedy (2014) have achieved high sales and popularity among the Kosovar audience, although higher in Kosovo. They have often released features and singles with other famous Albanian pop artists like Flori Mumajesi, Elvana Gjata, Dafina Zeqiri, DJ Blunt, Aurela Ga√ße and Blero, or hip hop groups and artists like KAOS, Noizy, Varrosi and Real 1. They are often considered as the rappers who make every song a hit. MC Kresha's 2014 album Emceeclopedy is known as an album that made a rap revolution in the 2010s of Albanian rap. Ledri Vula, previously a member of the Skillz musical group, is a popular solo artist. He is constantly present in celebrity magazines for his personal relationships. KAOS is a musical group centered in Pristina, Kosovo, composed of Lumi B and Vig Poppa.  Gjilan Hip-hop Rivalry  Two of the biggest hip-hop groups in the city of Gjilan are \\"E7\\" and \\"GG Army\\". Until 2004 there was no conflict. In 2005, during a joint concert a tragedy occurred where these two groups caused unrest in the entire city of Gjilan. The tragedy caused the two groups to fall out with one another. The two leaders were arrested, but in Gjilan the rivalry did not end. Until 2013 there were many street fights and murders but in that year the two groups made an agreement to stop the rivalry in the street. Still there are major disagreement between both \\"E7\\" and \\"GG Army\\". However, these two groups are not very active. The reason for this is because most of \\"E7\\" members are imprisoned. = Centred in Albania = In Albanian territory, the two largest labels are OTR and Banda Butuesi. The former, an abbreviation for \\"On Top of the Rest\\", was founded by Noizy, JR, Varrosi, Lil Koli, etc. The leader is Noizy, quite famous with his single career in both countries, having quite a fair share in the market and a good marketing strategy. Most of the early members have lived in London for a time, or in a few cases, they still live there. The group expanded through the late 2000s, mainly in Albania. In the overall market, including both countries, the only singer who had a wide market share was Noizy, mostly with singles or sometimes Albanian pop features like Ciljeta, Enca Haxhia, Eni Koci, etc. Gold AG is well known in all Albanian-speaking lands. He often uses nationalistic and religious themes in his songs, especially Muslim ones. He connects his religion with politics, corruption and everyday life in the new independent Kosovo, even going a little \\"against the flow\\" from his colleagues, with famously denying any type of drugs or alcohol. His favourite theme is nationalism as he represents the idea of Greater Albania. Banda Butuesi was founded by Stresi, another Albanian rapper. He was born in the city of Kukes, in Northern Albania. Although Stresi has featured with a variety of well-known Albanian pop artists, his label aims towards gangsta' hip hop. The two labels have been the source of problems in Albania and its capital Tirana, for their feud, which has quite sometimes resulted in violence between the corresponding followers and fans. Almost all of the hip hop artists in Albanian-speaking territories prefer live shows and performances in pubs and clubs throughout Albania, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, Greece, Switzerland, Sweden, USA, UK, Denmark, Austria and Germany. The biggest solo concert ever held in Kosovo and Albania was UnikKatil's. It took place on 15 July 2012 at Pristina (Kosovo) Stadium. Around 27,000 people were present. In recent years, the first female rappers became popular. These included such names as Tayna, Gjira, Rina etc. References Category:European hip hop pt:Hip hop americano sv:Amerikansk hiphop ","title":"Albanian hip hop"},{"id":"11173133","text":"In Jewish ritual law, a zav (; lit. \\"one who[se body] flows\\") is a man who has had abnormal seminal discharge from the male sexual organ, and thus entered a state of ritual impurity. A woman who has had similar abnormal discharge from her genitals is known as a zavah. Purification requirements for the zav include counting seven days without seminal discharge, immersion in a spring, and bringing certain korbanot (sacrifices). In the realm of tumah and taharah law, the zav has the ability to create a midras and is prohibited from entering specific areas of the Temple Mount.  Etymology  The Hebrew verb stem zuv (Hebrew ◊ñ◊ï÷º◊ë) in the Qal zava (◊ñ÷∏◊ë÷∏◊î) simply means to flow, as in \\"a land flowing with milk and honey\\".  Hebrew Bible  = Verses = The laws governing zav status appears in the book of Leviticus, introduced as follows: This is followed by the laws relating to a zav: the impurity laws, the purification procedure when the flow has stopped, and the sacrifices to be offered after purification (). The similar laws of a zavah appear later in the same chapter (). The commandment regarding niddah, found in the same chapter, uses the same Hebrew verb meaning \\"to flow\\", even though its laws are somewhat different from that of the zav or zavah (). In the second year after the Exodus from Egypt, when the Israelites were about to travel, they were commanded to send the zav outside the camp (). = Modern analysis = Some modern Biblical scholars see these regulations as having originally derived from taboos against contact with semen, because it is considered to house life itself, and was consequently considered sacred;Peake's commentary on the Bible the seven-day period is thought to exist to ensure that the abnormality has genuinely ceased, the sin offering is considered to have originally been made as an apology for violating the taboo.Jewish Encyclopedia article Sin Offering  In rabbinical literature  = Discussion of the physical situation = The male zav's discharge is different from that of the female zavah: the zavah emits blood, while the zav emits a whitish fluid,Mishnah, Zavim 2:1 which has a slight reddish tinge.Maimonides, commentary to Mishna Zavim 2:2 According to Maimonides, the zav state as a disease of the male reproductive system while the man's general health remains normal, causing semen to ooze out without stimulation, erection, or pleasure; and to be discolored and have a thin consistency. Based on the biblical Hebrew word ◊î◊ó◊™◊ô◊ù (lit. ‚Äúsealed‚Äù) Abraham ibn Ezra mentions that zav status can also mean complete loss of ejaculation ability.Ibn Ezra on Leviticus 15:13 Maimonides understands the same word as meaning even a minute amount of ‚ÄòZav‚Äô discharge that passes the exiting boundary of the male urinary tract.Maimonides, commentary to Mishna Zavim 1,4 Mossad HaRav Kook edition, with Rabbi Yosef Qafih commentary, note 19 = Laws = If man observes the abnormal discharge once, he becomes impure for a single day, like one who ejaculated normal semen.Mishnah Zavim 1:1 (Beit Hillel's opinion) If he observes the discharge twice, the full seven-day period of impurity is required. If he observes it three times, he is also required to bring the specified sacrifice. These observations can occur on the same day, or on consecutive days.Mishnah, Zavim, 1 Only after the week's wait and immersion would he become ritually pure once more (), but he would not be permitted to eat terumah until nightfall nor to eat the flesh of a sacrifice until after bringing his sacrifice.Mishnah Nega'im 14:3 and Obadiah ben Abraham's commentary The zav is quantified as an Av HaTumah, something able to transfer uncleanliness. In addition, his actual zav discharge, saliva, semen, and urine are also deemed to have Av HaTumah status. In regard to the transportability of tumah from the zav, the Mishnah records that if a ritually clean person and a zav both sat on an animal, or in a small boat, then the ritually clean person would become ritually unclean by doing so, regardless of how far apart they might sit. This is known as hesset (\\"minor movement\\").Mishnah, Zavim, 3-4 Regular ejaculation is treated as being distinct from zav, and is known as keri (). = Viewed as Divine punishment = Ibn Ezra notes that the Torah requirement of bringing a sin-offering upon the completion of seven clean days is an indication that the zav committed a sinful act that incurred his zav status.Ibn Ezra on Leviticus 15:13 Similarly, Hezekiah ben Manoah writes that the textual order of the zav laws near those of tzaraath and embezzlement (me'ilah), and demonstrate that zav status is incurred by lack of earnestness (to God) and sin.Chizkuni\\" on Numbers 4:6 Rabbi Shabbatai HaKohen (\\"the Shach\\") comments that zav status is a divine consequence for excessive indulgence in physical relations that take place in the laying position. Thus, as consequence, items the zav will lay upon (i.e. midras objects) will become tamei (impure) for the duration of his zav state.Sifsei Kohen to the Chumash vol. 2 p. 245  In modern Judaism  The laws of zav have little relevance nowadays, as a state of purity is only required for activities such as entering the Temple and eating terumah - activities which are not practiced nowadays. A zav would be prohibited from visiting the Temple Mount nowadays without undergoing the purification procedure.

The ship was launched in 1944, and served at the end of World War II. Recommissioned in 1951, she served in the Persian Gulf and was scrapped in 1970. Service history =World War II= Commissioned in November 1944, after sea trials and modifications Loch Fyne joined the 18th Escort Group on 22 December to support convoys on the UK-Gibraltar route. On 27 February 1945 the ship transferred to \\"Force 38\\" in the South-Western Approaches for anti-submarine patrols. On 9 April she transferred to Task Group 122.2, based at Portsmouth, to provide convoy support in the English Channel. After the German surrender in May 1945, Loch Fyne was transferred to Scapa Flow to serve with the Home Fleet supporting the re-occupation of Norway, escorting captured U-boats from Trondheim to Loch Ryan as part of \\"Operation Deadlight\\". After a refit, in September 1945 she sailed for service with the East Indies Escort Force in the Indian Ocean, repatriating former prisoners of war and internees, and was deployed for Air-Sea Rescue duties while based at Trincomalee. The ship returned to Portsmouth in April 1946 and was decommissioned. =Home Fleet, 1951-1952= Loch Fyne remained in reserve, and her pennant number was changed to F429 in 1948. Refitted in 1950, the ship was commissioned for service with the 6th Frigate Flotilla, Home Fleet, in January 1951. She sustained damage due to a premature depth charge explosion during sea trials, and so did not join the flotilla until April, to take part in the search for missing submarine . Exercises and visits occupied her until March 1952, when she was decommissioned for modernisation at Henderson's shipyard in Glasgow, and was then placed in reserve. =Persian Gulf, 1956-1963= Loch Fyne was recommissioned on 14 February 1956 for service in Persian Gulf. In May she sailed from Plymouth, arriving at Bahrain in June. Patrolling in the southern Gulf and off the coast of Oman, in July she assisted the disabled Swedish tanker MV Julius. In October she patrolled the northern Persian Gulf and joined exercises with the Iranian Navy. In January 1957 she assisted the Norwegian tanker Gilda which had run aground on the Iranian coast. In April she sailed from Aden to the Seychelles, then returned to the UK in June, via Mombasa, Freetown and Gibraltar. After a refit she returned to the Persian Gulf in December, and was deployed as a Guard ship at Shatt al-Arab during the Iranian revolution in July 1958. In December Loch Fyne and the cruiser were at Aqaba when British troops withdrew from Jordan, and she then returned to Devonport to refit. Loch Fyne returned to Bahrain in July 1959 for continuing duty in the Persian Gulf as part of the 9th Frigate Squadron, carrying out patrols and exercises. In January 1960 she sailed to Bombay for multi-national exercises in the Indian Ocean (\\"Exercise Jet\\"). She then returned to Devonport, arriving on 8 April. After a refit she returned to the 9th Frigate Squadron at Bahrain on 23 December 1960. In January 1961 she sailed to Karachi for repairs to her sonar dome after anti-submarine exercises revealed it to be defective. She then patrolled the coasts of the Trucial States, Oman, and Aden, and took part in Fleet exercises. In April 1961 she went to the assistance of the passenger ship which was on fire after an explosion, but despite the best efforts of Loch Fyne and , the ship foundered while under tow. A routine docking at Karachi in June 1961 was cancelled, and ship quickly returned to the Persian Gulf to join Task Force 317 as part of \\"Operation Vantage\\" following threats to Kuwait's independence from Iraq. She eventually sailed to Karachi at the end of July before returning to the Gulf for further patrols off Kuwait until the end of August, when an international agreement made Kuwait's security the responsibility of the Arab League. In September she sailed for the East African coast to visit Zanzibar and Mombasa, before returning to the UK on 10 November. On 19 May 1962 she sailed from Portsmouth, arriving at Bahrain on 18 June for exercises and port visits to Muscat, Abu Dhabi, Abu Musa and Tunb. In November after a routine docking at Karachi she took part in the multi-national CENTO exercise \\"Midlink V\\". The 1963 programme included the usual patrols and exercises in the southern Gulf, and visits to Dalma, Bombay, Al-Hallaniyah, Mombasa, and Tanga, before returning home in April, arriving at Devonport to decommission on 6 May 1963. Loch Fyne was laid up in reserve at Devonport, and in 1964 was placed on the Disposal List. In 1970 she was sold for scrapping.

The district had its origins in the manufacturing plans and organization of the Pullman Company, and became one of the most famous company towns in the United States, as well as the scene of the violent 1894 Pullman strike. It was built for George Pullman as a place to produce the famous Pullman sleeping cars. Originally built beyond the Chicago city limits, it is now in what is the Pullman community area of Chicago, the district includes the Pullman factory and also the Hotel Florence, named after George Pullman's daughter. Also within the district is the A. Philip Randolph Pullman Porter Museum, named for the prominent labor and civil rights leader A. Philip Randolph, which recognizes and explores African American labor history. Parts of the site, in recent decades have been owned by the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency prior to gifting them to the federal government. Additional grounds remain owned by the state, as The Pullman State Historic Site. http://www.pullman-museum.org/ The Pullman District, including the national monument, state historic site, and private homes is east of Cottage Grove Avenue, from East 103rd St. to East 115th St.. It was named a Chicago Landmark district on October 16, 1972. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 8, 1969 and declared a National Historic Landmark on December 30, 1970. Preservationists had hoped to extend the district to include Schlitz Row, but the taverns located there have been demolished. The district was named a National Monument on February 19, 2015, making it a component of the National Park System. In celebration of the 2018 Illinois Bicentennial, Pullman was selected as one of the Illinois 200 Great Places by the American Institute of Architects Illinois component (AIA Illinois) and was recognized by USA Today Travel magazine, as one of AIA Illinois' selections for Illinois 25 Must See Places. Background George Pullman was born in Brocton, New York and studied engineering. By the 1850s, Chicago was emerging as a major city, but faced sanitation issues. Pullman designed a method to raise buildings, which allowed better drainage. This innovation led Pullman to great financial success. With this new-found wealth, Pullman founded the Pullman Palace Car Company to manufacture sleeping cars in 1867. Through a focus on luxury and customer comfort, Pullman gained a large market share in the railroad car sector. The expensive cars were typically rented out to railroads with trained employees, many of whom were former house slaves recently freed by the Emancipation Proclamation. Pullman company town c. 1880 Pullman was an early advocate of employee welfare in a city that was a hotbed for labor unrest in the 1870s. When a new factory was required to meet demand, Pullman was presented with an opportunity to integrate employee betterment with manufacturing efficiency. As land values were skyrocketing in the city proper, Pullman purchased south of Chicago, between the Illinois Central Railroad line and Lake Calumet. He organized the Pullman Land Association to oversee non-manufacturing real estate and transferred all but to its control. Solon Spencer Beman was commissioned with the design of the company town buildings, including 1,300 housing units. Nathaniel Franklin Barrett was tasked with the layout and landscape design. Former Chicago superintendent of sewage Benzette Williams developed the utilities and drainage system. The project began in early 1880 and the first factory buildings were nearly completed by fall. Housing was mainly built as red brick rowhouses and featured indoor plumbing. The spacious accommodations were a significant improvement over the tenements that workers were used to. Architecture predominately evoked the Queen Anne style with Romanesque details. The town was designed with the hope that other companies would want to relocate there. However, only Pullman subsidiaries and suppliers ever shared the campus. Additional housing was built north of the factories after the Union Foundry and Allen Paper Car Company moved their operations there. Beman designed simpler, cheaper housing for these largely unskilled employees. Pullman employees, by contrast, were largely young and skilled. Rents were set to provide a 6% profit to the company over construction costs. By 1883, the population of the community reached 8,000. The community was diverse: by 1885, less than half of the employees were American-born, but African Americans were not allowed to live on the premises. Women were employed by the Pullman Company to sew. Pullman Strike The City of Chicago annexed Pullman in 1889, though the Land Association maintained control of town management. The town was not the success that George Pullman envisioned; profits from rent never reached the six percent intended. Pullman was a popular attraction during the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition, as visitors came to see the unusual town advertised in the Transportation Building. However, the Panic of 1893 began that year, devastating the railroad industry. Demand for sleeping cars plummeted, so to maintain a profitable enterprise, Pullman lowered wages for employees. Rents, automatically deducted from paychecks, were not decreased. Striking workers outside the Arcade Building Meanwhile, the American Railway Union (ARU), led by Eugene V. Debs, formed in Chicago on June 20, 1893. Membership grew to 150,000, including many of the white workers of Pullman. Pullman employees attempted to use the union to leverage support for wage increases, but their pleas were ignored. On May 11, 1894, employees went on strike. Pullman leadership, however, had put itself in a financial position to withstand a short-term work stoppage as the nation recovered from the financial panic. To combat this, the ARU launched a boycott on Pullman, where ARU would refuse to run trains with the cars. The extensive use of Pullman cars across the country further crippled the railroad industry and stymied rail traffic. The twenty-four Chicago railroads represented by the General Managers' Association rallied together against the boycott. They used strikebreakers to replace striking workers and convinced lines to run Pullman cars with their mail cars. If strikers shut down lines with mail cars, the federal government would have to intervene as it threatened interstate commerce. Indeed, lines were closed and the government found the boycott in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. Thousands of U.S. Marshals and Army troops were deployed to Chicago to break the boycott. Fights between the workers and the military left dozens dead or injured. After ARU leaders, including Debs, were jailed, the strike and boycott were quelled. Some workers that renounced the union were allowed to return to work. Although the public was generally opposed to the boycott, the strike also tarnished the Pullman brand. Pullman died in 1897 and had his grave sealed in a block of concrete and steel to prevent desecration of his body. =Aftermath= The Pullman Strike changed the American labor landscape. It was an example of the power a union could have against an industry, but it also affirmed the right of the government to intervene against strikes, particularly after the Supreme Court upheld the actions in in re Debs (1895). The Illinois Supreme Court forced the Pullman Company to sell its non-industrial holdings in 1898 and residents were given the first option on purchasing their houses. Most of the land was sold off by 1907. Under second president Robert Todd Lincoln, Pullman cars were converted to all-steel construction. This required a $5 million investment in remodeling the shops. Despite a brief labor strike in 1904, the Pullman Company restored its place as a leading railcar provider. However, the town never recovered its identity as a company town as employees moved to newer neighborhoods nearby. Agreement with Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters A. Phillip Randolph Pullman Porter Museum Unionization of African American workers began in 1925, when the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters was founded by A. Philip Randolph in New York City. Forty-four percent of the Pullman workforce was porters, making Pullman the nation's largest employer of African Americans. A landmark agreement was reached between the two parties in 1937, becoming the first major labor agreement between a company and an African American union. The NAACP lauded the contract and recognized it as an important step in increasing and improving the \\"respect, recognition and influence, and economic advance\\" of African Americans. Competition and the end of rail The decline of rail usage in favor of cars and aviation led to the decline of the Pullman Company. After a major downsizing in the 1940s, the Pullman Company was largely closed by 1957. It officially ceased operations in 1969. The south wing of the factory and the erecting shops were later used by several steel companies. Landmarks =Administration and factory complex= The manufacturing center of Pullman, the Administration and Factory Complex were unusually ornate industrial buildings. They were designed to sit in a park-like setting, overlooking the artificial Lake Vista, which was a cooling reservoir for the Corliss steam engine. The buildings, several hundred feet long, were well-lit and ventilated. The main facade, mirrored in the lake, faced the Illinois Central tracks, and thus was one of the first buildings a visitor would see. Beman designed the structures with a linear manufacturing process in mind, making the factory an early adapter of the assembly line. In the feature animation film The Polar Express (2004), which references several pieces of railroad history, the look of buildings on the square at the North Pole were inspired by Pullman Factory. =Hotel Florence= Hotel Florence in 1977 Hotel Florence, named for Pullman's daughter, was opened on November 1, 1881. Intended to showcase the town to visitors, the hotel featured fifty rooms and the only bar in the community. Built at a cost of $130,000, it grew to after an addition was constructed in 1914. A suite was kept for Pullman on the second floor for when he visited the factory. Each floor presented a different class of service, with the most opulent rooms on the second floor and more modest accommodations on the fourth. It recently completed an extensive rehabilitation, mainly of its first floor and basement. The annex has not been rehabilitated and is closed. Preservation and rehabilitation A proposal in 1960 to demolish the community in favor of a new industrial park galvanized residents to form the Pullman Civic Organization (PCO) to support its preservation. On October 8, 1969, the remaining neighborhood was recognized by the National Park Service (NPS) with a listing on the National Register of Historic Places. The next year, it was recognized as a National Historic Landmark District, a site deemed to have \\"exceptional value to the nation.\\" The southern portion was locally recognized as a Chicago Landmark on October 16, 1972. A second Chicago Landmark, for the northern portion, was created in 1993, then merged into the other landmark in 1999. The PCO provided grants to help residents restore their houses, and a non-profit called the Historic Pullman Foundation purchased several key buildings for rehabilitation in the 1970s. The State of Illinois purchased Hotel Florence and the Administration and Factory Complex in 1991 and incorporated it into a state historic site through the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency. However, a 1998 arson destroyed much of the latter building before it could open to visitors. It is now in the process of reconstruction. President Barack Obama designated Pullman as a National Monument, thus a component of the NPS, on February 19, 2015. It became the first unit of the NPS in Chicago. In 2015, the National Parks Conservation Association and the Chicago Chapter of the American Institute of Architects published a report on development for the park. In 2017, the National Park Service approved a plan to restore the clock tower building and turn it into a visitors center. The plan also calls for reconstructing the main gateway between the factory and housing areas. However it will first be necessary to remove toxic soil from the site. The soil was contaminated by waste materials when the factory was in use. Interpretive programs Pullman National Monument partners with the non-profit 501(c)(3) American Passenger Rail Heritage Foundation to provide on-board educational programs for train passengers on the South Shore Line. On select Saturdays, Interpretive Guides with the APRHF Rail Rangers ride roundtrip between Millennium Station and South Bend Airport station to provide narration about the park and the other sites passengers see outside their window.

It flies the F-16CJ fighter aircraft. It was activated in 1948, but derives significant elements of its history from the predecessor Second World War 52d Fighter Group, which is now the 52d Operations Group, subordinate to the wing. The wing provides United States Air Forces in Europe - Air Forces Africa and/or the NATO Supreme Allied Commander Europe with mission-ready personnel and systems. The assigned F-16 aircraft can be tasked to suppress enemy air defenses, provide close air support, carry out air interdiction, counter-air, strategic attack, and combat search and rescue. The wing also supports contingencies and operations other than war as required. In concert with USAFE wings at Ramstein Air Base, Germany, the 52d Fighter Wing directly supports the strategic mobility mission once conducted at Rhein-Main Air Base, Germany. The wing provides logistics support for C-17 Globemaster III and C-5 Galaxy aircraft, crew, passengers and cargo to sustain air mobility operations throughout Europe, Africa and Southwest Asia. The 52d Fighter Wing also supports USAFE's Joint Fires Center of Excellence, whose mission is to conduct joint and combined training focused on the effective integration and application of tactical fires. Subordinate organizations The wing is authorized for about 5,560 active-duty members and about 210 Department of Defense civilians.

Established as the 52d Fighter Wing, All Weather, on 10 May 1948, the wing served in the United States as an air defense unit in the northeastern United States from 1947 until the end of 1968.Maurer, p. 114. The 52d was reactivated on 18 August 1955 and designated 52d Fighter Group (Air Defense). It was assigned to Air Defense Command and equipped with North American F-86 Sabre aircraft. It served once more as an air defense unit in the southeastern United States. In December 1971, it became the host wing at Spangdahlem Air Base, Germany, and inherited tactical squadrons from the 36th Tactical Fighter Wing at nearby Bitburg Air Base. The wing participated in numerous tactical exercises, operations, and tests of USAFE and NATO and provided close air support, interdiction, and base defense operations. It operated with other NATO forces in frequent \\"squadron exchange\\" programs and hosted US-based units on temporary duty in Europe. In January 1973, a Wild Weasel defense suppression mission was added. After October 1985, using the F-4 Phantom II model aircraft, defense suppression became the wing's sole tactical mission. In 1987, the 52d acquired F-16 Falcons and became the first wing to integrate F-16Cs with F-4Gs to form hunter/killer teams within individual fighter squadrons. It deployed aircraft and personnel to strategic locations in Saudi Arabia and Turkey in support of the liberation of Kuwait from September 1990 ‚Äì March 1993. Near the end of 1992, it began receiving A-10 Thunderbolt II aircraft. It received F-15 Eagles in 1994 but lost its F-4Gs. In January and December 1999, the wing supported Operations Northern Watch, Allied Force, and Decisive Forge with numerous deployments to Italy and Turkey. =Twenty-first century= Following the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and The Pentagon in the United States on September 11, 2001, the 52d Fighter Wing began preparations for possible combat tasking. Within one month the wing had deployed people and equipment in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in and around Afghanistan. The 22d Expeditionary Fighter Squadron began flying operations at a deployed location in support of the war on terrorism within 100 hours of tasking notification. Personnel assigned to the 52d FW continued to deploy for Operation Enduring Freedom circa 2020. In April 2010 the wing's strength was reduced by one third. Twenty F-16Cs were flown to the 148th Fighter Wing, Minnesota Air National Guard, one F-16 was transferred to Edwards Air Force Base, California. All aircraft were from the 22d Fighter Squadron. As a result of the drawdown of F-16s, the 22d and 23d Fighter Squadrons were inactivated on 13 August 2010 and formed a single \\"new\\" squadron, the 480th Fighter Squadron. On 18 June 2013, the 81st Fighter Squadron was inactivated at Spangdahlem Air Force Base in Germany. The inactivation marked the end of A-10 operations in Europe at that time. In December 2014, the wing commander, Col. Peter Bilodeau, who had commanded the wing for six months, was relieved of his command for \\"a loss of faith and confidence in his leadership.\\" His deputy served as commander until Col. McFall took command. On 1 April 2017, the 606th Air Control Squadron, Detachment 1 was inactivated at Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany following the relocation to Aviano Air Base, Italy. =Lineage= * Established as 52d Fighter Wing, All Weather, on 10 May 1948 : Activated on 9 June 1948 : Redesignated 52d Fighter-All Weather Wing on 20 January 1950 : Redesignated 52d Fighter-Interceptor Wing on 1 May 1951 : Inactivated on 6 February 1952, personnel and subordinate units assigned to 4709th Air Defense Wing. * Redesignated 52d Fighter Wing (Air Defense), and activated, on 11 April 1963 : Organized on 1 July 1963 : Inactivated on 30 September 1968 * Redesignated 52d Tactical Fighter Wing on 12 November 1971 : Activated on 31 December 1971 : Redesignated: 52d Fighter Wing on 1 October 1991. =Assignments= * First Air Force, 9 June 1948 : Attached to Eastern Air Defense Force, 10 November 1949 ‚Äì 31 August 1950 * Eastern Air Defense Force, 1 September 1950 ‚Äì 6 February 1952 * Air Defense Command, 11 April 1963 * New York Air Defense Sector, 1 July 1963 * 21st Air Division, 1 April 1966 * 35th Air Division, 1 December 1967 ‚Äì 30 September 1968 * Seventeenth Air Force, 31 December 1971 * 65th Air Division, 1 June 1985 * Seventeenth Air Force, 30 June 1991 * Third Air Force, 31 July 1996 * United States Air Forces in Europe, 1 November 2005 * Air Command Europe, 18 November 2005 * Third Air Force (Air Forces Europe), 1 December 2006 ‚àí present =Components= Wing * 84th Fighter Wing (All Weather): attached 1 June 1949 ‚Äì 2 June 1951 Group * 52d Fighter (later, 52d Operations): 9 June 1948 ‚Äì 6 February 1952; 31 March 1992 ‚Äì present Squadrons * 2d Fighter-Interceptor Squadron: 1 July 1963 ‚Äì 30 September 1968 * 22d Fighter Squadron: 1 April 1994 ‚Äì 13 August 2010 * 23d Fighter Squadron: 31 December 1971 ‚Äì 13 August 2010 (detached 17 January ‚Äì 15 March 1991) * 39th Tactical Electronic Warfare Squadron: 31 December 1971 ‚Äì 1 January 1973 * 58th Tactical Fighter Squadron: attached 8‚Äì22 August 1975 * 81st Tactical Fighter (later, 81st Fighter): 15 January 1973 ‚Äì 18 June 2013 * 98th Fighter- Interceptor Squadron: 1 July 1963 ‚Äì 30 September 1968 * 105th Fighter- Interceptor: attached 1 April 1951 ‚Äì 6 February 1952 * 334th Tactical Fighter Squadron: attached 9‚Äì23 September 1975 * 335th Tactical Fighter Squadron: attached 11‚Äì25 July 1975 * 336th Tactical Fighter Squadron: attached 29 August ‚Äì 20 September 1976 * 457th Tactical Fighter Squadron: attached 13‚Äì27 August 1977 * 480th Tactical Fighter (later, 480th Fighter): 15 November 1976 ‚Äì 31 March 1992; 13 August 2010 ‚Äì present * 562d Tactical Fighter Squadron: attached 12‚Äì30 August 1977 * 606th Air Control Squadron: 30 Sept 1995 - 1 April 2017 =Stations= * Mitchel Field (later, Air Force Base), New York, 9 June 1948 * McGuire Air Force Base, New Jersey, 4 October 1949 ‚Äì 6 February 1952 * Suffolk County Air Force Base, New York, 1 July 1963 ‚Äì 30 September 1968 * Spangdahlem Air Base, Germany, 31 December 1971 ‚Äì present Aircraft operated *P/F-51 Mustang (1947‚Äì1948) *F-82 Twin Mustang (1948‚Äì1952) *F-94 Starfire (1950‚Äì1952) * F-47 Thunderbolt (1951‚Äì1952) *F-101 Voodoo (1963‚Äì1968) *B-66 Destroyer (1971‚Äì1972) *F-4 Phantom II (1971‚Äì1994) *B-57 Canberra, 1974,1975 *A-7 Corsair II (1976) *F-105 Thunderchief (1976‚Äì1977) *F-15 Eagle (1994‚Äì1999) *F-16 Fighting Falcon (1987‚Äìpresent) *A-10 Thunderbolt II (1992‚Äì2013) See also References =Notes= =Citations= =Bibliography= * Ivie, Tom and Paul Ludwig.

Aggry beads are also called Koli, Cori, Kor, Segi, Accori, or Ekeur. They are often used for medicinal purposes, as it is believed that they have magical powers. Beads were used for exchange and as a means of payment during trade in Africa. Europeans first collected aggry beads from the West Coast of Africa in the fifteenth century. Their origin is obscure. Depending on different sources, beads labelled such may be made from glass, coral, or stone, and were typically blue. It is possible that the original Aggry beads came from the Phoenicians, who used it as a means of trading along the coasts of Europa, Asia and Africa.

Though no formal title for the poem is given in the text, the chapter title refers to \\"A Long Tale\\" and the Mouse introduces it by saying, \\"Mine is a long and sad tale!\\" As well as the contribution of typography to illustrate the intended pun in this title, artists later made the intention clear as well. Translators of the story also encountered difficulty in conveying the meaning there, part of which was not recognised until well over a century later. Content The printed version of \\"The Mouse's Tale\\", p.36 in the 1865 edition of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland The original manuscript of Alice's Adventures Under Ground, 1863 During the course of the story's third chapter, a Mouse offers to tell Alice his history. \\"Mine is a long and a sad tale!\\" he begins, making Alice think that it means its tail, so that she pictures its recitation in the form of a twisted, tail-like shape. In the tale, the Mouse (speaking of itself in the third person) explains how a cur called Fury proposes the pastime of condemning it to death, himself serving as both judge and jury. \\"The Mouse's Tale\\" thus anticipates the nonsense trial at the end of the novel: > \\"Fury said to a mouse, that he met in the house, 'Let us both go to law: I > will prosecute you - Come, I'll take no denial; We must have a trial: For > really this morning I've nothing to do.' Said the mouse to the cur, 'Such a > trial, dear Sir, with no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.' 'I'll > be judge, I'll be jury,' Said cunning old Fury: 'I'll try the whole cause, > and condemn you to death.'\\" Although the Mouse claims that the \\"tale\\" will explain why he hates cats and dogs, the only villain in the printed poem is a dog; there is no actual explanation for the Mouse's animosity toward cats. However, Alice's Adventures Under Ground, the 1863 handwritten version of Alice in Wonderland, contains a different poem at this point (beginning, \\"We lived beneath the mat,/ Warm and snug and fat./ But one woe & that/ Was the cat!\\") which includes both cats and dogs as the enemies of the mice. Form The poem foreshadows the 20th century calligramme in form, being not only in the shape of a tail but, in its handwritten version, allowing the final words to be inscribed upside-down. It has been variously described as shaped, patterned,University of Michigan figured or emblematic verse,Alyssa Caswell Mimbs, ‚ÄúEpic Alice: Lewis Carroll and the Homeric Tradition‚Äù, Appalachian State University 2012, pp.61-2 in the tradition of such shaping that was later identified as the ancestor of concrete poetry. Carroll had control of the poem's layout in the original edition and it was he who stipulated that the font size should diminish as the poem progressed. Another commentator has explained that in this way ‚Äúthe poem works as a pictogram or concrete poem, in that its actual shape mimics an aspect of its subject matter. A tale told by a mouse is reproduced in the form of a mouse‚Äôs tail.‚ÄùJohn Strachan, Poetry, Edinburgh University 2011, pp.24-5 The verbal relationship between the homonyms tale/tail was later made more explicit by some of the book's illustrators. Thus Willy Pog√°ny juxtaposed the poem and a drawing of a mouse on the same page in a 1929 edition. And in Lisbeth Zwerger‚Äôs 1999 illustration the statement \\"Mine is a long and sad tale\\" is written along the Mouse's tail to make the same point.University of Michigan exhibition A student discovery in 1991 that the poem functioned as a \\"quadruple pun\\" was later widely reported. As well as the verbal play on tale/tail in the printed text, there were also visual puns in its original handwritten form. By reducing the poem there to its traditional stanza form, the first two are shaped like a mouse's body, with short dashes to indicate its paws, while a third longer line forms the tail. Furthermore, the technical term for the rhyme at the end is tail-rhyme. For the most part, the poem's page layout is so arranged that the rhyming words occur internally rather than at the end of lines. The rhyme right at the end is therefore truly made the tail-rhyme. Interpretation Interpretations of the poem's function divide between finding a serious explanation of its playfulness, or else a more deeply hidden purpose. The former approach sees it as disrupting adult systems of logic, in line with the satire on the justice system in the trial at the end, the realisation of the futility of which finally awakens Alice.Richard Kelly, \\"Introduction\\" to Alice‚Äôs Adventures in Wonderland, 2nd edition, New York: Broadview Literary Texts, pp.1-50 Another critic finds in it a summation of the plot of Aeschylus‚Äô Oresteia. This too centred upon incompatibilities between different conceptions of justice, or between justice and equity.Fernando J.

The distance between the right and left rectus abdominis muscles is created by the stretching of the linea alba, a connective collagen sheath created by the aponeurosis insertions of the transverse abdominis, internal oblique, and external oblique. This condition has no associated morbidity or mortality. Diastasis of the rectus abdominis muscle most frequently occurs in newborns and pregnant women; however, it may occur in any adult woman or man. In the newborn, the rectus abdominis is not fully developed and may not be sealed together at midline. Diastasis recti is more common in premature newborns. In pregnant or postpartum women, the condition is caused by the stretching of the rectus abdominis by the growing uterus. It is more common in multiparous women (women who have had multiple pregnancies) owing to repeated episodes of stretching. When the defect occurs during pregnancy, the uterus can sometimes be seen bulging through the abdominal wall beneath the skin. Non-pregnant women are more susceptible to develop diastasis recti when over the age of 35 or with high birth weight of child, multiple birth pregnancy, or multiple pregnancies. Additional causes can be attributed to excessive abdominal exercises after the first trimester of pregnancy. Strength training of all the core muscles, including the abdominis recti muscle, may or may not reduce the size of the gap in pregnant or postpartum women. Crunches may increase the diastasis recti separation. All corrective exercises should be in the form of pulling in the abdominal muscles rather than pushing them outwards. In extreme cases, diastasis recti is corrected with a cosmetic surgery procedure known as an abdominoplasty by creating a plication or folding of the linea alba and suturing together, which results in a tighter abdominal wall. Characteristics A diastasis recti may appear as a ridge running down the midline of the abdomen, anywhere from the xiphoid process to the umbilicus. It becomes more prominent with straining and may disappear when the abdominal muscles are relaxed. The medial borders of the right and left halves of the muscle may be palpated during contraction of the rectus abdominis. The condition can be diagnosed by physical exam, and must be differentiated from an epigastric hernia or incisional hernia, if the patient has had abdominal surgery. Hernias may be ruled out using ultrasound. In infants, they typically result from a minor defect of the linea alba between the rectus abdominis muscles. This allows tissue from inside the abdomen to herniate anteriorly. On infants, this may manifest as an apparent 'bubble' under the skin of the belly between the umbilicus and xiphisternum (bottom of the breastbone). Examination is performed with the subject lying on the back, knees bent at 90¬∞ with feet flat, head slightly lifted placing chin on chest. With muscles tense, the examiner then places fingers in the ridge that is presented. Measurement of the width of separation is determined by the number of fingertips that can fit within the space between the left and right rectus abdominis muscles. Separation consisting of a width of 2 fingertips (approximately 1 1/2 centimeters) or more is the determining factor for diagnosing diastasis recti. Diagnosis Abdominal ultrasound of diastasis recti, being the distance between the green crosses. *Diastasis recti can be diagnosed by physical examination, which may include measuring the distance between the rectus abdominis muscles at rest and during contraction at several levels along the linea alba. Topic 100494 Version 5.0 *Abdominal ultrasonography provides objective evidence for the diagnosis, and also confirms that the bulge is not a hernia. *An abdominal CT scan is an acceptable alternative to an ultrasound. Treatment *During pregnancy - No treatment is necessary for women while they are still pregnant. *After delivery - Typically the separation of the abdominal muscles will lessen in the mother within the first 8 weeks after childbirth; however, the connective tissue remains stretched for many. The weakening of the musculature may also cause lower back pain, weakened pelvic alignment, and altered posture. *In children - Complications include development of an umbilical or ventral hernia, which is rare and can be corrected with surgery. If an infant with the condition develops vomiting, or redness or pain in the abdominal area, medical attention should be sought. =Strength training= A systematic review of the evidence found that exercise may or may not reduce the size of the gap in pregnant or postpartum women. The authors looked at 8 studies totaling 336 women and concluded: ‚ÄúDue to the low number and quality of included articles, there is insufficient evidence to recommend that exercise may help to prevent or reduce DRAM,‚Äù also stating that \\"non-specific exercise may or may not help to prevent or reduce DRAM during the ante- and postnatal periods.\\" However, in a study conducted by the Columbia University Program in Physical Therapy stated: \\"Ninety percent of non‚Äêexercising pregnant women exhibited DRA while only 12.5% of exercising women had the condition. The mean DRA located 4.5 cm above the umbilicus was 9.6 mm (¬± 6.6) for the exercise group and 38.9 mm (¬± 17.8) for the non‚Äêexercise group. The mean DRA located at the umbilicus was 11.4 mm (¬± 3.82) for the exercise group and 59.5 mm (¬± 23.6) for the non‚Äêexercise group. The mean DRA located 4.5 cm below the umbilicus was 8.2 mm (¬± 7.4) for the exercise group and 60.4 (¬± 29.0) for the non‚Äêexercise group.\\" Nevertheless, the following exercises are often recommended to help build abdominal strength, which may or may not help reduce the size of diastasis recti *Core contraction ‚Äì In a seated position, place both hands on abdominal muscles. Take small controlled breaths. Slowly contract the abdominal muscles, pulling them straight back towards the spine. Hold the contraction for 30 seconds, while maintaining the controlled breathing. Complete 10 repetitions. *Seated squeeze - Again in a seated position, place one hand above the belly button, and the other below the belly button. With controlled breaths, with a mid-way starting point, pull the abdominals back toward the spine, hold for 2 seconds and return to the mid-way point. Complete 100 repetitions. *Head lift ‚Äì In a lying down position, knees bent at 90¬∞ angle, feet flat, slowly lift the head, chin toward your chest, (concentrate on isolation of the abdominals to prevent hip-flexors from being engaged), slowly contract abdominals toward floor, hold for two seconds, lower head to starting position for 2 seconds. Complete 10 repetitions. *Upright push-up ‚Äì A stand-up push-up against the wall, with feet together arms-length away from wall, place hands flat against the wall, contract abdominal muscles toward spine, lean body towards wall, with elbows bent downward close to body, pull abdominal muscles in further, with controlled breathing. Release muscles as you push back to starting position. Complete 20 repetitions. *Squat against the wall ‚Äì Also known as a seated squat, stand with back against the wall, feet out in front of body, slowly lower body to a seated position so knees are bent at a 90¬∞ angle, contracting abs toward spine as you raise body back to standing position. Optionally, this exercise can also be done using an exercise ball placed against the wall and the lower back. Complete 20 repetitions. *Squat with squeeze ‚Äì A variation to the \\"squat against the wall\\" is to place a small resistance ball between the knees, and squeeze the ball while lowering the body to the seated position. Complete 20 repetitions. Incorrect exercises, including crunches, can increase the diastasis recti separation. All corrective exercises should be in the form of pulling in the abdominal muscles rather than pushing them outwards. Consultation of a professional physiotherapist is recommended for correct exercise routines. Furthermore, in a review of treatment methods for Diastasis recti abdominis, besides strengthening exercises there are other option to treat DRA by postural training, education and training for proper lifting mechanisms, manual therapy which includes soft tissue mobilization, myofacisal release, Noble technique i.e manual approximation of abdominal muscles during partial sit up and abdominal bracing and taping. Other techniques to strengthen abdominal muscles are using Pilaties and functional training. In addition to the above exercises, the Touro College study concluded the \\"quadruped\\" position yielded the most effective results. A quadruped position is defined as \\"a human whose body weight is supported by both arms as well as both legs\\". In this position, the subject would start with a flat back, then slowly tilt the head down, and round the spine, contracting the abdominal muscles towards the spine, holding this position for 5 seconds, then releasing back to starting position. Complete two sets of 10 repetitions. =Surgery= In extreme cases, diastasis recti is corrected with a cosmetic surgery procedure known as an abdominoplasty by creating a plication or folding of the linea alba and suturing together. This creates a tighter abdominal wall. There are two surgical methods, one through Plication method which is plication of the anterior rectus sheath is most commonly use to repair DRMA and other Hernia repair considering suture closure of hernia sac combined with mesh reinforcement, There were two studies showing few post - operative complications.

Villamizar came to prominence as the lead member of the band Bacilos. Bacilos released their album Madera in 1999, and in 2000 they recorded their first album with Warner Music, which was nominated for a Latin Grammy award for Best New Artist. Caraluna (2002) was released and won a Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album, and Villamizar was awarded a Latin Grammy for Best Tropical Song for the second single \\"Mi Primer Mill√≥n\\". The album Sin Verg√ºenza won a Latin Grammy and the track\\"Pasos de Gigante\\" became the band's only top ten single in the Billboard Top Latin Songs, which peaked at number eight. Bacilos disbanded in 2007 and Villamizar made his debut solo album in 2008. Villamizar has written and co-written songs with Marc Anthony, Obie Berm√∫dez, Julieta Venegas, El Burro y Esteban and Paulina Rubio. He has lived in Miami since 1992.  About Jorge Villamizar As one of today's most unusual and prepared artists and musicians, Jorge Villamizar is a household name across the Americas and the Caribbean. The 6-time Grammy winning singer-songwriter is the true definition of success and perseverance as a solo artist and as the front man of the legendary group, Bacilos. Jorge Villamizar was born in Monter√≠a, Colombia and was raised in Ecuador. His mother taught him how to play the guitar and to appreciate an eclectic array of music that ranged from The Beatles to Andean folk music. These childhood influences, paired with the experiences that he would go on to live as a young man, shaped him into the dangerously creative and talented musician he is today. At 19, after spending one year serving in the Colombian Navy, Jorge moved to London, England looking to flourish artistically in the immense musical scene. He found himself deeply rooted to Latin music and for the next two years Villamizar would make it as a \\"Busker\\" (street performer), making the streets, markets and nightclubs his stage. London was a pivotal time for the young singer-songwriter; it was the place where he fell in love for the first time and where he composed one of the biggest songs in his career, \\"Tabaco y Chanel\\" (Tobacco and Chanel). Looking to internationalize his music, Jorge moved to Miami in the 90's, a true music metropolis still to date. While finishing his studies at the University of Miami, the artist teamed up with the Puerto Rican, Jose Javier Freire and Brazilian, Andr√© L√≥pez to form the group, Bacilos. Stemming from the overwhelming popularity in their hometown, Bacilos quickly became a staple in Latin music on an international level. Their first album, \\"Bacilos\\" (2000) delivered the hit song \\"Tabaco y Chanel\\" and two Latin Grammy nominations. The band's sophomore production, \\"Caraluna\\" (2002) delivered the hits \\"Caraluna\\" and \\"Primer Mill√≥n\\", two Latin Grammy award and one Grammy Award, among other recognitions. Continuing their successful run, the third album, \\"Sinverg√ºenza\\" (2004) delivered the hit \\"Pasos de Gigante\\" and the band's fourth career Grammy award‚Äô it was truly a remarkable run. Bacilos dismantled at the peak of their success after 12 years, and their last performance at the 2007 \\"Vi√±a Del Mar\\" music festival was memorable and emotional. As a burgeoning songwriter, Villamizar wrote songs for Alejandra Guzman (Algo Natural) and Marc Anthony (Vivir). As an established and sought-after composer, he's collaborated with Julieta Venegas, Descemer Bueno, Isaac Delgado, and Mane De La Parra, and composed emblematic hits such as- Paulina Rubio (Alma En Libertad) and Luis Enrique (Yo No Se Ma√±ana) with which he won the Latin Grammy award for \\"Best Tropical Song\\" in 2009. One year after Bacilo's breakup, Jorge Villamizar emerges as a solo artist, ready to continue the musical legacy he had created. Since then, he's release the albums \\"Jorge Villamizar\\" (2008), produced by Richard Blair; \\"Alex Jorge Lena\\" (2011), a special project in which Villamizar collaborated with colleagues Lena Burke and Alex Ubago; and his most recently released, \\"El Dia Que Vuelva\\" (2015), produced by Sergio George. The album contains various collaborations with artists such as Oscar de Le√≥n and is in fact a collection of songs written during the Bacilos era. The album delivered the No. 1 hit single \\"Dificil\\" and gained Villamizar the chance to win his seventh career Grammy award, which he plans to take home this November in Las Vegas. The artist is currently acting as a coach on Ecuador's edition of the highly popular talent competition, \\"The Voice.\\" Jorge is also set to release a new single in November. He also continues to compose for known, and sometimes unknown, artists. With the same passion as when he landed in London, Jorge Villamizar continues to perform, bringing his happy ad energetic beats to all of Latin America, the US and the Caribbean.  Current Projects  His new single featuring Elvis Crespo, Maluma, and J.D.B. \\"Te Vivi\\" combines the infectious rhythms of the Caribbean, Andean, and urban music. The music video was filmed in La Comuna 13 in Medellin, Colombia, a community that has overcome many difficulties and thrive with the promotion of culture, music and dance. The location and the people featured in the music video are truly representative of the liveliness and colour of Latin America. The Colombian artist currently resides in Miami, Florida, and is part of several social work organizations like WildAid and Musicians On Call .  The Group Bacilos  The group Bacilos was signed by Warner Music, under which they produced and released the albums Bacilos (2000,) Caraluna (2002,) and Sin Verguenza (2004.) Among their biggest hits are \\"Tabaco and Chanel\\", \\"Caraluna\\", \\"Mi Primer Millon\\", \\"Pasos de Gigante\\", among others. In 2007 they performed their last show at the Festival of Vi√±a del Mar. Nevertheless, the end of Bacilos marked a new stage in the career of Jorge Villamizar as a solo artist. His first solo project entitled \\"Jorge Villamizar\\" is a collection of autobiographical songs that reflect the bohemian life and encouraging nature of the Colombian singer. In 2010 he won his sixth Grammy for the hit \\"Estar Contigo\\" with Lena Burke and Alex Ubago, who pooled their talents to collaborate in a record production.  Awards  Bacilos won a Grammy in 2002 for Best Latin Pop Album (for \\"Caraluna\\"). They won three Latin Grammys: Best Pop album in 2005 (for \\"Sin Verg√ºenza\\") and Best Pop Album in 2003 (for \\"Caraluna\\") as well as Best Tropical song in 2003 (for \\"Mi Primer Millon\\" which came from the album Caraluna).

(1235‚Äì1319) was an Italian Dominican theologian. He was an early pupil of Thomas Aquinas. His Tractatus de bono communi of 1302 is a significant work of political thought.Between 1290 and 1320, the Dominican Remigio de' Girolami preached in Florence and composed the influential De bono communi during a struggle that pitted the Black Guelfs against the White Guelfs and Ghibellines. In the treatise, he emphasized that one must prefer public good to personal benefit. Remigio was able to adapt the political thought of Aquinas, which emphasized monarchy, to the communal regimes of Italy. Two of his works, the Divisio scientie and Contra falsos ecclesie professores, discuss music. He thought the church represented all human sciences, including the musical sciences that formed part of the quadrivium. The musical element (modulatio) of these sciences referred to liturgical chants, preaching, and church order.

There are two types of incorporated municipalities in Maine, towns and cities. The tables in the New England Historical U.S. Census Totals series differentiate between towns and cities; however, there have never been any cities in Oxford County. Most areas of New England are entirely divided into incorporated municipalities, with no unincorporated territory. In the three northern New England states, however, some unincorporated territory does exist, generally in areas that are very sparsely populated. Maine contains significantly more unincorporated territory than the other states, with the bulk of it in interior and northern counties, including Oxford County. Some unincorporated territory in Maine is organized into a third type of town-level municipality unique to Maine, called a plantation (considered to be ‚Äúorganized‚Äù, but not incorporated), while some is entirely unorganized. Due to the large extent of unincorporated territory in Oxford County, separate sections with detailed historical census totals for such areas follow the main tables below. For any census, adding up the totals for each town-level municipality, including any plantations or unorganized entities, should yield the county total.

This consisted of 83 residents in organized plantations, and 655 residents in unorganized territory. Plantations As of 1900, Oxford County contained three plantations: Lincoln, Magalloway and Milton. Milton, originally formed from a gore, surrendered its organization and reverted to unorganized territory in 1944. Lincoln and Magalloway, which are both in the northern part of the county, still exist today. Lincoln Plantation is not to be confused with the unrelated town of Lincoln, in Penobscot County. Because plantations are organized at the county level, they are allowed to duplicate the names of incorporated towns. 1900 *Milton 202 *Magalloway 77 *Lincoln 73 1910 *Lincoln 307 *Milton 204 *Magalloway 97 1920 *Milton 148 *Magalloway 86 *Lincoln 80 1930 *Milton 111 *Lincoln 90 *Magalloway 83 1940 *Milton 127 *Lincoln 89 *Magalloway 84 1950 *Magalloway 83 *Lincoln 71 1960 *Lincoln 99 *Magalloway 50 1970 *Magalloway 75 *Lincoln 60 1980 *Magalloway 79 *Lincoln 50 1990 *Magalloway 45 *Lincoln 38 2000 *Lincoln 46 *Magalloway 37 Unorganized Territory Like all of Maine's interior counties, Oxford County contains a significant amount of unorganized territory. Most of it is in the northern part of the county, in areas which are very sparsely populated: *The entire area of the county north of Upton, Grafton, Newry and Andover has never been incorporated. Lincoln Plantation and Magalloway Plantation, which lie directly north of Upton along the New Hampshire border, are the only areas in this region which have even been formally organized into plantations. The rest of the area is for the most part quite remote, and has never had any significant population on more than a transitory basis. Most of it is divided among ten unorganized townships. There is also a cluster of three gore-like entities just to the northwest of Andover. *The central part of the county has historically been almost entirely incorporated, but there is one area that has never been‚ÄîRiley Township, which lies in between Grafton and Gilead, along the New Hampshire line. In addition, while Grafton was once an incorporated town, it disincorporated in 1919 and reverted to the status of an unorganized township. *The southern part of the county was also historically almost entirely divided into incorporated towns, but there are a few gore-sized areas that were never incorporated. One gore was eventually organized as Milton Plantation, though it never incorporated as a town. Another is Batchelders Grant, which lies along the New Hampshire line in between Gilead and Stow. Batchelders Grant was once larger and has had portions included in the formation of or annexed by adjacent towns on a number of occasions over the years, but the portion that remains has never been incorporated. There was also once a Fryeburg Academy Grant in the vicinity of Batchelders Grant. After gradually losing territory to adjacent towns, it completely ceased to exist in 1913, when its remaining territory was annexed by the town of Mason. Between 1935 and 1945, a large number of municipalities in Maine dissolved and reverted to unorganized townships. In Oxford County, this included two towns (Albany and Mason) and one plantation (Milton), all in the southern part of the county. The areas of Oxford County that are entirely unorganized cover about , with a population of about 650 people. This covers about 30% of the county‚Äôs land area, but includes only about 1.2% of its population. The bulk of this population appears to live in areas that were formerly organized municipalities. Albany had nearly 300 residents at the time it disincorporated, and it appears to have maintained a population level of some significance down to the present time. Albany Township and Milton Township each currently maintain a registrar and clerk, although they do not have true organized municipal governments. Over the years, the U.S. Census Bureau has used different methods to compile data compilation for unorganized territory in Maine. From 1900 to 1950, data was tabulated for each individual unorganized entity. In 1960, a single catch-all ‚ÄúUnorganized Territory‚Äù listing was provided for each Maine County, generally with no further breakdown. Since 1970, the Census has grouped contiguous areas in each county into one or more ‚Äúunorganized territories‚Äù. Three such areas are recognized within Oxford County: *North Oxford Unorganized Territory: includes the areas in the northern part of the county which have never been organized, as well as the former town of Grafton, and Riley Township. *South Oxford Unorganized Territory: includes Batchelders Grant, and the former towns of Albany and Mason. *Milton Unorganized Territory: includes the former Milton Plantation. (Milton is its own unorganized territory because it does not border any other unorganized territory.) The listings below provide population figures for 1) all unincorporated territory, including plantations; 2) organized plantations, for which breakouts are available in the main tables above; and 3) unorganized territory, with any available breakouts provided. 1900 All unincorporated territory 623 Organized plantations 352 Unorganized territory 271 *Batchelders Grant 173 *Andover North & West Surplus 22 *Richardsontown Twp.

The rows of townships on this grid are numbered east to west, with the first three rows within the modern borders of Franklin County, and rows 4 and 5 in Oxford County, ending at the New Hampshire border. Magalloway Plantation and Richardsontown Twp. are in range 1 of the grid, with range numbers increasing as one goes north. To the immediate south of the above grid, there were originally a series of lettered townships, starting with \\"A\\" at the New Hampshire border and continuing eastward into Franklin County, to at least \\"E\\". \\"A\\" (two ranges, Grafton and Riley townships), \\"B\\" (Upton) and \\"C\\" are within the modern borders of Oxford County. Notes 1960 Census The Census Bureau made a number of revisions to 1960 census totals subsequent to their initial release. When it did so, however, it appears to have updated municipal totals only, not overall county totals or state totals, even though in most cases changing municipal totals should have caused county and state totals to change. The 1960 total for Oxford County was originally reported as 44,345; and for the town of Stoneham, 18. The total for Stoneham was later revised to that shown in the list above (182; the original total would seem likely to have been a typo). This should have caused the county total to change as well (to 44,509), but subsequent census publications have continued to list the county total as it was originally reported (44,345). As a result, in the list above, the municipal totals for 1960 do not add to the county total. The 1960 state total for Maine that appears in various Census materials (969,265) likewise reflects the original 1960 total for Oxford County, and does not take into account the revision made to the population of Stoneham.

After five years of recognizing the best in design writing by authors under 40 in the United States, the competition was discontinued in 2011. The Polling Place Photo Project was a nationwide experiment in citizen journalism to capture democracy in action: an archive of photographs taken by citizens at polling places on election days.

Your Magic Is Real. is an album released by YACHT on Marriage Records in 2007. To promote the album, frontman Jona Bechtolt performed a live show on a yacht. Background While he recorded I Believe in You. Your Magic Is Real., Jona Bechtolt was also working with Khaela Maricich in the band The Blow. I Believe in You. Your Magic Is Real. is his third solo album. The album is the first by YACHT to feature appearances from musician Claire L. Evans, who would become a full member of the band following its release. The album was recorded between 2004 and 2006. Style In general, the album is underscored with themes of positivity and magic. One exception to this trend is \\"It's Coming to Get You\\", which, according to Bechtolt, was inspired by a negative personal experience. That song explores karma; Bechtolt has stated that he \\"wanted to focus on it being okay for bad things to happen to people if those are things that are coming back and biting them in the ass\\". He sang the lyrics over upbeat \\"dance\\" instrumentation to make the track more accessible. Reception I Believe in You. Your Magic Is Real. received mixed reviews from critics. In a review for Allmusic, Jason Lymangrover discusses the distinction between the album and Jona Bechtolt's primary project at the time, The Blow. Lymangrover added that the unprofessional vocals gave the album an endearing whimsical nature, while sparse arrangements provided an experimental background. Lymangrover deemed the album an interesting side project, but not distinct enough from The Blow's work to be outstanding. Rob Mitchum, reviewing for Pitchfork Media, called the album a step forward from Bechtolt's previous solo albums. He praised the album's charisma and childishness. Mitchum concluded that \\"YACHT may not be the innovative and distinctive force that Max Tundra proved himself to be, but as a willing disciple, he's wise enough to harvest in Tundra's fertile territory\\".

In the medieval tradition of Indian scholarship, it was assumed that both texts were written by the same person. Modern philologists were sceptical of this claim, owing to an argument that dated the grammar to a date subsequent to the poetry. Since the 1990s, however, scholars have agreed that both works may indeed have been contemporary, in which case it is plausible that there was only one Bhartrihari who wrote both texts. Both the grammar and the poetic works had an enormous influence in their respective fields. The grammar in particular, takes a holistic view of language, countering the compositionality position of the Mimamsakas and others. According to Aithihyamala, he is also credited with some other texts like Harikƒ´tika and Amarushathaka. The poetry constitute short verses, collected into three centuries of about a hundred poems each. Each century deals with a different rasa or aesthetic mood; on the whole his poetic work has been very highly regarded both within the tradition and by modern scholarship. The name Bhartrihari is also sometimes associated with Bhartrihari traya Shataka, the legendary king of Ujjaini in the 1st century. Date and identity The account of the Chinese traveller Yi-Jing indicates that Bhartrihari's grammar was known by 670 CE, and that he may have been Buddhist, which the poet was not. Based on this, scholarly opinion had formerly attributed the grammar to a separate author of the same name from the 7th century CE. However, other evidence indicates a much earlier date: A period of 450‚Äì500 \\"definitely not later than 425‚Äì450\\", or, following Erich Frauwallner, 450‚Äì510 or perhaps 400 CE or even earlier.. Detailed discussion, see also notes on p. 366. Yi-Jing's other claim, that Bhartrihari was a Buddhist, does not seem to hold; his philosophical position is widely held to be an offshoot of the Vyakaran or grammarian school, closely allied to the realism of the Naiyayikas and distinctly opposed to Buddhist positions like Dignaga, who are closer to phenomenalism. It is also opposed to other mImAMsakas like Kumarila Bhatta. Bhartrihari may have been \\"within the fold of VedƒÅnta\\". However, some of his ideas subsequently influenced some Buddhist schools, which may have led Yi-Jing to surmise that he may have been Buddhist. Thus, on the whole it seems likely that the traditional Sanskritist view, that the poet of the ≈öatakatraya is the same as the grammarian Bhart·πõhari, may be accepted. The leading Sanskrit scholar Ingalls (1968) submitted that \\"I see no reason why he should not have written poems as well as grammar and metaphysics\\", like Dharmakirti, Shankaracharya, and many others. Yi Jing himself appeared to think they were the same person, as he wrote that (the grammarian) Bhart·πõhari, author of the Vakyapadiya, was renowned for his vacillation between Buddhist monkhood and a life of pleasure, and for having written verses on the subject.Miller, Foreword and Introduction VƒÅkyapadƒ´ya Bhartrihari's views on language build on that of earlier grammarians such as Patanjali, but were quite radical. A key element of his conception of language is the notion of spho·π≠a ‚Äì a term that may be based on an ancient grammarian, Spho·π≠ƒÅyana, referred by PƒÅ·πáini,Panini 6.1.123. The 10-century Haradatta assumed that Spho·π≠ƒÅyana was the author of the spho·π≠a theory. now lost. In his Mahabhashya, Patanjali (2nd century BCE) uses the term spho·π≠a to denote the sound of language, the universal, while the actual sound (dhvani) may be long or short, or vary in other ways. This distinction may be thought to be similar to that of the present notion of phoneme. Bhatrihari however, applies the term sphota to each element of the utterance, var·πáa the letter or syllable, pada the word, and vƒÅkya the sentence. To create the linguistic invariant, he argues that these must be treated as separate wholes (var·πáaspho·π≠a, padaspho·π≠a and vƒÅkyaspho·π≠a respectively). For example, the same speech sound or var·πáa may have different properties in different word contexts (e.g. assimilation), so that the sound cannot be discerned until the whole word is heard. Further, Bhartrihari argues for a sentence-holistic view of meaning, saying that the meaning of an utterance is known only after the entire sentence (vƒÅkyaspho·π≠a) has been received, and it is not composed from the individual atomic elements or linguistic units which may change their interpretation based on later elements in the utterance. Further, words are understood only in the context of the sentence whose meaning as a whole is known. His argument for this was based on language acquisition, e.g. consider a child observing the exchange below: :elder adult (uttama-v·πõddha \\"full- grown\\"): says \\"bring the horse\\" :younger adult (madhyama-v·πõddha \\"half-grown\\"): reacts by bringing the horse The child observing this may now learn that the unit \\"horse\\" refers to the animal. Unless the child knew the sentence meaning a priori, it would be difficult for him to infer the meaning of novel words. Thus, we grasp the sentence meaning as a whole, and reach words as parts of the sentence, and word meanings as parts of the sentence meaning through \\"analysis, synthesis and abstraction\\" (apoddhƒÅra). The spho·π≠a theory was influential, but it was opposed by many others. Later Mimamsakas like Kumarila Bhatta (c. 650 CE) strongly rejected the vƒÅkyaspho·π≠a view, and argued for the denotative power of each word, arguing for the composition of meanings (abhihitƒÅnvaya). The Prabhakara school (c. 670) among Mimamsakas however took a less atomistic position, arguing that word meanings exist, but are determined by context (anvitƒÅbhidhƒÅna). In a section of the chapter on Relation Bhartrhari discusses the liar paradox and identifies a hidden parameter which turns an unproblematic situation in daily life into a stubborn paradox. In addition, Bhartrhari discusses here a paradox that has been called \\"Bhartrhari's paradox\\" by Hans and Radhika Herzberger.Herzberger, Hans and Radhika Herzberger (1981). \\"Bhartrhari's Paradox\\" Journal of Indian Philosophy 9: 1-17 (slightly revised version of \\"Bhartrhari's Paradox\\" in Studies in Indian Philosophy. A memorial volume in honour of pandit Sukhlalji Sanghvi. (L.D. Series 84.) Gen. ed. Dalsukh Malvania et al. Ahmedabad, 1981). This paradox arises from the statement \\"this is unnameable\\" or \\"this is unsignifiable\\". The MahƒÅbhƒÅ·π£ya-dƒ´pikƒÅ (also MahƒÅbhƒÅ·π£ya-·π≠ƒ´kƒÅ) is an early subcommentary on Patanjali's VyƒÅkara·πáa-MahƒÅbhƒÅ·π£ya, also attributed to Bhart·πõhari.Extensively used by later grammarians such as Kaiya·π≠a, the text is only fragmentarily preserved. An edition based on an incomplete manuscript was published by Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, Pune (1985-1991), in six fascicules (fascicule 6 in two parts). ≈öatakatraya Bhartrihari's poetry is aphoristic, and comments on the social mores of the time. The collected work is known as ≈öatakatraya \\"the three ≈õatakas or 'hundreds' ('centuries')\\", consisting of three thematic compilations on shringara, vairagya and niti (loosely: love, dispassion and moral conduct) of hundred verses each. Unfortunately, the extant manuscript versions of these shatakas vary widely in the verses included. D.D. Kosambi has identified a kernel of two hundred that are common to all the versions. Here is a sample that comments on social mores: And here is one dealing with the theme of love: : The clear bright flame of a man's discernment dies : When a girl clouds it with her lamp-black eyes. [Bhartrihari #77, tr. John Brough; poem 167] poem 12 Bhartrhari's paradox Bhartrhari's paradox is the title of a 1981 paper by Hans and Radhika HerzbergerHerzberger, Hans and Radhika Herzberger (1981). \\"Bhartrhari's Paradox\\" Journal of Indian Philosophy 9: 1-17 (slightly revised version of \\"Bhartrhari's Paradox\\" in Studies in Indian Philosophy. A memorial volume in honour of pandit Sukhlalji Sanghvi. (L.D. Series 84.) Gen. ed. Dalsukh Malvania et al. Ahmedabad, 1981). which drew attention to the discussion of self-referential paradoxes in the work VƒÅkyapadƒ´ya attributed to Bhart·πõhari, an Indian grammarian of the 5th century. In the chapter dealing with logical and linguistic relations, the Sambandha-samudde≈õa, Bhartrhari discusses several statements of a paradoxical nature, including sarvam mithyƒÅ bravƒ´mi \\"everything I am saying is false\\" which belongs to the liar paradox family, as well as the paradox arising from the statement that something is unnameable or unsignifiable (in Sanskrit: avƒÅcya): this becomes nameable or signifiable precisely by calling it unnameable or unsignifiable. When applied to integers, the latter is known today as Berry paradox. Bhartrhari's interest lies not in strengthening this and other paradoxes by abstracting them from pragmatic context, but rather in exploring how a stubborn paradox may arise from unproblematic situations in daily communication. An unproblematic situation of communication is turned into a paradox ‚Äî we have either contradiction (virodha) or infinite regress (anavasthƒÅ) ‚Äî when abstraction is made from the signification and its extension in time, by accepting a simultaneous, opposite function (apara vyƒÅpƒÅra) undoing the previous one.Jan E.M. Houben, \\"Paradoxe et perspectivisme dans la philosophie de langage de Bhartrhari: langage, pens√©e et r√©alit√©\\", Bulletin d'√âtudes Indiennes 19 (2001):173-199. www.academia.edu/6169499/ For Bhartrhari it is important to analyse and solve the unsignifiability paradox because he holds that what cannot be signified may nevertheless be indicated (vyapadi≈õyate) and it may be understood (pratƒ´yate) to exist.

Finn co-wrote \\"Drop Out\\" and \\"Road Trip\\" with Marie Azcona, his wife; he co-wrote \\"Where I Live\\" with Mike Chunn, a former Split Enz bandmate. For the work Finn used the Steel City Band and additional musicians. The show's run premiered on 3 January 1998 at Sydney Casino's Star City Showroom with Finn as music director. Mark Woods of Variety described Finn's score, \\"while live, thunderously loud rock music, composed by [Finn ...] gives the action some punch, it often threatens to overpower parts of the show and frequently necessitates straining to hear the tapping.\\" Track listing Personnel ;Steel City Band: * Joe Acaria: ‚Äì drums * Dario Bortolin: ‚Äì bass guitar (except tracks 4, 16) * Tim Finn: ‚Äì acoustic guitar (tracks 6, 14), guitar (4, 16), keyboards (4, 14, 16), piano (tracks 4, 16), vocals (4, 6, 14, 16) * Greg Hitchcock: ‚Äì guitar, bass guitar (tracks 4, 16) * Laurence Maddy: ‚Äì Hammond organ, trombone, guitar, sound effects ;Additional musicians * Ben Ely: ‚Äì bass guitar and dulcimer (track 6) * Jodi Phillis: ‚Äì backing vocals (track 14) * Greg Wales: ‚Äì drums (tracks 4, 16) ;Recording details * Studio: ‚Äì Sun Studios, Sydney (except tracks 6, 14), Sunshine Studios, Brisbane (tracks 6, 14) * Producer: ‚Äì Tim Finn; Greg Wales, Finn and Greg Hitchcock (tracks 4, 16); Finn, Peter Contini and Hitchcock (track 1); Finn and Contini (tracks 9, 12), Robert Moore (tracks 6, 14) * Engineer, mixer: ‚Äì Peter Contini (except tracks 6, 14); Joe Malone (tracks 6, 14); Greg Wales (tracks 4, 16)  Additional engineering, mixer: ‚Äì Peter Continin (tracks 6, 14) * Mastering: ‚Äì Tony Learmont Notes A reworked version of \\"Road Trip\\" appears on Tim Finn's 1999 solo album Say It Is So.

They are sometimes referred to as cryptic forest frogs or cryptic poison frogs. They are the sister taxon of the Dendrobatidae, the poison dart frogs, but are not as toxic as most dendrobatids are. Taxonomy The Aromobatidae were separated from the Dendrobatidae only in 2006, and some sources continue to treat these frogs as part of the Dendrobatidae. However, their position as the sister taxa is well supported, and the question is primarily about whether they should be ranked as a family or a subfamily. The validity of subfamilies within the Aromobatidae is also unsettled. Some evidence points to paraphyly of at least the subfamily Anomaloglossinae, and genus Allobates, largely because of the uncertain placement of Allobates olfersioides. Reproduction Many aromobatids deposit small clutches of eggs in terrestrial nests. After hatching, one of the parents transports the tadpoles to a small water body, where they complete their development to metamorphosis. Anomaloglossus stepheni, Anomaloglossus degranvillei, Allobates chalcopis, and Allobates nidicola are four aromobatid species that have non-feeding tadpoles.  Subfamilies and species  By late 2019, 126 species in three subfamilies and five genera had been described: * Allobatinae Grant, Frost, Caldwell, Gagliardo, Haddad, Kok, Means, Noonan, Schargel, and Wheeler, 2006 (55 spp.)  Allobates Zimmermann and Zimmermann, 1988 (55 spp.) * Anomaloglossinae Grant, Frost, Caldwell, Gagliardo, Haddad, Kok, Means, Noonan, Schargel, and Wheeler, 2006 (32 spp.)  Anomaloglossus Grant, Frost, Caldwell, Gagliardo, Haddad, Kok, Means, Noonan, Schargel, and Wheeler, 2006 (30 spp.)  Rheobates Grant, Frost, Caldwell, Gagliardo, Haddad, Kok, Means, Noonan, Schargel, and Wheeler, 2006 (two spp.) * Aromobatinae Grant, Frost, Caldwell, Gagliardo, Haddad, Kok, Means, Noonan, Schargel, and Wheeler, 2006 (38 spp.)  Aromobates Myers, Paolillo-O., and Daly, 1991 (18 spp.)  Mannophryne La Marca, 1992 (20 spp.) In addition, \\"Prostherapis\\" dunni Rivero, 1961 is placed in this family, but its more precise placement is unknown; it might be an Aromobates.

The EP was released on CD by Kranky on May 8, 2007, and later as a vinyl bundle with Cryptograms. A music video for the track \\"Strange Lights\\" is included with the CD release. The album's cover is a photograph of Deerhunter guitarist Lockett Pundt as a seventh-grader. Its lyrical themes touch on death and the decomposition of the human body‚Äî\\"Fluorescent Grey\\" is the name lead singer Bradford Cox gives to the color of dead flesh. Fluorescent Grey received a number of positive reviews upon its release. Cox later released a free series of demos over the internet, being early versions of tracks on Fluorescent Grey and other material. Music and lyrics Unlike Cryptograms, Fluorescent Grey does not contain any ambient tracks. Lead singer Bradford Cox considers the EP's four tracks to be \\"four singles; they're all four good. They could stand on their own.\\" The songs were recorded while Cryptograms was being mixed; their sound has been described as \\"tightly song-focused, not as drifting or dreamy\\" as Cryptograms. Cox had considered including these tracks on the next Deerhunter record instead of releasing them on their own. However, he wanted the band's next album to be \\"something totally different\\" from Cryptograms and Fluorescent Grey. As with Cryptograms, Cox did not write the lyrics to the band's music in advance, instead singing stream-of-consciousness. The lyrics of Fluorescent Grey carry themes of death and the decomposition of the human body. Cox used the term \\"Fluorescent Grey\\"‚Äîalso the title of the EP's opening track‚Äîto describe the color of decaying flesh. He has described the lyrics of the song as being \\"about panic attacks, lust, and existential dread.\\" \\"Dr. Glass\\", in which Cox sings of \\"so many useless bodies‚Ä¶in the world\\", is characterized as \\"more existential dread on a global scale\\". Cox has said that the EP's third track, \\"Like New,\\" is \\"about waking up one day after a long period of depression and finding the world somehow more bearable and kind of ‚Äònew‚Äô and exciting again.\\" The fourth and final song on Fluorescent Grey, \\"Wash Off,\\" describes Cox's encounters with an \\"uppity hippie kid\\" who sold him counterfeit acid as a teenager, insisting that Cox was not open-minded enough for the drug to affect him. As the song ends, Cox repeats the phrase \\"I was sixteen\\". Demo releases In January 2008, Cox released a collection of nine tracks entitled Fluorescent Grey Demos & Out-takes as a free download on the Deerhunter blog. The release includes early demos of tracks from Fluorescent Grey as well as other unreleased material. The first three tracks, \\"Fluorescent Grey,\\" \\"Dr. Glass,\\" and \\"Like New,\\" were recorded over one afternoon, created in an attempt \\"to better refine the songs\\" for their eventual release. Cox wrote on the Deerhunter blog that he \\"especially like[s]\\" this early version of \\"Dr. Glass,\\" as he feels the band did not adequately capture \\"the atmosphere and creepiness\\" he desired for the song's final incarnation. The fourth track is a version of \\"Wash Off\\" recorded by Cox alone in December 2003. \\"Greyscale,\\" recorded February 2006, is the original version of a track remixed for its release on Deerhunter 7\\", a split album recorded for Rob's House Records. The remix was done by band member Josh Fauver. \\"Kousin Klash\\" and \\"So Many Bodies\\" served as the framework for tracks on Fluorescent Grey. Cox recorded \\"So Many Bodies\\" after experiencing a panic attack induced by a photograph he saw in The New York Times, showing an Iraqi girl hunched over her dead mother's corpse. \\"I started thinking about bodies and rotting and brutal violent human stuff, wars, all this terrible stuff from history‚Ä¶and literally hid under my sheets, sweating. I made this tape later that night.\\" \\"Axis I (F.Grey)\\" is a track originally released on Atlas Sound/Mexcellent Split in 2007. \\"People Never No\\" is a sketch that later developed into the song \\"Fluorescent Grey\\"; in recording the song, Cox was inspired by the bands The Breeders and The Fall, and \\"obsessed with having two drum tracks on everything\\". Reception Fluorescent Grey was given a score of 8.8/10 by Pitchfork Media, as well as the publication's \\"Best New Music\\" accolade. Pitchfork writer Marc Hogan considered the EP \\"clearer and less abrasive than Cryptograms musically,\\" and \\"a triumphant document of a stubbornly visionary young band with the world still spread out before them.\\" Mike Diver of Drowned In Sound called Fluorescent Grey Deerhunter \\"at their most relaxed\\". He found the EP's musical style to be a \\"delightful deviation\\" from Cryptograms, as it gives listeners an opportunity to step \\"back from all things fiery and furious\\" characterized by that album. PopMatters music critic Josh Berquist wrote of the EP's opening track, pointing out the contrast of Cox's \\"lucid reflection on loss‚Ä¶[and] the morbid imagery of bodies in decay\\" sung \\"over an incongruously bright and chiming rhythm\\", which he found made \\"such beautiful invitations to bloody eviscerations unnervingly captivating.\\" Jeff Klingman of Prefix Magazine considered the final track of Fluorescent Grey, \\"Wash Off\\", to be the only song which \\"channel[s] the aggression that peppers Cryptograms first half.\\" Klingman found Cox to be preoccupied with his past within this song's lyrics, \\"suggesting an unhealthy disconnect above and beyond wistful remembrance.\\" In his review for Tiny Mix Tapes, writer Chris Ruen said that Fluorescent Grey \\"is a bit rushed\\" in terms of structure, which he feels \\"detracts from one of Deerhunter‚Äôs particular strengths: constructing a dynamic, organic listening experience.\\" David Coleman of No Ripcord called the EP \\"a less thrilling ride than Cryptograms,\\" and that while \\"There are plenty of good ideas, not to mention a great guitar sound...the band chooses to wrap it up early rather than kick back and explore these [ideas] further.\\" Track listing All songs written by Bradford Cox, except where noted. #\\"Fluorescent Grey\\" ‚Äì 5:02 #\\"Dr. Glass\\" ‚Äì 3:14 #\\"Like New\\" ‚Äì 2:13 (music by Lockett Pundt) #\\"Wash Off\\" ‚Äì 5:46 Personnel *Bradford Cox ‚Äì guitar, vocals, bass drum, gong, tapes, keys, piano *Moses Archuleta ‚Äì drums, percussion *Joshua Fauver ‚Äì bass *Colin Mee ‚Äì guitar, tapes, percussion *Lockett Pundt ‚Äì guitars *Nicolas Vernhes ‚Äì mixing *Jennifer Munson ‚Äì mastering References Category:2007 EPs Category:Deerhunter albums Category:Kranky albums ","title":"Fluorescent Grey"},{"id":"11174009","text":"Fairview Crossroads (or more commonly Fairview) is an unincorporated community in Surry County, North Carolina.

Databases indicated as circles (with wikidata indicated as ‚ÄòWD‚Äô), with grey lines linking databases in the network if their data is aligned. In computing, linked data (often capitalized as Linked Data) is structured data which is interlinked with other data so it becomes more useful through semantic queries. It builds upon standard Web technologies such as HTTP, RDF and URIs, but rather than using them to serve web pages only for human readers, it extends them to share information in a way that can be read automatically by computers. Part of the vision of linked data is for the Internet to become a global database. Tim Berners-Lee, director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), coined the term in a 2006 design note about the Semantic Web project. Linked data may also be open data, in which case it is usually described as linked open data (LOD). Principles Tim Berners-Lee outlined four principles of linked data in his \\"Linked Data\\" note of 2006, paraphrased along the following lines: Tim Berners-Lee gave a presentation on linked data at the TED 2009 conference. In it, he restated the linked data principles as three \\"extremely simple\\" rules: Components * URIs * HTTP * Structured data using controlled vocabulary terms and dataset definitions expressed in Resource Description Framework serialization formats such as RDFa, RDF/XML, N3, Turtle, or JSON-LD * Linked Data Platform Linked open data Linked open data is linked data that is open data. Tim Berners-Lee gives the clearest definition of linked open data in differentiation with linked data. Large linked open data sets include DBpedia and Wikidata. =History= The term \\"linked open data\\" has been in use since at least February 2007, when the \\"Linking Open Data\\" mailing list was created. The mailing list was initially hosted by the SIMILE project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. =Linking Open Data community project= The above diagram shows which Linking Open Data datasets are connected, as of August 2014. This was produced by the Linked Open Data Cloud project, which was started in 2007. Some sets may include copyrighted data which is freely available.Linking open data cloud diagram 2014, by Max Schmachtenberg, Christian Bizer, Anja Jentzsch and Richard Cyganiak. http://lod-cloud.net/ The same diagram as above, but for February 2017, showing the growth in just two and a half years. The goal of the W3C Semantic Web Education and Outreach group's Linking Open Data community project is to extend the Web with a data commons by publishing various open datasets as RDF on the Web and by setting RDF links between data items from different data sources. In October 2007, datasets consisted of over two billion RDF triples, which were interlinked by over two million RDF links. By September 2011 this had grown to 31 billion RDF triples, interlinked by around 504 million RDF links. A detailed statistical breakdown was published in 2014. =European Union projects= There are a number of European Union projects involving linked data.

Sauer had married his wife Francesca in Vienna, Austria at age eighteen and a half. There, they had their five children: Gustave O.L., Anthony Philip Jr., Julius J., Emil, and Johanna. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Family background In 1858, they decided to move to New York City to be with Anton's mother and sisters that had already been there for some time. Due to his worsening case of tuberculosis and Francesca's death in 1868, he decided to move his family to Kansas City. After his business became successful, he began courting a young 28-year-old widow, Mary (Maria) Einhellig Messerschmidt, who had two daughters of her own: Anna and Maria. After marrying in 1869 they had five daughters (four survived to maturity): Eva Marie, Antoinette, Josephine (sometimes listed as Fosefa), and Clara. Daughter Helen (sometimes listed as Frances) died in infancy age 14 months. By 1872 the mansion was finally fully furnished, sitting on the Shawnee Indian trail that was part of the old Santa Fe Trail that many wagons passed. After Anton's death on August 16, 1879 in the second floor master bedroom, Mary and the children continued living in the house, as did the children continue living there after Mary's death in 1919. On November 29th 1919, she passed in Kansas City, MO of a heart attack. Daughter Eve Maria Sauer married William C. Van Fossen in the house, having one child named Helen before the marriage failed 18 months into it. She then married a widower with six children of his own, local Wyandotte County businessman and landowner, Mr. John S. Perkins. Together they had three children and stayed married until he committed suicide with a handgun at age 73, the reason being his declining health. Eve and John S. Perkins' son John Harrison Perkins had an infant daughter drown in the swimming pool on the west side of the house. Eve continued to live in the family home with her son and two daughters, Eva Marie Perkins, and Marguerite A. Perkins, until her death in 1955. Five generations of the Sauer family continued living in the mansion until the owner of a home heating oil company, Paul Berry, bought the house after Eve's death. He lived in the mansion until his own death in December 1986. Because of ghost stories originating in 1930, the house was constantly trespassed and vandalized, which Barry and his dog fought off themselves.  Subsequent history  In January 1987, Bud Wyman, his son and daughter in law, Cliff and Cindy Jones, bought the home hoping to turn it into a bed and breakfast. At this time, no one lived in the house. In 1988, Carl Lopp, great, great grandson of Anthony Sauer, bought the house with the intention of fixing it up and residing there to keep it in the family. However, this has proved to be a difficult task for Lopp, and has only managed minor repairs such as fixing balconies and putting a large fence around the property. Carl Lopp's hired caretaker of the house was charged with felony theft on August 15, 1996 for stealing 30 thousand dollars worth of artifacts from the house, including a tractor, dress, chandelier, copper from the furnace, and wall sconces. There have been a number of ghost stories that can be disproved (such as the previous family all being murdered there by the father, who then continued to commit suicide) that keep people vandalizing the house, which keeps Lopp from receiving insurance money.  Architecture  It is located at 935 Shawnee Road in Kansas City, Kansas. The architect is unknown but may have been Asa Beebe Cross. The home's design is an example of Italianate architecture. It was placed in the Kansas City, Kansas Historic Landmarks on January 29, 1987. It was placed in the Register of Historic Kansas Places on July 1, 1977.

In addition they are also famous in Italy for their songs and choirs. The first Alpini units were formed in 1872 recruiting it soldiers among the inhabitants of the valleys of Italy‚Äôs northern mountain regions. During World War I the Alpinis saw heavy combat all over the alpine arch. The war has become known as the \\"War in snow and ice\\", as most of the 600 km frontline ran through the highest mountains and glaciers of the Alps and every position was occupied around the whole year. It was during these years that the Alpini, their spirit and their mules became legend, although at the cost of over 12,000 deaths out of a total of 40,000 mobilized Alpinis. During this time many songs originated within the Alpini corps that tell of the hardships and brutality of this conflict. After World War I former members (called: \\"Veci\\") founded choirs in their hometowns and offered thus the Italian people a glimpse into the hardships of the \\"War in Snow and Ice\\". Some of the most famous and well known Alpini songs are: * Aprite le Porte : An upbeat choral calling on people to open their doors and have look at a column of advancing Alpini. * Bersagliere Ha Cento Penne : This song begins by telling the difference between the single, long black feather which distinguishes the Alpini's cap from the Bersaglieri, who have a lot of smaller feathers on their cap. It goes on to tell why being an Alpino is harder than any other soldier's job, and says that the Alpini don't fear death because they die among the flowers of the Alps. * Cosa Fai, Mio Bel Gin Gin : This song tells the story of a wife, who awaits the return of her husband, but is told by retreating Alpini, that her wait is in vain. * Di qua, di l√† del Piave : A song about a beautiful girl. * E Cadorna Manda A Dire : General Cadorna calls on the Alpini to advance and guard the frontier; alas they know they are on their way to guard the frontier for eternity. * Era Una Notte Che Pioveva : A single soldier stands guard in the middle of a snowstorm on a mountain summit, dreaming of his beloved at home. * Il Testamento Del Capitano : The Captain of a Company is mortally wounded and asks to see the rest of his Alpini a last time; they come, even though they have no shoes to walk. He asks them to cut his heart into five pieces: one for his homeland Italy, one for the battalion, one for his mother, one for his love and the last one for the mountains, which will surround it with roses and flowers. * La Montanara : A song about the beauty of the Alps, very famous and often considered as the hymn of the Alps. * La Si Taglia I Biondi Capelli : A young girl cut off her blonde hair to enlist in the army and thus able to follow her first love to the front on the Piave river. * La Tradotta : ‚ÄúThe railway that begins in Turin, doesn‚Äôt stop in Milan anymore, but goes directly to the Piave - cemetery of youth. : In 29 we left home, only in 7 we returned, the other 22 all died in San Dona. : Dear nun, I‚Äôm wounded, tomorrow I won‚Äôt see, my mother will not come; put a flower on my grave. : A cross is in Nervesa, my brother is buried there, I wrote Ninetto on it, and so mother might find him.‚Äù * La Valsugana : The dream of returning home. * Lass√π in montagna : A inspirational song about that even when alone in the mountains all of Italy stands besides the Alpini. * Monte Canino : The Alpini arrive on the front after days of transport in railways wagons. * Monte Cauriol : The wind brings the news to a family that their son has died on Mountain ‚ÄúCauriol‚Äù. * Monte Nero : The 3rd Alpini regiment is on its way to conquer Mount ‚ÄúNero‚Äù, but the attacks ends in such a massacre, that the regiment's colonel sits amid his dead soldiers and weeps. * Monte Pasubio : A long column of Alpini is on the way to Mount ‚ÄúPasubio‚Äù, a column of those that will never return, that go to die on Mount ‚ÄúPasubio‚Äù. But the Alpinis are not afraid; they will not return/ turn around. (In Italian the used verb has this double meaning) * Quel Mazzolin Di Fiori : A young woman collects flowers she will bring to her love. Bridge of the Alpini * Signore delle cime : A prayer for a man who died in the mountains. It prays God to let him climb the mountains of Paradise - this famous song is a recent song (1958) written by Bepi de Marzi, an italian composer who wrote many songs drawing inspiration from popular tradition. * Stelutis Alpinis : In Friulian. A dead soldier tells his beloved where he is buried: \\"up among the rocks\\" under a clearing full of edelweiss. He tells her to come and pick one flower, and hold it when she prays for him, so he will still be with her.Translations of Stelutis Alpinis to Italian, Hebrew and Yiddish, as well as phonetic transcription of the original - by Ghil'ad Zuckermann * Sul Cappello Che Noi Portiamo : A hymn on the black feather that the Alpini carry on their hat. * Sul Ponte Di Bassano : On the famous \\"Bridge of the Alpini\\" in Bassano del Grappa the Alpini say goodbye to their loved ones, before departing to the nearby front. * Sul Ponte Di Perati : On the bridge of Perati a black flag of grief flies for the Alpinis of the Alpine Division Julia, who goes to war, goes under the earth. * Ta - Pum! : After 20 days on Mount Ortigara, the battalion descends and has no soldiers left; they are all in the cemetery by the river, where the battalions remaining soldiers will soon stop by too.

This bird occurs in the highlands (5,000 ft/1,500 m ASL and higher) of the Andes, from Venezuela and Colombia through Ecuador and Peru south to Bolivia and perhaps northwesternmost Argentina.BLI (2008) Description in Yanacocha Reserve, Ecuador These are medium-sized birds, measuring about in length and weighing about 500-840 grams (1.1-1.8 lbs).http://www.zootierliste.de/en/?klasse=2&ordnung;=209&familie;=20902&art;=21103461 They are long-bodied with thin necks and small heads, and similar in shape to turkeys but more slender and elegant. The plumage is overall brown with whitish edging to the feathers of the head, neck and chest. It has a red dewlap and reddish legs. In the Conover Collection of the Field Museum, there is a hypopigmented female specimen of the subspecies atrogularis taken December 20, 1929, at Pucar√° (west Ecuador). The forehead, chin and upper throat retain the normal color and the hind part of the body is faintly barred pinkish-buff; otherwise the plumage is white. The iris color was not recorded, making it tough to determine whether this is a case of albinism or leucism. Leucism is more frequently seen in birds - particularly in such pronounced cases -, and hypopigmented cracids are rare in the first place. This particular bird has abraded feathers; prior to its death it seems to have been held in a cage for some time, presumably to show off such a rare specimen.Blake (1955), Terres & NAS (1980) Guango Lodge, Ecuador Ecology and status They are inhabitants of cloud forest; the sightings of this cracid are often associated to the migrations of army ants which the bird usually follows. The nest is built in a tree, with single egg each mating season. Two adults with a young were observed in Ecuador in late June.Cisneros-Heredia (2006) Three of four birds of the nominate subspecies, collected on May 29 at the Balcones River near Guasca, were molting their tails. The tail molt starts at the outside and progresses inward, with the old rectrices being shed in alternating pairs.Blake (1955) It is affected by habitat destruction, apparently unable to cope with deforestation, and also hunted for food. However, the Andean guan has a vast range and is thus not globally threatened.Cisneros-Heredia (2006), BLI (2008) Given its altitudinal range, it might be affected by habitat fragmentation in the long term. There is little data on its overall population, but it occurs in several protected areas in its range.

The programmes are broadcast Monday through Saturday each week. Nob Nation is written and produced by Oliver Callan. The series features almost 100 characters, including BIFFO, Dame Enda, Garret FitzGerald, and others based on people from Irish and international public life involved in politics, sport and entertainment. All voice acting is performed by Callan. Two CDs of Nob Nation sketches have been released, in 2007 and a follow-up in 2008. In 2011, RT√â paid defamation damages to an 84-year-old gentleman after Nob Nation inaccurately claimed he was running a brothel. Background Originally broadcast on The Derek Mooney Show on RT√â Radio 1 and subsequently on the 2fm Breakfast Show, the sketches were moved to just after the 10:00 news on The Gerry Ryan Show on RT√â 2fm in January 2007. Nob Nation was then repeated at night on Damien Farrelly's The Frequency on 2FM. One comedy sketch was selected and was featured on Playback on Radio One on Saturday mornings and on The Saturday Show on 2fm on Saturday afternoons. It has also featured on Ireland's most popular radio show, Morning Ireland, on RT√â Radio 1. Nob Nation was reported in the Sunday Independent on 20 January 2008 as being Ireland's most popular podcast of the previous year, with figures showing a total of 736,711 downloads on RT√â.ie between April and December 2007. Nob Nation also features prominently on the iTunes free podcast chart. Following a number of complaints about Callan's portrayal of Taoiseach Brian Cowen \\"swaying and snorting in booze-filled sing-songs about his difficulties in office\\", the popularity of the slot has \\"simply exploded\\" according to RT√â, with over 250,000 hits each month and making up almost a third of all downloads from RT√â.ie. In January 2009, Nob Nation satirised the RT√â staff pay cut controversy by suggesting Gerry Ryan would try to get out of taking a pay cut by broadcasting for longer but without charging extra for it and that Pat Kenny would contribute to the economy by doing a nixer for free in the RT√â canteen ‚Äì to the dismay of all who preferred their full Irish breakfast to the delicacies favoured by the Kenny palate.

And a third album \\"Nob Nation Uncensored\\" was released in the Irish Daily Mail in November 2009, containing tracks not previously broadcast and a series of sketches that had not been played on RT√â. Live performances Nob Nation has featured on RT√â Television's prime time chat shows Tubridy Tonight and The Late Late Show. In December 2007 Callan was introduced by then Taoiseach Bertie Ahern to perform at Fianna F√°il's Cairde F√°il dinner. Callan performed a number of acts at the dinner, including mimicking Ahern himself. In February 2008 Callan also performed a live show at √ìgra Fianna F√°il's National Youth Conference. In 2008 a debut Irish live show was commissioned as part of the Bulmers International Comedy Festival. Callan performed his pieces in Dublin's Olympia Theatre on 6 September 2008.\\"Nob Nation\\" .

The manner of expulsion of the villagers is not mentioned. The people of Zakariyya were evicted on 17 May 1950 by the military. Fifteen families comprising 65 people, were transferred to the town of Ramla, while the rest of the community, some 130 people, were taken to a location near the Jordanian border where they were ordered to walk over. To hasten the process, \\"soldiers shot in the air several times\\". They eventually settled in the West Bank refugee camps of al-Arroub and Dheisheh Refugee Camp, where the village's war refugees had settled.Mordechai Bar-On, officer in charge of the eviction. Quoted in Morris, 2004, p. 521 Two weeks after the village was emptied, the Jewish Agency resettled families of Jewish-Kurdish settlers near the village, later moving them inside the former Palestinian village to become residents of a new moshav, now Hebraized as Zekharia.Khalidi, 1992, p. 226 Mosque of Az- Zakariyya, 2015 During the 1960s, most of the buildings in the village were destroyed as part of a national program to \\"level\\" depopulated villages. In 1992, Walid Khalidi described the remaining structures: \\"The mosque and a number of houses, some occupied by Jewish residents and others deserted, remain on the site. Large sections of the site itself are covered with wild vegetation. The mosque is in a state of neglect and an Israeli flag is planted on top of the minaret.

This home is generally considered to be the first permanent, non-native, residence in Chicago, Illinois. The site of Point du Sable's home is now partially occupied by and commemorated in Pioneer Court at 401 N. Michigan Avenue in the Near North Side community area of Chicago, Illinois. History Point du Sable likely settled near the mouth of the Chicago River sometime around the 1780s and sold the property in 1800. He lived here with his wife, Kitihawa, and children. The 1800 bill of sale was rediscovered in 1913 in an archive in Detroit, Michigan. The property included a house, two barns, a horse drawn mill, a bakehouse, a poultry house, a dairy, and a smokehouse. Their house was a log cabin filled with fine furniture and paintings. Following Point du Sable's departure from Chicago, the home became the property of John Kinzie. In 1834 the land owned by Kinzie was platted and sold. The \\"Kinzie addition\\" to Chicago, which is assumed to be coterminous with Point du Sable's estate extended from the banks of the Chicago River north to Chicago Avenue, and from State Street east to Lake Michigan. Monument A commemorative plaque, struck in 1937, was installed on a marble block at Pioneer Court after its 1965 dedication. It reads, \\"KINZIE MANSION / Near this site stood Kinzie Mansion, / 1784-1832, home of Pointe Du Saible, / Le Mai, and John Kinzie, Chicago's / \\"first civilian,\\" here was born in 1805, / the city's first white child Ellen Marion Kinzie\\". While the plaque is correct that Ellen Marion Kinzie was the first white child born in the city, Du Sable's granddaughter, Eulalie Pelletier, was the first non-native to be born in the city, in 1796. Pioneer Court was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and listed as a National Historic Landmark on May 11, 1976. At this site in 2009 the City of Chicago and a private donor erected a large bronze bust of Point duSable by Chicago-born sculptor Erik Blome. In October 2010 the adjacent Michigan Avenue Bridge was renamed DuSable Bridge in honor of Point duSable.

Lieber (1886 - 1986) Lillian Rosanoff Lieber (July 26, 1886 in Nicolaiev, Russian Empire - July 11, 1986 in Queens, New York) was a Russian- American mathematician and popular author.\\"Robert Jantzen's webpage on Lieber\\" She often teamed up with her illustrator husband, Hugh Gray Lieber, to produce works. Life and career =Early life and education= Lieber was one of four children of Abraham H. and Clara (Bercinskaya) Rosanoff. Her brothers were Denver publisher Joseph Rosenberg, psychiatrist Aaron Rosanoff, and chemist Martin Andr√© Rosanoff. Aaron and Martin changed their names to sound more Russian, less Jewish.\\"Paul Dry, Publisher of her reissued books\\" Lieber moved to the US with her family in 1891. She received her A.B. from Barnard College in 1908, her M.A. from Columbia University in 1911, and her Ph.D. (in chemistry) from Clark University in 1914, under Martin's direction; at Clark, Solomon Lefschetz was a classmate. She married Hugh Gray Lieber on October 27, 1926. =Career= After teaching at Hunter College from 1908 to 1910, and in the New York City high school system (1910-1912, 1914-1915), she became a Research Fellow at Bryn Mawr College from 1915 to 1917; she then went on to teach at Wells College from 1917 to 1918 as Instructor of Physics (also acting as head of the physics department), and at the Connecticut College for Women (1918 to 1920). She joined the mathematics department at Long Island University (LIU) in Brooklyn, New York (LIU Brooklyn) in 1934, became department chair in 1945 (taking over from Hugh when he became Professor, and Chair, of Art at LIU ), and was made a full professor in 1947, until her retirement in 1954; she was appointed director of LIU's Galois Institute of Mathematics (later the Galois Institute of Mathematics and Art) (named for √âvariste Galois) in 1934. Over her career she published some 17 books, which were written in a unique, free-verse style and illustrated with whimsical line drawings by her husband. Her highly accessible writings were praised by no less than Albert Einstein, Cassius Jackson Keyser, Eric Temple Bell, and S. I. Hayakawa. Concerning her book, The Education of T. C. MITS, Dorothy Canfield Fisher said: \\"This is quite different from any other book you ever bought... full of mathematics and full of humor... also full of a deep, healing philosophy of life, reassuring, strengthening, [and] humane...\\"Bookjacket of the 1944 W. W. Norton Edition of The Education of T. C. MITS She edited several volumes of Galois lectures, including Martin's A Practical Simplification of the Method of Least Squares, several talks by Alonzo Church, and Lattice Theory by Garrett Birkhoff. Although Lieber retired from Long Island University in 1954, she continued to write and publish into the 1960s. =Personal obscurity= Few details of Lillian Lieber's life and career have survived, even at Long Island University. She died in Queens, New York just weeks shy of her 100th birthday. She came from a well-educated Jewish family. Details can be found in the out of print book, Yesterday, that was written by her cousin Miriam Shomer Zunser in the 1930s. Unusual typography In addition to enlivening her books with illustrations (or \\"psyquaports\\" ) by her husband, Hugh Gray Lieber (who was head of the Department of Fine Arts at Long Island University), Lillian often chose an unusual scheme of typography which is self-explained in this example from her Preface to The Education of T. C. MITS: This is not intended to be free verse. Writing each phrase on a separate line facilitates rapid reading, and everyone is in a hurry nowadays. T.C. MITS was an acronym for \\"The Celebrated Man In The Street,\\" a character who, like George Gamow's Mr Tompkins, served as a device for bringing concepts in higher mathematics and physics to the general public. The MITS character was central to Lieber's populist approach to education, and she often laced her expositions with passages extolling the virtues of the democratic system. \\"The Lillian Lieber Standard\\" In her book, The Einstein Theory of Relativity, Lillian Lieber stated her views on the inclusion of mathematics in books intended for \\"the celebrated man [or woman] in the streets:\\" \\"...just enough mathematics to HELP and NOT to HINDER the lay reader... Many 'popular' discussions of Relativity without any math at all have been written, but we doubt whether even the best of these can possibly give to a novice an adequate idea of what it is all about.... On the other hand, there are many [books on relativity] that are accessible to experts only.\\" The Cavendish Press in Ann Arbor, Michigan, has adopted Lillian's rule of thumb with some elaboration.Cavendish Press Web Site, elaboration of the Lillian Lieber Standard Works Although her works were broadly influential (including a special paperback edition of The Education of T. C. MITS that was circulated to American servicemen during World War II), they remained out of print for decades. Starting in 2007, publisher Paul Dry Books has reissued The Education of T.C.

The Battle of El Brazito took place on December 25, 1846 between the United States Army and the Mexican Army during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. Battle In October 1846, Colonel Alexander W. Doniphan of the First Regiment Mounted Missouri Volunteers was ordered by United States Army General Stephen W. Kearney to rendezvous with General John E. Wool inside Mexico at the city of Chihuahua. En route to Chihuahua, Doniphan's regiment was attacked by a Mexican army about thirty miles from El Paso del Norte, about 9 miles south of Las Cruces, New Mexico, at Brazito on the Rio Grande.Bauer, K.J., 1974, The Mexican War, 1846‚Äì1848, New York: Macmillan, Since it was Christmas, Doniphan had halted his men's march at 1 PM that day. However, they spotted the dust cloud of a Mexican scouting party to the south and Colonel Doniphan promptly ordered his men to prepare for battle. Before long, the Mexican force under the command of Major Antonio Ponce de Leon arrived, consisting of the Chihuahua infantry on the left, the El Paso militia with a howitzer in the center, and the Veracruz lancers on the right. The Mexican Commander in parley demanded the Americans surrender. \\"Charge and be damned!\\" responded Col Doniphan. He and his men used the parley delay to fully form their battle line. The Mexicans then made a frontal assault on the American position. Doniphan ordered his troops to hold their fire until the Mexicans came within easy range. At 50 yards the Americans opened fire with their rifles and muskets. Their fire was devastatingly accurate and the Mexican regulars broke and fled. Mexican lancers next attacked Doniphan's wagon train, but were driven off by the teamsters. The Mexican force retreated under the command of Capt. Rafael Carabaja after Ponce was wounded, abandoning their howitzer, which Lt. Nicholas B. Wright's company recovered. Lieutenant Colonel Philip St. George Cooke, a member of the Army of the West, relates the battle thus: \\"On Christmas day, at a spot called Bracito, when the regiment after its usual march, had picketed their horses, and were gathering fuel, the advance guard reported the rapid approach of the enemy in large force. Line was formed on foot, when a black flag was received with an insolent demand. Colonel Doniphan restrained his men from shooting the bearer down. The enemy‚Äôs line, nearly half cavalry, and including a howitzer, opened fire at four hundred yards, and still advanced, and had fired three rounds, before fire was returned within effective range. Victory seems to have been decided by a charge of Captain Reid with twenty cavalry which he had managed to mount, and another charge by a dismounted company which captured the howitzer. The enemy fled, with loss of forty-three killed and one hundred and fifty wounded; our loss seven wounded, who all recovered. The enemy were about twelve hundred strong; five hundred cavalry, the rest infantry, including several hundred El Paso militia; our force was five hundred ‚Äì Lieutenant-Colonel Jackson with a part of the regiment arriving on the ground after the action. Colonel Doniphan gave credit 'for the most essential service in forming the line and during the engagement' to Captain Thompson, First dragoons, 'acting his aid and adviser.'\\" Aftermath As the Mexican forces fell back, they were harassed by Apache natives who had been watching the battle. Doniphan's men reached El Paso on 27 Dec., where they seized five tons of powder, 500 arms, 400 lances and four artillery pieces. Major Meriwether Lewis Clark, Sr. arrived on 5 Feb. with about 100 men and a six-gun battery. Doniphan led his forces southward on 8 Feb., headed to Chihuahua.

The headland in the foreground A Headland, in agriculture, is the area at each end of a planted field. In some areas of the United States, this area is known as the Turnrow. It is used for turning around with farm implements during field operations and is the first area to be harvested to minimize crop damage. The rows run perpendicular to the lay of the field and are usually two, three or four times the width of the implement used for planting the field. Characteristics The soil on headlands is subject to greater levels of soil compaction because it receives more traffic per unit of area than the field as a whole. Yields are generally lower than in the field itself due to additional implement traffic and crop damage from implements turning on them as well as compaction. Soil fertility levels are frequently higher than in the main part of the field due to overlapping applications of fertilizer coupled with reduced yields. Steam ploughing A steam ploughing engine In the days when steam ploughing was common, the engine would often remain on the headland and pull the plough across the field by a wire rope. There would be severe compaction of the headland but little compaction of the rest of the field. There would usually be two engines, one on each headland, and they would winch the plough to and fro between them.

The use of EAT has roots in antiquity, and EAT applies to physical health issues in modern form dates to the 1960s. Modern use of horses for mental health treatment dates to the 1990s. Systematic review of studies of EAT as applied to physical health date only to about 2007, and a lack of common terminology and standardization has caused problems with meta-analysis. Due to a lack of high-quality studies assessing the efficacy of equine-assisted therapies for mental health treatment, concerns have been raised that these therapies should not replace or divert resources from other evidence-based mental health therapies.  Terminology  An overall term that encompasses all forms of equine therapy is Equine-Assisted Activities and Therapy (EAAT). Various therapies that involve interactions with horses and other equines are used for individuals with and without special needs, including those with physical, cognitive and emotional issues. Terminology within the field is not standardized, and the lack of clear definitions and common terminology presents problems in reviewing medical literature. Within that framework, the more common therapies and terminology used to describe them are: * Therapeutic horseback riding uses a therapeutic team, usually including a certified therapeutic riding instructor, two or more volunteers, and a horse, to help an individual ride a horse and work with it on the ground. * Hippotherapy involves an occupational therapist, a physiotherapist, or a speech and language therapist working with a client and a horse. Different movements of the horse present challenges to the client to promote different postural responses of the client by the horse influencing the client rather than the client controlling the horse. The word \\"Hippotherapy\\" is also used in some contexts to refer to a broader realm of equine therapies. * Equine-assisted learning (EAL) is described as an \\"experiential learning approach that promotes the development of life skills ... through equine-assisted activities.\\" * Equine-assisted psychotherapy (EAP) does not necessarily involve riding, but may include grooming, feeding and ground exercises. Mental health professionals work with one or more clients and one or more horses in an experiential manner to help the clients learn about themselves and others, while processing or discussing the client's feelings, behaviours, and patterns. The goal is to help the client in social, emotional, cognitive, or behavioral ways. Other terms for equine psychotherapy include Equine- facilitated psychotherapy (EFP), equine-assisted therapy (EAT), Equine Facilitated Wellness (EFW), Equine Facilitated Counselling (EFC) and Equine Facilitated Mental Health (EFMH). * Interactive vaulting involves vaulting activities in a therapeutic milieu. * Therapeutic carriage driving involves controlling a horse while driving from a carriage seat or from a wheelchair in a carriage modified to accommodate the wheelchair. * Equine-Assisted Activities (EAA) incorporates all of the above activities plus horse grooming, and stable management, shows, parades, demonstrations, and the like.  Types  A demonstration of hippotherapy in Europe Most research has focused on physical benefit of therapeutic work with horses, though the most rigorous studies have only been subject to systematic review since about 2007. EAAT have been used to treat individuals with neurological diseases or disorders such as cerebral palsy, movement disorders, or balance problems. It is believed the rhythmical gait of a horse acts to move the rider's pelvis in the same rotation and side-to-side movement that occurs when walking; the horse's adjustable gait promotes riders to constantly adjust to encourage pelvic motion while promoting strength, balance, coordination, flexibility, posture, and mobility.Borzo, G. (2002). Horsepower. American Medical News, 45 (23), 24-26. EAAT have also been used to treat other disabilities, such as autism, behavioral disorders and psychiatric disorders. Due to a lack of rigorous scientific evidence, there is insufficient evidence to demonstrate if equine therapy for mental health treatment provides any benefit. = Therapeutic horseback riding = Therapeutic riding is used by disabled individuals who ride horses to relax, and to develop muscle tone, coordination, confidence, and well-being. Therapeutic horseback riding is considered recreational therapy where an individual is taught by a non-therapist riding instructor how to actively control a horse while riding. It is used as exercise to improve sensory and motor skills for coordination, balance, and posture.Whalen CN, Case-Smith J. Therapeutic effects of horseback riding therapy on gross motor function in children with cerebral palsy: A systematic review. Phys Occup Ther Pediatr. 2012;32(3):229-242. Most research has focused on the physical benefit of therapeutic work with horses, with the most rigorous studies being subject to systematic review since about 2007. Claims made as to the efficacy of equine therapies for mental health purposes have been criticized as lacking proper medical evidence due in large part to poor study design and lack of quantitative data. Ethical questions relating to its expense and its continued promotion have been raised in light of this lack of evidence. While such therapies do not appear to cause harm, it has been recommended they not be used as a mental treatment at this time unless future evidence shows a benefit for treating specific disorders. = Hippotherapy = Hippotherapy is an intervention used by a physical therapist, recreational therapist, occupational therapist, or speech and language pathologist. The movement of the horse affects a rider's posture, balance, coordination, strength and sensorimotor systems. It is thought that the warmth and shape of the horse and its rhythmic, three-dimensional movement along with the rider's interactions with the horse and responses to the movement of the horse can improve the flexibility, posture, balance and mobility of the rider. These therapy sessions can also include improvements in speech as well. Learning to use verbal cues for the horse, and to speak with the therapist is key to practicing use of speech. It differs from therapeutic horseback riding because it is one treatment strategy used by a licensed physical therapist, occupational therapist, or speech and language pathologists. They guide the rider's posture and actions while the horse is controlled by a horse handler at the direction of the therapist. The therapist guides both the rider and horse to encourage specific motor and sensory inputs. Therapists develop plans to address specific limitations and disabilities such as neuromuscular disorders, walking ability, or general motor function. = Equine-assisted psychotherapy = Equine-assisted psychotherapy (EAP) or Equine Facilitated Psychotherapy (EFP) is the use of equines to treat human psychological problems in and around an equestrian facility. It is not the same as therapeutic riding or hippotherapy. Though different organizations may prefer one term over the other for various reasons, in practice, the two terms are used interchangeably. Other terms commonly used, especially in Canada, include Equine Facilitated Wellness (EFW), Equine Facilitated Counselling (EFC) and Equine Facilitated Mental Health (EFMH). While some mental health therapies may incorporate vaulting and riding, most utilize groundwork with horses. Some programs only use ground-based work. There are also differences between programs over whether the horse is viewed as a co-facilitator, or simply as a tool. The field of equine-assisted psychotherapy did not publicly become a part of the equine-assisted therapy world until the 1990s, although individuals had been experimenting with the concept prior to that time. The first national group in the United States, the Equine-Facilitated Mental Health Association (EFMHA), now a part of PATH International, formed in 1996. The mental health area of equine-assisted therapy became subject to a major rift when a second group, the Equine Growth and Learning Association (EAGALA) formed in 1999, splitting from EFMHA (now PATH) over differences of opinion about safety protocols. Since that time, additional differences have arisen between the two groups over safety orientation, the therapeutic models used, training programs for practitioners, and the role of riding. EAGALA itself had a further split between its founders in 2006 due to legal issues, with yet another new organization formed. As a result, although PATH and EAGALA remain the two main certification organizations in the United States, there has been a significant amount of misunderstanding amongst practitioners, client, and within the scientific literature. To resolve these differences, an independent organization, the Certification Board for Equine Interaction Professionals (CBEIP) formed, beginning in 2007, to promote professional credibility in the field. However, the world of equine-assisted psychotherapy remains disorganized and has not standardized its requirements for education or credentialing.  History  Horses have been utilized as a therapeutic aid since the ancient Greeks used them for those people who had incurable illnesses. Its earliest recorded mention is in the writings of Hippocrates who discussed the therapeutic value of riding. The claimed benefits of therapeutic riding have been dated back to 17th century literature where it is documented that it was prescribed for gout, neurological disorder and low morale. In 1946 Equine Therapy was introduced in Scandinavia after an outbreak of poliomyelitis. Hippotherapy, as currently practiced was developed in the 1960s, when it began to be used in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland as an adjunct to traditional physical therapy. The treatment was conducted by a physiotherapist, a specially trained horse, and a horse handler. The physiotherapist gave directives to the horse handler as to the gait, tempo, cadence, and direction for the horse to perform. The movement of the horse was carefully modulated to influence neuromuscular changes in the patient. The first standardized hippotherapy curriculum would be formulated in the late 1980s by a group of Canadian and American therapists who travelled to Germany to learn about hippotherapy and would bring the new discipline back to North America upon their return. The discipline was formalized in the United States in 1992 with the formation of the American Hippotherapy Association (AHA). Since its inception, the AHA has established official standards of practice and formalized therapist educational curriculum processes for occupational, physical and speech therapists in the United States. Therapeutic riding as a therapy started with Liz Hartel from Denmark. Her legs were paralyzed from polio but with therapy she was able to win the silver medal for dressage in the 1952 Olympic Games. At about that time, in Germany, therapeutic riding was used to address orthopaedic dysfunctions such as scoliosis. The first riding centers in North America began in the 1960s and the North American Riding for the Handicapped Association (NARHA) was launched in 1969.Benda, W., Fredrickson, M., Flanagan, S., Zembreski-Ruple, J., & McGibbon, N. H. (2000). Animal-assisted therapy: A highly versatile modality. Complementary Medicine for the Physician, 5(6), 41-48. Therapeutic riding was introduced to the United States and Canada in 1960 with the formation of the Community Association of Riding of the Disabled (CARD). In the United States riding for the disabled developed as a form of recreation and as a means of motivation for education, as well as its therapeutic benefits. In 1969 the Cheff Therapeutic Riding Center for the Handicapped was established in Michigan, and remains the oldest center specifically for people with disabilities in the United States. The North American Riding for Handicapped Association (NARHA) was founded in 1969 to serve as an advisory body to the various riding for disabled groups across the United States and its neighboring countries. In 2011, NARHA changed its name to the Professional Association of Therapeutic Horsemanship (PATH) International.  Horses used  In most cases, horses are trained and selected specifically for therapy before being integrated into a program. Therapy programs choose horses of any breed that they find to be calm, even-tempered, gentle, serviceably sound, and well-trained both under saddle and on the ground. As most equine-assisted therapy is done at slow speeds, an older horse that is not in its athletic prime is sometimes used. Equine-assisted therapy programs try to identify horses that are calm but not lazy and physically suited with proper balance, structure, muscling and gaits. Muscling is not generally considered to be as important as the balance and structural correctness, but proper conditioning for the work it is to do is required. Suitable horses move freely and have good quality gaits, especially the walk. Unsound horses that show any signs of lameness are generally avoided. The welfare of the horse is taken into consideration. Each individual animal has natural biological traits but also has a unique personality with its own likes, dislikes and habits. Paying attention to what the animal is trying to communicate is helpful both in sessions of EAAT, but also to prevent burnout for the horse. Some programs refer to the therapy horse as an \\"equine partner\\". Other programs view the horse as a \\"metaphor\\" with no defined role other than to \\"be themselves.\\" Equine Facilitated Wellness programs, particularly those following the EFW-Canada certification route view the horse as 'sentient being': \\"The equine is a sentient being, partner and co- facilitator in the equine facilitated relationship and process\\".  Effectiveness  There is some evidence that hippotherapy can help improve the posture control of children with cerebral palsy, although the use of mechanical hippotherapy simulators produced no clear evidence of benefit. A systematic review of studies on the outcomes of horseback riding therapy on gross motor function in children with cerebral palsy was concluded in 2012 with a recommendation for a \\"large randomized controlled trial using specified protocols\\" because, although positive evidence was indicated by nine high- quality studies surveyed, the studies were too limited to be considered conclusive. Overall, reviews of equine-assisted therapy scientific literature indicate \\"there is no unified, widely accepted, or empirically supported, theoretical framework for how and why these interventions may be therapeutic\\" The journal Neurology published a 2014 study finding inadequate data to know whether hippotherapy or therapeutic horseback riding can help the gait, balance, or mood of people with multiple sclerosis. There is no evidence that therapeutic horseback riding is effective in treating children with autism. There is currently insufficient medical evidence to support the effectiveness of equine-related treatments for mental health. Multiple reviews have noted problems with the quality of research such as the lack of independent observers, rigorous randomized clinical trials, longitudinal studies, and comparisons to currently accepted and effective treatments. A 2014 review found these treatments did no physical harm, but found that all studies examined had methodological flaws, which led to questioning the clinical significance of those studies; the review also raised ethical concerns both about the marketing and promotion of the practice and the opportunity cost if patients in need of mental health services were diverted from evidence-based care. The review recommended that both individuals and organizations avoid this therapy unless future research establishes verifiable treatment benefits.  Accreditation and certification  The Professional Association of Therapeutic Horsemanship (PATH) accredits centers and instructors that provide equine-assisted therapy. The Equine Assisted Growth and Learning Association (EAGALA) focuses only on mental health aspects of human-equine interaction, and provides certification for mental-health and equine professionals. In Canada, centers and instructors for Therapeutic Riding are regulated by CanTRA, also known as The Canadian Therapeutic Riding Association. The field of Equine Facilitated Wellness is regulated by Equine Facilitated Wellness ‚Äì Canada (EFW-Can) which provides a national certification program and certifies trainers and mentors to provide independent training at approved programs across Canada. The American Hippotherapy Association offers certification for working as a hippotherapist. Hippotherapy Clinical Specialty (HPCS) Certification is a designation indicating board certification for therapists who have advanced knowledge and experience in hippotherapy. Physical therapists, occupational therapists, and speech-language pathologists in practice for at least three years (6,000 hours) and have 100 hours of hippotherapy practice within the prior three years are permitted to take the Hippotherapy Clinical Specialty Certification Examination through the American Hippotherapy Certification Board. Those who pass are board-certified in hippotherapy, and entitled to use the HPCS designation after their name. HPCS certification is for five years. After five years the therapist can either retake the exam or show written evidence of 120 hours of continuing education distributed over the five years. Continuing education must include 50% (60 hours) in education related to equine subject matter: psychology, training, riding skills and so on; 25% (30 hours) in education related to direct service in the professional discipline and 25% (30 hours) in any other subject related to hippotherapy. An alternative is to provide written evidence of scholarly activity appropriate to the field of hippotherapy. Acceptable scholarly activity may include graduate education in hippotherapy, publication of articles on hippotherapy in juried publications, scientific research related to hippotherapy, the teaching or development of hippotherapy, or acting as AHA-approved course faculty. AHA, Inc. now recognizes two different AHCB credentials: AHCB Certified Therapist and AHCB Certified Hippotherapy Clinical Specialist.

A few weeks later, the fleet under Husrev Pasha destroyed the population of Psara. =Central Greece= Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts, Bordeaux) Shortly after Lord Byron's death in 1824, the Turks arrived to besiege the Greeks once more at Missolonghi. Turkish commander Re≈üid Mehmed Pasha was joined by Ibrahim Pasha, who crossed the Gulf of Corinth, and during the early part of 1826, Ibrahim had more artillery and supply brought in. However, his men were unable to storm the walls, and in 1826, following a one-year siege, Turkish-Egyptian forces conquered the city on Palm Sunday, and exterminated almost its entire population. The attack increased support for the Greek cause in western Europe, with Eug√®ne Delacroix depicting the massacre in his painting Greece Expiring on the Ruins of Missolonghi. =Crete= During the great massacre of Heraklion on 24 June 1821, remembered in the area as \\"the great ravage\\" (\\"Œø ŒºŒµŒ≥Œ¨ŒªŒøœÇ Œ±œÅœÄŒµŒΩœÑŒ≠œÇ\\", \\"o megalos arpentes\\"), the Turks also killed the metropolite of Crete, Gerasimos Pardalis, and five more bishops: Neofitos of Knossos, Joachim of Herronissos, Ierotheos of Lambis, Zacharias of Sitia and Kallinikos, the titular bishop of Diopolis.Dr. Detorakis, Theocharis \\"Brief Historical Review of the Holy Archdiocese of Crete\\" After the Sultan's vassal in Egypt was sent to intervene with the Egyptian fleet on 1825, Muhammad Ali's son, Ibrahim, landed in Crete and began to massacre the majority Greek community. =Cyprus= In July 1821, the head of the Cypriot Orthodox Church Archbishop Kyprianos, along with 486 prominent Greek Cypriots, amongst them the Metropolitans Chrysanthethos of Paphos, Meletios of Kition and Lavrentios of Kyrenia, were executed by hanging or beheading by the Ottomans in Nicosia. The French consul M. M√©chain reported on 15 September 1821 that the local pasha, K√º√ß√ºk Mehmet, carried out several days of massacres in Cyprus since July 9 and continued on for forty days, despite the Vizier's command to end the plundering since 20 July 1821. On October 15, a massive Turkish Cypriot mob seized and hanged an Archbishop, five Bishops, thirty six ecclesiastics, and hanged most of the Greek Cypriots in Larnaca and the other towns. By September and October 1822, sixty two Greek Cypriot villages and hamlets had entirely disappeared and many people, including clerics, were massacred.F. Pouqueville, F., Histoire de la regeneration de la Grece, comprenant le precis des evenements depuis 1740 jusquen 1824. Par√≠s, Firmin Didot P√©re, 1825, vol. 3, pp 252. =Peloponnese= Historian David Brewer writes that in the first year of the revolution, a Turkish army descended on the city of Patras and slaughtered all of the civilians of the settlement, razing the city. The forces of Ibrahim Pasha were extremely brutal in the Peloponnese, burning the major port of Kalamata to the ground and slaughtering the city's inhabitants; they also ravaged the countryside and were heavily involved in the slave trade. =Macedonia= Greek villages in Macedonia were destroyed, and many of the inhabitants were put to death. Thomas Gordon reports executions of Greek civilians in Serres and Thessaloniki, beheadings of merchants and clergy, and seventy burnt villages. In May 1821, the governor Yusuf Bey ordered his men to kill any Greeks in Thessaloniki they found in the streets. Ha√Øroullah Effendi reported that then and \\"for days and nights the air was filled with shouts, wails, screams.\\" The Metropolitan bishop was brought in chains, together with other leading notables, and they were tortured and executed in the square of the flour market. Some were hanged from the plane trees around the Rotonda. Others were killed in the cathedral where they had fled for refuge, and their heads were gathered together as a present for Yusuf Bey. In 1822, Abdul Abud, the Pasha of Thessaloniki, arrived on 14 March at the head of a 16,000 strong force and 12 cannons against Naousa. The Greeks defended Naousa with a force of 4,000 under the overall command of Zafeirakis Theodosiou and Anastasios Karatasos. The Turks attempted to take the town on 16 March 1822, and on 18 and 19 March, without success. On 24 March the Turks began a bombardment of the city walls that lasted for days. After requests for the town's surrender were dismissed by the Greeks, the Turks charged the gate of St George on 31 March. The Turkish attack failed but on 6 April, after receiving fresh reinforcements of some 3,000 men, the Turkish army finally overcame the Greek resistance and entered the city. In an infamous incident, many of the women committed suicide by falling down a cliff over the small river Arapitsa. Abdul Abud laid the town and surrounding area to waste. The Greek population was massacred. The destruction of Naousa marked the end of the Greek revolution in Macedonia in 1822. Massacres of Turks and Muslim Albanians =Peloponnese= Siege of Tripolitsa According to historian William St. Clair, during the beginning of the Greek revolution upwards of twenty thousand Turkish men, women and children were killed by their Greek neighbors in a few weeks of slaughter. William St. Clair also argued that: \\"with the beginning of the revolt, the bishops and priests exhorted their parishioners to exterminate infidel Muslims.\\" St. Clair wrote: > The Turks of Greece left few traces. They disappeared suddenly and finally > in the spring of 1821 unmourned and unnoticed by the rest of the world....It > was hard to believe then that Greece once contained a large population of > Turkish descent, living in small communities all over the country, > prosperous farmers, merchants, and officials, whose families had known no > other home for hundreds of years...They were killed deliberately, without > qualm or scruple, and there was no regrets either then or later. Atrocities toward the Turkish civilian population inhabiting the Peloponnese had started in Achaia on the 28th of March, just with the beginning of the Greek revolt. On 2 April, the outbreak became general over the whole of Peloponnese and on that day many Turks were murdered in different places. On the third of April 1821, the Turks of Kalavryta surrendered upon promises of security which were afterwards violated. Followingly, massacres ensued against the Turkish civilians in the towns of Peloponnese that the Greek revolutionaries had captured. The Turks in Monemvasia, weakened by the famine opened the gates of the city, and laid down their weapons. Six hundred of them had already gone on board the brigs, when the Mainotes burst into the town and started murdering all those who had not yet reached to the shore or those who had chosen to stay in the town. Those on the ships meanwhile were stripped of their clothes, beaten and left on a desolate rock in the Aegean, instead of being deported to Asia Minor as promised. Only a few of them were saved by a French merchant, called M. Bonfort. A general massacre ensued the fall of Navarino on August 19, 1821. See Navarino Massacre. The worst Greek atrocity in terms of the numbers of victims involved was the massacre following the Fall of Tripolitsa in 1821: > For three days the miserable inhabitants were given over to lust and cruelty > of a mob of savages. Neither sex nor age was spared. Women and children were > tortured before being put to death. So great was the slaughter that > Kolokotronis himself says that, from the gate to the citadel his horse‚Äôs > hoofs never touched the ground. His path of triumph was carpeted with > corpses. At the end of two days, the wretched remnant of the Mussulmans were > deliberately collected, to the number of some two thousand souls, of every > age and sex, but principally women and children, were led out to a ravine in > the neighboring mountains and there butchered like cattle. Although the total estimates of the casualties vary, the Turkish, Muslim Albanian and Jewish population of the Peloponnese had ceased to exist as a settled community. Some estimates of the Turkish and Muslim Albanian civilian deaths by the rebels range from 15,000, 20,000 or more out of 40,000 Muslim residentsHeraclides, Alexis (2011). The essence of the Greek-Turkish rivalry: national narrative and identity. Academic Paper. The London School of Economics and Political Science. p. 15. \\"On the Greek side, a case in point is the atrocious onslaught of the Greeks and Hellenised Christian Albanians against the city of Tripolitza in October 1821, which is justified by the Greeks ever since as the almost natural and predictable outcome of more than ‚Äò400 years of slavery and dudgeon‚Äô. All the other similar atrocious acts all over Peloponnese, where apparently the whole population of Muslims (Albanian and Turkish-speakers), well over twenty thousand vanished from the face of the earth within a spat of a few months in 1821 is unsaid and forgotten, a case of ethnic cleansing through sheer slaughter (St Clair 2008: 1-9, 41-46) as are the atrocities committed in Moldavia (were the \\"Greek Revolution\\" actually started in February 1821) by prince Ypsilantis.\\" to 30,000 only in Tripolitsa.Bouboulina Museum, Spetses Greece (Publisher: Greek Island Spetses; Accessed: 2007-04-18) . Massacres of Turkish civilians started simultaneously with the outbreak of the revolt. Historian George Finlay claimed that the extermination of the Muslims in the rural districts was the result of a premeditated design and it proceeded more from the suggestions of men of letters, than from the revengeful feelings of the people. William St. Clair wrote that: \\"The orgy of genocide exhausted itself in the Peloponnese only when there were no more Turks to kill.\\" =Central Greece= In Athens, 1,190 Turks, of whom only 190 were capable of bearing arms, surrendered upon promises of security. W. Alison Phillips noted that: A scene of horror followed which has only too many parallels during the course of this horrible war. Vrachori, modern day Agrinio, was an important town in West-Central Greece. It contained, besides the Christian population, some five hundred Musulman families and about two hundred Jews. The massacres in Vrachori commenced with the Jews and soon Musulmans shared the same fate. =Aegean Islands= There were also massacres towards the Muslim inhabitants of the islands in the Aegean Sea, in the early years of the Greek revolt. According to historian William St. Clair, one of the aims of the Greek revolutionaries was to embroil as many Greek communities as possible in their struggle. Their technique was \\"to engineer some atrocity against the local Turkish population\\", so that these different Greek communities would have to ally themselves with the revolutionaries fearing a retaliation from the Ottomans. In such a case, in March 1821, Greeks from Samos island had landed in the Chios and attacked the Muslim population living in that island. The crews and passengers of Turkish ships captured by Greek cruisers were often put to death: two hydriot brigs captured a Turkish ship laden with a valuable cargo, and carrying a number of passengers. Among these was a recently deposed Sheikh-ul-Islam, or patriarch of the Orthodox Muslims, who was said to be going to Mecca for pilgrimage. It was his efforts to prevent the cruel reprisals which, at Constantinople, followed the news of the massacres in Peloponnese, which brought him into disfavor, and caused his exile. There were also several other Turkish families on board. British historian of the Greek revolt, W. Alison Phillips, noted (drawing from Finlay): The Hydriots murdered them all in cold blood, helpless old men, ladies of rank, beautiful slaves, and little children were butchered like cattle. The venerable old man, whose crime had been an excess of zeal on behalf of the Greeks, was forced to see his family outraged and murdered before his eyes... Massacres of Jews Steven Bowman claims that despite the fact that many Jews were killed, they were not targeted specifically: \\"Such a tragedy seems to be more a side-effect of the butchering of the Turks of Tripolis, the last Ottoman stronghold in the South where the Jews had taken refuge from the fighting, than a specific action against Jews per se.\\" However, in the case of Vrachori, a massacre of a Jewish population occurred first, and the Jewish population in the Peloponnese regardless was effectively decimated, unlike that of the considerable Jewish populations of the Aegean, Epirus and other areas of Greece in the several following conflicts between Greeks and the Ottomans later in the century. Many Jews within Greece and throughout Europe were however supporters of the Greek revolt, and many assisted the Greek cause. Following the state's establishment, it also then attracted many Jewish immigrants from the Ottoman Empire, as one of the first European states in the world to grant legal equality to Jews.

He was a professor at the √âcole Centrale des Arts et Manufactures, √âcole Polytechnique and √âcole des Ponts et Chauss√©es in France. In hydraulic engineering, he is often credited improperly for the application of the momentum principle to a hydraulic jump in a rectangular open channel in 1828. His true contribution in 1828 was the development of the backwater equation for gradually varied flows in open channels and the application of the momentum principle to the hydraulic jump flow in 1838. Life of B√©langer Born in Valenciennes on 4 April 1790, B√©langer was the son of Charles Antoine Aim√© Joseph B√©langer, master locksmith, and of Jeanne Fran√ßoise Joseph . He studied in Paris at the √âcole Polytechnique and later at the √âcole des Ponts et Chauss√©es. As Ing√©nieur du Corps des Ponts et Chauss√©es, he started his engineering career in 1816 at La R√©ole. From 1821, he moved to work on the Somme navigation canal and after 1826 on the Ardennes navigation canal. It was during these two missions that he studied specifically the hydraulics of gradually varied open channel flows. He later became a lecturer at the √âcole Centrale des Arts et Manufactures between 1838 and 1864, at the √âcole des Ponts et Chauss√©es from 1841 to 1855, and at the √âcole Polytechnique from 1851 to 1860. At the √âcole Centrale, one of his students was Gustave Eiffel (1832‚Äì1923) who built the Eiffel tower and engraved B√©langer's name around the first floor together with the names of 71 other scientists. Jean-Baptiste B√©langer retired in 1864 and died on 8 May 1874 at Neuilly-sur-Seine where his body was buried. Contribution to open channel hydraulics During his professional career, his 1828 treatise was a major contribution to modern open channel hydraulics. The work was focused on the study of gradually varied open channel flows. The originality of essay was the successful development of the backwater equation for steady, one- dimensional gradually varied flows in an open channel, together with the introduction of the step method, distance calculated from depth, and the concept of critical flow conditions. In 1828, B√©langer understood the rapidly varied nature of the jump flow, but he applied incorrectly the Bernoulli principle to the hydraulic jump. The correct application of momentum considerations to the hydraulic jump flow was derived 10 years later and first published by him in 1841 as part of a series of lecture notes for the √âcole nationale des ponts et chauss√©es. His notes formed a comprehensive treatise in hydraulic engineering. They were re-edited several times and used at the √âcole des Ponts et Chauss√©es and √âcole Centrale des Arts et Manufactures, and available at the √âcole Polytechnique et √âcole des Mines de Paris. Altogether B√©langer's 1828, and 1841 contributions to modern open channel hydraulics were remarkable and influenced the works by Jacques Antoine Charles Bresse, Henry Darcy, Henry √âmile Bazin, Adh√©mar Jean Claude Barr√© de Saint-Venant, and Joseph Valentin Boussinesq, as well as Philipp Forchheimer and Boris Bakhmeteff. Contribution to applied mechanics From 1851, as a full professor at the √âcole Polytechnique, he developed a new university curriculum in mechanics (cours de M√©canique) in response to a re-structure of the engineering programme at √âcole Polytechnique. Linking kinematics and dynamics, he argued that the mechanics is based upon three principles: inertia, action- reaction and constant ratio force to acceleration at any point. Among the innovations, he considered statics as a limited case of dynamics which was most innovative in France at the time. His basic ideas were first developed in his 1847 lecture notes, and they influenced many leading scholars in France and overseas. For example, Franz Reuleaux (1829‚Äì1905) respected highly text; Ernst Mach (1838‚Äì1916) listed B√©langer's 1847 treatise among a few basic references in Mechanics. An unusual aspect of B√©langer‚Äôs career was his most successful involvement in both professional engineering (1816‚Äì1838) and academic teaching (1838‚Äì1864), as well as his capabilities to develop fundamental new textbooks, widely respected in France and overseas (Chanson 2010).

He was the son of Charles Hayter (1728‚Äì1795), an architect and builder from Hampshire, and his wife, Elizabeth Holmes. He first trained with his father, but showed an inclination for drawing by producing some small pencil portraits, principally of family members. He was enrolled in the Royal Academy Schools in London in 1786 at the late age of about 25. From then on, he worked as a painter of portrait miniatures in London, and also Essex, and in 1832 in Winchester. He exhibited 113 portrait miniatures between 1786 and 1832, principally at the Royal Academy, and had a reputation for creating a good likeness. Hayter married Martha Stevenson in 1788. His two sons and daughter were all successful artists; Sir George Hayter (1792‚Äì1871), John Hayter (1800‚Äì1895), and Anne Hayter who, like her father, was a miniature painter. Charles Hayter taught perspective (on which he was an authority) to Princess Charlotte, King George IV's daughter, to whom he was later appointed Professor in Perspective and Drawing. He also dedicated to her his book An Introduction to perspective, adapted to the capacities of youth, in a series of pleasing and familiar dialogues, first published in 1813 in London. He later published A New Practical Treatise on the Three Primitive Colours Assumed as a Perfect System of Rudimentary Information (London 1826), in which he described how all colours could be obtained from just three.

After graduation he earned a Master of Business Administration at Stanford University before beginning his military career at Fort Campbell. Vietnam War and Medal of Honor Bucha was sent to Vietnam in 1967 as a captain and commander of Company D, 3rd Battalion, 187th Infantry Regiment. On March 16, 1968, he and his company of 89 men were dropped by helicopter southwest of Ph∆∞·ªõc Vƒ©nh, in B√¨nh D∆∞∆°ng Province. The area was believed to be a North Vietnamese stronghold and Bucha's unit was tasked with seeking out and engaging the enemy forces. For two days Company D encountered light resistance as it cleared North Vietnamese positions. On the afternoon of March 18, the company's lead group of about twelve men stumbled upon a full North Vietnamese army battalion that had stopped to camp for the night. The lead element came under heavy fire and was pinned down. Bucha crawled toward them and destroyed a North Vietnamese bunker. He returned to the company perimeter and ordered a withdrawal to a more defensible position. Throughout the night he encouraged his men, distributed ammunition, and directed artillery and helicopter gunship fire. At one point he stood exposed and used flashlights to direct helicopters which were evacuating the wounded and bringing in supplies. The next morning, as the North Vietnamese forces withdrew, he led a party to rescue those soldiers who had been cut off from the rest of the company. Once his tour in the Vietnam War ended in April 1970, Bucha returned to the United States and taught Political Science at West Point. It was during this time that he learned he had been awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions in the battle near Phuoc Vinh. The medal was presented to him on May 14, 1970, by President Richard Nixon. Later life Bucha (2nd from left) at the 2009 New York City Veterans Day parade Bucha left the army in 1972. He worked as chief of operations in Iran for Ross Perot's company, Electronic Data Systems (EDS). When several EDS employees were detained during the 1979 Iranian Revolution, he was involved in the effort to free them. He then started his own company, which found American partners for foreign investors. With a French real estate developer he formed a joint venture which began the development of Port Libert√©, New Jersey. He later worked as chairman of the board of Wheeling- Pittsburgh Steel Corporation and was president of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society. He sits on the Board of Directors to a number of organizations and companies, including Veterans Advantage, a Public Benefit Corporation that creates exclusive benefits and discounts for the military community, of which he has been an advisory board member since its founding by Lin and Scott Higgins in 2000. Bucha is active in political affairs and campaigned for Barack Obama during the 2008 presidential election. Bucha unsuccessfully ran as a Republican for the United States House of Representatives in New York in 1993. Bucha is an honorary member of the Rhode Island Commandery of the Military Order of Foreign Wars. He lives in Ridgefield, Connecticut, with his wife Cynthia. He has four children.

This Pre-Code crime film is about a racketeer's daughter who is in love with a shooting gallery showman. Despite her prodding, the showman known as The Kid has no ambitions about joining the rackets and making enough money to support her in the lifestyle she's accustomed to. Her father implicates her in a murder and she's sent to prison, after which her father convinces The Kid to join the gang to free his daughter. Plot Sylvia Sidney and Paul Lukas in a scene from the film. Nan Cooley (Sylvia Sidney), the daughter of racketeer Pop Cooley (Guy Kibbee), is in love with The Kid (Gary Cooper), a shooting gallery showman. Cooley tries to urge him to join the gang, in order to earn enough money to support her in the lifestyle she is accustomed to, but The Kid refuses. Soon her father kills bootlegging chief Blackie (Stanley Fields), at the urging of Big Fella Maskal (Paul Lukas), because Blackie was against Maskal's involvement with Blackie's gun moll Aggie (Wynne Gibson). After Pop shoots Blackie, he passes the gun to Nan, thus implicating her in the murder. She na√Øvely takes the rap, believing the mob will arrange for her acquittal, but is sent to prison. Pop Cooley tries to convince The Kid to join the gang to free Nan, and he does so out of love for her. However, her attitude had changed since she was railroaded to prison. When The Kid visits Nan in prison in a fur coat, she becomes terrified of his involvement with Pop's gang after witnessing a fellow inmate's mobster boyfriend being gunned down outside the prison gate. When Nan is released, having served her term, she wants nothing more to do with the mob. She tries to persuade The Kid to quit the gang, but he refuses. Things go downhill from there. She finds that her father is unrepentant and involved with a loose, gold-digging woman named Pansy (Betty Sinclair). Maskal soon takes a strong liking to Nan and throws her a homecoming party, forcing her to dance with him all evening. When The Kid finally asserts his claim over Nan, Maskal threatens him, then later sends his thugs to kill him, but The Kid successfully disarms them, then goes after Maskal. Terrified her lover will be killed, Nan goes to Maskal to warn him and offers herself to him in exchange for The Kid's life. Aggie, now Maskal's mistress, shoots him with Nan's gun after he leaves her for Nan, and Nan is accused of murder. The Kid then names himself mob chief and escapes with Nan in a car with three of Maskal's men, but they aim to kill him. The Kid and Nan are then taken \\"for a ride\\" by rival thugs. They race a train and maintain high speeds. Nan pulls a gun on the men and disarms them. Dropping the thugs off with \\"no hard feelings\\", The Kid tells them he has quit the beer business, and he and Nan drive off.

It was the second of three music festivals held on the island between 1968 and 1970. Organised by Rikki Far, Ronnie and Ray Foulk's Fiery Creations, it became a legendary event, largely owing to the participation of Dylan, who had spent the previous three years in semi-retirement.Alan Clayson, George Harrison, Sanctuary (London, 2003), p. 274. The event was well managed, in comparison to the recent Woodstock Festival, and trouble-free. Bob Dylan The 1969 festival was considerably larger and more popular than the previous year's. Dylan had been little heard of since his allegedly near-fatal motorcycle accident in July 1966.

Dylan was initially reluctant to perform his comeback show on the little-known Isle of Wight. After weeks of negotiations, the Foulk brothers showed him a short film of the island's cultural and literary heritage; this appealed to Dylan's artistic sensibilities, as he was enthusiastic about combining a family holiday with a live performance in Tennyson country.John Harris, \\"A Quiet Storm\\", Mojo, July 2001, p. 69. The family was scheduled to travel to Britain on the QE2 and nearly missed the gig completely when Dylan's son Jesse was hit by a cabin door and had to be hospitalised. He instead travelled by plane at the last minute.

The governing body is the Sierra Leone Football Association (SLFA). The SLFA was formed in 1960 and has been affiliated with FIFA beginning the same year. There has been and continues to be trouble within the sport in Sierra Leone. In the past, however, the country has achieved a modicum of success in international competition. National competition The Sierra Leone National Premier League is the top football league in Sierra Leone, with 14 teams. At the completion of each season, the two worst teams are relegated to the second tier, and their places taken by promoted teams. East End Lions and Mighty Blackpool are the two biggest and most successful football clubs, but Kallon F.C. is also improving, winning the Premier League in 2006. The Sierra Leone FA Cup is the national knockout competition. It was established in 1967. Sierra Leonean teams, as well as those of other African countries, have to compete with European football, especially the English Premier League, for the hearts of fans. The country is home to the one of the largest Manchester City supporters club outside of the UK. In 2009 and 2010, fans and supporters of Manchester City raised funds to send a second-hand bus to Sierra Leone to provide transport for away games. International competition The Sierra Leone national football team is popularly known as the Leone Stars and represents the country in international football competitions. Though the team has never qualified for the FIFA World Cup, they did participate in the 1994 and 1996 African Cup of Nations. On 3 September 2016, the national team had a chance to qualify for the Africa Cup for the first time in 20 years if they could defeat Ivory Coast, but could only manage a 1-1 draw in an away match. The top two Premier League teams represent the country in the Confederation of African Football (CAF) Champions League and Confederation Cup. Kallon F.C. eliminated 2006 Nigerian Premier League Champions Ocean Boys FC in the 2007 CAF Champions League first qualifying round, but later lost to ASEC Mimosas of Ivory Coast in the second qualifying round for the group stage. The Sierra Leone U-17 football team, nicknamed the Sierra Stars, finished as runner-up at the 2003 African U-17 Championship in Swaziland, falling 1-0 to Cameroon, but came in last place in their group at the 2003 FIFA U-17 World Championship in Finland. The women's national team is known as the Sierra Queens. Troubled decade: 2010s Football match promoting gender equality in Sierra Leone. The 2010s have proven to be a decade of turmoil for the sport in Sierra Leone. The outbreak of Ebola in western Africa resulted in the Confederation of African Football instituting a ban preventing Sierra Leone, as well as Liberia and Guinea, from playing home games within the country beginning in August 2014; only after Sierra Leone was declared Ebola-free was the ban lifted in December 2015. (Liberia's ban ended in September 2015, and Guinea's in January 2016.) From 2013 to the middle of 2016, there were two FA Cups and one league season. In June 2014, allegations were made that two football officials and a national under-20 coach fixed two matches, in 2008 and 2009. There is also ongoing dissatisfaction harboured by fans and teams against the SLFA, headed by Isha Johansen. On 9 December 2015, the National Sport Council decided to dissolve the SLFA's executive committee. The SLFA, however, refused to accept the decision. Attendance is low at SLFA-organised games, even one where entry was free. 11 of 14 of the premier league teams formed a breakaway league that ended in early 2016; it also failed to attract large crowds. Six premier league teams boycotted the 2016 FA Cup. On 7 September 2016, SLFA President Isha Johansen, Vice President Brima Kamara and Secretary General Christopher Kamara were jailed by the Anti-Corruption Commission for failing to provide reports regarding the SLFA's financial statements and the use of money. The trio were released after posting bail. FIFA defended the SLFA in a letter, stating, \\"FIFA has no reason to suspect there has been misuse of funds that FIFA has provided to the SLFA\\", having audited the SLFA's accounts earlier in the year.

Additionally, typical batch plant opening fees for after-hours works do not apply. History The history of volumetric mixing comes from several directions; *The mobile mixer was patented in 1964 by Harold Zimmerman, in Ephrata, Pennsylvania, USA. Because of the patents, there was only one equipment manufacturer until the 1980s. * Equipment manufacturers created an association, Volumetric Mixer Manufacturers Bureau (VMMB), in 1999, with six charter members including Zimmerman Ind, Inc., ProAll Reimer, Bay-Lynx, Custom-Crete, Elkin and Cementech. Advantages and disadvantages *Reduces wastage and associated costs by providing exact quantities. *No risk of premature stiffening of concrete if delays are encountered. *Permits delivery of smaller quantities of concrete. *Night time works do not require the re-opening of a concrete batch plant. *Flexibility to alternate between multiple concrete mixes as required for the application. Modified models The volumetric mixer varies in capacity size up to 12 m3 and has a production rate around 60m3 an hour depending on the mix design.

In 2003, 40% of park visitors entered the park at the Falcon Lake checkpoint. The Falcon Lake Golf Course is an 18-hole public course designed by Norman H. Woods. The course was constructed in 1957‚Äì58 and opened in 1958. Falcon Beach Ranch offers horseback riding, sleigh and wagon rides. A riding stable at this location first began operation in 1959. The Falcon Ridge Ski Slopes, established in 1960, offers alpine and cross-country skiing. A biathlon range was added to the facility in the mid-1980s as the host site for the Junior National Biathlon competition. and continues to be used for training and events. It is the site of the Falcon Lake Floppet, a nordic ski event held annually since 2018. It is the birthplace of Megan Imrie, Canadian biathlete. Beaver Days, an annual winter festival and fundraiser for the Whiteshell Community Club began in 1975. It includes a wide array of winter activities including snowmobiling, skiing, hockey, horse-drawn sleigh rides and skating. The Falcon Lake Winter fish-off has been held annually since 2004. Hundreds of anglers gather to see who can catch the heaviest fish from the grid of holes the organizers have drilled through the ice.

Despite being an amateur recreational surfer rather than a professional competitive surfer, he is widely considered a role model for his part in the history of surfing and African American history in the areas of Santa Monica and California. Gabald√≥n was born February 23, 1927 in Los Angeles, California. His mother was Black and his father was Latino. Very little is known of his childhood. He lived most of his life in Santa Monica, California and was one of 50 black students at Santa Monica High School during the 1940s. Gabald√≥n taught himself how to surf at a 200-foot roped off stretch of demarcated beach which was part of Santa Monica State Beach. This area of beachfront was informally referred to by names such as \\"Ink Well Beach\\", \\"Negro Beach\\", and other more derogatory names. In 1924, after the forced closure of black owned and operated Bruce's Beach and due to de facto segregation, that portion of beachfront near Bay Street and Ocean Boulevard became the only place in Southern California that racial minorities were freely allowed to use without harassment or violence. The area remains popular with African American Angelenos up through present day. Accomplishments After serving in the Navy Reserve during World War II, Gabald√≥n enrolled in Santa Monica College, where he divided his time between pursuing his studies, surfing and working as a lifeguard. Around 1949, Gabald√≥n began surfing in Malibu, California at Surfrider Beach where he was accepted without question by several mainland surf pioneers. His friends and surf contemporaries included Greg Noll, Mickey Munoz, Ricky Grigg, Matt Kivlin, Buzzy Trent, Robert Wilson Simmons aka \\"Bob Simmons\\". and Les Williams. Since he did not own a vehicle, Gabald√≥n would either get there by hitchhiking on the Pacific Coast Highway, or he would use his surfboard to paddle the 12 miles to Malibu by way of Santa Monica Bay. According to the Encyclopedia of Surfing, Gabald√≥n did this water commute each day for several weeks. On June 5, 1951 (some reports cite June 6), Gabald√≥n died when he crashed into the Malibu Pier while attempting a surfing move known as a \\"pier ride\\" or \\"shooting the pier\\". At that time, there was a south swell that came on, creating some of the biggest waves known in that area. Gabald√≥n's surfboard was found immediately, but it would be 3 to 4 days before his body was found washed up on Las Flores Beach, further east of the Pier. The coroner ruled that Gabald√≥n died as a result of drowning. Most of his Malibu-based surfing peers had attended Gabald√≥n's rosary. His funeral was held at St. Monica Catholic Church, Santa Monica. He is buried in Woodlawn Memorial Cemetery. Six days prior to his death, Gabald√≥n had submitted a poem for submission to the Santa Monica College literary magazine. It was entitled \\"Lost Lives\\" where he describes the sea as \\"capricious\\", \\"vindictive\\" and where men \\"do battle but still die.\\" Some see the poem as being somewhat prophetic in light of how he died. The poem was published in its entirety in the now defunct newspaper Santa Monica Evening Outlook There is also a brief reference to Gabald√≥n's death in the 1957 novel, \\"Gidget\\" by Frederick Kohner. He is not mentioned by name, but in the story, the protagonist, Franzie, refers to her parents being opposed to her surfing because of what happened to that \\"colored boy\\" who crashed into the pier. No such reference is made in any of the subsequent films. On September 7, 2007, officials for the City of Santa Monica announced plans to commemorate the stretch of Santa Monica State Beach called the Ink Well, and to post a plaque to honor Gabaldon's contribution to the sport of surf. The plaque was officially dedicated on February 7, 2008.

These buildings modify the natural environment in such a way that the overall ecosystem builds upon the change, making beavers a keystone species. Beavers work at night and are prolific builders, carrying mud and stones with their fore-paws and timber between their teeth. Construction Beaver dam in Lassen Volcanic National Park Bear Creek, a tributary to the Truckee River, in Alpine Meadows, California A minimum water level of is required to keep the underwater entrance to beaver lodges from being blocked by ice during the winter. In lakes, rivers and large streams with deep enough water, beavers may not build dams and instead live in bank burrows and lodges. If the water is not deep enough to keep beavers safe from predators and their lodge entrances ice-free, beavers build dams. Beavers start construction by diverting the stream to lessen the water's flow pressure. Branches and logs are then driven into the mud of the stream bed to form a base. Then sticks, bark (from deciduous trees), rocks, mud, grass, leaves, masses of plants, and anything else available, are used to build the superstructure. The average height of a dam is about with an average depth of water behind the dam of 1.2 to 1.8 m. The thickness of the dam is often around 1 m or more. The length depends on the stream width, but averages about 4.5 m long. Beavers vary the type of dam built and how they build it, according to the speed of water on the stream. In slow-moving water, they build a straight dam, whereas in fast-moving water they tend to be curved. Spillways and passageways are built into the dam to allow excess water to drain off without damaging it. Dams are generally built wider at the base and the top is usually tilted upstream to resist the force of the current. Beavers can transport their own weight in material; they drag logs along mudslides and float them through canals to get them in place. Once the dam has flooded enough area to the proper depth to form a protective moat for the lodge (often covering many acres), beavers begin construction on the lodge. Trees approaching a diameter of may be used to construct a dam, although the average is 10 to 30 cm. The length depends on the diameter of the tree and the size of the beaver. There are recorded cases of beavers felling logs of as much 45 m tall and 115 cm in diameter. Logs of this size are not intended to be used as structural members of the dam, but rather the bark is used for food, and sometimes to get at upper branches. It takes a beaver about 20 minutes to cut down a 15 cm wide aspen, by gnawing a groove around the trunk in an hourglass shape. A beaver's jaws are so powerful they can cut a 1.5 cm sapling in one bite. Maintenance work on the dam and lodges is particularly heavy in autumn. Furthermore, if beavers are considered central place foragers, then their canals may be considered an extension of their \\"central place\\" far beyond the lodge, according to a 2004-2012 study that mapped beaver ponds and cut stumps. =Extreme size= Beaver dams typically range in length from a few meters to about . Additionally, canals can be over in length. The largest beaver dam known to exist is in Wood Buffalo National Park in Alberta, Canada and measures in length. Satellite photos provided by NASA World Wind show the dam did not exist in 1975 but it appeared in subsequent images. It has two or more lodges and is a combination of two original dams. Google Earth images show new dams being built which could ultimately join the main dam and increase the overall length by another 50 to 100 m during the next decade. Coordinates: 58¬∞16'15\\"N 112¬∞15'6\\"W Another large beaver dam measuring long, high and thick at the base was found in Three Forks, Montana. =As tool use= It is claimed by some that by building dams, beavers are expressing tool use behaviour. However, the definition of tool use by animals is highly contentious. For example, it has been argued that like bird nests, beaver dams are too large to be picked up by the animal and therefore cannot be classified as a tool. However, the cutting down of trees, preparing them for use, transporting them to the dam and then inserting them into the structure is consistent with other definitions of tool use. Benefits Beaver dam in winter in Mont M√©gantic Dam building can be very beneficial in restoring wetlands. Such wetland benefits include flood control downstream, biodiversity (by providing habitat for many rare as well as common species), and water cleansing, both by the breakdown of toxins such as pesticides and the retention of silt by beaver dams. Over the years, this collection of silt produces the rich bottomland so sought after by farmers. Beaver dams reduce erosion as well as decrease the turbidity that is a limiting factor for much aquatic life. While beavers can create damage, part of the problem is one of perception and time scale. Such damage as the undermining of a roadway or the drowning of some trees is very visible shortly after the beginning of beavers' activity in an area. The benefits may be long- term and unnoticed except, for example, by someone monitoring a catchment. Almost half of endangered and threatened species in North America rely upon wetlands. In 2012, a systematic review was conducted on the impacts of beaver dams on fishes and fish habitat (biased to North America (88%)). The most frequently cited benefits of beaver dams were increased habitat heterogeneity, rearing and overwintering habitat and flow refuge, and invertebrate production. Impeded fish movement because of dams, siltation of spawning habitat and low oxygen levels in ponds were the most often cited negative impacts. Benefits (184) were cited more frequently than costs (119).Kemp, P.S., Worthington, T.A., Langford, E.L., Tree, A.R.J. and Gaywood, M.J., (2012). Qualitative and quantitative effects of reintroduced beavers on stream fish. Fish and Fisheries, 13(2): 158‚Äì181 DOI:10.1111/j.1467-2979.2011.00421.x Beaver dam as depicted in Frances Fuller Victor's 1887 book Eleven years in the Rocky Mountains and a life on the frontier. =Flood control= A beaver dam has a certain amount of freeboard above the water level. When heavy rains occur, the river or lake fills up and the dam gradually releases the extra stored water. Often this is all that is necessary to reduce the height of the flood wave moving down the river, and will reduce or eliminate damage to human structures. Flood control is achieved in other ways as well. The surface of any stream intersects the surrounding water table. By raising the stream level, the gradient of the surface of the water table above the beaver dam is reduced, and water near the beaver dam flows more slowly into the stream. This further helps in reducing flood waves, and increases water flow when there is no rain. Beaver dams also smooth out water flow by increasing the area wetted by the stream. This allows more water to seep into the ground where its flow is slowed. This water eventually finds its way back to the stream. Rivers with beaver dams in their head waters have lower high water and higher low water levels. Beaver dams also have a tendency to raise the water table, both in mineral soil environments and in wetlands such as peatlands. In peatlands particularly, they can stabilize the often fluctuating water table, which controls the levels of both carbon and water. In a 2017 study of beaver dam hydrology, monitored beaver dams in a Rocky Mountain peatland were found to increase groundwater storage and regional water balance, which can be beneficial for preventing drought. The study also suggested potential to improve carbon sequestration. =Excess nutrient removal= Beavers that work on top of heavy snowfall make cuts that are high above ground Beaver ponds can cause the removal of nutrients from the stream flow. Farming along the banks of rivers often increases the loads of phosphates, nitrates and other nutrients, which can cause eutrophication and may contaminate drinking water. Besides silt, the beaver dam collects twigs and branches from the beavers' activity and leaves, notably in the fall. The main component of this material is cellulose, a polymer of Œ≤-glucose monomers (This creates a more crystalline structure than is found in starch, which is composed of Œ±-glucose monomers. Cellulose is a type of polysaccharide.) Many bacteria produce cellulase which can split off the glucose and use it for energy. Just as algae get their energy from sunlight, these bacteria get their energy from cellulose, and they form the base of a very similar food chain. However, a source of energy is not enough for growth. These bacterial populations face serious shortages of nitrogen and phosphorus compounds, and will absorb these nutrients as they pass by in the water stream. In this way, these and other nutrients are fixed into the beaver pond and the surrounding ecology, and are removed from the stream. =Pesticide and herbicide removal= Agriculture also introduces herbicides and pesticides into streams. Some of these toxicants are metabolized and decomposed by the bacteria in the cellulose-rich bottom of a beaver dam.'' =Denitrification= Some scientists believe that the nitrogen cascade, the production of far more fixed nitrogen than the natural cycles can turn back into nitrogen gas, may be as much of a problem to our ecology as carbon dioxide production . Studies have shown, that beaver dams along a stream contribute to denitrification (the conversion of nitrogen compounds back into nitrogen). Bacteria in the dirt and the plant debris, which collects at the dams, turns nitrates into nitrogen gas. The gas bubbles up to the surface and mixes with the atmosphere once more. =Salmon and trout= Large European beaver dam near Olden, J√§mtland, Sweden Beaver dams and the associated ponds can provide nurseries for salmon and trout. An early indication of this was seen following the 1818 agreement between the British government of Canada and the government of America allowing Americans access to the Columbia watershed. The Hudson's Bay Company, in a fit of pique, instructed its trappers to extirpate the fur-bearing animals in the area. The beaver was the first to be made locally extinct. Salmon runs fell precipitously in the following years, even though none of the factors associated with the decline of salmon runs were extant at that time. There are several reasons why beaver dams increase salmon runs. They produce ponds that are deep enough for juvenile salmon to hide from predatory wading birds. They trap nutrients in their ecology and notably the huge nutrient pulse represented by the migration of the adult salmon upstream. These nutrients help feed the juveniles after the yolk sac has been digested. The dams provide calm water which means that the young salmon can use energy for growth rather than for fighting currents; larger smolts with a food reserve have a better rate of survival when they reach the sea. Finally, beaver dams keep the water clear which favours all salmonoids. =Frogs= Beaver dams have been shown to be beneficial to frog and toad populations, likely because they provide protected areas for larvae to mature in warm, well-oxygenated water. This is important because this type of water enhances the development and growth of frog and toad larvae. A study in Alberta, Canada, showed that \\"Pitfall traps on beaver ponds captured 5.7 times more newly metamorphosed wood frogs, 29 times more western toads and 24 times more boreal chorus frogs than on nearby free-flowing streams.\\" =Birds= Beaver dams help migrating songbirds. By stimulating the growth of species of plants that are critical to populations of songbirds in decline, beaver dams help create food and habitat for populations of songbirds in decline. The presence of beaver dams has been shown to be associated with an increased diversity of songbirds. They can also have positive effects on local waterfowl, such as ducks, that are in need of high‚Äêquality habitats. Stream life cycle Drained beaver pond in Allegany State Park =Wetland creation= If a beaver pond becomes too shallow due to sediment accumulation, or if the tree supply is depleted, beavers will abandon the site. Eventually the dam will be breached and the water will drain out. The rich thick layer of silt, branches, and dead leaves behind the old dam is the ideal habitat for wetland species. Many may have been on the fringes of the pond. Wetlands have significant environmental benefits. =Meadow creation= As the wetland fills up with plant debris and dries out, pasture species colonize it and the wetland becomes a meadow suitable for grazing in an area with nothing but forest down to the stream edge. This provides a valuable niche for many animals which otherwise would be excluded. =Riverine forest= Finally the meadow will be colonized by riverine trees, typically aspens, willows and such species which are favoured by the beaver. Beavers are then likely to recolonize the area, and the cycle begins again. =Bottomland= Each time the stream life cycle repeats itself another layer of rich organic soil is added to the bottom of the valley. The valley slowly fills and the flat area at the bottom gets wider. Research is sparse, but it seems likely that much of the fabled bottomland in North America was created, or at least added to, by the efforts of the generations of beavers that lived there. Disruption Canoeists try unsuccessfully to run a beaver dam in Algonquin Park. The dam is about high. An experimental pipe through a beaver dam, placed to allow migratory fish to cross through the dam during their spawning season Beaver dams can be disruptive; the flooding can cause extensive property damage, and when the flooding occurs next to a railroad roadbed, it can cause derailments by washing out the tracks, or when a beaver dam bursts and the resulting flash flood overwhelms a culvert. Traditional solutions to beaver problems have been focused on the trapping and removal of all the beavers in the area. While this is sometimes necessary, it is typically a short-lived solution, as beaver populations have made a remarkable comeback in the United States (after near extirpation in the nineteenth century) and are likely to continually recolonize suitable habitat. Modern solutions include relatively cost-effective and low maintenance flow devices. As for the dams, their construction is often too solid for them to be broken up manually or torn apart by machinery. One effective method for removing beaver dams is through the usage of dynamite. Introduced to an area without its natural predators, as in Tierra del Fuego, beavers have flooded thousands of acres of land and are considered a plague. One notable difference in Tierra del Fuego from most of North America is that the trees in Tierra del Fuego cannot be coppiced as can willows, poplars, aspens, and other North American trees. Thus the damage by the beavers seems more severe. The beaver's disruption is not limited to human geography; beavers can destroy nesting habitat for endangered species.

It was first published in the journal Poetry in October, 1919, so it is in the public domain. Some interpreters understand the poem as an expression of Heraclitus's philosophy that all is flux. Others classify it as among those poems that are all about style, with no content to speak of. The poet Mark Strand takes a different tack, assuring the reader that in order to understand this poem, \\"[O]ne only has to remember the perpetual undulation has not only to do with the recurrent motion of the waves but the desired motion of the hand as it writes. The poetry of the subject makes reference to sea and beaches, whereas the true subject of the poem is Stevens's craft as a poet. Writing is a solitary vocation, a place for \\"the solitaires\\" who must practise continual motion of thought and inscription. As usual Stevens is willing to communicate, but does not go out of his way to make his meaning plain. \\"One does not write for any reader except one,\\" as he says in Adagia,Kermode, p. 905 and also, less solipsistically, \\"Poetry must resist the intelligence almost successfully.\\"Kermode, Adagia, p. 910 Other writers and immigrants to the world of thought can perhaps be inspired by \\"The place of the solitaires\\" as a response to the solitary and somewhat melancholy life of the mind. (Adagia: \\"Poetry is a form of melancholia.\\"Kermode, p. 903) The poetry of the subject is paramount, and to that extent it is important to appreciate the poem's syntactic structure and its evocation of a Heraclitian mood. This primacy is why \\"Poetry is not a personal matter\\".Kermode, Adagia, p. 903 Yet poems have roots in the poet's life. They have subjects \\"that are the symbols of one's self or of one of one's selves\\".Kermode, Adagaia, p. 904. See also \\"Le Monocle de Mon Oncle\\" for the distinction between the poetry of the subject and the subject of the poem, and \\"The Weeping Burgher\\" for a more subjective perspective on the poet's craft.
