All three victims were Aboriginal, and all three victims disappeared after parties in the Aboriginal community in Bowraville, in an area known as The Mission.Australian Story ‚Äì Truth be Told ‚Äì Transcript , 2006-09-04, abc.net.auLone cop to tell inquest name of killer suspect, By Alex Mitchell, 2004-02-08, The Sun-Herald A local labourer, who was regarded by police as the prime suspect, was charged with two of the murders but was acquitted following trials in 1994 and 2006. On 13 September 2018, the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal decided that the man could not be retried for the murders. On 22 March 2019, the High Court of Australia refused an application by the Attorney General of New South Wales to bring an appeal against that decision. Victims The first victim, 16-year-old Colleen Walker, lived in Sawtell and was in Bowraville in New South Wales' Mid North Coast region visiting relatives. She was last seen alive at a party in the Aboriginal community of The Mission, on 13 September 1990. She was seen walking away from a group of people at the party and the following day her family reported to the police that she was missing. Despite the family believing something terrible had happened, the missing person's report was not taken seriously by police; no search parties were formed and no formal police action was taken. Walker's body has not been found, although articles of her clothing were later found weighed down by rocks in the Nambucca River. On 4 October 1990, Walker's cousin, four-year-old Evelyn Greenup, disappeared after a party at her grandmother's house. She was last seen by her mother as she was put to bed sometime during the night. The next morning she was gone from her bed. Her grandmother later recalled hearing her cry out in the night but did not think much of it at the time. On 27 April 1991, Greenup's skeletal remains were found in bushland near Congarinni Road. An autopsy could not conclusively determine the cause of death, but noted that a skull injury was \\"consistent with a forceful penetration by a sharp instrument\\".Accused spoke of killing girl, court told, By Natasha Wallace, 2006-02-07, The Sydney Morning Herald. On 31 January 1991, 16-year-old Clinton Speedy-Duroux went missing after a party at The Mission. He was last known to have stayed with his girlfriend in a yellow Viscount caravan used by the suspect on the morning of 1 February. On 18 February, his remains were discovered in bushland near Congarinni Road about seven kilometres outside Bowraville. A pillowcase from the caravan was located underneath his clothing. Investigation The killings took place in the rural timber town of Bowraville. Several similarities between the disappearances that led police to believe that they were committed by the same killer: * All took place within the short time frame of five months. * All three victims were Aboriginal. * Autopsies of the two bodies that were found, indicate both suffered trauma to the head.Aborigine murder case is re-opened, By Kathy Marks, 14 May 2005, independent.co.uk * All three victims disappeared after parties in the Aboriginal community in Bowraville, in an area known as The Mission. =Trials= On 8 April 1991, a 25-year-old local Bowraville labourer was arrested for the murder of Speedy-Duroux. He was well known in the Aboriginal community in Bowraville and often attended the parties at The Mission. On 16 October 1991, while out on bail awaiting trial, the man was arrested and charged with the murder of Greenup. Facing a circumstantial case, he was acquitted of Speedy-Duroux's murder by a Supreme Court jury on 18 February 1994, the third anniversary of the discovery of Speedy-Duroux's body. After the acquittal, prosecutors did not proceed with the trial against him for the murder of Greenup. In 1997, the New South Wales Police Commissioner Peter Ryan set up Task Force Ancud to continue the investigation into the unsolved murders. On 9 February 2004, the NSW Coroner John Abernethy reopened the inquests into Greenup's death and the suspected death of Walker. On 10 September 2004, he recommended the man be charged afresh with Greenup's murder. As a result, he was charged again, this time for the murder of Greenup. The trial was conducted in February 2006. The prosecution produced two supposed confessions made by him, but he was acquitted on 3 March 2006. =Aftermath= The murders, and the fact that no one has been convicted of the crimes, is a source of pain and bitterness in the Aboriginal community in Bowraville. After the acquittal in 2006, the NSW Police Minister raised the reward to $250,000 for information leading to the conviction of the persons responsible for the murders.Reward of $250,000 to solve deaths of Evelyn Greenup, Clinton Speedy-Duroux and Colleen Walker , 2007-02-05, NSW Police Force The previous reward was $100,000, and it was only for information related to the disappearance of Walker. In 2006, changes were made to double jeopardy legislation in NSW opening the way for retrial of any person acquitted of a life-sentence offence if \\"fresh and compelling evidence\\" was uncovered.Crimes (Appeal and Review) Amendment (Double Jeopardy) Bill Crimes (Appeal and Review) Amendment (DNA Review Panel) Bill , 2006-09-27, PARLIAMENT OF NEW SOUTH WALES In October 2011, Walker's family found bones in bushland near Macksville, New South Wales, but forensic testing indicated that they were animal remains. =Application for a retrial= In 2016, the detective inspector leading the investigation made a submission to the NSW Attorney General calling for a retrial based on new evidence. In the same month, the suspect said that he was not necessarily opposed to a retrial. In May there was a protest march by the families of the victims and their supporters calling for legislative change to the NSW Parliament building. On 9 February 2017, police laid a murder charge against the suspect, and the NSW Attorney General applied to the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal for a retrial. The Attorney General's application was heard by the Court of Criminal Appeal beginning on 29 November 2017. The Attorney General needed to identify \\"fresh and compelling\\" evidence in order to have the man's acquittals quashed and to obtain an order for a retrial. On 13 September 2018, the court dismissed the application, concluding that none of the evidence was \\"fresh and compelling\\" and that he therefore could not be retried for the murders. The court concluded that most of the evidence relied upon was not \\"fresh\\", because it was available to be tendered or brought forward prior to the earlier trial of the man for the murder of Greenup. On 22 March 2019, the High Court of Australia refused an application by the Attorney General for special leave to appeal against the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal, concluding that there was no reason to doubt the correctness of that decision. The campaign for a retrial continues. Media Dan Box, a crime reporter with The Australian, hosted a 5-part podcast that detailed the murders, released in May 2016, called Bowraville. Box also released a book of the same name in July 2019.

The factory also utilized an industrial railroad track, running off of the Nordland Line from Ranheim Station. The mill in 2013 In 1891 it was changed from a cellulose factory to a paper factory, and the name changed accordingly. The founder's son Lauritz Jenssen Dorenfeldt, who worked there from 1884 to 1894, was important in this development. In 1894 the Jenssen family did not manage to run the factory any more, and the shares were taken over by Christian Christophersen. The factory survived and was dominating in its field north of Dovrefjell, until the 1960s when it got a sizeable competitor in Nordenfjelske Treforedling. Ranheim Papirfabrikk became a part of Norske Skogindustrier in 1971. In 1983 the company was sold to the conglomerate M. Peterson & S√∏n, founded in 1801 in Moss.

Both countries were part of the Spanish Empire until the early 19th century.  History  Initially, both modern states of Argentina and Uruguay were part of the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata. Buenos Aires was by then the Capital city, and the Banda Oriental a province of it. During this period, both Buenos Aires and Montevideo faced two British invasions of the R√≠o de la Plata. In the first one, the British successfully invaded Buenos Aires, being defeated later by a Montevidean army led by Santiago de Liniers. The British invaded Montevideo the second time, but failed to invade Buenos Aires, and Buenos Aires demanded the liberation of Montevideo in the British capitulation. The Spanish king Ferdinand VII was captured during the Peninsular War, and replaced by the French Joseph Bonaparte. He was not recognized as a legitimate king, which left the Spanish monarchy without a ruler. This generated political reactions all across the Spanish Empire. Despite being of French ancestry, Liniers rejected Joseph's rule and confirmed his allegiance to the captive king, but Javier de El√≠o did not trust him, and created a government Junta in Montevideo. Mart√≠n de √Ålzaga, El√≠o's ally in Buenos Aires, attempted to do the same by organizing a mutiny, but failed. El√≠o gave up his junta when Liniers was replaced by a new viceroy, Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros. However, as the Spanish situation in the Peninsular War worsened, Buenos Aires deposed Cisneros during the May Revolution and create their own junta. This started the Argentine War of Independence. Montevideo was declared then the new capital of the viceroyalty, and became a Royalist stronghold. The other populations of the Banda Oriental, however, did not join Montevideo. Led by Jos√© Gervasio Artigas, they made the cry of Asencio and laid siege to the city until its defeat. Uruguay gained its independence after the Cisplatine War, with the help of Great Britain. During the Uruguayan Civil War, Argentina supported the National Party. Both countries were allied during the War of the Triple Alliance. Since the end of the 19th century, both countries have shared a similar European heritage. They likewise share very close economic, cultural and political ties with each other. Moreover, since around 1960, there has been significant Uruguayan emigration to Argentina, and today, there are around 120,000 people born in Uruguay living in Argentina.INDEC Political ties The two major political parties of Uruguay before 2002 the Colorado Party and the National Party, both called traditional parties have its origins at extinct Argentinian Parties, Unitarians and Federals who in turn were descendants of bands of Jos√© Artigas. During the first century of Uruguayan Independence mayor events on both sides were chained to the international two party alliance/rivalry constituted in separate nationalized structures. Argentinian Civil War started after Uruguayan Civil War in 1838, when Uruguayan ex-president Fructuoso Rivera deposed former Uruguayan president Manuel Oribe who exiled in Buenos Aires. Boundary dispute Limits between Argentina and Uruguay were first established in the 1827 Peace Convention. In the period between the Peace Convention and the 1973 Boundary Treaty between Uruguay and Argentina in which are set most of the contemporary limits between both countries, the Uruguayan- Argentinian boundary was stablished just somewhere in the River Uruguay. According to what was called Zeballos's Doctrine due to Argentinian Chancellor between 1854 and 1923, Estanislao Severo Zeballos, Uruguay should had no jurisdiction at all over the River Plate that should only pertain to Argentina. During Jos√© Figueroa Alcorta's Argentinian presidency three mayor incidents encountered: *Industrial Argentinian fishing on Uruguayan border. *Shipwreck of Argentinian navy Constituci√≥n near Colonia Department *War practices by Argentinian Army near Uruguayan coast. In a treaty of June 18 of 1988, the sole dry limit between Argentina and Uruguay is established at Mart√≠n Garc√≠a Island. Diplomatic scandals During the presidency of Jorge Batlle in Uruguay, an infidelity of a journalist carried a considerable diplomatic incident in 2002 when an off-topic commentary was aired in Uruguayan television describing Batlle saying that 'Argentinians are all thieves'. The incident solved after one week when Batlle publicly apologized on Argentinian television. Another filtered commentary of Uruguayan president Jos√© Mujica was aired during a meeting where he said that 'with the Turk we were better but with this old lady there is no deal' making references to Argentinian rulers N√©stor Kirchner and Cristina Kirchner. During a speech, Cristina Kirchner stated that 'Jos√© Gervasio Artigas wanted to be Argentinian and we did not let him', this statement echoed in Uruguay for a while.  Strained relations during the Kirchner era  Following the announced construction of a pulp mills on the Uruguayan side of the Uruguay River by Spanish manufacturer ENCE in 2003, both countries experienced their first significant diplomatic tensions since President Juan Per√≥n attempted in 1952 to curb Argentine offshore banking in the neighboring nation. Bridges over the River Uruguay were closed for over a year. Though plans for the ENCE mill were canceled in 2005, a second mill was announced by Finland's Botnia in 2005, and the facility was opened in 2007.BBC News: Argentines in pulp mill protest (11 Nov 2007) The Pulp mill dispute between Argentina and Uruguay remains a subject of controversy, particularly after ongoing reports of growing water contamination in the area that were later proved to be sewage discharge from the actual town Gualeguaych√∫ itself.La Fraybentina: Las mentiras tienen patas cortas (1 Mar 2010) Clar√≠n: Hay 115 casos de dermatitis en un balneario ubicado frente a Botnia (22 Feb 2010)  Today  Presidents Mauricio Macri and Tabar√© V√°zquez in 2016.

Controlling a fleet of battleships, players would explore the void of space to gather resources and fight off enemy fleets and destroy entire planets. Players could construct network systems to distribute resources to other players and construct new ship types to deploy into battle. The plot involves an intergalactic organization, the United Galaxy Space Force, discovering an unknown extra-terrestrial species that plans to wipe out all of mankind. It was made for the Namco System N2 arcade board. Development of the game was done by internal development group \\"Project Starline\\", lead by Toru Takahashi. Inspired by the Age of Empires series, the team wanted to create a game that would help set a standard for Japanese online games, which were deemed inferior in quality to those overseas. The game was meant to be part of Namco's fictional \\"United Galaxy Space Force\\" saga and used ships and settings from other Namco video games, including Galaxian, Galaga, Xevious and Starblade. Beta testing for the game was exclusive to Namco-operated cafe chains in Japan. New Space Order was shown off at the 2007 Amusement Operators Union (AOU) tradeshow, which was followed by a tie-in anime series, New Space Order: Link of Life. Updates for the game would continue to decrease in the years following, and development was officially ceased in 2009 with little to no explanation. Gameplay Pre-release screenshot, showing the player attacking a fleet of enemies and their home planet. New Space Order was described as a \\"Namco space opera\\". Up to eight players controlled a fleet of battleships as they must explore the universe in search of the \\"enemy star\\". Ships included large-scale war machines, small drones and turret guns. Similar to the Age of Empires series, the map will begin as entirely black, revealing more of the world as the player explores. Ships can be deployed to fend off enemy formations approaching the player or their base. A \\"planet buster\\" weapon can be deployed against enemy planets to instantly wipe them out, with one taking the form of Zolgear from the arcade game Attack of the Zolgear. Players could gather resources by exploring space, and could also distribute them to other players through tube-based network systems. Resources could be used to construct new ship types and weapons. Several ships are based on those found in other Namco shooting games, such as Galaxian, Galaga, Star Luster and Ace Combat 3: Electrosphere. A short tutorial was present to teach the player how to play the game. Maps were randomly-generated and could take the form of various designs, including a recreation of the maze from Pac-Man. The game was played using a mouse and keyboard. An IRC card was used to save player progress. The arcade cabinets could be linked together to allow for additional players, the maximum being eight. History =Development= New Space Order began development in 2004 by \\"Project Starline\\", an internal development group in Namco headed by director Toru Takahashi. Prior to development, most real-time strategy games in Japan had been placed in a negative light for being inferior in quality to those from North America and Europe. Takahashi, a fan of the Age of Empires series, set out to design a similar game in higher quality to help set a standard for future games of its kind in Japan. It was to be Namco's very first real-time strategy game and one of their first online-focused titles. The game was centered around the United Galaxy Space Force universe that combined characters, ships and settings from other Namco titles, including Galaxian, Galaga, Bosconian, Xevious, NebulasRay, Starblade and Ace Combat. Originally, the game was to instead feature futuristic tank combat instead of large-scale wars in space ‚Äî although a fan of the idea, Takahashi thought that the space theme was more interesting and could help focus more on combat and strategy. The team had difficulty defining the most important aspects for the game, as Namco had previously never made a game similar to theirs. Takahashi wanted the game to appeal to a wider audience so as to help the game get a foothold in the market. The team also wanted players to work together, leading to the addition of resource-sharing link systems. Beta testing began on August 26, 2004, taking place in Namco-operated cafe chains across Japan. =Promotion and cancellation= New Space Order was presented at the Amusement Operators Union (AOU) tradeshow in Japan on February 16, 2007, alongside other Namco Bandai titles such as Tekken 6, Mario Kart Arcade GP 2 and Wangan Midnight: Maximum Tune 3, where it had attracted a sizable amount of attention. The game was housed in arcade cabinets previously used for Counter-Strike Neo, fitted with a mouse and keyboard. Despite its attention, critics felt that the game was better-suited as a PC title and didn't feel the idea of a real-time strategy game would fit for arcades, somewhat criticizing Namco Bandai Games for not announcing a PC port of the game. Shortly after the tradeshow, a tie-in anime series, New Space Order: Link of Life, was released exclusively for the game's official website to help explain the story. After a lack of updates for nearly two years, the official website for the game announced its cancellation on January 27, 2009, citing \\"various circumstances\\" as its reason.

It lies west of the former Arlington station, east of Western Avenue, and north of the Staten Island Expressway in the Port Ivory neighborhood. The yard leads into the Travis Branch of the railway, the Howland Hook Container Terminal, and the Arthur Kill Lift Bridge to Elizabeth, New Jersey and the Chemical Coast and is part of the ExpressRail network. The 2007 opening of the Staten Island Transfer Station and the ExpressRail facility, along with the reopening of the Arthur Kills bridge, has reactivated the yard. The use of the Howland Hook Container Terminal to transfer containerized municipal waste from barges to trains, servicing roughly half of New York City's barged trash volume, has added to the rail traffic handled by the yard. (The facility that handles the other half is located directly across Arthur Kill.) History The yard opened in 1886. The name of the neighborhood Arlington was coined after the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) purchased a farm at Old Place, on Staten Island's northwestern corner, which would become the Arlington freight yard. The B&O; renamed the area Arlington. Following the completion of the Arthur Kill Bridge in 1889, the yard was the first stop for freight trains coming from New Jersey. Arlington Yards was the hub of Staten Island's freight industry for most of the 20th century. The engine house at Arlington was a small, two stall, cinder-block building. There was a tank car to fuel locomotives in the yard. Materials used to perform minor repairs to freight cars could be found inside the building. At one point the yard had a capacity for 3,000 train cars.

The house at Elk Landing was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. It is a two-story, fieldstone dwelling, three bays wide by two bays deep, with a gable roof dating to about 1780. Its interior features a corner fireplace in its northeast corner as well as a full basement. Interior doors and chair rail moldings in most of the rooms may also be original to the house. The property on which the house is located was part of an early settlement of Swedish and Finnish immigrants. Elk Landing was the home, trading post and base of operations of the Swedish-American trader, John Hansson Steelman (1655‚Äì1749) who occupied the site from 1693. Steelman traded with the Indians of South Central Pennsylvania and Northern Maryland exchanging small items of housewares for animal pelts. Steelman's establishment was a trading post until about 1739 when the Shawnee moved westward into the Ohio and Allegheny River Valleys. It also included a dwelling and a tavern. Archeological excavations have discovered the remains of the original long house of John Hanson Steelman. The site is north of and adjacent to the stone house.M√•nsson and his Steelman Family (Dr. Peter Stebbins Craig. \\"Swedish Colonial News\\", Volume 1, Number 10.

It is managed by the Centre INRA de Nancy, a branch of the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA), and open on the third Saturday of the warmer months; an admission fee is charged. The arboretum was created in 1900 with two objectives: as a research facility for students at the forestry school, and to study acclimatization of exotic species in the Lorraine. It was known by a series of names - Arboretum de la Voivre, Arboretum du Fays, and Arboretum de L'√âcole Nationale des Eaux et des For√™ts - before receiving its current name in 1964 when it became attached to the INRA forestry school. From 1900 to 1901 about 1200 plants were installed in 74 plots, organized geographically, which represented 230 species (98 conifers, 132 deciduous). The arboretum received substantial damage during World War I but was restored 1923‚Äì1925, only to receive further damage during World War II as the Germans camped on its boundary and stored ammunition within the arboretum itself, which was in consequence shelled by American forces. The arboretum was again restored from 1960 to 1967, and enlarged by a further 3 hectares. It received moderate damage in a heavy storm of December 1999 but has subsequently been restored. Today the arboretum contains more than 405 varieties of trees representing 88 species; despite the arboretum's difficult history, many mature specimens remain from the arboretum's earliest planting. It is organized into four major sections: * Occidental Eurasia and North Africa - Abies alba, Abies bornmuelleriana, Abies nordmanniana, Alnus cordata, Alnus subcordata, Betula pendula, Cedrus atlantica, Larix decidua, Parrotia persica, Picea orientalis, Picea omorica, Pinus nigra, Prunus avium, Pterocarya fraxinifolia, Quercus frainetto, Sorbus domestica, etc. * Oriental Eurasia (Siberia, Korea, China, Japan) - Abies koreana, Acer japonicum, Betula maximowicziana, Chamaecyparis pisifera, Cryptomeria japonica, Ginkgo biloba, Larix kaempferi, Metasequoia glyptostroboides, Pinus griffithii, Sciadopitys verticillata, Thujopsis dolobrata, etc. * North America, Atlantic region - Acer saccharum, Betula lenta, Carya ovata, Cornus, Hamamelis, Juglans cinerea, Liquidambar styraciflua, Liriodendron tulipifera, Nyssa sylvatica, Pinus strobus, Quercus palustris, Quercus phellos, Quercus rubra, Quercus velutina, Taxodium distichum, etc. * North America, Pacific region - Abies grandis, Abies procera, Acer macrophyllum, Alnus rubra, Chamaecyparis lawsoniana, Chamaecyparis nootkatensis, Libocedrus decurrens, Pinus ponderosa, Populus trichocarpa, Pseudotsuga menziesii, Sequoiadendron giganteum, Thuja plicata, etc.  See also  * List of botanical gardens in France  References  * Arboretum d'Amance * Conservatoire des Jardins et Paysages entry (French) * Je Decouvre la France entry (French) * Cyril Galley, Collectif, Michel Vernier, Jean-Fran√ßois Picard, Marc Bakker, Patrick Behr, Fran√ßois Le Tacon, D'arbre en art: L'Arboretum d'Amance, Editions Quae, 2000. . * J.-F.

It is found in south eastern regions of Australia, in the states of South Australia and Victoria, and is the most widespread of the two Adenanthos species occurring outside of Western Australia. Description Adenanthos terminalis grows as an upright shrub, usually no more than high, but occasionally up to . It lacks a lignotuber. Branches are held erect, and are covered in hairs that lie close along the stem. The leaves are laciniate, being segmented by threes into between three and seven, but most often five, long thin laciniae, each between long, and around in diameter. They most occur clustered at the ends of the branches, but some persist on the stem. Stem leaves are most hairless, and smaller than the leaves that surround the flower, which often have long hairs near their bases. Unlike most other Adenanthos species, the inflorescence of A. terminalis is not always reduced to a single flower: flowers may occur in groups of up to three. They are usually hidden by the surrounding floral leaves, and consist of a perianth up to long, and a style up to 30 mm ( in) long. The perianth is white to cream in colour, sometimes with some green, and covered in short hairs on the outside. The style is also nearly always hairs, and the ovary is densely haired. Taxonomy The earliest known botanical specimens of A. terminalis were collected by Scottish botanist Robert Brown at Port Lincoln, South Australia in the first few days of March 1802. He described and named the species in his 1810 \\"On the Proteaceae of Jussieu\\". An explicit etymology for the specific name terminalis was not given, but it is accepted that it is from the Latin terminus (\\"end\\"), and refers to the fact that flowers occur at the ends of branches. In 1856, Carl Meissner published a putative variety, A. terminalis var. plumosa, and also assigned some Western Australia specimens collected by Ludwig Preiss to A. terminalis. Fourteen years later, George Bentham published a revision of the genus in Volume 5 of his landmark Flora Australiensis. He overlooked Meissner's var. plumosa, and suggested, correctly, that Meissner had erred in assigning Preiss's Western Australian specimens to A. terminalis. He also published the first infrageneric arrangement of the genus, dividing it into two sections, with A. terminalis placed in A. sect. Stenolaema because its perianth tube is straight and not swollen above the middle. This arrangement still stands today, though A. sect. Stenolaema is now renamed to the autonym A. sect. Adenanthos. In 1978 Ernest Charles Nelson refined Bentham's arrangement by dividing A. sect. Adenanthos into two subsections, with A. terminalis placed into A. subsect. Adenanthos for reasons including the length of its perianth. At the same time he discarded A. terminalis var. plumosa on the grounds that the species is quite variable, particularly when it comes to the hairy covering of the leaves, this being the main characteristic on which Meissner had distinguished the variety. A. sect. Adenanthos was not to last long: Nelson discarded his own subsections in his 1995 treatment of Adenanthos for the Flora of Australia series of monographs. The placement of A. cuneatus in Nelson's arrangement of Adenanthos may be summarised as follows: :Adenanthos ::A. sect. Eurylaema (4 species) ::A. sect. Adenanthos :::A. drummondii :::A. dobagii :::A. apiculatus :::A. linearis :::A. pungens (2 subspecies) :::A. gracilipes :::A. venosus :::A. dobsonii :::A. glabrescens (2 subspecies) :::A. ellipticus :::A. cuneatus :::A. stictus :::A. ileticos :::A. forrestii :::A. eyrei :::A. cacomorphus :::A. flavidiflorus :::A. argyreus :::A. macropodianus :::A. terminalis :::A. sericeus (2 subspecies) :::A. √ó cunninghamii :::A. oreophilus :::A. cygnorum (2 subspecies) :::A. meisneri :::A. velutinus :::A. filifolius :::A. labillardierei :::A. acanthophyllus Despite the phyletic order of the above, Nelson thought the closest relatives of A. terminalis were probably A. apiculatus and A. dobagii. Suspected hybrids of A. terminalis with A. macropodianus have been found. Ecology In a 1977 study conducted in South Australia, designed to gather evidence for the premise that honeyeaters pollinate the flowers they visit, A. terminalis flowers were regularly visited by Acanthorhynchus tenuirostris (eastern spinebill), Anthochaera chrysoptera (little wattlebird), Phylidonyris pyrrhoptera (crescent honeyeater), Phylidonyris novaehollandiae (New Holland honeyeater) and Gliciphila melanops (tawny-crowned honeyeater). Pollen of A. terminalis was recovered from the facial feathers of individuals of all of these species except Anthochaera chrysoptera, and also from Melithreptus brevirostris (brown-headed honeyeater). It is susceptible to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback. Distribution and habitat The species is found in southern regions of Australia, from the Eyre Peninsula and Kangaroo Island in South Australia, to the Big and Little deserts of Victoria. The eastern limit of the species is at Wyperfeld National Park, making this the more easterly species of Adenanthos. It occurs in deep sandy soils, or sometimes in lateritic soils, amongst mallee scrub.

He was a major figure in the field of drug metabolism, the study of how drugs interact in the body and how they are absorbed. A member of the United States National Academy of Sciences, Brodie was a founder and former chief of the Laboratory of Chemical Pharmacology at the National Heart Institute of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland. Early life and education Born in Liverpool in 1907, to a Jewish family Brodie did his undergraduate work at McGill University and received a Ph.D. in chemistry at New York University in 1935. After his graduation from N.Y.U., he was an associate professor there until 1950, when he joined the National Institutes of Health. He headed the pharmacology laboratory there until his retirement in 1970 but remained active as a senior consultant with Hoffmann-LaRoche laboratories in Nutley, New Jersey and as a professor of pharmacology at Pennsylvania State University. Research His most significant discovery was that animal and human responses to drugs do not differ significantly. This pioneered the concept that blood drug levels must guide therapeutic dosages and he established the basis for the chemotherapy of malaria. Together with Julius Axelrod, he discovered that acetanilide and phenacetin both metabolize to paracetamol. Unlike its precursors, paracetamol does not cause methemoglobinemia in humans. Brodie also did research on anesthetic and hypnotic drugs and discovered that procainamide was effective in treating patients with severe irregularities in heart rhythm. He also pioneered a drug therapy for gout. Brodie was the first scientist to determine how the neurohormones, serotonin and norepinephrine, affect the functioning of the brain, thereby leading to an understanding of how anti-psychotic drugs could be used effectively in the treatment of mental and emotional disorders. He also proposed a new line of attack on schizophrenia, leading to studies of how nerve impulses in the brain are transmitted along particular pathways of the nerve cells. His scientific career was the basis of a recent popular biography, Apprentice to Genius by Robert Kanigel, which describes how a group of scientists, headed by Brodie, made prize-winning breakthroughs in biomedical science over a period of 40 years. Awards In 1967, Brodie received the Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research for his more than 30 years of extraordinary contributions to biochemical pharmacology. His work had a profound influence on the use of drugs in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, mental and emotional disorders and cancer. Brodie was elected as a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1966 and held honorary memberships in numerous scientific academies both in the United States and abroad. In addition to the Lasker Award, he was the recipient of the Distinguished Service Award of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare in 1958, the Tollman award in Pharmacology in 1963, the National Medal of Science in 1968, and the Golden Plate Award from the American Academy of Achievement in 1970. He was the author or co-author of more than 350 scientific manuscripts. The neuroscience department of the University of Cagliari was named in his honour by a former student, Gian Luigi Gessa. Brodie died in 1989 in Charlottesville, Virginia at the age of 81. Family Bernard Brodie was a brother of polio researcher Maurice Brodie.Dr. Bernard Brodie honored in US.

Hoyt (October 9, 1893 ‚Äì1978) was an American track athlete and coach. Champion sprinter A native of Greenfield, Iowa, Hoyt won three straight 100 and 220 yard dashes in the Iowa state meet from 1911‚Äì1913 and won seven career gold medals. As a high school student in 1912, Hoyt was offered a place on the U.S. Olympic team but turned down the chance. He ran a nation‚Äôs best of 9.8 in 1913‚Äîthe same year the Amateur Athletic Union called him \\"America‚Äôs best sprinter.\\" His 9.8 time was equaled by Bill Carter of Chicago in 1914 but was not bettered until 1932 when Foy Draper of California ran 9.6. After graduating early from high school, Hoyt enrolled at Grinnell College where he set a world record in the 220-yard dash on a curved track at the 1916 Drake Relays. He won intercollegiate championships in both the 100-yard and 220-yard runs, but lost the opportunity to compete in the Olympics when the 1916 Summer Olympics was cancelled due to World War I. He graduated from Grinnell College in 1917 and served in the United States Navy during World War I.

Its area is about 49.5 km2 and it had a population of 6,242 at the time of the 2010 IBGE census.Censo 2010 In 1993, the region was part of the district of Bar√£o Geraldo in Campinas. That year, a referendum concerning its accession to Paul√≠nia was held, as Betel was economically very attached to the city; the population voted to join the Paul√≠nia municipality, which subsequently expanded in area. View of the entrance of Betel, near the SP-332  History  The region of Betel began to be populated around the year 1889, when the Funilense Railroad was built. The railroad was a milestone for the settlement of Bar√£o Geraldo and Betel. Betel was then a part of Bar√£o Geraldo. In 1950 the Alvorada Parque neighborhood was founded, slowly expanding towards the region of the Constant Pavan Avenue. As Betel grew, it approached the city of Paul√≠nia. In 1993, a plebiscite was held on the accession of Betel to Paul√≠nia; 73.5% of 441 registered voters voted in favor of it, and Betel became a district of Paul√≠nia.  Neighborhoods of Betel  By 1993 Betel included two neighborhoods: Alvorada Parque and Okinawa. After that year, due to the intense urban growth, new neighborhoods appeared in the district. Currently there are 18 neighborhoods in Betel, condominiums and urban centers: * Boa Esperan√ßa * Business Center * Centro Empresarial nossa Senhora de F√°tima * Condom√≠nio Santa Izabel * Fazenda do Deserto * Greenville * Jardim Ivone Alegre * Morro Azul * Moradas de Betel * Okinawa * Parque das Ind√∫strias * Polo de Ensino Profissional * Porto do Sol * Residencial das Paineiras * Residencial Manac√°s * S√≠tio Bonomi * Unicamp (CPQBA) * Vila Alvorada Parque The population is concentrated in the Alvorada Parque and the Parque das Ind√∫strias, which is located in the main shopping district.

Uruguay recognized Lebanon's independence on November 22, 1943. Both countries established diplomatic relations on October 25, 1945. Both countries are members of the Group of 77. Lebanese in Uruguay Memorial to the Uruguayan national hero Jos√© Gervasio Artigas, dedicated by the Lebanese community in Uruguay. The first Lebanese immigrants to Uruguay arrived in the 1860s. In 1954 there were 15,000 people of Lebanese descent living in Uruguay. By 2009 the number had grown to about 55,000. In 1997, Uruguay's house speaker noted that its 99-seat parliament contains two members of Lebanese origin, including himself. Diplomatic relations In 1924 Uruguay established an honorary consulate in Beirut, and on November 16, 1928 made it a consulate general for the State of Greater Lebanon and Syria. On October 25, 1945 the Government of Uruguay was one of the first countries to open diplomatic relations with the newly independent state of Lebanon, upgrading their Beirut mission to an embassy. In 1954 the Lebanese President Camille Chamoun visited Uruguay. On May 31, 1954 he signed the first treaty between the two countries in Montevideo. From 1946 to 1963, Lebanon was represented in Uruguay by an honorary consulate of Lebanon in Montevideo. From 1963, Lebanon was represented through their Embassy of Lebanon Buenos Aires, Argentina. In 1971, Lebanon established a diplomatic mission in Montevideo, with representation at the ambassadorial level. In December 1999, Zafer El-Hasan, secretary general of the Lebanese Foreign Ministry, held bilateral talks with Uruguayan Deputy Foreign Minister Roberto Rodriguez Pioli about enhancing relations between the two countries in the political, economic and cultural fields. Pioli was visiting Lebanon with a delegation of businessmen of Lebanese origin. The two representatives signed an agreement on cultural cooperation. There has been controversy in Uruguay about relations with Lebanon. Julio Mar√≠a Sanguinetti of the Partido Colorado, president from 1995 to 2000, said in an interview after losing power that Uruguay was wrong to support Lebanon in disputes with Israel due to Lebanon's failure to combat terrorism. In May 2007 the Lebanese president Emile Lahoud decorated the outgoing Ambassador of Uruguay, Vos Alberto Rubio, with the National Order of the Cedar, in gratitude for to his diplomatic work. The ambassador later inaugurated a bust of Jos√© Artigas, the liberator of Uruguay, commemorating almost 49 years of uninterrupted diplomatic relations between the two countries. Later in 2007 Jorge Luis Jure Arnoletti became the new Uruguayan Ambassador to Lebanon. Following the surprise election of pro a western government in Lebanon during June 2009, Uruguay congratulated the President Michel Suleiman, the new government, and the people of Lebanon saying they hoped recent developments would unite them with very close ties. In April 2011, Foreign Minister Luis Almagro made an official visit to Lebanon and other countries in the Middle East. Lebanon- Israel conflicts Uruguay has consistently supported Lebanon in disputes with Israel. When the 1978 South Lebanon conflict broke out, the Uruguay parliament was the only one in South America to take a decision demanding implementation of the 1978 United Nations Security Council Resolution 425, calling on Israel to immediately withdraw its forces from Lebanon. During the 2006 Lebanon War, five Uruguayan families of Lebanese origin were caught up in the conflict, but managed to escape from Lebanon to Syria. Uruguay coordinated with Venezuela to evacuate their citizens. Uruguayan Foreign Minister Reinaldo Gargano stated that Israel should cease fire and begin talks with Lebanon under the supervision of the United Nations.

The term phleng phuea chiwit (songs for life) came from \\"art for life\\" or \\"literature for life\\", that is, literature on life and society, while phleng phuea chiwit era flourishing in the 1970s also known as \\"jewel of the literature of life\\".Anniversary 40 years, 1973 Thai popular uprising\\" Thai PBS, 25 October 2013. History Caravan The philosophical roots of phleng pheua chiwit was in the Art for Life movement led by Marxist thinker Chit Phumisak in 1957. Phleng Phuea Chiwit originated from the events of 14 October 1973, when student and popular protests drove off the \\"three tyrants.\\" The earliest phleng phuea chiwit band was called Caravan, which was formed after the 1973 student massacre. In 1976, police and right wing activists attacked students at Thammasat University. Caravan, along with other bands and activists, fled for the hills. There, Caravan continued playing music for local farmers. Caravan released their albums Khon Kap Khwai (Man and Buffalo, 1975) and Amerikan Antarai (Dangerous American, 1976), inspired by American protest songs. In the 1980s, phleng phuea chiwit combined Western folk music with an increasing admixture from rock music, Latin rock, and country. Phleng phuea chiwit bands and artists such as Hammer, Pongsit Kamphee, Pongthep Kradonchamnan gained in popularity. Carabao, achieved success when their fifth album, Made in Thailand, became a hit in 1984 and sold over four million copies. Many artists of the 1990s including Indochine, Kon Darn Kwean, Maleehuana, Hope Family, Noo-Miter, Jaran Manopetch, Katorn, Zu Zu, and Su Boonleang were influenced by other genres such as luk thung and reggae. Rock artists influenced by phleng phuea chiwit include Palaphol Pholkongseng, Thanapol \\"Suea\\" Intharit, and Sib Lor (led by Hugo). Styles Phleng phuea chiwit typically incorporates elements of Western as well as Thai folk ballads, more rhythmic Thai styles such as samcha, mor lam, and luk thung, and occasionally elements of Thai classical music as well. More recently, elements of reggae, ska and Latin music have found their way into the genre as well. As for the instrumentation, early phleng phuea chiwit was generally in a more folk style, with acoustic instruments, while later versions often more rock- style arrangements, with electric guitars, bass, and drums. Many artists also use Thai instruments such as the phin, wut, khluay, and saw. Some phleng phuea chiwit artists were inspired by Western musicians including Bob Dylan, Bob Marley, Simon & Garfunkel, and Neil Young.

Both nations are members of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, Group of 77, Latin American Integration Association, Organization of American States, Organization of Ibero-American States and the United Nations. History Both Chile and Uruguay share a common history in the fact that both nations were once part of the Spanish Empire. During the Spanish colonial period, Chile was then part of the Viceroyalty of Peru and administered from Lima while Uruguay was governed from the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata in Buenos Aires. In 1818, Chile declared its independence. In 1828, Uruguay obtained its independence after the Cisplatine War. In October 1972, Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 crashed in the Andes mountains carrying 45 passengers and crew, most of them Uruguayan Rugby players traveling to Chile for a match. The 40 survivors of the crash spent two months in the mountains and resorted to cannibalism to survive. In December 1972, 16 survivors were left when discovered and carried to safety. The incident became known as The Miracle of the Andes. During the 1970s and 1980s, both nations suffered from dictatorships and cooperated with the United States in Operation Condor. In 1973, nine Uruguayan citizens were detained in Chile and remain missing to this day.Pinochet y Uruguay, un v√≠nculo oscuro (in Spanish) In April 1976, President Augusto Pinochet paid a visit to Uruguay and met with President Juan Mar√≠a Bordaberry.

There have been numerous visits and reunions by leaders of both nations. Both nations encourage the convergence between the Pacific Alliance (for which Chile is a member of) and MERCOSUR (for which Uruguay is a member of), with the aim of promoting Latin American integration.

The first printing quickly sold out following its release, having already been excerpted in various magazines and on the internet. It was followed by a companion piece, Corner Pieces in 2004. The novel has since been translated into French by √âditions Adage, translated by Elizabeth Robert, and published as Walkups: Sc√®nes de la vie Montr√©alaise. A second printing of the novella was released by conundrum press in May 2009. The title evokes the typical street-side apartment living of large eastern North American cities in general, and the winding staircases typical to Montreal in particular. Content The format and structure of the novella is unconventional, written in extremely short chapters with only two recurring characters and interspersed with enigmatic black and white photographs taken by the author, and artist Charles Chalmers. Walkups is a novella that takes urban architecture‚Äîparticularly Montreal row-house architecture‚Äîas its primary subject. All chapters, titled only by an address, take place with the walls of different apartments, while the one recurring address, referred to only as the Apts d'amours returns us to the central narrative of the unnamed narrator and his love interest, Jane, a biology student who lives upstairs from him in the same building. As literary critic Kevin Connolly points out in his article on Walkups in Toronto's eye weekly, Walkups shares some similarities with work of Mark Danielewski and Roman Polanski's film, The Tenant.Kevin Connolly, \\"Living Apartments\\", eye weekly Toronto, 2001 The novel depicts the claustrophobia and cabin fever associated with cold northern climes, as well as the deep psychological weight of personal and public history as represented by our mundane living spaces. On one hand Walkups acts as a kind of tour guide to the various neighbourhoods of Montreal and a documentary of various, while simultaneously telling a story of a love affair within the walls of an apartment building that is seemingly alive.

Natesan worked as a lecturer in Pithapuram Maharaja College and as an interpreter in the Gordon Woodrof Company. He graduated in medicine from Madras Medical College and practised as a doctor.

Contribution in early Dravidian politics  In 1912, the Madras United League was formed. Natesa Mudaliar was one of the founders of the league and served as its Secretary. The league was largely composed of government employees and concentrated on improving the literacy of non-Brahmins by conducting adult education classes. In 1914, the Madras United League was renamed as the Madras Dravidian Association and Panaganti Ramarayaningar, later the Raja of Panagal was elected President. As a part of its programme, the Madras Dravidian Association conducted a hostel called \\"Dravidian Home\\" for the benefit of non-Brahmin students. Natesan was the caretaker of this hostel.  Formation of the South Indian Liberal Federation  Through the mediatory efforts of Mudaliar, political opponents Sir Theagaroya Chetty and Dr. T. M. Nair came together and resolved to put forth their efforts to form an organization representing the non-Brahmins of the Madras Presidency. In November 1916, at a non-Brahmin conference presided over by Panaganti Ramarayaningar, the four important non-Brahmin organizations in the Presidency came together to form the South Indian Liberal Federation, more popularly known as the Justice Party. Theagaroya Chetty became the first President of the federation. Natesa Mudaliar, along with Theagaroya Chetty, was instrumental in negotiating an end to the Buckingham and Carnatic Mills strike of 1921, organized by V. Kalyanasundaram.

In 1929, Natesan presided over the Justice Party conference in which a resolution was passed facilitating the admission of Brahmins in the party. In 1933, Natesan expressed his support to C. P. Ramaswami Iyer when the latter spoke against casteism and proposed a temple entry law in order to remove restrictions on scheduled castes entering Hindu temples.South Indian Celebrities, p. 51  Death  Natesan was expected to contest in the 1937 elections to the legislative assembly of Madras but he died all of a sudden in February 1937 at the age of 62.

In the 1620s, Jesuit and Franciscan missionaries established the first missions in Banda Oriental. By the late 1600s, Spanish settlers came to Banda Oriental for cattle raising. In 1776, Banda Oriental officially became part of the Spanish Empire and was governed from the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata based in Buenos Aires. =Independence= In 1810, a movement for independence broke out in Buenos Aires and it influenced the move for independence in Banda Oriental. In 1811, General Jos√© Gervasio Artigas led the independence movement in Banda Oriental and raised an army and fought against Spanish troops in the territory. In May 1811, General Artigas fought a successful battle against Spanish troops known as the Battle of Las Piedras. General Artigas was later seen as a threat by commanders in Buenos Aires who saw the Banda Oriental as a province of Rio de la Plata and not as a separate territory. In 1820, the commanders of Buenos Aires acquiesced when Portuguese Brazilian forces took over the Banda Oriental and forced Artigas into exile. In 1825, the Thirty-Three Orientals entered into Uruguay and fought against Brazilian troops. In 1828 a treaty was signed between Brazil and Argentina which allowed for the Banda Oriental to become an independent nation. The new country was then to become known as Uruguay. =Post independence= Monument to Spain in Montevideo On 19 July 1870, both Spain and Uruguay established diplomatic relations and signed a Treaty of Peace and Friendship.Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs: Uruguay (in Spanish) After the establishment of diplomatic relations, thousands of Spanish nationals immigrated to Uruguay.

In 1542, Paraguay officially became part of the Spanish Empire and governed by the newly created Viceroyalty of Peru based in Lima. In the early 1600s, Jesuit missionaries began arriving to Paraguay and established missions to convert the local Guaran√≠ people to Catholicism. This period was known as the Jesuit reduction. For the next 150 years, Jesuits developed their own autonomous area of control within Paraguay which led to conflict with the Spanish administration of the colony. From 1721-1735, Spanish landowners waged a struggle to overthrow the Jesuit monopoly of Indian trade and labor. Spanish and Portuguese troops joined together to overthrow the Jesuit dominance in the region which resulted in the Jesuits being expelled from Paraguay and nearby colonies in 1767. =Independence= In 1776, the Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata was created based in Buenos Aires and Paraguay fell under its new administration. By the early 1800s, a sense of independence was spreading throughout Spanish America. In May 1810, the May Revolution occurred in Buenos Aires which began the Argentine War of Independence. Because Paraguay fell under the governance of Buenos Aires, the act of independence in Argentina affected Paraguay although leaders in Paraguay refused to accept the declaration of Argentine Independence. Although initially Paraguay was against independence from Spain, in May 1811 a Junta was created in Asuncion led by Fulgencio Yegros. The Junta declared Paraguayan independence and in July 1811, they sent a letter to Buenos Aires expressing their desire of a confederation with Argentina, however, by October 1812, the confederation was disbanded after Argentina made its intentions to use Paraguayan troops for its own independence and interprovincial quarrels.

Demographics The municipality of Klokot has a Serb majority and Albanian minority. The ECMI calculated, based on 2010 and 2013 estimations, that the Klokot municipality was inhabited by 3,500 Serbs (71.23%). The town of Klokot had 1,500 residents before the Kosovo War (1998‚Äì99), and 1,200 in 2001. According to the 2011 census, which is unreliable due to partial boycott by Serbs and other minorities, the town of Klokot alone had 1,064 residents, 616 Serbs (57.89%), 446 Albanians (41.91%), and 2 others; the municipality had 2,556 residents, 1,362 Albanians (53.29%), 1,177 Serbs (40.05%), 9 Romani (0.35%), 1 Turk (0.04%) and 7 Others and unspecified (0.27%). The number of residents before the Kosovo War was estimated to have been 5,000 in what is today the Klokot municipality.

The national headquarters, and former global headquarters, is Saint Hill Manor at East Grinstead, which for seven years was the home of L. Ron Hubbard, the pulp fiction author who created Scientology. Church-connected groups promoting aspects of L. Ron Hubbard's teaching, including Narconon and CCHR, have also been active in the UK, in some cases with charitable status. There have also been groups practising Scientology independently of the Church. Scientology has received critical judgments from British courts, calling it \\"pernicious nonsense\\", \\"dangerous material\\" and \\"immoral and socially obnoxious\\". It has been described in Parliament as a socially harmful enterprise which indoctrinates children and other vulnerable people by \\"ignorantly practising quasi-psychological techniques\\". The UK Government's 1971 official report into Scientology was highly critical, as was another report prepared secretly several years later. Since then, the Church has been recognised as a religion by some authorities, but is not itself a registered charity. The Church has used covert intelligence gathering, harassment and smear campaigns against its UK opponents, although not on as grand a scale as it has in the United States. Status =Number of adherents= The Church of Scientology branch on London's Tottenham Court Road advertises itself as a \\"Life Improvement Centre\\". The 2011 UK census found that there were 2,361 Scientologists in the UK at the time of the survey. For context, this number is roughly half those claiming Zoroastrianism as their religion, and a small fraction of the number of those claiming to be Jedi Knights. The Church claims a membership of 118,000 members in the United Kingdom, including 15,000 regular participants, and in the past has claimed as many as 200,000 British members. Given the incongruence of these ostensible figures with the census data, it is likely these claims are merely aggrandizing fabrications. =Legal status= The Church's application for charity status in England and Wales was rejected in 1999, on the grounds that there is no \\"public benefit arising out of the practice of Scientology\\", (PDF) and the Church has not exercised its right of appeal.U.S. Department of State ‚Äì 2007 Report on International Religious Freedom: United Kingdom In 2000, however, the Church of Scientology scored an important victory when it was exempted from UK value added tax on the basis that it is a not-for-profit body. As a result of the decision, Revenue and Customs reportedly had to return several million pounds' worth of past VAT payments to the institution. In a December 2013 decision, the UK Supreme Court ruled unanimously that a London Church of Scientology chapel was a \\"place of meeting for religious worship\\" and should be registered as a place for marriage; a government minister expressed concern that the decision might affect the future legal status of Scientology in the UK. While the Church of Scientology itself does not have charitable status, several of its related organisations do, including Greenfields School and Narconon. The governing organisation of Scientology in the UK, Church of Scientology Religious Education College, Inc (COSRECI), is a corporation registered in South Australia. While a court judgement there recognises Scientology as a religion, COSRECI itself is not registered as a charity.Seymour, B (20210): \\"Scientology tax\\", TodayTonight, Channel 7 In 1999 CoS provided documents to the Charity Commission including a letter purported to originate from the Ministry of Defence that confirmed that Scientology is \\"an officially recognised religion in the Royal Navy\\". However, the 2012 Royal Navy Personnel Management Manual (in Chapter 31 - Religion and Faiths) makes no reference to Scientology. The Prison Service in England and Wales does not recognize Scientology as a religion, but prisoners who are registered as Scientologists may practice their religion and are given access to a representative of the Church of Scientology if they wish to receive its ministry. Under Scots law, Scientology ministers had been authorised to perform marriages in Scotland even prior to the December 2013 Supreme Court decision. =Religious recognition in the UK= In 2013, a case was brought against the Registrar General by 2 Scientologists who wished to be married in the chapel at the Church of Scientology in London but had been refused on the basis of a court ruling in the 1970s that Scientologists do not worship a god and therefore Scientology could not be considered a religion. On 11 Dec 2013, the Supreme Court in the UK overruled the previous ruling in R (on the application of Hodkin and another) v Registrar General of Births, Deaths and Marriages. In the Supreme Court's judgement, it established a new legal definition for religion as \\"a spiritual or non-secular belief system, held by a group of adherents, which claims to explain mankind‚Äôs place in the universe and relationship with the infinite, and to teach its adherents how they are to live their lives in conformity with the spiritual understanding associated with the belief system.\\" Lord Toulson concluded that Scientology subsequently does meet that definition of a religion in the UK and ordered the Registrar General to recognize the Chapel at the Church of Scientology in London as a place of worship and as a place for the solemnisation of marriages under section 41(1) of the Marriage Act. Beginnings From 1948 to 1952, a craze for Dianetics, L. Ron Hubbard's theory of the mind, swept through the UK as it did the United States. Amateur dianetic groups set up in locations including Bristol and London. The Dianetic Foundation of Great Britain was established in 1952. In the next few years, the dianetic groups affiliated themselves to the Hubbard Association of Scientology. From 1957 to 1959, Hubbard lived and wrote at Fitzroy House in the West End of London. The house was sold off in 1968 but later bought back by the Church of Scientology and is now a museum in honour of Hubbard. East Grinstead The global headquarters of the Scientology movement from 1959 to 1966 was Saint Hill Manor in East Grinstead, Sussex, a manor house dating from 1733. This is the most famous of the Church's \\"Advanced Organisations\\", delivering Operating Thetan training up to level 5. The estate contains a castle built by Scientologists in a medieval style, which opened in 1989. Hubbard developed security checking during this era and ordered that all check sheets should be forwarded to Saint Hill. In 1968, the Scientologists tried unsuccessfully to have their East Grinstead \\"chapel\\" officially recognised as a place of religious worship. Rejected by the Registrar General, they took the case to the Court of Appeal and lost in the case known as R v Registrar General, ex p Segerdal. The judge commented that Scientology was more of a \\"philosophy of the existence of man or of life, rather than a religion\\". The definition of religion that was functional in the Segerdal case was that religion \\"is concerned with man's relation with God, and ethics are concerned with man's relations with man. The two are not the same, and are not made the same by sincere inquiry into the question: 'what is God? Religion was defined as requiring faith in and worship of a God. Scientologists own several shops in East Grinstead high street and are active in the Chamber of Commerce. They run an annual medieval fayre at the manor. When Religion, Inc., Stewart Lamont's unfavourable book about Scientology, was released in 1986, all the copies available in East Grinstead were bought up by one man. Scientologists own a number of other properties around the town. One of its communal houses burnt down in 1991 and since then the Church has been prosecuted by the local council over fire safety. The Independent newspaper acquired documents in 1993 suggesting that the Scientologists had deceived council inspectors, pretending one dormitory housed 50 people when in fact there were 130 permanent residents. During the 1970s, the Church's intelligence operations were directed from Saint Hill by the \\"Guardian World Wide\\", Jane Kember, and her deputy Mo Budlong. These included Operation Snow White (a campaign of burglary, infiltration and wiretapping of US Government offices and the Internal Revenue Service) and various \\"dirty tricks\\" against opponents. Kember and Budlong were extradited to the United States, where in November 1980 they were sentenced to two to six years in prison. Foreign entry ban and legal challenges In a House of Commons of the United Kingdom speech on 25 July 1968, Minister for Health Kenneth Robinson said Scientology's practices were \\"a potential menace to the personality and well- being of those so deluded as to become its followers\\". He described Scientology as \\"so objectionable that it would be right to take all steps ... to curb its growth\\", and so introduced a ban on the immigration of foreign Scientologists. Until then, the Hubbard College of Scientology had, as a recognised educational institution, been allowed to receive foreign students. Foreign Scientologists already in the country were not allowed to stay. According to an internal document from 1976, some of the Church's intelligence staff got around the ban by giving false information to immigration officials. Hubbard left the UK permanently in 1969, moving Scientology's world headquarters to a fleet of ships. The Home Office told him not to return. Scientologists denounced Kenneth Robinson's remarks as \\"insane\\". In retaliation against him, Scientology publications titled \\"Freedom Scientology\\", \\"Freedom and Scientology\\" and \\"Freedom\\" conducted a libel campaign, beginning in 1968. According to these newsletters, he was responsible for creating \\"death camps\\" to which innocent people were being kidnapped to be killed or maimed at will. Robinson successfully sued for libel, prompting a total retraction and substantial damages. The government inquiry in 1971 recommended lifting the ban, by which time 145 individuals had been refused entry to the country. However, the ban was not immediately lifted. The Church took out multiple writs of libel against the Department of Health and Social Security, who in 1977 prepared a confidential report (released to the public 30 years later) to assess their position. According to this report, young people were being alienated from their families by the Disconnection policy and some Scientologists were being trained to carry out Fair Game actions against Church opponents. It also alleged that the Church was taking on young people with mental illness problems, charging them hundreds of pounds, then putting them out on the street after breakdowns. It warned that if the Government lost the libel cases, it could give \\"some seal of respectability to an organisation which is essentially evil\\". On its release, a Church spokesman attacked the document as \\"based on no evidence\\". It was not until July 1980 that the Home Secretary reversed the ban, saying in Parliament, \\"My Right Hon. Friend the Secretary of State of Social Services is not satisfied that there is clear and sufficient evidence for continuing the existing policy with regard to Scientologists on medical grounds alone.\\" Once the ban was lifted, applications by foreign Scientologists to come to the UK were assessed individually. However, all the applications were refused because of Scientology's non-religious status. This was changed in 1996 when the Home Office labeled Scientology a \\"bona fide religion\\" for immigration purposes. Official inquiry An official inquiry into Scientology in the UK was carried out by Sir John G. Foster and published in 1971. The report made its case with L. Ron Hubbard's own words and reprinted a number of internal Ethics Orders. It concluded that it would be unfair to ban Scientology outright, but asked for legislation to ensure that psychotherapy in the United Kingdom is delivered in an ethical manner. He regarded the Scientology version of \\"ethics\\" as inappropriate. Documents seized by the FBI in raids on the Church's US headquarters in July 1977 revealed that an agent had been sent to investigate Sir John Foster in an attempt to link him to Paulette Cooper, author of The Scandal of Scientology and victim of Operation Freakout. The documents showed that Lord Balniel, who had requested the official inquiry, was also a target. Hubbard had written, \\"get a detective on that lord's past to unearth the tit-bits\\". The Latey judgement In 1984, a custody dispute between a practicing Scientologist father and an ex-Scientologist mother came to the High Court. Although the father had stated that he would not raise the ten-year-old boy and eight-year-old girl as Scientologists, Mr Justice Latey ruled that they should reside with the mother (this would not otherwise have been the case since it meant disrupting the status quo for the children) due to the prospect of Scientology's \\"baleful influence\\" on their upbringing. The case reached conclusions about many aspects of Scientology: * Evidence was given of how the Disconnection policy had broken up families and relationships.Judgement of Mr Justice Latey, Re: B & G (Minors) (Custody) Delivered in the High Court (Family Division), London, 23 July 1984, Family Law reports * Mr Justice Latey read some of Scientology's internal documents into the record. These included Training Routine - Lying (TR-L), a \\"Guardian's Order\\" describing ways to investigate and smear \\"traitors\\", and other documents relating to the Fair Game policy. He concluded that despite the ostensible cancellation of Fair Game, \\"Deprival of property, injury by any means, trickery, suing, lying or destruction have been pursued throughout and to this day with the fullest possible vigour.\\" * Evidence had been given \\"of instances of mental breakdown\\" during auditing courses. * The case produced evidence that a Rehabilitation Project Force (an internal punishment system involving physical labour) was in operation in Saint Hill. * Latey ordered Scientology to stop harassing the mother and her partner. Mr Justice Latey revealed his conclusions in a public hearing because of their significance. > Scientology is both immoral and socially obnoxious. ... In my judgement it > is corrupt, sinister and dangerous. It is corrupt because it is based on > lies and deceit and has as its real objective money and power for Mr Hubbard > his wife and those close to him at the top. It is sinister because it > indulges in infamous practices both to its adherents who do not toe the line > unquestioningly and to those outside who criticise or oppose it. It is > dangerous because it is out to capture people, especially children and > impressionable young people, and indoctrinate and brainwash them so that > they become the unquestioning captives and tools of the cult, withdrawn from > ordinary thought, living and relationships with others. A Church spokesman described the judgement as \\"a travesty of British justice\\", and alleged that there had been no opportunity for Scientology itself to submit evidence. Mr Justice Latey had observed that Scientology's lawyers had been in contact with the father and had had an opportunity to answer the allegations made in the case. The judgement was taken to the Court of Appeal the next year, where it was upheld. Relations with authorities =The Henslow case= In 1966, newspapers highlighted the case of Karen Henslow, a 30-year-old woman who had a history of psychiatric problems but had been recovering, who appeared to suffer ill-effects after going to Saint Hill and taking part in Scientology practices. The case was taken up by the newspapers, which published a Disconnection letter from Karen to her mother, and by local MP Peter Hordern. Hubbard responded to the case the next year by sending out a letter to every Member of Parliament, complaining of libellous attacks from the newspapers and others \\"with a lurid turn of mind\\". =Geoffrey Johnson- Smith MP= In 1970 the Church attempted to sue Geoffrey Johnson-Smith, MP for East Grinstead, over claims he had made on BBC television that families were being alienated by the Disconnection policy. In court, he produced evidence of specific cases which were not disputed by the Scientologists. One of the witnesses against Johnson-Smith was William Hamling MP, who had taken a course at Saint Hill in order to find out more about Scientology, and described the course as \\"First rate\\".; \\"Obituary: MR WILLIAM HAMLING Commons aide to Mr Wilson\\", The Times, 21 March 1975. The jury decided that Johnson-Smith's comments were substantially true and made in good faith. =Mental health professionals= According to a memo of 6 May 1971, Hubbard blamed the National Association for Mental Health (NAMH) and World Federation for Mental Health for attacks on Scientology and named Mary Appleby, Secretary of the NAMH, as the ultimate source. Starting in 1969, the NAMH was the target of a mass infiltration campaign by Scientologists who tried to take over key offices and change the organisation's policy on psychiatry. The large numbers of new membership applications just before a deadline raised the suspicion of the existing members and led to a mass expulsion. The Church of Scientology sued unsuccessfully in an attempt to get their members reinstated. In 1988, Scientology-connected group the Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR) conducted a defamation campaign against Professor Sir Martin Roth, a Cambridge University professor of psychiatry. Material provided by the CCHR falsely alleged that experiments run by Roth had damaged patients' brains with huge doses of LSD, led to more than 20 deaths in an Australian hospital, and maimed human subjects in Canada. The Newcastle Times, which had published an article based on the CCHR material, admitted the falsity of the allegations and paid substantial libel damages in 1990. =Police= The City of London branch opened in October 2006, reportedly costing ¬£24 million. Operation Snow White was an intelligence operation launched by the Church to neutralise unfavourable information in government files internationally. Project Witch, the UK branch of Snow White, was directed at the UK branch of Interpol, the Royal Navy and various government ministries. Among the documents seized in the 1977 FBI raids that exposed Snow White was a memo from Jane Kember, the Church's worldwide head of intelligence. Kember announced that Scientology agents had obtained a Metropolitan Police report on the Church and asked for related documents so that a lawsuit against the police could be \\"mocked up\\". On 22 October 2006, a new Church of Scientology centre opened on Queen Victoria Street in the City of London (next to the Faraday Building). David Miscavige, chairman of Scientology's Religious Technology Centre, came to the UK for the ceremony. Local dignitaries also attended the opening, including Chief Superintendent Keith Hurley, the City of London Police lead officer for faith issues. Hurley's speech thanked the Scientologists for their efforts after the 7 July attacks and described Scientology as \\"a force for good\\". This prompted anti-cult group Family Action Information Resource to openly criticise Hurley. The next month, Freedom of Information requests by The Guardian and the Daily Mail revealed that more than twenty City officers had accepted dinners, free entry to Mission: Impossible III film premieres or other hospitality from the Church, including meetings with Tom Cruise. Nearly two years later, the City of London Police issued a court summons to a teenage protester for refusing to take down a placard calling Scientology a \\"dangerous cult\\". They later dropped the case on the advice of the Crown Prosecution Service. =Political parties= In January 2007, it emerged that the Association for Better Living and Education, a Scientology-connected charity which promotes Narconon and Criminon, had paid for stalls at the Labour and Conservative party conferences. Labour's decision to accept the money was taken by its National Executive Committee, and a spokesman described it as purely a \\"business transaction\\". =Advertising regulators= Television adverts for the Church of Scientology were aired in the early 1990s on Superchannel, but in February 1993 were banned by the Independent Television Commission after complaints. The ban was lifted in April 1996. Later that year, the Church produced an advert in which people of many different nationalities speak the word \\"trust\\". It aired initially on the cable channels UK Gold and UK Living and moved to Sky News and other channels, this being the UK's first ever national advertising campaign for a religion. Heber Jentzsch, president of the Church of Scientology International, came to the UK to launch the campaign. The Advertising Standards Authority censured the Church for a poster campaign stating that they had cured \\"Over 250,000\\" drug addicts. The figure was a count of everyone who had completed the Scientologists' detoxification program, including people whose \\"drug\\" exposure was infrequent use of alcoholic drinks or prescription drugs. In March 2016, the Advertising Standards Authority received a complaint about a Church of Scientology television ad, challenging \\"whether the claim about the number of people it helps was misleading and could be substantiated\\", according to a report from The Guardian. The TV ad mentions that the church works hand in hand with \\"volunteers from many faiths\\", helping 24 million people. The church asserted that this number originates from the total number of people helped by the Scientology volunteer ministers between 1998 and 2014. The UK ad watchdog stated that the evidence provided by the church to support the fact of direct aid provided, in forms of medical assistance, rescue and provision of basic needs, was only \\"anecdotal\\". The ad was banned by the ASA for lack of substantial evidence for the claim of helping 24 million people.https://www.rawstory.com/2016/03/uk-watchdog-agency-bans-church-of- scientology-tv-ad-for-misleading-viewers/ Two other grounds claiming misleading facts in the ad were not upheld, including that the church had \\"educated 19 million people on 'the facts about illicit drugs and made \\"tens of millions aware of their human rights\\". They were found to not be in breach of the standards of the ASA.https://www.rt.com/uk/334320-scientology-advert- banned-misleading/ A Church of Scientology statement said: \\"The Advertising Standards Authority found that the Church's 2015 ad accurately reported that its campaign to educate people away from illicit drugs has reached more than 19 million people, and that the Church's human rights awareness program has reached tens of millions. The ASA rejected as unfounded two claims pertaining to these statements. As to the third element of the claim, while the Church stands by the figures it supplied to the ASA, the Church will honor the ASA's requirements in future ads.\\" Relations with academics, authors and the media As Mr Justice Latey observed, L. Ron Hubbard created written policies that enemies are to be harassed using legal and extra-legal means, including frivolous lawsuits. At one point, the Church had 36 libel writs against British newspapers. An internal document from 1971 said that the Church's UK legal department \\"seldom, if ever, assesses its chances of winning before commencing action. ... Legal UK has been in courts more often in the past three years than the rest of the Scientology world combined. ... Do not worry about whether you will win or lose, but direct all effort and concentration on the legal technicalities required to achieve legal confrontation.\\" =Critical authors= *Cyril Vosper, a Scientologist for fourteen years, became disillusioned and wrote a critical book called The Mind Benders. In 1972, the Church sued to prevent publication, claiming that as a condition of taking the Special Briefing Course at Saint Hill he had agreed not to divulge its content to anyone who wasn't \\"clear\\". Lord Denning dismissed the case, arguing that the material was sufficiently dangerous for the public interest to override the confidentiality agreement. *Roy Wallis, a sociologist of religion, investigated Scientology in the 1970s and wrote The Road to Total Freedom: A Sociological Analysis of Scientology, tracing its evolution from a cult to an authoritarian religious sect. Before publication, he made 100 edits in negotiation with the Church, although this was not made clear in the book itself. On its publication, the Church denounced the book as biased and selective, but would later describe it as fair and reasonable. After the book's publication, a Scientology agent visited Stirling University where Wallis was teaching and tried to get him to implicate himself in the drug scene. Subsequently, forged letters apparently from Wallis were sent to his colleagues implicating him in scandalous activities including a homosexual love affair. *Journalist Russell Miller wrote a biography of L. Ron Hubbard entitled Bare-faced Messiah, which was published in 1987. He was spied on while researching the book in the US, and his friends and business associates received visits from Scientologists and private detectives. Attempts were made to frame him for the murder of a London private detective, the murder of singer Dean Reed in East Berlin and a fire in an aircraft factory. Senior executives at publishers Michael Joseph, and at The Sunday Times, which serialised the book, received threatening phone calls and also a visit from private investigator Eugene Ingram, who worked for the Church. Another private investigator, Jarl Grieve Einar Cynewulf, told Sunday Times journalists that he had been offered \\"large sums of money\\" to find a link between Miller and the CIA. The Church unsuccessfully tried for an injunction against Miller and Penguin Books to stop the book being published, a move that the judge described as \\"both mischievous and misconceived\\". *Another British journalist, Stewart Lamont, wrote Religion Inc. which was published in 1986. Its preparation was begun with the Church's co-operation, but Lamont refused to let their representatives review it before publication. Lamont and his publisher then reported a campaign of phone calls and letters from Scientologists, including legal threats. A private detective attempted to get damaging information about Lamont from his ex-wife, and other people posing as bank representatives contacted his neighbours. A Scientology spokesman accused Lamont and his publishers of exaggerating the response to generate publicity. *Paul Bracchi was a journalist at the Evening Argus in East Grinstead, and later at the national Daily Mail. He said in 2007 that after his series of investigative articles on Scientology for the Evening Argus in the 1990s, he was subjected to what he calls a \\"vicious smear campaign\\" including defamatory leaflets, threatening letters and faxes and an attempt to find his ex- directory telephone number. *Jon Atack, an ex-Scientologist who left in 1983, wrote the book A Piece of Blue Sky: Scientology, Dianetics and L. Ron Hubbard Exposed. He provided help to other members in leaving the organisation, as well as acting as an expert witness in various cases concerning Scientology. In response, Atack's home was repeatedly picketed by placard-carrying Scientologists over the course of six days. Eugene Ingram, a private investigator employed by the Church, made visits to Atack, his elderly mother and other family and friends, spreading rumours that Atack would be going to prison. Scientologists also distributed leaflets entitled \\"The Truth about Jon Atack\\", implying that he was a drug dealer who only criticised Scientology for money. Atack eventually went bankrupt due to the cost of defending himself against legal action from the Church. *In January 1997, Richard Ingrams, co- founder of Private Eye, made negative comments about L. Ron Hubbard in a column for The Observer. A Scientology internal fax from the United States, leaked to Observer journalist William Shaw, called for an operation to discredit Ingrams and to write a response. It listed details of his personal life and told the recipient to, \\"Find, investigate and document scandals Ingrams is for sure part of.\\" *British journalist Andrew Morton wrote Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography, published in early 2008. It alleged that Scientology had almost taken over the actor's life and that he was in effect the number two person in the Church. The Church denied this, and the book was not published in the UK for legal reasons. Cruise's lawyer, Bert Fields, gave interviews in which he denounced the book as \\"poorly researched\\" and a \\"rehash of tired old lies\\". *The Complex: An Insider Exposes the Covert World of the Church of Scientology, an Irish book by ex-Scientologist John Duignan, was removed from Amazon.co.uk and other UK bookstores in late 2008, after complaints that it is defamatory, which the publisher denied. UK readers could still order the book through Amazon US. =Twenty Twenty Television= Twenty Twenty Television made two documentaries which were shown in the Big Story series on ITV. For \\"Inside the Cult\\", which was broadcast on 13 July 1995, an undercover reporter joined staff in Poole and East Grinstead and was invited to join the Sea Organization. The Church said the programme \\"took everything out of context\\". In \\"The S Files\\", broadcast on 28 November 1996, former staff at Poole confessed to financial malpractice. The family of a young ex- Scientologist blamed Church harassment for contributing to his suicide, a charge countered by spokesman Mike Rinder. In advance of the first broadcast, the Church of Scientology took out a private prosecution against the reporter, producer and production company, which was eventually thrown out as abusive. They also applied for a ban on the programme, but were refused by the Attorney General. At around the same time, cars belonging to the team had their windows smashed in, and the reporter's mobile phone was cloned and used to run up huge bills. The staff said these events were part of a harassment campaign in response to their documentary, although no connection with Scientology was ever proven and the allegations were denied by the Church. =Channel 4= Secret Lives: L. Ron Hubbard was a biographical television documentary shown on 19 November 1997 on Channel 4, interviewing several members of Hubbard's inner circle. Scientologist John Travolta appealed directly to the channel's controller Mike Jackson in a failed attempt to prevent its broadcast. The programme makers reported various forms of harassment. Private detective Eugene Ingram visited friends and associates of members of the team, spreading rumours that they were involved in crimes including money-laundering. A Scientologist agent phoned friends of the director and producer, posing as a member of a survey organisation and thereby tricking the phone contacts into revealing their addresses. Those who did were visited by private detectives. It is not known how the agent obtained the numbers that the programme makers had dialled from their private phones. During the making of the programme, the crew said that they were trailed by private detectives in the United States and Canada as well as in England. A film crew calling itself \\"Freedom TV\\" made unannounced visits to the homes of the programme makers to film them. The Church said it was investigating whether the programme was part of a campaign to extort money from them. =John Sweeney and BBC Panorama= Journalist John Sweeney filmed a documentary, \\"Scientology and Me\\", which was shown on 14 May 2007 as part of the BBC's Panorama series. In advance of the broadcast, the Church of Scientology released a 40-second video clip of Sweeney losing his temper and screaming in the face of their spokesman Tommy Davis at a Psychiatry: An Industry of Death exhibition. Sweeney was reprimanded by the BBC for his outburst. As he had with Secret Lives, John Travolta personally appealed to the channel's executives to cancel the broadcast. The Church of Scientology also responded by distributing its own documentary on DVD. When the Panorama team were filming in the US, Scientology representatives followed them and repeatedly harangued them. Unknown men also trailed the team, one even appearing at John Sweeney's wedding.BBC One (TV). The Heaven and Earth Show with Gloria Hunniford. 13 May 2007. Sweeney later complained of being \\"chased round the streets of Los Angeles by sinister strangers ... In LA, the moment our hire car left the airport we realised we were being followed by two cars. In our hotel a weird stranger spent every breakfast listening to us.\\" When the crew returned to London, Church executive Mike Rinder was sent from the United States to lobby the BBC, even camping out at their offices. =Private Eye= Private Eye magazine has on a number of occasions criticized Scientology's successful attempts at gaining the cooperation of official organisations with anti-drug campaigns run by its Narconon unit. These have included the City of London police, and schools in London and Cornwall. In 2008, Private Eye also criticized the City of London police for arresting a teenager who was holding a placard protesting against Scientology. Related groups =Greenfields School= A private school near East Grinstead uses the Study Technology devised by L. Ron Hubbard, which it licenses from Church- related group Applied Scholastics. Its connection to the Church was examined in 1984 by Mr. Justice Latey, who commented: It emerged that most of the staff and governors were Scientologists, and that its Chairman of Trustees had been forced both to step down and remove his son from the school as punishment for speaking to Suppressive Persons. At the time, staff were working at charitable rates: an average of ¬£40 per week. In 1994, local paper the Evening Argus reported that the school was hiding all mention of Scientology from its publicity materials. Greenfields is recognised as a charity by the Charity Commission. =Narconon= An \\"anti-drug\\" body, Narconon administers a \\"detoxification\\" procedure called the Purification Rundown, which they advertise as a cure for drug addiction. Narconon has been denied approval by the Home Office and has been refused funding by the Prison service. However, it is a recognised charity with a centre in Tunbridge Wells. Narconon officially denies a connection to the Church of Scientology, though the Church describes it as \\"a Scientology organisation\\" and the UK address of its parent body, the Association for Better Living and Education, is in Saint Hill Manor. In 1994, the London Borough of Tower Hamlets funded an alcoholic to go to Narconon for detoxification, but the council withdrew funding when the Church of Scientology connection was revealed. The woman stayed on, funded by Narconon's trustees. In 2001 an application for a Narconon promotional event in London's Trafalgar Square was barred by the mayor, Ken Livingstone. It emerged in early 2008 that police around the country had attended briefings on the Church's \\"Say No to Drugs\\" campaign as part of a programme of meetings with \\"community leaders\\". Some police forces have distributed Narconon leaflets to schools. The leaflets described illegal drugs, prescription drugs and alcohol as \\"poison\\" and praised the Purification Rundown and Narconon as the best way to deal with drug abuse. Scotland Yard said working with the church should not be seen as an endorsement. =Citizen's Commission on Human Rights= The Citizens Commission on Human Rights, a Scientologist anti- psychiatry group, has campaigned in Scotland to prevent the compulsory treatment of patients in ordinary psychiatric facilities and the high-security State Hospital. =Criminon= The Church of Scientology also runs a criminal rehabilitation organisation named Criminon. Her Majesty's Prison Service HMPS have used Criminon as an option for prisoners' parole programmes to aid rehabiltation. =Volunteer Ministers= A group of 100 Volunteer Ministers joined the relief operation in the aftermath of the 7 July attacks in London. They distributed How To Improve Conditions In Life booklets, asking for a suggested donation of ¬£3. They also provided cups of tea to the emergency services. Some of them later told a BBC reporter that they had kept psychiatric counsellors away from the bombing victims, because of the Scientology belief that psychiatry is evil. Independent Scientologists Hubbard's beliefs and practices, drawn from a diverse set of sources, influenced numerous offshoots, splinter-groups, and new movements. A schism in the early 1980s led to 3,500 Scientologists leaving the Church while some remained holding to the beliefs of Scientology. These Independent scientologists are called \\"squirrels\\" by the Church. =Advanced Ability Centre= In 1984, one group of former staff members set up a centre at Candacraig House in Strathdon, Scotland to deliver the upper level materials of Scientology more cheaply than they were being delivered in the Church. It was founded by Robin Scott, who had been declared a \\"Suppressive Person\\" by the church after making complaints within the organisation. They lacked some of the Operating Thetan documents, but came up with a way to obtain them by theft. Two of Scott's colleagues, Ron Lawley and Morag Bellmaine, dressed in Sea Organization uniforms and went into the Advanced Organisation in Copenhagen, presenting themselves as officers of the Religious Technology Center. They were allowed into a private room to inspect the base's New Era Dianetics for OTs, which they put copies into Bellmaine's handbag and left. A Church agent tricked Scott into visiting Denmark the next year, where he was apprehended by Danish police and served a one-month jail sentence, with three further months suspended. The Church offered a reward of ¬£120,000 for the return of the documents. That particular group eventually became disillusioned with Scientology entirely and decided to publicly \\"expose\\" the Church as \\"an evil organisation\\". They showed a journalist the secret document, which tells of the galactic dictator Xenu, and fought a decade-long court battle to keep hold of the Denmark documents. =AFINITIES= One independent group, based in East Grinstead, called itself the \\"Association for Freely Incorporated Non Intimidatable, Trained and Independent Scientologists\\" (AFINITIES). It formed in the mid-1980s in response to the re-introduction of the Disconnection policy and other complaints against Church management. Their interpretation was that the teachings of L. Ron Hubbard, \\"encourage the unity of the family\\" and therefore that the Disconnection policy was \\"a misrepresentation or misapplication\\". Their goal was to buy out Saint Hill Manor and create a \\"university\\" where members could study Scientology without the objectionable policies. Opposition =FUSS= In 1995, a campaigning group was formed, calling itself Families Under Scientology Stress (FUSS), to bring together ex- members and concerned families. Two members of FUSS, Richard and Judy Price of Tonbridge in Kent, were amongst those who received threats of legal action from the Church's solicitor, accusing them of planning, \\"unlawful and tortuous acts\\" against the Church. The Prices told a local newspaper that they were suffering, \\"harassment and intimidation\\" including unsolicited visitors to their house late at night. The Church of Scientology spread a rumour to the press that Richard Price was an alcoholic, which he denied. =Bonnie Woods= Bonnie Woods was declared Suppressive and subjected to a smear campaign. An American who moved to Britain, Bonnie Woods had been a member of the Sea Organization but left Scientology in 1982. Since 1992, she and her husband Richard have run a telephone helpline for families affected by Scientology. Scientologists declared her a \\"Suppressive Person\\", picketing her house and putting her family under surveillance. Woods told a local paper, \\"The biggest concern I have is for my children. Obviously I worry about their safety. I can never let them answer the phone or the door.\\" Private investigator Eugene Ingram persuaded a creditor of Richard Woods' failed building firm to accept free help from Scientologists to pursue her money. As a result, the family were bankrupted. The Church spread leaflets calling her a \\"hate campaigner\\" around her East Grinstead neighbourhood and on the High Street. Woods sued for libel, and in response the Church took out three libel suits against her. After six years of litigation, eventually reaching the High Court, the Church of Scientology admitted that the claims were lies and paid ¬£155,000 in damages and costs. She told journalists that during the case she had been subjected to a \\"level of harassment that most people would find intolerable\\". =Cult- monitoring groups= INFORM, a Government-sponsored service which answers queries on new religious movements, has said that it receives more calls about Scientology than about any other sect. A spokesman said, \\"We're aware of several cases in which people have spent a lot more than they intended to on Scientology courses.\\" Ian Howarth, General Secretary of the Cult Information Centre described Scientology in a 1996 interview as \\"a group about which we are deeply concerned, and always have been\\". The Church of Scientology retaliated with a dossier about the CIC in 1997. This exposed Howarth's personal financial details and attempted to link him to a convicted criminal. Another dossier about FAIR (Family Action Information Resource) held lurid allegations about the sex life of an ex-official. In 1994, Lord McNair, a Scientologist and at that time a member of the House of Lords, called on the University of Hull to cancel an academic conference on religious cults. =Anonymous= The Internet group Anonymous has arranged demonstrations around the UK from February 2008 onwards as part of Project Chanology, its worldwide campaign to expose the Church of Scientology's \\"illegal and immoral behaviour\\". They wear Guy Fawkes masks inspired by the film V for Vendetta. The protests have involved live \\"Rick Rolling\\" and the distribution of cake and biscuits to passers-by. Scientology spokespeople have denounced the group as \\"terrorists\\".

At Gorakhpur it becomes a left bank tributary of West Rapti River, which in turn joins the GhƒÅghara above Gaura Barhaj, then Ghaghara in turn joins the Ganges.Google maps view of River rohni According to an account in several Buddhist texts, Kapilavatthu (the town of the Sakyans) and Koli (the town of the Koliyans) were situated on either side of the Rohini river. The cultivators of both towns worked the fields watered by the Rohini river. One year, they did not have enough rain and finding that the paddy and other crops were beginning to shrivel up, cultivators on both sides wanted to divert the water from the Rohini river to their own fields. Those living in Koli said that there was not enough water in the river for both sides, and that if only they could channel the water just once more to their fields that would be enough for the paddy to mature and ripen. On the other hand, people from Kapilavatthu argued that, in that case, they would be denied the use of the water and their crops would surely fail, and they would be compelled to buy from other people. They said that they were not prepared to go carrying their money and valuables to the opposite bank of the river in exchange for food. Both sides wanted the water for their own use only and there was much ill will between them due to abusive language and accusations on both sides. The quarrel that started between the cultivators came to the ears of the ministers concerned, and they reported the matter to their respective rulers, and both sides prepared to go to war CONFLICT WITH SAKYA SANGH Buddhist tradition holds that SiddhƒÅrtha Gautama crossed this river in his return to Kapilavastu.

The line ran through the northern part of the Upper Franconian rural county (Landkreis) of Wunsiedel from Kirchenlamitz Ost station, on the main line from Hof to Marktredwitz, in a westerly direction steadily climbing uphill into the Lamitz valley to the town of Kirchenlamitz. Around 1910 the town had about 2,200 inhabitants who worked mainly in the granite quarries and the porcelain industry. Continuing uphill the route reached the watershed between the Saale and the Eger rivers at Buchhaus, 660 m above sea level and the highest point on any railway in Upper Franconia. Its lower-lying terminal station was at Weissenstadt which had 2,870 townsfolk at that time and was situated by the upper reaches of the Eger south of the Waldsteingebirge mountain chain, a part of the Fichtelgebirge mountains.

These awards recognize excellence in developing useful and attractive publications and provide SIGUCCS conference participants with an opportunity to review model publications that may help them develop or enhance their own work. History Founded in 1963, SIGUCCS began as SIGUCC (Special Interest Group for University Computing Centers) but changed its name in 1981 to reflect the growing use of computing among large and small institutions of higher education. Originally meeting at ACM events, it began hosting its own conferences in 1973 (fall user services) and 1974 (spring management symposium). In 2011, the two conferences began to be held back-to-back and in 2016 the content from each was combined into a single conference that supports the needs of all information technology professionals in higher education, from help desk to leadership.

The park can trace its history back to 1388, when it lay southeast of Chetwynd Park estate. The country house is now lost, but the medieval deer park survives as an agricultural showground, used for Newport Show and other events. The deer park was probably established early in the 18th century, and elements of the pleasure grounds in the 1860s. The country house was built on the banks of Chetwynd pool, which is a small lake considered to have formed in the same way as nearby Aqualate Mere. In the 19th century, the park was filled with deciduous trees, including oak, beech, wych elm, horse chestnuts and Spanish chestnuts, and some crab apples. It was stocked with 115 P√®re David's deer. Before 1891, there was a great arboretum at Chetwynd, which provided cuttings to plant the new church's drive (Leach 1891, 367). J.C.B. Borough also added a strip of land east of the park and north of the Longford, and created a drive to run around the outer edge of that extension, leading from Chetwynd Park to a new lodge on the Longford. This lay opposite the north end of Park Pool. There were other lodges at the south end of the pool, and at the bottom of the drive to the park. The northern part of the park featured a stone icehouse, probably dating from the mid- to late 18th century. Animals that live around the pool are shoveler, wigeon and occasionally goosander. As well as the wildfowl on the pool other birds of interest include all three species of woodpecker, nuthatch, treecreeper, raven, and buzzard. The deer park is owned by the Newport and District Agricultural Society. As well as being the home of Newport Show, which is held on the second Saturday in July each year, there are a number of other events held there each year. In addition, the society has developed the educational potential of the deer park by building a classroom facility known as The Lodge in 2013 and as a result, many local schools and community groups as well as Harper Adams University visit the deer park for educational purposes.

This defect causes inadequate blood flow to the lungs and thus, a blue or cyanotic infant. Symptoms Common symptoms include a grayish-blue (cyanosis) coloration to the skin, lips, fingernails and other parts of the body. Other pronounced symptoms can be rapid/difficulty breathing, poor feeding, cold hands or feet, or being inactive and drowsy. \\"In a baby with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, if the natural connections between the heart's left and right sides (foramen oval and ductus arteriosus) are allowed to close, he or she may go into shock.\\" Signs of shock can include cool or clammy skin, a weak or rapid pulse, and dilated pupils.Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome, 1998-2015. 12 April 2015. Causes The Notch-signaling pathway is involved in multiple processes during heart development, along with Wnt signaling. Cardiomyocyte differentiation, patterning of the different cardiac regions, valve development, ventricular trabeculation, and outflow tract development have all been shown to depend on the activity of specific Notch-signaling elements. The importance of Notch signaling in human disease is evident from the discovery that many mutations in components of this pathway are inherited in several genetic and acquired disorders, though one cannot acquire hypoplastic right heart syndrome. Some of the mutations are thought to be on chromosome 2. Other deletions are thought to be chromosomal arms 9q34 and 20p12, which contain NOTCH1 and JAG1 and deletion of band q22 or q24. Wnt signaling also plays a role along with Notch 1,2 and JAG in the formation of cardiac tissues and heart development. When there are mutations in the Notch and Wnt pathways, Notch and Wnt are either not signaled or inhibited. These pathways have to signal proteins and other pathways, like Tbx2, 3 and 20, Bmp2, 10, and Hey1 and 2 which play a major role in different parts of the heart developing. When these proteins and other pathways are not signaled or are inhibited abnormalities form. Pathogenesis When the right side of the heart is more underdeveloped than the left side, this is known as hypoplastic right heart syndrome. HRHS is known for the pulmonary atresia valves, the tricuspid valve, and the hypoplastic pulmonary artery fail to form properly. HRHS also causes the right ventricle to be a fair amount smaller than the left side.CHD-UK, Hypoplastic Right heart Syndrome (HRHS), 2007-2015. 25 April 2015. In people with hypoplastic right heart syndrome, the heart is not able to adequately pump blood to the lungs. The result of this is an inadequate supply of oxygenated blood to be circulated to the body. The severity of underdevelopment varies for each individual. A special team of pediatric cardiologists is required to develop a treatment plan. =Anatomy= A healthy heart has four valves, separated by flaps that open and close to control blood flow between the chambers. When the heart beats, oxygen-poor blood enters the right atrium. The blood then flows into the right ventricle, where it enters the pulmonary artery to travel to the lungs for oxygen. Oxygen-rich blood returns to the left atrium, where it then travels into the left ventricle. The left ventricle pushes the oxygenated blood into the aorta to be circulated to the rest of the body.Heart Contraction and Blood Flow . National Institutes of Health. The heart is a mesoderm-derived organ; Mesoderm is the middle germ layer of an embryo, whose formation is regulated by various genes. Initially, the most important is expression of Nkx2.5, CR1, pitx2, anf and mhc2a, is responsible for differentiation of the types of cardiomyocytes to determine which part of the heart they go to. In a later in differentiation, activation of hand1, hand2 and other genes was revealed to help in development. Expression of these genes expression is regulated by various processes, including transcription and growth factors, as well as proteins like fibrillin, Wnt, BMP2, BMP 4, BMP5, BMP7, which aid in different heart development features like the valves and septum, and other substances, such as retinoid and folic acid. Crucial steps in heart formation are development of the ventricles and atrium formation, as well as septation and valve formation. Any disturbances of such processes may lead to various congenital heart diseases and defects that could be initiated by various genetic, epigenetic or environmental factors. The most common heart malformations from genetic or epigenetic problems are: stenosis of the aorta and pulmonary trunk, which is a narrowing of the vessels, atrial and/or ventricular septal defect, tricuspid atresia, hypoplastic left and right heart. When you have hypoplastic right or left heart more than one of these problems occur together. Diagnosis If a cardiac anomaly is suspected in a routine ultrasound during pregnancy, often a perinatologist (maternal- fetal specialist) will perform a fetal echocardiogram (noninvasive ultrasound of the fetus heart), which may be able to confirm a diagnosis of HRHS. This can help with possible options for treatment. Treatment There is no cure for hypoplastic right heart syndrome. A three-stage surgical procedure is commonly used to treat the condition. The surgeries rearrange the blood flow within the heart and allow the left ventricles to do the work for the underdeveloped right side of the heart. The three surgeries are spread out over the patients first few years of life. The first procedure, usually either the Norwood procedure or BT shunt, is typically done within the first few days or weeks of life. The second procedure, called the Glenn procedure, is usually performed between four and twelve months of age. The last surgery, known as the Fontan procedure, is typically performed around the age of 18 months and older. These surgeries change the blood flow to the lungs so that there is always oxygenated blood. In a stage 1 Norwood procedure for hypoplastic right heart, the main pulmonary artery is separated from the left and right portions of the pulmonary artery and joined with the upper portion of the aorta. The proximal pulmonary artery is connected to the aortic arch, while the narrowed segment of the pulmonary trunk is repaired. An aortopulmonary shunt is created to connect the aorta to the main pulmonary artery to provide pulmonary blood flow to the lungs. The Glenn procedure disconnects the superior vena cava from the heart and connects it to the right pulmonary artery so deoxygenated blood from the upper body goes directly to the lungs. The Fontan procedure, done usually after the patient is two years old, disconnects the inferior vena cava from the heart and connects it directly with the other pulmonary artery so that deoxygenated blood from the lower body then is sent directly to the lungs. =Follow-up care= With a series of operations or even a heart transplant, a newborn can be treated but not be cured.

A part of a notable business family based in and around Trondhjem, Jenssen founded Ranheims Papirfabrik, and also served one term in the Parliament of Norway. Personal life He was born in Ranheim as a son of businessman Lauritz Dorenfeldt Jenssen (1801‚Äì1859) and his wife Karen Amalie Hagerup (1811‚Äì1890). He was a brother-in-law of Jens Jenssen, grandson of businessman Matz Jenssen and nephew of Jens Nicolai and Hans Peter Jenssen.Personalhistorie for Trondhjems by og omegn i et tidsrum af circa 1 1/2 aarhundrede, by Chr. Thaulow. Hosted by Trondheim public library. Through his mother he was a first cousin of Prime Minister Francis Hagerup, and nephew of Henrik Steffens Hagerup. In March 1862 Jenssen married J√∏rgine Wilhelmine Darre (1842‚Äì1910) She was a daughter of Hans J√∏rgen Darre and hailed from Kl√¶bo.Genealogical entry for Lauritz Dorenfeldt Jenssen Their sons Hans J√∏rgen Darre-Jenssen and Worm Hirsch Darre-Jenssen both entered national politics; serving as Minister of Labour in the early twentieth century. Another son Lauritz Jenssen Dorenfeldt was a notable engineer and had a son also named Lauritz Jenssen Dorenfeldt, a notable jurist. Career Ranheim, the farm where Lauritz Jenssen was born, had been bought by his father in 1834. He enrolled as a student in 1854, and after graduating in machine engineering from the Polytechnische Schule Karlsruhe in 1860, Lauritz Jenssen returned to Norway. His mother, who, being a widow, had run the farm for one year, but Jenssen became manager in 1860 and owner in 1867. The farm also featured a mill and a rolling mill for copper. The mills were closed in 1897. He instead founded the cellulose factory Ranheim Cellulosefabrik, with construction starting in 1882 and operation in 1884. In 1890‚Äì1891 it was reorganized into the paper mill Ranheims Papirfabrik. Jenssen served as its technical director for some years, but the factory struggled financially and it was taken over by Christian Christophersen in 1894. Ranheim farm was not a part of the deal, and Jenssen died there in June 1899. He was elected to the Parliament of Norway in 1880, representing the constituency of S√∏ndre Trondhjems Amt. He only served one term. He also served as mayor of Strinden municipality in 1888 and 1889, and was a member of the municipal council for many years, starting in 1870. Jenssen co-founded and chaired the local branch of the Association of Hunters and Anglers. He was also among the proponents for the establishment of the Norwegian Institute of Technology. It was rejected during his lifetime but finally established in 1910. Legacy Jenssen was a member of the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters from 1869, and was decorated as a Knight, First Class of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav and as a Knight of the Order of Vasa. A street in Strinda was named after him in 1932. The factory he founded still exists.

Historically, bents were a common way of making a timber frame; they are still often used for such, and are also seen in small steel-frame buildings, where the term portal frame is more commonly used. The term is also used for the cross-ways support structures in a trestle. In British English this assembly is called a \\"cross frame\\". The term bent is probably an archaic past tense of the verb to bind, referring to the way the timbers of a bent are joined together. The Dutch word is bint (past participle gebint),Woordenboek van de Limburgse dialecten II-9, Volume 2; Volume 9 By Antonius A Weijnen Joep Kruijse the West Frisian is , and the German is . Compare this with the term bend for a class of knots. Bents are the building blocks that define the overall shape and character of a structure. They do not have any sort of pre-defined configuration in the way that a Pratt truss does. Rather, bents are simply cross-sectional templates of structural members, i.e., rafters, joists, posts, pilings, etc., that repeat on parallel planes along the length of the structure. The term bent is not restricted to any particular material. Bents may be formed of wooden piles, timber framing,Charles Lee Crandall and Fred Asa Barnes, Railroad Construction, McGraw Hill, New York, 1913; Section 97, Principles of Construction, pages 213-215. steel framing, or even concrete.W. S. Lacher, The Track Elevation Subways in Chicago, Railway Age Gazette, Vol 56, No, 10 (March 6, 1914); page 461. Construction Bents are generally pre-assembled, either at the timber framing company's shop or at the construction site. After the basic post and beam structure of the frame has been set in place, the bents are then lifted and simply dropped into place one by one by the crane. Next, the workers bring in additional members, purlins, which tie them together and give the frame a more rigid structure. This process is very safe and efficient, as it allows a crew to assemble a large portion of the frame without ever stepping off the ground. This, in turn, minimizes the amount of time that the crew must spend several stories in the air clambering along beams not much wider than their own feet.

In 2009 and 2010, the Waterfront Alliance worked with the City of New York to develop and execute a public input process for the update of the Comprehensive Waterfront Plan. MWA initially had worked with the New York City Council to pass legislation requiring the update of the 1992 Comprehensive Waterfront Plan, announced by City Council Speaker Christine Quinn at the Waterfront Alliance's 2008 City of Water Day. The Plan was released by the NYC Department of City Planning in 2011 as Mayor Bloomberg‚Äôs Vision 2020: New York City Comprehensive Waterfront Plan. In 2010, Waterfront Alliance joined with the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) to create the New York-New Jersey Harbor Coalition. This bi-state coalition of nonprofit organizations is an advocacy campaign to help secure the federal and state funding needed to transform the NY-NJ Harbor to meet the environmental, recreational, and economic needs of the region‚Äôs 22 million residents. In addition to the Waterfront Alliance and the NPCA, the current Coalition members include: The Environmental Defense Fund, Hudson River Foundation, Ironbound Community Corporation, NY/NJ Baykeeper, NYC Environmental Justice Alliance, Regional Plan Association, Trust for Public Land and WE ACT.

It is named after Giuseppe Saverio Poli. Description C. stellatus is a sessile barnacle that attaches to rocks and other firm materials in the intertidal zone using its membranous base. It is basically cone-shaped but can assume a more tubular shape in a crowded colony. Like other sessile barnacles, as an adult C. stellatus is a suspension feeder that stays in its fixed shell and uses its feathery, rhythmically beating appendages ‚Äì actually modified legs ‚Äì to draw plankton and detritus into its shell for consumption. The chalky white shell of C. stellatus has a kite- shaped opercular opening when it is a juvenile and an oval operculum opening when it is an adult. The shell is made up of six solid wall plates of approximately equal size. Its relatively narrow rostral plates remain separate from its rostrolateral plates and do not fuse. C. stellatus has bright blue tissue with black and orange markings which can be seen when its opercular aperture is not tightly closed. Depending upon environmental conditions and the amount of food available, it can reach up to in diameter. Reproduction Like most barnacles, C. stellatus is hermaphroditic and capable of self- fertilisation when isolated, but individuals typically take on either a male or female role in order to mate. Their penises are significantly longer than their bodies and are used by the stationary \\"functional males\\" to search the area for an equally stationary \\"functional female\\" neighbour to fertilise. Barnacles of this species produce about 1,000 to 4,000 eggs per brood when functioning as female. The fertilised eggs remain inside the shell of the adult until they are released as nauplii, free swimming larvae which float on currents along with other plankton. After several moults they metamorphose into a cyprid, a stage at which they cannot feed. The cyprid swims in search of a suitable surface on which to attach itself, head first, in order to metamorphose into the familiar, hard-shelled, immobile form. The duration of its breeding season can be temperature dependent, and it produces fewer broods near the northern limit of its range. Habitat and range C. stellatus attaches to exposed rocky shores in the mid to low eulittoral zone in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean. It especially favours islands and headlands as opposed to bays and more protected areas. It is a southern, warm-water species but has been discovered as far north as Shetland and as far east as the Isle of Wight. The vertical distribution of C. stellatus overlaps with Chthamalus montagui (considered the same species as C. stellatus until 1976) and Semibalanus balanoides with the specific prevalence of one species over another in a given locale possibly related to differences in the distribution of the species' larval stages.

Treat's contributions to both botany and entomology were extensive‚Äîfour species of plants and animals were named after her, including an amaryllis, Zephyranthes treatae (now called Zephyranthes atamasca var. treatae), and two ant species (Aphaenogaster mariae and Aphaenogaster treatae).  Early life  Born Mary Davis to a middle-class family in Trumansburg, New York, she was mostly raised in Ohio, where she attended public and private girls' schools. Davis married Dr. Joseph Burrell Treat, an abolitionist and professor, in 1863; they lived in Iowa and in 1868 they moved to Vineland, New Jersey. Career and research Drosera anglica with prey After her move to New Jersey, Treat began her scientific studies in earnest, and collaborated with her husband on entomology articles and research. Treat‚Äôs first scientific article was a note published in The American Entomologist when she was 39 years old. Over 28 years she wrote 76 scientific and popular articles as well as five books. Her research quickly expanded from entomology to ornithology and botany, detailing bird and plant life in the southern New Jersey region. Following separation from her husband in 1874, Treat supported herself by publishing popular science articles for periodicals such as Harpers and Queen. Beginning in 1870, she published popular naturalist pieces in Garden and Forest, Hearth and Home, Harper's, and Lippincott's. Her book, Injurious Insects of the Farm and Field, originally published in 1882, was reprinted five times. She also collected plants and insects for other researchers, one of whom was the eminent Harvard botanist Asa Gray. It was through Gray that she was introduced to Charles Darwin. Treat wrote letters to engage in botanical and entomological discourse not only with Darwin and Gray, but Auguste Forel and Gustav Mayr as well. She traveled to Florida several times between 1876 and 1878 to investigate insectivorous plants further. On one of these trips, she discovered the lily Zephyranthes treatae (named after her by Sereno Watson) and discovered that another lily was not extinct. = Collaboration with Charles Darwin = The first recorded correspondence between Treat and Darwin originates from 20 December 1871 in which Treat describes the fly-catching activities of Drosera, commonly known as sundew plants. Treat and Darwin‚Äôs recorded correspondence extends over five years around the period of time when Darwin was researching, and then publishing, on carnivorous plants. They predominantly discuss these plants in their correspondence (although not the only theme, they also discussed controlling sex in butterflies), and Treat openly critiqued Darwin‚Äôs hypotheses. One notable exchange concerned the bladderwort plant, Utricularia clandestina.Traps of Utricularia aurea Darwin‚Äôs teacher and mentor at Cambridge, John Stevens Henslow, had a clear understanding of the morphology of Utricularia (bladderwort) plants, but was not able to understand working mechanics of their traps.Walters, M. (2001) Darwin‚Äôs Mentor: John Stevens Henslow 1796-1861 Cambridge and New York: Cambridge University Press Darwin incorrectly concluded that animals entered the traps by forcing their heads through the slit-like orifice with their heads serving as a wedge. In a letter to Treat he informed her that this subject drove him ‚Äòhalf-mad‚Äô. Treat became deeply absorbed in this problem, researching intensively.Treat, M. (1875) ‚ÄòPlants that eat animals‚Äô Gardener‚Äôs Chronicle, March, 6th pp.&nbsp;303‚Äì304 Through long hours of observing the trapping sequence under her microscope she realised that the hairs around the entrance to the trap were sensitive and part of the process by which Utricularia traps opened, contributing new knowledge on the range of microscopic animal prey caught in these traps and the digestive processes they were subjected to. Treat described it as ‚Äòthese little bladders... in truth like so many stomachs, digesting and assimilating animal food‚Äô. Darwin was so impressed with Treat‚Äôs work on carnivorous plants that he referenced her, both within the main text and in footnotes, throughout his publication Insectivorous Plants (1875).Darwin, C. (1875) Insectivorous Plants London: John Murray By making such public affirmations of Treat‚Äôs scientific work, Darwin legitimized her role as a scientist, though this is not completely uncontested among historians .Gianquitto, T.

A shell star is a star having a spectrum that shows extremely broad absorption lines, plus some very narrow absorption lines. They typically also show some emission lines, usually from the Balmer series but occasionally of other lines. The broad absorption lines are due to rapid rotation of the photosphere, the emission lines from an equatorial disk, and the narrow absorption lines are produced when the disc is seen nearly edge-on. Shell stars have spectral types O7.5 to F5, with rotation velocities of 200‚Äì300 km/s, not far from the point when the rotational acceleration would disrupt the star. Spectrum The shell stars are defined as a group by the existence of rotationally broadened photospheric spectral lines in combination with very narrow absorption lines. Emission lines are frequently present but not regarded as a defining feature. The exact spectral lines present vary to some extent: Balmer emission lines are very common, but may be weak or absent in cooler stars; FeII lines are common but not always present; helium lines may be seen in the hottest stars. The photospheric lines are rotationally broadened showing projected velocities of or more. The line profiles in shell star spectra are complex, with variable wings, cores, and superpositions of absorption and emission features. In some cases, particular absorption of emission features are only visible as modifications to a line profile, or a weakening of another line. This leads to double and triple- peaked lines, or asymmetric lines. Shell stars very commonly have emission lines and thus are often Be stars, although they can also occur in spectral classes O, A, and occasionally F.  Subtypes  Shell stars have been subdivided into four categories, although these categories are no longer recognised as meaningful and are rarely seen in modern publications: * early Be stars of spectral types O7.5 to B2.5 * middle Be stars of types B3 to B6.5, * late Be stars of types B7 to B9.5, and * A-F shell stars ranging from A0 to F5. The vast majority of known shell stars are of spectral class B. However, partly because of this many cooler shell stars have remained undetected. The Be phenomenon, and hence the term Be star itself, is now widely applied to similar stars not only of spectral class B, but also A and sometimes O and F.  Variability  Shell stars often show variability in their spectra and brightness. The shell features may come and go, with the star changing from a shell star to a normal B star or Be star. Shell stars which show irregular variability due to changes in, or the disappearance of, the \\"shell\\" are called Gamma Cassiopeiae variables. Pleione and Gamma Cassiopeiae itself are both variable stars that have intermittent shell episodes where strong shell features appear in the spectrum and the brightness increases or decreases significantly. At other times the shell is not detectable in the spectrum, and even the emission lines may disappear.

Salary Oropesa is estimated to have earned $1.15 million total in 3 of the 4 major league seasons he appeared in (2001, 2002, and 2004). Pitching Style Eddie Oropesa threw three pitches, a fastball, slider and changeup. Oropesa's pitching delivery was unique. Against right- handed hitters, he went from the full windup. He would hide the ball by turning his back to the hitter utilizing a high leg kick and release the ball from a high three-quarters arm angle. Against lefties, he would work exclusively from the stretch, even with no runners on base. Against lefties, he would turn his back slightly however his leg kick was not nearly as exaggerated and he would use a sidearm release point. This delivery made it really tough for lefties to hit him, as they only hit .242 against him in his entire career. However, these inconsistent mechanics often led to control problems.

Geography Keiskammahoek is a small rural town that is situated some forty kilometers to the West of King William's Town in the Amahlathi Local Municipality, which is one of seven local municipalities that constitute the Amathole District Municipality, Eastern Cape. Keiskammahoek is surrounded by a number of villages and peri-urban settlements that support the town. Keiskammahoek is situated near the headlands of the Keiskamma River catchment area. It is located in the centre of four different biomes: Albany Thicket, Grasslands, Savannah and Afromontane forest. History The town was once an important commercial centre for the timber and agricultural industries. The settlement of the area since the 1800s also led to the large-scale exploitation and destruction of the natural environment. The timber industry has moved towards Stutterheim and the agricultural production has declined somewhat. Just outside the town is St Matthew's High School, one of South Africa's historic schools. Founded as a mission school by Bishop of Grahamstown John Armstrong in 1854, the school was once a particularly thriving educational centre, and the large parish church is a local landmark. A hospital and training facility for nurses was opened at the site in 1923 and the secondary school began in 1926. Like other church schools, the Anglican Church withdrew from direct involvement in the school as a result of the 1953 Bantu Education Act. The state bought much of St Matthews‚Äô land in 1970, and in 1976 the hospital was taken over by the Ciskei government. It closed ten years later, moving to Keiskammahoek, where it became known as the SS Gida Hospital. The high school continues as a state boarding school for girls (with male day students). A small clinic remains on the school site, and the ruins of many of the school's buildings are everywhere evident. Currently the economy of Keiskammahoek relies mainly on grants from the State. The population has been steadily declining and many villages are still without basic services such as water and sanitation. However, the town still maintains some of the remnants of the historic past and there are a number of historic buildings to be found such as the Gilead Church. Health facility Keiskammahoek houses the medium-sized S.S. Gida Hospital, a Provincial government funded hospital for the Amahlathi area. Tourism Accommodation near Keiskammahoek can be found at Cata Lodge, which is located at Cata Village 17km outside of Keiskammahoek Town. Cata Lodge is a community-owned and -run initiative. It also offers the option of homestays, with various trained hosts in the village. Cata Lodge is the start of the Cape Parrot Day Hiking Trail. It also offers mountain biking as well as flyfishing and bird watching.

In some cases, it can be asymptomatic, and in other cases it can lead to fluid accumulation and cardiopulmonary collapse. Symptoms and signs Congenital heart defects may not show signs or symptoms until later stages of the child's life and have a delayed diagnosis. Congenital stenosis of the inferior vena cava is asymptomatic in many patients. Adolescent males with the condition have shown to presents with symptoms such as spontaneous lower extremity DVT, leg swelling, leg pain, varices in the lower extremities, hepatic thrombosis and hematochezia. Chylothorax has been observed rarely as a symptom of congenital stenosis of the superior vena cava in infant patients. Chylothorax results as a rare complication in which chyle leaks into the thoracic space following direct incidental damage and can also lead to increased thoracic duct pressure. Chylothorax leakage commonly occurs in patients with additional complex congenital heart lesions, increasing the risk of underlying vascular anomalies. Other symptoms which may become present later than adolescence includes venous hypertension, post necrotic hepatic cirrhosis and portal hypertension from the manifestation of the condition. Diagnosis  Congenital stenosis of the vena cava is a sub-classification of the overarching spectrum of congenital heart disease involving the vessels surrounding the heart resulting in disruption to normal cardiovascular blood flow. Diagnosis commonly occurs in early adolescence, expressed as symptoms such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) occurring spontaneously. The mainstay diagnosis of the presenting DVT symptom is an ultrasound with venous Doppler. Ultrasound with venous Doppler rarely identifies the inferior vena cava anomalies present from birth. Difficulties in identifying the congenital stenosis of the vena cava makes diagnosis uncommon. Diagnosis of congenital stenosis of the inferior vena cava can be rarely discovered through abdominal CT examinations, and may present with an array of clinical findings dependent on the drainage patterns of the individuals. Further diagnostic tools such as a transthoracic echocardiogram can reveal the narrowing of the vena cava showing a low velocity of flow. Congenital stenosis of the vena cava can also present as acute respiratory failure and effusion of the right lung on chest X-rays. Treatments Treatments may not be necessary for the congenital heart defect. If required, treatments can include medication, catheter procedures, corrective surgery and heart transplants dependent on the severity of the defect, age of the patient and patient's general health. Symptomatic relief of venous hypertension, associated with the congenital heart defect, can be achieved through surgery as it reduces the likelihood of hepatic vein thrombosis. Intravascular stents are a treatment method for Congenital Stenosis of the Vena Cava. Expandable metallic stents have been used as part of a procedure to dilate and maintain stenotic vena cava. Experiments carried out on mongrel dogs resulted in some failures for dilation and early migration, and occlusion complications in patients. Immediate relief of persisting symptoms occurred in two patients. Double balloon dilation is another technique used to treat stenosis of the vena cava. Double balloon dilation involves catheters inserted in the left and right femoral vessels placed parallel to stenotic lesions and inflated simultaneously. The two balloon technique creates a substantial decrease in pressure gradients by achieving greater dilation from the use of two smaller balloons as opposed to a single large balloon. Balloons are inflated and deflated repeatedly to reduce the resistance of the vessels to inflation. Once the balloons are removed an end-hole catheter is passed over the wires to ensure a moderate systemic pressure drop occurs and then a stent is placed. Substantial pressure drops are common following single balloon dilation procedures. Hydrophilic catheter treatments can also be used through placement of the catheter through the femoral veins to access the stenosis in the vena cava to measure haemodynamic and angiography. Angiography allows for visualisation of the stenosis in the vena cava and measurements of the pressures and length of narrowing can be obtained from the technique, including the narrowest diameter of the stenosis. Balloon angioplasties can also be performed in the narrowed vena cava using Sterling balloons. Dilations are also performed with higher pressure Dorado balloons, using the same wire as the Sterling balloon. Sustained results of increased flow and significant reduction in obstructions following stent implantation occurs from balloon angioplasty treatments. Occurrences Congenital stenosis of the vena cava is a rare congenital heart disease affecting 0.7 - 8.7% of the population. Vena cava anomalies are very rare and arise from incorrect development in the foetal heart. The genetic occurrence leading to this condition is unknown but current studies identified the disease symptoms presents predominantly in adolescent males. Prevalence of the condition is very low as stenotic anomalies in vena cavae development are uncommon. Recognition of vena cava anomalies is difficult and can result in minor complications if left unrecognised. Surgery is carried out for presenting symptoms associated with the condition. Difficulties in diagnosis contribute to the low incident rates as many people live asymptomatically with this disease for many years, having no impact on the patients‚Äô life.

It linked the former county town of M√ºnchberg in the Bavarian province of Upper Franconia with the market town of Zell im Fichtelgebirge. This standard gauge, single tracked Lokalbahn ('local line') was 10 km long and was opened on 17 October 1902 by the Royal Bavarian State Railways. The line started at M√ºnchberg station, which was on Ludwig's South- North Railway between Hof and Neuenmarkt-Wirsberg, and ran at first in a southeasterly direction to the market community of Sparneck. It then turned southwest and finally reached its terminus, the climatic health resort of Zell at 631 m above sea level on the northern edge of the Waldsteingebirge mountains. The line climbed a height of almost one hundred metres as it made its way from M√ºnchberg to Zell. On workdays there were usually four to six pairs of trains; on Sundays even as many as seven. With the improvement in economic circumstances after the Second World War passengers increasingly turned to buses and private cars. Nevertheless, due to thriving tourist traffic, the line survived for a long time until both passenger and goods services were withdrawn on 25 September 1971.

The disagreements concerned natural gas supplies, prices and debts. The conflict started in March 2005, ended in January 2006 and, in addition to the gas companies, involved politicians from both countries. The conflict began when Russia claimed that Ukraine was not paying for gas and was diverting gas bound from Russia to the European Union from pipelines that crossed the country. Ukrainian officials at first denied the last accusation, but later Naftogaz admitted it used some gas intended for other European countries for domestic needs. The dispute peaked on January 1, 2006 when Russia cut off supply. The cutoff affected gas supplies to European countries that depended on Russian natural gas. On January 4, 2006 a preliminary agreement between Ukraine and Russia was achieved, the supply was restored and the situation calmed. Historical background After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia began charging market prices to Ukraine for oil in 1993, but both Ukrainian gas import prices and transit fees for Russian exports to Europe were set in bilateral negotiations, well below European levels. In 2004‚Äì2005, about 80% of Russian gas exports to the European Union passed through Ukraine. Two-thirds of Gazprom's revenue comes from the sale of gas that crosses Ukraine. Ukraine's own gas consumption in 2005 was around , of which around were produced domestically, were bought from Turkmenistan, and came from Russia as payment for Russian gas transit. It purchased the remaining from Russia. Relatively cheap Russian gas, sold to Ukraine at $50 per cubic meter between 1998 and 2005, supported growth of energy-intensive industries in Ukraine, its status as one of the world's least energy-efficient countries and largest gas importers, expansion of Ukrainian debts. Eventually, Ukraine failed to pay its debts, diverted gas from the transit system; and came under Russian pressure to relinquish infrastructure in return for debt relief. Gas trading was conducted under bilateral intergovernmental agreements providing a framework for sales, transit volumes and prices and sometimes other issues such as storage and establishment of joint production ventures. The relevant companies signed contracts in accord with the agreements, supplemented by annual refinements specifying exact prices and volumes for the following year. Gas prices and transit tariffs were set in relationship to each other. Commercial agreements and trade relations have been non-transparent. Trade was conducted by Itera, EuralTransGaz, and since 2004 by RosUkrEnergo, a company with no assets, no track record, and no transparency about its owners. RosUkrEnergo beneficiaries include well-placed officials in Russian and Ukrainian gas industries and governmental structures. RosUkrEnergo is allegedly half-owned by a business ally of Ukraine's President Viktor Yushchenko. Deal Struck to End Gas Cutoff, The New York Times, January 8, 2009 The Ukrainian investigation into RosUkrEnergo, during Yulia Tymoshenko's previous term as Prime Minister, was closed after Yushchenko fired her in September 2005. Mogilevich Arrested With Arbat Boss , The Moscow Times, January 28, 2008 According to the contract between Gazprom and Naftogaz signed on June 21, 2002, payment was in the form of barterup to 15% of gas pumped through the Ukrainian territory was taken by Ukraine instead of cash. This contract was supposed to be valid until the end of 2013. On August 9, 2004, the two companies signed a contract addendum setting the transit tariff at US$1.09 per 1,000 cubic meters per . This tariff was the basis for computing the amount of gas delivered in lieu of cash. The amendment fixed the gas price at $50 per 1,000 cubic meters (approximately $1.40 per million Btu), independent of European market prices. According to the addendum the price was not subject to change until the end of 2009. In 2005, Gazprom argued that this addendum was only applicable provided that the two countries sign an annual intergovernmental protocol having higher legal status for specifying the terms of gas transit. According to Gazprom, the addendum was void because the annual protocol had not been signed for 2006 under the required terms. Russia claimed that Gazprom's subsidies to the Ukrainian economy amounted to billions of dollars. 2005 negotiations In March, Gazprom informed Ukraine that it was raising prices to market levels, charging $160 per 1,000 cubic meters (approximately $4.40 per million Btu). Ukraine's new government agreed to pay the higher prices in return for increased transit fees. Russian newspaper Kommersant daily, Tuesday, March 29, 2005 Ukraine took steps to change the payments for the transition of Gazprom's gas to Europe from barter to cash. Yushchenko agreed to pay higher prices only over time, stating that Ukrainian industry would become unprofitable with gas above $90. of natural gas which Gazprom had deposited in Ukrainian storage reservoirs during the previous winter had disappeared. It remained unclear if the gas had leaked away, had been stolen, or if there was another cause. In July by agreement, Gazprom, Naftogaz and RosUkrEnergo reached a preliminary agreement. Naftogaz received of natural gas as partial settlement of 2005 transit services and was sold by Gazprom to RosUkrEnergo who was to receive it from Naftogaz. During the final three months of 2005, negotiations between Gazprom and Naftogaz stalled. Gazprom demanded a 2006 price of $160‚Äì230 per 1,000 cubic meters unless a Gazprom/Naftogaz consortium took over transmission. Ukraine agreed presuming it was phased in and that the maximum it was prepared to pay in 2006 was $80 per 1,000 cubic meters. In November, Ukraine proposed to pay for gas with weapon supplies as one option. Some Ukrainian officials called for a review of the lease price Russia paid to Ukraine for keeping its Black Sea Fleet in Sevastopol, Crimea, while Russia resisted any discussions that might affect the lease. On December 8, Russian President Vladimir Putin noted that Ukrainian consumers pay less for gas than do Russians. He claimed that Ukraine had enough money to pay market price. Putin also noted that Russia subsidized Ukraine by $1 billion a year from the Russian budgetmoney that Gazprom would have paid from its revenues. He also noted that 25 million Russians live below the poverty line, further questioning Ukraine's deal. On December 13, Gazprom stated that unless an agreement were reached before January 1, 2006, it would cut Ukraine off. Gazprom also stated its readiness to create a joint venture to own and operate Ukraine's gas transit pipelines. After Ukraine rejected this proposal, Gazprom stated that the new price would have to be 220‚Äì230 per 1,000 cubic meters (~ $6.35/million Btu), claiming that this was the market price. Ukraine then requested international arbitration. On December 15, Ukraine offered a joint-venture for selling gas in the internal Ukrainian market in exchange for gradual price increases up to 2010. Gazprom declined. On December 26, Prime Minister Yuriy Yekhanurov asserted that Ukraine had a contractual right for 15% of the gas transiting to the European Union. This statement came largely in response to the Gazprom threat to resort to the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce should Ukraine engage in unlawful withdrawal of Russian transit gas. Earlier, Yekhanurov announced that Ukraine could refer the case to the Institute if the compromise was not reached. On December 29, Putin offered Ukraine a $3.6 billion loan to cover the increase in gas prices. Yushchenko rejected the offer. In the last days of 2005, European countries, which had stayed out of the dispute, began advocating for a compromise. On December 31 Putin offered to postpone the price increase until April 2006 if Ukraine immediately agreed to the new prices. Ukraine did not agree. Andrei Illarionov, then Putin's economic adviser, resigned rather than explain the price hike and other issues of Russia‚ÄìUkraine relations as liberal economic policies. Cut-off Then President of Russia Vladimir Putin at a meeting on 29 December 2005 with Alexei Kudrin (Russian Finance Minister), Viktor Khristenko (Russian Energy Minister), Alexander Medvedev (Deputy Chairman of the Gazprom board), Ivan Plachkov (Ukrainian Energy Minister) and Alexey Ivchenko (CEO of Naftogaz), in which the dispute was discussed. On January 1, 2006 Gazprom started reducing pressure in the pipeline system ahead of the deadline of the Russian ultimatum set for 10:00 MSK. At the same time Russia accused Ukraine of stealing $25 million worth of gas. Ukraine denied the allegation. On January 24, Naftogaz admitted withholding some Russian gas intended for other European countries, but said it would still meet its contractual obligations. A spokesman for Naftogaz said the gas was needed to cope with especially cold weather. European gas imports were declining, whether from Ukrainian expropriation or Russian undersupply. Gazprom invited the Switzerland-based goods inspection and testing company SGS to monitor the amount of gas that is entering Ukraine's pipeline network. The EU's contract with Gazprom requires the supplier to deliver to the former USSR's border, i.e., Ukraine's western border. Therefore, if Ukraine interferes with delivery, the EU can sue Gazprom for contract violations. As soon as the supply began to fall in the EU, Gazprom was forced to return supplies to normal. Impact on Europe Many European countries saw a drop in the supply of gas: * AustriaRussian supplies down by around 33% * Bosnia and Herzegovina100 % * Croatia100 % * France25-30 % * Germanysupplies down by an unspecified amount * Hungary 40 % * Italy24 % (6% of total imports) * Republic of Macedoniasupplies down by around 100% * Poland14 % * Romania20 % * Serbia100 % * Slovakia 33 % * Slovenia33 % (40% of average annual gas supply). Agreement to end the dispute Then President of Russia Vladimir Putin and President of Ukraine Viktor Yushchenko hold a joint press conference in Astana on 11 January 2006. On January 4, Russia and Ukraine ended the dispute. A five-year contract was signed, although with prices set for six months only. According to the contract, the gas was sold not directly to Naftogaz, but to RosUkrEnergo, who paid $230 per 1,000 cubic metres. After mixing it with two thirds of cheaper supplies from Central Asia RosUkrEnergo resold it to Ukraine at a price of $95 per 1,000 cubic metres. The parties also agreed to raise the transit tariff from US$1.09 to US$1.60 per 1,000 cubic meters per 100 km. This price also held for transit of Turkmen gas through Russia to Ukraine. The company had to buy from Russia at $230 per 1000 cubic meters, from Turkmenistan and Kazakhstan at price of $60‚Äì65 per 1000 cubic meters, and then sell it to Ukraine at US$95 per 1000 cubic meters. Besides, RosUkrEnergo had to transport from Turkmenistan to Ukraine at price US$1.60 per 1000 cubic meters per 100 km, or $1,920 million. Total expenses become US$2,500 +US$3,800 + US$1,920 million, or US$8.2 billion. Revenues from selling the gas are just $5.5 billion. International reactions According to the Russian news agency ITAR-TASS, economic ministers of Germany, Italy, Austria and France warned Ukraine that their nations' relations with Ukraine could be affected if it failed to deliver gas according to the contract schedule. On January 3 Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Fradkov asked the European Union to influence Ukraine to ensure gas transit from Russia to EU countries. On January 3 and 4 Austrian Minister of Foreign Affairs Ursula Plassnik supported resumption of gas supplies by Gazprom and emphasized that a lasting solution was preferable to unilateral measures. According to Pascal Lamy of the World Trade Organization, all Post-Soviet states that buy gas from Gazprom should pay market prices to improve the efficiency of their economies. Illarionov noted there is no such thing as a market price for gas, because Russia offers different terms for analogous countries, e.g. gas price for Ukraine is not calculated in the same way as for Germany. Alleged political motivation Tents in Kyiv during Ukraine's 2004 Orange Revolution European and U.S. media cited sources who saw the conflict as punishing the new 'orange' Government of Ukraine, which was considered more pro-NATO and EU than its predecessor, despite the fact that the country paid less than (fellow post-Soviet state) Georgia and other European countries. Russian officials state that the country can no longer subsidize former Soviet republics. However, when the 'orange' Government of Ukraine was ousted later in 2006 and replaced by a new more Moscow-friendly Government led by Viktor Yanukovych, the price for 2007 still grew to $135 per 1,000 cubic meters (from $95 in 2006). Earlier in 2005 Gazprom declined Turkmenistan's offer to buy natural gas at $58 per 1,000 cubic meters as too expensive, but in December 2005 it agreed to buy additional of gas at $65. Oil and gas prices doubled during 2005.  Public reaction  Political pressure Russia to Ukraine during the gas conflict led to the emergence of a public campaign to boycott Russian goods in Ukraine. In December 2005, unknown activists in Kirovohrad distributed leaflets calling not to buy Russian goods. Then various social and political movements in Ukraine picked up the idea, which got wide publicity and support.

After studying in Nuremberg, he immigrated to Israel in 1933. He served as head of the graphics department of Keren Kayemet, the Jewish National Fund, from 1936 to 1957. He founded Koren Publishers Jerusalem in 1961, which published the Koren Bible in 1962. He published the Koren Siddur in 1981, and various religious texts until his death. Biography Eliyahu Koren (n√© Korngold) was born in Nuremberg, Germany. He showed a rare artistic talent from an early age. After studying at the Gymnasium, Korngold attended the Kunstschule der Stadt Nurnberg, the city's School of Graphic and Applied Art, completing a six-year course of graphic art, applied art, and stained glass in three years. In 1933, when he was an assistant to a professor at the Kunstschule, and a youth leader in the Ezra religious youth movement, Korngold read that Bavarian Jews were being required to carry special secret police travel permits to travel abroad. \\"I saw by this verdict divestiture of the freedom of the Jewish individual, and decided to leave Germany at the earliest possible hour,\\"Avrin, Leila. \\"People of the Book: Eliyahu Koren\\", Israel Bibliophiles, Spring 1986. he would later recall. Korngold and a group of friends left Bavaria on April 1, 1933, and arrived in Haifa, Palestine on May 15 of that year. For six months, Korngold worked for one of the few graphic designers in Palestine at the time, Rudi Deutsch (Dayan), in Tel Aviv. Next he prepared illustrations for various books and exhibitions. From 1936 to 1957, Korngold headed the graphics department of Keren Kayemet, the Jewish National Fund, where he was responsible for graphics, publications, stamps, and the organization's Golden Book. During that time, he also designed the present coat of arms of the city of Jerusalem.Jeremy Stolow, Orthodox by Design: Judaism, Print Politics, and the ArtScroll Revolution University of California Press, 2010 =The Koren Bible= By the mid-late 1950s, Korngold had begun to work on what would become his most significant work, The Koren Bible. Korngold was committed to publishing a Hebrew Bible designed, edited, printed, and bound by Jews‚Äîsomething that had not been accomplished in nearly 500 years. The first printed Hebrew Bibles from Italy (1488) were printed by Jews, but after Daniel Bomberg's 1517 Venice printing, all editions up to the 20th century had non- Jewish publishers or printers, and errors had found their way into the text. Korngold had been approached by Judah L. Magnes, then president of The Hebrew University in Jerusalem about creating a new font for a new edition of the Hebrew Bible in the 1940s. Korngold set to work on a font and won a competition for the project, but following years of work on the University's Bible Committee, which Korngold chaired, the project moved in a direction that he and many Bible scholars found unacceptable. Rather than create a wholly new edition of the Bible, in 1953 Hebrew University Press published a photographic offset of Christian David Ginsburg's British and Foreign Bible Society edition to which hundreds of corrections had been made by Umberto Cassuto on the basis of the Aleppo Codex and other very old manuscripts, producing a text of unprecedented accuracy.Leon Simon, \\"The Jerusalem Bible\\", Vetus Testamentum, 4, 109-110 (1954) Korngold resigned from the committee. He then set himself to the task of producing a new edition of the Hebrew Bible on his own. In 1957, he established an independent studio, and in 1961 founded Koren Publishers Jerusalem. Korngold worked painstakingly on the project, correcting typesetting errors of previous editions, and creating a new font, Koren Bible Type to enable the text to be as accurate and legible as possible. The text, vocalization, and cantillation were based on a Bible edition of the early 19th century German Jewish grammarian and masoretic scholar Wolf Heidenheim. Avraham Meir Habermann, Daniel Goldschmidt, and Meir Medan proofread and edited the text. In 1962, during the Chanukah holiday, Koren Publishers Jerusalem published the Torah, the first part of The Koren Bible. The entire Bible appeared nearly two years later. During this time, Korngold changed his name to Koren. The Koren Bible was immediately recognized as the new standard Hebrew Bible. In response to its publication, David Ben-Gurion declared, \\"Israel is redeemed from shame.\\" The Chief Rabbinate of Israel accepted the edition for reading Haftarah (prophetic portions) in synagogues when the handwritten parchment scroll is not used. The Koren Bible became the Bible on which the President of Israel is sworn into office. The Israel Ministry of Education and Israeli municipalities began distributing The Koren Bible as gifts to high school graduates, and the Israel Defense Forces began distributing The Koren Bible to newly inducted soldiers. However, the quality of the text has been criticized by scholars. For example, Moshe Goshen- Gottstein said: \\"Since he was aware of his lack in masoretic expertise, he sought the help of three scholars, all of who suffered from the same lack of masoretic expertise ... while the publisher made persistent claims that this was the first edition set and printed in their old/new homeland, this was, in fact ... hardly an edition like that of Dotan, but another rehash of the material prepared by ben Hayim.\\" \\"Sha'are Talmon, ed. Michael Fishbane and Emanuel Tov, Eisenbrauns, 1992 pages 239 & 240. Koren Publishers Jerusalem later published a Hebrew/English edition of the Koren Bible with a new translation by Professor Harold Fisch, a Biblical and literary scholar. =The Koren Siddur= Koren began work on a new prayerbook in the 1970s. Koren created Koren Book Type for the project, and an innovative design for which the siddur would become famous. Rather than allow the text to run continuously across page turns, Koren maintained lines and paragraphs within individual pages. He set individual sentences line by line, according to their meaning. The result was a prayerbook, published in 1981, that facilitated uninterrupted prayer and elucidated the underlying meaning of the text. The siddur became one of the most widely used prayerbooks in Israel. In 2009, Koren Publishers Jerusalem introduced a new Hebrew-English edition of the Koren Siddur, the Koren Sacks Siddur, with an introduction, translation, and commentary by Chief Rabbi of the United Kingdom, Rabbi Lord Jonathan Sacks.

Ludwig Erwin Alfred \\"Dutch\\" Katterfeld (1881‚Äì1974) was an American socialist politician, a founding member of the Communist Labor Party of America, a Comintern functionary, and a magazine editor.  Biography  = Early life = L.E. Katterfeld (he seems to have generally used his initials in daily life) was born on July 15, 1881 in Strasbourg, Alsace- Lorraine, then part of the German Empire. He was the eldest of 4 children born to Dr. Alfred Katterfeld, a professor at the University of Strasbourg and Adele Karpinski Katterfeld. L.E.'s mother died when he was 5, shortly after the birth of his twin sisters, and his father remarried but died shortly thereafter. L.E. was sent away alone to live in the United States with a \\"godfather\\" in Nebraska at the end of 1892, arriving in New York on January 17, 1893 aboard the steamer Friesland. Young L.E. worked as a farmhand in harsh rural conditions for several years, running away to Kansas at age 16. He finished at the top of his 8th grade class in Cloud County in 1898, also winning the Kansas state oratorial championship. He went on to finish high school and attended Washburn College in Topeka from 1902 to 1908, while working in a livery stable. While at Washburn College, L.E. met his future wife, Berta Pearl Horn. After graduation, he persuaded Berta to follow him to Chicago, where the pair were married on October 10, 1910. = Socialist Party years (1905‚Äì1919) = Katterfeld was attracted to radical politics from an early age, joining the Socialist Party of America (SPA) in 1905 as a college student.Branko Lazitch and Milorad M. Drachkovitch, Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern: New, Revised, and Expanded Edition. Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution Press, 1986; pg. 212. He was elected as a delegate to the 1908 National Convention of the SPA from Kansas. In June 1911 he was named the head of a short-lived Socialist Party \\"Lyceum Bureau,\\" which coordinated speaking tours by socialist organizers and propagandists, a program which was terminated in 1913. Katterfeld subsequently moved to Washington state in the Pacific Northwest, a state with a bitterly divided state Socialist Party. On June 18, 1914, in accordance with the wishes of the National Executive Committee of the SPA, a \\"Unity Conference\\" joining the bitter factions of the Washington state party was held. The gathering elected Katterfeld as the new State Secretary of the Socialist Party of Washington,Jeffery A. Johnson, \\"They Are All Red Out Here\\": Socialist Politics in the Pacific Northwest, 1895‚Äì1925. Edmonds, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 2008; pg. 140. a post in which he served through 1915. He was elected by the Socialist Party of Washington as its representative on the Socialist Party's National Committee in 1915 (a body which met annually in a gathering akin to a national convention). The Washington party was long among the country's most radical. There he met future close associates Alfred Wagenknecht and Elmer Allison. In 1916 the ambitious Katterfeld was a candidate for National Executive Secretary of the Socialist Party, finishing 4th of 4 candidates. He was also the Socialist Party's candidate for Governor of Washington that fall.Johnson, \\"They Are All Red Out Here,\\" pg. 210. In 1917, the Katterfeld family moved back to Kansas, settling in Dighton, where his wife's father owned a farm.Theodore Draper, The Roots of American Communism. New York: Viking, 1957; pg. 427, fn.8. Detail on farm from the 1999 recollections of one of L.E. Katterfeld's daughters. He was elected as a delegate from that state to the 1917 Emergency National Convention of the Socialist Party. At the convention, Katterfeld was a strong supporter of the party's vigorously antimilitarist St. Louis resolution against American participation in World War I. He was elected to the National Executive Committee of the Socialist Party in 1918. He left the farm in Kansas to live in Chicago at about this time. = Communist Party years (1919‚Äì1929) = L.E. Katterfeld was a dedicated member of the Left Wing Section of the Socialist Party from its earliest days in 1919. He was one of the Left Wing's endorsed candidates in the 1919 party election for National Executive Committee, the results of which election were overturned by action of the outgoing NEC on which he sat. Katterfeld was a delegate to the 1919 Emergency National Convention of the Socialist Party on August 30, 1919, and was one of the first to bolt to the previously arranged alternative convention downstairs. After two days, this alternative \\"Socialist Party\\" convention organized itself as the Communist Labor Party (CLP). Katterfeld was one of five people elected to the governing Central Executive Committee of the CLPBranko Lazitch and Milorad M. Drachkovitch, Biographical Dictionary of the Comintern: , pg. 212. and served as Organization Director from 1919. Katterfeld remained one of the top leaders of the CLP and its organizational successors, the United Communist Party of America and the unified Communist Party of America (CPA) into the middle 1920s. Katterfeld was a defendant in the July 1920 trial of the Communist Labor Party, at which Clarence Darrow served as chief attorney. Katterfeld was found guilty of violating the state's criminal syndicalism law and sentenced to 1 to 5 years in the state penitentiary and fined $2,000. Freed pending appeal, Katterfeld did not immediately serve time on this sentence, instead serving as Executive Secretary of the unified Communist Party of America, using the pseudonym \\"John Carr,\\" from July 27 through October 15, 1921, and which time the Central Executive Committee of the CPA dispatched him to Moscow as the representative of the CPA to the Executive Committee of the Communist International. Katterfeld occupied this position from November 1921 through March 1922. He was elected by the 1st Expanded Plenum of the Executive Committee of the Communist International to the Presidium of ECCI on March 2, 1922. Back in the United States, Katterfeld was elected by the ill-fated 1922 Bridgman Convention of the CPA once again to the governing National Executive Committee of the party. He also served provisionally as Executive Secretary for the organization for about two weeks at the end of August and into September 1922. The CEC once again named Katterfeld its representative to the Comintern in Moscow on September 5, 1922, ending his brief stint as party chief.Abram Jakira, \\"Letter to the Executive Committee of the Communist International in Moscow from Abram Jakira, Executive Secretary of the Communist Party of America, Sept. 17, 1922.\\" Corvallis, OR: 1000 Flowers Publishing, 2007. He made his way to Soviet Russia once again, where he served as CI Rep until the first week of December, when he turned over his job to Otto Huiswoud and returned to the United States, due to the needs of his 1920 legal difficulties. Katterfeld was once again elected to ECCI by the 4th World Congress of the Comintern in December 1922. While he was elected to the Central Executive Committee of the Workers Party of America by the 3rd Convention of that organization at the end of 1923, Katterfeld was at the time in prison at Joliet, Illinois in connection with his 1920 conviction. He sat one year in prison, assisting with the bookkeeping at the institution. Katterfeld was the manager of the eastern agency of the Daily Worker Publishing Co. in 1926 and 1927. Whittaker Chambers described in his memoirs at some length: > Katterfeld looked like the type of Communist I had hoped to find on my first > visit to the English-speaking branch. He was a German-American, humorless, > grave, with a lined, austere face. He had been an unsuccessful Kansas wheat > farmer, graduating from a native school of agrarian radicalism. Poverty was > a vocation with him. His frayed overcoat was the uniform of his faith, and, > like everything else about him, it was of a piece with a revolutionary > integrity that shone from him more purely than from almost any other > American Communist I knew. He lived in a little house on Long Island in the > same woods where I had wandered as a boy, for, like me, he did not like > cities. He had a big family of boys and girls, and, when I had come to know > him better, he once confided to me with wistful dismay that his children > \\"regarded the Communist Party the way Communists regard capitalism‚Äîas a > cause of poverty and exploitation.\\" They wanted to live like other people > and detested Communists and Communist meetings. During the party's > underground days Katterfeld had briefly been the party's acting secretary. > But his revolutionary intelligence was not quite up to his revolutionary > spirit.

When the Lovestoneites > took power in the party, Katterfeld withdrew from it. = Post-Communist years (1927‚Äì1974) = Cover of the first issue of Katterfeld's Evolution, December 1927. The scientific theory of evolution was a hot-button political issue during the decade of the 1920s, fueled by the sensational \\"Scopes Monkey Trial\\" of July 1925. In December 1927, Katterfeld launched a new magazine published in New York City called Evolution, at which he worked as managing editor. The publication's initial issue declared the publication's name was chosen \\"because the evolutionary concept of man's development is the idea which fundamentalists have seized to build an issue,\\" thus symbolizing \\"the entire conflict between those who see life through the eyes of science and those who look upon it through the misty superstitions of the past.\\"\\"Our Name,\\" Evolution, vol. 1, no. 1, (December 1927), pg. 8. Katterfeld declared that his new publication would be \\"non-political, so that all upholders of academic freedom can support and use it no matter how they differ on other issues\\" as well as \\"non-religious, never making any effort to reconcile science with religion\\" while at the same time making no attempt to \\"make atheism its mission.\\"\\"Our Policy,\\" Evolution, vol. 1, no. 1, (December 1927), pg. 8. The non-political and independent status of Evolution proved to be a problem for Katterfeld with respect to his continued membership in the Communist Party, however. Katterfeld was expelled from the Communist Party early in 1929 in connection with his refusal to relinquish control of this publication to the party. Evolution was initially a 16-page monthly publication, but the magazine moved to a bimonthly publication schedule in 1929. The magazine was formally a quarterly from 1930 but was in practice published infrequently, with only 6 issues appearing between June 1930 through January 1938.\\"Evolution: A Journal of Nature: History and Downloads,\\" University College London, Department of Science and Technology Studies. Retrieved February 10, 2010. Contributors to Evolution include both scientific-minded figures from the socialist movement, such as Maynard Shipley, Ernest Untermann, Allan Strong Broms, and V. F. Calverton, leading rationalists like Joseph McCabe, and figures from the academic world, including Harry Elmer Barnes, Federic A. Lucas, and William K. Gregory. The magazine went on hiatus from May 1932 until publication of the June 1937 issue. Katterfeld spent much of the Great Depression on the road promoting his financially floundering magazine. At the time of the publication's restart, Katterfeld wrote to his readers: > \\"During the five years since the last issue of Evolution appeared I have > canvassed for it in practically every city of over 100,000 in the United > States and a great many smaller communities, all the larger colleges and > universities, and hundreds of high schools in 45 states and in Canada. In > securing over 4,000 subscribers personally I probably talked about Evolution > with over 20,000 persons, traveled 30,000 miles by bus and train, walked at > least 12,000 miles, and rode an equal distance by street busses and cars. > And I am more convinced that there is a need and a real field for Evolution > than I was before I started. > > \\"Although I did not succeed in finding an 'angel' for this enterprise, I > now feel that through this field-work a sufficient foundation has been laid > to justify resuming publication.\\"L.E. Katterfeld, \\"A Personal Word,\\" > Evolution, vol. 4, no. 1 (June 1937), pg. 2. An ambitious schedule of 10 issues per year for the rejuvenated publication was planned. The restart proved to be unsuccessful, however, and the publication was terminated effective with its next issue, dated January 1938. Katterfeld became interested in the cooperative movement in his later years and continued to commute to an office in New York City until he was nearly 90 years old. = Death and legacy = Katterfeld died in New York state on December 11, 1974. While he did not leave papers to a university library, in 1956 Katterfeld shared his recollections of the early Communist movement with historian Theodore Draper, then engaged in research on his book The Roots of American Communism, published by the Viking Press in 1957.

The father, Ray (John Savage) is a Vietnam War veteran who was left impotent from a war injury. His high school son Jimmy West (Ryan Phillippe) tries to protect his two younger brothers from their abusive father. There is a family secret that gets revealed. Plot Living in the backwoods of Texas is the dysfunctional and apparently incestuous family: a psychotic war veteran father, Ray West, a compliant wife, Kate, and a 19-year-old son, Jimmy, who is relegated to a warehouse outside the family home. Ray and Kate seem to be a normal couple running their bar, raising their two sons, but as they return home from work Ray turns violent and abusive. At his insistence, Kate and Jimmy were having a shocking and strong sexual relationship. Ray goes even so far as to call Jimmy \\"Little boy blue\\", and to shout that 'he knows' Jimmy likes it. As it turns out, during Jimmy's conversation with his girlfriend, Traci Connor, he rejects a full scholarship for college. He cannot leave his brothers with his father. He explains that if he is not there Ray will take all his rage onto his little brothers, which he finds not tenable. Traci can understand that, but she cannot give up her own future, and so they eventually break up. The movie ends with their probable re-engagement. In the course of the events, it becomes clear that Ray harbors a secret he cannot share with anyone. When a stranger appears in his bar and wants to befriend Ray, the latter gets suspicious, and attempts to knock down the man. He kills someone who appears to be a private detective. Jimmy starts becoming suspicious about his father being a murderer, and one night when Kate visits him in the warehouse he asks her to take the boys and leave Ray for good. She declines for reason of panic. Kate explains that she cannot imagine what she can do in such a frightening place, unbeknownst to her. Ray enters the warehouse and upon seeing Kate in Jimmy's arms, he generates' a ruckus, and insists that Kate and he should tell Jimmy the truth. Kate manages to calm him down, but, Jimmy is still too frustrated, and the next morning he goes to Traci's place to talk to her and to say his final goodbye. She listens to his shocking story about Ray's abusive behavior, and is startled when Jimmy says that he cannot leave his own sons with such a Vietnam-traumatised monster. He leaves her house and goes back to his place. On his way he is stopped by Ray who takes advantage of the absence of Kate and the boys and tells Jimmy that he needs to know who he really is and why he keeps on calling Jimmy \\"Little boy blue\\". Figuring out where Ray is going, Jimmy wants to stop him, and a fight is started for which Ray is obviously ready, and has been expecting it all along. A few days after that Jimmy is nowhere to be seen, with everyone except Traci assuming that he has left the town. A mysterious woman, Doris Knight, appears in town looking for her private detective. As the police interrogate her, the secret unfolds about Ray, Jimmy, and herself. Years ago she had met Ray when she, her husband, and their newborn baby where driving their family minivan, and Ray needed a ride. While Ray had complimented them on their beautiful baby-boy, and conducted a cheerful, friendly conversation, she was reading a book to her son, the same \\"little boy blue\\" book Ray had been keeping among his personal things, and which Jimmy had taken from his elder son earlier to prevent Ray from punishing the boy for stealing, without any hint of what was coming. Hours after they had picked up Ray, she was tied to a tree, beaten severely, her partner killed, and watching as Ray walked away with her son, got into the minivan and drove away. As she breaks into tears while telling the story, she does not forget to mention that \\"it was 19 years ago and that nobody helped her then and did not find her son.\\" The police send her to her motel room, and guard her so she will not do anything \\"stupid\\" before they get an order to interrogate Ray, but she slips away at night and goes directly to Ray's house. With the boys out at the lake, and Kate out in the warehouse to find a hints as to where Jimmy might have gone, Ray wakes up to find her pointing a gun to his head. While he starts mumbling that she has got the wrong person, that he has not done anything bad to her, she shoots him several times and heads to the warehouse, where Kate is hiding near Jimmy's bed. As the woman starts looking around the place, she finds the \\"Little boy blue\\" book lying on the table, and breaks into tears. Right then she hears Kate crying, too, and without any remorse shoots her dead as well. The boys, who had been hiding under the house, run towards the warehouse, but are stopped by a police officer, who had come to find the woman. She comes out of the warehouse waving her gun at the officer, and as she is about to shoot, she is shot dead by the policeman. The boys spend the night in the police car, and in the morning the elder brother remembers that their father had been recently working a lot around their minivan. The policeman sets everyone to work and as the minivan, and the soil under it, are removed and they find doors in the ground. As the doors are opened, the viewer gets an inside look at unconscious Jimmy, tied up to the wooden shelves like on a cross, all bloody and bruised. As the ambulance is cutting the ropes and placing him in the ambulance car, Jimmy has a vision of his future. There he is a policeman, married to Traci, playing with his sons and his newborn baby in the park. As he slowly wakes up from his dreams, he hears his sons calling his name, and assuring them that everything's okay, and that he is never going to leave them, Jimmy smiles. The final scene shows the ambulance car drive away as the credits start to roll.

Education F√°bregas graduated in geography and history at the Universidade de Santiago, Fabregas. A Spaniard by birth, he first came to the U.S. in 1979. He had moved to New York City to work at the UN Headquarters. Soon thereafter, he took up permanent residency in New York. He later moved to California to earn a graduate degree at UC Berkeley. AIDS activism Then, in 1989, came the devastating discovery that Tomas was HIV positive. His response was to abandon his professional aspirations and launch himself into AIDS activism. That same year he joined the San Francisco AIDS Foundation as a volunteer and was placed in the organization's Public Policy Department. He and his partner, Jeffrey L. Brooks, made the decision to move to San Francisco. Both became involved in AIDS activism with organizations such as AMFAR. Later he joined the board of directors at the San Francisco AIDS Foundation, one of the organizations which fights against the spread of the disease in the city. Tomas made significant contributions to AIDS activism during his time with the San Francisco AIDS Foundation. In 1990, he was a major contributor in the creation of a multilingual newsletter for HIV- positive people. That same year he was elected to the San Francisco AIDS Foundation's board of Directors as well as the Healing Alternatives Foundation's Board of Directors. In 1992 he attended the AIDS International Conference in Amsterdam on behalf of the above-mentioned organisation. At that time the US Government passed a law which banned entry to HIV positive people into the country. F√°bregas disclosed his HIV status publicly at the conference and announced he was to challenge the Bush (senior) administration to detain him at the border. But the law was never applied. Upon his arrival at the San Francisco airport, he was welcomed by several AIDS activists. Fabragas died from AIDS complications on September 22, 1994. Legacy The San Francisco AIDS Candlelight Vigil grants its annual Tom√°s F√°bregas Awards to reward AIDS activists. Furthermore, his involvement in this cause was acknowledged by UNESCO and the San Francisco City Hall.

He succeeded Yohannan VIII Hormizd, the last of the Mosul patriarchs who traced their descent from Eliya VII (1558‚Äì91), and his elevation ended four centuries of hereditary succession in the Eliya line. After Zaya's accession the Vatican attempted to reform abuses within the Chaldean Church, but its interference was strenuously resisted by several Chaldean bishops. As a result, Zaya's short reign was plagued by one crisis after another. In 1846, after the Vatican conspicuously failed to support him against his recalcitrant bishops, he resigned the patriarchate and retired to his native town of Khosrowa, where he died in 1855. He was succeeded by Joseph VI Audo, one of his most determined opponents. Early years Zaya was born in Khosrowa (), a village near Salmas in the Urmia region of Persia. In his youth he studied for several years at the College of the Propaganda in Rome. According to the missionary Sheil, who met him in Dilman in 1836, Zaya studied at the Propaganda for fifteen years and was an outstanding scholar.Sheil, Journey through Kurdistan, 54‚Äì5 He was ordained a priest c.1830, and was consecrated coadjutor bishop of Salmas in 1836 by the Chaldean patriarch Yohannan Hormizd.Wilmshurst, EOCE, 198, 313 and 740  Succession to the patriarchate  On 13 October 1837, conscious that he had not long to live, Yohannan Hormizd designated as coadjutor and 'guardian of the throne' Gregory Peter di Natale, metropolitan of Gazarta, presumably with the intention of excluding his nephew Eliya from the patriarchal dignity. However, he did not promise the succession to his coadjutor, and in a bull of 25 September 1838 the Vatican appointed Nicholas Zaya Yohannan's coadjutor, with the right of succession. The main reason for the Vatican's intervention was to ensure that the hereditary principle, first introduced into the Church of the East in the fifteenth century, would play no part in the selection of the next patriarch. The bull mentioned Yohannan Hormizd's growing infirmity and the desirability of avoiding inconvenience and harm should the patriarchate suddenly become vacant. As a Persian by birth, Zaya could lay claim to the protection of the foreign consuls in Turkey. He had also been educated at the Propaganda, and it was hoped that after Yohannan's death he would loyally implement Vatican policy.Giamil, Genuinae Relationes, 400‚Äì1 The bull of appointment arrived in Mosul after the death of Yohannan Hormizd, thus Nicholas Zaya became patriarch in 1839 and was confirmed by the pope on April 27, 1840. The Chaldean metropolitans Lawrent Shoa of Kirkuk, Basil Asmar of Amid, Joseph Audo of Amadiya and Mikha'il Kattula of Seert, angered that they had not been consulted in the choice of Yohannan Hormizd's successor, met in the spring of 1839 in an attempt to elect one of their number patriarch, but were unable to agree. Meanwhile, Zaya retained the support of the Vatican's apostolic vicar, Laurent Trioche, and the metropolitan Gregory Peter di Natale, who wrote to the Vatican denouncing the conduct of the other bishops and requesting an unequivocal show of support for the new patriarch. The Vatican confirmed Zaya's succession on 27 April 1840, and directed the Chaldean bishops to obey him.Badger, Nestorians, i. 168  Patriarchate  Because the manner of his succession was resented by most of the Chaldean hierarchy, Nicholas I Zaya had throughout his short reign limited control over his bishops. He began by directing Joseph Audo to leave Amid for Amadiya, so that he could properly administer his metropolitan province, but eventually agreed to let him reside at Alqosh. He also, like his predecessor, had to reckon with the intransigence of the monks of the monastery of Rabban Hormizd, and friends of the patriarch said later that he would have closed down the monastery if he had dared. Instead he permitted 45 elderly monks, including the priest Mikha'il, to retire to lay life. This indirect approach so reduced the number of monks that the monastery thereafter lost much of its former influence.Badger, Nestorians, i. 168 In 1843, after the Nestorian patriarch Shemon XVII Abraham (1820‚Äì61) declined to join a Kurdish expedition against Amadiya, the Kurdish emirs Nurallah Khan and Bedr Khan Beg attacked the mountain Nestorians of the Hakkari region of eastern Turkey, with the connivance of the Ottoman authorities. The Kurds invaded the Tiyari, Walto and Dez districts, sacking the Nestorian town of Ashitha and burning most of the villages. About 10,000 men out of a total population of about 50,000 in these three districts were killed, and many women and children were carried off by the Kurds as captives. Mar Shemon's elderly mother was raped and then beheaded, and her murderers threw the corpse into the Zab. Those who survived the massacre, including the patriarch himself, took refuge in Mosul.Badger, Nestorians, i. 270‚Äì1 The Kurdish attack on the mountain Nestorians had indirect consequences for the Chaldean Church. Early in 1843 an attempt by Zaya to reform the church calendar by adopting the Western date for Easter aroused strong resentment among the Mosul Chaldeans, and provoked a movement, in which the Anglican missionary George Percy Badger was implicated, to depose him and replace him with Yohannan Hormizd's nephew Eliya. Eliya was unwilling to challenge the patriarch's authority, and Zaya's opponents turned instead to the Nestorian patriarch Shemon XVII Abraham, then a refugee in Mosul, urging him to lay claim to the patriarchate himself. Zaya and the French missionaries who supported him complained vigorously to the Turkish authorities, and wrote to the British embassy in Constantinople to protest at Badger's interference. The Turkish government was initially reluctant to intervene, because of Zaya's ambiguous status as a Persian national, and Zaya finally took his cause to Constantinople, where through the influence of the French embassy he obtained a firman recognising the Chaldean church as a separate millet and acknowledging him as patriarch. The Anglican mission was withdrawn from Mosul, and Badger returned to England in disgrace.Badger, Nestorians, i. 169‚Äì70 After his return from Constantinople in 1845, Zaya did what he could to undermine the influence of the old patriarchal family. Mar Eliya was not allowed to exercise his episcopal functions, and the monks of the monastery of Rabban Hormizd were encouraged to claim a number of strips of property around Alqosh which may once have belonged to the monastery but had for years been considered as possessions of the patriarchal family. The French consul supported these claims, and the disputed lands were awarded to the monastery. According to Badger, 'two hundred and fifty persons were deprived of their patrimony and reduced to beggary through this joint agency.' Badger persuaded the British consul to intervene, and part of the property was eventually restored to its previous owners.Badger, Nestorians, i. 171‚Äì2  Resignation and death  The intrigues against Zaya continued into 1846. His opponents accused him of embezzling church funds, which he had in fact used to restore the monastery of Mar Giwargis near Mosul, and spread rumours, 'generally believed to be without foundation', according to Badger, of immoral conduct. As a result, he was summoned to Rome by the Vatican authorities for these allegations to be investigated. He refused to obey the summons, and left Mosul for his native village of Khosrowa, where he resigned the patriarchate in May 1847. He remained in Khosrowa until his death in 1855.Fiey, POCN, 39; Wilmshurst, EOCE, 740 Notes References   * Hornus, J.-M., 'M√©moire sur l'√©tat actuel et l'avenir de la religion catholique et des missions lazaristes et protestantes en Perse par le Comte de Challaye, consul de France √† Erz√©roun' (Cahiers d'√âtudes Chr√©tiennes Orientales 8-9 f√ºr 1970/73), Action Chr√©tienne en Orient, Strasbourg o.

The park was landscaped with advice from Humphry Repton, starting in 1799. Following the death of the 7th Earl Cowper in 1905, the estate was inherited by Ethel Grenfell, Baroness Desborough and, after she died in 1952 with no heir, the estate was sold in lots by auction the following year, but there was no interest in the house itself and it was demolished between 1953 and 1954. A large portion of the outlying farms forming part of the estate had been sold by auction on 30 May 1919.Hertfordshire Archives and Local Studies Panshanger orangery The park contains the largest maiden (not pollarded) oak in the country, with a circumference of 7.6 metres. It is believed to have been planted by Queen Elizabeth I. Acorns from the tree have been used as seedlings for notable oaks in other parts of the country, such as the Prince Consort Oak in the Forest of Dean. Winston Churchill planted a sapling from the tree in the park and the tree can still be seen in the grounds. Panshanger Park and nature reserve Geese at Panshanger nature reserve Panshanger Park is owned by Tarmac Holdings which extracts sand and gravel from the site. Although Panshanger House was demolished, the orangery, nursery garden wall, stables, and a number of cottages and estate buildings remain, all of which are listed by English Heritage. The eastern end has been open since 31 March 2014 as a 1,000 acre country park and nature reserve - with 200 acres open to the public. The park consists of wetlands, grasslands and reedbeds which serve as a home for a wide variety of damselfly and dragonfly species. The park is also home to kingfishers, waterfowl and osprey. The rest of the site will be opened as gravel extraction is completed. Panshanger district The Panshanger district of Welwyn Garden City, and the nearby Panshanger Aerodrome, are named after the Panshanger estate.

It was released in England in 1959, and shown in the U.S. in 1960.Woods and Baddeley, p. 197 The plot is a \\"whodunit\\" with false leads and a denouement in which the least likely character, in this case \\"Sir David Rogers\\" played by Ewen Solon, is revealed as the culprit.Meikle, pp. 76‚Äì77 As in Matters' book, The Mystery of Jack the Ripper, Solon's character murders prostitutes to avenge the death of his son. While Matters had the son dying from venereal disease, the film has him committing suicide on learning his lover is a prostitute.Meikle, p. 79 Plot In 1888, Jack the Ripper is on his killing spree. Scotland Yard Inspector O'Neill (Byrne) welcomes a visit from his old friend, New York City detective Sam Lowry (Patterson), who agrees to assist with the investigation. Sam becomes attracted to modern woman Anne Ford (McDowall) but her guardian, Dr. Tranter (Le Mesurier), doesn't approve. The police slowly close in on the killer as the public becomes more alarmed. The killer's identity is revealed and he meets a ghastly end.

It linked the town of Fichtelberg in the Upper Franconian county of Bayreuth with Neusorg station in the Upper Palatine county of Tirschenreuth on the main line from Nuremberg to Cheb. This standard gauge, single-track Lokalbahn ('local line') was 14.7 km long and was opened on 20 December 1890 by the Royal Bavarian State Railways. The line ran in a northwesterly direction along the valley of the Fichtelnaab river up into the Fichtelgebirge mountains. Passing through Ebnath and Brand it reached its terminus, the climatic health resort of Fichtelberg at a height of 720 m above sea level, where, for centuries, there had been a mining industry. The town was the highest terminal station of all branch lines in the Fichtelgebirge mountains. During the early decades no more than three pairs of trains ran daily on workdays fuhren, in 1939 there were four and in 1957 even as many as eight. On Sundays the number of trains rose from three to six over the course of the years. As the Deutsche Bundesbahn (DB) increasingly withdrew itself from the area, services reduced from 1975 to just one train, which left in the morning during the week from Fichtelberg to Kirchenlaibach and returned from Schirnding in the evening. The rest of the time a DB bus was laid on. On 30 May 1976 passenger services on the railway stopped completely. Goods traffic continued until 30 September 1984, and an industrial siding on the other side of Brand was worked until the end of the year.

Development The Short Type 166 was designed as a 'folder' aircraft to operate from the Ark Royal as a torpedo-bomber. Six aircraft, known within Shorts as the Type A, were originally ordered before the outbreak of World War I, and were assigned the Admiralty serial numbers 161 to 166. As was normal at the time, the type was designated the Admiralty Type 166, after the naval serial number of the last aircraft in the batch. Sometimes, the aircraft are referred to as the Short S.90 (S.90 was the manufacturer's serial number of the first aircraft, naval serial 161). The Type 166 was similar to the earlier Short Type 136, but slightly larger, and was designed from the start as a torpedo carrier, although it was never used in that r√¥le.Barnes & James, p.101. Design The Type 166 was a two-bay biplane with twin wooden pontoon floats, with a water rudder fitted to the tail float, plus a stabilizing float mounted near the wingtip under each lower wing. It was powered by a nose- mounted 200 hp (149 kW) Salmson engine. A follow-on order for 20 aircraft was assembled by Westland Aircraft at its Yeovil factory.Westland History ‚Äì Short 166 The Westland-built aircraft did not have provision for a torpedo, but could carry three 112 lb bombs, and were fitted to carry radio equipment.

Cookeina is a genus of cup fungi in the family Sarcoscyphaceae, members of which may be found in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. Species may be found on fallen branches of angiosperms, trunks, and sometimes on fruits.Weinstein RN, Pfister DH, Iturriaga T. (2002). A phylogenetic study of the genus Cookeina. Mycologia 94(4): 673‚Äì682. The Temuans of Peninsular Malaysia are reported to use certain species from this genus as food, and also as a bait for fishing, where it is rubbed against the hook.Chang YS, Lee SS. (2004). Utilisation of macrofungi species in Malaysia. Fungal Diversity 15: 15‚Äì22.PDF Description Species in the Cookeina have a deep, cup-shaped to funnel-shaped fruiting bodies, or apothecia. The inner spore-bearing surface of the apothecium, the hymenium, is brightly colored, yellow to red, although the color will fade upon drying. The outer surface is less brightly colored. The excipulum, the tissue making up the walls of the apothecium, is thin and flexible. When hairs are present on the apothecium, they are fasciculate‚Äïmade of bundles of cylindrical hyphae. =Microscopic features= The Cookeina have asci which are constricted abruptly below and form a blunt, rounded base with a slim, tail-like connection. They have asci which mature simultaneously rather than in series.Boedijn KB. (1933). The genera Phillipsia and Cookeina in Netherlands India. Annales du Jardin Botanique de Buitenzorg, S√©ries 3. 13: 57‚Äì76. They have paraphyses which anastomose and form a three-dimensional network. Ascospores are large (20‚Äî40 ¬µm long), ellipsoidal or slightly unequal-sided, and either smooth or ornamented with fine wrinkles. The genus appears to be restricted to wood, commonly to wood in early stages of decay.Denison WC. (1967). Central American Pezizales. 2. Genus Cookeina. Mycologia 59(2): 306‚Äì. Mechanism of spore release When mature apothecia become filled with water, the asci absorb some of that water and develop a Turgor pressure, a hydrostatic pressure within the ascus which put pressure on the tip of the ascus, held in place by the rigid ascus wall. As the water level in the cup reduces due to evaporation, the asci tips dry out, resulting in a negative vapor pressure that ultimately results in the thin tissue at the wall of the apex (the operculum) breaking outward, releasing the spores.Zoberi MH. (1973). Influence of water on spore release in Cookeina sulcipes. Mycologia 65(1): 155‚Äì160. Phylogeny Phylogenetic analyses of ribosomal DNA has helped to clarify the evolutionary and genetic relationships amongst the species in Cookeina. The species C. speciosa, C. tricholoma, and C. sinensis belong to a monophyletic group, and all are hairy, with stipes, and lack a well-defined layer of slime in the excipulum at maturity. Another monophyletic grouping contains the species C. Venezuela and C. colensoi, which do have a slime layer on the excipulum, and have either short stipes or not at all (sessile). In this analysis, C. indica and C. insititia did not clearly resolve with the other clades. The presence of some unique physical characteristics in the species C. insititia has made its taxonomic status uncertain, and a source of some debate in the literature‚Äï some authors have supported its segregation into the genus Boedijnopeziza,Rifai MA.

Based on a study of ultrastructural characteristics using electron microscopy, a possible solution to the taxonomic conundrum was suggested in 2003, to segregate C. insititia into a subgenus Boedijnopeziza within the Cookeina.Melendez-Howell LM, Mascarell G, Bellemere A.

Similar genera Three other tropical genera of the family Sarcoscyphaceae, Phillipsia, Sarcoscypha, and Geodina, have brightly colored apothecia which might be confused with those of Cookeina. Although these genera may be distinguished microscopically because they all have asci which mature seriatim rather than simultaneously and paraphyses which do not anastomose to form a reticulum, distinguishing on the basis of macroscopic characters is less reliable. Species of Phyllipsia have apothecia that are saucer-shaped to discoid, thick-fleshed, and usually sessile. In Sarcoscypha the apothecia vary from saucer-shaped to cup-shaped and are usually stipitate. In Geodina the apothecia are cup-shaped, stipitate, and occur on soil. Another similar genus, Scutellinia, has eyelash-like hairs around the margin of a red or orange apothecia, but lacks a stipe.

It was announced during the January 2008 exhibition of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas and began rolling out in Panasonic Viera TVs several months later.  Development  Panasonic initially partnered with Google to make it possible for YouTube videos and Picasa Web Album photos to be used within the product, while Bloomberg News and The Weather Channel were also available. Beginning in 2009, Amazon Video on Demand service was added. The first Viera HDTVs with Viera Cast, the TH- PZ850U series, appeared in May 2008. Panasonic introduced Netflix video streaming service and Skype to its Viera Cast line-up beginning with the 2010 model year. Panasonic TV's with Viera Cast from the 2008 or 2009 model years are not able to access Netflix or Skype. Mid-2010 a Twitter service was added. The Viera HDTVs and Blu-ray players featuring Viera Cast have a built-in Ethernet interface; many models also have Wi-Fi connectivity and thus no external box or PC is required. The service is accessed via a single button on the HDTV remote. Viera announced that it would extend the feature to three series of the company's 2009 Viera G, V and Z series of HDTVs. Panasonic also has three new stand-alone players and a portable Blu-ray player that support the technology.  Availability  Availability of services differs per region/country/language. For example: In the Netherlands, it is mostly English content/services, but also some German (Bild.de, Tageschau). In Poland, users of the Viera Cast-enabled devices can access around 1,500 movies for free after Panasonic partnered with Polish Internet portal Iplex.pl as part of the company's bid to increase the uptake of interconnected television in the country. In Australia, 7plus is available on most models and Bloombergs sharemarket service was discontinued starting August 2011. The Viera Cast service is being replaced by a new platform called Viera Connect which is not backward compatible. However, if the television supported Viera Cast, it can be upgraded to the new smart TV as long as it is at least a 2010 model. The new service had an improved number of applications on offer as the platform is open to third-party developers. New features also include a remote app for easier text input and navigation using a smartphone or a tablet as well as a Viera Connect Market app store where users can download games and online services. In 2012, Panasonic added the UK BBC iPlayer service to the Viera Connect. This new content is part of the larger upgrade to the platform, which - according to the company - allowed a more robust and interactive connected TV experience.

In Indiana, it is part of the Indiana State Road system that enters between Danville, Illinois, and Foster, Indiana. The of US 136 that lie within Indiana serve as a major conduit. Some sections of the highway is listed on the National Highway System. Various sections are rural two-lane highway and urbanized four-lane divided highways. The easternmost community along the highway is Speedway, near Indianapolis. US 136 passes through farm fields and woodlands, and along the central part of Indiana. The highway was first designated as a US Highway in 1932. US 136 replaced the original State Road 33 designation of the highway which dated back to the formation of the Indiana state road system. SR 33 ran from the Illinois to Crawfordsville. US 136 also replaced the second designation of the highway, State Road 34 from the Illinois state line to Crawfordsville to Brownsburg and ended in Indianapolis. Route description US 136 enters Indiana from Illinois heading due east, before turning northeast. The highway turns back due east and has an interchange at State Road 63 (SR 63). East of SR 63 the road passes over the Wabash River and enters Covington. While in Covington the route turns south passing through residential properties, as a two-lane highway. Before leaving Covington the highway turns southeasterly, passing through farmland. Between Covington and Veederburg the highway passes over Interstate 74 (I‚Äì74). The road enters Veederburg and begins a short concurrency with US 41, heading due south. US 136 leaves US 41 turning due east, before turning southeasterly. The highway has a short concurrency with SR 25 in Waynetown. East of Waynetown the route heads toward Crawfordsville passing through farmland, with a few houses. The highway enters Crawfordsville from the northwest as a two-lane highway, passing through mainly residential. The road curves due east having an traffic light at US 231\\\\. This traffic light is also the western end of the SR 32 and SR 47 concurrences. The concurrency with both state roads end when US 136 turns southeasterly and the state roads keeping heading easterly. The highway heads southeasterly as a two-lane highway, passing through farmland with some woodlands mix in. The route enters Brownsburg at a traffic light with SR 267\\\\. After Brownsburg the highway crosses the CSX Railroad tracks. Before entering Marion County the route passes by the Lucas Oil Raceway. After the raceway the highway enters Marion County and the town of Clermont. When the route enters Marion the local name becomes Crawfordsville Road. The road leaves Clermont and enters Indianapolis, as a four-lane divided highway, passing through mainly commercial properties. The road enters the town of Speedway and has an interchange with I‚Äì74 and I‚Äì465. US 136 ends at this interchange and Crawfordsville Road continues in an east-southeasterly direction, as a city street. Crawfordsville Road ends at Sixteenth Street, near the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. The only segment of US 136 that is included as a part of the National Highway System (NHS) is the segment concurrent with US 231. The NHS is a network of highways that are identified as being most important for the economy, mobility and defense of the nation. The highway is maintained by the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) like all other U.S. Highways in the state. The department tracks the traffic volumes along all state highways as a part of its maintenance responsibilities using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). This measurement is a calculation of the traffic level along a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. In 2010, INDOT figured that lowest traffic levels were the 1,200 vehicles and 60 commercial vehicles used the highway daily between New Ross and Jamestown. The peak traffic volumes were 21,350 vehicles and 1,090 commercial vehicles AADT along the section of US 136 at the eastern terminus of US 136. History In 1918, SR 33 was commission along what is now US 136, from Illinois state line to Crawfordsville. The route was extended southeast to Indianapolis and the number changed to SR 34 on October 1, 1926 Also in that year the first section was paved, from Illinois state line to Veedersburg. By 1928 the eastern part of the road from Crawfordsville to Indianapolis was paved, leaving only between Veedersburg and Crawfordsville unpaved. In 1931, the highway was paved between Veedersburg and Crawfordsville. SR 34 was renumbered US 136 in 1952. U.S. 136 met its parent route, U.S. 36 at the intersection of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and 16th Streets. The highway had the eastern terminus moved from downtown Indianapolis to Speedway in 1991, at an interchange with I‚Äì74 and I‚Äì465.

At Huntington, US 24 turns northeast and runs to Fort Wayne; it then runs concurrently with Interstate 69 (I-69) and I-469 to bypass the city before entering Ohio at the state line east of Fort Wayne. The segment of US 24 between Logansport and Toledo, Ohio is part of the Hoosier Heartland Industrial Corridor project of the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act.  Route description  = Illinois to Logansport = This western section of US 24 is mostly rural two-lane. US 24 enters Indiana from Illinois concurrent with U.S. Route 52 (US 52). US 24 and US 52 heads east towards Kentland, passing through an intersection with State Road 71 (SR 71). In Kentland US 24 and US 52 have an intersection with U.S. Route 41 (US 41) where US 52 turns south.

In Wabash US 24 has intersections with State Road 15 (SR 15) and State Road 13 (SR 13). US 24 then heads towards Huntington passing through an intersection with State Road 524 (SR 524) and a short concurrency with State Road 105 (SR 105). On the west side of Huntington US 24 begins a concurrency with State Road 9 (SR 9). US 24 and SR 9 pass through an intersection with U.S. Route 224 (US 224)/State Road 5 (SR 5). North of Huntington, SR 9 heads north and US 24 heads northeast towards Fort Wayne. On the way to Fort Wayne US 24 passes through an intersection with State Road 114 (SR 114). Then on the west side of Fort Wayne US 24 enters onto northbound Interstate 69 (I-69). = Fort Wayne to Ohio = New Haven This section of US 24 is mostly freeway, and includes overlaps with two Interstate Highways. US 24 merges onto I-69 heading north at that route's exit 302. US 24 (along with US 30) then leaves I-69 at exit 315 to head east then south along I-469. US 24 runs concurrently with I-469 until the east side of New Haven, passing through interchanges with Maplecrest Read and SR 37 along its path. US 24 leaves I-469 at exit 21 in New Haven, a conventional parclo interchange, but from there heads northeast toward Ohio as a four-lane mostly Interstate standard rural freeway. After leaving I-469, the US 24 freeway has a substandard (short, low-speed Y-ramps of a RIRO design) interchange with Bruick Road and Old US 24 in rural Allen County. Continuing past a standard diamond interchange at Webster Road, there follows a subsequent interchange with SR 101 in Woodburn. Beyond the SR 101 junction, US 24 enters Ohio, where the freeway ends but the route continues on in the Buckeye State as a four-lane divided rural arterial highway (though full access-control extends past the state line about another 2 miles).  History  = Logansport to Fort Wayne = The original route of US 24 went through the city of Logansport, then was a two-lane undivided rural highway north of the present four-lane highway from Logansport to a point near New Waverly. From there, the original facility ran south of today's four-lane roadway, through Peru and roughly paralleling the old Wabash Railroad (now Norfolk Southern) mainline tracks into the city of Wabash. Between that city and the Wabash County town of Largo, the old road still is south of the present alignment, but from there to the west side of Huntington (at SR 9) the present four-lane facility replaced the original two-lane road. US 24 originally went through the city of Huntington, but now is bypassed to the west and north by the modern alignment. From east of Huntington to Fort Wayne the four-lane roadway was built over the two-lane highway, then known as Upper Huntington Road. = Fort Wayne to New Haven = Before US 24 was rerouted onto I-69 and I-469, US 24 went through both Fort Wayne and its eastern suburb, New Haven. It entered the metropolitan area concurrent with SR 37 on Upper Huntington Road (now Jefferson Boulevard), and picked up another concurrency with former SR 14 at Illinois Road on the west side of the city. This was also the point where Upper Huntington Road transitioned to being Jefferson Boulevard. US 24 and the state roads crossed the Saint Marys River in Swinney Park then became split through downtown Fort Wayne on a one-way pair of streets, with Jefferson Boulevard and then Maumee Avenue carrying eastbound traffic and Washington Boulevard handling westbound travel. East of downtown, SR 37 left the one-way pair of Maumee and Washington at Anthony Boulevard, departing to the north. The one-way pair merged onto Washington Blvd just east of Memorial Park, near Edsall Avenue on the east side. Just east of Fort Wayne US 24 had an interchange with the Bueter Road alignment of the original 1953 US 30 \\"Bypass\\" (later renamed Coliseum Boulevard). From that tight cloverleaf interchange to the east, US 24 & SR 14 were concurrent with US 30 (now SR 930) and they then bridged over the Nickel Plate Railroad (now Norfolk Southern) mainline before merging onto New Haven Avenue, heading due east toward that suburb. Then US 24 and SR 14 headed into downtown New Haven, with US 30 splitting off to the south to bypass central New Haven. Just beyond that split, US 24 turned north onto Broadway Street, with SR 14 continuing due east along Dawkins Road to Ohio. On Broadway, US 24 crossed the Nickel Plate railroad mainline at-grade, and then curved slightly north-northwest through downtown New Haven before turning east onto Rose Avenue which led out of town (and past the point which later would become the I-469 interchange) as the old alignment which was later replaced by the modern freeway. In the early 1980s, US 24 was rerouted out of downtown Fort Wayne, following I-69 north to US 30/Coliseum Boulevard (now SR 930), and then following Coliseum Boulevard around the northern and eastern sides of the city to the cloverleaf at Washington Boulevard. When the southeastern portions of I-469 opened to traffic in 1989, US 24 was rerouted again, this time onto I-69 south, then I-469 at I-69's (then Exit 96, now 296) to the current interchange with US 24 east of New Haven. This resulted in a \\"doubling back\\" to the south-southwest from the Jefferson Boulevard interchange (then 101, now 301) along I-69 to reach I-469's south junction with I-69. Many savvy through travelers on US 24 simply left that route in Huntington County and turned east onto County Road 900 North at Roanoke, which becomes Lafayette Center Road at the Allen County line), and which about after leaving US 24 deposited them directly onto eastbound I-469 and (at the time) US 24 at the I-69 interchange. Though this deviation was along a two-lane road it saved them several miles of unnecessary out-of-the-way travel along the officially shielded route. After the original two-lane alignment east of New Haven along the Maumee River was bypassed by the present four-lane freeway in 2012, US 24 was again officially rerouted to its present posted alignment, using the northern loop of I-469, via I-69 north. However, many through travelers still use the Co Rd 900 S/Lafayette Center Road (both now widened and improved) to I-469 east and north route as it remains far shorter and more direct than the officially designated US 24 northern bypass of the Summit City and its eastern suburb. = Fort to Port =  2008‚Äì12 upgrades  (December 2008) Completed section of US 24 Fort-to-Port Freeway in eastern Indiana. This segment opened to traffic on October 29, 2009. In November 2007, Indiana announced they would reduce costs by changing their segment to be an expressway with at-grade intersections at Bruick Road, Webster Road, and SR 101, instead of a freeway section with interchanges and overpasses. The only overpasses would be two narrow () overpasses for non-motorized traffic (Amish buggies) to cross US 24\\\\. Also, the interchange of I-469 and US 24 would remain as is with traffic signals at the US 24 ramp terminals. The cost savings without interchanges would be approximately $75‚Äì$80 million. Right of way would be purchased for future interchanges. This change has been unpopular due to safety concerns with the heavy truck traffic on the corridor. INDOT claims that the current traffic on US 24 does not justify interchanges, even though the 2005 Final EIS states that it does. Responding to widespread public outcry over the scaled-back design, Governor Mitch Daniels announced on December 12, 2007, that US 24 would have been built as a freeway initially from Bruick Road to the Ohio state line, with interchanges at SR 101 and Webster Road. The intersection with Bruick Road was to have initially been an at-grade crossing, but INDOT announced in August 2009 that a grade-separated interchange was to be built here as well. Indiana's entire segment of US 24 was completed as a freeway. The interchange with I-469, however, was unchanged and remained at-grade. Upon completion, ownership of the existing US 24 was be transferred to Allen County, and become a frontage road east of Bruick Road, providing access to the B.F. Goodrich tire plant and adjacent homes and farmland. Indiana is financing construction through the Major Moves program, and will be reimbursed when federal highway funds become available. Sections of the two-lane road that have been bypassed by the freeway are now locally signed as \\"Old US 24.\\" Part of the new US 24 \\"Fort to Port\\" freeway in Eastern Indiana in 2018 Governor Daniels and INDOT held the groundbreaking ceremony for the Indiana section on April 30, 2008. By December 2008, crews had completed construction on of the freeway from the Ohio state line to just east of the SR 101 interchange. On October 29, 2009, Governor Daniels and Ohio Governor Ted Strickland held a ribbon-cutting ceremony at the Indiana‚ÄìOhio state line opening the new US 24 highway from SR 101 near Woodburn, Indiana to Ohio State Route 424 near Defiance, Ohio. The project was designated completed and the final segment opened on November 4, 2012.  Interchange with I-469  In the original plans, INDOT intended to upgrade the I-469/US 24 interchange to allow free-flowing movements between the two highways as documented in the Fort-to-Port Final Environmental Impact Statement published in 2005. This included building a flyover ramp from eastbound US 24 to southbound I-469. Five years later, no work had been performed on this interchange. In May 2017, it was announced that a modification to the original plan was in process. The long proposed flyover was being replaced with two significantly shorter bridges. Furthermore, the interchange was going to be upgraded in two phases. The initial phase will eliminate the traffic signal and would entail everything but the modified flyover, in particular both northbound I-469 to westbound US 24 and eastbound US 24 to northbound I-469 would be converted to free-flowing movements. This first phase should be completed in 2019. The remaining free-flowing connection is slated to be completed in late 2020.

North of downtown Huntingburg, the road passes through commercial properties, before leaving town. The highway then heads north towards Jasper, passing by a mix of both farmland and woodland. US 231 enters Jasper from the south, passing by commercial lots. West of downtown Jasper, the route begins a concurrency with SR 56, with both routes heading east. The concurrency enters downtown and has a traffic light at the northern terminus of SR 164\\\\. That is intersection US 231 and SR 56 turn towards the north. The two highways head north into residential areas. The road leaves Jasper heading northeastward toward Loogootee. In Haysville, the concurrency with SR 56 ends. US 231 heads north-northeast from SR 54, before turning more northward. The highway enters Loogootee and begins a concurrency with both U.S. Route 50 (US 50) and US 150\\\\. The concurrency travels due north, then turns northeast and enters downtown Loogootee. In downtown, the concurrency ends, with US 50 and US 150 heading east and US 231 heading northwest. The highway then heads north towards Bloomfield, passing the Naval Surface Warfare Center Crane Division. The route enters Bloomfield from the south, beginning a concurrency with SR 54 in downtown. This intersection is also the southern terminus of SR 157\\\\. US 231 and SR 54 head due west after about , after which SR 54 keeps heading due west and US 231 turns due north. This intersection is the northern terminus of SR 57\\\\. US 231 then heads north for about until SR 67\\\\. The two routes head northeast heading towards Spencer, along the banks of the White River. The highway turns towards the north away from the river and the concurrency ends. SR 67 heads northeast again and US 231 heads northwest. The road then travels towards Cloverdale, passing through an intersection with SR 42\\\\. The route enters Cloverdale passing by a mix of commercial and residential properties. On the north side of Cloverdale, the highway becomes a four-lane divided highway, with an interchange at I‚Äì70. =Northern Indiana= North of I‚Äì70, US 231 narrows to a two-lane highway, heading towards the northwest. The route has a traffic light at US 40, south of Greencastle. The highway enters Greencastle from the southeast and begins to turn north, passing DePauw University to the west. In downtown Greencastle, the highway has a traffic light with the western terminus of SR 240\\\\. US 231 leaves Greencastle heading further north for Crawfordsville, passing through a traffic light at US 36, a brief concurrency with SR 236, and an intersection with SR 234. On the south side of Crawfordsville, the route becomes a four- lane undivided highway, passing through commercial development. The road then heads toward downtown Crawfordsville, and begins a concurrency with both SR 32 and SR 47\\\\. The concurrency passes Wabash College and has an intersection with US 136\\\\. At this intersection, the concurrency with SR 32 and SR 47 turns east onto US 136\\\\. US 231 becomes a four-lane divided highway north of US 136, heading through the north side of Crawfordsville. Through the north side of Crawfordsville, the road passes through mainly residential land, with a few commercial properties near the interchange with I‚Äì74. North of I‚Äì74, the road returns to a two‚Äìlane rural highway and heads north for Lafayette. On the way to Lafayette, the route passes through rural farmland, paralleling a CSX rail line. The road enters Lafayette and becomes a four-lane divided highway as it runs through a mix of farmland and residential areas. The highway has a traffic light at SR 25\\\\. , the route crosses the Wabash River and heads for West Lafayette, where it runs along the south and west edges of the Purdue campus. US 231, which has been joined by US 52 by this point, continues north for a few miles, then turns westbound. US 231 then leaves the concurrency, while US 52 continues northwest and US 231 heads due north. North of US 52, the highway becomes a two-lane rural highway passing through farmland. US 231 has an interchange with I‚Äì65; this is the first of four interchanges with I‚Äì65. The route begins a concurrency with US 24 in Wolcott. The two highways head north through Wolcott and then turn due west. After Wolcott, the concurrency crosses into Jasper County and into the Central Time Zone. The two routes have an interchange at I‚Äì65 east of Remington. In Remington, the concurrency ends, with US 24 continuing due west and US 231 heading due north again. The road then enters Rensselaer, heads north and turns northeast, with a traffic light at SR 114\\\\. North of the traffic light, the road makes a sharp turn and heads northwest. North of Rensselaer, the route turns north once again, heading towards SR 10\\\\. At SR 10, US 231 turns due west, concurrent with the state road. After , the concurrency ends, with SR 10 traveling south and US 231 continuing north. The highway then enters Porter County on a bridge over the Kankakee River. North of the Kankakee River, the route begins a concurrency with SR 2 at a four-way stop south of Hebron. The concurrency enters Hebron from the south, passing mainly residential areas. The concurrency has an intersection with the western terminus of SR 8 at the main intersection in downtown. North of downtown, the concurrency with SR 2 ends with SR 2 heading due north and US 231 heading northwest. The road leaves Hebron, passing more residential properties and heading towards Crown Point. On the southeast side of Crown Point, the route has its last interchange with I‚Äì65. After I‚Äì65, the road has an intersection with SR 55\\\\. Passing through the southeast side of Crown Point, the road is lined with housing additions on both sides. The road then begins a concurrency with SR 55 and the two highways head for downtown Crown Point. In downtown Crown Point, the routes go around the county courthouse on one-way streets. The concurrency ends when the state road heads due north. US 231 then leaves Crown Point, heading towards its northern terminus on the south side of St. John. The route turns west for the last few miles to meet US 41\\\\. US 231 meets US 41 at an intersection controlled by a traffic light. History =Before US 231= Between 1918 and 1926, US 231 was signed SR 18 from Rockport to Old SR 4 and then followed Old SR 4 to Jasper. From Jasper to Bloomfield, the route consisted of unimproved county roads. From Bloomfield to Switz City, the future US 231 followed Old SR 30\\\\. North of Switz City, the road was SR 12, which eventually became SR 67\\\\. From Jasper to Lafayette, the road was numbered as SR 32\\\\. Where the future US 231 followed SR 29, the route became what is now US 52\\\\. From Wolcott to Remington, the route followed SR 7\\\\. North of Remington, the road was numbered SR 8 until reaching Hebron. From Hebron to the current terminus was an unimproved county road. This system was changed in 1926 when the U.S. Highways were created. The current number system in Indiana was put into place in 1926. The route that would become US 231 was signed as SR 45 from Rockport to SR 58 in Scotland. From Scotland to Bloomfield, it was an unimproved county road. From Bloomfield to Spencer, the future US 231 was given the same number that the route is concurrent with today. North of Spencer to Lafayette it was numbered SR 43\\\\. The route that US 231 follows today along US 52 was the same. The section of US 231 north of US 52 to US 41 was signed as US 152\\\\. The US 152 designation was used between February 1935 and 1938; in 1938 US 152 was decommissioned. The road then went back to state road numbers; this lasted until 1952 when US 231 was commissioned and signs installed. =As US 231= US 231 was first signed in Indiana in 1954; the whole length of US 231 was two-lanes. In Southern Indiana, the road has been widened from a two-lane surface road to a four-lane divided expressway. The expressway construction began in 2002 with a new bridge over the Ohio River; the state designated the old bridge near Owensboro, KY as SR 161\\\\. When the bridge was completed, traffic had to exit the expressway at the first exit on to SR 66\\\\. The expressway was built north towards Dale on all new terrain, with some of the old highway being signed as SR 161, SR 62, and the rest becoming county roads. US 231 was moved onto the expressway on March 15, 2011. In Northern Indiana, a new routing of US 231 around the south and west sides of the Lafayette/West Lafayette area opened September 13, 2013. Previously, US 231 entered downtown Lafayette from the south on 4th Street, passed over the Wabash River on the Harrison Bridge, then continued north and northwest in West Lafayette on Northwestern Avenue passing Purdue University, until merging with US 52\\\\. Future A project is planned that will put US 231 on a four- lane divided highway around Huntingburg and Jasper in the southern part of the state.http://www.jasperindiana.gov/egov/documents/1374853344_0575.pdf Major intersections See also  References External links Indiana 31-2 Transportation in Spencer County, Indiana Transportation in Dubois County, Indiana Transportation in Martin County, Indiana Transportation in Daviess County, Indiana Transportation in Greene County, Indiana Transportation in Owen County, Indiana Transportation in Putnam County, Indiana Transportation in Montgomery County, Indiana Transportation in Tippecanoe County, Indiana Transportation in White County, Indiana Transportation in Jasper County, Indiana Transportation in Porter County, Indiana Transportation in Lake County, Indiana ","title":"U.S. Route 231 in Indiana"},{"id":"21150598","text":"U.S. Route 41 (US 41) in the state of Kentucky is a north-south United States Numbered Highway that mainly goes through the western part of the state.

From 1930 into the early 1940s, the current alignment of US 41 was signed as US 41E, and the US 41W designation was on the current alignment of US 41 Alt. south of Hopkinsville. The western route became US 41 Alt. in 1943, while US 41E became the current alignment of US 41. In Hopkins County, US 41 previously followed the Pennyrile Parkway between exits 30 and 45 until the early 1990s, when it was rerouted onto the former US 41 Alt. alignment from Madisonville to just south of Nortonville. This was the one area of the Pennyrile Parkway where tolls were not charged when the parkway was originally a toll road. Near Henderson, US 41 was rerouted onto the few remaining miles of the Pennyrile Parkway up to its northern terminus in the 2010s before I-69 was designated onto most of the parkway to Nortonville.

Airing every morning from 6 to 10 a.m. Eastern Time, the program focuses on morning weather conditions, news and business information from around the country. The program debuted on January 3, 2000, under its original title. If there is a major weather event, it used to air until 10 am, however since 2017, it's usually cut back an hour for additional live broadcasts for Weather Center Live. Program history =As Your Weather Today= In 2000, The Weather Channel began a multi-year reformatting of its program schedule, converting from a one-program approach (embodied in Weather Center) to a multi-program schedule for its forecast programs. The first changes occurred with its morning schedule, formerly composed solely of Weather Center AM. Two programs were carved out of Weather Center AM initially, First Outlook and Your Weather Today, which debuted on January 3, 2000 (a third \\"morning\\" program, Day Planner, premiered in 2003). At its launch, Your Weather Today was anchored by Heather Tesch (who had made her TWC debut the year prior) and Marshall Seese. For Your Weather Today, the Local on the 8s concept ‚Äì in which local forecasts are shown six times an hour ‚Äì was revived. One of the segments featured on the program was \\"Travel Desk\\", focusing on air travel and highway travel conditions.Programs, The Weather Channel, archived at the Wayback Machine, December 18, 2001. In 2008, Your Weather Today underwent a graphical relaunch as part of TWC's conversion to high-definition broadcasts; between June 2 and August 12, all the Weather Channel's live weather programming began broadcasting in high definition from a new HD studio facility. Marshall Seese retired in November of that year,\\"Marshall Seese, 'Your Weather Today' Co- Host, Will Retire From The Weather Channel In November\\", Press Release, The Weather Channel, July 21, 2008, archived at the Wayback Machine, August 13, 2008. and was replaced by Nicole Mitchell. In March 2009, Tesch left Your Weather Today to become co-anchor of Day Planner and was replaced by Kevin Robinson. Also at this point, storm tracker Jim Cantore joined the show from Evening Edition, which was canceled around that time. Program logo used from April 5, 2010, to April 13, 2012. On June 22, 2009, Stephanie Abrams and Mike Bettes, both of whom previously hosted Beyond the Forecast, took over as co- anchors of Your Weather Today after the former program's cancellation. As Abrams serves as a fill-in for Al Roker on NBC's Today, which broadcasts from New York City, Jen Carfagno and Eric Fisher both frequently serve as substitutes for Abrams. Your Weather Today implemented a new graphics and music package on April 5, 2010. This revamp removed the \\"with Abrams & Bettes\\" subtitling on-air; however, interactive programming guides and program listings on weather.com continued to refer to the program as Your Weather Today with Abrams & Bettes. In 2010, Carfagno's appearances on the show increased significantly, because Bettes' was often absent doing field reports as part of the Vortex 2 experiment from May 1 to June 15, and Abrams was working on the second season of The Weather Channel's original long-form program WeatherProof. The move coincided with the cancellation of the controversial Flick and a Forecast movie series, which Carfagno had hosted. Chris Warren began serving as a fill-in when a second substitute was needed. From May 9 to June 3, 2011, Mike Bettes returned to field reporting on the Vortex 2 project for a third consecutive year (the channel's reports on the project had by that point become known as \\"The Great Tornado Hunt\\"). For 2012, Abrams remained in-studio on Your Weather Today during \\"The Great Tornado Hunt\\", which was truncated slightly because the channel's crew worked independently from the since-ended Vortex 2 project. Your Weather Today logo used from April 16 to November 9, 2012. On April 16, 2012, the program was revamped with new on-air graphics. In addition, Stephanie Abrams began co- hosting the show from New York City from 7‚Äì9 a.m. ET only. For the 9 a.m. hour, Mike Bettes was joined by either Eric Fisher, Jen Carfagno or Maria LaRosa from Atlanta. The network gave this format a three-month trial run, likely planning to move Abrams permanently to New York if it had been successful. On July 30, 2012, Abrams returned to the Atlanta studio, and she and Mike Bettes resumed hosting the show for all three hours. However, two weeks later on August 13, Stephanie Abrams moved to the New York City studio full-time. She and Mike Bettes continued to host the show from 7 to 9 a.m. while Maria LaRosa joined Bettes for the 9 a.m. hour. =Relaunch as Morning Rush= On November 12, 2012, Your Weather Today was relaunched, with the same hosts, under the new title Morning Rush. In late 2013, Jennifer Delgado joined the program. Abrams remained co-anchor of Morning Rush, with her duties expanding to 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. (from 7 a.m. to 8 a.m.), and Delgado co- anchoring the 9 a.m. Eastern hour. TWC got a new graphics and music package called \\"Weather All The Time\\" in November 2013, Morning Rush and every other live programming show got an upgrade. =Relaunch as AMHQ= The program was relaunched on March 17, 2014, as America's Morning Headquarters (AMHQ),Frazier Moore, \\"Sam Champion readies Weather Channel morning show\\", The Big Story, Associated Press, February 18, 2014. with Mike Bettes, Maria LaRosa and Sam Champion as co-anchors, Anaridis Rodriguez as news anchor, & Reese Waters on sports anchoring the program in the Atlanta studios, with Stephanie Abrams reporting live from New York City. The debut episode of AMHQ averaged 207,000 viewers during its three-hour time slot. On January 26, 2015, meteorologists Jim Cantore and Jennifer Delgado joined Sam Champion as co-hosts of the program. Mike Bettes and Maria LaRosa departed AMHQ on January 23. Bettes was named host of Weather Underground later that year while LaRosa was shifted to weekends. A weekend edition of AMHQ was also announced, with meteorologists Reynolds Wolf and Kait Parker hosting from 5:00 to 9:00 AM ET. The weekend edition launched on February 7, 2015. Chris Warren, Stephanie Abrams, Jen Carfagno & Ari Sarsalari are common fill-ins on AMHQ. On October 30, 2015, Sam Champion hosted his final AMHQ show. He moved back to New York City in January 2016 to host a primetime show from there. Jennifer Delgado departed a week later to Weather Center Live. On November 8, 2015, AMHQ relaunched again in a new timeslot, 5am-9am ET. The first hour is branded AMHQ Early hosted by Jen Carfagno & Anaridis Rodriguez with Stephanie Abrams & Jim Cantore joining them beginning at the second hour. On January 10, 2016, Kait Parker co-hosted her final AMHQ Weekend show and left TWC. She was replaced by Kelly Cass. On February 24, 2017, Anaridis Rodriguez announced she was leaving AMHQ. She was not replaced after her departure. Jen Carfagno has anchored AMHQ Early solo since February 27, 2017. On June 9, 2018, AMHQ Weekend was reduced to three hours, starting at 6am and ending at 9am ET. In March 2020, AMHQ Early was temporarily canceled due to the outbreak of COVID-19.

Price- based selling clearly exists in businesses such as: commodity sales, auto sales, hospitality, and even some retail stores. However, it is only recommended that commodity items like petroleum be sold exclusively by price. Selling on price is even more apparent now in the current US economy as most businesses make the switch to the lowest price approach in attempt to attract more consumers. Car insurance companies like Progressive Auto Insurance advertise specifically with their price, as they promote the amount of money that can be saved by making the switch. Price-based selling may result in a good or service becoming a commodity and a commodity by definition is a product or service that has no differentiating qualities or characteristics from competing products or services in its class.Di Frances, John. \\"Relationship Selling Sales Speaker.\\" Motivational Speaker ‚Äì Professional Keynote Speaker - Motivational Public Business Speakers Bureaus. 14 Mar.

Thus it can be seen that while pricing is not the only factor that matters, it is probably the most important. Relationship to sales Most businesses sell their items, whether they are expensive automobiles, or inexpensive services based upon price. They do this not because it is the most profitable, but because they believe it is the easiest way to attract customers.Di Frances, John. \\"Relationship Selling Sales Speaker.\\" Motivational Speaker ‚Äì Professional Keynote Speaker - Motivational Public Business Speakers Bureaus. 14 Mar. Consumers and Business-to-Business buyers alike may be easily enticed to buy based upon price. Consumers are always hunting for the best bargain and price has a direct impact on whether or not they will buy a product or service. Businesses know that offering the lowest price gives them a competitive advantage against other similar products the customer may be looking at. Big chains like Wal-Mart and Target have the most control over the pricing in their industry. However, to be able to sell at the lowest price, these chains are continually pushing, if not demanding, that their suppliers give them the lower prices as well.Weybright, Bob. \\"Sell Value- Not Price.\\" Smart Marketing. Aug. 2004. =Sales Goal= The goal of price based selling is to capture the business of price sensitive sellers.\\"The Future of Pricing as Bill Gates Sees It.\\" Pricing Advisory Newsletter. June 1999. 1 May 2009 <>. Customers who shop purely based on product cost will have the most interest in bargain buys. Pricing is directly related to the revenue management department of a business, and any good revenue manager will make sure they are doing everything possible to maximize profits. Various Methods =Price-matching guarantees= Price-matching guarantees are commonly used in consumer and industrial markets.Chen, Yuxin, Chakravarthi Narasimhan, and John Zhang. \\"Consumer Heterogeneity and Competitive Price-Matching Guarantees.\\" Marketing Science 20 (2001): 300-14. Academic Search Complete. University of Arizona, Tucson. 15 Apr. 2009 . Lowe's Home Improvement Warehouse is a great example, as they frequently state that they are the ‚Äòlowest‚Äô price store, and they will match the competitors. Best Buy has always been known for their price-matching guarantee as well. While a store with price matching guarantees has no fear of losing customers to rivals‚Äô price cuts, it has every incentive to raise its own price to charge a higher price to its loyal customers. It is an anti- competitive tactic that warns competitors not to attempt to steal market share by undercutting prices. Price-match guarantees are also criticized as being misleading to consumers.Tuttle, Brad. \\"Bait and Switch: Beware Low-Price Guarantee.\\" Time. 4 May 2013 . The guarantees typically require shoppers to provide proof of a lower advertised price on an identical item in stock at a nearby competitor‚Äôs store before a price match will be approved. However, many big-box retailers work directly with manufacturers and sell products with unique model numbers. As a result, the retailer can deny a price-match request, as no other store carries an \\"identical\\" item. Other common reasons for denial: the competitor is not \\"local,\\" the ad lists a percent discount rather than a specific price, or the customer doesn't offer acceptable proof of the competitor's price.DeNicola, Louis. \\"Price-Match Guarantees. The Fine Print.\\" Cheapism. 27 October 2013 <>. Even if all criteria are met, retailers grant price-matching requests on a case-by-case basis at the discretion of store employees. =Price slashing= Price cutting, or undercutting, is a sales technique that reduces the retail prices to a level low enough to eliminate competition.\\"Price-cutting.\\" Dictionary, Encyclopedia and Thesaurus - The Free Dictionary. 3 Apr. 2009 . Businesses will implement this as a way to under-cut the competition and offer the best price to the consumer. =Discounting= Discounting is something seen in almost every retail store, and grocery store. Discounting is present in just about every business in some way, whether it be coupons, advanced purchases, or bulk buying, businesses are quick to offer a pricing discount. Coupons and promotions give an economic incentive for the customer to use when purchasing a brand.Raghubir, Priya. \\"Coupons in context: discounting prices or decreasing profits?\\" Journal of Retailing (2004): 1-12. 2004. 3 May 2009 <>. The effect on consumer redemption of coupons has mostly been positive as it attracts customers, and gives them interest in a particular brand.Raghubir, Priya. \\"Coupons in context: discounting prices or decreasing profits?\\" Journal of Retailing (2004): 1-12. 2004. 3 May 2009 <>. On the other hand, discounting can really hurt a business as seen with Nordstrom this past holiday season. The clothing retailer reported that their fourth quarter earnings fell 68%, in large part due to the heavy discounting.\\"Discounting helps drive Nordstrom earnings down 68 percent.\\" OregonLive. 23 Feb. 2009. 4 May 2009 . According to a Cornell University study, in the hotel business, discounting in attempt to gain more occupancy does more harm than good, lowering the RevPAR and creating less profit.Salerno, Neil. \\"Are You Still Discounting? You Might Gain Some Occupancy, But Lose RevPar to Your Competition.\\" Hotel Online Where the Hospitality Industry Meets. Dec. 2004. 2 Feb. 2009 . =Haggling= Haggling, otherwise known as bargaining, is most present in businesses where items have no fixed price. Sellers will often price the item higher than they want to sell it, knowing that buyers are going to want to negotiate the price. Houses, cars, and services are the most common products sold using this model. Maintaining product integrity If the customers do not find value and integrity in the products they are buying they will be quick to leave for the next lowest price. Selling on pure price turns the product into a commodity. Commoditization does more harm than good for the brand or company selling. A commodity is something for which there is demand, but which is supplied without qualitative differentiation across a market. It is a product that is the same no matter who produces it, such as petroleum, notebook paper, or milk. In other words, copper is copper. Rice is rice. These kinds of items have a set price no matter where you buy. Commodities are and should be sold predominantly upon their price. =Products sold primarily based on price= There are a select group of products that should be sold based primarily upon their price and this includes all: consumables that have very little direct impact upon the consumer.Di Frances, John. \\"Relationship Selling Sales Speaker.\\" Motivational Speaker ‚Äì Professional Keynote Speaker - Motivational Public Business Speakers Bureaus. 14 Mar. Examples include items like: sand, gravel, and aggregate used in construction.Di Frances, John. \\"Relationship Selling Sales Speaker.\\" Motivational Speaker ‚Äì Professional Keynote Speaker - Motivational Public Business Speakers Bureaus. 14 Mar. With the advent of the Internet, price, service and support are often the only contact points with the customer. Identical products shipped across state lines with no tax have no other differentiators. Refusal to provide an upfront price is very hostile to Internet customers who will purchase a good or service elsewhere. Drawback to Price Based Selling When a business specifically cuts prices in order to make a sale, the customer can sense that the original price must be inflated if the business is so quick to slash the price. As a result, the customer may lose respect for the business and realize the prices are too high to begin with. Good customer service must show value to the customers. By cutting the price on one service, the client will most likely think you are willing to cut the price on other products and services. In some cases they may even demand that you do in order to keep their business.Henderson, Brock. \\"Selling In Tough Times.\\" ISP-Planet. 6 Nov. 2008. 4 May 2009 . Other recommended selling techniques Most marketing gurus will lean towards the \\"sell value, not price\\" approach when it comes to marketing. This is called value based selling; the business is helping the customer understand what they are purchasing with their dollar, instead of just the obvious product, the sales associate is selling everything the product can do for the customer.IHenderson, Brock. \\"Selling In Tough Times.\\" ISP-Planet. 6 Nov. 2008. 4 May 2009 . Price based selling is arguably a very common approach for businesses, however it should be combined with other approaches, like value selling in order to close the sales cycle.

Manor's history and traditions extend back two hundred years, over several sites in the city. Manor is part of the multi-academy trust Hope Learning Trust, York.Hope Learning Trust, York  History  = Establishment and King's Manor, 1812‚Äì1922 = Kings Manor Lawn, York Manor School originated as a project by the newly formed York Diocesan Board of the National Society for the Education of the Poor, whose remit was to establish schools in each parish for the educating of the 'labouring classes', to 'render them useful and respected members of society.' The first building was secured with the Merchant Taylor's Company to rent their hall on Aldwark, and on 21 May 200 boys began their first day at the newly formed school. By 21 October, an agreement had been reached for the school to use the 'Great Room' in the historic King's Manor, as part of a plan to open a separate girls' school in Aldwark. By 1815 303 boys, 175 girls and six trainee teachers were attending the two school sites. = Marygate, 1922‚Äì1942 = After 110 years in the King's Manor, the accommodation was condemned, and the school moved to the former premises of York Industrial School on Marygate, with the aid of a ¬£3,800 grant from the National Society. By 1932 the school enrolled 400 senior boys. In the early hours of 29 April 1942, a Luftwaffe bombing raid on York resulted in a direct hit on the Manor School building, the headmaster arriving at 5am to find the building 'in ruins'. = Priory Street, 1942‚Äì1965 = Within a fortnight, the school was re-established in 'five good rooms, one not so good, two small cloakrooms and a share of the laboratory and gymnasium ‚Äì very cramped quarters.' The rooms were assigned to teach French, English, maths, art, and history to the 240 pupils attending. = Low Poppleton Lane, 1965‚Äì2009 = Work started in April 1964 on a new building, the first purpose- built for the school. Overseen by Ron Dean, a young architect on his first job at Ward, Ruddick and Ward, the construction was completed in just under two years, at a cost of ¬£133,101. This was the first site for the school to have playing fields, and lessons commenced on 1 November 1965. The buildings were extended some time later, to include a new wing as the enrolment increased to around 650 pupils. In 1985 the school became a comprehensive. = Millfield Lane, 2009‚Äì = In April 2009, Manor School moved to a new, highly improved site on Millfield Lane, York. The ¬£17.6 million development now houses over three hundred more pupils than the old building, and includes facilities such as recording studios, industrial kitchens, and a central chapel for pupils. A new building, the HIVE, has been built to host Creative and Media collaborative provision for the city of York. This includes a theatre with gang plank, ticket desk and refreshments counter. In 2010 applications were advanced for Manor to receive 'academy' status, one of only two schools in the city (and 153 nationwide) that applied for this increased independence. This has led to a call in the House of Commons from York Outer MP Julian Sturdy for greater budget clarity for academies. =Headteachers= Headmaster Peter Smith (left) with Archbishop John Habgood, at the official opening of Manor as a comprehensive school, 1985 * 1812‚Äì41 - Samuel Danby * 1841‚Äì47 - Frederick Lyne * 1847‚Äì49 - William Pearson * 1849‚Äì53 - Thomas Haughton * 1853‚Äì64 - John Bird * 1864‚Äì65 - Henry Ripley * 1866‚Äì1910 - George Kenyon Hitchcock * 1910‚Äì22 - George King Hitchcock * 1922‚Äì32 - Maurice Gilbert Teesdale * 1932‚Äì35 - G F Jackson * 1935‚Äì43 - D H Cooper * 1943‚Äì53 - Herbert Wroe * 1953‚Äì68 - Norman Fieldsend * 1968‚Äì74 - George Ranson * 1975‚Äì81 - Marion Hodgson * 1981‚Äì2001 - Peter Smith * 2002‚Äì16 - Brian Crosby * 2016‚Äìpresent - Simon Barber  Today  =Music= Manor's music performances include those of its jazz band 'Manjazz' touring Europe, winning competitions (including at a performance at the Royal Festival Hall) and fundraising in York city centre.

The performing arts building contains a 400-seat capacity hall with sound and lighting, and a 70-seat drama studio with space for drama lessons and TV recording. The HIVE is a purpose-built creative and media centre seating 209. =Religion= As a school affiliated with the Church of England, faith and worship is often given as a reason pupils and staff choose to come to Manor. The current building has a designated space for worship and prayer, and features a cross on the building exterior, and plaques with the Lord's Prayer in each classroom. In addition, the Academy has a chaplain who attends one and a half days a week. Manor pupils attend a regular Eucharist service, for which they may travel to the nearby Holy Redeemer Church, on Boroughbridge Road. The Academy website states that it does not present Church doctrine as propaganda: \\"It's not our purpose to take people in Year 7 and turn them into Christians by Year 11... Instead, we hope to encourage and explore ways which will enable young people to make a decision about faith.\\" The Church appoints the majority of school governors. =Performance and applications= In 2012 Manor School pupils achieved 97% 5 or more A*-C grades (first in the city) and 66% including English and Maths (the government's headline measure), ranking it third in the city. The school has been regularly oversubscribed and has a selection criteria for acceptance into the school that includes the faith and church attendance of the family, siblings already attending, and proximity to the school. In 2009-10 Manor was the second most over-subscribed school in the country, having to turn down many applicants for available spaces. Currently there are 180 places available for new entrants into Year 7 each year, 99 of which are allocated according to the child's stated religion. Manor offers GCSEs in PE, Food, Textiles, Product Design, Art, French/German, Geography, History, Music, Dance, Drama, IT, Computing and Triple Science on top of compulsory English, Maths, Religious Studies and at least Double Science. There is also an option to go to the Vale of York to do photography, psychology or business studies. Other courses at GCSE level with alternative qualifications are Child Development, Catering and Hospitality, Leadership, and Performing Arts. One lesson a week is set aside for 'Enrichment'; these lessons vary from singing and cooking in the lower years to careers/life skills in higher years.

Thomas Aynscombe (died October 1740) of Charterhouse yard, and Northall in Buckinghamshire, was the son of Henry Aynscombe (died 1697), of St. Mary Woolnoth (where he was buried, in the chancel), citizen and haberdasher of London, by his wife Elizabeth (died 1711), daughter of Thomas Chew, Dunstable haberdasher, who had married Elizabeth, daughter of William Marsh of Dunstable in 1639. His mother, Elizabeth Chew (aka Mrs. Henry Aynscombe), was one of the three sisters and coheirs of William Chew (another brother Thomas Chew, of Dunstable, (died 20 July 1698, aged 52 (Neve)), distiller, of Dunstable, who died unmarried and intestate 18 March 1712/13, aged 58, leaving an estate worth ¬£28,000, this included property in St. John Street, Smithfield, and several coaching inns in Dunstable, the Windmill and Still (theirs since the 17th century [V.C.H.]), and the Sugar Loaf (acquired by 1713), one of the most famous coaching inns of the 18th century. It also included 14 farms in Dunstable, Luton, Kensworth, Caddington, Gravenhurst and Edlesborough, the manors (in Bedfordshire) of Fitzhugh, Edlesborough, Bowells and Northall (Buckinghamshire), the two inns (and the Maypole and Black Lion) and several other cottages and pieces of land in Dunstable, a house in London, and houses in the parish of St Sepulchre- without-Newgate, leased to London tradesmen. William Chew had been sheriff of Bedfordshire in 1709 and in 1703 had obtained a grant of arms with a device of Catherine wheels and griffins' heads, this was later to be the badge of the Foundation scholars. He was buried, like his nephew Thomas Chew Cart (died 1722) and sisters Frances Ashton (died 1727), Jane Cart (died 1736) and Elizabeth Aynscombe (died 1711) (all have monumental inscriptions), in Dunstable Priory. He is in the north aisle where Thomas Green of Camberwell did his monument. Chew's House, from Charles Lambourn's Dunstaplelogia, 1859 William Chew's estate was inherited by his sisters Frances (died 1727), who had married William Ashton, a London distiller, and Jane (died 1736) who had married James Cart (died 1706), citizen and distiller of London, and their nephew, Thomas Aynscombe in lieu of his mother, Elizabeth, who had died in 1711. These last three then created Chew's Foundation in Dunstable, which opened in September 1724. The school house still stands and records their names on its front. Wife and father-in-law Aynscombe's first wife Jane, whom he married in 1706 in Norwich, was daughter of (major) Philip Stebbing (c. 1641 ‚Äì 1705), grocer and Freeman of Norwich, and Deputy Lieutenant (D.L.) for the City and County of Norwich from 1701. He was apprenticed to the successful grocer and sometime MP for Norwich, Augustin Briggs, Esq. (senior), (c. 1618 ‚Äì 1684), 3 August 1674.

As sheriffs he and Lawrence Goodwin had 'established a well-deserved reputation as merciless persecutors of non-conformists with a special animus for Quakers' (Evans p. 297). In February 1696 he was forced publicly to deny that on reading a 'printed paper' about the Jacobite plot to assassinate King William III he had gone to the Half Moon Coffee-house and declared that: 'the plott is mine Arse all over', (Norfolk Record Office, Mayor's Court books, vol. 26 f.10, via Mark Knights, 2005, page 158). He is buried in St Peter Mancroft, by the side of his wife, Anne Andrews (died 1702), and three children. One son was Georgius Stebbing, grocer, freeman, Norwich 24 March 1704, while another Philip Stebbing of Norwich, then of Sprowston, with property in Wymondham, died 1715 (also buried in St. Peter Mancroft) making his brother-in-law Thomas Aynscombe his heir; leaving him his messuages, lands, tenements, premises and hereditaments there (will dated 21 April 1715).

His writing on the suffering of ordinary people was partly inspired by his own experiences, alternately working as a stevedore, barber and journalist; his autobiographical short story, \\"On the Sacks\\", was published in 1976. Several of his works are set during the period of the French Mandate of Syria, or in the period immediately following independence. Mina has authored about 40 novels, varying in imaginary value and narrative significance. But his achievement lies in the foundation he laid for this literary structure. For his collective works and novels, Mina was awarded the Arab Writer's Prize in 2005. Early life Born to a Christian Arab family in Latakia in 1924, Hanna Mina spent his childhood in one of the villages near Iskenderun, but following the entrance of the Turkish forces to the district (Hatay State), he moved back to Latakia with his family. Although with only an elementary school certificate, Mina used to write letters and petitions to the government on behalf of illiterates, and distributed the Communist Sawt al- Shaab (Voice of the People) newspaper alongside working as a barber. Writing In 1947, he moved to Beirut in search for a job, later moving to Damascus where he began his literary career. In the 1950s, Mina joined the Damascus newspaper al-Inshaa as a trainee editor. He was paid a monthly salary of a mere 100 Syrian pounds and lived in relative poverty. He wrote several short stories, which brought him into literary circles, and he co-founded the Syrian Writers Federation in 1951 and later moved to become the editor in- chief of al-Inshaa. His first novel was 1954's The Blue Lanterns. Although slowly gaining fame and prestige and becoming of Syria's renowned writers, he never stopped reflecting on the harsh reality of his earlier life, which he considered as fuel for his novels. He has said that \\"reality carves its inscriptions on human skin with a hot iron that leaves permanent marks and scars\\". His novel, The Swamp, which invoked fragments of Mina's childhood in Iskenderun, was described by literary critic Salah Fadl as ‚Äúthe greatest autobiography in Arab novel-writing, and the most abundant in brutal honesty and wealth of thought.\\" Death Mina died on 21 August 2018 in Damascus, aged 94.

Formed in the 1880s, it was a separate entity from the other Dublin tramways, notably the Dublin United Tramways Company (DUTC), but worked closely with the latter, who owned the line as far as Dollymount, for most of its operating existence. History =Early stages= Tram service for the Howth area was first proposed in 1883, by the Great Northern Railway (Ireland) (GNR), to bring more passengers to Howth and / or Sutton railway stations. The Clontarf and Hill of Howth Tramroad Company (C&HofHTCo;) raised the idea of a circular line around Howth Hill. Neither idea progressed, not least because the slopes of the hill were too steep to be safe for horses, or practical for steam power, though a line may have been considered using a viaduct over Balscadden Bay, just beyond Howth village, to keep gradients within the range of steam propulsion. In 1890, the C&HofHTCo; sought an Order in Council to allow it to build a tram line from Howth Harbour to Dublin's fish market. The formal application was made on 31 January 1890, for a gauge of 3 feet, with lines running from Mary's Lane past Halston Street to Capel Street, and then along Parnell Street and Summerhill, through Ballybough, Fairview, Killester and Raheny, then along the coast through the fields of Kilbarrack to Sutton and Howth. While this matter did not proceed, the company developed two new proposals after the DUTC received permission to electrify its lines. The proposed lines, at a gauge of 5 feet 3 inches, were from the DUTC's terminus in the Clontarf area, via the hamlet of Raheny-on-the-Strand and Sutton, to Howth Harbour, and from the Summit on Howth Hill down past Howth Station and the Howth Estate to the gates of Claremont. The GNR made a two-part counter proposal, seeking to electrify their railway line from Amiens Street Station to either Sutton or Howth, and to provide a circular tram line, with connections at Sutton Cross and Howth, and with the trams able to move all the way to Dublin's centre. The C&HofHTCo; added a third element to their proposal, for a tram line from Sutton Cross to the Summit, and the GNR then objected to the whole package, and won. The GNR then received permission for its proposed circular line, which became the Hill of Howth Tramway, and dropped the idea of electrification from the peninsula to Amiens St., and so of trams through-running around Howth and to the city centre. =Service establishment= Having considered both a coastal route to Howth, probably working with the DUTC, and an inland one, via Raheny, the Clontarf and Hill of Howth Tramway Company eventually secured permission for a line from the DUTC's depot at what had become Dollymount in Clontarf to Howth Harbour, and this was enshrined in a Private Local Act of 1898, The Clontarf and Hill of Howth Tramroad Bill, 61 & 62 Victoria I, cap. clxxxii. This Act had its Second Reading on 3 March, and on 18 July was the subject of debate about the possible insertion of a clause requiring the purchase of rolling stock from England, the promoters having expressed a preference for buying from the DUTC, or failing that, from the United States. The bill was returned to the House of Lords on 26 July, and later completed its passage.London: Hansard, vol. 62, c. 1291 - 26 July 1898, House of Lords Sitting, Private Bill Business, \\"Returned from the Commons agreed to, with Amendments, 'Clontarf and Hill of Howth Tramroad Bill'\\" Leading businessman, and key player in the DUTC, William Martin Murphy, was an active member of the Board of the C&HofHTCo; up to this time. He secured the contract to lay the new line, and having resigned from the board, proceeded with laying and equipping, which eventually cost ¬£71,624. Much of the line construction was straightforward, allowing for the challenges of building at the water's edge, but there were difficulties with Lord Ardilaun, the Guinness heir, whose estate of St. Anne's ran to the coast where the line was to be laid. At the time, there was no coastal road, and Lord Ardilaun sought multiple conditions in return for removing objections to the project. He received most of what he sought, including the provision that the trams would not stop along the margin of his property, and line construction proceeded. The line opened on 26 July 1900. =Operations= The company purchased twelve large cars (larger than those of the DUTC, for example) for its operations, each seating 74 passengers, 29 inside and 45 on the upper deck. The enclosed lower deck had a driver's cab, and separate areas for each of First, Second and Third Class. The journey from Nelson's Pillar to Howth took 45 minutes, and the price for much of the operating period was 2 shillings and 6 pence. In 1918, the route number 31 was allocated to the line (the numbers were assigned clockwise from the No. 1 route to Ringsend), a number now used by Dublin Bus services to Howth, albeit on the original inland route via Raheny, rather than the final route. =Decline and winding-up= During the 1930s, the line became unprofitable, and when the GNR put forward a proposal to run a competing bus service on the Howth Road, and launch a bus to Malahide, the Board of the C&HofHTCo; offered to end their service if the GNR agreed not to run a bus to Malahide. The line ceased operation on 29 March 1941, with the last tram to Howth, No. 294, departing Nelson's Pillar at 11.45 p.m, driven by Dick Ward. The company was wound-up on 1 July 1941, and the remaining tram cars were transferred to the DUTC's Dalkey route, where they served until that line closed in 1949.

The average length of Brasilodon is approximately 12 cm and weighed about 20 grams. The average size of this cynodont species is about the size of extant mice. Brasilodontids are most likely insectivores due to their teeth. The two species in this genus are B. tetragonus and B. quadrangularis, two very small cynodonts belonging to the family Brasilodontidae.  Description  Restoration of Brasilodon and Riograndia Brasilodon is a genus of small derived cynodont that exhibits many mammalian features including a secondary palate, symmetrical tooth development, and more developed sense of hearing than other cynodonts.Bonaparte, JOS√â F., et al. \\"New information on Brasilodon and Brasilitherium (Cynodontia, Probainognathia) from the late Triassic of southern Brazil.\\" Revista Brasileira de Paleontologia 8.1 (2005): 25-46. The study of Brasilodons shows that the expansion of advanced cynodonts with mammalian features occurred in several species that still retained many primitive features. = Skull = Skull size in Brasilidontids varies from individual to individual about 35-40%, and is about 20% larger than Brasilitherium, the other genus in the family Brasilodontidae. Brasilodon species lack a prefrontal bone, postorbital bone, and postorbital bar, which is seen in most other Probainognathians.Bonaparte, Jose F., et al. \\"The Sister Group of Mammals; Small Cynodonts from the Late Triassic of Southern Brazil.\\" Revista Brasileira De Paleontologia, vol. 5, 01 June 2003, pp. 5-27. Some derived features shown in Brasilodon include: reduced postdentary bones, nasal-frontal bone contact on the lateral sides, reduced canines close to the size of the last incisor, and the vascular features of their \\"stapedial recess\\". The well developed stapedial process, as well as the presence of several foramina in Brasilodon indicates that the middle ear of Brasilodontids was another feature showing that it is a more derived Probainognathian. The interpterygoid vacuity seen in Brasilodontids is considered to be possibly derived or a reversed character of the primary palate found in mammals, which extends from the choana to the interpterygoid vacuities. The presence of a secondary palate shows another derived feature found in Brasilodon, and the posterior end of the secondary osseous palate extends posteriorly to the last postcanine. = Dentition = Comparison of Brasilodon (L) and Brasilitherium (M) dentition, along with other Probainognathian dentition patterns. Brasilodon quadrangularis is characterized by quadrangular upper and lower postcanines, which are secured to the jaw by ossified periodontal ligament in the root. Each tooth row contains 6-8 upper postcanines and 8-9 lower postcanines;Martinelli, A. G.; Bonaparte, J. \\"Postcanine Replacement in Brasilodon and Brasilitherium (Cynodontia, Probainognathia) and Its Bearing in Cynodont Evolution.\\" Dinosaurios Y Paleontolog√≠a Desde Am√©rica Latina. By J. Calvo et al. Mendoza: EDIUNC, 2011. 179-186. there is little morphological variation to be seen in the upper tooth rows, while the lower tooth rows exhibit more variable morphology. The upper postcanines are considerably smaller than lower postcanines, a condition observed in many Probainognathians.Soares, M. B., A. G. Martinelli, and T. V. De Oliveira. \\"A New Prozostrodontian Cynodont (Therapsida) from the Late Triassic Riograndia Assemblage Zone (Santa Maria Supersequence) of Southern Brazil.\\" Anais Da Academia Brasileira De Ci√™ncias 86.4 (2014): 1673-691. Brasilodon can be differentiated from Brasilitherium by its more derived lower postcanines. This consists of a prominent central cusp, an anterior accessory cusp, and a posterior accessory cusp, resulting in a symmetrical distribution (this trait is more derived than any other Probainognathian). The postcanines seen in Brasilitherium, on the other hand, has morganucondontid-like plan in lower postcanines. Due to the size of the diastema between canines and postcanines in the largest Brasilodontids, this shows that anterior postcanines were most likely lost faster than it was in Thrinaxodon (an early cynodont). Although it is not known how many successional postcanine replacements there are in Brasilodon, there is more than one replacement (polyphyodonty), and it is done the same way as many cynodonts, in which postcanines are replaced in an alternate manner. Postcanine replacement in Brasilodon was slow enough to allow extremely strong wear to develop in the teeth. This replacement also slowed over the individual's lifespan and ceased long before the death of an individual. In some cases, the individual's tooth wore down over time to less than half the height of the crown still remaining. Brasilodontids postcanine replacement occurs the same way as many other advanced Probainognathians (posterior-anterior direction), and differs from most mammaliforms in the direction of tooth replacement. This is most likely due to their unlimited skull growth. Tooth replacement variation can perhaps also be attributed to cynodont diet. Herbivorous/omnivorous traversodontidsMartinelli, A. G., M. B. Soares, and C. Schwanke. \\"Two New Cynodonts (Therapsida) from the Middle-Early Late Triassic of Brazil and Comments on South American Probainognathians.\\" PLoS ONE 11.10 (2016): 1-43. species present widened postcanines and tooth replacement is sequential. Carnivores and Insectivores non-mammaliaform probainognathians like Brasilodon present alternating tooth replacement instead. Brasilodon can be seen as more derived than Morganucodon, a very close mammal relative, due to its upper and lower symmetrical dentition pattern.  Classification and species  The genus Brasilodon belongs to the family Brasilodontidae along with Brasilitherium, Minicynodon, Panchetocynodon, and Protheriodon. Because of the skull and dentition traits seen in Brasilodon, this genus appears to be more derived than any previously known cynodont, and therefore more closely related to mammals than either tritheledontids or tritylodontids (close relatives of mammaliaformes). Since Brasilodontidae exhibits more derived features and many strong differences than other cynodonts, it has been considered that this family is connected with the origin of mammals,Bonaparte, J. F. \\"Evolution of the Brasilodontidae (Cynodontia-Eucynodontia).\\" Historical Biology 25.5-6 (2013): 643-653. although it is younger than the oldest mammals.Liu, Jun, and Paul Olsen. \\"The Phylogenetic Relationships of Eucynodontia (Amniota: Synapsida).\\" Journal of Mammalian Evolution 17.3 (2010): 151-76. Despite presenting apomorphies in the skull and dentition, Brasilidontids' postcanines also share many synapomorphies with primitive mammaliaformes. This includes a tongue, a system in middle postcanines for mesiodistal interlocking between teeth, similar size and distribution of tooth cusps, a close pattern of wear facets in postcanines, and a root with an eight-shaped cross-section. This shows that mammalian tooth replacement evolved after many craniodental features in cynodont evolution. Using C.T. scans of Brasilodon quadrangularis and Didelphis, an extant mammal with primitive cranial morphology, the nasal cavity of Brasilodon and other cynodonts has been shown to be very close to mammalian forms. This indicates that some cynodonts had high respiratory rates and therefore endothermic metabolic status as seen in eucynodonts. Therefore, all of the adaptations needed for endothermy could already be present in Triassic cynodonts.Rodrigues, Pablo Gusm√£o Endotermia em cinodontes n√£o- mamalianos: a busca por evid√™ncias osteol√≥gicas. / Pablo Gusm√£o Rodrigues. - Porto Alegre : UFRGS, 2005.

Location and history Ogidi is situated on the southwestern tip of the old Northern Region. It is a three and a half hour drive from Abuja, Nigeria's capital. It has deep historical ties with the northern and western part of Nigeria. The people of this town endured raids from and eventually defeated the Nupe imperialists in late 19th century thus sealing their access to the western part of the country.Olayemi Akinwumi, The Okun Yoruba and the Nineteenth Century Crisis in Nigeria, University of Texas Administratively, it was under the Northern Region with Kaduna as the capital; then Kwara State with Ilorin as the capital and now Kogi State with Lokoja as the capital. It shares boundaries with Kabba in Kabba/Bunnu LGA, and three towns in Ijumu LGA: Ayere, Iyara (the headquarters of Ijumu LGA) and Ogale. Currently in Ijumu Local Government Area, It has just recently vacated the seat of the rotational Olujumu I - The traditional ruler His royal majesty Oba Rafiu Oladimeji Sule, the ologidi of Ogidi Kogi State. Language and people The language spoken in Ogidi is the Okun dialect of Yoruba. The men are traditionally farmers and hunters, and the women are renowned for arts, craft and trading. Agriculture The vegetation is a mix of forest and savannah. Coffee, cocoa, cassava, cashew, yam, maize, sweet potato, groundnut,palm kernel and kola are some of the popular produce from the town. Livestock‚Äìcattle, goats, sheep, poultry and their products‚Äìare also available in Ogidi. Religion and tradition Ogidians traditionally are stone worshippers; this may not be surprising, considering the abundance of igneous mountains and caves, and the reliance on them to ward off invaders. Ogidians defeated the Nupe imperialists who were Muslims; however, they accepted Islam later through peaceful means‚Äìtrade and interaction. Christianity came much later with British colonialism. The town is traditionally ruled by an Oba like other communities in Ijumu Local Government on a rotational basis between the two ruling houses of Itaji and Okelare. The current king, Alhaji Rabiu Oladimeji Sule is from the Okelare ruling house in accordance with the tradition of the forebears, which is duly recognized by the government of the country. In line with this it is known that the next king in line would be from Itaji ruling house. Notable residents Chief S. A. Ajayi a Nigerian Statesman and a minister of the first republic is from Ogidi. Ogidi is the home town of Nike Davies Okundaye, the renowned batik artist. Sunday Bada, Olympic gold madalist, is from the town.

Before the Federal League Chicago Lutheran Theological Seminary, seen around 1900, from Sheffield Avenue. The president's house on the right is located near the site of the present-day Wrigley Field scoreboard and center field bleachers. The building in the center, Eliza Hall, is in the present location of the left field bleachers. Off to the left in the background are campus houses for professors, now occupied by the grandstand along the left field line. Note the wooden frame houses across Waveland Avenue as seen between the president's house and Eliza Hall. At the turn of the 20th century, the block bounded by Clark, Addison, Waveland, and Sheffield streets was home to the Chicago Lutheran Theological Seminary, with the Hildebrandt Coal Factory across the street to the west. William Passavant, a prominent Lutheran missionary, had inherited the land decades before. Passavant began to develop the land as early as 1868, including the construction of St. Mark's Church by 1874. In 1891, Passavant helped establish the Chicago Lutheran Seminary on the site. A period postcard featuring a photo taken several years after the photo above, and from a position further north up Sheffield Avenue near its intersection with Waveland Avenue. Note that the far side of Waveland (far right) has been wholly redeveloped with new apartments. These buildings can still be seen across Waveland from Wrigley Field. At the time the seminary was established, the area was located in a quiet, relatively undeveloped section of the Lake View District of Chicago's North Side. The seminary started small, holding classes in a small chapel facing Addison Street. The following year, the president's house was constructed at the corner of Sheffield and Waveland. In 1893, the seminary spent $25,000 to construct the four-story Eliza Hall housing the library, chapel, lecture and student rooms further to the west along Waveland. By 1899, four homes were built for professors from the northwest corner of the block (at Waveland and Stella) stretching south along Stella. The seminary had ambitious plans for expansion. In 1905, it announced plans to build additional buildings on the southwest corner of the block housing dining halls, a gymnasium, and more lecture and student rooms, along with additional professors' homes on either side of Eliza Hall. The buildings were to be arranged around a central quadrangle. The seminary, however, was attempting to flourish in the context of a changing community. The extension of the elevated system into the area in 1900 led to rapid development of the surrounding neighborhood. As the area started taking on an increasingly urban character, the seminary abandoned its plans to develop the site and instead sought to sell its land and find a quieter location. Meanwhile, other developments were coming together to chart a very different future for this plot of land. As early as 1905, rumors had been swirling that minor-league American Association was seeking to locate a franchise in Chicago as part of a strategy to achieve major league status on par with the National League and the recently established American League. The Chicago market was one of the most lucrative in the country, and was already occupied by the NL's Cubs and the AL's White Sox. Charles Havenor (owner of the AA Milwaukee Brewers), and brothers Joe Cantillon (manager of the Washington Senators) and Mike Cantillon (owner of the AA Minneapolis Millers), saw an opportunity to make profit by snapping up choice property in the event that the AA decided to move into the Chicago market. Since the White Sox played on the South Side at South Side Park, and the Cubs were firmly ensconced on the West Side at West Side Park, Havenor and the Cantillons looked to the rapidly developing North Side as the best place to situate a team. The seminary's location represented the best open land on the North Side. In 1909, the seminary, eager to move, sold the property to Havenor and the Cantillons for $175,000 and relocated to the suburb of Maywood, Illinois, where it remained until 1967. Havenor and the Cantillons brought in additional investors in 1910, including E.T. Harmon and Edmund Archambault, wealthy Milwaukee businessmen. A close-up view of Eliza Hall (\\"Students Building\\") and the professors residences from the same series of postcards as seen from Waveland Avenue. The new owners had intended to keep the sale out of the news, but those plans were foiled when members of the seminary board complained that the seminary could have obtained $200,000 in the sale. Havenor was forced to publicly deny any intention on invading the Chicago market. Other AA team owners got cold feet at the prospect of a war with the major leagues, and elected a president that was unwilling to countenance such a scheme. Over the next couple years, Havenor gradually gave up hope of developing the property, selling out his interest to the remaining investors shortly before his death in April 1912. The former seminary site was not developed any further, and the former seminary buildings were converted into residential units. Weeghman Park and the Federal League (1913‚Äì1915) Construction of Weeghman Park, early April 1914. The Federal League began its existence as a minor league in 1913, locating franchises in six cities, including Chicago. The Chicago franchise, known as the Chi-Feds, played its home games at the baseball grounds at DePaul University. John T. Powers, founder and president of the new Federal League, had ambitions of building the new organization into a premier minor league, on par with the American Association. By the middle of the 1913 season, however, the owners had forced Powers out of his job, sensing that the Federal League had the potential to become a viable major league. Replacing him as president was James A. Gilmore, a wealthy Chicago businessman who had made his fortune in coal. Gilmore had the organizational and political skills necessary to mount a serious challenge to the established major leagues. Gilmore brought on board two partners to control the key Chicago franchise. One was William Walker, a fish wholesaler. The other was the flamboyant Charles A. Weeghman, known as \\"Lucky Charlie\\", who had made a quick fortune in local lunch counters (a predecessor to fast food). Weeghman became the club president and the main force behind the team from that point onward, with Walker willing to remain in the background, and Gilmore tending to League issues. Weeghman made headlines by landing star shortstop Joe Tinker from the Cincinnati Reds in December 1913. The Tinker acquisition was the shot in the arm that gave the franchise the momentum to think big for the upcoming 1914 season. A view of the Weeghman Park outfield taken in April 1914. Note the former seminary buildings beyond the fence, the original location of the scoreboard in left field, and the \\"jury box\\" bleachers in right-center field. Compare this image with the picture below taken from the same vantage point in 1915. Weeghman chose to relocate the franchise from DePaul to the former seminary grounds at Clark and Addison owned by Archambault and the Cantillons. Although the major leagues threw up a number of roadblocks, including an attempt to secure rights to part of the land on the block, in late December 1913 Weeghman secured a ninety-nine year lease on the property. The lease stipulated, among other things, that improvements on the property could not exceed $70,000. Within several months, however, Weeghman would spend several times that amount in erecting his new ballpark. Weeghman hired Zachary Taylor Davis, architect of Comiskey Park (which became the home of the White Sox in June 1910), to design the new ballpark. Weeghman wanted the park to rival the Polo Grounds in New York, but in the end the single-decked grandstand as designed bore little resemblance to it. Weeghman Park, May 1914. Note Eliza Hall beyond the left-field fence. During the park's first three games in April 1914, the original fence proved too inviting to batters, leading the team to move it back during the next road trip. Relocating the fence necessitated demolition of a porch on Eliza Hall - note the discoloration where the porch had been attached. That building was demolished altogether shortly before the 1915 season and replaced with bleachers. Work on the property didn't begin until February 23, 1914, exactly two months before the Chi-Feds' scheduled home opener. After the grounds had been cleared, groundbreaking ceremonies took place on March 4. Under the guidance of the Blome-Sinek company, the lead construction contractor, the park came together over the remainder of March and the first half of April. Despite a brief strike by construction workers in early April, the new park was ready for baseball by the date of the home opener on April 23, 1914. The new ballpark, known as Weeghman Park, was a modern steel and concrete baseball plant (in the industrial lexicon of the day). It featured a single-decked grandstand sweeping from right field behind home plate to near the left field corner. Perched on top of the grandstand roof behind home plate was a small area for the press. A modern-day visitor to the original Weeghman Park would have difficulty recognizing the outfield aside from the familiar buildings on the opposite side of Waveland and Sheffield Avenues (which haven't changed much at all). The dimensions of the original playing field along the foul lines were quite short. The distance from home plate to the right field brick fence along Sheffield Avenue was around 300 feet at the foul line. Left field was not much better, partly because several old seminary buildings stood between the wooden left field fence and Waveland Avenue. The left field fence also featured a large scoreboard. Like most of the parks of the day, the field was essentially angular, as it was shaped by the surrounding grid street pattern. The right and left field walls converged in a corner in deep center field, nearly 450 feet from home plate. Because of the constricted size of much of the outfield near the corners, bleachers were limited to a small jury box in right-center field. All told, Weeghman Park had a seating capacity of 14,000, but this was frequently exceeded by the many standing room only crowds of the day. New left field bleachers at Weeghman Park, 1915. Note the scoreboard has now been moved to center field. These bleachers occupied the former site of Eliza Hall. After an unusual number of home runs were hit during the Chi-Feds' first home series against Kansas City in April, Weeghman decided the left field wall was too cozy a target, and had the entire fence moved back some 25 feet. To do this, the front porch had to be removed from the old seminary building beyond the wall. Before the start of the 1915 season, Weeghman made additional changes to the outfield. Gone were the jury- box bleachers in right-center field. The old seminary buildings beyond left field were finally demolished in March. In their place, Weeghman had wooden bleachers erected from the left-field corner to center field, raising the park's capacity to roughly 18,000. The scoreboard was relocated to center field, where it has remained in one form or another since then (with the exception of the latter part of the 1937 season during construction of the current bleachers). On the field, the Chi-Feds were renamed the Chicago Whales for the club's sophomore season. Weeghman Park was fast becoming the best place to watch baseball in Chicago, as the Whales fought their way to the Federal League pennant in one of the closest races in major league history. Additionally, fans enjoyed Weeghman's high standards for cleanliness and promotion. He was an early champion of Ladies' Day (every Friday) and in 1916 would become the first baseball owner to allow fans to keep foul balls. And as a successful restaurateur, his food was top-notch. Long before the Wrigley family entered the scene, the park was already famous for its hospitality. Despite the exciting pennant race and generally high quality of baseball played in the Federal League, the League was hemorrhaging money. In December 1915, the League capitulated to the other major leagues and disbanded. But all was not lost for Weeghman, however. He was allowed to purchase the Cubs franchise for $500,000, and promptly moved his new club out of the dilapidated West Side Park and into his Weeghman Park for the 1916 season. The purchase was in reality a merger between the Whales and the Cubs, as a number of former Whales stars, such as Max Flack and Claude Hendrix, found themselves playing in the same park as Cubs the following season. Weeghman Park, home of the Federal League champion Chicago Whales, as seen from Sheffield Avenue, in 1915. With the park now occupying all the land right up to Waveland Avenue, its left field area is substantially larger than it was the previous year, as is apparent from the considerable distance between the end of the left-field grandstand and the left-field corner. For comparison, see the above picture taken from the same vantage point in 1914. Weeghman Park to Cubs Park to Wrigley Field (1916‚Äì1932) Cubs right fielder Max Flack in front of original short right field wall, c. 1920. Note the Doublemint \\"elves\\" atop the scoreboard, and the Wilson Sporting Goods sign on the right field wall. The Cubs played their first game at Weeghman Park on April 20, 1916, besting the Cincinnati Reds 7‚Äì6 in eleven innings. This proved to be the highlight of an otherwise unremarkable season. After another year in the bottom half of the standings, the Cubs won the National League pennant in 1918 under manager Fred Mitchell. The victory was not without a little outside help, as wartime conditions during the height of American involvement in World War I caused major league baseball to end the regular season on September 1. With the Cubs struggling for cash, Weeghman reluctantly rented the larger capacity Comiskey Park for the Cubs' home games in the World Series. For the Cubs, the experience was a bust, as the club lost the series to Babe Ruth and the Boston Red Sox in six games to relatively anemic attendance. Such losses may have provided the final push forcing Charlie Weeghman out of management following the season. Although Weeghman was clearly the most dominant figure in the revamped Cubs organization in 1916, a number of investors had taken up minority shares in the club. One of the new investors was chewing gum magnate William Wrigley. Over the next couple years, as Weeghman's financial fortunes off the field entered a sharp decline, Wrigley acquired an increasing number of shares in the club and took on a growing role in the team's affairs. In November 1918, Weeghman gave up his remaining interest to Wrigley, resigned as president, and left baseball for good. Wrigley would acquire complete control of the Cubs by 1921. With Weeghman out of the picture, starting in 1919 the park was generally referred to as Cubs Park. Although the Cubs featured stars such as pitchers Grover Alexander and Hippo Vaughn, along with a young catcher named Gabby Hartnett, over the next few seasons Cubs Park was the setting for largely also-ran teams. The fans had even more to be frustrated about off the field. Rumors of thrown games plagued the Cubs during the latter part of the 1920 season gave impetus to the criminal investigations which eventually led to uncovering the infamous Black Sox Scandal across town with the White Sox. In addition, 1920 marked the beginning of prohibition, meaning fans would have to find some other way to quench their thirst during the many hot summer afternoons at Cubs Park. Although the Cubs teams of the early 1920s were little more than also-rans, the fans still flocked to Cubs Park. In 1922, 542,283 fans went through the turnstiles‚Äîthe second-highest attendance in the National League‚Äîto watch a fourth-place club. =Major renovations (1922‚Äì23)= Aerial rendering of the proposed expansion of Cubs Park, circa 1922. By 1922, William Wrigley had decided that after nine seasons, both the seating and the playing field of cozy Cubs Park were ready for a major expansion. Rather than rebuilding the grandstand from scratch, Wrigley hired original architect Zachary Taylor Davis to make the expansion around the existing structure. The grandstand would be sliced into three pieces, with the home plate section placed on rollers and moved roughly 60 feet west (away from right field), and the left field section about 100 feet northwest. Both gaps were to be filled in with more seating, resulting in a significantly longer grandstand and the noticeable \\"dog leg\\" shape of the stands on the first base side visible to this day. Additionally, the foul ground and the height of the fence in front of it would be reduced by additional rows of box seats added in front of the existing grandstand. The diamond and the foul lines would be rotated 3 degrees counterclockwise from their earlier orientation, allowing for those extra box seats. Home plate was moved with the center section of the original grandstand; in the current configuration, the original location is in the vicinity of the first base coaches box. The relocation of the grandstand would make right field far more spacious than before, even with the addition of new bleachers in right field from the corner to the center field scoreboard. The old wooden bleachers in left field were to be dismantled and replaced with newer steel-framed wooden seats like those being installed in right field. The renovations would boost the park's capacity from roughly 18,000 to 31,000. Its dimensions would be roughly 320 feet in left field, 318 in right, and 446 feet to straightaway center. Cubs Park grandstand, seen from the corner of Clark and Addision, divided into three segments during the 1922-23 expansion, prior to the construction of additional sections between the relocated segments. Note that, in the days before the famous marquee was installed, the ballpark was identified by a sign along the top of the grandstand reading \\"Chicago National League Baseball Club.\\" Work on the renovations began in December 1922 and were completed in time for the 1923 season opener. The changes were of such magnitude that many publications of the time referred to the \\"new\\" Cubs Park. Fans flocked to the park, and attendance shot up to 703,705 for the 1923 season, although this was once again only good for second-best in the National League. On the field, however, the Cubs remained also-rans. The team drifted aimlessly through the middle of the standings in 1923 and '24. By 1925, the Cubs found themselves commemorating their fiftieth season in the National League by finishing last for the first time (which in 1925 meant eighth place). The recently renovated Cubs Park, while a hit with the fans, was not without its critics. Their main objection was that the new left field bleachers were simply too easy a target for right-handed hitters. By late July and early August 1925, reporters were frequently griping about games lost to fly balls which would have been easy outs without the left field bleachers. During the Cubs' first road trip that month, the half of the left field bleachers closest to the foul line was dismantled, leaving a \\"jury box\\" of seats running from deep left-center to the center field scoreboard. The change cost the Cubs over a thousand seats, although that left-field area was sometimes filled with standing-room-only spectators behind ropes, as was the custom of the day. With the left field line now at a substantial 364 feet from home plate, home run production dropped. =Double decking the grandstand (1927‚Äì28)= The upper deck of the newly rechristened Wrigley Field remained unfinished throughout the 1927 season, extending only along the third base line. By 1926, the Cubs were benefiting handily from the peak of the Roaring Twenties. Nearly 900,000 fans went through the turnstiles at a park with a capacity of just over 30,000. After the close of the season, work began on adding a second deck to the grandstand. The original idea was to have the job completed by the opening of the 1927 season, but by April, only the third-base side of the upper deck had been completed, temporarily giving the park a startlingly asymmetrical appearance. Cubs Park was formally renamed Wrigley Field prior to the start of the 1927 season. Despite the half-finished state of the upper deck expansion, the 1927 Cubs drew over 1.1 million fans, becoming the first National League team ever to do so. In addition to the increased capacity of the park, the Cubs helped their own cause by becoming an increasingly competitive team under manager Joe McCarthy. The upper deck was finally completed in time for the 1928 season, which saw the Cubs break the million mark in attendance yet again. The timing couldn't have been more fortuitous. In 1929, the Cubs put together one of the most potent lineups in major league history, and easily walked to the National League pennant with stars like Hack Wilson, Rogers Hornsby, Kiki Cuyler, Charlie Root and Pat Malone. Season attendance soared to nearly 1.5 million fans. This would remain the major league record for seventeen years, a record aided in large part by declining major league attendance during the Great Depression and World War II. The Cubs themselves would not top this mark for another forty years. As the World Series approached, Wrigley sought to provide even more seating at the park. He contracted to have temporary wooden bleachers erected on both Waveland and Sheffield Avenues, raising the park's capacity to roughly 50,000. Both streets were closed to traffic. In the end, the bleachers were only needed for games one and two of the 1929 World Series, both of which the Cubs lost on their way to a five-game defeat at the hands of the underdog Philadelphia Athletics. By the early 1930s, distance markers were posted: left field line, 364 feet; left-center against the outer wall, 372; left center, corner of bleachers, 364; deep center field corner, 440; right center, 354; right field line, 321. During the 1968‚Äì1970 off-seasons, the concrete in the upper deck was stripped and replaced. After 40 years of harsh Chicago winters, the original concrete was showing signs of wear and tear; it was replaced with precast concrete installed over the 1927 steel framework.Chicago Tribune, January 31, 1969 pC1 In 2004, nearly 40 years later, this precast concrete itself began to show deterioration as several chunks of the precast concrete fell, leading to increased safety inspections and the installation of protective netting.Chicago Tribune, December 22, 2004 \\"Beautiful Wrigley Field\\" (1932‚Äì1981) =Construction of the bleachers (1937)= Wrigley Field is known for the Boston ivy (Parthenocissus tricuspidata) planted against the outfield wall in 1937 by Bill Veeck, whose father had been team president until his 1933 death. If the ball is hit into and lost in the ivy, then it is ruled a ground-rule double, provided that the defensive outfielder raises his hands to signify that the ball has been lost in the ivy; if the player attempts to search for the ball, the play is considered live, and no ground- rule double is ruled. Wrigley is also known for the manual scoreboard Veeck also erected. No batted ball has ever hit the scoreboard; indeed, very few home runs have even landed in the \\"upper deck\\" of the center field bleachers. However, Sam Snead did manage to hit the big board with a golf ball teed off from home plate, on April 17, 1951, just prior to the Cubs home opener. In 1937, the Cubs announced plans to rebuild the bleachers in concrete instead of wood, to be fronted by brick that would soon be covered in ivy, and to build a new scoreboard. To make the outfield look more symmetrical and graceful, the plans called for extending the left field bleachers to a point closer to the corner. The gentle curves between the ends of the left and right field bleachers would become popularly known as the \\"wells\\". That summer, the Chicago Tribune ran a series of articles about major league ballparks, and the writer sharply criticized the Cubs for a remodeling that he suspected would result in too many \\"cheap\\" home runs. The writer later retracted when he saw that the final plan was somewhat more spacious than originally announced. Be that as it may, construction went on behind a temporary fence during the summer, and the finished product was unveiled on September 4, in time for the last month of the season. Bill Veeck's famous ivy was planted not long after, but it would be another year before it fully took hold. According to his own autobiography, Veeck as in Wreck, he planted Bittersweet, which would grow quickly, and also the more famous Boston ivy, which would eventually take over. Another part of the arboretum was to be a series of Chinese elms on the large \\"stairsteps\\" up to the scoreboard, as well as one apiece in the little triangle at the top of each \\"well\\". According to Veeck's biography, that plan did not fare so well as the winds kept blowing the leaves off. Management finally gave up \\"after about twenty tries\\", so the trees are long gone, leaving just the large bare steps and (until 2006) the little flat triangular supports at the tops of the \\"wells\\". According to Veeck, the trees themselves were inexpensive, but the special construction for them in the bleachers cost about $200,000. Wrigley Field seen from above during the 1935 World Series. This was one of three times prior to 2005 that the Cubs erected temporary bleachers over the Waveland and Sheffield sidewalks. The other occasions were the 1929 and 1932 World Series. Another mistake was constructing bleachers in straightaway center field: The batters could easily lose sight of the ball in the white shirts worn by spectators on sunny days, because the wall was not high enough to provide a full batter's background by itself. Various methods were tried to get around this. At one time a flat canopy was extended over the area, to try to put the spectators in shadow, but that was ineffective (the 2005‚Äì2006 reconstruction would to some extent revisit that concept). For a while in the mid-1960s, a screen was attached to the top of the wall and the ivy twined its way up. Batters and bleacher fans disliked it, and it was removed after a couple of seasons. Later, for a number of years, a green tarp covered those seats. After generally being closed to spectators sometime in the late 1940s or early 1950s, the last time those three problem sections were used for baseball was during the 1962 All-Star game. The seats continued to be used for other events such as football and soccer, during the years when the Chicago Bears and the Chicago Sting played their games here. By the 1990s, the area was occupied by juniper plants, which nicely complemented the ivy. Also, the layout was tweaked a bit, to open up a few seats on either side of the straight center field area while still providing a rectangular background from the perspective of the batter. After the 2005 season, the plants were temporarily removed during reconstruction (see below). Over the following winter, a lounge was constructed in the upper part of this area and new rows of juniper bushes were placed in the lower part. By the end of 1937, the dimensions were set: 355 feet to the left field corner, a few feet behind where the corner wall tangents the foul pole; 368 to fairly deep left-center; 400 to the deepest part of center (at the right edge of the batters background area); 368 to right center; and 353 to the right field foul pole. There are other intriguing distances that have never been posted. In the original Encyclopedia of Baseball, by Hy Turkin and S.C. Thompson, 1951, measurements of 357 feet to the left field \\"well\\" and 363 to the right field \\"well\\" were revealed. That would put the closest point of the left end of the bleachers no more than about 350 feet from home plate, a fact many pitchers have cursed over the years. Left-center in general is shallow. Straightaway center is probably about 390. Deep center and the right field area in general are better balanced. But the shallowness of the left-center power alley, really too cozy for major league standards, and the resultant increase in home runs in the decades since 1937, suggest that the Chicago Tribune's original skeptical assessment was correct. The \\"basket\\", an angling chain-link fence that runs along the top of the outfield wall, was installed at the start of the 1970 season. During the 1969 pennant race, there were several incidents of fans interfering with fly balls and even falling onto the field. There was also the first and only incident of a fan running the field and escaping without prosecution. A famous photograph was taken of the incident and published in the Chicago Sun-Times. The basket was intended to deter or prevent that kind of problem. Security cameras were also installed at that time. The \\"basket\\" angles away from the wall, and is also higher than the wall in order to provide some balance for the pitchers. However, over the years a number of baseballs have been hit \\"into the basket\\" for home runs that previously would have been outs, or off the wall, or possibly interfered with by fans. The basket only exists where there is seating. During the 1980s, when the bleacher seating was extended over the \\"catwalks\\", i.e. the bleacher ramps in extreme left and right fields, the basket was likewise extended. =First attempt at lights (1941)= Lights were scheduled to be added to Wrigley Field in 1942, but after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, then-owner Philip K. Wrigley (son of the late William) donated the necessary materials to the war effort. Founded by P.K. Wrigley, the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League (known for the first half of the 1943 season as the All-American Girls Softball League) began their inaugural season of play in the spring of 1943. On the evening of July 1, 1943, teams from the All-American League played an exhibition game at Wrigley Field as part of a Women's Army Corps (WAC) recruiting rally, attracting approximately 7,000 fans. With temporary lighting set up behind home plate along the first and third base lines, this would be the first night game to be played at Wrigley Field. The All-American Girls Baseball League would play the second ever night game at Wrigley the following year in another war drive exhibition. Baseball boomed after the war, allowing P. K. Wrigley to procrastinate on the issue of permanent lighting. He eventually decided never to install lights for a variety of publicly stated reasons, so Wrigley Field remained a bastion of day baseball until the Chicago Tribune Company era, which began in 1981; the first night game with permanent lighting was not until 1988.

The new owners started talking lights and began stirring debate on the matter. One of P. K. Wrigley's stated reasons for not installing lights was that it would upset the neighborhood, and the initial negative reaction to the Tribune Company's intentions validated P. K.'s prediction. Resistance to the installation of lights was not limited to those who lived nearby and opposed the lights on the practical grounds of bothersome brightness or the noise and crowds from night games. Many Cubs fans who lived outside Wrigleyville opposed the idea simply due to the fact that the Cubs' stance as the last team to resist night baseball was a point of pride, as it was seen as a vestige of baseball's heritage as a pastoral game, played in natural sunlight. Some Cubs fans also had fond associations with Gabby Hartnett's famous \\"Homer in the Gloaming,\\" in which Hartnett hit a crucial home run in the bottom of the ninth of a game on the verge of being called for darkness, helping the Cubs to win the 1938 pennant. The City of Chicago had passed an ordinance banning night events at Wrigley Field, due to its presence in the residential Lakeview neighborhood, so Tribune was unable to install lights unless the ordinance was repealed. They compromised by scheduling a significant number of 3:00 starts, which typically carried games into the evening but did not require lights for games that completed within three hours or so. This debate continued for several years, and became more intense as the Cubs returned to competitiveness during the early 1980s. When the Cubs won the National League Eastern Division title in 1984, then-commissioner Bowie Kuhn announced that the Cubs would lose home field advantage should they advance to the World Series (home field advantage alternated between the champions of the National League and American League until 2003), since by this time nearly all World Series games were played at night in the Eastern and Central time zones. After winning their two scheduled home (day) games in the National League Championship Series, the Cubs lost all three games in San Diego, so Kuhn's threat became moot. But the following year, new commissioner Peter Ueberroth announced that because Wrigley Field had no lights, the Cubs would have to play all future postseason games at another ballpark, likely Comiskey Park, Soldier Field, or possibly even St. Louis' Busch Stadium, or Milwaukee County Stadium. The Cubs fell out of contention for the next several years, however, and the possibility of playing post-season \\"home\\" games in other cities did not arise. The Cubs, under team president Dallas Green, quickly changed the issue from lights or no lights to Wrigley Field or move out of town. With typical bluntness, Green said, \\"if there are no lights in Wrigley Field, there will be no Wrigley Field.\\" Green seriously considered shuttering Wrigley and playing at Comiskey Park as tenants of the White Sox for a year, in hopes that the neighborhood would feel the loss of revenue and back down. The Cubs also explored moving to several suburban locations, including a site adjacent to Arlington Park in Arlington Heights and another in Schaumburg. There was even talk of a drastic move which involved selling the stadium to local college DePaul University, who would likely tear down Wrigley Field to host its indoor sports or convert it to a full-time football stadium in hopes of returning football to the campus. The Cubs would then likely build a new ballpark near the Rosemont Horizon (now the Allstate Arena, where DePaul plays its home games currently) in suburban Rosemont. The Cubs' new stance quickly changed the context of the debate, as even the most adamant opponents of adding lights didn't want to see the Cubs leave for the suburbs. Schaumburg officials were so convinced that the Cubs were actually coming that land was purchased by investors hoping to build a new ballpark off the Elgin-O'Hare Expressway west of I-355. When the Cubs and the city of Chicago came to an agreement to keep the team on the North Side, the site spawned a ballpark anyway, with field dimensions and shape identical to Wrigley Field, even mimicking the \\"wells\\" along the outfield wall, and the 'dogleg' in the visitor's dugout along the first base line. That stadium, Boomers Stadium (formerly known as Alexian Field), is now home to the (non-affiliated) minor league Schaumburg Boomers. In the fall of 1987, Chicago mayor Harold Washington proposed a compromise ordinance to the Chicago City Council which allowed the Cubs to install lights, but limited the number of night games. Washington died a week after the compromise was proposed, but the city eventually approved a compromise in February 1988 under interim mayor Eugene Sawyer. Major League Baseball responded by awarding the Cubs the 1990 All-Star Game. Lights, bleacher expansion, and exterior ivy The first major league night game at Wrigley was attempted on August 8 against the Philadelphia Phillies, but was rained out after 3¬Ω innings. During the rain delay, several Cubs players, imitating a scene in the recent film hit, Bull Durham, played \\"slip-and-slide\\" on the tarp. One source says the group included Greg Maddux, Al Nipper, Les Lancaster and Jody Davis. Manager Don Zimmer was not amused, and they were fined $500 apiece. The first official night game was played the following night, August 9 against the New York Mets (in front of a nationally televised audience watching Vin Scully and Joe Garagiola call the game on NBC), ending a streak of 5,687 consecutive home day games. However, this was not the first night game of any kind at Wrigley, as in the 1940s, some AAGPBL night games were played in Wrigley Field using temporary lighting structures; specifically, the All-Star Game held in July 1943, was the first night baseball game there, according to the Lowry book and the movie A League of Their Own. Starting with their first full season with lights, in 1989, as part of the compromise with the city, the Cubs were limited to 18 night games within their 81-game regular season schedule, plus any post-season games that might have to be played at night for TV scheduling reasons. The timing of the lights' installation proved fortuitous, as the Cubs reached the post-season in 1989. Their first two post- season night games were the first two games of the NLCS, on October 4 and 5. They lost the first game against the San Francisco Giants 11‚Äì3, and won the second game 9‚Äì5. The Cubs' post-season appearances since 1988 (as well as their one-game regular-season playoff with San Francisco in 1998) have featured mostly night games, the exceptions (as of 2007) being the fourth game of their 2003 NLDS matchup with the Atlanta Braves and third game of the 2007 NLDS against the Arizona Diamondbacks, both of which were Saturday afternoon contests. In recent years, the Cubs have successfully lobbied for additional regular-season night games (up to a potential 30 per year, as of 2007). However, per their agreement with the city, they still play most of their games during the day. Due to the limited night schedule, night games at Wrigley Field are considered an \\"event\\" and are almost always sold out well in advance. Some observers compare the atmosphere of a Wrigley Field night game to that of Rush and Division streets, the longtime epicenter of Chicago's nightclub scene. Wrigley Field has continuously evolved over its 90-plus seasons. There is relatively little left of the original that is visible to the casual viewer. One of the more obvious originals were the brick portions of the outer bleacher wall, visible in the \\"back of Wrigley Field\\" photo. The Cubs' bleacher expansion resulted in removal of those bricks, which were later sold to the public individually at a \\"garage sale\\" at the start of the 2006 season. =Bleacher expansion and renovation (2005‚Äì2006)= Chris Young in the bullpen located in playable foul territory, with remodeled center field area in background. After lengthy debate, the reconstruction and expansion of the bleachers (by some 1,900 seats) finally began after the close of the 2005 season, although it was strongly opposed by Chicago Mayor Richard Daley. The first part of the process was to remove the outer brick wall, one of the last vestiges of the 1914 structure. Additionally, much of the 1937 construction behind the inner ivy-covered wall was removed (except for the steel supports and the center field upper tier) and the former sidewalk was excavated. The work progressed quickly throughout the winter, aided by the relatively mild Midwestern January. The original concept called for the bleachers to simply extend out over the sidewalks, supported by open steel columns in cantilevered design, connecting new steel to the existing steel that supported the old bleachers. That plan was altered somewhat when it was feared the area would become an impromptu homeless shelter. Thus the vertical part of the supporting structure for the new bleachers was encased in a wall constructed of new bricks, in a style reminiscent of the original wall, and the sidewalk (repaved in brick) became a few feet narrower. The only part hanging over the sidewalk is the flat walkway behind the bleachers. The upper part of the formerly vacant center field area is occupied by a large luxury suite, fronted by darkened, slanted windows so as not to interfere with the batters' sight lines, and the lower part by juniper plants that had been temporarily removed. Another notable change to the configuration was to replace the solid door in the right field corner with a chain-link fence gate, so passers-by can see part of the ballfield (an idea borrowed from Oracle Park). Various Internet sites displayed photos tracking the progress of construction. The results support what management had stated, that the changes would not depart radically from the previous structure. On March 30, 2006, the Cubs announced the bleachers would be renamed the Bud Light bleachers. A sign to that effect was soon posted over the bleacher entryway which contrasts significantly with its previous look. The Cubs management also announced they would plant ivy on the rebuilt exterior walls, in a soil trough that was provided as part of the construction. Conventional Boston ivy was planted on the east-facing Sheffield wall, which gets a fair amount of sunlight during morning hours. The north- facing wall along Waveland, which receives little direct sunlight in the summer and none in the winter, was to have an \\"evergreen\\" variety, English ivy, which thrives in shade. The bleacher expansion project was designed by HOK Architecture, of Kansas City Missouri with Osborn Engineering of Cleveland, Ohio serving as the engineer. On January 4, 2008 the Cubs got permission to add 80 new seats to the ballpark. The Cubs also got permission to add new signs. Wrigley Field will now hold up to 41,198 people after adding the seats. =Giving Wrigley a new Field (2007‚Äì2008)= The turf replacement in progress through Wrigley's right field fan window. After view of the turf replacement. At the end of the Cubs' 2007 season, two different efforts were undertaken to upgrade the playing field at the old ballpark. A few years earlier, a Sports Illustrated poll found that the players considered Wrigley's playing field to be one of the poorest in the Major Leagues. The renovations should go a long way toward fixing that situation. First, as reported on the Cubs official website and also reported and pictured in the November issue of Chicago Cubs Vine Line, the Cubs official fan magazine (p. 4), the outfield and portions of the infield were replaced by turf purchased from an Oswego, Illinois, firm. This was accomplished in the 13 days between the last home regular season game and the first (and last, as it turned out) post-season game for the year. The project was supervised by Roger Bossard, who is the head groundskeeper for the Chicago White Sox. Then, following the post-season, as reported on the Cubs website and also reported and pictured in the December issue of Vine Line , a more ambitious project began, to install a state-of- the-art drainage system. The entire playing surface at Wrigley was removed, which required digging down . The underlying base material was replaced by a system of of piping buried in a special clay. The drainage system capable of holding 60,000 gallons of water was installed, on top of which a new playing surface of Colorado-grown sod was unrolled. This renovation, replacing a system installed in 1935, makes Wrigley the last Major League field to move away from a crown-based water management system. The infield had been at a somewhat raised elevation relative to the shallow part of the outfield and the far edge of the foul ground around the infield, hence the gutters in front of the box seat railings. As of 2008, the infield now sits lower than it did, by , eliminating the slight downhill slope that runners had to contend with upon rounding third base, and also allowing the managers in the dugouts to see the opposite-field outfielder in full, not just his \\"top half\\". The system allows for much shorter rain delays, while also controlling the flow of water toward the storm sewers. The ballpark sits on a block that has a noticeable downhill slope from the northwest corner to the southeast corner. The left field (northwest) corner of the playing field is several feet below street level. The natural drainage direction is toward the right field (southeast) corner, and the new system directs all the water through an outlet under the right field corner. As part of the excavation, the crew found and removed the foundations of the goal posts from the Bears' playing days. The crew also reported that they left a \\"time capsule\\" buried somewhere under the new turf. Lowering the infield by also effectively raises the outfield barrier by , from the standpoint of the batter. It remains to be seen whether that factor will have any effect on home run production. =Will it remain Wrigley Field? (2007‚Äì2008)= Tribune owner Sam Zell announced that he would consider selling the naming rights for Wrigley Field in order to help reduce the Tribune Company's $13 billion debt. Based on the recent sponsorship deals at the time, it was estimated that naming rights for the park were worth at least $10 million per year. Many Chicago baseball fans thought that the park is too historic to have the name changed, and some experts projected that naming rights would have commanded a lower cost in comparison to newer parks because of the anticipated fan backlash, to which Zell stated in an interview with Crain's Chicago Business: Even if the name of the stadium had changed, the famous Wrigley Field Marquee would have stayed the same. The marquee is protected by the Chicago city council, and declared a local landmark. =Sale of the Cubs (2009)= With Tribune's sale of the Cubs (and Wrigley Field) to Thomas S. Ricketts in 2009, further improvements to the park were developed, including construction of the long-discussed \\"triangle building\\" immediately to the west of the park at the intersection of Clark Street and Waveland Avenue, which would house some of the team's offices as well as a retail concourse and weight room for the players. Ricketts has also stated, \\"We don't have any naming-rights discussions going on at all. I think Wrigley is the name we are going to go with.\\" =Daktronics video screens and bleacher reconstruction (2014‚Äì2017)= In October 2014 demolition began on a 3-year renovation project under the ownership of Ricketts. Bleacher expansion, a pair of Daktronics video boards in left and right field, and five outfield signs were slated to debut by Opening Day 2015, but were hampered by winter weather, and construction extended well into the 2015 season. With the city of Chicago vacating Seminary Street directly west of the ballpark, construction crews also laid the foundation for a underground clubhouse beneath it, and triangular lot bordered by Clark, Waveland, and the park. Construction was complete for the start of the 2016 season. At grade level above the clubhouse, the Cubs created an outdoor space that is open to anyone, with or without a ticket, with seating, grassy areas, and additional vendor kiosks. Called \\"The Park at Wrigley\\", this area houses an ice rink for open skating during the winter. Restoration of the groundskeeper's house (which from 1923 to 1957 was the home of the stadium groundskeeper) at the northwestern corner of the park was also completed in 2016. Other major changes, such as installing a new gate on the west side of the ballpark, relocating bullpens from along foul-lines to underneath the bleachers, and additional seating in the foul territory formerly occupied by the bullpens, were completed in time for the 2017 season. A complete renovation of the visitor's locker room is scheduled for the winter of 2018‚Äì19. Additional significant renovations planned include: \\"bunker suites\\" ‚Äî suites that would have no view of the field, but would instead lead to seating areas ‚Äî beneath the concourse down the third-base line; removal of old ramps to the upper deck to be replaced with stairs; new elevators to comply with Americans with Disabilities Act regulations; and additional signage on the grandstand facade, which includes a ribbon-style board. Construction of the video screens were controversial and met with resistance by some fans who oppose putting video screens at Wrigley in deference to tradition and is strenuously opposed by the rooftop owners association, owners of 15 rooftop clubs overlooking Wrigley who have a contract with the Cubs that runs through 2023 requiring them to pay the team 17 percent of their gross annual revenue. The association said the new signs would cut down their view of the ballpark and \\"would absolutely violate our 20-year contract, just as they violate the spirit of Wrigley‚Äôs long-standing landmark status.\\" Owners of the rooftop clubs sued the city in August 2014, seeking to block the expansion. However, many of the association owners have sold their properties to the Ricketts family, paving the way for the completion of the bleacher project.

Training in the meantime remained at existing locations. = Defence Technical Training Change Programme = As part of the Defence Technical Training Change Programme, part of the wider Defence Training Review, the MOD announced on 18 July 2011 that the Defence College of Technical Training (DCTT) would relocate to MOD Lyneham in Wiltshire. Plans called for the relocation of various British Army, Royal Navy and RAF training facilities to Lyneham, with the aim of modernising technical training and achieving efficiencies. Initially it was planned that the following training functions would relocate to Lyneham. * Electronic and Mechanical Engineering ‚Äì training for vehicle mechanics, recovery mechanics, armourers, metalsmiths, control equipment technicians and technical support specialists, and the Royal Navy's marines engineers. As a result of the move to MOD Lyneham, the Army's Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) technical training establishments at Arborfield Garrison in Berkshire and Bordon Garrison in Hampshire, would both close. No. 4 School of Technical Training based at RAF St. Athan in Vale of Glamorgan and the Defence School of Marine Engineering at HMS Sultan, Gosport in Hampshire would also relocate. * Aeronautical Engineering ‚Äì training for avionics and aircraft technicians. Delivery of Army training would relocate from Arborfield Garrison, RAF training at No. 1 School of Technical Training and the Aeronautical Engineering & Management Training School at RAF Cosford in Shropshire and the Royal Naval Air Engineering & Survival Equipment School at HMS Sultan. * Communications and Information Systems ‚Äì field based tactical training and classroom/workshop based technical training, relocating from the Royal School of Signals at Blandford Camp in Dorset and No. 1 Radio School at RAF Cosford. In 2012, DCEME joined three other technical training colleges under a combined organisation, the Defence College of Technical Training (DCTT), and reverted in title to being a Defence School. Michael Fallon, Secretary of State for Defence, announced in September 2015 that the relocation of the RAF and Royal Navy training elements to Lyneham would no longer take place. A re-evaluation of the programme determined that the consolidation onto a single site was no longer the best option. The first phase, the relocation of the REME schools from Aborfield and Bordon would still proceed. REME training at Arborfield and Bordon transferred to Lyneham in September 2015, and was due to begin at Lyneham by November of that year.

Aderholt died on 20 May 2010. Biography Aderholt was born in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1920. He entered active military duty through the aviation cadet program in April 1942 and graduated from pilot training with a commission as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Air Corps in May 1943. During World War II, from October 1943 to August 1945, Aderholt served in North Africa and Italy as a B-17 and C-47 pilot. In September 1945 Aderholt went to Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, assigned as a staff pilot with the Army Air Forces Eastern Flying Training Command. After completion of Air Tactical School at Tyndall Air Force Base, Florida, in December 1948, Aderholt returned to Maxwell and served as a flight instructor and flying safety officer with the 3800th Air Base Wing.

Aderholt is second from right, in the fur-collared flight jacket. During the Korean War, from July 1950 to September 1951, Aderholt commanded a Special Air Warfare Detachment of the 21st Troop Carrier Squadron. He next was assigned as an operations staff officer with the 1007th Air Intelligence Service Group in Washington, D.C. In June 1953 he was transferred to Donaldson Air Force Base, South Carolina, where he served with Headquarters Eighteenth Air Force as tactical and operations staff officer in the Directorate of Operations and Training. In October 1954, Aderholt was assigned to Headquarters United States Air Forces in Europe, Wiesbaden Air Base, Germany, and served in the Directorate of Plans as an unconventional warfare planning staff officer. In September 1957 Aderholt returned to Washington, D.C., assigned to the 1007th Air Intelligence Service Group as a special warfare staff officer, and in September 1959 joined the 1040th United States Air Force Field Activity Squadron in the same capacity. Aderholt left for Okinawa in January 1960 where he became commander of the 1095th Operational Evaluation Training Group. During this assignment, he contributed to the pioneering of special air warfare techniques, and was instrumental in developing the Laos airfield complex known as Lima sites. These fields were used throughout Southeast Asia as support sites for special warfare operations and as CH-3 \\"Jolly Green\\" helicopter forward staging bases for rescue and recovery operations in Laos and North Vietnam. From August 1962 to February 1964, Aderholt served as special advisor to the commander of the United States Air Force Special Air Warfare Center (SAWC) at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. During this period, he contributed to and participated in RAND Corporation studies which resulted in the publication of the Single Integrated Attack Team Study. He then was transferred to Hurlburt Field, Florida, (Eglin Auxiliary Field 9) where he served as vice commander and commander of the famed 1st Air Commando Wing. Aderholt left for the Republic of the Philippines in August 1965 where he was assigned as deputy commander for plans and operations with the 6200th Materiel Wing at Clark Air Base. While in this assignment, he joined the United States Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, where he conceived and activated the Joint Personnel Recovery Center in Saigon, and served as chief from July to December 1966. He then was selected by Headquarters Pacific Air Forces to activate the 56th Air Commando Wing at Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Air Force Base, Thailand. This wing, which he organized and commanded from December 1966 to December 1967, conducted low- level night interdiction missions over the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Laos and North Vietnam, using prop-driven aircraft. The efforts of this wing were so successful in slowing infiltration that the enemy reacted by greatly increasing anti-aircraft defenses and committing a large amount of his total assets to keep the trail open. In January 1968 Aderholt was reassigned to the United States Air Force Special Air Warfare Center, later redesignated United States Air Force Special Operations Force (SOF), at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, to serve as deputy chief of staff for operations. Aderholt returned to Thailand in June 1970 for a two-year tour of duty as chief of the Air Force Advisory Group, Joint United States Military Advisory Group, in Bangkok. He retired from active military duty in December 1972 at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. He was recalled to active duty in October 1973 and assigned as deputy commander, United States Military Assistance Command Thailand, and deputy chief, Joint United States Military Advisory Group - Thailand, with headquarters at Bangkok. Aderholt became commander, USMACTHAI, and chief, JUSMAG, Thailand, in May 1975. Evacuation of the Hmong One of Aderholt's prouder moments was his assistance in evacuating Hmong leaders from Laos as the Pathet Lao communist army advanced on their base at Long Tieng in May 1975. The United States by that time had withdrawn all its civilian and military personnel from Indochina, except for a few Embassy personnel in Laos. Aderholt was the last American general on the ground in Southeast Asia. He had few resources. Aderholt was informed that help was needed to evacuate the Hmong who for more than a decade had comprised the \\"secret army\\" in Laos assisting the United States in fending off the North Vietnamese Army in the Lao Civil War. He located one American C-130 (leaving star and bar marking) transport aircraft and two CASI C-46 aircraft and pilots in Thailand.Trest, Warren A., \\"Air Commando One: Heinie Aderholt And America's Secret Air Wars\\", Smithsonian Institution Press, Washington, D.C., London, 2000, Library of Congress card number 99-053643, , page 252. He had the planes \\"sheep dipped\\" to remove all markings identifying them as American-owned and sent them to Long Tieng. In four days of intense activity, the transport planes evacuated more than 2,000 Hmong, including General Vang Pao and Jerry Daniels, his CIA case officer.Thompson, Larry Clinton, Refugee Workers in the Indochina Exodus, 1975‚Äì1982. Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2010, 55-59 During the last few years of his life, from 2002 until 2010, Aderholt was directly involved with the Thailand Laos Cambodia Brotherhood as a member of the TLC Assistance Committee working to raise many thousands of dollars of funds and also made several trips back to Northeast Thailand and Laos hands on involved with humanitarian aid. The TLC Brotherhood has dedicated an assistance project in his memory and many of the members of the TLC Brotherhood served at Nakhon Phanom at all phases. Decorations His military decorations and awards include the Legion of Merit with two oak leaf clusters, Distinguished Flying Cross with oak leaf cluster, Bronze Star Medal with oak leaf cluster, Meritorious Service Medal, Air Medal with eight oak leaf clusters, Joint Service Commendation Medal, Air Force Commendation Medal, Presidential Unit Citation Emblem, and the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award Ribbon with oak leaf cluster. He is a command pilot and wears the Parachutist Badge. Aderholt was promoted to major in February 1951; lieutenant colonel in March 1961; and colonel in January 1964.Trest, Warren A. (2000).

The planet is currently the only confirmed planet orbiting the star OGLE-TR-111 (though a possible second planet is plausible). In 2002 the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) survey detected that the light from the star periodically dimmed very slightly every 4 days, indicating a planet-sized body transiting the star. But since the mass of the object had not been measured, it was not clear that it was a true planet, low-mass red dwarf or something else. In 2004 radial velocity measurements showed unambiguously that the transiting body is indeed a planet. The planet is probably very similar to the other hot Jupiters orbiting nearby stars. Its mass is about half that of Jupiter and it orbits the star at a distance less than 1/20th that of Earth from the Sun. OGLE- TR-111b has similar mass and orbital distance as the first transiting planet, HD 209458 b (Osiris). But unlike it, the planet has a radius comparable to Jupiter which is typical to other transiting planets detected by OGLE. However, those other planets tend to be more massive and orbit even closer than typical hot Jupiters.

Possessing a great sense of strategy and analysis in battle, he was always underestimated by the contemporary media due to his Peruvian origin (on his mother's side). His victories in unbalanced conditions were decisive to the triumph of Chile in the War of the Pacific. Early years Carlos Condell was born August 14, 1843 in Valpara√≠so, Chile. His father was the Scottish merchant marine Federico Condell, and his mother was the Peruvian aristocrat Lady Manuela De la Haza. His uncles were Diego and Antonio De la Haza, both rear admirals of the Peruvian Navy. Therefore, he had several cousins who were Peruvian naval officers. Condell did not have familial ties to Chile, and this fact resulted in ostracism and criticism during his life. He was the sixth of ten children. His first and second brothers were born in Peru. He studied in Valpara√≠so, first at the Colegio de los Sagrados Corazones (School of the Sacred Heart) between 1849 and 1854, and then at the Colegio Ingl√©s (English School). Military career At the age of fifteen (July 29, 1858), Condell joined the navy as a cadet, forming part of the renowned Curso de los H√©roes (Class of the Heroes) together with Arturo Prat, Juan Jos√© Latorre, Jorge Montt and Luis Uribe. Three years later (July 15, 1861), Condell achieved the rank of officer cadet (guardiamarina in Spanish). =First years of service= His first naval engagements were the Battle of Papudo (November 26, 1865) and the Battle of Abtao (February 8, 1866) in the Spanish-Chilean War, in which he fought allied with Miguel Grau and other Peruvian officers, who would become Condell's enemies the next decade. In April 1867, Condell decided to withdraw from the Chilean Navy and become a merchant. He opened a store in Valpara√≠so which only lasted for 7 months: he returned to the navy and was assigned to the ship Esmeralda. In December 1868, he participated in the honorable mission to return the remains of Bernardo O'Higgins back to Chile. Later, he served in the ships Abtao and Chacabuco. In the following years, he sailed to the islands of Juan Fern√°ndez and to the south of Chile. Ending 1876, aboard the Corvette Esmeralda, he travelled to Easter Island and Tahiti. =Civilian hiatus= In March 1872, Carlos Condell again decided to withdraw from the navy, seeking again the merchant life of his father, but his business never achieved good results. In Valpara√≠so, he met a young woman of only 16 who became his future wife, Matilde Lemus Valdivieso. They married on September 26, 1877. They had four children. March 1876, after four years of civilian life, he returned to navy and again was assigned to the ship . =War of the Pacific (1879‚Äì1883)= Condell in 1880 At the beginning of the War of the Pacific (April 5, 1879), Condell was already promoted to corvette captain in charge of the corvette Abtao, and was commissioned the blockade of the port of Iquique, a Peruvian possession at that time. The next month, Condell was in charge of the schooner Covadonga, together with Arturo Prat, in charge of the slightly larger corvette Esmeralda, two of the older ships in the Chilean navy. They were left behind by the rest of the fleet heading to the main Peruvian port of El Callao to attempt a definitive assault. On May 21, these small ships engaged the Peruvian armoured frigate Independencia and the monitor Hu√°scar (respectively). While Prat lost his battle and died heroically in Battle of Iquique, Condell managed to escape to the south, pursued by the Independencia (captained by Juan Guillermo More), which possessed size and firepower in this encounter. Nevertheless, Condell managed to pin the enemy ship into the coastal reef, bombard back, and get away while the monitor Hu√°scar showed in the shipwreck scene to assist the trapped crew of Independencia. After this battle, the balance in the War of the Pacific was broken, since only the Hu√°scar remained as a menace to the Chilean naval power. Condell was promoted to frigate captain and set in charge of the gunboat Magallanes. On November 2, 1879, Condell participated in the assault and takeover of the port of Pisagua, the blockade of Arica, and afterwards, the combat against the fortresses of the same city and the ship Manco Capac. In 1880, he took charge of a well-known enemy ship captured in the Battle of Angamos: The Hu√°scar. He used the monitor to siege and block the port of El Callao and other conflicts of the War of the Pacific. The rejection and animosity among the Peruvian people was on the rise due to several combat encounters in which Condell emerged triumphant. Exactly three years after the battles of the Iquique and the Punta Gruesa (May 21, 1881), Condell was promoted to captain, and sent to Europe in December. He returned in 1884, when the War of the Pacific ended in Chile's favor. Last years In 1884 Condell was designated as an aggregate of the Ministry of the Seas (Ministerio de Marina) and put in charge of the armoured frigate Cochrane as Commodore. Starting in 1887 he was transferred to the frigate Blanco (on April 4), where he assumed the position of chief of the national navy, a position he had to leave due to a serious disease. Nevertheless, on August 17 he was promoted to the rank of rear admiral (Contraalmirante in Spanish). Carlos Condell died in Quilpu√©, on November 24, 1887, at the early age of 44. His remains were carried to the Crypt of the Naval Heroes (Cripta de los H√©roes Navales) in Valpara√≠so.

Evening Edition included multiple hours of programming, cut into by long-form programs such as When Weather Changed History, as well as a repeating overnight hour. It broadcast (including long-form programming) every weeknight from 9 p.m. to 3 a.m. ET. Program history Evening Edition debuted in 2001, the first program to cut into the time slot of Weather Center, as part of a shift from 24-hour Weather Center to multiple focused programs that occurred during 2000 and 2001. Because of long-form programs, Evening Edition aired its first hour, then long-form programs, then two hours, then long-form programs repeated from earlier, followed by the overnight hour (respectively from 9 to 10 p.m., 11 p.m. to 1 a.m. and 2 to 3 a.m. Eastern).The Weather Channel's program schedule As a result, Weather Center PM was relegated to a mere 7-9pm timeslot. During the final five months of its run, the first hour of Evening Edition, aired at 8pm eastern (instead of 9pm eastern), was hosted by Stephanie Abrams and Mike Bettes and, for most intents and purposes, was an extension of the preceding program, Abrams & Bettes: Beyond the Forecast. The second and third hours were the main program, hosted by Jim Cantore, Paul Goodloe and Alexandra Steele. The overnight hour aired live (at 2am) after the second hour of long-form programs (repeated from the first hour). It was hosted by one meteorologist and then was repeated twice (3am & 4am) until the next morning's first program (either First Outlook on weekdays or When Weather Changed History on weekends). It was revealed via changes to electronic program guide systems and through an inadvertent image change on the Weather Channel media kit website that the show's time slots would be given to a relaunched version of Weather Center, which contains a mix of the traditional Evening Edition format as well as new segments. Weekends were also slated to feature PM Edition Weekend in place of Evening Edition, but only for three hours - it later turned out that Weather Center was to take this over too. The remainder of the weekend evenings now featured long-form programming. Evening Edition aired its final broadcast on March 1, 2009.

The sport's first major venue in the city, it was an early home of Dundee F.C. and staged Dundee's first international match in 1896. History East End, one of the leading Dundee clubs, were based at Carolina Port from 1891. When they merged with local rivals Our Boys to form Dundee F.C. in 1893, it was generally assumed that the new club  which had immediately secured election to the Scottish Football League  would base themselves at Carolina Port, which was the most developed ground in Dundee at that time. They were, however, surprisingly beaten to the punch by a comparatively modest local outfit, Strathmore, who secured the lease for themselves. As a result, Dundee began their campaign in the less imposing surroundings of Our Boys' former home, West Craigie Park. Strathmore's audacious move failed to pay off, and within a year they had merged with Johnstone Wanderers to form Dundee Wanderers, playing at Clepington Park. This left Carolina Port available for Dundee to move in midway through their debut season. Having now become a regular venue for matches in Scotland's top flight, Carolina Port's prestige was further enhanced on 21 March 1896 when it hosted the Home International fixture between Scotland and Wales. Two Dundee players, Alex Keillor and William Thomson, were in the Scottish side. Keillor became the first Dundee player to score a goal for Scotland, as the home side ran out 4-0 winners. Despite this, it was recognised that Carolina Port's location posed problems. Hemmed in amongst Dundee's harbour and overlooked by a huge pile of shale nicknamed the \\"burning mountain\\", future development of the stadium would be difficult. After a major reorganisation of the club in 1898, Dundee F.C. took the decision to relocate to a new site at Dens Park in the less built-up Clepington district. The club moved to their new ground in 1899 (where they are still playing well over 100 years later), and Carolina Port was rapidly consumed by the expansion of the harbour.

Since low-mass red dwarfs and brown dwarfs may mimic a planet radial velocity measurements were necessary to calculate the mass of the body. In 2004 the object was proved to be a new transiting extrasolar planet. The planet has a mass 1.14 times that of Jupiter. Since the planet's inclination is known, this represents the best measured true mass of the planet, rather than simply the minimum mass as is the case when the inclination is unknown. It orbits the star (OGLE-TR-132) in an extremely close orbit, even closer than the famous planets 51 Pegasi b and HD 209458 b. The planet races around the star every 1 day 16.6 hours. The radius of the planet is only 18% larger than Jupiter's, despite the heating effect by the star. Planets of its kind are sometimes called \\"super-hot Jupiters\\".

It is maintained by the Jardin botanique du Montet and the Conservatoire et Jardins Botaniques de Nancy, open daily in the warmer months; an admission fee is charged. Location and climate The Jardin d'altitude du Haut Chitelet is located at an altitude of 1,228 m, on the northwest side of the Vosges massif on the Route des Cr√™tes, near the peak of Hohneck (Vosges) about 1 km south of the Col de la Schlucht, 88400 Xonrupt-Longemer in Vosges (department), Lorraine (region), France. The garden contains the source of the river Vologne and is surrounded by the eponymous high-altitude meadows \\"Hautes Chaumes\\", which are typical for the tops of the highest peaks of the Vosges at an altitude above 1250 to 1300 meters. The Vosges massif forms the first natural barrier for Atlantic winds and moisture, causing rainfall even in the middle of summer. The mountain climate at the garden is marked by the following annual climatic averages: 200 days of precipitation, 162 days of snow cover, 2,200 mm of rainfall and an average temperature of 3.5 degree Celsius. A comparable climate is found at an altitude of 1,800 m in the Northern Alps or 2,000 m in the Pyrenees. The high humidity allows numerous lichens and mosses to flourish. History The garden was first established in 1903 as Montabey Botanical Garden by Professor Camille Brunotte of the Nancy-Universit√©, It had grown from 120 species in 1904 to 800 species in 1914 but unfortunately was destroyed at the beginning of World War I. In 1954 the Office national des for√™ts donated a second plot of 11 hectares to the University to restart the garden. The first work was carried out in 1965 by young French and German horticulturists, organised in work camps, covering nearly 2 hectares of rock. Plantings began in 1966 with the new garden opening in 1970. It has been named a Jardin Remarquable by the ministry of culture. In 2012, a drying peat bog accentuated by historic drainage operations and military trenches with subsequent colonization by shrubs and trees like willows, birches and spruces was restored by closing drainage channels to retain water. A walkway was built allowing visitors to view the ecosystem. Collections In terms of its alpine plant collections, the Jardin d'Altitude du Haut Chitelet is a useful complement to the University¬¥s Jardin botanique du Montet, which can only accommodate plants from medium high altitude mountains. As of 2013, the garden contained more than 2300 plant varieties with a particular focus on the Vosges including forest plants (mountain beech forest featuring beech with tortuous trunks and its particular herbaceous vegetation such as Gymnocarpium dryopteris, Polygonum bistorta, Cicerbita alpina), mosses (including clubmosses, Lycopodium), peat bog flora, ferns, mountain shrubs and medicinal plants as well as plants from the mountains of France, namely the Alpes, the Jura and the Pyr√©n√©es.Jardin d'altitude du Haut Chitelet Conservatoire et Jardins Botaniques de Nancy, 2013 As of 2017, the garden contained 2500 species.

It contains two directly heated thoriated- tungsten filament rated at 16.3 volts at approx. 1300 amperes for both filaments. The anode (plate) is designed to dissipate 1.5 MW. The tube may be operated as a class C amplifier in CW mode, where a single tube with an anode voltage of 22.5 kV DC can provide up to 2,158 kW of RF power.data sheet  Internal construction  The thoriated-tungsten filament consists of two independent sections mounted on water-cooled supports. The two filaments may be excited in quadrature to reduce hum contributed by an AC power source. Each filament is rated at a nominal value of 16.3 V at approx. 650 A for a total of over 20 kW of filament power required when the tube is in operation.  History  Experimental type X2159 was assigned to the development of a power tetrode by Eimac (then a division of Varian Associates) on May 28, 1970, and the design engineer was Sterling G. McNees. This electron tube was intended for use in very high power medium-frequency broadcast service and VLF communications equipment and as a pulse modulator (as a switch tube). The EIA (Electronic Industries Alliance) designation 8974 was assigned to this as it became a standard product. The initial technical data sheet was printed in July 1971. Continental Electronics of Dallas, Texas, designed two 8974s (one as PA and the other as modulator) into their D323 series 1 megawatt AM transmitters which were sold primarily into the middle East, where stations were built to cover large geographical areas. The 8974 is still used in the same transmitters , over 30 years later. The 8974 was also used as the basis for the development of several large tetrode switch tubes capable of operating at anode voltage up to 175 kV DC.  Cooling  The anode is cooled by circulated water via two flanges located at the top of the tube. The heat is transferred to the outside environment using a radiator, or to a secondary cooling system using a heat exchanger. Controlling the purity of the water is important to prevent the formation of copper oxide which would reduce the cooling efficiency. Impurities could also cause electrolysis which could destroy the cooling passages.EIMAC Care and Feeding of Power Grid Tubes, 5th edition, 2003, p. 149-150 The plumbing connections for the water inlet and outlet are made at the anode, where a high DC voltage (up to 22 kV DC) is present. Forced air is used to provide additional cooling to the filament and grid connections at the bottom of the tube.

Biography Frederick was born in Brzeg. He was the only son of John I, Duke of Lubin, by his wife Hedwig, daughter of Ludwik II of Brzeg. The successive deaths of his uncle Henry X (in 1452) and his own father (in 1453) left Frederick I as the last male representative of the Legnica- Brzeg branch of the Piast dynasty. The seven-year-old prince succeeded John I in Chojnow and Strzelin under the regency of his mother, the Dowager Duchess Hedwig. One year later (1454), Frederick I inherited Olava and Niemcza after the death of his paternal grandmother Margareta of Opole; shortly after, he also received Legnica from the Kingdom of Bohemia. The regency of Dowager Duchess Hedwig ended in 1466, when Frederick I was formally proclaimed an adult and was able to rule by himself. Throughout his reign he focused on the consolidation of his dynasty and the recovery of all the lands lost by his predecessors. In 1481 Frederick I purchased Brzeg from the Dukes of Opole, and one year later (1482) he did the same with Lubin, then in hands of the Dukes of G≈Çog√≥w. In 1488 he also recovered the towns of Byczyna, Wo≈Çczyn and Kluczbork. He died at Legnica in 1488. Marriage and issue On 5 September 1474, Frederick I married Ludmila, daughter of George of Podƒõbrady, King of Bohemia. They had three sons: *John II (1477 ‚Äì 6 March 1495). *Frederick II (12 February 1480 ‚Äì 17 September 1547). *George I (1481/83 ‚Äì 30 May 1521).

Koren created Koren Bible Type for the specific purpose of printing The Koren Bible, published by Koren Publishers Jerusalem in 1962. He created Koren Book Type for The Koren Siddur (Prayerbook), which the publishing house produced in 1981. Koren Bible Type Judah L. Magnes, President of The Hebrew University of Jerusalem asked Eliyahu Koren, then Korngold, to create a new font for an entirely new edition of the Hebrew Bible that he sought to publish under the University's auspices during World War II. The Bible was to be the first Bible designed, edited, printed, and bound by Jews in nearly 500 years. A design competition was held, and Korngold's font won. The preliminary version of the font that grew out of the competition was used in an edition of the Book of Jonah issued in 1946 by the publishing house of The Hebrew University (later Magnes Press). The font was not cast for this modest publication, but rather drawn by Korngold and reproduced photographically. The font was based on the Moshe Ben-Asher Codex of the Prophets manuscript, belonging to the Karaite community in Cairo, the earliest Medieval manuscript with a colophon, written in 895 CE in Tiberias. Following the Hebrew University's decision to publish a different edition of the Bible in 1953, Korngold resigned from the University Bible Committee and took over the initiative of producing a new, fully Jewish Bible with a new font. Korngold set out to design the most readable Hebrew font possible. He consulted Dr. Arie Feigenbaum, an ophthalmologist, who shared with him research conducted on the legibility of Latin book types. Korngold made clear distinctions between similar letters such as bet and kaf, gimel and nun, dalet and resh. He believed that each letter should be recognizable even if only its top 1/3 were visible. He also believed that designers should learn from the earliest printers and typographers, who based their fonts on fine handwriting. The final design was the result of Korngold's study and re-study of Hebrew manuscripts and early printing types, and a sensitive approach to modernization that maintained serifs and shading (the contrast of thick and thin elements of the letter). The Koren Bible Type was cast in 36-point by Deberny & Peignot, the largest typefounding firm in France, over the course of two years. The type arrived in Israel in 1957, and a proof page was printed at Ahva Press. Korngold (now Koren), disappointed by the result, insisted that the foundry redo the type due to a loss of character in the letters' corners. The foundry agreed, after their microscopic examination proved that the Koren type was off by .03 millimeters. =Koren Book Type= Eliyahu Koren created Koren Book Type for use in the Koren Siddur, published in 1981. Koren Type has been used in publications of Koren Publishers Jerusalem ever since, as well as in other important texts.

A single engined low-winged monoplane, it was designed and built to meet a United States Navy order for an advanced carrier based fighter. It exhibited poor handling, and was rejected by the Navy, the single prototype being lost in a crash. A variant, the Northrop 3A, also was unsuccessful. Development and design In the early 1930s, the United States Navy was interested in investigating the use of modern, monoplanes as fighter aircraft to replace the biplanes that equipped its fighter squadrons. In December 1932, it ordered the XF7B from Boeing, and based on the impressive performance of Northrop's Gamma and Delta, both stressed skin monoplanes, placed an order with Northrop on May 8, 1933 for a single prototype fighter, designated XFT-1.Green and Swanborough 1994, pp.454-455.Francillion 1979, p.173. The resulting aircraft, which was designed by a team led by Ed Heinemann resembled a scaled-down Northrop Delta. It was a low-winged monoplane, of all-metal stressed skin construction. It had a fixed tailwheel undercarriage with its main gear fitted with streamlining trouser fairings. The pilot sat in an enclosed cockpit with a sliding canopy. It was powered by a single Wright R-1510 radial engine. The XFT-1 first flew on January 16, 1934, being delivered to NAS Anacostia for evaluation by the Navy. While it was the fastest fighter yet tested by the U.S. Navy, its handling characteristics were poor. Although it was fitted with flaps to lower its landing speed, it was difficult to control at low speeds, and had poor forward visibility, major problems for an aircraft intended to operate off aircraft carriers. Its most serious problem, however, was its behavior when spinning, where the tail was subject to severe buffeting. In February 1934, test pilot Vance Breese landed the prototype XFT-1 without authorization at Glendale California at a Curtiss Wright Technical Institute location, and pictures of the XFT-1 were leaked to Janes AWA. It was fitted with a more powerful R-1510 engine in August 1934, but this did not improve performance, and it was returned to Northrop for more major modifications, being fitted with larger tail surfaces and a Pratt & Whitney R-1535 Twin Wasp Junior radial engine, being redesignated XFT-2.Francillion 1979, pp.174-175. The XFT-2 The XFT-2 was redelivered to Anacostia in April 1936,Francillion 1979, p.175. where it was found that while its performance had only slightly improved, its handling was even poorer than before, and it was rejected by the U.S. Navy as unairworthy. It was ordered to be returned to Northrop, and ignoring instructions to ship the aircraft back to Northrop's El Segundo factory, a test pilot attempted to fly the XFT-2 back to California, the aircraft entering a spin and crashing when crossing the Allegheny Mountains on July 21, 1936. The design formed the basis of the Northrop 3A, almost identical to the XFT except for a retractable undercarriage, which first flew in 1935. It was another failure, having a tendency for unintentional spins. After the 3A and its test pilot, Lieutenant Frank Scare, disappeared without trace on a flight over the Pacific Ocean off California on 30 July 1935, Northrop abandoned the 3A project and sold its blueprints to Chance Vought Aviation.Green and Swanborough 1994, p. 455.Angelucci and Bowers 1987, p. 361.

Datta-Ray has been a Bengali journalist for half a century. He has been editor of The Statesman (Calcutta and New Delhi) and has also written for the International Herald Tribune and Time. He was editor-in-Residence at the East-West Center in Honolulu. He was editorial consultant to Singapore's The Straits Times newspaper. Datta-Ray also worked in Singapore in the mid-1970s with S.R. Nathan. After the Straits Times, Datta-Ray was a supernumerary fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford. Datta-Ray returned to Singapore in 2007 to work on book with Lee Kuan Yew at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies based on a series of one-on-one conversations and a host of classified documents. The book was published in 2009 as Looking East to Look West: Lee Kuan Yew's Mission India and won that year's Vodafone Crossword Book Award. Personal history Datta Ray was born 13 December 1937 in Calcutta, and educated at La Martiniere for Boys School, Calcutta. After graduating in English from the University of Calcutta, Datta-Ray trained as a chartered accountant in England. In 1958 he was with the Stockport Advertiser, and in 1959 with the Northern Echo. In 1960 he joined The Statesman as junior London correspondent. In 1960‚Äì62 he was The Statesman's roving features editor, and 1962‚Äì68 the Sunday Magazine editor. In 1980‚Äì1986 he rose to be Deputy editor and became editor in 1986. A Hindu ‚Äì though his mother is of the Brahmo Samaj ‚Äî Datta-Ray had a Catholic wedding in Australia to a Bengali woman whom he met in Sydney. Datta-Ray sees himself as the product of the intermeshing of high- caste Bengali society and upper-class English society throughout the 18th and 19th centuries which, writes Datta-Ray, has now 'vanished'. Known as the Ingabanga, Datta-Ray defined his society thus: > It meant \\"England-worshipping Bengali\\" for Rabindranath Tagore. Krishna > Dutta and W. Andrew Robinson translated it as \\"Anglomaniacs\\". It was always > an outsider's description, never used by anglicised Bengalis themselves. > Born in the heartland of that world, my grandmother spoke always of \\"the > set\\". Datta-Ray is a direct descendant of B.L.Gupta who was one of three Indians (the others were Surendranath Banerjea and Romesh Chunder Dutt) who in 1869, after tackling British ethnic nationalism, became the first Indian civilian in the Indian Civil Service. B.L. Gupta was educated at University College London. Datta-Ray's grandfather, K.P. Basu, went to Downing College, Cambridge and Basu's sister is the mother of India's former Chief of Army Staff Shankar Roychowdhury. Another ancestor is Jatin Sen Gupta and his wife the English woman Nellie Sengupta who was the first woman President of the Indian National Congress. Datta-Ray's father was a student at the London School of Economics. Datta-Ray's is a member of the India International Centre and London's Travellers Club. He is also a member of the Bengal Club and the Calcutta Club. He resigned from the National Liberal Club (London). Monographs Datta-Ray has been published in Asia, Europe and the United States for over 40 years. He was asked to contribute to Penguin's book of 'new' Indian writing in 2005.Heralding a \`new generation' of Indian authors The Hindu - 20 May 2005 In addition to this Datta-Ray has penned four monographs and edited one. His \\"Didima: The Last Ingabanga\\" appears in the Penguin anthology First Proof: The Penguin Book of New Writing from India, vol. I. Datta-Ray's monograph Looking East to Look West: Lee Kuan Yew's Mission India (2009) charts aspects of Indian foreign policy with Singapore. Completely overlooked by academics, Singapore was also ignored by successive Indian prime ministers. Yet, Singapore is today the conduit for the bulk of foreign investment into India. Based on unique access to key decision makers including Lee Kuan Yew, Datta- Ray, for the first time, illuminates an essential aspect of Indian foreign relations on which hinges not only India's renewal but also the future of India's major foreign policy innovation since Non-Alignment‚Äîthe 'Look East' policy. He wrote the monograph Waiting For America about which the Doon School headmaster Kanti Bajpai wrote: > [A] huge book ... Datta-Ray is one of India's most respected journalists. An > elegant writer with an eye for story-telling and a no‚Äìnonsense analytical > pen, he traces the course of Indo-US ties from the time Indira Gandhi opened > them in 1982.

The town is the capital and administrative centre of the comarca of Els Ports, in the historic Maestrat (Maestrazgo) region. There are traces of settlement by the Iberians, succeeded by the Greeks and Romans, Visigoths and the Moors. From the early 17th century to the Spanish Civil War, the town was often fought over, due to its strategic situation between the Ebro and the coastal plain of Valencia. Morella is part of the Taula del S√©nia free association of municipalities. Every six years the citizens celebrate the Sexenni, a commemoration of the town's recovery from the plague in the seventeenth century. Tourism now plays an important part in the local economy, along with agriculture. In the 20th century the town and surrounding area became depopulated, a trend that has only been reversed in the early 21st century. The population of Morella at the start of 2019 was 2,430,Instituto Nacional de Estad√≠stica, Madrid, 2019 having declined from a figure of 7,335 in 1900 (INE). One of the typical gastronomic products of Morella is sweets known as flaons. Local bakeries are also renowned for a number of other traditional pastries and sweets, like mantecadas, prepared in the ancient way. History Municipal charter of Morella (1233). Prehistoric remains in the area include cave paintings in Morella la Vella and Bronze Age graves at Hostal Nou. The Greeks established a treasury at Morella, but then the area became the scene of conflict between the Carthaginians and the Roman Empire during the Punic Wars. Eventually the town was Romanized and became part of the province of Tarragona. The Visigoths populated the city in two different epochs, there are ruins of a Visigoth village in the site of Mas Sabater-Cantera de la Parreta de Morella. There are the remains of a building from the 7th century, which according to the archaeologists could have been twelve meters high and maybe it was a noble building or maybe of religious use according to Ramiro P√©rez, one of the directors of the excavation. The Moors took the town in 714, naming it Maurela. El Cid is reputed to have rebuilt the castle which dominates the town and in 1084 he is supposed to have fought in the service of Yusuf al-Mu'taman ibn Hud and defeated Sancho Ram√≠rez of Aragon at the Battle of Morella. In 1117, Sancho captured Morella, but it was recaptured by the Moors and only finally subdued by Blasco de Alagon in 1232. Following Blasco's death in 1239, James I of Aragon established a royal garrison in the city and awarded the inhabitants the title of \\"Faithful\\". Morella sided with Philip V during the War of the Spanish Succession in the early eighteenth century and became the centre of a military and political district. During the Napoleonic Wars, the citizens rose up against the invading forces and the town was finally captured for Spain in 1813 by Francisco Javier de El√≠o. In the Carlist Wars of the nineteenth century Morella became the headquarters of the forces of Ramon Cabrera. The town was captured by forces of General Franco in April 1938, towards the end of the Spanish Civil War. Republican guerillas held out in the surrounding mountains until 1956. In the 1960s and 70s many people left the town for work opportunities in the cities and many of the local small industries died, but a slow revitalization has taken place since the transition of Spain to democracy. Sexenni Dance of Gitanetes, Sexenni 2012. Morella In the late seventeenth century, Morella was severely affected by the plague. After twenty years of suffering, the citizens brought a statue of the Virgin Mary from the Sanctuary of Vallivana, away, at the feet of the Serra de Vallivana range, and processed it through the streets. It is said that the plague disappeared from the city and, to remember this, every six years the Sexenni festival takes place for nine days in late August. The virgin is carried in procession and the traditional town guilds perform ancient dances in her honour. The festivities in 2006 were the first of the 21st century. Municipal area Denes of Morella Morella's municipal area is divided into subdivisions known since ancient times as Dena. These are: La Vespa, Els Castellons, Dena Primera del Riu, Dena Segona del Riu, La Font d'en Torres, Herbeset, Els Llivis, Morella la Vella, El Coll i el Moll, La Pobla d'Alcolea, Dena de la Roca, Muixacre, Herbeset, Xiva de Morella, Hortells and Vallivana. Geography Morella occupies a strategic position between the plains of the river Ebro to the north west and the coastal plains of Valencia and Castellon. Access from the north west lies through the passes of Torre Mir√≥ and Querol . The old town is completely enclosed by of ancient stone walls, pierced at seven points by gates or portals. The river Bergantes skirts the southern boundaries of the town as it descends towards the Guadalope which ultimately joins the Ebro. The climate is high mountain Mediterranean, with cool summers and cold winters with frequent frosts and heavy snow. During the winter months the north east mistral, which often blows in this area, causes wind chill factors of as much as -20 ¬∞C. Today Morella is now a tourist destination, with many historic buildings, hotels and restaurants. It is listed as one of the most beautiful towns in Spain. Some of the top sights to see in Morella are the Castillo de Morella (Morella Castle), the aqueduct, La Iglesia de Santa Mar√≠a (Saint Mary‚Äôs Church), Convento de San Francesc (St. Francis‚Äô Convent) both in Gothic style, the Morella Museo Temps de Dinosaures (Time of Dinosaurs Museum Morella), and the Visigoth settlement from the 7th century (Mas Sabater- Cantera laParreta). Although not as important as in the past, wool and woollen goods still plays a part in the local economy. One of its most famous products is the Morella blanket, which has a unique design, with a range of colour combinations and horizontal stripes. Agriculture, especially poultry and pig production are important in the surrounding area with craft products and highly valued black truffles which are traded at seasonal markets during the winter.

Early years Baligh Abdel Hamid Hamdi Morsi was born on 7 October 1931 in the Shubra district of Cairo. His father was a professor of physics at King Fuad I University (now Cairo University). He learned to play the violin at age nine, and the oud two or three years later. He took music lessons with a variety of teachers throughout childhood and teenage years. He became a professional musician in 1954 at age 22. Immediately prior to that, he had been a law student, and he chose to not complete the studies for the law degree. He started his musician career as singer. But very soon he turned to composing, and his compositions got good acceptance in the mid-1950s. In the late 1950s, the then-famous Umm Kulthum sang his composition \\"Hob Eih\\" and it was a hit. Some other of Baligh Hamdi's early compositional successes include \\"Why no\\", sung by Faydah Kamel, the song \\"Ma Thbinish Be Al Shakl Dah (Don't love me like that)\\" by Fayza Ahmed and the song \\"Tkhounoh ([How do you] Betray [my heart])\\" by Abdel Halim Hafez. For the next two decades he was one of the most popular, successful, and productive composers in the Arab world. Contribution to Arab music Baligh Hamdi frequently said that he drew upon musical ideas and aesthetics in Egyptian folk melodies and rhythms in composing his songs. He also drew on ideas that were floating around in the contemporary music of his time. His sound has a classical flavor due to the heavy use of the string orchestra. But he also made some use of electronic keyboards and guitars in harmony with the strings, or alternating with the strings, in many songs. His best work is published as recordings under the name of the singer. The singers include Umm Kulthum, Abdel Halim Hafez, Shadia, Layla Murad, Najat Al Saghira, Fayza Ahmed, Warda (whom he was married to for a decade), Sabah (Sabah married seven times, and he was one of her husbands), and other singers.

Queiroz was responsible for investigations leading to imprisonment of the former mayor of S√£o Paulo, Paulo Maluf. He was a key figure in two investigations, in 2005 and 2007, into corruption scandals in Brazilian football, the latter against Boris Berezovsky's MSI group for money laundering in Corinthians. From 2004 to July 2008 Quieroz led Operation Satiagraha, a major operation into misuse of public funds, money laundering and corruption, leading to the arrest of the banker Daniel Dantas and several other prominent figures, including Celso Pitta, another former mayor of S√£o Paulo. Queiroz is a well-known but controversial figure in Brazil. While he has been frequently praised as a lone fighter for truth and justice in a corrupt system, he has also been criticised and investigated for going beyond his authority in the way he conducts his investigations. On April 13, 2009, Protogenes Queiroz was suspended indefinitely from the Federal Police for engaging in political activity. Queiroz is now officially affiliated to the PCdoB (Communist Party of Brazil), and has declared that he will run for congress in 2010. Operation Satiagraha For nearly four years (2004‚Äì2008), Queiroz led Operation Satiagraha, a Brazilian federal police investigation into misuse of public funds, corruption and money laundering. Satiagraha resulted in the arrest on July 8, 2008 of several bankers, bank directors and investors. The most high-profile figure investigated in Satiagraha was the banker Daniel Dantas. Dantas was arrested twice by Queiroz in early July 2008 on charges of money laundering and tax evasion (on the second occasion Queiroz handcuffed Dantas personally) but each time released almost immediately. The President of the Supreme Court Gilmar Mendes gave Dantas two habeas corpus in less than two days. Daniel Dantas was finally convicted to ten years' imprisonment in December 2008 for attempting to bribe a police officer. In an interview the Procurator of the Republic, Rodrigo de Grandis, stated that the purpose of Satiagraha was to investigate two distinct criminal operations, one of which was led by Dantas. Both of these operations focused on crimes in the financial market. Queiroz said that the objective of Satiagraha was to \\"combat a pernicious situation for our country. We were shocked by the scale of the two organisations, the level of intimidation and their power to corrupt.\\" In mid July 2008, Queiroz was removed from Operation Satiagraha by Luiz Fernando Corr√™a, the head of Federal Police, for breaking the chain of command by not informing his superiors of the involvement of secret service agents. At the time that Queiroz left Operation Satiagraha, President Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva called unsuccessfully for Quieroz to be reinstated to the case. Following the removal of Queiroz from the Operation, he was investigated for collaborating with members of the Brazilian secret service, ABIN, in the use of allegedly illegal telephone taps.

Non-believing Jews in Thessalonica stirred up a riot and Jason was arrested when the city authorities could not locate Paul nor Silas, and was made to post bail. Paul referred to Jason, Lucius and Sosipater as his \\"countrymen\\" () in Romans 16:21, which has led some to call him \\"Jason of Tarsus\\" (since Paul was from Tarsus).

Born in Tarsus, he was appointed Bishop of Tarsus by the Apostle Paul. With the apostle Sosipater he traveled to the island of Corfu, where they built a church in honor of the Apostle Stephen the Protomartyr and converted many pagans to the Christian faith. Seeing this, the king of Corfu threw them into prison where they converted seven other prisoners to the Christian faith: Saturninus, Jakischolus, Faustianus, Januarius, Marsalius, Euphrasius and Mammius. The king had those seven put to death for their faith in boiling pitch. The king's daughter, the virgin Cercyra, having watched these holy apostles being tortured and turned to the Christian faith, distributed all her jewels to the poor. The king became angry and put her in prison, yet she would not deny Christ. So he had the prison burned, but she remained unharmed. Many people were baptized upon seeing this miracle. He then had her killed with arrows while tied to a tree. Many believers fled to a nearby island to get away from the enraged king, but as he chased them, his boat sank. The new king embraced the Christian faith and in baptism received the name Sebastian. From then on Sosipater and Jason freely preached the Gospel and built up the Church in Corfu until a very old age, when they gave up their souls to God.Apostle Jason, of the Seventy and those with him, April 28 (OCA)  See also  * Acts 17 * First Epistle to the Thessalonians * Sosipater * Lucius of Cyrene * Nikolai Velimirovic, The Prologue of Ohrid External links *Apostle Jason of the Seventy, January 4 (OCA) *Jason & Sosipater the Apostles of the 70 & their Companions (GOARCH) *Analecta Bollandiana *Catholic Online: Jason of Tarsus References Seventy disciples Christian saints from the New Testament Saints from Roman Anatolia 1st-century bishops People from Tarsus, Mersin People in Acts of the Apostles People in the Pauline epistles Roman-era Jews ","title":"Jason of Thessalonica"},{"id":"21152327","text":"John Joseph DiGilio Sr. also known as \\"Johnny Dee\\", (December 5, 1932 Bayonne, New Jersey‚Äì May 27, 1988 Carlstadt, New Jersey), was a New Jersey mobster with the Genovese crime family who became a powerful organized crime leader in the New Jersey faction. Biography A former professional boxer and boatman on a tug boat, DiGilio had an athletic build with muscular shoulders. He was described as possessing an aura of self-confidence. John DiGilio was born to first generation Italian-American immigrants and was the oldest of eight siblings; Theresa, Joseph, Judith, Frances, Anthony, Antionette and Frank DiGilio. To avoid confusion regarding Leonard (Lenny) Digilio, public records show Leonard was never adopted by John Digilio. Leonard changed his name from Leonard Brugnola to Leonard DiGilio when he was 25 years old. Public records regarding Leonard's name change can be found in the County of Sullivan signed by the Honorable Louis B. Scheinman. Boxing record In 1950, DiGilio won the New York Daily News Golden Gloves 126 lb (57 kilos) Sub-Novice Championships by defeating Manuel Vinho of the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation. While a welterweight boxer, DiGilio trained at the Bayonne Police Department Police Athletic League in New Jersey. On October 16, 1950, DiGilio won his first professional boxing match against Tony Loti in Providence, Rhode Island. On April 8, 1954 in Newark, New Jersey, DiGilio defeated Felix Redondo for the New Jersey State Lightweight Title. On June 28, 1954 Cisco Andrade beat DiGilio by knockout at St. Nicholas Rink in New York City, New York in 2 minutes and 8 seconds. On November 18, 1955, while fighting Tommy Barto at Madison Square Garden in Manhattan, the referee stopped the fight and declared DiGilio the winner. On June 15, 1956, again at Madison Square Garden, DiGilio knocked down Johnny Busso in 1:39 minutes during the 4th round. However, the referee later stopped the fight due to cuts over DiGilio's eyes and gave the victory to Busso. On February 11, 1958 in Miami Beach, Florida, DiGilio lost, being knocked down in the 4th, 5th and 6th rounds. On March 29, 1958, DiGilio lost to Stefan Redl in Paterson, New Jersey for the New Jersey State Welterweight Championship. In total, DiGilio boxed 231 rounds, won 28 matches, lost ten matches, and was knocked out in three matches. DiGilio stood at 5 foot 7 inches tall and, during his professional boxing career, he weighed in between 147 and 154 pounds (67 to 70 kilos). Involvement in organized crime He lived in Bayonne, New Jersey. As a young man, DiGilio became involved in illegal gambling, loansharking, labor racketeering and extortion in the Genovese family. During the 1950s, under family boss Vito Genovese, DiGilio became a made man, or full family member. He later worked for boss Frank Tieri and Benny Malangone. In 1968, DiGilio was indicted on extortion charges. DiGilio had made two $1,000 usurious loans in 1966 and 1967 to a New Jersey man who, after paying $7,400 interest, refused to pay anything else. The victim then receive a threatening call from DiGilio, which he recorded. DiGilio was able to prove that the voice print of the recording did not match his own voice, and was acquitted in 1970.\\"Dave Friedland as John DiGilio‚Äôs lawyer\\" Hudson County Facts May 15th, 2010 In the mid-1970s, Digilio became secretary-treasurer of International Longshoremen's Association Local 1588 in Bayonne, New Jersey, a union local under Genovese control since the 1960s.\\"NYPD Commish Working to Reform Mobbed-Up NJ Local\\" Waterfront Commission Digilio used his position to extort payments from shipping companies in exchange for smooth labor relations. In 1986, Fortune Magazine named DiGilio as number 39 on its list of the 50 most powerful Cosa Nostra bosses in the United States. As DiGilio's criminal activities attracted more law enforcement attention, he started displaying bizarre conduct. Law enforcement was unsure if the activities were genuine or just a ruse. Racketeering trial and disappearance In 1988, DiGilio and three other Genovese mobsters were indicted on federal racketeering charges. Defying his family bosses, DiGilio refused to retain a lawyer and instead mounted his own defense at the trial. During the trial, while arguing with the prosecuting attorney, DiGilio suffered a heart attack, but quickly recovered. While making his closing arguments, DiGilio dismissed Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) recordings of him as \\"locker room talk\\" and then dumped hundreds of cassette tapes into a garbage pail. On April 17, 1988, DiGilio was acquitted of racketeering, but the other defendants were convicted.\\"Reputed mobster acquitted by jury\\" New York Times April 17, 1988 The Genovese hierarchy was furious with DiGilio; they blamed him for the conviction of the other three men. What especially galled the leadership was that Donald Carson, one of the convicted defendants, was then forced to resign his position as secretary- treasurer of Local 1588. A Gambino crime family mobster replaced Carson at the local, effectively eliminating the Genovese family's major source of labor racketeering revenue. Shortly after DiGilio's trial ended, his wife Ellen reported him missing to police. On May 26, 1988, DiGilio's body, with five bullet wounds to the head, was discovered floating in a bag on the Hackensack River near Carlstadt, New Jersey.\\"Body of a reputed mobster is found in a bag in river\\" New York Times May 27, 1988 In 1998, Genovese mobster Louis Auricchio, the brother-in-law of New Jersey senator John A.

He is probably the same person as Sopater mentioned in Acts 20:4. In church tradition, he is known as Sosipater of Iconium, and is numbered among the Seventy Apostles. St. Sosipater's feast days are on April 28 (Slavic tradition), or 29 (Greek tradition) with St. Jason; November 10 with saints Erastus, Olympas, Herodian, Quartus and Tertius; and January 4 with the Seventy. According to Latin tradition, the disciple of St Paul the Apostle died on the 25th of June in Beroea. Legend Sosipater was born in Achaea. According to legend, he was Bishop in Iconium (prior to the Apostle Tertius) by his relative the Apostle Paul. With the Apostle Jason he traveled to the island of Corfu where they built a church in honor of the Apostle Stephen the Protomartyr and converted many pagans to the Christian faith. Seeing this, the governor of Corfu threw them into prison where they converted seven other prisoners to the Christian faith: Saturninus, Jakischolus, Faustianus, Januarius, Marsalius, Euphrasius and Mammius, known as the Seven Robbers. The governor had those seven put to death by boiling pitch for their faith. The governor's daughter, the virgin , having watched these holy apostles being tortured and turned to the Christian faith, distributed all her jewels to the poor. The governor became angry and put her in prison, yet she would not deny Christ. So he had the prison burned, but she remained unharmed. Many people were baptized upon seeing this miracle. He then had her killed with arrows while tied to a tree. Many believers fled to a nearby island to get away from the enraged governor, but as he chased them his boat sank. The new governor embraced the Christian faith and in baptism received the name Sebastian. From then on Sts. Sosipater and Jason freely preached the Gospel and built up the Church in Corfu until a very old age, when they gave up their souls to God.

It differs from ice sledge hockey, which was developed instead for athletes with a physical disability. Special hockey is sometimes known as adaptive hockey, and emphasizes fun, teamwork, social interaction, and providing an environment adapted to the ability of the participant. It provides an opportunity to be accepted and part of a team, that otherwise would not exist. Special hockey programs are open to males and females of all ages, not just children. Special hockey uses standard ice hockey equipment, has modified ice hockey rules such as no offside, icing, or penalties, and is a non-contact sport without scores and standings. The sport is organized by volunteers and nonprofit organizations, and relies on sponsorships, and fundraising, for the majority of costs. Programs originated in Canada and the United States. North American clubs are affiliated with Canadian Special Hockey Association, and the American Special Hockey Association, which are in turn affiliated with Hockey Canada and USA Hockey respectively.

It is constructed in the same fashion as the Global Hunger Index (GHI) 2008 and was calculated for 17 states in India, covering more than 95 percent of the population. The ISHI was developed by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and presented for the first time 2008 in conjunction with the Non-Governmental Organization Welthungerhilfe and the Department of Economics, University of California.  Background  Despite the good economic performance, with over 200 million people who are food insecure, India is home to the largest number of hungry people in the world. In the ranking of the Global Hunger Index 2017 it covers position 100 out of 119 ranked countries and has an ‚Äúserious‚Äú (31.4) food security situation.http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/ishi08.pdf The major problem in the country is the high prevalence of underweight children under five, which is a result of low nutrition and educational status of women. While there has been attention to hunger and undernourishment at the central level, within India's political system, states are important political units with regard to the planning and execution of development programs. Thus unpacking the hunger index at the level of the federal states is an important tool to build awareness of the disparities in hunger among them. In addition, the variability of the relative contribution of the underlying components of the hunger index across the different Indian states can help to stimulate the discussion about the drivers of hunger in different state contexts. Indicators and underlying data The ISHI is constructed in the same fashion as the Global Hunger Index which follows a multidimensional approach to measuring hunger and malnutrition. It combines three equally weighted indicators: # the proportion of undernourished as a percentage of the population (reflecting the share of the population with insufficient dietary intake); # the prevalence of underweight children under the age of five (indicating the proportion of children suffering from weight loss and / or reduced growth); and # the mortality rate of children under the age of five (partially reflecting the fatal synergy between dietary intake and unhealthy environments). The ISHI uses two data sources for the estimation of the Indian state level: These are the first rounds of the National Family Health Survey (2005‚Äì2006) for India and the National Sample Survey data from 2004 to 2005. It is calculated and presented for 17 major states, covering 95 percent of the country's population. While the National Family Health Survey has a large enough sample size to yield representative estimates of the child underweight and mortality rates even for the smaller states and union territories in the country, the sample size of the National Sample Survey is insufficient for estimating undernourishment rates in these places. Therefore, the ISHI restricts the sample to those states for which it yields precise states level estimates.  Key findings  *ISHI 2008 scores for Indian states range from 13.6 (‚Äúserious‚Äù) for Punjab to 30.9 (‚Äúextremely alarming‚Äù) for Madhya Pradesh, indicating substantial variability among states in India. Punjab is ranked 34th when compared to the GHI 2008 worldwide country ranking, while Madhya Pradesh is ranked 82nd. In this state more people suffer from hunger than in Ethiopia or Sudan. 60 percent of the children are undernourished. *All 17 states have ISHI scores that are well above the ‚Äúlow‚Äù and ‚Äúmoderate‚Äù hunger categories. Twelve of the 17 states fall into the ‚Äúalarming‚Äù category, and one into the ‚Äúextremely alarming‚Äù category. *ISHI scores are closely aligned with poverty, but there is little association with state level economic growth. High levels of hunger are seen in states that are performing well from an economic perspective. *Inclusive economic growth and targeted strategies to ensure food sufficiency reduce child mortality and improve child nutrition are urgent priorities for all states in India.

They are mentioned in Julius Caesar's Bellum Gallicum. They gave their name to the comt√© of Anjou, called Andegavia in medieval Latin.For instance, in the Gesta consulum Andegavorum and Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae. The Count of Anjou was in Latin Comes Andegavorum.  Name  They are mentioned as Andecaui by Pliny (1st c. AD),Pliny. Naturalis Historia, 4:107 as Andecavi by Tacitus (early 2nd c. AD),Tacitus. Annales, 3:41. as AÃìnd√≠kauoi (·ºàŒΩŒ¥ŒØŒ∫Œ±œÖŒøŒπ) by Ptolemy (2nd c. AD),Ptolemy. Ge≈çgraphik·∏ï Hyph·∏ógƒìsis, 2:8:8 and as Andicavos by Orosius (early 5th c. AD).Orosius. Historiae Adversus Paganos, 6:8:7, entry 3008. The etymology of the name Andecavi is uncertain. Ande- is a Gaulish intensifying suffix translated as 'very', but the meaning of the second part, -cavi, is unclear. It could be related to Proto-Celtic *kuwo ('hollow'; compare with Old Irish c√∫a, 'hollow, cavity'; Welsh keu, 'hollow, closed'; Old Breton cau, 'closed, covered'), leading to the meaning 'those of the big hollow'. Lambert has also suggested a connection with Proto-Celtic *kawaro- ('hero, champion'; compare with Old Irish cuar 'hero', Mid. Welsh cawr 'giant'). The city of Angers, attested as civitas Andecavorum around 400 CE ('civitas of the Andecavi', Andegavis in 861‚Äì882, Angieus in 1127), and the region of Anjou, attested as pago Andegavinse in 767 (in Andecavo in 797, Anjau ca. 1071‚Äì1127), are named after the Gallic tribe. Geography Andecavi stater. The territory of the Andecavi roughly corresponded with the diocese of Angers, Anjou, in the department Maine-et-Loire in present-day France. Although Caesar locates the Andes \\"near the Ocean\\", they held no coast and were located inland along the Loire river.Michel Rambaud, C. Iulius Caesar De Bello Gallico, secundus tertiusque libri, text, introduction and commentary (Paris 1965), p. 144, note to 7.2. History In Book 3 of the Bellum Gallicum, Caesar says that the Andes provided winterquarters for Publius Crassus after his mission into Armorica, which brought several Gallic polities into relations with Rome.Caesar, Bellum Gallicum 2.33 and 3.7. Over the winter of 57‚Äì56 BC, the Romans built a fleet on the Loire under the command of Decimus Brutus, presumably in preparation for an invasion of Britannia, but which was instead called into action against the Veneti when Armorican objections were raised. The Andes, led by Dumnacus, played a significant role in the continuing war against Rome after the defeat of Vercingetorix at Alesia. Dumnacus's efforts are recounted by Aulus Hirtius in his continuation of the Bellum Gallicum (Book 8), which covers the two years of the war after Caesar had declared his mission accomplished. Dumnacus lay siege to Limonum (present-day Poitiers), an oppidum of the Pictones, and engaged without success the Roman relief army under the command of Gaius Caninius Rebilus. When additional Roman forces arrived on the scene, Dumnacus was forced to lift the siege and retreat. The army of the Andes was pursued by the Romans and suffered heavy casualties. In a decisive battle the following day, the Romans killed some 12,000 men. Dumnacus escaped, and when Armorica surrendered, he went into self-imposed exile.Aulus Hirtius, Bellum Gallicum 8.26‚Äì31.

He is best known for his exclusion from the American 4 √ó 100 relay team at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. The 2-man substitution triggered widespread speculation that he and Marty Glickman‚Äîthe only two Jews on the U.S. track team‚Äîwere excluded because U.S. Olympic Committee chairman Avery Brundage wanted to avoid embarrassing Adolf Hitler by having two Jewish athletes win gold medals. Stoller vowed at the time that he would never run again, but he returned in 1937 to win both the Big Ten Conference and NCAA championships in the 100-yard dash. After graduating from the University of Michigan in 1937, Stoller briefly went into a singing and acting career as \\"Singin' Sammy Stoller.\\" Champion sprinter =Competition with Jesse Owens= A native of Cincinnati, Ohio where he attended Hughes High School, Stoller was one of the best sprinters the state had ever produced, but he had the misfortune of attending high school in Ohio at the same time as Jesse Owens. The two raced on rival teams in high school, and Owens always won, except once. They continued as rivals in college, Owens running for Ohio State and Stoller for Michigan. They competed against each other more than twenty times, and although Owens typically finished first, one writer noted: \\"As often as not, only a breather separated them.\\" Stoller reportedly once noted that he had seen \\"perhaps more of Jesse Owens' back than anybody else.\\" He also joked, \\"I'm the fellow you see in the movies of Jesse's foot races.\\" Despite his typical role as second-place finisher to Owens, Stoller and Owens became friends. Stoller recalled that, at the 1936 Olympic tryouts, Owens pushed him along. In the 100-meters final, Stoller was trailing badly, when Owens turned around and yelled, \\"Come on, Sammy, step on it!\\" Stoller recalled, \\"I never knew a greater fellow than Jesse. After the race he shook my hand and said, 'I was hoping you would make it and I couldn't help pulling. I hope I didn't bother you.'\\" =Accomplishments prior to 1936 Olympics= Stoller worked his way through the University of Michigan by washing dishes and sweeping floors at a fraternity house. During the 1936 track season, Stoller proved himself to be one of America's top sprinters and long jumpers. At the Big Ten championship in March 1936, Stoller tied the world indoor record in the 60-yard dash with a time of 6.1 seconds. Stoller was also one of the USA's top long-jumpers in 1936 with a 23-foot, 10-inch jump. Though he failed to make the Olympic team as a long jumper, he qualified for the Olympic team as a member of the 4 √ó 100 meter relay team along with Jesse Owens, Frank Wykoff, Marty Glickman, and Foy Draper. =1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin= Exclusion of Stoller and Glickman Newspaper announcement in July 1936 that Stoller (far left) and Glickman have qualified for the 4 x 100 relay team On the morning that the 4 x 100 relay competition began, U.S. track coach Lawson Robertson called a meeting and informed Stoller and Glickman that they had been pulled from the event and that they would be replaced by Owens and Ralph Metcalfe. Glickman later recalled that all the sprinters were called into a special meeting by Robertson and his assistant, Dean Cromwell. \\"We were informed by the coaches that the Germans were hiding their best sprinters to make an all-out effort to win the 400-meter relay, and consequently, Jesse Owens and Ralph Metcalfe were to replace Stoller and me.\\" Stoller was completely stunned and did not say a word at the meeting. Glickman responded by immediately questioning the premise, challenging Robertson by asserting \\"Coach, you can't hide world-class sprinters.\\" Jesse Owens spoke in favor of letting Stoller and Glickman run, saying, \\"Coach, I've won my 3 gold medals. I'm tired. I've had it. Let Marty and Sam run, they deserve it.\\" When Owens spoke, assistant coach Cromwell told him, \\"You'll do as you're told.\\" The American team, without Stoller and Glickman, won the race by 12 yards in a new world-record time. Stoller declined to watch the finals and declared after the Olympics that he would \\"never run again.\\" Controversy surrounding the decision Glickman immediately went public with a charge that the decision to pull him and Stoller was the product of \\"politics.\\" After the heats failed to reveal Germany's hidden sprinters, Glickman told the press in Berlin, \\"The heats failed to show the necessity for shaking up the line-up after Stoller and myself long practiced the stick-work. We did not know until this morning's conference with Head Coach Robertson just who would run. It looks like politics to us.\\" Glickman charged that \\"this talk about the Germans and the Dutch being so tough looks like a false alarm on the basis of today's trials.\\" Stoller, who turned 21 on the day of the event, did not appear at the stadium, leading Glickman to say: \\"A fine present for Sam, wasn't it?\\" Robertson took responsibility for the decision and sharply denied that any prejudice was involved. He insisted his sole purpose was to run the best available quartet and noted that the team's world-record performance was the best answer to his critics. However, Robertson's decision and Glickman's public comments led to a decades-long controversy over whether Stoller and Glickman were pulled to avoid embarrassing the German hosts of the Olympics. One wire service story from Berlin noted: \\"Leaving of Two Jewish Boys Out of 400 Race Brings Repercussions.\\" Columnist Braven Dyer noted that Robertson's decision had been \\"panned\\" and had \\"angered a lot of folks\\" when he \\"jerked\\" Stoller and Glickman from the team. Dyer asserted that \\"Glickman and Stoller had good reason to believe that when they qualified to represent the United States in the baton-passing event that nothing less than physical deterioration would prevent them from running. Apparently the boys were in good shape. Their conduct had offended no member of the brass hat brigade.\\" And when the U.S. team arrived in New York, press accounts indicated that \\"an internal battle\\" loomed in the Olympic organization over \\"the dropping of two Jewish sprinters, Sam Stoller and Marty Glickman.\\" Historical perspective on the exclusion In his official report after the 1936 Olympics, Avery Brundage rejected the suggestion that Stoller and Glickman had been excluded due to their religion. He wrote, \\"An erroneous report was circulated that two athletes had been dropped from the American relay team because of their religion. This report was absurd.\\" And U.S. Coach Robertson asserted that his decision was motivated solely by putting together the strongest possible relay team. Yet, the debate and controversy continued for more than 60 years. In 2001, the Los Angeles Times noted that theories abound, though \\"historians and authors have never been able to provide a definitive answer.\\" Critics of the exclusion pointed to the following as alleged evidence of appeasement or anti- Semitism: * Critics noted that the stated premise of the exclusion, the presence of powerful German sprinters in hiding, was \\"preposterous.\\" An investigation in 1998 by the Los Angeles Times rebutted the coaches' claim that more speed was needed and concluded that \\"history points to something darker.\\" The Times found no evidence to support the claim that the Germans were \\"sandbagging some super sprinters for the race\\" and noted that \\"reports have persisted almost from the moment of the change that religion was behind it.\\" * Stoller and Glickman were the only two Jews on the 66-person U.S. track team and the only two healthy team members who were not permitted to compete in Berlin. 400 m runner Hal Smallwood also did not compete, but he had undergone an appendectomy. * Four or five days before the race, the U.S. coaches held a race to determine the running order. In that race, according to the 1972 book, All That Glitters Is Not Gold, Stoller finished first, Glickman second and Draper third. Yet, Stoller and Glickman were excluded instead of Draper. * In addition to speed, coordination and practice in passing the baton was key in a 400-meter relay. The original foursome, including Stoller and Glickman, had spent considerable time practicing their baton passes. * Though he was not able to produce proof, Glickman said years later that he had learned that Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels had told Brundage that Hitler \\"would be very displeased if Jews were to race in 'his' Olympic games,\\" and that Brundage then passed the message as an order to the U.S. track coaches. * In 1996, the U.S. Holocaust Museum sponsored a special exhibit on the 1936 Nazi Olympics focusing on the exclusion of Stoller and Glickman. At the time, Glickman asserted that Avery Brundage was \\"an American Nazi\\" who wanted to spare Hitler and his entourage the embarrassment of seeing Jews receiving medals on the podium. Glickman also noted that Brundage was an organizer, founder and officer of the America First Committee and that assistant track coach Dean Cromwell was also a member of the America First Committee in California. * In April 2000, The Jerusalem Report conducted an investigation of the incident and concluded: \\"Only years later did the reason for the switch become clear: The American team had buckled under to Nazi pressure to keep Jews out of the games.\\" * After the Nazis banned Jews from competing in German sports in 1934, American Olympic Committee chairman Avery Brundage \\"made a brief, Nazi-controlled inspection of Germany and declared that the country's Jews were being allowed to participate.\\" * In an American Olympic Committee pamphlet, Brundage argued that American athletes should not involve themselves in \\"the present Jew-Nazi altercation.\\" * When a campaign developed seeking an American boycott of the Berlin Olympics, Brundage charged that the effort was part of a \\"Jewish-Communist conspiracy.\\" * Robertson's claim that he was motivated by a wish to put together the strongest possible team appears questionable in the light of his neglect of the 4 √ó 400 m relay team. He omitted Archie Williams who won the 400 m, James LuValle who came third, and Glenn Hardin who won the 400 m hurdles, and stuck with the original quartet, who went on to be beaten by Great Britain.Wallechinsky, David (2004). The Complete Book of the Summer Olympics, Toronto: Sport Classic Books. =Big Ten and NCAA championships in 1937= \\"Speedy Sammy Stoller cracks tape\\" at dual meet against Cal, April 1937 After vowing in 1936 never to run again, Stoller recanted and chose to compete in the 1937 track season. Newspapers predicted that, with Jesse Owens turning professional, Stoller would find his place in the limelight. An Associated Press story in February 1937 noted: > \\"Fleet Sammy Stoller has discarded that second fiddle. The University of > Michigan ace sprinter, until now generally finding the track summaries in > sprints reading: 'Second, Stoller,' has darted ahead, at this date, of the > country's leading sprinters.\\" The press observed that, in a career \\"heretofore frustrated alone by Owens,\\" 1937 was Stoller's \\"bid for national recognition.\\" In February 1937, Stoller beat a fast field in the 50-yard dash at the Boston meet, finishing ahead of Ben Johnson of Columbia, Glickman and Canadian star Sam Richardson. And in April 1937, Stoller ran a 9.5 second 100-yard dash at Los Angeles. He dominated the 100-yard dash through the 1937 track season, winning both the Big Ten and NCAA championships. His best official time in 1937 was 9.6, though he was unofficially timed at 9.4. At the end of the 1937 season, Stoller was picked as an All-American. Acting career After winning the 100-yard championship, Stoller announced that he intended to pursue a career as \\"a crooner Movie Star\\" and became known as \\"Singin' Sammy Stoller.\\" Screen comedian Joe E. Brown was instrumental in getting Stoller bit parts in several 1937 motion pictures, and registration with the Screen Actors Guild. His first part was in a crowd scene at a New York cafe in Mae West's Every Day's a Holiday. He appeared as a singer and actor in several Hollywood motion pictures. Hollywood reporter Bill Henry wrote in November 1937: > \\"Sam, who is something of a singer, decided to stay out here after the > National Intercollegiates which finished his rah-rah sprint career last > June. Joe E. Brown introduced him to a couple of people and Sam talked and > sung over half the radios in California and has appeared in nine ‚Äî count 'em > ‚Äî pictures. They are 'Navy Blue and Gold,' 'Rosalie,' 'Tom Sawyer,' 'Nothing > Sacred,' 'She's Got That Swing,' 'The Thrill of a Lifetime,' 'Taking the > Town,' 'Blossoms Broadway,' and 'Every Day's a Holiday.' In five months Sam > has dashed from one studio to another to appear in these super-colossals ‚Äî > and not a blamed one of 'em has been released yet.\\" In January 1938, Louella Parsons wrote about Stoller in her Hollywood column. She noted that, although the Michigan track star had thus far rated only \\"bit\\" parts, the stars were being photographed with him. \\"So far Sammy's been photographed with Fredric March, Carole Lombard, Errol Flynn, Bette Davis and many others and now all his pals back east who see the pictures think he's a big shot, making thousands in the movies and chumming with the stars. One of his pals went so far as to borrow $1,000 from him ‚Äî and the most Sammy has earned is $10 per day ‚Äî some days!\\" In 1938, Stoller participated in a two- month exhibition tour of the Philippine Islands as part of a four-man team competing under the name, The Southern California Sportsmen's Association. In 1940, columnist Pat Robinson commented on Stoller's extraordinary year: > \\"Sammy Stoller ...

In 1998, U.S. Olympic Committee Chairman William Hybl sought to remedy the past wrong and awarded the USOC's first Gen. Douglas MacArthur medals to Stoller (posthumously) and Glickman. Hybl said at the time, \\"We regret this injustice and we feel it was an injustice. We're not only atoning for this but recognizing two great individuals.\\" In 2007, Stoller was posthumously awarded the \\"Pillar of Achievement\\" award by the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame.

When the ecology of plants took precedence over knowledge of 'the natural orders' in examinations, Clarke, supported by the eminent British ecologist Arthur George Tansley, created a new series of beds in her garden to replicate examples of British habitats, such as salt marsh and pebble beach. The support of William Hales, curator of Chelsea Physic Garden from 1899-1937 to Clarke is recorded in her publication, The Botany Gardens Of The James Allen's Girls' School, Dulwich: Their History And Organisation, published by the London Board of Education.Clarke 1922 Clarke describes the plants at the edge of the pond: Clarke goes on to say that: 'The pond has proved a great success and of the utmost value in our lessons.'Clarke 1922: 24 Significantly, for contemporary botanical educators, Clarke also stated, in a book published posthumously, that the gardens 'have become, in many cases, out-of-door laboratories, and the work indoors and out of doors is one.'Clarke 1935: vii Clarke communicated with representatives of the professional botanical community and worked hard to be visible in the wider scientific milieu of her time.

They are so ubiquitous that it is rare that an electrical product does not include at least one for some purpose.  Energy storage  Energy storage capacitor for camera flash in a vintage Polaroid A capacitor can store electric energy when it is connected to its charging circuit. And when it is disconnected from its charging circuit, it can dissipate that stored energy, so it can be used like a temporary battery. Capacitors are commonly used in electronic devices to maintain power supply while batteries are being changed. (This prevents loss of information in volatile memory.) Conventional electrostatic capacitors provide less than 360 joules per kilogram of energy density, while capacitors using developing technology can provide more than 2.52 kilojoules per kilogram.Next-gen car solution? Scientists expand uses for electrostatic capacitor In car audio systems, large capacitors store energy for the amplifier to use on demand. An uninterruptible power supply (UPS) can be equipped with maintenance-free capacitors to extend service life.industrial-europe.com  Pulsed power and weapons  Groups of large, specially constructed, low-inductance high-voltage capacitors (capacitor banks) are used to supply huge pulses of current for many pulsed power applications. These include electromagnetic forming, Marx generators, pulsed lasers (especially TEA lasers), pulse forming networks, fusion research, and particle accelerators. Large capacitor banks (reservoirs) are used as energy sources for the exploding-bridgewire detonators or slapper detonators in nuclear weapons and other specialty weapons. Experimental work is under way using banks of capacitors as power sources for electromagnetic armour and electromagnetic railguns or coilguns.  Power conditioning  Reservoir capacitors are used in power supplies where they smooth the output of a full or half wave rectifier. They can also be used in charge pump circuits as the energy storage element in the generation of higher voltages than the input voltage. Capacitors are connected in parallel with the DC power circuits of most electronic devices to smooth current fluctuations for signal or control circuits. Audio equipment, for example, uses several capacitors in this way, to shunt away power line hum before it gets into the signal circuitry. The capacitors act as a local reserve for the DC power source, and bypass AC currents from the power supply. This is used in car audio applications, when a stiffening capacitor compensates for the inductance and resistance of the leads to the lead-acid car battery.  Power factor correction  In electric power distribution, capacitors are used for power factor correction. Such capacitors often come as three capacitors connected as a three phase Electrical load. Usually, the values of these capacitors are given not in farads but rather as a reactive power in volt-amperes reactive (VAr). The purpose is to counteract inductive loading from devices like Induction motor, electric motors and transmission lines to make the load appear to be mostly resistive. Individual motor or lamp loads may have capacitors for power factor correction, or larger sets of capacitors (usually with automatic switching devices) may be installed at a load center within a building or in a large utility electrical substation. In high-voltage direct current transmission systems, power factor correction capacitors may have tuning inductors to suppress harmonic currents that would otherwise be injected into the AC power system.  Suppression and coupling  Capacitors used for suppressing undesirable frequencies are sometimes called filter capacitors. They are common in electrical and electronic equipment, and cover a number of applications, such as: * Glitch removal on direct current (DC) power rails * Radio frequency interference (RFI) removal for signal or power lines entering or leaving equipment * Capacitors used after a voltage regulator to further smooth DC power supplies * Capacitors used in audio, intermediate frequency (IF) or radio frequency (RF) filters (e.g. low pass, high pass, notch, etc.) * Arc suppression, such as across the contact breaker or 'points' in a spark-ignition engine = Signal coupling = Because capacitors pass AC but block DC signals (when charged up to the applied DC voltage), they are often used to separate the AC and DC components of a signal. This method is known as AC coupling or \\"capacitive coupling\\". Here, a large value of capacitance, whose value need not be accurately controlled, but whose reactance is small at the signal frequency, is employed. = Decoupling = Ceramic X2Y¬Æ decoupling capacitors A decoupling capacitor is a capacitor used to decouple one part of a circuit from another. Noise caused by other circuit elements is shunted through the capacitor, reducing the effect they have on the rest of the circuit. It is most commonly used between the power supply and ground. An alternative name is bypass capacitor as it is used to bypass the power supply or other high impedance component of a circuit. =High-pass and low-pass filters= A high-pass filter (HPF) is an electronic filter that passes signals with a frequency higher than a certain cutoff frequency and attenuates signals with frequencies lower than the cutoff frequency. The amount of attenuation for each frequency depends on the filter design. A high-pass filter is usually modeled as a linear time-invariant system. It is sometimes called a low-cut filter or bass-cut filter.[1] High- pass filters have many uses, such as blocking DC from circuitry sensitive to non-zero average voltages or radio frequency devices. They can also be used in conjunction with a low-pass filter to produce a bandpass filter. A low-pass filter (LPF) is a filter that passes signals with a frequency lower than a selected cutoff frequency and attenuates signals with frequencies higher than the cutoff frequency. The exact frequency response of the filter depends on the filter design. The filter is sometimes called a high-cut filter, or treble-cut filter in audio applications. A low-pass filter is the complement of a high-pass filter. =Noise filters and snubbers= Heavy-duty snubber capacitor with screw terminals When an inductive circuit is opened, the current through the inductance collapses quickly, creating a large voltage across the open circuit of the switch or relay. If the inductance is large enough, the energy will generate an electric spark, causing the contact points to oxidize, deteriorate, or sometimes weld together, or destroying a solid- state switch. A snubber capacitor across the newly opened circuit creates a path for this impulse to bypass the contact points, thereby preserving their life; these were commonly found in contact breaker ignition systems, for instance. Similarly, in smaller scale circuits, the spark may not be enough to damage the switch but will still radiate undesirable radio frequency interference (RFI), which a filter capacitor absorbs. Snubber capacitors are usually employed with a low-value resistor in series, to dissipate energy and minimize RFI. Such resistor-capacitor combinations are available in a single package. Capacitors are also used in parallel to interrupt units of a high- voltage circuit breaker in order to equally distribute the voltage between these units. In this case they are called grading capacitors. In schematic diagrams, a capacitor used primarily for DC charge storage is often drawn vertically in circuit diagrams with the lower, more negative, plate drawn as an arc. The straight plate indicates the positive terminal of the device, if it is polarized (see electrolytic capacitor). DC motor suppression Ceramic disc capacitors are usually used in snubber circuits for low voltage motors for their low inductance and low cost. Switched mode power supply filtering Low ESR (equivalent series resistance) electrolytics are often required to handle the high ripple current. =Mains filtering= Mains filter capacitors are usually encapsulated wound-plastic-film types, since these deliver high voltage rating at low cost, and may be made self-healing and fusible. Mains filter capacitors are often ceramic RFI/EMI suppression capacitors. The additional safety requirements for mains filtering are: * Line to neutral capacitors are flame retardant, and in Europe are required to use class X dielectrics. * Line or neutral to earth: Must be flame retardant; also, the dielectric must be self healing and fusible. In Europe these are class Y capacitors. =Power rail filtering= Typical application circuit for a simple mains PSU, showing transformer, bridge rectifier, 78xx regulator and filter capacitors Electrolytic capacitors are usually used due to high capacity at low cost and low size. Smaller non-electrolytics may be paralleled with these to compensate for electrolytics' poor performance at high frequencies. Computers use large numbers of filter capacitors, making size an important factor. Solid tantalum and wet tantalum capacitors offer some of the best CV (capacitance/voltage) performance in some of the most volumetrically efficient packaging available. High currents and low voltages also make low equivalent series resistance (ESR) important. Solid tantalum capacitors offer low ESR versions that can often meet ESR requirements but they are not the lowest ESR option among all capacitors. Solid tantalums have an additional issue which must be addressed during the design stage. Solid tantalum capacitors must be voltage derated in all applications. A 50% voltage derating is recommended and generally accepted as the industry standard; e.g. a 50V solid tantalum capacitor should never be exposed to an actual application voltage above 25V. Solid tantalum capacitors are very reliable components if the proper care is taken and all design guidelines are carefully followed. Unfortunately, the failure mechanism for a solid tantalum capacitor is a short which will result in a violent flaring up and smoking on a PCB capable of damaging other components in close proximity as well as completely destroying the capacitor. Fortunately, most solid tantalum capacitor failures will be immediate and very evident. Once in application solid tantalum capacitor performance will improve over time and the chances of a failure due to component mis-manufacturing decrease. Wet tantalums are a type of the electrolytic capacitor, using a tantalum pellet in an electrolytic material sealed in a hermetic package. This type of tantalum capacitor does not require the same derating that a solid tantalum does and its failure mechanism is open. A 10% to 20% voltage derating curve is recommended for wet tantalums when operating from 85C to 125C. Wet tantalums are not commonly referred to as just 'electrolytics' because usually 'electrolytic' refers to aluminium electrolytics. Motor starters  A typical motor start capacitor, as can be seen by its black color and can shape In single phase squirrel cage motors, the primary winding within the motor housing is not capable of starting a rotational motion on the rotor, but is capable of sustaining one. To start the motor, a secondary winding is used in series with a non-polarized starting capacitor to introduce a lag in the sinusoidal current through the starting winding. When the secondary winding is placed at an angle with respect to the primary winding, a rotating electric field is created. The force of the rotational field is not constant, but is sufficient to start the rotor spinning. When the rotor comes close to operating speed, a centrifugal switch (or current-sensitive relay in series with the main winding) disconnects the capacitor. The start capacitor is typically mounted to the side of the motor housing. These are called capacitor-start motors, and have relatively high starting torque. There are also capacitor-run induction motors which have a permanently connected phase-shifting capacitor in series with a second winding. The motor is much like a two-phase induction motor. Motor-starting capacitors are typically non-polarized electrolytic types, while running capacitors are conventional paper or plastic film dielectric types. =Signal processing= The energy stored in capacitor can be used to represent information, either in binary form, as in DRAMs, or in analogue form, as in analog sampled filters and Charge-coupled device CCDs. Capacitors can be used in analog circuits as components of integrators or more complex filters and in negative feedback loop stabilization. Signal processing circuits also use capacitors to integrate a current signal. =Tuned circuits= Air gap tuning capacitor Capacitors and inductors are applied together in tuned circuits to select information in particular frequency bands. For example, radio receivers rely on variable capacitors to tune the station frequency. Speakers use passive analog crossovers, and analog equalizers use capacitors to select different audio bands.  Sensing  Most capacitors are designed to maintain a fixed physical structure. However, various factors can change the structure of the capacitor; the resulting change in capacitance can be used to sense those factors. =Changing the dielectric= The effects of varying the characteristics of the dielectric can also be used for sensing and measurement. Capacitors with an exposed and porous dielectric can be used to measure humidity in air. Capacitors are used to accurately measure the fuel level in airplanes; as the fuel covers more of a pair of plates, the circuit capacitance increases. =Changing the distance between the plates= A capacitor with a flexible plate can be used to measure strain or pressure or weight. Industrial pressure transmitters used for process control use pressure-sensing diaphragms, which form a capacitor plate of an oscillator circuit. Capacitors are used as the sensor in condenser microphones, where one plate is moved by air pressure, relative to the fixed position of the other plate. Some accelerometers use microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) capacitors etched on a chip to measure the magnitude and direction of the acceleration vector. They are used to detect changes in acceleration, e.g. as tilt sensors or to detect free fall, as sensors triggering airbag deployment, and in many other applications. Some fingerprint sensors use capacitors. =Changing the effective area of the plates= Capacitive touch switches are now used on many consumer electronic products. Oscillators Example of a simple oscillator that requires a capacitor to function A capacitor can possess spring-like qualities in an oscillator circuit. In the image example, a capacitor acts to influence the biasing voltage at the npn transistor's base. The resistance values of the voltage-divider resistors and the capacitance value of the capacitor together control the oscillatory frequency. Hazards and safety Capacitors may retain a charge long after power is removed from a circuit; this charge can cause dangerous or even potentially fatal shocks or damage connected equipment. For example, even a seemingly innocuous device such as a disposable camera flash unit powered by a 1.5 volt AA battery contains a capacitor which may be charged to over 300 volts. This is easily capable of delivering a shock. Service procedures for electronic devices usually include instructions to discharge large or high-voltage capacitors. Capacitors may also have built-in discharge resistors to dissipate stored energy to a safe level within a few seconds after power is removed. High-voltage capacitors are stored with the terminals shorted, as protection from potentially dangerous voltages due to dielectric absorption. Some old, large oil-filled capacitors contain polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). It is known that waste PCBs can leak into groundwater under landfills. Capacitors containing PCB were labelled as containing \\"Askarel\\" and several other trade names. PCB-filled capacitors are found in very old (pre 1975) fluorescent lamp ballasts, and other applications. High-voltage capacitors may catastrophically fail when subjected to voltages or currents beyond their rating, or as they reach their normal end of life. Dielectric or metal interconnection failures may create arcing that vaporizes dielectric fluid, resulting in case bulging, rupture, or even an explosion. Capacitors used in RF or sustained high-current applications can overheat, especially in the center of the capacitor rolls. Capacitors used within high-energy capacitor banks can violently explode when a short in one capacitor causes sudden dumping of energy stored in the rest of the bank into the failing unit. High voltage vacuum capacitors can generate soft X-rays even during normal operation. Proper containment, fusing, and preventive maintenance can help to minimize these hazards. High-voltage capacitors can benefit from a pre-charge to limit in-rush currents at power-up of high voltage direct current (HVDC) circuits. This will extend the life of the component and may mitigate high-voltage hazards.

The two-stream approximation is commonly used in parameterizations of radiative transport in global circulation models and in weather forecasting models, such as the WRF. There is a large number of applications of the two-stream approximation, including variants such as the Kubelka-Munk approximation. It is the simplest approximation that can be used to explain common observations inexplicable by single-scattering arguments, such as the brightness and color of the clear sky, the brightness of clouds, the whiteness of a glass of milk, and the darkening of sand upon wetting.Bohren, Craig F., 1987, Multiple scattering of light and some of its observable consequences, American Journal of Physics, 55, 524-533.

Limey obtains autographs from different actors. Wanda and Reggie sing and conduct for the company, attracting positive attention. Hal Reed, a famous actor, leaves drunk, saying that he wants to do something better. Wanda chases outside & offers to drive him home. Mr. Wolf, his studio CEO, is horrified by his drunken behavior. At Hal's home, he asks Wanda to make him a nightcap; he drinks it while she says, \\"Bottom's Up.\\" They talk while he falls asleep, and she leaves, Wanda confessing how much his roles have meant to her and that he's very loved, both by the public and by her. The next morning, Smoothie's confused that no-one's called to inquire about hiring any of them. Limey says he has a premonition that Wolf will call tomorrow. He mails him a letter, saying that Hal Reed took an important man's daughter - a minor - to his apartment the night of the party and that the press doesn't yet know. Wolf panics upon reading the letter, asks Hal who the girl was, and invites the Brocklehurst party to his office. With Smoothie leading the conversation, Wolf decides to sign Wanda to a contract as \\"Wanda Gale,\\" relieved that the studio's not being sued. Upon \\"Lord Brocklehurst\\" being insulted, Mr. Wolf signs Reggie to a stunt contract, poo-pooing his singing. Director Lane Worthing's alarmed at Wolf's hand being forced and says that they - the studio - should investigate in case this is a criminal gang. Now alarmed too, Wolf and Worthing tell Hal to romance Wanda to obtain information from her. Judith is removed as the star of her film, replaced by Wanda, and she's furious. Worthing tells Limey that Wanda's a natural actress. Reggie's in the film as a knight. Wanda goes to lunch with Hal, refusing Smoothie's invitation. Hal takes Wanda on a moonlit sail and tells her he's in love with her. They kiss, and she asks him if he'd love her if she weren't Lord Brocklehurst's daughter. He answers that he's in love with Wanda Gale. Reggie attempts to ride a horse, which runs away from him. Upon looking up the Brocklehursts in Burke's Peerage, Worthing tells Wolfe he can't find them in the list. Smoothie tells Wolf that Limey always denied being Lord Brocklehurst and that neither contract could be terminated, as both Wanda and Reggie signed them under their own names. Wolf denies this only to discover that additional clauses were added to each contract in his handwriting (no doubt forged by Limey, but un-provable). At this, Smoothie demands more for each actor, including cars to and from the set. Still in love with Wanda and determined to propose, he buys her an engagement ring. When Judith finds out, she threatens Wanda and Limey, telling her that the only reason Hal's hung around is because she's \\"Lord Brocklehurst's daughter.\\" Wanda declares she's quitting, that she doesn't want a career, but Limey convinces her to stay. She sings and dances with Hal in a musical number for their next film. After, Hal tells her that he loves Wanda Gale, but says will never believe him again because he was spying on her. She runs to her dressing room, where Smoothie's waiting to propose. Smoothie comforts Wanda, who says she never wants to see Hal again. He promises to take care of everything and pockets his ring. Smoothie finds Hal, who has started to drink. Smoothie challenges him about her. Hal says that it's guys like Smoothie who run out on girls like Wanda when the facade fades, but men like him marry - and he would if Wanda would have him. Smoothie returns to Wanda to tell her the good news and that he's leaving for San Francisco, asking for a kiss goodbye. She kisses him, and he leaves. At the premiere for Wanda and Hal's film, Smoothie, Limey, and Spud are sitting outside. Limey pulls out his autograph book, saying that he still has signatures and they can do something with them. Smoothie throws it away, to Limey's horror. On the red carpet, Wolf brags that he signed Wanda to her contract. Hal and Wanda publicly thank Smoothie for his great kindness to them.

It is situated on the border between the neighborhood of By√•sen and the forested area of Bymarka. The site came into popular recreational use in 1933 when the Gr√•kallen Line (Gr√•kallbanen) of the Trondheim Tramway was extended. Lian Station remains the terminus of Gr√•kallbanen. With the arrival of the tramway, a ski jump was built and Lian Restaurant was opened at the end of the line. The area became a primary location for winter sports in the city. Lianvannet was an important swimming place during the summer and was also possible to rent row boats. A dancing area was also built. From 1925, the frozen lake was used for trotting, with up to 6,000 watchers. In 1927, A/S Graakalbanen offered the trotting association 100 hectare of land for a harness racing course, although the association did not except the deal since the tramway was not yet built. Instead they established Leangen Travbane at Leangen. During World War II, the new field was confiscated by the German occupation forces.Kjenstad, 1994: 58 The area around Lian has many cabins and some houses. About sixty cabins are illegally permanently occupied; only those buildings occupied from before 1967 may legally be permanently lived in. In 2008, the city suggested giving an amnesty for those who live in illegal houses, but have suggested changing reconstruction regulations for all houses in the area. This will in essence decrease the house value of legal housing (which come under restrictions) to illegal housing (which now may be sold as permanent housing). This created a local controversy.

History =Ganado Mission: Hospital, Nursing School, School and Church= Presbyterian missionaries began work at Ganado in 1901. Local trader Don Lorenzo Hubbell helped them obtain land and gave them the use of a small house near his store. The first pastor was Charles Bierkemper. Mrs. Bierkemper started a school in the living room of that home while her husband was overseeing the building of a church and a manse. In 1910, Dr. James D. Kennedy arrived to serve the small community, visiting patients on foot and by buggy. The three-fold thrust of the Presbyterian Mission was in place. By the mid 1920s the school, now housed in part of the church, had grown by several grades. Medical work was carried on from a small twelve-bed hospital. In 1927, Dr. Clarence G. Salsbury arrived. He supervised the building of a new 75-bed hospital which opened its doors in 1930 under the name of Sage Memorial Hospital, a tribute to the major donors for the project, the Russell Sage Foundation. By 1930 the school had become a complete elementary-high institution, graduating its first three seniors. In the same year, Salsbury started a school for Native nurses. Only women from minority groups were accepted. In 1933 the first two nursing students completed their studies, passed the state boards, and became RN's. During World War II years, many of the graduates of Sage Memorial School of Nursing served with honor in the military. Ganado High School graduates also served, as well as a number of students who had not finished and who later came back to complete their schooling. Several Code Talkers were among them. After the war, minority youth, especially those who had served, found easier acceptance into higher education everywhere. In order to broaden their experience, Sage Memorial was sending students to other hospitals for certain specialized training. After graduating the class of 1951, Sage Memorial Hospital School of Nursing closed. The staff helped the remaining undergraduates transfer to good schools, and nursing continued to be a career chosen by many Native Americans. Small public schools under state supervision had been growing across the Reservation, at first serving English only students, both Anglo and Navajo. In addition, Navajo parents could now keep their children at home and send them to school on a bus. Government day schools were closing. By the mid 1960s Ganado Public School was an elementary-high system, a competitor for the Mission school. In 1970 Ganado Mission High School graduated its last class, and the College of Ganado came into existence. Many of the leaders for the Navajo Tribe in early years and after World War II came from church sponsored schools: the Presbyterians at Ganado, the Methodists in Farmington, the Catholics at St. Michaels, and the Christian Reformed at Rehoboth near Gallup. The last two still exist. However, young people who attended the much-maligned BIA schools did also become important members of the tribe, working for their people. Also under the pressure of changing times, in 1969, Sage Memorial Hospital was turned over to Project Hope. Hope had been successful around the globe in getting third-world medical systems in order. They projected that in five years they could prepare Sage Memorial Hospital to be locally run, and by 1974 Sage Memorial was under the control of a local board, the Navajo Nation Health Foundation, though this name was somewhat misleading because it was not under tribal control. This time, Hope did not succeed; despite considerable help from the Indian Health Service, in 1986 the hospital was turned over to a for- profit company. The college was not a success and lasted only until 1986. Many of the campus buildings remain, most under the control of Sage Memorial, three under control of the local Presbyterian Church, which continues to be active, but with a smaller congregation. The Public School has become a large institution and the main provider of jobs in a still small community. The Alumni Association of Ganado Mission High School has survived and continued to meet every two years. It now includes nursing school alums, retired staff from all campus areas, neighbors from government and public schools, traders, spouses, children of all these people ‚Äì anyone who spent some formative years, maybe just one or two, at Ganado and wants to cement old friendships. It is now called the Ganado Mission Association. The campus is in poor shape, a sad sight for those who remember happy days in a green oasis. In 2009 Sage Memorial Hospital School of Nursing was declared a National Historic Landmark. A granite monument on the campus pays tribute to the minority women who trained there. All of their names appear under the year of their graduation. The National Park Service, through its staff at Hubbell Trading Post National Historic Site, watches over it.

The couple eventually moved to 415 Monroe Street, Hoboken, New Jersey. Their only child, Francis Albert Sinatra, was born on December 12, 1915. Sinatra continued his boxing career until he broke his wrists after 30 professional fights. He then attempted to find marine work but was rejected due to asthma. Dolly helped him find work as a fireman, and he was eventually appointed to the Hoboken Fire Department in 1927, where he attained the rank of Captain without having to take any formal exams. While still a Captain in the fire department, Sinatra and his wife opened a tavern, called Marty O'Brien's. With sufficient income, the family of three moved to a three-bedroom apartment, only a few blocks away from Monroe Street, but well out of Little Italy, at 703 Park Avenue. Sinatra suffered a fatal heart attack in 1969 at a Houston hospital. He was buried at the Desert Memorial Park in Cathedral City, California; other family members, including Frank Sinatra and Anthony's wife are buried nearby.

The screenplay was written by Thelma Schnee, the maiden name of Thelma Moss, who later became a famous parapsychologist. The film's storyline is credited to Willis Goldbeck, while John P. Fulton handled the special photographic effects, and Wally Westmore handled the makeup. Paramount Pictures theatrically released Colossus in June 1958 as a double feature with The Space Children. Following an accident, Jeremy Spensser's brain is transplanted by his scientist father into the huge body of an unattractive, frightening cyborg, to save his brilliant son's mind so that it can continue to serve mankind. Soon, his son's brain becomes transformed by the experimental procedure, losing key attributes that make him human and define his personality. Plot Jeremy Spensser (Ross Martin), the brilliant young son of a New York family of scientists and humanitarians, is killed when hit by a truck as he chases his son's toy airplane. His death occurs on the eve of his winning the \\"International Peace Prize\\", and he leaves behind a wife (Mala Powers) and young son (Charles Herbert). Jeremy's father, noted brain surgeon William Spensser (Otto Kruger), is distressed that his son's gifts will be denied to mankind. He devises a plan to give Jeremy's mind another chance to benefit humanity by transplanting the brain (which he has revived and kept on life support) into an artificial, robotic body. William convinces Jeremy's brother, Henry, an expert in automation, to assist with the process in secret. Because of its horrific appearance, the huge colossus (Ed Wolff) they've created is kept in seclusion for nearly a year, secretly continuing Jeremy's work on new food sources. Deprived of normal human contact and possibly of its \\"soul\\", Jeremy's mind slowly begins to lose its humanity. He kills his brother, who has fallen in love with Jeremy's wife, and then speaks to his father of the futility of providing food for \\"the slum people of the world\\", when it's \\"simpler and wiser to get rid of them\\". As Jeremy's mind loses control of his mechanical body, other unexplained powers suddenly emerge from the strictly mechanical body, including mind control of humans and a death ray emanating from both its eyes. Finally, Jeremy's out-of-control body goes on a rampage in the United Nations building, killing several people. Only when Jeremy's young son confronts the cyborg is Jeremy able to restore his self- control long enough to tell the boy how to switch off and destroy the body of the \\"colossus\\".

He was the son of the landscape painter Jacob George Strutt (1790‚Äì1864) and the writer and traveller Elizabeth Strutt. Life After travelling across Italy, in 1831, in retinue of his father, Strutt moved to Rome, where he definitively established his residence. He travelled with his father in France and Switzerland from 1835 to 1837, and later in Italy. In 1841 he travelled on foot through central and southern Italy and in Sicily. He and his friend, the poet William Jackson, otherwise unknown, started from the Porta San Giovanni of Rome on 30 April 1841, reaching Palermo on 15 December, and arriving back at Rome in July of the following year. An account of this journey is given in his A Pedestrian Tour in Calabria & Sicily published in London, in 1842. In 1849 Arthur John Strutt and his father had a studio at 52, via del Babuino, an address found both in the Roman Advertiser and, for Mrs. Strutt, in the address-book of Elizabeth Barrett Browning. In 1853 his studio was at 33, via del Mercede; he is described as \\"a very clever painter of landscapes and Roman costumes, and author of an interesting work on Calabria\\". In 1869 his studio was at 20, via di S. Basilio, and the description reads: \\"a very clever painter of landscapes, scenery about Rome, and groups of Roman peasantry and cattle; he has produced some large subjects of the Campagna, of its aqueducts, and the scenery along the Via Appia ... he is the author of an interesting work on Calabria\\". In 1881 the address is 81, via della Croce, and the description largely unchanged.  Art works  Many of his paintings are of subjects from the Campagna Romana. A celebrated one depicts a meet of the Roman Hunt with King Umberto I. His sketchbooks are in the Huntington Library in San Marino, California.  Archaeology  From 1881 until his death in 1888 Strutt was an honorary inspector of antiquities at Lanuvium, on the recommendation of Rodolfo Lanciani; he was made an honorary citizen of the modern town of Lanuvio and elected to the Consiglio comunale or town council. His descriptions of Latin inscriptions in the area were published in the scientific periodical Notizie degli scavi di antichit√† of the Reale Accademia dei Lincei and elsewhere.

The Faculty of Medicine of Mar√≠lia is one of the most prominent medical faculties in South America, playing a critical role not only as the major provider of health services in the Marilia region, but also nationally as the developer of medical and nursing skills. The faculty enjoys close affiliation with a number of hospitals, research institutes and health care organisations in the State of S√£o Paulo, Brazil. History The school was founded in 1966 as a private non-profit medical school in the State of S√£o Paulo. It was later transformed into a public institution in 1994, and is now a self-governing body of the S√£o Paulo state government. Since then, Famema has been one of the most innovative medical schools in Brazil, being the first Brazilian medical school to adopt Problem-Based Learning. Problem-based learning Famema was the first medical school in Brazil to adopt Problem- Based Learning as the pedagogy for its medical and nursing courses. PBL exposes Famema students to opportunities to develop flexible knowledge, effective problem solving skills, self-directed learning, effective collaboration skills and intrinsic motivation. As a result, Famema graduates are regarded not only for their exceptional medico-professional skills, but also for their ability to quickly grasp complex concepts and thus work independently. After the implementation of the method, the medical curriculum was revised to become more student-centric, with decreasing classroom time and professor supervision, which has been the subject of criticism by some students and professors. Although controversial, the method resulted in unprecedented results, with Famema graduates achieving one of the highest marks on Brazil's National Student Performance Exam (ENADE in Portuguese). Hospital das Cl√≠nicas de Mar√≠lia Famema's teaching hospital is the Hospital das Cl√≠nicas de Mar√≠lia. Rankings The school has frequently made it to the top rankings of medical schools in Brazil, in spite of its independent nature and not being linked to any major university. In 2010, Famema ranked 21st on the Brazilian national medical school ranking. Another remarkable accolade was given by the Guia do Estudante magazine, a periodic about universities, who gave the Famema four stars out of five to both medical and nursing courses. In 2013, the school appeared for the first time on RUF (Ranking Universit√°rio Folha), the ranking of the biggest newspaper in Brazil, as the 10th best faculty of medicine.

Originally published in 1786, it remained in print until the beginning of the twentieth century.Grenby, \\"Introduction\\", viii; Wills, DLB, 344. Plot Fabulous Histories tells the story of two families‚Äîone of robins and one of humans‚Äîwho learn to live together congenially. The children and baby robins learn to adopt virtue and to shun vice. For Trimmer, practising kindness to animals as a child would hopefully lead one to \\"universal benevolence\\" as an adult. According to Samuel Pickering Jr., a scholar of eighteenth-century children's literature, \\"in its depiction of eighteenth-century attitudes toward animals, Mrs. Trimmer‚Äôs Fabulous Histories was the most representative children‚Äôs book of the period.\\"Pickering, 29. Thematic elements The text expresses several themes that would dominate Trimmer's later works, such as her emphasis on retaining social hierarchies; as Tess Cosslett, a scholar of children's literature explains: \\"the notion of hierarchy that underpins Fabulous Histories is relatively stable and fixed. Parents are above children in terms of authority, and humans above animals, in terms both of dominion and compassion: poor people should be fed before hungry animals ... [but] the hierarchical relation of men and women is not so clearly enforced.\\"Cosslett, 41. Moira Ferguson, a scholar of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, places these themes in a larger historical context, arguing that \\"the fears of the author and her class about an industrial revolution in ascendancy and its repercussions are evident. Hence, [the] text attacks cruelty to birds and animals while affirming British aggression abroad. ... The text subtly opts for conservative solutions: maintenance of order and established values, resignation and compliance from the poor at home, expatriation for foreigners who do not assimilate easily.\\"Ferguson, 7. This, the lede image of chapter 8, shows Master Frederick viewing the young robins. Another overarching theme in the text is rationality; Trimmer expresses the common fear of the power of fiction in her preface, explaining to her childish readers that her fable is not real and that animals cannot really speak.Trimmer, Sarah. Fabulous Histories. Designed for the Instruction of Children, Respecting their Treatment of Animals. London: Printed for T. Longman (1786), x-xi. Like many social critics during the eighteenth century, Trimmer was concerned about fiction's potentially damaging impact on young readers. With the rise of the novel and its concomitant private reading, he feared young people and especially women would read racy and adventurous stories without the knowledge of their parents and, perhaps even more worrisome, interpret the books as they pleased. Trimmer therefore always referred to her text as Fabulous Histories and never as The Story of the Robins in order to emphasize its reality; moreover, she did not allow the book to be illustrated within her lifetime‚Äîpictures of talking birds would only have reinforced the paradox of the book (it was fiction parading as a history).Jackson, 143. Yarde speculated that most of the characters in the text are drawn from Trimmer's own acquaintances and family.Yarde, Sarah Trimmer of Brentford and Her Children, 33‚Äì4. Critical evaluation Murray Knowles, writing in Language and Control in Children's Literature, states that Trimmer intended the book to be used didactically, a common practice in eighteenth-century children's literature.\\"Picturing Childhood: The Evolution of the Illustrated Children's Book\\" , by Cynthia Burlingham, for the University of California-Los Angeles. More than one hundred years later, in Juvenile Literature As It Is, Edward Salmon found \\"nothing unusually meritorious\\" about the book, though he noted that it \\"should be praised for its humane sentiments.\\" Sources *Cosslett, Tess. \\"Fabulous Histories and Papillonades.\\" Talking Animals in British Children‚Äôs Fiction, 1786‚Äì1914.

Operated by Myanmar Railways, the 39-station loop system connects satellite towns and suburban areas to the city. Circa 2008‚Äì2010, the railway had about 200 coaches, had 20 daily runs, and sold 100,000 to 150,000 tickets daily. The loop, which takes about three hours to complete, is a way to see a cross section of life in Yangon. The Railway is heavily utilized by lower-income commuters, as it is (along with buses) the cheapest method of transportation in Yangon. The hours of service have been consistent over the years, from 3:45 am to 10:15 pm daily. In 2011, the cost of a ticket for a distance of 15 miles was two hundred kyats (~eighteen US cents), and that for over 15 miles was four hundred kyats (~37 US cents). In the new currency (introduced in 2012) long distance tickets are 200 kyat (~20 US cents). History Yangon Circular Railway was built during colonial times by the British. The double track railway was built in 1954. In July 2011, the Ministry of Rail Transportation announced that it intended to privatize the Yangon Circular Railway, since the government-run system operates at a loss for the government, with monthly operating costs about 260 million kyats () and monthly revenues about 42 million kyats (). Ticket prices have been kept low because of ministry subsidies. In December 2012, Japan International Cooperation Agency began its collaboration with Yangon City Development Committee to develop a master plan for the Greater Yangon region, including the issue of public transport. In 2015 air conditioned coaches were introduced with a slightly higher ticket cost, but these did not last long, and by mid 2016 air conditioning was no longer available. Myanmar Railways has had plans for a major upgrade for the Circle Line since 2012. It is to be funded in large part by a $212 million loan from Japan‚Äôs development agency. The hope is for all of the coaches and engines to be replaced by 2020, along with automation of the signaling systems and replacement of the aging tracks. The frequency of trains would be increased from the current two per hour. Route and stations The loop network consists of 39 stations, linking various parts of Yangon. The entire circular trip takes approximately 3 hours. Map from train is shown to the right, with approximate location of stations. The loop begins from Yangon Central Railway Station to Mingaladon Railway Station near Yangon International Airport, via Insein to the west and Okkalapa in the east.

At this time she married Petr Granditsky, but the marriage did not last long.

Sharpe was born in County Sligo, Ireland and worked as a bank clerk in his teens. He moved to Canada in 1885 initially working in Toronto as a pavement contractor, then in 1892 moved to Winnipeg. He was a Winnipeg city alderman since 1899 before becoming mayor. When a rise in cases of typhoid fever in Winnipeg was discovered in 1904 by the municipal Department of Health, mayor Sharpe responded with an aggressive program to develop and enforce sewage and water services. His work as mayor also led to the establishment of Winnipeg's first Board of Control in 1906. In March 1906, he responded to a strike by employees of the Winnipeg Electric Railway Company with strikebreakers and then with armed militia, earning the mayor the nickname \\"Gatling Gun Sharpe\\". This incident was considered a precursor to the 1919 Winnipeg General Strike. After 1906, Sharpe did not seek another term as mayor and returned to business interests.

Lewis, Moderate Is Said to Be Pick for Court The New York Times, March 17, 2009 He was confirmed by the Senate on November 19, 2009, in a 59‚Äì39 vote. Early life, education, and career Born in Bloomington, Indiana, Hamilton grew up in southern Indiana and earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Haverford College in 1979, followed by a Juris Doctor from Yale Law School in 1983. He also performed graduate work as a Fulbright Scholar at the University of T√ºbingen in Germany. Hamilton worked from 1983 until 1984 as a law clerk for Judge Richard Dickson Cudahy of the Seventh Circuit. He then entered private practice in Indianapolis until 1989 as an associate at the law firm of Barnes & Thornburg. He served as legal counsel to Indiana Governor Evan Bayh from 1989 until 1991. Hamilton returned to Barnes & Thornburg in Indianapolis, working as a partner from 1991 until becoming a federal judge in 1994. During his time in private practice, Hamilton frequently did pro bono work for the Indiana Civil Liberties Union, where he served briefly as a board member and vice president for litigation. Federal judicial service President Clinton nominated Hamilton to be a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana on June 8, 1994. The Senate confirmed Hamilton in a voice vote on October 7, 1994. In 2008, Hamilton became the chief judge of the Southern District of Indiana. A number of cases Hamilton decided as a district court judge drew media attention. In American Amusement Mach. Ass'n v. Cottey,American Amusement Mach. Ass'n v. Cottey, 115 F. Supp. 2d 943 (S.D. Ind. 2000). Hamilton held that the First Amendment did not prevent the city of Indianapolis from requiring parental consent for children to have access to video games containing explicit sexual content or extreme violence. This ruling was overturned by the Seventh Circuit.American Amusement Machine Association v. Kendrick, 244 F.3d 572 (7th Cir. 2001). Hamilton drew headlines in 2005 for ruling that the Indiana state legislature violated the Establishment Clause when it began sessions with Christian prayers imploring conversion to Christianity or representing Christianity as the only true faith. He held that prayers invoking Jesus Christ or using terms like savior were sectarian, but names for God in other languages were permissible, absent evidence that those words were used in order to advance or disparage a particular religion. Hinrichs v. Bosma, 400 F.Supp.2d 1103 (S.D.Ind.2005), Entry on Post Judgment Motion at 15 (Dec. 28, 2005) The ruling was overturned by the Seventh Circuit on the ground that the taxpayer plaintiffs lacked standing.Hinrichs v. Speaker of the House of Representatives, 506 F.3rd 584 (7th Cir. 2007) On March 17, 2009, President Obama announced his intention to nominate Hamilton to a vacancy on the Seventh Circuit that was created by the September 2008 transition to senior status by Judge Kenneth Francis Ripple. Obama formally nominated Hamilton later that day. On November 17, 2009, the Senate voted 70‚Äì29 to end the Republican filibuster of the nomination, and the Senate approved Hamilton's nomination in a 59‚Äì39 vote two days later. In March 2017, Hamilton partially dissented when the circuit found that police officers could not be sued for needlessly destroying property during a search because they had prevented the owner from witnessing which officers had caused the damage and that the owner had not pled a novel ‚Äúconspiracy of silence‚Äù claim.. On August 27, 2019, Hamilton wrote the majority opinion in blocking Indiana's parental notification requirement. Hamilton was joined by Ilana Rovner, over the dissent of Michael Steven Kanne. On November 1, 2019, the 7th circuit denied rehearing by a vote of 6-5, with Hamilton in the majority, however Frank Easterbrook, who provided the decisive vote, called on the Supreme Court to hear the case.

The title character was a spy-chasing lieutenant commander in Naval intelligence. The comic strip led to a radio adventure serial that began in 1937, as well as film serials that began in 1942. Original comic book stories also appeared in Fawcett Comics titles starting in 1943. Publication history The idea for Don Winslow was conceived by Lieutenant Commander Frank V. Martinek, USNR, himself a storied veteran of World War I Naval intelligence, after Admiral Wat T. Cluverius complained to him about the difficulties of recruiting in the Midwest. Ruminating on the challenge, Martinek decided that a comic strip that focused on Naval tradition and courage would educate and fascinate America‚Äôs youth. He had previously used the character Don Winslow in some novels he wrote, so he had the main concept readymade. Colonel Frank Knox, later Secretary of the Navy helped sell the idea to the Bell Syndicate. Martinek brought in Naval Lieutenant Leon Beroth as art director and Carl Hammond to handle layouts and research. Martinek articulated this central principle: \\"Since Don Winslow of the Navy is approved by the Navy Department, I cannot allow him to do anything that is contrary to the ideals, traditions or motives of the Navy.\\"Sheridan, Martin. Comics and Their Creators. Westport, CT. Hyperion Press Inc. Reprint Ed., 1977. p. 128.Lambiek: Leon Beroth The strip debuted on March 5, 1934. A Sunday page was added on April 21, 1935. Martinek supervised the daily feature‚Äôs \\"general tone and direction\\", sending the typewritten continuity to Beroth every week for illustrations. From 1934 to 1952, Beroth was the leading artist on the feature. Ken Ernst (later famous for Mary Worth), assisted or ghosted the art between 1940 and 1942. With Don leaving his fianc√©e behind in December 1941 to go fight the Japanese, the World War II period saw the height of Don Winslow's popularity. The Sunday page featured several topper strips during the course of the run: Bos'n Hal (April 21, 1935-1940s), Bos'n Hal's Notebook (1936), Winslowgrams aka Don Winslow's Hero-Gram (February 9, 1936-March 14, 1943) and Winslow's Crime Facts (June-August 1944). The Bell-McClure Syndicate dropped the strip in 1953, and it was picked up by General Features, where it was illustrated by John Jordan.Jordan entry, Who's Who of American Comic Books: 1928‚Äì1999. Accessed Oct, 25, 2018. The strip finally came to a close on Saturday, July 30, 1955.  Story and characters  Don's best pal throughout the run of the series was the somewhat chubby Red Pennington. His commanding officer for a time was Admiral Colby. Mercedes Colby, the Admiral's daughter, was Don's romantic interest for the first half of the narrative, from 1935 to 1946. Mercedes was a war nurse and in a rare instance of realism returned to the states in 1944 suffering from \\"war trauma.\\" Jane Steele, a captain in the WAVES, was introduced in 1951, and Don's sister Mary Winlsow was incorporated in 1952.\\"Don Winslow of the Navy\\" by Mark Carlson-Ghost retrieved on 9/30/2017 Don's primary nemesis was The Scorpion. He opposed Don from the very beginning of the comic strip, often behind the scenes and unseen for long periods of time, as the head of a global, extra-national organization of espionage and sabotage called Scorpia. Time in Tibet allowed him to develop a variety of abilities, including on at least two occasions having his spirit leave his body and permanently possess another new one. He had a daughter, Madame Mask (1937, 1950), who was just as evil but not quite as persistent. The Scorpion favored beautiful associates, including Lotus (1934‚Äì36, 1941, 1943) who later reformed; Tasmia (1936‚Äì37, 1940, 1946); and Asmara (1940‚Äì42). Agents of Scorpia in the 1930s included the Crocodile (1936), Dr. Thor (1937), and the Duchess (1937); in the 1940s, The Duster (1948), the Polecat (1948), and Cold Shivers (1949); and in the 1950s: Half-Dome (1951), Eight Ball (1951), and the Red Vulture (1952). Efforts to create new menaces other than Scorpia were generally short-lived, but included Owl-Eyes (1939, 1949), and clandestine organizations such as The Panther's Claw (1943) and the Clenched Fist (1944).Carlson-Ghost, Mark. \\"Don Winslow of the Navy\\".

When that title ceased publication in 1942, Don Winslow reprints begin running in Popular Comics, again with other strip favorites of the era. In addition, Dell also had Don Winslow in two issues of their Four Color Comics, a series which spotlighted a different character with nearly every issue.

In June 2009, the Mayor stated that: Alikhan at the EOC opening > Arif Alikhan has been instrumental in advancing my administration's central > priorities of preparing Los Angeles to respond to natural disasters and > against the threat of terrorism, increasing public safety, and putting 1,000 > new LAPD officers on our streets,‚Äù said Mayor Villaraigosa. ‚ÄúI wish him luck > as he assumes this new role with the Obama Administration, and look forward > to his continued efforts to help protect Los Angeles and our nation's > cities.http://www.laobserved.com/archive/2009/04/homeland_security_deputy.php Alikhan's efforts to hire 1,000 new LAPD officers resulted in the highest deployment level in LAPD history before Alikhan left for Washington. Additionally, Mr. Alikhan significantly advanced the Mayor‚Äôs emergency preparedness and counter-terrorism initiatives, substantially increased cooperation with federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, led the effort to create the L.A.

Stylistically, the work is jagged, dissonant (though with moments of uninhibited tonality) and often wildly percussive, which is a marked contrast to much of the other works on which Williamson was working at the time, such as the ever-popular choral works Procession of Psalms and Agnus Dei, the picturesque Travel Diaries for piano solo, and the grand Piano Concerto No. 3 (completed a year later, in 1962). Many listeners at the time were bewildered by the (allegedly) bizarre sound-world of the concerto, and there were mixed reviews from the press. The Daily Mail had the headline: \\"This won't do, Mr. Williamson!\\".Harris & Meredith, pp.124-5 Williamson himself later recalled that \\"the concerto's first performance was received with enthusiastic abuse by the more conservative elements of the British organ world for being too venturesome, by Baroque enthusiasts for its use of the romantic organ, and by some critics for not being sufficiently venturesome!\\" However, subsequent performances have showed it to be one of Williamson's best works, and is held in high regard by many.Lyrita SRCD.280  Structure  The concerto is divided into three movements, as follows: *I.

Career He studied zoology at the University of Jena, earning his doctorate in 1878. Afterwards he worked as an assistant at the Universities of Jena and Kiel. In 1881 he emigrated to New Zealand, working at the museums in Dunedin, under Professor Parker, and Christchurch under Professor von Haast. The following year he moved to Australia, where he replaced F. G. Waterhouse as Director of the South Australian Museum in Adelaide, and was a founding member of the Field Naturalists Society of South Australia. In August 1884 he laid to rest an old mystery about echidnas, proving they are oviparous not viviparous, William Hay Caldwell in New South Wales made a similar (and almost coincidental) finding with the platypus with a specimen sent to the Museum by a naturalist on Kangaroo Island. His work and the liberality with which he was treated attracted some criticism, as did his bombastic self-promotion. He resigned his position in October 1884, after a series of disputes with the Museum's management but did not leave the colony. He served as zoologist with the 1885 Geographical Society of Australasia's expedition to the Fly River, Papua New Guinea. In June 1886 he announced his imminent departure for Europe, and was invited by a large deputation of German settlers to represent them at an Allgemeiner Deutscher Kongress to be held in Berlin that September but declined, and left South Australia around July 1886 without fanfare. From 1888 to 1893 he was director of the zoo in Frankfurt-am-Main, and afterwards was a lecturer at Darmstadt University of Technology (until 1897). Later, he worked as a private scholar and grammar school teacher.Deutsche Biographie He died in L√ºneburg on December 6, 1912. Haacke is remembered for research of oviparity in monotremes, and studies involving the morphology of jellyfish and corals. In 1893 he coined the evolutionary term \\"orthogenesis\\". He also conducted investigations in the field of animal husbandry. Evolutionary views Haacke studied under Ernst Haeckel. He later turned against Haeckel for holding Darwinist views. He was also a critic of August Weismann. He experimented with mice and proposed a system of heredity similar to Gregor Mendel but differed in results. Haacke was a neo-Lamarckian and proponent of the inheritance of acquired characters.Levit, Georgy S; Olsson, Lennart. (2007). Evolution on Rails Mechanisms and Levels of Orthogenesis. In Volker Wissemann. Annals of the History and Philosophy of Biology 11/2006. Universit√§tsverlag G√∂ttingen. pp. 100-104. Haacke believed that cells consist of individuals called gemmaria that operate as hereditary units. These consist of even smaller units known as gemmae. He believed these units to explain neo-Lamarckian inheritance. He was a proponent of orthogenesis. He held that from his theory of epimorphism evolution is a directed process tending towards perfection.

Demographics Instow, like so many other small farming communities throughout Saskatchewan, has struggled to maintain a sturdy population causing Instow to become a complete ghost town with few to no residents. Prior to January 1, 2002, Instow was incorporated under village status, but was dissolved into an unincorporated community under the jurisdiction of the Rural municipality of Bone Creek on that date. In 2006, Instow had a population of 1 living in 1 dwellings, a 0% decrease from 2001. The village had a land area of and a population density of . History Early years Instow was once a small community founded in 1914 with the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway. C. Herbert, the first post master and founder of the small community, decided to name it after the small town of Instow, England, where he was originally from. During Instow's boom years in 1923 the town grew to a peak of 60 citizens and was incorporated to village status. After incorporation, streetlights were installed throughout the village, a well, sidewalks, a skating rink, a seven-metre snow slide for winter sports and a ball diamond were built. The village even had a its very own fire engine, two general stores, a restaurant, a bank, a livery barn, a lumberyard, a community hall, an implement agency, a post office, a garage, a telephone office, a blacksmith, a pool hall, and a total of 5 grain elevators. Decline In 1951 Instow's Village Council decided it would be best for the village to dissolve into an unincorporated community due to the rapid decline in its population. The community was struck once again with the closure of the post office in 1963. Over time many of the buildings in Instow have either been moved, demolished or simply rotted away, leaving very little to nothing of the community remaining.

From 1899 until the 1980s, Southern operated a line through Lena and nearby Allendale, Tarboro, and Furman. Called the \\"Southern Columbia to Savannah Route\\", the rail also ran through Barnwell and Blackville to the North. Its primary purpose for Southern was to increase north‚Äìsouth passenger/freight traffic by feeding into ACL (Atlantic Coast Line) at Hardeeville for passage south to Florida or north to Charleston and other points. The rail line was built to compete with another north‚Äìsouth rail line operated nearby by Seaboard Air Line (also called the Florida Central & Peninsular, later Seaboard Coast Line, and presently CSX) which ran a different course through Denmark, Fairfax, Estill, Garnett (parallel to U.S. Route 321) and then into Georgia. Between 1963 and 1970, Southern abandoned its tracks between Furman and Hardeeville leaving Furman as the ending station from Columbia.http://abandonedrailroads.homestead.com/sc_southern_edmund_hardeeville.html Finally, in the early 1980s, Southern abandoned its tracks south of Blackville, ending rail service to Barnwell, Allendale, Lena, and Furman. However, by the 1970s, any rail service to Furman (through Lena) would have been a rare event.http://www.greenspun.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch- msg.tcl?msg_id=003MQy Nearby Estill was founded at about the same time as Lena. Estill (originally named ‚ÄúLawtonville,‚Äù was renamed for the president of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad which laid tracks through what is now Estill at about the same time Southern was laying tracks through what is today's Lena. Lena was named for Allene Thomson Lawton, whose father, Thomas Oregon Lawton, owned land that Southern workers camped on. Since the name Allene was too similar to the nearby established town of Allendale, the nickname ‚ÄúLena,‚Äù which her father called her, was selected as the name of Southern's station in what is now Lena.

It is a reddish yellow or green crystalline material. It is a primary explosive. Anhydrous potassium picrate forms orthorhombic crystals.  History  Potassium picrate was first prepared as impure in mid-17th century by Johann Rudolf Glauber by dissolving wood in nitric acid and neutralizing with potassium carbonate. It is commonly made by neutralizing picric acid by potassium carbonate. It was used since 1869. Its chief applications are in pyrotechnics, in some whistle mixes, as a component of explosives (with potassium nitrate and charcoal), propellants (with potassium chlorate), and explosive primers (with lead picrate and potassium chlorate).  Description  Potassium picrate is not a very powerful explosive. It is somewhat shock-sensitive. In contact with flame it deflagrates with a loud sound. If ignited in confined space, it will detonate. It is more sensitive than picric acid. In contact with metals (e.g. lead, calcium, iron), potassium picrate, like ammonium picrate and picric acid, forms picrates of said metals. These are often more dangerous and more sensitive explosives. Contact with such materials therefore should be prevented. Potassium picrate is used to determine the concentration of nonionic surfactants in water; materials detectable by this method are called potassium picrate active substances (PPAS).  Synthesis  As with other picrates, potassium picrate may be produced by the neutralization of picric acid with the corresponding carbonate. As picric acid is barely soluble in water the reaction must be done in an appropriate solvent like methanol. First dissolving the picric acid in methanol and then adding potassium carbonate will result in potassium picrate. Temperature control is important to prevent detonation or excessive methanol evaporation.  Sensitivity  According to Urbanski, Potassium picrate detonated 10% of the time when struck by a mass of 2kg dropped from the height of 21cm. By comparison, the more sensitive anhydrous lead picrate detonated 10% of the time when struck by the same mass dropped from the height of 2cm.
