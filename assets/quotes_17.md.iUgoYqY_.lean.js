He played at wing for the national team, the Springboks. After winning an IRB Under-21 World Cup gold medal for South Africa in 2002, the hard-working wing set about gaining much needed Super 12 experience with the Cats (now called the Lions). Willemse's pace, speed and power contributed to him being selected for his test debut against Scotland and he did not look back. He was included in the South Africa 2003 Rugby World Cup squad and scored a spectacular solo try against Samoa. Willemse's achievements of 2003 were topped by scooping up the top three awards at the annual SA Rugby function - Player of the Year, Most Promising Player of the Year and Players' Player of the Year. Willemse was badly injured for most of the 2004–2006 seasons. However, he was selected for the Springbok squad during the 2007 international season and Tri nations, and was selected for the 2007 Rugby World Cup squad. He then signed a two-year contract with Biarritz Olympique, joining a host of other top Springboks choosing to continue their careers abroad after RWC 2007. Willemse subsequently retired from international rugby stating \\"there are no controversial issues around my decision at all. I love the team, and the guys are exceptional. It was such a breath of fresh air being able to return to the Lions after some time overseas last year, and it has been so exciting.

No intervention happened before the incident occurred from the broadcaster Supersport, even when it was clear with the larger knowledgeable rugby supporters that there was friction and major difference of opinion between the rugby personalities for years. In May 2018, while providing live analysis, Willemse walked off the Supersport set, as a result of conflicts with his co-presenters, Nick Mallett and Naas Botha. Willemse insinuated that his actions were a result of racism on the part of Mallett and Botha. An independent enquiry into the incident disproved the allegations.

His highest rank was komusubi. Career Wakanoyama made his professional debut in March 1988. Joining at the same time as him were future yokozuna Akebono, Takanohana and Wakanohana, and ōzeki Kaiō. He began wrestling under his own surname, Nishizaki, but from November 1989 onwards adopted the shikona of Wakanoyama, the name adapted from his home prefecture. He reached sekitori status in July 1991 upon promotion to the second highest jūryō division, and made his debut in the top makuuchi division in May 1992. However, he lasted only four tournaments there before being demoted back to jūryō. Although he reappeared in makuuchi once in September 1994, he could not stay there. In July 1996 he fell back to the unsalaried makushita division where he languished for thirteen tournaments, before winning promotion back to jūryō in November 1998 and makuuchi in July 1999. Wakanoyama had been absent from the top division for 28 tournaments. No other wrestler had ever managed to return to makuuchi after so long away. His remarkable comeback may have been helped by the fact that during this period his stable, Musashigawa, had become one of the strongest in sumo, with a yokozuna (Musashimaru), and three soon to reach ōzeki (Musōyama, Dejima and Miyabiyama). Wakanoyama was certainly not short of strong training partners. Wakanoyama was able to hold his own in the top division this time, rising slowly up the rankings. In March 2000, ranked at maegashira 1, he faced yokozuna Wakanohana on the opening day. The last time the two had fought was eight years previously in May 1992. This is the longest ever gap between meetings in the top division. Wakanoyama lost the match and fell short with a 6-9 record, but in January 2001 he scored 9-6 at maegashira 3 and won his first ever special prize. In the following tournament he was promoted to komusubi, the highest rank he was to achieve. He was the first non-foreign and non-college wrestler from his stable to reach a sanyaku rank. He fought his last tournament in the top division in March 2004, and retired in September 2005 at the age of thirty three. Retirement from sumo Wakanoyama remained in the sumo world as an elder, or oyakata, affiliated to Musashigawa stable where he worked as a coach under the name Yamawake-oyataka. However, he left the Sumo Association in September 2010. Fighting style Wakanoyama was a pusher-thruster, preferring tsuki/oshi techniques to fighting on the mawashi. His most common winning kimarite was a straightforward oshi-dashi, or push out.

It is located in Tolleshunt Knights, near Maldon, Essex, in England, and is the oldest Orthodox religious community in the UK. The religious community was founded in 1958 by Elder Sophrony,University of Lampeter website under the jurisdiction of Metropolitan Anthony, Metropolitan of Sourozh and ruling Russian bishop in England, with six monastics from a number of nations; soon after, in 1965, the monastery moved under the direct jurisdiction of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. The community is distinctive in that it is a double monastery, consisting of both women and men living the monastic tradition of a Christ-centred prayer life. Currently, there are just under 40 monastics in the community, the majority of whom are nuns, with a smaller number of monks. After the death of Elder Sophrony in 1993 the Archimandrite was Father Kyrillos. Since his retirement in 2019 the Archimandrite has been Father Peter (born 1977).New abbot elected for St. John’s Monastery in Essex - Website of the Serbian Orthodox Church in the UK Daily life When founding the monastery, Elder Sophrony wanted to be sure that his community would not just have outward conformity, but have its focus on inner asceticism. The typikon of the monastery, consisting of repetition of the Jesus Prayer for approximately four hours per day and Divine Liturgy three or four times per week, found inspiration in Elder Sophrony's experience in the Athonite desert, and precedent in Athonite skete practise, St Nicodemus and St Paisius Velichkovsky. Also, another distinctive part of this monastery is that it is a double monastery. That is, the community has both monks and nuns in separate residential quarters. This is rare, but is not unheard of, in Orthodox monasticism. History The Patriarchal Stavropegic Monastery of St John the Baptist had its beginnings largely in the person of Elder Sophrony. After his departure from Mt Athos, where he had been a disciple of Saint Silouan the Athonite, and his subsequent move to Paris, he was to live in a Russian old-people's home, assisting the priest there. Soon, two men would seek out Elder Sophrony, desiring the monastic life. They were allowed to live at the old-people's home, using the repetition of the Jesus Prayer in lieu of liturgical books and eating the food that the old-age inhabitants did not eat. There were also a few nuns living at the home at this time.Archdiocese of Thyateira and Great Britain By 1958, Elder Sophrony had six people living around him, seeking the monastic life. Realising that such a situation could not continue, he went to Tolleshunt Knights, near Maldon, Essex, England, to inspect a property; in early 1959, the new Community of St John the Baptist was formed at the same property, under Metropolitan Anthony's omophorion. The monastery, from its beginnings, had both monks and nuns, due to Elder Sophrony being unable to oversee two separate communities. The Monastery of St John the Baptist moved under the omophorion of the Ecumenical Patriarchate in 1965, becoming patriarchal; later, the monastery would also be titled Stavropegic. =Death of Elder Sophrony= The monastery had been informed that the only way that it could bury people on its property was to build an underground crypt, which it proceeded to build, and to which Elder Sophrony said that he would not repose until the crypt was ready. Then, having been told of the expected completion date of 12 July 1993, Elder Sophrony stated that he \\"would be ready\\". On 11 July, Elder Sophrony died; and his funeral and burial were held three days later, attended by monastics from around the world. Mother Elizabeth, the eldest nun, died soon after on 24 July, according to Elder Sophrony's words that he would die first, and she would die soon after.On Prayer By Archimandrite Sophrony, Translated by Rosemary Edmonds Published by St Vladimir's Seminary Press, 1999 Cycle of services Saturday: 7:00 am - Hours and Divine Liturgy ::5:00-9:00 pm - Vigil Sunday: 7:00 am - Hours and Divine Liturgy and a second Divine Liturgy at 10:15 am ::3:00 pm - Vespers and Paraklesis, followed by talks in Greek and English Daily: 6.00-8:30 am (except when the Divine Liturgy is served) and 5:30-8:00 pm - Repetition of the Jesus Prayer Tuesday and Thursday: 7:00 am - Hours and Divine Liturgy Feastdays: Vigil on the preceding evening; Hours and Divine Liturgy in the morning. Publishing One of the motivating factors behind Elder Sophrony's move to France was the publishing of St Silouan's books. When Elder Sophrony moved to England, the monastery became the publisher of these works. In 1973, a more complete translation of the life of St Silouan, titled Monk of Mt Athos, was published; followed in 1975 by Wisdom of Mt Athos, a collation of the writings of St Silouan. After this, Elder Sophrony began to publish books of his own, beginning with His Life is Mine in 1977 and then We Shall See Him As He Is in 1985. In 1987, the Holy Synod of the Ecumenical Patriarchate glorified St Silouan the Athonite. =Books published by the monastery= * Monk of Mt Athos, by Archimandrite Sophrony (Sakharov), 1973 * Wisdom of Mt Athos, by Archimandrite Sophrony (Sakharov), 1975 * His Life is Mine, by Archimandrite Sophrony (Sakharov), 1977 * We Shall See Him As He Is, by Archimandrite Sophrony (Sakharov), 1985 * Service of Our Father among the Saints Nectarius: Bishop of Pentapolis, by Gerasimos Mikragiannaniteis * Conversations with Children: Communicating our Faith, by Sister Magdalen, 2001 Notable inhabitants Archimandrite Kyrillos * Archimandrite Sophrony, the first abbot, 1959-1993 * Archimandrite Kyrillos, second abbot, 1993-2019 * Sister Magdalen, noted speaker, author of Children in the Church Today and Conversations with Children: Communicating our Faith.Children in the Church Today: An Orthodox Perspective By Sister Magdalen, Published by St Vladimir's Seminary Press, 1991 St. George Orthodox Christian Cathedral * Sister Maria, mosaic iconographer.Sister Maria and the Monastery of St John the Baptist  See also  * Fahr Convent Sources *I Love Therefore I Am, by Hmk Nicholas V Sakharov.

Career Nauseef briefly toured the United Kingdom in 1972 as tour member of The Velvet Underground before joining Elf, fronted by Ronnie James Dio, in early 1975, but the group disbanded shortly afterwards. Accompanied by Elf keyboardist Mickey Lee Soule, Nauseef joined ex-Deep Purple singer Ian Gillan in his new jazz fusion group, simply named the Ian Gillan Band. After three albums, Gillan broke the group up in 1978. Nauseef stood in for Thin Lizzy drummer Brian Downey for two international tours, then joined Gary Moore's short-lived band G-Force. During the 1980s, Nauseef moved away from rock music towards a wide range of styles, including Javanese and Balinese gamelan, as well as music of Indian and Ghanaian origin. He has released several solo albums and worked with many other musicians in an array of different projects. Nauseef has performed and/or recorded with such artists as Joachim Kühn, Gary Moore, Jack Bruce, Bill Laswell, Glenn Hughes, Rabih Abou-Khalil, Trilok Gurtu, Steve Swallow, L. Shankar, Hamza El Din, The Velvet Underground, Joëlle Léandre, Ikue Mori, Ronnie James Dio, Markus Stockhausen, Kyai Kunbul (Javanese Gamelan), Andy Summers, Tony Oxley, Tomasz Stanko, Kenny Wheeler, Edward Vesala's \\"Sound and Fury\\", Thelma Houston, David Torn, The Ladzekpo Brothers (Ghanaian music and dance), Charlie Mariano, The Gamelan Orchestra of Saba (Balinese Gamelan), Kudsi Erguner, Philip Lynott, George Lewis, Evan Parker and Lou Harrison. Throughout most of these projects Nauseef has collaborated with Walter Quintus. Nauseef attended the California Institute of the Arts where he studied Javanese Gamelan with K.R.T. Wasitodiningrat, Balinese Gamelan with I Nyoman Wenten, North Indian Pakhawaj drumming with Pandit Taranath Rao, North Indian music theory with Pandit Amiya Dasgupta, Ghanaian drumming and dance with Kobla and Alfred Ladzekpo, Dzidzorgbe Lawluvi and C.K. Ganyo, and 20th Century Western percussion techniques and hand drumming with John Bergamo. He also studied frame drum techniques of the Middle East, India and the Caucasus with Glen Velez. It was also at CalArts that Nauseef began a very creative and productive relationship, which continues to this day, with musical \\"alter ego\\", guitarist Miroslav Tadic. Together, they have composed, recorded and produced a wide range of music in situations from duo to large ensembles with musicians from around the world. Nauseef has also worked as a producer. In addition to his own recordings, he has produced many records of various types of music including modern experimental forms as well as traditional forms. Traditional music productions include numerous recordings of traditional Balinese and Javanese music such as the acclaimed and award-winning \\"The Music of K.R.T. Wasitodiningrat\\" which was recorded in Java and features Wasitodiningrat's compositions. Other examples include the Balinese ensemble recordings \\"Gamelan Batel Wayang Ramayana\\" and \\"Gender Wayang Pemarwan\\" which were recorded in Bali. These recordings and many others of Indonesian music were produced for the CMP 3000 \\"World Series\\" with the production team of Kurt Renker And Walter Quintus. The \\"Worlds Series\\", which Nauseef was instrumental in establishing, was founded by CMP owner and producer Kurt Renker and produces recordings from a variety of non-western countries including India, Turkey, Korea, Indonesia and others.

WVBE-FM is owned and operated by Mel Wheeler, Inc.. and is simulcast on WVBB 97.7 FM in Elliston- Lafayette, Virginia. A simulcast was offered on 610 AM in Roanoke, Virginia until 2016 when it flipped to sports. History WVBE-FM 100.1 began its history in 1948 as WWOD-FM, originally at 940 watts. It had a sister station on 1390, WWOD, now WPLI. WWOD-AM was the second station to go on in Lynchburg after WLVA-AM. WWOD-FM was religious until it became WKZZ on May 12, 1979 and carried a country format until April 1, 1984, when it became a locally programmed CHR format until 1991. On November 21, 1991, the station was purchased by Aylett Coleman of Roanoke and began a simulcast with CHR formatted WXLK \\"K92\\" in Roanoke to provide an improved signal in Lynchburg and took the call sign WLYK, which stood for \\"Lynchburg's K92.\\" The following year, WLYK boosted power, going from a Class A to Class C3 station. The stations were later sold a few years after Coleman's death to Mel Wheeler Inc. On April 19, 2001, the station became Vibe 100, with an R&B; format, changing calls to WVBE-FM on March 13, 2002. The change was necessitated by the addition of the former WSLC-AM as a Roanoke-based simulcast signal for \\"Vibe 100\\", which took the calls WVBE.

Basically, a tube is a cylindrical, hollow piece with a round or oval profile, made of plastic, paperboard, aluminum, or other metal. In general, on one end of the tube body there is a round orifice, which can be closed by different caps and closures. The orifice can be shaped in many different ways: plastic nozzles in various styles and lengths are most typical. The other end is sealed either by welding or by folding. Typical tube sizes range from 3ml to 300ml.Adhesive Materials Group, \\"Collapsible Tube Packaging\\" Most tubes are designed to be dispensed with hand pressure, but some are used with a tube key at the base to help roll them up. Applications Many commodities are commonly sold in collapsible tubes: * toothpaste, formerly metal, now of plastic. * viscous artists' paint, including oil paint, acrylic paint, and concentrated watercolor paints (which must be diluted with water); typically metal; * some pastes used in food, such as anchovy paste, tomato paste, mustard, mayonnaise; * some pharmaceutical ointments; * small quantities of caulk, glues, and sealants  larger quantities may use rigid caulk cartridges; * various other cosmetics and gels. *before 1980, in USSR tubes were used as containers for space food. Materials =Aluminum= Aluminum tube caps and closures are generally threaded, as is the nozzle. Aluminium tubes generally have the far end folded several times after the contents have been added. The tube is typically hermetically sealed and nearly germ-free due to the high temperatures during the production process. The inside of the tube can be coated to prevent the material from reacting with the contents. Aluminum tubes are produced by impact extrusion from a small round blank. Designs can be printed onto the tube, using the wet-in-wet offset printing method. Six tones are often used. The filled content can be squeezed out by finger pressure. The main characteristic of aluminium tubes is the total separation of the contents from the surrounding atmosphere; therefore, such tubes are especially suitable for the packaging of highly perishable contents. Aluminium tubes are used for cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, food, paint, and technical products. =Plastic= Tubes can also be produced in plastic, most commonly polyethylene. Plastic tubes are used for cosmetics such as hand creams, and also some foodstuffs. The plastic tube retains its shape after each squeeze unlike laminate tubes such as toothpaste tubes. Plastic tubes can be highly decorated or have a special additive such as soft touch to make the tube more appealing during use or at the point of sale. A multi-layer plastic tube 5 Layer Tube Extrusion Line Plastic tubes are produced by extrusion. A sleeve is first produced on a specialised extrusion machine. It must be produced to a very high standard (for decoration purposes) and also to tight tolerances, compatible with automated processes after extrusion. Once the sleeve is produced, the tube head is fitted using an automated heading machine. Tube printing using specialised printing machines such as silk screen printing applies the desired decoration. The open tubes are typically filled and sealed at a separate facility. Multi-layer plastic tubes have become increasingly popular; they isolate the contents better from the air, allowing them to be used for a wider range of products, such as food. =Other metals= The earliest collapsible tubes were made of tin, zinc, or lead, sometimes coated with wax on the inside.Steve Hollier, \\"On this day: in 1892, toothpaste in a tube was patented\\" History John Goffe Rand, an American portrait painter, invented the squeezable metal tube in 1841 for paint.\\"Collapsible\\", The New Yorker, August 6, 1960, p. 20 In 1870, Henry Palmer of Stillwater, New York patented a screw-top collapsible \\"capsule\\" intended for the storage of condensed medicinal extracts; he suggested tin as a possible material.Henry L.

The A.I aircraft resembled a substantially enlarged Fokker M.5, with a tall dorsal cabane structure to handle the triple sets of stationary flying and landing wires anchored to the wing panels' forward spar, each panel having fourteen wing ribs, and the similarly triple sets of wing warping cables attached to the rear spar. The A.I and earlier A.IIs were both built by Fokker and license-built by Halberstadt. The origins of the A.I, A.II and A.III were in a Morane-Saulnier Type H purchased from France. This led to the initial Fokker M.5 airframe designed by Martin Kreutzer, from which the larger A.I was derived. Fokker gave many aerobatic demonstrations in the M.5 on the eve of World War I. The M.8, was ordered as the A.I by the Fliegertruppe (Imperial German Army Air Service) and between Fokker and Halberstadt, about 63 were produced. Specifications Data from Scott, Josef (2012).

He is the father of the Cluysenaar family.  Family  He was born in Kampen in the Netherlands as a son of Joannes Kluysenaar and Garidenia Kluysenaar, a Dutch family of architects and engineers. Jean-Pierre Cluysenaar was the father of the Cluysenaar family. His descendants became famous Belgian painters, sculptors and architects. During the United Kingdom of the Netherlands his family settled in the southern Belgian provinces.  Career  Cluysenaar studied architecture at the Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts in Brussels under Tilman-François Suys. His teacher influenced him in his preference for the architecture of the Italian Renaissance. Cluysenaer had a talent for business. He took the initiative for some very profitable real estate projects - such as the Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert in Brussels - in which he played the double role of architect and co-financier. He also had a good reputation amongst the Belgian nobility and high bourgeoisie. He received many commissions for designing large town houses (so called \\"Hôtels\\"), Mansions and château's. He was always prepared to adapt his designs to the desires and taste of his elite patrons. The many private mansions he built greatly differ in style. Cluysenaar designed elegant Palladian villa's as well as more sturdy Gothic Revival castles. His stylistic versatility is also apparent in the many public buildings he designed such as the Neo-Renaissance, Koninklijk Conservatorium/Conservatoire Royal in Brussels and the \\"Tudor style\\" railway station in Aalst.

Background The point distribution model concept has been developed by Cootes, Taylor et al. and became a standard in computer vision for the statistical study of shape and for segmentation of medical images where shape priors really help interpretation of noisy and low- contrasted pixels/voxels. The latter point leads to active shape models (ASM) and active appearance models (AAM). Point distribution models rely on landmark points. A landmark is an annotating point posed by an anatomist onto a given locus for every shape instance across the training set population. For instance, the same landmark will designate the tip of the index finger in a training set of 2D hands outlines. Principal component analysis (PCA), for instance, is a relevant tool for studying correlations of movement between groups of landmarks among the training set population. Typically, it might detect that all the landmarks located along the same finger move exactly together across the training set examples showing different finger spacing for a flat-posed hands collection. Details First, a set of training images are manually landmarked with enough corresponding landmarks to sufficiently approximate the geometry of the original shapes. These landmarks are aligned using the generalized procrustes analysis, which minimizes the least squared error between the points. k aligned landmarks in two dimensions are given as :\\\\mathbf{X} = (x_1, y_1, \\\\ldots, x_k, y_k). It's important to note that each landmark i \\\\in \\\\lbrace 1, \\\\ldots k \\\\rbrace should represent the same anatomical location. For example, landmark #3, (x_3, y_3) might represent the tip of the ring finger across all training images. Now the shape outlines are reduced to sequences of k landmarks, so that a given training shape is defined as the vector \\\\mathbf{X} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{2k}. Assuming the scattering is gaussian in this space, PCA is used to compute normalized eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix across all training shapes. The matrix of the top d eigenvectors is given as \\\\mathbf{P} \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R}^{2k \\\\times d}, and each eigenvector describes a principal mode of variation along the set. Finally, a linear combination of the eigenvectors is used to define a new shape \\\\mathbf{X}', mathematically defined as: :\\\\mathbf{X}' = \\\\overline{\\\\mathbf{X}} + \\\\mathbf{P} \\\\mathbf{b} where \\\\overline{\\\\mathbf{X}} is defined as the mean shape across all training images, and \\\\mathbf{b} is a vector of scaling values for each principal component. Therefore, by modifying the variable \\\\mathbf{b} an infinite number of shapes can be defined. To ensure that the new shapes are all within the variation seen in the training set, it is common to only allow each element of \\\\mathbf{b} to be within \\\\pm3 standard deviations, where the standard deviation of a given principal component is defined as the square root of its corresponding eigenvalue. PDM's can be extended to any arbitrary number of dimensions, but are typically used in 2D image and 3D volume applications (where each landmark point is \\\\mathbb{R}^2 or \\\\mathbb{R}^3). Discussion An eigenvector, interpreted in euclidean space, can be seen as a sequence of k euclidean vectors associated to corresponding landmark and designating a compound move for the whole shape. Global nonlinear variation is usually well handled provided nonlinear variation is kept to a reasonable level. Typically, a twisting nematode worm is used as an example in the teaching of kernel PCA-based methods. Due to the PCA properties: eigenvectors are mutually orthogonal, form a basis of the training set cloud in the shape space, and cross at the 0 in this space, which represents the mean shape. Also, PCA is a traditional way of fitting a closed ellipsoid to a Gaussian cloud of points (whatever their dimension): this suggests the concept of bounded variation. The idea behind PDM's is that eigenvectors can be linearly combined to create an infinity of new shape instances that will 'look like' the one in the training set. The coefficients are bounded alike the values of the corresponding eigenvalues, so as to ensure the generated 2n/3n-dimensional dot will remain into the hyper-ellipsoidal allowed domain—allowable shape domain (ASD).

Background  The Soviet Moonsund Landing Operation on 29 September 1944 had quickly gained ground. The smaller island of Muhu (Moon) was given up with little organized resistance, as was Hiiumaa (Dago). On 5 October, the Soviets landed on Saaremaa. In a reversal of the fighting in 1941, the Germans conducted a quick fighting withdrawal, and planned to make a stand on the easily defendable peninsula of Sõrve (Sworbe).  German forces  Two infantry battalions from the German 67th Potsdam Grenadier Regiment from the 23rd Infantry Division (Wehrmacht) had occupied a defensive position on the Nasva river, just west of the city of Kuressaare (Arensburg). They were a part of Kampfgruppe Eulenburg, most of which already had taken up positions on the Sõrve peninsula. The first and second battalions were commanded by Hauptmaenner (captains) H. Ulrichs and Klaus Ritter, respectively. Together, the reduced battalions mustered about 700–750 men. As they were unable to communicate with their parent unit and they felt increasingly isolated, towards midnight on the 8th the order was given to retreat to Sõrve.  Soviet forces  Meanwhile, bypassing the German position on the Nasva, Soviet units moved south to occupy positions astride the main road leading to the peninsula. These were elements of the 307th anti-tank Battalion from the Estonian 249th Rifle Division, about 370 men commanded by Major V. Miller. Later that evening, they were joined by the 1st battalion of the 917th regiment, approximately 300 men commanded by Major G. Karaulnov, advancing down a secondary road leading to the small village of Tehumardi, right before the bottleneck of the peninsula. Many of the soldiers in the Soviet units were forcibly conscripted Estonians. Due to lack of reconnaissance, the Soviets were unaware of the withdrawing German units, and the stage was set for a confused night battle when the forces met head-on.  The battle  The battle. Germans in blue, Soviets in red. The Germans' fear of being stragglers soon proved correct, as the only road already had been cratered by other withdrawing German units. Bypassing this obstacle took some time, the vehicles were slowly pulled across with the help of a recently captured US-made M3 Stuart light tank. Suspecting an enemy presence, the soldiers were ordered to keep as silent as possible, breaking through the enemy positions with a sudden attack. The two battalions split up, the 1st moving along the waterline, the 2nd moving along the main road in parallel, about 200 m distant. Soon the 2nd found themselves marching alongside a Soviet unit, who, believing them to be fellow Soviets, gave way. Flares fired gave the game away, and battle started. The Soviets, the 1st battalion of the 917th was quickly overwhelmed, but the Germans then ran into the anti-tank positions of the 370th. The battle degenerated into chaotic hand-to-hand combat in the darkness, with heavy losses on both sides, but the Germans broke through. Their actions kept the Soviets occupied, however, and the 1st battalion moving along the waterline took no part in the fighting and suffered no losses.  Aftermath  The majority of the Germans were able to break through to join the defence of the Sõrve peninsula, but almost 200 men had been lost. Captured German soldiers were shot, as happened consistently during the fighting on the island. Most of the vehicles were also left behind, including the light tank and a self- propelled FlaK gun. The Soviets also suffered about 200 men killed, with an unknown number of wounded. The killed included the commander, Major V. Miller. At least one tank and several guns were also knocked out. The action delayed the Soviet attack on the peninsula, giving the Germans more time to improve their defences. But the hard-pressed German forces could ill afford losses in equipment and manpower at this stage of the war. After several weeks more of bitter fighting, the Sõrve peninsula, and thereby the entire island of Saaremaa, was evacuated by the Germans on the 23/24 November.  After the war  Tehumardi war memorial To commemorate the battle, in 1967 the Soviets raised a gigantic, typical Soviet-style sword-shaped monument made of concrete and dolomite. Several massive concrete slabs with names of the fallen Soviets are mounted nearby. Most Soviets were buried on the site. Little care was given to the fallen Germans; as a consequence, most remain missing.

To this was added a central nacelle with two seven-cylinder 80 hp Oberursel U.0 rotary engines, one at either end, in a centerline thrust configuration. The crew of three included a pilot in the nacelle, and one gunner positioned at the nose of each fuselage. Mounting the two fuselages on the wings with no connection between them further aft turned out to be a mistake. Fokker was still using wing warping instead of ailerons for roll control, so when the wings were warped, the fuselages were deflected in opposite directions, either up or down depending upon which way the aircraft was rolled. This led to some very divergent flight characteristics. The test program was brief.

(Cornell University) and Harper R. (Carnegie Mellon University). Informatics: 10 Years Back, 10 Years Ahead. (2000) A very common strategy of guaranteeing that such operations are impossible is to base the system around a high-level language, such as Java, whose design precludes dangerous constructs; many are entirely written in such a language, with only the minimum amount of low-level code being used. Since language-based systems can assure ahead of time that they cannot do things that can damage the system (such as corrupting memory by dereferencing dangling pointers), it is possible for them to avoid expensive address space switches needed by traditional OSes; because of this, microkernels are more popular than traditional systems. A more extreme form of this is a high-level language computer architecture, where the trusted base is pushed into hardware, and the entire system is written in a high-level language.

During the First World War the Imperial and Royal Aviation Troops (colloquially known as the Austro-Hungarian Air Service or K.u.K.

Katin was educated at private schools in Balham, Caterham, and East Grinstead and the Henry Thornton School (then known as the South West London Emergency Secondary School) in Clapham, and was admitted to the Royal Academy of Music at the age of 12, four years younger than the official entry age, where he studied under Harold Craxton. Katin made his debut at the Wigmore Hall on 13 December 1948 where the programme included works by Scarlatti, Mozart, Beethoven, Rachmaninoff, Scriabin and Chopin. He went on to give concerts in England, Europe, Africa, the US, and Japan. In 1952, Katin debuted at The Proms and in 1953 was acclaimed for his performance there of Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 3 in D minor. In 1958, he became the first British pianist to make a post-war solo tour of the Soviet Union. In 1961, the composer Bryan Kelly wrote Tango especially for Katin. Katin specialised in Romantic music, particularly Chopin, and Impressionist music. He was acclaimed for his technical command of the piano. He also directed concertos by Mozart and Beethoven from the keyboard. His final Wigmore Hall recital was in January 2004. Katin wrote many articles on piano technique and interpretation. He lectured at the Royal Academy of Music 1956–1959, University of Western Ontario 1978–1984, and in 1992 was appointed to the Royal College of Music. He also lectured at Thames Valley University.

It is largely based on the events that happened in the 'Plague Village' of Eyam in Derbyshire, between September 1665 and December 1666.Historical background BBC Local History - Derbyshire, Feb 2004 Published in 1970, The Roses of Eyam had its world premiere at The Northcott Theatre in Exeter, Devon on 23 September 1970.‘The Roses of Eyam’ at Maddog. June 2005 Description The script requires a large cast, within which there must be a core of actors prepared to learn extensive parts and portray passionate and sustained emotion. The play best suits an atmospheric setting such as a Norman church or Restoration Manor House, where it can be performed in the round. Taylor himself filmed the story for television in 1973.IMDB details Information on the 1973 TV production. The Roses of Eyam was originally intended for an adult audience but has become part of children's theatre. The play is now also a set text in many British schools for students of English Literature and Drama. TV production A television production of The Roses of Eyam was broadcast on BBC2 on 12 June 1973 and produced at the BBC's Pebble Mill Studios. Don Taylor himself adapted the stage play for television and he directed it. Outline It begins as educated Anglican clergyman the Reverend William Mompesson receives the living from his benefactors, the Saville Genealogical evidence of this William Mompesson of Eyam (1639-1709) at Genealogy UK and Ireland. Rosemary Lockie , March 2007 family. A 'King's Man', he is replacing the previous Puritan incumbent, Thomas Stanley who has refused to comply with the 1662 Act of Uniformity which makes use of the Anglican Book of Common Prayer compulsory. The early part of the play establishes that the village is still divided between Royalist and Roundhead sympathisers. Meanwhile, local tailor George Vicars takes delivery of a large consignment of cloth from London. Within days the village is stricken by plague. Families shut themselves away in their homes fearing that contact with others will invite the infection. With the onset of cold weather in autumn the number of cases falls but rises again when the warm weather comes in spring. An exodus of the village begins but Mompesson and Stanley put aside their differences to persuade the villagers to stay put until the plague is over. The villagers are reminded that if they leave they will be welcome nowhere and will die as outcasts and vagrants, taking many other innocents with them. The villagers voluntarily decide to isolate themselves. Food is left for them by the county High Sheriff at stones marking the limits of the quarantine. As the play evolves the audience moves from location to location and the action intensifies as the village empties. Some villagers build shacks in the hills, or live in caves, to be away from the infection. The deaths continue through the summer with hardly anyone left to bury the dead. Grass grows in the village streets. Both rectors have doubts at their actions but eventually the dying ceases and the survivors learn they have been successful with no other cases of plague occurring in the county. Some humour is included by the mad orphan boy \\"Bedlam\\" who sings and dances through the worst times and the two cantankerous old yokels Unwin and Merril. In some productions each corpse reappears in ghostly white make-up until the audience is surrounded by keening wraiths.

Charlton Source: Library and Archives Canada John Charlton (February 3, 1829 – 11 February 1910) was a Canadian Member of Parliament and businessman. Charlton was the Member of Parliament for Norfolk North, Ontario for 32 years until 1904. He was the author of \\"Parliamentary Recollections\\" and contributed to the North American Review. Born in Garbuttsville, New York, John was the eldest son of Adam Charlton of Newcastle upon Tyne, England. He was first educated in McLaren Grammar School of Caledonia, New York before moving to the Springville Academy in the state. Interested in bettering himself, he studied medicine, the law, and public speaking. In 1849, at the age of twenty, he moved with his parents to Ayr, in Dumfries Township, Ontario, and became a farmer. Charlton's interest in educating himself continued led to him helping to start a library in the town of Ayr. In 1853, he moved to Lynedoch and opened a general store with his uncle and future father-in-law George Gray. Charlton married Ella Gray, daughter of George Gray of Charlotteville, Ontario, in 1854. His next career move was to become the Canadian Manager for the lumber company of Messieurs Smith & Westover of Town of Tonawanda, New York in 1859. Charlton was first elected to the House of Commons in 1871, as member of the Liberal Party of Canada. He had strong religious views and high ideals, was a strong advocate for provincial rights, and worked for years for passage of a law affording protection to women and girls under a certain age. His speeches were considered blunt and brusque compared to his contemporaries. After a tour of the United States in 1897, Charlton served on the Joint High Commission between Great Britain, Canada and the United States from 1898 to 1899. His wife, Ella Gray, died in 1905, and Charlton entered a marriage with Cora J. Owen in 1907. He died of a stroke at his home in Lynedoch in 1910. References * Charlton, John.

Hughes Day Rudd (September 14, 1921 in Waco, Texas - October 13, 1992 in Toulouse, France) was a television journalist and CBS News and ABC News correspondent. Rudd was known for his folksy style, gravelly voice, and unimposing sense of humor, often ending his newscasts with human interest stories that sometimes made him break into a chuckle on camera. Known life and career =College years and wartime Army service= Rudd attended the University of Missouri from 1938 to 1941 before enlisting in the U.S. Army during World War II. Flying Piper Cubs as an artillery spotter pilot in Africa and Europe, Rudd earned a Purple Heart, six Air Medals and a Silver Star. =News career= Print journalism beginnings Following World War II, Rudd began his journalism career writing for several newspapers, including the Kansas City Star, the Minneapolis Tribune and the Rock Springs (Wyo.) Daily Rocket and Sunday Miner. Television news career Rudd got his first position at CBS News as a writer through the influence of his friend Walter Cronkite. Rudd reported from around the world, including tours as a correspondent in Bonn, Berlin, and Moscow. He was an anchor of the CBS Morning News from 1973 to 1977 when the CBS morning news program was more of a news summary similar to the format of The CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite. At times, Rudd was paired with various other CBS anchors, including, briefly in 1973, Sally Quinn, and later, Bruce Morton and Richard Threlkeld, the latter two based in Washington. In the middle of 1979, Rudd was recruited to ABC News by Roone Arledge. Human-interest stories, especially humorous or touching show-ender stories, became his hallmark. One of his assignments was as announcer for ABC's Wide World of Sports.Classic Wide World of Sports: Episode 10 - TV.com =Later years and death= Always a Francophile, after his retirement from journalism in 1986, Rudd moved to Valence-d'Albigeois in the department of the Tarn in southwestern France with his wife, Ann. Rudd's book, My Escape From the C.I.A. and Other Improbable Events, a collection of quasi- autobiographical fiction, was published in 1976 by E. P. Dutton & Company. On October 13, 1992, Rudd died of an aneurysm at a hospital in Toulouse, at the age of 71. His remains were cremated, and as he was a World War II Army veteran, his ashes were buried at Arlington National Cemetery. =News honors= The journalism awards that Rudd won included a George Foster Peabody Award for his creative writing on the CBS Morning News in 1977.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. It is an active Anglican parish church in the diocese of Chester, the archdeaconry of Chester and the deanery of Chester. Its benefice is combined with that of St John the Baptist's Church, Guilden Sutton. History The recorded history of the church goes back to the 7th century. The present church is believed to be built on the site where Plegmund, later Archbishop of Canterbury, lived as a hermit in the 9th century. The surrounding land used to be a marsh and the church stands in a slightly elevated area which was known as \\"The Isle of Chester\\". The original church was built in the 12th century but the present building dates mostly from the 15th century. This was financed by the Trafford family who lived locally. A tower was added at the west end in 1826. Inscriptions in the church show that there were restorations in 1684, 1711, 1802–03 and 1819. Death watch beetle was found in some roof rafters and the church was re-roofed in 1958. Electric light was installed in the church in 1966 and central hearing was installed in 1968. Since then a toilet and an entrance for disabled people have been built on to the vestry on the north side. In 2006 new lighting was fitted in the church. The pews were removed from the Barnston Chapel and replaced by modern chairs. Architecture =Exterior= The church is built in red sandstone with a roof of Welsh slate in late Perpendicular style. The plan consists of a five-bay nave and a chancel in one range, a north aisle with a chapel at its east end, and a south porch. The tower has two bands and a cornice with a castellated parapet and crocketed finials. The porch, which was added in the 16th century, has grooves into which barriers could be inserted to prevent livestock from entering the church. =Interior= Internally there is a much- restored hammerbeam roof. Rev. Joseph Hooker Toogood, who was the incumbent from 1907 to 1946, was responsible for much of the woodwork in the church. Richards quotes a letter from him dated 1946 in which Rev Toogood stated that he made improvements to the chancel screen. He then made a new altar, the reredos and panelling for the sanctuary. Subsequently he made the lectern, refurnished much of the north chapel and improved the baptistry, including a new cover for the font. He worked on the choirstalls and their canopy and made figures for the sanctuary niches and an alms box. In addition he carved a list of sidesmen on the west wall and a war memorial on the north wall. The chapel at the east end of the north aisle is known as the Barnston Chapel. It was originally called the Trafford Chapel and was the burial place of the Traffords of Bridge Trafford. The lower part of the chapel screen was carved as a memorial to William de Trafford who was the vicar from 1403 to 1422. The altar in the chapel is Elizabethan in style and was originally the main altar. On the north wall of the chapel are the crests of the Trafford, Barnston and Savage families. It is possible to gain access to the Hurleston family tomb under the altar steps. The baluster altar rails date from the 18th century and the lower panelling of the chancel from the 15th century. To the right of the altar is a carved list of the rectors from 1291. The font dates possibly from the 16th century and its cover has a carving of the Madonna and Child made by Rev Toogood. In the north aisle is a three-decker pulpit with an adjacent two- decker reader's desk dated 1722. The churchwarden's pew is dated 1697; it is over in height, has a panelled back and a canopy supported by twisted columns. The organ dates from 1873 and was made by the Chester firm of Charles Whiteley. It was restored in 2003 by David Wells of Liverpool. A gold-painted inscription to the memory of Rev. Toogood hangs on a wooden plaque to the left of the church door. Fragments of glass dating as far back to the 14th century exist in some windows. There is a ring of three bells, one dated 1635 and the others 1663. The parish registers begin in 1558 and the churchwardens' accounts in 1749. In 1945 the historian Raymond Richards presented to the church five bibles which are kept in a display case in the north aisle. These are a \\"Breeches\\" Bible dated 1608, a King James Bible of 1611, a folio edition of the bible printed by Edward Whitchurche in 1549, a black letter bible of 1549 and a King James Bible of 1623. External features The Hurleston tomb Attached to east end of church are the vault, the tombchest of and a memorial to the Hurleston family. They date from about 1670 and attached is a memorial plaque dated 1727. The vault cover carries a baroque tombchest on an acanthus plinth in ashlar buff sandstone. The long sides have carved recumbent skeletons, one male and one female, with scrolls at the corners. It is listed at Grade II*. Also in the churchyard are three other items which are listed Grade II. A pedestal cenotaph to the memory of Thomas Cawley and others stands by the chancel door. It is built of ashlar buff sandstone and is dated 1795. An 18th-century baluster sundial in buff sandstone is dated 1730. The west wall and the gate of the churchyard are built respectively from ashlar buff sandstone and wrought iron and date from the 19th century.

It was the last Fokker front-line design to use wing warping for roll control as originally designed, before ailerons had been introduced to Fokker combat designs. Design and development The M.19 began as an effort to improve the performance of the Fokker D.II (Fokker designation M.17).Gray and Thetford 1962, p. 92. The M.19 featured the Oberursel U.III 14-cylinder, two-row rotary engine, combined with the two-bay wing cellule of the Fokker D.I. The U.III engine, first used in the Fokker E.IV, required a revised fore-and-aft mount and a strengthened fuselage. The prototype M.19 arrived at Adlershof for testing on 20 July 1916. Idflieg issued a production order for 50 aircraft at that time, followed by orders for an additional 60 aircraft in August and 100 in November. The new aircraft was designated D.III by Idflieg. Operational history The first seven production aircraft were delivered on 1 September 1916.Leaman 2003, p. 23. On that date, two D.III aircraft were ferried from Armee Flug Park 1 to Jagdstaffel 2 at Bertincourt.VanWyngarden 2007, p. 10. Oswald Boelcke received serial 352/16 and obtained seven victories in it between 2 September and 15 September.VanWyngarden 2006, p. 76. While the D.III offered better performance than the D.I and D.II, Boelcke nevertheless found the D.III to be too slow.Weyl 1965, p. 171.Lamberton 1960, p. 120 The D.III was plagued by its U.III engine, which wore out quickly and was difficult to manufacture.Weyl 1965, pp. 122-123. Low compression resulted in poor performance at altitudeWeyl 1965, p. 123. and cooling of the rear row of cylinders proved problematic. Moreover, the D.III offered indifferent maneuverability.Weyl 1965, p. 173. On Boelcke's recommendation, the D.III was withdrawn from heavily contested sectors of the Western Front, but it continued to serve in quieter sectors.Weyl 1965, p. 171. In early October 1916, evaluation of Fokker's M.21 prototype at Adlershof revealed poor construction and workmanship.Leaman 2003, p. 23. In response, Idflieg directed that a production D.III be tested for quality control purposes.Leaman 2003, p. 23. In November 1916, serial 369/16 was disassembled and tested to destruction at Adlershof.Weyl 1965, p. 172. While the wings proved acceptable, the fuselage and tail surfaces failed to meet specifications.Leaman 2003, p. 23.Weyl 1965, p. 172. Idflieg reprimanded Fokker for his firm's substandard construction practices, but permitted D.III production to continue.Leaman 2003, p. 23. The Kogenluft, however, forbade the use of Fokker aircraft for frontline duties.Leaman 2003, p. 23. Fokker built 210 D.III aircraft at its Schwerin factory before production ceased in the spring of 1917. Late production aircraft replaced the wing-warping system with horn-balanced ailerons on the upper wing. Though unsuitable for frontline service, the D.III continued to serve in home defense units until late 1917.Weyl 1965, p. 171. In October 1917, Germany supplied 10 D.IIIs to the Netherlands.Green and Swanborough 1994, p. 221. These aircraft remained in service with the Luchtvaartafdeling until 1921. Boelcke's D.III, serial 352/16, survived the war to be displayed at the Zeughaus museum in Berlin. The aircraft was destroyed by an Allied bombing raid in 1943.

After the decline of the dalvoy's power and eventual death, Hyder Ali, another dalvoy, came to be considered the de facto supreme ruler of Mysore from 1761 until his death in 1782. He was a titular King. He could never enjoy power as there was a tripartite struggle between himself, the Dalvoi and sarvadikari Nanja Raja. In fact the kingdom became weak because of the struggle. Haider Ali gradually filled the place of Nanja Raja. The king executed many plots to regain his power but was not successful. His opponents were more resourceful, sly and united.

It is named after José Cleto (1901-1960), a local entrepreneur, politician and film producer and director. It is operated by the Municipality of União da Vitória under the supervision of Aeroportos do Paraná (SEIL). History Between 1912 and 1916, the region around União da Vitória was the site of the Contestado War. At that time, Lieutenant Ricardo João Kirk, a Brazilian aviator, made a demonstration of the use of aircraft in battles to representatives of the Brazilian Army. Convinced by Kirk's demonstration, the Brazilian Government ordered the Army to open airfields in União da Vitória, Canoinhas and Rio Negro, to send aircraft to those cities, and to attack the rebels by dropping bombs. The aircraft had difficulties to reach their destination, particularly because the train that was carrying the aircraft and troops was attacked by the rebels. As a result, Kirk decided to go himself to União da Vitória equipped with new aircraft and troops. On March 1, 1915, during his second flight, the one in which he would start destroying villages and other settlements, he crashed in a forest 44 km from União da Vitória while attempting an emergency landing. This crash was the first documented aircraft accident in Brazil. Airlines and destinations No scheduled flights operate at this airport.

She was transferred to the Royal Netherlands Navy before completion and renamed HNLMS Dolfijn.  Career  =September 1942 - February 1943= Dolfijn spent the time between September 1942 and January 1943 carrying out trials with the 3rd Flotilla, in Holy Loch. In January she was assigned to the 8th Flotilla, at Algiers, and between November and December 1943, to the 10th Flotilla, at Malta. Whilst on her first war patrol she attacked a so far unidentified German submarine, but missed her. On 9 February 1943, she torpedoed and sank the Italian near Cape Spartivento, Sardinia, Italy. She went on to sink the Italian merchant ship Egle, the Italian auxiliary patrol vessel V50 / Adalia, the Italian sailing vessel Stefano Galleano and four other sailing vessels, including the Greek Hydrea and Theonie, as well as two small German vessels. She also damaged the Italian merchantmen Humanitas and Sabia, and launched unsuccessful attacks against the German merchant vessels Oria and Leda (the former Italian Leopardi). The attack on Leda was foiled by the escorting German destroyer TA14. Dolfijn also torpedoed the wreck of the French merchant ship Dalny and attacked a small convoy with gunfire, firing 16 rounds and hitting the barge Vidi twice. Dolfijn was forced to break off the action and submerge due to swift return fire. =December 1943 - May 1952= Between December 1943 and March 1944, Dolfijn was part of the 1st Flotilla, at Beirut. She eventually returned to the UK with convoys, and was refitted at Dundee. After the war she became a training boat in Amsterdam between 1947 and 1952. She was decommissioned and nominally returned to the Royal Navy, but was broken up in the Netherlands in May 1952.

The new prototype, designated M.21, was a development of the earlier M.17 fighter which Fokker had produced for the Austro-Hungarian Air Service. The M.21 featured a swept back upper wing to improve pilot view. Fokker was enthusiastic about the new aircraft, which was highly maneuverable. After the addition of a modified cowling and stringers along the fuselage sides, the aircraft was designated M.22. In October 1916, Idflieg ordered the M.22 into production as the D.V. Operational history Deliveries commenced in January 1917. Due to the low-compression Oberursel U.I, the D.V offered poor performance compared to the Albatros fighters. The D.V saw little active service and most aircraft were relegated to fighter training schools. When the Fokker Dr.I entered service in late 1917, small numbers of D.V aircraft were issued to squadrons for use as conversion trainers. Production of the D.V totaled 216 aircraft.

The Society also operates a museum and museum shop in the East Tennessee History Center on Gay Street in downtown Knoxville. The East Tennessee Historical Society was established in 1834, only 38 years after the establishment of the state of Tennessee, to record the history of the development and settlement of the area.East Tennessee Historical Society:ETHS home History The East Tennessee Historical and Antiquarian Society was founded by early Tennessee historian J. G. M. Ramsey (1797-1884), who was concerned that many of the state's early pioneers were dying off, and sought to archive their papers and correspondence.W. Todd Groce, \\"A Brief History of the East Tennessee Historical Society,\\" Journal of East Tennessee History Vol. 66 (1994), pp. 1-9. The first meeting of the Society was held on May 5, 1834. East Tennessee College president William B. Reese was elected as the first president. The executive committee included Ramsey's brother-in-law John Hervey Crozier and stepbrother Thomas William Humes. Ramsey, as the Society's recording secretary, gradually acquired a sizeable collection of papers and correspondence from early Tennesseans such as William Blount, John Sevier, Samuel Wear, Alexander Outlaw, and James Hubbert. The \\"Antiquarian\\" had been dropped from the Society's name by 1852. Ramsey kept the Society's archives at his plantation, Mecklenburg, just east of Knoxville. During the Civil War, Ramsey was a very vocal Confederate and secessionist, and was forced to flee when the Union Army occupied Knoxville in 1863, leaving behind his library and the Society's archives. An arsonist (allegedly hired by Ramsey's rival, William \\"Parson\\" Brownlow) burned Mecklenburg, effectively destroying the archives. By the end of the war, the Society had largely disintegrated. In January 1883, several Confederate veterans, led by Moses White and William Henderson (with some assistance from the aging Ramsey and Crozier), revived the East Tennessee Historical Society as an auxiliary of the Southern Historical Association. An 1885 ad for the group shows U.T. professor William Gibbs McAdoo as president and future Knoxville mayor Samuel G. Heiskell as vice president. Other members included newspaper editor William Rule and scholar Eben Alexander.Jack Neely, \\"A Short History of the East Tennessee Historical Society,\\" Knoxville Mercury, 13 August 2015. The Society hosted lectures on Fort Loudoun, Irish nationalist John Mitchel, and the State of Franklin, and featured speakers such as Fitzhugh Lee. The Society also admitted women for the first time. By the end of the century, however, this second incarnation of the ETHS was no longer active. In December 1924, several Knoxville-area educators and librarians met at the Lawson McGhee Library to discuss reviving the ETHS. The first official meeting of the new Society took place on January 16, 1925. Charter members included U.T. professor Philip Hamer, Lawson McGhee librarian Mary U. Rothrock, and U.T. dean (and later president) James Hoskins. The Calvin M. McClung Collection offered the Society use of its office space and staff. The Society began publishing its annual scholarly journal in 1929, and hosted lectures by historians Stanley J. Folmsbee and Samuel Cole Williams. The Society published its first book, Folmsbee's Sectionalism and Internal Improvements in Tennessee, in 1939. In 1946, the Society published a comprehensive history of Knox County, The French Broad-Holston Country, as part of the state's sequicentennial celebrations. The book, edited by Rothrock, included a history of the county written by Folmsbee, and contributions by Harvey Broome and several other ETHS members. A revised edition was published in 1972. In 1976, the Society published a comprehensive history of Knoxville, entitled, Heart of the Valley: A History of Knoxville, Tennessee. This book was edited by Lucile Deaderick, and included a general history of the city by William MacArthur. MacArthur's history was republished in the 1982 book, Knoxville: Crossroads of the New South, which included several hundred photographs from the McClung Collection. In the late 1970s, Knox County acquired the Old Customs House (which had been used by the Tennessee Valley Authority prior to the construction of the TVA Towers), and allotted the space to the McClung Collection and the Knox County Archives. The ETHS set up its headquarters on the building's second floor, and hired a professional staff. During the 1980s, under the directorship of Charles Faulkner Bryan and Mark Wetherington, membership virtually doubled. During the tenure of W. Todd Groce as executive director (1990-1995), the ETHS renamed its scholarly publication as the Journal of East Tennessee History, created the First Families of Tennessee project in 1992, and established the Museum of East Tennessee History in 1993.\\"Museum of East Tennessee History Opens Tuesday,\\" Knoxville News-Sentinel, 14 March 1993. Publications Since 1929, the Society has published an annual collection of scholarly essays on the history and culture of East Tennessee. Initially known simply as the Society's Publications, this work has been published as the Journal of East Tennessee History since 1990. The journal covers topics on a wide range of historical and cultural issues related to East Tennessee and the Southern Appalachian region, including the American Civil War, the early settlement of East Tennessee, post-Civil War Reconstruction, the Great Depression, World War I and World War II, as well as more recent events such as the 1982 World's Fair.

In the book he is the one who tells most of the background of Erik's history. Erik refers to him as the \\"daroga\\" (, Persian for \\"police- chief\\") and his memoirs are featured in five chapters of the novel. He is also considered Erik's only friend. In the 1925 silent film The Phantom Of The Opera, his character was changed into an inspector for the secret police named \\"Ledoux\\" who had been investigating Erik for months. He still helps and accompanies Raoul to rescue Christine. Originally, the character was meant to be more like in the novel but his background was changed during the creation of the intertitles for the movie. He still appears to be of Persian descent in the final film, though. In the 1986 Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, he does not appear, although aspects of his character are merged with Madame Giry's. For instance, Madame Giry shows Raoul where Erik lives, although she does not accompany him to Erik's lair. There is also a monkey doll and music box, dressed as a Persian, on the auction at the opening scene of the musical. According to his account of himself in the novel, the Persian once served as the chief of police (daroga) in the court of the Shah of Persia during the years that Erik was there. He refers to these times as \\"the rosy hours of Mazenderan\\". Being kindhearted, he helped Erik escape from Persia when the Shah ordered him executed, a trick that involved presenting a body washed up on the shore as Erik's. When news of the escape spread, the Shah-in-Shah punished the Persian by stripping him of his property and sending him into exile. The Persian later travels to Paris and takes up living in a small, middle-class flat in the rue de Rivoli, across the street from the Tuileries, on the modest pension he receives from the Persian government. He becomes known as a fixture of the Opera, considered an eccentric Persian who is allowed to wander backstage where he pleases. Research into Leroux's sources has revealed that Leroux based this description upon a real-life Persian who frequented the Paris Opera in the 19th century, a mysterious exiled prince living on a pension from the British government.Shah, Raj. \\"No Ordinary Skeleton: Unmasking the Secret Source of Gaston Leroux's Le Fantôme de l'Opéra\\", Forum for Modern Language Studies 50:1 (2014), 16-29 (17-18). The character has a Persian servant named Darius. He is described in the novel as having an \\"ebony skin, with eyes of jade\\", and he wears a short Astrakhan cap along with Western dress clothes of the narrative's historic setting. Gaston Leroux writes that he has \\"a noble and generous heart\\" and is very concerned for the fate of others.  Role in the plot  The Persian first appears during Christine and Raoul's flight from the rooftops and warns them to go a different way. He next makes himself known after Christine's disappearance when he suddenly appears to Raoul and warns him, \\"Erik's secrets concern no one but himself!\\" Raoul ignores this warning by telling the commissary the whole story, but the Persian intercepts him and tells him that it is Erik, not Raoul's brother Philippe, who has carried off Christine. He leads Raoul through the passages of the Opera House to Christine's dressing room, where they go through the revolving door hidden in Christine's mirror and travel down through the passages under the Opera. Raoul is very confused as to the purpose of the long pistol the Persian has given him, as he is only instructed to keep his hand as if he were ready to fire - and that it does not even matter whether he is holding the weapon. The Persian eventually reveals that keeping the hand at the level of the eyes is a defense against the Punjab lasso. No matter how expert the thrower is, the lasso cannot be tightened around a neck with a hand blocking its path. When they finally reach the back entrance to Erik's house, where Joseph Buquet was found hanged, they drop into what turns out to be Erik's torture-chamber. This chamber contains heat- reflecting mirrors that reach from floor to ceiling, with an iron tree in a corner, making its occupant feel like he or she is in an unending forest of trees made of iron. (Buquet had stumbled into this room and used a Punjab lasso hanging from a tree branch to commit suicide.) The Persian finds a hidden exit that allows him and Raoul to drop into a still-lower room filled with gunpowder; unless Christine agrees to marry Erik, he will blow up the Opera House. She accepts this offer and water floods into the powder room, nearly drowning Raoul and the Persian. The novel concludes 30 years after these events, with the Persian - now old and sick, and still attended by Darius - telling how he and Raoul were saved from the flood by Erik, who allowed all three captives to go free. He dies five months after giving this account.  Apocrypha  In Susan Kay's 1990 novel Phantom, the Persian's name is given as Nadir Khan. Distantly related to the Shah, he is assigned the office of chief of police in Mazenderan, where the shah and his court spend the summers. He is a widower, his wife Rookheeya having died while giving birth to their son Reza. Out of love for the memory of Rookheeya, Nadir has never had any other wife and occasionally avails himself of servant women rather than get remarried. He is very fond of Reza, who bears a great resemblance to his mother and is dying of Tay–Sachs disease. Nadir has a great dislike of cats, and they seem to know it. Unfortunately, the shah owns a number of favorite cats and Nadir considers himself lucky to get off with imperial displeasure and a deep scratch on the ankle when he accidentally steps on a cat's tail. In an earlier adapted novel by Theadora Bruns his name is Oded. In the Caliber Comics graphic novel Adventure of the Opera Ghost by Steven Philip Jones and Aldin Baroza a former daroga named Nadir Khan assists Sherlock Holmes, Dr. John H. Watson, the Comte de Chagny, and Raoul in their attempts to hunt down Erik in the Paris Opera House. In Nicholas Meyer's 1993 novel The Canary Trainer, the role of the Persian is largely taken by an incognito Sherlock Holmes. Kim Newman's short stories \\"Angels of Music\\" and \\"The Mark of Kane\\" from the Tales of the Shadowmen anthology series are a parody of Charlie's Angels. In the stories, Erik is the equivalent of Charlie, and the Persian takes the role of Bosley.

Architecture and opening Hampton Row station from Kennet and Avon CanalHampton Row was named after the street that leads eastwards from Sydney Gardens. The station was built as a halt for the eastern suburbs of Bath. It opened as a railway station in 1907 for Great Western Railway stopping train services from Bristol, Swindon and Westbury, Wiltshire. The station had two platforms linked by an iron foot bridge which still exists. The station is on the south side of the river Avon, but to the north of the Kennet and Avon Canal which had to be relocated further south when the railway was built. Accidents and incidents *On 15 August 1876 a freight train was derailed at Hampton Row after a bale of cotton fell off a wagon and derailed the one behind it. Subsequent history The station was open for only a short period as at the same time trams and motor transport were becoming more commonplace. As a street, Hampton Row leads only on to the canal towpath, which limited the station's accessibility. Closure The station was closed on 25 April 1917 as an economy measure during the First World War as with Twerton station, which served the west of the city. Neither station reopened when peace came. Current uses The station has been almost entirely dismantled showing up only as a vacant space between the railway lines and the road or canal embankment. A section of rail forms a barrier between a turning/parking area at the end of Hampton Row and railway property. Numbers 9-14 Hampton Row became derelict after Buchanan's Plan for Bath was released in the 1960s, with a new road intended to pass through the site.

Birth Of The Deep Fried Film Festival Festival Director, Martin Greechan, conceived the Deep Fried Film Festival in 2005. Martin was teaching a full-time media course for fps media charity in Motherwell when he had the idea of screening the students’ work under the banner of The Deep Fried Film Festival. The night was a success and Martin took his bosses the idea of a full-blown international festival that would showcase films from around the world and help to stimulate the film industry in Lanarkshire and its surrounding areas. FPS media passed on the idea saying it would be too time consuming, non-financially viable and not generate any interest. Disillusioned by this feedback Martin set out to prove them wrong and set up the site Deepfriedfilm.org.uk. Within two weeks of being up the festival had received its first submission \\"Botch\\" from Dublin, many followed and this was before the festival had been announced to Martin's employers. The festival is now in its fourth year, receives international press, has grown year on year. The Deep Fried Film Festival hopes that it inspires not only filmmakers but also anyone who has been told they can't follow a dream to go out and prove people wrong. Martin Greechan has since left fps media and is currently working full-time for Deep Fried Film promoting independent cinema. History The festival shows a range of films from around the world and screens not only feature length films and documentaries, but also shorts, animations and music videos. Established in 2006, it was designed to be an egalitarian forum for anyone with the drive to produce a film and give them the opportunity to show their work on the big screen. Submission fees are kept low to encourage grassroot filmmakers as well as professionals, in direct contrast to the Edinburgh International Film Festival (EIFF), which the festival director felt was discouraging filmmakers with their submission charges. Deep Fried Festival Mission Statement The Deep Fried Film Festival aims to develop the talent and skills of filmmakers, by encouraging better practises amongst filmmakers and increasing relationships between filmmakers and production organisations.

Celebrity Endorsements Mark Millar \\"Growing up in North Lanarkshire, film festivals always seemed like something we only ever saw on TV as a location report from Barry Norman. The idea of one on our doorstep like the Deep Fried Film Festival is incredibly exciting, not just for aspiring film-makers, but for anyone with an appreciation of movies in general. So many of us grew up thousands of miles from where the action seemed to be happening, but now it's taking place five minutes away.\\" Billy Boyd (actor) \\"That's sounds great.

She was muse to the couturier Pierre Balmain, who called her one of the most beautiful women he had ever met.  Early life Although born in London, Janet (generally known by her middle name, \\"Bronwen\\") was raised in Hampstead, Middlesex, since 1965 in north London. She was the daughter of Sir John Alun Pugh, a Welsh county court judge, and Kathleen (née Goodyear) Pugh. After the sudden death of a friend in 1951, she embarked on an inner journey of self-discovery culminating in 1959 in a profound mystical experience. Career Before her marriage, Bronwen had a career as \\"the most celebrated model of her generation\\" and, later, as a BBC television presenter. She was muse to Pierre Balmain, the Parisian couturier, who said she was one of the world's most beautiful women along with Greta Garbo, Vivien Leigh and Marlene Dietrich. Personal life On 14 October 1960, she married William Astor, 3rd Viscount Astor (1907—1966) as his third wife. Viscount Astor, known to his family and friends as Bill Astor, was the eldest son of Waldorf Astor, 2nd Viscount Astor, and his wife, Nancy, Viscountess Astor. Upon her marriage, Bronwen became the mistress of Cliveden, the mansion which her mother-in-law had made famous with her political salons. Within three years of her marriage Bronwen's world was turned upside down by the infamous Profumo affair, which brought down Prime Minister Harold Macmillan's government. Together, they were the parents of: * Hon. Janet Elizabeth Astor (born 1 December 1961), who married Charles Gordon-Lennox, Earl of March and Kinrara, in 1991. In 2017, Gordon-Lennox succeeded as the Duke of Richmond. * Hon. Pauline Marian Astor (born 26 March 1964), who married George C. V. Case, of Turville Llodge in Henley-on-Thames. Bill died from a heart attack in 1966, leaving Bronwen with two young daughters. Bronwen left Cliveden with her daughters, to live in Tuesley Manor, Godalming, Surrey. She opened her new home to the homeless and in 1983 trained as a psychotherapist. Her biography, Bronwen Astor: Her Life and Times, written by Peter Stanford, was published in 2000. When she left Tuesley it was sold for £1.85 million. Bronwen became a convert to the Roman Catholic faith, serving as an extraordinary minister at Holy Apostles Catholic Church, Pimlico. She died on 28 December 2017.

Early years Born and raised in Fairfax, Virginia, a suburb southwest of Washington, D.C., Imoh attended Robinson Secondary School and starred as a tailback in football and a sprinter in track. As a senior, he led the Rams to the 6A state championship in football in the fall of 2001 and enrolled at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg in 2002. College career Imoh was moved to receiver in his first two seasons at Virginia Tech, as the Hokies had lost all-Big East receiver André Davis to the National Football League, and were in desperate need of help at flanker. In 2003, Imoh became the first Hokie to return a kickoff for a touchdown since 1992 with his 91-yard return against Connecticut. Imoh finished the 2003 season as the top kick returner in the Big East and the third highest kick returner nationally. Following the 2003 season, Imoh and two teammates – Marcus Vick and Brendan Hill – were convicted of contributing to the delinquency of a minor for allegedly serving alcohol to three underage girls. Imoh was suspended for three games following the incident. As a junior in 2004, Imoh moved back to tailback. Following his suspension, he quickly won the starting job. Against North Carolina, Imoh broke the Virginia Tech single game rushing record set the previous year by Kevin Jones. Due to a record keeping error with the official statistics, Imoh was originally credited with only 236 yards – five short of Jones' total – but Tech's radio statistician noticed a discrepancy between his notes and the official total and was able to have the error corrected.

Listed at and , Giebell threw right-handed and batted left-handed. Early career Born in Pennsboro, West Virginia, Giebell attended Salem International University. His first professional baseball team was the minor league Evansville Bees in 1938. Giebell played briefly for the major league Detroit Tigers in 1939, but he only pitched innings in relief before being sent to the minor league Toledo Mud Hens, where he pitched most of the 1939 season. The 1940 season In September 1940, Giebell was brought back up to the major leagues and had two outstanding starts during the 1940 pennant drive. Giebel pitched a pair of complete game victories and gave up only two runs in 18 innings pitched for an earned run average of 1.00. Giebell got his first start on September 19, 1940, with Tigers and Indians tied for first place. Giebell, who had just been called up from the Buffalo Bisons where he went 15–16, pitched a complete game, giving up only two runs as the Tigers beat the Philadelphia Athletics, 13–2. =Pennant-clinching shutout over Bob Feller= On September 27, 1940, the Tigers needed one more win to clinch the pennant. With 27 game winner Bob Feller scheduled to pitch for the Indians, Detroit manager Del Baker decided to start Giebell against Feller rather than \\"waste\\" his aces Bobo Newsom or Schoolboy Rowe. Time magazine described Giebell at the time as \\"a gawky stringbean\\", who \\"looked like a sacrificial lamb as he ambled out to the mound.\\" But, as Time reported after the game, Giebell was \\"no lamb\\" that day. Instead, \\"[w]ith cunning change of pace and the control of an oldtimer, the green-as-grass rookie shut out the Indians 2-to-0.\\" http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,802057,00.html Feller gave up only three hits for the day, but one of them was a two-run wind-blown home run by Rudy York. That was all the Tigers needed thanks to Giebell's pitching that day. The setting in Cleveland that day was raucous. The Indians had built a reputation as the \\"Cleveland Crybabies\\" for their whining about manager Ossie Vitt, and had been subjected to chants of \\"Cleveland Crybabies\\", \\"Boohoo Indians\\" and \\"papeese\\" (plural of papoose) when they played in Detroit. Tiger fans threw baby bottles on the field during the game, decorated the dugout with diapers, and pushed a baby carriage along the dugout roof during the game.http://www.baseball- fever.com/archive/index.php/t-40258.html The Indians fans turned out in force, 45,000 strong, and armed \\"with eggs, eggplants, cauliflowers, fruit.\\" As soon as the Tigers went on the field they were pelted from the stands. By the time Rudy York hit one of Feller's pitches for a two-run home run, Time reported that the field \\"looked like a vegetable plate.\\" The umpire called time twice, and Indians manager Ossie Vitt begged the fans to stop. When the umpire made an announcement threatening a forfeit, an immediate fruit barrage ensued. Hank Greenberg was drilled with a tomato as he ran after a fly ball. At one point, an entire bushel basket of tomatoes dropped from the upper grandstand into the Tiger bullpen, barely missing Tigers ace Schoolboy Rowe, but making a direct hit on Detroit catcher Birdie Tebbetts, knocking Tebbetts unconscious.\\" The Cleveland police quickly apprehended the offender, Armen Guerra, and took him to the Detroit clubhouse. Tebbetts, now conscious, beat up Guerra while the cops looked the other way. Guerra, who earlier had dropped the crate on Tebbets, filed criminal assault charges, but Tebbets was acquitted. Giebell remained calm through the commotion in Cleveland, and shutout the Indians for nine innings in one of the great \\"David vs. Goliath\\" moments in baseball. Career and life after 1940 The pennant-clinching win over Feller was only the third of Giebell's career, but it proved to be his last. Having played in only three games, he was not eligible to play in the 1940 World Series. Giebell pitched briefly for the Tigers in 1941 but his ERA soared from 1.00 to 6.03. Giebell was sent back to the minor leagues. He pitched for Buffalo in 1941 and 1942 and then served in the military for three years during World War II. He returned to baseball following the war, but never made it out of the minor leagues. His final season playing professional baseball was 1948, with the minor league Dallas Eagles. Over his three-year major league career, Giebell was 3–1 in 28 games (four as a starter) with a 3.99 earned run average in innings. According to his obituary, Giebell worked in the quality control labs of Weirton Steel until his retirement. He died in 2004 at age 94 in Wilkesboro, North Carolina. According to published accounts, Giebell still had a silver tray that had been signed by all the Detroit players to commemorate the pennant-clinching victory.

On the morning of Monday 23 May 1977, four armed South-Moluccans took 105 children and their five teachers hostage at a primary school in Bovensmilde, Netherlands. At the same time nine others hijacked a train in the nearby De Punt. Both hostage crises lasted for twenty days before being ended by military interventions. Context The South Moluccans had arrived in the Netherlands for a temporary stay, promised by the Dutch government that they would get their own independent state, Republik Maluku Selatan (RMS). For about 25 years they lived in temporary camps, often in poor conditions. After these years the younger generation felt betrayed by the Dutch government for not giving them their independent state and they began radical actions to gain attention for their cause. Developments * 09:00 23 May When the hostage crises begins the children are forced to cover the windows with newspapers preventing the outside world from knowing what was happening inside. * 25 May The day of the elections for the national parliament. To increase pressure on the government the children are forced to shout out of the windows: \\"van Agt, we want to live\\". The first ultimatum expires at 14:00 without any problems. Later that day, additional demands are expressed. * 27 May All the children are released because many children have become ill from some unknown disease. The cause and nature of these disease is still unknown, but it is often speculated that the provided food might have been deliberately poisoned with laxatives by authorities to force a break-through, this is substantiated by a statement from Dutch Prime Minister Dries Van Agt in a Dutch documentary where he said \\"Ik vind het een uitstekend idee (…) een laxeermiddel hebben we allemaal wel eens nodig.\\"[I think it's a great idea (…) everybody needs a laxative now and then.]. Four teachers were retained as hostages. * 05:00 11 June Marines attack the school in the early morning, an armoured car and explosives punched a hole in the wall and marines entered the building. The Moluccans surrendered without a fight after hearing about the subsequent military attack on the train at \\"De Punt\\". Aftermath The four attackers were convicted with sentences varying from six to nine years. The Moluccan community has never made any apologies, but two of the hostage takers, motivated by born-again Christianity, have had a meeting with former victims in 2007.Description of TV-program of the EO(public evangelical broadcaster) Thirty years after the events in question, on 23 May 2007, a monument was erected and the first memorial ceremony is held where symbolic white balloons were released.

After the initial success of the Fokker Dr.I triplane, Anthony Fokker proposed a quintuplane, reasoning that if three wings were good, five would be even better. Reinhold Platz, chief engineer for Fokker, was at first shocked by the idea: further thought only strengthened this reaction. Nevertheless, the aircraft was built. Using some parts of the V.6, Platz designed a machine with three wings at the extreme front of the aircraft and a pair of wings midway along the fuselage, the mid-fuselage biplane wings placed where their leading edges were virtually even with the aft end of the cockpit coaming. Balanced control surfaces were fitted to the upper wings, those at the front acting as conventional ailerons and those in the rear working with the elevators.Weyl 1965, p 253 The pilot was seated just ahead of the biplane wings. Like the V.6, it was powered by a 120 hp (90 kW) water-cooled Mercedes engine. Fokker, who was his own test pilot, made two brief flights in October 1917, after which it was abandoned. The Fokker V.8 was powered by a 119 kW (160 hp) Mercedes engine. Platz regarded the aircraft as such a monstrosity that later on he would only speak of it reluctantly, and disliked its design being attributed to him.Weyl 1965 p. 253 References Bibliography *Peter M.

The Estonians won the battle. The retreating Estonian forces crossed the Gauja River and set up an ambush at its tributary. The pursuing Crusaders believed their enemy was fleeing in haste, something that had been confirmed by their scouts. The vanguard consisted of some 20 knights of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword, led by Landmarschall Arnold. They were followed by Livonians led by Caupo of Turaida, and Latgalians. The Estonians hiding in the forest around Gauja River charged the enemy unexpectedly. The sudden attack caught the Crusaders off guard. Around hundred Livonians, Latgalians and Germans were captured. The knights tried to regroup around their banner, but as soon as their reinforcements escaped, they too fled the battlefield. The Estonians pursued them and some were captured and killed on the scene. According to the Livonian Chronicle, some of the prisoners were burned alive, while others had crosses carved on their backs with swords, before being executed as well.

Gupta is also a novelist and a recipient of the Sahitya Akademi Award. Personal life Sunetra Gupta was born in March 1965 in Calcutta, India, as the daughter of Dhruba and Minati Gupta. She trained in biology, holding a bachelor's degree from Princeton University. In 1992, she obtained her Ph.D. from Imperial College London.. Gupta has two children with Adrian V. S. Hill. Scientific career and research Gupta wrote her PhD thesis on the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases. She is a professor of theoretical epidemiology in the Department of Zoology at the University of Oxford, where she leads a team of infectious disease epidemiologists. She has undertaken research on various infectious diseases, including malaria, HIV, influenza, bacterial meningitis and COVID-19. She is a supernumerary fellow of Merton College, Oxford. =COVID-19= Gupta has been a critic of the lockdown approach to the COVID-19 pandemic, arguing that the cost is too high for the poorest in society. She has also questioned the quality of the debate on the pandemic. Arguing herd immunity is a way of preventing vulnerable people from dying, her view is that countries should follow the general approach taken by the infectious disease epidemiologists in Sweden, shielding the vulnerable as best possible while those with minimal risk go about their lives and allow herd immunity to build up.Maggie Pagano, Alastair Benn, Mutaz Ahmed, We may already have herd immunity – an interview with Professor Sunetra Gupta, Reaction, July 21, 2020. In March 2020, Gupta and colleagues published models for the coronavirus pandemic contrasting to earlier models produced elsewhere. Their model suggested that up to 68% of the population could already have been infected, suggesting broader immunity and a subsiding threat. In May 2020, Gupta told UnHerd in an interview that she believed that \\"the epidemic has largely come and is on its way out in [the UK]. So, I think [the infection fatality rate] would be definitely less than one in a thousand, and probably closer to one in ten thousand.\\" Both before and after this statement, the estimates of other experts have fallen in a range much higher than this. She is one of the primary authors of the controversial Great Barrington Declaration which advocated a \\"focused\\" response to COVID-19 pandemic based on statistical levels of risk. =Awards= Gupta has been awarded the 2007 Scientific Medal by the Zoological Society of London and the 2009 Royal Society Rosalind Franklin Award.

She took her stage name from the city of her birth and in addition to a successful recording career that spans over three decades, it is fair to say that she has been one of the great sex symbols of Brazilian pop music. Her husky mezzo-soprano voice is known for its extensive emotional range, from tender ballads, to sensual love songs, to Portuguese fados all the way to energetic sambas and lambadas.  Biography  Born in Belém in 1956, she made her public debut in her home town in 1973. In the next year she performed shows with Zé Rodrix in Rio de Janeiro and with Sérgio Ricardo in Belém and Salvador da Bahia. In the same year she hit the charts with \\"Filho da Bahia\\", then recorded for the soundtrack of the TV Globo soap opera Gabriela; she also released her first single that year. In 1976 Fafá de Belém recorded her first LP; Tamba Tajá, which was praised by critics. In 1984 she became the muse of the movement in favour of free elections in Brazil, singing \\"Menestrel das Alagoas\\" (pt), written by Milton Nascimento and Fernando Brant, before a million people in Rio de Janeiro. In the same period her highly popular interpretation of the Brazilian National Anthem at mass gatherings got her into trouble with the ruling military regime that was soon replaced by a popularly elected President. In 1993 her album Meu Fado went platinum in Portugal,Fafá de Belém “vermelhou” ao receber medalha do Turismo de Portugal one of the countries where she is widely popular.

After heavy fighting, the Tartu- Valga group of the Estonian Army pushed the Red Latvian Riflemen out of the Paju Manor.Jaan Maide (1933) [www.ksk.edu.ee/file.php?ID=1206 Ülevaade Eesti vabadussõjast] Kaitseliit publishing, Tartu It was the fiercest battle in the early period of war. Estonian commander Julius Kuperjanov fell in the fighting. Background In early January 1919 Estonian forces had started a full-scale counterattack against invading Soviets. Their main objective was liberating north Estonia including Narva, which was achieved by 17 January. They then started to advance into south Estonia. On 14 January the Tartumaa Partisan Battalion, organised and led by Lt. Julius Kuperjanov, and armoured trains liberated Tartu. At that time the only working railway connection to Riga, which the Red Army had captured on 3 January, passed through Valga, so defending it had strategic importance for Soviet Russia.Traksmaa, August: Lühike Vabadussõja ajalugu, page 102. Olion, 1992 Among other units, a large part of the elite Latvian Riflemen were sent to stop the Estonians. Commander- in-chief Johan Laidoner reinforced the Estonian advance in the south, including Finnish volunteers, The Sons of the North, led by Col. Hans Kalm. Finnish Gen. Paul Martin Wetzer became commander of the southern front.Traksmaa, August: Lühike abadussõja ajalugu, page 105. Olion, 1992 Battle Julius Kuperjanov To liberate Valga it was necessary to capture Paju Manor. On 30 January Estonian partisans had captured it, but were soon pushed out. With his 300 men, two guns and 13 machine guns Kuperjanov decided to recapture Paju on 31 January.Traksmaa, August: Lühike Vabadussõja ajalugu, page 106. Olion, 1992 Armoured trains were unable to support, due to the destruction of Sangaste railway bridge. The Latvian Riflemen had about 1,200 men with four guns and 32 machine guns.Kaevats, Ülo: Eesti entsüklopeedia 7, page 146. Eesti Entsüklopeediakirjastus, 1994 They were also able to rely on supported from a Soviet armoured train and armoured cars. The Tartumaa Partisan Battalion attacked the manor directly over open fields. At 400 metres the Bolsheviks opened fire, inflicting heavy casualties. Kuperjanov led the attack personally, as usual, and was badly wounded, dying two days later. When he was hit, Lt. Johannes Soodla took command of the battalion. Finnish Sons of the North units with about 380 men arrived later, bringing with them four guns and nine machine guns. They also assaulted the manor in a frontal attack, which caused heavy losses. In the evening the Estonians and Finns finally pushed into the park of the estate where heavy hand-to-hand combat started, which resulted in the capture of the manor. Retreating Latvian Riflemen were subjected to heavy fire. The next day the Estonians marched into Valga without resistance.Traksmaa, August: Lühike Vabadussõja ajalugu, page 109. Olion, 1992 Aftermath Battle of Paju memorial. The bloody Battle of Paju resulted in the liberation of Valga the next day. The victory cut off the Soviets' railway supply line and denied them the use of armoured trains. Soon almost all of southern Estonia was liberated and Estonian troops advanced into northern Latvia. To honour Julius Kuperjanov, who died of the wounds he sustained during the battle, on 2 February, the Tartumaa Partisan Battalion was renamed Kuperjanov's Partisan Battalion. The current Estonian Defence Force still includes the Kuperjanov Battalion.Eesti Kaitsevägi:Kuperjanovi Üksik- jalaväepataljon The battle is commemorated by a granite monument on a three–step pyramid of earth, which was reopened by Estonian President Lennart Meri in 1994 on the 75th anniversary of the battle.

It was later redesignated as the Tuskegee Advanced Flying School; the Army Air Forces Advanced Flying School; and the Army Air Forces Pilot School (Basic-Advanced).Tuskeegee Timeline Tuskegee AAF was assigned to the Southeast Training Center of the Army Air Force Training Command. It was commanded by the 318th Army Air Force Base Unit. By the end of 1942, Tuskegee had a total of 3,414 personnel. The March 1943 14M Regional Aeronautical Chart labeled the airfield as \\"Tuskegee Army Flying School\\", and indicated that the field had a control tower. By September 1943, Tuskegee had 4 runways & a total of 225 buildings. In addition to the main airfield, known sub-bases and auxiliaries which supported pilot training were: * Griel Auxiliary Field * Shorter Auxiliary Field Aircraft used at Tuskegee during World War II included the PT-17 biplane primary trainer, BT-13 monoplane basic trainer, AT-6 Texan advanced trainer, and P-40 Warhawk (used for fighter transition training). The first class of African-American aviation cadets entered the second phase of military flight training (Basic) at Tuskegee AAF on 8 November 1941, under military instructors. Only 7 of the 13 original cadets remained. The 99th Pursuit Squadron moved to Tuskegee from Maxwell Field, Alabama on 5 January 1942. The Air Base Detachment would later be redesignated as the 318th Air Base Squadron and still later as the 318th Base Headquarters and Air Base Squadron. Five of the aviation cadets at Tuskegee entered advanced flying training with P-40 Warhawks in January 1942. The 100th Pursuit Squadron was activated at Tuskegee on 19 February 1942. It was the second African-American Army Air Forces unit ever to be activated. The first class of African-American pilots at Tuskegee completed advanced pilot training on 7 March. There were only five who completed the training. On 17 April the Air Corps Advanced Flying School at Tuskegee Army Air Field was redesignated as Tuskegee Advanced Flying School. The second class of African-American pilots graduated from flying training on 29 April. By the end of 1942, nine classes of African- American pilots had completed training at Tuskeegee AAF. On 13 October 1942 the 332d Fighter Group was activated at Tuskegee, and the pre-existing 100th Fighter Squadron was assigned to it. The 301st and 302d Fighter Squadrons were also activated for the first time at Tuskegee, and assigned to the 332d Fighter Group. This group was the first African-American group in the Army Air Forces. On 23 March 1943, the group departed Tuskeegee for Selfridge Field, Michigan, where they received air combat training by First Air Force and eventually were deployed overseas for combat operations in Italy. Twin-engine training commenced at Tuskegee in 1943, at first using the AT-10. The 1944 US Army/Navy Directory of Airfields described Tuskegee AAF as having a 5,000' hard-surface runway. As constructed during World War II, Tuskegee AAF consisted of four asphalt runways (the longest being 5,200'), taxiways, a ramp, and a large number of buildings north of the field. The AT-10 twin- engine trainer was replaced at Tuskegee by the TB-25 Mitchell in 1945. The last pilot class graduated at Tuskegee in 1946, bringing the total number of pilots trained at the base to 992. Tuskegee AAF was inactivated in 1946, and the property reverted to the town of Tuskegee. Many of the base's buildings were moved into the town, and two of the hangars were relocated. Postwar use Although the 1962 Birmingham Sectional Chart depicted Sharpe Field as having 4 paved runways (with the longest being 5,000'), the Aerodromes table included the remark \\"North/South only usable runway.\\" Sharpe Field was reopened as a civilian airport at some point between 1945–62, as that is how it was listed in the 1962 AOPA Airport Directory. Sharpe Field was described as having a single 5,000' asphalt Runway 18/36, and the operator was listed as Sharpe Aviation Service. The Tuskegee airfield was evidently closed once again at some point between 1965–71, as it was not listed among active airfields in the 1971 Flight Guide. In 1976, an attempt was made to reuse the abandoned base as an oil refinery, but this did not work out. It was depicted as an abandoned airfield on the 1998 World Aeronautical Chart. In 2019 Sharpe Field was used to test a blimp deployment of FirstNet. The field’s current state was seen in a commercial by AT&T; . Current status The site of Tuskegee AAF was purchased by the Bradbury Family Partnership in the year 2000 time frame. It is strictly a private development. However, in 2003, Sharpe Field was once again listed as an active private airfield. Only one runway was listed as being active, the 5,300' asphalt Runway 14/32. The airfield is currently closed and has been deactivated. The owner was listed as the Bradbury Family Partnership of Woodstock, Georgia. The purpose of the airfield having been reactivated is unknown, although the old ramp area was used as an asphalt plant for a number of years. Some of the equipment can still be seen on the ramp area.  Facilities  Sharpe Field covers an area of at an elevation of 253 feet (77 m) above mean sea level. It has one asphalt paved runway designated 14/32 which measures 5,300 by 46 feet (1,615 x 14 m).

For many years, Subitzky had a day job as an advertising copywriter. Early life Subitzky was born in and grew up in Mount Vernon, New York, just outside New York City. As a child, he read a wide variety of comic books and Mad magazine. He was greatly influenced by the work of Harvey Kurtzman and to a lesser extent that of Will Elder, both of whom he met briefly in Mount Vernon when he was about 12 years old. He was educated at what is now Binghamton University, where he was a mathematics major who also took many philosophy courses. A few years later, he moved into Manhattan, and took cartooning classes at the School of Visual Arts. The classes were taught by Bob Blechman and Charles Slackman. National Lampoon magazine Subitzky ended up doing a great deal of work for National Lampoon magazine. His contributions primarily consisted of comic strips, cartoons, and humor writing. His connection with National Lampoon magazine was first established in 1972, when contributing editor Michel Choquette visited the cartooning class which Subitzky attended.p. 47, Levin, 2009) Choquette took a liking to Subitzky's work, and brought him over to the offices of National Lampoon. Subitzky subsequently became a long-term contributing editor; one or more of his comic strips, cartoons, and written articles appeared in almost every issue of the magazine. In September 1974, he guest-edited the \\"Old Age\\" issue of the magazine.Very Large National Lampoon Site, table of contents for National Lampoon Issue September 1974, Vol. 1.

He conceptualized and wrote all, or nearly all, of the “Public Disservice Announcements” (which were parodies of public service announcements), as well as a number of other pieces. Some selections from the Radio Hour work appeared on the CD album Gold Turkey. He also conceived, wrote, and starred in a one- hour, two-episode radio play for The National Lampoon Radio Hour. The play was a spoof of popular science-fiction/horror dramas, and was entitled The Sluts from Space. The two episodes aired on May 25 and June 2 of 1974.

Television work with David Letterman =Comedy writing and performing= Subitzky was a comedy writer on The David Letterman Show for its first season on the air, which took place in 1980. That first season was a morning show, and it was broadcast live for the entire first season. During his time as a writer for Letterman, Subitzky was partly responsible for conceiving and writing a comedy sketch about a person who pretends to be a well-known celebrity so that he can be on television. Subitzky was then invited to play the part that he had helped develop. Because of this, Subitzky was featured as a comedy actor on The David Letterman Show at least four times in 1980, in variations of the same basic sketch, which is known as “The Imposter\\". Subitzky then reprised the role in 12 more appearances on Late Night with David Letterman, during 1982, 1983, and 1984.Ed Subitzky (\\"The Imposter\\") Collection on Letterman, 1982–1984, compiled by Don Giller, uploaded Jan 19, 2020, YouTube.com, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_Z7vYARF_4 In almost all of these sketches, Letterman starts off by announcing how happy he is to have on his show the next person, a named celebrity, such as a popular singer, actor, or author. Occasionally more than one person is named. Then Subitzky comes out from the wings, sits down next to Letterman and accepts the audience's applause. After a few minutes of perfectly normal-seeming interviewing by Letterman, Subitzky breaks down and explains to Letterman that he is not that celebrity, that he lied, that he had only pretended to be that person so that he could be on television. In the first few morning-show appearances, Subitzky then exits via the wings, but on the August 5th, 1980 show, and all subsequent ones, he leaves by running out through the audience, voicing abject apologies, including stopping briefly to apologize to some individual audience members. In general there was no attempt whatsoever to make the imposter look or sound more like the people he had supposedly claimed to be, although he does wear a tuxedo as James Clavell, a motorcycle jacket and black sequined tee shirt as Don Henley, and a wig, lipstick, and women's clothing as \\"Elizabeth Callahan\\". Rolling Stone writer David Browne described the sketches like this:Website: RollingStone.com, Culture, News, \\"David Letterman Year One: A backstage and in-depth look at how a gap-toothed failed morning-show host and a ragtag band of misfits and rejects changed television forever\\", issue date September 29th, 2011 Accessed 2016-9-28 \\"One night, Letterman introduced Don Henley – and out came Ed Subitzky, a balding, overweight staff writer who answered all of Letterman's questions as if he actually were the Eagles drummer. At the end of the segment, Subitzky broke down and confessed, \\"I'm not Don Henley – I'm just a sick man!\\" before running offstage. Then, a few weeks later, Letterman would repeat the gag all over again with another celebrity name.\\" 1980, the morning show, broadcast live * July 2, 1980, the imposter as Donna Summer * July 18, 1980, the imposter as Gary Coleman * July 24, 1980, the imposter as Suzanne Somers * August 5, 1980, the imposter as Burt Reynolds and Sally Field 1982, the evening show * March 25, 1982, the imposter as Martin Cruz Smith, author of best-selling novel Gorky Park * April 22, 1982, the imposter as Don Henley, founder member of the rock band the Eagles * June 4, 1982, the imposter as James Clavell, author of best-selling novel Noble House * June 30, 1982, the imposter as \\"the mattress thief\\" * July 9, 1982, the imposter as \\"Santa Claus\\" * July 29, 1982, the imposter as \\"Elizabeth Callahan\\", a viewer from Champion, Pennsylvania, who had written in to warn Letterman about the imposter * October 4, 1982, the imposter as Bob Hope * December 20, 1982, the imposter as the US Air Force Academy Choir * Also on December 20, 1982, the imposter as the Brooke Shields doll 1983, the evening show * February 1, 1983, one-year anniversary special of the show: Ed getting out of a car at this gala event is announced as \\"the Rock superstar himself, Bruce Springsteen!\\" * September 6, 1983, the imposter is seen in a supposed flashback, having been shot through by an arrow (by an audience member?) while on stage. 1984, the evening show * February 4, 1984, at the end of this episode, which was the two-year anniversary special of the show: the imposter (or possibly just Ed Subitzky himself) is seen from behind, attending the anniversary dinner party. The New York Times Op-Ed page, and magazine work During the 1990s, Subitzky had seven cartoons published as \\"Op-Art\\" on the Opinion-Editorial page of The New York Times: February 22, 1997; June 27, 1997; September 27, 1997; November 22, 1997; February 16, 1998; August 15, 1998; and October 9, 1998. His cartoons have also appeared in Natural History, The New Yorker, and Tricycle: The Buddhist Review, and some written pieces of his appeared in Cracked. Science-related work Subitzky has created a number of science-related pieces. Starting in 1997, but primarily since 2012, he has had over 20 letters, some humorous, and some serious, primarily about ideas in physics and cosmology, published in the international science magazine, New Scientist, and he has also had a letter published in Science News. =Journal of Irreproducible Results= In 1991, Subitzky co-wrote a science humor piece for the science humor magazine Journal of Irreproducible Results entitled, “A Call For More Scientific Truth in Product Warning Labels”, by Susan Hewitt and Edward Subitzky. This piece was subsequently quoted by both New Scientist and Atlantic Monthly. Over 20 years after the piece was first published, it was still featured (both with and without its title, attribution, and introduction) on hundreds of websites, including versions translated into Dutch, French, German, Hungarian, and Spanish. Philosophy-related work =Journal of Consciousness Studies= Subitzky at his drawing table in 2012, working on a JCS comic strip Subitzky has a life-long interest in both science and philosophy, and he is especially fascinated by the very challenging \\"hard problem\\" of consciousness, i.e. why there is a subjective component to experience. Because of these interests, in 2003, Subitzky started contributing to the Journal of Consciousness Studies (JCS), an interdisciplinary, peer- reviewed academic journal that is dedicated entirely to the field of consciousness studies. JCS is published by Imprint Academic, of Exeter, England. From 2003 to 2016, Subitzky had nine drawn pieces and ten written pieces published in the Journal of Consciousness Studies. All the pieces made serious points, although some had a humorous perspective. The pieces included an essay, a visual essay, cartoons, comic strips, science-fiction short stories, a poem, and a fictional research paper. All of the pieces contain philosophical commentary on theories concerning the nature of consciousness. In chronological order, Subitzky's JCS pieces were: 2003 * \\"I am a conscious essay\\", an essay, Volume 10, No. 12, December, pp. 64–66 2004 * A single-panel untitled cartoon (man enclosed in his own thought balloon) was used as a frontispiece for the journal, Volume 11, No. 9, September, frontispiece 2005 * In 2005, the same untitled cartoon about consciousness (man enclosed in his own thought balloon) was used as cover art for What does it all mean?

But I learned the most by copying their drawings, and these three were especially good teachers.\\" And on page 114 of the same book, Barry says, \\"...the first drawings I copied would leave traces in my work and drawing style that were unshakable and strong.\\"Blabber, Blabber, Blabber: Volume 1 of Everything, Lynda Barry, 31 October 2011, page 13 & page 114, Drawn and Quarterly Comics and Graphic Novels, ; 2013 anthology Black Eye 2 A one-page comic strip by Subitzky was featured on page 18 of Black Eye 2, a limited-edition anthology of black humor.Black Eye 2: Anthology of Humor and Despair edited by Ryan Standfest, June 2013, Rotland Press, Detroit, 2013 book That's Not Funny, That's Sick In June 2013, That's Not Funny, That's Sick: The National Lampoon and the Comedy Insurgents Who Captured the Mainstream, by Ellin Stein was published.That's Not Funny, That's Sick; The National Lampoon and the Comedy Insurgents Who Captured the Mainstream by Ellin Stein, June 2013, W.W.

He played Major League Baseball for the Detroit Tigers in 1909 and 1910. He appeared in five major league games and compiled an 0–2 record in 29 innings pitched with an earned run average (ERA) of 3.41. Early years Lelivelt was born in Amsterdam on 21 October 1884 as Willem Johan Lelivelt. His father Franciscus Zacharias Lelivelt (later: Frank) came from Groessen, his mother Theodora Mattijssen (later: Dora) from Renkum. They married in Amsterdam on 19 June 1884, and emigrated in 1887 to the USA. At the time of the 1900 U.S. Census, the family was living at 586 S.

He made his major league debut in Detroit on July 19, 1909, a 5–3 loss to New York. He appeared in four games for the 1909 Tigers, two as a starter, and compiled an 0–1 record and 4.50 ERA. Although the Tigers won the American League pennant in 1909, there is no record of Lelivelt having appeared in the 1909 World Series. In November 1909, Lelivelt was part of a group of Tigers players that toured Cuba and played 12 exhibition games against two integrated Cuban teams, Habana and Almendares. Lelivelt allowed only five hits in a 2–1 loss to the Almendares team in late November. The Cabañas Company printed a series of baseball cards showing the members of the Almendares, Habana and Detroit baseball teams. Lelivelt's Cabañas baseball card is pictured above and to the right. On May 6, 1910, Lelivelt appeared in his last major league game, a 4-0 loss to the Chicago White Sox. Although Lelivelt took the loss, he allowed only two runs in the first eight innings, and Joe S. Jackson wrote in the Detroit Free Press that Lelivelt pitched an excellent game. =Minor leagues= Lellivelt spent the remainder of the 1910 season playing for the Minneapolis Millers (American Association), compiling an 8–7 record. He played four more years in professional baseball for the Montgomery Billikens (1911), Minneapolis Millers (1912), and Springfield Watchmakers (1913–1914).

It is an annual plant that grows from 6 to 26 cm tall. The linear or deltate leaves, about 3-11 per plant, are scattered along the stem and are generally 1.4–3 mm long and 0.25-0.6 mm wide. Petioles and scapes are absent. Inflorescences are 4–15 cm long and produce white and yellow flowers that bloom from April to August in the southern hemisphere. S. oviflorum is endemic to the northern area of Queensland from Mareeba and Wairuna west to Barwidgi. Its habitat is recorded as being sandy soils in seepage areas, on hillsides, or beside creeks in the company of Melaleuca viridiflora, Eucalyptus camaldulensis, or E. cullenii.

Meikle Carewe is a prominent landform visible from a number of coastal hills such as Kempstone Hill and Megray Hill; it also forms a major backdrop to the community of Netherley. Geology and hydrology This mountain is covered virtually entirely with moorland. Its northwestern slopes drain to the Cairnie Burn, whilst the northern and eastern slopes drain to Crynoch Burn. The western slopes yield surface runoff that drains into Cowton Burn. Curlethney Hill is situated approximately 0.9 kilometers to the east of Meikle Carewe Hill Surface runoff and drainage from Curlethney Hill also drain north to Crynoch Burn, at reaches above the Red Moss. Waters within the Red Moss are decidedly acidic, with measured summer pH values in the range of 5.68. These low pH levels may be caused in part by the peat drainage from the moorland on Meikle Carewe Hill. Wind farm proposal Renewable Energy Systems (RES UK & Ireland Ltd) is to construct a windfarm for electrical power generation using Meikle Carewe Hill and nearby high ground to install twelve wind turbines, five of which are proposed for Meikle Carewe Hill itself. Each turbine would reach a height of 70 metres above grade level, and the entire complex could generate enough power to supply the equivalent of 5000 homes.Meikle Carewe Windfarm Website The planning application for the development was originally rejected by Aberdeenshire Council but was overturned on appeal on 24 February 2011.

It is a self-pollinating hybrid species of ragwort and one of only six new plant species to be discovered in either the United Kingdom or North America in the last 100 years. It was discovered in 1979 in York, England growing next to a parking lot and formally described in 2003. Like many of the Senecio genus it can be found growing in urban habitats, such as disturbed earth and pavement cracks and this particular species only in York and between a railway and a parking lot. Description York radiate groundsel is a deciduous annual plant that sets its seed within the 3 months that it takes this plant to mature from germination to the upwards of high adult plant. With pretty yellow daisy-like flowers from its Sicilian parent (S. squalidus) but also with the less- promiscuous habits of its native parent (S. vulgaris); this member of the Senecio genus is morphologically distinct from related species. Leaf shapes of S. eboracensis :Leaves and stems S. eboracensis have large many lobed leaves divided into slender segments, the clefts not reaching the midrib. The stems are mostly erect to ascending with an occasional horizontal base section up to with 'adventitious roots' at base. The upper and lower leaves petiolate and lobes appearing at quarter whole leaf lengths along the midrib. The upper leaves are generally more deeply lobed and in lobed pairs. Leaves on plants grown in fertile soils or in greenhouses can be much more luxurious and more highly dissected (or more finely divided into slender segments) up to x with lobes appearing at fifth whole leaf lengths along the midrib. The plants tip is usually acute with a very small tooth. Leaf edges throughout are dentate or sometimes divided into lobes. :Flowers York groundsel has flower-heads that are more showy than those of its parent groundsel. The flower-head, found at the tips of the plants (apical) appearing in clusters (an inflorescence) usually consists of three to seven florets in a grouped corymb; at first dense and leafy but eventually less dense with peduncles 5 to 20 millimeters (0.2 to 0.8 in) which get longer when fruiting (up to 25 mm (1 in)). The flower-head is broadly cylindrical 10×4 millimeters (0.4×0.16 in), becoming slightly bell shaped) when the bright yellow ray florets open. Involucral bracts sparse (4-8), elongated (3.5-4 mm), usually without black tips. The floret ligules are narrow and long 5 to 7 millimeters (0.2 to 0.24 in) long and 1.5 millimeters (0.06 in) wide), occasionally becoming revolute. Like other Senecios, the 10-30 papilla occur stigmatically into pericarp; each usually with four-pored pollen, the grains in polar view 30-35 micrometers when fully expanded. :Seeds The achenes can be 2.5 to 3.5 millimeters (0.1 to 0.15 in) long, are straight and shallowly grooved; with hairless smooth ribs while the grooves are covered with hairs. The silky white, umbrella-like pappus readily detaches from the fruit when ripe. Name The word Eboracum, the classical name of York, was chosen in the year 2000 to describe this tetraploid hybrid derivative informally named 'York radiate groundsel' at the time a formal description was made. Distribution York groundsel occurs on disturbed ground, car park perimeters, pavement cracks and other urban/industrial sites; specifically in disturbed areas near to the railways in York, England. One of the parents Senecio vulgaris is a native to the area while the other parent Senecio squalidus was introduced from Mount Etna in Sicily in 1690 to the Oxford Botanic Garden in Oxford, England and was soon spreading happily along the railways and throughout the country. Evolution Senecio eboracensis is a hybrid species whose parents are the self-incompatible and promiscuous Sicilian Senecio squalidus (also known as Oxford ragwort) and the self- compatible and tenacious Senecio vulgaris (also known as Common groundsel). Like S. vulgaris, S. eboracensis is self-compatible but shows little or no natural crossing with its parent species and is therefore reproductively isolated, indicating that strong breeding barriers exist between this new hybrid and its parents. It is thought to have resulted from backcrossing of the F1 hybrid of its parents to S. vulgaris. S. vulgaris is native to Britain, while S. squalidus was introduced from Sicily in the early 18th century; therefore, S. eboracensis has speciated from those two species within the last 300 years. Other hybrids descended from the same two parents are known. Some are infertile, such as S. x baxteri. Other fertile hybrids are also known, including S. vulgaris var. hibernicus (which has been accepted as a synonym for S. vulgaris), now common in Britain, and the allohexaploid S. cambrensis, which according to molecular evidence probably originated independently at least three times in different locations. Morphological and genetic evidence support the status of S. eboracensis as separate from other known hybrids.

The book explores a fictional modern world war scenario, set in the 1990s and involving the dissolution of NATO. Plot =Background= Economic upheaval around the world in the early 1990s becomes an opportunity for France and Germany to consolidate their power in Europe through an alliance called the European Confederation or EurCon. However, it is a continental partnership in name only; France provides the political power with the Germans carrying economic muscle. The instability and the countries' political differences with the United States causes the dissolution of NATO in 1996. =Story= The main plot takes place in 1998. Because North African immigrants are flooding Europe looking for work, riots in France and Germany prompts both countries to force a number of former Warsaw Pact nations to accept them in various factories. The first of these is a Eurocopter plant in Hungary. To further ensure subservience to EurCon, military governments are installed in several countries. The Russian army launches a coup in Moscow as well and put the incumbent Russian president under house arrest. Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia stand up against EurCon, which gradually deploys combat troops to their borders. France also negotiates with Russia to stop natural-gas shipments to Poland. The United States comes in to support Poland by sending an LNG tanker to Gdańsk; French covert operatives, however, blow it up in the harbor. The U.S. Navy starts sending armed convoys to force a breakthrough of the Baltic Sea and keep the supply lines open. French oppression in Eastern Europe comes to a head in May 1998 when a people's uprising in Budapest results in the puppet regime's collapse. Seeing the turmoil as a potential harbinger for unrest, France orders military forces to subjugate the Hungarians days later; however, the Hungarian Army slows down the French assault. The French and Germans invade Poland two months after the attack on Hungary. Because of heavy opposition, the Poles figure out that the EurCon armies plan to envelop Polish forces in a pincer movement and pull them out to safe havens in Eastern Poland. Meanwhile, the US convoys in the North Sea are still on track for Poland. EurCon mobilizes their air forces to stop the Americans, who have laid a trap. Much of the EurCon strike force is destroyed, and a last-ditch attempt to destroy the U.S. fleet with ASMP nuclear-tipped missiles is thwarted. The failed nuclear attack forces the US to launch Operation Counterweight - a concerted strike on enemy facilities in France and Germany proper. A B-52 raid levels French resupply facilities in Metz while a surgical strike destroys France's S3 IRBM silos in the Plateau d'Albion, Vaucluse. Some EurCon planes in the Polish front are sent home for local defense. Behind the scenes, the French seeks Russian intervention against the anti-EurCon forces, which are fighting delaying actions to buy time for the American troops disembarking in Gdańsk. CIA operatives make contact loyalist Russian officers and learn that the EurCon-Russia treaty will both lead to a massive Russian invasion of Europe and French support for an ultra-nationalist plan for Russia to forcibly re-create the Soviet Union; the CIA agents are shocked when the lead loyalist officer bluntly says that the treaty can be killed off by wiping out the top conspirators before they can send enforcement orders from Moscow. Although the negotiations are complete, the assassination team successfully eliminates emissaries from both sides before the orders are transmitted. The Russian President is also rescued and Russian forces assembling at the Polish frontier waiting for the attack signal are ordered to withdraw instead. The EurCon attack is finally stopped when elements of the US 101st Airborne Division hold the line in a wooded area near the town of Swiecie in time for other US armored units to reinforce them. Angered at the lack of reconnaissance of the US lines, French commanders consider redirecting part of the other EurCon forces in Hungary to join the push north. A German colonel already angry at the French holding back their troops while German forces are left to die as cannon fodder leads fellow troops in deserting the French. The Germans fight off a French attack on their command post. Word of the attack and the revelations about the Franco-Russian negotiations leads Germany to sever their ties with EurCon; the German chancellor who negotiated the country's membership is forced to resign. With US assistance, Belgium and the Netherlands declare war on France, which finds itself bereft of allies when the other EurCon member-states desert as well. The French Fifth Republic also falls; French President Nicolas Desaix, who engineered the establishment of EurCon, is arrested and petty thugs hired by the DGSE kill him in his cell. The murder prompts the newly established French Sixth Republic to finally take action against the DGSE and its associated organizations. With the war finally over, the United States hosts an international free-trade summit in London. US troops in Poland also return home.

It is known to infect soybean crops. Description BPMV is the viral pathogen that causes the disease Bean Pod Mottle in soybeans and other legumes such as snap peas. BPMV is a species in the plant pathogenic virus family Comoviridae, and genus Comovirus characterized by icosahedral symmetry, non- enveloped, having two single stranded positive-sense RNAs (RNA-1 and RNA-2) separately encapsulated in isomeric particles, and are between 28 and 30 nm in diameter. (Bradshaw, 2007Bradshaw, Jeffrey Donald, \\"Bean pod mottle virus biology and management in Iowa\\" (2007). Retrospective Theses and Dissertations. Paper 15938.). The virus can overwinter in leaf-feeding beetle vectors (such as the bean leaf beetle), survive in perennial host species, and in virus-infected seed. In the North Central Region, the bean leaf beetle (Cerotoma trifurcate) is the most influential vector, by feeding on infected legumes and transferring virus particles to the next plant it lands on to feed. The BPMV disease has most significantly affected soybeans; causing yield losses, reduced seed quality, and predisposing the plant to infection from the Phomopsis fungus, among other consequences. (Soybean Research and Information Initiative, 2016Soybean Research & Information Initiative. \\"Bean Pod Mottle Virus.\\" Soybean Research & Information Initiative - Bean Pod Mottle Virus. Soybean Research & Information Initiative, n.d. Web. 13 Nov. 2016. <http://www.soybeanresearchinfo.com/diseases/beanpodmottlevirus.html>.) =Symptoms= Typical soybean foliage symptoms of BPMV include leaf mottling (if present), which is the appearance of yellow and green blotches on the leaf as well as leaf rugosity. Symptoms vary between different host species and virus strains. Mottling can be seen more severely on younger leaves with a distorted or blistery appearance. In stressful conditions such as hot weather and during the reproductive stages there are less symptoms. BPMV may also be a cause of green stem syndrome resulting in green stems and leaves while the pods and rest of the field has matured. Seed infected with BPMV can be discolored or mottled. All of these symptoms are difficult to differentiate from other viruses or pathogens, so seeing these symptoms does not necessarily guarantee the plant has BPMV, lab testing can confirm. There can also be a combination of pathogens infecting the plant which can affect the severity of symptoms. Insect activity, especially of the bean leaf beetle or other known vectors, can increase the chance of BPMV presence. (University of Minnesota Extension, 2016\\"Bean Pod Mottle Virus.\\" Bean Pod Mottle Virus : Crop Diseases : University of Minnesota Extension. University of Minnesota Extension, n.d. Web. 13 Nov. 2016. <http://www.extension.umn.edu/agriculture/crop- diseases/soybean/beanpodmottle.html>.) Pathogenesis BPMV can be transferred via insect vector such as the bean leaf beetle or from infected seed which is a low occurrence (Michigan State University Field Crop Pathology), although it is still not fully understood how the virus gets from one host from another host, if not bean leaf beetles. Being a non-persistent virus, when the bean beetle feeds on infected tissue, the virus is carried around the mouthparts of the insect to the next host the beetle feeds on. The feeding creates an easy opening for the virus to get in, after which the virus begins its attack on the host. The virus enters the host cell and replicates, then spreads to the surrounding cells, making its way through the plant systemically, as the plant develops symptoms. RNA-1 codes for replication proteins, and the proteinase and putative helicase are linked to symptomology of the virus. RNA-2 codes for coat and movement proteins, which are important in the cell-to-cell movement of BPMV. Once the virus reaches the seed, it is believed that it is harbored in the seed coat, not actually infecting the embryo. This would result in the virus waiting for an opening to infect the new plant, such as the germination period where damage to the cotyledons can take place. Seed-seedling transmission occurrences are low. BPMV can also survive on an alternate host, which the beetle would transfer to the soybeans. (Byamukama, 2008Byamukama, Emmanuel, \\"Bean pod mottle virus: Spatial and temporal dynamics at different spatial scales and the impact of time of infection on soybean yield and quality\\" (2008). Graduate Theses and Dissertations. Paper 11856.) Agronomic Impact BPMV infected seed that is planted will grow into an infected seedling which have the most severe yield losses, between 10-40% reductions have been reported. In addition to yield, BPMV can reduce grain quality through protein and oil content, reduced seed quality and performance (discolored appearance, low germination and seedling vigor), delayed plant maturation, and the predisposition to other stresses and diseases (such as infection of Phomopsis fungus decreasing germination of seed and seedling vigor). (Smith, Wisconsin Field Crops PathologySmith, Damon. \\"Bean Pod Mottle Virus.\\" Wisconsin Field Crops Pathology. University of Wisconsin-Extension, n.d. Web. 13 Nov. 2016.) (University of Minnesota Extension, 2016) =Management= BPMV cannot be removed from the plant once infected, so it is important to take action to avoid the virus, or prevent it from spreading. There are genetic, cultural, and chemical options which should be used together in an integrated pest management plan, in addition to managing the vector presence as well. * Genetic Resistance: Partial resistance to BPMV is available in some soybean varieties meaning there is less yield reductions, lower rates of green stem and seed mottling. Varieties with higher resistance are in development, thus commercially unavailable at this time. Other plants in the genus Glycine have been identified as immune, so it may be possible in the future to develop resistant lines in soybeans by interspecific crosses (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2016Laboratory for Soybean Disease Research. \\"Bean Pod Mottle Virus.\\" Information on Bean Pod Mottle Virus, Laboratory for, U of I. University of Illinois at Urbana- Champaign, n.d. Web. 13 Nov. 2016. <http://soydiseases.illinois.edu/index.cfm?category=diseases&disease;=93>.). * Cultural Tactics: Plant certified, virus-free, good quality seed Consider delayed planting of soybeans to avoid high populations of the bean leaf beetle, although other insects may be more prevalent then. * Chemical tactics: If bean leaf beetles have been spotted in the field in addition to the virus in the past year, spray insecticides or treat seed with an insecticide to manage the bean leaf beetle, field history is important to consider in timing of foliar sprays. If the virus is present but the insect vector is not, spraying insecticides will not be effective in managing the disease. Management of the virus is difficult because there is not a wide range of options, and none can solve the problem completely, but a comprehensive strategy is more effective than depending on one method. Field scouting is useful in tracking the disease presence and future management. Scouting for virus symptoms during cool temperatures and rapid growth periods because optimum plant growth conditions will more readily show symptoms of the disease than stressful periods. Also, scout for bean leaf beetles. The first- generation peak population should be checked around early July during the late vegetative or early reproductive growth stages. The second-generation bean leaf beetle peak should be checked during pod-fill in August.

It broadcasts to the city of Lincoln on 107.3 FM and at its website, Online. History Launched in August 2007, Siren FM won its licence after a series of annual student RSLs (Restricted Service Licences) at the campus in Lincoln (UK) and previously at the university's Hull campus from 1996, when the institution was known as the University of Lincolnshire and Humberside. Siren moved to Lincoln in 1998 during the first stages of the gradual move of the university to the city. After operating its annual RSLs on FM each April or May it began to augment its output by broadcasting online for much of each academic year. The university was awarded its community radio licence by Ofcom in 2006,Ofcom awards nine new community radio licences  Ofcom and began test transmissions for the new station at midday on 14 July 2007. The primary aim of the station is to serve the young people and communities of the greater Lincoln area, meaning that Siren is catering for a younger audience than its mainstream neighbours BBC Lincolnshire and Lincs FM. As a result, the station is more involved with diverse communities outside of the university since it began broadcasting programmes on 11 August 2007 under the leadership of Managing Editor Andrew David, a former BBC television and radio broadcaster. [Accessed 16 August 2010] [Accessed 16 August 2010] The station fitted a new antenna with a co-linear stacked dipole aerial on 20 August 2008 to improve reception in the north of the city. Its situation on a university campus offers opportunities for students to showcase their work and in some cases undertake assessments live on air with Journalism students producing weekly news and current affairs programmes. Catering for a younger audience than the mainstream stations heard in Lincoln, once a year schoolchildren are invited to produce and present their own programmes. There have also been projects aimed at communicating language and science education to a wider audience and funds granted to support the development of community journalism.http://www.adm.heacademy.ac.uk/projects/adm-hea-projects/learning- and-teaching-projects-2008-9/applying-principles-to-practice-developing-civic- journalism-on-a-university-based-community-radio-station Siren has supported a number of organisations in the Lincoln area to facilitate young people's access to the media. From November 2008 it has been involved with the Lincolnshire Young Journalist Academy (LYJA) and from Sept 2009 to June 2010 was working with c1Media, the Lincolnshire Employment Accommodation Project (LEAP), Lincoln College and others in a Media Box funded project. The station has been keen to raise funds for a range of charities including the Haiti earthquake in 2010 and the BBC's Children in Need. Young people on Siren have been recognised with a number of broadcasting and journalism prizes. One of the contributors won 2 International Edward R Murrow Awards in 2010 for documentary and factual programming, the station was nominated in the same year for a BBC Partnership Achievement Award for its journalism and community outreach work and in 2009 a volunteer on the station was short-listed in the same category. The University's School of Journalism won the Broadcast Journalism Training Council's (BJTC's) Award for Innovation in Broadcast Journalism Training in part for their work with Siren. In 2015 it was named East Midlands Station of the Year and has won its 6th Edward R. Murrow RTDNA award for News Documentary. On 25 September 2017, Siren FM rebranded to be known of as Siren Radio.

Inspired by Fascist Italy and Vichy France, the group attracted support from many young nationalists during the Algerian war (1954–62), especially in the French colonial army. Promoting street violence and extra- parliamentarian insurrection against the Fourth Republic, members hoped the turmoils of the wars of decolonization would lead to a coup d'état followed by a nationalist regime. Jeune Nation was the most significant French neo-fascist movement during the 1950s, gathering at its height 3,000 to 4,000 members. Suspected of a bomb attack in the National Assembly, Jeune Nation was dissolved by official decree during the May 1958 crisis. The organization nonetheless survived through the 1960s via several other nationalist organizations, primarily the Federation of Nationalist Students (1960–1967), the Organisation Armée Secrète (1961–1962), Europe-Action (1963–1966), Occident (1964–1968) and L'Œuvre Française (1968–2013), all established by former Jeune Nation members.  History  = Background: 1943–1948 = Jeune Nation's founder, Pierre Sidos, joined the fascist Parti Franciste in 1943 at 16 years old, the minimum required age. His father, François Sidos, was executed in 1946 for his involvement in the Vichy paramilitary Milice. Avoiding a harsher sentence as a minor at the time of the events, Pierre was convicted to five years in jail. The time he spent serving his sentence comforted the political convictions he had built before and during the war, and Pierre Sidos began to imagine \\"Jeune Nation\\" during prison time. Discredited by the earlier European fascist experiences, nationalist parties scored poorly in the French elections from 1945 until the rise of the Front National in the 1980s. Neo-fascists groups nonetheless saw in the immediate post-war new reasons to swing into action, mainly the fight against communist expansion and the defense of the French empire against decolonization. = Creation and emergence: 1949–1953 = Released earlier from prison on 4 August 1948, Sidos quickly contacted his brothers François et Jacques to help him work on his project. In 1949, the final structure of the organization had been designed but the Sidos brothers lacked money, and far-right sponsors were not abundant in the immediate post-war. Pierre then requested assistance from Jeanne Pajot, a rich bonapartist and a friend of Pierre Taittinger, former leader of the Jeunesses Patriotes. She accepted to fund them and the movement—called at that time \\"La Jeune Nation\\"—held its first presentation on 22 October 1949 in Pajot's apartment. In 1952, they published a monthly magazine, Peuple de France et d'Outre-mer (\\"People of France and Overseas France\\"). The movement also tried to establish links with other nationalist right-wingers abroad and Sidos went to London to visit fellow groups. They were soon joined by other nationalists like Albert Heuclin, Jean Marot, Jacques Wagner and Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour. On 23 March 1950, the group was officially declared to the Prefecture of Police, but it remained publicly unknown for several years. In 1954, two events changed the destiny of Jeune Nation: the end of the First Indochina War on July 20, and the beginning of the Algerian War of Independence on November 1. = Street violence: 1954–1957 = The movement experienced a sudden fame and a rise in membership after the return of military personnel from south-East Asia. On 11 November 1954, ten days after the beginning of the Algerian War, Pierre Sidos announced the official birth of the movement \\"Jeune Nation\\" under its final name. Tixier- Vignancour, opposed to violent actions, soon left the group to create his own organization, the Rassemblement National Français. Jeune Nation held its first congress on 11 November 1955, when they adopted the Celtic cross as their emblem. Dismissing mass parties, Sidos aimed at creating a small and faithful army, with a revolutionary general staff ready to seize power and rule as a military junta when their moment has come. Labeling themselves the \\"successors of those of 1934\\" and targeting young people in their recruitment, Jeune Nation was joined in 1956 by Dominique Venner, then 21, who later opposed Sidos and mark a shift between euro-nationalism and the \\"nostalgic neo- Petainists of Pierre Sidos.\\" If they were largely inspired by the ideologies of fascist Italy and Vichy France, Jeune Nation however began to break with the collaborationist circles that had been protecting them since Sidos' prison time. As Gaullists and former resisters were joining their ranks during the Algerian war, Sidos banned any evocation of the period 1933–1945 among its militants, with only a few events like the commemorations of Robert Brasillach or that of 6 February 1934 allowed to take place. The group was known for their violent attacks, especially on communists. On 9–10 October 1954, a commando led by Sidos carjacked a van transporting issues of the communist newspaper L’Humanité Dimanche, then destroyed them and assaulted the driver who died a few months later as a result of his injuries. In March 1958, Jean- Marie Le Pen testified at the trial of four accused Jeune Nation militants. During demonstrations organized on 8 November 1956 to denounce the Soviet military intervention in the Hungarian Uprising, Jeune Nation stormed and partly set to fire the headquarters of the Communist Party in Paris. In the midst of protests at place de l'Étoile in April 1954, they mauled Prime Minister Joseph Laniel and Minister of Defense René Pleven, and on 25 November 1957 Jeune Nation organized a violent protest in front of the American embassy to denounce arms exports towards Algeria. = Dissolution and recreation attempts: 1958–1960 = Jeune Nation was dissolved on 15 May 1958 by an official decree of Jules Moch, then Minister of the Interior, two days after the putsch of Algiers and the beginning of the May 1958 crisis. The group had been suspected of a bomb attack that occurred on 6 February 1958 in a lavatory at the National Assembly and was involved in the troubles of May 13 in Algeria. The association was regardless declared again under a new name to the Police Prefecture on 7 October 1958, and officially recreated as \\"Parti Nationaliste\\" by Pierre Sidos and Dominique Venner during a congress attended by around 600 people on 6–8 February 1959. The new organization was designed by Venner as a coordination structure for all far-right movements in France via a Comité d’Entente (Entente Committee). It was dissolved only four days later on 12 February 1959 following violent protests against Prime Minister Michel Debré in Algeria. Both Venner and Sidos were eventually arrested, respectively in April 1961 and July 1962, after the issue of an arrest warrant on 24 January 1960 for \\"recreating a disbanded league\\" and \\"compromising State security\\". They were convicted on 19 June 1963 to a suspended 3-year jail sentence and a 2,000 Fr fine. The bi-monthly magazine Jeune Nation, launched on 5 July 1958 to serve as an ideological organ for the rebirth of the group, was not affected by the new dissolution of February 1959. The periodical, which violently attacked Charles de Gaulle as far as calling for his assassination, had turned into a monthly magazine in January after financial and readership issues. Articles were written by Jacques Ploncard d'Assac, Henry Coston, Pierre-Antoine Cousteau or Tixier-Vignancour. Joined by the young François d'Orcival, Pierre Poichet and Georges Schmeltz (known as \\"Pierre Marcenet\\") in September 1959, the last issue of the magazine Jeune Nation was seized four months later by the police on 28 January 1960. The three students then decided to found on 12 April 1960 the Federation of Nationalist Students (FEN). Initially in favour of the project, Sidos eventually opposed to the euro-nationalist stance introduced by Venner and adopted by the FEN. He broke with the latter in 1964 to create Occident.  Ideology  Jeune Nation defended anti-parliamentarianism, corporatism, the French army and the colonial empire, racism, antisemitism, as well as violent actions to overthrow the regime. They also dismissed political parties, communism, liberal democracy and its embodiment: the United States. = Agenda = Their political agenda was the establishment of an \\"authoritarian and popular, national and social State,\\" similar to the Révolution nationale of Vichy France: a new army to \\"educate the youth\\", the expropriation of housings formerly possessed by \\"expelled métèques [wogs] deemed undesirable\\", an Italian fascist-like corporatist unionism, the \\"elimination of stateless capitalism and effortless incomes\\" and the founding of a state led by a \\"selected and politically educated\\" elite. Jeune Nation was however less vichyst than other contemporary nostalgic movements that aimed essentially at defending the memory of Philippe Pétain. The movement tried to launch a revolutionary fight outside of the parliamentary system in order to overthrow the Fourth Republic, which was according to them \\"the only hope for nationalism\\".Pierre Sidos: \\"Ce ne sont ni les électeurs ni les élus qui sauveront la France : il faut une révolution\\" (Jeune Nation, November 1958 (10), p. 3) Jean Malardier, adherent of Jeune Nation and former LVF member, described the group as \\"aspiring and devoting the whole of itself to the national insurrection\\". The ideas of \\"democracy\\" and \\"decadence\\" were interwoven in the group's analysis of the society and their doctrine stated that \\"fighting against [France's] decadence [meant] fighting against the [democratic] regime\\". Jeune Nation also referred to the achievement of a \\"second revolution\\", the first one being that of 1940 and evidently not that of 1789. They also envisaged the construction of Europe \\"from Narvik to Cape Town\\" and \\"from Brest to Bucharest\\", \\"founded on the common civilization and destiny of the white race\\". = Structure = Pierre Sidos was the chief ideologue and leader of Jeune Nation, his brother François the president, and Jean Malardier the treasurer. = Symbols = The group used the Celtic Cross as their symbol, which may come from an initiation to Celtic esotericism Pierre Sidos received in prison (1946–48) from Marcel Bibé, a former Bezen Perrot member. During his internment, Sidos began to write about druidism and the Celtic Cross, which he described as the allegory of the \\"walking sun and universal life\\" in his prison notes. Sidos has stated that he was looking for a simple emblem to reproduce, unlike the eagle or the wild boar used by fascist groups at that time. Since its 1949 revival by Jeune Nation, the symbol has become popular among far-right movements in France and beyond in Europe.

If they tried to import the OAS structures in Europe (via OAS-Métro), they never managed to spread out the armed insurrection outside of Algeria. Pierre Sidos created Occident in 1964, but broke with the group in 1965–1966. He then founded L'Œuvre Française in 1968, and remained its leader until 2012. Following the ban of its organ Le Soleil in 1990, L'Œuvre Française founded in early 1994 in new magazine named Jeune Nation. L'Œuvre dissolved by official decree on 24 July 2013 along with its youth movement, \\"Jeunesses Nationalistes\\", the website was re-activated by nationalist militants Yvan Benedetti and Alexandre Gabriac, with the copyright \\"1958–2013 Jeune Nation\\". = Post-fascist split = The Federation of Nationalist Students (FEN) was created in 1960 by former Jeune Nation students after the publication of a \\"Manifesto of the Class of '60\\" where they committed themselves to \\"action of profound consequence\\", as opposed to \\"sterile activism\\", thus breaking with the street insurrection previously advocated by Jeune Nation. Dominique Venner launched his nationalist magazine Europe-Action in 1963 and aimed at removing \\"old ideas\\" from nationalism and fascism, such as anti-parliamentarianism, anti-intellectualism or a patriotism reduced to the boundaries of the nation- state—promoting instead a pan-European nationalism. Venner also abandoned the myth of the coup de force (\\"power grab\\") and asserted that a political revolution would not be able to happen before a cultural one, which could be reached only via the public promotion of nationalist ideas until they achieve majority approval.

In June 1941, Anne Gould married John Hauberg, a timber heir, who attended Princeton University and graduated from the University of Washington College of Forestry in 1949.Recollections of a Civic Errand Boy, the autobiography of John Henry Hauberg, Junior, 2003, Pacific Denkmann Co. Anne Hauberg's philanthropic career was launched when two of the couple's three children proved to be mentally disabled. The Haubergs gave funds for the creation of the Pilot School for Neurologically Impaired Children which opened in 1960 in two small buildings on the University of Washington campus. The School continues today as the EEU (Experimental Education Unit), a portion of the University of Washington Center on Human Development and Disability. In the 1950s, the Haubergs emerged as patrons of the arts in Seattle and the Pacific Northwest. They not only collected art works, but provided support for emerging Northwest artists. By the 1960s, Anne Hauberg particularly focused on supporting the crafts through another philanthropic organization, the Friends of the Crafts. By the 1960s, Anne Hauberg was involved in the Seattle Municipal Art Commission, and she was a founding member of the civic activist organization, the \\"Committee of 33.\\" In 1969, Anne and John Hauberg together supported Dale Chihuly's idea for a glass-blowing summer school program in the rural Northwest. The subsequent development of this program became the Pilchuck Glass School. Anne Gould Hauberg and John Hauberg divorced in 1978-79. Anne Hauberg continued her activities in the arts and was deeply involved in the Seattle Art Museum, the Tacoma Art Museum, the Pilchuck School and other Northwest arts organizations. In addition, she was an honorary member of Northwest Designer Craftsmen. In 2007, the University of Washington Libraries' Artist Images Award was renamed the Anne Gould Hauberg Artist Images Award in her honor.Program for 2007 Anne Gould Hauberg Artist Images Award, October 5, 2007.

The family Geminiviridae consists of nine genera (Becurtovirus, Begomovirus, Capulavirus, Curtovirus, Eragrovirus, Grablovirus, Mastrevirus, Topocuvirus, Turncurtovirus) based on their host range, virus genome structure, and type of insect vector. BCTV is a Curtovirus affecting hundreds of plants. The only known vector is the beet leafhopper, which is native to the Western United States. History Beet curly top virus was first discovered in 1888 in the Western parts of the United States. The virus wasn't fully recognized until 1907 when people started to realize that the virus was affecting their crops which led to increasing yield loss. As the BCTV began to surface and multiply within the United States, it affected many states (California, Idaho, Utah, and Washington) located in the Western area. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), many crops were destroyed from the disease and led to a considerable economic loss. The BCTV has also been known to affect other countries including Mexico, South America, and the Old World (the Mediterranean basin and the Middle East). Structure BCTV contains a single-stranded circular DNA that is encapsulated in a twinned icosahedral capsid. The virus DNA contains a monopartite genome that is made up of three viral sense and four complementary open reading frames (ORF). The ORF Complementary 1 (C1) contains the code for the replication initiator protein (Rep) which is responsible for initiating replication with a host cell. C3 also plays an important role in the replication process. C2 is involved in causing the disease (pathogenicity) while C4 plays an important role in developing the major symptoms that comes with the virus, such as hyperplasia, curling of the leaves, and deformation. Transmission BCTV is transmitted to nymphs of beet leafhoppers when they feed on the phloem of plants that are infected with the virus. Even though the leafhopper is infected with the virus, the virus does not replicate within the leafhopper and causes no harm to them. BCTV cannot be passed on to their offspring. The only way for offspring to be infected with the virus is if they fed on any plants infected with the BCTV. Once the beet leafhoppers ingest the virus, it moves from their digestive tract to the salivary glands. Once the infected leafhoppers migrate and feed on healthy plants, they transmit the virus by eating the phloem. The infected beet leafhoppers are able to infect various plants for the rest of their lifetime. Hosts BCTV has been known to affect more than 300 plant species from 44 different families. Sugar beets are known to be the main host for this virus but it also affect many plants including beans, celery, spinach, melons, peppers, squashes, cucumbers, and tomatoes. Younger plants seem to be more susceptible to damage and developed more symptoms from the virus compared to adult plants. It has been shown that the BCTV tend to infect more dicotyledonous hosts while no monocotyledonous plants have been recognized as a host for this virus. Symptoms Plants that are infected will tend to display early symptoms within 5 days. The BCTV causes many symptoms including: *Vein swelling (the most earliest and common symptom) *Leaf curling *Yellowing of leaves with purple veins *Necrosis and hyperplasia of the phloem *Fruit deformation *Premature fruit ripening *Reduced fruit quality and yield *Stunting *Death of young seedlings Environment The beet leafhopper is commonly found in tropical and subtropical countries that have warm climates. They have been found to be residing within the Western part of the United States, Mexico, South America, and the Old World (the Mediterranean basin and the Middle East). During the winter in California, the beet leafhopper would migrate to the foothill of the coastal range located on the west side of the Central Valley and lay eggs in the perennial weeds and buckhorn plantains. When the nymphs of beet leafhoppers are born, they would consume the infected weeds and plants causing them to acquire the virus. During the mid to late spring, the adult leafhoppers would travel to the agricultural area of the Central Valley to infect other healthy plants and weeds. As fall approaches, the adult leafhoppers migrate back to the foothill and begin the process again. Environmental impacts The BCTV caused many problems for farmers. When the virus was first recognized in 1907, California farmers were detrimentally affected and had a large yield loss in crops. Other states including Idaho were also greatly affected by the virus. The BCTV nearly wiped out Idaho's sugar beet industry until they effectively developed sugar beets that were resistant to the virus in 1935. From the early 1900s till now, farmers are still having difficulties in containing this virus. In 2001, the Central Valley located in California had an enormous loss in crops valuing up to millions of dollars. In 2002, the bean production located in the Columbian basin of Washington State was also afflicted with the virus and encountered many losses. Treatment and management As the BCTV became more difficult to manage, many methods were developed to help contain this virus. Methods included breeding curly top virus resistant crops, planting earlier or later in the year, the use of insecticides, and weed management. In 1918, the first project known to produce resistant sugar beets was established. After developing their first curly top resistant sugar beets in 1926, researchers determined the plants were unable to fully resist the virus and were still susceptible to infection. Due to the increasing number of curly top virus outbreaks in California, many groups joined in the development of curly top resistant cultivars. California was successful in developing curly top resistant cultivars that were suitable to growing conditions in California. This method was soon abandoned in the mid-1900s due to low yields. The high yielding susceptible crops were quickly adopted across parts of California that were not affected with the BCTV. Crop production was successful for several years until the virus resurfaced in 2001 and 2003, causing major losses. Many states which were afflicted with the BCTV soon began using insecticides to reduce the number of BCTV outbreaks. In 1943, California adopted the BCTV management program, which is still running today. This program focuses on the use of insecticides to reduce the amount of beet leafhoppers by spraying chemicals in non-crop areas where the beet leafhoppers reside. Killing the beet leafhoppers before they invade susceptible host crops leads to fewer crops being infected. Slowly, the use of insecticides was questioned due to its effects on the environment, non-target organisms, and endangered species. As the number of beet leafhoppers continued to rise, the EPA ordered the use of clothianidin to help control the insects in 2006, 2007 and 2008. In 1949, another curly top management program was developed in southern Idaho. It focused on the use of insecticides and specific planting times to control the virus. The method of specific planting dates was inconsistent and led to an unsuccessful management of the virus. In 1969, the program was eliminated due to the increase in urbanization and shortage of funds available to keep the program running. In Arizona, field observations indicated that a delay in planting until late October to November may help decrease BCTV incidence; however, changing the planting dates may not always be successful because the movements of beet leafhoppers are inconsistent and unpredictable. Many weeds are also host for the beet leafhoppers; therefore, proper weed control can help decrease the incidence of BCTV.

In 1948, Pechersky was arrested by the Soviet authorities along with his brother during the countrywide Rootless cosmopolitan campaign against Jews suspected of pro- Western leanings but released later due in part to mounting international pressure. Pechersky was prevented by the Soviet government from leaving the country to testify in international trials related to Sobibor, including the Eichmann Trial in Israel; foreign investigators were only allowed to collect his testimony under KGB supervision. The last time he was refused permission to exit the country and testify was in 1987, for a trial in Poland. Pre-war life and career Pechersky, a son of a Jewish lawyer, was born on February 22, 1909, in Kremenchuk, Poltava Governorate, Russian Empire (now Ukraine). In 1915, his family moved to Rostov-on-Don where he eventually worked as an electrician at a locomotive repair factory.Arguments & Facts Magazine Profile : August 10, 2008 issue (in Russian) Retrieved on 2009-04-21 After graduating from university with a diploma in music and literature, he became an accountant and manager of a small school for amateur musicians.Erenburg, Grossman. Black Book: Uprising in Sobibor (in Russian) Retrieved on 2009-04-21 World War II On 22 June 1941, the day when Germany invaded the Soviet Union, Pechersky was conscripted into the Soviet Red Army with a rank of junior lieutenant. By September 1941, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant quartermaster (class II).Top Secret Magazine profile of Pechersky: Forgotten Hero Retrieved on 2009-04-21 In the early autumn of 1941, he rescued his wounded commander from being captured by the Germans. He did not receive any medals for this deed. One of his fellow soldiers reportedly said: \\"Sasha, if what you've done doesn't make you a hero, I don't know who is!\\" In October 1941, during the Battle of Moscow, their unit was surrounded and captured by the Germans in the city of Vyazma, Smolensk Oblast. Captured, Pechersky soon contracted typhus, but survived the seven-month-long illness. In May 1942, he escaped along with four other prisoners of war, but they were all recaptured the same day. He was then sent to a penal camp at Borisov, Belarus, and from there to a prisoner of war (POW) camp located in the forest next to the city of Minsk. During a mandatory medical examination it was discovered that he was circumcised. Pechersky recalled a German medical officer asking him: \\"Do you admit to being a Jew?\\" He admitted it, since any denial would result in a whipping, and was thrown into a cellar called \\"the Jewish grave\\" along with other Jewish prisoners of war, where for 10 days he sat in complete darkness, being fed 100 grams (3.5 oz) of wheat and a cup of water every second day. On August 20, 1942, Pechersky was sent to a SS-operated Arbeitslager, a work camp, in Minsk. The camp housed 500 Jews from the Minsk Ghetto, as well as Jewish Soviet POWs; there were also between 200–300 Soviet inmates whom the Germans labeled as incorrigible: people who were suspected of contacting the Soviet partisans and those who were repeatedly truant while working for the Germans. The prisoners were starved and worked from dawn till dusk.Jewish Electronic Encyclopedia (in Russian) Retrieved on 2009-04-21 Pechersky wrote about the Minsk work camp: Sobibor extermination camp On 18 September 1943, Pechersky, along with 2,000 Jews from Minsk including about 100 Soviet Jewish POWs, was placed in a train cattle wagon which arrived at the Sobibor extermination camp on September 23, 1943. Eighty prisoners from the train, including Pechersky, were selected for work in Lager II. The remaining 1,920 Jews were immediately led to the gas chambers.Arad, Yitzhak. Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka: The Operation Reinhard Death Camps. Indiana University Press. 1987. Pechersky later recalled his thoughts as the train pulled up to Sobibor, \\"How many circles of hell were there in Dante's Inferno? It seems there were nine. How many have already passed? Being surrounded, being captured, camps in Vyazma, Smolensk, Borisov, Minsk... And finally I am here. What's next?\\" The appearance of Soviet POWs produced an enormous impression on Sobibor prisoners: \\"hungry hope-filled eyes following their every move\\". Pechersky wrote about his first day in Sobibor: During his third day at Sobibor, Alexander Pechersky earned the respect of fellow prisoners by standing up to Karl Frenzel, an SS senior officer, as the incident was recalled by Leon Feldhendler. =Escape plan= Pechersky's plan merged the idea of a mass escape with vengeance: to help as many prisoners as possible to escape while executing SS officers and guards. His final goal was to join up with the partisans and continue fighting the Nazis. Five days after arriving at Sobibor, Pechersky was again approached by Solomon Leitman on behalf of Feldhendler, the leader of the camp's Polish Jews.Rashke, Richard. Escape From Sobibor – Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1982 Leitman was one of the few prisoners who understood Russian and Pechersky did not speak either Yiddish or Polish. Pechersky was invited to talk with a group of Jewish prisoner leaders from Poland, to whom he spoke about the Red Army victory in the Battle of Stalingrad and partisan victories. When one of the prisoners asked him why the partisans would not rescue them from Sobibor, Pechersky reportedly replied: \\"What for? To free us all? The partisans have their hands full already. Nobody will do our job for us.\\" The Jewish prisoners who had worked at the Bełżec extermination camp were sent to Sobibor to be exterminated when Bełżec closed. From a note found among the clothing of the murdered, the Sobibor prisoners learned that those who had been killed were from work groups in the Bełżec camp. The note said: \\"We worked for a year in Belzec. I don't know where they're taking us now. They say to Germany. In the freight cars there are dining tables. We received bread for three days, and tins and liquor. If all this is a lie, then know that death awaits you too. Do not trust the Germans. Avenge our blood!\\" The liquidation of the Camps . Retrieved on 2010-08-28 The leadership of the Polish Jews was aware that Bełżec and Treblinka had been closed, dismantled and all remaining prisoners had been sent to the gas- chambers and they suspected that Sobibor would be next. There was a great urgency in coming up with a good escape plan and Pechersky, with his army experience, was their best hope. The escape had to also coincide with the time when the Sobibor's deputy commandant, Gustav Wagner, went on vacation, since the prisoners felt that he was sharp enough to uncover the escape plan.Blatt, Thomas Toivi. From the Ashes of Sobibor. Northwestern University Press. 1997.US Holocaust Memorial Museum: Interview with Esther Raab Retrieved on 2009-05-08 =Luka= Pechersky clandestinely met with Feldhendler under the guise of meeting Luka, a woman he was supposedly involved with. Luka is often described as an 18-year-old woman from \\"Holland\\", but records indicate she was 28 and from Germany; her real name was . After the war, Pechersky insisted that the relationship was platonic. Her fate after the escape was never established and she was never seen alive again.Schelvis, Jules. Vernichtungslager Sobibor. Published by Unrast. Hamburg, 2003 During an interview with Thomas Blatt, Pechersky said the following regarding Luka: \\"Although I knew her only about two weeks, I will never forget her. I informed her minutes before the escape of the plan. She has given me a shirt. She said, 'it's a good luck shirt, put it on right now', and I did. It's now in the museum. I lost her in the turmoil of the revolt and never saw her again.\\" Toivi Blatt interviews Sasha Pechersky about Luka in 1980 Retrieved on 2009-05-08 =The uprising= According to Pechersky's plan, the prisoners would assassinate the German SS staff, leaving the auxiliary guards leaderless, obtain weapons and kill the remaining guards. Jewish Poles were assigned German SS guards that they were supposed to lure inside the workshops under some pretext and silently kill. Ester Raab, a survivor of the escape, recalled: \\"The plan was, at 4 o’clock (pm), should start (the escape), everybody has to kill his SS man, and his guard at his place of work\\". Only a small circle of trusted Jewish Pole inmates were aware of the escape plan as they did not trust the Jews from other European countries. On 14 October 1943, Pechersky's escape plan began. During the day, several German SS men were lured to workshops on a variety of pretexts, such as being fitted for new boots or expensive clothes. The SS men were then stabbed to death with carpenters' axes, awls and chisels discreetly recovered from property left by gassed Jews; with other tradesmen's sharp tools or with crude knives and axes made in the camp's machine shop. The blood was covered up with sawdust on the floor. The escapees were armed with a number of hand grenades, a rifle, a submachine gun and several pistols that the prisoners stole from the German living quarters, as well as the sidearms captured from the dead SS men.

Retrieved on 2009-05-08 Earlier in the day, SS-Oberscharführer Erich Bauer, at the top of the death list created by Pechersky, unexpectedly drove out to Chełm for supplies. The uprising was almost postponed since the prisoners believed that Bauer's death was necessary for the success of the escape. Bauer came back early from Chełm, discovered that SS-Scharführer Rudolf Beckmann had been assassinated and began shooting at the prisoners. The sound of the gunfire prompted Alexander Pechersky to begin the revolt earlier than planned. Pechersky screamed the code-words: \\"Hurrah, the revolt has begun!\\" Disorganized groups of prisoners ran in every direction. Ada Lichtman, a survivor of the escape recalled \\"Suddenly we heard shots... Mines started to explode. Riot and confusion prevailed, everything was thundering around. The doors of the workshop were opened, and everyone rushed through... We ran out of the workshop. All around were the bodies of the dead and wounded\\". Pechersky was able to escape into the woods and at the end of the uprising, eleven German SS personnel and an unknown number of Ukrainian guards had been killed.Sobibor Murderers Article Retrieved on 2010-09-05Yad Vashem: Escape under Fire: The Sobibor Uprising Retrieved on 2009-05-08 The Sobibor Death Camp Retrieved on 2010-09-06Sobibor survivor: 'I polished SS boots as dying people screamed Retrieved on 2010-09-06Ukrainians guards took part in extermination Retrieved on 2010-09-06 Out of approximately 550 Jewish prisoners at the Sobibor death camp, 130 chose not to participate in the uprising and remained in the camp; about 80 were killed during the escape either by machine gun fire from watchtowers or while running through a mine field in the camp's outer perimeter; 170 more were recaptured by the Nazis during searches. All who remained in the camp or caught after the escape were executed. 53 Sobibor escapees survived the war. Within days after the uprising, the SS chief Heinrich Himmler ordered the camp closed, dismantled and planted with trees. =Aftermath= Immediately after the escape, in the forest, a group of fifty prisoners followed Pechersky. After some time, Pechersky informed the Jewish Poles that he, along with a few Jewish Red Army soldiers would enter the nearby village and then shortly return with food. They allegedly collected all the money (Pechersky implies the money collection is a fabricated detail) and weapons except one rifle but never came back. In 1980, Thomas Blatt asked Pechersky why he abandoned the other survivors. Pechersky answered, Pechersky, along with two other escapees, wandered the forests until they ran into Yakov Biskowitz and another Sobibor escapee. Biskowitz testified at the Eichmann Trial regarding the meeting, The two Russian Jewish soldiers who Yahov Biskowitz met with Pechersky were Alexander Shubayev (who was responsible for killing SS-Untersturmführer Johann Niemann and was later killed fighting the Germans) and Arkady Moishejwicz Wajspapier (who was responsible for killing SS-Oberscharführer Siegfried Graetschus and Volksdeutscher Ivan Klatt, survived the war).\\"В Киеве умер последний участник восстания в концлагере Собибор Аркадий Вайспапир\\" (\\"Arkadiy Waispapier died in Kiev 11 Jan 2018\\") http://gordonua.com/news/society/v-kieve-umer-posledniy- uchastnik-vosstaniya-v-konclagere-sobibor-arkadiy-vayspapir-226764.html\\"Умер последний участник восстания в Собиборе\\" (\\"The last living participant of Sobibor uprising dies\\") https://www.vesti.ru/doc.html?id=2975127 For over a year, Pechersky fought with the Yehiel's Group partisans as a demolition expert and later with the Soviet group of Voroshilov Partisans, until the Red Army drove out the Germans from Belarus. As an escaped POW, Pechersky was conscripted into a special penal battalions, conforming to Stalin's Order No. 270 and was sent to the front to fight German forces in some of the toughest engagements of the war. Escape from Sobibor: Forgotten Heroism. Crime Magazine (in Russian). Retrieved on 2009-05-08 Pechersky's battalion commander, Major Andreev, was so shocked by his description of Sobibor that he permitted Pechersky to go to Moscow and speak to the Commission of Inquiry of the Crimes of Fascist-German Aggressors and their Accomplices. The Commission listened to Pechersky and published the report Uprising in Sobibor based on his testimony.Journal Znamia: 1945 #4 This report was included in the Black Book, one of the first comprehensive compilations about the Holocaust, written by Vasily Grossman and Ilya Ehrenburg. For fighting the Germans as part of the penal battalions, Pechersky was promoted to the rank of captain and received a medal for bravery. He was eventually discharged after a serious foot injury. In a hospital in Moscow, he was introduced to his future wife, Olga Kotova. After the war The memorial plaque on the building where Pechersky lived After the war, Pechersky returned to Rostov-on-Don, where he lived before the war and started work as administrator in an operetta theater. The mass murder of Jews at the Sobibor death camp became part of the charges against leading Nazis at the Nuremberg Trials. The International Tribunal at Nuremberg wanted to call Pechersky as a witness but the Soviet government would not allow him to travel to Germany to testify. In 1948, during Stalin's persecution of Jews, known as the 'Rootless cosmopolitan' campaign targeting those who allegedly lacked true loyalty and commitment to Stalinism and the Soviet Union, Pechersky lost his job and was briefly arrested. He was quickly released because of international pressure. Despite having lost his job because of repressions, he was awarded a medal \\"For Battle Merit\\" in 1949. He had to sell handcrafted clothes on the local market for five years because he could not find a job. Only after Stalin's death in 1953 could he find a job, in the Rostselmash factory. His brother, however, succumbed to a diabetic coma while incarcerated. Alexander Pechersky worked for a short time at a small cinema as a director.

The final time Pechersky was refused permission to leave the country and testify was in 1987 for a trial in Poland and according to his daughter, this refusal \\"just crippled my father. He almost stopped getting out of bed and instantly aged\\". Alexander Pechersky died on January 19, 1990 and was buried at the Northern cemetery in Rostov-on-Don, Russia. In 2009, Pechersky's daughter, granddaughter and two great-grandsons were living in Rostov-on-Don. Remembrance Alexander Pechersky memorial in Tel Aviv Alexander Pechersky features prominently in a Dutch-Soviet documentary Revolt in Sobibor (1989) by director Pavel Kogan. An award-winning documentary about the escape was made by Claude Lanzmann, entitled Sobibor, 14 Octobre 1943, 16 heures. The revolt was also dramatized in the 1987 British TV film Escape from Sobibor, in which Rutger Hauer received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role (Television) for his portrayal of Pechersky. Pechersky did not attend the premiere of the film; his widow later stated that the Soviet government denied him permission to travel to the United States. In 2007, 17 years after his death, a small memorial plaque was placed on the side of the building where he lived in Rostov-on-Don. One of the schools of Rostov-on-Don, school 52 was named after him and a monument near the school was erected in 2018. There is a memorial wall with his name engraved on it in Boston. Streets have been named in his honor in Safed, Israel, and in Moscow and Rostov-on-Don, Russia. A stone memorial was erected in Tel Aviv more recently.

Historic pavilions The pavilions at Lord's Cricket Ground and The Oval are typical of the Victorian architectural style often seen at most famous English grounds. The cricket pavilion in the University Parks at Oxford was designed by the leading Victorian architect Sir Thomas Graham Jackson.

Senator Burnet R. Maybank did not face a primary challenge in the summer and was therefore renominated as the Democratic Party's nominee for the election in the fall. However, his death on September 1 left the Democratic Party without a nominee and the executive committee decided to nominate state Senator Edgar A. Brown as their candidate for the election. Many South Carolinians were outraged by the party's decision to forgo a primary election and former Governor Strom Thurmond entered the race as a write-in candidate. He easily won the election and became the first U.S. senator to be elected by a write-in vote in an election where other candidates had ballot access (William Knowland of California in 1946 was the first Senate candidate to win via write-in, but the ballots in that election were blank with no candidates listed, so essentially every candidate was running a write-in campaign).Washington Post, \\"Murkowski appears to make history in Alaska\\", Debbi Wilgoren, 3 November 2010 (accessed 3 November 2010) General election campaign =State Democratic Party executive committee= Sitting Senator Burnet R. Maybank entered the 1954 contest without a challenge in the Democratic primary nor in the general election. His unexpected death on September 1 caused panic and confusion within the hierarchy of the state Democratic party because the state law required that a party's nominee be certified by September 3. Hours after Maybank's funeral, the state Democratic executive committee met in secret and chose state Senator Edgar A. Brown of Barnwell County as the party's nominee for the general election. Not only was Brown a part of the \\"Barnwell Ring\\", but he was also a member of the executive committee. The state Democratic Party's decision to choose a candidate without holding a special primary election drew widespread criticism across the state. On September 3, The Greenville News ran an editorial advocating that a primary election be called and several newspapers across the state followed suit. At least six county Democratic committees repudiated the action by the state committee and called for a primary election. Despite repeated calls for a primary, the state executive committee voted against holding a primary because they did not think that there was enough time before the general election to hold a primary election. Immediately after the executive committee voted against holding a primary election, former Governor Strom Thurmond and lumberman Marcus Stone announced their intention to run as Democratic write-in candidates. Thurmond and his supporters stated that the executive committee had several legal alternatives as opposed to the outright appointment of state Senator Brown. In addition, Thurmond promised that if he were elected he would resign in 1956 so that the voters could choose a candidate in the regular primary for the remaining four years of the term. =Campaigns of the candidates= Thurmond received support from Governor James F. Byrnes and from those who backed his Presidential bid as a Dixiecrat in the 1948 Presidential election. Thurmond framed the race as a \\"moral issue: democracy versus committee rule\\"Lander, Ernest: A History of South Carolina 1865-1960, page 183. University of South Carolina Press, 1970. and his write-in campaign was repeatedly assisted by every newspaper in the state, except for those in Anderson. For instance, The News and Courier devoted its front page on November 2 to show voters a sample ballot and it also provided detailed instructions on how to cast a write-in vote. Not only that, but the newspaper also printed an editorial on the front page giving precise reasons why voters should vote for Thurmond instead of Brown. On the other hand, Brown was supported by the Democratic party regulars and he also gained the endorsement of Senator Olin D. Johnston. Brown based his campaign entirely on the issue of party loyalty, stressing that Thurmond was a Republican ally because he had voted for President Eisenhower in 1952. Marcus A. Stone, a lumberman in Florence and Dillon, was a candidate in previous Democratic primaries for governor and senator. He did very little campaigning for the general election.

A defensive midfielder of stamina and tactical awareness, he played 546 matches in the Bundesliga (fourth in the all-time list at the time of his retirement), retiring at the age of 41. Most of his professional career was spent in with Werder Bremen, with which he won a total of five titles – he also played eight years with Borussia Dortmund. Votava represented West Germany at Euro 1980. Club career =Borussia Dortmund / Atlético= Born in Prague, Czechoslovakia, Votava started learning his football trade at local FK Dukla. However, his parents left the country during the Prague Spring, settling first in Australia then West Germany, in Witten. He began playing professionally with Borussia Dortmund in 1974, with the club in the second division. Scoring three goals in 22 games during his first Bundesliga season, Votava was an undisputed starter onwards, only missing three matches from 1977 to 1982 combined, although he failed to win any silverware. He subsequently moved to Atlético Madrid for 58 million pesetas, being an instrumental figure for the Colchoneros which always finished in the top four in La Liga during his three-year spell and also lifting the Copa del Rey in 1985. =Werder Bremen= Votava returned to West Germany aged 29, signing with SV Werder Bremen where he would play a further 11 campaigns and rarely missing a game. He helped the club to the 1991–92 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup and two league titles (to which he contributed with 65 matches and five goals combined). On 24 August 1996, aged 40 years and 121 days, he became the league's oldest goalscorer at the time, scoring in a 1–2 loss at VfB Stuttgart. The record lasted until 16 February 2019, when Claudio Pizarro (aged 40 years and 136 days) scored against Hertha BSC. As he was understandably slowing down, Votava left Bremen during the 1997 January transfer window, joining second-tier VfB Oldenburg and retiring at the season's end, with his team ranking last. During a 23-year professional career, he was never sent off. Votava then moved into coaching, starting with last club Oldenburg then moving to SV Meppen, both in the regional leagues. From late 2002 to early 2004, he took the reins of 1. FC Union Berlin in the second level, following which he returned to Werder as a youth coach (he had previously worked with the club as a scout). International career Votava chose to represent West Germany internationally, and made his debut on 21 November 1979, playing 15 minutes in a 3–1 friendly away win over the Soviet Union. He appeared in a further four internationals, including UEFA Euro 1980's group stage match against Greece (0–0) as the national side emerged victorious in the tournament.

It does not seem to be transmissible mechanically or by seed. Dry plant material remains infectious for up to seven days and for twelve weeks at −20 °C. The disease manifests itself by an initial translucence of the leaf veins and petioles which later become swollen and grow more slowly than the rest of the leaf causing it to crinkle. A bunch of small, curved new leaves form in the plant's crown creating a head somewhat resembling a lettuce. Growth in general slows down and the older leaves die.Wille, J.

He concluded that the book was well written but only the credulous or romantic reader will find it entertaining. Christoph von Fürer-Haimendorf stated that Tchernine's data on the yeti that she took from Russian sources are too contradictory and vague to be regarded as reliable evidence.

The BNYVV is a member of the genus BenyvirusTamada T (1999) Benyviruses. In: Webster R, Granoff A (eds) Encyclopedia of Virology, 2nd edt. Academic Press, New York, N.Y., pp 154–160 and is responsible for rhizomania, a disease of sugar beet (Rhizo: root; Mania: madness) that causes proliferation of thin rootlets, and leads to a smaller tap root with reduced sugar content. Infected plants are less able to take up water, and wilting can be observed during the warm period of the year. If the infection spreads to the whole plant, vein yellowing, necrosis and yellow spots appear on the leaves, giving the virus its name.  Hosts and symptoms  In this sliced open root, discoloration and the swelling of the crown due to rhizomania can be seen. The swelling of the crown is often referred to as \\"wine glass swelling\\" due to the shape resembling a wine glass. BNYVV Infects all of the following species: Beta vulgaris (beetroot), Beta vulgaris var. cicla, Beta vulgaris var. rubra, Beta vulgaris var. saccharifera (sugarbeet), Chamomilla recutita (common chamomile), Chenopodium (Goosefoot), Chenopodium quinoa (quinoa), Cichorium intybus (chicory), Cirsium arvense (creeping thistle), Convolvulus arvensis (bindweed), Datura stramonium (jimsonweed), Descurainia sophia (flixweed), Heliotropium europaeum (common heliotrope), Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco), Plantago major (broad-leaved plantain), Raphanus raphanistrum (wild radish), Spinacia oleracea (spinach), Tetragonia tetragonioides (New Zealand spinach), Tribulus terrestris (puncture vine), Veronica hederifolia and Xanthium strumarium (common cocklebur). The plants that suffer infections from BNYVV in the most abundance are all the subspecies of Beta Vulgaris, specifically Beta vulgaris var. saccharifera (sugar beet), and Spinacia oleracea (spinach). In Beta vulgaria var. saccharifera (sugar beet), symptoms are most often local in the roots and leaves, but can be found systemically on rare occasions. Symptoms are seen differently depending on when the infection occurs in the plant. In early life stages and early growing season, a diseases called rhizomania is caused as a result of the virus. Rhizomania is the growth of fine, hairy secondary roots which are dead and thus prevent the proper uptake of water. Because of rhizomania, the sugar beet is subject to severe infection where the entire plant is stunted, leaves are wilted, and death can occur. Due to the severity of an early onset infection, the most common symptom of BNYVV, yellow mosaic on the leaves, is rarely seen as the plant often dies before the virus can spread. For midseason and less severe infections, rhizomania results in the storage root rotting and constricting, causing the root to swell near the crown. In this case, rhizomania doesn't cause the plant to die which allows the virus is able to make its way to the leaves resulting in yellow-pale discoloration, proliferation, and upright growth. In late season infections, both roots and leaves appear asymptomatic. Spinacia oleracea (spinach) can also be infected by the same strand of BNYVV. For this plant, complete infection of the plant can occur in as little as four weeks causing yellow- green vein clearing on young leaves, stiff and/or crinkled leaves, necrosis, stunting, wilting, and possibly death. Unlike the sugar beet plant, systemic infection is almost always seen in spinach due to easy transmission through the plants roots.  Environment  BNYVV was first discovered in Japan during the 1950s and in Italy circa 1959. In the following two decades, the virus had spread to central, eastern, and southern Europe. Currently, the virus is found in 22 European countries, six Asian countries, and select states of the U.S.A. (Idaho, Nebraska, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, Wyoming). Because BNYVV is a virus, it can't move on its own thus making a vector or other modes of transportation a necessity for it to infect multiple hosts. The most common way for the virus to be dispersed is Polymyxa Betae, a plasmodiophoromycete fungal-like vector. The important aspect of P. Betae is that it doesn't infect the plant itself, rather it functions as a storage unit for the BNYVV virus. In P. Betate, the virus can lay dormant for over ten years making it easily dispersed in areas with much rain and farms with irrigation. Two other main ways that BNYVV is spread are infected plant roots and infected beet stecklings. Focusing on P. betae, conditions that favor this vector have high correlation with amount of disease seen in plants. In order for P. betae to release the virus, it requires a high soil moisture. This can be a result from excessive rainfall, excessive irrigation, and/or poor drainage systems which all promote severe cases of the disease. Along with soil moisture, soil quality also plays a role in disease severity. Poor soil structure is a major factor in causing severe cases of the BNYVV making crop rotation and tilling a necessity to minimize the chance of a severe outbreak. Temperature wise, P. Betae thrives in warmer soil temperatures (around 25 degrees Celsius) which makes the ideal planting time fall in spring or early summer at the latest.  Management  Because BNYVV can't be transmitted via seed or pollen, it uses Polymyxa betae to disperse via its resting spores called cystosori. The cystosori can be found in soil or in dried plant roots where they can remain dormant for more than 10 years making the elimination of this virus very difficult. The most important form of management for BNYVV is water management. Because P. betae thrives in moist conditions, heavy rain and irrigation creating high soil moisture cause the most severe cases of disease inoculation. This makes water management crucial at the beginning of the growing season to the point where cultivators are encouraged to restrain from any type of irrigation for up to six weeks after first germination of the plant. Irrigation can also create runoff which can transfer infectious P. Betae to other healthy fields that will result in destruction of that field as well which makes water runoff management just as important as irrigation management.Non-resistant beets (left) vs resistant beets (right) exposed to the BNYV virus Another form of dispersal is a result of human interactions. The resting spores of P. Betae located in the soil can be picked up by farm contaminated machinery/tools, human movement, and livestock movement making the identification of infected fields very important. This infected soil can also be found in manure which can infect fields by using it as a fertilizer. Currently, treating infected soil is not only very difficult, but also very expensive. Some chemical use and fumigation has been found to only be somewhat effective, but the cost of either grossly outweighs the potential benefit. This makes avoiding cross contamination crucial for disease management. Infected fields should be isolated as much as possible due to the spread of the pathogen being possible via only small amounts of soil. Due to P. Betae being very difficult to kill, if avoiding contaminated soil is not possible than the use of disposable or rubber footwear is advised in order to ensure proper cleaning. Cleaning of footwear and machinery should be done at the infected site due to the little amount of pathogen it takes to start a widespread infection. Due to the difficulty of managing P. Betae, the most promising form of management is the pursuit of resistant crops. There has been a focus on two genes in particular, Rz1 from B. vulgaris spp. vulgaris and Rz2 from B. vulgaris spp. maritima.

Gameplay  3D Rollercoaster Rush is a strategy game in which players have to navigate a rollercoaster train on various rollercoaster tracks. Players must try to get to the end of the track without crashing the entire train. With each completed track, players earn a certain number of points. The number of points received depends on how well the track was completed, such as how fast the track was completed and how many and how high jumps were. Players can also earn points by getting special rewards that can be earned by doing things such as speeding up the train, or not braking. To advance to the next track, a player must earn a certain number of stars. Players can earn them by getting a certain number of points on a track. The faster the player goes, the happier passengers are after jumps, but if the cart does not land correctly, people will fly off the track. There are three different locations in the game (Australia, France, and The United States), and each location has its own set or tracks. With each location unlocked, the tracks start to get more difficult and feature new obstacles (such as loops and jumps).

The city churches of Sir Christopher Wren, Hambledon Press, 1996 on land now covered by post-War development. Recorded since the 12th century, the church was destroyed in the Great Fire of London of 1666, then rebuilt by the office of Sir Christopher Wren. The rebuilt church suffered damage to its roof from a fire in an adjacent warehouse in 1886.\\"The London Encyclopaedia\\" Hibbert,C;Weinreb,D;Keay,J: London, Pan Macmillan, 1983 (rev 1993,2008) It was not repaired and finally demolished in 1893. History St. Mary Magdalen Old Fish Street was the only one of the 8 churches in the post-Fire City of London, called “St. Mary” dedicated to the penitent Mary Magdalene, rather than the Virgin Mary. Old Fish Street formerly ran from the Thames towards St. Paul’s Cathedral and was the location of a fish market since medieval times. The street was incorporated into Knightrider Street in 1872. The earliest surviving reference to the church is in a document of 1181, as “St Mary Magdalen”. Other medieval records refer to the church as “St. Marie Magdal in Piscaria apud sanctum Paulum”, \\"St. Marie Magdal parish at the Fishmarket”, \\"St. Marie Magdalen Eldefisshestrete\\" and “St. Mary Magdalen at Lamberdyshel”. Among the memorials in the pre-Fire church was a brass plaque of 1586, commemorating the merchant and benefactor, Thomas Berrie. The plaque survived the Great Fire and may now be seen in St Martin, Ludgate. In part it reads: :How smale soever the gift shall be/Thanke God for him who gave it thee/xii penie loves to xii poore foulkes/ :Geve everie saboth day for aye St Martin, Ludgate also has the bread shelves from St. Mary Magdalen Old Fish Street. On Easter Day, 1653, John Evelyn recorded in his Diary that he and his family received Holy Communion at St. Mary Magdalen’s. This was during the Protectorate when Anglican services were banned. The church was destroyed in the Great Fire in 1666 and the parish combined with that of St Gregory by St Paul's, which was not rebuilt. Building of the new church began in 1683, with new foundations for the north wall and tower, but incorporating some of the old walls elsewhere. The work was completed in 1687 at a total cost of £4315. Between 1824 and 1842, the rector of St. Mary Magdalen’s was the Reverend Richard Harris Barham, author of The Ingoldsby Legends. He was buried in the church in 1845. On the morning of Thursday, 2 December 1886, a fire broke out in a warehouse in what by this time was called Knightrider Street and spread to the church’s roof, causing substantial damage.Huelin, Gordon. Vanished churches of the City of London, Guildhall Library Publications, 1996 Although the church was insured and repairable, the event took place during a period in which several undamaged churches in the City of London were being demolished under the Union of Benefices Act 1860. The opportunity was taken to pull down St. Mary Magdalen’s and combine the parish with that of St Martin, Ludgate, which received some of the furnishings from the demolished church. The site previously occupied by St. Mary Magdalen’s was built over after the Second World War, and is now covered by Old Change Square. The parish still retains a clerkship which is now in the gift of St. Andrew-by-the-Wardrobe and is currently held by Oliver Hylton, a past chairman of the Castle Baynard Ward Club The church is the subject of a poem by John Betjeman, where the narrator is the Rector's warden. He refers to Wren's design as \\"a box with a fanciful plaster ceiling\\". Architecture The plan for St. Mary Magdalen’s was roughly rectangular, with the north wall tapering slightly towards the east. The two street frontages – to the east on Old Fish Street and to the south on Old Change – were faced with Portland stone. Underneath, the material was stone rubble. There were four large roundheaded windows on the south, and three similar windows on the east, each window flanked by pilasters capped by volutes. Entry to the church was through a door under the western window on the south front. The roof was balustraded. The tower was erected next to the north western wall of the church and stood 86 ft. high. This had a stone spire, consisting of an octagonal pyramid of five steps on which sat an open octagonal lantern from which emerged a concave steeple. The finial was in the form an urn, in allusion to St. Mary Magdalen’s pot of balm. The inspiration for the spire’s design was the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus .

Munras was a dealer in cattle hides and tallow, the products of his Rancho San Vicente. He built Casa Munras, the first home to be constructed outside the walls of the El Presidio Reál de San Carlos de Monterey, where he established a thriving trading house attached to the family home. Munras imported fine household furnishings and necessities to the earliest settlers in Monterey, California's first capital. His wife, Catalina Manzanelli de Munras, was grantee of Rancho Laguna Seca and Rancho San Francisquito. At the request of mission priest Father Juan Cabot, also a native of Barcelona, Munras traveled to Mission San Miguel Arcángel, north of Paso Robles, in the early 1820s. Various religious-themed scenes (known as the \\"Munras murals\\") were painted by the local Salinan Indians under Munras' direction.Munras Murals His designs reflected the Neo-Classical tastes of the period, and the reredos (main altarpiece) reflects knowledge of an artist who had seen the fashionably decorated churches in Mexico of that era.

It is sailed by two people, with either a sliding seat ('plank') or a single trapeze, or where neither plank nor trapeze is fitted, by three people. The Hornet is a restricted class meaning that its external hull measurements, sailing weight, sail measurements, and mast dimensions and weights are controlled, but the hull's interior layout, centreboard and rudder have few restrictions. Permitted materials are restricted in order to control costs. Development The Hornet was originally designed by Holt for inexpensive homebuilding using marine plywood bent over a simple frame, along the lines of his popular 14 foot GP14 design. During the 1960s composite and GRP boats were supplied by various builders, such as Doe, Baker, Dingwall, etc. but, due to large flat panels of GRP being more flexible (or heavier) than marine ply, those were generally not always competitive with the best wooden boats from the likes of Rigden, Gibbens, Cory et al. During the 1970s and early 1980s the class was updated progressively by the adoption of the trapeze, larger sails, and the phased reduction of overall weight limits over several years. Performance was revolutionised in 1973 by the introduction of No.1782 \\"Revolution\\" by Malcolm Goodwin, which was significantly faster than conventional Hornets. The hull shape was hydrodynamically optimised taking advantage of permitted tolerances, being built over a much stiffer frame to control its shape and stiffen its structure. Among other improvements an effective gybing centreboard was developed. Two other boats, Super Zonka and Short Circuit, were built at the same time, with gybing boards. Goodwin subsequently productionised his design and manufactured it in various forms: self assembly kits, part finished hulls, or finished boats. Tim Baker subsequently built composite boats from a Goodwin mould. Richard Lovett developed an interpretation of the new hull shape, and built two boats still known for their speed. Tim Coombe went on to build several more boats from the same frames. In 2000, a new deck mould was developed, and Speed Sails, and later Bob Hoare, built around 10 new boats in FRP. In 2008, a new skiff-style deck mould was developed, and 5 boats built with this new space frame layout. The current generation of Hornets are being built by SP Boats The latest sail number is 2190, but the longevity of the class is illustrated by the fact that 20-year-old boats are still winning the championships The Hornet celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2012 The Hornet was adopted by Poland as the trainer for the Olympic Flying Dutchman dinghy class. The main Hornet fleets are in the south of England and in Poland. *LOA : 4.87 m *Beam : 1.64 m *Sail Area : 9.75 m² *Dry Hull weight (min) : 61 kg *All up weight (min) : 126 kg *Portsmouth number : 973 References External links *UK Hornet Class website Category:Dinghies Category:Boats designed by Jack Holt ","title":"Hornet (dinghy)"},{"id":"12267045","text":"Garlic routing is a variant of onion routing that encrypts multiple messages together to make it more difficult for attackers to perform traffic analysis and to increase the speed of data transfer.

He called each message a \\"bulb\\", whereas I2P calls them \\"garlic cloves\\". All messages, each with its own delivery instructions, are exposed at the endpoint. This allows the efficient bundling of an onion routing \\"reply block\\" with the original message.

In 1945, she was transferred to the Soviet Union and served after that in the Soviet Navy as T-285 and as BRN-37. Construction and commissioning originally classified as a \\"coastal minesweeper,\\" AMc-129, Bond was reclassified as a \\"minesweeper,\\" AM-152, on 21 February 1942. She was laid down on 11 April 1942 at Portland, Oregon, by the Willamette Iron and Steel Works, launched on 21 October 1942, and commissioned on 30 August 1943 with Lieutenant Cober L. Grabenhorst, USNR, in command. Service history =U.S. Navy, World War II, 1943-1945= Following shakedown training, Bond engaged in patrols out of San Pedro, California, from 2 October to 20 November 1943. On the latter day, she got underway for the Hawaiian Islands and arrived at Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii, on 30 November 1943. She remained there until 7 December 1943, when she shaped a course for the Territory of Alaska. She arrived at Adak in the Aleutian Islands on 13 December 1943 and began patrols and escort duty. Over the next six months, her assignment took her to Attu, Kiska, Dutch Harbor, and Amchitka as well as Adak. Bond departed Dutch Harbor for San Francisco, California, early in the summer of 1944. Following repairs at San Francisco, Bond put to sea on 8 August 1944, bound for the Mariana Islands. She made stops at Pearl Harbor and at Eniwetok Atoll in the Marshall Islands before arriving at Saipan in the Mariana Islands on 2 September 1944. For the next seven months, Bond patrolled in the vicinity of Saipan and escorted convoys between Saipan, Ulithi, Guam, and Eniwetok. She left Saipan on 25 April 1945 and, after steaming via Eniwetok and Pearl Harbor, arrived at Portland, Oregon, on 22 May 1945. Selected for transfer to the Soviet Navy in Project Hula - a secret program for the transfer of U.S. Navy ships to the Soviet Navy at Cold Bay, Alaska, in anticipation of the Soviet Union joining the war against Japan - Bond underwent pre-transfer repairs at Portland and at Seattle, Washington, before moving north to Cold Bay in the summer of 1945 to begin familiarization training for her new Soviet crew.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , p. 39. =Soviet Navy, 1945-1960= Following the completion of training for her Soviet crew, Bond was decommissioned on 17 August 1945 at Cold Bay and transferred to the Soviet Union under Lend-Lease immediately. Also commissioned into the Soviet Navy immediately, she was designated as a ' (\\"minesweeper\\") and renamed T-285 in Soviet service. She soon departed Cold Bay bound for Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in the Soviet Union, where she served in the Soviet Far East. In February 1946, the United States began negotiations for the return of ships loaned to the Soviet Union for use during World War II, and on 8 May 1947, United States Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal informed the United States Department of State that the United States Department of the Navy wanted 480 of the 585 combatant ships it had transferred to the Soviet Union for World War II use returned. Deteriorating relations between the two countries as the Cold War broke out led to protracted negotiations over the ships, and by the mid-1950s the U.S. Navy found it too expensive to bring home ships that had become worthless to it anyway. Many ex-American ships were merely administratively \\"returned\\" to the United States and instead sold for scrap in the Soviet Union, while the U.S. Navy did not seriously pursue the return of others because it viewed them as no longer worth the cost of recovery.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , pp. 37-38, 39. The Soviet Union never returned Bond to the United States, although the U.S. Navy reclassified her as a \\"fleet minesweeper\\" (MSF) and redesignated her MSF-152 on 7 February 1955. The Soviet Navy, meanwhile, reclassified the ship as an \\"auxiliary vessel\\" (BRN) on 11 July 1956 and renamed her BRN-37 the same day. Disposal The Soviet Navy decommissioned BRN-37 18 January 1960 and sold her for scrapping that year. Unaware of her fate, the U.S. Navy kept Bond on its Naval Vessel Register until finally striking her on 1 January 1983.

The Maya placed great importance on the tattooing process, believing that tattoos in the image of a god would imbue a person with some of that god's power. Because of the importance and difficulty of this art form it was only natural that there was a god responsible for it. Acat was said to bless the ink, needles, and work spaces, and steady the hands of the artists for better results. Acat was first mentioned by J. Eric S. Thompson, in his book \\"Tattooing and Scarification among the Maya.\\" (Carnegie Institution of Washington Division of Historical Research, June 18th, 1946.) Thompson also added that Acat is a Nahuatl day name meaning \\"reed\\", while the pronunciation \\"Ah Cat\\" would be \\"He of the Storage Jar.\\" Most likely because hollow reeds were thought to be used in the tattooing process. In addition, Thompson writes (in relation to the designation of the deity's name) \\"Acat is translated as 'inkstand' in the Pio Perez dictionary; as a doctor's instrument case or a scribe's pen case in the Motul dictionary.” Loosely, Acat as a deity is also associated with the development of the fetus in the womb.

The bridge is owned by Massachusetts Highway Department and is located on Massachusetts Route 147. It spans and rises above the river. The 1818 bridge as it appeared around 1908 History and construction of the bridge The Connecticut River was first bridged at Springfield in 1805, by an open wooden bridge said to have been \\"mongrel in style.\\" It collapsed in 1814 and was replaced by a covered wooden Burr arch- truss bridge built by Isaac Damon of Northampton, Massachusetts. Partly rebuilt after a spring freshet in 1818, Damon's bridge survived into the 20th century, and was the structure which the present concrete arch bridge was built to replace. The 1814 bridge can be located by the position of \\"Bridge Street\\" in both Springfield and West Springfield, at approximately . In 1915, the Hampden County Commissioners opened hearings to discuss construction of a new bridge, but it wasn't until the winter of 1918/19 that the location and overall design of the present concrete arch bridge were finally agreed upon. The main construction contract (at $3,254,883 (US$ with inflation)) was let to H.P. Converse on April 3, 1920; the completed bridge was opened to traffic on August 3, 1922. At the ceremonies held that day, the bridge was dedicated as a memorial to \\"those who had died as pioneers, and soldiers in the Revolutionary, Civil and Foreign Wars.\\" The bridge was designed by Fay Spofford & Thorndike, with Haven & Hoyt, architects. When the bridge was refurbished in 1992, Fay Spofford & Thorndike was again involved. Design The Memorial Bridge features a 7 span, reinforced-concrete deck rib arches, with a 9 span reinforced concrete slab viaduct. Each of the river spans is made up of 5 Melan-type, two-hinged, reinforced-concrete arch ribs of parabolic profile.Arch Bridges on Waymarking.com: Memorial Bridge - Springfield/West Springfield, MA - Arch Bridges on Waymarking.com, accessdate: March 4, 2017 The bridge's longest ribs have a center to center span of and a rise of ; the ribs of the other spans vary from in length, with rises from . The three interior ribs in each span are grouped together near the center of the roadway where a streetcar line was originally located. The two outer ribs are more widely spaced and carry thin concrete fascia walls concealing an open-spandrel design. Reinforced-concrete spandrel columns carry the reinforced-concrete roadway. The viaduct spans the rail yard consists of a reinforced concrete slab deck carried by transverse bents of concrete-encased structural steel. The piers are granite-faced reinforced-concrete. There were two gargoyles above the bridge on the south side that were removed when the bridge was upgraded several years ago. The four plaques on the central towers honor the original colonists, and veterans of the American Revolutionary War, American Civil War, and World War I.Swift, Esther M. West Springfield Massachusetts: A Town History. Copyright 1969, Town of West Springfield, Massachusetts. Library of Congress Catalog Number 77-96767. West Springfield Heritage Association; printed by F.A. Bassette Company, Springfield, Massachusetts. p. 99. The 1922 Memorial Bridge includes the longest single concrete arch span in Massachusetts. Its self-supporting steel rib arches represent an uncommon refinement of Melan's original idea – by making the steel arches self-supporting, and using them to support their own load plus the weight of the formwork and the wet concrete during construction, an initial compressive stress was developed in the steel prior to the setting of the concrete. This prestressing of the steel allowed a much higher proportion of its ultimate strength to be utilized, allowing, in turn, the use of smaller and lighter arch ribs and a less massive substructure.https://www.flickr.com/photos/80651083@N00/237010468/ 1996 rehabilitation project By the 1990s, the concrete above the arches was suffering from advanced Alkali-Silica Reactivity (ASR) attack. The 1996 rehabilitation project replaced the entire deck system. The decorative architectural elements were replaced either in kind using cast stone or replaced with architectural fiberglass reproductions. The viaduct over the railroad was replaced with adjacent precast/prestressed deck beams made continuous. This project was completed by Daniel O'Connell's Sons in 1996.

In 1945, she was transferred to the Soviet Navy, in which she served as T-334. Construction and commissioning Originally classified as a \\"coastal minesweeper,\\" AMc-126, Augury was reclassified as a \\"minesweeper,\\" AM-149, on 21 February 1942. She was laid down on 7 December 1942 at Tampa, Florida, by the Tampa Shipbuilding Company, Inc., launched on 23 February 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Helen K. MacLean, and commissioned on 17 March 1944 with Lieutenant A. G. Wood, USNR, in command. Service history =U.S. Navy, World War II, 1943-1945= After fitting out, Augury completed shakedown training out of Little Creek, Virginia, between 8 April and 8 May 1943. On 10 May 1943, she got underway as part of the escort for a convoy bound for the United States West Coast. She and her charges arrived in the Panama Canal Zone on 19 May 1943, transited the Panama Canal soon thereafter, and continued on up the western coast of North America. Augury entered port at San Francisco, California, on 2 June 1943 and remained there until 22 June 1943, when she resumed her journey, shaping a course for the Territory of Alaska. She arrived at Kodiak, Alaska, on 29 June 1943 and reported for duty with Task Force (TF) 91. For the remainder of her U.S. Navy career, she plied the waters surrounding Kodiak Island and the Aleutian Islands, escorting ships between such ports as Kodiak, Dutch Harbor, Adak, Amchitka, Attu, Shemya, and Chernofski and conducted minesweeping operations in the bays, inlets, and passes along the Aleutian archipelago. Selected for transfer to the Soviet Navy in Project Hula - a secret program for the transfer of U.S. Navy ships to the Soviet Navy at Cold Bay, Alaska, in anticipation of the Soviet Union joining the war against Japan - Augury began four weeks of familiarization training for her new Soviet crew at Cold Bay on 23 June 1945.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , p. 39. =Soviet Navy, 1945-1960= Following the completion of training for her Soviet crew, Admirable was decommissioned on 19 July 1945 at Cold Bay and transferred to the Soviet Union under Lend-Lease immediately. Also commissioned into the Soviet Navy immediately, she was designated as a ' (\\"minesweeper\\") and renamed T-334 in Soviet service. She soon departed Cold Bay bound for Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in the Soviet Union, where she served in the Soviet Far East. In February 1946, the United States began negotiations for the return of ships loaned to the Soviet Union for use during World War II, and on 8 May 1947, United States Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal informed the United States Department of State that the United States Department of the Navy wanted 480 of the 585 combatant ships it had transferred to the Soviet Union for World War II use returned. Deteriorating relations between the two countries as the Cold War broke out led to protracted negotiations over the ships, and by the mid-1950s the U.S. Navy found it too expensive to bring home ships that had become worthless to it anyway. Many ex-American ships were merely administratively \\"returned\\" to the United States and instead sold for scrap in the Soviet Union, while the U.S. Navy did not seriously pursue the return of others because it viewed them as no longer worth the cost of recovery.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , pp. 37-38, 39. The Soviet Union never returned Augury to the United States, although the U.S. Navy reclassified her as a \\"fleet minesweeper\\" (MSF) and redesignated her MSF-149 on 7 February 1955. Disposal T-334 was scrapped in the Soviet Union in 1960. Unaware of her fate, the U.S. Navy kept Augury on its Naval Vessel Register until finally striking her on 1 January 1983.

It was later interpreted as the particles ending in the particles disappearing beneath the 'event horizon' associated with a Black Hole singularity. In recent years, it was shown by Trevor Marshall that the particle trajectories end in a shell of infinite density at the 'event horizon' radius, supporting the shell collapsar as endpoint. Snyder’s argument that the “star thus tends to close itself off from any communication with a distant observer” which is quoted as an early inference of a Black Hole, does not follow from his model. Only the very surface of the infinite density shell could reflect or emit radiation and solutions without a density singularity are needed to investigate the issue. In 1955, Snyder bet against Maurice Goldhaber that antiprotons existed, and won. Some publications he authored together with Ernest Courant laid the foundations for the field of accelerator physics. In particular, Hartland with Courant and Milton Stanley Livingston developed the principle of strong focusing that made modern particle accelerators possible.

Cruikshank 1829 caricature by Robert Cruikshank of US President Andrew Jackson's inauguration Isaac Robert Cruikshank, sometimes known as Robert Cruikshank (27 September 1789 - 13 March 1856) was a caricaturist, illustrator, and portrait miniaturist, the less well-known brother of George Cruikshank, both sons of Isaac Cruikshank. Just like them he holds importance as a pioneer in the history of comics for creating several cartoons which make use of narrative sequence and speech balloons. Life He was born in 1789 in Middlesex , where he and his brother George attended school in Edgware. Both brothers were interested in the theatre, and performed in dramas they had written themselves with their friend Edmund Kean. Isaac joined the Loyal North Britons, a volunteer military unit, rising to the rank of sergeant when the volunteers turned out in 1803. During adolescence both brothers attended boxing and fencing matches, cock-fights, and numerous tavern contests.Robert L. Patten, ‘Cruikshank, (Isaac) Robert (1789–1856)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 Cruikshank gained a midshipman's commission in the East India Company's ship Perseverance. Midshipman Cruikshank did not get on with his captain, and returning on his maiden voyage he was deliberately left behind on St Helena. He arrived back in London in 1806 and shocked his family who were in mourning having been told that he was dead.George Cruikshank, with some account of his brother Robert Cruikshank’, MS memoir, Princeton University In the late 1820s Cruikshank illustrated a number of notable books that were often sequels to previous successes to which he and his brother George had contributed. For example, George Cruikshank illustrated Points of Humour and Isaac Cruikshank illustrated Points of Misery. The brothers collaborated on a series of 'London Characters' in 1827. Amongst his other illustrations are some notable ones for Miguel de Cervantes' classic novel, Don Quixote de la Mancha. They are not as well known as those of William Hogarth or Gustave Doré; however, they can be viewed online at the Quijote Banco de Images.

He gathered a \\"dream team\\" of actors and reestablished Lenkom as one of the leading Soviet theatres.Director Mark Zakharov, Dead at 85 at The Moscow Times, 30 September 2019 Life and career Mark Zakharov was born in Moscow into a family of teachers. His paternal grandfather belonged to Russian nobility and was killed in action during the World War I, while his paternal grandmother belonged to Crimean Karaites. His father Anatoly Zakharov served as a Red Army soldier during the Russian Civil War, then worked as a school teacher in physical culture before being arrested in 1934 for counter-revolutionary activity and sentenced to three years in prison; he took part in the Great Patriotic War and in 1949 was expelled from Moscow again for several years as \\"previously convicted\\".Legendary stage and film actor Mark Zakharov interview at Gordon's Boulevard, 10 July 2018 (in Russian) Zakharov's mother Galina Sergeevna Zakharova (née Bardina) was a trained actress who led children's acting classes. His maternal grandfather Sergei Nikolaevich Bardin was a White officer who fought under Alexander Kolchak before leaving for Australia; his wife Sophia Nikolaevna Bardina chose to stay in Russia and headed an orphanage.

Education  The son of Simon Cantrell (1658–1744), he was educated at Derby School (where a relation, the Rev. Thomas Cantrell, 1649–1698, was headmaster)B. Tacchella, ed., The Derby School register, 1570–1901 (1902), p. 8 and Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He matriculated at Cambridge in 1701, graduated BA in 1705 and MA in 1710.Cantrell, Henry, Church of England clergyman and religious controversialist by David L. Wykes in Dictionary of National Biography (OUP, 2004)  Career summary  Cantrell was ordained a priest at Lichfield in 1709. In 1712, the corporation of Derby gave him the vicarage of St Alkmund's, Derby, a living he kept for more than sixty stormy years, until his death at the age of eighty-nine. Cantrell had a quarrelsome nature, and even before his induction as Vicar of St Alkmund's parish he fell out with its vestry, insisting on exercising his right to appoint one of the two churchwardens for the parish.Vestry book, St Alkmund's parish, Derby, 1698–1783, Derbyshire Record Office, accession D916A/PV 1/1 Within months of his appointment, he was preaching against non-conformity, claiming that: He refused to bury children baptised by dissenters, which led to a furious controversy in Derby. In any event, Cantrell's bishop refused to support his stance. One of Cantrell's best-known works was a scholarly dissertation denying the claim by the Presbyterian minister Ferdinando Shaw that King Charles I had been baptised only by a Presbyterian and never by an Episcopal minister. Cantrell was often embattled in defending his clerical rights, including the right to plant trees in the churchyard, to control the contents of the parish register, and so forth, generally claiming the matter in hand was about an important principle and part of a wider defence of clerical rights. In 1729, he defeated the Corporation of Derby (the patrons of his living) in a legal battle over the parish's small tithes, which the corporation had taken away from him for insulting the Mayor of Derby.British Library, MS Stowe 119, folio 76v When his battles led to the forced sale of much of his library, he was offered the vicarage of Brecon through the influence of Dr Henry Sacheverell, but declined it. When Cantrell granted a licence for the secret marriage of Annabella Wilmot of Osmaston, Derbyshire, this led to the Ecclesiastical Courts Bill 1733. Doubt has been cast on the claim in William Hutton's History of Derby (1791) that at the time of the Jacobite rising of 1745 Cantrell was a Jacobite and drank the health of the Old Pretender.A History of Derby by William Hutton (1791)L.

They were originally known as \\"D-tanks\\" but later reclassified as class D1. Members of this very successful class survived in service until 1951. Background The D1 class were Stroudley's second tank engine class, intended for heavier tasks than could be undertaken by his A1 class \\"Terriers\\" which had been introduced in 1872. They had larger 5' 6\\" coupled wheels and a boiler pressure. Between November 1873 and March 1887, 125 locomotives of the class were built, 90 of which at Brighton railway works and the remainder by Neilson & Co.Ellis, (1949) p.85 After 1883, new locomotives were given boilers with pressure, and in 1892 following Stroudley's death, the boiler pressure for replacement boilers was raised to . Pre-grouping For twenty years the class were the mainstay of the LB&SCR; outer suburban services, until gradually replaced by R.J. Billinton's D3 class 0-4-4 tank engines in the mid-1890s. Thereafter they were used on a variety of secondary passenger, and occasionally freight services throughout the railway. The first locomotive was withdrawn in December 1903, but many of the locomotives were still in good condition and popular with the engine crews. Douglas Earle Marsh therefore sought to rebuild six examples in 1910 with a larger boiler and cylinders. In the event, only one locomotive, number 79A, was rebuilt. This locomotive was known as D1X class, but although it was more powerful than the originals, it was found to be unsteady at speed and so no further rebuilds were authorised. Of the other five new boilers, one was used to rebuild E1 class no. 89 in 1911, and the other four were put to stationary use at various places on the LBSCR system. Class D1 with modified tanks Post-grouping There were 84 D1 and D1X locomotives surviving in December 1922 at the grouping of the railways of southern England to form the Southern Railway. The class continued to find useful work on secondary services throughout the new railway, often in preference to far newer locomotives. During the Second World War six surviving examples were loaned to the London Midland and Scottish Railway and served in the north of Scotland. Nine examples were fitted with water pumps and firefighting equipment and were stationed at the major motive power depots in London to deal with incendiary bomb attacks. British Railways Seventeen members of the class survived the nationalisation of the Southern Railway to form British Railways in January 1948 but many of these had been in storage for several years. The last surviving example in B.R. service was withdrawn from Nine Elms in December 1951 and no examples have been preserved. Private ownership In 1947 the Whittingham Hospital Railway in Lancashire acquired number 2357 from the Southern Railway at a cost of £750. It was renamed James Fryers in honour of the Chairman of the Hospital Management Committee. Serious boiler defects in 1956 curtailed its working career and the engine was scrapped that year when it proved beyond economic repair. At that time, it was the sole surviving member of its class.Casserley, 1957: p. 313 Accidents and incidents *On 1 September 1897, an Eastbourne to Tunbridge Wells train crashed at Tooth's Bank, between and . The locomotive ('D1' Class tank No. 297 Bonchurch) and several carriages left the track and fell down an embankment, resulting in the death of the driver, James McKenly, and injuries to the fireman and 30 passengers. At the inquiry, Lt. Col. G. W. Addison reported that the main cause of the accident was excessive speed as the driver was attempting to make up lost time in order to make a connection at . The track itself was in poor shape with many rotten sleepers and \\"curves having irregular elevation\\" which contributed to the accident. Following the inquiry, much of the track was relaid and the train scheduling was altered. *In 1904, a freight train hauled by locomotive No. 239 Patcham was derailed at Cocking, West Sussex. *On 3 April 1916, a passenger train hauled by locomotive No. 273 Dornden was derailed between and stations, East Sussex. Locomotive summary Descendants The D1 class had a lasting influence on a number of locomotive classes designed by Stroudley himself, and his two assistants Robert Billinton and Dugald Drummond. Stroudley produced a tender locomotive version of the design for secondary passenger duties which was later classified D2, and then went on to build express passenger versions of the 'Richmond' and B1 classes. Likewise, Billinton extended the design to create his D3 passenger tanks. During the 1870s Drummond built six 0-4-2 tank locomotives that were almost identical for the North British Railway after 1875. He too extended the design to produce the first of his several successful 0-4-4T designs for the North British and Caledonian Railway. Drummond's successful LSWR M7 class is also a direct descendant of the D1 class.Ellis, (1949) pp.90-4. References Sources  Worsfold, B.G.

The narcissism of small differences () is the thesis that communities with adjoining territories and close relationships are especially likely to engage in feuds and mutual ridicule because of hypersensitivity to details of differentiation.Sigmund Freud, Civilization, Society and Religion (Penguin Freud Library 12) p. 131 and p. 305 The term was coined by Sigmund Freud in 1917, based on the earlier work of British anthropologist Ernest Crawley. In language differing only slightly from current psychoanalytic terminology, Crawley declared that each individual is separated from others by a taboo of personal isolation, a narcissism of minor differences.Sigmund Freud, On Sexuality (Penguin Freud Library 7, 1991) p. 272 Usage The term appeared in Freud's Civilization and Its Discontents (1929–30) in relation to the application of the inborn aggression in man to ethnic (and other) conflicts, a process still considered by Freud, at that point, as a convenient and relatively harmless satisfaction of the inclination to aggression.Freud, Civilization and Its Discontents, p. 305 For Lacanians, the concept clearly related to the sphere of the Imaginary: the narcissism of small differences, which situates envy as the decisive element in issues that involve narcissistic image.Roberto Harari, Lacan's Seminar on Anxiety: An Introduction(2001) p. 25 American psychiatrist Glen O. Gabbard has suggested that Freud's narcissism of small differences provides a framework to understand that in a loving relationship, there can be a need to find, and even exaggerate, differences in order to preserve a feeling of separateness and self.Gabbard, Glen O. M.D., On Hate in Love Relationships: The Narcissism of Minor Differences Revisited, Psychoanalytic Quarterly, 62:229–238 In terms of postmodernity, Clive Hazell argues that consumer culture has been seen as predicated on the narcissism of small differences to achieve a superficial sense of one's own uniqueness, an ersatz sense of otherness which is only a mask for an underlying uniformity and sameness.Clive Hazell, Alterity (2009) p. 97 The phenomenon has been portrayed by the British comedy group Monty Python in their satirical 1979 film Life of Brian and by author Joan Didion in an essay (part of her 1968 book Slouching Towards Bethlehem) about Michael Laski, the founder of the Communist Party USA (Marxist–Leninist). In 2010, author Christopher Hitchens cited the phenomenon when talking about ethno- national conflicts. \\"In numerous cases of apparently ethno-nationalist conflict, the deepest hatreds are manifested between people who—to most outward appearances—exhibit very few significant distinctions.\\" See also * Collective narcissism * Intragroup conflict * Law of triviality * Narcissism * Sectarianism References Further reading * An Interview With Freud Biographer Peter D.

This play marks the high point of Italian tragedy and pre-romantic poetry. The story is taken from the Bible, and is about Saul's last hours during the war against the Philistines. In the narration, Alfieri adhered to the unity of time (one day only), of space (Gelboé) and of action, which were strictly Aristotelian. The tragedy is dedicated to his friend Tommaso Valperga di Caluso, philosopher and teacher of oriental languages.  Plot  Saul, a brave warrior, was crowned king of Israel at the request of the people and consecrated by the priest Samuel, who anointed him in the name of God. Over time, however, Saul turned away from God and ended up doing various acts of impiety. Then Samuel, by order of God, consecrated a humble shepherd as king: David. He was called to the court of Saul to appease the king's soul with his song, and there he succeeded in obtaining the friendship of Jonathan, son of the king, and the hand of the young daughter of Saul, Micol. However, David generated a strong envy in the king, who saw in him a usurper and at the same time saw his past youth in it. David was persecuted by Saul and forced to take refuge in the lands of the Philistines (and for this accused of treason). The story of the Saul narrates the last hours of the king's life and sees the return of David, who as a brave warrior rushed to the aid of his people at war with the Philistines, despite knowing full well the risk that this could entail for his life. David is ready to be killed by the king, but first he wants to be able to fight with his people. Saul seeing him wants to kill him, but after listening to him he is convinced to give him command of the army. David at one point, however, makes a mistake, speaking of \\"two lambs\\" in Israel, and this generates Saul's murderous delirium towards the young man. Saul then explains to Jonathan the harsh law of the throne, according to which \\"brother kills brother\\". Before the king comes the priest Achimelech, who brings divine condemnation to Jonathan and informs him of the coronation of David. The king has the priest killed, and from there he will go more and more towards delirium. In the last act, Saul foresees in a nightmare his own death and that of his sons and with a vision full of blood he awakens, and grasps the reality of the facts: the Philistines are attacking them, and the Israelite army is unable to defend itself. At this point Saul finds himself again, and by killing himself he regains the integrity of a man and a king.

Flewwelling et al.,2003 Internationally, the basis of law for fisheries management comes from the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Further definition was in the Declaration of Cancun This is complemented by the work of a variety of regional organizations that cover high seas fishing areas. A key concept in international fishing laws is that of the Exclusive Economic Zone, which extends 200 miles (370 km) from the coast of nations bordering on the oceans. EEZ is not a meaningful concept in relatively small seas such as the Mediterranean and Baltic, so those areas tend to have regional agreements for MCS of international waters within those seas. Components and related activities MCS has aspects distinct from fisheries management, although there is overlap. According to the 2003 FAO paper on Recent Trends, fisheries management consists of: *Data collection and analysis * Participatory management planning * Establishing a regulatory framework  Input controls  Operational and output controls * Implementation While MCS, in the basic FAO definitions, does not include enforcement, that category will be included here as part of the means of implementing MCS operations. In MCS discussions, there is a strong emphasis that the success of MCS is not to be measured in number of arrests, but in the level of compliance with presumably reasonable frameworks (i.e., the \\"control\\" part of MCS). If a sense of participation in the development of controls, as well as peer pressure, leads to meeting the fisheries management controls without a single arrest, the MCS program is successful. =Monitoring= A 1981 Conference of Experts Expert Consultation on Monitoring, Control and Surveillance Systems for Fisheries Management defined monitoring as \\" the continuous requirement for the measurement of fishing effort characteristics and resource yields.\\" This was expanded, in a 1993 workshop,\\"Community-based fishery management: towards the restoration of traditional practices in the South Pacific\\", Marine Policy 17(2): 108-117 1993 to include the measurement of: * catch * species composition * fishing effort * bycatch (i.e., species other than the targeted one incidentally captured by the primary effort) * area of operations =Control= According to the 1981 Conference of Experts, control are the, \\"regulatory conditions under which the exploitation of the resource may be conducted.\\" This is usually considered to consist of legislation, regulations, and international agreements. Each of these should describe the management measures required and the requirements that will be enforced. The actual enforcement mechanisms are not part of control. Management criteria include: * Establishing designated fishing areas in which no fishing, fishing by vessels with permits, or open fishing is allowed. * Restrictions on fishing gear, including the banning of certain types on vessels in give areas, or controls on such parameters as the mesh size of fishing nets. These restrictions can be enforced only by physical inspection at sea or at dockside. * Catch and quota controls, by species or total take  Days at sea  Daily time at sea  Seasonal catch limits  Per-trip catch limits  Limits on catch within certain areas  Individual (vessel) transferable quotas  Minimum or maximum fish sizes  Bycatch * Vessel movement controls  Into areas  Exiting areas  Sightings in areas * Onboard observers * Licensing Vessel inspections =Surveillance= Surveillance, according to the 1981 Conference of Experts, are \\"the degree and types of observations required to maintain compliance with the regulatory controls imposed on fishing activities.\\" The Ghana workshop termed it the \\"regulation and supervision of fishing activity...\\" This definition does not clearly include enforcement. Through surveillance, overfishing by authorized fishers and poaching by unauthorized fishers can be detected. Many systems are involved in the technical process of surveillance. Radar, including coastal, airborne, and spaceborne systems, may be intended for national security or law enforcement, but can simultaneously provide information to fisheries management and environmental protection authorities. Vessel monitoring system principally intended for fisheries surveillance can provide critical information to search and rescue (SAR) under the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) and its associated Global Maritime Distress Safety System (GMDSS). =Enforcement= Enforcement ranges from self- regulation to onboard observers to patrol platforms (vessels and aircraft) to law enforcement activity. Spatial Components MCS implementation has sea, land, and aerospace aspects. Monitoring systems, such as Vessel monitoring system, may operate in all three of these regimes. These aspects also affect other maritime systems that can cooperate with VMS, such as Automatic Identification Systems (AIS) with their specialized Vessel Traffic Services (VTS), radar surveillance of the seas, and pollution tracking mechanisms. =Sea components= Perhaps the most basic component, aboard fishing vessels, are the logs and catch reporting completed by the fishers themselves. Closely associated are reports prepared by onboard observers. Also on the fishing vessel can be the shipboard components of vessel monitoring system (VMS). These can be independent systems involving navigational and time input, embedded and dedicated computer, and radio transmission of reports. The transmission is usually via satellite, but some countries are using coastal VHF repeater systems. VMS components can also integrate with other shipboard electronics. For example, if the report generation component is on a general- purpose personal computer, that computer may also run a chartplotter and various catch planning applications. The chart plotter function may be a general-purpose graphic display, presenting radar or bottom sounder/fish finder data, perhaps merged with electronic charts. =Surface components= Catch inspectors, as well as electronic or hard copy filings of catch and other reports, are basic land components of MCS. Fisheries management authorities who make real-time decisions about opening or closing restricted fishing areas are usually on land, and will communicate their decisions on paper, using websites or electronic mail, and by voice radio. Within a vessel monitoring system (VMS), the Fisheries Management Center (FMC) components are on land. Minimally, this is a regional or national center of the nation in whose waters the fishing is happening. Under the Flag Principle, the VMS of a vessel registered in a nation other than the coastal or EEZ nation of the fishing area will transmit to its national FMC, which will then relay the information to the FMC where the vessel is operating. Patrol vessels may do visual or electronic surveillance of fishing vessels at sea, or may board them for spot inspections. Fisheries management vessels also may independently monitor fish densities in the areas of interest, water conditions, or other observations of interest for operations or research. =Aerospace components= Low-flying aircraft can visually identify fishing vessels, and, with reasonable navigational skills, determine whether a given craft is in an authorized area. This is aided if the fishing craft display distinctive identifiers. Higher-flying aircraft using radar and other sensors can determine which vessels are in a designated open or closed fishing area, and the ashore FMC can correlate these observations with VMS data. Communications satellites, in both low earth orbit and geosynchronous orbit are the backbone of VMS communications with FMCs. Radar satellites can locate vessels in a far larger area than can aircraft, but have little or no ability to characterize the vessel.

Early life  Born in London, Ramsbotham was the younger son of Herwald Ramsbotham, later the 1st Viscount Soulbury. He was educated at Eton College and at Magdalen College, Oxford. At Oxford he contracted polio in 1938, which left him with a slightly shorter right leg.  World War II  He was already working for MI5 as a civilian when he joined the army on the outbreak of the Second World War. In April 1941, Ramsbotham was working in B3 Division of MI5 (Communications) with the task of studying the activities of foreign journalists in the UK. In July he was with B3A (Censorship) before moving to E3 (Alien Control – USA citizens in the UK and other territories). By 1943 he was with E2 Division dealing with nationals from the Baltic states, the Balkans and Central Europe. In June 1943, he left MI5 and was later commissioned into the Intelligence Corps on 9 June 1944. As a fluent speaker in French, he continued to work with MI5 on the Continent as a member of 106 Special Counter Intelligence Unit (SCIU), running double agents and acting as a liaison officer to the counter-espionage section of the French Intelligence Service. He also reported to the '212' Committee', the Allied equivalent of MI5's 'XX Committee' ('Double Cross Committee'). At the close of hostilities, he was employed in the Political Division of the Control Commissions for both Germany and Austria and served also in Hamburg and Berlin. In recognition of his exemplary service during the war, he received a Mention in Despatches in August 1945 and was awarded a Croix de Guerre on 1 March 1949 (en bloc).  Diplomatic Service  In 1948, Ramsbotham joined the diplomatic service on the advice of his superior, Sir Christopher Steel. He failed the Foreign Office exam on his first attempt, due to poor mathematical skill, but passed six months later after some coaching. His first position was in the German Department of the Foreign Office in London. His posts included High Commissioner to Cyprus (1969–1971) Ambassador to Iran (1971–1974) and Ambassador to the United States (1974–1977). He had a close relationship with Jimmy Carter, and was the first ambassador Carter invited to the White House. Ramsbotham was removed from his position as Ambassador to the United States by incoming Foreign Secretary David Owen. Owen controversially replaced him with Peter Jay, who was economics editor of The Times, the son- in-law of Prime Minister James Callaghan and Owen's personal friend.  Governor  Ramsbotham's final posting was as Governor of Bermuda (1977–1980). During his governorship, the two assassins of Sir Richard Sharples, the former governor, were hanged. The executions were followed by extensive rioting, as a result of which troops had to be sent to Bermuda to restore order.  Honours and title  He was appointed Companion (CMG) of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1964, promoted to Knight Commander (KCMG) in 1972, becoming Sir Peter Ramsbotham, and promoted again to Knight Grand Cross (GCMG) in 1978. In 1976, he was appointed Knight Grand Cross (GCVO) of the Royal Victorian Order as well as Knight (KStJ) of the Venerable Order of St John of Jerusalem. He inherited the title of Viscount Soulbury from his elder brother in 2004 but continued to be known as Sir Peter Ramsbotham.  Family  His first marriage was to Frances Marie Massie Blomfield. They were married on 30 August 1941 and their marriage ended with her death in 1982. His second marriage was to Dr Zaida Mary Hall, née Megrah, in 1985 (died 17 March 2013).

He was a noted academic as the Slade Professor of Fine Art at Cambridge University from 1978 to 1979, in addition to appointments at All Souls College, Oxford, and Emmanuel College, Cambridge. Bruce-Mitford worked for the British Museum in the Department of British and Mediaeval Antiquities from 1938 and, following the bequest of the Sutton Hoo Treasure to the nation, was charged with leading the project to study and publish the finds. This he did through four decades at the museum. He also became president of the Society of Antiquaries of London. Apart from military service in World War II he worked at the British Museum continuously until 1977, including two keeperships, and finally as a research keeper. Bruce-Mitford also held the titles secretary, and later vice- president, of the Society of Antiquaries, and president of the Society for Medieval Archaeology. He was responsible for translating Danish archaeologist P. V. Glob's book The Bog People (1965) into English. Early life Rupert Leo Scott Bruce-Mitford was born on 14 June 1914 at 1 Deerhurst Road, Streatham, London. Following Terence, Vidal and Alaric (Alex), he was the fourth of four sons born to Eustace and Beatrice Jean Bruce-Mitford. His mother was a daughter of John Fall Allison. Family tradition has it that Rupert's brothers were responsible for his given names, selecting them from their reading: Rupert from Anthony Hope's Rupert of Hentzau, Leo from Rider Haggard's She, and Scott from Robert Falcon Scott's diary, or his \\"Message to England\\". The family's surname was little older. Eustace, born Charles Eustace Beer in 1875, had adopted the name around 1902; perhaps indicative of his desire to separate himself from his family's missionary past, the change occurred shortly before he left a teaching post at a school in China headed by his brother, and set out by himself for Japan. \\"Mitford\\" was a take on \\"Midford\\", his mother's maiden name, and perhaps not unintentionally, that of the unrelated Algernon Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron Redesdale, whose name carried respect in the British expatriate community in Japan. \\"Bruce\\" may have been taken from Major Clarence Dalrymple Bruce, an acquaintance who commanded the Weihaiwei Regiment. Eustace Bruce-Mitford was a journalist, geographer, and vulcanologist. Rupert was born three years after his family returned from Japan, and three years before his father left for India. When Eustace died in 1919, Rupert was five years old. Orphaned and poor, Rupert Bruce-Mitford was educated with the financial support of his mother's cousin. She did so \\"on one condition – that [his] father's novel, depicting life in Yokohama at the turn of the century, should be burnt; she thought it immoral and scurrilous.\\" Bruce-Mitford was thereby sent to Brightlands preparatory school in Dulwich, London, in 1920, and then to the charity school Christ's Hospital in 1925. At Christ's Hospital he was introduced to archaeology, in 1930 participating in a dig with S. E. Winbolt at the Jacobean ironworks in Dedisham, Sussex. By 1933 he had switched studies from classics to history, and was awarded a Baring Scholarship to attend Hertford College, Oxford. At the British Museum Bruce-Mitford worked at the British Museum for 32 years, from 1938 to 1977, with a wartime break from 1940 to 1946 in the Royal Corps of Signals. He was an assistant keeper for 11 years; keeper of the Department of British and Medieval Antiquities for 15 years, and of the Department of Medieval and Later Antiquities for six; and for two years, from 1975 to 1977, a research keeper. In December 1937 Bruce-Mitford was named assistant keeper (second class) of the then Department of British and Medieval Antiquities at the British Museum. He was possibly helped in this position by his professor from two years previously, Robin Flower, also the deputy keeper of Manuscripts. That year Bruce-Mitford was reacquainted with archaeological work, spending three weeks with Gerhard Bersu at the Iron Age site Little Woodbury. In 1939 he was tasked with leading an excavation, this time at the medieval village of Seacourt. Though Seacourt was a difficult site, Bruce-Mitford was able to acquire complete ground plans of domestic buildings and of the church. It was also \\"a village deserted, in ruins, and archaeologically sealed within a century of the Black Death\\"; this precise dating—the village was deserted by 1439—\\"promised to provide important evidence for specialists in connexion with the chronology of mediaeval pottery and small objects\\" such as \\"brooches, ornaments, buckles, fittings of various kinds, shears, horseshoes, [and] nails\\" the dating of which was \\"notoriously vague\\". Excavations wrapped up 15 July 1939, seven weeks before Britain's entry into World War II. 1940 to 1946 saw Bruce-Mitford serving in the Royal Signals, \\"reaching the standard Army morse speed of twelve words a minute and after his day-time job fire-watching in the dome of St. Paul's.\\" He was commissioned as an officer on 1 February 1941. Bruce-Mitford spent the war awaiting his \\"eventual\\" return to the Department of British and Medieval Antiquities. As early as 1940, he was informed by T. D. Kendrick that he would \\"be responsible for the Museum's collection of Anglo-Saxon antiquities and also for the Germanic collections of Europe and the Late Celtic collections of the British Isles.\\" The letter closed with a warning: \\"You will also be responsible for Sutton Hoo. Brace yourself for this task.\\" His 21 years as keeper saw outstanding acquisitions by the Museum, including the Lycurgus Cup and the Ilbert collection of clocks and watches; however, the Bury St Edmunds Cross was missed. =Sutton Hoo= The Sutton Hoo helmet is one of the most iconic finds from the Sutton Hoo ship-burial. Excavated in 1939, the Anglo-Saxon Sutton Hoo ship-burial was to become \\"the defining moment of Rupert's life, his greatest challenge, the source of almost insuperable difficulties, and his greatest achievement.\\" By 1954 he was already recognised as the \\"spiritus rector of present day Sutton Hoo research\\", a title that would only become more deserved with time. Soon after returning to the British Museum Bruce-Mitford began publishing the Sutton Hoo finds, which had waited out the war in the London Underground before being returned to the museum in 1944 and 1945. In 1944 Herbert Maryon, a Technical Attaché recruited for the task, set to work restoring them, and when Bruce-Mitford returned two years later, he quickly began work. As he later wrote, \\"[t]here followed great days for Sutton Hoo when new, often dramatic, discoveries were being made in the workshops all the time. Built from fragments, astonishing artefacts – helmet, shield, drinking horns, and so on – were recreated.\\" The first edition of The Sutton Hoo Ship-Burial: A Provisional Guide was published in January 1947, the same year that Bruce- Mitford was elected a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London. The work quickly \\"turned out to be one of the Museum’s most successful publications ever\\"; by the time the second edition, The Sutton Hoo Ship-Burial: A Handbook, was published in 1968, the first had gone through ten impressions. Dozens of articles, chapters, and books on Sutton Hoo would follow. In 1947 he visited Sweden for six weeks at the invitation of the archaeologist Sune Lindqvist, in what Bruce-Mitford would later describe as \\"one of the most rewarding experiences of my life.\\" There he studied the similar finds from Vendel and Valsgärde, learning Swedish along the way. In 1960 Bruce-Mitford was put in charge of a definitive Sutton Hoo publication, but before it was completed, from 1965 to 1970 he led another round of excavations at Sutton Hoo to acquire \\"more information about the mound, the ship and the circumstances of the burial\\". The first volume of The Sutton Hoo Ship-Burial was finally published in 1975, and hailed as \\"one of the great books of the century\\" by A. J. Taylor, then president of the Society of Antiquaries. The second volume followed in 1978, and the third volume—published in two parts—came in 1983. Personal life Bruce-Mitford was married three times, and had three children by his first wife. In 1941 he married Kathleen Dent, with whom he fathered Myrtle (b. 1943), Michael (b. 1946), and Miranda (b. 1951). A professional cellist, Myrtle Bruce-Mitford would herself contribute to the Sutton Hoo finds, being employed by the British Museum to work on the remnants of the lyre and co-authoring a paper with her father. She was also the longtime partner of Nigel Williams, who from 1970 to 71 reconstructed the Sutton Hoo helmet. Bruce-Mitford's relationship with Dent was \\"long in trouble\\", and he left home in the later 1950s and formed a series of relationships. He married his former research assistant Marilyn Roberta Luscombe on 11 July 1975; the marriage was dissolved in 1984, at which point Bruce-Mitford found it necessary to sell his library, which went to Okinawa Christian Junior College in Japan. In 1986 he married for a third time, to Margaret Edna Adams, a child psychiatrist and published poet, whom he had met at Oxford fifty years before. After years of inherited heart disease, Rupert Bruce-Mitford died of a heart attack on 10 March 1994. He was buried eight days later in the burial ground by St Mary's Church in Bampton, Oxfordshire.

In 1945, she was transferred to the Soviet Navy, in which she served as T-333. Construction and commissioning Originally classified as a \\"coastal minesweeper,\\" AMc-125, Astute reclassified as a minesweeper, AM-148, on 21 February 1942. She was laid down on 7 December 1942 at Tampa, Florida, by the Tampa Shipbuilding Company, launched on 23 February 1943, sponsored by Mrs. M. L. Haney, and commissioned on 17 January 1944. Service history =U.S. Navy, World War I, 1944= Following shakedown training, Astute transited the Panama Canal and joined the United States Pacific Fleet. She proceeded up the Pacific coast of North America and ultimately arrived in the Territory of Alaska, where she served during the latter part of 1944 and the first half of 1945 conducting patrol and escort duty. Selected for transfer to the Soviet Navy in Project Hula - a secret program for the transfer of U.S. Navy ships to the Soviet Navy at Cold Bay, Alaska, in anticipation of the Soviet Union joining the war against Japan - Astute proceeded Cold Bay in the summer of 1945 and began training her new Soviet crew.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet- American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , p. 39. =Soviet Navy, 1945-1960= Following the completion of training for her Soviet crew, Astute was decommissioned on 19 July 1945 at Cold Bay and transferred to the Soviet Union under Lend-Lease immediately. Also commissioned into the Soviet Navy immediately, she was designated as a ' (\\"minesweeper\\") and renamed T-333 in Soviet service. She soon departed Cold Bay bound for Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky in the Soviet Union, where she served in the Soviet Far East. In February 1946, the United States began negotiations for the return of ships loaned to the Soviet Union for use during World War II, and on 8 May 1947, United States Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal informed the United States Department of State that the United States Department of the Navy wanted 480 of the 585 combatant ships it had transferred to the Soviet Union for World War II use returned. Deteriorating relations between the two countries as the Cold War broke out led to protracted negotiations over the ships, and by the mid-1950s the U.S. Navy found it too expensive to bring home ships that had become worthless to it anyway. Many ex-American ships were merely administratively \\"returned\\" to the United States and instead sold for scrap in the Soviet Union, while the U.S. Navy did not seriously pursue the return of others because it viewed them as no longer worth the cost of recovery.Russell, Richard A., Project Hula: Secret Soviet-American Cooperation in the War Against Japan, Washington, D.C.: Naval Historical Center, 1997, , pp. 37-38, 39. The Soviet Union never returned Astute to the United States, although the U.S. Navy reclassified her as a \\"fleet minesweeper\\" (MSF) and redesignated her MSF-148 on 7 February 1955. Disposal T-333 was scrapped in the Soviet Union in 1960. Unaware of this, the U.S. Navy retained Astute on its Naval Vessel Register until finally striking her name on 1 January 1983.

Biography = Early life and education= Phan Khôi was born to an elite family. His father was \\"Phó Bảng\\" Phan Trân (1826–1935) who was the son of Judge Phan Nhu. His mother was Hoàng Thị Lệ (1826–1882) who was the daughter of Governor Hoàng Diệu. Phan Khôi learned Chinese characters from a young age and was very well read. He read many progressive writings and developed a belief in civil rights and a new society. In 1906, he joined the Progressive Movement (Duy Tân) led by Phan Chu Trinh (1872–1926), Huỳnh Thúc Kháng (1876–1947) and Trần Quý Cáp (1870–1906). Phan Khôi moved to Hanoi to learn French and Quốc ngữ (Vietnamese written in the Latin alphabets). In 1907, he joined the \\"Đông Kinh Nghĩa Thục\\" school, founded by Phan Chu Trinh with the help of Phan Bội Châu in teaching materials. Then in 1908 the French cracked down on Progressive Movement, they captured all members, executed the leaders and imprisoned others. Phan Khôi was sent back to prison in Điện Bàn. In 1909, being pardoned by the French, he went to Huê and studied at the Pellerin School (1909–11). =Opening school and teaching= 1911 his father Phan Tran died. Phan Khôi came home for the funeral and stayed at his village, opened his own school and started teaching. 1913, Phan Khôi married the daughter of Lương Thúc Ký (1873–1947). Lương Thúc Ký was a teacher at Dục Anh school at Phan Thiêt. Dục Anh school was founded by Mr. Nguyễn Trọng Lợi, who also was a member of the Progressive Movement. =Journalism= Phan Khôi wrote under the pen name Chương Dân, and was very well known for his new, revolutionary and controversial ideas.Postcolonial Vietnam: New Histories of the National Past - Page 79 Patricia M.

He also contributed to the Giai Phẩm periodical and Văn, a weekly publication. Some leading Vietnamese intellectuals in the north of the country, like Nguyễn Hữu Đang and Trần Đức Thảo (1917–1993), joined Phan Khoi to express their ideals in the Nhân Văn - Giai Phẩm Movement, demanding freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and democracy. They accused the Vietnamese Communist Party of violating the Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. In December 1956, the Vietnamese Communist Party forced the papers to close. By 1958,after indecision about what to do about the participants in this dissent, it had arrested numerous participants in the Nhan Van Giai Pham affair, imprisoned some of them, forced some into public self-criticism, and put others on trial. This was reported to the world in the translated book The Nhân Văn Affair by Hoàng Văn Chí. Since this event till the last day of his life, Phan Khôi was kept prisoner at home by the Communist Party, his ideas and writings were suppressed. Phan Khôi died suddenly January 16, 1959 at home in Hanoi.

Phan Khôi had made the transition very swiftly not only by himself, but he also took his generation along with him. Being exposed to different cultures from China, Hong Kong, Japan, France, he was able to combine them all to serve his [Vietnamese people. Phan Khôi brought many new ideas to Vietnam, from a new democratic society with respect to human rights and civil rights, to equality for women, to a new trend of poetry. He provided the best spirit to a debate in Bàn thêm về “bút chiến”, which until today is still the foremost valuable lesson the Vietnamese ought to learn. The Nhân Văn Affair continued to be an inspiration for the Vietnamese intellectuals today. In his writing:Đàn bà với quốc sự, Phan Khôi clearly offered Vietnamese ladies an honor place in society within the setting of Vietnamese culture. His poem \\"Old Love\\" was the first poem written in a new format, opening doors for many young poets to surpass him in a short time. However, he also was very interested in researching the roots of Vietnamese heritage, especially Vietnamese spoken language, which had long been ignored and looked down upon by the elite class in Vietnam. His research Phan Khôi: Việt ngữ nghiên cứu was a well of knowledge for young Vietnamese to follow. One generation before Hoàng Văn Chí, one generation after Phan Chu Trinh, Phan Khôi represented a class of Vietnamese intellectuals caught between colonialism, nationalism, communism. Phan Khôi's progressive spirit and his lifelong effort to raise the Vietnamese people's awareness of human rights, civil rights, and good education were suppressed by the Communist Party with The Nhân Văn Affair since 1956 are being revived in the 2000s by the younger generation of Vietnam.

He served as a visiting lecturer for Jewish and Israeli History at the Schusterman Center for Jewish Studies at the University of Texas at Austin during the academic year 2011-2012. Education From 1965 until 1969 Gideon Greif attended Municipal High School (Gymnasium) in Tel Aviv. Later, from 1974 to 1976 he attended Tel Aviv University where he received his bachelor's degree in Jewish history, studying the history of the land of Israel. Between 1976 and 1982 he did his master's degree in Jewish History at Tel Aviv University. From 1996 until 2001 he studied at the University of Vienna from which he was awarded his PhD. Exhibitions Greif was the scientific advisor and historical consultant for the exhibition \\"With Me Here Are Six Million Accusers\\" which marked the 50th anniversary of Adolf Eichmann's trial in 1961, inaugurated April 11, 2011, at Yad Vashem, Jerusalem.Exhibit showcases Eichmann, 50 years after trial. Associated Press via Kyiv Post (11 April 2011). Retrieved 27 June 2014. The exhibition describes Eichmann's career at the SS, his personal responsibility for the deportation of millions of Jews to the ghettos and extermination camps, his attempts to hide after the war and the operation of his discovery and seizure in Argentina in 1960. The exhibition aims to prove that Eichmann was not the \\"murderer behind the desk\\", but a fanatic foe of the Jews, determined to send them to their deaths. Special projects Greif initiated in 2006 the project of the \\"Authentic Box Car\\", which is now standing on the ramp of Birkenau, not far from the main entrance to the camp, as an eternal memory to the hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews, murdered by the Germans in the gas chambers of Birkenau in 1944, and dedicated to the memory of Hugo Lowy. Greif's book We Wept Without Tears inspired Hungarian director László Nemes to create the film Son of Saul dedicated to the Sonderkommando. The film won the 2016 Academy Awards for the best foreign language film, and also won the 2016 Golden Globe for the Best Motion Picture- Foreign Language. Controversy In January 2017, together with representatives of Serbian and Jewish academic societies and the Serbian government representatives to the USA, Greif co-organised the exhibition Jasenovac 75 in New Jersey dedicated to genocide committed against the Serbs by Croatian Ustashe in the Jasenovac concentration camp. In January 2018, with Serbian representatives Greif co-organised the exhibition Jasenovac - pravo na nezaborav at the United Nations in New York. The exhibition was criticized by the Croatian MVEP for spreading false information and propaganda, while the UN distanced itself from the content of the exhibition. Greif claims the number of casualties in the camp was more than 700 or 800 thousand, which is a controversial outdated estimation. He admitted that his interest for the camp is only recent, while historian Ivo Goldstein noted Greif is not an expert on Jasenovac. In 2019, Grief was appointed by Bosnia's Serb-dominated entity Republika Srpska to head a commission to probe crimes of Srebrenica massacre during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina (1992-1995). The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia as well as the International Court of Justice and domestic courts have all characterised these killings as genocide. Western diplomats and Srebrenica Genocide Memorial Center fear the commission is a bid to rewrite history, as the Republika Srpska's officials, including Milorad Dodik, have repeatedly minimised the number of killed or denied it was a genocide. For his involvement in \\"in defense of the truth about the suffering of the Jewish, Serbian and other peoples during the World War II\\" he was awarded the Golden Medal for Merits of the Republic of Serbia.

Pernoll played professional baseball for nine years from 1907 to 1915, including parts of the 1910 and 1912 seasons in Major League Baseball for the Detroit Tigers. He appeared in 14 major league games and compiled a 4–3 record with a 3.39 earned run average (ERA) in 63-2/3 inning pitched. A native of Oregon, Pernoll also played in the Pacific Coast League for the Portland Beavers (1907–1908), Oakland Oaks (1911–1913), and San Francisco Seals (1913–1915). Early years Pernoll was born in 1888 on the Pernoll family homestead at Applegate, Oregon. He began pitching for the local team in Applegate. He then attracted the attention of the team in Grants Pass, Oregon, where he played in 1906 and 1907. He was described as \\"one of the best pitchers that ever threw a ball on any Southern Oregon diamond.\\" Professional baseball Pernoll joined the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League (PCL) in July 1907. He made his debut under the name \\"Busher Pernoll\\" on July 24, 1907, shutting out the Los Angeles Angels. At the time, The Oregon Daily Journal described him as a short, stout 19-year-old who had learned to throw a curve in the mountains near Grants Pass, Oregon. Pernoll also pitched for the Aberdeen Black Cats in 1908 and 1909. Playing against his former Portland teammates on May 20, 1909, he threw a complete-game shutout and also hit a double to bat in the winning run. He won 20 of his first 28 games in 1909, leading to a bidding war among major league teams for his services. In August 1909, the Detroit Tigers paid $4,000 for Pernoll to join them in 1910. He finished the 1909 season in Aberdeen with a 25-15 record. In 1910, Pernoll appeared in 11 games, five as a starter, for the Tigers. In his first start, he pitched a one-hit complete- game against the St. Louis Browns on April 27, 1910. He compiled a 4–3 record with a 2.96 ERA in 54-2/3 innings pitched during the 1910 campaign. In March 1910, the Detroit Free Press wrote: \\"Pernoll is an extremely stocky pitcher, burly as George Mullin ever was before he adopted his present scheme of training. He pitches with a peculiar short jerk motion, using no body swing, but getting the speed. He does it with his muscles alone.\\" Prior to the 1911 season, the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League purchased Pernoll's release from the Tigers for $4,000. He returned briefly to the Tigers in 1912 and appeared in three games, all in relief, compiling a 6.00 ERA. He appeared in his final major league game on May 13, 1912. He rejoined the Oakland Oaks in June 1912. He continued with the Oaks through the 1912 season, compiling a 4–11 record in 19 games. Pernoll started the 1913 season with Oakland and ended it with the San Francisco Seals. In 39 games played for both Oakland and San Francisco, he compiled a 15–14 record in 246 innings pitched.

The film stars Christian Slater, Elisha Cuthbert, Jamison Jones, and William H. Macy.  Plot  Bob Maconel (Slater) is an insignificant office worker who fantasizes about murdering his coworkers. On one particularly bad day, Bob is about to go on a murderous rampage when his coworker Ralf Coleman (David Wells) beats him to it, shooting up the office and killing several people. Bob shoots Coleman dead with the gun he planned to use on the others. He finds Venessa (Cuthbert), a pretty executive he has never had the courage to talk to, wounded on the floor, and saves her life. The former invisible nobody is suddenly thrown into the spotlight of public notice, and he is considered a hero by those he wished to murder. His boss, Gene Shelby (Macy), promotes Bob to \\"VP of Creative Thinking\\" and gives him all the perks of higher management. Meanwhile, he visits Venessa, who is now a quadriplegic; at first she curses him for not letting her die, and then she asks him to put her out of her misery. Venessa asks Bob to let her roll down a subway platform in front of an oncoming train. Bob debates whether or not to go through with it, scrawling \\"should I finish what Coleman started?\\", on a piece of paper. Bob initially agrees, and takes Venessa out for one last night on the town before letting her end her life. At the crucial moment, however, he cannot bring himself to let go of her chair, as he has fallen in love with her. They then discover that she can wiggle her little finger, providing hope that she may recover, and they become romantically involved. Bob is still trapped by the demons of his past, however, and fears that as soon as Venessa recovers, she will leave him. He becomes especially insecure when he finds out that Venessa and Shelby were once lovers. The company psychiatrist (Randolph Mantooth) reveals that he knows Bob wrote the note about Coleman, and that Bob was only promoted so management could keep an eye on him. Bob flies into a rage, gets into a fight with two coworkers, and storms out. He returns home to find Shelby visiting Venessa with gifts, further igniting Bob's jealousy. Once Shelby leaves, Bob demands to know what the two of them were doing; Venessa replies that Shelby has become concerned about Bob's behavior and stopped by to check on him. However, Bob opens Shelby's gift and finds photos of Shelby and Venessa together. Bob has a mental breakdown and goes back to the office, bringing his gun with him. Finally it is revealed that Bob has been hallucinating all of the events since just before the initial shooting. This time, he is in the same position as Coleman was, only instead of killing his coworkers, he shoots himself in front of Venessa. The last scenes show police searching his house to find a note that reads \\"you may ask why I did what I did... but what choice did you give me? How else could I have gotten your attention?\\" In the news, reporters interview his neighbors, who say that \\"he was a quiet man.\\"  Cast  * Christian Slater as Bob Maconel * Elisha Cuthbert as Venessa Parks * William H.

Home media The DVD version contains two alternate endings of the story. In a first alternate ending, the lead-up to the shooting reveals that Bob is indeed the shooter and intends to shoot Venessa (due to his frustration that she does not know he exists), but before he can fire a shot, Bob is himself shot several times in the chest. The scene reveals Coleman to be the hero in this ending, having shot Bob through the cubicle wall. As Bob lies on the floor and his vision fades to black, he sees coworkers standing over him, with Venessa being the last coworker, mouthing the words \\"I love you\\" before he dies. In a second alternate ending, all events of the first alternate ending come to pass. As Bob's vision fades to black and he sees Venessa mouth the words \\"I love you,\\" a faint beeping sound is heard. The scene then flashes to Bob, sitting in his cubicle, going through a normal day with the shooting having never taken place. Venessa walks by his cubicle and comments on the hula-dancing figurine on Bob's desk. Bob removes a notebook from his desk drawer, and notes that today, Venessa loved his hula girl. The image pans out to reveal a meticulously detailed log of all inconsequential events and interactions with Venessa over the course of months (or even years). The book then closes to the end credits.

The series was supposed to begin in the fall of 2001 but was delayed when the pilot episode inspired an enormous backlash. Winfrey was quoted as saying: In a September 2002 interview with Phil Donahue, Winfrey asked for advice on how one could do such shows without looking unpatriotic: “After we did a show called ‘Is War the Only Answer?’ I thought, Can’t you even ask the question without people attacking you”. Donahue replied by saying that dissent would become easier as time passed from September 11. Winfrey praised Donahue for plans to do anti- war shows on MSNBC, saying, “the bottom line is we need you, Phil, because we need to be challenged by the voice of dissent”,O, The Oprah Magazine September 2002 but was not yet ready to rejoin the anti-war movement herself. In the subsequent months, her position on joining the movement changed. Professor Daphne Read noted that in the aftermath of the attacks on the World Trade Center, The Oprah Winfrey Show, like all mainstream media, \\"was very closely tied to the Bush administration's response and the media rhetoric of America Under Attack, ...however, the content of Winfrey's forum began to diverge from the purely consensual, giving voice to a much wider range of views.”Professor praises Citizen Oprah - ExpressNews - University of Alberta  Episodes  =Help You Decide if You Think We Should Attack Iraq= On October 9 2002, Oprah did a show called \\"Help You Decide if You Think We should attack Iraq\\", in which she gave more time and weight to those who supported the war, and cut off an audience member who questioned if WMDs existed in Iraq. According to celebrity biographer Kitty Kelly, Oprah said weapons were \\"just a fact.\\" Oprah: A Biography by Kitty Kelley An anti-war website published an activist's letter objecting to Oprah's presentation: \\"That show was the biggest abuse of power that I have seen on television in a long time. ... A talk show host and idol to many, you usually present an open exchange of opinions. How could you allow such an unbalanced show like that to air, when the future of the entire Planet is at stake?!\\"My letter to Oprah =What Does The World Think Of Us?= As President Reagan's Special Envoy to the Middle East, Rumsfeld met with Saddam Hussein during a visit to Baghdad in December 1983, during the Iran–Iraq War (see video here). In early November 2002, Winfrey aired a show called “What Does The World Think Of Us?”What Does the World Think of Us? The show challenged Americans to be skeptical about their government's foreign policy. For this, Winfrey was praised by anti-war activist Michael Moore for being the only mainstream media figure at the time to show footage of Donald Rumsfeld shaking Saddam Hussein's hand in the 1980s. Moore wrote: Moore argued that the footage was especially important for Americans to see because the rest of the mainstream media was only showing much older footage of Jacques Chirac shaking Saddam Hussein's hand in the 1970s, seemingly to imply France opposed a war with Iraq because they were friendly with Hussein.Dude, Where my Country?, pg 86-87 =The World Speaks Out On Iraq= “The World Speaks Out On Iraq” was considered to be the most significant installment of Winfrey’s anti- war series, for being a two-day special aired on February 6, 2003, the day after Colin Powell's speech to the United Nations which was credited with shifting public opinion in favor of the war. Winfrey told her audience that it was the most important time to speak out against the war, and that she wanted to hear not just from her studio audience but from people around the world. She showed clips from citizens of Britain, France, South Africa, Iraq, and Pakistan, all urging America not to go to war. She also showed clips of Nelson Mandela and Pope John Paul II speaking out against war, and interviewed a spokesman for Patriots for Peace.West Virginia Patriots for Peace - Archived Events and Actions Also appearing on the show were anti-war activist Jessica Mathews and columnist Thomas Friedman, who debated whether America should go to war. Mathews pointed out that Saddam Hussein had no connections to al- Qaeda. While Friedman supported war only if America could get international support, he conceded that Hussein was not a security threat to America. At the end of the two-day show, Winfrey sided with Mathews, agreeing that the case for war was not convincing enough, considering the consequences. During part one of the show, a press conference held by George W. Bush and Colin Powell interrupted the show in many markets. An article in Buzzflash.com claimed the press conference was a deliberate attempt to silence debate: An article from Academics for Justice drew the same conclusion: =What You Should Know About Iraq= On March 6, 2003 Winfrey did a show called “What You Should Know About Iraq,” in which Middle East expert Fawaz Gerges described the suffering of the Iraqi people since Operation Desert Storm. Gerges argued that the desire of the Bush administration to overthrow Saddam Hussein would have a devastating effect on the Iraqi people. Dan Rather also talked about his interview with Hussein, in which Hussein was apparently curious about George W. Bush and the will of the American people to attack Iraq. The guests on the show explained that the United States had worked with several dictators in the past and actively aided Hussein during the administration of Ronald Reagan to keep the Islamic fundamentalist movement in Iran from spreading. On Oprah After The Show (aired on Winfrey's cable network Oxygen (now owned by NBC Universal)), Gerges urged Winfrey's audience not to believe reports linking Saddam Hussein to the September 11th attacks, reports which Winfrey condemned as \\"propaganda.\\" =Anti-Americanism – Why Do So Many Dislike the U.S.?= “Anti- Americanism - Why Do So Many Dislike the U.S.?” was the final installment in Winfrey's anti-war series. It aired on March 18, in the immediate aftermath of Bush’s 48-hour speech and just two days before the war began. The show explored whether, if America won a war with Iraq, it might lose something bigger.Anti-Americanism: Why Do So Many Dislike the U.S.? The show was strongly condemned by proponents of the war like Townhall.com’s Ben Shapiro, who criticized Winfrey for only including anti-Bush guests such as the anti- war Fawaz Gerges and Thomas Friedman. He also criticized Winfrey for showing bias during the show: Steve Perry of Minneapolis/St. Paul City Pages praised the show, writing: Also praising the show for its \\"amazing perspective\\" was The Globe and Mails television critic John Doyle, who noted that \\"at a time when the consensus in American television is that everybody should pull together and support the men and women in the U.S. military, what Oprah Winfrey did was outright subversion.\\" Gerges told Winfrey’s audience that although war was very imminent, he felt a responsibility to express his dissent right up to the last minute. A few months after the show aired, anti- war activist Michael Moore publicly begged Winfrey to run for president.Dude, Where’s my Country?, pg 255-258 References Category:Opposition to the Iraq War Category:Iraq War and the media Category:Oprah Winfrey ","title":"Oprah's Anti-war series"},{"id":"12267927","text":"Steven Thomas Fischer is an American film director, producer, and cartoonist.

The group included state Senator Edgar A. Brown, state Representative Solomon Blatt, Sr., Governor Joseph Emile Harley, and state Representative Winchester Smith, Jr. Together, the four occupied the most powerful positions of South Carolina government in 1941. Origins Strom Thurmond invented the term \\"Barnwell Ring\\" during his run for governor in 1946. He campaigned on a progressive platform which put him squarely at odds with the conservative legislators of the Barnwell Ring. They threw their support to James C. McLeod of Florence and they used every device at their disposal to prevent a victory by Thurmond in the Democratic primary election. For instance, when the gubernatorial candidates stumped at Barnwell, Winchester Smith paid candidate Roger Scott $50 to raise Cain about the \\"Barnwell Ring\\" in order to lessen the impact of Thurmond's speech against the ring. The ring arose in the late 1930s and lasted into the 1970s. State Senator Edgar A. Brown and state Representative Solomon Blatt were the chief principals of the ring. Brown was the president pro tempore and chairman of the Senate Finance Committee from 1942 to 1972. Blatt was the speaker of the house from 1937 to 1946 and 1951 to 1973. Both men denied the existence of the ring until 1963 when Brown exclaimed \\"Long live the Barnwell Ring\\" at a dinner to honor Blatt.

They have nothing whatsoever to do with the 6-sphere, which is an object of considerable interest in its own right.

He was born in Vienna as the son of Archduke Charles, Duke of Teschen (1771–1847) and Princess Henrietta of Nassau-Weilburg (1797–1829). He was a grandson of Leopold II (1747–1792) and nephew of Franz II (1768–1835), the last two Holy Roman Emperors. He held the office of Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights from 1863 until his death in 1894. He gained the rank of Feldzeugmeister in the service of the Austrian Army in January 1867, after commanding the artillery and being wounded at the Battle of Königgrätz (1866). He was Governor of the Federal Fortress of Mainz. Archduke Wilhelm of Austria died unmarried and without issue on 29 July 1894 in Weikersdorf after falling from a horse. He had been riding in Baden when his horse was frightened by a motor car. The horse bolted, and the Archduke was thrown. One of his feet remained stuck in the stirrup, and he was dragged more than 100 yards. He died without regaining consciousness. His death was attributed to a concussion on the brain.

He was a founding member and vice-chairman of the League of Canadian Poets and was elected its first secretary in 1968. He served as president of the Bibliographical Society of Canada (1974–76), and was a member of bibliographical societies in the U.S. and Britain. In 1976, he was named a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada. Lochhead's best-known book, High Marsh Road, a collection of 122 short poems chronicling his daily walks across the Tantramar Marshes in southeastern New Brunswick, earned him a nomination for a Governor General's Award in 1980. In 2005, when High Marsh Road/La Strada di Tantramar was awarded the Carlo Betocchi International Poetry Prize, Lochhead became the first non-Italian writer to win it. He also received the Alden Nowlan Award for Excellence in English-language Literary Arts in 2001 and the following year, became the first poet laureate for the town of Sackville, New Brunswick where he had lived since joining the faculty at Mount Allison University in 1975. The first 30 poems in High Marsh Road are posted on telephone poles leading from Sackville's main downtown intersection toward the marshes that so often stirred \\"the red sea of his singing\\".Lochhead, Douglas. (1980, 1996) High Marsh Road: lines for a diary. Fredericton: Goose Lane Editions, September 4. During his academic career, Douglas Lochhead held library appointments at several universities including Cornell, Dalhousie and York before his appointment as Founding Librarian of Massey College at the University of Toronto in 1963. After he became Davidson Chair of Canadian Studies at Mount Allison in 1975, Lochhead continued writing and publishing his many collections of poetry. \\"I think Douglas thought of poetry as a form of resistance,\\" his friend and fellow poet Peter Sanger told The Globe and Mail following Lochhead's death in 2011. \\"A form o[f] resistance to non-poetic thinking, to tyranny, to unimaginative views of the world.\\" Maritime roots Douglas Lochhead was born March 25, 1922 in Guelph, Ontario where his father, Allan Grant Lochhead, worked as a microbiologist and research scientist at the Malt Products Company of Canada. The family moved the next year when Allan Lochhead landed a job as Dominion Agricultural Biologist at the Central Experimental Farm in Ottawa. Lochhead's mother, Helen Van Wart, was an accomplished pianist and piano teacher who was born in Saint John, New Brunswick. \\"I was rushed to Fredericton at the age of two or three months to be baptized,\\" Lochhead told an interviewer in 1988, adding that the ceremony took place in the home of his maternal grandparents. He agreed that although he lived and went to school for most of the year in Ottawa, as a boy, his heart was in Canada's Maritime provinces. \\"We heard so much about it from my mother, who was a great Maritimer, but not overbearing, not tiresome—she had a healthy, natural enthusiasm about where she was from.\\" As a result of his mother's Maritime roots, Lochhead spent his boyhood summers at Duck Cove, near Saint John on the Bay of Fundy. Years later, he wrote about the significance of the early experiences he had there. \\"[F]or me, they help to explain the sense and feeling of place and people, which have become part of my poetry. They help to account for a closeness, a confidence which I have in being in the Maritimes.\\" Lochhead's only sibling, Kenneth was born in 1926. The brothers spent most of their holidays together in New Brunswick and shared a fascination with their parents' forested cottage property on the Gatineau River north of Hull, Quebec. Kenneth, who became one of Canada's foremost painters, recalled how his family loved the natural beauty of the place: \\"My mother didn’t want anything cut; the trillium would come up, and that was a sacred rite of spring...And my brother looking at birds and mother waiting for certain birds to appear; these images were poignant in the excitement of their experience and connection.\\" Over the years, Douglas Lochhead wrote several poems set in the Gatineau, while Kenneth painted a series of landscapes there. Lochhead's last collection Looking into Trees includes poems inspired by his brother's paintings which are also reproduced in the book. Education and military service Second World War poster In 1939, Douglas Lochhead enrolled in the pre-medical program at McGill University following in the scientific footsteps of his microbiologist father and his paternal grandfather William Lochhead who taught botany, genetics, geology and zoology at Macdonald College in Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec and who, in 1908, had founded the Quebec Society for the Protection of Plants from Insects and Fungous Diseases. Douglas Lochhead remembered spending many enjoyable hours in his grandfather's library reading his scientific papers, his collection of 19th century poetry and books by authors ranging from Darwin to Dickens. Lochhead quickly recognized, however, that his career in medicine would have been \\"a disaster for humanity\\" so he transferred to the university's arts program earning a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1943. After graduation, Lochhead joined the Canadian Army. He received training first, as an artillery officer, and then, in the infantry. He attained the rank of lieutenant, but the Second World War ended in Europe before he could be sent to the front. He then volunteered to fight in the Pacific War, but it too ended before he could be trained as a paratrooper.Contemporary Authors (1974). Detroit, Michigan: Gale Research Company, p.330 Lochhead was still in the army when he attended a friend's wedding in Toronto. He visited the University of Toronto campus and suddenly decided to pursue post-graduate studies there in English. He wrote his thesis on the British poets of the First World War earning his Master's degree in 1947. His experiences in the Canadian military formed the basis for his 1984 book, The Panic Field: Prose Poems in which he explores \\"the ways of men, caught up in the sprawling net of the army.\\" Marriage and library career After graduating from the U. of T., Douglas Lochhead drifted here and there from a job as an advertising copywriter to work as a government information officer. In 1948, he met Jean St. Clair Beckwith, a native of Cape Breton who was working as a librarian at the Toronto Public Library. They married the next year and at her suggestion, Lochhead enrolled at McGill University where he received his Bachelor of Library Science in 1951. The degree led to a career in the libraries of five universities. =From west to east= In 1951–52, Lochhead served as chief librarian at Victoria College, now the University of Victoria, in Victoria, British Columbia. When he wrote to Cornell seeking a job there because he had heard about the beauty of its library and campus, he received a telegram back offering him a job. He served at Cornell as cataloguing librarian until 1953, when he was offered the university or chief librarian's position at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. After seven years in Halifax, Lochhead became the first director of libraries in 1960 at the fledgling York University in Toronto. He helped plan and organize two large libraries there. \\"I was so busy buying books, I had to work like blazes to spend the money,\\" he told an interviewer many years later. While at York, he also served as an assistant professor of English, but disliked the heavy administrative workload associated with running the libraries.Contemporary Authors (1992). Detroit, Michigan: Gale Research Inc., pp.239-240 =Massey College= Exterior of Massey College In 1963, Lochhead was recruited by writer Robertson Davies, Master of Massey College at the University of Toronto, to found the library there. Aside from running the library, he taught bibliography, the history of printing and also served as a professor of English.New, William H. (2002). Encyclopedia of Literature in Canada. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, p.674 Lochhead had first become interested in bibliography, printing and the history of the book at Dalhousie. He developed those interests at Massey College as he and Davies built its bibliographical collection so that the Massey library would be useful to the whole university. \\"[W]e decided to build as complete a collection of every Canadian imprint, every impression, edition, or whatever, of Canadian poetry and prose,\\" he said. \\"So, the Massey library and my interests both became biographical.\\" At the same time, Lochhead expanded his knowledge of printing techniques with hand presses that used metal and wood type. He and his students also experimented with paper making. \\"I remember Rob Davies saying, 'I was going by the printing room, and I heard your students laughing. It's the first time I ever heard laughter coming out of the class on bibliography,'\\" Lochhead said later. \\"Well, we did laugh—we'd get ink all over ourselves, we'd make mistakes, and I also had anecdotes to tell, the things you pick up in teaching, you know.\\" Tantramar revisited Douglas Lochhead left Massey College in 1975 to become Edgar and Dorothy Davidson Chair of Canadian Studies at Mount Allison University in Sackville, New Brunswick. He told an interviewer later that he spent his first two years teaching and finding a centre for the program. He also extended its curriculum and, as always, continued writing poetry inspired by the unique geography around Sackville. The town occupies uplands overlooking a broad expanse of tidal, saltwater marsh that has long inspired poets such as Charles G.D. Roberts and Bliss Carman. Lochhead first saw the Tantramar Marshes from a troop train on his way to England during the Second World War. After moving to Sackville, he visited them nearly every day where he watched the many flocks of migrating birds and closely observed the landscape that became an important subject for his poems.Hamilton, William B.

After his formal retirement in 1990, he produced 16 more books of poetry. \\"A day Douglas didn't write was a day lost,\\" his friend Peter Sanger told a New Brunswick newspaper. \\"For him, poetry was celebration and he wanted others to share that celebration.\\"Hodd, Thomas. \\"Heart of the Tantramar; Sackville's poet laureate Douglas Lochhead passed away in March, but isn't to be forgotten,\\" Telegraph-Journal, April 2, 2011, p.F5. When his wife, Jean, died of cancer in 1991, Lochhead elegized her in the collections Black Festival (1991) and Homage to Henry Alline & Other Poems (1992). In 1998, heart problems required him to undergo triple-bypass surgery. He was named Sackville's first poet laureate in 2002 in recognition of his status as a writer whose work reflected an intense interest in and sensitivity to local places. Increasingly frail, he moved to a Sackville nursing home in 2009 and died there on March 15, 2011. Honours In 1977, he received the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal. The Bibliographical Society of Canada awarded Lochhead the Marie Tremaine Medal in 1985. In 1987, he received honorary doctorates from Saint Mary's University (D.Litt.) and Dalhousie University (L.L.D). In 2006, the University of New Brunswick awarded Lochhead an honorary doctor of letters degree.

Professional baseball player In 1912, Perry played in 13 games for the Detroit Tigers, seven as the backup center fielder to Ty Cobb, and the rest as a pinch-hitter. Perry had a .167 career batting average, not good enough to compete for playing time in center field with Cobb. Perry began his career in 1905 as a pitcher, but made a good showing as an outfielder with the Grand Rapids Orphans of the Central League. He was rated as \\"the best outfielder in the Central\\". He was purchased from Grand Rapids by the Detroit Tigers in late 1905 or early 1906 but did not appear in any games. The Tigers then sold him to the Indianapolis Indians of the American Association, with whom he signed in March 1906. During his 11-year career, Perry played minor league baseball for the Grand Rapids Orphans (1905-1906), Indianapolis Indians (1906), Canton Chinamen and Watchmakers (1907-1908), York White Roses (1909), Sacramento Sacts (1910), Providence Grays (1911-1912), Buffalo Bisons (1913), Jersey City Skeeters (1913), Syracuse Stars (1914), and Bay City Beavers (1915).

His mother, Gertrude Martha Robins, was the daughter of Sanderson Robins, another Anglican clergyman, and Caroline Gertrude Foster-Barham, the scion of the Foster-Barham family of Jamaican plantation owners and granddaughter of the 8th Earl of Thanet. In 1891 Fortescue entered the Scots' College in Rome, where, due to his exceptional musical talent, he was soon appointed organist. He was awarded the degree of Bachelor of Divinity in 1892 and his PhD in 1894, when he entered the theological faculty at Innsbruck University. He was ordained to the priesthood on 27 March 1898 by Simon Aichner, Bishop of Brixen. Between 1899 and 1905 Fortescue passed doctoral examinations in moral theology, dogma, ecclesiastical history, canon law, Arabic, and biblical science—passing the examination in Semitic languages with great distinction, a rare achievement. On 10 June 1905 he was awarded the degree of Doctor of Divinity, making him the very rare recipient of a triple doctorate. The level of his scholarship was so exceptional that he was awarded a prize presented to him personally by the Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria. Fortescue was also a well-known adventurer, travelling to the Middle East, Asia Minor, and Greece, among other places. In the process, he learned Syrian Arabic, some Turkish, and Persian (he was already fluent in Greek from his academic studies). At the time of his death, Fortescue was Professor of church history at St Edmund's College, Ware, the oldest Catholic school in England. =Ministry= Altar servers of St Hugh's, Letchworth (); Fortescue is vested in cope, in centre After a number of temporary positions, interrupted by his doctoral examinations, Fortescue was eventually appointed Missionary Rector of Letchworth in Hertfordshire in November 1907. There he faced the task of building a church from scratch. Much of the church he designed and paid for personally, and parish records show that he in fact donated more each year than he received in his annual stipend. In time the beautiful little church, dedicated to Hugh of Lincoln, became renowned for its music and rich liturgical life. Although Fortescue's personal inclination was for the life of a scholar, his sense of duty would never allow him to put his scholarly pursuits before the care of the souls entrusted to him. He would give the last penny in his pocket to help a needy parishioner, and frequently found himself in financial difficulties as a result of his generosity. He never refused to see a caller, however inconvenient it might be for him to interrupt his work. =Death= Fortescue's grave in Letchworth Cemetery On 20 December 1922, Fortescue was diagnosed with cancer. He preached his last sermon on 31 December, a simple but profound lesson on the reality of the Incarnation of Christ, ending with the words, \\"That is all I have to say.\\" On 3 January 1923 he left Letchworth for Dollis Hill Hospital, where he died of cancer on 11 February. Against the wishes of his family, he was buried at Letchworth Cemetery, among his own parishioners. Works The best-known of Fortescue's publications during his lifetime was Ceremonies of the Roman Rite Described, which he actually wrote not out of academic interest but to raise funds for construction on his church. In 1913 Fortescue compiled a book of Latin Hymns which he originally gathered for the use of his parishioners, providing his own English prose translations. He also contributed many articles to the Catholic Encyclopedia (1907–1913), and it is in this context that his work has the most public familiarity today. With his love of history and skill with languages, Fortescue devoted much study to the origin and history of the Eastern Churches, both Catholic and Orthodox. Among his most famous works are The Orthodox Eastern Church and The Lesser Eastern Churches. Fortescue was also an artist of considerable talent, especially in the media of watercolour, drawing and calligraphy. He was also a recognised authority on heraldry, and his own designs were widely admired in his day. A memorial exhibition of Adrian Fortescue's work was organised in the Letchworth Public Library in 1923. Memorials A plaque to Adrian Fortescue on the side of Fortescue Hall at the Church of St Hugh of Lincoln in Letchworth An exhibition about Fortescue and the Church of St Hugh of Lincoln he founded was produced by the First Garden City Heritage Museum, in Letchworth Garden City. The exhibition featured rare and special objects relating to Fortescue and the church, and ran from 5 November 2007 until 26 January 2008. The First Garden City Heritage Museum holds material relating to Fortescue, as well as copies of the exhibition text, images and display material. There are plaques dedicated to Fortescue in the Church of St Hugh of Lincoln in Letchworth.

Early life  Madeline W. Murphy, the second of three children of Arthur E. Wheeler, Sr., and Madeline (née Hall) Brooks, was born in Boston and raised in Wilmington, Delaware. She was educated in the Wilmington public schools and she graduated from Howard High School where she was valedictorian. She attended Temple University in Philadelphia for two years where she met her husband-to-be, Judge William H. Murphy Sr. at a dance at a nearby university. The couple were married from 1942 until Judge Murphy's death in 2003. They lived in Delaware and Chicago briefly, before moving to the Baltimore area in 1945. After a year at Turner's Station they moved to Cherry Hill, an all-Black lower-income neighborhood in the south section of Baltimore.  Community work  As a freelance writer, community organizer and activist, Mrs. Murphy was devoted social, racial and economic justice through her use of the written word and via various forms of civic engagement. During her sixty years in Baltimore, she participated in numerous community organizations. As a resident of Cherry Hill, she ran unsuccessfully for City Council. And over a span of 26 years, she was involved in some capacity with 14 different political campaigns. After having been a volunteer for fifteen years, she was appointed director of community services for the Cherry Hill Community Presbyterian Church, where she served from 1959 to 1969. In that position, she developed programs in literacy, political education, and youth development. The church served as a last resort for many Cherry Hill residents in need of food, clothing, counseling, job placement and was a location of community organizing around the issues facing welfare recipients and the lack of affordable housing. Under her leadership, this organizing led to the creation of a state-funded day care center in the church for welfare recipients and job training program participants. Mrs. Murphy organized one of the first contingents of neighborhood VISTA volunteers, a group that later became active in the National Welfare Rights Organization and tenant organizing. During her life, she mentored many African-American women in Baltimore from childhood through college and beyond. Admirably, her community work was both personal and public, and grassroots as well as civic. Mrs. Murphy served as a charter commissioner on the governing board of the city of Baltimore's Anti-Poverty Program (headed by Parren J. Mitchell), worked on the Community Action Commission, and from 1969 to 1972, became a training officer in the Community Action Agency (the predecessor to the Urban Services Agency). She also coordinated a freshman sociology course at Dickinson College in Carlisle, PA, called \\"Perspectives on Race\\", from 1970 to 1972.  Public life  Mrs. Murphy was also a well-known public figure with a career as a commentator in local television and radio. She appeared as a regular guest host on the Larry Angelo Show in 1976, and she brought compelling black guests to the program. She served as a guest reporter on Black Point and Black News Conference with Wiley Daniels on Baltimore's WJZ-TV. Mrs. Murphy also wrote and broadcast a weekly commentary for the Morgan State University radio station WEAA, on its program Impact News. However, she was best known as a feature panelist on the WJZ-TV program hosted by Richard Sher (newscaster), Square Off from 1976 until 1986. As a print journalist, Madeline Murphy wrote an editorial column for the Friday edition of the Baltimore Afro-American Newspaper for twenty-one years and later for the Baltimore Times. The book entitled Madeline Murphy Speaks is a compilation of the best of these articles.  Personal life  Mrs. Murphy traveled extensively throughout the United States, North Africa, the Caribbean, China and Europe, and wrote numerous articles on her travels. In particular she traveled to many communist countries, including the former Soviet Union (Russia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan), East Germany, Cuba, and China in 1985. She was proud of defying U.S. government policies that discouraged and prohibited travel to these nations. She was married for 54 years to Judge William H. Murphy Sr. and is survived by her sister, Mary Ann Franklin, son, noted Maryland trial attorney William H. Murphy, Jr., daughter, Madeline Murphy Rabb, son, Arthur W. Murphy, son, Houston W. Murphy and daughter, former Director of the Washington D.C. office of the ACLU, Laura W. Murphy. She died of a heart attack while at home at the age of 84. At the time of her death she was also survived by ten grandchildren, and seven great- grandchildren. Her younger brother, Arthur Edward Wheeler, Jr., preceded her in death.

One woman is wearing a farshi pajama while it is spread out; another wearing a farshi pajama is holding it up while walking. Farshi Pajama (also Paijama) (Urdu: فرشی پائجامہ, Hindi: फारसी पजामा, Bengali:ফর্শি পায়জামা) is a woman's dress that was worn between early 20th centuries in Muslim courts of Oudh by royalty and ladies from privileged classes of Uttar Pradesh (formerly United Provinces of Agra and Oudh in North India). Modeled after the flowing gowns worn by British noblewomen,http://www.india-seminar.com/2008/585/585_ritu_kumar.htm the complete outfit consists of three basic parts – the kurta or a long shirt, the dupatta or the long stole (an essential piece in traditional Indian wear covering the head and chest), and the third and most important, the farshi pajama, which is a flowing two-legged skirt held by drawstrings. It falls straight to the ankles from where it starts flaring flowing copiously onto the floor. The farshi pajama in this era is often called Farshi Gharara, a term not used before the mid-20th century and is considered a distortion. The confusion is said to be because of the Farshi Pajama's similarity with the Gharara. Farshi means \\"associated with the \\"farsh\\" or floor (for example farshi baithak which is associated with sitting on the floor). When combined with the word Pajama, the term evolves to mean a bottom-wear garment that falls generously on the floor and trails as one walks. In reality, when walking, an expert wearer holds the dress by carefully pulling up and folding the excess flaring trail and holding it in her left hand, keeping the right one free. The large quantity (historically, 9-15 yards) of expensive cloth, embroidered using the art of goldwork (embroidery) and sterling silver wire threads (Karchob/Zari/Zardozi etc.), used to make a farshi gharara mainly reflects the grandeur and extravagance of the nobles and rulers of that era. Different eras brought changes to the fashion and cuts of the dress. These variations were also dependent from one princely state's court to another. Modified, smaller-length versions are still, but rarely, worn by women in weddings in India and Pakistan to recreate bygone elegance. Movies such as Umrao Jaan (1981) and Shatranj Ke Khilari (1977) that depict Muslim culture of 19th-century Lucknow show noblewomen and royal courtesans wearing farshi pajamas.

He played professional baseball for five years from 1912 to 1916, including two seasons in Major League Baseball for the Detroit Tigers in 1914 and 1915. Known for his ability to throw a spitball with control, he appeared in 30 games, nine as a starter, and compiled a 5–4 win-loss record and a 2.62 earned run average. As a rookie in 1914, he compiled a 2.08 ERA and defeated Walter Johnson in a 2–1 decision on August 25, 1914. Reynolds also played in the minor leagues for a team in Minneapolis, Kansas (1912) and for the Topeka Kaws (1912–1913), the Louisville Colonels (1915), and the Denver Bears. Arm troubles ended his career in 1916 at age 29. Early years Reynolds was born in Barksdale, Texas, in 1887. He grew up and made his home in Wetumka, Oklahoma. He was six feet, two inches tall, weighed 185 pounds, and threw and batted right-handed. Professional baseball =Minneapolis and Topeka= Reynold began his professional baseball career in 1912 at age 25, playing for the Minneapolis Minnies in the Central Kansas League. He compiled a 17–11 record in 30 games for Minneapolis. In August 1912, Reynolds was purchased from Minneapolis by the Topeka Kaws of the Western League for $300 down and another $300 if Reynolds \\"made good.\\" In September 1912, the Cincinnati Reds drafted Reynolds, but they drafted him from Minneapolis rather than Topeka. On that basis, Topeka was able to nullify the draft in proceedings before the national commission, and Reynolds remained with Topeka for the 1913 season. On July 21, 1913, he pitched a no-hitter into the eighth inning and shut out Wichita by a 5–0 score. =Detroit Tigers= On August 1, 1913, the Detroit Tigers purchased Reynolds from Topeka for $5,000, consisting of $4,000 in cash and two players. The sum was the highest price ever received by the Topeka club for the sale of a player. The agreement allowed Reynolds to remain with Topeka through the end of the 1913 season. At the time of the sale, Reynolds was described as \\"a big fellow and has just as much stuff left in the ninth inning as he starts out with in the first.\\" At the end of spring training in 1914, manager Hughie Jennings had decided to send Reynolds to the minor leagues, but pitcher Jean Dubuc persuaded team owner Frank Navin to keep Reynolds on the Tigers' lineup. Dubuc opined that Reynolds had the best control of a spitball he had ever seen. Dubuc added: \\"If you want a 'Walsh in the bud,' keep this fellow. He has a fine spit-ball, good control, holds men on the sacks and has plenty of nerve. He's a comer or I don't know anything about pitching.\\" Detroit sports writer E. A. Batchelor had this to say about Reynolds: \\"He is well over six feet, broad-shouldered and deep chested and has one of those square jaws which denotes courage under fire.\\" The Tigers followed Dubuc's advice and used Reynolds principally as a relief pitcher during the 1914 season. Reynolds appeared in 26 games for the Tigers in 1914, seven as a starter, compiling a 5–3 record with a 2.08 earned run average (ERA). His ERA was ninth best in the American League. on August 25, 1914, Reynolds allowed only five hits and won a pitching duel with Walter Johnson, as the Tigers defeated the Washington Senators, 2–1. Reynolds scored the winning run after Johnson misplayed his bunt, allowing it to roll through his legs. After advancing to second base, Ty Cobb got a base hit to right field, and Johnson deflected the throw to the plate allowing Reynolds to score. In 1915, Reynolds appeared in only four games for the Tigers, two as a starter, all early in the season. His ERA soared to 6.35 as he gave up eight earned runs, 17 hits and five bases on balls in 11-1/3 innings pitched. He appeared in his last major league game on May 1, 1915. According to one account, his \\"old fault of wildness\\" bothered Reynolds in early games for the Tigers. =Louisville and Denver= On May 16, 1915, Reynolds was sold to the Louisville Colonels and appeared in 15 games for the Colonels during the 1915 season. On August 9, 1915, Reynolds was fined and suspended for the remainder of the season for failing to observe the club's training rules. He was reportedly not \\"in condition to play good base ball.\\" In March 1916, the Louisville club sold Reynolds to the Denver Bears of the Western League. His release was a surprise to Louisville fans given the progress Reynolds had made during spring practice. He had reportedly shown up in \\"superb condition\\" and had been \\"one of the hardest workers in the training camp.\\" Reynolds appeared in 18 games for Denver and compiled a 4–7 record with a 3.03 ERA. On July 8, 1916, having suffered from \\"a bad arm,\\" Reynolds was released by the Denver club. Later years Reynolds died in Ada, Oklahoma, in 1970, at age 82.

She was the daughter of Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor (1708–1765) and Maria Theresa of Austria, Holy Roman Empress (1717–1780). She died of smallpox at the age of 16 and was buried in the Imperial Crypt, Vienna, Austria.  Biography  Liotard Maria Antonia Born on 19 March 1751, Maria Josepha was the ninth but sixth surviving daughter of Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor and Maria Theresa, Queen of Hungary and Bohemia. After the death of her sister-in-law Princess Isabella of Parma, Maria Josepha was the most important female at court after her mother, niece Archduchess Maria Theresia and sister Archduchess Maria Amalia. She lost that position in May 1767 when her older brother Archduke Joseph married a second cousin, Maria Josepha of Bavaria. Empress Maria Theresa wanted to marry her fourth eldest surviving daughter, Archduchess Maria Amalia, to Ferdinand of Naples and Sicily for political reasons. However, after Ferdinand's father Charles III of Spain objected to the five-year age difference, Maria Josepha, as the next eldest daughter, was left as the obvious candidate for Ferdinand's hand in marriage. She and Ferdinand were the same age, and better yet, Maria Josepha was considered \\"delightfully pretty, pliant by nature,\\" and the favorite of her brother Joseph. Maria Josepha had been terrified of dying of smallpox ever since the death of her older sister Archduchess Maria Johanna Gabriela in 1762. Her fears were realised when she died of smallpox on the very day she was to have left Vienna for her journey across the Alps to marry Ferdinand. Popular belief holds that she contracted smallpox because her mother, Maria Theresa, insisted that she go and pray at the improperly sealed tomb of her sister-in-law, Empress Maria Josepha, who had recently died of the disease because they shared the same name. However, the rash appeared two days after Maria Josepha visited the vault, and there is an incubation period of about one week after initial infection before symptoms of a rash appear. Therefore, the Archduchess must have been infected before visiting the vault. She is buried in vault number 46 at the Imperial Crypt Vaults of the Imperial Crypt, Vienna. After her death, her sister Maria Carolina of Austria was given as a bride to the King of Naples in her place.Fraser, p. 29.

The station was formerly known as Estação Central (Central Station) and that designation still appears in its façade. Trains gain access to the station, which is in the central urban area of Lisbon, through a tunnel which is over long.  History  The station was commissioned by the Portuguese Royal Railway Company and was designed between 1886 and 1887 by Portuguese architect José Luís Monteiro. It was built in one of the most important squares of Lisbon, the Rossio, and connected the city to the region of Sintra. The tunnel was excavated under the city and is considered one of the most important works of engineering in Portugal dating from the 19th century. It was completed in 1890, and soon after Lisbon's Circle Line with a connection to the North Line also opened. The station became Lisbon's main passenger terminus until 1957, from that date only a few long distance trains terminated at Rossio, mainly West Line services, until the early 1990s. Sidónio Pais, the fourth President of Portugal, was assassinated in Rossio Station in December 1918. The station was closed to rail services from 22 October 2004 until 12 February 2008 due to tunnel renewal work.  Architecture  Statue of King Sebastian of Portugal on the façade of the station. The statue was accidentally destroyed in 2016 The Neo- Manueline façade dominates the northwest side of the square and is a Romantic recreation of the exuberant Manueline style, typical of early 16th century Portugal. Its most interesting features are the two intertwined horseshoe portals at the entrance, the clock in a small turret and the abundant sculptural decoration. Inside, the platforms are connected by ramps to the façade level and are covered by a cast-iron structure executed by a Belgian firm. The station is an important example of Romantic (façade) and cast-iron (platform cover) architecture in Portugal. On 3 May 2016, a 126-year-old statue of Sebastian of Portugal that stood in a niche between the entrance portals was accidentally destroyed by a person who knocked it over by climbing up for a photograph.

Club career Prior to his arrival in Portugal to sign with Vitória de Guimarães for the 2006–07 season (with the club in the second division, finally winning promotion), Paris-born Desmarets played the vast majority of his career in modest French clubs, never appearing in higher than the third level. He quickly became an undisputed starter, contributing with four goals in all 30 Primeira Liga games as the Minho team overachieved for a final third place in his second year, ahead of S.L. Benfica. In June 2010, after only missing four league matches combined in two top level campaigns, adding four goals, 30-year-old Desmarets signed as a free agent for one year with Deportivo de La Coruña in Spain, with an option for another one.Desmarets llega hoy a A Coruña y pasará el reconocimiento médico mañana jueves (Desmarets arrives today in A Coruña and will have medical Thursday); Deportivo La Coruña, 16 June 2010 (in Spanish) He only appeared in 12 La Liga games during the season – 693 minutes of action – which finished in relegation.

Nada is most famous for raising successful European human rights legal cases to defend himself against accusations of terrorism by the United States. The U.S. accusations, made directly after the 9/11 attacks, resulted in his placement on the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1267 terror blacklist. In 2001, Nada, former chairman of al Taqwa Bank, was placed on the UN terror list by the US Treasury Department. Nada was alleged to have financed activities of al Qaeda, charges Nada vehemently denied. The U.S. accusation was made applicable under the UN terror-listing program and affected his life in Switzerland, notably his assets, reputation, honor, and ability to move freely. In 2006, he sued the Swiss government for restitution of financial losses due to the Swiss investigation. By 2009, both the Swiss and Italian investigations of Nada were dropped as no evidence was found to support the U.S. accusations. Both Switzerland and Italy petitioned the UN Terrorism Committee to remove Nada's name from the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1267 blacklist, at the objection of the United States. The U.S. finally acquiesced to his removal on 24 September 2009, but retained Nada on the domestic U.S. Treasury list under Executive Order 13224 until 25 February 2015 when it also removed his name from its own sanctions list. While the United States refused to disclose evidence of Nada's guilt, claiming that the evidence was classified, it removed his name from all its lists silently with little fanfare in 2015. Between 2007–2009, Nada's ordeal featured heavily in a report by Swiss Senator and former Prosecutor Dick Marty on behalf of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. Mr Marty's report assessed the UN's terror-blacklisting procedures against international rule of law standards - along with those for a similar blacklist run by the European Union - and concluded that both were \\"completely arbitrary\\" and violated human rights. In 2008, Nada raised a case against Switzerland at the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, also a body of the Council of Europe. On 12 September 2012, the European Court of Human Rights ruled in favor of Nada, citing that Nada's human rights had been violated,In Nada v. Switzerland, ECHR Finds Swiss Implementation of UN Counter-Terror Sanctions Violated Rights to Respect for Private and Family Life, Effective Remedy, International Justice Resource Center, 13 September 2012Bern violated Youssef Nada's rights: Court, The Local (Switzerland's English-language paper), 12 September 2012] in the context of the European Convention on Human Rights. In this ruling the government of Switzerland was ordered to pay Nada 30,000 Euros in damages, for their treatment of him as a person placed — with no evidence of guilt — on the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1267 terror blacklist by the United States.Parliamentary Assembly - Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights, UN Security Council black lists, Introductory memorandum, AS/Jur (2007) 14, 19 March 2007 Personal history Youssef Nada was born on 17 May 1931 in Alexandria, Egypt.Government of Canada: SOR/2001-491: Regulations Amending the United Nations Suppression of Terrorism Regulations, Canada Gazette, vol 135, no 5, 9 November 2001Das Eidgenössische Volkswirtschaftsdepartement, gestützt auf Artikel 16 des Embargogesetzes vom 22. März 2002 In his late teens, Nada became affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood.U.N. Drops Muslim Brotherhood Figure From 'Terrorist Finance' List, Mark Hosenball, Newsweek (The Daily Beast), 17 March 2010 Between 1952–54, Nada was imprisoned with 300,000 Members of the Muslim Brotherhood in a desert-based Egyptian military concentration camp. Many persons imprisoned in this camp were tortured as a result of Gamal Abdel-Nasser's famous campaign against the group. After release, Nada returned to University in Alexandria and began a business with a friend, producing milk. (authorized biography of Nada) In the late 1950s, Nada moved to Europe, setting in Austria, and began working with a cheese factory in Graz. In 1961, a close friend of Nada's invited him to Libya where a construction boom was developing. Nada seized on the occasion and started to spend his time between Libya and Austria. In a matter of a few years he became the largest supplier of cement to the North African country. The activity led him to partner with Cementir, the Italian cement maker, to develop in 1965 the world's first floating cement silos, two barges named GI-1 and GD-2 able to store bulk cement and loaded with bagging facilities. Cement soon became his main business along with smaller operations in other commodities ranging from steel to agricultural materials. Nada had tremendous business success in his ventures with Saudi Arabia, Libya and eventually, the Nigerian government.Bern violated Youssef Nada's rights: Court, Associated France Press (AFP) reported in The Local (Swiss News in English), 12 September 2012 During the 1960s, the Egyptian government fell back into conflict with the Muslim Brotherhood. Youssef Nada became one of the members wanted by the Egyptians. This led to Nada settling permanently in Europe. By 2001, the time of the accusations for which he became famous, Nada was a resident of Italy. He lived in Campione, a small Italian 'enclave' adjacent to the Swiss canton of Ticino. The road to enter his property, and home, crossed through Switzerland. This is why his being banned from Swiss territory placed him in a state of virtual house arrest for a number of years. It explains why the Swiss SECO made it legal entanglements with the Swiss government inevitable. Youssef Nada gagne son procès contre la Suisse, Le Matin, 12 September 2012 Claims about Nada =Meeting in Algeria= A 1986 article in London-based Asharq Al-Awsat reported that Nada, along with Ahmed Ben Bella, a former president of Algeria, held a secret meeting at his Switzerland home attended by \\"major figures in some of the world’s most violent groups.\\" Other attendees the meeting included the \\"Blind Sheikh\\" Omar Abdel-Rahman and Sayyed Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah, a leading Lebanese Shi'ite Muslim scholar. In an interview on al- Jazeera,Interview of Youssef Nada on Al Jazeera website Nada himself vehemently denied any such thing to have occurred An instance of al-Jazeera's regular talk program, Century Witness, presented by Ahmed Mansour; several interviews from 4 August 2002 until 29 September 2002 citing that well-known hatred between the individuals made such a meeting implausible. Nada claimed further that the London-based newspaper which made the allegations had links to Arab governments opposed to the Muslim Brotherhood. =\\"The Project\\"= In a November 2001 raid on offices and residences associated with Youssef Nada, an untitled document, written in Arabic and dated 1 December 1982, ostensibly outlining a plan to infiltrate and defeat Western countries was found. Later referred to as \\"The Project\\" by Swiss-French journalist Sylvain Besson, the content and provenance of the document would become the subject of conflicting media accounts in subsequent years. Though the document contains no mention of the Muslim Brotherhood in its original form,translation of \\"The Project\\" furnished by FrontPage magazine it would be portrayed as a seminal Brotherhood text outlining their plan for Muslims to infiltrate and defeat Western countries. =Nada's rebuttal= Nada claimed that the aforementioned stories were fabrications, made for political purposes. This is a claim at least partly supported by the findings of the Swiss and Italian investigations, which cited that the accusations against him appeared to have political roots. Beyond this, Nada claims that from mid-1997, numerous western journalists appeared to be acting in the service of various foreign intelligence agencies in the Middle East, supporting claims that benefitted certain regimes in the Arab world and that such journalists knew well were false. The names he focuses on are Sylvain Besson, Guido Olimpio, Richard Labaviere, Mark Hosenball, Michael Isikof and Victor Comras, all journalists who have pushed dafamatory allegations against Nada and which were found baseless by all the authorities who investigated them. Terror investigations =Swiss and Italian investigation, 2001–2005= Although the claims against him were made by the United States, the nature of the UN terror sanctions program made Nada's treatment as a terror suspect international. Therefore, most of the actions taken in his direction were in the hands of Swiss and Italian authorities, due to his residential and business linkages to the two countries. In November 2001, the Swiss government froze 24 bank accounts associated with Nada, and the Swiss federal prosecutor's office, led by Claude Nicati, began an aggressive inquiry into the activities of Nada and Taqwa co- director Ali Ghaleb Himmat. Both men repeatedly denied any connection with Osama bin Laden and his al-Qaeda network.Gerichtshof für Menschenrechte gibt Youssef Nada Recht (in German), Sudostschweiz, 12 September 2012 Ultimately the Federal Court in Bellinzona ordered tbe prosecutor to close the investigstions, having produced no evidence to support any form of charges.Nada gewinnt Rechtsstreit mit der Schweiz (in German), 12 September 2012, Tages Anzeiger =Swiss and Italy drop investigation, ask UN to remove his terror-listing= On 1 June 2005, the Swiss case was dropped due to lack of evidence. The Prosecutor was admonished by the Court for opening a file on Nada without any specific reason. The Italian case was closed in 2007, after a lengthy investigation whereby the Prosecutor stated that the grounds for opening the case appeared to be more political and agenda-driven rather than judicial or evidence based. Italian premier newspaper Corriere della Sera reported on this.\\"«Solo politica»: i pm bocciano le «black list» di Onu e Ue\\", Corriere della Sera, 24 July 2007 Both the Swiss and Italian governments petitioned the Committee of the United Nations in-charge of the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1267 terror blacklist. In 2009, Nada was removed from the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1267 terror blacklist (UNSC 1267).Security Council Al-Qaida and Taliban Sanctions Committee Approves Deletion of One Entry from Consolidated List, UN CTC webpage (23 September 2009) =Tried in absentia in Egyptian military trial= In January and February 2007, Egypt announced it had frozen the assets of dozens of top Muslim Brotherhood figures, warning that at least 40 persons were to stand trial in Egypt's military court. The Associated Press notes this court is \\"known for its swift trials and no right of appeal.\\"Agence France-Presse, 24 January 2007; Associated Press, 6 February 2007; Ikhwanweb, 8 February 2007 In April 2008, an Egyptian military tribunal sentenced Nada in absentia to ten years' imprisonment for providing financial support to the Muslim Brotherhood.Corriere del Ticino (16 April 2008) In his 2008 filings at the European Court of Human Rights, Nada claims he had not been informed of the proceedings against him and that he had therefore never had the possibility of defending himself in person nor of sending a lawyer to represent him. Nada noted that the trial was held before a military tribunal even though he was a civilian, and therefore called the proceedings into question as being an unfair trial. =Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe inquiry= A 2007 report for the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) by Swiss Senator Dick Marty described the Nada case as being \\"like a page out of Kafka\\". Investigations of the case, and the injustices suffered by Nada, who has never been proven to have any links to Al Qaeda, nor the Taliban, were the focal point of a two-year PACE human rights investigation. During this investigation, the UN SC 1276, and other UN terror-blacklisting programs, came under harsh scrutiny and criticism. The PACE report summarised the situation in these terms: ::\\"Even the members of the committee which decides on blacklisting are not given all the reasons for blacklisting particular persons or groups. Usually, those persons or groups are not told that blacklisting has been requested, given a hearing or even, in some cases, informed of the decision — until they try to cross a frontier or use a bank account. There is no provision for independent review of these decisions\\". PACE concluded that then (and still current) terror blacklisting procedures were unworthy of the UN and EU. Criticisms were levied stating that these kind of injustices did not help to fight terrorism, but to promote popular frustrations by persecuting persons without justice and transparency.United Nations Security Council and European Union blacklists, Doc. 11454, 16 November 2007United Nations Security Council and European Union blacklists (Addendum to the report) (16 November 2007) In 2010, PACE's rapporteur made a third-party submission to the European Court of Human Rights in support of Nada's case against Switzerland (see below), which was ultimately successful.Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights Information note: Compatibility of UN Security Council and EU [terrorist] Black Lists with European Convention on Human Rights requirements, AS/Jur/Inf (2010) 05, 7 December 2010 =European Court of Human Rights ruling= On 12 September 2012, the European Court of Human Rights decided that Switzerland had violated various Articles of the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, aka \\"The Convention\\". The court ruled that Switzerland violated Nada's human rights by restricting his cross-border movements after the United States put Nada on a blacklist on suspicion of financing terrorism. The United States had accused Nada of helping finance the 9/11 terrorist attacks, placing him on the United Nations Security Council Resolution 1267 terror blacklist, a sanctions list for persons associated with Al Qaeda and the Taliban. The United States refused to provide evidence to support the accusation, claiming the information was classified. Still, the terror-blacklisting left Nada in a position of being treated as a criminal, without trial, nor with any means of appeal. The Strasbourg court ruled that \\"Switzerland should have taken all possible measures, within the latitude available to it, to adapt the sanctions regime to the applicant's individual situation\\". Switzerland was ordered to pay Nada €30,000 to cover his costs and expenses.Egyptian businessman wins lawsuit against Switzerland, Swissinfo, Sept 12, 2012 The decision was seminal, as it made clear that the Convention was required to be upheld, in relation to persons subject to UN terror-blacklisting, under UN SC 1267.

Early life and education  Archduchess Maria Johanna Gabriela Josepha Antonia, commonly called Johanna, was born at the Vienna Hofburg on 4 February 1750 as the eleventh child and eighth daughter of Francis Stephen of Lorraine, Holy Roman Emperor and Maria Theresa, Archduchess of Austria and Queen of Hungary and Bohemia. One year later, she was joined by a sister, Archduchess Maria Josepha. Joanna Gabriela and her favourite sister, Josepha Maria Johanna was part of a string of children born soon after one another and was thus placed in the Kindskammer (the imperial nursery) along with her siblings Maria Josepha, Maria Carolina, Ferdinand Charles, Maria Antonia and Maximilian Francis; they were mainly looked after by ladies-in-waiting and their attendants. At the age of five, Johanna received her own suite of rooms in the imperial palace and some additional tutors. She had a good relationship with her siblings, albeit with the regular fraternal quarrels, as Maria Theresa encouraged her children to get along. Johanna was very close to her sister Maria Josepha; the two were educated together and had the same aios and aias, as the male and female tutors were called in the imperial family. The girls enjoyed a varied education which was closely monitored by their parents. Due to her untimely death, Johanna's education covered only one phase of the two that Maria Theresa had created for her children: she studied Reading, Writing, Latin, French , Italian , Greek , Spanish , German , English , History , Geography, Land Surveying, Military Architecture, Mathematics, Music, Dancing and Gymnastics as well as Religious Studies from the age of three. Additionally, Johanna was highly educated in making music and dancing, both subjects her mother loved and had excelled at in her own childhood. While the boys were taught to play different instruments, Johanna and her sisters were given singing lessons. A special theatre was built at Schönbrunn especially for the children; Johanna and her siblings gave frequent musical performances. Another very important part of the Archduchess's education was art: she was educated in drawing and painting, a field where the girls particularly excelled. All in all, Johanna and Josepha \\"developed satisfactory, worked hard at their lessons and were involved in numerous festivities in which they participated enthusiastically.\\"  Engagement and death  Her sarcophagus in the Imperial Crypt Maria Theresa pursued a deliberate marriage policy to which all of her children had to submit. Thus, she married most of her children off throughout Europe. She and King Charles III of Spain agreed that Maria Theresa's fourth daughter, Archduchess Maria Amalia, would marry Charles III's son, King Ferdinand III of Sicily and IV of Naples; but Charles later wanted to break off the engagement due to Amalia being five years older than Ferdinand. Maria Theresa then turned her attention to Johanna, the closest sister who was just one year older than Ferdinand, so she betrothed Johanna to Ferdinand instead. In the second half of the eighteenth century, smallpox was ravaging the Holy Roman Empire. Leopold Mozart, father of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, wrote that \\"in the whole of Vienna, nothing was spoken of except smallpox. If 10 children were on the death register, 9 of them had died from smallpox.\\" Johanna's older brother Karl Joseph died of smallpox in 1761 and Maria Theresa became a strong supporter of inoculation, a primitive way of immunization. In order to set a strong example, the Empress ordered the inoculation of all her remaining children. Although without incidents for the other children, Johanna became ill after the inoculation and died shortly thereafter. She was buried in the Imperial Crypt in Vienna.

The use of the comma token as an is distinct from its use in function calls and definitions, variable declarations, enum declarations, and similar constructs, where it acts as a . Syntax The comma operator separates expressions (which have value) in a way analogous to how the semicolon terminates statements, and sequences of expressions are enclosed in parentheses analogously to how sequences of statements are enclosed in braces: \`(a, b, c)\` is a sequence of expressions, separated by commas, which evaluates to the last expression \`c\` while \`{a; b; c;}\` is a sequence of statements, and does not evaluate to any value. A comma can only occur between two expressions – commas separate expressions – unlike the semicolon, which occurs at the end of a (non-block) statement – semicolons terminate statements. The comma operator has the lowest precedence of any C operator, and acts as a sequence point. In a combination of commas and semicolons, semicolons have lower precedence than commas, as semicolons separate statements but commas occur within statements, which accords with their use as ordinary punctuation: \`a, b; c, d\` is grouped as \`(a, b); (c, d)\` because these are two separate statements. Examples In this example, the differing behavior between the second and third lines is due to the comma operator having lower precedence than assignment. The last example differs as well since the return expression must be fully evaluated before the function can return. /* Commas act as separators in this line, not as an operator. * Results: a=1, b=2, c=3, i=0 */ int a=1, b=2, c=3, i=0; /* Assigns value of b into i. * Commas act as separators in the first line and as an operator in the second line. * Results: a=1, b=2, c=3, i=2 */ int a=1, b=2, c=3; int i = (a, b); /* Assigns value of a into i. * Equivalent to: int (i = a), b; * Commas act as separators in both lines. * The braces on the second line avoid variable redeclaration in the same block, * which would cause a compilation error. * The second b declared is given no initial value. * Results: a=1, b=2, c=3, i=1 */ int a=1, b=2, c=3; { int i = a, b; } /* Increases value of a by 2, then assigns value of resulting operation a + b into i. * Commas act as separators in the first line and as an operator in the second line. * Results: a=3, b=2, c=3, i=5 */ int a=1, b=2, c=3; int i = (a += 2, a + b); /* Increases value of a by 2, then stores value of a to i, and discards unused * values of resulting operation a + b. * Equivalent to: ((i = a) += 2), a + b; * Commas act as separators in the first line and as an operator in the third line. * Results: a=3, b=2, c=3, i=3 */ int a=1, b=2, c=3; int i; i = a += 2, a + b; /* Assigns value of a into i. * Commas act as separators in both lines. * The braces on the second line avoid variable redeclaration in the same block, * which would cause a compilation error. * The second b and c declared are given no initial value. * Results: a=1, b=2, c=3, i=1 */ int a=1, b=2, c=3; { int i = a, b, c; } /* Commas act as separators in the first line and as an operator in the second line. * Assigns value of c into i, discarding the unused a and b values. * Results: a=1, b=2, c=3, i=3 */ int a=1, b=2, c=3; int i = (a, b, c); /* Returns 6, not 4, since comma operator sequence points following the keyword * return are considered a single expression evaluating to rvalue of final * subexpression c=6. * Commas act as operators in this line. */ return a=4, b=5, c=6; /* Returns 3, not 1, for same reason as previous example. * Commas act as operators in this line. */ return 1, 2, 3; /* Returns 3, not 1, still for same reason as above. This example works as it does * because return is a keyword, not a function call. Even though compilers will * allow for the construct return(value), the parentheses are only relative to \\"value\\" * and have no special effect on the return keyword. * Return simply gets an expression and here the expression is \\"(1), 2, 3\\". * Commas act as operators in this line. */ return(1), 2, 3; Uses The comma operator has relatively limited use cases. Because it discards its first operand, it is generally only useful where the first operand has desirable side effects that must be sequenced before the second operand. Further, because it is rarely used outside of specific idioms, and easily mistaken with other commas or the semicolon, it is potentially confusing and error-prone. Nevertheless, there are certain circumstances where it is commonly used, notably in for loops and in SFINAE.http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/sfinae For embedded systems which may have limited debugging capabilities, the comma operator can be used in combination with a macro to seamlessly override a function call, to insert code just before the function call. =For loops= The most common use is to allow multiple assignment statements without using a block statement, primarily in the initialization and the increment expressions of a for loop. This is the only idiomatic use in elementary C programming. In the following example, the order of the loop's initializers is significant: void rev(char *s, size_t len) { char *first; for (first = s, s += len; s >= first; s) { putchar(*s); } } An alternative solution to this problem in other languages is parallel assignment, which allows multiple assignments to occur within a single statement, and also uses a comma, though with different syntax and semantics. This is used in Go in its analogous for loop.Effective Go: for, \\"Finally, Go has no comma operator and ++ and  are statements not expressions. Thus if you want to run multiple variables in a for you should use parallel assignment (although that precludes ++ and ).\\" Outside of for loop initializers (which have a special use of semicolons), the comma might be used instead of a semicolon, particularly when the statements in question function similarly to a loop increment (e.g. at the end of a while loop): ++p, ++q; ++p; ++q; =Macros= The comma can be used in preprocessor macros to perform multiple operations in the space of a single syntactic expression. One common use is to provide custom error messages in failed assertions. This is done by passing a parenthesized expression list to the \`assert\` macro, where the first expression is an error string and the second expression is the condition being asserted. The \`assert\` macro outputs its argument verbatim on an assertion failure. The following is an example: #include #include int main ( void ) { int i; for (i=0; i<=9; i++) { assert( ( \\"i is too big!\\", i <= 4 ) ); printf(\\"i = %i \\", i); } return 0; } Output: i = 0 i = 1 i = 2 i = 3 i = 4 assert: assert.c:6: test_assert: Assertion \`( \\"i is too big!\\", i <= 4 )' failed. Aborted However the assert macro is usually disabled in production code, so use it only for debug purposes. =Condition= The comma can be used within a condition (of an if, while, do while, or for) to allow auxiliary computations, particularly calling a function and using the result, with block scoping: if (y = f(x), y > x) { ... // statements involving x and y } A similar idiom exists in Go, where the syntax of the if statement explicitly allows an optional statement.The Go Programming Language Specification: If statements =Complex return= The comma can be used in return statements, to assign to a global variable or out parameter (passed by reference). This idiom suggests that the assignments are part of the return, rather than auxiliary assignments in a block that terminates with the actual return. For example, in setting a global error number: if (failure) return (errno = EINVAL, -1); This can be written more verbosely as: if (failure) { errno = EINVAL; return -1; } =Avoid a block= For brevity, the comma can be used to avoid a block and associated braces, as in: if (x  1) y = 2, z = 3; if (x  1) y = 2, z = 3; instead of: if (x  1) {y = 2; z = 3;} if (x  1) { y = 2; z = 3; } Other languages In the OCaml and Ruby programming languages, the semicolon (\\";\\") is used for this purpose. JavaScript and Perlhttps://perldoc.perl.org/perlop.html#Comma-Operator utilize the comma operator in the same way C/C++ does. In Java, the comma is a separator used to separate elements in a list in various contexts. It is not an operator and does not evaluate to the last element in the list.https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38733508/is-comma-operator-or- separator-in-java See also * Sequence point * Operators in C and C++ * Operator (programming) References =Bibliography=  * External links * \\"Effect of using a comma instead of a semi-colon in C and C++\\", Stack Overflow * Boost.Assignment – facility from the Boost library that makes it easy to fill containers by overloading the comma operator Category:C (programming language) Category:C++ Category:Operators (programming) ","title":"Comma operator"},{"id":"12268494","title":"She's Everything"},{"id":"12268507","text":"Snakehead rhabdovirus (SHRV) is a novirhabdovirusRhabdoviridae ICTVdB Index of Viruses, Version 28, June 2002. Retrieved on 2007-07-15. that affects warm water wild and pond-cultured fish of various species in Southeast Asia, including snakehead for which it is named. Isolation Investigations were conducted in the 1970s and 1980s to search for infectious agents that cause or contribute to a severe ulcerative disease, known as epizootic ulcerative syndrome (EUS), which causes high mortalities among a variety of fish species in Asia and the Pacific region. SNRV was isolated by virologist W. Wattanavijarn from a snakehead murrel, Channa striata (formerly Ophicepahalus striatus), a species of snakehead fish, which exhibited signs of epizootic ulcerative syndrome following an outbreak of this syndrome in Thailand. The new viral isolate was identified as a rhabdovirus based on images and measurements taken via transmission electron microscopy and biochemical test results. Plaque neutralization tests and immunofluorescence tests demonstrated that the new isolate was serologically unrelated to several other fish rhabdoviruses, including anquilla rhabdovirus (EVX), infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus (IHNV), pike fry rhabdovirus (PFRV), spring viremia of carp virus (SVCV), and viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV). Subsequent infection studies exposing healthy snakehead murrels from a susceptible population to SHNV did not develop clinical signs associated with EUS, suggesting that SHRV does not play a significant role in EUS. Taxonomy It is classified as a novirhabdovirus because it possesses a nonvirion gene (NV), which is the distinguishing feature of this genus. The NV gene is situated between the glycoprotein (G) and the polymerase (L) genes, and contains a single open reading frame (ORF), which is 335 nucleotides in length. It is called the \\"nonvirion\\" gene because no corresponding protein is present in the virion. Although the NV genes of novirhabdoviruses are similar in size, including approximately 110-122 codons, little sequence homology is evident. Coding sequences of its glycoprotein (G) genes were found to be similar to the three other presently-classified novirhabdoviruses, VHSV, IHNV, and Hirame rhabdovirus (HIRRV), with between 36% and 47% amino acid identity. Structure SHRV is an enveloped, bullet-shaped RNA virus measuring approximately 170 nm x 60 nm with an electron dense nucleocapsid. Genome The SHRV genome is a non-segmented, negative sense RNA genome that is approximately 11,550 nucleotides in length, with six ORFs, including the matrix (M) gene, the nonvirion (NV) gene, the nucleoprotein (N) gene, the phosphoprotein (P) gene, the polymerase (large protein, L) gene, and the viral glycoprotein gene (G), arranged in the following order: 3'-N-P-M-G-NV-L-5'. Replication Viral replication occurs at both 15 °C and 28 °C in cell line derived from snakehead and carp, although the optimal temperature range for viral replication is between 28 °C and 31 °C. Stability SHRV has been demonstrated to become inactivated following treatment with acid (pH = 3), chloroform (50%), and heat (56 °C). SHRV in distilled water can be completely inactivated by less than five minutes of exposure to 12.5 ppm chlorine, 50 ppm iodine, or a 1:2000 dilution of peroxygen disinfectant. Exposure of infective virions in cell culture material to 2% formalin reduced infectivity by 99.9% after 5 minutes, and completely after 30 minutes. However, exposure of infectious cell culture material to 0.025% formalin for 60 minutes caused only a negligible reduction in infectivity, and more than 50 ppm chlorine was needed to inactivate the virus Also in cell culture fluids, exposure to 500 ppm iodine for 30 minutes did not reduce infectivity. The virus does not lose infectivity when exposed in cell culture fluids to malachite green for 6 hours at 5 ppm. Experimental Infections =Snakehead Infections= Infection studies with SHNV did not produce disease in exposed healthy snakehead murrels. =Zebrafish Infections= The first experimental infections conducted with SHRV in zebrafish demonstrated that the NV gene played no important role in the pathogenesis of infection. Subsequent experimental infections exposed zebrafish embryos, juveniles, and adults to SHRV by immersion and/or intraperitoneal (IP) injection. Whereas embryos and larvae were susceptible to infection by immersion, adult zebrafish were only susceptible to infection by IP injection. Histopathology of infected embryos and juvenile fish revealed vascular monocyte accumulation, accumulation of cellular debris in the gas bladder, necrosis of hepatocytes, and necrosis of pharyngeal epithelial cells. SHRV induced interferon (IFN) and orthomyxovirus resistance (Mx) gene expression in zebrafish at levels dependent on route of inoculation and fish age.

He played professional baseball for eight years from 1905 to 1912, including two years in Major League Baseball for the Detroit Tigers in their American League pennant winning years of 1907 and 1908. In four major league games, he compiled an 0-3 record and a 4.32 earned run average (ERA). Early years Malloy was born in 1885 in Massillon, Ohio. Professional baseball player Malloy began his professional baseball career in 1905 with the Massillon Farmers and Mount Vernon Clippers of the Ohio- Pennsylvania League. He advanced in 1906 to play for the Evansville River Rats of the Central League. He appeared in 30 games, pitched 224 innings, and compiled an 11-15 record. He began the 1907 season with the Dayton Veterans of the Central League. He appeared in 35 games for Dayton, pitched 166 innings, and compiled an 18-15 record. Late in the season, he was acquired by the Detroit Tigers and made his major league debut on October 6, 1907. He pitched a complete game against St. Louis, allowing 10 runs (five earned) and striking out six batters. With that as his only appearance in 1907, he compiled a 0-1 record and a 5.63 ERA. Malloy returned to the Tigers in 1908, appearing in three games and compiling an 0-2 record with a 3.71 ERA. He appeared in his last major league game on June 1, 1908.

Developed in a partnership between Donald J. Trump and SIMDAG, a Tampa- based development company, construction of the towers was never started due to the economic collapse of the real estate market. Located at the northwest corner of West Brorein St. and South Ashley Avenue, the building would have been visible from the end of Bayshore Boulevard and Tampa General Hospital on the Hillsborough River waterline.  History  Ground was broken on March 2, 2006, and in July 2007 the foundation footings were drilled. In September groundwork was halted when instabilities in the bedrock were found. Pilot borings showed that the limestone in one area dipped far below that of the surrounding areas. Brownstone Partners Tampa, an investment group led by Robert Owens of OR&L; Facility Services, acquired the property on June 20, 2011. St. Petersburg, Florida based Feldman Equities filed plans with the city in late July, 2015, for a very similar 52-floor tower on the same property. As of March 9, 2007, the fence surrounding the construction site was taken down and some of the construction equipment was gone; although two cranes remained. On March 9, 2007 the developers acknowledged in a press release that, \\"Cost overruns won't be the only obstacles Related [Related Group, the development company] faces. Soil issues at the site, unpaid contractors and a general perception from the community that the 52-story luxury condominium tower will never be built also stand in the way of making the tower a success.\\" On May 30, 2007, Donald Trump demanded his name be removed from the project, and sued the developers for over $1 million in unpaid license fees for the use of the Trump name. On the same day, the phone at the developer's office was listed as disconnected. Buyers who put down 20 percent deposits of units priced from $700,000 to $6 million only got half their money refunded and lawsuits were filed against Trump. After acquiring the property in a June 2011 deal, Robert Owens told the Wall Street Journal that he planned to build a mixed-use complex with retail, offices and a hotel or condominiums there. This plan did not come to fruition. In 2015, a joint venture of developer Larry Feldman's Feldman Equities and investment firm Tower Realty Partners paid $12.1 million for the 1.5-acre site, with plans to build a new 52-story building containing condos, office space, shops, and restaurants. The new planned building, named Riverwalk Place, is slated to open in 2020.

The Portuguese Air Force maritime patrol units and the Navy's Helicopter Squadron (EHM, Esquadrilha de Helicópteros da Marinha) are the present successors of the former Portuguese Naval Aviation. Although generically referred as \\"Naval Aviation\\", the air component of the Navy was officially successively designated \\"Navy's Aviation Service\\" (1917-1918), \\"Naval Aeronautics Service\\" (1918-1952) and \\"Aeronaval Forces\\" (1952-1958). In 1958, the Aeronaval Forces, which were already part of the Air Force - although still under the Navy's operational control and operated by naval personnel - were disbanded and its assets fully integrated in the Portuguese Air Force. In 1993, an air component was reactivated in the Portuguese Navy, in the form of the Navy's Helicopter Squadron, to operate its new shipborne helicopters entering service with the Vasco da Gama class frigates. The remaining aviation activities which were once performed by the Naval Aviation, including the maritime air patrol, anti-surface warfare and air-sea rescue, continue however to be performed by the Portuguese Air Force. History FBA Type B seaplane, the first aircraft of the Portuguese Naval Aviation The origins of the Portuguese Naval Aviation date back to 1916, when two Navy officers were sent to France to undergo flight training as part of a larger effort started in 1913 to create a military aviation school capable of serving as the basis for the creation of both the Army's and Navy's aviation services. These two Navy officers — 1TEN Artur de Sacadura Cabral and GMAR AN António Joaquim Caseiro — underwent basic flight training at Chartres and flying boat flight training at Saint-Raphaël, Var. During Sacadura Cabral's stay in France, he was also appointed by the Navy Ministry to establish contact with the French aviation industry to study the existing hydroplane models to equip a future Portuguese naval air service. Upon their return, both were appointed flight instructors at the Military Aviation School of Vila Nova da Rainha (), the navy's section of the Army's School of Military Aeronautics (, EAM), with Sacadura Cabral being appointed instruction director. Meanwhile, Navy personnel started receiving flight training and aircraft maintenance instruction at the school and abroad, in France. Also upon his return to Portugal, Sacadura Cabral was asked by the War Minister to designate an appropriate location for a future hydroplane naval air station, which later became the Bom Sucesso Naval Air Station (). In late 1916, due to the threat posed by the submarines of the Imperial German Navy to the merchant ships sailing along the Portuguese coast during World War I, the French government asked Portugal permission to install a naval air station in Portugal. 1st Lieutenant Maurice Larrouy, of the French Navy, elaborated a study which proposed the installation of an airship and hydroplane base in Lisbon, and two additional hydroplane bases in the north and south of Portugal. However, due to the logistics costs of operating airships, Sacadura Cabral opposed the plan of installing an airship base in Lisbon and instead the decision was made to equip Bom Sucesso with anti-submarine flying boats and to build a hydroplane base for the French Naval Aviation in Aveiro. =Creation of the Navy's Aviation Service= On September 28, 1917, the Navy's Aviation Service () was created with its personnel, material and aviation school being separated from the Army's EAM. The service was then installed at the Bom Sucesso Naval Air Station in the Lisbon docks. Two F.B.A. flying boats, received in March 1917 and stored at EAM, arrived at Bom Sucesso by December 1917, marking the beginning of the Navy's independent flight operations. For the centennial, on September 28, 2017, citizens and tourists near the Torre de Belém in Lisbon were treated to a short afternoon air show of planes and helicopter over the Tagus River plus an anniversary ceremony on the riverbank including a military band. =Naval Aeronautics Service= Lieutenant-Commander Sacadura Cabral and Captain Gago Coutinho in the cockpit of the Fairey III seaplane Lusitânia, at the departure for the first aerial crossing of the South Atlantic On January 5, 1918, the naval aviation was renamed to Naval Aeronautics Service (). In April 1918 the first flying boats of the French Navy arrived at São Jacinto, in Aveiro. Together with the Portuguese aircraft at Bom Sucesso naval air station, this allowed them to perform anti-submarine patrols and cover the coastal Portuguese waters and the main ports. This same year the United States Navy started operating Curtiss HS-2L hydroplanes from Horta, Faial Island. With the end of the war the French Navy left São Jacinto and handed over the naval air station to the Portuguese Navy as well as 18 Donnet-Denhaut D.D.8 and two Georges Levy G.L.40 flying boats as a gift. On December 28, 1918, a Portuguese Navy officer took command of the São Jacinto Naval Air Station (). The United States Navy left as well their base at Horta and offered to the Portuguese Navy four Curtis HS-2L. These aircraft were transported and ship to Lisbon and started operating from Bom Sucesso in 1923. In 1919 aircraft of the Portuguese Naval Aviation operating from São Jacinto were used against the pro-monarch movement Monarchy of the North, during the political instability in Portugal that resulted from the assassination of President Sidónio Pais. The first documented use of Portuguese aircraft from ships was in 1922, during the First aerial crossing of the South Atlantic, when after an accident in Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago the aircraft used by the Portuguese aviators was embarked into the Brazilian civilian ship Bagé and transported back to Lisbon. In April 1931, following an attempted military takeover in Funchal, Madeira, the Portuguese government declares martial law in Madeira and in the Azores. Four CAMS 37A of the Naval Aviation were then sent on April 11 to Horta, Azores, by ship to perform reconnaissance, ground attack, and psychological warfare missions against the local revolting forces. These aircraft flew 100 hours and were hit by small arms fire and fireworks converted into rudimentary anti-aircraft rockets. Nevertheless, no aircraft were lost and all returned to Lisbon by the end of the hostilities. At this time, the Magalhães Corrêa naval modernization program () included the purchase of a seaplane tender that was order from Italy in 1931. However, as consequence of the 1929 economic crisis, the value of the Lira collapsed and the increase of the acquisition costs led to the contract being canceled. Nevertheless, as part of the modernization program two 1st class avisos of the NRP Afonso de Albuquerque were built with the capacity to carry a floatplane, Hawker Osprey III. These aircraft were mostly used in reconnaissance and training and by the 1940s it was decided that they added didn't add any further capabilities to the ship and their facilities were replaced on the ships by anti-aircraft artillery. =Reorganization of the Naval Aeronautics Service= On September 30, 1936, the Naval Aeronautics Service suffered a deep reorganization. Its operational component became the Navy's Air Forces (FAA, Forças Aéreas da Armada), which was foreseen to include permanent and reserve naval aeronautical forces. It was organized in flights, each including from six to 12 single-engine or from three to five multi-engine aircraft of the same type. The flights could be subdivided in sections and grouped in groups of flights. Besides the Navy's Air Forces, the Naval Aeronautics Service also included the Directory of the Naval Aeronautics and the naval aeronautics establishments (naval air stations, naval air posts and the Admiral Gago Coutinho Naval Aviation School). Between 1939 and 1940 Avro 626 equipped with floats, and Grumman G-21B Goose were bought. During its service, the Grumman Goose established regular transport between continental Portugal to the Azores and performed search and rescue missions. In February 1941, a Short Sunderland was interned after being forced to land on the Portuguese coast, during a flight from the United Kingdom to Gibraltar, due to high winds. That same year, twenty de Havilland DH-82A Tiger Moth were transferred to the Portuguese Navy from a large batch bought by the Portuguese government and also received from the UK as compensation for the use of the aviation facilities in Azores. These aircraft were found to be more economical for the flight training of new pilots, as most training accidents with float- planes resulted in the total loss of the airframe, and allowed to improve and expand the training at the \\"Almirante Gago Coutinho\\" Naval Aviation School, in Aveiro. In 1943, the Naval Aviation received former-Royal Air Force Bristol Blenheim bombers, while these aircraft had already been used extensively in combat, they were equipped with modern avionics and communication equipment which allowed the Portuguese Navy to familiarize their personnel with more modern combat aircraft. 12 Airspeed Oxford for flight and navigation training were also transferred to the Naval Aviation as part of the use of the aviation facilities in Azores by the UK. The first six aircraft were delivered in 1943 but the remaining aircraft were only delivered in 1947, after the end of the war. In 1945, a batch of Bristol Beaufighter TF.X were received also as part of the deal for the use of the Azores by the British during World War II. These aircraft improved greatly the combat capacity of the Naval Aviation but due to high maintenance costs were shortly after retired, with many aircraft still having many flight hours left. After the war Beechcraft AT-11 Kansan and Beechcraft D-18S aircraft were acquired as surplus aircraft from the United States Navy. These aircraft served mostly in the connection between the continent, Azores, Cape Verde, and Portuguese Guinea. The last major acquisition of combat aircraft by the Naval Aviation was in 1950, when several Curtiss SB2C Helldiver dive bombers were bought from the United States through the Mutual Defense Assistance Act. These aircraft equipped a new anti- submarine squadron based at São Jacinto, in Aveiro. In 1951, the Naval Aviation tested, at the Lisbon Naval Aviation Centre, a civilian Westland WS-51 Dragonfly Mk.1A for possible shipborne operations. This helicopter was later sold to Italy and later served in the Italian Air Force with the tail number MM80118I. =Aeronaval Forces= With the unification of the Army and Navy's military aviation services by the Under-Secretary of State for the Aeronautics (), the Portuguese Air Force (PoAF) was created in 1952 and all Naval Aviation assets were transferred to this new branch. However, the naval aviation's units formed inside the Air Force a semi-independent branch for operational and training purposes designated Aeronaval Forces (). By 1958, with the anti-submarine and maritime patrol squadrons completely integrated into the Air Force, the Naval Aviation was finally disbanded and its last remaining technicians and officers returned to the Navy. =Fully integration in the Air Force= Between 1958 (when it integrated the Army Light Aviation and the Aeronaval Forces assets) and 1993, the Portuguese Air Force maintained the monopoly of the military aviation activities in Portugal, including those which were once performed by the Naval Aviation. The former Montijo Naval Air Station (now the Montijo Air Force Base) continued to concentrate the maritime aviation assets, namely the maritime patrol aircraft. In 1964, in the Guinean theatre of the Portuguese Overseas War, a PoAF Alouette II made what is considered the first helicopter operation from a Portuguese Navy ship, by performing personnel transport and medical evacuation missions from a wooden platform constructed on the Nuno Tristão frigate. Later in the war other helicopter medical evacuations were made by PoAF helicopters to Sam Brás support ship. During the war and after the war Alouette III helicopters operated on the flight decks of the João Coutinho-class and Baptista de Andrade-class corvettes and of the São Gabriel support ship. In 1987, upon the modernization of the João Belo-class frigates, it was considered equipping them with a flight deck and a telescopic hangar to enable them to carry an organic anti-submarine helicopter. However, the modernization program continued without making these changes to the ships. =Navy's Helicopter Squadron= Bartolomeu Dias frigate Vasco da Gama frigate The Navy's Helicopter Squadron (, EHM) was created as part of the Navy's acquisition program of the new s, which included a helicopter as an anti-submarine warfare system. In 1977, with the need to replace older ships in its fleet, the Portuguese Navy created a work group () to study the purchase of new ships, including new frigates. This work group also proposed the acquisition of helicopters to equip the new frigates. However, mostly due to lack of funds, a decision wasn't made to acquire new equipment. Finally in the middle of the 1980s, with the continuation of the Cold War and the need to modernize the naval fleet, a decision was made to purchase new frigates with the capacity to operate helicopters. At the end of the decade of 1980, the Navy started evaluating both the Kaman SH-2 Seasprite and Westland Lynx as the frigate's on-board helicopters. In August 1988 a group of officers were sent to Plymouth, United Kingdom to undergo the Air Engineer Application Course, at the Royal Naval Engineering College, to start receiving training in aerodynamics, shipborne aeronautical systems, engine maintenance, and the control and certification of all maintenance procedures. In April 1989 the officers continued their training at HMS Daedalus, and later were divided into two groups and sent to receive their certifications at 829 Naval Air Squadron and 715 Naval Air Squadron of the Royal Navy Air Arm. Having returned to Portugal in October 1989, the officers that underwent training in the United Kingdom integrated a new work group for the acquisition of the naval helicopters (, GTAH). In December 1989 the final decision was made to acquire five Westland Super Lynx Mk.95 helicopters. The Navy's Helicopter Squadron was officially created on June 2, 1993, with the mission of training the helicopter maintenance personnel and on-board helicopter operations crews, support the flotilla, naval units and embarked helicopter detachments, and maintain two helicopter detachments. The squadron was activated on June 8, 1993, and was based at the Montijo Air Base, with its facilities being inaugurated on September 24 of the same year and the first two helicopters having been delivered on July 29. In 1995, the first helicopter detachment was formed and started on-board operations. Currently, the Naval Aviation operates the Lynx helicopters from the Vasco da Gama-class and s. Since the reactivation of the Naval Aviation it was decided to use the available Air Force's logistics and training infrastructure to reduce costs and improve the overall unit performance. As such, officers are selected from the Naval School and then undergo flight training at the Air Force on the Aérospatiale Epsilon TB-30 with 101 Squadron and later on the Aérospatiale Alouette III with 552 Squadron. Having completed their flight training in the Air Force, the naval pilots return to the Navy to start their operational conversion to the Lynx helicopter at the Helicopter Instruction Center (, CIH) of the EHM. In addition to training both flight pilots () and tactical pilots (, co-pilot and observer), the CIH also gives instruction to maintenance personnel and system's operators — sonar, winch operator, and rescue swimmer. As part of its helicopter training the Navy also has a partnership with the Joint Lynx Simulator Training Establishment (JLSTE) for the use of a Lynx helicopter simulator located at the Maritime Aviation Site De Kooy, in the Netherlands.

On January 2, 1953, it was transferred to newly built facilities located at Montijo which, besides a seaplane base, included an airfield, becoming officially the \\"Sacadura Cabral\\" Naval Air Station. It was renamed \\"Air Base No. 6\\" on June 12, 1954. *Aveiro Naval Air Station (CAN Aveiro, Centro de Aviação Naval de Aveiro): was activated in 1918 at the São Jacinto península, during World War I, as a base for anti-submarine seaplanes operated by the French Navy with the support of Portuguese land crews. In that same year, it started to be operated by the Portuguese Navy. Later an airfield was constructed and in 1953 it was converted into a Portuguese Air Force base. *Azores Naval Air Station (CAN Açores, Centro de Aviação Naval dos Açores): seaplane base installed in 1918 in Horta during World War I. In 1919, it was transferred to Ponta Delgada, being deactivated in 1921. The base was reactivated in 1941 during World War II being definitely deactivated in 1946. *Algarve Naval Air Station (CAN Algarve, Centro de Aviação Naval do Algarve): seaplane base constructed in 1918, at the Culatra Island, on the coast of Faro and Olhão, during World War I, to operate anti-submarine flying boats. Although its hangars and main infrastructures were built, supporting occasional deployments of seaplanes, it was never officially activated. Its facilities served later to support the naval fire range installed in the area, which was deactivated in the middle 1990s. *Macau Naval Air Station (CAN Macau, Centro de Aviação Naval de Macau): seaplane base installed at the Taipa island in 1927 to support the Portuguese naval forces which were combating the piracy on the seas of China, in the period of the Chinese Civil War. The air station was deactivated in 1933 but was reactivated in 1937, by occasion of the Second Sino-Japanese War. In 1940, it was transferred to the new facilities constructed at the Exterior Port of Macau. In 1942 it was definitely deactivated. =Other naval air units= *Military Aeronautics School (Escola de Aeronáutica Militar): joint Army-Navy unit created in 1914, at Vila Nova da Rainha, Azambuja municipality to train crew members for the developing Portuguese military aviation. It included a Navy Section which came to integrate the initial aircraft of the Portuguese Navy. The school would be latter became fully part of the Army and be transferred to Sintra. *\\"Admiral Gago Coutinho\\" Naval Aviation School (Escola de Aviação Naval \\"Almirante Gago Coutinho\\"): activated in 1928 to allow the complete training of the Naval Aviation personnel, which instruction was, until then, partially done in foreign aviation schools. It was installed at the Aveiro Naval Air Station facilities until 1952. *B Squadron of the Navy Air Forces (Esquadrilha B das Forças Aéreas da Armada): shore based naval attack bomber unit, initially equipped with Bristol Blenheim bombers and then with Bristol Beaufighter torpedo bombers, activated in 1942 and deactivated in 1949. Although dependent from the Lisbon Naval Air Station, it was permanently deployed at the Lisbon Airport.

This organization was marked by differences with Catholic Scouting groups such as the Movimiento Scout Católico that, under the shelter of the Catholic church (generally at the parish-level) also maintained activity during this period. Scouts de España versus Scouts Católicos Between the movements existed a fundamental confessional difference, which also induced differences in the growth and financing of the groups. The Scouts de España were locally organized and self-managed, whereas the Catholics were generally parochially organized and managed. Other differences existed in the Scout ideals, the Catholic Scout Motto was \\"Always Alert\\", whereas the Scouts de España were \\"Always Ready\\", etc. Social acceptance Both movements always enjoyed support of the population, and although officially dissolved, the Scout movements were given tacit permission to maintain activities until the present era and the later resurgence of Scouting in Spain after 1977. Authorities showed ample general tolerance with the movement in spite of the de jure illegality of their situation. Program and ideals The national emblem of the Scouts de España was the fleur-de-lis formed in the shape of a Cross of Saint James. The text of the Scout Promise that-after surpassing the corresponding tests for an aspiring tenderfoot to become a Scout, was: Prometo por mi honor, y con la ayuda de Dios, hacer cuanto de mí dependa para cumplir mis deberes para con Dios y la Patria, ayudar a mi prójimo en toda circunstancia y cumplir fielmente la Ley Scout. I promise on my honor, and with the aid of God, to do whatever depends on me to fulfill my duties towards God and the Mother country, to help to my fellows in all circumstances and to faithfully obey the Scout Law.

Aalst Louis Roelandt or Lodewijk Joseph Adriaan Roelandt with his full Dutch name, was a Belgian architect that played an important role in the evolution of Neo-Renaissance and Neo-Classical architecture in Belgium. During the period that Belgium belonged to the First French Empire, Roelandt, who had studied at the Académie of Ghent, was selected to continue his education at the prestigious \\"Ecole Spéciale d'Architecture\\" in Paris. Like his compatriot Tilman-François Suys he was a pupil of Charles Percier and Pierre François Léonard Fontaine. In 1818 he was appointed as architect to the city of Ghent where he would realise the majority of his future projects. Gradually Roelandt moved away from the severe Empire Style in which he had been trained, and introduced more and more Neo-Renaissance and Neo-Baroque features into his designs. He also built churches in an early Gothic Revival style, such as the Sint-Annakerk in Ghent. Among his most famous students were Louis Delacenserie and Louis van Overstraeten. The daughter Adèle Sylvie of Lodewijk Roelandt was married to Joseph Geefs, the daughter Mathilde-Jeanne to Louis Van Overstraeten.

He served as Mayor of Trois-Rivières and as Member of the Legislative Assembly. He was the father of Premier Maurice Duplessis. Early life He was born in 1855 in Yamachiche, Mauricie. He was an attorney. Provincial politics In 1886, Duplessis, who was a Conservative, became the Member of the Legislative Assembly for the district of Saint-Maurice. He was succeeding law practice partner François-Sévère Lesieur Desaulniers, who was moving to federal politics. Despite a landslide victory of Honoré Mercier's Parti National in 1890, he and his Conservative colleagues from the Mauricie area were re-elected. He was re-elected again in 1892 as the Conservative Party won a majority. The Liberals won the 1896 federal election and the 1897 provincial election. They would dominate Quebec politics for decades. Duplessis temporarily survived the new political context, but was ultimately defeated by Liberal Louis-Philippe Fiset in 1900. Under Duplessis's tenure, many Mauricie villages were established, including Saint-Jacques-des-Piles in 1885, Saint-Joseph-de-Mékinac in 1888 and Lac-à-la- Tortue in 1895. Municipal politics Duplessis was Mayor of Trois-Rivières from 1904 to 1905. Later life Duplessis was appointed judge in 1914. He died in Montreal in 1926.

It won the 2001 Hammett Prize. Plot summary The story is set in Europe between April 1938 and July 1939, a time of ever-increasing fear and apprehension throughout the continent. Nicholas Morath is an expatriate Hungarian in his forties and the co-owner of an advertising agency in Paris. His uncle, Count Janos Polanyi, is a high-level functionary at the Hungarian embassy in France. Morath is in fact an amateur spy, sent on one dangerous mission after another at his uncle's behest (laundering money through the Antwerp diamond industry, or spending a week in a Romanian jail, for example). Polanyi tells his nephew little about the reasons for or the results of these excursions, and friction often rises between the two men. But after Polanyi disappears mysteriously, Morath continues his perilous work alone. Characters Count Janos Polanyi is an elderly Hungarian aristocrat and a career diplomat. He seems to be a cynical, urbane gentleman who appreciates all the pleasures Paris has to offer. He is in fact guided by two secret convictions: a belief than men like himself did too little to prevent the First World War and a determination to prevent Hitler and his minions from taking over Hungary. Nicholas Morath is a combat veteran of the First World War, has resided in Paris for almost twenty years, and appears to live the life of a successful business executive and man about town. But like his uncle, he considers himself to be a member of \\"the Hungarian Race\\", an aristocracy committed to the old knightly ideals even in an age when castles and titles are a thing of the past. His intimidating looks belie a warm, generous nature that few people can see. Cara Dionello is Morath's lover in the first part of the book. A shallow young Argentine heiress living in Paris on her father's money, she prefers not to notice Morath's frequent absences unless they interfere with her good time. Cara provides comic relief and is clearly the latest of a series of similar women in Morath's life. Mary Day is a copy editor at Morath's ad agency. She is a thoughtful and perceptive women who is drawn to Morath's less obvious qualities, and the two grow very close in the later stages of the story. She writes \\"naughty\\" novels under a pen name for Obelisk Press, and thus has a secret life of her own. Colonel Sombor is a security officer at the Hungarian embassy and a member of Hungary's Fascist element. He takes a malevolent interest in Polanyi, Morath, and their activities. A final confrontation between him and Polanyi ends nastily. Boris Balki is a Russian bartender with underworld connections, Herbert Mitten is a Romanian Jew and a struggling actor, and Wolfi Szubl is a travelling lingerie salesman of uncertain origin. All are expatriates like Morath who assist him on his missions. Themes Travel \\"Maybe the Belgian border guards didn't care who came and went, but the French customs inspectors did.\\" Furst (a seasoned travel writer) uses travel and its related experiences to vividly depict the Europe his characters live in. Morath journeys across the continent by train frequently and sees a world of suspicious border guards, desperate passengers with the wrong papers, and tenuous luxury surrounded by encroaching violence and squalor. A random brick thrown through a compartment window symbolizes the collapse of yet another country. Paris, the adopted home Morath returns to time and again, is for him the endangered symbol of an older and more decent way of life. Honor and Obligation \\"'I'm just a fat old Hungarian man, Nicholas. I can't save the world. I'd like to, but I can't.'\\" Like many veterans of World War I, Nicholas Morath believes that he squandered his youth in a meaningless and senseless conflict that knocked the world off its hinges. He views the prospect of another war with numb horror. But he and his uncle have a special cross of their own to bear, for they are among the scattered survivors of the old European upper class that failed to prevent the earlier war. A new evil is now engulfing Europe, and an unspoken obligation to fight it hangs over both of them. Love and Redemption \\"'You are really very good, Nicholas,' she said. 'Really you are.'\\" Love (as in many works of literature) is presented here as one of the highest human aspirations, something that can energize a spirit and set it free. Morath lives for many years in a twilight world of secrets and danger, and seems to take solace in a series of easy women who ask no questions about the things that matter to him. By forging a relationship with someone who demands to know what is truly important to him (Mary Day), he finds his soul mate even as their physical world crumbles around them.

Their influences range from folk to indie rock to post rock with this diversity creating a large number of followers, including BBC Radio One DJs Steve Lamacq, Zane Lowe and Huw Stephens. The band took its unusual name from George Dangerfield's 1935 book of the same name, about the early 20th century decline of the Liberal Party. History Forming in 2005 the five piece band began life with mainly instrumental songs, however as they grew as a band lyrics began to appear in their songs. Their music was often compared to the likes of Arcade Fire and the early work of Pixies, although as they began to form their own following they broke away from these comparisons and began to form their own path. As well as a self-produced and distributed EP, Stop/Go Happy/Sad Forward/Forward (2005), The Strange Death of Liberal England have released two singles and one \\"mini-album\\". The first single titled \\"A Day Another Day\\" was released by Fantastic Plastic early in 2007, it was greatly received by fans and music critics alike, with \\"Oh Solitude\\" following in June 2007. The band released their first \\"mini-album\\" called Forward March! on 9 July 2007 which has received high praise from many sources. \\"Mute Magic, 7/10\\" - NME, \\"quite possibly the best debut album you will leap yourself upon in 2007... 4.5/5\\" - gigwise.com, \\"7/10\\" - Drowned In Sound and more recently the 2008 single \\"Angelou\\" which includes the B-side \\"Scared to death\\" as well as \\"Angelou\\".

The band have also supported Manic Street Preachers during their 2007 tour.

Life Anushirvan was the second son of Lashkari ibn Musa, probably by his first wife, along with three other brothers. Lashkari ruled Arran for fifteen years in what is described by the Ottoman historian Münejjim Bashi as a troubled reign. When he died in 1049, Anushirvan succeeded him, but he was still underage, and real power lay with the chamberlain (hajib) Abu Mansur, who served as regent. The new regime was quickly opposed by a large faction among the populace. Münejjim Bashi, summarizing a now lost local chronicle, reports that this was because Abu Mansur immediately agreed to surrender several frontier fortresses to the Kakhetians, the Georgians and Byzantines, in order \\"to restrain their greed for Arran\\". This decision provoked the leading men to revolt under the leadership of al-Haytham ibn Maymun al-Bais, chief of the tanners in Shamkur. According to Vladimir Minorsky, this movement represented an uprising of the town notables against the senior bureaucratic caste. Abu Mansur, then residing at Shamkur, attempted to arrest al-Haytham, but al- Haytham and his ghilman (servants) \\"drew their daggers\\" and declared for Anushirvan's great-uncle Abu'l-Aswar, ruler of Dvin. Abu'l-Aswar occupied Shamkur, settled the troubled situation there, and went on to take up his residence in the capital, Ganja. He arrested Anushirvan, whose reign ended abruptly after two months, as well as Abu Mansur and his relations. Abu'l-Aswar's long reign (1049–67) would prove to be the zenith of the Shaddadids.

FDB partners with information system developers to deliver useful medication- and medical device-related information to clinicians, business associates, and patients. FDB is part of Hearst and the Hearst Health network. History First Databank was founded in 1977 as a company that published a quarterly magazine of drug prices. They were bought by Hearst Corporation in 1980. First Databank then evolved to become a provider of clinical and descriptive drug knowledge that is integrated into healthcare information systems globally. FDB has its headquarters in San Francisco, California, and has other offices in Indianapolis, Indiana, Exeter, England, Dubai, UAE and Hyderabad, India. The firm's drug databases support pharmacy dispensing, formulary management, drug pricing analysis, claims processing, computerized physician order entry (CPOE), electronic health records (EHR), electronic medical records (EMR), electronic prescribing (e-Prescribing), electronic medication administration records (EMAR), population health and telemedicine/telehealth. Beginning in 2011, First Databank's set of National Drug Codes (NDCs) have been integrated into RxNorm's standard clinical drug vocabulary that includes all medications available on the US market. RxNorm is produced and maintained by the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM). In 2017, FDB acquired Polygot Systems, which simplifies drug information for patients and translates that information into 21 languages. In 2018, FDB partnered with PetIQ to release the first veterinary medication database to provide information on pet medications structured for integration into pharmacy systems. Beginning in 2020, FDB partnered with Amazon and its Alexa devices to provide drug information and answer medication questions. During the COVID-19 pandemic, FDB posted drug data (regarding remdesivir, chloroquine, and hydroxychloroquine) and medical device-related coronavirus information to its website. Operations =FDB MedKnowledge (formerly National Drug Data File Plus)= First Databank's MedKnowledge provides prices, descriptions, and collateral clinical information on drugs approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), plus unapproved drugs, commonly used over-the-counter drugs, herbal remedies, medical foods and nutritional supplements. =FDB OrderKnowledge (formerly OrderView Med Knowledge Base)= First Databank has developed a drug ordering knowledge base that enables physicians to look up and order drugs. Drug orders are generated based on patient parameters such as age, weight, renal and hepatic impairment, thereby reducing lists of candidate drugs to a minimum. The database is expected to affect the number of adverse drug reactions and side effects at facilities that have adopted the electronic order entry systems. =FDB AlertSpace= A web-based software tool that enables institution-specific modification of medication alerts using FDB MedKnowledge clinical modules based on clinician input, localized clinical experience, and other available evidence. The tool allows users to edit or turn off individual alerts, track all alert customizations and create an audit record, and view FDB updates in comparison with the user's own modifications. Users can load the results of their modifications directly into their medication decision support system for immediate use in the workflow. The approach follows the normal update process. =FDB Prizm= The FDB Prizm medical device database provides structured, categorized, and normalized information about medical device products that are implanted into patients; hospital and durable medical equipment; and medical supplies. The medical device content comes from a variety of sources such as the FDA, medical device manufacturers, and industry data pools. Also, it encompasses additional information from clinical, operational, and financial attributes and codes. Use of this database within supply chain and other information systems is designed to help decision makers to build and maintain device libraries, identify and document medical devices in case of recalls and adverse events, and group and analyze medical device utilization. =Meducation= Meducation comprises simplified medication instructions and medication regimen calendars using patient-specific information from the electronic health record (EHR). All material is written at a 5th to 8th grade reading level with supporting pictograms in more than 20 languages and is designed to help reduce medication errors and improve medication adherence for all patients. =FDB Targeted Medication Warnings= FDB Targeted Medication Warnings provides patient- specific clinical decision support (CDS) for medications and is integrated directly into the EHR workflow. This content uses lab results, risk scores, and other patient data to suggest clinical guidance that is most relevant to the patient context. The CDS derived from this solution provides specificity for clinical decisions and is linked to the related generic medication alerts which can be filtered out/customized using FDB AlertSpace. Litigation A consumer coalition filed separate suits in a Boston, Massachusetts federal court against drug wholesaler McKesson Corporation and First Databank, accusing the companies of artificially inflating drug prices. The lawsuits say that McKesson and FDB conspired from 2002 through 2005 to set the list prices artificially high. The suit against First DataBank accused it of limiting its survey of wholesalers to a single company, McKesson.SFGate.com - 'Unhealthy practices? Lawsuits say companies artificially boosted drug prices', Victoria Colliver, San Francisco Chronicle (December 12, 2006) First Databank agreed to a settlement, tentatively approved by the federal court, in which it would not pay damages to the plaintiffs, but agreed to reduce average wholesale prices (AWPs) listed in its databases by five percent for about 2,033 drugs. McKesson chose to fight the suits. The settlement required First DataBank (FDB) to reduce the AWP mark-up from 1.25 to 1.20 times the Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC) for 1,442 NDCs identified in the litigation. FDB set the mark-up at 1.20 for all drugs independent of the litigation on September 26, 2009. The roll back of the WAC-to-AWP spread led to a 4% reduction in their AWP. FDB also stopped publishing AWP data on September 26, 2011, two years after the rollback adjustments were implemented. First DataBank continues to publish non-AWP drug pricing information, including WAC, Direct Price, and suggested wholesale price.

During his rule over Dvin, he was mostly involved in the affairs of the Armenian principalities. He collaborated with the Byzantine Empire in its conquest of the last remnants of Bagratid Armenia in 1045, but when the Byzantines later turned on him, he survived three successive offensives that sought to take Ganja. In 1049, a revolt in Ganja overthrew his infant great- great-nephew, Anurshirvan. The rebels invited him to take up the family's emirate, and he moved from Dvin to Ganja. Under his rule, the Shaddadid dynasty reached its zenith. He undertook successful campaigns into Georgia and Shirvan, although the limits of Shaddadid power were exposed by his failure to take over the Emirate of Tiflis and by devastating raids by the Alans. At the same time, his reign witnessed the rapid rise of the Seljuk Empire and the extension of its control over the Transcaucasian principalities. Abu'l-Aswar became a Seljuk vassal in 1054/5. Although he gained control over the former Armenian capital of Ani through Seljuk patronage in 1065, this association also paved the way for the dynasty's decline after his death in November 1067.  Biography  = Origin = The main historical source on the Shaddadids is the work of the Ottoman historian Münejjim Bashi (died 1702). Münejjim Bashi considered the family to be of Kurdish origin, a view widely accepted by modern scholars. The family's founder, Muhammad ibn Shaddad, briefly seized control of Dvin in the early 950s. The family then moved to Ganja, the main Muslim town of Arran, which was seized by Muhammad's sons Lashkari (I), Marzuban, and Fadl (I) . The brothers successively ruled the city as emirs after that. Abu'l-Aswar Shavur was the second son of the youngest of the three brothers, and fourth Shaddadid ruler, Fadl. In his long reign (985–1031), Fadl expanded the family's control over much of Arran as well as parts of Armenia, capturing Syunik. Fadl was succeeded as emir at Ganja by his eldest son Musa () who was in turn murdered by his own son Abu'l-Hasan Lashkari (II) (). Abu'l-Aswar Shavur's name is an Arabic–Persian hybrid: \\"Shavur\\" is the old Persian name \\"Shapur\\", while his kunya contains the Arabicized form of the Iranian (possibly Daylamite) name \\"Asvar\\" (cognate with savar, \\"horseman, knight\\"). = Lord of Dvin (1022–49) = Political map of the Caucasus region Münejjim Bashi records that at the time of his death in 1067, Abu'l-Aswar's total reign, both in Ganja and before that \\"over some territories\\", had lasted 46 years. \\"Some territories\\" clearly refers to his rule over Dvin, known from other sources, meaning that he became ruler of the city in . The city, although part of the Bagratid Kingdom of Armenia, had been left defenceless after the death of Gagik I of Armenia in 1020 and the dispute of his sons over their inheritance, and suffered a devastating Daylamite raid in 1021 which effectively cut it off from the remainder of the Armenian kingdom. In the aftermath, the city appears to have sought the protection of the Shaddadids, and Abu'l-Aswar became its ruler. From this base, he pursued a virtually independent course from his brother, and later his nephew, in Ganja, focused more on Armenia than Arran. Abu'l-Aswar was intimately connected with the Armenian princely houses, having married a sister of David I Anhoghin, King of Tashir. His second son even bore the typically Armenian name of Ashot. Due to his focus on the affairs of his domain, he is not mentioned by Münejjim Bashi until his takeover of the main family seat at Ganja in 1049. For his activities in the period 1022–49, the main sources derive from his opponents, the Armenians and the Byzantines. Abu'l-Aswar is first recorded by the history of Matthew of Edessa in 1040, when the Armenian nobleman Abirat, who had become embroiled in the dispute between Gagik I's sons Ashot IV and Hovhannes- Smbat III, came to Dvin. Fearful of the latter's displeasure, Abirat with 12,000 horsemen sought Abu'l-Aswar's protection. Abu'l-Aswar initially welcomed Abirat and gave him a high position, but soon came to mistrust him, and had him killed, whereupon Abirat's lieutenant Sare departed for Ani with Abirat's supporters. Despite their kinship, at about the same time Abu'l-Aswar attacked David of Tashir. The Shaddadid army, numbering an impossible 150,000 according to Matthew of Edessa, captured much of Tashir, but David was able to assemble a broad alliance against Abu'l-Aswar. David himself fielded 10,000 troops, Hovhannes-Smbat III of Ani sent 3,000 men, the King of Kapan sent 2,000, and even the King of Georgia sent 4,000, while David also secured the public backing of the Catholicos of Albania. As a result, Abu'l-Aswar was defeated and evicted from Tashir. Ashot IV and Hovhannes-Smbat III died at almost the same time (), and Ashot's son Gagik II () succeeded them both and began consolidating his position. The chief danger to his throne was the Byzantine Empire, which throughout the early 11th century had been encroaching on the Armenian principalities. Hovhannes-Smbat had even bequeathed his kingdom to the Empire, and after his death, Emperor Michael IV the Paphlagonian () sent troops to capture Ani. Gagik managed to repel the attack, and political turmoil in Constantinople gained him a couple of years of reprieve after that, but in 1042 a new emperor, Constantine IX Monomachos (), came to the throne determined to secure Byzantine claims in Armenia. The defeat of the Byzantines before Dvin, miniature from the Madrid Skylitzes To this end, he contacted Abu'l-Aswar and called upon him to attack the Armenians from the rear. Abu'l-Aswar agreed, in exchange for guarantees that he would retain his conquests, a request granted in an imperial chrysobull. Faced with a two-pronged assault, Gagik was forced to visit Constantinople. There he was kept hostage and Ani was surrendered to the Byzantines in 1045. Notwithstanding his previous promises, immediately after taking possession of Ani, the emperor requested that Abu'l-Aswar vacate the fortresses he had conquered. When the latter refused, a large army under Michael Iasites and the magistros Constantine the Alan, containing numerous Armenians, marched against Dvin. Abu'l-Aswar let them approach, and then opened the irrigation canals and flooded the plain around the city. Stuck in the mud, the besiegers were easy prey for the Shaddadid archers, who inflicted huge casualties on the Byzantine force. Constantine IX responded by placing Katakalon Kekaumenos and the parakoimomenos Constantine in charge of Armenia. Instead of attacking Dvin, however, the new Byzantine leadership concentrated its efforts on recovering the forts captured by Abu'l-Aswar. Surmari, Anberd, and Khor Virap fell to the Byzantine army, but Chelidonion (modern Yerevan) resisted until September 1047, when the outbreak of a rebellion led by Leo Tornikios forced the army's recall to Constantinople. A peace treaty was hastily concluded, whereby Abu'l-Aswar agreed not to raid Byzantine territory and to recognize the authority of the emperor. The successful resistance of Dvin put an end to the Byzantine advance in Armenia, helping preserve the independence of the smaller Armenian realms of Syunik, Tashir and Khachen. Soon after, the regional balance of power was permanently altered with the first large-scale raid of the Seljuk Turks under Qutlumush ibn Arslan Isra'il and Ibrahim Inal into Byzantine Armenia in 1048. While the Shaddadids may have been tempted to see in them welcome allies against the Byzantines, they were equally likely to be a threat, as demonstrated by the attack on Ganja by Qutlumush in 1046/47. Shortly after, in late 1048 or early 1049—although some authors have suggested a later date, (A.F. Gfrörer and M.H. Yinanç) or even (E. Honigmann)—the Byzantines launched another offensive against Dvin under the rhaiktor Nikephoros. According to the contemporary Byzantine historian John Skylitzes, this was because Abu'l-Aswar (\\"Aplesphares\\", as the Byzantines called him) had violated the previous agreement and raided Byzantine lands. The Shaddadid ruler remained ensconced in Dvin, while the Byzantines devastated its environs \\"as far as the Iron Bridge and Ganja\\", forcing Abu'l-Aswar to renew his previous oath of subservience and hand over his great-nephew Ardashir, the son of Abu'l-Hasan Lashkari, as a hostage. = Emir of Ganja (1049–67) = In 1049, Abu'l-Aswar's nephew Lashkari, the emir of Ganja, died, after a troubled reign of 15 years. He was succeeded by his infant son Anushirvan, but actual power was in the hands of his chamberlain (hajib), Abu Mansur. After barely two months, a group of elders opposed to the new regime's policies deposed Abu Mansur while he was at Shamkur and called upon Abu'l-Aswar to assume control of Ganja as well. Abu'l-Aswar agreed and abandoned Dvin, which had become too exposed to the Byzantines. The city was left in the hands of a series of governors until 1053, when he appointed his son Abu Nasr Iskandar as ruler of the city and the surrounding regions. The Shaddadid ruler first set things in order in Shamkur, and then entered Ganja, taking possession \\"all the lands of Arran and its fortresses\\". At this point in his career, Abu'l-Aswar had achieved a considerable reputation as a ruler and a warrior; the Ziyarid prince Keikavus (), who later wrote a well-known mirror for princes, the Qabusnameh, even came to Ganja and spent several years at the Shaddadid court to participate in the jihad against the Christians, after having spent eight years at the court of Maw'dud of Ghazni. According to Keikavus, his host was \\"a great king, a man firm and clever, [...] just, courageous, eloquent dialectician, of pure faith and far-sighted\\". This estimate was shared by the Byzantines, for Skylitzes likewise calls him \\"as clever a strategist as anybody else, capable of thwarting the enemies' tactics and policies\\", while Münejjim Bashi writes that after his takeover of Ganja, \\"Abu'l-Aswar [...] restored the name of the dynasty to life after it had nearly died out. He became strong and the situation of the subjects and the army became orderly.\\" The gates of Ganja, installed under Abu'l-Aswar's orders in 1062, now at the Gelati Monastery in Georgia According to Münejjim Bashi, in 1053, Abu'l-Aswar seized the (unidentified) fortress of Basra from the Georgians, and refortified and garrisoned it with many men. In 1054/5, along with many of the neighbouring rulers, he became a vassal of the Seljuk Sultan Toghrul Beg (), although at least initially the impact of Seljuk overlordship seems to have been light, as neither Toghrul nor his successor Alp Arslan () appeared on Shaddadid coinage at this time. In 1062, Abu'l-Aswar received a delegation from the Emirate of Tiflis, an isolated Muslim stronghold within the Christian Georgian kingdoms. Following the death of Emir Ja'far ibn Ali, the locals had evicted his quarrelling sons, and now asked Abu'l-Aswar to assume control of the city. The Shaddadid ruler was inclined to accept, but his vizier, Bakhtiyar ibn Salman, dissuaded him by warning that such an action would disperse his limited forces. After Abu'l-Aswar's refusal, Tiflis was occupied by the Georgians, until they were evicted by Alp Arslan in 1068. This event highlighted the limitations of Shaddadid power, which was further demonstrated by an Alan invasion through the Darial Pass in the same year: more than 20,000 inhabitants of Arran were carried off as slaves according to Münejjim Bashi's account. In response to the Alan threat, Abu'l-Aswar built a wall and moat around the suburb (rabad) of his capital Ganja. The gates installed by Abu'l-Aswar for this new fortification were carried off by the Georgians under Demetrius I in 1139, and are still preserved at the Gelati Monastery in modern Georgia. In 2012–14, replicas of the original gates were installed in Ganja's Museum of Archaeology and Ethnography. At the same time, Abu'l-Aswar's relations with his neighbour, Shirvanshah Fariburz I (), abruptly deteriorated. The two dynasties were linked by family ties—Fariburz's predecessor, Sallar (), had even been married to a daughter of Abu'l-Aswar—but now the Shaddadid ruler launched a series of invasions against Shirvan. In spring 1063, Abu'l-Aswar captured the Quylamiyan castle, marched on to the capital of Shirvan, Shamakhi, defeated the Shirvanshah's forces in battle, plundered their camp, and captured his own daughter, her treasure and retinue. He then withdrew to Arran, but in July returned to Shirvan to raid it. In the next year, he again invaded Shirvan and captured a number of fortresses, while the local Kurdish tribes went over to him. After his return to Ganja, a peace treaty was signed with the Shirvanshah in June/July 1064, whereby Abu'l-Aswar returned Quylamiyan in exchange for 40,000 gold dinars. In 1064, the Seljuk sultan Alp Arslan invaded Byzantine Armenia and took Ani. Abu'l-Aswar himself led raids into the area, capturing the unidentified fortress of Wyjyn (\\"one of the best in Armenia\\" according to Münejjim Bashi). Münejjim Bashi further records that Alp Arslan handed over control of Ani to him; Ibn al-Athir reports the transfer to an unnamed emir, while Vardan Areveltsi records that the fortress was granted only to Abu'l-Aswar's son and successor, Fadl. Immediately after his return to Ganja and the dispersal of his army, however, the Alans again crossed the Darial Pass in October 1065, and, allied with the inhabitants of Shakki, raided Arran. At Shamkur they killed more than 200 volunteers for the jihad, and raided even to the very gates of Ganja itself, before moving on to raid the environs of Barda'a. Abu'l-Aswar and his troops preferred to remain within the protection of the walled cities rather than face the raiders in the field, and the Alans reached all the way to the Araxes before turning back north, along with the prisoners they had taken. Abu'l-Aswar died on 19 November 1067, and was buried at the main mosque of Ganja. He was succeeded by his eldest son, Fadl II, whom he had already announced as his heir, and to whom the oath of allegiance (bay'ah) had been taken by the Shaddadid family, the army and the people of Arran. Apart from Fadl, Abu'l-Aswar had four more sons—Ashot, Iskandar, Manuchihr, and Marzuban—as well as an unnamed daughter, wife of the Shirvanshah Sallar. Abu'l-Aswar's reign represented the zenith of the Shaddadid dynasty, but their fall began almost immediately after his death: the Seljuks strengthened their grip on Arran and the other principalities of the region, and Alp Arslan visited Ganja in person to extract an enormous tribute. Fadl II's reign was troubled—at one point he was captured and held by the Georgians for eight months—but he managed to capture Derbent. Fadl II was overthrown by his son Fadlun (Fadl III) in 1073, who was in turn deposed in 1075 by the Turkish ghulam Sav Tegin, to whom the Seljuks had assigned control of Arran and Derbent. This ended the family's rule over Arran, but a junior line, led by Abu'l-Aswar's third son Manuchihr, continued to govern Ani as emirs, initially as Seljuk, and later as Georgian, vassals. This last branch of the Shaddadids maintained a precarious independence until the end of their dynasty in .

L. (2002) Insect Physiology and Biochemistry. CRC Press. Although diverse, insects are quite similar in overall design, internally and externally. The insect is made up of three main body regions (tagmata), the head, thorax and abdomen. The head comprises six fused segments with compound eyes, ocelli, antennae and mouthparts, which differ according to the insect's particular diet, e.g. grinding, sucking, lapping and chewing. The thorax is made up of three segments: the pro, meso and meta thorax, each supporting a pair of legs which may also differ, depending on function, e.g. jumping, digging, swimming and running. Usually the middle and the last segment of the thorax have paired wings. The abdomen generally comprises eleven segments and contains the digestive and reproductive organs. A general overview of the internal structure and physiology of the insect is presented, including digestive, circulatory, respiratory, muscular, endocrine and nervous systems, as well as sensory organs, temperature control, flight and molting.  Digestive system  An insect uses its digestive system to extract nutrients and other substances from the food it consumes. Most of this food is ingested in the form of macromolecules and other complex substances (such as proteins, polysaccharides, fats, and nucleic acids) which must be broken down by catabolic reactions into smaller molecules (i.e. amino acids, simple sugars, etc.) before being used by cells of the body for energy, growth, or reproduction. This break-down process is known as digestion. The insect's digestive system is a closed system, with one long enclosed coiled tube called the alimentary canal which runs lengthwise through the body. The alimentary canal only allows food to enter the mouth, and then gets processed as it travels toward the anus. The alimentary canal has specific sections for grinding and food storage, enzyme production, and nutrient absorption. Sphincters control the food and fluid movement between three regions. The three regions include the foregut (stomatodeum)(27,) the midgut (mesenteron)(13), and the hindgut (proctodeum)(16). In addition to the alimentary canal, insects also have paired salivary glands and salivary reservoirs. These structures usually reside in the thorax (adjacent to the fore-gut). The salivary glands (30) produce saliva; the salivary ducts lead from the glands to the reservoirs and then forward through the head to an opening called the salivarium behind the hypopharynx; which movements of the mouthparts help mix saliva with food in the buccal cavity. Saliva mixes with food, which travels through salivary tubes into the mouth, beginning the process of breaking it down. The stomatedeum and proctodeum are invaginations of the epidermis and are lined with cuticle (intima). The mesenteron is not lined with cuticle but with rapidly dividing and therefore constantly replaced, epithelial cells. The cuticle sheds with every moult along with the exoskeleton. Food is moved down the gut by muscular contractions called peristalsis. Stylised diagram of insect digestive tract showing Malpighian tubule (Orthopteran type) # Stomatodeum (foregut): This region stores, grinds and transports food to the next region. Included in this are the buccal cavity, the pharynx, the oesophagus, the crop (stores food), and proventriculus or gizzard (grinds food). Salivary secretions from the labial glands dilute the ingested food. In mosquitoes (Diptera), which are blood- feeding insects, anticoagulants and blood thinners are also released here. # Mesenteron (midgut): Digestive enzymes in this region are produced and secreted into the lumen and here nutrients are absorbed into the insect's body. Food is enveloped by this part of the gut as it arrives from the foregut by the peritrophic membrane which is a mucopolysaccharide layer secreted from the midgut's epithelial cells. It is thought that this membrane prevents food pathogens from contacting the epithelium and attacking the insects' body. It also acts as a filter allowing small molecules through, but preventing large molecules and particles of food from reaching the midgut cells. After the large substances are broken down into smaller ones, digestion and consequent nutrient absorption takes place at the surface of the epithelium. Microscopic projections from the mid-gut wall, called microvilli, increase surface area and allow for maximum absorption of nutrients. # Proctodeum (hindgut): This is divided into three sections; the anterior is the ileum, the middle portion, the colon, and the wider, posterior section is the rectum. This extends from the pyloric valve which is located between the mid and the hindgut to the anus. Here absorption of water, salts and other beneficial substances take place before excretion. Like other animals, the removal of toxic metabolic waste requires water. However, for very small animals like insects, water conservation is a priority. Because of this, blind-ended ducts called Malpighian tubules come into play. These ducts emerge as evaginations at the anterior end of the hindgut and are the main organs of osmoregulation and excretion. These extract the waste products from the haemolymph, in which all the internal organs are bathed). These tubules continually produce the insect's uric acid, which is transported to the hindgut, where important salts and water are re-absorbed by both the hindgut and rectum. Excrement is then voided as insoluble and non-toxic uric acid granules. Excretion and osmoregulation in insects are not orchestrated by the Malpighian tubules alone, but require a joint function of the ileum and/or rectum.  Circulatory system  The main function of insect blood, hemolymph, is that of transport and it bathes the insect's body organs. Making up usually less than 25% of an insect's body weight, it transports hormones, nutrients and wastes and has a role in osmoregulation, temperature control, immunity, storage (water, carbohydrates and fats) and skeletal function. It also plays an essential part in the moulting process. An additional role of the hemolymph in some orders, can be that of predatory defence. It can contain unpalatable and malodourous chemicals that will act as a deterrent to predators. Hemolymph contains molecules, ions and cells. Regulating chemical exchanges between tissues, hemolymph is encased in the insect body cavity or haemocoel. It is transported around the body by combined heart (posterior) and aorta (anterior) pulsations which are located dorsally just under the surface of the body. It differs from vertebrate blood in that it doesn't contain any red blood cells and therefore is without high oxygen carrying capacity, and is more similar to lymph found in vertebrates. Body fluids enter through one way valved ostia which are openings situated along the length of the combined aorta and heart organ. Pumping of the hemolymph occurs by waves of peristaltic contraction, originating at the body's posterior end, pumping forwards into the dorsal vessel, out via the aorta and then into the head where it flows out into the haemocoel. The hemolymph is circulated to the appendages unidirectionally with the aid of muscular pumps or accessory pulsatile organs which are usually found at the base of the antennae or wings and sometimes in the legs. Pumping rate accelerates due to periods of increased activity. Movement of hemolymph is particularly important for thermoregulation in orders such as Odonata, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and Diptera.  Respiratory system  Insect respiration is accomplished without lungs using a system of internal tubes and sacs through which gases either diffuse or are actively pumped, delivering oxygen directly to tissues that need oxygen and eliminate carbon dioxide via their cells. Since oxygen is delivered directly, the circulatory system is not used to carry oxygen, and is therefore greatly reduced; it has no closed vessels (i.e., no veins or arteries), consisting of little more than a single, perforated dorsal tube which pulses peristaltically, and in doing so helps circulate the hemolymph inside the body cavity. Air is taken in through spiracles, openings which are positioned laterally in the pleural wall, usually a pair on the anterior margin of the meso and meta thorax, and pairs on each of the eight or less abdominal segments, Numbers of spiracles vary from 1 to 10 pairs. The oxygen passes through the tracheae to the tracheoles, and enters the body by the process of diffusion. Carbon dioxide leaves the body by the same process. The major tracheae are thickened spirally like a flexible vacuum hose to prevent them from collapsing and often swell into air sacs. Larger insects can augment the flow of air through their tracheal system, with body movement and rhythmic flattening of the tracheal air sacs. Spiracles are closed and opened by means of valves and can remain partly or completely closed for extended periods in some insects, which minimises water loss. There are many different patterns of gas exchange demonstrated by different groups of insects. Gas exchange patterns in insects can range from continuous, diffusive ventilation, to discontinuous gas exchange. Terrestrial and a large proportion of aquatic insects perform gaseous exchange as previously mentioned under an open system. Other smaller numbers of aquatic insects have a closed tracheal system, for example, Odonata, Trichoptera, Ephemeroptera, which have tracheal gills and no functional spiracles. Endoparasitic larvae are without spiracles and also operate under a closed system. Here the tracheae separate peripherally, covering the general body surface which results in a cutaneous form of gaseous exchange. This peripheral tracheal division may also lie within the tracheal gills where gaseous exchange may also take place.  Muscular system  Many insects are able to lift twenty times their own body weight like Rhinoceros beetle and may jump distances that are many times greater than their own length. This is because their energy output is high in relation to their body mass. The muscular system of insects ranges from a few hundred muscles to a few thousand. Unlike vertebrates that have both smooth and striated muscles, insects have only striated muscles. Muscle cells are amassed into muscle fibers and then into the functional unit, the muscle. Muscles are attached to the body wall, with attachment fibers running through the cuticle and to the epicuticle, where they can move different parts of the body including appendages such as wings. The muscle fiber has many cells with a plasma membrane and outer sheath or sarcolemma. The sarcolemma is invaginated and can make contact with the tracheole carrying oxygen to the muscle fiber. Arranged in sheets or cylindrically, contractile myofibrils run the length of the muscle fiber. Myofibrils comprising a fine actin filament enclosed between a thick pair of myosin filaments slide past each other instigated by nerve impulses. Muscles can be divided into four categories: #Visceral: these muscles surround the tubes and ducts and produce peristalsis as demonstrated in the digestive system. #Segmental: causing telescoping of muscle segments required for moulting, increase in body pressure and locomotion in legless larvae. #Appendicular: originating from either the sternum or the tergum and inserted on the coxae these muscles move appendages as one unit. These are arranged segmentally and usually in antagonistic pairs. Appendage parts of some insects, e.g. the galea and the lacinia of the maxillae, only have flexor muscles. Extension of these structures is by haemolymph pressure and cuticle elasticity. #Flight: Flight muscles are the most specialised category of muscle and are capable of rapid contractions. Nerve impulses are required to initiate muscle contractions and therefore flight. These muscles are also known as neurogenic or synchronous muscles. This is because there is a one-to- one correspondence between action potentials and muscle contractions. In insects with higher wing stroke frequencies the muscles contract more frequently than at the rate that the nerve impulse reaches them and are known as asynchronous muscles. Flight has allowed the insect to disperse, escape from enemies and environmental harm, and colonise new habitats. One of the insect's key adaptations is flight, the mechanics of which differ from those of other flying animals because their wings are not modified appendages. Fully developed and functional wings occur only in adult insects. To fly, gravity and drag (air resistance to movement) have to be overcome. Most insects fly by beating their wings and to power their flight they have either direct flight muscles attached to the wings, or an indirect system where there is no muscle- to-wing connection and instead they are attached to a highly flexible box-like thorax. Direct flight muscles generate the upward stroke by the contraction of the muscles attached to the base of the wing inside the pivotal point. Outside the pivotal point the downward stroke is generated through contraction of muscles that extend from the sternum to the wing. Indirect flight muscles are attached to the tergum and sternum. Contraction makes the tergum and base of the wing pull down. In turn this movement lever the outer or main part of the wing in strokes upward. Contraction of the second set of muscles, which run from the back to the front of the thorax, powers the downbeat. This deforms the box and lifts the tergum.  Endocrine system  Hormones are the chemical substances that are transported in the insect's body fluids (haemolymph) that carry messages away from their point of synthesis to sites where physiological processes are influenced. These hormones are produced by glandular, neuroglandular and neuronal centres. Insects have several organs that produce hormones, controlling reproduction, metamorphosis and moulting. It has been suggested that a brain hormone is responsible for caste dermination in termites and diapause interruption in some insects. Four endocrine centers have been identified: #Neurosecretory cells in the brain can produce one or more hormones that affect growth, reproduction, homeostasis and metamorphosis. #Corpora cardiaca are a pair of neuroglandular bodies that are found behind the brain and on either sides of the aorta. These not only produce their own neurohormones but they store and release other neurohormones including PTTH prothoracicotropic hormone (brain hormone), which stimulates the secretory activity of the prothoracic glands, playing an integral role in moulting. #Prothoracic glands are diffuse, paired glands located at the back of the head or in the thorax. These glands secrete an ecdysteroid called ecdysone, or the moulting hormone, which initiates the epidermal moulting process. Additionally it plays a role in accessory reproductive glands in the female, differentiation of ovarioles and in the process of egg production. #Corpora allata are small, paired glandular bodies originating from the epithelium located on either side of the foregut. They secrete the juvenile hormone, which regulate reproduction and metamorphosis.  Nervous system  Insects have a complex nervous system which incorporates a variety of internal physiological information as well as external sensory information. As in the case of vertebrates, the basic component is the neuron or nerve cell. This is made up of a dendrite with two projections that receive stimuli and an axon, which transmits information to another neuron or organ, like a muscle. As with vertebrates, chemicals (neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine and dopamine) are released at synapses. =Central nervous system= An insect's sensory, motor and physiological processes are controlled by the central nervous system along with the endocrine system. Being the principal division of the nervous system, it consists of a brain, a ventral nerve cord and a subesophageal ganglion which is connected to the brain by two nerves, extending around each side of the oesophagus. The brain has three lobes: *Protocerebrum, innervating the compound eyes and the ocelli *Deutocerebrum, innervating the antennae *Tritocerebrum, innervating the foregut and the labrum. The ventral nerve cord extends from the suboesophageal ganglion posteriorly. A layer of connective tissue called the neurolemma covers the brain, ganglia, major peripheral nerves and ventral nerve cords. The head capsule (made up of six fused segments) has six pairs of ganglia. The first three pairs are fused into the brain, while the three following pairs are fused into the subesophageal ganglion. The thoracic segments have one ganglion on each side, which are connected into a pair, one pair per segment. This arrangement is also seen in the abdomen but only in the first eight segments. Many species of insects have reduced numbers of ganglia due to fusion or reduction. Some cockroaches have just six ganglia in the abdomen, whereas the wasp Vespa crabro has only two in the thorax and three in the abdomen. And some, like the house fly Musca domestica, have all the body ganglia fused into a single large thoracic ganglion. The ganglia of the central nervous system act as the coordinating centres with their own specific autonomy where each may coordinate impulses in specified regions of the insect's body. =Peripheral nervous system= This consists of motor neuron axons that branch out to the muscles from the ganglia of the central nervous system, parts of the sympathetic nervous system and the sensory neurons of the cuticular sense organs that receive chemical, thermal, mechanical or visual stimuli from the insects environment. The sympathetic nervous system includes nerves and the ganglia that innervate the gut both posteriorly and anteriorly, some endocrine organs, the spiracles of the tracheal system and the reproductive organs. =Sensory organs= Chemical senses include the use of chemoreceptors, related to taste and smell, affecting mating, habitat selection, feeding and parasite-host relationships. Taste is usually located on the mouthparts of the insect but in some insects, such as bees, wasps and ants, taste organs can also be found on the antennae. Taste organs can also be found on the tarsi of moths, butterflies and flies. Olfactory sensilla enable insects to smell and are usually found in the antennae. Chemoreceptor sensitivity related to smell in some substances, is very high and some insects can detect particular odours that are at low concentrations miles from their original source. Mechanical senses provide the insect with information that may direct orientation, general movement, flight from enemies, reproduction and feeding and are elicited from the sense organs that are sensitive to mechanical stimuli such as pressure, touch and vibration. Hairs (setae) on the cuticle are responsible for this as they are sensitive to vibration touch and sound. Hearing structures or tympanal organs are located on different body parts such as, wings, abdomen, legs and antennae. These can respond to various frequencies ranging from 100 Hz to 240 kHz depending on insect species. Many of the joints of the insect have tactile setae that register movement. Hair beds and groups of small hair like sensilla, determine proprioreception or information about the position of a limb, and are found on the cuticle at the joints of segments and legs. Pressure on the body wall or strain gauges are detected by the campiniform sensilla and internal stretch receptors sense muscle distension and digestive system stretching. The compound eye and the ocelli supply insect vision. The compound eye consists of individual light receptive units called ommatidia. Some ants may have only one or two, however dragonflies may have over 10,000. The more ommatidia the greater the visual acuity. These units have a clear lens system and light sensitive retina cells. By day, the image flying insects receive is made up of a mosaic of specks of differing light intensity from all the different ommatidia. At night or dusk, visual acuity is sacrificed for light sensitivity. The ocelli are unable to form focused images but are sensitive mainly, to differences in light intensity. Colour vision occurs in all orders of insects. Generally insects see better at the blue end of the spectrum than at the red end. In some orders sensitivity ranges can include ultraviolet. A number of insects have temperature and humidity sensors and insects being small, cool more quickly than larger animals. Insects are generally considered cold-blooded or ectothermic, their body temperature rising and falling with the environment. However, flying insects raise their body temperature through the action of flight, above environmental temperatures. The body temperature of butterflies and grasshoppers in flight may be 5 °C or 10 °C above environmental temperature, however moths and bumblebees, insulated by scales and hair, during flight, may raise flight muscle temperature 20–30 °C above the environment temperature. Most flying insects have to maintain their flight muscles above a certain temperature to gain power enough to fly. Shivering, or vibrating the wing muscles allow larger insects to actively increase the temperature of their flight muscles, enabling flight. Until very recently, no one had ever documented the presence of nociceptors (the cells that detect and transmit sensations of pain) in insects, though recent findings of nociception in larval fruit flies challenges this and raises the possibility that some insects may be capable of feeling pain.  Reproductive system  Most insects have a high reproductive rate. With a short generation time, they evolve faster and can adjust to environmental changes more rapidly than other slower breeding animals. Although there are many forms of reproductive organs in insects, there remains a basic design and function for each reproductive part. These individual parts may vary in shape (gonads), position (accessory gland attachment), and number (testicular and ovarian glands), with different insect groups. =Female= The female insect's main reproductive function is to produce eggs, including the egg's protective coating, and to store the male spermatozoa until egg fertilisation is ready. The female reproductive organs include paired ovaries which empty their eggs (oocytes) via the calyces into lateral oviducts, joining to form the common oviduct. The opening (gonopore) of the common oviduct is concealed in a cavity called the genital chamber and this serves as a copulatory pouch (bursa copulatrix) when mating. The external opening to this is the vulva. Often in insects the vulva is narrow and the genital chamber becomes pouch or tube like and is called the vagina. Related to the vagina is a saclike structure, the spermatheca, where spermatozoa are stored ready for egg fertilisation. A secretory gland nourishes the contained spermatozoa in the vagina. Egg development is mostly completed by the insect's adult stage and is controlled by hormones that control the initial stages of oogenesis and yolk deposition. Most insects are oviparous, where the young hatch after the eggs have been laid. Insect sexual reproduction starts with sperm entry that stimulates oogenesis, meiosis occurs and the egg moves down the genital tract. Accessory glands of the female secrete an adhesive substance to attach eggs to an object and they also supply material that provides the eggs with a protective coating. Oviposition takes place via the female ovipositor. =Male= The male's main reproductive function is to produce and store spermatozoa and provide transport to the reproductive tract of the female. Sperm development is usually completed by the time the insect reaches adulthood. The male has two testes, which contain follicles in which the spermatozoa are produced. These open separately into the sperm duct or vas deferens and this stores the sperm. The vas deferentia then unite posteriorally to form a central ejaculatory duct, this opens to the outside on an aedeagus or a penis. Accessory glands secrete fluids that comprise the spermatophore. This becomes a package that surrounds and carries the spermatozoa, forming a sperm-containing capsule. =Sexual and asexual reproduction= Most insects reproduce via sexual reproduction, i.e. the egg is produced by the female, fertilised by the male and oviposited by the female. Eggs are usually deposited in a precise microhabitat on or near the required food. However, some adult females can reproduce without male input. This is known as parthenogenesis and in the most common type of parthenogenesis the offspring are essentially identical to the mother. This is most often seen in aphids and scale insects.  Life cycle  An insect's life-cycle can be divided into three types: *Ametabolous, no metamorphosis, these insects are primitively wingless where the only difference between adult and nymph is size, e.g. order: Thysanura (silverfish). *Hemimetabolous, or incomplete metamorphosis. The terrestrial young are called nymphs and aquatic young are called naiads. Insect young are usually similar to the adult. Wings appear as buds on the nymphs or early instars. When the last moult is completed the wings expand to the full adult size, e.g. order: Odonata (dragonflies). *Holometabolus, or complete metamorphosis. These insects have a different form in their immature and adult stages, have different behaviours and live in different habitats. The immature form is called larvae and remains similar in form but increases in size. They usually have chewing mouthparts even if the adult form mouth parts suck. At the last larval instar phase the insect forms into a pupa, it doesn't feed and is inactive, and here wing development is initiated, and the adult emerges e.g. order: Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths).  Moulting  As an insect grows it needs to replace the rigid exoskeleton regularly. Moulting may occur up to three or four times or, in some insects, fifty times or more during its life. A complex process controlled by hormones, it includes the cuticle of the body wall, the cuticular lining of the tracheae, foregut, hindgut and endoskeletal structures. The stages of molting: #Apolysis—moulting hormones are released into the haemolymph and the old cuticle separates from the underlying epidermal cells. The epidermis increases in size due to mitosis and then the new cuticle is produced. Enzymes secreted by the epidermal cells digest the old endocuticle, not affecting the old sclerotised exocuticle. #Ecdysis—this begins with the splitting of the old cuticle, usually starting in the midline of the thorax's dorsal side. The rupturing force is mostly from haemolymph pressure that has been forced into thorax by abdominal muscle contractions caused by the insect swallowing air or water. After this the insect wriggles out of the old cuticle. #Sclerotisation—after emergence the new cuticle is soft and this a particularly vulnerable time for the insect as its hard protective coating is missing. After an hour or two the exocuticle hardens and darkens. The wings expand by the force of haemolymph into the wing veins.

He was transferred to Guantanamo on 26 March 2007. Abdulmalik is a confirmed member of the East Africa al-Qaeda network as well as a confirmed member of the Council of Islamic Courts and the Islamic Part of Kenya. He \\"actively participated\\" in the facilitation of weapons and the planning of terrorist acts against the U.S., according to the Joint Task Force (JTF) at Guantanamo Bay. He was recommended for continued detention under the Department of Defense's control. The JTF gave Abdulmalik a high risk threat against the United States' interests and allies. He has no reports of disciplinary infractions as of May 22, 2007, granting him a low detention risk value. Abdulmalik does, however, have a high intelligence value.United States. Joint Task Force. Guantanamo Files. 2011. Web. . According to Kenya's Daily Nation Abdulmalik was a protégé of Harun Fazul, described as \\"...the most wanted terror suspect in the region.\\" According to Kenya's Daily Nation: According to a British Broadcasting Corporation report from 4 May 2007 Abdulmalik Mohammed confessed, under interrogation, to a role in the 2002 bombing of the Paradise Hotel in Mombassa. According to the BBC report Abdulmalik Mohammed had been transferred to Guantanamo a month earlier. Questions from Salim Ahmed Hamdan's defense attorney On 23 April 2008 attorneys working on behalf of Salim Ahmed Hamdan requested permission to meet with Abdul Malik and Mustafa al-Hawsawi. Hamdan's attorneys had previously requested permission to get the \\"high-value detainees\\" to answer written questions, which would confirm that if Hamdan played a role in al Qaeda it had been a peripheral one. Abdul Malik and Mustafa al-Hawsawi declined to answer the questions, because they said they had no way to know that the questions purporting to be from Hamdan's attorneys was not a ruse. Andrea J. Prasow requested permission for Lieutenant Commander Brian Mizer to meet in person with the two men to try to assure them that the questions were not a ruse, and would not be shared with their interrogators. Combatant Status Review Tribunal Abdulmalik Mohamed has not had a Combatant Status Review Tribunal convened to confirm or refute whether he should be classed as an \\"enemy combatant\\". In an interview with the East Africa Standard Abdulmalik Mohamed's lawyer Clara Gutteridge described the difficulties Reprieve had first with meeting with him, and later to get their notes released after a security check. They were told that the meeting, and the release of notes, were not permitted until a captive had their Combatant Status Review Tribunal. But Guantanamo authorities failed to schedule his Combatant Status Review Tribunal In her interview Gutteridge speculated that the reason Abdulmalik Mohamed never had a Combatant Status Review Tribunal scheduled is that the USA had no evidence to justify his detention. She said he had been transferred to camp 4, the camp for the most privilege, most compliant captives, two months after his arrival in Guantanamo, and that FBI interrogators had told him they did not believe he belonged in Guantanamo, and there was an order in Washington for his release. Gutteridge said Reprieve successfully litigated to get access to Abdulmalik Mohamed in early 2008, but their notes had not been cleared, and they had not been allowed to talk about them until early October 2008. Gutteridge said that when Reprieve finally got access to Abdulmalik he informed them that he had been abused both when he was in Kenyan custody, and later in American custody. He informed them that he had been held in Bagram and Kabul, prior to his transfer to Guantanamo. Lawsuits The BBC reported on December 11, 2009 Abdul Malik's family is suing the Kenyan government over its role in his detention in Guantanamo. The BBC reports that his family have an affidavit from Kenyan police stating that they have no reason to suspect that he has any ties to terrorism. His first hearing is scheduled for 14 January 2010. The Associated Press reports that he has had a Combatant Status Review Tribunal, but that the United States Department of Defense has refused to make public a transcript as it has for all of the other captives. According to the Associated Press DoD spokesman Major Tanya Bradsher asserted that the transcript from his CSR Tribunal remained classified. The Associated Press quoted Cori Crider, of the human rights organization Reprieve, which has helped with his defense. Crider claimed that the allegations against him were all based on confession coerced through torture. Crider claimed that Kenyan interrogators had threatened to castrate him if he did not confess to the allegations leveled against him. Kenyan law allows the Police to hold suspects for 14 days, before they lay a charge. The lawsuit filed on Abdulmalik's behalf says police held him for longer than the 14 days the law allows, from February 13, 2007 to February 27, 2007, in addition to subjecting him to abusive interrogation techniques, and not letting him consult legal advice. Kenyan Police officials assert that he was held for less than 14 days, and that he was released—that they did not hand him over to US officials.

In April 2010 Reuters and the Associated Press reported that the Kenyan Foreign Ministry had written to Abdulmalik's lawyers, informing them that they had initiated the process of getting him repatriated. Joint Review Task Force When he assumed office in January 2009 President Barack Obama made a number of promises about the future of Guantanamo. He promised the use of torture would cease at the camp. He promised to institute a new review system. That new review system was composed of officials from six departments, where the OARDEC reviews were conducted entirely by the Department of Defense. When it reported back, a year later, the Joint Review Task Force classified some individuals as too dangerous to be transferred from Guantanamo, even though there was no evidence to justify laying charges against them. On April 9, 2013, that document was made public after a Freedom of Information Act request. Abdulmalik Mohammed was one of the 71 individuals deemed too innocent to charge, but too dangerous to release. Obama promised that those deemed too innocent to charge, but too dangerous to release would start to receive reviews from a Periodic Review Board. Mohammed was denied approval for transfer on June 9, 2016.http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation- world/world/americas/guantanamo/article83096432.html See also * Shaker Aamer References External links *Lawyer: Free Kenyan from 'black hole' Guantanamo *Kenya seeks return of citizen held at Gitmo *Kenya government sued over Guantanamo Bay detention *Guantanamo Detainee's Family Sues Kenya For $30 Million Category:Living people Category:Detainees of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp Category:Kenyan extrajudicial prisoners of the United States Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Abdulmalik Mohammed"},{"id":"12269075","text":"The 1985 CONCACAF Champions' Cup was the 21st edition of the annual international club football competition held in the CONCACAF region (North America, Central America and the Caribbean), the CONCACAF Champions' Cup.

Hallinan (May 27, 1849 - October 28, 1879) was an American baseball player born in Ireland. In the first professional league season, he played shortstop in five games for the 1871 Fort Wayne Kekiongas. He returned to professional play four years later and worked as a regular player for five teams in four major league seasons, including two as the regular shortstop of the New York Mutuals. Early years Hallinan began his baseball career in with the amateur Aetna Club of Chicago, and played shortstop for four seasons with that club. During that stretch, he played a few professional games for the Fort Wayne Kekiongas of the National Association. Major leagues Hallinan did not play professional baseball again until he joined the Westerns of Keokuk, Iowa in . He played every inning of their 13 games at shortstop and, when the Westerns folded, moved on to the New York Mutuals for the remainder of that season and all of 1876, when the Mutuals were a founding member of the National League. With two home runs, he was third in the NL in that category. With three in 1875 he had ranked fourth in the NA. The Clipper observed that he, \\"being remarkably fleet of foot, was often credited with home runs.\\" Jimmy playing sparingly for the Cincinnati Reds in . When the Reds disbanded during business troubles, it looked as if the team was going to fold; he and Charley Jones agreed to sign and play with the Chicago White Stockings. The Reds eventually corrected their situation, and rightfully asked for their two players back. It was agreed between the two teams that Jones return to the Reds, and Hallinan was to remain with the White Stockings. It was during July of that season that Hallinan became too ill to play, which forced him to quit, but did return to the field later in August for the Indianapolis Blues. He was only able to participate in three games. Although he was a better than average hitter, he lacked skill in the field. For his career, he hit .287 in 170 games, but in his 111 games at shortstop, he totaled 161 errors for a .744 fielding percentage. He didn't fare much better in his games in the outfield or at second base, as his career total was .756. Early in his career, he spent most of his playing time at shortstop, but due to his lack of fielding skill, he was later moved to the outfield. Death It is alleged that the reason Jimmy became too ill to play was most likely due from overuse of alcohol. In October of the following year, he succumbed to inflammation of the bowels, dying at 30 years of age in Chicago, and he was interred at the Calvary Catholic Cemetery in Evanston, Illinois.

In the introduction to his 1926 edition, Moffatt wrote, \\"The aim I have endeavoured to keep before my mind in making this translation has been to present the books of the Old and the New Testament in effective, intelligible English. No translation of an ancient classic can be quite intelligible, it is true, unless the reader is sufficiently acquainted with its environment to understand some of its flying allusions and characteristic metaphors. But something may be done and I am convinced, ought to be done at the present day to offer the unlearned a transcript of the Biblical literature as it lies in the light thrown upon it by modern research. The Bible is not always what it seems to those who read it in the great prose of the English version or indeed, in any of the conventional versions. What it is may be partly suggested by a new rendering, such as the following pages present, that is, a fresh translation of the original, not a revision of any English version.\\" In beginning his work in 1901, he arranged the New Testament into what he perceived to be historical order and provided an original translation of the New Testament, The Historical New Testament. Being the Literature of the New Testament Arranged in the Order of Its Literary Growth and According to the Dates of the Documents.The Historical New Testament Moffatt's departed from traditional translations in several areas. Firstly, he held to the documentary hypothesis and printed his Bible in different typefaces according to which author he believed had written each particular section. Secondly, he dated most books hundreds of years later than most theologians did at the time, which stemmed from his doubt about the historical accuracy of many of the biblical books (especially in the Old Testament). Finally, he rearranged the biblical texts (usually by switching chapter orders), based on his judgments about the content, authorship, and historicity of the texts. For example, John 14 comes after John 15 and 16 in the Moffatt Bible. He raised objections from many scholarsThe Bible: James Moffatt Translation by James A R Moffatt, Kregel Publications, Grand Rapids, Michigan, USA, 1994, Publisher's Preface page 14 but proved very popular and started a trend toward more paraphrased translations.https://www.olivetree.com/resources/bibles/paraphrasedtranslations.php His translation received praise from C.

The species is a popular cagebird because of its attractive song. Taxonomy It has two subspecies: G. c. canorus, native to mainland Asia, and G. c. owstoni of Hainan Island. The Taiwan hwamei (Leucodioptron taewanum) was formerly considered to be a subspecies of the Chinese hwamei but has recently been split as a separate species. Based on a study of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene, Li et al. (2006) suggested that the two species diverged about 1.5 million years ago with the two Chinese hwamei subspecies diverging about 600,000 years ago.Shou-Hsien Li, Jing-Wen Li, Lian-Xian Han, Cheng-Te Yao, Haitao Shi, Fu-Min Lei, Chungwei Yen (2006) \\"Species delimitation in the Hwamei Garrulax canorus\\", Ibis 148 (4): 698–706. The two were formerly placed in the genus Garrulax with the other laughingthrushes but have recently been moved to a new genus Leucodioptron. The Chinese hwamei was introduced to Taiwan in large numbers in the 1980s and hybridization with the native Taiwan hwamei is occurring which may threaten the genetic uniqueness of the latter form.Birding in Taiwan - Hwamei Retrieved 16/07/07. Description At San Diego Zoo It is 21 to 25 cm long with broad, rounded wings and a fan-shaped tail. The plumage is mostly reddish-brown with dark steaks on the crown, back and throat. There is a white ring around the eye which extends backwards as a white stripe. The bill and feet are yellowish. Birds on Hainan Island (L. c. owstoni) are paler below and more olive-coloured above. The Taiwan hwamei is greyer and more streaked and lacks the white markings on the head. The song is a loud, clear, varied whistling with regular repetition and imitations of other birds. The call is a rasping whistle or rattle. Distribution and habitat The nominate subspecies G. c. canorus occurs across south-eastern and central China and in northern and central Vietnam and Laos. The race G. c. owstoni is found on Hainan. G. c. canorus has been introduced to Taiwan, Singapore, Japan and Hawaii. In the Hawaiian Islands it was introduced in the early 20th century and now occurs in both native forest and man-made habitats. It is common on Kauai, Maui and Hawaii Island but less so on Oahu and Molokai. The bird inhabits scrubland, open woodland, secondary forest, parks and gardens up to 1800 metres above sea level. It is common in much of its range and is not considered a threatened species. Behaviour It is a skulking bird which is often very difficult to see. It typically feeds on the ground among leaf litter, foraging for insects and fruit. It usually occurs in pairs or in small groups. The breeding season lasts from May to July. A large cup- shaped nest is built up to two metres above the ground in a tree or bush or amongst undergrowth. Two to five blue or blue-green eggs are laid.

It is estimated to have diverged from the Chinese hwamei about 1.5 million years ago.Shou-Hsien Li, Jing-Wen Li, Lian-Xian Han, Cheng- Te Yao, Haitao Shi, Fu-Min Lei, Chungwei Yen (2006) \\"Species delimitation in the Hwamei Garrulax canorus\\", Ibis 148 (4): 698–706. It is about 24 centimetres long. It is mainly grey brown with heavy streaks on the crown, nape and back and fine streaks on much of the underparts. It lacks the white eye-markings of the Chinese hwamei which is also more rufous in colour and less heavily streaked. The whistling song is long, melodious and varied. It inhabits secondary woodland in the foothills and lower mountains up to 1,200 metres above sea level. It forages alone, in pairs or in small groups, searching amongst the understorey for insects and seeds. It has a declining population of 1-10,000 individuals and is classified as a near threatened species by BirdLife International. Habitat loss may affect its numbers but the main threat is hybridization with introduced populations of the Chinese hwamei.  Hybridization  On the island of Taiwan, the Taiwan hwamei is known to interbreed with its sister species the Chinese hwamei (Garrulax canorus). The Chinese hwamei is imported from China to Taiwan for the melodic and complex song of the males. Due to flaws in sexing of birds, females are accidentally imported and, because they cannot sing, are released where they hybridize with the native Taiwan hwamei. Due to this release of this invasive species and its interaction with the native laughingthrush, Li et al. suggest that the amount of introgression (found to be 20% in their study) is compromising the distinctiveness of the Taiwan species.

Formed in 2003, the group consists of Inge Beckmann (vocals), Paul Ressel (sequencers and analog systems), Simon \\"Fuzzy\\" Ratcliffe (bass guitar and woodwinds), and Sean Ou Tim (drums and percussion). They are often cited as \\"groundbreaking musicians\\", who were the key contributors to establishing experimental and intelligent dance music in South Africa. Their name has become synonymous with musical experimentalism, and are one of country's best loved acts. Lark has released 3 studio albums, and won a SAMA for their debut album, Razbliuto!. Their music videos have been consistently met with admiration for their technically ability, and have received two MK Awards. History =Formation and Mouth of Me (2003-06)= The band formed in Cape Town, during April 2003. At the time Inge Beckmann, a classically trained jazz and opera singer, was performing with the hip-hop group Spindle Sect. She desired to create a solo electronica project with a producer “that was a team player”. Paul Ressel, performing as the Humazier, felt he needed a female vocalist to further explore his musical style. One evening, Beckmann heard some Humanizer tracks, and \\"instantly\\" realised this was the producer she wanted. A mutual friend, Dominique Gawlowski, introduced her to Ressel and, a month later, the duo named themselves Lark. They later asked Gawlowski to manage their live shows. The duo spent time writing, in Ressel's apartment, and performing at small venues. Beckmann described this song writing process as a form of “musical exorcism”. After eight months, they went into the Sound & Motion studio in Cape Town to record their South Africa-only extended play (EP), Mouth of Me. The studio was owned by Simon Ratcliffe, a session bassist, who he engineered the recording, but did not play during the session. Produced by Ressel, the EP titled was inspired by a phrase used by Beckmann's ex- boyfriend. The EP was launched on 1 March 2005 at SOBIET in Cape Town. Ratcliffe played electric bass at the launch, and in the small crowd at the launch was, future drummer, Sean Ou Tim. After the launch the duo toured extensively, and created a solid grassroots following in South Africa, England and Germany. Ressel described their music as a blend of \\"organic and mechanical\\" sounds, and coined the term \\"glitch opera\\". It failed to chart a single, yet critics cite the EP as changing electronica in South Africa. The song \\"Tricksy\\" became a firm favourite amongst their loyal fans. It was later used on the soundtrack for Lauren Beukes' acclaimed novel Zoo City. In 2006, the duo were involved with three MTV Staying Alive television campaign, about aids awareness. They became involved after emailing the CEO of MTV Europe print campaign design. The campaigns starred Beckmann and Ressel reading poetry over dream-like imagery, backed with a glitch soundtrack produced by Ressel. It became successful for its emotive words and eerie soundtrack. It was around this time, Ratcliffe joined the band full-time as their bassist. =Razbliuto! and mainstream success (2006-07)= In April 2006, the band released their first music video, \\"Moonlight\\", directed by Greg Rom and Anthony Dart. It tells the story of futuristic corporate espionage, betrayal, and revenge. The production was rumoured to have cost 1 million (equivalent to ), with 24 people involved. The video is praised for \\"technologically and narratively\\" breaking new ground for South African music videos. Even though abstract and unusual for the country, at the time, the video received high rotation on the popular South African music channel, MK. The music video is often cited as one of South Africa's best music videos of all time, and its popularity caused the band's EP to sell out four months later. This nationwide exposure catapulted Lark into the mainstream, and shortly after they were signed by Just Music. The band's debut album, Razbliuto!, was released in September 2006 on Just Music. Produced by Ressel, at Sound & Motion, it received praise from critics. The album's maturity and lyrical playfulness created something that was experimentally ambitious, yet accessible as noted by critics. During the recording, the band was introduced to Ou Tim, a session musician and multi-instrumentalist. After recording the album, he joined the band as their on-stage drummer and percussionist. The album won the Best Alternative Album at the 13th South African Music Awards in 2007, beating established favourite Chris Chameleon. After the release, Lark focused on securing tour dates in Europe, as the album failed to attract airplay on national radio stations. As one critic noted, \\"this country may be a little too small for an album this grand\\". By popular demand, the band re-released their EP as a second album, Mouth of Me, in June 2007. It included the original six tracks, re-worked with new vocals and live drums, three remixes, and new two tracks. The Cape Town album launch was recorded live at the BMW Pavilion in the Victoria & Alfred Waterfront. The concert included guest performances from Johnny de Ridder (guitarist of Fokofpolisiekar), Kyla Rose Smith (violist of Freshlyground), a four-piece string section, and VJ Grrrl on visuals. The stage was dressed by Beckmann, and represented a \\"twisted playroom\\". Their performance of the album's single, \\"Heroin Mary\\", was released as their second official music video. The lyrics chronicle a woman battling her most inner insecurities, that eventually taunt her in the final verse. It has been described as \\"an iron fist in a velvet glove\\". =My Coke Fest snub and sabbatical (2007-09)= Following the launch, Lark began an extensive tour with notable performances at Oppikoppi, and the Sakifo Festival in Réunion. The band announced their intention to start recording a follow-up, to their Mouth of Me release, in September. This was postponed with an announcement, on 21 February 2008, that Lark would be put on sabbatical after Ressel had been signed as a producer to London-based agency Z Management. Beckman explained she would use the time to concentrate on her acting career. The break-up was described as \\"complicated\\", with the band citing the lack of financial incentive and audience, and expressing that there was \\"no future for them in South Africa, musically\\". It was later revealed the \\"final straw\\", as Paul Ressel described it, was the snub from the organisers of South Africa's largest stadium music festival, My Coke Fest. The event - sponsored by Coca- Cola - included local acts sharing the stage with international bands in Johannesburg and Cape Town. The 2008 tour was headlined by alternative acts, Muse, Kaiser Chiefs, and Korn. The festival was regarded as the stage for \\"international exposure\\", yet Lark was not billed or considered for one the ten local slots available. Shortly after, South Africa's premier rock festival, RAMFest announced Lark would have their final performance at the festival. The band stated they remain \\"best friends\\", quashing rumours of internal strife. A year after their last performance, RAMFest announced that Lark would headline their 2009 festival. Many of the acts cited Lark as their most-anticipated performance to watch at the festival. Inge Beckmann later revealed that RAMFest had agreed to pay for Paul Ressel's flights from the UK, and that there would be a five show tour, named after their new single, \\"Brave\\". At the RAMFest performance the band released a live DVD, of their 2007 album launch in Cape Town, A Dagger and a Feather. The DVD was described as the band's \\"most extravagant\\" performance to date. Lark made brief appearances at RAMFest 2010, with the release of their V EP, and Rocking the Daises 2011 with the release of their remix Brave EP on the Italian-label Onion Records. The EP was a collection of remixes of \\"Brave\\", by Haezer and four other European DJs. A year later, their third music video was released for the remix of \\"Brave\\" by Haezer. The dystopian animation of a robot universe won Best Animated Video at the MK Awards in 2013. =Return as Lark (Electro), and Gong is Struck (2011–present)= In August 2011, Paul Ressel and Inge Beckmann performed as Oppikoppi as a duo under the name Lark (Electro). The duo showcased new material, as well as songs from their back- catalogue. Inge Beckmann described Lark (Electro) as a two-person performance, while Lark remains the original four-piece band. The performance was followed by an announcement that the entire band would be recording new material, in August. It was revealed that Inge Beckmann and Paul Ressel had been writing new material over Skype and e-mail over a year, since early 2010. Inge Beckmann had visited Paul Ressel twice in London, and explained the writing was \\"out of pure creative frustration and Lark lovelorn\\". In October 2011, Lark (Electro) performed at the Bestival in the Isle of Wright on the new band stage. Although on stage during an established act's main stage performance, Lark (Electro) received high-praise from sound engineers and fellow acts as \\"something new\\". At the Assembly in Cape Town, in late-February 2012, Lark released their fourth music video. It was for their new single, Stole the Moon, and was directed by Dave Meinert. The music video was originally for another artist, with Beckmann as a character. Once Meinert heard some of their new demos, he re-scripted the video for Lark. The video depicts Beckmann walking through the 300 year-old tunnels of Cape Town, and concludes with an ariel shot 24 kilometres above the earth. The band released their third studio album, Gong is Struck, on Next Music in July 2012. The album is a departure from previous albums, with a more tribal and theatrical edge. Inspired by mythology, Inge Beckmann's lyrics are more structured and decisive, while the music strikes \\"vivd context\\". Lark went on a national tour, where they were voted, by the audience, as Best Live Act at Splashy Fen 2012. The album achieved moderate success amongst the fans, it received a lukewarm response from critics. A critic at the Mail & Guardian noted the band's \\"failure to stake a claim for continuing relevance in the South African music scene.\\" The album's second single, a cover of \\"We are Growing\\" originally by Margaret Singana, received high rotation on university radio stations and peaked at number two on UCT radio. Beckmann claims she wanted to create a \\"twisted version\\" of the pop song. After the tour, Beckmann joined the South African rock supergroup BEAST as lead vocalist. Ressel still resides in London, teaching at the Point Blank Music College, and has since worked with Lana del Rey and Faithless. Lark continues to make brief appearances at music festivals, either as Lark or Lark (Electro). Musical style =Instrumentation= Their resulting sound is eclectic, drawing on the rock, Western classical, electronic, and world vernaculars - everything from electric guitar to harpsichord to snare rushes to Ratcliffe's duduk. =Influences= In the early days, the band cited Radiohead, Massive Attack, and Portishead, because of the combination of electronic sequencers with live instrumentation, sample manipulation, and female lead vocals. Lark is often compared to Diamanda Galas, Beth Orton, Portishead, Pram, and Bjork. Recently, the band prefers not compare themselves. As Inge Beckmann has expressed that she does not have a single artist in mind, when creating a Lark track. Although she has spoken about being by inspired by Ella Fitzgerald, Freddie Mercury, Diana Ross, David Bowie, and Stevie Wonder. Paul Ressel has mentioned influences like The Books, Aphex Twin, Square Pusher, and, being heavily inspired by, Amon Tobin. Legacy Lark's efforts are recognised for introducing alternative genres to mainstream South African audiences. Their sound paved the way for numerous electronic artists like Sibot, Spoek Mathambo, Tshe-Tsha Boys, Motel Mari, DJ Mujava, Dirty Paraffin and Die Antwoord; who all garnered local support during their sabbatical. In an interview, Beckmann described the growth on the local scene as \\"very positive\\".

Valley Mall is the only indoor mall in the Hagerstown Metropolitan Area since the other closed, Martinsburg Mall. Anchor stores include Belk, Dick's Sporting Goods, JCPenney, Onelife Fitness, and Tilt Studio. History Valley Mall, developed by Shopco Development Company of New York City, officially opened its doors on 15 August 1974. It was considered the second mall to open in Western Maryland and the Tri-State Area (the first being its then-sister mall Frederick Towne Mall in Frederick, Maryland, which opened in 1972). The mall opened with 90 stores anchored by Montgomery Ward, Eyerly's, JCPenney, McCrory's, Peoples Drug, Carmike Cinemas 3, and Pantry Pride grocery store. Many changes have come to the mall over the years. Within a short time of opening, Eyerly's became The Bon-Ton, and a partial second floor with mostly small crafts stores opened. In 1995, the mall underwent a major renovation inside, including the removal of the second floor. Also in the 1990s, Peoples Drug and McCrory's closed and were replaced by small shops. Pantry Pride's location became Martin's, and Martin's moved and was replaced by Toys R Us. In 1999-2000, the mall expanded with a new wing to include Old Navy, a food court, Hecht's department store, a 16-screen multiplex, and additional small stores. In 2003, Sears moved from Long Meadow shopping center in northern Hagerstown to replace Montgomery Ward, which closed all of its remaining stores in 2001. In 2006, Hecht's became Macy's as part of the retirement of the Hecht's nameplate.Macy's will replace Hecht's at Valley Mall - Herald-Mail Macy's closed its Valley Mall location in April 2016. On June 22, 2017, it was announced that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 20 stores nationwide. The store closed in September 2017. On July 22, 2017, it was announced that Bon-Ton would be closing in February 2018 as it lease expires which will leave JCPenney as the only anchor left, however on October 18, 2018, Belk opened up in the former space of Bon-Ton, making Valley Mall having once again 2 anchor stores since the closure of Bon-Ton. On December 13, 2017, it was announced that the former Macy's would be replaced by a Tilt Studio which opened up in September 2018, and a Onelife Fitness which opened up in January 2019. Dick's Sporting Goods opened in the former Sears in 2020.

It is built on the site of the old Fort Cumberland, a launch pad for British General Edward Braddock's ill-fated attack on the stronghold of Fort Duquesne (located on the site of present-day Pittsburgh) during the French and Indian War. (See Braddock expedition.) Cumberland was also an outpost of Colonel George Washington during the French and Indian War and his first military headquarters was built here. Washington later returned to Cumberland as President in 1794 to review troops that had been assembled to thwart the Whiskey Rebellion. Cumberland was a key road, railroad and canal junction during the 19th century and at one time the second largest city in Maryland (second to the port city of Baltimore—hence its nickname \\"The Queen City\\"). The surrounding hillsides provided coal, iron ore, and timber that helped supply the industrial revolution. In addition, the city was a major manufacturing center, with industries in glass, breweries, fabrics, and tinplate. However, following World War II, it began to lose much of its industrial importance and its population declined from 39,483 residents in the 1940 census to fewer than 22,000 today.National Park Service. \\"All Abroad for Cumberland: Cumberland History.\\" National Register of Travel Itineraries. Accessed 2010-09-19. Braddock's Military Road from Cumberland to Pennsylvania, built in 1755 during the French and Indian War The city of Cumberland has found itself a center of activity throughout its history. During its more than 200 years of existence, Cumberland has been a military fort, the origin point of America's first highway, the termination point of a monumental federal construction project, a western gateway to the Ohio River Valley, the processing center for rich coal fields, and a primary link on one of America's most successful railroads. Nestled dramatically at the base of converging mountain ridges and at the confluence of Wills Creek and the Potomac River, Cumberland conforms in its layout to the rugged topography within which it is situated. From its beginnings as a British fort to its place today as western Maryland's second largest city, Cumberland has always lived up to its nickname as \\"The Queen City.\\"Parts of this article are copied from the Cumberland History, a U.S. National Park Service website whose contents are in the public domain. Pre-Colonial era Artifacts pointing to civilizations in existence before the 1st century have been found in the Cumberland area. Prior to 1730, before the arrival of the first European settlers, a clan of Native Americans lived at the confluence of Wills Creek and the Potomac River on the site of modern-day Cumberland. The existence of this Indian village is noted on the maps of early European Surveyors from this period. The Indian town was called Caiuctucuc and consisted of a series of huts called wigwams that were built chiefly along the Potomac riverfront, now Greene Street. The natives referred to the present day Potomac river as the Cohongaronto River, and the present day Wills Creek as Caiuctucuc Creek. Colonial era The name of Caiuctucuc was later changed by the first European settlers, about 1750, to Wills Creek, and the settlement's name to Wills Town, in honor of the Indian chief called \\"Will\\", who lived on the mountain to the north of the village at that time. With the coming of the European settlers, most of the Indians abandoned this region and trailed across the mountains to the Ohio River Valley, but Indian Will was not hostile to the outside settlers, and with a few of his followers continued to live on the mountain where he had his wigwam, and died there, it is believed, some time after the close of the Revolutionary War. An old Indian grave on Will's Knob is supposed to be his. Chief Will claimed all the land along the creek and sold it to the European settlers for mere trifles. When European settlers first began moving into western Maryland in the 1730s and 1740s, they encountered Native Americans residing between the Potomac and Susquehanna rivers. Conflicts ensued, and in 1744 the Maryland legislature purchased the land from the area's Native Americans, observing they would settle \\"for nothing less than Blood or Money.\\" This contract opened the area to official settlement. Germans, Swiss-Germans, and Scotch-Irish from Pennsylvania quickly colonized the area. Although the Maryland legislature had \\"purchased\\" the area, Virginia and Pennsylvania claimed the land as well. More troubling to the British Empire were French traders intent on securing their rights to the land. In 1750 Virginia planters and English merchants established a trading house and small storehouse on land which is now the heart of Cumberland. The new trading post (later called Fort Cumberland) attracted the French, who moved south and west from their Lake Ontario forts, drove out the English traders and claimed the Ohio River Valley for France. In 1753, with tensions running high between the French and English, the Governor of Virginia sent a small company led by a young Virginian named George Washington to inform the French to leave English territory and return north. The French ignored Washington's warnings, and he returned to Virginia. In the spring of 1754, Colonel Washington returned to Fort Cumberland, this time with more men. Pushing north from Cumberland towards the forks of the Ohio River where Pittsburgh is now located, Washington's force (about 230 men) encountered 600 French and 100 Indians soldiers. An inexperienced 22-year-old, Washington did not withdraw, but instructed his men to build a fort, which he grimly named \\"Fort Necessity.\\" On July 3, 1754, the French and Indian War officially began when both groups attacked the fort. Washington, completely surrounded and one third of his men killed, surrendered. Washington and his remaining troops were allowed to retreat (without their weapons) and returned to Fort Cumberland. With the loss of the Ohio River Valley, Fort Cumberland became the primary staging and supply point for the British on the colonial frontier. The fort, and later the city, derived its name from the Duke of Cumberland, son of King George II of Great Britain. After British General Edward Braddock led another disastrous foray into the Ohio River Valley, George Washington served as commander of the Virginia troops during the French and Indian War, and spent a considerable amount of time in the Cumberland area. The cabin that served as his headquarters is the only building to survive from the Fort, and has been moved to Riverside Park. Washington's service in the area was important, because he became convinced that expansion west into the interior of North America and the Ohio River Valley came through Cumberland's valley. Washington later started a company (which failed) to make the Potomac River navigable between the Atlantic Ocean and Cumberland. In the years between the end of the French and Indian War and the beginning of the American Revolution, Cumberland grew as a town, was designated the seat of the newly created Allegany County, and was poised to become a major artery on the edge of the American frontier. Post-Colonial Following the American Revolution, land hungry settlers began to push purposefully past the land west of the Appalachian Mountains. Cumberland grew slowly, until the much- anticipated Chesapeake and Ohio Canal (C&O;) and Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O;) arrived in the mid-19th century. These improved transportation routes, along with the increase development and trade opportunities they fostered, transformed this small town into the second largest city in Maryland.  Civil War During the Civil War Cumberland was a union stronghold and troops were garrisoned there to protect the B&O; Railroad. Confederate raiders routinely raided the city and in one daring raid by McNeill's Rangers kidnapped two Union generals, including General George Crook. In 1864, Confederate General John McCausland advanced along the Baltimore Pike towards Cumberland, Maryland, to disrupt the B&O; Railroad. Union Brig. Gen. Benjamin F. Kelley organized a small force of soldiers and ambushed the Rebel cavalrymen near Cumberland at Folck’s Mill forcing the Confederates to withdraw. (See Battle of Cumberland) Subsequently, race relations were unsettled. In 1907, a mixed- race man named William Burns, accused of the murder of a white policeman named August Baker, was lynched on the steps of the Cumberland jail. Industrial Revolution Panoramic view of Cumberland, 1919 Through much of its history, Cumberland's economic prosperity derived from its position as an early transportation hub linking the East Coast with the Midwest. Because of its strategic location at a gap in the mountains, Cumberland was in 1806 the starting point for the nation's first highway, the National Road (later known as U.S. Route 40). The road reached Wheeling, Virginia on the Ohio border in 1818. Of even greater significance to Cumberland's economic development in the 19th century were the B&O; Railroad, which reached Cumberland from Baltimore in 1842, and the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal from Georgetown, Washington, D.C. to Cumberland, which opened in 1850. By the 1890s, five railroads served Cumberland and employed over 2,000 local people. The C&O; Canal was also an important commercial link between East and West, providing bulk transport of items such as coal, flour, iron, and limestone products. Facilitated by Cumberland's importance as a transportation hub, manufacturing emerged as a major force in the local economy in the 19th century. By the mid-19th century Cumberland was the second largest manufacturing center in the State of Maryland, a ranking not surpassed until approximately 1915 by Hagerstown, Maryland. Important industries included glass manufacturing, brewing, textiles, and iron and steel works. The B&O; Railroad's rolling mill, located off Williams Street and Maryland Avenue, was a major employer in Cumberland from 1870 into the 20th century. Coal mining quickly became the most important industry in the Cumberland area. Some of the richest beds of soft, bituminous coal in the country lay within the hills and mountains of this region. After the Civil War, coal became one of Maryland's chief products and exports. Coal from the Cumberland area fueled the state's mills and plants, steamships in Baltimore's harbor as well as the US Navy fleet, and was traded to buyers from London, Brazil, Egypt, and beyond. Primarily Scotch and Welsh immigrants provided the labor force for these mines, immigrating with their families for the opportunities America offered. In the Cumberland region, miners escaped the indebtedness to the mining company that plagued miners in surrounding states. The company store system, in which miners were forced to purchase all their supplies and household needs from the mining company, was outlawed in Maryland in 1868. A comparatively high proportion of miners were also homeowners, as local mining firms found it more profitable to sell houses to their miners, than establish company housing. Cumberland's coal mines were constructed with horizontal shafts, far less dangerous that the vertical mines of Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Still, Cumberland's miners blackened from head to foot when they emerged from a mine at the end of a day knew that the carbon-filled air, which corroded the lungs overtime, would lead to an early death. Various manufacturing plants were established in Cumberland, because of its proximity to sources of fuel and raw materials and its position on major transportation routes. Cumberland blossomed as a result, the downtown commercial area thrived, and impressive residences built around the city reflected individual prosperity. The city became the economic center of the region. Rural farmers, industrial workers and miners traveled downtown along with successful industrialists, businessmen and county officials. = Consolidation Coal Company and the Big Vein = In the early 19th century a thick seam of bituminous coal referred to historically as \\"The Big Vein\\" was discovered in the Georges Creek Valley. This coal region became famous for its clean-burning low sulfur content that made it ideal for powering ocean steamers, river boats, locomotives, and steam mills, and machines shops. By 1850, almost 30 coal companies were mining the Georges Creek Valley, producing over 60 million tons of coal between 1854 and 1891. The Consolidation Coal Company, established in 1864 and headquartered in Cumberland, Maryland became one of the largest bituminous coal companies in the eastern United States and Cumberland had financial connections that reached beyond Washington, DC and Baltimore to New York City and London. Mine owners and their lawyers announced their importance by building large houses on the Cumberland higher grounds. A few miles west of the city clusters of company towns lined the valley and spread into adjoining ravines. Maryland's coal production began in the 1780s, when small amounts were mined for Fort Cumberland, a frontier outpost. In 1830, the first coal shipments eastward were made by barge down the Potomac River, a route later abandoned because of the rapids in the river. The State's first coal mining company was incorporated in 1836, but coal production did not become important unit the B&O; Railroad reached Cumberland in 1842. In 1850, the opening of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal from Cumberland to Washington, DC provided another route for coal shipments. Over 21 million short tons of coal were transported on the canal before it closed in 1923. Maryland's coal production rose about 1 million short tons in 1865, exceeded 4 million short tons by the turn of the 20th century, and reached an all-time high of about 6 million short tons in 1907. A small amount of the coal production in the early 20th century was premium smithing coal (as in blacksmith) that was specially processed and delivered in box cars to customers throughout the United States and Canada. Coal production declined sharply after 1920, reflecting downturns in the economy recurrent labor problems and the extensive replacement of coal by the petroleum. Production fell below 1 million short tons during the 1950s and early 1960s before the trend turned up-wards, due mostly to an increasing use of coal to generate electricity. Over 3 million short tons were produced by the state of Maryland in 1992. = Transportation and distribution = Railroads in the Wills Creek valley and the Narrows west of Cumberland in the early 20th century. Blue: Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (1842–1986). Red: Cumberland and Pennsylvania Railroad (1845 (as Mount Savage Railroad)–1953). Green: Georges Creek and Cumberland Railroad (1876–1939). Yellow: Western Maryland Railway (1906–1987). Orange: Huntingdon and Broad Top Mountain Railroad (1872–1954). Today CSXT continues to operate the former B&O; line through the valley. Transportation systems have played a major role in the history and development of Cumberland. Situated on the Potomac River at a natural gateway through the mountains, Cumberland prospered in its early years as a major transportation hub. The development of the National Road, the country's first federally funded public works project, began in Cumberland in 1811 and reached Wheeling, West Virginia by 1818. Cumberland's transportation system evolved around the C&O; Canal and burgeoning rail lines, shaped by the natural setting of the mountains, Potomac River, and Wills Creek. The B&O; Railroad reached Cumberland in 1842, followed by the Mount Savage Railroad in 1845, Huntingdon and Broad Top Mountain Railroad in 1872, the Georges Creek and Cumberland Railroad in 1876, and the Western Maryland Railway in 1906. (The Mount Savage Railroad was purchased by the Cumberland and Pennsylvania Railroad in 1854.)Stakem, Pat (2002). \\"The Huntingdon & Broad Top Mountain Railroad.\\" Accessed 2011-09-21. The completion of Interstate 68 in the late 1960s improved connections to outside regions including the Baltimore/Washington metropolitan area to the east, Harrisburg to the northeast, and Pittsburgh to the northwest. =Electric trolleys= Electric Trolleys experienced rapid expansion in the Cumberland Region starting in 1891 with the inauguration of the Cumberland Electric Railway. The railway initially transported passengers along North Centre Street to Narrows Park for a fare of five cents. The company later expanded its business by building a recreational complex on of land in an area formerly known as Seiss’ Picnic Grove, at the western end of the Cumberland Narrows near the present day Starlight Skating Rink. The Park included a soda fountain, dance and roller skating pavilion, and bandstand. In 1914, Kirkstetler Amusement leased the park to build an amusement park, that included a roller coaster, a merry- go-round, and a miniature railroad ride. In summer evenings the park was patronized by large crowds, and the trolley company expanded to meet the demand by adding extra, open sided cars to handle the traffic. *1891-1924 Cumberland Electric Railway *1924-1932 Potomac Edison Co.

Bartholomew Himmler established a brewery, about 1852, on Knox and Hays Streets. The brewery was often called \\"Bartle's Brewery\\", short for Bartholomew. * The Cumberland Brewing Company (1890–1958) which operated on North Centre Street produced Old Export Beer and Gamecock Ale. The Cumberland Brewing Company was the oldest major brewery that operated in Cumberland, and was purchased by Queen City Brewing Company in 1958. It was the last surviving brewery in Cumberland before it closed its doors in 1976. Cumberland Brewing Company Brewery * The Queen City Brewing Company, aka German Brewing Company, (1901–1974) which operated on Market Street, produced Old German Beer Premium Lager. In the 1970s Pittsburgh Brewing Company acquired the Queen City Brewing Company. At its peak, the Queen City brewery produced over 250,000 barrels of beer and ale a year in Cumberland. Queen City Brewing closed in 1974, citing rising costs of agricultural products and packaging. The year had been a tumultuous one for Queen City. In February, a nationwide independent truckers strike, protesting rising gas prices, cut off supplies for the brewery and prevented beer from being distributed to buyers. The 1973-75 recession, marked by high unemployment and high inflation, was taking its toll. The company at first demanded pay cuts from the 150 employees. Their union, Local 265, Allegany Brewery Workers, responded by demanding to see the company's books because the company was claiming that financial problems required the cuts. The company refused to open its books and make its proof, and the workers voted down the concessions. A spokesman for Local 265 explained that \\"members felt that if the brewery situation had deteriorated to the point of asking workers to take a cut in pay then the problem had gone too far out of hand.\\"Old German Beer poster =Glass industry= Glass manufacturing played an important role in the growth of Cumberland from 1880 to 1930. The Warren Glass Works Company located in South Cumberland, and the Cumberland Glass Works located at the west end of North Mechanic Street, were established in the early 1880s and would become the two major glass making firms. The industry used local coal as an economical fuel, and native pure silica sandstone in the making of the glass. At the peak of production, around 1920, well over 1,000 people were employed in the glass factories and decorating shops. The onset of the Great Depression, coupled with the destruction of seven factories by fire dealt the glass industry in Cumberland a fatal blow. Recently, however, a glass decorating business opened in the city, using some equipment from the former companies.

One such company was Kelly- Springfield Tire Company of Akron, Ohio. The deal between Cumberland and Kelly-Springfield was sealed in 1916, when the city offered the company $750,000 in cash, raised through bonds bought by Cumberland citizens, and a 10-year exemption from taxes. Groundbreaking for the plant along the Potomac River across from Ridgeley, West Virginia, began in 1917. The first tire was produced in April 1921. At its peak the company employed well over 2,000 people. The new plant site comprised . Fourteen years later, in 1935, the company was sold to Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company, which operated Kelly- Springfield as a wholly owned subsidiary. Soon after passage of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), employees at the Cumberland plant voted in 1937 to formally select the United Rubber Workers of America, Local 26, as their exclusive bargaining representative, though Local 26 had represented many of the workers already in organizing efforts and a strike in 1936. In 1942, the plant briefly switched from making tires to producing munitions for the United States military in support of World War II. By 1943, it reconverted to tire manufacturing to supply U.S. Army vehicles. In the early 1980s, the plant was used by Goodyear to produce bias medium truck tires and bias auto tires. The market for these tires deteriorated, resulting in rounds of layoffs and worker concessions, and Local 26 repeatedly pressed the company to invest money to convert the plant to radial truck tire production, as other plants had, to no avail. In 1986, in the era of corporate raids, British financier Sir James Goldsmith, with assistance from the investment bank Merrill Lynch, attempted a hostile takeover of Goodyear, buying up company stock. To ward off the takeover, Goodyear CEO Robert E. Mercer had to raise millions of dollars to buy back the stock at a premium from Goldsmith. The debt incurred forced Goodyear to close the Cumberland Kelly-Springfield plant in 1987, just 66 years after it made its first tire. Local 26 President Clayton Oster testified in Congress that the closure cost Cumberland $175 million while Goldsmith made $94 million from his unsuccessful takeover ploy. The layoffs of more than 1,000 workers were devastating to Cumberland, already reeling from a shrinking manufacturing base. Local 26 filed an ultimately unsuccessful $200 million class action against the company, seeking to stop the closure, since the company had promised the union it would perform a study to find ways to keep the plant operating but closed before doing so. Then-Maryland Governor William Donald Schaeffer criticized the lawsuit for fear it would scare the company away as he scrambled to secure an agreement to keep some part of Kelly- Springfield in Cumberland. Under the deal, Maryland promised to pay $15.1 million to construct offices and a laboratory for the company, a full $5 million more than was originally estimated as needed. Per the deal, the company's corporate offices were moved to a new facility on Willowbrook Road in Cumberland, with a promise of 500-600 corporate and research jobs. In 1999, Goodyear closed the Kelly-Springfield headquarters in Cumberland permanently, laying off 150 people. The original plant site was returned to the City of Cumberland. Much of the factory and most of the outbuildings have been torn down. The site now houses a branch of the Cumberland YMCA and the Riverside Industrial Park. =Textile industry= Amcelle: Cumberland Celanese Facility (1924–1983). In 1917, prior to the US entry into World War I, the U.S. War Department negotiated with Swiss inventor and businessman Camille Dreyfus to establish an acetate lacquer (commonly called \\"acetate dope\\") production facility in Cumberland. At that time, acetate dope was needed by the aircraft industry to coat and stretch the fabric on aircraft fuselages. The American Cellulose & Chemical Manufacturing Company began construction of the Cumberland facility in 1918, but the war was over before the plant could be completed. As a result, production at the Cumberland factory was shifted from producing acetate dope for the military to production of cellulose acetate yarn for the textile industry. The first acetate yarn spun in America was on Christmas Day, 1924, at the Cumberland plant. The company introduced the word \\"Celanese,\\" a portmanteau of \\"cellulose\\" and \\"ease,\\" as a trade name in 1925, and the company itself took this name in 1927. Celanese acetate was introduced as \\"Artificial Silk.\\" In 1926, a weaving mill was established in the Cumberland plant to develop acetate-containing fabrics on a commercial scale. This mill included equipment that could dye and weave the new fibers successfully. George A. Myers, who would become a plant labor leader, Congress of Industrial Organizations union organizer, and later a prominent member of the Communist Party, worked at the Celanese in its early years. An oral history by Myers relates: > Working conditions were brutal. A 56-hour week with even more forced > overtime – all for a straight-time wage of twenty-two-and-a-half cents an > hour. The workload was a killer, the heat intense and the air badly > polluted...A substantial minority of Celanese workers came from union > families, mainly coal miners and railroad workers. So it wasn’t very long > before we began talking union. By 1936, after three year’s of intense > struggle that included several plant-wide strikes and a number of sit-downs, > we forced the company to grudgingly recognize the union and we became Local > 1874 of the Textile Workers affiliated with the Committee of Industrial > Organizations led by John L. Lewis. During World War II, the Celanese plant produced Fortisan, a yarn used in parachutes, and butadiene, a chemical used in synthetic rubber. Wartime production drove employment to a peak of 13,000 workers at the plant. It also inflicted significant wear and tear on the facility. After the war, the company invested millions to replace machinery. Shortly thereafter, in 1949, a depression struck the U.S. textile industry, forcing mass layoffs. In the ensuing years, the plant scrapped various production lines, and the company shifted some production to newer plants in Texas, Virginia, and South Carolina. By the 1970s, the company also had plants overseas. Production at Cumberland continued to shrink and change. In 1974, Celanese established a Cytrel Tobacco Supplement plant in Cumberland with a peak capacity of 20 million lbs a year, while maintaining acetate production, shutting down colored yarn operations, and instituting further mass layoffs. By the mid-70s, fewer than 1,000 workers were employed at the plant. In the early 1980s, one round of layoffs after another swept the plant, as management announced temporary shutdowns, blaming a \\"depressed marketplace and little demand for acetate and triacetate yarn.\\" The company finally closed its Cumberland plant in 1983.  Post-industrial  The 20th century witnessed major changes in Cumberland's economy. Losing out to competition from the faster-moving railroad, the C&O; Canal declined in importance until it closed in 1924. The railroad industry also suffered from competition from other modes of transportation in the 20th century. Traditional industries such as glass making, textiles, and breweries lost ground or disappeared. Nevertheless, manufacturing remained the major source of employment in the city and Allegany County as a whole until the mid-1980s.Parts of this article are copied from the \\"2004 Cumberland Comprehensive Plan Update \\", City of Cumberland Plant layoffs and closures during the 1970s and 1980s signaled industrial decline for the city, reaching its nadir with the final closures of the Celanese and Kelly-Springfield plants. A major reason for these closures was the emergence of new technologies that rendered older industrial processes and equipment obsolete. In the 1990s, Kelly-Springfield was absorbed by parent company Goodyear and moved its corporate headquarters to Akron, Ohio, another setback for the city’s economy. The last of the \\"Big Four\\" employers, the NewPage (formerly MeadWestvaco) which operated the paper mill southwest of Cumberland in Luke, Maryland. closed in June 2020 https://www.baltimoresun.com/business/bs-md-luke-mill- closing-20190430-story.html. Cumberland experienced the same fate as many American cities in the latter quarter of the 20th century. Many industries closed their doors, leading to significant out-migration during this period, but Cumberland natives remained resilient. Today, the population of the Cumberland area has stabilized, with a small decline in the city's population due primarily to sprawling of residents into the rural areas outside the city limits. Many service-related industries have emerged over the past 20 years, particularly in the areas of tourism and entertainment, focusing around Cumberland's rich history, natural beauty, and cultural resources. Between 2001 and 2005 alone, the Cumberland arts, entertainment, and recreation industry has grown by 29.2 percent. Cumberland's economy has yet to significantly recover from the setbacks of the late 20th century. The Cumberland, MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area is one of the poorest in the nation, ranked 305th out of 318 metropolitan areas in per capita income.Newman, Jeffrey L.

In literature One of Griselda's children is taken away from her in an illustration from Eliza Haweis' 1882 book Chaucer for Children In the most famous version of the Griselda tale, written by Giovanni Boccaccio c. 1350,Boccaccio, Decamerone, day 10, tale 10. Griselda marries Gualtieri, the Marquis of Saluzzo, who tests her by declaring that their two children—a son and a daughter—must both be put to death. Griselda gives both of them up without protest, but Gualtieri does not actually kill the children, instead sending them away to Bologna to be raised. In a final test, Gualtieri publicly renounces Griselda, claiming he had been granted papal dispensation to divorce her and marry a better woman; Griselda goes to live with her father. Some years later, Gualtieri announces he is to remarry and recalls Griselda as a servant to prepare the wedding celebrations. He introduces her to a twelve- year-old girl he claims is to be his bride but who is really their daughter; Griselda wishes them well. At this, Gualtieri reveals their grown children to her and Griselda is restored to her place as wife and mother. Griselda appears in tales by Petrarch (died 1374, Historia Griseldis published 100 years later) and by Chaucer (The Clerk's Tale in The Canterbury Tales, late 1300s). She is also cited in Christine de Pizan's The Book of the City of Ladies. is a tale by Charles Perrault (1691). John Phillip's play The Commodye of Pacient and Meeke Grissill (also known as The Plaie of Grissill) dates from 1565. Henry Chettle, Thomas Dekker and William Haughton collaborated on another dramatic version, Patient Grissel, first performed in 1599. There are operas named Griselda by Antonio Maria Bononcini (Griselda, 1718), Alessandro Scarlatti (La Griselda, 1721), Giovanni Bononcini (Griselda, 1722), and Antonio Vivaldi (Griselda, 1735). Also Jules Massenet's Grisélidis (1901) was inspired by the tale of Griselda. William Shakespeare's play The Winter's Tale (1623) features many elements of the Griselda story. Anthony Trollope's high Victorian novel Miss Mackenzie (1865) is based on the Griselda theme. The Modern Griselda is a novel by Maria Edgeworth from 1804. Patient Griselda is one of a group of historical or legendary dinner-party guests in Caryl Churchill's 1982 play Top Girls. Patient Griselda is a 2015 short story by Steven Anthony George in the anthology Twice Upon A Time: Fairytale, Folklore, & Myth. Reimagined & Remastered, where the tale is retold as a late twentieth century horror story. The tale of Griselda was re-imagined by Margaret Atwood in her short story \\"Impatient Griselda,\\" which was published in The New York Times Magazine on July 12, 2020.https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/07/magazine/margaret-atwood- short-story.html In art Boccaccio's story of Griselda is depicted in a set of three Sienese panel paintings dating from around 1490 which hang in the National Gallery in London.

Later he was chair of Alberta Health Services from 2008 to 2011, before being elected to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta in 2012. He served in the provincial cabinet first as Energy minister, then as Municipal Affairs minister until resigning on 7 April 2014 to enter the Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta leadership election. Hughes withdrew his candidacy on 12 May 2014 in order to endorse the eventual winner, Jim Prentice and resigned from the legislature on 29 September 2014. Early life Hughes holds an undergraduate degree in agriculture from the University of Alberta. He also has a master's in public administration from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University (1981-1983) with a focus on public and corporate finance. Federal career Hughes represented the Alberta riding of Macleod which he won in the 1988 federal election. Hughes served one term in the 34th Canadian Parliament after which he was defeated by Grant Hill of the Reform party in the 1993 election. Health care career Following his departure from federal politics, Hughes was appointed as board chairman for the Headwaters Health Authority, a role he filled from 1994–1995. He was appointed as the founding chairman of Alberta Health Services on 15 May 2008 and served in this role until 2011. Provincial politics Hughes left Alberta Health Services and ran for the Progressive Conservative nomination in Calgary-West that was held after incumbent Ron Liepert announced his retirement. He was defeated by former MLA Shiraz Shariff. Controversy would ensue as the nomination results were overturned by the party due to complaints and uncited irregularities. A second nomination meeting was held, which Hughes won. Hughes won the Calgary-West seat during the 23 April 2012 election. Hughes was appointed to Cabinet by Premier Redford to the post of Minister of Energy. Following the Cabinet shuffle in November 2013, Hughes was asked to serve as the Minister of Municipal Affairs, resigning in April 2014 to run for party leader. While he was expected to be a frontrunner, he dropped out prior to the opening of nominations due to lack of support and endorsed Jim Prentice.

The device has clocking regions that control the flow of binary signals through the device. The input columns are driven by a separate input signal, and all the cells of each column align to match their input signal. These input columns then serve as drivers for output rows that act as serial shift registers under the control of clock signals applied to sub-sections of the rows. In this way, a copy of the contents of each of the input signals propagates along each of the output rows to an output cell. The output cells of each output row may be assigned their own, latching clock signal.PCT Application WO2006133117 (December 24, 2006) Notes Category:Living people Category:Valparaiso University faculty Category:Valparaiso University alumni Category:University of Notre Dame alumni Category:1969 births ","title":"Paul Douglas Tougaw"},{"id":"12269400","text":"Richeria grandis is a tree species in the family Phyllanthaceae which ranges from the Lesser Antilles to South America. The species is reputed to have aphrodisiac properties. Description Staminate (male) flowers of Richeria grandis. Pistillate (female) flowers of Richeria grandis. Richeria grandis is a large, evergreen tree with brown bark and a brownish-orange inner bark. It has simple, alternate leaves with an entire margin. The leaves are large, generally long up to long and wide. The species is dioecious—male and female flowers are borne on separate plants. The male inflorescences are long with 3-7 flowers; the female inflorescences are long. The fruit is a capsule, about long. Taxonomy The species was first described by Martin Vahl in 1797. The species was placed in the Euphorbiaceae, but that family was split up after molecular work showed that the family was polyphyletic. Richeria was moved into a new family, the Phyllanthaceae, when the subfamily Phyllanthoideae was elevated as a result of this split in the Euphorbiaceae. Ecology Richeria grandis is a common species in montane forests in parts of the Caribbean and South America. Ariel Lugo and colleagues reported that the species suffered higher levels of damage than most trees after Hurricane David hit the island of Dominica in 1979. The species is an aluminium accumulator, and is capable of accumulating as much as 15,000 ppm of aluminium in its leaves. The plant was able to tolerate the potentially toxic levels of aluminium primarily by depositing the metal in the cell walls of its leaves. The polypore Porogramme richeriae was described based on collections from the trunk of R. grandis in Guadeloupe. Uses Richeria grandis is one of several species including Parinari campestris and Roupala montana which known by the common name bois bandé. These species are reputed to have aphrodisiac properties.

She was the eldest daughter of Continental Army General Philip Schuyler, and a sister of Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton and sister-in-law of Alexander Hamilton. For sixteen years, she lived in Europe with her British-born husband, John Barker Church, who became a Member of Parliament. She was a prominent member of the social elite everywhere she lived, which included Albany and New York City, as well as Paris and London. Some of her correspondence with eminent friends have been preserved, including notable exchanges with Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, and the Marquis de Lafayette. The village and surrounding town of Angelica, New York were named after her. Early life Angelica Schuyler was born in Albany, New York. She was the eldest child of Philip Schuyler and Catherine Van Rensselaer Schuyler. Her parents were from wealthy Dutch families prominent since early colonial days. Catherine was a descendant of Kiliaen van Rensselaer, one of the founders of New Netherlands. The Schuylers were also fourth-generation residents. She had seven siblings who lived to adulthood, including Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton, Margarita Schuyler Van Rensselaer (known as \\"Peggy\\"), and Philip Jeremiah Schuyler. Angelica came of age during the troubled times leading up to the American Revolution, and met many prominent Revolutionary leaders. Because of her father's rank and political stature, the Schuyler house in Albany was the scene of many meetings and war councils. One of the visitors in 1776 was John Barker Church, a British-born merchant who made a fortune during the war supplying the American and French armies. At the time of their meeting and subsequent courtship, Church was on a mission from the Continental Congress to audit army supply records. Knowing that her father would not bless their marriage because of his suspicions about Church's past, Angelica eloped with John in 1777. They had eight children together. Life in Europe In 1783, Angelica and her family left for Europe, where they remained for 16 years, apart from brief visits to America. From 1783 to 1785, Angelica and her family lived in Paris while John performed his duties as a U.S. envoy to the French government. Angelica never failed to enchant the famous, intelligent men she met, and in Paris she soon befriended Benjamin Franklin, who was then America's Minister to France. She also developed lasting friendships with Franklin's successor, Thomas Jefferson, and with the Marquis de Lafayette. After a brief visit to New York in 1785, the family sailed for England, taking up residence in London. As the wife of a very wealthy man, Angelica entered a fashionable social circle that included the Prince of Wales (later King George IV), Whig party leader Charles James Fox, and playwright Richard Brinsley Sheridan. She also befriended and sponsored the émigré American painter John Trumbull, whose works included some of the most famous portraits of the American Revolutionary War era. Artists Richard and Maria Cosway also numbered among her close acquaintances in Europe. In 1788, with the intention of running for Parliament, Church purchased a country house in Wendover, Buckinghamshire, and from 1790 to 1796 he served as a Member of Parliament. During this period, Angelica made a visit home in 1789 to attend the inauguration of George Washington as the first president of the United States. Return to America and founding of Angelica, N.Y. Philip Schuyler Church, eldest son of Angelica and John Barker Church John and Angelica Church returned to the United States in May 1797 for a visit, and returned permanently in 1799 to be reunited with the Schuyler family in New York. In May 1796, John Barker Church accepted a mortgage on of land in present-day Allegany County and Genesee County, New York, against a debt owed to him by his friend Robert Morris. After Morris failed to pay the mortgage, the Churches' eldest son Philip Schuyler Church acquired the land in a foreclosure sale in May 1800. To take possession of the land, Philip traveled in 1801 to the area, near the Pennsylvania border, with his surveyor Moses Van Campen and four others. Philip Church selected specific acreage for a planned village along the Genesee River, with plots and design to be reminiscent of Paris. The plan included a circular road enclosing a village park at the center of town, streets radiating from the circular road to form a star, and five churches situated around the circle. Philip named the village Angelica, after his mother. By 1803, the village was populated with log cabin homes, including Philip's, and he had erected a sawmill and a gristmill. Philip Church married Anna Matilda Stewart in Philadelphia on February 4, 1805. Soon after the wedding, the two settled permanently in the village of Angelica, where a small whitewashed house (locally known as the \\"White House\\") had already been built for the couple on the banks of the Genesee River. In 1806, Angelica and John Barker Church began construction on a thirty-room mansion nearby, called Belvidere, which still stands as a privately owned home on the banks of the Genesee in Belmont, New York, near the town of Angelica. Although they had intended to make it their summer home, it instead became the residence of Philip and Anna Church when it was partially completed in 1810. Correspondence and personal life Detail of miniature portrait by Samuel Shelley, thought to depict Angelica Church Many examples of Angelica Church's personal correspondence with eminent figures such as Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, George Washington, and the Marquis de Lafayette are preserved in the Library of Congress and other archives. In 1996, the University of Virginia purchased a series of 77 letters, including 13 from Jefferson, that had previously been kept in her family's possession. =Thomas Jefferson= In a letter to Angelica, Jefferson ardently wrote, \\"Think of it, my friend, and let us begin a negotiation on the subject. You shall find in me all the spirit of accommodation with which Yorick began his with the fair Piedmontese.\\" Jefferson alludes to a sexually charged scene in Laurence Sterne's then-popular novel A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy, in which a parson named Yorick has to negotiate sleeping arrangements when obliged to share a room with an attractive Italian woman and her maid. =Alexander Hamilton= In view of a flirtatious attitude that fueled contemporary gossip, there has long been speculation that Angelica may have had a romantic relationship with Hamilton. Correspondence between the two, now preserved in the Library of Congress, demonstrates the strong friendship and affection between them. Hamilton biographer Ron Chernow wrote that \\"the attraction between Hamilton and Angelica was so potent and obvious that many people assumed they were lovers. At the very least, theirs was a friendship of unusual ardor.\\" In a 1794 letter to her sister Eliza, sent from London, Angelica wrote effusively of her affection for \\"your Husband, for I love him very much and if you were as generous as the old Romans, you would lend him to me for a little while.\\" Angelica's extended absence from America, as well as the Schuyler family's continued devotion to Hamilton, lend support to the view that Angelica's banter was a joke between sisters rather than evidence of an actual affair. Children Angelica and John Barker Church had eight children together. They were: *Philip Schuyler Church (1778–1861), who served as a U.S. Army captain and aide de camp to Alexander Hamilton in 1798–1800, when Hamilton was Major General of the Army during the Quasi-War with France. Philip was a lawyer and judge, and founder of the town of Angelica, New York. He married Anna Matilda Stewart (1786–1865), daughter of General Walter Stewart. *Catharine \\"Kitty\\" Church (1779–1839), who married Bertram Peter Cruger (1774–1854) *John Barker Church II (1781–1865) *Elizabeth Matilda Church (1783–1867), who married Rudolph Bunner (1779–1837) *Richard Hamilton Church (1785–1786), died young *Alexander Church (1792–1803), died young *Richard Stephen Church (1798–1889), who married Grace Church *Angelica Church (b. 1800) In popular culture The role of Angelica is prominently featured in the Tony-winning 2015 musical Hamilton, written by Lin-Manuel Miranda. Renée Elise Goldsberry originated the role in the show's off-Broadway and Broadway productions, for which she won the 2016 Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Musical for her performance. Angelica has also been portrayed in the Broadway company of Hamilton by Mandy Gonzalez, and in touring companies by Montego Glover, Emmy Raver-Lampman, Karen Olivo, Sabrina Sloan, and Rachel John. The show characterizes Angelica as a woman of extraordinary wit and intelligence. The closeness of her relationship with Hamilton is first shown in the song \\"Helpless\\", when Angelica jokes \\"I'm just sayin', if you really loved me, you would share him,\\" echoing Angelica's actual 1794 letter to Eliza. Angelica's song \\"Satisfied\\" narrates a fictional flashback in which she reenacts falling in love with Hamilton at their first meeting, explaining that she stepped aside because her sister Eliza had also fallen in love with him. Angelica is also featured in the songs \\"The Schuyler Sisters\\", \\"Non-Stop\\", \\"Take a Break\\", \\"The Reynolds Pamphlet\\", and \\"It's Quiet Uptown\\".

G. (2012), Hotel Revenue Management: Principles and Practices, Pearson, , pp. 27-38. However, if the calculation uses total hotel revenue instead of guestroom revenue it equals TRevPAR (Total Revenue Per Available Room). TRevPAR is another closely related performance metric in the hotel industry. Since RevPAR is only a measurement for a point in time (say a day, or month or year) it is most often compared to the same time frame. It is often used in comparison to competitors within a custom defined market, trading area, or advertising region or a self-selected competitive set as defined by the hotel's owner or manager, which is referred to as RevPAR Index or RGI (Revenue Generating Index). Also, comparisons are usually best considered between hotels of the same type, or with target customers. (e.g. full service, luxury, extended stay, economy) A few syndicated data companies compile RevPAR information across markets via voluntary survey, and provide compiled blinded information back to the industry. The STAR report is one such widely used report, and is provided by STR. Other Caveats: * Successful RevPAR numbers differ from market to market based on demand and other factors. * Best compared across like time periods.

If this ain't your favorite heavy release of the year, I'll eat my damn hat.\\" According to Buckley, the album's lyrical content revolve around \\"coming to terms with the fact that [prior to the album] I needed to calm down in life.\\" He mentioned that people around him were starting to settle down and have families and he \\"didn’t like that. It’s about coming to terms with the fact I didn’t need to stop living.” According to a press release, the lyrics to \\"Imitation Is the Sincerest Form of Battery\\" were based on the Federico Fellini film 8½ (1963).

Overview  Flight tracking enables travellers as well as those picking up travellers after a flight to know whether a flight has landed or is on schedule, for example to determine whether it is time to go to the airport. Aircraft carry ADSB transponders, which transmit information such as the aircraft ID, GPS position, and altitude as radio signals. These radio transmission are collected by civilian ADSB receivers located in the vicinity of the aircraft. These ADSB receivers are only able to collect information on flights within radio-range of their position, so the data they collect is usually sent to a central server which aggregates feeds from numerous individual receivers throughout the world. Flight tracking can be integrated with travel management and travel tracking services, allowing increased automation of travel software. This application of flight tracking is currently in its infancy, but is set to grow significantly as systems get more connected. Despite the progress, many abrupt events like sudden weather changes are not captured by existing flight trackers because they take their information not from the airplane itself but from dispatcher centers which often do not know the actual status of plane's whereabouts.Bailey, Jeff, , The New York Times, November 15, 2007. Flight tracking software is available for commercial operators to track their aircraft and monitor if they deviate from an agreed flight path. If they do, a warning alarm is generated to alert to a potential problem. The type of software available also imports and reviews global weather and NOTAM information to monitor any emerging issues that could affect the flight.

History  Originally it was a modification for the game Quake III Arena titled PadMod created in the year 2004. After the source code for Quake III Arena was released, the game became standalone. The idea is based on the Padman comic strip for the magazine PlayStation Games created by the professional cartoon artist Andreas 'ENTE' (German for \\"Duck\\") Endres, who also made many of the maps included with the game in 1998. The current version runs on an enhanced version of the ioquake3 engine, which is based on the Quake III Arena engine.  Gameplay  World of Padman was originally a mod for Quake III Arena, so most of the gameplay is similar. World of Padman supports bots with a variety of skill levels in both online and offline play for all of the game types included. A single-player campaign has not yet been implemented however bots allow off-line multiplayer games. Players can also record audio and video as they play. The game fully supports modifications, and custom maps can be created. In World of Padman, players die when they run out of health. Players can restore their health at a loading station or with the power-up 'revival' unlike in other games. In World of Padman there are no health items to collect.

It was unique in comparison to other communities situated in the APY Lands, in that its residents were largely not of Aboriginal Australian origin, and the land had been leased to the Government of South Australia for opal mining purposes since the 1980s. History =Background= Aboriginal people were the first people to find opals in the area; during the First World War, they traded in black opals at Coober Pedy. Conditions were harsh, and it was only in 1976, with the help of new large machinery, that non-Indigenous people came to the area to mine, and a small township was established. At around the same time, Anangu began their struggle for land rights. Consequently, by the time the South Australian Parliament began to seriously consider granting land rights in the area, a growing number of opal miners were setting up operations around Mintabie.See Kriven, S. 9 November 1989, \\"Big trouble in little Mintabie\\", Advertiser; also District Council of Coober Pedy, [2002], \\"Submission to the Inquiry into Resource Exploration Impediments,\\" Standing Committee on Industry and Resource, House of Representatives, Parliament of Australia. In November 1978, a Labor Government under Don Dunstan introduced a Bill to establish Pitjantjatjara land rights. A group of miners from Mintabie voiced strong opposition to the Bill, warning that the proposed legislation would \\"...act against future opal prospecting and mining ... tend to hinder any other industry set up by people other than Aboriginals... [and] give no real benefit to the Aboriginals but ... cause plenty of friction with the rest of the population.[Miners of Mintabie, 24 February 1979, Letter to the Select Committee on the Pitjantjatjara Land Rights Bills 1978, Records of the Parliament of South Australia. This letter was signed by 65 people. The Bill was still before Parliament when a state election was called. After the election, Anangu entered into a fresh round of negotiations with the newly elected Liberal government, under premier David Tonkin. On 2 October 1980 the Pitjantjatjara Council formally reached an agreement with the government on the provisions of a new Bill. Introduced into Parliament on 23 October 1980, the \\"Pitjantjatjara Land Rights Bill 1980\\" proposed granting Anangu title to a large area of land, which included the township of Mintabie.On 20 August 1980, the SA Government had excised Mintabie from pastoral lease \\"to provide Crown land for the issue of residential tensures for the opal mining community at Mintabie.\\" [Mr F J Vickery, 14/1/1981, p73] . First annual licenses had been issued towards the end of 1979 [Vickery p83] The Bill recognised that opal mining would continue at Mintabie and included provisions to control that activity. Certain occupancy rights were to be provided to prospectors but these would be balanced with processes that Anangu could use, if necessary, to have someone evicted from Mintabie. On 27 November 1980, the Mintabie Precious Stones Field was proclaimed by the government. Certain areas of this land were excluded from opal mining activity, including the township of Mintabie. Its name was assigned by notice in the Government Gazette on 25 June 1981. In a written submission to the Select Committee, the Pitjantjatjara Council explained that while it did \\"not wish to interfere with any person who wishes to mine, conduct business or otherwise live at or visit Mintabie lawfully,\\" it had serious concerns about \\"sly grog selling\\" and consequent violence in the community, so expressed a wish that the Bill should include the Mintabie area under their title to enable integrated rules to apply to the whole area.\\"The difficulties associated with Mintabie are deep-rooted ones. For a long time, the community there has been under little control from the Government, either through the Police or the Mines Department. ... The main problem in the past has been sly grog selling which has continued unchecked as recently as last week. As a result of unlimited access to take-away liquor, many Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara people have been subjected to acute social dislocation [and violence]... the Bill must include the [Mintabie Precious Stone] Field under title to enable integrated rules for protection of the lands to apply and ... long-awaited social controls [to] be enforced. (Pitjantjatjara Council. 16 December 1980, \\"Submission to the Parliamentary Select Committee on the Pitjantjatjara Land Rights Bill 1980,\\" p8.) In contrast, the opal miners of Mintabie - and also some from Coober Pedy - opposed the Bill, sometimes vehemently, suggesting that confrontation and bloodshed may follow if the Mintabie Precious Stones Field were excised from the Act.\\"...it is absolutely essential that the area ... of the Mintabie Precious Stones Field be excised from the Act! ... if the politicians of South Australia ignore this request, then they must be held fully responsible for any confrontation - and possibly even bloodshed - that would almost certainly follow.(Coker, B. 13 January 1981, \\"Submission to the Select Committee of the Pitjantjatjara Land Rights Bill - 1980,\\" p2.) =APY Land Rights Act 1981 lease-back= After extensive discussions with both the Pitjantjatjara Council and the Mintabie Progress Association, the Parliamentary Select Committee recommended that the area of land covering the township of Mintabie be included in the grant of land to Anangu but would be leased back to the Crown for a period of 21 years. Such an arrangement would enable the Crown to \\"issue Annual Licenses to persons entering... and wishing to reside\\" at Mintabie.\\"Report of the Select Committee on the Pitjantjatjara Land Rights Bill, 1980,\\" tabled in the House of Assembly, Parliament of South Australia on 3 March 1981, p3-4. The Committee tabled its report on 3 March 1981 and the Bill proceeded through Parliament. On 2 October 1981, the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Land Rights Act 1981 came into operation, giving Anangu inalienable freehold title to the APY Lands. On that day, under Section 28(2) of the Act, the township of Mintabie was \\"deemed to have been leased by Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara to the Crown for a term of twenty-one years\\", until 21 October 2002. Section 28(2) covers an area of land defined as \\"section 1291 Out of Hundreds (Everard)\\", approximately . It is located within the Mintabie Precious Stone Field, which is approximately in size and is proclaimed for the purpose of opal mining.PIRSA, 1 September 2004, Information provided to the Aboriginal Lands Parliamentary Standing Committee, p14. =2009 Amendment and 2012 extension= In December 2009 the South Australian Parliament passed the Aṉangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Land Rights (Mintabie) Amendment Bill, which was an amendment to the APY Land Rights Act 1981, the Opal Mining Act 1995 and by-laws under the APY Land Rights Act 1981, affecting the residents of Mintabie. This Act changed the licensing system for residential and commercial premises effective 1 July 2012, allowing the Minister responsible for the Opal Mining Act to grant licences. On 20 April 2012, after several earlier extensions had been granted by APY and the Minister for Mineral Resources and Energy had taken over from the Minister of Lands as the responsible Minister, an agreement among four parties (APY, the Minister for Mineral Resources and Energy, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and Reconciliation, and the Mintabie Miners Progress Association) was reached, and the lease on the town extended to 30 June 2027 (later amended to 2 October 2027), unless conditions were fulfilled for an earlier termination. =2017 Review, 2019 termination of lease= A 2017 report found many instances of non-compliance with the 2009 Amendment as well as other problems occurring in the settlement of Mintabie. It recommended closure of the township, with control reverting to APY. After an appeal by residents failed, the final eviction date for the township was set at 31 December 2019. In February 2018 the state government declared that it would not renew any leases in the town, after a report found it had become a centre for illegal distribution of drugs and alcohol into the APY Lands. As all land in the town was leased from the government, and these leases were renewed every year, this amounted to a compulsory closure of the town in 2019. Management of the land would revert to the local Aboriginal land council, Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara (APY). The APY Lands executive board would not allow residents to live in the town once it was transitioned to their control, with the date originally set at 1 July 2019. However this date was extended following negotiations to 3 January 2020, after residents settled the Federal Court litigation instituted to keep the town open. Falling in the middle of a heatwave, local residents complained of the difficulties of relocating at such a time. Geography Mintabie is situated west of the Stuart Highway and about northwest of Marla and northwest of Adelaide, the capital of South Australia. Mintabie is approximately south of Alice Springs.\\"Every Pub\\", Vol. 2, Chris Dittmar, Bruce Abernethy & Australian Hotels Association (SA branch), 2006, , Mintabie sits in a geographical basin. It is therefore not surprising that there is a lake basin near Mintabie. The Mintabie Miners Progress Association describes the lake as follows: > The lake at Mintabie is fed by many small surrounding creeks. In the past 15 > years, it has been filled twice. The first time was in 1988, when higher > than normal rainfall filled the lake to capacity. Although the rainfall > returned to normal, the lake retained water for approximately three years. > Rains in 2000 again filled the lake. Today the lake has once again dried up > awaiting another big rain. The parcel of land on which Mintabie sits is leased by the State government from Anangu. The original township lease expired in 2002. On 3 December 2009, the South Australian Parliament passed the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara Land Rights (Mintabie) Amendment Act 2009. This legislation creates the framework for a new lease. Geology and mining The ABS 1999 Yearbook for South Australia states, concerning Opal Mining at Mintabie, that: > The opal fields at Coober Pedy, Mintabie and Andamooka, together with fields > in New South Wales, supply most of the world’s precious opal. The estimated > value of raw opal production in South Australia was $40.7m in 1997. Most of > this is exported to Hong Kong, Japan, the United States of America and > Germany. In 2007, the South Australian Department of Primary Industry and Resources described Mintabie's geology as follows: > the Eromanga Basin borders onto old basement rocks which are about 1,500 > million years old and consist of granite and gneiss. Also on the western > margin lie the sediments of the Officer Basin which comprise sandstone, > quartzite, siltstone and shale about 500 million years old. These sediments > were tilted by crustal forces and form prominent hills such as the Mount > Johns Range near Marla. The opal deposits at Mintabie occur in a sandstone > unit which was bleached and weathered by the same process that affected the > Eromanga Basin sediments as described above. Climate Based upon the climate records of the nearest weather station at Marla Police Station, Mintabie experiences summer maximum temperatures of an average of in January and a winter maximum average temperature of in June. Overnight lows range from a mean minimum temperature of degrees in January to in June. Annual rainfall averages . Native fauna Native animal species commonly found in and about Mintabie include the galah, thorny devil and netted dragon lizard and the larger lizard variety known as goanna. Population In October 2017, the Government of South Australia estimated that Mintabie's population was about 30 people, although it was acknowledged this increased to about 60 people at different times of the year. During the 1970s and 1980s, it had a population of over 500 people. Facilities Mintabie has an \\"all-weather\\" airstrip, school, and 7-day supply of fuel and services.OACDT Community Profile Page; Accommodation is catered for by the Mintabie Hotel (Goanna Grill and Bar) which has 6 rooms, 2 self-contained units and also a 24-hour power caravan park. Mintabie also has another caravan park. The Mintabie health clinic, called the \\"Clarice Megaw Clinic\\" was opened in 1990 and so named in honour of a bequest from a deceased estate which enabled health authorities to commit more resources to the region. This has now been sold by Frontier Services for an undisclosed amount to a private buyer. The Mintabie Area School is a R-12 school with approximately 20 students. By 2009 this had fallen to only 11 enrolments. Mintabie does not have a permanent police presence but patrols are conducted in the town by the police station located at Marla. A permit from the Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara is required to access Mintabie, as the land is owned freehold by the resident Aboriginal people. Currently this is not being enforced because of unresolved issues. For State elections (i.e. to elect the Parliament of South Australia), a mobile polling booth is taken to Mintabie. Trafficking of illegal drugs and alcohol Despite long periods of government inattention, Anangu have repeatedly highlighted the negative impacts that certain individuals and businesses operating out of Mintabie have on their lives. This has included raising their concerns with representatives of the South Australian Parliament. In October 1987, APY advised a group of parliamentarians visiting the Lands that alcohol had become a major problem for Anangu communities and that a significant amount was being brought illegally on to the Lands through Mintabie. On that occasion, Anangu called for South Australia Police (SAPOL) \\"to pay greater attention in Mintabie to the sale of alcohol to Aborigines.\\"Commissioner for Consumer Affairs (SA). 1994, Annual report 1993/94, Adelaide, p29. In 1988, after visiting Anangu communities and Mintabie, a Parliamentary Committee reported that it had also been \\"advised of ‘grog running' by persons apparently using Mintabie as the source of supplies and then selling the alcohol at inflated prices to Aboriginal people.\\" The Committee recommended \\"that the matter of alcohol distribution from the Mintabie area be investigated urgently by the Police.\\"Report of the Pitjantjatjara Lands Parliamentary Committee, 1988, Parliament of South Australia More than a decade later, significant problems remained. In 2002, in a written submission to a parliamentary inquiry, Iwantja Council alleged that many people at Mintabie were involved in \\"selling sly grog to Anangu.\\" The submission continued: > So much grog is stored in houses [at Mintabie] that people break in to gain > access to it, what follows ends in violence and as proved recently a murder > resulted directly from the stored alcohol. In recent times the sale of > marijuana has reached an epidemic. This is coming from Mintabie as well. The > reason it continues is that the people have to be caught in the act, an > almost impossible task as the Marla Police Station is about awayIwantja > Community Inc. 16 September 2002, Written submission to Select Committee on > Pitjantjatjara Land Rights, p2. A month after Iwantja made these allegations, SAPOL confirmed Mintabie as the source for a significant amount of the drugs including alcohol coming on to the APY Lands.Mildren, P. 29 October 2002, Transcript of evidence to Select Committee on Pitjantjatjara Land Rights, p285. On that occasion, SAPOL also reported that it had \\"recently found buried at Mintabie a large container set up with hydroponic gear that [had] been the source of cannabis for much of the lands for the past couple of years.\\"Mildren, P. 29 October 2002, Transcript of evidence to Select Committee on Pitjantjatjara Land Rights, p289. Drugs including alcohol continue to enter the APY Lands through Mintabie. In August 2007, SAPOL arrested and charged two men at Mintabie for their alleged involvement in a \\"cannabis selling network.\\"South Australia Police, 4 September 2007, \\"Tri-State Police initiative - Two men arrested at Mintabie,\\" media release. In April 2008, the Mullighan Inquiry into child sexual abuse on the APY Lands noted SAPOL's concern that Mintabie was \\"being used as a staging post for the trafficking of marijuana on the Lands.\\" Even so, Coober Pedy has been overlooked as a source of alcohol and other drugs even though it is only 250 km south of Mintabie (where only during 2011 an APY citizen was murdered due to alcohol-related sales in Coober Pedy). Also the increase of work on the APY by contractors from Marla has also increased the amount of drugs trafficked into the APY lands. Again no police action has been taken against either Coober Pedy and Marla.

Though control of the area changed among Spain, England, the United States, and the Confederate States of America, it remained largely undeveloped until the 20th century. The first settlement in the area was the site of a massacre at the beginning of the Second Seminole War, an event which precipitated the abandonment of the settlement and set back development in the area by over 50 years. The first United States stockade named Fort Lauderdale was built in 1838, and subsequently was a site of fighting during the Second Seminole War. The fort was abandoned in 1842, after the end of the war, and the area remained virtually unpopulated until the 1890s. The Fort Lauderdale area was known as the \\"New River Settlement\\" prior to the 20th century. While a few pioneer families lived in the area since the late 1840s, it was not until the Florida East Coast Railroad built tracks through the area in the mid-1890s that any organized development began. The city was incorporated in 1911, and in 1915 was designated the county seat of newly formed Broward County. Fort Lauderdale's first major development began in the 1920s, during the Florida land boom of the 1920s. The 1926 Miami Hurricane and the Great Depression of the 1930s caused a great deal of economic dislocation. When World War II began, Fort Lauderdale became a major US Navy base, with a Naval Air Station to train pilots, radar and fire control operator training schools, and a Coast Guard base at Port Everglades. After the war ended, service members returned to the area, spurring an enormous population explosion which dwarfed the 1920s boom. In the 1970s, Ft. Lauderdale beach became a mecca for runaways and a group of approximately 60-150 runaways formed a group called \\"The Family\\",.Most resorted to petty crimes to support themselves and others. Today, Fort Lauderdale is a major yachting center, one of the nation's biggest tourist destinations, and the center of a metropolitan division of 1.8 million people. Prior to 1820 Frankee Lewis lands, New River Settlement Archaeological evidence indicates that the first natives in the Broward County area arrived approximately 4,000 years ago. At the time of initial European exploration, the area was occupied by the Tequesta tribe of Native Americans. Contact by Spanish explorers beginning in the 16th century proved disastrous for native tribes, including the Tequesta, as the Europeans unwittingly brought with them diseases to which the native populations possessed no resistance, such as smallpox. For the Tequesta, disease, coupled with continuing conflict with their Calusa neighbors, contributed greatly to their decline over the next two centuries. By 1763, there were only a few Tequesta left in Florida, and most of them were evacuated to Cuba when the Spanish ceded Florida to the British in 1763, under the terms of the Treaty of Paris (1763), which ended the Seven Years' War. Bernard Romans reported sighting many abandoned Tequesta villages when he visited the area in the 1770s. Subsequently, Florida returned to Spanish control under the terms of the Treaty of Paris in 1783, which ended the American Revolutionary War. In the early 18th century, Creek Indians had moved down from Alabama and joined the Oconee, themselves recent immigrants from Georgia; together, they formed the core of the Seminole tribe. Settlements by the English, and later Americans, gradually pushed the Seminoles southward. In 1788, roughly the same time that the Seminoles began to arrive in what was eventually to become Broward County, two families arrived and set up homes along the New River—the Lewis family and the Robbins family, who had arrived in Florida from the Bahamas. 1820-1892 Under the terms of the Adams-Onís Treaty, ratified in 1821 between Spain and the United States, Florida was ceded to the United States in exchange for U.S. forfeiture of a $5 million debt owed by Spain. Florida became a U.S. Territory in 1821. By 1830, the de facto leader among the approximately 70 people living at the \\"New River Settlement\\" (present day Fort Lauderdale) was William Cooley. Cooley was appointed by Governor William Pope Duval as Justice of the Peace for the region. In 1835, white settlers killed a Seminole chief named Alibama and burned his hut in a dispute. As Justice of Peace, Cooley jailed the settlers, but they were released after a hearing at the Monroe County Court in Key West; the justification was insufficient evidence. The Seminoles blamed Cooley, saying he withheld evidence. The growing uneasiness between the Seminoles and the whites led to the Seminole migration to the Lake Okeechobee area. On 28 December 1835, a Seminole ambush known as the Dade Massacre started the Second Seminole War. On 3 January 1836, Cooley led a large shipwrecking expedition from the settlement to free the Gil Blas, a ship that had beached the previous September; the scale of the operation required most of the settlement's able men. The following day, a group of 15 to 20 Seminoles invaded the Cooley house, killed Cooley's wife and children, scalped the children's tutor, and burned the house to the ground. Although the Indians did not attack any other families, the massacre triggered the departure of the white settlers from the area. During the second Seminole War, Major William Lauderdale led his Tennessee Volunteers into the area. In 1838, Lauderdale erected a fort on the New River at the site of the modern city of Fort Lauderdale (where SW 9th Avenue meets SW 4th Court). Lauderdale left after one month, but his name remained. The Seminoles destroyed the fort a few months later. Two more forts were built sequentially, each closer to the ocean. After the end of the Second Seminole War in 1842, the fort was abandoned, and the area remained largely empty, as the remaining Seminoles withdrew to Pine Island (near present-day Hollywood Seminole Indian Reservation), and only a handful of settlers were known to live in all of what eventually became Broward County. While the area was technically a part of the Confederacy during the US Civil War, the only known white settlers in the area during the war was pro-unionist Isaiah Hall and his family, who had been run out of Miami by pro-confederacy sympathizers in 1863, and settled on the New River. As there was no overland route into or out of the area, no significant settlement was undertaken until the 1890s. In 1892, however, the first road through the county was built, when a road was constructed from Lemon City, a settlement near the town of Miami, to Lantana, on the southern shore of Lake Worth, in Palm Beach County. A ferry crossing was established across the New River. 1893-1925 Will Stranahan (Frank's brother) with Seminole IndiansIn 1893 a young Ohioan named Frank Stranahan arrived to operate the ferry across the New River; he built a house that served as the first trading post, post office, bank and hotel in the area. He later built three more houses on the original site along present-day U.S. 1, the last of which was constructed in 1901. That house stands today as a museum and is Broward County's oldest standing structure. In 1896, the Florida East Coast Railway (FEC) extended its line south from West Palm Beach to Miami, with a station in Fort Lauderdale. The first train stopped in Fort Lauderdale on 22 February 1896. Further development was spurred by the construction of the first automobile bridge across the New River in 1904. Fort Lauderdale was incorporated in 1911. In 1915, it became the county seat of the newly established Broward County, which also consisted of the incorporated towns of Dania, Deerfield, Hallandale,and Pompano (all four towns later added \\"Beach\\" to their names) and the unincorporated settlement of Davie. The first census after the city's incorporation, the 1920 census, documented a population of 2,065. In 1920, construction of the first canals in the city began, clearing the mangroves and creating the first \\"finger islands\\" that became synonymous with the city. In February 1925, a state-commissioned census recorded 5,625 people in Fort Lauderdale, and a real-estate boom was in progress in South Florida. While the land rush was focused on the Miami area, communities throughout the region, including Fort Lauderdale, Pompano Beach and Boca Raton were swept up in the speculative buying frenzy. A census undertaken by the city during the first week of December 1925 counted a population of 15,315, an increase of 300% in less than 10 months. By the end of the year, however, the region's infrastructure, unable to cope with the sudden influx, began to crack under the strain. Faced with a supply of materials which far exceeded its shipping capacity, the FEC instituted an embargo on shipping on 18 August 1925, restricting transport to fuel, petroleum, livestock, and perishable goods. On 29 October, all shipments except foodstuffs were eliminated, in an effort to reduce the transport backlog the railroad was experiencing. 1926-1945 Smugglers being captured in Fort Lauderdale, 1926 The Florida land boom collapsed in 1926. At that time, the only methods of bringing supplies into the area were on the FEC's single track or through the Port of Miami, as Port Everglades was not yet completed. On 10 January 1926, the schooner Prinz Valdemar sank in the channel of the Port of Miami, trapping eleven vessels and effectively blockading the port until 29 February, when the Army Corps of Engineers dug a new channel around the capsized vessel. Real estate firms solely financed by continuous development began to fail, and the financial crisis began to extend to larger developers. The Miami Hurricane of 1926, with the highest sustained winds ever recorded in the state of Florida, was the final blow. Fort Lauderdale suffered extensive damage from the hurricane, which killed 50 people and destroyed an estimated 3500 structures in the city. In February 1928, Port Everglades was opened. The city had just begun to recover from the 1926 hurricane when another devastating hurricane struck, this time to the north, in Palm Beach County. The 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane only slightly damaged Fort Lauderdale, but the enormous death toll contributed to the perception that Florida was not the paradise that had been promoted by developers. When the Great Depression struck in 1929, it had little effect on the city, which was already in a depression from the real estate bubble burst three years earlier. While the collapse of the land boom and the depression had reversed the sharp growth of 1925, the population of the city began to grow at a moderate pace. In 1930, there were 8666 people in the city. That number had risen to 17,996 by 1940. The United States did not enter World War II until 1941, but Fort Lauderdale felt the effect of the war sooner than most of the rest of the country. In December 1939, a British cruiser chased the German freighter Arauca into Port Everglades, where she remained until the US seized her in 1941, when Germany declared war on the US. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the United States' subsequent entry into the war had almost immediate effects on the city. Blackouts were imposed, and several allied vessels were torpedoed by German U-boats, including at least one ship within sight of the shoreline. The first Medal of Honor recipient in World War II was a graduate of Fort Lauderdale High School; Second Lieutenant Alexander R. Nininger Jr. was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor on 29 January 1942 for his actions on 12 January 1942 in Abucay, Bataan, Philippines, during the Japanese invasion. One of the missing planes, FT-28. By mid-1942, the United States Navy had converted Merle Fogg Field into Naval Air Station Fort Lauderdale, and had constructed two satellite landing fields, one at West Prospect Field, and the other in Pompano Beach (which later became Pompano Beach Airpark, home of one of the Goodyear Blimps). By the end of the war, the station had trained thousands of Navy pilots, including future congressman, UN Ambassador, Director of Central Intelligence, and President of the United States George H. W. Bush. Additional facilities in the city included radar and range finding schools and a base at Port Everglades. On 5 December 1945, the five planes of Flight 19 departed on a routine training mission from NAS Fort Lauderdale and were never seen again. It is presumed that the flight leader became disoriented and led the other planes out of range of land, causing the planes to run out of fuel and crash, but no wreckage has been found. The strange disappearance of the flight and the coincidental explosion which destroyed Training 49, a plane involved in a search for the missing squadron, contributed to the Bermuda Triangle myth. 1945–1961 Fort Lauderdale's downtown skyline in 2006 In 1946, the Navy decommissioned its airfields in the area; NAS Fort Lauderdale became Broward County International Airport (later Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport) and West Prospect Field became Fort Lauderdale Executive Airport, the eleventh-busiest general aviation airport in the country. One year later, the 1947 Fort Lauderdale Hurricane, an unusually large (120 mile radius) Category 4 hurricane, came ashore just north of the city, causing extensive damage due to flooding. Earlier storms that year had saturated the ground, and the tremendous rainfall from this slow-moving storm left the city (and much of the state) under several inches of water for weeks. In the 1950s, the city became a favorite destination for college students for spring break, a tradition immortalized in the 1960 film Where the Boys Are. Every year in February, March, and April, tens of thousands of college students would come to relax at the beaches and party at the many bars along A1A. Desegregation of Ft. Lauderdale's beaches Starting in 1946, black residents, including the Negro Professional and Business Man's League and Dr. Von D. Mizell, requested that the County designate \\"a public bathing beach for colored people in Broward County\\"; they were not permitted at any public beach in the county, although they were tolerated on the privately owned beaches north of Ft. Lauderdale until 1953. Nothing was done about a \\"colored beach\\" until 1954, when the county acquired land for the beach, today Dr. Von D. Mizell-Eula Johnson State Park, but it was only accessible by boat and for several years there were no tables or rest rooms. A bridge and access road were constructed after 11 more years, in 1965. In the meantime, to some extent inspired by the release of Where the Boys Are at the beginning of 1961, frustrated African-American residents, led by Eula Johnson, President of the Broward NAACP chapter, and Dr. Von D. Mizell, conducted a series of \\"wade-ins\\" (see sit-ins) on Ft. Lauderdale beaches between July 4 and August 8, 1961. The city of Fort Lauderdale sued them and the NAACP, seeking an injunction to force them to stop \\"beach wade-in disruptions\\". Johnson received death threats, and offers of cash and other privileges if she would stop the wade-ins, which she refused to do. In 1962 a judge ruled against the city, and since then Ft. Lauderdale's beaches have been desegregated. 1962–present The 1960 Census counted 83,648 people in the city, about 230% of the 1950 figure. A 1967 report estimated that the city was approximately 85% developed, and the 1970 population figure was 139,590 After 1970, as Fort Lauderdale became essentially built out, growth in the area shifted to suburbs to the west. As cities such as Coral Springs, Miramar, and Pembroke Pines experienced explosive growth, Fort Lauderdale's population stagnated, and the city actually shrank by almost 4,000 people between 1980, when the city had 153,279 people, and 1990, when the population was 149,377. A slight rebound brought the population back up to 152,397 at the 2000 census. Since 2000, Fort Lauderdale has gained slightly over 18,000 residents through annexation of seven neighborhoods in unincorporated Broward County. =\\"Spring break-ers\\" no longer welcome= After a rowdy 1985 spring break season, in which an estimated 350,000 college tourists caused disruption for several weeks in the spring, the city passed a series of restrictive laws in an effort to reduce the mayhem caused by the spring break throngs, and the mayor, Robert Dressler, appeared on Good Morning America to tell college students they were not welcome any longer in Fort Lauderdale. Overnight parking was banned near the beach and an open-container law prohibiting the consumption of alcohol in public places was enacted. The following spring, the city denied MTV a permit to set up their stage on the beach, and approximately 2,500 people were arrested as the new laws were strictly enforced. In 1985, 350,000 college students spent about $110 million during the nine-week spring break season; by 2004, 700,000 visitors, mostly families or European tourists, spent $800 million during the same period. By 2006, the number of college students visiting for spring break was estimated at approximately 10,000. =Riverwalk project= Beginning in 1986, with the passage of a bond issue, the city of Fort Lauderdale began an aggressive effort to connect the city's arts and entertainment district, the historic downtown area, and the Las Olas shopping and beach district, and to shake its long-standing reputation as a cultural wasteland and college-student party town. The centerpiece of the cultural renaissance was the Riverwalk project, which runs along the New River from the Broward Center for the Performing Arts to the Stranahan House, with work in progress to extend the walk to Las Olas Boulevard. The Museum of Art  Fort Lauderdale, which moved into its current location in 1986, and the Museum of Discovery and Science, which opened in its current location in 1992, are cornerstones of the Riverwalk project. A number of upscale high-rise residential towers along the river have encouraged the development of high-end shopping and entertainment throughout the downtown area. =2017 airport shooting= The 2017 Fort Lauderdale airport shooting resulted in five deaths.

She was also a founding member of the Ninety-Nines, a women's pilot group. She was one of the first women to participate in air races with men. She died in an accident during the Frank Phillips Trophy Race at the 1933 International Air Races in Chicago, Illinois. Life Florence Edith Gunderson was born September 3, 1904 to Gustave and Florence (Parker) Gunderson on their small farm in Oakport Township, Minnesota. She was baptized in the Oak Mound Congregational Church and attended the Oak Mound Consolidated School in Kragnes Township with her sister Myrtle and brothers George and Roy. Her father \\"Gust\\" worked at Oak Mound School as a janitor and school bus driver and was the clerk of Oak Mound Church. The family moved to Moorhead, Minnesota around 1918, where the daredevil Florence took up riding motorcycles - very fast! She met Charles Klingensmith and they married on 25 June 1927, but within a year and a half the two had split. In August, 1928 Charles Lindbergh visited Fargo, North Dakota, where she was living at the time, inspiring Florence to take flying lessons. In 1928, she attended Hanson Auto and Electrical School in Fargo. That summer, she agreed to be a skydiver in return for flight lessons from Edwin Mead Canfield. Her first jump left her unconscious, but this did not deter her. Over that winter she went door to door to persuade local business men to fund the purchase of a plane. In return, Florence would promote Fargo and carry advertisements at fairs, flying meets, and air races. Her persistence paid off. As Fargo laundry owner William T. Lee said, \\"If you're willing to risk your neck, I'll risk my money.\\" He and other local business owners put up $3,000 to purchase a Monocoupe. She picked it up and flew it back to Fargo's Hector Field, where she was working as a mechanics' apprentice, and christened it \\"Miss Fargo.\\" In June 1929 she became the first licensed woman pilot in North Dakota. That summer she barnstormed county fairs, worked as operations manager at Hector, and flew in her first race, where she took fourth place. On 19 April 1930, she set the woman's record for inside loops with 143 loops. Unfortunately, no National Aeronautics Association members were present to make it official. Laura Ingalls later raised her loop record to 980. On 22 June 1931, before more than 50,000 spectators (and NAA officials), Florence took off from Wold Chamberlain Field at Minneapolis, Minnesota. Four and one-half hours later she landed, \\"A trifle groggy and gagged by gas fumes,\\" with a verified record of 1,078 loops. At the 1931 National Air Races in Cleveland, Ohio she won four woman-only events and claimed $4,200 in prize money. At the 1932 Nationals she won the most coveted prize in women's aviation, the Amelia Earhart Trophy, presented by Amelia Earhart herself and winning the grand prize of an Essex Terraplane automobile. In 1932, she came second in the Shell Speed Dash, in a Monocoupe. 1933 International Air Races In 1933 Florence was the first woman to enter the $10,000 Frank Phillips Trophy Race at the International Air Races in Chicago, Illinois. The Phillips was a , 12 lap pylons race and was open to planes with no limits on engine size. This race was the main event at the Nationals that year. Florence flew a bright red Gee Bee Model Y Senior Sportster NR718Y, owned by Arthur Knapp of Jackson, Michigan. The fabric-covered craft's original 220 horsepower (164 kW) Lycoming R-680 engine had been replaced with a 670 hp (500 kW) Wright Whirlwind. Late in the afternoon of September 4, one day after her 29th birthday, Florence was flying in fourth place ahead of four male fliers, averaging over through the first eight laps. Then, just as she was passing the grand stands, a bit of red fabric fluttered down from the fuselage. The stresses of the race were apparently too much for the overpowered light craft. Florence immediately veered off the course and flew steady and level straight south to a plowed field a couple of miles away in Northfield Township. Suddenly the plane nosed over into the ground from about up. Florence died instantly. Apparently she had attempted to bail out. Her parachute was found tangled in the fuselage. Organizers used her death as an excuse to bar women from the Air Races. Florence's body was shipped back to Minnesota for the funeral. The businessmen who had bankrolled Florence's first plane served as pallbearers and her funeral was held in the First Presbyterian Church of Fargo. She was interred in the Gunderson family lot in Oak Mound Cemetery, Kragnes Township, a few miles from where she was born. In June, 2015, the local Oak Mound 4-H Club erected a monument on Florence's grave in Oak Mound Cemetery, and it was dedicated during a ceremony on June 14, 2015. The completed monument consists of a brick pillar with a model of a red Gee Bee Model 'Y' Senior Sportster sitting atop, and a plaque complete with Florence's picture, biography, and a list of her accomplishments affixed to the front.

Wright's Ferry was a Pennsylvania Colony settlement established by John Wright in 1726, that grew up around the site of an important Inn and Pub anchoring the eastern end of a popular animal powered ferry (1730–1901) and now a historic part of Columbia, Pennsylvania. The complex was important in settling the lands west of the cranky Susquehanna, for without resorting to water craft, the ferry was the first (and for many years, the only) means of crossing the wide watercourse of the relatively shallow Susquehanna River for settlers with a cargo in the southern part of Pennsylvaniawhich is very wide from Middletown, Dauphin County southerly past Wright's Ferry and grows steadily wider as it nears its mouth at the Chesapeake Bay, and whose banks are steep enough to prevent easy cargo handling from small boats. As Pennsylvanian settlers started to move into the area, ownership conflicts arose between the English colonies of Maryland and Pennsylvania due to sloppy grants and inaccurate surveys creating conflict with Lord Baltimore of Maryland, who thought his land grant covered this area. William Penn's charter and Lord Baltimore's were in conflict. Lord Baltimore used a thug named Thomas Cresap in the area to try to prevent settlers from Pennsylvania from creating homesteads. During the 1730s this aggression triggered a series of armed confrontations known as Cresap's War, as Cresap ran off settlers and gave their land to his followers. This long border dispute was finally settled in 1767 when both colonies accepted the Mason–Dixon line as a revised boundary when ordered by the King. The ferry infrastructure was built in 1730 to transport goods, animals, and people across the Susquehanna River in south central Pennsylvania, between present- day Lancaster and York counties. The ferry was particularly valuable to those new settlers seeking to homestead the west bank of the Susquehanna, which activities drew the interest of Lord Baltimore's agents. Settlement in this area was recent, as immigrants arrived from Europe for the religious freedom promised by William Penn, or because reports of a fruitful land where one could own instead of rent had reached relatives back in Europe, and others time enough having passed since the colony was founded for over two generations to growmoved into the lush region from other areas. For a time, Lord Baltimore used Cresap to run off settlers from the Pennsylvania side, as the two provinces argued over the boundary between them. The ferry was sited just north of the mid-river islands of the Conejohela Flats region, since flooded by a lake created by a dam on the river. Their ownership was disputed due to a mistake in the charter of the Province of Pennsylvania. The river came to be the political boundary between the unsettled lands of the two counties. Development of the ferry led to the growth of towns around both landings: present-day Columbia (first called Wright's Ferry by pioneers in the area) on the eastern shore and Wrightsville on the western. In Columbia, the ferry landing was located immediately south of the present-day Columbia- Wrightsville Veterans Memorial Bridge. Route 462, the Lincoln Highway, now passes through this area. Founding father Wright's Ferry Mansion John Wright was a Quaker who first came to the area in 1724 to explore the land and preach to the local Native Americans. He moved his family to a plot 100 yards from the left bank in 1726, establishing a small settlement along with Robert Barber and Samuel Blunston. In 1730, he was granted a patent to operate a ferry across the river. He developed the ferry with the aid of his two friends. Wright also built a ferry house and a tavern on the eastern shore of the Susquehanna, and the town grew up around it. The tavern has been preserved and is designated as a historic site. It is north of present-day Locust Street, on Front Street along the river, in present-day Columbia. The two- story log tavern, operated by John Wright, Jr. until 1834, consisted of a large room on either end connected by a passageway. When John Jr. married, he moved to York County’s western shore at Wright's Ferry West (later named Wrightsville), where he built another ferry house and tavern. In later years, John Wright senior became involved in local governmental affairs. He rented his original ferry to others for operating and eventually sold it. In 1729, after Wright had petitioned William Penn’s son to create a new county, the provincial government took land from Chester County to establish Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, the fourth county in the colony of Pennsylvania. County residents, Native Americans and colonists alike, regularly traveled to Wright’s home to file papers and claims, seek government assistance and redress of issues, and register land deeds. During this time, the town was called “Wright’s Ferry.” In 1738, his son James Wright built a fine house for his family. It is now known as the Wright’s Ferry Mansion and is the oldest existing house in Columbia. The structure can still be seen at Second and Cherry Streets. (This structure is not the house of James-it is the house of Susanna Wright ) Ferry operations Traffic heading west from Lancaster, Philadelphia, and other nearby towns regularly traveled through Wright's Ferry, using the ferry to cross the river. As traffic flow increased, the ferry business expanded. Wright used canoes, rafts, and flatboats. In the early 19th century, steamboats were developed that could handle the river. The flatboats were large enough to carry Conestoga wagons and other large vehicles. Due to the volume of traffic, however, wagons, freight, supplies and people often became backed-up in the river town, with waiting periods of several days to cross the river. With 150 to 200 vehicles typically lined up on the Columbia side, ferrymen used chalk to number the wagons. =Fee structure= The early ferry consisted of two dugout canoes, made in the style of Native Americans, fastened together and carrying a carriage and wagon wheels. When numerous cattle were moved, the canoeist guided a lead animal into the water, holding on by a rope, so that the others would follow. If the lead animal became confused and started swimming in circles, however, the other animals followed until they tired and eventually drowned. During the years of operation, transport technology improved. Eventually there were water vessels that could convey even the heavy Conestoga wagons. These were being built in this era in Conestoga, Pennsylvania on the west bank of the river. *Typical fares were as follows: Coach with four passengers and drawn by five horses-9 shillings, 4-horse wagon-3 shillings and 9 pence, man and horse-6 pence. Fares were reduced in 1787 due to competition from Anderson's Ferry, located further upriver near Marietta, Pennsylvania. In later years, Wright rented the ferry to others and eventually sold it. Due to increased competition from the railroad in the late 19th century, and construction of a railroad bridge over the Susquehanna, the ferry finally ceased operations in 1901. This reduced traffic and associated business in Columbia.

Elevation is with of shoreline and covering . Activities in the Lake Pillsbury Recreation Area include powerboating, fishing, swimming, sailing, picnicking, hiking and hang gliding. There are two main access roads to the lake. At the north end of the lake is a small gravel airstrip. Over 400 homes including National Forest Recreational Residences ring this beautiful recreational lake.  History  In 1906, W.W. Van Arsdale formed the Eel River Power and Irrigation Company and contracted with the city of Ukiah for a hydroelectric generating station to increase electricity supply for the city. A diversion dam was built on the Eel River and a mile-long tunnel was constructed to divert water into the Russian River. A powerhouse was constructed in Potter Valley. It was called the Potter Valley Project or Eel River Project. Later that year, the Snow Mountain Water and Power Company incorporated and took over the project from Van Arsdale's company. By 1908 water was being diverted to the power plant and then to the Russian River. Part two of the project was building the dam which created Lake Pillsbury, located upstream. Scott Dam was completed in 1921 as a concrete gravity structure, 138 feet high, 805 feet long at its crest, and impounding a maximum capacity of 86,400 acre-feet. It maintains water flow to the hydroelectric plant during times of low water runoff. Pacific Gas and Electric Company acquired the project in 1933, and maintains the facilities today. The lake is named for one of the founders of Snow Mountain Water and Power Company. The Pillsbury hydroelectric plant is the only one in the north coast region of California operated by PG&E.; The Eel River Project is now known as the Potter Valley Project. In 1969, performers Jack Haley and Jackie Gleason purchased the Fuller Ranch and created the Pillsbury Ranch subdivision.Ukiah Daily Journal, August 29, 1969  Recreation  There are five campgrounds, two group campgrounds, two paved boat ramps and a resort at the lake. The Lake Pillsbury Resort operates a marina with rentals, boat slips and supplies. All types of boating are allowed, including boat camping. California Department of Fish and Game stock the lake with trout annually. Other fish include black bass, steelhead, and pikeminnow. The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) has developed a safe eating advisory for Lake Pillsbury based on levels of mercury or PCBs found in fish caught from this water body. Hiking trails at the lake include an interpretive nature trail at Sunset Campground and the Lake Shore Loop Trail. Other nearby recreational opportunities include the Snow Mountain Wilderness located east of Lake Pillsbury. The Bloody Rock historic area is located within the wildlife refuge north of the lake as well as the Eel River and the Wild and Scenic Black Butte River. Wildlife Tule elk herd at Lake Pillsbury #71 Dry Creek Fire District truck at Lake Pillsbury The tule elk is one of the largest land mammals native to California, with cows weighing up to 350 pounds, and the largest bulls weighing roughly 500 pounds. Hunted to near extinction during the California Gold Rush era, the animals were reintroduced to the Lake Pillsbury Basin in the late 1970s by the California Department of Fish and Game, and the herd has steadily grown, numbering around 80 in 2007. The elk live on the north shore of the lake at the bottom of Hull Mountain, and enjoy wild clovers and grasses, along with the green summer and fall foliage around Lake Pillsbury's edges. Mendocino National Forest and Los Padres National Forest are the only two national forests in California to have tule elk. There is a ten-day hunting season beginning on the second Wednesday in September each year.

Harker is from Raymond, Alberta, Canada. After five seasons as a Head Coach in the British Basketball League, Harker most recently coached the Edmonton Energy of the International Basketball League. Raymond High School Harker led the Raymond Comets to three straight Alberta Schools Athletic Association 4A (unlimited enrollment) Provincial Silver Medals (1993–1995), including a controversial 1995 4A final game versus Lester B. Pearson High School, in which one referee counted the winning basket, and the other waved it off. CTV Calgary and Sports @ 11 Highlights concluded the ball was on the backboard before the buzzer sounded. The correct call would have given the Comets their first provincial crown since Richard Bohne led the Comets to the 1989 title. Raymond, population 3,674, has a long history of excellence in athletics and a reputation of winning versus Alberta's largest schools from Calgary and Edmonton. This reputation includes producing tough, hard-nosed players, like Harker. NCAA Harker attended the University of Oregon. The Pac-10 featured 25 future NBA players in the 1999 season, including standouts Baron Davis, Matt Barnes, Jason Terry, Richard Jefferson, Mark Madsen, Brian Scalabrine, Eddie House, Todd MacCulloch and Oregon Ducks teammate and Harkers college roommate, Fred Jones. Harker played for Ducks head coach Ernie Kent, and assistant coaches Greg Graham (former Boise State University head coach) and Don Newman (present San Antonio Spurs assistant coach). The Ducks ended the 1999 regular season with a 40 RPI but were left out the NCAA Tournament due to finishing fifth behind four nationally ranked Pac-10 teams; Stanford, Arizona, UCLA, and Washington. As a result, the Ducks advanced to the National Invitational Tournament Final Four. An injury sustained by Harker during a 92-63 win versus Brigham Young University six games into the season limited his productivity, and forced him from being sixth man and potential starter into a reserve role. Harker chose to play and help the team as he was not made aware by the coaching staff that an NCAA Medical Red Shirt would have saved his eligibility and season. Harker managed 15 points versus St. Martins and was named Player of the Game, and 10 points versus Washington State Cougars, six points and a team high eight rebounds versus University of Washington Huskies in what proved to be his best Pacific-10 conference weekend. Professional career =Birmingham Bullets= After playing two season's in US minor leagues NABL and IBA and one in Germany, Harker signed 2-year contract to play for the Birmingham Bullets of the British Basketball League. http://www.bbl.org.uk During is second season with the Bullets Harker averaged just under 19 points and 7.9 rebounds, with his 668 points good for 6th in the league, and finished 9th in rebounding. He also added 3.1 assists per game, which ranked in the BBL's top 15. During the 2005-2006 season while playing for the Bullets during a match with Newcastle Eagles, Harker and Eagles player/head coach Fabulous Flournoy became involved in an on-court fight in which Fabulous swung from behind Harker punching Harker in the head, which resumed in the locker rooms post- game. https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/basketball-player-coaches- await-penalties-for-fracas-520057.html%3famp Both Harker and Flournoy were banned one (Harker) and five (Flournoy) games. Flournoy's ban was later reduced to three games. Police were informed about the incident and an investigation into Flournoy took place. During the summers of 2005 and 2006 the Bullets became the first professional basketball club from Britain to tour China competing against Chinese Basketball Association clubs during the 'UK/China Basketball Friendship Tour'. Over the two summers Harker led the Bullets to 13 wins and 11 losses. Harker scored a professional career high of 44 points versus the Shandong Lions in 2006. Harker left Birmingham prior to the 2006 season after the franchise was forced into liquidation- after a two year arena rental dispute with the City of Birmingham. After a strong season and summer the Canadian Senior Men's National Team invited Harker to their training camp. =Worcester Wolves= He returned to the British Basketball League as the player-coach of BBL franchise Worcester Wolves in July 2007. After a four wins and 36 losses season in 2006/07 Harker led the club to 20 wins and 20 losses and the BBL Trophy Semi-Finals in his first season at the helm in 07/08.

The 2008/09 season was the first season ever to see three BBL clubs in the Eurobasket Top 100, with Newcastle and Everton both in the top 75 at one stage. The Wolves fell out of the playoff race after losing former NCAA assists leader William Funn (Portland State) and the BBL assists leader at the time, for the season as the club was in a playoff position. Following a very successful two-year stint as the Wolves head coach-player, in which Harker averaged 16 points and 8 rebounds, he opted to return to the club as strictly a professional player for the 2009/10 season. Harker's list of BBL recruits includes Jeff Bonds (Birmingham 2005/06) who went on to become BBL Co-MVP in 2006/07. Prior to the 2007 season Skouson recruited BBL All-Star, Slam Dunk Champ and BBL leading scorer Anthony Paez (Worcester 2007–08). Yorick Williams also led the BBL in scoring after being recruited to play for Harker (Birmingham 2005/06). Former All-Pac-10 performer Dino Tanner of Oregon State was recruited by Harker to the Bullets. Harker also brought in former Euroleague http://www.euroleague.com assists leader and former CSKA Moscow point guard Chuck Evans to the Wolves for the 2007–08 season.

After an injury-riddled college career, Harker never missed a professional game due to injury. =Edmonton Energy= After being an All-Star for the past two IBL seasons, Harker was named the Head Coach of the Edmonton Energy in March 2011. Harker was named International Basketball League All-Star for the second consecutive season in August 2010 after helping the Edmonton Energy and Coach Paul Sir to finishing Runner-up in the Continental Division. Harker signed for German team SC Rist Wedel in August 2010. During spring 2009 the 6'9\\" (205 cm) 240 lb Harker played for Coach Paul Sir and the Edmonton Energy of the International Basketball League. The Energy won the 2009 Regular Season Championship with a 17-3 record. Harker was named a 2009 IBL All-Star with a well rounded 18.5 ppg and 8.3 rpg playing all 21 games. The forward scored 32 points versus the Vancouver Titans, as well as 34 points versus the Oregon Wave. Controversy Harker continued with the Worcester-based club until 2010. A week prior to his departure, both Harker and Evaldas Zabas were named to the BBL Team of the Week. A week later Head Coach Chuck Evans' racist rant during a film session forced six Wolves players to refuse to play for the coach, as the club wanted to keep the 'incident quite' and not fire the coach. Coach Evans' resigned. Numerous teachers and fans wrote in to the Worcester News to show their support for their fired Wolves players, making it the Worcester News' most commented story within 2009. The community of Worcester schools, both pupils and teachers, as well as many concerned fans and citizens wrote to the newspaper and rallied around the six sacked players; all to no avail as the Wolves Owner Roger Clarke refused to let the players back on the team, even after the coach had resigned. Harker's two-year stint as Head Coach at the Wolves has been said to have saved the Wolves from relegation back down to England's 2nd Division. Additionally Harker's tenor may have put the club in a position to hire current England National Team Head Coach Paul James, as well a move forward with the new Worcester Arena. Without the conviction and principle of which the sacked Wolves players demonstrated, the club would have never been in a position to hire Coach James.

Research at the University addresses some of the problems faced by the agricultural, fisheries, forestry and tourism industries of Papua New Guinea. Brief History The University established in 1965 as Vudal Agricultural College (VAC), a male only college of the then Department of Agriculture, Stock and Fisheries. The first female students were enrolled ten years later, in 1975. As such it can claim to be the oldest institution of tertiary education in PNG. The college offered a two-year certificate and three year diploma training in Tropical Agriculture and made significant contributions to agricultural education and rural development in Papua New Guinea and neighbouring South Pacific countries. In 1992, VAC was merged with Papua New Guinea University of Technology. Five years later, the college became University of Vudal, an autonomous higher education institution through an Act of Parliament that was passed in January 1997. In 1999, under inaugural Vice Chancellor Professor Walter Wong, a four-year Bachelor of Tropical Agriculture degree programme was introduced and the certificate program was phased out. In 2005, the University Council, under the chancellorship of former Prime Minister and present Governor of New Ireland, Sir Julius Chan, unanimously directed that the University change its name and begin the process of internationalising from a one discipline University to a multi-disciplined one. The name Papua New Guinea University of Natural Resources and Environment and logo was chosen from a public name and logo competition to promote a new training focus - training in the sound management and harvesting of natural renewable resources. While council endorsed these changes then, the Name Change Bill was passed in Parliament four years later, on May 13, 2009. Following the resignation of Sir Julius as chancellor in 2007, another former prime minister, Sir Rabbie Namaliu, was endorsed by council as the university's third chancellor. Sir Rabbie, a distinguished statesman, served as chancellor until he resigned in January 2011. The university's first female chancellor, Margaret L. Elias, was appointed by council at the 50th Council meeting on September 30, 2011. The university's inaugural chancellor was the late Sir Alan Tololo. The chancellor of UNRE was Professor Kenneth Sumbuk, he was appointed in October 2017. However, he resigned from UNRE and moved to UPNG as VC in 2019 but his appointment was blocked following a staff protest.

It is the westernmost island of the thirteen island groups that make up island chain in the archipelago. It is an island of volcanic origin encircled by a coral reef with a maximum height of three meters (10 feet) above sea level. The people living on the island speak the Wuvulu-Aua language, a Western Admiralty Islands language, which is of Austronesian stock. The first sighting by Europeans of Wuvulu Island was by the Spanish navigator Iñigo Órtiz de Retes on 27 July 1545 when on board of the carrack San Juan tried to return from Tidore to New Spain. He charted this island together with the nearby islands, Aua and Manu, as La Barbada (the bearded island in Spanish).Coello, Francisco \\"Conflicto hispano-alemán\\" Boletín de Sociedad Geográfica de Madrid, t.XIX. 2º semestre 1885, Madrid, p.317.Sharp, Andrew The discovery of the Pacific Islands Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1960, p.31. Wuvulu Island was part of German New Guinea until the First World War. During German times, the island was purchased by the German Administration, which excluded from the purchase three areas for ‘native reserves’. Two of these reserves were at the western end of the Island and the third was at the eastern end. The latter area was known as Ruvuraue (230 hectares, 568 acres). In 1907 the German Administration transferred the property known as Agita (800 hectares, 2170 acres) to Rudolph Wahlen – the property was all of the island with the exception of the three reserves. The German Administration, however, also gave a restricted occupancy to Wahlen over Ruvuraue Reserve. In 1912 the area known as Ruvuraue appears to have been transferred to Rudolph Wahlen. This was apparently in return for the granting to the local people of certain rights to taro pits on the properties. The reserve aspect of this land would have been extinguished by this action. Both titles were made the subject of encumbrances relating to mining and to transfer back to the Administration for landing places and other public purposes. After the First World War the title vested in the custodian of expropriated property. In 1928 a draft certificate of title was issued in respect of both parties.

During his career he played for HFC Haarlem. He was a passenger on Surinam Airways Flight PY764 when it crashed in Paramaribo on 7 June 1989. He died three days later, at 21 years of age, due to his injuries suffered in the crash. He went to the same high school as Steve van Dorpel, who also died in the crash. Linger was born in Paramaribo, but grew up in Amsterdam, in the Bijlmer area. He started his football career at amateur side FC Abcoude and later at JOS Watergraafsmeer where he would play until he was 16 years old. His next step up to a professional career was joining the youth squads of HFC Haarlem. His dream came true after he was promoted into the first-team squad and he made his professional debut. He was invited by Colourful 11 founder Sonny Hasnoe to be part of the team travelling to Suriname to play in the \\"Boxel Kleurrijk Tournament\\" against three Surinamese teams. His friend, AFC Ajax goalkeeper Stanley Menzo, was also called up, but was told to stay with his club. Menzo, however, ignored this edict and went as well, taking an earlier flight. On 7 June 1989 Surinam Airways Flight PY764 crashed during approach to Paramaribo-Zanderij International Airport, killing 176 of the 187 passengers on board, making it the worst ever aviation disaster in Suriname's history. Among those killed were 15 members of the 18-member Colourful 11 contingent. Linger initially survived the crash, but could barely be identified at the hospital. On 10 June 1989, three days after the accident, Linger died of his injuries. His identity was later confirmed by his uncle and Stanley Menzo, who recognized his leg muscles and his jaw line. In the following days Linger's relatives were supported by Dick Advocaat, who was his manager at HFC Haarlem and who had a close friendship with his mother.

He was an associate professor at Val-de-Grâce, as well as medical inspector general with the French Army. Later he attained the chair of epidemiology at Collège de France. Vincent is credited with the discovery of the organisms that cause an acute infection of the oral soft tissues, including the tonsils and pharynx. This condition is caused by the combination of the fusiform bacilli (Bacillus fusiformis), and the spirochete (Borrelia vincentii). Today, this disease is called Vincent's angina in honor of his discovery. It is sometimes referred to as trench mouth or Vincent's gingivitis. He is also remembered for his work with vaccines, and his successful inoculations of the French Army against typhoid fever and paratyphoid fever, types A and B. He started these vaccinations in 1910, and they were continued during World War I. Marshals Joseph Joffre (1852–1931) and Ferdinand Foch (1851–1929) paid homage to Vincent and his medical work that saved countless lives.

It was originally published as the English Version for the Deaf (EVD) by BakerBooks. Deaf readers sometimes struggle with reading English because sign language is their first language. The World Bible Translation Center (WBTC) decided to do a translation that would make reading the Bible easier for them. The EVD uses simpler vocabulary and shorter sentences to make it simpler to understand. Ervin Bishop did most of the translating for the WBTC. He used a thought-for- thought or functional equivalence method of translation. It was found to be useful for others who struggle with reading and is often used in prisons and literacy programs. The ERV uses the Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia (1984) as its Old Testament text with some readings from the Dead Sea Scrolls. Also, it follows the Septuagint when its readings are considered more accurate. (The Septuagint is the ancient Greek translation of the Hebrew scriptures.) For the New Testament, the ERV uses the United Bible Societies' Greek New Testament (fourth revised edition, 1993) and Nestle-Aland Novum Testament Graece (twenty-seventh edition, 1993). The ERV caused controversy in the Churches of Christ (the WBTC is an outreach of the Churches of Christ). Goebel Music wrote a book critiquing this translation titled \\"Easy-to-Read Version: Easy to Read or Easy to Mislead?\\", criticizing the ERV's method of translation, textual basis, and wording of certain passages. In 2004, a major revision of the ERV was finished. It used broader vocabulary and greater use of gender-inclusive language. The EVD was left unchanged, so it and the ERV now have different texts.

Very small in stature, but tough and hard at the ball, Hulme played primarily as a midfielder and/or tagger with stints in the forward-line. His kicking was the biggest deficiency in his game, but this improved as his career progressed. When he arrived at the club, both his playing style and his hairstyle were similar to that of ten-year veteran Fraser Brown; Brown's nickname had been \\"Dog\\", and Hulme accordingly received the nickname \\"Pup\\", which stayed with him throughout his time at Carlton.Blueseum, Darren Hulme, Retrieved 25 April 2011. Hulme played eight games in his debut season. He went on to be a solid contributor for Carlton over a career spanning eight years, including a fifth-placing in the 2003 Best and Fairest, and tying with Craig Bradley and Adrian Hickmott for the Peter Sullivan Memorial Trophy (most votes in the Brownlow Medal by a Carlton player) in 2001. His career was plagued by injury: a quadriceps injury ruled him out of the 1999 finals series, a knee injury meant he could only play the first 3 games of 2002 and he missed the second half of the 2004 season with a groin injury.

Plot The serial is based on a girl named Simran, an orphan who has been brought up by her aunt and uncle. They are everything to her, therefore she believes that whatever they choose for her will be for the best. When Simran goes for an arranged marriage, she marries Ruhaan, who belongs to one of the wealthiest families in the city. However, on the day of her marriage, Ruhaan reveals that he loves someone else. This brings Simran at a crossroads where she can't go back to her house because her uncle is a cardiac patient, nor she can move forward with what Ruhaan told her. Like a traditional Indian woman, Simran decides to abide by her responsibilities as a wife, daughter and daughter-in-law of Ruhaan's prestigious Oberoi family. She decides to fight against the shadow of her husband's past and get her husband back. When Ruhaan and Simran go to Goa for their honeymoon, he learns that the girl he loves is married to someone else. Now, he tries to change and starts having feelings for Simran. After a few very predictable misunderstandings, Simran and Ruhaan are reunited. Suhana, Ruhaan's former love, returns and tries to win him back. She conspires against Simran to make Ruhaan's family hate her but after a while, her plans are exposed. Suhana, in a fit of rage, shoots at Simran and Ruhaan, who stumbles off a cliff. Unfortunately, Simran dies but Ruhaan is saved by a girl named Sargam (the new protagonist), who takes him to her home. However, Ruhaan has lost his memory and does not remember anything about Simran or his past. Ruhaan starts living with this new family. Sargam will marry Vedant, her childhood friend, but begins to grow feelings for Ruhaan and eventually marries the latter. He, however, tells Sargam that until he regains his memory, he will not consummate their marriage. One day, Ruhaan finally remembers everything when he sees his father Naresh. Eventually, Ruhaan returns to Oberoi house with Naresh and Sargam, but remains haunted and tormented by memories of Simran.

Using this service, people could design their own Lego models using a computer program, then upload them to the Lego website, design their own box design, and order them for actual delivery. The brand also covers a small selection of products that have been designed by Lego fans, and which were available to purchase as a set. System Lego Design byME was created for people to build and experiment with virtual Lego bricks. This is done on a program called Lego Digital Designer. Models are uploaded to Design byME on the Lego website, and creations can either be shared with the world in the gallery or purchased as a custom Lego set. =Pricing= When purchasing models from Lego Design byME, the price was significantly high compared to store-bought Lego sets, leading consumers to believe that the prices were unreasonable. However, the price was divided into a few different parts. These are listed below: * A service fee, which includes the handpicking of bricks and producing a custom made box. * The cost of the bricks, which is based on the amount as well as the types of bricks in the model. * Standard shipping fees. * The optional building guide does not produce any additional fee. Design byME did not accept returns due to its classification as a custom service. Lego Digital Designer As part of the Design byME service, Lego has produced a computer program called Lego Digital Designer, which allows people to design a virtual Lego model using a selection of virtual Lego bricks. These models can be saved locally, as well as uploaded to the Lego website for sharing and ordering as a physical product. Discontinuation of service In late 2011, Lego announced that it would discontinue its Design byME service in its current form forcing people to buy Lego models that are designed by the developers or build their models from scratch. As of January 16, 2012, models created in Lego Digital Designer can no longer be purchased directly as Lego Design byME sets. This does not affect the HERO Recon Team Hero Creator range of products. Lego has confirmed that it will continue Lego Digital Designer as a free design software, and it will also keep its Pick-a-Brick service operational.

Some of the music in this series was performed by The Youngbloods.

It is about the relationship between Peter Pan creator J. M. Barrie and the Llewelyn Davies boys. Plot Novelist and playwright James Barrie (Ian Holm) meets the two oldest Davies boys, George and Jack, during outings with their nurse Mary Hodgson (Anna Cropper) in Kensington Gardens. He entertains them, especially George, with his fantasy stories, some of which include a magical young boy who shares a name with their infant brother Peter. Barrie and his wife Mary (Maureen O'Brien) meet the boys' parents Sylvia (Ann Bell) and Arthur (Tim Pigott- Smith) at a dinner party, and he forms a friendship with the mother and her sons. The Barries and Davies socialize, but Mary and Arthur each quietly resent Barrie: Mary for neglecting her, and Arthur for imposing upon his family. Sylvia and Arthur have two more sons, Michael and Nico, whom Barrie adds to his circle of young friends. He writes a play inspired by them: Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up, which is a great success for him and his producer friend Charles Frohman (William Hootkins). Arthur is struck by a disfiguring and ultimately fatal cancer. Barrie steps in to support the Davies family, attempting to be a friend to Arthur in his final days but alienating Jack with his interference. With George away at school, sensitive Michael becomes the centre of 'Uncle Jim's' attention. Tired of her husband's indifference toward her, Mary falls in love and has an affair with Barrie's young colleague Gilbert Cannan (Brian Stirner). When Barrie finds out, Mary refuses to end the affair, and he reluctantly grants her a divorce. Meanwhile, Sylvia has fallen ill with cancer, and dies a few years after her husband. Barrie claims they were engaged. The boys continue to live in the Davies's London house with Mary Hodgson, and Barrie becomes their guardian, following Sylvia's wishes. As the years go by, George becomes an adult confidant to Barrie, while Jack joins the Navy. When World War I breaks out, George and Peter enlist. George is later killed in combat. Jack returns to London to marry. Barrie gives the newlywed the Davies's house, and Michael and Nico move in with him in his flat which prompts Mary Hodgson to resign. Peter returns from the War with a morbid outlook on death. Michael spends increasing time with his school friends and chafes at Barries's desire to keep him close; he drowns short of his 21st birthday. In later years, Barrie suffers loneliness but takes some measure of enjoyment in the company of the young son of his secretary, Lady Cynthia Asquith (Sheila Ruskin). Cast *J. M.

Wishing to spend more time with Farrow, Birkin 'justified [his] presence on the set by becoming the resident Barrie expert.'Birkin, Andrew. J. M. Barrie and the Lost Boys, Yale University Press, 2003. His proposal to the BBC was based on his notes from that research. Birkin worked closely with Nicholas Llewelyn Davies, the youngest and last survivor of the five brothers, and his script adheres closely to the known facts and timeline of the Barries' and the Davies's lives, sometimes using surviving correspondence between the subjects as the basis for dialogue. Reception The Lost Boys was first aired on BBC-2 television in three weekly 90-minute episodes, beginning 11 October 1978. Reviews were highly favourable. The critic Sean Day-Lewis wrote in The Daily Telegraph, 'I doubt if biography has ever been better televised than in this sensitive and beautifully crafted masterpiece, and I am quite sure such excellence is beyond any other television service in the world. ... The entire House of Commons should be required to view it before voting on the proposed increase in BBC funding.'The Daily Telegraph, 30 October 1978 Janet Dunbar (Barrie's 1971 biographer) called it 'a brilliant achievement ... a classic in the television medium - one of the finest pieces of television drama I have ever seen. ... I had the experience of watching, not Ian Holm playing J M Barrie, but Barrie himself ... the definitive recreation of J M Barrie in dramatic terms.'The Listener, 26 October 1978 Nancy Banks-Smith wrote in The Guardian: 'Andrew Birkin's convincing and compelling biographical trilogy is most beautifully and sensitively done. ... There is a nice ambivalence about The Lost Boys as there is about The Turn of the Screw, an ambiguity and sense of menace. A delightful frightfulness. The rich sets, the allusive, elusive script which always suggests more than it says. ... The Lost Boys is a gift, a present, a parabola of pleasure to me, something to be unwrapped and tasted and rewrapped and saved until later.'The Guardian, 12 October 1978 Michael Church wrote in The Times: 'Andrew Birkin's superb and haunting trilogy ... something quite out of the ordinary ... Desire, devotion, disease and death loom out in disturbingly intimate close up. ... Ian Holm, physically Barrie to the life, rules absolutely.'The Times, 19 October 1978 Chris Dunkley wrote in the Financial Times, 'It is only very rarely that a television drama comes along in which every constituent manages to provide a flawless contribution. The Lost Boys has been such a production.'The Financial Times, 25 October 1978 The film was cited in several annual round-ups, including Benny Green in Punch: 'Best Original Drama: The Lost Boys, which advanced from competence to brilliance to deep compassion and mastery of touch, and which, for intensity of characterization and economy of writing, was a masterpiece of the televisual form.'Punch, 20 December 1978 In the Daily Mail, Elisabeth Cowley voted 'My Pick of the Year: For sheer delicacy, The Lost Boys. A lovely, disturbing production, not quite of this world - indeed, no more of this world than the bewitched and lonely writer at its heart. Ian Holm never put a foot wrong in his stunning portrayal of J M Barrie.'Daily Mail, 30 December 1978 The BBC’s Director-General Sir Ian Trethowan called it 'a landmark in television drama'.The Guardian, 6 November 1978 The BBC published the full scripts when the series was repeated in 1980, The Spectator calling them 'a priceless addition to a corpus of literature of coherent television drama.'The Spectator, 1 March 1980 Awards *Won: 1979 BAFTA (Best Television Lighting, Sam Barclay) *Nominated: 1979 BAFTA (Best Actor, Ian Holm) *Nominated: 1979 BAFTA (Best Film Cameraman, Elmer Cossey) *Nominated: 1979 BAFTA (Best VTR Editor, Charles Huff) *Won: 1979 Royal Television Society (Best Design, Barry Newbery) *Won: 1979 Royal Television Society (Best Performance, Ian Holm) *Won: 1979 Royal Television Society (Best Writer, Andrew Birkin) See also * List of works based on Peter Pan References External links  _The Lost Boys_ screenplay Category:1978 films Category:Llewelyn Davies family Category:Biographical films about writers Category:British biographical films Category:British films Category:Cultural depictions of J.

As of 2006 it was berthed in Hoboken, New Jersey. In mid-2013, the ferry was moved to the Henry Street pier in the Gowanus Bay Terminal in Red Hook, Brooklyn. Operational history Described as unusually luxurious for a day-voyaging vessel,Historic ferry owner will go from ship to shore, The Villager, Volume 73, Number 29 (19–25 November 2003). Yankee was built in 1907 by the Philadelphian shipbuilding company Neafie & Levy for the Casco Bay and Harpswell Line. There is some confusion about her original name, with some sources listing it as Dida. It is unclear however, if the ship ever operated under that name, since she is commonly referred to as Machigonne from an early point in her career. Machigonne began her service life ferrying passengers between Portland, Maine and the Calendar Islands in Casco Bay. In 1913, she was sold to the Nahant Steamship Line of Boston, Massachusetts, and used on the Boston, Nahant and Pines Island route.Machigonne/Yankee, National Register of Historic Places Registration, pp. 6–7. Following America's entry into World War I, Machigonne was acquired by the U.S. Navy on 2 October 1917 under charter, and commissioned 15 May 1918 as USS Machigonne (SP-1043). During the war, the ship was armed with two one-pounder guns for defense, and used to transport men and supplies between Boston and Bumpkin Island Training Station. After the end of hostilities, USS Machigonne was decommissioned and resumed commercial service. In 1921, the ship was purchased by John E. Moore and transferred to New York Harbor. For the next eight years, Machigonne was used to ferry newly arriving immigrants from their incoming ships to Ellis Island, and thenceforth to the mainland. These immigrants, many of whom were kept below decks on their transatlantic voyage, are said to have obtained their first views of New York City from the decks of Machigonne. In this period, the ship was also used to ferry tourists to the Statue of Liberty. In 1929, the ship was sold to a Captain Daniel F. McAllister, and renamed Hook Mountain. For the next ten years she operated as a tour boat, carrying passengers from Battery Park to Bedloe's Island and Governors Island. Hook Mountain was sold to a Rhode Island company in 1939, and renamed Block Island. She also operated under the name League Island when requisitioned for World War II service.Neafie & Levy, shipbuildinghistory.com. In 1947, the vessel had her original steam propulsion replaced with a 900 Hp GM diesel from a LST, was renamed Yankee and used to transport vacationers from Providence to Block Island, a task that apparently continued for several decades.From an episode of the TV program World's Most Extreme Homes, see video tour in External links section. The vessel was finally retired from commercial service after the 1983 summer season which included a charter to the America's Cup Races off of Newport, RI. It was then laid up in Montville, CT for several years. It was later towed to Providence, RI and docked very close to where she used to depart from for Block Island service and was neglected and became a target for vandals. Restoration In 1990, the by-now dilapidated Yankee was bought by a private citizen, Jim Gallagher, who towed it to Pier 25, Tribeca, Manhattan, where he began working on its restoration. In an unusual arrangement, Gallagher was permitted by the local authorities to live on the boat in order to continue with his work. To help pay for the job, Gallagher rented the boat out to weddings and parties. The vessel was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Note: This includes and In 2003, Gallagher sold the boat to new owners who pledged to continue with the restoration work. In 2006 the boat was moved to Hoboken, New Jersey while the local council carried out an upgrade to Pier 25.Collector discovers early color slide of the Yankee, Downtown Express, Volume 18 • Issue 36 (20–26 January 2006) Although operational, the boat is apparently not used for actual voyages since it lacks a seaworthiness certificate. Yankee is one of several vessels built by Neafie & Levy to be either still operational or operating until very recently. Another Neafie & Levy vessel that is still operational is the tugboat Jupiter. A third vessel, the tugboat Tuff-E-Nuff (originally the Thomas Cunningham Sr.), built in 1895, was remarkably still in commercial service in its original role as of May 2007. In 2003 Yankee was bought by Richard and Victoria MacKenzie-Childs, and moved to a dock in Red Hook, Brooklyn in 2013. While interior repair and restoration work is ongoing, the ship is in need of drydock space/funding to have its hull inspected, repaired, and deemed seaworthy again. In 2018, while in drydock in Staten Island after further hull work, the Yankee was listed for sale by Franklin-Ruttan: \\"The oldest existing Ellis Island Ferry.

Midland County, 390 U.S. 474 (1968), is a United States Supreme Court case that ruled that local government districts had to be roughly equal in population.  Background  Having already held in 1965 in Reynolds v. Sims that disparities in legislative districts violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the Supreme Court applied the same logic to local government districts for bodies which also have broad policy-making functions. The case was brought by Henry Clifton Avery, Jr., more commonly known as Hank Avery, who was Mayor of the City of Midland, Texas. He challenged the districting scheme for the Commissioners Court of Midland County, a five-member county commission with four Commissioners elected in single-member districts and the County Judge elected at-large. Texas Association of Counties One Commissioner's district, which included almost all the City of Midland, had a population of 67,906, according to 1963 estimates. The others, all rural areas, had populations respectively, of about 852; 414; and 828. Avery brought his case in Texas District Court in Midland. Three of the four commissioners testified at trial that population was not a major factor in the districting process. The trial court ruled for petitioner that each district under the State's constitutional apportionment standard should have \\"substantially the same number of people.\\" An intermediate appellate court reversed. The Texas Supreme Court reversed that judgment, holding that under the Federal and State Constitutions the districting scheme was impermissible \\"for the reasons stated by the trial court.\\" It held, however, that the work actually done by the County Commissioners \\"disproportionately concerns the rural areas\\" and that such factors as \\"number of qualified voters, land areas, geography, miles of county roads, and taxable values\\" could justify apportionment otherwise than on a basis of substantially equal populations.  Opinion of the Court  The five justices who struck down local district inequality based their decision on the precedent in Reynolds v. Sims. Writing for the majority, Associate Justice Byron White said, \\"In a word, institutions of local government have always been a major aspect of our system, and their responsible and responsive operation is today of increasing importance to the quality of life of more and more of our citizens. We therefore see little difference, in terms of the application of the Equal Protection Clause and of the principles of Reynolds v. Sims, between the exercise of state power through legislatures and its exercise by elected officials in the cities, towns, and counties.\\" In dissent, Justice John Marshall Harlan II asserted that the Writ of Certiorari to the Texas Supreme Court was improvidently granted in that the decision was not final, since the Texas court had ordered the County to redistrict. He also resumed his objections to the line of cases started with Reynolds v. Sims saying, \\"I continue to think that these adventures of the Court in the realm of political science are beyond its constitutional powers, for reasons set forth at length in my dissenting opinion in Reynolds, 377 U.S., at 589 et seq.\\" Justices Fortas and Stewart agreed with Justice Harlan that the Writ of Certiorari was improvidently granted as the decision was not yet final, but disagreed as to their reasoning on the merits of the case. Justice Thurgood Marshall took no part in the deliberation of the case.

She was of the Maugas type, and the name ship of her class. Farfadet accidentally sank in July 1905 at Bizerte with the loss of 14 men of her crew; two men survived. She was later refloated and recommissioned as the Follet (Q7). She was stricken in November 1913. Design and construction Farfadet was ordered by the French Navy under its 1899 building programme, the lead ship of a class of four. She was designed by Gabriel Maugas, an early French submarine engineer, and was built at the Naval Dockyard in Rochfort. She was single-hulled, and powered by two Sautter-Harlé electric motors, with a power output of 300 cv. Farfadet was laid down in September 1899, launched on 17 May 1901, and entered service on 29 August 1902.Farfadet (Q7) at sous-marins français (archived page); retrieved 28 February 2017 Service history The submarine is remembered chiefly for the accident of 6 July 1905, off the coast of Tunisia, which killed 14 of its crew. The details of the catastrophe, once released by the press, horrified France and drew national attention to the dangers of submarines, which the French Ministry of Marine was at that time investing a great deal of money in. After the Farfadet accident and the recent British submarine disaster (June 1905), sailors began to refer to submarines as \\"iron tombs\\". On 6 July 1905, during a routine patrol en route from Sidi Abdallah to Bizerte, in Tunisia, Farfadet sank suddenly, taking 14 of her crew with her. Only two escaped, being on deck when the incident occurred. A rescue attempt failed and the crew were lost. Farfadet was raised a week later, restored and recommissioned on 17 December 1908 under the name Follet (\\"Will-o-the-wisp\\"). She remained in service for five years before being stricken in November 1913.  Name  Farfadet means \\"merry spirit\\" and is a type of sprite or goblin in French folktale. The goblin is present in the folklore of the south of France, the Vendée and Poitou.  French naval buildup  In the early 1900s the French Navy made a concerted effort to build up its submarine fleet. The Times of London on 5 April 1904 notes that \\"26 submersibles of various types\\" were being developed by its nearest neighbour, with a total of 47 on the drawing board. At this time the vessels were listed as: Submarines: Morse, Français, Algeríen, Naïade, Protée, Lynx, Ludion, Gnôme, Lutin, Loutre, Castor, Gustave Zédé, Gymnote, Perle, Esturgeon, Bonité, Thon, Sontfleur, Dorade, Farfadet, Korrigan. Submersibles: Narval, Siréne, Triton, Silure, EspadonThe Times, April 5, 1904 p7 Accident =As reported in The Times= The Times of 7 July 1905 reports that, on a routine cruise after leaving the port of Sidi Abdullah in French Tunisia, Farfadet, heading for its home port of Bizerte in Tunisia, attempted to dive with a \\"skylight\\" (hatch) improperly shut. The guard officer tried to force it closed and then, mistakenly, tried to open it and slam it shut again. The submarine had by this point submerged; the force of the water forced the hatch down in a skewed position from which it would not move. As the submarine dived the hatch was forced from its place entirely and the guard captain blown from his position by the force of the water. Four sailors in the bow were drowned, and the weight of water in the flooded forward section caused Farfadet to dip and dive straight down, where it became embedded in the mud at the bottom of the harbour.The Times, July 7, 1905, p. 10 =Alternative version= Submarine pioneer John P. Holland wrote in How To Fly Like a Bird (1906) that Farfadet had moved in such a way as to upset her ballast tank, which in turn submerged an open hatch. A similar fate was suffered by the British A8, which had spun onto its side while trying to avoid a trawler, dipping its conning tower underwater and so flooding itself, \\"excepting that in [Farfadets] case there occurred a change of speed or inclination that caused the water in her partially filled tank to move to her forward end, thus causing the common centre of gravity of the boat, and the water in its tanks, to move far enough forward to force the forward part of the boat under water. This unexpected manoeuvre, combined with her speed, forced the top of her turret under and she took enough water on board to send her to the bottom.\\" How to Fly As a Bird-John Philip Holland, 1906 =Attempted rescue and salvage= The Times of 7 July 1905 records that at 9am on 7 July, divers reached Farfadet and found that the crew were responding to knocks. Four hawser (steel) cables were wrapped around the submarine in preparation for the arrival of a 20-ton pontoon and crane, belonging to the Hersen Company. At 3.20pm the vessel was raised, its aft portion breaking the water so that airlocks could be opened and the air inside renewed for the surviving crew. Attempts were then made to ground the submarine in shallow water, but at 12.45 the next morning the crane broke, sending the submarine back to the bottom of the harbour. Further efforts to recover it, involving the French steamer Audax, were in vain. On 15 July 1905, Farfadet was raised using a floating dock and towed to the harbour of Sidi Abdallah. That night work began on removing the bodies. The four in the forward compartment had died instantly, the eight aft when the crane had broken. It was found that the sailors had attempted to plug the airholes with their tunics. Two more bodies were found amidships. It was found that the sulfuric acid of the engine's accumulators (batteries) had combined with the seawater to create hydrochloric acid, which had eaten away the instruments and bodies and made work on retrieval impossible until ventilators had been fitted to the aft of the vessel. The last of the crew had died after being trapped for 32 hours. Eight of the 14 crew were from Brittany.Le Petit Journal, July 29, 1905 References * External links *Farfadet (Q7) at sous-marins français Marc Castel (archived page) (French) Category:Farfadet-class submarines Category:Ships built in France Category:1901 ships Category:French submarine accidents Category:Maritime incidents in 1905 Category:Shipwrecks in the Mediterranean ","title":"French submarine Farfadet (Q7)"},{"id":"12270697","text":"Spin Khak is a village in Pabbi Tehsil of Nowshera District of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.

Cole Harris, Geoffrey J. Matthews, Historical Atlas of Canada: From the beginning to 1800, p. 86 or St. Mary's of Ganantaa) was a 17th- century French Jesuit mission located in the middle of the Onondaga nation of the Haudenosaunee/Iroquois. It was located on Onondaga Lake near modern-day Syracuse, New York. The original mission was in use only from 1656 to 1658. A modern replica is in operation as a museum and interpretive center. It is open between May and October as a \\"living history\\" project, with costumed interpreters on weekends during the Summer. Sainte Marie among the Iroquois is a living history museum and part of the Onondaga County parks system, and is therefore designated as a municipal park itself. The site, while county-owned, is operated by volunteers who provide all of the programming and maintain the displays. The site is currently being renovated and the interior of the fort is closed. Museum The interpretive center/museum is a two-story building which houses some of Onondaga County Park's collection of artifacts. Inside visitors can see exhibits and is able to schedule tours for all age groups. A gift shop is also inside on the first floor. Mission Reed hut encampment. The Mission itself is located behind the museum and accessed by using the second floor doors. There is a small encampment between the museum and mission site where reed huts stand. The Haudenosaunee and French used encampments like this as camp sites when traveling. They were located in between traveling paths, roughly a days hike from each other. The Mission itself is surrounded by a high palisade and contains a chapel, refectory (dining hall), dormitory (sleeping area), workshops (carpentry and blacksmith), and pens for animals. Outside the palisade are gardens (vegetable and herb) and a baking oven. History =Establishment= Chapel inside the mission palisade. The Jesuits built the mission at the invitation of the Onondaga nation of the Iroquois Confederation. The Iroquois Confederation was also known as the Iroquois League previously. Due to ongoing warfare between the Mohawks and French in Quebec, the Onondagas were anxious to broker peace between the two parties. The French built a stockade and a few buildings overlooking Onondaga Lake (Ganantaa in Iroquois). In addition to the Jesuit missionaries and their Doneé servants/tradesmen, a contingent of French Coureur des bois (Runners of the Wood) were sent to defend the mission. =Abandonment= After two years, the Mohawks threatened to attack the mission, and a new French Governor lost interest in the project. The entire group fled safely in 1658. No further missions in Iroquois territory were attempted by the French. Reconstructed mission and museum =The French \\"Fort\\"= In the 1930s, a replica of Sainte Marie de Ganentaa was built on a bluff overlooking Onondaga Lake as part of the Works Progress Administration/WPA program. However, a \\"wild west\\" style fort was built instead of a more historically accurate French mission. It is believed this is due to a passing reference to a \\"French fort\\" that a French war expedition, led by Louis de Buade de Frontenac, had built in 1696 on the shore of Onondaga Lake. This \\"fort\\" was just an encampment of tents with a small palisade around it and was only occupied for about two weeks. The site that the new \\"French fort\\" was built upon was close to the original location since the original was covered by the parking lot of LeMoyne Manor. Starting in the 1970s it was run by Onondaga County Parks with costumed interpreters who portrayed the French and Haudenosaunee who had lived there. The style of interpretation was 3rd-person, meaning that the people portraying the characters dressed like the characters they represented, but spoke of them in the third person (Third-person). An Onondaga man spears one of the once- plentiful eels from an elm-bark canoe in a display at the Sainte Marie Mission Interpretive Center =Museum redesign= In the early 1990s a redesign of the \\"Fort\\" was executed. The entire site was rebuilt to match more closely what the original French mission was like. Money was raised along with grants, such as from the LWCF (Land and Water Conservation Fund), to fund the massive undertaking. The design was planned using research gathered from the Jesuit Relations, other first-hand accounts, and the design of Sainte Marie's sister mission - Sainte Marie among the Hurons. While the more historically accurate mission site was much smaller than the \\"French Fort\\", an interpretive center/museum was also built. This allowed Sainte Marie to have a variety of displays about Native and French culture ca. 1650. =Closing and reopening of the museum= By the early 2000s Sainte Marie was closed. This was due to waning public attendance (due to the mission never changing its programming) and budget cuts. However, a dedicated grassroots movement began to petition for the re-opening of the site. The Friends of Historic Onondaga Lake (FoHOL) formed as a non-profit volunteer based fund-raising organization that offered to run the site for the county. In 2004 Onondaga County Parks formed an agreement with FoHOL that the organization's volunteers would run the site, provide programming, and raise money to fund such endeavours. In return the County would allow the use of the facility, access to the museum's collection, and provide utilities/maintenance. The volunteers worked to replace the displays, some of which had been moved to other museums, and redesign the layout. It was also decided that the interpretive aspect of the museum would become 3rd-person. This allowed the volunteers, and the museum itself, to have some latitude in providing tours to the public. It meant that the tour guides could discuss what happened after the mission was abandoned, offer new/changing programming, and to tailor their tours to the interests of the groups who came. =Museum closure= In 2011, the museum and mission site were temporarily closed to the public. This was due to the Onondaga County Parks, led by the Parks Commissioner William Lansley, County Executive Joanne Moahoney, and retiring Onondaga County Legislature Chair James Rhinehart seeking to turn half of the second floor display area into rentable offices for the Onondaga County Soil & Water Conservation District. However, New York State has said that the parkland upon which the facility is on is protected by the LWCF (Land and Water Conservation Fund), due to the fund money used in the construction of the museum/visitor's center and thus designated for recreational park use only. In order for the Onondaga County Soil and Water Conservation District to move into the planned rentable space, an Alienation Act, related to Alienation (property law), must be passed in the New York State Senate and Assembly. Despite this, Matthew J. Millea, the Deputy County Executive for Physical Services for the Mahoney administration, insisted that the current project did not need to follow the LWCF. Due to the closure, and the locks being changed on the volunteers who provide all of the museum's programming, the popular Christmas Around the World event was canceled along with all other planned events. Skä•noñh - Great Law of Peace Center As of January 1, 2013, the Onondaga Historical Association (OHA) took over management of the site previously known as \\"Sainte Marie among the Iroquois\\", on the eastern shore of Onondaga Lake. Opening on November 2, 2015, the facility is now a Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) heritage and educational center named the Skä•noñh Center – Great Law of Peace Center.

Military service In April 1917, with a terrible war going on in Europe, the United States decided to enter this conflict against the Germans. Cameron, at the age of 45, took a leave of absence from teaching at Pearl in June 1917 to participate in the war effort. On October 15, 1917, he was commissioned as a first lieutenant in the U.S. Army at Fort Des Moines, Iowa, a facility established especially for training black officers in World War I. On June 10, 1918, he sailed for France and was assigned to Company M, 365th Infantry Regiment, 92nd Division – one of three black infantry divisions in combat during the war. For some unknown reason, the U.S. Army reversed Cameron's first and middle names and he was listed in his service records as Alvin H. Cameron instead of Henry A. Cameron. As an officer, he was a fastidious and capable leader who always cared about the safety and well-being of the men under his command. They succeeded in winning many battles against a fierce and determined German army in the face of insurmountable odds which unfortunately included overt discrimination received from his own U.S. Army superiors. On October 30, 1918, during the Battle of the Argonne Forest in France - one of the bloodiest battles of the war - Cameron was killed in action while on a scout patrol with his unit. He was the first of only three black men appointed officers in World War I from Tennessee and the first black officer to die from Tennessee. Cameron's body was not brought back to Nashville. His remains are still located in France at the St. Mihiel American Cemetery in Thiaucourt, France. Honors and awards Posthumous medals conferred upon Cameron for his actions during World War I include: the Croix de guerre (awarded by the French); the Meuse-Argonne with St. Die defensive clasps; the World War I Victory Medal with battle clasps and the Purple Heart. Nevertheless, a year later in 1919, with the introduction of American Legion posts all over the U.S., the Henry A. Cameron Post 6 in Nashville, Tennessee was established in his honor. It was one of the first American Legion posts named after an African American and is still in operation today. Additionally, on November 26, 1928, in a show of honor and respect for Cameron, the Nashville City School Board named Cameron School in his honor.

The fourth named storm of the season, Daniel originated on July 16 from a tropical wave off the coast of Mexico. It tracked westward, intensifying steadily to reach peak winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) on July 22. At the time, the characteristics of the cyclone resembled those of an annular hurricane. Daniel gradually weakened as it entered an area of cooler water temperatures and increased wind shear, and after crossing into the Central Pacific Ocean, it quickly degenerated into a remnant low-pressure area on July 26, before dissipating two days later. Initial predictions suggested that the cyclone would pass through the Hawaiian Islands as a tropical storm; however, Daniel's remnants dissipated southeast of Hawaii. The storm brought light to moderate precipitation to the Island of Hawaii and Maui, causing minor flooding, although no major damage or fatalities were reported. Meteorological history Hurricane Daniel began as a tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa on July 2. The wave moved across the Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea with little associated convection, and on July 12, it crossed Central America into the eastern Pacific Ocean. Convection increased on July 13, and two days later the system began to exhibit signs of tropical development to the south of Mexico. It tracked westward at about 15 mph (25 km/h), and on July 16, the disturbance became better organized. With convective rainbands near an associated low-level circulation, it is estimated the tropical wave spawned a tropical depression late on July 16. At the time, it was located about 525 miles (845 km) south-southwest of Manzanillo, Colima. Classified as Tropical Depression Five-E, the system tracked westward under the steering currents of a mid-level ridge. In the hours after formation, the depression lacked a concentration of deep convection near the center. Conditions favored development, including warm sea surface temperatures, very low amounts of wind shear, and an established anticyclone over the cyclone. Convection became more centralized, coinciding with the improvement of upper- level outflow. Based on Dvorak classifications, it is estimated that the cyclone intensified into Tropical Storm Daniel at 12:00 UTC on July 17. Daniel quickly became better organized, exhibiting increased thunderstorm activity and banding features. A central dense overcast developed, and a well-defined rainband wrapped around the center of circulation. Based on the formation of an eye feature, the National Hurricane Center upgraded Daniel to hurricane status late on July 18 while it was located about 885 miles (1420 km) south- southwest of Cabo San Lucas. alt=Satellite animation of a small, well-defined hurricane over open waters of the Pacific. On July 19, the eye of Daniel became apparent on satellite imagery, which organized into a pinhole eye. It underwent an eyewall replacement cycle as it turned to the west-northwest, temporarily halting its intensification trend, before quickly strengthening and attaining major hurricane status on July 20. Later that day, Hurricane Daniel organized into a very symmetric cyclone with a distinct eye about 30 miles (45 km) in diameter. Upon attaining Category 4 status on the Saffir- Simpson Hurricane Scale, the cyclone resembled the appearance of an annular hurricane; an annular hurricane is one with a large and symmetric eye, surrounded by a thick ring of intense convection, and usually is able to maintain its intensity and structure for several days. On July 21 the hurricane underwent another eyewall replacement cycle. After completing the cycle, Daniel attained its peak winds of 150 mph (240 km/h) early on July 22. It maintained peak winds for about 18 hours, and Daniel began a weakening trend as it crossed into an area of progressively cooler water temperatures. The eye became more distinct on July 23, before the cloud tops again warmed as the winds decreased. The hurricane crossed into the area of forecast responsibility of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center on July 24, and upon doing so, its eye disappeared from satellite imagery. Daniel was forecast to track through the Hawaiian Islands as a tropical storm as water temperatures near the islands were warmer, and wind shear was expected to be minimal. However, it decelerated as the ridge to its north weakened, and due to the combination of cool waters and increasing easterly shear, Daniel weakened to a tropical storm on July 25. Later that day, no active convection remained near the exposed circulation center, and early on July 26, it weakened to tropical depression status. Thunderstorm activity failed to redevelop, and Daniel degenerated into a remnant low-pressure area by 00:00 UTC on July 27. The remnant low continued west-northwestward, dissipating just southeast of the Big Island of Hawaii on July 28. Preparations and impact alt=Satellite image of a disorganized area of clouds approaching the Hawaiian islands. When Hurricane Daniel was forecast to pass through the Hawaiian islands as a tropical storm, state and Hawaii County officials recommended residents prepare hurricane kits. They also suggested purchasing non-perishable foods and batteries. Initially, the storm was several days away from potentially affecting the state, and as a result, few residents rushed to prepare. The Honolulu National Weather Service issued a high surf advisory for east facing beaches in Hawaii, and warned beachgoers to remain out of the water. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood watch and wind advisory in association with the remnants of Daniel. The remnants produced 2–5 inches (50–125 mm) of rainfall throughout windward areas of the Big Island of Hawaii and Maui on July 28 and 29. West Wailuaiki on Maui recorded 3.87 inches (98.3 mm) in one day, which was the highest daily rainfall total from the hurricane. The storm also dropped precipitation on the East Maui watershed. The rainfall particularly in Kailua-Kona on the Big Island caused ponding on roadways, as well as flooding of small streams. However, no injuries or serious damage were reported. A station in Ka Lae briefly reported sustained winds of about with gusts to . During the 61st Interdepartmental Hurricane Conference, the Hawaii State Civil Defense requested the retirement of the name Daniel, citing that it became one of the several storms memorable for threat or damage. However, the World Meteorological Organization did not approve the request.

They may catch fire, be damaged by high winds, or fall victim to other force majeure. A principle of common law is that any new construction or other improvement to land becomes property of the owner of the land - the title holder - once there has been an \\"improvement\\" to the owner's site. Builder's risk insurance indemnifies against some of these losses.  Coverage  Builder's risk covers perils such as fire, wind, theft and vandalism and many more. It typically does not cover perils such as earthquake, flood or hurricane damage unless the policy has been specifically endorsed to do so. However, earthquake riders can be very economical, depending on where your project is located and should be considered. These policies also do not cover accidents and injuries at the workplace. and is intended to terminate when the work has been completed and the property is ready for use or occupancy. If you are going to properly setup your policy, coverage should be effective prior to when the materials are delivered to the job site. Coverage ends upon the earlier of closing of the sale, occupancy or the policy expiration date. After builder risk coverage expires, due to sale or occupancy, the new owner should take out permanent property insurance on the building such as a home owner's policy or a commercial property policy. Insurance costs generally run between one and four percent of the construction cost, depending upon the type of insurance purchased and exclusions from coverage.  Who buys builder's risk insurance?  Coverage is often purchased by the custom builder or general contractor and may also be purchased by the property owner. Builder's risk coverage may be necessary to show proof of insurance to comply with local city, county, and state building codes and is often required as a condition to many contracts. However, many architects believe that it is the property owner who should have the builder's risk policy, because they have already paid for the improvements to their land, and if the builder receives the funds directly from a claim, theoretically, he/she could abscond with that benefit. It is far safer for the property owner to obtain the builder's risk policy, because they already own the building, even while it is under construction. If something happens to the under-construction project, then they should be the beneficiary and control how it is spent. Yes, the builder ends up receiving the funds in the end, to rebuild damage, but this method gives the control of the insurance benefit to the owner.  Alternatives  If the project involves renovations or additions to an existing building, the owner's existing property insurance may cover the work under construction, eliminating the need for builder's risk insurance. (Policies vary.) However, in the case of new buildings under construction on vacant sites, the owner may not have an existing policy that provides coverage.
