Course The source of the river is on the slopes of Great Hill, just above the ruins known as Pimm's, where the infant river is known as Calf Hey Brook. Calf Hey Brook is joined by another stream occasionally termed Roddlesworth - which rises beneath Cartridge Hill and runs past the ruins of Hollinshead Hall - beneath Slipper Lowe. From there, it follows a northerly course through Roddlesworth Plantations, around the two reservoirs fed by the river and past Red Lees. The river continues through the Stanworth Valley in Livesey, where it is met by Stockclough Brook, and under the M65 motorway and Leeds & Liverpool Canal. Stanworth Valley was the location for some of the No M65 Road Protest camps . This was the site of a 5-day eviction in 1995, between environmentalists and road builders. At stake was the ecologically valuable river system and diverse woodland. M65 motorway archive Soon after this, the Roddlesworth enters a culvert close to the Star Paper Mill. The Roddlesworth flows into the River Darwen at Moulden Brow. Between the confluence with Stockclough Brook and the Darwen, the river is known locally as Moulden (or Moulding) Water. For virtually its entire course, the Roddlesworth marks the boundary between Chorley Borough and the unitary authority of Blackburn with Darwen. This border was preceded by that between the Hundreds of Blackburn and Leyland. The river also demarcated the eastern edge of the region of Gunolfesmores in the Middle Ages and, later, the Manor of Hoghton.Lofthouse, J. (1951) Lancashire Landscape. Robert Hale Ltd., London, page 92. The name is first recorded in about 1160 as Rodtholfeswrtha, suggesting a derivation meaning \\"the homestead of Hrothwulf\\".Ekwall, E. (1922) The Place-names of Lancashire. Longmans, Green & Company, page 132. Settlements The Roddlesworth runs through a wooded valley close to the settlements of Tockholes, Roddlesworth, Abbey Village and Stanworth before joining the River Darwen close to Feniscowles. Reservoirs *Abbey Village Reservoir *Lower Roddlesworth Reservoir *Upper Roddlesworth Reservoir *Rake Brook Reservoir is fed by Rake Brook close to its confluence with the Roddlesworth. Tributaries Finnington Brook joins close to where the Roddlesworth itself falls into the River Darwen. Rising from the confluence of several small brooks, draining Riley Green, Marsh View and Brimmicroft, which meet close to Riley Green Bridge over the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, the brook runs eastward in a small, wooded valley below the canal. The river flows by the hamlet of Finnington, picking up other streams heading north from Stanworth, running by a hatchery and through a reservoir, joining the Roddlesworth on the south side of Moulden Water Bridge. Stockclough Brook flows into the Roddlesworth in the Stanworth Valley, opposite the site of what was probably once a small mill. The brook rises close to Potter's and flows west and south west, skirting by Lower Whitehalgh Farm before passing beneath Stockclough Lane and the M65 Motorway. Whitehalgh Brook joins near stepping stones in Owlet Holes Wood before Stockclough Brook flows beneath the Stockclough Viaduct, over which the former railway between Cherry Tree and Chorley once ran, before joining the Roddlesworth. Whitehalgh Brook itself rises in Adam Plat Wood where three brooks from Tockholes combine. Sheep Bridge Brook rises near Tithe Barn Cottages and flows northwest towards Yew Tree Farm, before moving southwest through Hole Bottom Wood, where it flows beneath the bridge that gives the stream its name. It meets Chapels Brook, flowing northwest from Close Farm and Weasel Farm in Tockholes, following Rock Lane to Chapels Farm, after which it moves past Pickering Fold and through Heald Wood. Shaw Brook joins at the western end of Adam Plat Wood, having run west and north from its source on Green Hill, via Golden Soney Farm and Lower Hill, past Higher Crow Trees Farm and Lower Crow Trees Farm passing through a wooded vale to its confluence with Whitehalgh Brook. Rake Brook rises at Brown Hill on Withnell Moor and flows northward, draining the west side of Cold Within Hill before pouring through Birch Clough, separating Twist Moor and Roddlesworth Moor and feeding Rake Brook Reservoir, formerly populated by Rake Wood. The confluence of Rake Brook and the River Roddlesworth is in Benson's Wood, just after the end of the overflow from the Roddlesworth Reservoirs. Rake Brook Reservoir is also fed by another stream rising on Withnell Moor. This unnamed brook flows north, separating Withnell Moor from Wheelton Moor (as well as the two civil parishes) before passing the ruins of New Temple (just south of Solomon's Temple), Summer House (formerly known as Botany Bay) and Pope's, running east of Millstone Edge, before meeting Rake Brook.

Skulachev in 1999, signifies the phenomenon of programmed death of an organism, i.e. that an organism's genes include features that under certain circumstances will cause the organism to rapidly degenerate and die off. Recently this has been referred to as \\"fast phenoptosis\\" as aging is being explored as \\"slow phenoptosis\\". Phenoptosis is a common feature of living species, whose ramifications for humans is still being explored. Evolutionary significance Inside of our bodies, worn-out, ineffective cells are dismantled and recycled for the greater good of the whole organism. This is a process called apoptosis. It is believed that phenoptosis is an evolutionary mechanism that culls out the damaged, aged, infectious, or those in direct competition with their own offspring for the good of the species. The \\"good of species\\" argument does not survive any theoretical scrutiny. This is a typical group selection argument that provides no explanation of why a rare selfish cheater genotype that refrains from \\"phenoptosis\\" to its own benefit would not invade a hypothetical population of individuals practicing \\"phenoptosis\\" for the benefit of the species. Special circumstances need to exist for the \\"phenoptosis\\" strategy to be an ESS, let alone the only ESS. Examples of \\"phenoptosis\\" given below are really examples of semelpary - a life history with a single reproduction followed by death, which evolves not \\"for the good of the species\\" but as the ESS in the conditions of high adult-to-juvenile mortality ratio. The elimination of parts detrimental to the organism or individuals detrimental to the species has been deemed \\"The samurai law of biology\\" ‚Äì it is better to die than to be wrong. Stress-induced, acute, or fast phenoptosis is the rapid deterioration of an organism induced by a life event such as breeding. Elimination of the parent provides space for fitter offspring. As a species this has been advantageous particularly to species that die immediately after spawning. Age-induced, soft, or slow phenoptosis is the slow deterioration and death of an organism due to accumulated stresses over long periods of time. In short, it has been proposed that aging, heart disease, cancer, and other age related ailments are means of phenoptosis. \\"Death caused by aging clears the population of ancestors and frees space for progeny carrying new useful traits.\\" It has also been proposed that age provides a selective advantage to brains over brawn. An example made by V. P. Skulachev provides that of two hares, one faster and one smarter, the faster hare may have a selective advantage in youth but as aging occurs and muscles deteriorate it is the smarter hare that now has the selective advantage. Examples in nature * E. coli ‚Äì programmed death is initiated by infection by phage. This prevents further spread of phage to the remaining population. * Saccharomyces cerevisiae ‚Äì Under stress the yeast mitochondria produce reactive oxygen species ROS, leading to loss of membrane potential within the mitochondria and death of the cell. * Amoeba Dictyostelium ‚Äì Under stress amoeba form multicellular fruiting bodies. The better nourished cells differentiate into spores. The less healthy cells differentiate into the stalks of the fruiting body. After maturation of the spores, the stalk cells undergo phenoptosis. * Nematode Caenorhabditis elegans ‚Äì Under normal conditions Caenorhabditis elegans display a normal aging life cycle. However, if there is increased stress after breeding they undergo phenoptosis, like in yeast, induced by the mitochondria. * Mayfly ‚Äì Adult mayflies have no functional mouth and die from malnutrition. * Praying mantis ‚Äì The male praying mantis ejaculates only after being decapitated by the female. * Mite Adactylidium ‚Äì The initial food source of Adactylidium mite larvae is the body tissues of their mother resulting in her death. * Squid ‚Äì Some male squid die immediately after mating. This provides an abundant food source for those predators that would prey on the eggs. * Marsupial mice ‚Äì Males die two weeks after reproducing from an overabundance of their own pheromones. * Salmon ‚Äì Die soon after spawning. * Septic shock ‚Äì Severe infection by pathogens often results in death by sepsis. Sepsis, however, is not a result of toxins activated by the pathogen, rather it is directed by the organism itself. Similar to phenoptosis of E. coli, this has been suggested to be a means to separate dangerously infected individuals from healthy ones. Proposed mechanisms Mitochondrial ROS ‚Äì The production of ROS by the mitochondria. This causes oxidative damage to the inner compartment of the mitochondria and destruction of the mitochondria. Clk1 gene ‚Äì the gene thought to be responsible to aging due to mitochondrial ROS. EF2 kinase ‚Äì Blocks phosphorylation of elongation factor 2 thus blocking protein synthesis. Glucocorticoid regulation ‚Äì A common route for phenoptosis is breakdown of glucocorticoid regulation and inhibition, leading to massive excess of these corticosteroids in the body.

Calgary is also a major Canadian transportation centre and a central cargo hub for freight in and out of north-western North America. The city sits at the junction between the \\"Canamex\\" highway system and the Trans- Canada Highway (Highway 1 in Alberta). As a prairie city, Calgary has never had any major impediments to growth. As such, it has developed into a city with an area of about http://content.calgary.ca/CCA/City+Hall/Business+Units/Development+and+Building+Approvals+and+Land+Use+Planning+and+Policy/Land+Use+Planning/Current+Studies+and+Ongoing+Activities/Annexation+Information/Comparing+Calgary+With+New+York.htm (of which only half is built up) and a metropolitan area of nearly . This outward growth has encouraged the development of an extensive personal vehicle-oriented road network complete with a freeway system. Since 1981, when the city officially opened the first leg of its CTrain rapid transit system, emphasis on public transportation as an alternative to cars has become important. The CTrain has the second-highest light rail system ridership of any North American city, only slightly behind Guadalajara, Mexico. Cycling is also seen as a major alternative to driving in Calgary. In recent years, increases in the population and density of inner-city neighbourhoods such as the Beltline have favoured greater pedestrianism as well. Public transportation Calgary's primary public transportation system is operated by Calgary Transit. The service operates only within Calgary city limits and does not provide transportation to and from other communities within the Calgary Region. Some communities within Calgary's metropolitan area provide their own transit services (for example, Airdrie Transit). Calgary Transit is owned and managed by the City of Calgary. Light rail C-Train at City Hall Station The light rail transit (LRT) system, known as the C-Train, consists of of track connecting 45C-Train stations and was one of the first such systems in North America.LRT Technical Data Until very recently, Calgary and Edmonton were the only two North American cities with populations under one million to operate rapid mass transit systems. The Saddletowne-69 St. (Route 202) line serves the city's West, downtown and Northeast areas, while the Tuscany- Somerset‚ÄìBridlewood (Route 201) line runs between the Northwest and South Calgary via the 7th Avenue South transit-only corridor. Travel between stations along 7th Avenue in downtown is free-of-charge. Unique to the C-Train system, its power is completely wind generated and completely free of emissions.Calgary Transit and the Environment An extension of the Route 202 line was recently built to serve some Southwest communities to the west of downtown. The project is called the WestLRT and was completed in December 2012.West LRT in Calgary Main Website Buses Calgary Transit also has a system of buses, with routes stretching over the whole city. It has won several awards for its efficiency and its environmental responsibility. It consists of over 160 bus routes and four C-Train lines (two routes), stretching over .Calgary Transit Statistics Roads and streets Country Hills Boulevard and Beddington Trail intersection in Sandstone Valley, Calgary. Calgary has an extensive street network. Smaller roads are supplemented with a number of major arteries, expressways and freeways. The largest of these is the north‚Äìsouth running Deerfoot Trail. The majority of main expressways and freeways are named Trails, as well as some of the main arterial roads that do not fit in the numbering grid. The use of the term Trails to describe major highways resulted from the development of early pioneer trails into the highways themselves. The original trails were named after the settlements to which they lead; for example, Edmonton Trail (part of the former Calgary and Edmonton Trail), (Fort) Macleod Trail, and Banff Trail (which combined with 24th Street W was later renamed Crowchild Trail). More recently developed local expressways were given the Trail moniker and have been named after important people from Calgary's history (Crowchild Trail, Marquis of Lorne Trail), native groups (Stoney Trail, Sarcee Trail, Blackfoot Trail) or again after their destination (Airport Trail). There are a couple of exceptions to this rule in which a few older residential streets have also been labeled \\"Trail\\", such as Morley Trail. Plans originating in the 1950s and 1960s for a considerably more extensive freeway system including elevated freeways were largely abandoned in favour of a growing trend to reduce the emphasis on roads and increase the amount of public transportation infrastructure in North American cities. Sidewalks at intersections in areas outside the downtown core are often stamped with the name of the cross-street, especially in older districts. As this was once done by hand by municipal employees who were not always literate, some street names are misspelled or the letters reversed. Organization downtown Traditionally Calgary's roads were built on a grid system. Originally, the streets and avenues were named, but after 1904, they were numbered. Today, numbered Avenues (running east‚Äìwest) and Streets (running north‚Äìsouth) dominate the city, although names appear to be making a comeback. The city is divided into four quadrants: Northeast, Northwest, Southeast and Southwest, and all street names and addresses end with suffixes corresponding to the quadrant of the city in which they lie (NW, NE, SE or SW). The central point of the quadrant system is the Centre Street Bridge, with Centre Street and Centre Avenue forming the boundaries (although the points vary; most of the south end has Macleod Trail as a boundary, except near Chinook Centre where Macleod Trail bends westward; in the west end, the Bow River forms the boundary for the most part). Roads in predominantly suburban residential areas as well as freeways and expressways do not generally conform to the grid and are usually not numbered as a result (although some suburban streets are indeed numbered if they fall in place on the grid). The main lines on the grid are fairly evenly distributed at intervals of about 1 mile (1.6 km) where an arterial road (or expressway) is usually situated (on former Township and Range Roads). They are at roughly the following Streets and Avenues (although not always named as such): *Avenues north of downtown: 16th, 32nd, 48th, 64th, 80th, 96th, 112th, 128th, 144th *Avenues south of downtown: 17th, 34th, 50th, 66th, 82nd, 90th, 114th, 130th, 146th, 162nd, 178th, 194th *Streets east of downtown: 6th, 15th, 24th, 36th, 52nd, 68th, 84th *Streets west of downtown: 14th, 24th, 37th, 53rd, 69th, 85th, 101st, 117th A quirk of the numbering is that it was intended for addresses on numbered streets to begin at 100 (not 0) at Centre Street and Centre Avenue and move out accordingly. For example, 545 16th Avenue NW lies between 4th and 5th Streets NW. There are many violations of such, however, especially in suburban areas. The highest address numbers are found on north‚Äìsouth streets in the southernmost suburbs, where they approach 20000.

The airport is WestJet Airlines's main base and largest hub, and acts as an Air Canada hub. In total, about 20 passenger airlines have regular scheduled flights to and from the airport. It is also a major hub for several cargo airlines including DHL, FedEx, Purolator, and United Parcel Service. The airport primarily connects Western Canada with non-stop flights to Eastern Canada, 18 major American cities, as well as destinations to Europe, Asia, the Caribbean and Mexico. Calgary International airport also has regular scheduled service to London, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, Mexico City and Tokyo.Calgary International Airport Calgary International Airport is Canada's fourth busiest airport in after Toronto Pearson International Airport, Vancouver International Airport and Montreal Trudeau International Airport. In 2008, it served more than 12.5 million passengers and is expected to for several years. Calgary's second airport, Calgary/Springbank Airport, is located in the western suburb of Springbank, handles the majority of private-plane flights, and acts as a reliever for the main airport while also being the 11th busiest in Canada for aircraft movements.  Bus   Intercity  Scheduled bus service from Calgary or Calgary Airport and north to Red Deer and Edmonton are provided by Greyhound, Red Arrow, and Ebus. Some departures pickup at the Calgary Airport. South to Lethbridge are Greyhound, LA Shuttle, and Red Arrow. Calgary to Medicine Hat is provided by Greyhound, J&L; Shuttle of Medicine Hat and Prairie Sprinter Shuttle of Medicine Hat. Greyhound provides service west to British Columbia. Banff Airporter and Brewster provides service between the Calgary Airport and Banff. Brewster also provides service to Lake Louise and Jasper. Travel to Montana USA is a charter van service provided by Airport Shuttle Express of Calgary as well as to Waterton Park, Fernie and other resort destinations in Alberta, BC and Montana. Effective October 31, 2018 Greyhound Canada will be cancelling all services in Western Canada, which includes Calgary, due to low ridership.https://news.greyhound.ca/alberta  Regional  On-It Regional Transit provides scheduled bus service to commuter towns surrounding Calgary. Commuter service is provided to Cochrane, Okotoks, and High River. On-It also provides a summer weekend and holiday service to Canmore and Banff. Rail Passenger rail Calgary is also the largest Canadian city without an Intercity Passenger Service, as all Via Rail service to the city was terminated in the late 1980s and early 1990s by the Conservative government. Rail tours by Royal Canadian Pacific serve Calgary from the former Via Rail station in the Tower Centre (next to the Calgary Tower); Rocky Mountaineer pulled out some years back and now runs only from Banff, Alberta westward. Freight Calgary has four main Canadian Pacific and CN Rail lines that traverse the city, in addition to the various feeder lines that run through the industrial parks in the eastern half of the city. One of the rail structures in Calgary is the CPR Alyth Yard, where many of these feeder lines connect to the main lines. Bicycle and pedestrian The City of Calgary also maintains a network of paved multi-use pathways (for bicycling, roller skating and jogging). The dedicated pathway network in Calgary is among the most expansive in North America and spans . There are also about of signed on-street bicycle routes.Map of Bicycle pathways The pathways connect many of the city's parks, river valley, residential neighbourhoods, and downtown. Calgarians make year-round use of these paths for walking, running, and cycling to various destinations. In June 2013, massive flooding destroyed much of the pathway system (including many pedestrian bridges) along the Elbow and Bow rivers. Most repairs are complete. Calgary's system of elevated walkways or skyways downtown (known as the +15 system) is the most extensive in the world.http://www.calgary.ca/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_0_766_234_0_43/http%3B/content.calgary.ca/CCA/City+Transportation/Get+Around+Calgary/Walking/Plus+15.htm These walkways not only serve to connect buildings, but also contain restaurants, shops, and services (most notably incorporating large parts of The Core Shopping Centre).

Still a teenager, Turchyn was the first of the juniors from Komatsu to win a senior medal and, despite the inevitable distractions, he handled his sudden success better than most. His coaches were relieved to see that their young star was still progressing well through the winter of 2004/05. Just how well was shown when Turchyn beat the previously invincible Raman Piatrushenka in a 2005 Belarus Cup K-1 200 m race. A shocked Reneysky called for a photo-finish before confirming the result. Turchyn was typically unfazed by his victory and even had the temerity to look aggrieved when Piatrushenka edged him out in the K-1 1000 m final. At the 2005 European Championships, again held in Pozna≈Ñ, the Belarusians went one better than in 2004, taking the K4 500m gold medal ahead of Slovakia. This was a first senior title not just for Turchyn but for his team-mates too. Perhaps understandably they celebrated a little too enthusiastically with the result that they only came in fifth in the 200m final. A month later they were world champions as well, beating rivals Slovakia at the World Championships in Zagreb, Croatia. This was the first team kayak world title won by a Belarus crew since independence, but this time they delayed their celebrations and picked up a bronze medal in the 200 m final too. The K-4 crew were voted Belarus Sports Team of the Year 2005. In 2006 they began in impressive form with victories at the Poznan and Duisburg regattas. However Reneysky then changed his strategy in preparation for the 2008 Summer Olympics. With only one K-4 event, the 1000 m, on the Olympic schedule, the K-4 crew would not be entered for the 500m at the European and World Championships. This strategy was logical in that it allowed Piatrushenka and Makhneu the necessary rest time to compete in the K-2 500 m. It also allowed the formation of a second K-4 500 m kayak crew to accommodate other up-and-coming Belarusian paddlers. Nonetheless it was hard on Turchyn and Abalmasau who were denied the chance to defend their hard-won titles of 2005. At the European Championships in Raƒçice, Czech Republic, Turchyn and his team- mates won an encouraging silver medal in the K-4 1000 m behind Slovakia. This was their best-ever result over 1000 m in a major championship. But their background as sprinters was demonstrated the following day as they took gold in the K-4 200 m. At the 2006 World Championships, held in Szeged, Hungary, the Belarusian four claimed a bronze medal in the 1000 m final (this time behind hosts Hungary and Poland) - their first world championship medal over the Olympic distance. Coach Vladimir Shantarovich was unimpressed with their Szeged bronze medal, accusing the crew of lacking the mental strength to reproduce their best form on the biggest stage. He argued that their times in training meant they were already well capable of winning major titles over the Olympic distance of 1000 m. Turchyn won a gold in the K-4 200 m event at the 2009 championships in Dartmouth. Turchyn is 190 cm (6'3\\") tall and weighs 90 kg (198 lbs).

Kurt Heinrich Sethe (30 September 1869 - 6 July 1934) was a noted German Egyptologist and philologist from Berlin. He was a student of Adolf Erman. Sethe collected numerous texts from Egypt during his visits there and edited the Urkunden des √¶gyptischen Altertums which is a standard catalogue of Ancient Egyptian literature and text. Among Sethe's many contributions to Egyptology, two are singled out by Gardiner (p. 433): \\"...the pronunciation of Middle Egyptian... The chief authorities to be consulted are Sethe's great work on the Egyptian verb, and a much later brilliant article entitled Die Vokalisation des √Ñgyptischen in Zeitschrift der deutschen morgenl√§ndischen Gesellschaft\\"\\" (1923). Actually, Sethe was the first one to put forth a systematic theory of the Egyptian verb; it was no easy accomplishment, since the inflection of the Egyptian verb was done mainly by changing the vowels, and the Egyptians only wrote consonants. Among Sethe's students were Hans Jakob Polotsky and Alan Gardiner. Sethe's anthology, Aegyptische Lesestuecke, is still doing sterling service to the beginners in the study of the language. Sethe also published a comprehensive collection of Egyptian epigraphy, which he called Urkunden der Aegyptologie.

The hospital has more than 500 beds and various room types and facilities. It also has a 24 hours outpatient consultation service. HKSH has a School of Nursing, affiliated with The Open University of Hong Kong,\\"Message from the President\\" - Prof. John C Y Leong, Open University of Hong Kong which trains nurses up to degree level. It is also affiliated with the Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine of the University of Hong Kong and provides clinical attachment opportunities for HKU medical students. HKSH is surveyed and accredited bi-annually by QHA Trent Accreditation of the United Kingdom, a major international healthcare accreditation group. With a height of 148.5 metres (487 feet), it was the second-highest hospital building in the world, 15 centimetres shorter than Guy's Hospital in London, UK. History The Hospital, when formed in 1922 and known then as The Yeung Wo Nursing Home, was organized by a leading group of Chinese medical practitioners and prominent residents of Hong Kong. The aim was to provide hospital facilities for the Chinese community and to provide accessible accommodation for the patients to be cared for by their own doctors. \\"The Happy Retreat\\", at that time a most popular public amusement centre in Happy Valley, was acquired by the organizers for the purpose. Dr. Man-Kai Wong (Â∞πÊñáÊ•∑, 1870-1927) was one of the founders of the Hospital.https://www.doc88.com/p-036730127601.html After renovating the two existing buildings which were included in the purchase, the Hospital opened its doors in September 1922 with 28 beds. Dr. Wai-Cheung Chau (Âë®Êá∑Áíã, 1893-1965), a medical doctor trained in Hong Kong, served as the Superintendent of the Hospital. Dr. Lee Sun Chau (Âë®ÁêÜ‰ø°, i.e., Âë®ÂÖ≠Âßë, 1890-1979), a medical doctor trained in Guangzhou, China, served as the Matron of the Hospital.Rebecca Chan Chung, Deborah Chung and Cecilia Ng Wong, \\"Piloted to Serve\\", 2012http://cnac.org/rebeccachan01.htmhttps://www.facebook.com/PilotedToServe Four years after the opening, a landslip occurred at the hill slope behind the two buildings and caused considerable damage. The Nursing Home had to be closed for some six months in order that the premises could be made habitable for admission of patients. The Board of Directors at that time considered that for the number of patients to increase, a good surgeon would have to be found. Dr. Li Shu Fan, who had just returned to Hong Kong after serving as head of Kung Yee University Medical School in Canton, was chosen. Subsequently, in 1926, Dr. Li was elected to head and to re-organise Yeung Wo. It was under his leadership that the name of the nursing home was changed to its present form, Hong Kong Sanatorium & Hospital. From then until his death in 1966, he held the twin positions of Chairman of the Board and Medical Superintendent. After his death, his brother Dr. Li Shu Pui was elected Chairman of the Board of Directors and appointed Medical Superintendent to continue the management of the Hospital. Dr. Li Shu Pui was first elected a director of the Hospital's Board in 1929 and was appointed additionally as Assistant Superintendent in 1936. He therefore served the Hospital in a leadership capacity for seventy years. Dr. Li Shu Pui died on 31 August 2005 and Dr. Li Wai Tat, Walton has succeeded him as the Chairman of the Board of Directors and Medical Superintendent of the Hospital.

His nickname \\"Mineiro\\" means somebody from the state of Minas Gerais, even though he is actually from the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Sul. This nickname was given to him because of his shy and quiet personality, typical of someone from Minas Gerais. Club career Mineiro was born in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul. He won the Campeonato Paulista in 2004 and 2005, playing for S√£o Caetano and S√£o Paulo, respectively, and also won, playing for S√£o Paulo, the Copa Libertadores de Am√©rica and the FIFA Club World Championship in 2005. On 18 December 2005, he scored the only goal in the final of the 2005 FIFA Club World Championship in Yokohama, Japan, against European champions Liverpool. On 3 February 2007, he had his Bundesliga debut for Hertha BSC in a game against Hamburger SV. He was brought on for the last 20 minutes in place of Malik Fathi and scored his first goal for the Berlin club, a spectacular game- winning goal (2‚Äì1), shooting from more than 25 yards, in the last seconds of injury time. On 24 September 2008, it was announced that Mineiro had signed for Chelsea as a backup for the injured Michael Essien until the end of the 2008‚Äì09 season. He made his Chelsea debut on 1 November 2008 against Sunderland in a league match. He came on for Nicolas Anelka who had already scored a hat-trick leading Chelsea to a 5‚Äì0 victory. Despite already having played for Chelsea he was not formally revealed to the press until 7 November during a press conference at Chelsea's training ground in Cobham, Surrey. During the press conference it was confirmed that Mineiro was on a contract to play as Chelsea's third-choice defensive midfielder, behind Essien and John Obi Mikel. Mineiro played just twice for Chelsea, and his only start was against Burnley in the League Cup. On 11 August 2009, he returned to Germany for the medical check and later signed with Schalke 04. He made his Schalke debut on 16 August 2009 in their first home game of the 2009‚Äì10 Bundesliga season, a 3‚Äì0 win against VfL Bochum, playing the entire match. At the end of the season, he left Schalke. On 6 September 2011, TuS Koblenz, playing in the fourth tier of German football, surprisingly announced his signing, giving him a contract until the end of the season. International career Mineiro made his international debut in April 2001 against Peru. Mineiro was a late call-up for Brazil's 2006 FIFA World Cup squad. A knee injury sustained by Barcelona midfielder Edm√≠lson in the run-up to the tournament forced him to withdraw, resulting in a call-up for Mineiro, but he did not receive any playing time in Germany. Mineiro was selected to participate in Copa Am√©rica 2007. He started every match as Brazil went on to win the tournament. He retired from the national team in 2008.

Founded in 1918, the college was non-profit and had an undergraduate body of roughly 350 students. It offered courses in business, education, management, medical assistant training, computer science and general studies. The school was not regionally accredited, although it was nationally accredited by the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS). On December 12, 2016, John King Jr., the United States Secretary of Education, finalized the process of revoking the U.S. Department of Education's recognition of ACICS as an accreditor. Subsequently, Jones College announced it would close on December 31, 2017. Its last classes were held in August 2017. Campuses Main campus The college's main campus was located in the Arlington neighborhood of Jacksonville at the foot of the Mathews Bridge. The school also offered distance learning, and had a student to faculty ratio of 12:1 in on-campus classrooms. History Jones College, originally Jones Business College, held its first classes in a private home. It later became the first business college to have a student dormitory. The school had national accreditation from the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools (ACICS). It was certified to operate in Florida by the Commission for Independent Education (CIE) and approved by CIE to grant degrees at both the associate's level and the bachelor's level of academic study. \\"Jones College Catalog\\" Jones College. By the end of its operation, Jones College offered degrees in business and information technology, as well as medical, legal and educational fields. Jones College students were to transfer to Keiser University to complete their coursework. Radio Jones College Radio was a non-commercial broadcast from the campus on station WKTZ-FM (90.9 MHz), which was live 24 hours a day. The programming content was easy listening, branded as \\"Beautiful Music\\". The station began as an AM station in 1964 and then switched to FM in 1973. The station is played in many businesses and professional offices on the First Coast instead of commercial muzak, and can be accessed via the station's online website. The college also owned a student run radio station, WFAM (91.1 FM) and an AM carrier radio station WJCR. WFAM had a classical music format in the morning (9-12 p.m.) Top 40 in the afternoon (12-6 p.m.) and jazz until sign off. The station was sold and the beautiful music format was replaced with Christian radio. Jones College Radio continues to operate online.

They can be found growing in small groups along the side of tree roots. This mushroom is edible, but a few expert mushroom hunters insist that young specimens should be avoided as can be confused with Stropharia aeruginosa. The anise odor is due to the presence of p-anisaldehyde and a small amount of benzaldehyde. This odor can give away the mushroom's presence before it is observed by eye. Taxonomy First described by the French mycologist Jean Baptiste Francois Pierre Bulliard (1742‚Äì1793). The specific epithet odora is from the Latin meaning \\"perfumed\\". Description Young specimens have a light blue texture on the cap which fades to grey in age. The gills and stem are white with no ring. Full grown specimens have blue-green, flowery, cup-shaped caps; the gills are creamy white, or reflect the blue-green color of the cap. The cap's surface feels rough. The stem is thick, is attached to the gills with no rings, and is textured, with a pale-yellow colour. The younger ones have a bell-shaped cap with a light blue or icy blue colour. The gills and stem are white, or bluish green. It has a strong scent and taste of aniseed, hence its name. There is a white variety (Clitocybe odora var.alba Lange) that has the same strong odour. Distribution and habitat Found in both deciduous, and coniferous woods, it is widespread in the temperate zones, occurring in Asia, Europe, and North America. On the East Coast of North America it favours oak woodland, but it is often abundant in the coniferous forests of the Pacific Northwest. Edibility The caps can be dried, and used as a condiment, or used fresh for flavouring. Mushroom hunters should be sure to pick mature ones, mainly because the younger ones can be confused with several similar poisonous ones that grow along with this mushroom. Every part of the mushroom should be examined before collecting for the table. Also, the stem and the cut cap should be checked to see if there are any fly larvae. Some guides recommend avoiding eating the species.

He also served on Toronto City Council for a period in the 1930s and 1940s. Life and career Smith was the son of Reverend A. E. Smith, a social gospel minister who became a leading figure in the Communist Party. Stewart Smith was one of the main figures in the faction, led by Tim Buck, that took over the party leadership in 1929. Smith was elected to the party's Central Committee and continued to serve on it (and the party's Political Bureau) for decades. He supported the expulsion of Trotskyist and Right Opposition factions from the party. In 1934, Smith wrote the pamphlet Socialism and the C.C.F. which promoted the Communist Party's view that the newly formed democratic socialist Co-operative Commonwealth Federation was an obstacle to socialism which served as a buffer between the working class and the capitalist class that needed to be defeated. In 1935, Smith led the Canadian delegation to the world congress of the Communist International held in Moscow. When he returned, he echoed the Comintern's new line rejecting the previous Third Period sectarianism of the party and advocating class unity and ultimately Popular Frontism in its stead resulting in the dissolution of the party's red union, the Workers' Unity League into the American Federation of Labour and Congress of Industrial Organizations. Smith was elected to Toronto City Council as an alderman beginning in 1937 and, in the 1945 municipal election, was elected to the powerful Toronto Board of ControlRed Controller, Time Magazine, January 22, 1945 and was elected again in 1946 before being defeated in 1947 as the result of a strong anti-Communist campaign. Smith, Stanley Ryerson and Leslie Morris were propelled into the leadership of the party in 1940 when the Communist Party was banned and Tim Buck, Sam Carr and Charles Simms fled to New York City to escape arrest. Smith, Ryerson and Morris were made leaders of the party's \\"operations centre\\" and effectively led the party until Buck, Carr and Simms returned from exile when the German invasion of the Soviet Union brought the USSR into World War II as an Allied Power. Smith remained a prominent member of the Labor-Progressive Party (as the Communists were known), and leader of the Labor-Progressive Party of Ontario, until the crisis that hit the international Communist movement in 1956. The combined shock of Nikita Khrushchev's Secret Speech at the Twentieth Party Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet invasion of Hungary led Smith to join the exodus from the party, led by the resignations of Smith, J.B. Salsberg, Harry Binder and Sam Lipshitz, that reduced the LPP to a small rump. He was subsequently written out of the party's history. After leaving the party, Smith found success as an entrepreneur in the pharmaceutical industry. He built a chain of discount drugstores, selling his business to Shoppers Drug Mart in 1978. In the 1990s, he authored his autobiography Comrades and Komsomolkas, My Years in the Communist Party of Canada .

It was presented to the public on the Summer NAMM of 2002. Unlike the Alesis Andromeda, Alesis's analog synthesizer, its sounds are synthesized using DSP chips to mimic the sound of analog audio circuitry and components. Features The Ion has several features that make it stand apart from other analog modeling synthesizers. Most importantly, it features a selection of emulations of classic analog filter models of synthesizers such as the Moog Minimoog, Oberheim's SEM, the Roland TB-303, the ARP 2600 and the Roland Jupiter 8. Besides these emulations (which carry euphemistic names due to trademark issues), it has a series of filter models that are not commonly found on most synthesizers, such as formant and comb filters. This vastly increases the sonic range; most virtual analogs have only a single multimode filter (usually featuring low-pass, high-pass and band-pass modes) which was either designed from scratch or \\"inspired by\\" an existing \\"famous\\" filter model. The fact that two of these filters can be used in a parallel or serial configuration adds to the sound design possibilities. Besides the selection of filters, it has an extensive modulation matrix. This allows the user to route a source (such as an LFO) to various targets with an adjustable intensity. The Ion's extensive \\"Mod Matrix\\" rivals the routing options of some voltage-controlled modular synthesizers. While most virtual analog synthesizers are equipped with on- board effects, the Ion lacks two important ones; reverb and a long delay (the on-board delay only has 80ms of delay time). These are often used on synthesizers to add some atmosphere to what would otherwise be a \\"dry\\" sound. One feature that also sets it apart from other virtual analog synthesizers, is the high resolution of the endless rotating front panel knobs yielding a more precise real-time tweaking experience. This high resolution eliminates all \\"stair stepping\\" or quantization of parameter value changes. These are not encoders, but real endless potentiometers. The Ion's keyboard has velocity sensitivity, but not aftertouch. However, the sound engine is capable of responding to both channel and polyphonic aftertouch messages received via MIDI. This feature means that with an external polyphonic aftertouch keyboard controller, the Ion can be made to modulate notes individually with finger pressure. Alesis Micron played by Miley Cyrus Alesis Micron  The little brother of the Ion is the Alesis Micron, which is extremely compact and portable. It came out in 2004 with almost the same synthesis engine and the same metal/plastic housing style as the Ion, but with only 37 keys and fewer knobs and buttons. It boasts reverb, long delay, and a pattern sequencer. Sound patches for the Ion can be used on the Micron and vice versa. The Micron's user interface features many shortcuts and is quite deep, offering users the ability to edit all of the sound engine's parameters.Alesis, \\"Micron Reference Manual\\" However, due to the lack of knobs on its control surface compared to the Ion, specialised Micron patch editor software has been made for various platforms to enable easier sound sculpting from a computer via MIDI. Akai Miniak AKAI MINIAK In 2009, Alesis's partner Akai released its Akai Miniak, which has the same sound engine as the Micron, but in a differently styled plastic housing, with three modulation wheels instead of the Micron's two sliders plus one wheel, and with a different set of presets. Unlike the Micron, the Miniak standard comes with a gooseneck microphone. Pricing of the Miniak was substantially - typically 50% - higher upon release than the Micron's. In mid-2010 the price was dropped drastically.

Summary In the company of three young men at another man's apartment, Samantha Reid and her friends, Melanie Sindone and Jessica VanWassehnova, were offered drinks. Samantha and Melanie both asked for Mountain Dew. The young men brought them the cocktails, to which they had added either gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) or gamma-butyrolactone (GBL). Melanie stated that her face became numb soon afterward, and then she and Samantha both passed out. The boys initially thought nothing was wrong, since GHB and alcohol can cause anyone drinking them to pass out if they drink too much of them, and this is usually not considered a medical emergency. However, Jessica later noticed that they were having difficulty breathing. The boys eventually drove them to a hospital, but Samantha stopped breathing on the way there. Both girls were put on life-support; Reid died roughly 18 hours later. Outcome Reid's death inspired the legislation titled the Hillory J.

Early life Lang was born in Camden County, Georgia. He attended the Georgia Military Institute in Marietta, graduating in the Class of 1857 and ranked 4th of 16. He moved to Suwannee County, Florida, and became a surveyor. Civil War With the secession of Florida and the outbreak of the Civil War, Lang enlisted in the Confederate Army on April 2, 1861, as a private in Company H of the 1st Florida Infantry. Barely over a month later, he was promoted to sergeant. He was discharged in April 1862 after his term of enlistment expired. In May, Lang enrolled in the 8th Florida Infantry and was commissioned as captain of Company C. He was wounded at the Battle of Antietam in September and again at the Battle of Fredericksburg in December. Stationed in the town of Fredericksburg, Lang's men stubbornly contested Federal attempts to lay pontoon bridges across the Rappahannock River. An artillery shell fragment struck the chimney of the building that Lang occupied, and a large chunk of masonry struck him in the head, gravely injuring him. Recovering from his wounds, Lang was promoted to colonel of the 8th Florida on April 30, 1863, and fought at the Battle of Chancellorsville, where his brigade commander, Brig. Gen. Edward A. Perry, was stricken with typhoid fever. Lang led Perry's Brigade during the Gettysburg Campaign. On July 2, 1863, he attacked the center of the Union defensive line on Cemetery Ridge, advancing past the Codori farm before being repulsed by troops from the II Corps. On the following day, the brigade supported Pickett's Charge, but failed to advance very far under heavy fire from Lt. Col. Freeman McGilvery's line of artillery. It was attacked in one flank by the 2nd Vermont Brigade of Brig. Gen. George J. Stannard, losing about 60% of its 700 plus soldiers. With General Perry's return, Lang returned to command of the 8th Florida, leading it in the Bristoe and Mine Run Campaigns, as well as in the 1864 Overland Campaign. Lang led the brigade again briefly at the Battle of Cold Harbor. Perry had to leave the Army of Northern Virginia because of his wounds, Brig. Gen. Joseph Finegan and then Brig. Gen. Theodore W. Brevard, Jr. led the Floridians. However, by the end of the war, Brevard having been captured, Lang was again leading the Florida Brigade, surrendering it at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865. Postbellum career After the cessation of hostilities, Lang returned to Florida and became a civil engineer. He married Mary \\"Mollie\\" Quarles Campbell on February 28, 1866, and fathered four children. He was elected as a state representative from Tallahassee, Florida, from 1885 until 1893. He served an eight-year tenure as Florida's Adjutant General during the administrations of Governors Perry and Fleming (1885-1894). He was influential in the reorganization and training of Florida's state militia troops, which contributed to the creation of Florida's modern National Guard. Serving as major general, he led efforts in increase funding and pay rates for the troops. Lang returned to the Gettysburg Battlefield in 1895 to help stake out the location for the Florida state monument. He resumed his political career, serving in the legislature until 1901, then served as a private secretary to Florida Governors Henry L. Mitchell and William D. Bloxham. Lang was also Cashier of the Florida State Hospital. Lang was among the last brigade commanders of the Third Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia to die. He was buried in the Old City Cemetery in Tallahassee. Honors The David Lang Camp #1314 of the Sons of Confederate Veterans in Tallahassee was named in his honor.

It has distinctive wings with characteristic black blotches at their proximal ends, which make the dragonfly look as though it is wearing saddlebags. The black saddlebags is a relatively large dragonfly at about 5 centimeters in length. The body is thin and black, and the female may have lighter spotting or mottling dorsally. The head is much wider than the rest of the body and is dark brown in color. The insect can be found at bodies of stagnant water, such as ponds and ditches. The female mates once and stores all the sperm she needs for fertilization. If she should mate again, the second male will remove the sperm of the first male from her body with the brush-like apparatus on his specially-adapted penis. The larvae of the dragonflies hatch and eat anything they can catch, favoring a carnivorous diet of organisms smaller than themselves. Adults of the species, especially males, congregate in swarms. Some populations of this dragonfly undertake migrations. Both the larvae and adult forms are efficient predators of mosquitoes, so they are a helpful insect to have in wet areas where mosquito infestations occur.

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Seattle Mariners, Chicago White Sox, Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees, Washington Nationals, and San Diego Padres. Thornton is the all-time American League leader in holds. College and minor league baseball In the 1995 MLB draft, Thornton was drafted by the Detroit Tigers in the 27th round but chose not sign with them. Thornton played college baseball for Grand Valley State University and was drafted by the Seattle Mariners in the first round as the 22nd overall pick in 1998 MLB draft. Thornton played briefly (only pitched 1 inning) with the Single A Everett AquaSox in the Northwest League. In and , Thornton was a starting pitcher with the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers in the Midwest League and showed improvement with his ball control and accuracy, striking out nearly 1 batter an inning. was probably Thornton's breakout year. Thornton started for San Bernardino Stampede in the California League (high-A ball) and had a 14‚Äì7 record, along with a stellar 2.52 ERA and 192 strikeouts in only 157 innings pitched. Thornton was then promoted to AA baseball and played with the San Antonio Missions of the Texas League in . Thornton, still a starting pitcher, pitched well with a 3.63 ERA and 44 strikeouts in 62 innings pitched. In , Thornton was briefly sent back down to high-A ball with the Inland Empire 66ers of the California League, but was quickly promoted back up AA ball with the San Antonio Missions again. He started only 4 games, but posted an incredible 0.36 ERA, with a 3‚Äì1 record, gave up only 8 hits in 25.1 innings of work and struck out 18 batters. His performance got him promoted that same year to AAA ball with the Tacoma Rainiers in the Pacific Coast League. Thornton had a shaky start to his career in Triple-A ball, starting 2 games and posting an 0‚Äì2 record and an 8.00 ERA. Thornton stayed with the Tacoma Rainiers in and posted a 7‚Äì5 record, along with a 5.20 ERA and 74 strikeouts in 83 innings pitched. Major Leagues Seattle Mariners 2004 Thornton made his MLB debut on June 27, , with the Mariners in a game against the San Diego Padres, pitching brilliantly over 4 innings, only allowing 3 hits and striking out one batter.

Newer variations blush reddish instead of yellow when ripe. It is more tart (described as 'spicy' and 'zingy') than a regular tomato, and it is an early cultivar. Compared to other tomato varieties, it can produce somewhat mealy fruits depending on growing conditions. Green Zebra was bred by Tom Wagner of Everett, Washington, and introduced in his Tater- Mater Seed Catalog in 1983. He first came up with the idea in the 1950s. Usually, green tomatoes are considered unripe and discarded or fried. However, Wagner was intrigued by the idea of a green tomato that was ready to eat. There is some controversy as to whether Green Zebra should be considered an heirloom tomato. Some people don't consider it an heirloom quite yet, while others consider it either an heirloom, \\"modern heirloom\\" or \\"created heirloom.\\" Classification Common varieties include Green Zebra, Black Zebra, Big Zebra, and Red Zebra. Planting information The Green Zebra tomato does not often obtain a disease; however, if the tomato has a disease the Green Zebra will not turn yellow, the plant will stay green until it wilts. The Green Zebra has a higher defense rate against diseases compared to other tomatoes. To grow this tomato one must plant seed 1‚Äì2 weeks after the temperature remains constant around 60‚Äì95 degrees Fahrenheit. The soil should be well drained and the seed must remain 1/8 inch deep within the ground under full sunlight. Plant the seed 12 to 36 inches apart and let harvest for 65‚Äì80 days. This plant is semi-annual and it is best to harvest in midsummer. One should transplant when plant is 6 inches high. Determining ripeness Because the original color of this tomato is green it can be difficult to tell when it is ripe. There are three main ways to decipher when Green Zebra tomatoes are ready to eat. First, one can grasp the tomato gently to feel for firmness. Secondly, one can tell by looking at when the Zebra's light green stripes turn to yellow. Thirdly, one can look at when the bottom of the yellow stripes begin to turn a blush color. Each of these stages represents a different ripening stage, so one must decide which stage of ripeness one prefers. Additionally, for a sweeter tomato leave it on the vine for a longer period of time. However, leaving it on the vine for too long can cause it to become mealy.

It features many knobs and sliders for patch editing and performance control ‚Äî features that some manufacturers, including Roland, had been omitting in the name of streamlining since the inception of the Yamaha DX7. The JD-800 thus became very popular with musicians who wished to take a hands- on approach to patch programming. The introduction in the manual states that Roland's intention with the JD-800 was to \\"return to the roots of synthesis\\".  Technology  The JD-800 employs Linear Arithmetic synthesis (introduced and made famous by the Roland D-50), which combines sample playback with digital synthesis. The JD-800 has 108 built-in waveforms, which can be expanded via PCM cards. The waveforms span a variety of categories such as analog synthesizers, acoustic instruments, and voices. Many of these waveforms are very short and are used primarily for the attack portion of a sound, while longer ones are used for the sustained part of a sound. The JD-800 was Roland's first instrument to have its core presets developed entirely in the United States, under a short-lived branch of its R&D-LA; office in Culver City, California. The core sampled waveforms and factory presets of the JD-800 were created by Eric Persing.http://www.spectrasonics.net/company/other/ep- roland.php A patch, or single sound, in the JD-800 consists of up to four tones. As every tone consists of an almost completely independent synthesizer voice, a patch could be considered a combination of up to four different synthesizers. In Single mode the JD-800 plays one patch at a time, but in Multi mode it is possible to play five different patches over MIDI, plus a \\"special\\" patch. The special patch has different waveforms assigned to the 61 different keys on the keyboard, so is used for drums and percussion sounds. The JD-800 has one effects section. In Single mode, seven effects can be used simultaneously, in series, so all tones in a patch go through the same effects. In Multi mode, three effects can be used at the same time, with all patches sharing the same effects, though any of the patches can be routed to bypass the effects. Editing and playing Using the Layer buttons, the four tones of a patch can be switched on and off while playing. When in Edit mode, the Layer buttons are used to choose which tone can be edited using the sliders on the front panel. The Palette sliders allow the player to edit the last active parameter of all four tones individually at the same time. While playing, the Palette sliders can be used like a mixer to set the balance between the four tones in a patch. However, due to the limited accuracy of the sliders, and because edited parameters jump from the value in memory to the value corresponding to the position of the slider, moving the sliders while playing tends to cause sudden jumps in the sound. The JD-800 manual states: \\"[T]he original purpose of the synthesizer was to 'create sound'. It's easy to simply select a preset you like, but that sound will always be 'someone else's sound'. We at Roland asked, 'Why don't we return to the roots of synthesis; the enjoyment of creating original sounds?' ‚Ä¶ 'Creating sounds' may seem like a highly technical process, but it's actually just a matter of moving a slider to make the sound change! This is easy for anyone, and the sounds that you get will always be your very own.\\" JD-990 Roland released the JD-990 Super JD in 1993. This is an enhanced, rackmount sound module version of the JD-800 with a larger display, and the ability to expand the device with PCM cards for extra sounds. Roland JD-990 rack  Expandability  The JD-800 was expandable by the inclusion of slots for PCM cards (for additional wavesforms), and RAM cards (for additional patches). Roland produced a number of expansion kits consisting of a pair of cards ‚Äî a PCM card containing new samples, and a RAM card containing a bank of new presets. PCM add-on cards Roland later released eight add-on cards for the JD 800: # SL-JD80-01 Drums & Percussion STANDARD # SL-JD80-02 Drums & Percussion DANCE # SL-JD80-03 Rock Drums # SL- JD80-04 Strings Ensemble # SL-JD80-05 Brass Section # SL-JD80-06 Grand Piano # SL-JD80-07 Guitar Collection # SL-JD80-08 Accordion Notable users * 1 Giant Leap * A Guy Called GeraldThe Classic Album: A Guy Called Gerald - 28 Gun Bad Boy, Future Music, FM230, September 2010, page 20 * Armin van Buuren * Coldcut * Future Bible Heroes * Gary Barlow * Jean-Michel Jarre * Labrinth * Laurent Garnier * Mouse on Mars * Tom Lord-Alge * Kevin Moore (Dream Theater) Notes Further reading  * External links * Vintage Synth Explorer page * Harmony Central reviews * JD800Center -Fan page * JD-800 page at Dancetech * Retrosound - JD-800 info, demo and pics * JD-800 Info/pictures/sounds (Flemish/Dutch) * Convert JD-800 Sysex messages to CC messages * Polynominal JD800 manual, schematics and audio demos * GreatSynthesizers JD-800 test report and audio demos JD-800 Category:Digital synthesizers Category:Polyphonic synthesizers ","title":"Roland JD-800"},{"id":"5819338","text":"Walter Ehrlich (16 May 1896 in Berlin ‚Äì 26 December 1968 in Bad Ragaz, Canton of St. Gallen, Switzerland) was a German philosopher.

He attended the K√∂niglich Franz√∂sisches Gymnasium (Royal French Gymnasium) in Berlin until Easter of 1914. After that, he studied mathematics and theoretical physics at the Technische Hochschule in Berlin-Charlottenburg. In 1915 he joined the military and participated in the eastern campaign until October 1915. During this time, he contracted a prolonged illness, which continued until the end of the summer of 1917. In October 1917 he enrolled in the University of Berlin to study philosophy and broke off his studies at the end of 1918. In Berlin, Ehrlich attended lectures by professors Ernst Cassirer, Max Dessoir, Benno Erdmann, Alois Riehl, Friedrich Julius Schmidt and Ernst Troeltsch. After February 1919, he began philosophical and literary studies as a regular student at the University of Heidelberg under Heinrich Maier, Heinrich Rickert, Hans Driesch, Karl Jaspers, Max von Waldberg, Friedrich Gundolf (Friedrich Leopold Gundelfinger), Friedrich Neumann and Leonardo Olschki (1885-1961). Heinrich Maier (1867-1933), a philosopher who taught at the University of Heidelberg from 1918‚Äì1922, stimulated and encouraged Ehrlich with his doctoral dissertation, which was titled Der Freiheitsbegriff bei Kant und Schopenhauer (1920) (The Concept of Freedom in Kant and Schopenhauer).

He succeeded to the throne when his father Maharaja Suraj Mal died in 1763. At the time of Maharaja Suraj Mal's death in 1763, Jawahar Singh was in Farrukhnagar. Early life  During Abdali's invasion of India in 1757, he attacked Ballabhgarh. The fort was put under siege, Jawahar Singh who was besieged in the fort had to escape from the fort in the night as defence of the fort was not possible in face of heavy bombardments of Abdali's guns. After taking the city Abdali sent his generals Jahan Khan and Najib Khan with 20,000 men to attack Jat territory and holy city of Mathura. According to Jadunath Sarkar Marathas fled from the north and not a single maratha soldier fought for holy city of Mathura which had many holiest of Vaishnav shrines, their \\"Hindupat-Padshahi\\" didn't involve duty to protect. But the Jats were determined to defend this sacred city. Jawahar Singh with 10,000 men blocked the path of Afghans. In the fight that followed almost ten to twelve thousand men died on both sides and remnants of Jat army had to retreat. Afghans subsequently carried out a general massacre in unfortified city of Mathura. The people were looted, their property plundered and act of iconoclasm followed. Military achievements In 1764 Jawahar Singh attacked Najib Khan and later bombarded Delhi. He enlisted help of Sikh chiefs for the campaign. He also asked help of Malhar Rao Holkar. The Ruhelas were besieged in the fort and peace negotiations were carried out. Jawahar Singh was also desperate for peace because he realized that Holkar was double dealing with him and was in secret negotiation with Najib Khan. The campaign wasn't much of a success as Jawahar Singh had spent more money then he received. Jawahar Singh also defeated Marathas under Holkar near Dholpur in 1766, when Holkar tried to help his brother Nahar Singh to gain the throne. Jawahar Singh had to retreat after some time when Raghunath Rao came to north Malwa. In 1767 after his recent success against Marathas, he surprised the maratha garrisons in Kalpi and attacked Maratha territory, maratha local agent fled and whole area came under the rule of Jawahar Singh. Battle of Maonda and Mandholi The battle of Mandoli followed the growing enmity between Jat Rajah of Bharatpur and Madho Singh of Jaipur state. Jawahar Singh the ruler of Bharatpur state had defeated his step brother Nahar Singh earlier thus making him escape to the nearby Jaipur state in refuge. The insult meted out at himself made Nahar Singh desperate. Hence he succumbed to death by poisoning himself leaving his widow behind in the Jaipur state. Jawahar now demanded his widow, who is described by Jadunath Sarkar as one of the most beautiful women on the earth. Further Jawahar was also keeping his eyes upon the Narnol district, which was a territory of Jaipur state. The Jats along with their Sikh allies had made several incursion into the Jaipur state and their unchecked aggression made Madho Singh intrigue against Jawahar and the Bharatpur state. In 1767, Jawahar Singh allied with the ruler of Vijay Singh of Marwar state; and marched through Jaipur territory with his whole army along with artillery to meet Vijay Singh at Pushkar. An agreement was signed between Vijay Singh and Jawahar Singh to oust the Marathas from the north. The meeting between the two was not liked by the Madho Singh. According to Jadunath Sarkar Madho Singh in his letter to Vijay Singh reprimanded him for sitting equally with a \\"peasant's son\\" and a mere servant of Jaipur. Jawahar when returning from Pushkar thus attacked the villages of Jaipur in revenge and looted them besides molesting the villagers. The Kachwaha army followed them and at Mandoli, near border of Bharatpur state, Kachwahas delivered their attack and battle broke out. The Rajput artillery had lagged behind giving the Jats initial success. But, later they had to escape into their territory after fierce battle which resulted in heavy casualties from both sides. Baggage and Guns of Bharatpur state had to be abandoned in the battlefield while retreating. The Rajputs under Madho Singh then decided to invade the Bharatpur state to follow-up their victory. Another battle was fought at Kama resulting in Jawahar's defeat and retreat of Bharatpur army along with Sikh mercenary. The Rajputs later departed due to arrival of fresh contingent of 20,000 Sikhs, who were employed by Jawahar Singh. Death He was assassinated by one of his favourite soldiers in August 1768.

Overview The Synthex was conceived and developed by independent Italian designer Mario Maggi, who then gained the financial backing of the Elka company of Italy, who produced the synthesizer from 1981 to 1985. Elka, a company more noted for its organs, had previously introduced their Rhapsody 490, 610 string machine, the monophonic Solist 505 and the big combo organ/synth X-705. A total of 1850 units were produced. Today is a highly sought-after instrument which recently reached quotations around 8,000 GBP.http://www.rlmusic.co.uk/rlm3/elka-synthex-mk3-2/ It was succeeded by the Elka EK-22 (based on the CEM3396 chip which was also featured in e.g. Oberheim's Matrix line of synthesizers) and the Elka EK-44 (based on Yamaha's 4-OP FM). Features and architecture The Synthex is an 8-voice analog synthesizer with 2 oscillators per note, separate envelope generators, and chorus. The use of stable DCOs (digitally controlled analog oscillators) and oscillator cross modulation of pulse width and a multimode filter made it unique in its time. Unusually, the Synthex also contained a built in real-time and step-time 4-track monophonic sequencer with real-time transposition. The four different sequencer tracks can have different length and sounds (Upper/Lower can be allocated to different tracks). Also it is possible to insert rests between notes as well as length of notes. Sequences and patches could be dumped to analog cassette tape through an audio interface. Each of the eight voices has 2 DCOs with selectable waveform. The Synthex has three keyboard modes. 8 voice single sound (both Lower/Upper voices), Split with user selected split point (4 voices Lower/4 voices Upper) or Double which reduce the polyphony to four voices. Later versions implemented basic MIDI functions. Instead of traditional pitchbend/modulation wheels, the Synthex employs a joystick which allows for greater variable real- time control over the two LFOs, oscillator and filter modulation. The 6 sliders beside the joystick assign what (LFO, osc and filter) goes to the joystick. Voices can also be layered or split across the keyboard. Other features include the onboard digital Ring-Modulator, Chorus effect and Dual or Layer modes available.Paul Wiffen, \\"Elka Synthex\\", Sound On Sound, Dec 1999Julian Colbeck, Keyfax Omnibus Edition, MixBooks, 1996, p. 20-21 Users Jean-Michel Jarre used the Synthex for the laser harphttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnN6pQ0SJOs&feature;=player_embedded sound on his Rendez-Vous album.

There are also aviation training facilities, a fuel farm, a solar power plant and two MRO facilities. As of 2019 March, RGIA is the sixth busiest airport by passenger traffic in India.https://www.aai.aero/sites/default/files/traffic-news/Mar2K19Annex3.pdf The airport served about 21.4 million passengers in fiscal year 2018‚Äì19. The airport serves as a hub for Alliance Air (India), Blue Dart Aviation, SpiceJet, Lufthansa Cargo, Quikjet Cargo, TruJet and IndiGo. It is a focus city for Air India. History A 2018 stamp sheet dedicated to the 10th anniversary of Rajiv Gandhi International Airport Planning (1997‚Äì2004) The existing commercial airport, Begumpet Airport, was unable to handle rising passenger traffic. The state government lead by then chief minister N. Chandrababu Naidu initially considered converting Hakimpet Air Force Station to civilian use; however, the Air Force refused. When the State proposed the construction of a new airport for the Air Force, the Ministry of Defence suggested the State consider sites south of Begumpet Airport. By October 1998, the State had narrowed down to three possible locations for the new airport: Bongloor, Nadergul and Shamshabad. Due to its convenient location near two highways (NH 44 and NH 765) and a railway line, Shamshabad was selected in December 1998. In November 2000, under the N. Chandrababu Naidu government and the Airports Authority of India (AAI) signed a memorandum of understanding on the greenfield airport project, establishing it as a public‚Äìprivate partnership. The State and AAI together would hold a 26% stake in the project, while the remaining 74% would be allotted to private companies. Through a bidding process the Shamshabad international airport with already land acquired of 5000 acres is in government possession and N. Chandrababu Naidu assigned bid to consortium consisting of Grandhi Mallikarjuna Rao(GMR Group) and Malaysia Airports Holdings Berhad was chosen as the holder of the 74% stake. In December 2002, Hyderabad International Airport Ltd (HIAL), later renamed GMR Hyderabad International Airport Limited (GHIAL), was created as a special purpose entity, into which the State, AAI and GMR‚ÄìMAHB placed their stakes. In September 2003, the members of GHIAL signed a shareholders' agreement, as well as an agreement for state subsidy of over . A concession agreement between GHIAL and the Central Government was signed in December 2004, stipulating that no airport within a radius of RGIA could be operated. Thus, the closure of Begumpet Airport was required. Construction and opening (2005‚Äì2008) Check-in area of the terminal Departures area The project was forwarded by Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy gained power and Construction began on 16 March 2005 when Sonia Gandhi laid the foundation stone. Two days prior, the Central Government had named the airport after former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who had undergone pilot training in Hyderabad. The naming resulted in opposition from the Telugu Desam Party (TDP). At Begumpet Airport, the international terminal was named after Rajiv Gandhi while the domestic terminal was named after TDP founder N. T. Rama Rao; the TDP wanted to continue this naming convention at the new airport. However, the new airport has only one terminal. Roughly three years after the foundation stone laying ceremony, the airport was inaugurated on 14 March 2008 amid protests. The Telugu Desam Party (TDP) repeated its demand for the naming of the domestic terminal. In addition, on 12 and 13 March, 20,000 AAI employees had conducted a strike against the closure of Begumpet Airport, as well as that of HAL Airport in Bangalore, fearing they would lose their jobs. RGIA was originally scheduled to open to commercial operations on 16 March 2008; however, the date was delayed due to protests from some airlines over the high ground handling rates at the airport. Once the rates were reduced, the launch date was set for 23 March 2008. Although Lufthansa Flight 752 from Frankfurt was scheduled to be the first flight to land at RGIA, two SpiceJet flights landed earlier. However, the Lufthansa flight still received the planned ceremonial welcome upon its 12:25 am arrival. Later developments (2009‚Äìpresent) In September 2011, SpiceJet launched its regional hub at RGIA, using its new Bombardier Q400 aircraft. The airline, which chose Hyderabad due to its central location in the country, flies to several Tier-II and Tier-III cities from the airport. Regional airline TruJet too opened a hub at RGIA upon commencing operations in July 2015. In November 2014, the Ministry of Civil Aviation resolved that the domestic terminal of RGIA would be named after N. T. Rama Rao, resulting in protests from members of the Rajya Sabha. Airport officials remained unsure as to how the naming would occur. Ownership RGIA is owned and operated by GMR Hyderabad International Airport Ltd (GHIAL), a public‚Äìprivate venture. It is composed of public entities Airports Authority of India (13%) and the Government of Telangana (13%), as well as a private consortium between GMR Group (63%) and Malaysia Airports Holdings Berhad (11%). Per the concession agreement between GHIAL and the Central Government, GHIAL has the right to operate the airport for 30 years, with the option to continue doing so for another 30 years. Facilities Structure The airport is spread over 5,495 acres. Out of which 2000 acres have been developed towards airport needs which mainly constitutes 1,700 acres of land is airside and 300 acres of land is landside facilities. The remaining 3,495 acres is expansion of the airport. No further land will be acquired. The airport is fully planned within 5,495 acres. Runways The airport has two runways: * Runway 09L/27R: . * Runway 09R/27L: , ILS equipped. Runway 09R/27L, the original and primary runway, is long enough to be able to receive the Airbus A380 which is the world's largest passenger aircraft. Originally a taxiway, runway 09L/27R was inaugurated in February 2012. Its length is shorter than the main runway and able to handle aircraft such as the Airbus A340 and Boeing 747. It is mainly used when runway 09R/27L is undergoing maintenance, and as air traffic to the airport rises it will be used more often. North of these runways are the three parking aprons: the cargo, passenger terminal and MRO aprons. The passenger terminal apron contains parking stands on both the north and south sides of the terminal. Terminal RGIA has a single integrated passenger terminal, which covers and has a capacity for 12 million passengers per year. The western side of the terminal handles international flights while the eastern side is for domestic operations. There are 46 immigration counters and 96 check-in desks with 19 kiosks for self check-in. There is a total of nine gates, seven of which are located on the south side of the terminal and the other two on the north side. Three gates are each equipped with two jetways to accelerate the handling of widebody aircraft. Public lounge facilities are provided by Plaza Premium Lounge, which operates three lounges in the terminal; there are also three separate lounges for VIPs. The pre-security \\"airport village\\" is a meeting point for passenger pick-up. The airport has 57 parking bays 47 remote parking bays and 10 aero bridges. In January 2019 the GHAIL added another 26 parking bays which takes a total of 83 parking bays. Airlines and destinations The airport serves 18 international destinations and 45 domestic destinations, making a total of 63 destinations with 18 foreign carriers and 9 domestic carriers. Passenger Cargo GMR Aerospace Park The GMR Aerospace Park contains several facilities primarily related to the aviation sector. It has a special economic zone, which includes a Free Trade and Warehousing Zone, as well as a domestic tariff area. Aviation training The GMR Aviation Academy is located in the park. It was established in 2009 in co-operation with the International Air Transport Association (IATA), International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), Airports Council International (ACI) and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA). The academy offers programmes related to airport operations, which are accredited by the listed organisations. The park also includes the Asia Pacific Flight Training (APFT) academy, an initiative of GMR Group and Asia Pacific Flight Training. Launched in 2013, it provides pilot training courses. GMR Aero Technic Ltd MRO The MRO operated by GMR Aero Technic Ltd is one of two MROs at the airport. Built at a cost of and inaugurated in March 2012, the facility can handle up to five aircraft simultaneously. Initially, the MRO was a joint venture between GMR Group and Malaysian Aerospace Engineering (MAE), a subsidiary of Malaysia Airlines. However, amid its parent's poor financial situation following the Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 incident, MAE was unable to fund the MRO, which had been accruing losses. GMR bought out MAE's stake in December 2014. GMR Aero Technic Ltd is the only one MRO in private sector in India with extensive capability to maintain Airbus A320 family aircraft, Boeing 737, ATR 72/42 and Bombardier DHC Q400 aircraft. GMR Aero Technic is a world class aircraft maintenance organisation approved by EASA and Directorate General of Civil Aviation (India) and various civil aviation authorities and one of the few MROs certified for AS9110 standards in South East Asia region. Other facilities Air India MRO The other MRO is operated by Air India Engineering Services Limited (AIESL), a subsidiary of Air India. Spread over , the facility cost to construct and was opened in May 2015. Cargo terminal The cargo terminal, with a Lufthansa Cargo Boeing 777F being unloaded The cargo terminal is located west of the passenger terminal. It covers and can handle of cargo annually. The terminal is operated by Hyderabad Menzies Air Cargo Pvt Ltd, a joint venture between GHIAL (51%) and Menzies Aviation (49%). Within the terminal is the Pharma Zone, a temperature- controlled facility designed for storing pharmaceuticals. The first such facility to be opened at an Indian airport, it is important to RGIA as pharmaceuticals account for 70% of exports from the airport. In May 2011, Lufthansa Cargo launched its first pharma hub at the airport. Fuel farm The airport has a fuel farm consisting of three storage tanks, with a total capacity for of jet fuel. The tanks are connected to the apron via underground pipelines. Reliance Industries built and operates the farm, which can be used by any oil company under an open-access model. Solar power plant In January 2016, GHIAL commissioned a 5 MW solar power plant near RGIA, which will be used to serve the airport's energy needs. It was built over at a cost of . Over the following two to three years, the capacity of the plant will be raised to 30 MW, allowing RGIA to become fully solar powered. Airport hotel Novotel hotel at Hyderabad Airport The Novotel Hyderabad Airport, located from RGIA, was opened in October 2008. The hotel includes 305 rooms, two restaurants and a lounge for aircrew. It was initially owned by GHIAL before being shifted to subsidiary GMR Hotels and Resorts Ltd. Owing to high losses from low occupancy, GMR began seeking buyers of the hotel in August 2015. Connectivity Taxi stand outside the terminal Road RGIA is connected to the city of Hyderabad by NH 44, NH 765 and the Outer Ring Road. In October 2009, the PV Narasimha Rao Expressway was completed between Mehdipatnam and Aramghar, where it joins NH 44. This long flyover which is 13 km has reduced travel time between the airport and the city to 30‚Äì40 minutes and also provides three entry and exit points. The \\"Pushpak ‚Äì Airport Liner\\" service of the Telangana State Road Transport Corporation provides bus transportation to different parts of the city. It was launched in December 2012 to replace GMR's Aero Express service. Rail Under the second phase of the Hyderabad Metro Rail project, a rail link between Raidurg/Gachibowli and RGIA will be constructed. As of late 2015, feasibility studies on the phase are underway. In August 2019, K. T. Rama Rao said that state cabinet has approved the Hyderabad Metro Airport Express Link from Raidurg to the airport. The closest Indian Railways station is Umdanagar. Future plans In 2009, GHIAL decided to postpone the second phase due to lower growth in passenger traffic than anticipated. The phase was revived in late 2015, as the airport is expected to reach its capacity in 2016. The first leg of this phase will bring the capacity to 18 million passengers annually, and the second leg will raise it to 20 million. The passenger terminal will be enlarged with additional security lanes, check-in counters and other facilities, and solar panels will be built on the roof. In October 2017 GHIAL CEO SGK Kishore confirmed that the airport expansion would start by January 2018 and it is expected to completed by the end of 2019. The airport terminal will be expanded to include 48 aerobridges, a larger arrival area for faster check out and more check-in desks. In the midst of the expansion to 25 million, the grant for the 50 million PPA expansion was awarded. The final phase of expansion will increase the terminal capacity to 80 million passengers annually.

Darra Goldstein, Oxford University Press, 2015, p. 1 is pie served with ice cream. The French culinary phrase √† la mode used in the name of this American dessert is also encountered in other dishes such as boeuf √† la mode (beef √† la mode). History Pie √† la Mode was allegedly invented at the Cambridge Hotel in Cambridge, Washington County, New York, in the 1890s. Charles Watson Townsend, in Cambridge, NY The claim is that while visiting the hotel, Charles Watson Townsend ordered a slice of apple pie with ice cream. When asked by another guest what he called the dish, he named it Pie √† la Mode. Townsend subsequently ordered it by that name every day during his stay. When he later ordered it by that name at Delmonico's Restaurant in New York City, the waiter responded that he had never heard of it.The Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets, ed. Darra Goldstein, Oxford University Press, 2015, p. 1 Townsend chastised the waiter by stating: The manager, when called by the waiter, declared \\"Delmonico's never intends that any other shall get ahead of it... Forthwith, pie √† la mode will be featured on the menu every day\\". A reporter for the New York Sun newspaper overheard the disturbance and wrote an article about it the next day. Soon, Pie √† la Mode became a standard on menus around the United States. When Charles Watson Townsend died on May 20, 1936, a controversy developed as to who really invented Pie √† la Mode. The New York Times reported that ‚ÄúPie √† la Mode‚Äù was first invented by Townsend at the Cambridge Hotel in Cambridge, New York in the late 1800s. It was later reported by several sources that Townsend ordered pie and ice cream at the Cambridge Hotel in 1896, and thus invented the dessert. The legend also states that a reporter from The Sun newspaper in New York overheard a conversation between the manager of Delmonico's Restaurant and Charles Townsend. The reporter was said to have written about the incident in the very next issue of The Sun. John Gieriet in Duluth, Minnesota A reporter from the St. Paul Pioneer Press read Townsend‚Äôs obituary in the New York Times and considered that the Times had incorrectly attributed the invention of pie √† la mode to Townsend. The newspaper accordingly ran a story on May 23, 1936 about how the dessert was in fact invented inside a Superior Street restaurant in Duluth, Minnesota in the 1880s. The St. Paul newspaper indicated the Duluth restaurant specifically served ice cream with blueberry pie. This was over a decade before Townsend first ordered pie with ice cream in New York, making Duluth the true birthplace of pie √† la mode. A grand opening bill of fare for the Hotel la Perl was published in the March 26, 1885, issue of the Duluth Daily Tribune. The hotel was located at 501-503 West Superior Street in Duluth. The menu showed the hotel restaurant serving both vanilla ice cream and blueberry pie. The owner of the hotel was John Gieriet. He was born in Tavetsch, Switzerland on February 6, 1829. He later moved to France where he learned to speak French. Gieriet moved to the United States in 1854. In 1856, Gieriet was put in charge of food service at the White House under the administration of President Franklin Pierce. He continued in that position into the late 1850s when he served under the administration of President James Buchanan. The Gieriets moved to Duluth in 1885 and purchased the Commercial Hotel, which had been built in 1884 by William Dambruck. John re-named the building ‚ÄúHotel La Perl.‚Äù It was a large two-story wood-frame building with a flat roof. A saloon, that was located on the first floor, was converted into a restaurant and the rear laundry room was remodeled into a kitchen. On the Hotel la Perl‚Äôs first day of business, Gieriet served up a fancy dinner that included French pickles, oysters, French peas, and Lake Superior trout. For dessert, he served warm blueberry pie and vanilla ice cream. Gieriet called the popular treat ‚Äúpie √† la mode.‚Äù It was reported in the Duluth Herald that Duluthians in the 1880s often mispronounced the local invention as ‚Äú mode.‚Äù In 1886, the Duluth Weekly Tribune stated the Hotel la Perl had gained a ‚Äúfirst-class reputation‚Äù under Gieriet's management. John continued to operate the Hotel la Perl until his wife became very ill in 1886. He ended up selling the hotel in August of that year. Pie √† la mode wasn‚Äôt John Gieriet‚Äôs only invention. He received a United States patent for a railroad car ventilating apparatus on June 20, 1882. He also received a patent on October 30, 1899, for a type of fire escape. By 1910, Gieriet had moved to New York City, where he died on May 22, 1912, at the age of 83.Flaherty, Mike: The Legends of Pie √† la Mode, 2012 (Duluth Public Library) See also * List of pies, tarts and flans * b≈ìuf √† la mode, a French dish similar to a pot roast References Category:Pies Category:Ice cream ","title":"Pie √† la Mode"},{"id":"5819528","text":"Hatakeyama (written: Áï†Â±± or ÁïëÂ±±) is a Japanese surname.

It was originally a flying boat squadron of the Royal Canadian Air Force during the Second World War. It currently operates the C-130 Hercules and the CH-149 Cormorant in transport plus search and rescue roles at CFB Greenwood. History No. 413 Squadron was created as the third RCAF squadron attached to RAF Coastal Command and equipped with PBY Catalina flying boats. 413 Squadron flew reconnaissance and anti-submarine operations over the North Atlantic under Coastal Command until beginning the move to Ceylon in March 1942.No. 413 (Tusker) Squadron, accessed September 2020. It probably came under command of Air Forces in India once the squadron fully arrived in April at Koggala. The squadron gained fame for the actions of Squadron Leader Leonard Birchall, who detected a large Japanese task force approaching Ceylon. This allowed time for the defenders to prepare, and foiled what could have been a major blow to the Royal Navy in the Indian Ocean. The squadron made reconnaissance flights over the Indian Ocean until 1945. It was stood down in January 1945 and sent back to the UK to reequip, prossibly preparatory to transferred to RAF Bomber Command. However nothing came of this and the squadron was disbanded in February 1945 at Bournmoth. Reformed at RCAF Rockcliffe on April 1, 1947, it took over the duties of No. 13 (Photographic) Squadron. It operated in this role until November 1, 1950. The squadron reformed again on August 1, 1951, as a fighter squadron at CFB Bagotville. Equipped with the F-86 Sabre they deployed to Zweibr√ºcken, Germany. The squadron stood down on April 7, 1957, and was then reformed on May 1 operating the Avro CF-100 Canuck at Bagotville. The squadron again disbanded on December 30, 1961. The squadron was reactivated at CFB Summerside on July 8, 1968, in its current role of a Transportation and Rescue Squadron. With the closure of Summerside, the squadron relocated to CFB Greenwood on June 10, 1991. On July 13, 2006, 413 Squadron suffered the first fatal crash of a Cormorant in Canadian service when a CH-149 (Aircraft 149914) based at CFB Greenwood crashed while conducting a night training exercise near Canso, Nova Scotia. Killed in the incident were Sgt. Duane Brazil, 39; Master Cpl. Kirk Noel, 33; and Cpl. Trevor McDavid, 31, four other crew members were injured. On August 21, 2015, LCol Scott Murphy handed over command of 413 Sqn to LCol James Marshall. Anticipating a cargo launch over Cape Breton Island as part of a Search and Rescue Training Exercise. Operations 413 Transport and Rescue Squadron (TRS) conducts search and rescue and airlift throughout an 1,800,000 square mile area in eastern Canada. The unit is made up of approximately 200 personnel including aircrew, an Aircraft maintenance section and administrative support. As the primary air search and rescue unit on Canada's East Coast, 413 Squadron crews cover an area extending from the south of Nova Scotia , north to Iqaluit on Baffin Island as far west as Quebec City and east out to the middle of the Atlantic. The Joint Rescue Coordination Centre, Halifax (JRCC) operationally controls one Hercules and four Cormorant Aircraft for primary Search and Rescue response. 413 Squadron has crews on standby 24-hours a day to respond to marine vessels or Aircraft in distress, to carry out medical evacuations, or search for missing persons year round. 413 Squadron has an intimate working relationship with the non-profit Civil Air Search and Rescue Association (CASARA) in the Maritimes and Newfoundland/Labrador. Both the Hercules and the Cormorant carry out annual visits to each of the zones in the Halifax Search and Rescue Region to assist in the training of CASARA member as spotters. 413 Squadron is also tasked by 1 Canadian Air Division (1 CAD) to provide one Hercules for global strategic transport.

The film also features Lionel Atwill, Luis Alberni, Melville Cooper, and future star Lana Turner, who has a bit part. Based on the play Ladies and Gentlemen by Ernest Vajda, the film is about the famous eighteenth-century British actor David Garrick, who travels to France for a guest appearance at the Com√©die Fran√ßaise. When the French actors hear rumours that he said he will teach them the art of acting, they devise a plot to teach him a lesson. Though often overlooked by critics in favor of Whale's horror films, The Great Garrick was chosen by Jonathan Rosenbaum for his alternative list of the Top 100 American Films. Plot In London in 1750, renowned English actor David Garrick announces onstage that he has been invited to Paris to work with the prestigious Com√©die-Fran√ßaise. A fop in a box seat declares that the French want Garrick to teach them how to act, and the audience chants, \\"Teach the French!\\" The playwright Beaumarchais attributes the remark to Garrick himself. The outraged French actors, led by their president, Picard, take over the inn where he will be staying, and Beaumarchais devises a plot to humiliate Garrick publicly. On the road to Paris, Garrick meets Jean Cabot, an elderly admirer who once acted with him in Hamlet and now works as a Com√©die-Fran√ßaise prompter. Cabot‚Äîwho was tossed out of the Comedie-Fran√ßaise meeting when he protested that Garrick might be innocent‚Äîhas ridden non-stop for two days to warn the actor, although he does not know the details of the plot. Cabot advises him to travel straight to Paris. Garrick decides to stop at the inn as planned and play along, despite the misgivings of his valet/companion Tubby and Cabot's concern that there may be violence. At the inn, Picard tries to rally his cast, but meets with temperament and histrionics on every side, particularly from Basset, whose insistence on playing a madman is quite maddening. They plan to discomfort the Englishman with a near miss from a falling trunk; a seemingly fatal duel with swords; a shootout between a husband and his wife's lover; Basset's mad waiter; and finally, an attack from a violent blacksmith. Garrick and Tubby arrive at the inn, and the \\"blacksmith,\\" drunk and lacking a script, mistakes his cue and smashes one of the carriage wheels. Garrick adroitly steps out of the way of the falling luggage and is unperturbed when the duelists cross swords over his dinner. A complication arises in mid-performance when Germaine Dupont, Countess de la Corbe, appears at the inn. Her coach has broken down. Garrick believes she is one of the actresses, when she is actually fleeing a marriage arranged by her father. He plays along, offering her his room. Over the course of the evening, they fall in love. After an entertaining evening, Garrick overhears the \\"blacksmith\\" reviewing his script and reminding himself to hit the anvil with his hammer and not Garrick's head. He disguises himself as the blacksmith and, pretending to be drunk, tells the aghast troupe that he has struck and killed their intended victim. Tubby rages at them and demands that someone call out the guard. The actors plan to flee. Then Garrick reveals his identity. He does not betray Cabot. There is no need, as he easily reveals the flaws in their performances. Garrick adds that he admires the Com√©die Fran√ßaise and never said anything so stupid as the remark that precipitated this farce. In her room, he storms at Germaine for her bad acting, including her bad kissing. Infuriated, she responds that she does not have much experience, but does not correct his mistake. Garrick leaves her with the furious advice that she quit the stage. Downstairs, Picard apologizes on behalf of the company and begs Garrick to join them in Paris. Garrick graciously accepts. At his premiere in Paris, about to play Don Juan for the first time, Garrick searches the stage for Germaine. He learns from Picard that she is not a member of the company. Realizing that she was telling the truth and that he actually loves her, he declares that he is too distraught to perform ever again, unless he finds her. He goes out to announce this to the audience and sees Germaine in a box, beaming. He is struck dumb. In the prompt box, Jean Cabot holds up a black board that reads: \\"I met her at the stable. I explained. She knows, understands, forgives, loves.\\" Inspired, Garrick launches into a speech about being in love. Germaine is at first delighted, then becomes worried when it seems he will reveal her name‚Äîhowever Garrick identifies his new love as la belle France. She tosses a flower to him.

Moreau Production The film was made by James Whale for Warner Brothers shortly after the troubled production of The Road Back which had met with controversy and opposition from the Nazi government, and strained his relationship with his bosses at Universal Pictures where he had worked for the past six years. The Garrick film was intended to be a more light-hearted effort. However, both it and his next film Port of Seven Seas were failures at the box office. Whale eventually returned to Universal where he saw out his contract largely by making B Movies. Reception The New York Times critic Frank Nugent praised the film and Aherne's performance: > Of the many legends about David Garrick, that almost legendary figure of the > 18th-century theater, count as one of the most amusing The Great Garrick ... > Brian Aherne (presents) Garrick as the young and handsome swashbuckler we > rather hoped to find. ... (The film) is an agile and picturesque farce > within a farce... most amusingly presented and humorously resolved. Variety called it: > ... a production of superlative workmanship fabricated from old prints of > the period, and acting by a fine cast in the flamboyant manner demanded by > the script...not without some very amusing angles. Fact is, it is a farce, > should be played as a farce with speed and increasing hilarity. Such, > however, is not the case. Whale's direction is geared to a slow tempo. His > romantic passages between Aherne and De Havilland are quite charming, but > much too long. In 1998, Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader included the film in his unranked list of the best American films not included on the AFI Top 100. In 2006, Dennis Schwartz wrote that this \\"neglected period farce deserves more attention and love; it's one of Whale's most joyous films and shows he can make great comedies outside of the horror genre... It's a thoroughly enjoyable romantic comedy, with the ensemble cast in fine form and under Whale's able direction it catches all the fun in the farce.\\" References Sources  External links   Category:1937 films Category:1930s historical comedy films Category:1937 romantic comedy films Category:American films Category:American historical comedy films Category:American black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:Films about actors Category:American films based on plays Category:Films set in the 1750s Category:Films set in London Category:Films set in Paris Category:Warner Bros. films Category:Films directed by James Whale Category:Films scored by Adolph Deutsch Category:David Garrick Category:American historical romance films Category:1930s historical romance films ","title":"The Great Garrick"},{"id":"5819582","text":"WCLG-FM is an Active Rock formatted broadcast radio station licensed to Morgantown, West Virginia, serving North-Central West Virginia. WCLG-FM is owned by West Virginia Radio Corporation and operated under their AJG Corporation licensee. History WCLG-FM Previous Logo On October 18, 1973, Freed Broadcasting Corporation applied for a construction permit to build what would become WCLG-FM. WCLG-FM began broadcasting on September 28, 1974 simulcasting 70% of sister-station WCLG Top 40 programming and its own progressive rock format. At the time of launch, WCLG-FM broadcast at a power of 3,000 watts. The meaning of the station's callsign comes from the initials of former WCLG-AM owner C. Leslie Golliday. The studios of WCLG-FM have remained in the same location since sister-station WCLG signed on in 1954, 343 High Street in Morgantown. In 1979, future owner Garry L. Bowers came on board as the station's general manager. In 1980, WCLG-FM took over the Top 40 programming which sister station WCLG had dropped two years earlier, when it switched to a Middle of the Road format. In 1983, WCLG-FM switched to a Contemporary Hit Radio format. Freed Broadcasting Corporation sold WCLG-FM and sister station WCLG to Bowers Broadcasting Corporation on March 15, 1985 for $715,000. In 1993, WCLG-FM switched its current Active Rock format. The following year, the station increased its transmitting power to 6,000 watts. Bowers Broadcasting Corporation owner Garry L. Bowers died on Christmas Eve of 2011. On September 25, 2013, Bowers widow Linda K. Bowers assumed control of the company. Sale The WCLG studios and sign along High Street in Morgantown, 2015. On September 26, 2013, Bowers entered into an agreement to sell WCLG-FM and sister station WCLG to AJG Corporation, for $1.8 Million. On October 21, 2013, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rescinded the transfer-of-ownership application after an objection by Joe Potter, Senior Vice President of IMG Sports. Potter contends there is \\"very close connections and operational control\\" between AJG Corporation and West Virginia Radio Corporation (WVRC). The co-directors of West Virginia Radio Corporation, John and David Raese, operate AJG Corporation as a trust for their descendents. Potter's complaint goes on to say that \\"IMG was close to finalizing a contract to air WVU sports\\" but was \\"prevented by the terms of AJG's purchase agreement\\" which barred Bowers Broadcasting Corporation from \\"'entering into any contract or agreement' without the consent of AJG\\". West Virginia Radio Corporation previously held the rights to West Virginia University sports before losing them to IMG Sports. West Virginia Radio Corporation filed a lawsuit against West Virginia University and IMG Sports, to retain the broadcast rights, which it lost in late August 2013. The FCC granted the ownership transfer on February 3, 2015 subject to several conditions regarding business relationships and communication between AJG and WVRC. An appeal of the grant conditions was denied by the FCC on September 16, 2015. Bowers Broadcasting subsequently filed applications for extension of the consummation of the transfer on October 23, 2015, January 29, 2016, April 22, 2016, July 22, 2016, and October 17, 2016. The last of these extension requests was denied by the FCC on November 30, 2016, and this denial was appealed on January 10, 2017. The transfer to AJG Corporation was eventually consummated on September 1, 2017. Programming Antenna on Jackson Street in Westover Weekdays used to begin with the nationally syndicated Lex and Terry Morning Show. In late 2016, the station began its own weekday morning show called \\"It's Better Than Your Morning Show Show\\". The station also has a news department which prepares and broadcasts local news reports on weekdays. The rest of the day was filled with local WCLG DJ's Marshall, and Jeff Miller, respectively. The station previously aired \\"The CLG Punk and Ska Show\\" on Tuesday Nights, featuring local and national punk and ska artists and bands. The show ended on April 15, 2014. On weekends, WCLG-FM once featured local DJs Whalen, Chuck, Chris, Zee Marie and Jeff Jasper. Weekend programs on WCLG-FM consist of \\"CLG Homegrown\\", featuring unsigned local artists and the nationally syndicated \\"HardDrive with Lou Brutus\\". As of Summer 2020, the CLG lineup includes the CLG Morning Show with Marshall and Dave, the CLG Workforce with Ashley, Afternoon Chaos with Chris Chaos, and Sweitzer, your Nighttime Rocker.

Life and career X Alfonso has been playing music since he was seven years old, ‚Äú When I was around 16 or 17, I started playing jazz and fusion music, working with troubadours and putting together my own arrangements and recordings.‚Äù X Alfonso started his career with a group called Estado de Animo while he was still at the music school. From early 1990s, when he graduated, he joined the Cuban group S√≠ntesis led by his parents Carlos Alfonso and Ele Vald√®s, as singer and composer or co-composer. ‚ÄúI arrived just as the group‚Äôs keyboard player was leaving, so I started off playing keyboards. Then I found myself on percussion and vocals. That‚Äôs how I learned to play the instruments, through necessity.‚Äù The group started as a vocal quartet, then turned to symphonic rock before going on to explore a fusion between Afro-Cuban music‚ÄîCuban roots‚Äîand contemporary music. X Alfonso explains: ‚Äúmy music has always revolved around roots and exploration. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm always trying to convey; I draw on folklore, on Cuba.‚Äù X Alfonso made six records with ‚ÄúS√≠ntesis‚Äù and has released four records of his own and is now working on releasing his fifth. X Alfonso started his solo career in 1998. His first record ‚ÄúMundo Real‚Äù in 2000 is a mix of jazz and fusion. The second ‚ÄúX mor√©‚Äù is more hip-hop, based on a blend of Big Band hits from the forties and the fifties. The third ‚ÄúDelirium Tremens‚Äù is more progressive, combining African drums, symphonic orchestra and flamenco. The fourth, ‚ÄúCivilizaci√≥n‚Äù, pulls together material from the first three records, and the fifth is a new record: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm currently working on ‚ÄúRevoluxion‚Äù (with an X). ‚ÄúRevoluxion‚Äù reflects a different style and another aspect of Cuban folklore, rumba, drawing on Afro-Cuban culture through a mix of rumba and funk, which is what I'm into now.‚Äù He is cousins with comedian Joey Diaz. As a video clip maker, he is one of the most awarded artists at the Lucas Awards in Cuba. In 2008-2009 he directed the documentary Sin t√≠tulo, about the daily universe of Cuban artists and conceived the Cuban Art Factory (FAC, in Spanish), which as of 2010 becomes a brand new space with transmedia vocation and where emerging young artists (musicians, filmmakers, painters, dancers) converge with others with a longer career. Since 2015, and with X Alfonso in front, FAC has become one of the most important cultural projects in the country, with an artistic proposal, an environment and an audience that have made it worthy of being considered one of the one hundred best places in the world, according to TIME magazine. In 2010 he received the title of Goodwill Ambassador of UNICEF for his artistic work with and for children.https://www.xalfonso.com/en/biography/ Musical Influence X Alfonso finds that today‚Äôs new Cuban generation is made of fusion, like his music, ‚ÄúCubans today are a mix of Spanish, African, English, French, Chinese... A melting pot that has a lot to offer to the pages of history.‚Äù And it's this culture that X Alfonso tries to show in his music. ‚ÄúThe people who come to see me are rappers, rockers, salseros, young, old.... I have a really broad audience because of the range of music I cover. I try to reflect all of this as a musician, drawing on different rhythms, melodies and harmonies. I‚Äôm always amazed to find myself exploring one area then something completely different‚Äîtotal opposites‚Äîand when I mix the two together it seems totally normal.‚Äù What interests X Alfonso about Cuba is the people, the people in the streets and the generations of young artists putting their art out there. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm basically working with street talent, and I try to show that Havana and Cuba have a whole lot to offer, like every country. It goes far beyond a simple performance.‚Äù Discography *Mundo Real (2000) *X Mor√© (2001) *Civilizaci√≥n (2005) *Revoluxion (2007) *Reverse (2011) *INSIDE (2020) References External links *http://www.worldmusiccentral.org/artists/artist_page.php?id=815 *http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1309263/ *https://web.archive.org/web/20061218205734/http://www.stageplanet.net:80/ *https://web.archive.org/web/20110518192419/http://www.havana- cultura.com:80/html/EN/cuban-music/x-alfonso/afro-cuban-music.html *https://www.xalfonso.com/en/biography/ Category:Cuban musicians Category:1970s births Category:Living people ","title":"X-Alfonso"},{"id":"5819595","text":"Faridpur Medical College (FMC) () is a government medical school in Bangladesh, established in 1992. It is located in Faridpur town, headquarters of Faridpur District. It is affiliated with University of Dhaka as a constituent college. It offers a five-year course of study leading to a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) degree. A one-year internship after graduation is compulsory for all graduates. The degree is recognised by the Bangladesh Medical and Dental Council. It also offers D-Ortho ( Diploma in Orthopedics) course, which is a two-year postgraduation degree on Orthopedics. The college is associated with 500-bed Faridpur Medical College Hospital (FMCH). Faridpur Medical College Journal (FMCJ) is the official journal of FMC. History The government of Bangladesh established Faridpur Medical College in 1992. The Institute started its journey on the campus of Medical Assistant Training School, Faridpur. In 2017, the college was shifted to the newly constructed campus in West Khabashpur, Faridpur. In 2011, the management of the college resolved to rename it Sheikh Hasina Medical College. In 2014, it was reported that Sheikh Hasina vetoed the name change. Students at the college demonstrated in 2015, calling for the reinstatement of the \\"carry on\\" examination system. The Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) degree programme is divided into four parts by the first, second, third, and final professional examinations. If a student fails one of these exams, they may sit it again six months later. Under the 2002 \\"carry on\\" system, students could continue taking classes in the next academic session while preparing to retake an exam. This system was strongly favoured by medical students, but strongly opposed by their teachers. The Bangladesh Medical and Dental Council eliminated \\"carry on\\" in 2013, after which students who failed a professional exam were not allowed to continue classes until they had passed it, causing them to lose up to a year in the process. Campus The college is located in west khabashpur with 500-bed FMCH lies about southwest, in the West Khabaspur neighbourhood. On 15 June 2017, FMC permanently shifted to their new campus which has twenty-five 5-6 storied buildings. There are 1 boy's hostel,2 girl's hostels & 2 hostels for the intern doctors. There is also a large playground behind the academic building. There is a nursing college affiliated with the hospital. It provides training for young nurses. There are also hostels for nurses near the hospital. Organization and administration The college is affiliated with Dhaka University as a constituent college.

Academics The college offers a five-year course of study, approved by the Bangladesh Medical and Dental Council (BMDC), leading to a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS) degree from Dhaka University. After passing the final professional examination, there is a compulsory one-year internship. The internship is a prerequisite for obtaining registration from the BMDC to practice medicine. Admission for Bangladeshis to the MBBS programme at all medical colleges in Bangladesh (government and private) is conducted centrally by the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS). It administers a written multiple choice question exam simultaneously throughout the country. Candidates are admitted based primarily on their score on this test, although grades at Secondary School Certificate (SSC) and Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSC) level also play a part. Admission for foreign students is based on their SSC and HSC grades. As of August 2017, the college is allowed to admit 141 students annually. Faridpur Medical College Journal (FMCJ) is the official journal of the college. It is a peer-reviewed, open access journal, published semi-annually in January and July. It accepts original research articles, review articles on topics of current interest, and interesting case reports.

It was one of the most elaborate and costly of Samuel Goldwyn's productions.The AFI Catalog of Feature Films: The Adventures of Marco Polo Plot Nicolo Polo shows treasures from China and sends his son Marco Polo (Gary Cooper) there with his assistant (and comic relief) Binguccio (Ernest Truex). They sail from Venice, are shipwrecked, and cross the desert of Persia and the mountains of Tibet to China, to seek out Peking and the palace of China's ruler, Kublai Khan (George Barbier). The philosopher/fireworks-maker Chen Tsu (H. B. Warner) is the first friend they make in the city, and invites them into his home for a meal of spaghetti. Children explode a firecracker, and Marco thinks it could be a weapon. Meanwhile, at the Palace, Ahmed (Basil Rathbone), the Emperor's adviser, harboring dubious ambitions of his own, convinces Emperor Kublai Khan that his army of a million men can conquer Japan. Kublai Khan promises Princess Kukachin (Sigrid Gurie) to the King of Persia. Marco, arriving at the palace, sees Kukachin praying for a handsome husband. Marco is granted an audience with the emperor at the same time as a group of ladies-in-waiting arrive; Kublai Khan lets Marco test the maidens to find out which are the most worthy. Marco tests them all with a question (\\"How many teeth does a snapping turtle have?\\"), and he sends off the ones who had incorrectly guessed the answer, as well as those who had told him the correct answer (none), retaining those saying they did not know. His reasoning behind this is that they are the perfect ladies-in-waiting, not overly intelligent, and honest. Kublai agrees and Marco immediately becomes a favored guest. Ahmed shows Marco his private tower with vultures and executes a spy via a trapdoor into a lion pit. Kukachin tells Marco that she is going to marry the King of Persia, but, having fallen in love with her, he shows her what a kiss is. A guard tells Ahmed, who vows to keep Marco out of the way. Ahmed then advises Kublai Khan to send Marco into the desert to spy on suspected rebels. Kukachin warns Marco of the deceiving Ahmed.

Frank S. Nugent of The New York Times wrote that \\"we could never forget for a moment that it was all make-believe,\\" referring to the actors' accents which were clearly inaccurate for the film's time and place. However, he went on, \\"it is amiable make-believe, rich in the outlandish pageantry Hollywood loves to manufacture, facilely narrated and enjoyably played.\\" Variety called the film \\"a spectacular melodrama\\" and \\"an excellent vehicle for Cooper\\" and inaccurately predicted that it would be a box office hit. Film Daily called the film a \\"thrilling, romantic offering\\" and called Cooper an \\"excellent\\" choice for the role. Harrison's Reports found \\"Expert performances\\" and a romance \\"handled in good taste,\\" but found that its appeal would be limited to \\"sophisticated audiences\\" because it was lacking in action. John Mosher of The New Yorker called the film \\"a big disappointment\\" and described the dialogue as having \\"the swing of a bad libretto.\\" Motion Picture Daily praised the \\"lavish\\" production but said the title role would have been much better suited to Rudolph Valentino than Gary Cooper. The New York Sun wrote, \\"In spite of its elaborate settings and the presence of Gary Cooper, The Adventures of Marco Polo never quite lives up to its promises.\\" In Italy, the fascist censors considered the film disrespectful to the eponymous hero and insisted on re-dubbing it to make the protagonist a Scotsman called MacBone Pan and releasing it under the title Uno scozzese alla corte del Gran Kan (A Scotsman at the Great Khan's court). The film was a box office flop, losing an estimated $700,000.

It was the first puzzle game for the Nintendo Gamecube. It was also released for Sony PlayStation 2 in 2006 in Europe by Midas Interactive Entertainment. Gameplay In ZooCube, players score points by matching animal heads that fall towards the faces of a rotatable cube. The player also needs to make matches quickly so that heads don't build up too much on the cube which can cause the player to lose, in a similar fashion to Tetris. Along the way, the player can acquire power-ups which can help the player in various way or hinder an opponent in multiplayer mode. Plot A mad scientist named Dr. Buc Ooze has been conducting \\"controversial research into animal shaping\\" and has left many animals misshapen or in otherwise unnatural forms. In response, a machine called the \\"ZooCube\\" is created which reverses the effects Dr. Ooze's experiments. The player, named \\"Aon\\", is tasked with rescuing all the trapped animals, traveling aboard a \\"flying ark\\" and armed with the \\"ZooCube\\". Development According to Nalin Sharma, the designer of ZooCube and CEO of PuzzleKings, he came up with the idea for ZooCube around 1996, while working for PA Consulting Group as a principal consultant. He was imagining how, \\"some thing or someone could survive if they were bombarded by lots of objects\\", which inspired some rough sketches that featured a cube as a central object. Nalin thought the idea had potential and soon began development of a game based on his sketches, entitled \\"Cubic Jiggler\\". Development started off poorly, because while Nalin had experience with C++, he lacked sufficient knowledge of 3D game development. He also had no 3D graphics card, which were relatively new at the time. However, despite these setbacks, the game was eventually completed after 3 years in development, with the help of the Direct3D graphics API, as well as a 3D graphics chip lent to him by 3dfx.

He picked up 18 disposals in his first game, as well as 6 marks and a goal. He then went on after a few more solid performances to play the rest of the season. He averaged 8 disposals a game for the season, as well as an aggregate of 5 goals. For the next couple of seasons, McGregor struggled to find his spot in the Adelaide team. He played 14 games in 2000, averaging 10 disposals. But, he was inaccurate, kicking 9 goals, 15 behinds. In the 2001 season, McGregor found his way into the Crow's backline, played 12 games. He had lower stats then his last season, averaging just 9 disposals, and kicking 3 goals for the season. 2002‚Äì2003 seasons McGregor did not play the first 5 games of the season, but came back for the Crows sixth against Richmond. He still came into the match with an injury, and failed to pick up any touches. When he returned, he played mainly down back, but sometimes when a match-up wasn't there for him, he drifted forward as another big forward. He averaged 12 disposals for the season, kicking 5 goals, including 2 in a semi-final against Melbourne. In 2003, McGregor found himself changing roles between back and forward again. He missed out on just two games for the season, including their first final. In all, he played 22 games for the year, having 12 disposals and 4 marks a game. He also kicked 6 goals for the year. 2004‚Äì2005 seasons When Neil Craig took over as coach of the Adelaide Football Club, McGregor has started to play some of his best footy. He only missed out on the last 3 games of the 2004 season due to injury. During 2004 he was described by Brisbane Lions star forward and enforcer Jonathan Brown as the toughest opponent he'd ever had to play on. He was pushed forward earlier in the year by Gary Ayers, proving his prowess by kicking 5 goals in a game against Richmond. He averaged 13 disposals a match, and kicked 12 goals. He continued his good form into the next year, missing out on just one game of the year. He played his first seven games down back, before Neil Craig shifted him into the underscoring forward line. It proved to be a great move by the new coach, as McGregor went on to kick 31 goals for the season. During the 2005 preliminary final against the West Coast Eagles. McGregor was the victim of an elbow from Travis Gaspar, just before the bouncedown. This resulted in a 50-metre penalty and Adelaide kicking the first goal. Gasper was charged with striking, but found not guilty due to it being deemed an act of self-defence. 2006‚Äì2008 seasons 2006 was a solid year for McGregor. He played in 19 games for the year, kicking 21 goals. McGregor only played nine games in 2007, leading him to request to be traded to another club at the end of the season. He was retained on the list, and continued to play in 2008.

It was written by Casey Robinson and Sig Herzig from a story by Wallace Sullivan. This was the fourth of nine films that Errol Flynn and Olivia de Havilland appeared in. Plot Reporter Jean Christy (Rosalind Russell) works for a newspaper in danger of being thrown away by its young owner, Pat Buckley (Patric Knowles), after Buckley has a falling-out with the editor-in-chief, Robert Lansford (Errol Flynn). Meanwhile, Lansford hopes to gain tycoon John Dillingwell's (Walter Connolly) business for his public relations firm, and uses his position at Buckley's paper to drum up good press for Dillingwell. In the process, he discovers that Dillingwell's granddaughter Lorri (Olivia de Havilland) is Buckley's fianc√©e. Lansford decides to try to charm Lorri, while Christy makes a play for Buckley.

William Dieterle was originally slated to direct the film,\\"Notes\\" on TCM.com and Edmund Goulding turned it down, before the studio assigned it to Michael Curtiz. Although principal photography went 12 days over the allotted time, Curtiz still managed to bring it in $12,000 under budget. At the very end of the film, Flynn and De Havilland, normally the happy couple at the end of any film they're in together, start to kiss passionately, only to hear protests from Russell and Knowles, with whose characters they are now involved with. The couples switch places, with De Havilland ruefully saying \\"Bye, Errol.\\" Release With the success of The Adventures of Robin Hood, Errol Flynn was concerned about being typecast as a swashbuckler, and convinced Warner Bros. to cast him in other types of films, specifically screwball comedies.

It is unrelated to Taiwanese Sign Language and is known in the Republic of China as W√©nf«é Sh«íuy«î ().  History  The first deaf school in China, Chefoo School for the Deaf, was established in 1887 by the Presbyterian missionary Annetta Thompson Mills. She developed what would become known as Chinese Sign Language, based on an oralist approach to deaf education, coming out of the Milan Conference of 1880. Another school for the deaf was established in Shanghai in 1897 by a French Catholic organization. Chinese Sign Language has grown out of these two bases. Schools, workshops and farms for the deaf in diverse locations are the main ways that CSL has been able to spread in China so well. Other Deaf who are not connected to these gathering places tend to use sets of gestures developed in their own homes, known as home sign. The Chinese National Association of the Deaf was created by deaf people mostly from the United States. The main reason for the creation of the organization was to raise the quality of living for the deaf, which was behind the quality of living standards provided for other disabled persons. Their main goals are to improve the welfare of the deaf, encourage education about the deaf and Chinese Sign Language, and promote the needs of the deaf community in China.  Classification  Chinese Sign Language is a language isolate. There are two main dialects: Southern CSL (centered on Shanghai and influenced by French Sign Language) and Northern CSL (coming out of the Chefoo School of Deaf and influenced by American Sign Language). Northern CSL has the greater influence from Chinese, with for example character puns. Hong Kong Sign Language derives from the southern dialect, but by now is a separate language. The Shanghai dialect is found in Malaysia and Taiwan, but Chinese Sign Language is unrelated to Taiwanese Sign Language (which is part of the Japanese family), Malaysian Sign Language (of the French family), or to Tibetan Sign Language (isolate). CSL shares morphology for forming negative clauses with British Sign Language; it may be that this is due to historical contact with the British in Shanghai. A feature of both CSL and British Sign Language is the use in many related signs of the thumb for a positive meaning and of the pinkie for a negative meaning, such as .  Structure  Like most other sign languages, Chinese Sign Language is mostly conveyed through shapes and motions joined with facial expressions. CSL has at its disposal an alphabetic spelling system similar to pinyin. The Chinese culture and language heavily influence signs in CSL. For example, there is no generic word for brother in CSL, only two distinct signs, one for \\"older brother\\" and one for \\"younger brother\\". This parallels Chinese, which also specifies \\"older brother\\" or \\"younger brother\\" rather than simply \\"brother\\". Similarly, the sign for \\"eat\\" incorporates a pictorial representation for chopsticks instead of using the hand as in ASL.

The Toxic Twins is a nickname given to lead singer Steven Tyler and lead guitarist Joe Perry of American hard rock band Aerosmith. They were given that name in the 1970s, due to their rampant use of drugs both on and off stage, which was a \\"toxic\\" combination that almost ended their careers and their lives. To this day, they are still commonly referred to by this nickname, despite going clean and maintaining sobriety for most of the past 30 years. Their camaraderie can be viewed in several of the band's videos, such as The Making of Pump, Big Ones You Can Look At, and You Gotta Move. An accomplished songwriting duo, the Toxic Twins are often referred to as the \\"Tyler/Perry\\" partnership in songwriting and have written over 85 songs together. In 2013, Tyler and Perry were recipients of the ASCAP Founders Award and were inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. Collaborations Musical Often, the Toxic Twins will appear for special performances, appearances, and collaborations, without the other members of Aerosmith. Notable times when this has happened, include: *A 1981 Cheap Trick concert at Boston Garden where Tyler and Perry performed with Cheap Trick. *A 1986 collaboration with Run D.M.C. for a remake of the Aerosmith song \\"Walk This Way\\", which pushed hip hop music into the mainstream, and jumpstarted Aerosmith's career again. *The recording of the remake of the song and filming of the video for \\"Wild Thing\\" with other rock stars and comedian Sam Kinison in 1988. *An appearance at a Bon Jovi concert in 1989 in Milton Keynes, where Tyler and Perry joined Bon Jovi for a performance of \\"Walk This Way\\". *An appearance at a Guns N' Roses concert in 1992 in Paris where Tyler and Perry performed \\"Mama Kin\\" and \\"Train Kept A-Rollin'\\" with Guns N' Roses. *A 1995 performance with Led Zeppelin at their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. *An appearance at a Stone Temple Pilots concert in 1996 in New York where Tyler and Perry performed \\"Sweet Emotion\\". *A 1997 commercial for Gap. *A tribute to Bob Marley, \\"Roots, Rock, Reggae\\", from the album Chant Down Babylon. *An appearance at the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards in which Tyler and Perry performed with Kid Rock and Run D.M.C. for a collaboration of \\"Walk This Way\\". *A collaboration with Mob Story on \\"Breaking These Chains\\" on the album A Hip Hopera *A 2002 collaboration in which Tyler and Perry guested on Eminem's \\"Sing for the Moment\\" which sampled Aerosmith's \\"Dream On\\". (Perry recorded a new solo jam) *A February 2003 performance at Radio City Music Hall in New York City where Tyler and Perry played Slim Harpo's 1957 hit \\"I'm a King Bee\\". This performance was captured on Antoine Fuqua's documentary Lightning in a Bottle, where Tyler and Perry were among dozens of musicians who paid tribute to American blues legends of the 20th century. *\\"Let's Get Loud\\" for the 2003 ESPY Awards with Chuck D, Busta Rhymes, Phife Dawg & Mc Lyte *A rendition of \\"Wild Thing\\" for a 2004 rugby advertising. *A 2006 performance with the Boston Pops Orchestra of the band's hits \\"Dream On\\", \\"I Don't Want to Miss a Thing\\" and \\"Walk This Way\\" for the orchestra's annual Fourth of July celebration in Boston, Massachusetts. *A 2012 performance of their 1978 hit \\"Chip Away the Stone\\" with Randy Jackson and members of the house band on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. *A live episode of American Idol in 2012, where Perry surprised Tyler with a guitar rendition of \\"Happy Birthday\\" for Tyler's 64th birthday. *A collaboration with Buddy Guy and Brad Whitford on \\"Evil Twin\\" in the album Rhythm & Blues of 2013. *A rerecord of \\"Dream On\\" with the Southern California Children's Chorus as a tribute to victims of the attack in Boston (2014) Additionally, Tyler and Perry are part of the \\"Boneyard Boys\\", a loose collective of musicians which was formed in the late 1990s to include Tyler and Perry and friends Marti Frederiksen and Mark Hudson who, among others, helped spearhead the songwriting, production, and much of the creative process in Aerosmith. Their rerecording of \\"Back in the Saddle\\" appear legally but without their permission in the film Shanghai Noon. Business The two used to co-own a restaurant in Norwell, Massachusetts called Mount Blue, of which they have since sold their shares. Personal life *In the mid-1990s, between the albums Get a Grip and Nine Lives, Tyler and Perry and their families vacationed together in Florida. *The Toxic Twins were also notably featured in Ted Nugent's book God, Guns, and Rock 'n' Roll, in which Nugent praises the duo for coming clean and talks about how they came to his ranch in the 1990s to shoot firearms and spend time with him and his family. Songwriting partnership Tyler and Perry are a notable songwriting duo, and have an impressive collection of songs they have written together. Among these are: *\\"Movin' Out\\" (1973) *\\"Same Old Song and Dance\\" (1974) *\\"Toys in the Attic\\" (1975) *\\"Walk This Way\\" (1975) *\\"No More No More\\" (1975) *\\"Back in the Saddle\\" (1976) *\\"Rats in the Cellar\\" (1976) *\\"Get the Lead Out\\" (1976) *\\"Lick and a Promise\\" (1976) *\\"Draw the Line\\" (1977) *\\"I Wanna Know Why\\" (1977) *\\"Get It Up\\" (1977) *\\"Sight for Sore Eyes\\" (with Jack Douglas and David Johansen) (1977) *\\"No Surprize\\" (1979) *\\"Chiquita\\" (1979) *\\"Cheese Cake\\" (1979) *\\"Three Mile Smile\\" (1979) *\\"Bone to Bone (Coney Island Whitefish Boy)\\" (1979) *\\"My Fist Your Face\\" (1985) *\\"Gypsy Boots\\" (1985) *\\"She's on Fire\\" (1985) *\\"The Hop\\" (with Tom Hamilton, Joey Kramer, and Brad Whitford) (1985) *\\"Magic Touch\\" (with Jim Vallance) (1987) *\\"Rag Doll\\" (with Vallance and Holly Knight) (1987) *\\"Simoriah\\" (with Vallance) (1987) *\\"Dude (Looks Like a Lady)\\" (with Desmond Child) (1987) *\\"Hangman Jury\\" (with Vallance) (1987) *\\"Girl Keeps Coming Apart\\" (1987) *\\"The Movie\\" (with Hamilton, Kramer and Whitford) (1987) *\\"Young Lust\\" (1989) *\\"F.I.N.E.*\\" (1989) *\\"Love in an Elevator\\" (1989) *\\"Monkey on My Back\\" (1989) *\\"My Girl\\" (1989) *\\"Don't Get Mad Get Even\\" (1989) *\\"Hoodoo/Voodoo Medicine Man\\" (with Whitford) (1989) *\\"What It Takes\\" (with Child) (1989) *\\"Ain't Enough\\" (1989) *\\"Intro\\" (with Vallance) (1993) *\\"Eat the Rich\\" (with Vallance) (1993) *\\"Get a Grip\\" (with Vallance) (1993) *\\"Fever\\" (1993) *\\"Livin' on the Edge\\" (with Mark Hudson) (1993) *\\"Flesh\\" (with Child) (1993) *\\"Shut Up and Dance\\" (with Jack Blades and Tommy Shaw) (1993) *\\"Cryin'\\" (with Taylor Rhodes) (1993) *\\"Gotta Love It\\" (with Hudson) (1993) *\\"Crazy\\" (with Child) (1993) *\\"Line Up\\" (with Lenny Kravitz) (1993) *\\"Boogie Man\\" (with Vallance) (1993) *\\"Don't Stop\\" (with Vallance) (1993) *\\"Can't Stop Messin'\\" (with Blades and Shaw) (1993) *\\"Head First\\" (with Vallance) (1993) *\\"Walk on Water\\" (with Blades and Shaw) (1994) *\\"Blind Man\\" (with Rhodes) (1994) *\\"Nine Lives\\" (with Marti Frederiksen) (1997) *\\"Falling in Love (Is Hard on the Knees)\\" (with Glen Ballard) (1997) *\\"Hole in My Soul\\" (with Child) (1997) *\\"Taste of India\\" (with Ballard) (1997) *\\"Something's Gotta Give\\" (with Frederiksen) (1997) *\\"Ain't That a Bitch\\" (with Child) (1997) *\\"The Farm\\" (with Hudson and Steve Dudas) (1997) *\\"Crash\\" (with Hudson and Dominik Miller) (1997) *\\"Attitude Adjustment\\" (with Frederiksen) (1997) *\\"Fallen Angels\\" (with Richard Supa) (1997) *\\"What Kind of Love Are You On\\" (with Blades and Shaw) (1998) *\\"Angel's Eye\\" (with Frederiksen and Rhodes) (2000) *\\"Beyond Beautiful\\" (with Frederiksen and Hudson) (2001) *\\"Trip Hoppin'\\" (with Frederiksen and Hudson) (2001) *\\"Sunshine\\" (with Frederiksen) (2001) *\\"Under My Skin\\" (with Frederiksen and Hudson) (2001) *\\"Luv Lies\\" (with Frederiksen and Hudson) (2001) *\\"Outta Your Head\\" (with Frederiksen) (2001) *\\"Drop Dead Gorgeous\\" (with Hudson) (2001) *\\"Light Inside\\" (with Frederiksen) (2001) *\\"Avant Garden\\" (with Frederiksen and Hudson) (2001) *\\"Girls of Summer\\" (with Frederiksen) (2002) *\\"Lay it Down\\" (with Frederiksen and DeGrate) (2002) *\\"The Grind\\" (with Frederiksen) (2004) *\\"Devil's Got a New Disguise\\" (with Diane Warren) (2006) *\\"Sedona Sunrise\\" (with Vallance) (2006) *\\"LUV XXX\\" (2012) *\\"Out Go The Lights\\" (2012) *\\"Legendary Child\\" (with Vallance) (2012) *\\"Street Jesus\\" (with Whitford) (2012) *\\"Lover Alot\\" (with Frederiksen, Hamilton, Whitford, Kramer, Jesse Kramer and Marco Moir) (2012) *\\"Another Last Goodbye\\" (with Child) (2012) Similar musical duos The name \\"Toxic Twins\\" may have been inspired by one of the duo's main influences, the \\"Glimmer Twins\\", the nickname for Mick Jagger and Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones. Additionally, it may have inspired other musical nicknames, like the \\"Terror Twins\\" - Def Leppard's Phil Collen and Steve Clark; and \\"The Muddy Twins\\" - Hanoi Rocks' Michael Monroe and Andy McCoy as well as the \\"Liverpool Twins\\" John Lennon and Paul McCartney, and the \\"Jersey Twins\\" Jon Bon Jovi and Richie Sambora. M√∂tley Cr√ºe's Nikki Sixx and Tommy Lee were also known as the Terror Twins. Tributes * An achievement in the Xbox 360 version of the game Guitar Hero II is titled the \\"Joe and Steven Award\\" in tribute to the Toxic Twins. It is awarded to two players who can get a 500-note streak in cooperative mode. * In 9: The Last Resort, Tyler and Perry voice a pair of antagonists known as the Toxic Twins.

Johnson finally won the coveted US Gran Prix of Cyclocross overall title in 2008, wearing the Cyclocross National Champion jersey, winning three of the series' six races. Johnson missed time late in the season due to a knee injury, but still managed to finish second in the North American Cyclocross Trophy overall standings, despite missing two of the series' eight races. In 2007, Johnson captured his second U.S. national cyclocross championship repeating his 2000 success. Video production company DH Productions produced a documentary about Johnson's 2007-2008 season, following his success from early season success through his National Championships victory and his subsequent trip to the UCI World Championships in Treviso, Italy. The film was titled the 9 Ball Diaries, paying homage to the design of Johnson's Cannondale/Leer/Cyclocrossworld.com team jersey and Cannondale's Cyclocross bicycle. In 2006, Johnson finished the season without landing outside the top-4 in any Cyclocross race entered. As a co-captain of the Health Net Professional Cycling Team he helped the team achieve its 3rd consecutive #1 NRC Ranking.

It is commonly referred to as the daring jumping spider, or bold jumping spider. The spider belongs to the genus Phidippus, a group of jumping spiders easily identified both by their relatively large size and their iridescent chelicerae. Like other jumping spiders, due to their large, forward-facing eyes, they have very good stereoscopic vision. This aids them when stalking prey, and facilitates visual communication with others of their species, as in their courting dances. Description Phidippus audax varies widely in size and coloration. Adult males range from 4‚Äì15 millimeters in body length, with an average of 8 mm. Adult females range from 4‚Äì18 millimeters in body length, with an average of 11 mm. They are typically black with a pattern of spots and stripes on their abdomen and legs. Often these spots are orange-tinted in juveniles, turning white as the spider matures. However, in some parts of Florida it is common for adults to have yellow, orange, or red spots. The chelicerae (mouthparts) are a bright, metallic green or blue. Habitat Iridescent chelicerae on an adult male P. audax Like most jumping spiders, P. audax tends to prefer relatively open areas to hunt in, as they actively seek and stalk prey and do not build webs to catch food. They do use webbing, however, only when laying eggs or to hide. They also use spider silk as a 'lifeline' when jumping for prey or evading predators. They are common in fields and grasslands, and are frequently seen on fences, exterior walls, and gardens as well. Many jumping spiders seem to prefer flat vertical surfaces, likely because it enables them to spot and chase down roaming insects with ease. Distribution This species is common in southern Canada, throughout the United States and parts of northern Mexico, plus Cuba, and has been introduced to Hawaii and the Nicobar Islands. Name P. audax is the type species for the genus Phidippus. The species name is derived from the Latin word audax meaning \\"daring, audacious\\". Bites Like most spiders, P. audax rarely bites humans. While symptoms of a bite may vary, the most likely symptoms are pain, itching, swelling and redness with a duration of 1 to 2 days.

He wrote the score to Walter Ruttmann's Berlin: Symphony of a Metropolis (1927), The Battleship Potemkin (1925), and other films of Sergei Eisenstein.Ian Christie, Richard Taylor (1993). , page 66. Routledge. . Meisel was one of the more important and pioneering figures in film music. Much of his work and the evidence of his significance was lost for more than fifty years.  Biography  Meisel was born in Vienna to Abraham and Jeni n√©e Herzbrunn. His family was Jewish.Index of the Jewish Records of Vienna and Lower Austria, birth record 2025 for 1894 He began composing incidental music for the stage in the 1920s. Early credits included the scoring of plays by Bertolt Brecht.Bruce Eder, Edmund Meisel biography Retrieved June 21, 2010 His acquaintance with Erwin Piscator led to him writing music for films soon after. Meisel quickly came to be considered a talented composer, capable of working in a different styles, encompassing expressionism and jazz, as well as traditional orchestral modes. Writing during the turbulent years of the Weimar Republic, Meisel demonstrated a wry sense of humor, particularly regarding patriotic songs. In 1925, Meisel came to prominence with a new score for Sergei Eisenstein's Potemkin, helping to turn the movie into a major hit from the modest success it had had in Russia. The opportunity arose when the German distributor decided to capitalize on the unexpected success the movie achieved in Berlin by improving the score. Meisel's music established an approach to scoring movies that came to dominate filmmaking, especially in Hollywood. Writing in just 12 days' time, his score more closely paralleled the movie, shot-by-shot and scene-by-scene, in a way that was novel for the time. Meisel's only guidance from Eisenstein was with the final reel, where Meisel was asked to rely on rhythm as the dominant element. Eisenstein was apparently pleased with Meisel's score, hiring him later for October in 1927. Meisel wrote full scores for Arnold Fanck's The Holy Mountain in 1926 and in 1927, was the composer on Berlin: Symphony of a Great City, writing a score to be played by an orchestra of 75 musicians. Meisel was so influential, he was sometimes credited simply with his last name. Meisel also wrote articles on film composition and the performance of his scores, a helpful resource for scholars. Although his name was known, Meisel's score to Potemkin was lost, and wasn't reconstructed until the 1990s, leading to renewed interest in his music. Meisel died in Berlin in 1930, at the age of 36. His widow Else went on to marry Ludwig Blattner.letter from Jay Leyda, 17 December 1968, University of Minnesota Libraries, Arthur Kleiner Collection, retrieved 02 March 2017 Meisel's niece was the writer and member of the German Resistance, Hilde Meisel.

He served as a councillor and city controller in North York, and was also a member of the Metropolitan Toronto council. His political career ended with a criminal conviction in 1994. Early life and career Gentile was born in Apulia, in the south east of Italy, and moved to Canada as a young adult. After his arrival there he worked as a welder before moving into selling insurance, building up a strong network of clients in the Italian-Canadian community. He left the insurance business in 1979 to open a travel agency.Michael Best, \\"Olive tree life's turning point for North York controller\\", Toronto Star, 16 February 1988, N10. Municipal politician Gentile was elected to represent North York's second ward in 1976, following a failed bid in 1974. He was the first person of Italian-Canadian background to serve on the North York council. He also received an appointment to the Metro Toronto council in 1980, after an unsuccessful attempt in 1978.\\"North York elects four to Metro seats\\", Globe and Mail, 5 December 1978, P4; Alden Baker, \\"New faces on Metro Council elected by civic politicians\\", Globe and Mail, 2 December 1980, P5. He remained a ward councillor in North York until early 1988, when he was appointed to replace the late Esther Shiner on the city's Board of Control. He had also re-appointed to Metro Council in 1982 and 1985. Gentile sought election to the Metro Board of Police Commissioners in December 1984, but lost to Art Eggleton.\\"Election to CNE group called farce\\", Globe and Mail, 5 December 1984, M6. He later served as chairman of the Metro works committee.Alden Baker, \\"Eggleton retains seat on police board\\", Globe and Mail, 11 December 1985, A18. Gentile was affiliated with the Liberal Party and the Progressive Conservative Party at different times in his career. He announced his intention to seek the Progressive Conservative nomination in Downsview for the 1985 provincial election, but withdrew before nomination day.Dyanne Rivers, \\"Councillors in elections should quit: alderman\\", Globe and Mail, 4 October 1984, M3; Victoria Stevens, \\"2 elections make politics a juggling act\\", Toronto Star, 11 October 1988, N1. Gentile was generally on the right-wing of council. He was one of only three North York councillors to oppose a resolution which called for a boycott of South Africa for its apartheid policies in 1986, arguing that the measure was beyond the scope of a municipal council.Mike Foster, \\"It's about time equal opportunity came knocking\\", Toronto Star, 22 July 1986, N4. He later opposed efforts to make municipal titles gender-neutral, and said that he still wanted to be recognized as an \\"alderman\\" when his title was formally changed to \\"councillor\\".David Lewis Stein, \\"North York follies\\", Toronto Star, 25 March 1987, A27. He was a vocal critic of Sunday shopping extensions in 1988.Michael Best and Royson James, \\"Lastman curbs his promotion of Sunday sales\\", Toronto Star, 23 January 1988, A6. Like Esther Shiner, whom he replaced on the Board of Control, Gentile supported extending the Spadina Expressway into downtown Toronto.Gail Swainson, \\"Voters anxious to preserve their neighborhoods\\", Toronto Star, 31 October 1988, A7. Gentile indicated in 1988 that he wanted to run for Mayor of North York at some point in the future, but would wait for incumbent mayor Mel Lastman to retire. He was an ally of Lastman on council, and once described him as \\"unbeatable\\".Michael Best, \\"Olive tree life's turning point for North York controller\\", Toronto Star, 16 February 1988, N10; Michael Best, \\"Lastman will seek eighth term safeguard North York vision\\", 17 May 1988, N9. Toronto's political system was restructured in 1988, as the regional Boards of Control were eliminated and the direct election of Metro councillors introduced. Gentile won an easy victory over Angelo Natale to represent North York's Humber ward on Metro, and was re-elected without opposition in 1991. He sought an appointment to the Metro Executive in 1988, but was unsuccessful.David Lewis Stein, \\"New Metro chairman's bubble has burst\\", Toronto Star, 16 December 1988, A25. In January 1989, Gentile was appointed as chair of the board of governors for Exhibition Place.\\"Car rental executives face charges in card scam\\", Toronto Star, 27 January 1989, A6. In April 1991, he recommended that the city work with the private firm Metrex Centre Inc. to create an international trade centre on the Exhibition grounds.\\"MAJOR TRADE CENTRE COMPLEX PLANNED FOR EXHIBITION PLACE WILL BOOST METRO AND AREA ECONOMY\\" [official news release], Canada News-Wire, 15 April 1991, 14:09 report. Gentile criticized certain Ontario municipalities for declaring themselves officially unilingual in 1990, and brought forward a successful motion which re-confirmed Metro's support for official bilingualism in Canada. He described the trend toward English-only municipalities as \\"bigotry\\" targeted at minority language groups.Robert MacLeod, \\"Metro Council reaffirms recognition of bilingualism\\", Globe and Mail, 16 February 1990, A11. In 1989, he was the victim of a break-in where a burglar took $10,000 in cash and $50,000 worth of property from his house.Timothy Appleby, \\"Councillor baffled by break-in\\", Globe and Mail, 11 January 1989, A12. In early 1992, Gentile argued that fellow councillor Norman Gardner should not be charged after shooting a would-be robber his family-owned bakery. He argued that Gardner, a friend of several years, would not use a firearm carelessly.Cal Millar and Michael Tenszen, \\"Shot fired in defence, Gardner says\\", Toronto Star, 15 March 1992, A10; Andrew Duffy, \\"Commissioner at forefront of gun debate\\", Toronto Star, 15 March 1992, A10. He continued to oppose employment equity policies in 1993.Bob Brent, \\"Metro sets job equity targets amid cuts\\", Toronto Star, 27 May 1993, A6. Arrest and conviction Criminal charges were laid against Gentile in late 1991, following his acclamation to city council but before the actual election. He was charged with five counts of municipal corruption, two charges of breach of trust, and five counts of accepting a secret commission. Gentile spoke to the media on the day the charges were laid, and said that he looked forward to a full exoneration. He was quoted as saying, \\"My conscience is clear ... My hand was not shaking when I signed the arrest papers with the police\\".Kevin Donovan, [front page article], Toronto Star, A1, 31 October 1991; Jock Ferguson, \\"Municipal politicians, developer charged\\", Globe and Mail, 1 November 1991, A1. Following an expansion of the criminal probe in 1992, he was charged with an additional one count of breach of trust, five counts of municipal corruption and five counts of accepting payoffs.\\"71 corruption charges laid\\", Globe and Mail, 28 May 1992, A15. He again denied the charges. Gentile continued to serve on Metro council following the charges. Nine of the charges against Gentile were dismissed in March 1993.\\"Undercover drug officer attacked\\", Toronto Star, 2 March 1993, A20. In May of the same year, a judge ruled that he would stand trial for two counts of breach of trust and nine counts of receiving secret commissions.\\"Politician's trial ordered\\", Globe and Mail, 7 May 1993, A18. During the resulting trial, it was revealed that Gentile had accepted several gifts from jailed developer Lou Charles over a period of several years. Charles denied that there was anything improper about the gifts, and said that he considered Gentile to be like \\"a son\\".Gail Swainson, \\"Gentile given cash, gifts, court hears\\", Toronto Star, 17 May 1994, A2. The gifts were said to include \\"a cellular phone, $42,000 in meals at Celestino's, $7,500 in custom- made clothing, unrestricted use of two credit cards, $22,000 in appliances and $92,000 cash\\". See Gail Swainson, \\"Greed, graft alleged at councillor's trial\\", Toronto Star, 21 May 1994, A6. Gentile acknowledged receiving the gifts, but said Charles was neither promised nor received preferential treatment in return.Donn Downey, \\"Gentile denies helping businessman\\", Globe and Mail, 3 June 1994, A6. In June 1994, Gentile was found guilty of one count of breach of trust and seven counts of receiving commissions. He continued to protest his innocence, although he later acknowledged that he had made errors in judgement in his relationship with Charles. After some hesitation, he announced his resignation from council on August 10, 1994.Rudy Platiel, \\"Gentile to appeal bribery conviction\\", Globe and Mail, 26 July 1994, A3; Dale Hawaleska, \\"Convicted Councillor Gentile resigns\\", Globe and Mail, 11 August 1994, A10; Jane Armstrong, \\"Gentile resigns from Metro council\\", Toronto Star, 11 August 1994, A6. In September, Gentile was sentenced to two years in prison and fined $92,000.Amber Narsulla, \\"Gentile should get 5 years, Crown argues\\", Globe and Mail, 20 September 1994, A8; Thomas Claridge, \\"Gentile jailed two years\\", Globe and Mail, 21 September 1994, A1. He was also found guilty of four offences under the Income Tax Act in November 1994, for failure to declare almost $200,000 in gifts from Charles.Gary Oakes, \\"Money no gift, Gentile tax trial told\\", Toronto Star, 14 September 1994, A10; Thomas Claridge, \\"Gentile found guilty of tax evasion\\", Globe and Mail, 17 November 1994, A12. He was fined $58,648.49. One day after this conviction, Gentile pleaded guilty to a further charge of breach-of-trust relating to a 1987 trip to Las Vegas paid for by a firm that had just received a contract for garbage disposal in North York.\\"Former councillor sentenced for accepting Las Vegas trip\\", Globe and Mail, 18 November 1994, E4. He was given day parole in May 1995.Gail Swainson, \\"Weeping ex-councillor granted day parole\\", Toronto Star, 19 May 1995, A2. Gentile considered running for municipal council again in 1997, but withdrew before the vote. He was presented with a ceremonial key to the city of North York by Mel Lastman in October 1997, just prior to the city's amalgamation into the new City of Toronto.John Barber, \\"Goodbye North York, hello megacity\\", Globe and Mail, 8 October 1997, A14. In February 2000, he announced that he would be a candidate for Toronto City Council's twelfth ward in the municipal election to be held later in the year. Mel Lastman described his decision as \\"unfortunate,\\" adding that Gentile was making a mockery of the election.Paul Moloney, \\"Gentile throws cap in ring\\", Toronto Star, 11 February 2000, p. 1. He finished third against Frank Di Giorgio.

The Senators won the series by three games to two in the best-of-five game series. Although all of the games for the series were scheduled to be played at The Arena in Ottawa, unseasonably warm weather and poor ice conditions forced the last two contests to be played on the artificial ice at Toronto's Arena Gardens. This would be the last Stanley Cup Final appearance for a team based on the West Coast of the United States until the 1993 Final. It is the last Finals appearance by a Seattle-based team to date. Paths to the Finals The Senators captured the 1919‚Äì20 NHL title after they won both halves of the regular season, thus eliminating the need for a league championship playoff. Meanwhile, Seattle finished the 1919‚Äì20 PCHA regular season in first place with a 12‚Äì10 record, but had to defeat the second place Vancouver Millionaires in a two-game total goals championship series, 7‚Äì3, to win the PCHA title. The location of the series was under dispute. As the 1919 series was not completed, the PCHA wanted the 1920 series to take place out west. The NHL opposed the idea. The PCHA proposed playing the series in Winnipeg, but this was still not agreed to by the NHL. While the dispute continued, the schedules for both leagues was allowed to drag out, leading to a late starting date for the Final. Game summaries Seattle's green, red, and white uniforms looked almost alike to Ottawa's black, red, and white uniforms. The Senators agreed to play in white sweaters. The rules alternated for each game, starting with eastern rules. The puck was dropped for the first game of the series by Stanley Cup trustee William Foran to the centers Frank Nighbor and Frank Foyston. The ice became soft and pools of water developed. Foyston scored two goals in the first period to put Seattle ahead 2‚Äì0. Nighbor scored on a shot that ricocheted off Morris of Seattle with 40 seconds to play in the second period. Nighbor tied it at the ten-minute mark of the third period. Jack Darragh scored the game-winning goal with four minutes to play on an assist from Eddie Gerard. Vancouver Mayor Robert Gale dropped the puck to start game two, played under seven-man PCHA rules. Goaltender Clint Benedict led the Senators to a 3‚Äì0 shutout win. Ice conditions were again wet. Darragh scored at the 14-minute mark of the first period. In the third, Gerard stick-handled in and scored after six minutes. Nighbor finished the scoring with his third goal of the series with one minute to play. Seattle won game three, 3‚Äì1, in a game notable for having no penalties called. Seattle outplayed Ottawa but the score was kept close by Benedict. The first goal was scored at five minutes of the first, by George Boucher to put Ottawa ahead 1‚Äì0. Riley of Seattle scored to tie the game with two minutes to play in the first. Seattle took the lead on a goal by Foyston, after a steal by Walker from Darragh. The final goal was scored by Rickey on another set-up by Walker. By consensus of league and team officials, the series was shifted to Toronto because of Ottawa's slushy ice conditions (The Ottawa Arena did not have artificial ice).

History Spears had a long history of crime, having been arrested 17 times under 14 different aliases. He had become financially successful in Texas as a naturopath, even becoming the head of the Texas Naturopath Association in 1954. But in 1957 he was expelled from the organization in a bribery scandal. He moved to California and took up hypnotism, his business was with a doctor performing abortions (which were then illegal in the U.S.). He was charged with three felony accounts and was set to stand trial in Los Angeles on December 3, 1959. Investigators learned that William Taylor, a fellow felon and longtime criminal accomplice of Spears, had boarded Flight 967 using a ticket made out to \\"Dr. Spears.\\" The theory arose that Spears, desperate to avoid trial and wanting a fresh start, had tricked Taylor (perhaps through hypnosis) into boarding the aircraft with a piece of luggage containing a bomb; when the aircraft crashed, it would be assumed that Spears was on board. His wife (who had just given birth to twins) would then cash in an insurance policy for $100,000 on Spears' life. However, Taylor himself purchased $37,500.00 worth of life insurance at the airport; when his ex-wife attempted to collect on that policy, authorities were notified. It was determined that Taylor had boarded the flight using a ticket issued for Spears. Spears was eventually arrested in Phoenix after being turned in by a fellow naturopath in Arizona. Due to lack of evidence, however, Spears was never charged with any offense in relation to the Flight 967 crash. Spears died in Dallas, Texas on 2 May 1969 of coronary thrombosis.

The Japanese release has only hiragana („Åå„Çì„Å™„Å£„Åè) and katakana („Ç¨„É≥„Éä„ÉÉ„ÇØ) forms, aside from the logo. is a 1990 scrolling shooter video game developed by Compile and published by Tonkin House for the Nintendo Entertainment System. The game was released in Japan on October 5, 1990 and in North America in September 1991.  Gameplay  The player assumes the role of commander Gun-Nac, and throughout eight different levels, fights a host of enemies from a space ship. The ship can be upgraded to a larger ship by acquiring a \\"wing\\", which allows the player to sustain two enemy hits rather than one, and allows the player to upgrade his weapons further than the standard ship would allow. The game contains five primary weapons, as well as four types of secondary bombs. Examples of primary weapons are a standard gun, a flamethrower and a type of guided boomerang. All weapons have unlimited ammunition, and they are obtained by collecting circles with numbers that correspond to one of the five different weapons. The primary weapons can be upgraded by collecting multiple \\"Power P's\\" that float throughout the stage. The secondary bombs work on a similar principle; they are obtained by collecting circles with corresponding letters in them. The bombs, however, are limited in supply to however many the player can collect. Both the weapons and bombs can be progressively upgraded throughout the game. When a player has acquired a particular type of weapon, he can upgrade weapon level by collecting several of the same circles in a row. Each time another matching circle is collected, the weapon is upgraded. This is limited to five upgrades. Using the same method, bombs can also be upgraded. When a bomb is upgraded, it becomes twice as powerful, but also consumes twice as much ammunition. Money can be found randomly floating through the levels, or being released by destroyed objects or enemies; it can be used to purchase upgrades in a shop in between levels.  Plot  In the distant future, the Earth's resources have been depleted, and many of earth's inhabitants are moving to the new, artificial solar system called IOTA Synthetica. The solar system, like all the solar systems created by the \\"Galactic Federation\\", is very hip and up-scale. This image ended abruptly though, as a mysterious wave of cosmic radiation swept through the solar system. This radiation caused ordinary inanimate objects to spring to life, and attack the solar system's residents. The Galactic Federation, realizing the situation was beyond their control, calls on Commander Gun-Nac, son of the Legendary Xan,This appears to be a subtle reference to the earlier Compile game Zanac. to save IOTA Synthetica from the ensuing destruction from this strange cosmic energy.  Development  The American release had a number of things removed or changed, such as the first phase of the last boss, the intro and the ending.  Reception  Allgame editor Skyler Miller praised Gun Nac, describing the game as \\"perhaps the best shooter for the NES\\". Famitsu awarded Gun Nac a score of 26/40.https://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&a;=page_h_title_review&title;_id=5039  References   External links  * Gun-Nac at MobyGames Category:1990 video games Category:Compile (company) games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Tonkin House games Category:ASCII games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System-only games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games scored by Toshiaki Sakoda ","title":"Gun-Nac"},{"id":"5820090","text":"Spectrum Sports (formerly known as Bright House Sports Network) was an American regional sports network serving the Tampa Bay and Orlando metropolitan areas of Florida, that was owned by cable television provider Charter Communications which exclusively carried the channel on Standard Definition channel 47 and High Definition channel 1147.Bright House Sports Network History Logo as Catch 47, used from 2004 to 2008.

The Network's carriage was expanded to Bright House's Central Florida systems. In 2012, the channel won sole rights to air all post season high school games. Bright House was acquired by Charter in May 2016, along with Time Warner Cable, and on November 15, 2016, Bright House Sports Network was renamed as Spectrum Sports, as Bright House on the same day became Spectrum.

The Toyota Sports Connection, a nightly show focusing on local professional and college teams, ran from 1997 to 2011. Bright House Sports Network also broadcast most home games and occasional road games of the Arena Football League's Tampa Bay Storm before the league folded in 2009. The announcing team for the Storm games generally consisted of Drew Fellios and former NFL punter Mark Royals. Programming on other channels On March 25, 2007, SportsNet New York (a similar regional sports network in the New York metropolitan area) rebroadcast then-Catch 47's coverage of a game between the Tampa Bay Storm and the New York Dragons from two days earlier.

Their sound mixes reggae, rocksteady, and ska music with American soul. They have been together since 1994, with numerous lineup changes over the years. The current incarnation has been mostly stable since 2003. The band hews to a more traditional ska-reggae sound while many others working in the genre morphed into a more punk variety. The band has shared the stage with performers such as the Skatalites, Toots & the Maytals, Desmond Dekker, The English Beat, Hepcat, Chuck Berry, The Slackers, Flogging Molly, The Toasters, Mustard Plug, Voodoo Glow Skulls, and The Mighty Mighty Bosstones. History Deal's Gone Bad formed in 1994 and played locally in Chicago for several years, releasing their debut in 1996. They then signed to Jump Up! Records and released Large and In Charge in 1998. This album featured cover art inspired by the Stanley Kubrick film A Clockwork Orange and was heavily influenced by 1960s reggae and ska musicians such as Prince Buster, The Skatalites and The Wailers; it prompted Allmusic to call them \\"one of the most intriguing bands on the scene.\\" The album also incorporated soul into many of its songs, an element which would remain an important part of their sound for many years. The follow-up, Overboard, followed in 1999, which featured more prominent organ parts due to the addition of keyboardist Julio Herrera. Both Large and In Charge and Overboard featured songs dealing with pirates as subject matter. An EP and a full-length arrived in 2003 from the group, followed in 2005 by a compilation disc, The Longest Happy Hour, which also included two previously unreleased songs. The group performed on the Vans Warped Tour in 2006. In 2007, Megalith Records released their next album, The Ramblers, by which time only Dave Simon and Mike Corcoran remained from the group's original incarnation. Shortly after the release of The Ramblers, the group toured with Voodoo Glow Skulls, The Toasters, and Mustard Plug on the Ska Is Dead tour in 2009.

He later served as an assistant coach for the Charlotte Bobcats, during head coach Larry Brown's tenure and for the New York Knicks during head coach Mike Woodson's tenure. Playing career  College  Nicknamed \\"Tank\\", Thompson finished his career at Texas as the school's all-time leader in rebounds with 1,027, despite the fact he played only three years. The record would stand for 21 years until it was broken by James Thomas in 2004.  Sacramento Kings  Thompson was drafted by the Kings with the fifth overall pick in the 1982 NBA draft, making him the highest Texas player taken until LaMarcus Aldridge was selected second overall in 2006. In 1989‚Äì1990, he averaged 13.9 points and 9.4 rebounds per game while spending a half-season in Sacramento and the other half in Indiana.  Indiana Pacers  A regular starter for most of the first part of his career, in 1992‚Äì1993 Thompson moved to a role as the tough-nosed veteran off the bench, as Rik Smits and Dale Davis started every game in which they played. Thompson was a key reserve on the first Pacers team to reach the Eastern Conference Finals series, in 1993‚Äì1994.  Philadelphia 76ers and Denver Nuggets  After the 1994‚Äì1995 season, Thompson signed with the Philadelphia 76ers, playing there for a year before going to the Denver Nuggets.  Return to the Pacers  He ended his career with nine more games in a Pacers uniform, following the trade-deadline deal that also brought Mark Jackson back to Indiana.http://www.nba.com/pacers/news/lasalle_thompson.html Post-NBA career Thompson served a stint as general manager and head coach of the San Diego Wildfire in the American Basketball Association in the 2000‚Äì01 season, which would be the only season of the Wildfire's existence. Currently, he is co-owner of Prime Time Motors, an automobile sales firm in California. On May 30, 2008, Thompson accepted an offer from Larry Brown (for whom he played during his stints with Indiana Pacers) and the Charlotte Bobcats to become an assistant coach where he worked until Larry Brown parted ways with the Bobcats after the team started the season 9-19 on December 22, 2010. Before the start of 2012‚Äì13 NBA season, Thompson became assistant coach of the New York Knicks under Mike Woodson (with whom he played for Kings in Kansas City and Sacramento) replacing Kenny Atkinson who quit joining the Atlanta Hawks staff. He worked for Knicks for 2 seasons until Woodson was fired on April 21, 2014. Has one son (Nickolas) who plays basketball at Jonesboro High School in Jonesboro, Arkansas, and one daughter (Ruby) who plays volleyball for Evanston Township High School in Evanston, Illinois, and club at Sports Performance Volleyball Club.

The first three seasons of the show originally aired on MOJO HD before moving to FLN for the fourth season. Repeats of the show briefly aired on The Travel Channel before being picked up by Spike. The title is taken from the popular expression, \\"three sheets to the wind,\\" referring to one who is staggering drunk. Comedian Zane Lamprey hosts a humorous trip around the world sampling the local well-known (and little- known) food and drink while also engaging in local alcohol-related customs.http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/TV/08/04/zane.lamprey/index.html In each episode Lamprey samples various food and drinks and learns about the customs and libations of that area, and then experiences the local hangover cure. The series is produced by Screaming Flea Productions.http://www.sfpseattle.com/work/three.asp Format Each episode begins with an overview of the places Zane will visit on his trip. Typically over the course of the episode Zane will introduce different local alcoholic beverages and spend some time with either a bartender or alcohol-maker to learn more about the drinks discussed. Often when a new term or item is introduced a note will appear on the screen to provide further information or help with pronunciation. A number of recurring segments and gags surface in almost every episode. A voice-over feature starring \\"The Professor\\" will occasionally appear to introduce an in-depth history or description of something culturally significant, a locale, or the science behind a particular drink. Zane also often refers to his drinking buddy, a stuffed monkey named Pleepleus, who appears at random points in the show. Recurring characters Throughout Zane's travels he meets a number of diverse and unique characters.http://www.zanelamprey.com/projects/three_sheets/ Zane Lamprey Official Website During the \\"NY Pub Crawl\\", several of these individuals returned to the show. These included: *Steve McKenna: A running gag on the show (see above), Zane's college friend Steve first made an actual appearance during the episode \\"Three Sheets to Kentucky\\". During the episode, Steve invented a drink (The Irish American) and ended the episode in typical Steve McKenna fashion. In the episode McKenna claimed to own Byrd's Country Store in Keeseville, NY. A Sunoco served as a background to his brief ad. It is assumed this Sunoco was his store. As of July, 2010 the store pictured in the episode, while still a Sunoco, is not owned by Mr. McKenna, having been sold some five+ months prior according to the current owner. *Logan \\"The Beer Hunter\\": Logan travels the world always in search of the greatest brews. His zeal for beer was first documented during \\"Three Sheets to Belgium\\", the pilot episode of the show, where he met Zane at the D√©lirium Caf√© in Brussels. He had a penchant for stealing Zane's beer. *Jim the Cop: Jim, a New York police officer, ran into Zane in Puerto Rico. He lost a beer chugging contest and returned to the States in shame. He 'contacted MOJO to demand a rematch' to take place in NYC. During the \\"NYC Pub Crawl\\", Zane and Jim had a rematch. While the results were considerably closer, he lost again, while spilling a good deal of beer on his shirt. Zane now makes reference to someone who has spilled beer on themselves during the course of chugging a drink as having \\"Jim the Cop'd\\". He made a guest appearance during the Las Vegas episode where he wins at celebrity poker, defeating pro player and fellow MOJOHD show host Phil Laak. Jim was a friend of Zane's before the show. *Pleepleus the Monkey: Pleepleus is a stuffed monkey and Zane's main travel companion so he does not have to drink alone at times. He's a stuffed monkey that is available on Zane's web site. He appeared in \\"Three Sheets\\" and now \\"Drinking Made Easy\\" on HDNet. When Zane was visiting Greece, prior to shooting \\"Three Sheets\\", his friend Steve McKenna asked what part of Greece he was going to. Knowing that Steve knew nothing about Greece, Zane told him that he was going to the island of Pleepleus, which was overrun with monkeys. Steve believed him. When Zane started shooting \\"Three Sheets\\", he tried to get the network to hire Steve as his sidekick. When they didn't, Zane hid the monkey in the show to taunt Steve, which turned into the drinking game. Zane still says that \\"Steve's job, co-hosting 'Drinking Made Easy', is so easy, a monkey could do it\\". The original costume was sold to Mad Horse Brewpub in Lovettsville, VA and can be seen there. *Ski Patrol: Ski Patrol is defined as someone a little too interested in free drinks and camera time, usually being fairly intoxicated. This can be anyone that Zane happens across in his adventures. The term refers to an un-aired segment in which a creepy guy who wouldn't leave Zane alone tried to get the crew to follow him to a mountain ski patrol where he supposedly worked. *Others: Often the crew will appear on camera, such as the show's field producer, Christina Kindwall; Eric, the sound guy; and Curtiss, the cameraman. Fellow MOJOHD show host Dave Hill (comedian) has featured on two episodes of Three Sheets in his outfit and persona for his television show The King of Miami. Drinking game rules The show also doubles as a drinking game, introduced in the Costa Rica episode. The rules are as follows: #When Zane drinks, you drink. #The first person to spot a monkey (including real monkeys or Pleepleus the monkey), makes someone else drink. (Pleepleus shirts count.) #When Zane mentions his friend, Steve McKenna, everyone drinks. #When Zane or anyone burps, the last person to give the \\"Good Burp\\" sign (thumb on your forehead, pinky in the air) drinks. #If someone in the show \\"Jim-The- Cops\\" (spills their beverage while drinking) it‚Äôs a social. However, if YOU Jim-The-Cop, you have to buy someone a drink. If you're watching at home, or a friend's house, it‚Äôs your turn to make a run to the fridge. If you Jim-The-Cop while in a chugging contest, you get three seconds added to your time. #If you ever spot Zane holding a drink improperly, you can make someone drink. #Whenever you see a puppy, you drink. Zane creates this rule in the Moscow episode. #Make sure you make someone drink when something's blurred out in the show, like Coke products. This rule, by Zane, was found on the Zane Lamprey message center (shopping list for the Cape Town episode).Zane Lamprey Official Website #Whenever you drink, drink with a smile. (Just like the lemon in Lithuania.) \\"Save Three Sheets\\" With the ending of the MOJO HD network on December 1, 2008, the future of Three Sheets was unclear.DPUC.state.us At the time, the third season had finished airing and the fourth season had been put into production with a majority of the shows completed; however, there was no network for the unaired fourth season shows. On December 9, 2008, Zane himself went to his fans to enlist their help in finding a new home for Three Sheets. He scheduled two rallies \\"to help save their favorite show from extinction\\".http://www.zanelamprey.com/projects/three_sheets/save_three_sheets_release.php After staging the fan rallies, Zane Lamprey and the new network officially announced in July 2009 that Three Sheets would begin airing on Fine Living Network on July 20, 2009.https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/arts/television/20sheets.html?_r=1 \\"Sheet It Forward\\" Movement A small movement started in December 2009 with the philosophy to make the world a better place one drink at a time. The essential rule for members of the movement is to purchase a drink for someone they don't know if he or she is seen wearing anything related to the show \\"Three Sheets\\". It is a way to share the love for the show, and spread good will between people who have never previously met.Facebook \\"Sheet it Forward\\" Movement Travel Channel On March 22, 2010, the Official Three Sheets Page on Facebook announced that Three Sheets would premiere on The Travel Channel and Travel Channel HD on April 14, 2010. It is stated as being \\"for one month only.\\"http://www.facebook.com/home.php?#!/video/video.php?v=402364211004&ref;=mf Three Sheets finished its trial run on May 5, 2010. On June 18, 2010, Lamprey announced on his website that the Travel Channel has decided to air all 52 episodes in order starting June 30, 2010 at 11:00 and 11:30 pm ET. On August 8, 2010, Lamprey announced on his website that the Travel Channel had dropped the show from its lineup.http://www.zanelamprey.com/2010/08/travel-channel- drops-three-sheets.html On November 27, 2010, at a show for Zane Lamprey's and Steve McKenna's \\"Sing The Booze\\" tour, Steve McKenna announced that Spike will begin to air Three Sheets on Wednesday nights at 10:30 pm. Drinking Made Easy Zane's follow-up incarnation, Drinking Made Easy, aired on the now- defunct HDNet. This newer show had a slightly different format than Three Sheets, and focused on cities within the United States. Drinking Made Easy ended in 2013 after HDNet transitioned into AXS TV.

It typically involves using purpose-built software to define a system of interconnected components, which are then solved so that the steady-state or dynamic behavior of the system can be predicted. The system components and connections are represented as a process flow diagram. Simulations can be as simple as the mixing of two substances in a tank, or as complex as an entire alumina refinery. Chemical process modeling requires a knowledge of the properties of the chemicals involved in the simulation, as well as the physical properties and characteristics of the components of the system, such as tanks, pumps, pipes, pressure vessels, and so on.

In 1963, he was the first Latin American jockey to win the Kentucky Derby. Baeza began his racing career in 1955 in Panama at Hipodromo Juan Franco, and in March of 1960, was invited to Miami, Florida to ride under contract for Owner/Trainer, Fred Hooper. He rode his first race in the US in the first race on Keeneland's opening day, 1960, and won it on Foolish Youth. Braulio Baeza's success in America was instantaneous. He was the leading money winner in American racing from 1965 to 1969, the 1968 winner of the George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award, and the 1972 and 1975 winner of the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Jockey. During his career, he rode a number of Thoroughbred greats, including Buckpasser, Graustark, Dr. Fager, and Ack Ack. In 1961, he won his first Belmont Stakes. Two years later, he rode to his first Kentucky Derby victory on Chateaugay, as well as for his second Belmont Stakes win. In 1969, he won the Belmont for the third time, denying Majestic Prince the Triple Crown, on board Paul Mellon's future Hall of Famer, Arts and Letters. In 1972, Baeza travelled to York Racecourse in England, where he rode John Galbraith's Roberto to victory over the previously unbeaten Brigadier Gerard in the inaugural Benson & Hedges Gold Cup. That same year, he went to Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, where he won the prestigious Canadian International Stakes on Droll Role for Trainer T. J.Kelly. Baeza was the jockey aboard Foolish Pleasure in the tragic 1975 match race against the great 3-year-old filly Ruffian, who had to be euthanized after she pulled up during the race with a broken front ankle. Braulio Baeza retired in 1976 after having won 3140 races in the United States. He was inducted that same year into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame.

It hosted the National Football League's Portsmouth Spartans from 1928 to 1933, as well as local high school teams. The stadium held 8,200 people at its peak and was built in 1928. In 1970, it was renamed Spartan Municipal Stadium. On October 5, 2003, the stadium was designated as a state historical site. The stadium is owned by the City of Portsmouth. After a fire in the 1990s, the city replaced walls and the press box. Also, the city upgraded the lighting thanks to a USDA grant. Several years ago, the city began limiting stadium use to only regular football games to help preserve the sod. In the past, both Portsmouth and Notre Dame High School football teams have played on the turf. The city wanted to sell the stadium to the Portsmouth City School District for one dollar, but the district turned down the offer as they received $10 million from a local foundation to construct their own athletic complex next to the new city school complex. Notre Dame High School (Portsmouth, Ohio) intends to remain at Spartan Stadium. Also, the Shawnee State University Board of Trustees recently approved a future buildings plan that would include a new stadium for the university. The city has even discussed demolishing the stadium for future development while local concerned residents have expressed the need to preserve the historical site. Spartan Municipal Stadium was recently identified through Portsmouth's participation in the America's Best Communities competition as an invaluable asset for the development of Portsmouth's riverfront area. In September 2017, Dr. Sean Dunne, a Sociology professor at Shawnee State University, submitted an application to State Farm's Neighborhood Assist Program for $25,000 to help renovate the stadium. In October 2017, it was announced that the application had advanced to the final round of 200 applications. After ten days of online voting, the grant was selected as one of 40 projects to win $25,000. The money has been used to begin the process of renovation at the stadium, with further renovation work to follow.

The ship was built to ferry government officials from York to Upper Canada's former capital of Newark (Niagara on the Lake). The ship's career was short, she was wrecked in 1811 off Hanlan's Point and was broken up. Description In the late 1790s, the Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada Peter Hunter made a request to his superiors for funds to construct a new vessel on Lake Ontario for the express purpose of shuttling government officials between meetings in Upper Canada. Government business had been delayed by the lack of transportation and Hunter sought to remedy this by building a vessel for exclusive use by officials. The request was granted and Hunter sought out John Dennis to construct the vessel. Dennis designed a yacht that was rigged as a schooner. The ship was considered good looking for the time. Toronto had a crew of seven. Service Dennis used his personal holdings located by the Humber River at York, Upper Canada to construct the ship. The ship was launched in August or September 1799. The sources disagree on when the ship was launched. Malcolmson states both 1798 and September 1799 and Colledge & Warlow stated August 1799. Used expressly for government service, Toronto could also take on private cargo at a charge. First commanded by Captain William Baker, in 1800, Lieutenant William Earle of the Provincial Marine took over. In 1811, Toronto was wrecked off Hanlan's Point. She lay along the shore, out of service. In response, the government began using the brig for government transport. Toronto was later broken up where it had been wrecked, with the iron fittings being used in other ship construction on the Great Lakes.

Widney returned to the Methodist church as a pastor and was appointed to the church's City Mission of Los Angeles (formally organized in 1908), where he ministered to thousands over the next several years. In 1899, he was the pastor of the Nazarene Methodist Episcopal Church. Growth of the congregation led to the building of a 500-seat building. He paid the full cost of construction and ministered without compensation. The new building was dedicated on June 3, 1900.LA Times June 4, 1900. In 1903 this church was renamed the Beth-El Methodist Episcopal Church.The Los Angeles Times (November 28, 1906). Widney resigned from the Methodist Episcopal church in 1911.

Widney described King as \\"one of the few great and broad-minded spirits of the church\\" (Frankiel, p30.). Racial beliefs Widney lamented the decline in influence and power of the original Hispanic population of California. Widney said, \\"You could visit the hospitals and almshouses in the late 'eighties and look in vain for the Mexican or the Spaniard.\\"McWilliams 69. Widney in his 1876 History indicates: \\"In the spring of 1850, probably three or four colored persons were in the city. In 1875, they numbered 175 souls, many of whom hold good city property acquired by industry. They are farmers, mechanics, or some other useful occupation, and remarkable for good habits\\".Beasley 110. African- American activist W. E. B. Du Bois used Widney's Race Life of the Aryan Peoples to support his own view of the significance of the contributions of blacks to the development of modern civilization. Widney wrote \\"They [the Negroes] once occupied a much wider territory and wielded a vastly greater influence upon earth than they do now.\\"Widney, Race Life II:238-39, quoted in Du Bois Asia, 11‚Äì12. In The Three Americas (1935), Widney suggested that the United States buy British Guiana from the United Kingdom and give it to the African Americans as reparations for slavery.Widney, The Three Americas (1935). In this book Widney also outlines the race life among aryans and others. He believed that \\"its people [of the West Indies] will remain, in a great degree, under the care and control of the stronger race-life...\\" he goes on to say that \\"It is the stronger civilization dominating the weaker. The science and factories of modern life are not found in the tropics.\\" Weather this text is read as international relations or as racial commentary is left to the reader although the fact that the text depends on an aryan supremacy in North America is clear. Later years Widney Hall in 1915 Widney attributed his longevity to living simply and keeping busy.Rand 97‚Äì98. At age 94, Widney advocated \\"no liquor, no tobacco, no drugs. I'm not a fanatic on liquor, but to me it is a medicine. I keep it around and take it when I need it. But there is no excuse whatever for tobacco or drugs\\".Rand 99.

He became USC's fifth president in 1921. A high priority of his administration was to expand professional training programs, and President von KleinSmid also presided over a building program that added nine major structures to the university campus. By the end of his first decade in office, USC had attained full national accreditation and established a graduate school to unify graduate work across the university. USC has long considered itself a cosmopolitan school with many foreign exchange students from around the world. During the 1930s, Prince Iyesato Tokugawa worked with USC to encourage student foreign exchange programs between the U.S. and Japan. During Prince Tokugawa's 1934 visit to the United States, von KleinSmid bestowed an Honorary Doctor of Laws Degree upon the Prince for his philanthropic and educational achievements. During that trip, Tokugawa also met with President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to discuss ways of promoting goodwill between the United States and Japan. In 1935, Roosevelt was also bestowed with an Honorary Doctor of Laws Degree. With the onset of the Great Depression at decade's end, USC was forced to retrench in the 1930s. During World War II, army barracks were constructed on campus, and the curriculum reflected a wartime emphasis on international relations, history, geography, languages, science and the like. Some 2,000 military trainees added to crowded conditions on campus. After the war, the lack of space at USC grew even worse, as the G.I. Bill brought former servicemen to the university for study. Enrollment soared from 15,500 in 1945 to more than 24,000 in 1947. In 1947 KleinSmid, then aged 70, elected to step down and became USC's chancellor, a position he held for the remaining seventeen years of his life. He was recognized as \\"one of three of the nation's most distinguished citizens\\" through the National Institute of Social Sciences Gold Medal Award. On an international level, KleinSmid received awards from 20 national governments for his achievements.VKC: A president's legacy - Lifestyle The Swiss-born American artist Adolfo M√ºller-Ury (1862‚Äì1947) painted his three-quarter length portrait in 1931; it was the gift of the Doheny family to the University of Southern California, who deaccessioned it in the 1980s. KleinSmid was a skilled fencer, and helped found the USC Fencing Club. A passionate supporter of eugenics, which he described as \\"the science of good birth\\",Rufus von KleinSmid, 1913, \\"Eugenics and the State,\\" p. 2, https://scholarworks.iupui.edu/bitstream/handle/1805/1150/von%20KleinSmit_%20Eugenics%20and%20the%20State.pdf and related sterilization programs,George Neumayr, Sterilization Particulars, 2003, http://spectator.org/archives/2003/07/18/sterilization-particulars KleinSmid co-founded the Human Betterment Association. He argued that \\"The acceptance is even now upon us, and the application of the principles of Eugenics to organized society is one of the most important duties of the social scientist of the present generation.\\" KleinSmid died on July 9, 1964.

He helped manage the hotel after an extensive career as an officer in the Merchant Navy and the Royal Navy. During World War II, he twice survived the sinking of the ship he was serving on. Sinclair is primarily known for being the inspiration for the character Basil Fawlty, played by John Cleese, in the television sitcom Fawlty Towers that Cleese co-wrote. This was owing to his allegedly stuffy, snobbish and eccentric treatment of his guests, including Cleese and other members of the Monty Python cast. Cleese later played a character named Donald Sinclair in the 2001 film Rat Race. Wartime career Bougie, Algeria, prior to sinking, November 1942 Prior to World War II, Sinclair was in the British Merchant Navy. As an officer in the Royal Naval Reserve, he was called up in September 1939 for military service. Soon after his call up, he joined the crew of the armed merchant cruiser (AMC) HMS Salopian. Salopian was a pre-war cargo liner that had been armed and converted into a warship as an emergency wartime measure. In May 1941, she was escorting a convoy in the North Atlantic. Early on the morning of the 13th, 400 miles south of Cape Farewell, Greenland, she was attacked by the U-boat U-98 in heavy fog. During successive attacks in the following six hours, Salopian was hit four times by torpedoes. Her engines were knocked out but she remained afloat and engaged the surfaced U-98 with gunfire. Salopian finally sank after a fifth torpedo broke her in half. All but three of the crew survived and were picked up the next day by the destroyers and . In July 1941, Sinclair joined the crew of the infantry landing ship HMS Karanja. In May 1942, Karanja took part in Operation Ironclad, the British invasion of Vichy French-controlled Madagascar. In November 1942, she took part in Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of French North Africa. On the morning of 12 November, at Bougie, Algeria, Karanja was hit in the engine room by at least two bombs from a German Junkers 88 bomber and set on fire, before subsequently sinking. From February 1943 until July 1945, Sinclair served on the escort carrier HMS Trumpeter. Trumpeter served in European waters, her duties included escorting convoys to the Soviet Union. With the end of the war in Europe, the ship was reassigned to the Far East and arrived Colombo in July 1945. Trumpeter was one of the ships assigned to take part in Operation Zipper, the recapture of Malaya, but the ending of the war meant only small part the planned attack was carried out. Sinclair left the navy in April 1946 with the rank of Lieutenant commander. Hotel career and later life The Gleneagles Hotel, Torquay, in 2009 Sinclair married Beatrice Ritchie (1915‚Äì2010) in Glasgow during the war. She was a policeman's daughter from Ellon, Aberdeenshire, who worked as a fashion consultant and designer at a Glasgow department store. She moved to Torquay to live with an aunt and avoid the German bombing of Glasgow. After the war ended, while her husband was still serving at sea, she opened a hotel in Torquay called Greenacres. The business was a success and in 1964, she bought a private house that she transformed into a second hotel. She named this Gleneagles after her favourite part of her native Scotland. By this time, her husband was assisting her in running the business. He made this decision reluctantly and would have preferred to remain at sea. Sinclair died in Torquay, Devon in 1981 aged 72, from a heart attack and stroke \\"when some workmen he'd upset painted his patio furniture and car gunmetal grey during the night.\\" His wife died 29 years later in September 2010; they are survived by their two daughters. Fawlty Towers The Monty Python cast met the Sinclairs while staying at the Gleneagles Hotel in May 1970; they were filming in nearby Paignton. Sinclair was reluctant to let them stay, but his wife argued in favour of them, as their three-week stay in the hotel represented a considerable amount of business during the hotel's off-season. Sinclair's actions included criticising American Terry Gilliam's table etiquette and throwing Eric Idle's briefcase out of a window because he thought it contained a bomb. The Monty Python cast left the hotel for other accommodation with the exception of John Cleese and his then-wife Connie Booth. Cleese later used his mannerisms as an inspiration for Basil Fawlty in Fawlty Towers. Several of the show's plot lines are alleged to be based in part on real-life events; the Gleneagles Hotel is referenced in the show's second episode, \\"The Builders\\". Cleese later played eccentric hotel owners in the 1999 remake film The Out-of-Towners and the 2001 movie Rat Race; in this latter piece, his character was called Donald Sinclair. Accuracy Opinions are divided on how closely Sinclair resembled Fawlty. Former staff and visitors have remembered actual events there that were as ludicrous as those depicted in the series. However, Sinclair's family is adamant that Fawlty was an inaccurate caricature. Beatrice Sinclair later described her husband as a \\"gentleman and a very brave man\\" and not \\"the neurotic eccentric that John Cleese made him out to be.\\" An accuracy she did acknowledge is that she was very much in charge of the business, just as Basil Fawlty was usually subordinate to his wife Sybil. The publication of Sir Michael Palin's diaries in 2006 supported Cleese's assessment of the Sinclairs.Diaries 1969‚Äì1979 ‚Äì The Python Years (published 2006) ‚Äì In the entries for 11 and 12 May 1970, it is recounted that Sinclair saw the Pythons as a \\"colossal inconvenience\\" and when Michael Palin and Graham Chapman decided to leave after one night, Beatrice Sinclair gave them a bill for two weeks.

He was a Yemeni member of parliament who had held the post of Oil and Mineral Resources Minister in the post-unification government of Yemen. Prior to the reunification of Yemen in 1990, Shamlan was the Minister of Infrastructure and Oil in the socialist government of South Yemen. He was the recognized presidential candidate of the Yemeni opposition coalition, a coalition which consists of the Islamist Islah, the Yemen Socialist Party and several smaller parties, in the 2006 presidential election, but was defeated by incumbent president Ali Abdullah Saleh. Early life Originally from Hadhramaut, Shamlan was educated in the elite Ghayl ba-Wazeer School [ƒ°ail bƒÅ wazƒ´r], which was one of the best schools in Yemen and beyond at the time. He then got a scholarship to Sudan to further his education in Bakht al-Ridha Institute (bakht al-ri·∏ça). From there he went to study Civil Engineering at Kingston University, in London, United Kingdom. Bin Shamlan, along with his school mates, played an important role in the history of modern Yemen. As a young activist, he was a mild Islamic nationalist, who, with other intellectuals from Hadhramaut and other parts of Yemen, was a pioneering activist in a moderate Islamic thought movement. But he preserved an independent position at the centre of the political spectrum. Role in South Yemen government During the war of liberation of occupied South Yemen he was part of a broad coalition of activists who overthrew the Qu'aiti Sultanate in Hadhramaut on 17 September 1967. In the interim period, before independence on 30 November 1967, he was a member of the \\"Supreme Popular Committee\\" which was formed by the revolutionaries to run Hadhramaut province. Bin Shamlan was charged with the day-to-day running of the province. After independence and the unification of South Yemen by the National Front for the Liberation of South Yemen (NLF), he was the first Minister of Public Works and Transport in the first cabinet of the independent People's Republic of South Yemen (President Qahtan Al-Shaabi's government). Bin Shamlan and Mohammad Abdul Qader Bafaqeeh, the Minister of Education, were the only non NLF members of the cabinet. One of the first tasks assigned to them by the NLF government was taking inventory of the palaces of the Sultans of Hadhramaut. Bin Shamlan and Bafaqeeh took stock of the palaces; made a record inventory; and preserved and stored every item. In 1969, Bin Shamlan was appointed as Executive Chairman of the Public Corporation for Electric Power which he continued to run successfully and efficiently until 1977. In 1977 he was appointed as Managing Director of the Aden Oil Refinery. Taking over from the BP management team, he ran the refinery professionally. From 1971 to 1990 he was a member of Supreme People's Council (the Parliament of People's Democratic Republic of Yemen). Role in post-unification Yemeni government After the 1990 unity, Bin Shamlan was a member of the Council of Representatives (the parliament of the Republic of Yemen, as the head of the independent block. As the multi-party system was adopted in the new Yemen after unity he founded along with Mr. Omar Tarmoom, Dr. Mohammad A.Q. Bafaqeeh, Dr. Kramah Salyan, and others a new moderate party called the Yemeni Free Forum, and issued a forum journal. In the 1993 and 1997 parliamentary elections he ran again for parliament and kept his seat, with a 66% vote. During the 1994 crisis he was in the unity camp. On September 29, 1994, the parliament approved a series of amendments to the constitution which, among other things, abolished the presidential council and replaced it with a one-man presidency. Two days later, parliament elected Ali Abdullah Saleh as president for a five-year term. Faisal Bin Shamlan, (independent) was a candidate along with three other candidates representing Islah, YSP and Ba'ath parties. He continued a Member of Parliament until 2003, when he resigned in protest to the amendment to the Constitution by which the parliament extended its tenure for a further 2 years, which Bin Shamlan deemed an unconstitutional move and resigned on the ground that his 4-year mandate by the people is over. He was appointed as Minister of Oil and Mineral Resources from October 1994, which he accepted on the condition that he would have power to reorganize and reform the Ministry. In March 1995, he resigned. In June 1995, in a Cabinet reshuffle President Saleh replaced Faisal Bin Shamlan with Mohammed Said al-Attar, formerly Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Industry, as Minister of Oil and Mineral Resources, in a move to tie the oil ministry closer to the President's office. In 1998-99, Bin Shamlan along with several Yemeni public figures including Dr. Faraj Bin Ghanim (ex Prime Minister, Dr. Abubakar Al-Qirby (Current Foreign Minister), Engineer Mohammed Al-Tayyeb (ex minister, GPC), Mr. Mohammed Abdo Saeed (business man), Dr. Mohammed Al-Afandi (economist, Islah Party), Ahmed Saleh Al-Salami (Yemeni Socialist Party activist), and Abdulaziz Al-Saqqaf (journalist and human rights activist), were working to set up the first Yemeni think tank, under the name of Yemen 21 Forum (Y21F) to help the country's evolution towards democracy, development, harmony and prosperity. The Y21F tasks included providing logistics for non-governmental organizations; addressing national issues and concerns; to co-sponsor and promote the establishment of the Yemeni Transparency, an anti-corruption NGO; to help in the ongoing correction and reform efforts; and to publish data and analysis on a periodic basis, and to issue an annual \\"State of the Nation\\" report. Presidential bid On 2 July 2006 the Joint Meeting Parties (JMP) opposition coalition officially announced that Bin Shamlan would be the JMP candidate for the presidential election of September 2006. In the election, held on September 20, bin Shamlan received about 22% of the vote according to official results. Death Bin Shamlan died in Aden on 1 January 2010 after a lengthy battle with cancer and having sought treatment abroad.

She served for several years in the fur trade on the Great Lakes, but is best known for playing a part in the Anglo-American War of 1812. She served for several years as a vital supply ship for the Provincial Marine. The Royal Navy took over the Provincial Marine in 1814 and so acquired Nancy. After HMS Nancy was blocked in by an American fleet near the mouth of the Nottawasaga River, her crew set her on fire on 14 August 1814 to prevent the capture of the ship and the cargo she carried. Forgotten for many years, the wreck was re- discovered in July 1927 and raised to form the centrepiece of the Nancy Island Museum. Construction Nancy was built south of Detroit along the Rouge River for the fur trading company Forsyth, Richardson and Company of Montreal. (Although Detroit was by rights on American territory, it was not handed over to the United States until the Jay Treaty was signed in 1796.) At this time the company was one of the several merchant firms based in Montreal that made up the loose partnership known as the North West Company. The Indian trade on the Great Lakes was conducted by larger sailing vessels whereas birchbark canoes remained the principal means of transport in the fur trade of the Canadian north-west via the Ottawa River. The ship was constructed out of white oak and eastern red cedar. The vessel was at the waterline, long at the deck and overall. The ship had a beam of and a depth of hold of , capable of carrying up to 350 barrels of cargo. Nancy was 67 tons burthen with two raked masts, square topsails and fore-and-aft mainsails. A figurehead in the shape of a fashionably-dressed lady with a hat and feather was situated on the bow. The ship was armed with two brass cannon mounted on the deck. John Richardson, one of the partners in the company, travelled to the trading post at Detroit to begin construction, accompanied by a master carpenter and six other carpenters. Construction began in late June 1789. On 23 September 1789, Richardson wrote: > The schooner will be a perfect masterpiece of workmanship and beauty. The > expense to us will be great, but there will be the satisfaction of her being > strong and very durable. Her floor-timbers, keel, keel-son, stem and lower > futtocks are oak. The transom, stern-post, upper futtocks, top-timbers, > beams and knees are all red cedar. She will carry 350 barrels.Cruikshank, > Ernest: An episode of the War of 1812: The Story of the Schooner Nancy; in > Zaslow (ed), p. 143. The schooner, named after Richardson's eldest daughter, was launched on 24 November that year. The following spring, she made her maiden voyage to Fort Erie, under the command of Captain William Mills, and in June 1790, went to Grand Portage at Sault Ste. Marie with a full cargo. For the next twenty-two years, Nancy was engaged in the fur trade. The ship changed owners several times, being sold first to George Leith and Company in 1793, and later to the North West Company in 1800. She changed commanders in 1805, when Captain Alexander MacIntosh replaced Captain Mills. War of 1812 Model of HMS Nancy Nancy was in MacIntosh's wharf at Moy (Windsor) when the War of 1812 broke out between the United States and Great Britain. Moved for protection to Amherstburg, the ship was taken by the commander of the British garrison, Lieutenant-Colonel St George, as a transport vessel. Before the war, Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Elliott of The Indian Department had surveyed Nancy as part of an inventory of the means available in case of war. According to Elliott, Nancy could mount six carriage guns and six swivel guns. The schooner was apparently armed with some guns. Most of these were dismounted from the schooner and used to arm several small gunboats patrolling the Detroit River. At some later date, Nancy received two guns and two carronades. On 30 July 1812, Nancy sailed to Fort Erie in convoy with the new Provincial Marine schooner , returning with military supplies and 60 men of the 41st Regiment who then participated in the Siege of Detroit. After the British and members of Tecumseh's Confederacy under Major General Isaac Brock had captured Detroit, Nancy carried troops, stores and provisions between Fort Erie and Detroit during the late summer and autumn. The following spring, on 23 April 1813 Nancy joined a small squadron in moving Major General Henry Procter's division from Amherstburg to Miami Bay, positioning them for what would be an unsuccessful Siege of Fort Meigs. On 9 September 1813, while Nancy was in Lake Huron on a trip to Fort Mackinac (which had been captured by a British force in the first few days of the war), the Americans won the decisive Battle of Lake Erie, capturing all the British armed vessels on the lake. Nancy was the only British ship remaining on the Upper Lakes. On 5 October, as Captain MacIntosh returned to the Detroit River, he sent some of the crew ashore to discover the situation. A storm blew up and MacIntosh entered the river anyway, as his anchors and cables were defective. A group of American militia on the river bank demanded that the schooner surrender. Instead, once the wind allowed, MacIntosh weighed anchor and sailed back up the river and into the lake. Although two American armed schooners and a gunboat were lying in wait for him further down the river, Nancy was damaged only by musket fire from the shore. On Lake Huron, the schooner was further battered by storms. Her sails and cables were too badly worn or damaged to withstand any more bad weather, so she sailed to Sault Ste. Marie, where she was laid up, and refitted by her crew during the winter. By recapturing Detroit, the Americans had cut the principal route by which the British at Fort Mackinac and other posts in the North West were supplied. During the winter, the British opened an alternate route overland from York on Lake Ontario via Yonge Street to Holland Landing and the Holland River. From here, the route entered Lake Simcoe and led to the head of Kempenfeldt Bay (Barrie) where Nine Mile Portage led to Willow Creek, the Nottawasaga River and Lake Huron. Lieutenant Colonel Robert McDouall reached Fort Mackinac via this route on 19 May 1814, to take charge of the post and the surrounding area. McDouall was accompanied by Lieutenant Newdigate Poyntz of the Royal Navy, who took charge of the naval establishment on Lake Huron, which essentially was Nancy only. (MacIntosh was retained as a pilot.) Plans to turn the schooner into a gunboat were discarded as unproductive, and the ship continued as a supply ship during that summer, making three round trips between the Nottawasaga and Mackinac. Destruction of Nancy During one of the ship's supply trips to the Nottawasaga, in July 1814, an American force left Detroit, intending to recover Fort Mackinac. Their frontal assault was defeated in the Battle of Mackinac Island. However, they had learned of the location of Nancy from a prisoner, and three of their vessels proceeded to Nottawasaga Bay. At the Nottawasaga, Lieutenant Miller Worsley of the Royal Navy had succeeded Poyntz and taken command of Nancy, which was about to sail to Mackinac with 300 barrels of flour, bacon and other rations. He was warned of the American presence and had Nancy towed up the river, where he hastily built a blockhouse armed with two 24-pounder carronades and a 6-pounder gun (presumably dismounted from the schooner). His force consisted of 21 sailors, 23 Ojibwa and 9 French-Canadian voyageurs. On 13 August, Captain Arthur Sinclair led three American vessels (, and ) into Nottawasaga Bay. The Americans believed that Nancy was still out on the lake and heading back to the Nottawasaga, and intended to wait in ambush for her in the bay. However, Sinclair landed some of his embarked troops to make an encampment on the spit of land between the river and the lake shore, and some wood-cutting parties discovered the schooner's hiding place. The next day, three companies of American regular infantry, supported by a mortar and the guns of Sinclair's ships, attacked Worsley's position. Faced with overwhelming odds, Worsley determined to scuttle Nancy to prevent the enemy from capturing her or her valuable stores. A line of powder was set running to Nancy and from there to the blockhouse. At four o'clock, Nancy was set alight, which in turn by way of the powder train, set off an explosion in the blockhouse. The blockhouse explosion surprised Sinclair, causing him to think that one of the howitzer's shots had found its mark. After the action, the gunboats Scorpion and Tigress were left to guard the river to prevent canoes and bateaux from getting supplies to Fort Mackinac. Eventually the river mouth was blocked with felled trees, and the two gunboats proceeded along the north shore in the hope of intercepting fur-laden canoes on the lake. Worsley and his men removed the obstructions and reached Mackinac in a large canoe on 31 August after paddling and rowing for . Reinforced by soldiers from the garrison of Mackinac and native warriors led by Chief Assiginack (Black Bird), Worsley subsequently surprised and captured both American gunboats in the Engagement on Lake Huron. Aftermath After the war, the Admiralty paid the North West Company ¬£2,200 for the destruction of the ship in service, with additional compensations for services between 1812 and 1814 totaling ¬£1,243, 5s. The Detroit River incident of 5 October 1813 was the basis for the song \\"The Nancy\\" by Canadian singer/songwriter Stan Rogers on his From Fresh Water album. Nancy Island An island grew over the remains of the ship as silt was deposited by the river around the sunken hull. The hull remained visible under water. It was discovered on 1 July 1911 by C. H. J. Snider, a noted Canadian marine historian and editor of the Toronto Telegram, but drew little notice until after 1924. In August of that year, Snider, Dr. Alfred H. Macklin, C. W. Jefferys and Dr. F. J. Conboy began a fund-raising campaign to assist with the recovery of the wreck the following year. In the process, the recovery crew found numerous valuable artifacts including an assortment of 24-pounder and 6-pounder shot. Following further explorations by C. H. J. Snider and his salvage crew, the hull was excavated. Nancys figurehead, ship's cutlery and numerous personal artifacts were recovered from both the bottom and the banks of the Nottawasaga River. Dr. Macklin and C. W. Jefferys persuaded the Government of Canada to provide a World War I-style metal military storage building for the museum. In 1923, the site was designated a National Historic Site by Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada and a cairn was erected in 1954. In 1927, the remains of Nancy were raised and relocated onto the island. The Nancy Museum was opened on the island on 14 August 1928 to recognize the ship and its major contribution to the war effort. In 1968, the contemporary museum was opened, which includes audiovisual displays, a lighthouse and theatre. In 1978, the site was placed under the management of Wasaga Beach Provincial Park.

Formation Pyramid Mountain erupted about 12,000 years ago. It was once mistaken for a cinder cone and is now known to have erupted underneath about of glacial ice. The volcano erupted vigorously and cooled rapidly when the hot lava contacted the surrounding ice and melted it, creating an envelope of water around the rising volcano. The result was a cement-like surface with smoothed cobbles of granite, schist, phyllite and other non-volcanic pebbles which were carried by the ice from many kilometers distant. As a result of this type of eruption, Pyramid Mountain has no crater and no lava flows stretching away from its base. The secondary cone to the east (best seen from Clearwater Valley Road near Hemp Creek) was not formed by a separate eruption, but was simply a slump when the ice melted away from Pyramid, releasing the pressure against its slopes.Goward, Trevor and Hickson, Cathie (1995).

Life in Cuba In 1957, Pedro D√≠az Lanz joined Fidel Castro's rebel group in Santiago, Cuba. He was employed as a commercial pilot with the airline Aerov√≠as Q. He later acted as head of the Revolutionary Air Force, and during 1958 he smuggled weapons and ammunition from Costa Rica and Florida into Cuba by air.Thomas, Hugh. 1971, 1986. The Cuban Revolution. Weidenfeld and Nicolson. London. (Shortened version of Cuba: The Pursuit of Freedom, includes all history 1952-1970) After the Cuban Revolution on 1 January 1959, he was confirmed as head of the new Revolutionary Air Force as well as Castro's personal pilot. Within months, he became vocal about his opposition to the influence of communists on the new revolutionary government. On 29 June 1959, Fidel Castro relieved him of his post, and he left immediately by boat for Florida with his second wife and 3 of his six children, and reportedly with Frank Sturgis, a fellow anti-communist.Szulc, Tad. 1986. Fidel - A Critical Portrait. Hutchinson. Life after Cuba On 14 July 1959, D√≠az was interviewed by the US Senate Internal Security subcommittee, where he gave out the first account of Fidel's planned move towards communism. On 21 October 1959 he carried out one of his most notorious acts, flying a twin-engined bomber (variously reported as a B-25 or B-26) over Havana while dropping anti-communist leaflets, along with his brother Marcos Diaz Lanz. Pedro Diaz Lanz piloted and Marcos Diaz Lanz threw the leaflets down from an open bomb hatch. The unsuccessful gunfire from armed forces on the ground caused injuries and deaths, leading to unsubstantiated reports of bombs being dropped from the aircraft. By April 1960, he was recruited by the CIA and became a member of Operation 40, a group of CIA operatives who specialized in carrying out secret anti-Castro assassinations and acts of sabotage. Then on May 27 of 1960, the Miami Herald published a list of names of pilots who were placed on a U.S. Government 'Blacklist' thereby prohibiting them from flying to Cuba; on that list was Pedro Luis Diaz Lanz.http://cuban- exile.com/doc_101-125/doc0110.html D√≠az committed suicide with a gunshot wound to the chest in 2008 at the age of 81 after years of poverty and depression.El Nuevo Herald (2008) Notes  See also  * Manuel Artime External links *Judiciary Hearings of Communist Threats to America Through the Caribbean *TIME Magazine: Towards Dictatorship *The Political End of \\"President\\" Urrutia *WILFREDO CANCIO ISLA.

It came into force on 27 December 1949 and was replaced by the Provisional Constitution of 1950 on 17 August 1950. Background From the day after the proclamation of Indonesian independence on 17 August 1945, the original Constitution of Indonesia approved by the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence was in force. As the Dutch wanted to retain their colony, the war of independence broke out between Dutch forces and Indonesian republicans. However, following international pressure, negotiations took place leading to the Linggadjati Agreement to establish a federal United States of Indonesia. A constitutional assembly would be established and the Indonesian side would start work on a constitution for the new state. Following the January 1948 Renville Agreement, Dutch and Republican committees both presented drafts. The Indonesian committee, chaired by Soepomo, produced a document that was very different from the 1945 Constitution as it contained human rights guarantees and provided for a bicameral system of government, with a senate and a lower chamber. By the end of March, the two sides were almost completely in agreement. However, the Republican side wanted a dominant role within the federal state, while the Dutch wanted a greater role for the non-Republic states. In the run up to the Dutch‚ÄìIndonesian Round Table Conference at which the Dutch would hand over sovereignty to the United States of Indonesia (RUSI), Ide Anak Agung Gde Agung, prime minister of the State of East Indonesia, one of the non-Republic states, invited future RUSI government officials to attend an Inter-Indonesia Conference to agree on a negotiating position. Two such conferences were held, in July and August 1949. The delegates agreed on the basic principles and outline for the Federal Constitution. Content The constitution had 197 articles in six main sections: Enactment and abrogation The 1949 Federal Constitution came into force with the formal handing over of sovereignty to the newly established United States of Indonesia on 27 December 1949. However, in the following eight months, the various states and autonomous regions dissolved themselves into the largest state, the Republic of Indonesia. On 17 August 1950, the United States of Indonesia was officially dissolved by President Sukarno and replaced by a unitary Republic of Indonesia with a new provisional constitution.

She is from Tokyo and joined the revue in 1991 and retired in 2006. She is the first and the only musumeyaku of her class to receive top billing. Troupe membership history * Star Troupe: 1991‚Äì1993 * Snow Troupe: 1993‚Äì1998 * Cosmos Troupe: 1998‚Äì2006 Facts Considered the \\"Mary Pickford of Takarazuka\\", she gained audiences' attention during her first years in Star Troupe, and three years after her debut, in 1994, became top musumeyaku of Snow troupe. Having performed with five different stars as partners, Maki Ichiro (of the Snow troupe), Fubuki Takane (Snow), Y≈´ Todoroki (Snow), Asato Shizuki (Cosmos) and Y≈çka Wao (Cosmos)the latter her partner the longest‚Äîover the course of twelve years, Hanafusa enjoyed the longest run as star musumeyaku in the Takarazuka's history. Also, upon her participation in the 1994 new actor production of Gone with the Wind as Scarlett O'Hara, Hanafusa became the only musumeyaku to have her own billing (top billing usually goes to otokoyaku; so this was an exceptional case). Along with Hitomi Tsukikage (of Star and Snow troupes) and Rei Dan (Moon and Star), she was one of the few musumeyaku to star in two troupes. In 1998, she founded Cosmos Troupe with Asato Shizuki, Y≈çka Wao, Wataru Kozuki and Hikaru Asami with an overseas performance in Hong Kong. She retired in 2006. In January 2007, she came out of retirement and performed on stage along with Y≈çka Wao in Wao's concert. Up until 2011, Hanafusa worked as an official representative for Y≈çka Wao in Wao's company, Wao Enterprise, which they founded together in February 2007. During this period, Hanafusa has regularly appeared in most of Wao's concerts or as co-star in stage plays where Wao has starred. It is unusual for partnering stars who have left Takarazuka to continue to work together so closely. As of October 2011 however, Hanafusa has resigned from Wao Enterprise after participating in Dracula with Wao. Although she had participated as a guest star in a couple of performances with other Japanese artists, there was no official announcements as to what Hanafusa's future career direction will be until June 2012. In June 2012 it was released that Hanafusa had signed with From First Production, a talent promotion agency. Her talent profile is found here.

Thus she was an Elisabeth who was haunted by two deaths (Maki Ichiro and Asato Shizuki), married to two Franz Josephs (Fubuki Takane and Y≈çka Wao), assassinated by two Luigi Luchenis (Y≈´ Todoroki and Wataru Kozuki). She crowned four Prince Rudolfs (Tatsuki K≈çju, Y≈çka Wao, Hikaru Asami and Sakiho Juri) because K≈çju and Asami changed troupes before the Tokyo performance and were substituted by Wao and Juri.

Coat of arms of the lordship and principality of Piedmont. Philip I, known as Philip of Savoy (, ) (1278 ‚Äì September 25, 1334) was the lord of Piedmont from 1282 until his death and prince of Achaea between 1301 and 1307. He was the son of Thomas III of Piedmont and Guyonne de Ch√¢lon. Philip's first marriage was celebrated in Rome on February 12, 1301 to Isabella of Villehardouin, Princess of Achaea. By that marriage, he became Prince of Achaea, though he had already been lord of Piedmont by inheritance from his father in 1282. He was, however, an authoritative prince and this put him at odds with the baronage of his realm. He tried to placate the barons of Morea, but was forced to accept a parliament in 1304.

The strike collapsed after two weeks when 8,000 state militia entered the town and other unions refused to support the workers. Events of the strike In early 1892, the New York state legislature passed a law mandating a 10-hour work-day and increases in the day- and night-time minimum wage. Switchmen in Buffalo were members of the Switchmen's Mutual Association, a national union with about 15,000 members. On August 12, switchmen in the Buffalo railyards struck the Lehigh Valley Railroad, the Erie Railroad and the Buffalo Creek Railroad after the companies refused to obey the new law. Violence quickly broke out. On August 13, a number of abandoned rail cars were set on fire. The Buffalo police, sympathetic to the workers' cause, refused to help the railroads break the strike. On August 14, additional rail cars outside the city limits were set ablaze. The sheriff of Erie County swore in a number of special deputies but was unable to stop the arson.The union publicly asserted that none of its members had set fire to the rail cars. It remains unclear whether union members or local hooligans committed the various acts of arson. On August 15, Democratic Governor Roswell P. Flower called out the New York State Guard to restore order and protect the railroads' property. However, State Guard Brigadier General Peter C. Doyle, commanding the Fourth Brigade, held a full- time position as an agent of the Lehigh Valley Railroad and was determined to crush the strike. Even though more than 8,000 soldiers invested the town, violence continued. As the 65th Regiment detrained 200 soldiers at a Buffalo train station on August 15, an unmanned train loaded with explosives steamed through the station. The explosives detonated, wounding three soldiers. Guard commanders soon found that many railroad tracks in the city had been mined. When trains passed over the tracks, the pressure of the train on the tracks set off the bombs. The striking switchmen claimed that they had not engaged in arson, and that the rail cars which had burned were abandoned. But Gen. Doyle refused to accept either claim. He ordered dozens of strikers imprisoned, and encouraged his troops to deal harshly with any workers who interfered, or seemed about to interfere, with the keeping of the peace. The strike began to collapse. The railroads brought in hundreds of strikebreakers. Striking switchmen were beaten by troops and Erie County sheriff's deputies. Troops broke up mass meetings, clubbing workers with the butts of their rifles. The violence led switchmen on the New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad (known by the pronunciation of its acronym as the 'Nickel Plate') and the New York Central Railroad to strike in sympathy. The leaders of the switchmen's union called on other railroad unions to engage in a general strike in support of their job action. The president of the Switchmen's Mutual Association called the heads of the Order of Railway Conductors, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and the Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen to Buffalo for a meeting. But the August 23 conference was brief: The other unions refused to take their members out on strike. Unable to fight both soldiers and scabs without help, the switchmen ended their strike on August 25, 1892. The switchmen agreed to return to work, but the railroads blacklisted most of the workers. Impact of the strike Prior to the Buffalo switchmen's strike, most railroad unions in the United States did not engage in consultation and coordination in order to increase their collective bargaining power. Attempts in 1886 and 1889 to form a federation of rail unions quickly collapsed. But the defeat of the Buffalo switchmen's union proved to be a powerful lesson in labor unity. Eugene V. Debs, national secretary of the Locomotive Firemen, resigned his position a month after the switchmen's strike in order to work full-time on the creation of a national union of railway workers. Debs was successful in forming the American Railway Union (ARU) in June 1893. But the ARU would prove to be short-lived. The union was crushed in the violent Pullman strike of 1894. The union's collapse pushed Debs toward Socialism. The Pullman strike also convinced many in the American labor movement that the government was a tool of corporate interests, and that they could no longer openly oppose large corporations. The Pullman strike caused a conservative shift in the American Federation of Labor from which the labor body has not emerged.

It was developed in the late 1990s for service with the United States Military Police Corps. The first prototypes appeared in February 1997 and serial production of the M1117 commenced between 1999 and early 2000. The M1117 was one of the first American military vehicles to be built on a specialized mine-resistant hull, and after 2001 was adopted in increasing numbers as a direct response to the threat posed by improvised explosive devices to US forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. Its armament consists of an Mk 19 grenade launcher and M2HB Browning machine gun, mounted in a turret similar to that used on the U.S. Marine Corps' Amphibious Assault Vehicle; and a M240H Medium Machine Gun mounted outside the gunner's hatch. The vehicle was utilized by American military police and convoy security units in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is a more heavily protected and heavily armed alternative to the armored Humvee which was not originally designed to be a protected fighting vehicle. In 2015 Textron Systems rebranded the M1117 as the COMMANDO‚Ñ¢ family of vehicles, bringing back the name of the vehicle from which the M1117 was derived.COMMANDO‚Ñ¢ Elite - Textron Systems, 7 October 2016 History U.S. Army National Guard M1117 Armored Security Vehicles at Fort Stewart, Georgia in June 2010. In the 1980s, U.S. military doctrine emphasized two distinct types of equipment. Tanks and infantry fighting vehicles were for frontline combat, and unarmored utility vehicles for transport behind the lines. In 1993, the military had to fight through Mogadishu in unarmored Humvees, leading to the development of up-armored models. Many generals doubted the benefits, but the Military Police Corps, tasked with patrolling the \\"safe\\" rear area behind the battle line insisted that the Army fund a slow but steady production of the bullet resistant M1114 Humvee. In 1999, the United States Army began buying a limited number of M1117s (originally the ASV-150) for the Military Police Corps. This purpose-built ASV was derived from Cadillac Gage's previous Commando family of AFV which was used in Vietnam for base security. The ASV 150 is a much improved version of the earlier Cadillac Gage 100/150, with improved armor protection and better maneuverability due to the use of Timoney's independent suspension system. M1117 at Fort Irwin National Training Center The ASV uses an advanced modular expandable armor package from IBD Deisenroth Engineering, consisting of ceramic composite applique on the exterior and spall liner on the interior. At $800,000 each, the M1117 was significantly more expensive than the $140,000 price for an M1114 and $220,000 (2011) for an armoured M1114. They were field tested by MP units in Kosovo mostly by members of the 709th MP Battalion.Safer Vehicles For Soldiers. The program was canceled in 2002 because of budget priorities. The United States Army believed that existing vehicles could be used without an \\"unacceptable level of risk.\\" When the Iraq War began in 2003, there were 49 ASVs in service, with almost all of them being assigned to MP Units. The first MP unit to officially use them in a combat zone was the 527th MP Company and other elements of the 720th MP Battalion. However, the onset of events in Iraq gave new life to the ASV program as HMMWVs proved vulnerable to attacks and a large source of casualties. Up-armored HMMWVs were not designed to be armored cars like the M1117, which are designed to withstand hits from small arms, mines and rockets in front-line combat units. Soldiers who used them, and some members of Congress visiting Iraq favored them over other mine protected vehicles. As of mid-2007, 1,729 vehicles were delivered or under contract with many being dispersed not just to MPs but numerous other military units including the Iraqi National Police. In response to urgent United States Army requirements in the mid-2000s, production increased from one ASV every three weeks to 56 vehicles per month. The plant that produces the vehicles is located in New Orleans and was heavily damaged by Hurricane Katrina. The manufacturing facilities have since been rebuilt and expanded to five buildings and personnel have more than doubled. The vehicle is a 21st-century version of the V-100 Cadillac Gage Commando which was used by the U.S. Army Military Police during the Vietnam War,Doyle, p. 2 whose duties often consisted of providing armed escort for wheeled convoys. The USAF in South Vietnam utilized an open hatched (turret-less) Commando for base security missions.Doyle, p. 2, 40 A variant was to be evaluated by the U.S. Marine Corps as part of the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicle program. As of May 18, 2007, after their vehicle submission failed ballistics testing at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Textron received word that they would not receive further orders as part of the MRAP program.Textron‚Äôs M1117 Removed from MRAP Competition However, in early 2008, Textron was awarded a contract to build 329 ASVs worth $228 million. They will be delivered with the latest fragmentation protection kits.

Design M2HB machine gun (left) and Mk 19 grenade launcher (right) At about 15 tons, the M1117 is lighter than the 20 ton Stryker ICV or 25 ton M2 Bradley armored vehicle. It can reach a speed of 20 miles per hour in 7 seconds.\\"M117 Armored Security Vehicle Data Sheet.\\" Textron Marine and Land Systems, 17 May 2011. Web. Retrieved 1 Aug 2012. It is only wide, compared to for a Bradley. Buttoned up, the crew has 360¬∞ visibility. In size and capability, it fits between the Humvee and the $5 million Stryker. The crew compartment is fully air-conditioned. Survivability The Guardian's armor is designed to defeat small arms fire, mines and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). The armor is angled presenting no vertical surfaces, deflecting many rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) hits. If an RPG does hit the vehicle directly, it can still function, although crew survivability varies depending on the location at which the RPG hits. Angled armor is more resistant to attack than vertical armor due to the shape of the V-shape hulls deflecting explosive forces, as opposed to a single-plane hull which takes the entire force impact. ASVs in Iraq and Afghanistan have withstood several IED attacks, some vehicles multiple times. One ASV returned after an IED destroyed all four tires. As for chemical and biological attacks, the ASV's gas particulate air filtration system was designed to provide additional protection, but is currently not in service due to lack of crew masks for the system. The ASV has experienced several rollover incidents. Soldiers have a higher survivability rate when rolling over, as the turret is fully enclosed protecting the gunner from ejection. However, there have been at least two incidents of rollovers that resulted in the deaths of two soldiers when the turret broke away from the vehicle. Since the incidents, Textron has started adding 15 additional bolts to the vehicle turret. Mobility An M1117 navigates through an obstacle at a rough terrain driving course The typical mission profile of an ASV involves 50% travel primary roads, 30% travel on secondary roads, and 20% cross-country travel. It uses a model MD3560 Allison Transmission. Front and rear independent suspension provides smooth highway speeds of up to , while it is capable of fording depths of water, climbing gradients of 60%, negotiating 30% side slope, and overcoming obstacles of five feet. Its turning radius is , and it has ground clearance. Six ASVs can enplane on a C-17, fully loaded and ready to roll off. Also, the CH-53E Super Stallion is able to carry one ASV. Variants The following variants are known to be in production/service: * Command & Control * Recovery Vehicle (Each ASV can flat tow another ASV or HMMWV) * Reconnaissance Surveillance & Target Acquisition (RSTA) * Ambulance * Infantry Carrier Vehicle (ICV, alternate name for an Armored Personnel Carrier (APC)) ‚Äì 24 in longer than ASV, armed with cupola mounting for a machine gun or grenade launcher instead of a turret, carries 3 crew and 8 troops.M1117 ICV - Strategypage.com, February 10, 2013 * M1200 Armored Knight FiST-V Direct fire support variant With the adoption of the M1117 as the Mobile Strike Force Vehicle (MSFV) by the Afghan National Army, demand increased for much larger caliber weapons systems mounted on the same chassis which would provide it with an organic anti-tank and fire support capability. On 22 October 2013, a new fire support variant of the M1117 was unveiled at the Association of the United States Army (AUSA) by Textron. This model, described as the Commando Select 90mm Direct Fire Vehicle, was designed with an exceptionally large turret ring and carried a Cockerill Mk III 90mm low-pressure cannon. It provided the M1117 with an extremely potent form of firepower for its size and weight class, firing canister, high explosive, high explosive squash head, and high explosive anti-tank shells, as well as an armour-piercing discarding sabot round capable of destroying older main battle tanks. One advantage of the low-pressure cannon was that, in spite of its relatively large caliber, it could be mounted on a vehicle weighing only 18 metric tonnes, or about 40,000 pounds, combat loaded. The new armament was also fitted with a single-baffle muzzle brake and concentric hydro-spring recoil mechanism as standard to reduce the pressure exerted on the relatively light chassis. According to Textron, it invested in the 90mm Direct Fire Vehicle as a direct response to the Afghan requirement for a more heavily armed MSFV. Afghanistan immediately ordered 50 and offered to purchase the vehicle through the Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program, with grants from the US government. However, since the 90mm cannon and most of the turret components were made in Belgium, US military officials blocked the sale until they could qualify and approve that particular combination for export through FMS. In 2014, the procurement process was suspended when the US canceled its funding for the sale of almost 300 MSFVs, including the 50 Direct Fire Vehicles, to the Afghan National Army citing budgetary constraints. The US military had not yet finished its testing of the Belgian weapons system at the time, so none were ever delivered. As Kabul's requirement for a fire support variant of the MSFV remained unfulfilled, Textron agreed to revisit the potential sale with Afghan officials in 2017. Around the same time, Iraq requested an undisclosed number of 90mm Direct Fire Vehicles from Textron for its ongoing campaign against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. The sale was pending review by the US government in February 2017. Foreign variants Bulgaria uses a variant of the M1117 APC fitted with a NSVT heavy machine gun instead of the M2. Not all vehicles have been converted this way. The Iraqi Armored Personnel Carrier ASV variant is configured for transport. The Iraqis also have modified some of their ASVs to accommodate an anti-air turret.

The river flows generally south, joined by two minor tributaries, spills into the Belfast Lough and then reaches its mouth to empty into Port Fairy Bay in the Bass Strait near . The river descends over its course. The mouth of the river has been significantly altered. The river originally spilled into the Bass Strait, south of the town of Port Fairy, through a series of narrow channels that led westward from the site of the present-day mouth. At that stage, the southern outlet of the Moyne, the Back Passage, was narrow and the opening to the sea was often too rough for boats to leave or enter the port; the main eastern outlet was blocked by a shallow sand bar.

She had originally been built as Vittoria, but was renamed before being launched. She was constructed to a design by George Record, and was built under a private contract by Master shipwright John Goudie. She served on Lake Ontario, having been commissioned at Oswego on 5 May 1814 under Captain William Mulcaster. The ship took part in the British attack on Fort Oswego and blockade of Sackett's Harbor on Lake Ontario in 1814. In November that year she came under the command of Captain Edward Collier, and was renamed HMS Burlington on 9 December 1814. Captain Nicholas Lockyer took command in June 1816. Burlington was offered for sale in January 1833, but there were no buyers and she was later towed away and scuttled. Description Princess Charlotte was designed by George Record of the Kingston Royal Naval Dockyard in Kingston, Upper Canada. The frigate was constructed under private contract by the master shipwright John Goudie. The vessel measured 755 tons burthen and was long overall and long at the keel. The frigate had a beam of and a draught of . The frigate's hold had a depth of . The frigate was pierced for 40 gunports but carried 42 guns. Princess Charlotte was armed with twenty-four long guns on her upper deck and sixteen carronades and two carronades on her quarterdeck and forecastle. The vessel had a complement of 280 officers and enlisted. Service history In September 1813, the commander-in-chief of British forces in North America, Sir George Prevost approved further ship construction on Lake Ontario during the War of 1812. Initially the plan was to construct a transport brig, but this idea was later changed to two frigates. The frigate was the first of the two ordered to begin construction. Initially called Vittoria for the recent victory in Spain by British forces, the vessel's name was changed to Princess Charlotte during construction, this time named for one of King George III's daughters. Before the frigate was fully constructed, the commander of British naval forces on Lake Ontario, Commodore Sir James Lucas Yeo, awarded command of the vessel to Commander William Mulcaster, advancing him to the rank of post-captain. Princess Charlotte was launched on 14 April 1814, the same day as the second frigate under construction, . The vessel was commissioned under Captain Mulcaster on 5 May 1814 at Oswego. Commodore Yeo's Lake Ontario squadron departed Kingston transporting troops for an attack on Fort Oswego. They arrived on 5 May, where it was decided that Mulcaster would lead a naval detachment of 200 men ashore to assault the fort from its western flank. Princess Charlotte would remain offshore, carrying reserves for the battle. At 06:00 on 6 May, the battle began at 09:00, Mulcaster had moved Princess Charlotte into position where the frigate could bombard the fort with her 24-pounder long guns. The frigate opened fire at 13:00 and under the naval bombardment, the landing began. Mulcaster's men stormed the main shore battery. During the assault, Mulcaster was severely injured when he was shot through the leg. Lieutenant John Scott of Princess Charlotte took over command of the attack on the western flank. Fort Oswego was captured and the reserves aboard Princess Charlotte were landed to secure the perimeter around the fort and town. Supplies and goods were taken and the squadron returned to Kingston on 8 May. On 11 May, the squadron sailed again along the south shore of Lake Ontario and began a naval blockade of the main United States naval base on the lake at Sackets Harbor, New York. With Mulcaster's severe injuries, command of Princess Charlotte passed to Captain Edward Collier. Princess Charlotte was stationed off Stony Island during the blockade. On 29 May, a British force under Captains Stephen Popham and Francis Spilsbury was defeated at Sandy Creek by the American units they were sent to capture. This defeat led Yeo to lift the blockade on 5 June and return to Kingston. For the rest of the summer, Princess Charlotte remained within Kingston's harbour. On 1 October, command of Princess Charlotte was given to Captain Richard O'Connor with newly-arrived Captain Peter Fisher being awarded the command of the much smaller Montreal. This did not sit well with Fisher, as he believed that he should have been given command of Princess Charlotte, being the senior captain. After attempting to address the issue with Yeo, which failed, Fisher sent a complaint to the Admiralty. This complaint was among the reasons that led to Yeo's recall by the Admiralty in November. On 16 October, the new flagship , accompanied by the rest of the squadron, transported infantry reinforcements and supplies to General Gordon Drummond in the Niagara region, arriving on 20 October. With the arrival of St Lawrence on Lake Ontario, the American squadron no longer attempted to wrest control of the lake from the British. On 9 December 1814, the frigate was renamed Burlington. Following the war, the vessel remained in commission and came under the command of Captain Nicholas Lockyer in June 1816. Later that year, the frigate was laid up in ordinary. Burlington was put up for sale in January 1833, but finding no buyers, was towed away and scuttled in Deadmans Bay in Lake Ontario. The wrecksite, along with those of St Lawrence and Prince Regent were designated a National Historic Site of Canada in 2015.

She was built at the Kingston Royal Naval Dockyard in Kingston, Upper Canada during the War of 1812, using frames shipped from Britain and assembled in Upper Canada. The ship was not completed until after the end of the war in 1815 and did not enter service. Under the Rush‚ÄìBagot Treaty of 1816, the frigate was disarmed and laid up at Kingston. The ultimate fate of the ship is unknown. Background As the balance of power on the Great Lakes during the War of 1812 shifted between British and American forces, the naval effort turned to one of preservation. The opposing commanders on the Great Lakes, Sir James Yeo and Isaac Chauncey sought to build larger vessels to overpower the other while preventing an attack on their lines of communication. The ships that were constructed at Kingston, Upper Canada were similar in design to those being built for war on the oceans. In an effort to bolster the British squadron on the Great Lakes in 1813 following the loss at the Battle of Lake Erie, the British government created a plan where four pre-fabricated warships would be constructed in shipyards in Great Britain, dismantled and transported to Lower Canada where the vessels would be then transported up the Saint Lawrence River to Kingston for re-assembly. This plan came about due to the excess of material, builders and facilities available in Great Britain and all lacking in Upper Canada. The plan was rejected by General Sir George Pr√©vost, commander of British forces in North America, believing that the idea would strain British supply lines between Montreal, Lower Canada and Kingston. The idea was resurrected in 1814 by the British government. Pr√©vost turned to his officers and they recommended the plan once again be halted due to the impracticality of the transportation of warships. The lack of material on the Great Lakes made it impossible to provide all the fittings and stores the ships would require and the special requirements that would be needed to transport the frames from Montreal to Kingston would be in danger of American attack. Pr√©vost sent the rejection to London, but it arrived nearly two months after the first components of the warships had landed at Montreal. Construction and description Two vessels were designed to be a 38-gun frigates known as Prompte and Psyche. The frames of the frigates were constructed out of fir, an inferior material which was not suitable for sea- going ships. The vessels were built in Great Britain at Chatham dockyard and dismantled. The pieces were transported across the Atlantic, the first of which landed at Montreal in June 1814. Pr√©vost attempted to ease strain on government supply lines by hiring the private contractor William Forbes to move Frigate B (Psyche) up the Saint Lawrence River to be assembled at Kingston. It was reported that this effort cost the Royal Navy ¬£300,000. The decision by the Admiralty was based upon the belief that there was a lack of suitable white pine growing around Kingston to build frigates this large. Meanwhile, after receiving Pr√©vost's communications nixing the plan, the Admiralty re-directed the two pre-fabricated sloops to Halifax, Nova Scotia and cancelled the construction of the frigates. However, once again the decision arrived late at its destination, not being received by Pr√©vost until October when Frigate B was nearly completed. The speed at which William Forbes and his workers transported the frames of Frigate B to Kingston earned him a ¬£1,000 bonus. Master Shipwright Thomas Strickland had been sent from Great Britain to take control of the construction project. With Sir James Yeo and Point Frederick yard commissioner Robert Hall, Strickland re-designed Frigate B, completely planking the upper deck, creating a spar deck which allowed an increase of armament from 38 to 56 guns. As built, Frigate B was long between perpendiculars and long at the keel. The vessel had a beam of , a depth of hold of and a draught of . The frigate measured 769 tons burthen and had a complement of 280 officers and sailors. Frigate B was armed with 28 long guns on its lower deck and 28 carronades on its upper deck. Service history Frigate B's keel was laid down on 31 October 1814 at Kingston Royal Naval Dockyard in Kingston. The frigate was launched on 25 December 1814 and was completed in early 1815. The launch of Psyche would mark that last major warship to begin its career during the War of 1812. Named Psyche, the frigate joined the Lake Ontario squadron under Sir James Yeo. On 19 March 1815, Yeo was replaced by Commodore Edward Owen who raised his pennant in Psyche. Following the end of the war in 1815 Psyche was hauled out and placed on a slipway, the frame stripped down for preservation. The Rush‚ÄìBagot Treaty of 1816 limited the navies on the Great Lakes to one gunboat armed with one gun, which led to the remaining fleet being disarmed. The frigate remained in this condition until 1827, when, declining funds and the poor condition of the existing fleet led the Naval Commissioner to abandon hopes of refitting the existing vessels and instead start new construction. Beginning in 1832, all the vessels at Kingston were sold under the Whig government and the dockyard closed in 1835. Psyche was pulled apart on the slipway at Kingston throughout the 1830s. Those hulks that were not sold were either left to rot at Navy Bay or taken around Point Henry to Hamilton Bay and scuttled there. The exact fate is uncertain. Colledge & Warlow have the hulk being sold. Lardas claims the hulk sank at its moorings in the late 1830s. Winfield states the vessel shared the fate of HMS Kingston and was taken to Deadman Bay off Kingston and sunk there.

Their family initially refused to cooperate with police in the homicide investigation into the children's murder. The father, then 21-year-old Chris Kahui, was charged with their murder. His defence was that the mother, Macsyna King, was responsible for the deaths. After a six-week trial, the jury took just one minute to acquit him.\\"The Star-Times understands the Kahui jury deliberated for just one minute not 10 minutes as previously reported. As soon as the jury was sent to deliberate, members were polled and everyone said Kahui was not guilty that took one minute. The jury then went to lunch and returned its verdict as soon as lunch was over.\\" In July 2012, a coroner's report was released, which concluded that the children's injuries occurred \\"whilst they were in the sole custody, care and control of their father\\". Background Chris and Cru Kahui were the two survivors of triplets born prematurely at 29 weeks by emergency caesarean section on 20 March 2006 at the National Women's Hospital in Grafton, New Zealand to parents, Christopher Sonny Kahui and Macsyna Pono King. At the time of their birth, King was 29 and her partner Kahui was 21, and they were already the parents of a 13-month-old child son Shane who was born in 2005. Prior to that, King, who was born in South Auckland, had already had three other children in two previous relationships, and met Kahui through his father when she was 27 and he 19. The relationship however, was not always smooth, with a range of risk factors contributing to tension and instability for the couple prior to, and after the arrival of their children. After their birth, the twins spent six weeks at the Kidz First neonatal intensive care unit at Middlemore Hospital. During this time, nurses and social workers at the facility had informally raised concerns with a Department of Child, Youth and Family Services worker, as the parents did not spend a lot of time with the babies. According to the hospital, parents not visiting is not considered child abuse, but was a \\"cause for concern\\". Because the infants were still technically patients of Middlemore Hospital, hospital workers regularly visited the family home. During their last visit to the hospital, Chris and Cru were reported to be healthy and well-fed. However, an autopsy showed that the infants had suffered fractured ribs in an incident prior to the fatal injuries. Deaths On 13 June 2006, King returned to the house after being away overnight partying. She found that the boys suffered extensive bruises, and that their grandfather, William \\"Banjo\\" Kahui, had performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation on them. Police said Banjo was not the only person in the house at the time. According to former MP John Tamihere, members of the Kahui extended family had said \\"a young relative\\" whom they refused to name, was caring for the babies the day they were fatally injured. King and her husband took their children to the family G.P., who ordered immediate hospitalisation for the infants. The Coroner made a finding that Kahui refused to take the children to hospital, running away from the family car and leaving a distraught King carrying two babies in their carriers into the hospital on her own.Report of Coroner released 25 July 2012 Doctors immediately discovered that the infants had serious brain injuries. Both infants had suffered skull fractures from blunt force trauma and Chris had a broken femur. An orthopaedic specialist told The Sunday Star-Times that in order to break the femur of a baby, the bone would have to be deliberately bent at a 90-degree angle, ruling out an accidental cause of the injury. After the infants were transferred to Starship Hospital, hospital workers notified the police. Child, Youth and Family removed Shane and their female cousin Cayenne, aged six months from two rented Housing New Zealand homes ‚Äì one in Clendon, the other in Mangere ‚Äî where the Kahui babies had lived. Police said they were treated in hospital for injuries resulting from \\"neglect\\". They had been found to be malnourished and \\"dirty\\". According to the Herald on Sunday newspaper, the two children were to be returned to the family in September 2006. But neither the parents or so-called \\"Tight 12\\" of family members who persistently refused to cooperate with police, would be their caregivers. The twins were ultimately taken off life support, with Cru being the first to die at 5 a.m. on 18 June. Chris died at 6:45 p.m. later in the day. The bodies were released to the family on 21 June and taken to the Manurewa marae for a tangihanga (funeral rites), and were buried at the Manukau City cemetery on 24 June. Investigation The deaths resulted in an initial serious assault investigation by the New Zealand Police before charges were upgraded to homicide. The police believe that, while the infants were in hospital prior to their deaths, the family was uncooperative with any investigation. Pita Sharples, the co-leader of the MƒÅori Party, said the family had agreed to talk to police on 26 June, but this did not happen. Following the deaths, Sharples said he was disgusted by the Kahui family's behaviour. He claimed some members of the family were more interested in going \\"to the pub and have a drink\\" than coming forward to police. Prime Minister Helen Clark said it was \\"absolutely shocking\\" for the family to hide behind the funeral while everyone in the country was \\"shocked and revolted\\" by the injuries. There were even reports that gang members were threatening the Kahui family in utu (or revenge) over their refusal to speak. After refusing to speak to police in the week after the death, police finally went to family homes on 27 June. At least four family members, including King and an aunt, were escorted to police stations. By 4 July, at least 20 extended family members were questioned, as well as 90 medical practitioners and staff who were in contact with the babies. Forensic scientists removed items such as clothing from the Kahui homes. By September, police said that the family was no longer \\"stone-walling\\" their inquiries, but a prima facie case had yet to be established. Sunday News reported on 17 September that the list of suspects was down to three and an arrest was imminent. This was followed by a police statement nine days later stating that they now knew who was responsible for the deaths. However, other family members could still be charged with related crimes. Two half-sisters of King appeared on TVNZ's Sunday 23 July episode, claiming that King and her brother, Robert King, had told them the name of the killer. TVNZ censored the name when one of the women said it, but the gender was revealed to be male. The infants' paternal grandmother, who appeared the next day on TV3's Campbell Live, contradicted this information, stating that the killer was female. The homes where the babies lived were also home to at least nine adult occupants, eight of whom were on some form of social welfare. They had been receiving payments totalling between $845 and $1395 a week, depending on their age and circumstances. Work and Income New Zealand launched an investigation to see whether all the payments were legitimate. Two instances of substantiated benefit fraud were found for one individual. The Clendon house had been occupied for two to three months, but neighbours had not noticed that babies were living there. According to the neighbours, Tuesday and Thursday nights were \\"party nights,\\" as this was when benefit payments were received. Loud music, foul language and fighting were frequently heard. One neighbour said that a sixteen-year-old female appeared on their doorstep at 3:30 a.m. one morning after she said an older man at the Clendon house attempted to sexually assault her. Murder arrest The edition of 1 October of the Sunday Star- Times newspaper published an interview with Kahui, who said that he did not kill his sons, but if Police could not find anyone else, \\"I go down for something I didn't do\\". Investigators called Kahui's interview with the police on 3 October a \\"major development\\". On 26 October, a \\"carload of detectives\\" had gone to several addresses looking for Kahui, who was brought in for questioning. At 10 p.m., it was announced in a press conference that a 21-year-old man had been arrested and charged with the murder of the infants, and would appear in the Manukau District Court the next day. No other family members faced charges with relation to the deaths. Contrary to this, the Sunday News reported on 31 December 2006 that, according to an unnamed source, a second arrest was expected. Neither the exact charges that would be laid nor the relationship of the person to the infants were revealed. Three weeks later the same newspaper said four people involved in the investigation had been summoned to the appear at the Manukau district court on 24 January. Sources told the newspaper that the new charges relate to dead infants and a pre- school child. One of those to be charged was King, the mother of Chris and Cru. None of these charges eventuated. According to the Herald on Sunday, the Microsoft Word file containing the press release announcing the arrest of Kahui had actually been created five days earlier, and the last edit was the day before the arrest. In the same article, the Herald reported the Police were questioning whether Kahui was actually the biological father of the infants. DNA tests later confirmed that he was the father. Court appearances Kahui appeared in the Number One court of the Manukau District Court on 27 October for a two-minute hearing, where he was formally charged with murder. He was asked not to plead; however, outside the court, Kahui's lawyer, Lorraine Smith, said her client would \\"fight the charges\\". He was remanded in police custody until 10 November when he was freed on bail. A pre- depositions hearing was held 17 January. A second pre-depositions hearing was intended to take place on 21 March. This was so his lawyer could read 60 files of evidence collected by police, and for a medical expert from Australia to become available. This second hearing was delayed because the defence was still waiting for the medical report from Australia. The depositions hearing was finally set for 18 June, with a brief court appearance on 18 April. This date was later changed to sometime on 13 August. Kahui was found not guilty on Thursday 22 May 2008, after only one minute of deliberation by the jury. The officer who led the police investigations into the murders, Detective Inspector John Tims, said he was \\"disappointed\\" at the verdict, finding \\"no evidence to support a charge against any other person and that includes the mother, Macsyna King\\". He acknowledged the prosecutor, who had \\"said in his opening and closing address that there is no new evidence to support a charge being laid against the mother, Macsyna King\\". No charges were laid against King. Kahui's lawyer has threatened to lodge a complaint with the Police Complaints Authority over Police handling of the prosecution of her client for the murder of the twins.  Coroner's report  Coroner Gary Evans released a report into the deaths of the children in July 2012. He found that the twins had suffered the brain injuries which led to their deaths during the afternoon or early evening of 12 June 2006, at a time \\"whilst they were in the sole custody, care and control of their father\\", Kahui. He said there was no evidence or fact to support that injuries being caused by King. Kahui, who gave evidence to the coroner's inquest, attempted to prevent the publication of the report.  Significance  The case highlighted the fact that MƒÅori children are more than twice as likely to die as a result of abuse than non- MƒÅori and that New Zealand ranks fifth highest among OECD nations for child deaths due to maltreatment according to a 2003 UNICEF report. In July 2012, Dr Muriel Newman of the NZ Centre for Political Research commented in an article entitled State culpability: the Kahui twins, that: > It is an indictment of our political system that so many of those in > leadership positions have for decades turned a blind eye to the > fragmentation of the family caused by welfare and other misguided social > policies.

Life Terry Wallis was born on April 7, 1964, in Arkansas to Angilee and Jerry Wallis. Six weeks before his accident, Wallis became a father when his wife Sandi (b. 1968) gave birth to his daughter Amber. Accident Wallis became comatose when he suffered a major automobile accident wherein his pickup truck skidded off a small bridge near Stone County, Arkansas, on July 13, 1984, which resulted in one of his friends being killed. The pickup truck was found upside down in a dry riverbed after Wallis smashed into a railing fence and fell 7.6 meters. He was found to be unresponsive and was immobilized but breathing. The accident left him a quadriplegic in a Mountain View nursing home. Within a year of the accident, the coma stabilized into a minimally conscious state, but doctors believed his condition was permanent. In 2003, Wallis awakened from his minimally conscious state and began talking; when a nurse asked him who the woman walking toward him was, he replied \\"mama\\". He believed that he was still 20 and that it was still 1984. His muscles remained weak, as his family could not afford physiotherapy, but he gradually recovered over a three-day \\"awakening period\\" in which he regained the ability to control some parts of his body and to speak to others. However, he remains disabled from injuries suffered during the original accident, including the motor speech disorder dysarthria. Wallis was the subject of the BodyShock special for 2005 \\"The Man Who Slept For 19 Years\\" made for Channel 4 in the UK.Body and Mind It shows his mother and daughter encouraging him to talk to neurologists to try to find out how Wallis had regained speech after such a long time. The program featured several well- known doctors, including Dr. Caroline McCagg, the medical director of the JFK Center for head injury in New Jersey, Dr. Joe Giacino, a neuropsychologist who said Wallis' brain retained a lot of information from before 1984 but hardly any after 1984 because Wallis lost the ability to store new memories and was essentially amnestic, and Dr. Martin Gizzi, a neurologist who showed that, owing to damage to the frontal lobes, he could not process experiences into memories. Also featured in the program was neuropsychologist Professor Roger Llewellyn Wood. Using new technology, brain scans were done on Wallis by Nicholas Schiff of Weill Cornell Medical College.'Rewired brain' revives patient after 19 years from New Scientist Accessed July 2006 The hypothesis built from the imaging studies is that Wallis' brain reconnected neurons which remained intact and formed new connections to circumvent damaged areas.

The mainstay of the Herpa Wings range is in the 1/500 scale, although models are also produced in the 1/400, 1/200, and 1/1000 scales as well. The Herpa Cars & Trucks range is mainly produced in the 1/87 scale, although 1/120 and 1/160 scales are also offered. Herpa also produces magazines for car & truck enthusiasts and model aircraft enthusiasts, known as Der Ma√üstab and WingsWorld respectively. History 1949 The company ‚ÄúHergenr√∂ther und Patente‚Äù is founded in Nuremberg by inventor and patent holder Wilhelm Hergenr√∂ther to produce accessories for model trains. The initials of the company‚Äôs name make up the short form of ‚ÄúHerpa‚Äù. 1978 Car models in the 1/87 H0 scale are presented at the International Toy Fair in Nuremberg. Herpa continues to extend this product line. Every following car model is put on the market using snap-fit construction (without any necessary gluing). 1980s In 1980, Herpa presents the first truck models. Following that, in 1981, Herpa's truck models sport tipping cabins revealing an exact reproduction of an engine within. Industrial customers also start to use Herpa‚Äôs car models as an advertising instrument with their own company‚Äôs imprinting. The first issue of Der Ma√üstab is released in 1982. Herpa launches the HIGH-TECH series in the 1/87 scale in 1986, with the first model in the series a Ferrari Testarossa consisting of 22 pieces, an opening hood and technical features such as a 12-cylinder motor and wheels with separate suspension. In 1987, the first plastic samples of airplane models of Boeing 747-200s in the 1/500 scale are produced. These models were presented to Lufthansa at an initiation ceremony for a Boeing 737-300 at Nuremberg Airport. Lufthansa then orders the production of the Lufthansa Model-Edition in the 1/200 scale exclusively for the airline. Herpa then launches the Lufthansa Model-Edition in 1988 with a replica of the Boeing 737-300. 1990s In 1992, the Herpa Wings series of airplane models in the 1/500 scale are launched in Nuremberg. These models come with rolling landing gear, an industry first that has not been duplicated. Tamp printing is used to create highly detailed replicas of their originals. Several airlines placed orders with Herpa for the production of airplane models in their respective liveries. In 1993, Herpa creates the first motorcycle in the 1/87 scale. A licensing contract with plane manufacturer Boeing is also signed in 1995. The first set of airport accessories is produced in 1996. Herpa receives the ISO 9001 certificate from the Bavarian Trade and Business Institute for the upholding of a quality management system that meets the highest European norms. In 1997, Herpa Wings magazine WingsWorld was launched, alongside the first model aircraft in the 1/200 scale. The Herpa Wings Club is launched in 1999 in conjunction with Herpa's 50th anniversary. 2000s 2001 marked the start of the retailer initiative Herpa eXtra. The combined online/offline distribution concept was received by fifty initial retailers in various European countries. A Herpa Wings Christmas model was also produced for the first time. In 2004, the first Herpa Wings 1/1000 model was released, and more followed soon after. Also, a DC-3 is flown in company colours at various air- shows across the United States. The DC-3 flown is also available in the Herpa Wings collection in a scale of 1/200. The SCENIX range was also launched in 2006. In 2007, Herpa took on the Minitanks brand and product line of military vehicles from Austrian manufacturer, Roco. Products Herpa Wings Herpa Wings produces model aircraft in scales of 1/200, 1/400, 1/500, 1/600 and 1/1000. Approximately 4,000 different versions of 300 airlines in 19 different aircraft types have been released since its founding in 1992. Many airlines such as Cathay Pacific and Singapore Airlines stock Wings models as part of their on-board duty-free catalogues. These exclusive models are sold by the airlines onboard and aren't available in the regular collection. Herpa Cars & Trucks Herpa Cars & Trucks releases model cars and trucks in the 1/87 H0 scale, but also in the 1/160 and 1/220 scales. Since 1978, 37 different types in 200 liveries have been produced, with many used by industrial customers. Minitanks On October 1, 2007, Herpa took on the worldwide distribution of the Minitanks product line from Austrian manufacturer, Roco (Modelleisenbahn GmbH). This military series has been in production since 1960 and produces vehicles from a variety of eras in both N and H0 scale. SCENIX Although the first SCENIX Mercedes-Benz Actros \\"Black Edition\\" model was already available in December 2005, the SCENIX series was officially launched in 2006. The series is made up of models presented in a PC box that personifies truck models with light and sound. Also, SCENIX comprises Herpa Wings accessories. Entire airport dioramas can be assembled, with many airport accessories also available to supplement these dioramas. Features such as runway lights have also been added in recent times.

However, these magazines are now available via subscription to non-members, with Club members still receiving these magazines as part of their membership. Herpa also releases annual catalogues for the Herpa Wings and Herpa Cars & Trucks collection, which highlight the various products for the year.

Geology About half a million years ago, the Clearwater Valley was filled by a lake backed up by a lava dam near Hemp Creek. White Horse Bluff is a complex volcanic formation that erupted underneath this lake. The outer lava cooled rapidly as it encountered the lake, then water percolated into the still-molten interior of the lava, initiating violent explosions. As the pile of debris grew, dykes fed more lava to the bluff. Subsequent erosion by glaciers and meltwater has exposed these dykes which give the impression that a giant hand has plastered gobs of lava onto the face.Neave, Roland (2015). Exploring Wells Gray Park, 6th edition. Wells Gray Tours, Kamloops, BC. .Goward, Trevor and Hickson, Cathie (1995). Nature Wells Gray, 2nd edition. Lone Pine Publishing, Edmonton, AB. . The Rock Roses are a unique collection of small columns. Unlike most formations of columnar basalt which are vertical like organ pipes, these are horizontal and the ends of the columns point out, rather like the tiles on a shower wall. About further west, the columns suddenly change direction and resemble the wall of a log house. The Rock Roses were formed by the molten lava in the dyke contacting the cooler and older adjoining rocks. Rock Roses Access A trail starts from the Green Mountain Road off the Clearwater Valley Road (also called Wells Gray Park Road). It takes 1.5 hours to hike to the top of White Horse Bluff. White Horse Bluff can be viewed from the Clearwater River Road on the opposite or west bank of the Clearwater River. History The origin of the name, White Horse Bluff, is still debated by Clearwater Valley pioneers, but a First Nations legend about a white horse seems to be the most popular theory. Apparently several horses, including a striking white one, were once pastured beside the Clearwater River near the base of the bluff. In the fall, when the animals were to be moved, the white horse could not be found. In the spring, however, it was found grazing at the top, having somehow climbed up from the river and survived the winter on its own. Mac and Cecile McDiarmid built one of their Clearwater River fishing camps at the foot of the White Horse Bluff in the late 1940s. It was nicknamed \\"The Longhouse\\" because it was long and wide. Only the ruins are left today. Eventually, the McDiarmids operated four cabins or fishing camps along the river and their home base on the Clearwater Valley Road was called Trophies Lodge. Hundreds of guests enjoyed wilderness vacations and the Clearwater's fabulous fishing over a 25-year period starting in 1945. About 1950, a guest at The Longhouse detected a cold draft blowing outward from some cracks near the base of the White Horse Bluff. The McDiarmids excavated a cavity about a meter deep and almost high enough for a standing person. This natural refrigerator kept ice solid even on the hottest of summer days and was a luxury in this remote place. It is still there today and, in September 2014, the temperature at the entrance was measured at 5 degrees Celsius.

It was the Cypriot entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006, where it placed 15th with 57 points. Background and composition The song is a ballad, with Artani asking why difficulties occur in the world. In an interview, Artani explained that angels cry for many reasons and that her song was about finding peace around the world and ending sadness and pain. She pointed to the September 11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center in New York City as the inspiration for the song and revealed that she was supposed to sing at the Windows on the World restaurant on the top floor later that day. Overall, she emphasized that the song symbolized the people who died during the September 11 attacks and also everyone who suffers around the world. Eurovision As Cyprus had finished outside the top ten in their previous Contest appearance, the song was performed in the semi-final. Here it was performed ninth, following Ireland's Brian Kennedy with \\"Every Song Is a Cry for Love\\" and preceding Monaco's S√©verine Ferrer with \\"La Coco-Dance\\". At the close of voting, it had received 57 points, placing 15th in a field of 23 and requiring Cyprus to qualify through the semi-final at their next Contest appearance. Prior to the Contest, opinion was divided on the merits of the song. Many fans argued that it was a low-quality entry, while some described it as a \\"simple, heart-felt song\\". Criticisms were also raised about the line \\"innocent children die\\", with many fans contending that a song with such a pessimistic attitude had no place at the Contest. However other criticisms favored the song as well as Annet's rich vocal talent similar to many other black international music divas.

Located in Community District 12, Rochdale Village is grouped as part of Greater Jamaica, corresponding to the former Town of Jamaica.1891 Map of Queens County, New York It is adjacent to four other Queens neighborhoods: St. Albans to the east, South Jamaica to the west, Locust Manor to the north, and Springfield Gardens to the south across the Belt Parkway. Rochdale is about off the Queens/Nassau border and about north of the John F. Kennedy International Airport. History Jamaica Race Course, Jamaica Racecourse, as seen in a 1903 brochure Rochdale Village was named after the English town of Rochdale, Greater Manchester, where the Rochdale Pioneers developed the Rochdale Principles of cooperation. The architect's concept of Rochdale Village was an attractive community covering 122 blocks that would provide the residents with a park-like setting and facilities of suburbia, within the limits of the Urban Jamaica Area. Rochdale Village was designed to be a \\"city within a city\\" when it was planned beginning in 1939, in order to boost tourism to the surrounding area also including Springfield Gardens, Rosedale, and Laurelton. The property is the former site of Jamaica Race Course, which was the area's only tourist site and was operated by the Metropolitan Jockey Club and its successor, the Greater New York Association (now the New York Racing Association.) When the NYRA decided to renovate Greater Jamaica's other track, Aqueduct Racetrack (in South Ozone Park), it also decided to close Jamaica Race Course when the Aqueduct Racetrack's improvements were finished. Jamaica Race Course was shut down in 1959 and demolished. Rochdale Village was developed under the Mitchell-Lama Housing Program to provide affordable housing for low- and middle-income families. The architect, Herman Jessor, was inspired by the Le Corbusier model. Construction soon proceeded at a rapid pace on the new community in Queens. When Rochdale Village opened, it was the largest private cooperative housing complex in the world until Co-op City in the Bronx was completed in 1971. Rochdale Village was originally between 10 and 20 percent African American and 80 to 90 percent white. This caused controversy before the start of construction, as black people could not participate in Rochdale Village's construction. The Rochdale Village complex was supposed to be the model for mixed-race housing in the U.S., but then became symbolic of the Civil Rights Movement, which was ongoing during the complex's construction; for instance, twenty-three protesters were detained for disrupting the construction in 1961, including William Booth, the future head of mayor John V. Lindsay's Human Rights Commission. About 10% of the units were given to blacks upon the complex's 1963 completion. As the years passed, more and more African Americans moved to Rochdale. It was between the late 1960s and mid-1970s that most white people moved from the community, owing to the white flight brought on by white perceptions of black people as dangerous, fears of lowered property value, and racist real estate practices such a block-busting. Soon, the complex became poorer and unable to provide for some basic utilities throughout the early 1980s, with many apartments remaining empty. However, toward the end of the 20th century, Rochdale Village became 100 percent owner- occupied in order to eliminate rent-stabilized apartments. This was concurrent with the drop in crime citywide. A New York Times article in 1997 went: \\"Under new management, Rochdale has become a preferred residence for middle-class black people. There are only nine vacancies.\\" There are about 25,000 residents in Rochdale Village . Facilities Manicured lawns and pathways around Rochdale Rochdale Village, sometimes called the \\"Jewel of Jamaica\\", is located on a residential park. It consists of 20 buildings in five circular groups. Each 13 story building has three sections: A, B, and C. Each section in each building has its own mailing address. Rochdale Village has its own branch of the Queens Public Library system. A 21 megawatt cogeneration facility generates all the electrical power, heating, air-conditioning, and domestic hot water services for the entire residential development and two shopping malls; the power plant produces its power independently with no connection to any outside utility company. Rochdale Village Department of Public Safety protects the residents, visitors, and property of Rochdale Village. The New York City Police Department's 113th Precinct patrol Rochdale Village and is the primary Policing and investigation agency within the New York City as per the NYC Charter (law), this includes Rochdale Village. Education The schools in the Rochdale Village are P.S. 354, P.S. 80, Catherine and Count Basie Junior High School 72, August Martin High School, The Emerson School, I.S. 8, CCS Montessori, and York College Academy. In 2011, P.S. 30 began being phased out and replaced after years of poor performance; a new school, P.S. 354, opened with kindergarten and first grade, adding a grade per year until P.S. 30 phased out in June 2014. Transportation Rochdale Village and the surrounding neighborhoods are served by transit via the Long Island Rail Road's Atlantic Branch, which stops right by the complex at the Locust Manor station. Rochdale is also served by MTA Regional Bus Operations' QM21, Q3, Q5, Q84 Q85, Q111, and Q113 routes. A New York City Subway extension to the neighborhood was considered in the 1970s and 1980s, but was cut short at Jamaica Center ‚Äì Parsons/Archer due to financial issues.

The short story was first published in the May 6, 1950 issue of Collier's magazine, and was revised and included as a chapter titled \\"August 2026: There Will Come Soft Rains\\" in Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles that was published later that year. The 1997 edition of The Martian Chronicles advanced all dates in the 1950 edition by 31 years, to 2057. The author considered the short story as the only one in The Martian Chronicles as a work of science fiction, and in 1980, identified it as \\"the one story that represents the essence of Ray Bradbury.\\"  Theme  Anti- War Message Ray Bradbury said the drafting of \\"There Will Come Soft Rains\\" was motivated by his fear of the destruction that could result from nuclear war during the Cold War, as the Soviet Union tested its first atomic bomb on August 29, 1949 and the United States' announcement that it was starting development of a hydrogen bomb on January 31, 1950. Bradbury gave the short story the title of Sara Teasdale's anti-war poem \\"There Will Come Soft Rains\\" first published in 1918 during World War I and the 1918 flu pandemic. Like Teasdale's poem, Bradbury's story is devoid of human beings since they have all been killed by war. The story's anti-war message is conveyed by chronicling the horrific results of a nuclear bomb blast, and furthermore, the story's events in The Martian Chronicles version occur on the eve of, and on August 5, 2026 to commemorate August 5, 1945, the date in the United States that the country detonated a nuclear bomb over Hiroshima, Japan during World War II, the first ever attack that used a nuclear weapon. Bradbury's foresight in recognizing the potential for the complete self-destruction of humans by nuclear war in \\"There Will Come Soft Rains\\" was recognized by the Pulitzer Prize Board in conjunction with awarding him a Pulitzer Prize Special Citation in 2007 that noted, \\"While time has (mostly) quelled the likelihood of total annihilation, Bradbury was a lone voice among his contemporaries in contemplating the potentialities of such horrors.\\"  Characters  The House as Protagonist The central object of \\"There Will Come Soft Rains\\" is a highly-automated house that \\"survives\\" destruction of the city around it. The house's automation and automated devices within it are functionally similar to smart home technology that includes the capabilities of intelligent personal assistants. The personification of the actions and reactions of automated devices creates the illusion that the inanimate automated objects are alive, an illusion the author stated is a metaphor,,which enables the house to take the role as the story's protagonist. Consequently, since the living house is only metaphorical, its continued existence is not freed from maintenance all electro-mechanical machines require, and so the house was fated for eventual destruction once all the things needed for its maintenance were destroyed. Nature as an Antagonist A consequence of the house's role as protagonist, is the antagonist role of Nature, in personified actions of wind, tree, and fire acting against what appears as the house's actions to preserve itself that cause the house to metaphorically \\"die.\\" Plot The text for The Martian Chronicles versions of \\"There Will Come Soft Rains\\" are the same except for dates. The differences between the original and The Martial Chronicles stories may seem minor, but some are significant. In particular, the Chronicles version indicates the author's intent on strengthening the anti-war message of the story by commemorating the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and implicitly emphasizing the pacificist sentiments of Sara Teasdale. In addition, the Chronicles version presents a leaner, more refined narrative with the omission of a prologue contained in the original and several changes to sentence structure.  Plot for the The Martian Chronicles versions  The plot for the current edition of \\"August 2057: There Will Come Soft Rains\\" follows. \\"August 2057: There Will Come Soft Rains\\" is about the operation and destruction of an unoccupied, highly automated house in Allendale, California that is the residence of the McClellan family, starting in the waking hours of August 4, 2057 and ending in the morning of the next day. The narrative follows the house operating as if it was occupied, including automated announcements, meal preparation, after-meal clean up, bed preparation, house cleaning, yard maintenance, and entertainment. In particular, the house, during the morning prepares the family for employment and school on a rainy day. The morning routine includes watering an outdoor yard and garden that reveals that a nuclear bomb destroyed the rest of Allendale, and that the explosion singed the western face of the house except in places where objects were directly in front of it. The singed face captured an image of people, presumably members of the McClellan family, unaware of any danger, at the moment they were incinerated by the bomb blast. At noon, the family's dog, suffering from radiation exposure, finds its way into the house and dies moments later, and then its corpse is disposed by the house's cleaning systems two hours later. The afternoon routine includes setting up an outdoor patio for a bridge game and animating, using film projectors, a nursery to entertain children. The evening routine includes the house's automation asking Mrs. McClellan whether she would like to hear a poem, and upon receiving no response, recites \\"There Will Come Soft Rains\\" by Sara Teasdale, who is noted by the entertainment system as Mrs. McClellan's favorite poet. After ten o'clock at night, a wind-blown tree branch crashes through the kitchen window and causes cleaning solvent to spill over the stove and ignite. The fire spreads and the house's automated systems try to fight and contain it while other automated systems start to malfunction. The automated efforts fail to stop the fire and by the following morning, the house is a collapsed, smoldering ruin, except for a single wall that contains the announcement system which continues to operate, though defectively, endlessly repeating, \\"Today is August 5, 2057\\", ending the story.  Plot differences between the original publication in Colliers magazine  This section provides a list of significant differences between the original and the Chronicles versions of the short story. * The original story's events occur on April 28 and April 29, 1985, compared to August 4 and August 5, 2057 in The Martian Chronicles. The change in dates reflects Bradbury's shift to commemorate the date for the atomic bombing of Hiroshima during World War II rather than to have events occur during Spring consistent with Teasdale's poem. * The original story begins with a two paragraph prologue that was omitted from the Chonicles version. The first paragraph notes that the house was built in 1980, that it was like many other houses built that year, and that it was occupied by the nuclear four-member McClellan family, who \\"lived happily even while the world trembled.\\" The single sentence second paragraph mentions \\"the happy time was over\\" for the McClellans by describing the advent of a nuclear war that occurs on a date that is not mentioned. * The Chonicles version includes the opening of a garage door at 8:01am to allow the departure of the automobile inside. * The dog enters the house at 10:15am in the original version and at noon in the Chonicles version. The dog's corpse is removed starting at 1:00pm in the original version and at 2:00pm in the Chonicles version. * The original story does not include the 4:30pm animation of the nursey to entertain children present in the Chronicles version. * For the recitation of Teasdale's poem, the original version mentions Teasdale as \\"a favorite\\" poet of Mrs. McClellan, while the Chronicles version mentions Teasdale as her \\"favorite\\" poet. The Chronicles version emphasizes Mrs. McClellan's familiarity with Teasdale's works. Adaptations * In 1950, an adaptation was broadcast as the 11th episode of Dimension X, a science-fiction radio program. * In 1953, an adaptation of the story was published in issue 17 of the comic book Weird Fantasy, with art by Wally Wood. * In 1956, the story was made into a radio play for the X Minus One series. * In 1962, actor Burgess Meredith recorded this story, which was released on LP by Prestige Lively Arts (30004), along with \\"Marionettes, Inc.\\", also by Bradbury. * In 1975, actor Leonard Nimoy's rendition of this story and Ray Bradbury's Usher II, also from The Martian Chronicles, were released on Caedmon Records. * In 1977, August the Fourth, 2026: There Will Come Soft Rains was released. It used the resources of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop under the direction of Malcolm Clarke. * In 1984, Soviet studio Uzbekfilm produced \\"There Will Come Soft Rains\\" as a short animated film. (ru) * In 1992, Lebbeus Woods adapted the story to the third issue of the comic book series Ray Bradbury Chronicles. * In 2008, the post-apocalyptic game Fallout 3, which takes place in the irradiated remnants of Washington, DC, featured a robot in a house in Georgetown which, upon entering a command in a terminal in the house, would hover in the bedroom of the occupant's children and recite the poem for which this story is named. * In 2015, shortly after Leonard Nimoy's death, the concept album Soft Rains was released featuring Nimoy's 1975 reading, set to music by producer Carwyn Ellis under the pseudonym Zarelli.

He is believed to have been a native of Rhaetia (modern day Northern Italy). Veneration His name is in the Roman Martyrology on 25 June, and the city of Turin honors him as its patron saint. A life which, however, is entirely unreliable, was written after the 11th century, and is printed in the Acta Sanctorum, June, VII, 3rd ed., 44-46. It states that a cleric one day followed Maximus with an evil intention to a retired chapel where he often prayed. The cleric suddenly became so thirsty that he implored Maximus for help. A roe deer happened to pass which the saint caused to stop, so that the cleric could partake of its milk. This legend accounts for the fact that Maximus is represented in art as pointing at a roe deer. Works Maximus is the author of numerous discourses, first edited by Bruno Bruni, and published by order of Pope Pius VI at the Propaganda in 1784 (reprinted in P.L., LVII). These discourses, delivered to the people by the saint, consist of one hundred and eighteen homilies, one hundred and sixteen sermons, and six treatises (tractatus). However, a new edition is published in the collection Corpus Christianorum Series Latina by Almut Mutzenbecher (n¬∞ XXIII, Turnhout 1962) which has accurately identified the corpus to be attributed to Maximus I of Turin. This is currently the best edition of Maximus' sermons (see this edition for more information on content and datation of each sermon). According to the edition of Bruni,Homilies 1-63 are de tempore, i.e. on the seasons of the ecclesiastical year and on the feasts of Our Lord; 64-82, de sanctis, i.e. on the saints whose feast was commemorated on the day on which they were delivered; 83-118, de diversis, i.e. exegetical, dogmatical or moral. Sermons 1-55 are de tempore; 56-93, de sanctis; 93-116, de diversis. Three of the treatises are on baptism (but, now to be attributed to an anonym author of northern Italy, see Anonimo Veronese, Omelie mistagogiche e catechetiche, edizione critica e studio a cura di Giuseppe Sobrero, Rome, 1992), one against the Pagans, and one against the Jews. The last two are extant only in fragments, and their genuineness is doubtful. The sixth treatise, whose genuineness is also doubtful, contains short discourses on twenty-three topics taken from the Four Gospels. An appendix contains writings of uncertain authorship: thirty-one sermons, three homilies, and two long epistles addressed to a sick friend. Many writings, however, which Bruni ascribes to Maximus are of doubtful origin. The discourses are usually very brief, and couched in forcible, though at times over flowery language. Among the many facts of liturgy and history touched on in the discourses are: abstinence during Lent (hom. 44), no fasting or kneeling at prayers during paschal time (hom. 61), fasting on the Vigil of Pentecost (hom. 62), the synod of Milan in 389 at which Jovinianus was condemned (hom. 9), the impending barbarian invasion (hom. 86-92), the destruction of the Church of Milan by the barbarians (hom. 94), various pagan superstitions still prevalent at his time (hom. 16, 100-02), the supremacy of St. Peter (hom. 54, 70, 72, serm. 114).

China has emerged as a major producer and consumer, as has India to a lesser extent. Consolidation has been rapid in Europe. Growth of the industry Global steel production grew enormously in the 20th century from a mere 28 million tonnes at the beginning of the century to 781 million tons at the end.Appendix 1 Per-capita steel consumption in the US peaked in 1977, then fell by half before staging a modest recovery to levels well below the peak. World steel production in the 20th century Bethlehem Steel in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania (Closed in 2003) was one of the world's largest manufacturers of steel. Production of crude steel has risen at an astounding rate, reaching 1,691 m tonnes by 2017 During the 20th century, the consumption of steel increased at an average annual rate of 3.3%. In 1900, the United States was producing 37% of the world's steel, but With post war industrial development in Asia and centralised investment by China, by 2017 China alone accounted for 50%, with Europe (including the former Soviet Union) down to 24% and North America down to 6%. For details of country-wise steel production see steel production by country. Growth potential of the industry Amongst the other newly steel-producing countries, in 2017 South Korea produces 71 million tonnes, nearly double Germany; and Brazil 34 million tonnes; all three countries little changed since 2011. Indian production in 2017 production is just over 100 million tonnes; up substantially from 70 in 2011 ‚Äì compared to only 1 million tonnes at the time of its independence in 1947. By 1991, when the economy was opened up steel production grew to around 14 million tonnes. Thereafter, it doubled in the next 10 years, and then it is doubling again, maybe over a slightly longer span. The world steel industry flattened from 2007‚Äì2009 at 1,300 million tonnes, before rising again, due to worldwide recession starting in 2008, with its heavy cutbacks in construction, sharply lowered demand and prices falling 40%. Showing the impact of that plateau, in 2007 ThyssenKrupp spent $12 billion to build the two most modern mills in the world, situated in Alabama and Brazil. They lost $11 billion on the new plants, which sold steel below the cost of production. Finally in 2013, the plants were sold at under $4 billion. Reduction in workforce A modern steel plant employs very few people per tonne, compared to the past. In South Korea, Posco employs 29,648 people to produce 28 million tonnes. During the period 1974 to 1999, the steel industry had drastically reduced employment all around the world. In USA, it was down from 521,000 to 153,000. In Japan, from 459,000 to 208,000; Germany from 232,000 to 78,000; UK from 197,000 to 31,000; Brazil from 118,000 to 59,000; South Africa from 100,000 to 54,000. South Korea already had a low figure. It was only 58,000 in 1999. The steel industry had reduced its employment around the world by more than 1,500,000 in 25 years.

The kingdoms were founded when warriors from the Mamprusi area, in modern-day Ghana moved into the area and intermarried with local people. Centralization of the political and military powers of the kingdoms begin in the 13th century and led to conflicts between the Mossi kingdoms and many of the other powerful states in the region. In 1896, the French took over the kingdoms and created the French Upper Volta which largely used the Mossi administrative structure for many decades in governing the colony. Origin Accounts of the origin of the Mossi kingdom and parts of their history are very imprecise with contradictory oral traditions that disagree on significant aspects of the story. The origin story is unique in that a woman plays a key role as the progenitor of the royal line. The origins of the Mossi state are claimed by one prominent oral tradition to come from when a Mamprusi princess left the city of Gambaga because of a dispute with her father. This event dates in different oral histories to be anytime between the 11th and the 15th centuries. According to the story, the princess Yennega escaped dressed as a man when she came to the house of an elephant hunter from the Boussansi tribe named Ryall√©. He initially believed she was a man but one day she revealed that she was a woman and the two married. They had a son named Wedraogo or Ou√©draogo who was given that name from the horse that Niennega escaped from Gambaga on. Wedraogo visited his grandfather in Dagomba at the age of fifteen and was given four horses, 50 cows, and a number of Dagomba horseman joined his forces. With these forces, Wedraogo conquered the Boussansi tribes, married a woman named Pouiriketa who gave him three sons, and built the city of Tenkodogo. The oldest was Diaba Lompo who founded the city of Fada N'gourma. The second son, Rawa, became the ruler of Zondoma Province. His third son, Zoungrana became the ruler in Tenkodogo after Wedraogo died. Zoungrana married Pouitenga, a woman sent from the chief of the Ninisi tribes, and the resulting intermarriage between the Dagomba, the Boussansi, and the Ninisi produced a new tribe called the Mossi. Zoungrana and Pouitenga had a son, Oubri, who further expanded the kingdom by conquering the Kibissi and some Gurunsi tribes. Oubri, who ruled from around 1050 until 1090 CE, is often considered the founder of the Ouagadougou dynasty which ruled from the capital of Ouagadougou. Rise and centralization The cavalry of the Mossi states were experts at raiding deep into enemy territory, even against the formidable Mali Empire. Image: Boukary Koutou, also known as Wobgho, Mossi King of Ouagadougou with his cavalry escort, Burkina Faso, 1892. Following Oubri, centralization and small-scale expansion of the kingdoms were the primary tasks. The Ouagadougou dynasty retained control in Ouagadougou, but the other kingdoms established by the sons of Wedraogo retained independence in Tenkodogo, Fada N'gourma, and Zondoma. Under the fifth ruler, Komdimie (circa 1170), two revolutions were started by members of the Ouagadougou dynasty with the establishment of the Kingdom of Yatenga to the north and the establishment of the Kingdom of Rizim. War between Komdimie and Yatenga lasted for many years with Yatenga eventually taking over the independent Mossi state of Zondoma. At the same time, Komdimie created a new level of authority for his sons as Dimas of separate provinces with some autonomy but recognizing the sovereignty of the Ouagadougou dynasty. This system of taking over territory and appointing sons as Dimas would last for many of the future rulers. Increasing power of the Mossi kingdoms resulted in larger conflicts with regional powers. The Kingdom of Yatenga became a key power attacking the Songhai Empire between 1328 and 1477 taking over Timbuktu and sacked the important trading post of Macina. When Askia Mohammad I became the leader of the Songhai Empire with the desire to spread Islam, he waged a holy war against the Mossi kingdoms in 1497. Although the Mossi forces were defeated in this effort, they resisted attempts to impose Islam. With the conquest of the Songhai by the Moroccans of the Saadi dynasty in 1591, the Mossi states reestablished their independence. By the 18th century, the Mossi kingdoms had increased significantly in terms of economic and military power in the region. Foreign trade relations increased significantly throughout Africa with significant connections to the Fula kingdoms and the Mali Empire. These relations included military attacks on many times with the Mossi being attacked by a variety of African forces. Although there were a number of jihad states in the region trying to forcibly spread Islam, namely the Massina Empire and the Sokoto Caliphate, the Mossi kingdoms largely retained their traditional religious and ritual practices. Domestically, the Mossi kingdoms distinguished between the nakombse and the tengbiise. The nakombse claimed lineage connections to the founders of the Mossi kingdoms and the power of naam which gave them the divine right to rule. The tengbiise, in contrast, were considered the people who lived in the region who became assimilated into the kingdoms and would never get access to naam. However, because of their connection to the area they do have tenga which allows them to decide over issues related to land. The rulers' naam and the support of tenga were connected in a two-way dimension of power in society. Religion Being located near many of the main Islamic states of West Africa, the Mossi kingdoms developed a mixed religious system recognizing some authority for Islam while retaining earlier ancestor-focused religious worship. The king participated in two great festivals, one focused on the genealogy of the royal lineage (in order to increase their naam) and another of sacrifices to tenga. In addition, although they had initially resisted Islamic imposition and retained independence from the main Islamic states of West Africa, there began to be a sizable number of Muslims living in the kingdom. In Ouagadougou, the king assigned an Imam who was allowed to deliver readings of the Qur'an to the royalty in exchange for recognizing the genealogical power of the king. French conquest The first European explorer to enter the empire was German Gottlob Krause in 1888. This was followed by a British expedition in 1894 led by George Ekem Ferguson who convinced the Mossi leaders to sign a treaty of protection. Despite this, the French entered the area in 1896 and renounced the treaty of protection to conquer the Mossi Kingdom and make it part of the Upper Volta colony. The French had already conquered or taken over all of the surrounding kingdoms which trapped the Mossi kingdoms. The last king of Ouagadougou, named Wobgo or Wobogoo, was warned a day before the French forces were going to attack the city and so sent a small force to meet them in battle as he fled the city. The French fired four shots in the air which caused the Mossi force to scatter, but Wobgo was able to escape capture. The French made Wobgo's brother, Kouka, the king of Ouagadougou and allied with Yatenga to try and capture Wobgo. When the French and British agreed on the boundary between their colonies, Wobgo lost his main support system and retired with a British pension in Zongoiri in the Gold Coast where he died in 1904. As a result of the significant centralization of the kingdoms, the French largely kept the administration making the Moro-naba in Ouagadougou the primary leader of the region and creating five ministers under him that governed different regions (largely adhering to the Mossi kingdom borders). Organization The Mossi kingdoms were organized around five different kingdoms: Ouagadougou, Tenkodogo, Fada N'gourma, and Zondoma (later replaced by Yatenga) and Boussouma. However, there were as many as 19 additional lesser Mossi kingdoms which retained connection to one of the four main kingdoms. Each of these retained significant domestic autonomy and independence but shared kinship, military, and ritualistic bonds with one another. Each kingdom had similar domestic structures with kings, ministers, and other officials and a high degree of centralization of administrative functions. There were prominent rivalries between the different kingdoms, namely between Yatenga and Ouagadougou. Ouagadougou was often considered the primary Mossi kingdom ruled by Moro Naba, but was not the capital of the Mossi kingdoms as each retained autonomy.

It was published by Interplay in 1999. The objective of the game is to progress through four time periods, building and controlling tanks from that period to fight the \\"evil black tanks\\" from a more advanced period. Tanks are constructed by hand out of parts, which are randomly constructed by a factory (the \\"Part-o-Matic\\") in the player's base when it is provided with resources. Different parts may offer the ability to cross different terrain, offensive capabilities more suitable to current tactics, and so forth. The player's primary control is \\"the crane\\", a flying magnet (held by, for example, a pterodactyl in the first, ancient time period) which can pick up and drop single parts. A suitable pile of parts becomes a tank, which can be selected and ordered to move by the magnet. The game also has a strong puzzle element. The magnet can also pick up boulders (e.g. for blocking off enemy routes) and sheep (which can be used to increase the factory's production rate, amongst other things), and there are various terrain types with lasting effects. For example, driving a tank through mud will make it dirty, causing them to move more slowly until washed. Some maps have buttons on them which can only be activated by tanks with sufficient combat experience, and it can take considerable foresight to ensure that a tank will be able to survive to that level and be able to reach the button. Dissassembling a tank will make it lose all experience. The game is very micromanagement heavy, requiring the player to spread attention thinly over maintaining the continually tiring sheep at the factory, tank battles, negotiation of terrain hazards such as quicksand, and tank construction. Gameplay Basics There are four worlds in campaign mode: Stone Age, Medieval, Modern, and Futuristic, each containing six levels. The enemy is always one world in technology above the player's team, the final one being the \\"Evil Black Tanks\\" themselves. There are also a challenge and training mode, the challenge consisting of tasks such as killing certain tanks with boulders, crushing black sheep to defending the base, and reassembling tanks. The Part-O-Matic is the only structure in the game controlled by the player. It produces a set of parts, determined by the level, one by one. The speed is determined by the number of sheep on its wheel. Sheep are found randomly grazing and can be picked up by the player's crane and dropped on the player's Part-O-Matic's wheel. After an allotted amount of time, sheep will grow tired and need to be restored in the sheep dip found throughout the level, there is commonly one beside the main HQ. Once they have rested, they may be put back on the wheel. Black sheep spread their disease to other sheep, rendering them useless. Once a sheep has been infected, the player may put it in the green goo where it heals. However, once it turns completely black, there is no way to restore it to its previous state. The only way to stop the sheep from getting infected is to kill the black sheep with a boulder to the head. Sheep are fragile, and can be killed by enemies or by accident. Sacrificing parts to the Part-O-Matic, such as enemy tank pieces, sheep, boulders, or crates, allows the Part-O-Matic to constantly reproduce from the pre-determined queue randomly set up in-game. Crates, as the main resource, are found all over the place and can be carried by tanks and returned to the Part-O-Matic. One tank can hold 4 crates and sometimes crates can be difficult to get a hold of, so the default template is a lot of powerful weapons on a 4-exhaust engine placed on water-tracks. There are four main parts to make tanks in the game. The track determines what areas of terrain the tank can cross. These included wheels, tracks which can only cross basic terrain, such as stone, half-tracks, tracks which can cross desert, snow-mobiles, tracks which can cross over snow, boats, which can cross over water, and hover-crafts, tracks which can cross over anything without suffering the effects of the ground. Making tanks without tracks renders them immobile, similar to turrets. The engine determined not only how fast the tank can go, but how many weapons an individual tank can possess. Weapons weighed down a tank and made it slower, in effect a tank with a total of five engine power and three weapons would travel the same speed as a tank with a total engine power of two and no weapons. The weapons automatically shoots at enemies within its range. The player can place as many weapons in a tank as it has engine power, and can not exceed a fixed height limit. The player can also order tanks to attack a specific tank or area of terrain. There are over sixty weapons in-game throughout the five time periods. Finally, the radar only comes in one variety, and is needed to make the tank function. Power-ups are collected both by being made by the Part-O-Matic and unlocked by buttons requiring a certain experience level of the tank that touches it. These buttons may also unlock certain areas or parts necessary to winning the game. Furthermore, there are boulders, movable by crane, which can be used as a Part-O-Matic resource, weapons, or walls from enemy tanks. Terrain There are four main types of terrain: Ground, which can be crossed by any track and can be composed of stone, grass, dirt, etc., and Snow, Desert, and Water, only crossable by their counterpart tracks. In addition, there are quicksand, which sinks tanks' tracks and any dropped objects, mud puddles, which cause tank tracks to get muddy and slow down until cleaned, lava, which burns anything that touches it until put out by water or waiting, acid, which hurts anything that touches it until taken off, and sheep-dip, a green goo which energizes sheep and cleans off parts. Combat In combat, each part has its own health. If the health reaches zero, the part will fly off the tank, destroyed. If the tracks are destroyed, all but one engine will fall off and the tank will become immobile. If an engine is destroyed, and the remaining engines can't support the number of weapons being used, weapons will fall off until the number of weapons matches the total engine power. If the radar is destroyed or the final engine is lost, the tank will cease to function, and lose all of its experience. The tank, unless ordered otherwise, will attack the closest enemy in range of its farthest weapon. If the tank is ordered to attack a specific enemy that is out of range of some weapons, the others will attack the closest enemy within range. Enemies will obey the same rules, except when attacking the Part-O-Matic. The destination of all enemies spawned after the start of the game is the Part-O-Matic. When attacking the Part-O- Matic, enemies will ignore their surroundings. Enemies spawn at receiver points and move to the Part-O-Matic. Objectives The main objective in campaign mode is to eliminate all enemy spawn points by first unlocking them by pressing buttons with certain level requirements, and then attacking the now exposed vulnerable center. Once all spawn points have been destroyed, all remaining tanks including those guarding points of interest will move in to attack. Once all enemy tanks have been destroyed, the player wins and completes the level. If the Part-O-Matic is destroyed, the player loses. However, in the last level of each of the four worlds, the objective is to capture a transmitter from the enemy \\"Evil Black Tanks\\" that guard them, and return it to the base.

The two ships‚ÄîAndrea Doria and Caio Duilio‚Äîwere completed during World War I. The class was an incremental improvement over the preceding . Like the earlier ships, Andrea Doria and Caio Duilio were armed with a main battery of thirteen guns. The two ships were based in southern Italy during World War I to help ensure that the Austro- Hungarian Navy's surface fleet would be contained in the Adriatic. Neither vessel saw any combat during the conflict. After the war, they cruised the Mediterranean and were involved in several international incidents, including at Corfu in 1923. In 1933, both ships were placed in reserve. In 1937 the ships began a lengthy reconstruction. The modifications included removing their center main battery turret and boring out the rest of the guns to , strengthening their armor protection, installing new boilers and steam turbines, and lengthening their hulls. The reconstruction work lasted until 1940, by which time Italy was already engaged in World War II. The two ships were moored in Taranto on the night of 11/12 November 1940 when the British launched a carrier strike on the Italian fleet. In the resulting Battle of Taranto, Caio Duilio was hit by a torpedo and forced to beach to avoid sinking. Andrea Doria was undamaged in the raid; repairs for Caio Duilio lasted until May 1941. Both ships escorted convoys to North Africa in late 1941, including Operation M42, where Andrea Doria saw action at the inconclusive First Battle of Sirte on 17 December. Fuel shortages curtailed further activities in 1942 and 1943, and both ships were interned at Malta following Italy's surrender in September 1943. Italy was permitted to retain both battleships after the war, and they alternated as fleet flagship until the early 1950s, when they were removed from active service. Both ships were scrapped after 1956. Design and description Right elevation and deck plan as depicted in Brassey's Naval Annual 1923 The Andrea Doria-class ships were designed by naval architect Vice Admiral (Generale del Genio navale) Giuseppe Valsecchi and were ordered in response to French plans to build the s. The design of the preceding s was generally satisfactory and was adopted with some minor changes. These mostly concerned the reduction of the superstructure by shortening the forecastle deck, the consequent lowering of the amidships gun turret and the upgrading of the secondary armament to sixteen guns in lieu of the eighteen guns of the older ships.Giorgerini, p. 278 General characteristics The ships of the Andrea Doria class were long at the waterline, and overall. They had a beam of , and a draft of . They displaced at normal load, and at deep load.Gardiner & Gray, p. 260 They were provided with a complete double bottom and their hulls were subdivided by 23 longitudinal and transverse bulkheads. The ships had two rudders, both on the centerline. They had a crew of 31 officers and 969 enlisted men.Giorgerini, pp. 270, 272 Propulsion The ships were fitted with three Parsons steam turbine sets, arranged in three engine rooms. The center engine room housed one set of turbines that drove the two inner propeller shafts. It was flanked by compartments on either side, each housing one turbine set powering the outer shafts. Steam for the turbines was provided by 20 Yarrow boilers, 8 of which burned oil and 12 of which burned coal sprayed with oil. Designed to reach a maximum speed of from , neither of the ships reached this goal on their sea trials, only achieving speeds of . The ships could store a maximum of of coal and of fuel oil that gave them a range of at .Giorgerini, pp. 272‚Äì73, 278 Armament As built, the ships' main armament comprised thirteen 46-caliber 305-millimeter guns,Preston, p. 179 designed by Armstrong Whitworth and Vickers,Friedman, p. 234 in five gun turrets. The turrets were all on the centerline, with a twin-gun turret superfiring over a triple-gun turret in fore and aft pairs, and a third triple turret amidships, designated 'A', 'B', 'Q', 'X', and 'Y' from front to rear. The turrets had an elevation capability of ‚àí5 to +20 degrees and the ships could carry 88 rounds for each gun. Sources disagree regarding these guns' performance, but naval historian Giorgio Giorgerini says that they fired armor-piercing (AP) projectiles at the rate of one round per minute and that they had a muzzle velocity of , which gave a maximum range of .Giorgerini, pp. 268, 276, 278 The secondary armament on the two ships consisted of sixteen 45-caliber guns, also designed by Armstrong Whitworth,Friedman, p. 240 mounted in casemates on the sides of the hull underneath the main guns. Their positions tended to be wet in heavy seas, especially the rear guns. These guns could depress to ‚àí5 degrees and had a maximum elevation of +20 degrees; they had a rate of fire of six shots per minute. They could fire a high-explosive projectile with a muzzle velocity of to a maximum distance of . The ships carried 3,440 rounds for them. For defense against torpedo boats, the ships carried nineteen 50-caliber guns; they could be mounted in 39 different positions, including on the turret roofs and upper decks. These guns had the same range of elevation as the secondary guns, and their rate of fire was higher at 10 rounds per minute. They fired a AP projectile with a muzzle velocity of to a maximum distance of . The ships were also fitted with three submerged torpedo tubes, one on each broadside and the third in the stern.Giorgerini, pp. 268, 277‚Äì78 Armor The Andrea Doria-class ships had a complete waterline armor belt with a maximum thickness of that reduced to towards the stern and towards the bow.Whitley, p. 162 Above the main belt was a strake of armor thick that extended up to the lower edge of the main deck. Above this strake was a thinner one, 130 millimeters thick, that protected the casemates. The ships had two armored decks: the main deck was thick in two layers on the flat that increased to on the slopes that connected it to the main belt. The second deck was thick, also in two layers. Fore and aft transverse bulkheads connected the belt to the decks.Giorgerini, p. 271 The frontal protection of the gun turrets was in thickness with thick sides, and an roof and rear. Their barbettes had armor above the deck that reduced to between the forecastle and upper decks and 130 millimeters below the upper deck. The forward conning tower had walls thick; those of the aft conning tower were thick. Modifications and reconstruction Caio Duilio in 1943 During World War I, a pair of 50-caliber 76-millimeter guns on high-angle mounts were fitted as anti-aircraft (AA) guns, one gun at the bow and the other on top of 'X' turret. In 1925 the number of low-angle 50-caliber 76-millimeter guns was reduced to 13, all mounted on the turret tops, and six new 40-caliber 76-millimeter guns were installed abreast the aft funnel. Two license-built 2-pounder AA guns were also fitted. In 1926 the rangefinders were upgraded and a fixed aircraft catapult was mounted on the port side of the forecastle for a Macchi M.18 seaplane.Whitley, p. 164 By the early 1930s, the Regia Marina had begun design work on the new s, but it recognized that they would not be complete for some time. As a stop-gap measure in response to the new French s, the navy decided to modernize its old battleships; work on the two surviving Conte di Cavours began in 1933 and the two Andrea Dorias followed in 1937.Garzke & Dulin, p. 379 The work lasted until July 1940 for Duilio and October 1940 for Andrea Doria. The existing bow was dismantled and a new, longer, bow section was built, which increased their overall length by to (on the Cavour-class the new bow had been grafted over the existing one, instead). Their beam increased to Whitley, pp. 162, 164 and their draft at deep load increased to .Brescia, p. 62 The changes made during their reconstruction increased their displacement to for Andrea Doria and for Duilio at deep load. The ships' crews increased to 70 officers and 1,450 enlisted men. Two of the propeller shafts were removed and the existing turbines were replaced by two sets of Belluzzo geared steam turbines rated at . The boilers were replaced by eight superheated Yarrow boilers. On their sea trials the ships reached a speed of , although their maximum speed was about in service. The ships now carried of fuel oil, which provided them with a range of at a speed of . The center turret and the torpedo tubes were removed and all of the existing secondary armament and AA guns were replaced by a dozen guns in four triple-gun turrets and ten AA guns in single turrets. In addition the ships were fitted with fifteen 54-caliber Breda light AA guns in six twin-gun and three single mounts and sixteen Breda Model 35 AA guns, also in twin mounts. The 305-millimeter guns were bored out to 320 millimeters (12.6 in) and their turrets were modified to use electric power. They had a fixed loading angle of +12 degrees, but there is uncertainty on their new maximum elevation, with some sources citing a maximum value of +27 degrees,Whitley, pp. 158, 164‚Äì65 while others claim one of +30 degrees.Campbell, p. 324 The 320-millimeter AP shells weighed and had a maximum range of with a muzzle velocity of .Campbell, p. 322 In early 1942 the rearmost 20-millimeter mounts were replaced by twin 37-millimeter gun mounts and the 20-millimeter guns were moved to the roof of Turret 'B', while the RPC motors from the stabilized mounts of the 90 mm guns were removed.Whitley, p. 165Campbell, p. 343 The forward superstructure was rebuilt with a new forward conning tower, protected with thick armor. Atop the conning tower there was a fire-control director fitted with three large rangefinders. The deck armor was increased during reconstruction to a total of . The armor protecting the secondary turrets was thick. The existing underwater protection was replaced by the Pugliese system that consisted of a large cylinder surrounded by fuel oil or water that was intended to absorb the blast of a torpedo warhead.Whitley, p. 158 These modernizations have been criticized by some naval historians because these ships would eventually prove to be inferior to the British battleships they were meant to face (namely the , since by the time the decision to proceed was taken a war between Italy and the United Kingdom seemed more likely). In addition, the cost of the reconstruction would be not much less than the cost of building a brand new Littorio-class battleship; moreover, the reconstruction work caused bottlenecks in the providing of steel plates, that caused substantial delays in the construction of the modern battleships, which otherwise might have been completed at an earlier date.

Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that Austro-Hungarian submarines and minelayers could operate effectively in the narrow waters of the Adriatic.Halpern, p. 150 The threat from these underwater weapons to his capital ships was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way. Instead, Revel decided to implement a blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the battle fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS torpedo boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations. Meanwhile, Revel's battleships would be preserved to confront the Austro-Hungarian battle fleet in the event that it sought a decisive engagement.Halpern, pp. 141‚Äì42 Andrea Doria and Caio Duilio both cruised in the eastern Mediterranean after the war, and both were involved in postwar disputes over control of various cities. Caio Duilio was sent to provide a show of force during a dispute over control of ƒ∞zmir in April 1919 and Andrea Doria assisted in the suppression of Gabriele D'Annunzio's seizure of Fiume in November 1920. Caio Duilio cruised the Black Sea after the ƒ∞zmir affair until she was replaced in 1920 by the battleship Giulio Cesare. Andrea Doria and Caio Duilio were present during the Corfu incident in 1923. In January 1925, Andrea Doria visited Lisbon, Portugal, to represent Italy during the celebration marking the 400th anniversary of the death of explorer Vasco da Gama. The two ships performed the normal routine of peacetime cruises and goodwill visits throughout the 1920s and early 1930s; both were placed in reserve in 1933.Whitley, pp. 165‚Äì67 Both Andrea Doria and Caio Duilio went into drydock in the late 1930s for extensive modernizations; this work lasted until October and April 1940, respectively. By that time, Italy had entered World War II on the side of the Axis powers. The two ships joined the 5th Division based at Taranto. Caio Duilio participated in a patrol intended to catch the British battleship and a convoy bound for Malta, but neither target was found. She and Andrea Doria were present during the British attack on Taranto on the night of 11/12 November 1940. A force of twenty-one Fairey Swordfish torpedo-bombers, launched from , attacked the ships moored in the harbor. Andrea Doria was undamaged in the raid, but Caio Duilio was hit by a torpedo on her starboard side. She was grounded to prevent her from sinking in the harbor and temporary repairs were effected to allow her to travel to Genoa for permanent repairs, which began in January 1941.Whitley, pp. 166‚Äì68Rohwer, p. 47 In February, she was attacked by the British Force H; several warships attempted to shell Caio Duilio while she was in dock, but they scored no hits.Ireland, p. 64 Repair work lasted until May 1941, when she rejoined the fleet at Taranto.Whitley, p. 166 Caio Duilio in 1948 In the meantime, Andrea Doria participated in several operations intended to catch British convoys in the Mediterranean, including the Operation Excess convoys in January 1941. By the end of the year, both battleships were tasked with escorting convoys from Italy to North Africa to support the Italian and German forces fighting there. These convoys included Operation M41 on 13 December and Operation M42 on 17‚Äì19 December. During the latter, Andrea Doria and Giulio Cesare engaged British cruisers and destroyers in the First Battle of Sirte on the first day of the operation. Neither the Italians nor the British pressed their attacks and the battle ended inconclusively. Caio Duilio was assigned to distant support for the operation, and was too far away to actively participate in the battle. Convoy escort work continued into early 1942, but thereafter the fleet began to suffer from a severe shortage of fuel, which kept the ships in port for the next two years. Caio Duilio sailed away from Taranto on 14 February with a pair of light cruisers and seven destroyers in order to intercept the British convoy MW 9, bounded from Alexandria to Malta, but the force could not locate the British ships, and so returned to port. After learning of Caio Duilio departure, however, British escorts scuttled the transport Rowallan Castle, previously disabled by German aircraft.Woodman, pp. 285‚Äì286 Both ships were interned at Malta following Italy's surrender on 3 September 1943. They remained there until 1944, when the Allies allowed them to return to Italian ports; Andrea Doria went to Syracuse, Sicily, and Caio Duilio returned to Taranto before joining her sister at Syracuse. Italy was allowed to retain the two ships after the end of the war, and they alternated in the role of fleet flagship until 1953, when they were both removed from service. Andrea Doria carried on as a gunnery training ship, but Caio Duilio was placed in reserve. Both battleships were stricken from the naval register in September 1956 and were subsequently broken up for scrap.Whitley, pp. 167‚Äì68Gardiner & Chesneau, p. 284 Notes Footnotes References        Further reading   External links * Category:Battleship classes Category:World War I battleships of Italy Category:World War II battleships of Italy Category:1910s ships ","title":"Andrea Doria-class battleship"},{"id":"5821093","text":"Dalnavert is a historic house museum located in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada.

Then the lattice relaxes into a cubic symmetry (right). Keeping the red circle basis constant results in lattice vectors taken from an ellipsoid instead of a spherical area (compare to the blue circle). The Pulay stress or Pulay forces (named for Peter Pulay) is an error that occurs in the stress tensor (or Jacobian matrix) obtained from self-consistent field calculations (Hartree‚ÄìFock or density functional theory) due to the incompleteness of the basis set.G P Francis and M C Payne, J. Phys.: Condens. Matter 2 (1990) 4395-4404, Vasp Guide, Volume vs. energy, volume relaxations, Pulay Stress A plane-wave density functional calculation on a crystal with specified lattice vectors will typically include in the basis set all plane waves with energies below the specified energy cutoff. This corresponds to all points on the reciprocal lattice that lie within a sphere whose radius is related to the energy cutoff. Consider what happens when the lattice vectors are varied, resulting in a change in the reciprocal lattice vectors. The points on the reciprocal lattice which represent the basis set will no longer correspond to a sphere, but an ellipsoid. This change in the basis set will result in errors in the calculated ground state energy change. The Pulay stress is often nearly isotropic, and tends to result in an underestimate of the equilibrium volume. Pulay stress can be reduced by increasing the energy cutoff. Another way to mitigate the effect of Pulay stress on the equilibrium cell shape is to calculate the energy at different lattice vectors with a fixed energy cutoff. Similarly, the error occurs in any calculation where the basis set explicitly depends on the position of atomic nuclei (which are to change during the geometry optimization). In this case, the Hellmann‚ÄìFeynman theorem ‚Äì which is used to avoid derivation of many-parameter wave function (expanded in a basis set) ‚Äì is only valid for the complete basis set. Otherwise, the terms in theorem's expression containing derivatives of the wavefunction persist, giving rise to additional forces ‚Äì the Pulay forces: : \\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d} E}{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{R}} &= \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}}{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{R}}\\\\langle\\\\psi\\\\hat{H}\\\\psi\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\bigg\\\\langle\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\psi}{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{R}}\\\\bigg\\\\hat{H}\\\\bigg\\\\psi\\\\bigg\\\\rangle + \\\\bigg\\\\langle\\\\psi\\\\bigg\\\\hat{H}\\\\bigg\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\psi}{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{R}}\\\\bigg\\\\rangle + \\\\bigg\\\\langle\\\\psi\\\\bigg\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\hat{H}}{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{R}}\\\\bigg\\\\psi\\\\bigg\\\\rangle \\\\\\\\\\\\ &=\\\\underbrace{ E\\\\bigg\\\\langle\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\psi}{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{R}}\\\\bigg\\\\psi\\\\bigg\\\\rangle + E\\\\bigg\\\\langle\\\\psi\\\\bigg\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\psi}{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{R}}\\\\bigg\\\\rangle }_{ \\\\ 0 \\\\ for \\\\ complete \\\\ basis \\\\ set } + \\\\bigg\\\\langle\\\\psi\\\\bigg\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\hat{H}}{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\mathbf{R}}\\\\bigg\\\\psi\\\\bigg\\\\rangle. \\\\end{align} The presence of Pulay forces makes the optimized geometry parameters converge slower with increasing basis set. The way to eliminate the erroneous forces is to use nuclear-position-independent basis functions, to explicitly calculate and then subtract them from the conventionally obtained forces, or to self-consistently optimize the center of localization of the orbitals.

It is signed as Pennsylvania Route 3 between 38th Street (U.S. Route 13) and 15th Street (PA 611). A short portion of the road continues west from Cobbs Creek Parkway (63rd Street) to Delaware County. The High Street was the familiar name of the principal street in nearly every English town at the time Philadelphia was founded. But if Philadelphia was indebted to England for the name of High Street, nearly every American town is, in turn, indebted to Philadelphia for its Market Street. Long before the city was laid out or settled, Philadelphia's founder, William Penn, had planned that markets would be held regularly on the wide High Street. The city's first market stalls were situated in the center of the thoroughfare starting at Front Street and proceeding west eventually to 8th Street. The stalls soon became covered and were not taken down as planned. Later, additional covered sheds appeared west of Center Square as the city expanded westward. The street began to be called Market Street around 1800. The road's new name was made official by an ordinance of 1858, coincidentally, just a year before the market sheds were ordered removed. Market Street has been called the most historic highway in the United States because of the various historic sites along its eastern section. Many of Benjamin Franklin's activities were centered along Market Street. His house was located near the intersection of Fourth Street, and he may have performed his famous kite- flying experiment near Third and Market Streets. Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence in a boarding house (the Graff or Declaration House) once located at the Seventh Street intersection. The mansion of Robert Morris, financier of the American Revolution, was located near Sixth and Market Streets. This house, known as the President's House, was used by George Washington and John Adams as their residence during their terms as President. (The house was more or less on the site of the northern part of the modern-day Liberty Bell Center.) Around 1795 Theophilus Cazenove lived at Market Street.Full text of \\"Cazenove journal, 1794 : a record of the journey of Theophilus Cazenove through New Jersey and Pennsylvania\\" Several important finance and publishing firsts also occurred along Market Street between Second and Fourth Streets during the 18th century. Market Street is still one of the principal locations of business and commerce in Philadelphia. Route Market Street sign Market Street runs from Millbourne to Front Street in Center City, Philadelphia. At Front Street, a bridge over Interstate 95 brings traffic from Penn's Landing, on the western bank of the Delaware River, onto westbound Market Street. Market Street runs one way, eastbound, between 20th Street and 15th Street, with westbound traffic diverted onto JFK Boulevard. Market Street is interrupted between 15th Street and Juniper Street by Philadelphia City Hall, and so technically does not intersect with Broad Street. A pedestrian- only path continues Market Street across the City Hall block. Between 12th Street and roughly 20th Street, Market Street is heavily commercial, with office skyscrapers rising on both sides. In the past, there was once a connection to Market Street in Camden, New Jersey by ferry. The street continues westward, crossing over the Schuylkill River via the Market Street Bridge, into and through University City and West Philadelphia. SEPTA's Market-Frankford Line runs along Market Street, as a subway east of 44th Street and as an elevated line above Market Street, west of there. Landmarks The James A. Byrne U.S. Courthouse for Eastern Pennsylvania 30th Street Station The most famous landmark on the road is Independence National Historical Park, at Fifth and Market Streets. Home to the Liberty Bell, Independence Hall, and National Constitution Center, the complex is the heart of Philadelphia's Old City neighborhood. East of the intersection of Front and Market Streets lies an entrance to Penn's Landing, alongside the Delaware River. At 2nd Street stands the historic Christ Church, once the tallest building in North America. Philadelphia television station WTXF-TV 29 (FOX) is situated on Market Street at 4th Street. A ground-level studio with a window overlooks the street. Also located at the same intersection is Entercom property 94 WIP. Adjacent to Independence Mall is the National Museum of American Jewish History, which relocated to that location in 2010 and occupies the spot once held by CBS 3 and KYW Newsradio 1060. The Fashion District Philadelphia shopping mall is located on Market Street between 9th and 12th Streets. Adjacent is the Pennsylvania Convention Center. Reading Terminal, the former grand railroad station for the Reading Railroad is located on the northeastern corner of 12th and Market Streets. It now serves as the grand entrance to the Pennsylvania Convention Center. The PSFS Building, generally regarded as the first International Style building in the US, stands at the intersection with 12th Street. Philadelphia City Hall stands atop Market Street's intersection with Broad Street. Commuters can access the Market- Frankford Line, Broad Street Line, Subway Surface Lines, and Suburban Station through the 15th Street Headhouse (among other access points) across from City Hall. One Liberty Place, formerly Philadelphia's tallest building, is located at the southeast corner of 17th and Market Streets.

He wrote, among other things, stories, essays, translations, and lyric poetry and was one of the more well-known authors of former East Germany.  Life  Parents David and Lola Leder painted by Lovis Corinth Hermlin was born in 1915 in Chemnitz, Germany, in what is now the Federal State of Saxony, the son of Jewish immigrant and art collector David Leder and his wife Lola, he grew both in Chemnitz and in Berlin. In 1931, he joined a communist youth organization. From 1933 until 1936, he worked as a printer's apprentice. He emigrated from Germany in 1936, and between then and his return to Germany in 1945 at the end of World War II, lived in Palestine, France, and Switzerland. After his return to Germany, he worked as a radio broadcaster in Frankfurt am Main. He moved to East Berlin in 1947, and was a contributor to several communist magazines, including T√§gliche Rundschau, Ulenspiegel, Aufbau, and Sinn und Form. T√§gliche Rundschau (English: Daily Review) was the official newspaper of the Soviet military administration and later the Soviet High Commission in East Berlin until 1955. As the author of several well-known pro-Stalin propaganda songs, Hermlin soon was working in some of the most important governmental bodies in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany. By 1949, he was one of the most powerful and influential writers in the newly founded German Democratic Republic. As a close friend of Walter Ulbricht and Erich Honecker, Hermlin soon found himself at the forefront of East German culture and politics, and split his time between them. In December 1962 Hermlin joined the initiators of a group dedicated to the reading of young poets at the East German Akademie der K√ºnste (English: Academy of Arts). Some of the poets featured by this group included Wolf Biermann, Volker Braun, Bernd Jentzsch, Sarah Kirsch, and Karl Mickel. This group, and the Akademie der K√ºnste as a whole, was at the forefront of a spike in the popularity of lyric poetry in 1960s East Germany. Thereupon, he was relieved of his position of Secretary of Poetry at the Akademie, although he remained a member. He was a critic of the Soviet crushing of the Prague Spring in 1968, although he did not make these criticisms very open. He was much more open in his criticism of the East German government's 1976 expulsion of a contemporary poet, Wolf Biermann, whose poetry Hermlin exhibited some years previously. Going against the official politics of the day, he, in conjunction with Erich Honecker, organized a conference of writers dedicated to the furthering of peace and reconciliation, the Berliner Begegnung. He was also a member of the Schriftstellerverband der DDR and the Akademie der K√ºnste West Berlin (English: East German Writer's Association and West Berlin Academy of the Arts, respectively). Hermlin died in Berlin.

He was highly successful as a composer and influential, especially on the development of imitative counterpoint, and numerous compositions of his survive. Most of what is known about his life and career is inferred. Life Most musical manuscripts give his name only as \\"Caron.\\" But his contemporary, the music theorist Johannes Tinctoris names him in three different treatises as \\"Firminus Caron\\" and the Vatican choirbook San Pietro B80 has \\"F. Caron\\" written above its copy of his Missa L'homme arm√©. Attempts in the past to identify him with people named Philippe Caron and Jean Caron are therefore to be discarded. Furthermore, a reference to \\"Firminus Caron\\" as primus musicus at Amiens cathedral in 1422 has now been shown to be misdated: his activity in Amiens is attested by numerous documents dating from 1459 to 1475 (when his father died). A document of 1473 names him \\"maistre Fremin le Caron,\\" implying that he had a university master's degree, and that of 1475 names him \\"sire Fremin le Caron,\\" meaning that he had been ordained a priest. Some writers of the time, including Tinctoris, praised Caron. Most of Caron's music survives in Italian manuscripts, leading to the hypothesis that he may have spent some time in Italy, a common destination for composers from northern Europe: however many compositions by French composers made their way to Italian manuscripts without being carried there by their composers, so this is not certain. In 1472 and 1473, Caron is mentioned by Loyset Comp√®re alongside Guillaume Dufay, and stylistic similarities between the two composers suggests a relation. In addition, one of Caron's masses appears in a Cambrai manuscript dated to 1472 or 1473, the year before Dufay's death there. Caron may have been in Cambrai in the early 1470s and known Dufay, but even that is not certain. References to Caron in writings by music theorists appear as late as 1556, in the writings of German Hermann Finck, indicating the spread and duration of his reputation. Johannes Tinctoris, whose writings are a rich source on 15th-century composers and music theory, extravagantly praises Caron's music, but also mentions that he was poorly educated. Music and influence Caron left both sacred and secular music, including five masses and numerous secular songs. One of the earliest masses based on the famous tune L'homme arm√© is by Caron, and survives in an early 1460s Vatican manuscript along with L'homme arm√© masses by several other composers. In Caron's setting the tune is transposed to Dorian mode and elaborated considerably; the upper voices often sing in two-part imitation. Most of his secular songs were in French, and for three voices, and most survive from Italian manuscripts. Most are rondeaux, and most are in duple meter. One of his songs, Helas que pourra devenir, was extraordinarily famous, and was the second-most-widely distributed song in manuscript sources of the third quarter of the 15th century (De tous biens plaine, by Hayne van Ghizeghem, was the first). It is unusual among songs of the time in using very close imitation, and it seems to have initiated a trend. David Fallows, writing in the New Grove, hypothesises that it may have originated as an instrumental fantasy.

In liquid state theory  In liquid state theory, the 'excluded volume' of a molecule is the volume that is inaccessible to other molecules in the system as a result of the presence of the first molecule.Hill T. L., An Introduction to Statistical Thermodynamics,Dover Publications, New York, 1986, p 288 The excluded volume of a hard sphere is eight times its volume‚Äîhowever, for a two- molecule system, this volume is distributed among the two particles, giving the conventional result of four times the volume;Mortimer, Robert G., Physical Chemistry, Academic Press, 3rd Edition, p 423 this is an important quantity in the Van der Waals equation of state. The calculation of the excluded volume for particles with non-spherical shapes is usually difficult, since it depends on the relative orientation of the particles. The distance of closest approach of hard ellipses and their excluded area has been recently considered.  In polymer science  In polymer science, excluded volume refers to the idea that one part of a long chain molecule can not occupy space that is already occupied by another part of the same molecule.Hill T. L., An Introduction to Statistical Thermodynamics,Dover Publications, New York, 1986, p 225 Excluded volume causes the ends of a polymer chain in a solution to be further apart (on average) than they would be were there no excluded volume (e.g. in case of ideal chain model). The recognition that excluded volume was an important factor in analyzing long-chain molecules in solutions provided an important conceptual breakthrough, and led to the explanation of several puzzling experimental results of the day. It also led to the concept of the theta point, the set of conditions at which an experiment can be conducted that causes the excluded volume effect to be neutralized. At the theta point, the chain reverts to ideal chain characteristics.Rubinstein M., Colby R. H., Polymer Physics, Oxford University Press, New York, 2003, p 49 The long-range interactions arising from excluded volume are eliminated, allowing the experimenter to more easily measure short-range features such as structural geometry, bond rotation potentials, and steric interactions between near- neighboring groups. Flory correctly identified that the chain dimension in polymer melts would have the size computed for a chain in ideal solution if excluded volume interactions were neutralized by experimenting at the theta point.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on December 10, 2006.Air Dates for the Simpsons, tvguide.com. Retrieved on 2008-07-11 In the episode, Bart becomes Nelson's new best friend and under Nelson's protection no one dares to mess with Bart. It was written by Matt Selman and directed by Chris Clements. In its original run, the episode received 8.29 million viewers. The episode's title is a pun on The Odd Couple, emphasizing Nelson's style of laughing. A fictional character featured in this episode, Angelica Button, was later used in the season 19 episode \\"Smoke on the Daughter\\", and the revelation that the Angelica Button book series was ghost-written was the basis for the season 23 episode \\"The Book Job\\". Plot Marge and Homer are making love in their room while playing a fake tape of them arguing so the kids will not come in. When a flying article of clothing hits the tape recorder and plays America's \\"A Horse with No Name\\", Bart and Lisa decide to come in. Bart ends up traumatized by the sight and is an emotional wreck the following day. While he is coping, Nelson coerces Bart and Milhouse for their lunch money but also invites him and the rest of the class to his upcoming birthday party. Although Bart convinces all his friends not to go to Nelson's birthday party, Marge makes him attend. After the party, Bart becomes Nelson's new best friend and under Nelson's protection no one dares to mess with Bart. However, there is only one drawback to his newfound friend/bodyguard: he is no longer able to pal around with Milhouse because Nelson has never had a best friend before and is overly protective and jealous. Eventually, Nelson discovers that Bart had been playing with Milhouse, which leads him to no longer consider Bart a friend. He eventually decides to forgive Bart, however Bart tells Nelson that he thinks he is a psycho. Later, during a field trip to some tidepools, Nelson confronts Bart in a cave, telling Bart he is a bad friend. Suddenly, high tide comes and Nelson saves Bart (but only because they were field trip buddies). Later, Bart goes home and remembers the good times he had with Nelson while hugging a \\"Nelson vest\\" he had received. Meanwhile, in the B-plot, Homer finds himself hooked on one of Lisa's fantasy books, choosing to read an Angelica Button book to Lisa. Homer eventually reads ahead and finds that one of the characters, Greystash, is killed while trying to save Angelica. Upon hearing that Greystash dying would be the end of Lisa's childhood, Homer is unable to bring himself to read the last chapter to Lisa, and improvises a happy ending instead involving Greystash defeating the evil wizard. Afterwards, Lisa reads the real ending and nonchalantly decides that Homer's ending was better. During the credits, Homer is seen at Moe's Tavern, still mourning the loss of Greystash while screaming, \\"No man should have to outlive his fictional wizard!\\". Awards This episode was subsequently nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award in 2007 for Outstanding Animated Program (Less Than One Hour) but lost to South Park. Matt Selman was also nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award in the animation category; the award was won by The Simpsons episode \\"Kill Gil: Vols. 1 & 2\\".  Cultural References  The Angelica Button series of books are a parody of the Harry Potter franchise. Greystash is a parody of Albus Dumbledore. The Malicious Krubb is a parody of both Lucius Malfoy and Severus Snape due to his resemblance to the former's looks, and the fact that he killed the Dumbledore-esque figure, like the latter. The character Lord Evilton is a parody of Lord Voldemort. The continuous shot of Bart and Nelson walking through the back of the school to get to the lunch hall is a nearly perfect shot-by-shot rendition of the Steadicam scene from Goodfellas, as Henry and Karen walk through the back of the Copacabana. Similarly, both the couples get a table set up just for themselves from the manager(or principal) to watch a singer/comedian perform on stage. The freeze-frames and voiceovers during this scene are reminiscent of Thelma Schoonmaker's editing style. The song played in this scene is He's a Rebel by The Crystals. The same band's song And Then He Kissed Me was used during the Steadicam shot in Goodfellas. The scene where Bart hugs Nelson's vest is reminiscent of Brokeback Mountain.

Gnathorhizid fossils have been found in North America, Madagascar, Australia, and possibly Eastern Europe and South Africa. They are characterized by high-ridged toothplates that form cutting blades and a reduction in cranial bones.  Distribution  Gnathorhizids are found in North America, Eastern Europe, Australia, and Africa. Gnathorhizids from North America range from the Gzhelian through the Roadian. In Africa, gnathorhizids are found in Olenekian of Madagascar and possibly South Africa. Lungfish teeth attributed to gnathorhizids have been reported from the Lopingian to the Olenekian in Poland and Western Russia. It is likely, then, that gnathorhizids had a Pangean distribution throughout the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic.  Paleoecology and behavior  Gnathorhizids are found primarily in paleosols representing ephemeral wetlands. Additionally, gnathorhizids, unlike most groups of fossil lungfish, are often found in association with regular burrow structures, suggesting this group of lungfish may have estivated during the dry season, much like modern African and South American lungfish. Unlike most fossil lungfish, but again, like modern South American and African lungfish, gnathorhizids have bladelike toothplates. This suggests gnathorhizids were active predators unlike most lungfish, which feed primarily on benthic invertebrates.  Sources  * Berman, D.

The founding members are originally Norwegian, from Bj√∏rndal, a small suburb of Oslo. When based in Norway, the band were mostly known for their live shows in Oslo. The band relocated to England in early 2009.  Music and influences  Daddysmilk's has a varied musical spectrum, with influences including modern alternative rock, punk and pop. Their music also incorporates elements from swing jazz, musicals and melodies reminiscent of traditional Norwegian folk music. The band also combines riff-based elements and chord-based song structuring, while maintaining a heavy focus on melody and dissonant harmonies. Their music has been compared to System of a Down, Queens of the Stone Age and early My Chemical Romance.  Norway  Kristoffer Ziegler and Marius Markus met at Lofsrud Skole in Mortensrud, Oslo. Sootholtet and Markus were classmates and childhood friends with Sarmast, and the three started jamming together with several others. Ziegler and Markus didn't really know each other until they discovered a mutual liking for Stoner rock and Punk rock. After a year at boarding school, Ziegler joined the current band as a temporary fill-in, but was given the option to join the band permanently by the current singer. Ziegler and the other members accepted, and the band started doing shows in Oslo. The band got second place in the Norwegian Battle of Bands competition later that year and was signed by a management company the next year. The band spent two years in the studio, recording for a record label, but when the final product was revealed to them they were not satisfied with the result. This resulted in a conflict with their management and ultimately the band and manager parted ways.  Relocation to Manchester  Daddysmilk relocated to Manchester, England in late 2008, stating the reason for relocating as being frustration for a lack of a musical scene in Oslo, and Norway, and a lack of appreciation from the musical establishment in Norway. The band was never featured on Norwegian National Broadcasting's Ur√∏rt, a nationwide radio show designed to showcase unsigned talent in Norway. The band was however featured in the popular online game Ski Challenge 2008 with their song \\"Bounce\\". It was also used at promotional television advertisement for the game on Norwegian National Broadcasting. Since moving to Manchester the band have completed their line up by adding guitarist Keith Vass and bass player Stephen Hodkinson, both from Manchester.  Popularity  Daddysmilk gained a moderate fanbase in the Oslo area, as the word spread around their live performances, as well as a steadily increasing online fanbase. Their international fanbase has strongest roots in Mexico, Canada, Singapore and Japan, thanks to good chart positions and good reviews on websites GarageBand.com, OurStage.com and IACmusic.com.  Lyrics  Daddysmilk's songs are characterized by an emphasis on dramatic lyrics. The songs usually portray a conflicting situation, and the contrast between positive and negative emotions are often used as a hook.

At almost high, the dome was the highest point in the city of Havana until 1956 when the FOCSA Building was built reaching a height of 121 meters (397 ft). The Capitolio had the third highest dome in the world at the time of its construction. The gardens, based on the designs of European gardens consisting of areas of lawn bordered by paths and highlighted by Royal Palm trees, were designed by French landscape architect Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier who also designed the Paseo del Prado. The 56 steps leading to the main entrance, La Escalinata, is flanked by statues by the Italian artist Angelo Zanelli. To the left is Work (El Trabajo) and to the right The Tutelary Virtue (La Virtud Tutelar). The steps lead up to the central portico, which is wide and more than tall. There are 12 granite columns in the ionic order arranged in two rows and each over tall. Beyond the portico, three large bronze doors with bas-reliefs by Zanelli allow access to the main hall. Inner courtyard at the north section of the Havana Capitol (Cuba). At the left, The Rebel Angel, a work by Italian sculptor Salvatore Buemi (1860‚Äì1916). The inside of the main hall under the cupola is the Statue of the Republic (La Estatua de la Rep√∫blica). The statue, also by Zanelli, was cast in bronze in Rome in three pieces and assembled inside the building after its arrival in Cuba. It is covered with 22 carat (92%) gold leaf and weighs 49 tons. At tall, it was the second highest statue under cover in the world at the time, with only the Great Buddha of Nara being taller. The statue stands on a plinth high bringing the total height to . A Creole Cuban, Lily Valty served as the model for the body for Zanelli, and the inspiration for the statue came from Athena, the Greek goddess of wisdom. El Senado Embedded in the floor in the centre of the main hall is a replica 25 carat (5 g) diamond, which marks Kilometre Zero for Cuba. The original diamond, said to have belonged to Tsar Nicholas II of Russia and have been sold to the Cuban state by a Turkish merchant, was stolen on 25 March 1946 and mysteriously returned to the President, Ram√≥n Grau San Mart√≠n, on 2 June 1946. To either side of the main hall is the Sal√≥n de Pasos Perdidos (Hall of Lost Steps), named for its acoustic properties. These halls, with inlaid marble floors and gilded lamps, lead to the two semicircular chambers that formerly housed the Parliament and Chamber of Deputies. The Parliament chamber to the right of building is backed on to by the President's office which has a door opening directly onto the dais. A range of different lamps are seen throughout the building. These were all designed specifically for the building by Cuban designers and the majority of them manufactured in France. In the centre of the building are two patios which provide light and ventilation for the offices of first (ground), third and fourth floors. The north patio features another statue The Rebellious Angel (El √Ångel Rebelde) which was donated to the building after the inauguration. There is a small fifth floor, and a sixth floor which gives access only to part of the cupola. Central portico A wide granite staircase of 56 steps, 36 meters wide and 16 meters high, leads to the portico of the building. There are two rows of 6 columns of the Ionic order. The pillars stand out with a diameter of 1.55 meters and a height of 14.10 meters. Reasons for the hall, located in all the doors and the lateral panels, are the Boticcino marble squares sculpted by Angelo Zanelli. On both sides of the end of the staircase are two bronze sculptural groups with granite pedestal by the Italian Angelo Zanelli, one male, and the other female, have a height of 6.70 meters and represent the first progress of human activity and the second the tutelary virtue of the people. Statue of the Republic La Republica Located in the apse, the Statue of the Republic is the figure of a young woman standing, dressed in a tunic, with a helmet, shield and lance; it weighs 30 tons, is 14.60 meters high, and rests on a marble pedestal of 2.50 meters. It was sculpted by Angelo Zanelli, author of the Altare della Patria, part of the monument to King Victor Emmanuel II, in Rome. It is the third largest indoor statue in the world, surpassed only by the Buddha of Nara, Japan and the Abraham Lincoln statue in the Lincoln Memorial in Washington. D.C.

In the episode the Bundys attempt (at Marcy Rhoades's suggestion) to improve their love life by having marital relations in a different setting. While staying at the Hop-On-Inn, the Bundys discover a secretly recorded video tape of the Rhoades having sex. Despite this, the Bundys decide to have sex and end up having themselves recorded as well. The two families then proceed to sue the establishment for violation of their privacy. Conflict erupted between the show's producers and the airing network over the episode's content, which prevented the episode from being aired in the United States until June 2002, five years after Married... with Childrens initial television run, ending in 1997. Even when first shown on American television in 2002, four lines were removed from the broadcast, despite it having already run uncut in other countries. Plot After writing to a televised sex-help program, Peggy decides that the best way to rekindle her relationship with Al is to have sex in a different location. Upon Marcy's recommendation, Peggy and Al go to the Hop-On-Inn and discover a videotape waiting for them in their room. After watching some of the tape, the Bundys realize that the couple having sex on the video are Steve and Marcy. Although Al is disgusted, the action turns Peggy on and the couple have sex. Peggy and Al return home and show the tape to Steve and Marcy, who are embarrassed by the film, much to the delight of the Bundys. The Rhoades express their dismay that they were secretly recorded, but Steve points out that the Bundys may have been videotaped as well. Marcy and Al are upset by this violation of their privacy and propose physical violence against the owners of the motel. Steve and Peg, on the other hand, want to take action against the Hop-On-Inn and make money from the incident. Peggy convinces Al to sue the motel with her and the Rhoades. Steve, not wanting a lawyer to take any of the million dollars he expects to win from the case, decides to act as one for the two families. The case begins with Steve presenting a lengthy opening statement, during which the stenographer and the judge fall asleep. Next, Steve shows the subpoenaed sex tapes from the motel, despite objections from his wife. After a few hours, the tape runs out and the courtroom applauds Steve and Marcy's romp. Next, Steve shows Peggy and Al's tape, which ends after a few seconds. After the plaintiff rests, the defense lawyer calls Marcy, Al, and Peggy to the stand. She asks Marcy a series of embarrassing questions, hoping to prove Marcy knew that the camera was there. Her tactic with the Bundys is to try to prove sexual intercourse did not occur on the videotape. In the end, the Rhoades are awarded $10,000 but the Bundys receive nothing, because the jury does not believe that sex occurred. After everyone exits the courtroom, Al attempts to prove that he can perform when he wants to and has sex with Peggy for hours on the judge's bench, unwittingly while being recorded by the courtroom camera. Production and controversy The episode was written by Jeanne Baruch and Jeanne Romano, both newcomers to Married... with Children. Directed by Gerry Cohen, it was taped on January 6, 1989, with a planned airing date of February 19 of the same year, but the censors of the Fox Broadcasting Company objected to many of the lines in the episode. It was not the first time that Fox censors had struggled with the content in Married... with Children. Earlier in the season, producers and writers Michael G. Moye and Ron Leavitt had to fight with the censors to air \\"The Camping Show\\", an episode where the Bundys and the Rhoades are trapped in a cabin in the wilderness as all three women have their periods at the same time. It was originally intended to be shown in November 1988, but its airing was delayed while the network wrangled with the subject matter. The episode aired on December 11, 1988, but the producers were forced to change the title from \\"A Period Piece\\" to \\"The Camping Show\\", despite the fact that the title itself does not appear onscreen and is not mentioned during the program. The censors ended up pulling \\"I'll See You in Court\\", preventing it from airing in the United States during the series' original run. Terry Rakolta, a political activist from Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, had launched a letter-writing campaign against the program after viewing the Season 3 episode \\"Her Cups Runneth Over\\" in January 1989. Offended by the episode's content, she urged advertisers to boycott the show, several of whom did or pledged to more carefully screen the episodes for which they provided advertising. The campaign garnered more media attention than she had expected and the advertisers' more careful scrutiny of the individual episodes that they supported was a significant factor that led to the pulling of \\"I'll See You in Court\\". Contributing to this was that the overall topic, sex, was not seen as a topic to be vocally and openly discussed on television. In an interview with Playboy magazine, Moye claimed that the producers dubbed the episode the \\"Lost Episode\\" both because it never aired and because they felt that they lost control of the project. A typical episode of Married... with Children contained two or three censor notes denoting content that was \\"too graphic\\" or \\"over the edge\\", whereas \\"I'll See You in Court\\" contained a total of 15. After arguing with the censors and conceding all but four of the notes, Fox still refused to air the episode. Moye claims that the final total of 13 changes was unacceptable because \\"[t]he integrity of the show was shot to hell\\". The episode did premiere in other parts of the world in 1990. On June 18, 2002, the FX network broadcast the episode for the first time on American television. It was still not shown in its entirety, however, as the network cut four lines, less than one minute, during the scene where the two families decide on what to do about the videotapes: Although the episode has aired in Australia (in a later-than-normal time), New Zealand, Europe, and Canada unedited, the above omissions mean that it has never been broadcast in the United States in its entirety. The total time between when the episode was taped and when it premiered in the United States was 13 years, 5 months, and 12 days. Reception The episode remained unaired for so long in the United States that contemporary critics did not have an opportunity to review it. After the 2002 airing, the episode became available in the United States on the Married with Children, Vol. 1 - The Most Outrageous Episodes DVD, which was released on February 4, 2003 and The Complete Third Season, which was released on January 25, 2005. DVD Verdict claimed that the content of the show was not overly racy, even by the standards of the era. The review claims that, by 2003, the content was \\"so sedate as to be comatose.\\" Film Freak Central gave the episode a grade of C+, calling the episode \\"quaint\\" and warning to \\"[n]ever trust the hype.\\" References External links * Category:1989 American television episodes Category:Censored works Category:Censorship of broadcasting in the United States Category:Unaired television episodes Category:Married... with Children Category:Publisher censorship Category:Television controversies in the United States Category:Television episodes set in Chicago Category:Television episodes pulled from general rotation Category:Television episodes about dysfunctional families ","title":"I'll See You in Court"},{"id":"5821387","text":"In the United States, an Office action is a document written by an examiner in a patent or trademark examination procedure and mailed to an applicant \\"Changes to Practice for Continued Examination Filings, Patent Applications Containing Patentably Indistinct Claims, and Examination of Claims in Patent Applications,\\" 72 Federal Register 46716 (August 21, 2007) for a patent or trademark. The expression is used in many jurisdictions. Formally, the \\"O\\" is supposed to be capitalized, since it refers to the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.  United States   Trademark law  In United States trademark law, an Office action is issued by an examiner for the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO),Trademarks - how to respond rejecting an application to register a trademark. An Office action typically includes one or both of two elements. The first possible element is the category of \\"informalities\\", matters such as an inadequate sample to show use of the mark, providing insufficient information with respect to the nature of the entity seeking the mark (for example, failing to name the partners in a partnership), or providing insufficient information for the examiner to determine what, exactly, the goods and services provided by the applicant are. The second possible element of an Office action is an actual basis for rejection of the mark itself. The most frequent bases are likelihood of confusion with an existing registered mark and genericness or descriptiveness of the mark for which registration is sought. Rarely, a mark will be rejected as \\"immoral or scandalous\\", usually if it contains sexually suggestive terms, or vulgarities, for example the rejection of a logo with a defecating dog in Greyhound Corp. v. Both Worlds, Inc., 6 U.S.P.Q.2d 1635. When an Office action is issued, the applicant has six months to respond to the Examiner. If the Office action was issued with respect to \\"informalities\\", the response may simply be the correction of these matters by providing additional information. If the action is premised on a defect in the mark itself, such as likelihood of confusion, genericness, or descriptiveness, the applicant may need to present evidence and legal argument to overcome this rejection. If the Examiner is not convinced by the evidence submitted, a final Office action will issue. This may be appealed to the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board. A final Office action is also known as a filing refusal. Patent law In United States patent law, an Office action is a document written by a patent examiner in response to a patent application after the examiner has examined the application.Patent Prosecution (BitLaw)Intellectual Property- INVENTORS Committee: Short Description of the Patent Process The Office action cites prior art and gives reasons why the examiner has allowed, or approved, the applicant's claims, and/or rejected the claims. An Office action may be \\"final\\" or \\"non-final\\". In a non-final Office action, the applicant is entitled to reply and request reconsideration or further examination, with or without making an amendment. In a final Office action, the applicant has two options for reply. In the first option, the applicant may appeal rejection of claims to the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences. Otherwise, the applicant may file an amendment which complies with the requirements set forth in the Office action. Reply to a final rejection must include cancellation of, or appeal from the rejection of, each rejected claim. If any claim stands allowed, the reply to a final rejection must comply with any requirements or objections as to form. Replies to final Office actions must be in accordance with 37 C.F.R. 1.113-1.114.MPEP, section 706.0737 C.F.R. 1.11337 C.F.R. 1.114 When an Office action is issued, the applicant may take up to six months to respond to the Examiner. Note that a shortened statutory period of between one and three months usually applies (justified by the USPTO's desire for speedy prosecution of applications) and responses sent later than the shortened period require the filing of a petition and the payment of a petition fee that varies with the number of additional months requested. Each additional month requires an increasingly higher fee. For example, when an Examiner sends a restriction requirement, a one-month shortened statutory period applies, and if the applicant sends a response on the 31st or 32nd day (depending on the month, as well as on Saturday/Sunday/holiday practice; note that February is granted 30 days), a petition for a one-month extension, and the associated fee, must accompany the response. Most other Office actions have shortened statutory periods of either two or three months. Note however that an applicant cannot petition for an extension of time beyond the six-month limit.

The film, which has avant-garde, experimental elements, concerns a bored socialite who finds herself drawn to a mirror that sexually arouses her. The film has themes of incest and the traumatic effects it has on those who have experienced it. It also holds scenes of violence and sexual violence, as well as presenting the sexual content in an artistic as opposed to erotic manner. Plot Catherine (Catherine Erhardt) is a sexually unfulfilled socialite who longs for the memory of her father. She spends much of her time in the attic, masturbating in front of a gothic mirror that reminds her of her childhood and teenage years with her father (Jamie Gillis). During one of her daily visits she encounters the ghost of her father in the mirror. The ghost masturbates her and draws her into the mirror to witness several sexually charged scenarios. These pique her interest and eventually culminate in a scene where Catherine witnesses her teenage self semi-reluctantly, then enthusiastically, take part in an incestuous encounter with her father. After her father is finished with the encounter, he remarks to Catherine that this was what she wanted. Before returning to reality, Catherine realizes that this is not her father but a demonic figure. She tries to deny his invitation to come into the mirror's realm as a permanent resident but the demon tells her that he knows that she will return as she always has in the past, as she is bored with the world and her husband. He tells her to return to the mirror at 1 am, but only after fulfilling a few conditions. She must not only throw all of her jewelry away, but she must also allow her daughter Jennifer to have unconditional access to the room so that the demon can watch her just as he watched Catherine grow. This upsets Catherine, as she had previously forbid her daughter from entering the room and did not want to allow the demon access to Jennifer. She tries to get out of the late night encounter by trying to leave the house and persuade her husband to take her somewhere, but is unsuccessful. Later that night Catherine returns to the room and in a dream- like state begins to masturbate. The demon exits the mirror and while initially languid upon his approach, Catherine begins to struggle against his advances. He then violently rapes Catherine, who screams, which awakens the rest of the house. She eventually passes out, awakening in a horrific world where people degrade themselves and each another. Catherine is horror struck to realize that rather than the lavish world that had been promised to her, the demon has tricked her and that she is there because she chose to focus on sexual illusions and fulfilling her deepest desires rather than try to interact more with the world around her and improve herself as a person. She discovers her father in the sexual hell, which further terrifies her. Dodging the many people trying to sexually assault her, Catherine tries to escape but is unable to and succumbs to the madness of the hell. Her daughter sits in front of the mirror, becoming just as enraptured with it as her mother was.

The film played in American and European art houses, and in its original run at New York's infamous World Theater, the theater screened a Warner Bros. cartoon before the feature film. It achieved some small notoriety in the New York papers at the time because it featured an underage soap opera actresshttps://www.imdb.com/name/nm3001296/ in a small, non-sex role, as the original poster named Nicholson as a \\"14 year old starlet\\". The line was removed from all future posters. Through the Looking Glass has since been shown at some film festivals, such as the 2013 In The Flesh film festival. In a rare review in a mainstream publication, John Grant in The Encyclopedia of Fantasy comments that the movie \\"deploys some sophisticated fantasy\\" and \\"announce[s] that pornographic fantasy movies need not be entirely awful, although almost all of its successors have been\\"Clute, John and Grant, John. The Encyclopedia of Fantasy London: Orbit Books, 1997. , entries under \\"Pornographic Fantasy Movies\\" and \\"Cinema\\". Book tie-in A novelization of the film's script, written by Eileen Lottman under pseudomyn of Molly Flute, was published through Dell Publishing. Largely similar to the film, the novel elaborates on the movie's story line, elaborating on the mirror's history within Catherine's family and heavily implying that her mother was spirited away through the mirror like Catherine was. The book also takes away the ambiguity of whether or not Catherine was molested, outright stating that the sexual scene between Catherine and her father occurred. The book also affirms at the end that Catherine's daughter Jennifer has been caught up in the mirror's spell and will eventually end up in the same sexual hell and in many of the same situations that Catherine herself was in, perpetuating the cycle that has been in place throughout Catherine's family.

There are different versions of Philippe de Ch√©risey's Circuit in existence, belonging to private individuals. in Chapter VII, adds the detail that Roseline was killed in a car accident whilst working as a double on the Television film La beaut√© sur la terre (1968),http://www.ina.fr/video/CPF86615962/la-beaute-sur-la-terre.fr.html a film that also starred Philippe de Ch√©risey under his stage name of Am√©d√©e. The story about Roseline in Circuit also involves an imaginary character named Charlot who appears frequently throughout Circuit and both characters are patently imaginary beings appearing in one of Philippe de Ch√©risey's surrealist compositions. Chapter XIII of Circuit is devoted to the Zero Meridian, with de Ch√©risey claiming it was established by Till Eulenspiegel (before Jean Picard), listing key sites that it passes through (in a fictional work attributed to Abb√© Fran√ßois-Pierre Cauneille). In this chapter Roseline is called 'Fisher Woman', preferring herself to be known as \\"Di O Nysos, DON\\" (\\"dondon\\" is French slang for \\"fat woman\\"), an otherworldly being who organises funerals for the dead who are still living in her new Citroen 2CV (the make of car she was killed in). The Da Vinci Code The term Rose Line as the Paris Meridian was given by Dan Brown in his 2003 novel The Da Vinci Code as an alternate name for \\"the world's first prime meridian\\", identified as the Paris Meridian.Philip Coppens, The Stone Puzzle of Rosslyn Chapel, Adventures Unlimited Press, 2004, p. 11. Brown's novel also conflates this meridian with a gnomon in the Parisian church of Saint-Sulpice marked in the floor with a brass line,Richard Benishai, Saint Sulpice and the \\"Rose-Line\\". as did the 1967 Priory Document Le Serpent Rouge - Notes sur Saint-Germain- des-Pr√®s et Saint-Sulpice de Paris. The Paris Meridian actually passes about 100 metres east of the gnomon,Tim O'Neill, History versus The Da Vinci Code. which according to Sharan Newman and a sign in the church was \\"never called a Rose-Line\\".Sharan Newman, The Real History Behind The Da Vinci Code, Berkley Publishing Group, 2005, p. 268. A St Sulpice booklet dating from 2000, in the pages about the history of the gnomon, describes the brass line as \\"a meridian\\"; it does not use the term Roseline or Rose Line.Paul Roumanet, Saint-Sulpice, Paroisse Saint-Sulpice, 2000 (English translation by Laurence Terrien), pp 23-26. Paul Murdin describes such sun lines as a \\"Meridian\\", or meridiana.Paul Murdin, Full Meridian of Glory: Perilous Adventures In The Competition To Measure The Earth. pp 77-85 (Copernicus Books, 2009). Brown identified the Paris Meridian with the alleged bloodline of Jesus Christ and Mary Magdalene as well as Rosslyn Chapel, the central part of his novel. In The Da Vinci Code, > Rosslyn Chapel's entrance was more modest than Langdon expected. The small > wooden door had two iron hinges and a simple oak sign, Roslin.

Mark Oxbrow and Ian Robertson state in Rosslyn and the Grail: > Dan Brown simply invented the 'Rose Line' linking Rosslyn and Glastonbury. > The name 'Roslin' definitely does not derive from any 'hallowed Rose Line'. > It has nothing to do with a 'Rose Bloodline' or a 'Rose Line meridian'. > There are many medieval spellings of 'Rosslyn'. 'Roslin' is certainly not > the 'original spelling': it is now the most common spelling for the > village.Mark Oxbrow and Ian Robertson, Rosslyn and the Grail, Mainstream > Publishing Company, Edinburgh, 2005, p. 182. At the climax of the novel, the protagonist follows the line of Arago medallions to the Louvre museum, where (according to the book) the Paris Meridian passes beneath the so-called the Inverted Pyramid in an underground mall in front of the museum. Following the tradition of esoteric interpretations of this meridian, the novel hints that this is the final resting place of the Holy Grail. The fact that the meridian passes near the Inverted Pyramid is also noted in Le guide du Paris ma√ßonnique (Guide to Masonic Paris) by Raph√§el Aurillac, who likewise ascribes some deeper, esoteric significance to this. In the Louvre area, the meridian line marked by the Arago medallions actually runs through the museum and the great courtyard at a spot considerably to the east of the Inverted Pyramid. The medallions in the museum are behind ticketed access points, while the Inverted Pyramid is located in a public mall next to the museum. Other landmarks said to lie on the line are Arques and Conques,Alan James, The Enduring Enigma of Rennes-le- Chateau. the Lady of the Roses cathedral in Rodez, St. Vincent's in Carcassonne, and the Church of St. Stephen's in Bourges, and Rennes-les-Bains. While Dan Brown presents the Rose Line as \\"the world's first prime meridian\\", the idea of establishing a Prime Meridian dates back to antiquity,Ptolemy's Almagest use the meridian through Alexandria as prime. Maimonides, Hilchot Kiddush Hachodesh 11:17, calls this point ◊ê◊û◊¶◊¢ ◊î◊ô◊ô◊©◊ï◊ë, \\"the middle of the habitation\\", i.e. the habitable hemisphere. Evidently this was a convention accepted by Arab geographers of his day. with suggested meridians running through Rhodes or the Canary Islands.

It was first published by Constable & Co., London, 1923.Editions of The Log of the Ark at WorldCat It was first published in the US by E.P. Dutton & Co., New York, 1926 under the title What Happened in the Ark. What Happened in the Ark at WorldCat One of the many editions was by Puffin Books in 1963. Plot summary The book's plot describes the way in which an outcast animal, the scub, infiltrates the ark and introduces certain of the other species to the idea of eating meat. (Until this point, all the animals eat porridge with a dollop of treacle.) This sinister development is described alongside a good deal of slapstick humour. For example, the nautically naive Noah initially constructs the ark with all the large animals quartered together for social reasons, only discovering the consequences for its stability when the flood waters surround it. Like many later fictionalisations of the Noah story, from Gary Larson to Julian Barnes, it introduces mythical beasts such as the unicorn into the Ark's passenger list, a device with obvious dramatic potential: we assume that such creatures are unlikely to survive the voyage. Here, as elsewhere, the comic elements mask tragic ones to good effect. Especially memorable is the plight of the 'Seventy-sevenses', a pair of nondescript and painfully shy mammals who name themselves after the number of their cabin, and who eventually abandon the Ark on a small raft because the atmosphere on board has become too oppressive. There was also an even sadder pair of animals \\"The Clidders\\" who melted when it began to rain! Outwardly this is a de-theologised version of the story: God does not appear, and the purpose of the Flood is not mass drowning. Yet the way the scub creeps into the childish innocence of the Ark and subverts it still points to a narrative patterned by Christian concepts of the Fall. In the final scene, a horrified Noah ‚Äì who has not yet realised quite what has happened on his ship ‚Äì watches as the newly released animals chase and fly from one another, awakened to their new identities as hunters and hunted.

Hearing Australia is the largest Australian government-funded hearing aid dispensing company providing hearing care and technologies. One of their areas of interest is hearing testing and rehabilitation of children under the age of 26. Its research division, the National Acoustic Laboratories, takes part in collaborative research for the Cooperative Research Centre for Cochlear Implant and Hearing Aid Innovation (CRC HEAR). Its research can be broadly divided into the areas of hearing assessment, hearing loss prevention, hearing rehabilitation devices, and hearing rehabilitation procedures. History Hearing Australia is the current incarnation of the Acoustic Research Laboratory that was set up in 1942. Its initial purpose was the investigation of noise on behalf of the Australian Military during World War II. After the war it helped those children whose hearing was affected by earlier rubella outbreaks. The Commonwealth Department of Health (now the Department of Health and Ageing) took over the Laboratory and was renamed the Commonwealth Acoustic Laboratories, with the aim of providing hearing services for children and veterans. It was in 1973 renamed the National Acoustic Laboratories. The Australian Hearing Services Act 1991 established it as Australian Hearing Services, a Commonwealth Government statutory authority. The name National Acoustics Laboratories was retained for its research division. When the Department of Human Services was formed in 2004, the agency now known as Australian Hearing was moved into its portfolio.

It is in the Hudson Bay drainage basin and flows to the eastern shore of Lake Winnipeg. The river passes through one of the last, large, and intact boreal forests in the world. Course The river begins at an unnamed lake in Kenora District in Northwestern Ontario. It flows west to the Manitoba border before reaching its mouth at Lake Winnipeg. Lake WInnipeg flows via the Nelson River to Hudson Bay. First Nations The Poplar River's Ojibwe name is Negginan meaning \\"my home\\". Poplar River lies near the Asatiwisipe River. It is a protected river with pristine forests and many undeveloped lakes and creeks along it. This watershed is the traditional land use area for Poplar River First Nation. The Ojibwe still use the land and waters for hunting, fishing, and gathering wild foods and medicines. The First Nation community has designated their traditional lands as a protected area with the support of Manitoba's government. Natural history The river is a part of a proposed United Nations World Heritage Site to protect the large intact area of wilderness along Lake Winnipeg and in northwestern Ontario. This wilderness river is one of the few rivers in southern Canada that is still very pristine and clean, with little or no development along the shoreline and in the entire watershed. There are no major mines, roads, hydro, or logging areas in the region. The area provides an essential habitat for a segment of the threatened woodland caribou, and also protects habitat for the chestnut lamprey, a species of special concern. Numerous archaeological sites and pictographs exist, helping to demonstrate that the area has long been of special significance to First Nations. The river is a popular destination for fishing, canoeing, ecotourism, and sightseeing. The water is very warm in the summer and fall for swimming, unlike glacier and mountain fed waters. There are many cliffs, rapids, and waterfalls along the river. The area has woodland caribou, wolves, black bears, lynx, bobcats, and remote beaches. Many species of birds nest in the region, including the bald eagle and the great grey owl.

New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 2 Apr. 2013 Previous associations had brought him into contact with the first Jesuits who had come to Spain, Saint Peter Faber among others, but it was apparently impossible to carry out his purpose of entering the Society as he was without education, having only an incomplete year at a new college begun at Alcal√° by Francis Villanueva. At the age of 39 he attempted to make up this deficiency by following the course at the College of Barcelona, but without success. His austerities had also undermined his health. After considerable delay he was finally admitted into the Society of Jesus as a lay brother on January 31, 1571, at the age of 40. The provincial is supposed to have said that if Alphonsus was not qualified to become a brother or a priest, he could enter to become a saint. Statue of St Alphonsus Rodriguez in the Church of the Cave of Saint Ignatius, Manresa Distinct novitiates for seminarians and lay brothers had not yet been established in Spain, and Alphonsus began his term of probation at Valencia or Gandia‚Äîthis point is a subject of dispute‚Äîand after six months was sent to the recently founded college on Majorca, where he remained in the humble position of porter for 46 years, exercising a marvelous influence not only on the members of the household, but upon a great number of people who came to the porter's lodge for advice and direction. As doorkeeper, his duties were to receive visitors who came to the college; search out the fathers or students who were wanted in the parlor; deliver messages; run errands; console the sick at heart who, having no one to turn to, came to him; give advice to the troubled; and distribute alms to the needy. Alphonsus tells that each time the bell rang, he looked at the door and envisioned that it was God who was standing outside seeking admittance. Among the distinguished Jesuits who came under his influence was St. Peter Claver, who lived with him for some time at Majorca, and who followed his advice in asking for the missions of South America. He made his final vows in 1585 at the age of 54. The bodily mortifications which he imposed on himself were extreme, the scruples and mental agitation to which he was subject were of frequent occurrence, his obedience absolute, and his absorption in spiritual things, even when engaged on most distracting employments, continual. His Jesuit superiors, seeing the good work he was doing among the townspeople, were eager to have his influence spread far among his own religious community, so on feast days they often sent him into the pulpit in the dining room to hear him give a sermon. On more than one occasion the community sat quietly past dinner time to hear Alphonsus finish his sermon.\\"Jesuit Family Album\\", Fairfield University Bro.

He had a deep devotion to Our Lady, especially as the Immaculate Conception, and would copy the entire little office of the Blessed Virgin for private recitation for those who asked. He left a considerable number of manuscripts after him, some of which have been published as Obras Espirituales del B. Alonso Rodriguez (Barcelona, 1885, 3 vols., octavo, complete edition, 8 vols. in quarto). They are sometimes only reminiscences of domestic exhortations, the texts are often repeated, the illustrations are from everyday life, and the treatment of one virtue occasionally entrenches upon another. They were not written with a view to publication, but put down by the saint himself, or dictated to others, in obedience to a positive command of his superiors. Veneration Alphonsus Rodriguez was declared venerable in 1626. In 1633, he was chosen by the Council General of Majorca as one of the special patrons of the city and island. In 1760, Pope Clement XIII decreed that \\"the virtues of the Venerable Alonso were proved to be of a heroic degree\\", but the expulsion of the Society from Spain in 1773, and its suppression, delayed his beatification until 1825. His canonization took place in September 1888. His remains are enshrined at Majorca.

Life and career Loveridge was born in 1952, in Stratford, New Zealand, to Horace and Margaret Loveridge. He grew up during the golden age of Taranaki rugby, with the provincial side holding the Ranfurly Shield for two tenures in 1957‚Äì1959, and 1963‚Äì1965. He played age-grade representative rugby for Taranaki at the age of 12. The Loveridge family owned a pig farm in Tariki south of Inglewood, and Loveridge attended Inglewood High School for his secondary education. He worked for a bank after leaving school, and in 1972 the bank transferred him to Auckland. While there he was selected for the Auckland University club team, and soon caught the eye of the provincial selectors. He played two games for Auckland, but after a 34-3 loss to North Auckland, in which he was marking All Black veteran Sid Going, Loveridge was discarded from the team. In 1974 Loveridge married his wife Janine, returned to Tariki to run the family farm, played for Inglewood seniors and secured the halfback position in the Taranaki team. The following year he was selected for the Junior All Blacks, and in 1977 was given his first All Black trial. In 1978 he was reserve All Black halfback for the three-match series against the Wallabies in New Zealand, but didn‚Äôt get on the field. He finally got the chance to don the black jersey in the tour to Great Britain at the end of the year, and on October 21, 1978, made his debut against Cardiff at Cardiff Arms Park. He played his first test match when first-choice halfback Mark Donaldson was stung with an ankle injury and ruled out of the match against Wales. While New Zealand almost lost that match, only winning because of Andy Haden's famed lineout dive, Loveridge played a competent game. Donaldson remained first choice for the home season of 1979, but Loveridge finally gained the edge and secured the test matches against England and Scotland at the end of the year. Loveridge went on to play 54 matches for the All Blacks, 24 of which were tests. In 1980 Graham Mourie and Andy Dalton were unavailable for the tour of Australia, and Loveridge was selected as captain. Loveridge was most renowned for his performance in the second test against the touring British Lions on 18 June 1983, at Athletic Park in Wellington. According to Lindsay Knight, for the New Zealand Rugby Museum, > \\"In difficult conditions Loveridge was the perfect complement to an All > Black pack which battling into a gale took charge of the ultra confident > Lions in the second spell. Loveridge displayed every aspect of the > halfback's art, passing accurately, kicking effectively and running with > judgement. In a match where he took every correct option he then scampered > over for the match's only try in the All Blacks' 9‚Äì0 win. Even the most > exacting judges declared Loveridge had produced one of the greatest displays > of all time and agreed with the assessment of All Black coach Bryce Rope > that this had been \\"Trapper's Test.\\"\\" In 1984 Loveridge suffered a serious knee injury, which hampered his game for the rest of his career. He joined the New Zealand Cavaliers for the rebel tour of South Africa in 1986, which proved to be his final appearance in the black jersey. He retired from New Zealand first class rugby at the end of that year, at age 34, after 54 matches for the All Blacks and 136 games for Taranaki. Loveridge remains on the family pig farm in Taranaki with his wife Janine to this day, and is father to three adult children. He is employed as a staff coach by the New Zealand Rugby Union, has coached the Taranaki under-23 development team, been on three tours with the New Zealand youth team, spent two years coaching the Wellington Hurricanes under-20 development side and been a selector for the New Zealand under-19s. Gordon Bray often referred to him as \\"the pig farmer from Taranaki\\" during his commentary broadcasts.

Mowat and Dr. Meredith J. Wilson in 1998. Presentation This autosomal dominant disorder is characterized by a number of health defects including Hirschsprung's disease, intellectual disability, epilepsy, delayed growth and motor development, congenital heart disease, genitourinary anomalies and absence of the corpus callosum. However, Hirschsprung's disease is not present in all infants with Mowat‚ÄìWilson syndrome and therefore it is not a required diagnostic criterion.Todo A, Harrington JW. New-onset seizures in infant with square facies, hypospadias, and Hirschsprung disease. Consultant for Pediatricians. 2010;9:103-107. Distinctive physical features include microcephaly, narrow chin, cupped ears with uplifted lobes with central depression, deep and widely set eyes, open mouth, wide nasal bridge and a shortened philtrum. Causes The disorder is expressed in an autosomal dominant fashion and may result from a de novo loss of function mutation or total deletion of the ZEB2 gene located on chromosome 2q22. Diagnosis Treatment Prognosis There is no cure for this syndrome. Treatment is supportive and symptomatic. All children with Mowat‚ÄìWilson syndrome required early intervention with speech therapy, occupational therapy and physical therapy.

He played college football at the University of Southern California. Early years Smith was a prep All-American at Charlton-Pollard High School, where he played for his father W.R. Smith. He acquired his nickname in a junior high school Spanish class, from \\"El Toro\\" (bull), because he was the largest boy in his class. College career He attended Michigan State University, before transferring to the University of Southern California after his sophomore year, where he became a standout defensive tackle and a member of the original \\"Wild Bunch\\". Smith teamed in the defensive line with Al Cowlings, Jimmy Gunn, Willard \\"Bubba\\" Scott, and Charlie Weaver to form in 1969 \\"The Wild Bunch,\\" which was key for USC to compile a 10-0-1 record and a No. 3 ranking after a victory over the Michigan Wolverines in the 1970 Rose Bowl. The Wild Bunch was a hit movie in 1969 and it was Cowlings who dubbed the defensive line 'The Wild Bunch' for their reckless abandon and hard-nosed style of play. Playing in an era of powerful running games, they allowed just 2.3 yards per carry and a league-low 95.6 rushing yards a game. Smith was one of the five USC African American starters (along with Sam Cunningham, Jimmy Jones, Clarence Davis and Charlie Weaver), that played against an all-white University of Alabama football team, winning 42‚Äì21 in Birmingham on September 12, 1970. This game was historically significant, because it was a factor in convincing the University of Alabama and its fan base to accelerate the integration of its football team. He played two seasons (1969‚Äì70) for the Trojans. In 1969, he was honorable-mention All- PAC-8 and in 1970 he was a second-team All-American, even though he played only four games as a senior, after spraining an ankle in the second game. There is a statue of him and the other four \\"Wild Bunch\\" defensive linemen at USC's Heritage Hall. He also appeared in the famed gunslinger photo of the five of them. Professional career Dallas Cowboys Smith was selected by the Dallas Cowboys in the 1st round (25th overall) of the 1971 NFL Draft, after dropping because of an ankle injury he suffered in college. This injury limited him to only 7 games during his rookie year. He spent the first seven games of the season on the team's taxi squad, but when he joined the regular roster, he showed the Cowboys he had a future in the NFL and even contributed in the Cowboys win in Super Bowl VI. Although he had surgery during the off- season on an injured knee, head coach Tom Landry seemed convinced Smith had the capability to start in 1972. He had a disappointing second year where he only played 10 games. On May 9, 1973, he was traded along with wide receiver Billy Parks to the Houston Oilers, in exchange for their first and third round draft picks in the 1974 NFL Draft. For the first time in their history, the Dallas Cowboys would have the first overall draft choice which they used to select defensive end Ed \\"Too Tall\\" Jones, who would play a key role on the Cowboys Super Bowl teams in the 1970s. With the third round pick they acquired, the Cowboys selected quarterback Danny White, who became the starting quarterback during the 1980s after the retirement of Roger Staubach. Houston Oilers Smith was a starter for the Houston Oilers for the next 3 seasons, before being waived injured with an ankle sprain in 1976. Buffalo Bills On November 23, 1976, he was claimed off waivers by the Buffalo Bills. He played in only 2 games and retired at the end of the season. Tampa Bay Buccaneers On July 11, 1977, he was signed as a free agent by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, but was released before the season started on September 1st. Personal life Smith's brother was actor and former NFL Pro Bowler Bubba Smith. Like his brother, Tody appeared in a few films, including The Hollywood Knights and eventually became his agent. Smith was married to Chae Castillo, a professional model/actress. They had a daughter (Rheo Smith) and a son (Dakota Castillo-Smith). He died in his sleep at his home in Los Angeles on July 18, 1999.

The museum was established in 1915, when Louise Caldwell Murdock‚Äôs Will which created a trust to start the Roland P. Murdock Collection of art in memory of her husband. The trust would purchase art for the City of Wichita by ‚ÄúAmerican painters, potters, sculptors, and textile weavers.‚Äù The collection includes works by Mary Cassatt, Arthur G. Dove, Thomas Eakins, Robert Henri, Douglas Abdell, Winslow Homer, Edward Hopper, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, John Marin, Paul Meltsner, Horace Pippin, Maurice Prendergast, Albert Pinkham Ryder and Charles Sheeler. The Museum's lobby features a ceiling and chandelier made by Dale Chihuly. The museum opened in 1935 with art borrowed from other museums. The first work in the Murdock Collection was purchased in 1939. Mrs. Murdock's friend, Elizabeth Stubblefield Navas, selected and purchased works of American art for the Murdock Collection until 1962. The building was enlarged with a new lobby and two new wings in 1963. In 1964, a foundation was established for the purpose of raising funds for new acquisitions. In the 1970s, the city built a new and larger climate controlled facility. In 2003, the museum finished another expansion project giving the building 115,000 total square feet. In January 2020, the museum announced that it would begin renovation on its main entrance and lobby.

Programmers and scripts often use the exit status of a command to assess success (exit status zero) or failure (non-zero) of the command. The \`true\` and \`false\` commands represent the logical values of command success, because true returns 0, and false returns 1.Not to be confused with the truth values of classical logic: true (1 or T) and false (0 or ‚ä•). Usage The commands are usually employed in conditional statements and loops of shell scripts. For example, the following shell script repeats the echo hello loop until interrupted: while true do echo hello done The commands can be used to ignore the success or failure of a sequence of other commands, as in the example: make ‚Ä¶ && false Setting a user's login shell to \`false\`, in /etc/passwd, effectively denies them access to an interactive shell, but their account may still be valid for other services, such as FTP. (Although \`/sbin/nologin\`, if available, may be more fitting for this purpose, as it prints a notification before terminating the session.) The programs take no \\"actual\\" parameters; in the GNU version, the standard parameter \`help\` displays a usage summary and \`version\` displays the program version. Null command The true command is sometimes substituted with the very similar null command, written as a single colon (\`:\`). The null command is built into the shell, and may therefore be more efficient if true is an external program (true is usually a shell built in function). We can rewrite the upper example using \`:\` instead of \`true\`: while : do echo hello done The null command may take parameters, which are ignored. It is also used as a no-op dummy command for side-effects such as assigning default values to shell variables through the \`\${parameter:=word}\` parameter expansion form.

(–§-22 –£–°–í or –£–°–í)) was a 76.2 mm cannon produced in the Soviet Union. It was adopted for Red Army service in 1939 and used extensively in World War II. The gun was designated as \\"divisional\\" - issued to batteries under the direct control of division headquarters. The F-22 USV was an intermediate model, coming between the F-22, which had limited anti-aircraft capability, and the simpler and cheaper ZiS-3, which eventually replaced it in production and service. Description The USV had a split-trail carriage with suspension; metal wheels with rubber tires were borrowed from the ZiS-5 truck. The gun featured semi-automatic vertical sliding breech block and Bofors-type cradle; recoil mechanism consisted of hydraulic recoil buffer and hydro-pneumatic recuperator. Sights and elevation controls were located on different sides of the barrel. The chamber fitted the standard model 1900 cartridge, which meant that the gun could use ammunition manufactured for older 76.2 mm divisional and regimental guns. Development history USV in H√§meenlinna Artillery museum, Finland. In 1937, unsatisfied with both the obsolete 76-mm divisional gun M1902/30 and the new, but flawed 76 mm divisional gun model 1936 (F-22), Red Army command (RKKA) initiated development of a new gun. The requirements, issued in March that year, specified elevation of 45¬∞ and combat weight of no more than 1,500 kg. The gun was supposed to have the same ballistics as the M1902/30 and use the same ammunition. Three design bureaus joined the program - Kirovskiy Plant bureau under I. A. Makhanov, No. 92 Plant bureau under V. G. Grabin, and AKB-43 (KB AU) under M. N. Kondakov. The L-12 of Kirovskiy Plant was the first to reach ground tests (in April‚ÄìMay 1938), was returned for revision, tested again in August and given to the RKKA for further trials. Grabin's gun went through ground tests in March‚ÄìApril 1939 and was also given to the army. Although its designation - F-22 USV or simply USV - suggested that the gun was only an upgrade of the F-22, in fact it was a completely new design. The third competing project, OKB-43's NDP, failed ground tests in April 1939. RKKA tested the remaining designs from 5 June to 3 July 1939 and was generally satisfied with both of them. The USV was found to have less \\"childhood diseases\\" and was therefore recommended for production. The USV entered production in 1939; 140 pieces were built until the end of the year and 1,010 more in 1940. In 1941, production was stopped as the plan for divisional guns was already fulfilled. Moreover, RKKA considered transition to larger caliber divisional guns, such as the 107 mm gun model 1940 (M-60). With the German invasion in 1941, production was reopened at No. 92 and the Barrikady factory in Stalingrad; it amounted to 2,616 pieces in 1941 and 6,046 in 1942. From late summer of 1941 the gun was being gradually replaced in production by yet another of Grabin's design - ZiS-3 - and by the end of 1942 the process was completed. Organization and service RKKA According to the organization of 1939, each rifle division had two artillery regiments: a light regiment with a battalion of 76 mm guns in three batteries of four guns, and two mixed battalions with one battery of 76 mm guns and two batteries of 122 mm howitzers, and a howitzer regiment of 20 75 mm guns. In June 1940 a battalion of 76-mm guns was removed, only 8 guns remained. In March 1942 a third mixed battalion (a battery of 76 mm and a battery of 122 mm) was added, which brought the number of 76 mm guns to 12. Guards rifle divisions from December 1942 had three artillery battalions (two batteries of 76 mm guns and one battery of 122 mm howitzers each), totaling 24 76-mm guns. From December 1944 they were reorganized to have an artillery brigade of three regiments, including a light regiment with 20 76 mm guns. From June 1945, all rifle divisions were reorganized identically. Motorized divisions had two mixed battalions (one battery of 76 mm guns, two batteries of 122 mm howitzers), totaling 8 76-mm guns. Cavalry divisions until August 1941 also had 8 76-mm guns, then their divisional artillery was removed and in summer of 1942 restored again. Rifle brigades from 1939 had 8 76 mm divisional guns; motorized and mechanized brigades had 12. Cavalry corps from late 1942 had artillery battalion of 12 pieces. Tank and artillery corps in late 1944 received light artillery regiment with 76 mm guns (24 pieces). The USV was also used by artillery units of the Reserve of the Main Command, namely: anti- tank artillery brigades (24 pieces, from 1942 - tank destroyer brigades with 16 pieces), by light artillery brigades (60-72 pieces) and by breakthrough artillery divisions (light brigade with 72 pieces, from 1944 - with 48 pieces). By 1 June 1941, the Red Army possessed 1,070 USVs. Many were lost in combat, but some remained in service until the end of the German-Soviet War. It's not clear whether the gun saw combat in the earlier Winter War. Other operators PaK 39(r). Note the muzzle brake. In 1941‚Äì42 the Wehrmacht captured hundreds of USVs and adopted them as field guns, designated 7.62 cm F.K.297(r). By March 1944 359 pieces were in service, including 295 in the West, 40 in Denmark and 24 in the East. Some USVs in German service were converted to anti-tank guns, designated 7.62 cm PaK 39(r). The modifications included rechambering for a bigger cartridge, addition of a muzzle brake, and elevation controls moved to the left side of the barrel where the sights resided. All those guns were of pre-war production, as guns produced during the war had weaker breech part. The exact number of converted pieces is unknown,; according to some sources there were up to 300. Anti-tank performance is also hard to determine. During trials held in 1943 a projectile from a captured gun penetrated the front armor of the KV tank (75 mm at 60¬∞) from 600 m. As an interim solution, it was decided to use the anti-tank gun for the Marder III tank destroyer. The Finns captured nine of these guns. They were designated 76 K 39, war journals from 12.01.1940 show that some of the guns were given to the 6th battery in Lapland after the failure of the notorious Bofors 105mm mountain guns due to the extreme cold.http://digi.narc.fi/digi/view.ka?kuid=1650562 The Romanian Army captured a number of these guns during Operation Barbarossa. They were later put into service with the artillery units of infantry divisions to replace the losses of 75 mm field guns. Two F-22USV are preserved in front of the Military Museum in Oradea. Variants *USV - pre-war variant. *ZiS-22-USV - war-time variant. Breech parts identical with F-34 tank gun were used. There were changes in barrel construction and suspension, new ZiS-13 sights, more cast details. in production from 15 July 1941. *USV-BR - variant produced by \\"Barrikady\\" plant. Differed in barrel construction and suspension. Summary The USV was an improvement over its predecessor, the F-22. However it was still too big and heavy and had the same inconvenient placement of sights and elevation controls on different sides of the barrel, making the gun less effective in an anti-tank role. Those shortcomings led to its replacement by the lighter and easier to produce ZiS-3.

It contains two species: the common eland T. oryx and the giant eland T. derbianus. Taxonomy Taurotragus is a genus of large African antelopes, placed under the subfamily Bovinae and family Bovidae. The genus authority is the German zoologist Johann Andreas Wagner, who first mentioned it in the journal Die S√§ugthiere in Abbildungen nach der Natur, mit Beschreibungen in 1855. The name is composed of two Greek words: Taurus or Tauros, meaning a bull or bullock; and Tragos, meaning a male goat, in reference to the tuft of hair that grows in the eland's ear which resembles a goat's beard. The genus consists of two species: * Common eland (Taurotragus oryx) (Pallas, 1766) : Three subspecies of common eland are recognized, though their validity has been in dispute. :* T. o. livingstonii (Sclater, 1864) (Livingstone's eland): Found in the Central Zambezian miombo woodlands. It has a brown pelt with up to 12 stripes. :* T. o. oryx (Pallas, 1766) (Cape eland): Found in south and southwest Africa. The coat is tawny, and adults lose their stripes. :* T. o. pattersonianus (Lydekker, 1906) (East African eland or Patterson's eland): Found in east Africa. Its coat can have up to 12 stripes. * Giant eland (Taurotragus derbianus) (Gray, 1847) : The largest antelope in the world. It has two subspecies: :* T. d. derbianus J. E. Gray, 1847 ‚Äì western giant eland, found in western Africa, particularly Senegal to Mali. Its coat is rufous, and can have up to 15 stripes. :* T. d. gigas Heuglin, 1863 ‚Äì eastern giant eland, found in central to eastern Africa, particularly Cameroon to South Sudan. Its coat is sandy, and can have up to 12 stripes. Taurotragus is sometimes considered part of the genus Tragelaphus on the basis of molecular phylogenetics. Together with the bongo, giant eland and common eland are the only antelopes in the tribe Tragelaphini (consisting of Taurotragus and Tragelaphus) to be given a generic name other than Tragelaphus. Although some authors, like Theodor Haltenorth, regarded the giant eland as conspecific with the common eland, they are generally considered two distinct species. Genetics and evolution The eland have 31 male chromosomes and 32 female chromosomes. In a 2008 phylogenomic study of spiral-horned antelopes, chromosomal similarities were observed between cattle (Bos taurus) and eight species of spiral-horned antelopes, namely: nyala (Tragelaphus angasii), lesser kudu (T. imberbis), bongo (T. eurycerus), bushbuck (T. scriptus), greater kudu (T. strepsiceros), sitatunga (T. spekei), giant eland and common eland. It was found that chromosomes involved in centric fusions in these species used a complete set of cattle painting probes generated by laser microdissection. The study confirmed the presence of the chromosome translocation known as Robertsonian translocation (1;29), a widespread evolutionary marker common to all known tragelaphid species. An accidental mating between a male giant eland and a female kudu produced a male offspring, but it was azoospermic. Analysis showed that it completely lacked germ cells, which produce gametes. Still, the hybrid had a strong male scent and exhibited male behaviour. Chromosomal examination showed that chromosomes 1, 3, 5, 9, and 11 differed from the parental karyotypes. Notable mixed inherited traits were pointed ears as the eland's, but a bit widened like kudu's. The tail was half the length of that of an eland, with a terminal tuft of hair as in kudu. Female elands can also act as surrogates for bongos. The bovid ancestors of the eland evolved approximately 20 million years ago in Africa; fossils are found throughout Africa and France but the best record appears in sub-Saharan Africa. The first members of the tribe Tragelaphini appear 6 million years in the past during the late Miocene. An extinct ancestor of the common eland (Taurotragus arkelli) appears in the Pleistocene in northern Tanzania and the first T. oryx fossil appears in the Holocene in Algeria. Previous genetic studies of African savanna ungulates revealed the presence of a long-standing Pleistocene refugium in eastern and southern Africa, which also includes the giant eland. The common eland and giant eland have been estimated to have diverged about 1.6 million years ago. Differences between species Both the species of eland are large spiral- horned antelopes. Though the giant eland broadly overlaps in size with the common eland, the former is somewhat larger on average than the latter. In fact, the giant eland is the largest species of antelope in the world. Eland are sexually dimorphic, as the females are smaller than males. The two eland species are nearly similar in height, ranging from . In both species, males typically weigh while females weigh . The coat of the common eland is tan for females, and darker with a bluish tinge for males. The giant eland is reddish- brown to chestnut. The coat of the common eland varies geographically; the eland in southern Africa lack the distinctive markings (torso stripes, markings on legs, dark garters and a spinal crest) present in those from the northern half of the continent. Similarly, the giant eland displays 8 to 12 well-defined vertical white torso stripes. In both species the coat of the males darken with age. According to zoologist Jakob Bro-J√∏rgensen, the colour of the male's coat can reflect the levels of androgen, a male hormone, which is highest during rutting.

Thoralf Skolem had considered the Skolemizations of formulas in prenex form as part of his proof of the L√∂wenheim‚ÄìSkolem theorem (Skolem 1920). Herbrand worked with this dual notion of Herbrandization, generalized to apply to non-prenex formulas as well, in order to prove Herbrand's theorem (Herbrand 1930). The resulting formula is not necessarily equivalent to the original one. As with Skolemization, which only preserves satisfiability, Herbrandization being Skolemization's dual preserves validity: the resulting formula is valid if and only if the original one is. Definition and examples Let F be a formula in the language of first-order logic. We may assume that F contains no variable that is bound by two different quantifier occurrences, and that no variable occurs both bound and free. (That is, F could be relettered to ensure these conditions, in such a way that the result is an equivalent formula). The Herbrandization of F is then obtained as follows: * First, replace any free variables in F by constant symbols. * Second, delete all quantifiers on variables that are either (1) universally quantified and within an even number of negation signs, or (2) existentially quantified and within an odd number of negation signs. * Finally, replace each such variable v with a function symbol f_v(x_1,\\\\dots,x_k), where x_1,\\\\dots,x_k are the variables that are still quantified, and whose quantifiers govern v. For instance, consider the formula F := \\\\forall y \\\\exists x [R(y,x) \\\\wedge eg\\\\exists z S(x,z)]. There are no free variables to replace. The variables y,z are the kind we consider for the second step, so we delete the quantifiers \\\\forall y and \\\\exists z. Finally, we then replace y with a constant c_y (since there were no other quantifiers governing y), and we replace z with a function symbol f_z(x): : F^H = \\\\exists x [R(c_y,x) \\\\wedge eg S(x,f_z(x))]. The Skolemization of a formula is obtained similarly, except that in the second step above, we would delete quantifiers on variables that are either (1) existentially quantified and within an even number of negations, or (2) universally quantified and within an odd number of negations. Thus, considering the same F from above, its Skolemization would be: : F^S = \\\\forall y [R(y,f_x(y)) \\\\wedge eg\\\\exists z S(f_x(y),z)].

In addition to playing a wide variety of instruments, Hurley is also a cartoonist and a painter. Hurley's music has been described as \\"outsider folk\\".http://www.furious.com/perfect/michaelhurley.htmlhttps://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/folk- heart/Content?oid=890821 Career Before starting his recording career Hurley contracted mononucleosis and needed to wait several years until he could sign to a record label. Hurley's debut album, First Songs, was recorded for Folkways Records in 1963 on the same reel-to-reel machine that taped Lead Belly's Last Sessions. He was discovered by blues and jazz historian Frederick Ramsey III, and subsequently championed by boyhood friend Jesse Colin Young, who released his 2nd and 3rd albums on The Youngbloods' Warner Bros. imprint, Raccoon. In the late 1970s, Hurley made three albums for Rounder, all of which have since been reissued on CD. His 1976 LP Have Moicy!, a collaboration with the Holy Modal Rounders and Jeffrey Frederick & The Clamtones, was named \\"the greatest folk album of the rock era\\" by The Village Voice's Robert Christgau. In 1996, Koch Records released Wolfways with Hurley backed by Mickey Bones on drums. Tours with Son Volt and high praise from younger performers like Lucinda Williams, Vic Chesnutt, Woods, Calexico, Cat Power, Julian Lynch, and Robin Holcomb followed. In 2001, Locust Music reissued Hurley's debut under the new title Blueberry Wine with new artwork contributed by Hurley. Gnomonsong released a new Michael Hurley album titled Ancestral Swamp on September 18, 2007. Backing was provided by longtime Hurley associate David Reisch of the Holy Modal Rounders and new friends Tara Jane O'Neil and Lewi Longmire. In 2010, Secret Seven Records (San Francisco) and Mississippi Records (Portland) teamed up to reissue 100 copies of Hurley's rarest album, Blue Navigator, on 8-track tape. (Hurley is a long-time collector of music on 8-track tapes.) In 2011, Hurley's first book of lyrics was released by the Quebec book publisher L'Oie de Cravan. It contains the original English lyrics to 19 of his songs calligraphed by the author, a foreword by critic Byron Coley and a French version by Marie Frankland, winner of the 2007 John-Glassco prize for translation. Hurley performed at the annual Nelsonville Music Festival in 2008 and 2010-2018.\\"Nelsonville Music Festival.\\" Nelsonville Music Festival, n.d.

His song, Hog of the Forsaken, was used in the closing credits for the pilot episode of the series and the closing of Deadwood: The Movie. He currently lives in rural northwest Oregon and performs frequently in and around Portland. Personal life Michael Hurley grew up in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and began playing and writing songs at the age of 13. He recorded his first album, First Songs at the age of 22. He also lived in New Jersey, Massachusetts, California, Vermont, Ohio, Florida, and most recently in Oregon. Michael Hurley self-published at least three magazines. The Underground Monthly, The Outcry, and The Morning Tea. He also created several comic books featuring Jocko and Boone, Greenbriar Kornbread, and Mama Molasses, among other characters. Hurley likes to call himself Elwood Snock, Doc Snock, Snockman, The Snock, or Snock. Hurley has done much of the artwork for his own albums. Two oft-featured cartoon werewolves, Jocko and Boone, have been something of a theme across Hurley's musical career, even appearing in their own comics. Both are based on dogs that Hurley's family owned when he was a child. Michael Hurley has three children with his former wife, Marjorie, whom he called \\"Pasta\\", two sons, Jordan and Colorado, and a daughter, Daffodil. With a girlfriend, Kim, he shares a son, Rollin.

This gun was used in conflicts between the USSR and Japan on the Far East, in the Winter War and in World War II. Many F-22s were captured by the Wehrmacht, modernized by the Germans and used against Soviet forces. Description The F-22 was a semi-universal gun which combined the capabilities of a divisional gun and - to some extent - of an anti-aircraft gun. It had a split-trail carriage with suspension and steel wheels with rubber tires. The gun was equipped with a semi-automatic vertical sliding breech block; the recoil mechanism consisted of a hydraulic recoil buffer and a hydro-pneumatic recuperator. The sights and the elevation controls were located on different sides of the barrel. The chamber fitted the standard model 1900 cartridge, which meant that the gun could use ammunition of older 76.2-mm divisional and regimental guns. Development and production history F-22 displayed outside the Finnish Military Museum in Helsinki. F-22 in H√§meenlinna artillery museum, Finland. In the early 1930s the RKKA command considered the idea of universal guns - i.e. guns which could be used both as field and anti-aircraft weapons. Mikhail Tukhachevsky, the head of the ordnance department between 1931 and 1934, ordered the development of universal (with 360¬∞ traverse) and semi-universal divisional pieces. Among other artillery design bureaus joining the program were the design bureau of the \\"Krasniy Putilovets\\" plant (L-1 and L-2 universal guns), the design bureau of the no. 8 plant (semi-universal guns 25K, 31K and 32K) and GKB-38 (universal A-52 and semi-universal A-51). GKB-38 was closed in 1933, and V. G. Grabin, the leading developer of the team that was working on the A-51 project - became the head of a design bureau of the new Novoye Sormovo (no. 92) plant in Gorky. In 1934 the A-51 - redesignated F-20 - was finished, but Grabin wasn't satisfied with the result and started to work on a new gun, the F-22. In April 1935 three prototypes of the F-22 were ready, two of them with split- trail carriages. All prototypes had muzzle brakes and lengthened chambers for a new experimental shell (7.1 kg, muzzle velocity 710 m/s, range up to 14,060 m). Factory trials started on 8 May; on 9 June prototypes were brought to the Sofrinsky firing ground near Moscow. On 14 June the gun, along with other artillery pieces, was demonstrated to the country leaders including Joseph Stalin. The F-22 made a good impression and was sent for ground testing, which was finished on 16 December. In July 1935 the plant was required to produce 10 pieces. In March 1936 four guns were given to the RKKA for testing, which continued until 22 April. Despite some shortcomings, on 11 May 1936 the gun was adopted as the 76 mm divisional gun model 1936 (F-22) (). The final model lacked a muzzle brake (which - the army said - raised too much dust, revealing the position of the gun) and was rechambered for the model 1900 cartridge to allow use of old 76.2 mm ammunition. The F-22 was produced by two plants, no. 92 and Kirov Plant, possibly also by \\"UZTM\\" (Ural Heavy Machinery Building Plant). Production rate was slow because of more sophisticated construction compared to older guns and because of constant need to fix faults in the design. In 1936 only 10 pieces were produced, in 1937 - 417, in 1938 - 1,002, in 1939 - 1,503. Production was stopped due to adoption of a new gun, the 76 mm divisional gun model 1939 (USV). Organization and service RKKA According to the organization of 1939, each rifle division had two artillery regiments - the light regiment (a battalion of 76 mm guns in three batteries of four guns; two mixed battalions with one battery of 76 mm guns and two batteries of 122 mm howitzers) and the howitzer regiment, totaling 20 76 mm guns per division. In June 1940 the battalion of 76 mm guns was removed, and only 8 guns remained. In March 1942 a third mixed battalion (a battery of 76 mm and a battery of 122 mm) was added, which brought the number of 76 mm guns to 12. Motorized divisions had two mixed battalions (a battery of 76 mm guns, two batteries of 122 mm howitzers), totaling 8 76 mm guns. Cavalry divisions until August 1941 also had 8 76 mm guns, then the divisional artillery was removed. The F-22 was also used by anti-tank artillery brigades (24 pieces), from 1942 by tank destroyer brigades with 16 pieces, and by light artillery brigades (60-72 pieces). The F-22 saw combat for the first time in the Battle of Lake Khasan in 1938. The gun was also used in the Winter War. On 1 June 1941 RKKA possessed 2,844 F-22s. Many were lost, but a limited number remained in service until the end of the war. For example, two artillery regiments (40 pieces) took part in the Battle of Kursk. It was mostly employed as a field gun, sometimes as anti-tank gun and was apparently never used as anti-aircraft weapon. Other operators 7.62 cm FK 36(r) at CFB Borden. In 1941-42 the Wehrmacht captured hundreds of F-22s. Initially they were adopted as field guns, designated FK 296(r). In late 1941 it was decided to rebuild the gun as an anti-tank weapon, 7.62 cm PaK 36(r). The modifications included rechambering for a bigger cartridge, a modified recoil system, elevation controls that were moved to the left side of the barrel where the sights resided. Additionally the elevation was limited and most of the guns received a muzzle brake. New ammunition was produced for the gun. The PaK 36(r) reached the battlefield in the spring of 1942. 560 pieces were converted and some of them were used to arm Marder II and Marder III tank destroyers. Nine F-22s in the original configuration were mounted on Sd.Kfz. 6 halftrack tractors, resulting in the Sd.Kfz. 6 mit 7.62 cm FK 36(r). In Romania, some captured F-22s were mounted on a T-60 light tank chassis to create the TACAM T-60 self- propelled gun. 34 units were built. The Finnish Army captured 29 guns and bought an additional 47 from German surplus stocks during World War II. The gun was called 76 K 36 in Finnish service. The gun was in active service until the 1960s and was stored until the 1990s. Summary The very idea of a 76 mm divisional gun with anti-aircraft capabilities was doomed for the following reasons: *An anti-aircraft gun needs powerful ballistics and 360¬∞ traverse, which makes the gun unnecessarily big and expensive for a divisional gun. *The main purpose of frontline anti-aircraft guns is protection from dive bombers and low-altitude aircraft, against which small-caliber autocannons are much more effective than a 76 mm gun. In case of the F-22, the attempt produced a gun which was both a poor anti-aircraft weapon and a mediocre field piece. It lacked 360¬∞ traverse and its muzzle velocity fell behind that of even the old 76 mm AA gun model 1915/1928 (730 m/s). The breech automatic mechanism was failing at elevations higher than 60¬∞, reducing the rate of fire. After initial investigations, the RKKA apparently dropped the idea of using the F-22 as anti-aircraft gun - the gun was never equipped with AA shells and with sights suited for the role. There are no reports about actual use of the gun against aircraft. As a divisional gun, the F-22 also had significant shortcomings. It was relatively large and heavy, which limited its mobility. Employment in the anti-tank role was hindered by inconvenient placement of sights and elevation controls on different sides of the barrel. The gun was hard to produce and unreliable. It offered some advantages in range and armor- piercing capability over the 76-mm divisional gun M1902/30, but wasn't significantly better. As a result, in 1937 requirements for a new divisional gun were issued, eventually resulting in the F-22USV. However, its German derivative, the 7.62 cm PaK 36(r), performed well in the anti-tank role.

There are no residences at this intersection, however, its name is attributed to the surrounding area. Gilberts Corner is named after the gas station/restaurant that sits at the northeast quadrant of the crossroads. It gained prominence in the 1920s when the Carolina Road (now Watson Road) was a toll road and U.S. Route 15 was extended south from Leesburg to U.S. Route 50. Due to increased traffic from toll evaders, U.S. Route 15 eventually was extended even farther south. The gas station/restaurant closed in the 1980s and is currently in the process of being renovated. Due to heavy traffic in the area, many commuters avoided the intersection altogether by going through Lenah and taking U.S. Route 15 south.  Traffic improvements  On May 1, 2008, Sen. John Warner, Congressman Frank Wolf, and Supervisor Jim Burton attended a groundbreaking ceremony that is launching an improvement of the intersection. As part of a traffic calming initiative suggested by the Piedmont Environmental Council (PEC) and the Route 50 Traffic Planning Task Force, the suggestion was made to replace the signalized intersection with several roundabouts. As of May 2008, a connector road to the east of Gilbert's Corner on Route 50 was being constructed to intersect Route 15 south of the existing intersection. Roundabouts were to be used rather than traffic lights. In fall 2008, the main intersection itself was to be turned into a roundabout, and traffic lights removed. After this, traffic calming was to occur in Aldie, with the road being narrowed in order to slow down traffic. All work was supposed to be complete by Fall 2009. The PEC reports its involvement in the planning, construction, and improvement to the roundabout, in particular, its taking ownership of a 141- acre farm property and selling a nearby 68-acre property to the Northern Virginia Regional Park Authority (NVRPA). On the weekends, Gilbert's Corner serves as an outdoor market place with a farmer's market and several food vendors that has become very popular among locals and tourists visiting Virginia's wine and horse country. In September 2013, the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) announced changes to be made in the roundabout to address a high number of crashes caused by speeding. By November 2013, VDOT adjusted curb lines, markings and signs, and created a single lane on all approaches from routes 15 and 50. The U.S. Federal Highway Administration cited the Gilberts Corner Roundabout in its Livability in Transportation Guidebook: Planning Approaches that Promote Livability: > \\"Outcomes and Results \\"The traffic calming plan was adopted by the > Middleburg Town Council and the Loudoun and Fauquier County Board of > Supervisors in 1997, and was recognized by the ITE President‚Äôs Award for > Excellence.

Overview The TNG was established in April‚ÄìMay 2000 at the Somalia National Peace Conference held in Arta, Djibouti. It was militarily and politically opposed by the Somalia Reconciliation and Restoration Council, which was formed by faction leaders including Hussein Mohamed Farrah Aidid and Mohamed Dhere. In principle, the Transitional National Charter, which gave rise to the TNG, recognized de facto regional autonomy and the existence of new entities in the north of the former Somalia, home to relatively homogenous clans. In some parts of Somalia, however, decentralization meant state authority disintegrated.Women and Gender Equality in Peace Processes: From Women at the Negotiating Table to Postwar Structural Reforms in Guatemala and Somalia, Sumie Nakaya, Global Governance Vol. 9, No. 4 (Oct.‚ÄìDec. 2003), pp. 459-476 According to Le Sage, the TNG in 2002 had all of the organs of a national government, including executive and judicial structures as well as a parliament, a police force and standing army. However, its institutions remained very weak on account of a dearth of basic office equipment, lack of territorial control, and inability to raise tax revenue. Due to these limitations, the TNG was unable to provide basic social services. Ministers and legislators also often expressed frustration at being shut out of the real decision-making process, and of often receiving irregular and limited salaries. As such, Le Sage argues that the public officials served more as symbols of the potential for a broad-based, national government.Somalia: Sovereign Disguise for a Mogadishu Mafia, Andre Le Sage,Review of African Political Economy, Vol. 29, No. 91, (Mar., 2002), pp. 132-138 The TNG's internal problems led to the replacement of the prime minister four times in three years, and the administrative body's reported bankruptcy in December 2003. Its mandate ended at the same time. On October 10, 2004, legislators elected Abdullahi Yusuf Ahmed as the first president of the transitional federal government (TFG), the TNG's successor.Somali PM optimistic about rebuilding country He received 189 votes from the TFG Parliament, while the closest contender, erstwhile Somali ambassador to Washington Abdullahi Ahmed Addou, got 79 votes in the third round of voting.

Originally founded in 1890 as the high school for the town of Fort Howard (annexed into Green Bay in 1895), the school opened as West High School in 1910 and has occupied its current building since 1929.  History  The institution that would become West High School opened in 1890 as the McCartney School, in what then was the neighboring town of Fort Howard. With the annexation of Fort Howard into Green Bay in 1895, the two school districts merged, though the McCartney School (known as Old West High) would continue to operate until 1910, when West High School formally opened. The McCartney School later took on west-side 8th graders, becoming a precursor junior high school. West High School received a new building in 1926, and has occupied that building since.  Athletics  The school's mascot is a Wildcat. Its rivalry with Green Bay East High School is Wisconsin's longest consecutively-played high school football rivalry between in-state schools. In January 2014, the WIAA approved a realignment plan that moved both Green Bay East and Green Bay West out of the Fox River Classic Conference and into the Bay Conference starting in 2015-2016, which continued the East-West rivalry. West High School fielded Green Bay's first girl's basketball team, in 1911. The Wildcats have won three WIAA state championships, most recently in 2014 for girl's hockey (a cooperative team). They also won the Class A state title in boy's track and field in 1934 and 1954.  Performing arts  In the late 1900s, Green Bay West had a competitive show choir.

It is gaining cachet with realtors, developers and lenders. Workforce housing can refer to any form of housing, including ownership of single or multi-family homes, as well as occupation of rental units. Workforce housing is generally understood to mean affordable housing for households with earned income that is insufficient to secure quality housing in reasonable proximity to the workplace. Overview Consideration of workforce housing includes these four principal factors:Haughey, Richard M. (2002), ULI Land Use Policy Forum Report: Challenges to Developing Workforce Housing Washington, D.C., Urban Land Institute. ;Workforce: The term \\"workforce\\" is meant to connote those who are gainfully employed, a group of people who are not typically understood to be the target of affordable housing programs. Workforce housing, then, implies an altered or expanded understanding of affordable housing. Workforce housing is commonly targeted at \\"essential workers\\" in a community i.e. police officers, firemen, teachers, nurses, medical personnel. Some communities define \\"essential\\" more broadly to include service workers, as in the case of resort communities where one finds high real estate costs and a high number of low-paying service jobs essential to the local economy. Workforce housing may be targeted more generally at certain income levels regardless of type of employment, with definitions ranging from 50% to 120% of Area Median Income (AMI). ;Affordability: Mortgage lenders typically impose a limit of 28% to 36% of household income allowable for principal, interest, taxes and insurance (PITI). Pricing calculations aimed at renters, who represent approximately one third of US households, define a desirable workforce housing cost as at or below 30% of household income. Affordability is a function of the relationship between one's income and the housing costs of the area, which leads to variation in the percentage of AMI that may be used to describe people who might need workforce housing.DeCrappeo, Megan et al. (2010) Out of Reach 2010 NLIHC: National Low Income Housing Coalition, Retrieved 2011-01-29. ;Proximity: Most appropriately, \\"workforce housing\\" is located in or near employment centers. The expanding distance between gainful employment and housing made affordable by the income it provides has caused people to seek housing on the periphery of settled areas. This is cited as a contributor to urban sprawl, typified by traffic congestion, lengthy commutes, convenience stores and strip retail centers, and the rapid consumption of open space due to the building of new homes taking place at the outer edges of metropolitan areas where land is typically cheaper. While prevalent in US metropolitan areas, workforce housing issues may arise anywhere that land values or other restrictions on creation or availability of quality affordable housing units are constrained by zoning, market forces or physical boundaries. ;Quality and supply: In recent decades, federal programs have focused on providing housing subsidy or vouchers, or building and maintaining public housing projects for low income households. Housing affordability for all others has been supported mainly through programs for home buyers, especially through mortgage financing. Whether seeking to rent or to buy, in areas facing an identified shortage of workforce housing, such units as can be found in close proximity to workplaces are often of poor quality.American Housing Survey US Department of Housing and Urban Development, Retrieved 2011-01-29. New housing built during the economic boom has included low numbers of affordable units, affordable units are often means-tested to exclude all but the poorest residents, and the less expensive housing tends to be built at a distance where land is cheaper. Proximity to work often means a tradeoff in quality of housing stock, school quality, personal safety. In real terms, living in low quality housing or marginal neighborhoods is a tradeoff between access to income and access to resources such as rising home equity or quality education. History The concept of workforce housing has its early roots in the ski towns of Telluride and Aspen, Colorado. In 1974, in response to locals not being able to purchase homes due to the disparity between wages and the cost of homes and land rising sharply due to buyers from New York and Hollywood, a conference was organized at the Aspen Institute.Aspen/Pitkin Housing office Aspen Housing Authority, Retrieved 2011-01-30. In Aspen a plan was developed to create a secondary and separate \\"local worker\\" housing market which was based on local wages and affordability. One standard tool invented to create affordably priced homes for local workers that would stay affordable for future generations was a deed restriction, which in its most simple form states that to qualify for purchasing a home the applicant must live in the community, not own another home in the community, must work essentially full- time and must have lived in the community for a minimum period of time. Also, the owner can only sell the home to someone that meets the same criteria. Later provisions added over the years of \\"trial and error\\" include income restrictions to qualify, and capped rates on the amount of profit an owner is allowed to make in order to guarantees that the home will remain affordable forever. Three per cent per annum has been a justifiable number over the years. The workforce housing problem seemed to be an anomaly in the ski resorts, made worse due to limited land for development due to mountains and federally owned land, which made \\"sprawling\\" unrealistic. Instead, it seems to have been a precursor to the problems now facing vacation communities and metropolitan areas all around the country and the world. In the early 2000s record low mortgage interest rates spurred a nationwide surge in housing demand. Record housing construction and record housing prices in many communities drove land costs higher. Construction materials and labor costs, propelled by disastrous hurricanes in 2004 and 2005 that damaged or destroyed hundreds of thousands of homes in Florida and on the Gulf Coast, amplified the problem to create a critical dilemma: in many communities, average income households cannot afford a median-priced home.Paycheck to Paycheck 2010 National Housing Conference, Retrieved 2011-01-30. For a while, the low interest rates and availability of creative financing options bridged the gap between housing costs and income for some households, enabling people to obtain mortgages that consumed more than 30% of their income or to use rising equity in their home to compensate for the affordability gap. The subprime mortgage crisis and current economic downturn raise questions as to the ability financing tools and private developers to effectively solve current or future affordable housing shortages. Housing has played an important role in economic advancement and the growth of America's middle class. Federal housing policy has at times in the past created programs to assist the population currently targeted for workforce housing. For instance, after World War II the needs of returning veterans and the baby boom led to the GI bill which included provisions for favorable mortgage terms and fueled suburban development, creating affordable home ownership opportunities for a generation of Americans. Public housing projects also provided rental housing to many urban families. In later decades means-testing, white flight, and mismanagement would change the nature and perception of public housing, but in mid-century America they were still providing quality, affordable housing to thousands of working and middle-class families. A critical problem In major North American metropolitan areas, workers are often forced to commute farther and farther away from their place of work simply to find affordable housing. This phenomenon has been labeled \\"drive till you qualify\\" (for a mortgage loan).Today there exists a policy gap to fund workforce housing development. Federal programs through HUD or state governments are geared towards low income programs designed for people that make less than 60% of Area Median Income (AMI). One program is the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit which mainly spurs development of rental properties. Workforce housing is designed for people that make 50% to 120% of AMI‚Äîan income strata that is largely unserved and unaddressed by both Federal and State programs aside from FHA loans. Affordable housing for the working and middle classes is largely left to individual municipalities and counties to deal with. Families that fall into this income category have found it difficult to purchase a home that is located in the area in which they work, and that is adequate for their needs. In response, many families have taken to \\"driving for affordability\\", or \\"drive till you qualify\\" to own a decent home with quality schools and a low crime rate. This set of circumstances has caused average commuting time to expand. It often necessitates ownership of a car which creates an added financial burden as gas prices rise. This trend has also caused congestion and the need to enlarge the highway system at huge costs. This trend has fueled homebuilding, but some municipalities have found it is difficult or impossible to generate enough new revenue from development to sustain or expand the infrastructure needed for this type of growth, which has come to be referred to as sprawl. Critics of suburbia describe a host of social costs stemming from these settlement patterns characterized by single-family homes, residential and commercial districts separated by zoning, and the lack of transportation alternatives to the personal vehicle in order to access employment, recreation, services and education. Bowling Alone is one such critique. An alternative to commuting is to locate housing close to the workplace. This option can be limited by price. An overall loss of affordable housing units to redevelopment and gentrification has contributed to the shortage in most cities. Remaining urban housing options are often undesirable due to issues of quality. Since the 1950s America's urban centers have suffered from pervasive social problems, exacerbated by the loss of working and middle class households, creating concentrations of extreme wealth and poverty. Urban redevelopment has enhanced the economic base of cities like with new office buildings and entertainment venues, hotels and tourist areas, and upscale apartment buildings. But without successful schools, safe playgrounds and neighborhoods, and other basic amenities, cities have failed to compete with neighboring suburbs to attract and retain moderate income residents. Issues such as crime, unstable property values, low quality rental stock, and high concentrations of poverty created by low-income housing projects, further deter people from choosing to live near work. Study and policy Systems like original Aspen scheme have not proliferated. However, the issue of workforce housing continues to affect non-metropolitan communities, particularly resort communities where one finds the acute effects of the triple impact of high land values, land limited by geographic features (i.e. coastline or mountains) and a prevalence of lower paying service-sector employment. Currently, the majority of advocacy and policy activity is centered on metropolitan areas with housing costs higher than the national average. The term \\"workforce housing\\" is appearing in policy discussions at national and state levels. While typically defined by local terms - area median income, fair market rent, and the employment base of the particular region - without the ability fund initiatives or to create sufficient incentives or mandates, it is difficult to have any impact on affordable housing. As with all affordable housing initiatives, local governments may use existing tools like inclusionary zoning, upzonings, density bonuses to create desired outcomes. Incentives may include waiver of fees like building permit fees, water and sewer fees. Real estate transfer taxes and retail sales taxes may provide funding in states where local governments have the power to raise revenue in this way. In Missouri, some examples of policy recommendations for changes at the state level that might accelerate creation of workforce housing include bond issues to fund projects, and mandated inclusion of workforce housing in the comprehensive plans required for the state's largest municipalities.Salsich, Peter et al. (2008) Affordable Workforce Housing - An Agenda for the Show Me State: A Report From an Interactive Forum on Housing Issues in Missouri St. Louis University Public Law Review, Volume XXVII:45, pp. 45-78, Retrieved on 2011-01-30 Metrics to define and address the issue of workforce housing are evolving. Many organizations cite the NLIHC report \\"Out Of Reach\\"Paycheck to Paycheck 2010 National Housing Conference, Retrieved 2011-01-30. which includes data maps to illustrate the mismatch between housing and incomes across the country. A 2010 report from the Washington, D.C. based non-profit Urban Land Institute entitled \\"Priced Out\\" is one example of in-depth study for a specific area. It provides an overview of workforce housing issues in the Boston Metropolitan Region.Patenaude, Pam et al. (2010) Priced Out: Persistence of the Workforce Housing Gap in the Boston Metro Area Urban Land Institute, Terwilliger Center for Workforce Housing, Washington, D.C., Retrieved 2011-01-29. ULI concludes that the Boston area is 25,000 units shy of the number needed to house the current workforce, and will face a shortage of an additional 11,000 units by 2020. While this example is drawn from one of the most acutely affected areas of the country, it illustrates the usefulness of defining the scope and scale of the problem as a necessary precursor to solving it. The report also includes examples of some typical Boston region families to illustrate that workforce applies to people who are typically perceived to be middle class, such as assistant college professors and civil engineers. Many workforce housing advocates hope that it may find broader support than previous affordable housing initiatives, because it is targeted towards essential members of the community and towards people who are perceived to be hard-working, good neighbors who will not negatively impact real estate values, and more deserving than those who are truly poor.

The drug aims to combat a range of illnesses, including skin cancer, restenosis, arthritis and macular degeneration. Trials of Dz13 were suspended in 2013. Mechanism of action Dz13 is a 10-23 DNAzyme that targets c-Jun, a transcription factor found in diseased blood vessels, eyes, lungs and joints. The treatment works by the DNA-based enzyme binding to and catalytically destroying its target messenger RNA, thereby inhibiting c-Jun expression in cells. Dz13 has underpinned the development of a library of programmable DNAzymes operable in a cellular environment. The potential of Dz13 as a therapeutic agent derives from the fact that inactivation of c-Jun can have an effect on downstream genes such as MMP-2, MMP-9, VEGF and FGF-2. Dz13 also inhibits the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF- alpha, interferon gamma and IL-6. Dz13 has been used with carriers such as cationic polymers for improved cellular delivery and efficacy. Dz13 in such polymers inhibits tumor cell proliferation and migration by suppressing levels of c-Jun and MMPs, reduces H1N1 and H7N2 viral replication and increases survival of mice infected with influenza A and suppresses c-Jun and solid tumor growth in biomimetic nanoballs. Dz13 has also been used in dermal drug delivery systems for enhanced skin penetration of DNAzyme. It has been reported off-target effects of Dz13, not related to the inactivation of c-Jun Effects Dz13 has been shown to inhibit skin cancer growth, angiogenesis and tumor angiogenesis and improve survival in mice infected with H5N1. Anti- cancer effects have been also demonstrated in models of prostate cancer, breast cancer and osteosarcoma. Clinical trials of Dz13 in patients with basal cell carcinoma commenced in Australia in 2010. In 2013 it was reported that Dz13 was safe and well tolerated after single intratumoral injection at all doses. c-Jun expression was reduced in the excised tumors of all patients injected and tumor depth decreased in the majority. This was the first report of the clinical use of a DNAzyme. The outcome of two other clinical trials evaluating DNAzymes performed in Asia and Europe were reported in 2014 and 2015, the former assessing an Epstein‚ÄìBarr virus latent membrane protein 1 targeting DNAzyme and the latter a DNAzyme targeting the transcription factor GATA3 which involved 7 trial sites. In both trials, there were no adverse events due to DNAzyme. There was demonstrable efficacy noted in nasopharyngeal cancer patients injected with LMP1 DNAzyme and allergic asthma patients following GATA3 DNAzyme inhalation. Investigations In 2013, trials of Dz13 were suspended after concerns were raised about alleged duplicated images in a 2010 paper. A series of investigations conducted by independent expert panels of inquiry under the Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research found genuine error and made no finding of misconduct.

A minor patriotic hero, he has occasionally appeared alongside Captain America and has been a member of the Guardians of the Galaxy. Publication history He first appeared in Captain America (1st series) #434 (December 1994), and was created by Mark Gruenwald and Dave Hoover. Fictional character biography Jack and his brother, Drake, were members of Captain America's computer hotline network. Together, they created a citizen's patrol group in their hometown Sandhaven, Arizona. Several criminals attacked Drake; the attack left him unable to use his legs. After the attack, Jack and Drake discovered that the Serpent Society had infiltrated their hometown and they had attempted to contact the local authorities. They found that law enforcement had been bribed by the Serpent Society. Jack, unhappy with this information, began training in martial arts and weight lifting so that he could fight the Serpent Society on his own. He took on a disguise becoming Jack Flag, an identity which he thought would make Captain America proud.Captain America #434 During a bank robbery, Jack intervened and stepped on Rock Python and Fer-de-Lance (both of whom were members of the Serpent Society). Shortly after this, Jack attempted to infiltrate the Society, but King Cobra did not fully trust Flag. King Cobra sent Jack to steal a painting from Mr. Hyde, who severely beat Jack. While fighting, Hyde's chemicals drenched Jack and he developed superhuman physical abilities. After receiving his new powers, Flag easily defeated Mr. Hyde and retrieved the painting. Before returning the painting to King Cobra, Flag contacted Captain America's hotline and informed them that the Serpent Society was in Sandhaven.Captain America #435-436 Impressed that he was able to defeat Mr. Hyde, Cobra tried out Jack as a new King Cobra. While Flag was undercover with the Serpent Society, Captain America, and his prot√©g√©, Free Spirit, showed up to aid Jack and defeat the Society. Jack followed Captain America and Free Spirit east, aiding them against ULTIMATUM, AIM, and Madcap. When Captain America believed he was dying, he charged Jack Flag, Free Spirit, Fabian Stankowicz and Zach Moonhunter with maintaining his hotline.Captain America #437-444 Civil War During the Civil War storyline, Jack Flag helped a woman escape a group of gangsters. Because of this, he is targeted by the new Thunderbolts for violating the Superhuman Registration Act.Thunderbolts #110 He is able to subdue almost all of the Thunderbolt's team. As he escaped, he is then stabbed in the spine by Bullseye, puncturing his cauda equina and apparently leaving him paralyzed. Bullseye states that Flag would \\"never walk again\\". Thunderbolts #111 He is then taken into custody, where he is severely beaten by an enraged Swordsman.

They discover that the future is in a perilous flux due to \\"The Fault\\": a multi-parsec wide tear in the fabric of spacetime. The tear was created as a result of Black Bolt of the Inhuman-led Kree Empire having detonated a bomb so powerful it ruptured the Dark Matter holding the universe together. The Guardians make their way through this odyssey, attempting to deliver a message to Adam Warlock, who is in the 21st Century just prior to the T-Bomb's Detonation. The Guardians are suffering symptoms of the broken time-stream. With Peter Quill, via the use of a Ba enslaved Celestial and the telepathic dog Cosmo, Warlock manages to stop the growth of the Fault. The tear remains, opening a door for greater perils: Warlock has become his evil self, The Magus, as a result of his saving the universe from destruction via the Fault's expansion, Star-Lord becomes geriatric, Mantis an infant, Bug an adolescent, Cosmo a puppy, and Jack Flag seem intangible. Starhawk reveals to him that this is due to Jack Flag's \\"unique nature\\". He informs him that it is Jack Flag's destiny to reshape the universe. This has yet to be further explored.

It was based on a Nikon F60 (Nikon N60 in the U.S.) film camera body that was modified by Fujifilm to include its own proprietary image sensor and electronics. Because of the Nikon body, it had a Nikon F lens mount and so could use most lenses made for Nikon 35 mm cameras. It was autofocusing, had an electronically controlled focal plane shutter with speeds from 30 sec. to 1/2000 sec. and built-in exposure metering and pop-up flash. Its ISO film speed equivalents ranged from 320-1600. The camera is no longer in production, having been superseded by the Fujifilm FinePix S2 Pro in January 2002. Aside from the Nikon lens mount, the camera's principal distinction was its unique (and controversial) 3.1 megapixel photo sensor. Known as the Super CCD, it was unique in having its photodiodes oriented diagonally rather than horizontally and vertically as in all other SLR cameras. This allowed the use of a sophisticated interpolation system that produced an output image equivalent to 6.2 megapixels. The apparent resolution of images in this interpolated mode lay somewhere between 3.1 megapixels and the 6.2 megapixel interpolated output.

He played college football at Texas, and signed with the Vikings as an undrafted free agent in 2004. Early years Loeffler attended Ingram Tom Moore High School in Ingram, Texas. He earned four varsity letters in both football and basketball. He also played in the UIL State Championship in doubles for tennis, winning the bronze in his junior year. Loeffler played several positions in high school football, including quarterback, wide receiver, tight end, defensive end and punter. College career Loeffler turned down several scholarship opportunities to enroll and walk-on at the University of Texas. He was redshirted his first year at Texas. The following year, as a redshirt freshman, he played a few snaps as a tight end and on the kickoff return team, as well as serving as the team's backup long snapper; at the end of the 2000 season, he was picked for the Academic All-Big 12 second team. He progressed to the Academic All-Big 12 first team for the only time in 2001, after playing in all 13 of the Longhorns' games, exclusively as the long snapper on punts. An ankle injury meant Loeffler missed the Longhorns' games against Houston and Tulane in 2002, but he finally took over long snapping duties for field goals and PATs for the last seven games of the season and was the team's Special Teams Player of the Week in week 2 for his two solo tackles against North Carolina. He then played in all 13 games in his senior year, and his performances earned him the Longhorns' Frank Denius Most Valuable Special Teams Player Award. He graduated in 2004 with a degree in finance. Professional career Loeffler was signed by the Minnesota Vikings as an undrafted free agent in 2004. The Vikings signed Loeffler to a three-year contract extension on October 7, 2011. He suffered a bone fracture in his lower back during a week 12 loss to the Atlanta Falcons and was placed on injured reserve on November 29, 2011, ending his season. In recognition of Loeffler's contribution to his record-breaking season, the Vikings' rookie kicker Blair Walsh offered to pay for Loeffler to join him in Hawaii for the 2013 Pro Bowl. Until the release of kicker Ryan Longwell by the Vikings in 2011, Loeffler, Longwell and punter Chris Kluwe were the longest-serving special teams trio in the league. During the 2014 off season Loeffler met a young entrepreneur Robbie Harrell on his way back home to Austin, TX according to the Twin Cities Business Magazine article \\"MN Viking Invests In 23-Year- Old's Ice Sculpture Business\\". Loeffler, was intrigued by Harrell‚Äôs 1-year-old business called Minnesota Ice Sculptures. After negotiation between Loeffler and Harrell's old business partner, Loeffler purchased half of MN Ice Sculptures for a five figure sum. Since the start of their relationship Harrell and Loeffler have started another venture called Wholesale Androids, a premium cell phone distribution company. Loeffler was cut from the Vikings on August 24, 2015 during the preseason. Personal life Loeffler is the son of Tom Loeffler, a former Republican member of the United States House of Representatives who also played football for the University of Texas under Darrell Royal. Loeffler married his wife, Jardin, in the 2006 offseason; they have a daughter, Landyn, and a son, Senate.

They have released two albums, Crash Test 01, Crash Test 02, and two remix EPs, Club Test 01 and Club Test 02. They have also released five singles. The original group, Eiffel 65, has reformed as of June 2010. The formation of Bloom 06 Shortly after the departure of Gabry Ponte from Eiffel 65, due to a desire to begin a project of his own, Maurizio (Maury) Lobina (born on 1973 in Asti, Italy) and Gianfranco (Jeffrey) Randone officially announced, on 15 June 2005, that they had permanently put the name Eiffel 65 behind them and they were ready to begin a new chapter in their artistic careers, releasing their current work under a new name which they had chosen as Bloom 06. The duo also confirmed that their debut album Crash Test 01 would be released on their brand new label Blue Boys, which would subsequently be distributed by Universal Italy in Fall of 2006. Through a press release published on a new Web domain, Bloom 06 explained: Members *Jeffrey Jey (real name Gianfranco Randone) ‚Äì Born in Lentini, Sicily, on January 5, 1970 - lead vocals, bass. *Maury Lobina (old name Apollo, real name Maurizio Lobina) ‚Äì Born in Asti, Piedmont, October 30, 1973 ‚Äì keyboards, guitar, backing vocals. Albums Their first album, titled Crash Test 01, was released in October 2006. It contained 8 tracks, 5 in English and 3 in Italian. The tracks were composed over the course of 2¬Ω‚Äì3 years, though during the time that Jeffrey and Maury were still working under Eiffel 65. This album was originally intended to be Eiffel's fourth album, but it was thought to be too dark for the band which until then had been characterized as playing upbeat and happy dance music. This partly contributed to Jeffrey and Maury's departure from Bliss Corporation. The band's second album is considered to be a 'second chapter' or 'second part' of Crash Test 01 and as such is entitled Crash Test 02. The album is said to contain lighter and more upbeat songs than the first. Crash Test 02 was originally scheduled have a much earlier release, but faced several delays, and was finally released on May 23, 2008. Prior to the album's release, Bloom 06 released multiple previews of various songs from their album on their MySpace page. The first song was Between The Lines, on February 12, 2008. After strong response from their fans, 3 other previews were added, Anche Solo Per Un Attimo, Un'altra Come Te, and Welcome To The Zoo. After an open vote from their fans, Bloom 06 reported on their MySpace that the first single released from Crash Test 02 will be \\"Un'altra Come Te\\". The single was released on iTunes on May 2, 2008., followed by the release of Crash Test 02 on May 23. The album was released on Italian iTunes and in Italian stores. On the 9 October, they announced that an EP of their recent songs from Crash Test 02 is going to be released by November 28, 2008. The EP also includes a remake of the hit song \\"Blue (Da Ba Dee)\\" from when they were Eiffel 65. A preview of the song was later posted on the Bloom 06 myspace website. On October 16, another preview was posted on their myspace. This preview is also another track from the new EP, Club Test 01, and is called \\"Being Not Like You\\" but a remixed track from the original song, and is the English version of the song \\"Un'altra Come Te\\". On December 22, a new remix of \\"Welcome To The Zoo\\" was posted on the Bloom 06 myspace website. It was said to be a full version of the song and was posted on the site before the song was released anywhere. On January 13, Bloom 06 posted a new remixed song called \\"Pop Porno\\" by Il Genio. Along with the news of their new remixed track, they've also posted new pictures from when they were on their new year exhibition in Pordenone. On February 10, Bloom 06 posted a new featured song called \\"We Is The Power\\" by Alexia. As Jeffery said that they go way back with Alexia, they have also announced the process of making their third studio album that has yet to be officially previewed on the official Bloom 06 Myspace and official website. Another EP, Club Test 02 was released on 22 June on the Italian iTunes, United States iTunes and the Irish iTunes, and on 3 July on CD. The EP contains two new songs, Beats and Sweat in extended and radio forms, Dancing on the Moon in a radio form, a remake of Eiffel 65's 2000 hit song Move Your Body, and another remix of Welcome to the Zoo.

Wiking Modellbau is a German manufacturer of scale models in H0 scale and N scale originally made as accessories for model train sets. Founded in 1932, traditionally the company was based post-World War II in West Berlin. Later factories were also used in Buer (near Essen) and Kiel. Now owned by German Siku Toys, in Ludenscheid, the company specializes in models of cars and trucks dating from the 1950s to the present day. Almost invariably models are produced in 1:87 \\"HO\\" scale. Pre War History Wiking was founded in 1932 by Freidrich Karl Peltzer who had built ships from cigar boxes in his youth (van de Beck 2010). Wiking's beginnings were in producing ship models in 1:1,250 scale (see McGeachy 2012). Before and during World War II these models, made of lead based zamac, were used by the German military for training and tactical planning (van de Beck 2010). They were usually marked \\"Wiking Modell\\" on their bases. The ships were accompanied by Modell- Hafen (Model Harbors) which were wood representations of piers, buildings and oil facilities to assist in attack training. The military also used new plane models in 1:200 scale beginning in 1934-35, and the so-called Wehrmachtsmodelle (1937‚Äì38) of military vehicles and artillery, were issued in 1:200 scale. Beginning in 1938, the planes and some of the ships were made of plastic. Wooden model ship by Wiking, useful in craft identification in wartime. Based on the Wehrmachtsmodelle, Wiking also made some civilian vehicles whose production ceased at the beginning of World War II.  War years  During the war, Wiking mostly produced models for the military for training in the identification of planes and ships, an important need during war time. Reportedly, the company employed forced labor, for example; workers from the USSR. Wiking Post-war After World War II, but before starting production of model cars, Wiking experimented with a variety of plastics such as for a Noah's ark model and for the molding of plastic combs and buttons. Some clay was also used in production. There was a small series of the Berlin Airlift (1948-1949) that consisted of five planes and two car models in 1:400 scale. At this time, Wiking opened several workshops, including those in Buer and Kiel. Opel Kapit√§n. In 1947, Wiking started to produce simple car models that usually consisted of a single part - with no windows or chassis. These were made of plastic in roughly 1:100 scale. Vehicle axles were made of wire with flat pinched ends, that when squeezed into the still warm plastic wheels, could not rotate - thus the axles rolled with the wheels. Later models included chassis bases. The scale was eventually changed to 1:90. Wiking began to expand its line of vehicles during the 1950s, offering both trucks and cars. Some offerings were Henschel stake and cement trucks, Magirus trucks, the Borgward Arabella, and DKW two door sedan. Many of these were offered in packs of five trucks or ten cars (Model Descriptions 2000-2013). Simple, all business Wiking H0 scale model fire vehicles In the early 1960s, Volkswagen's Wolfsburg plant commissioned vehicles in a larger 1:40 scale with unique company designed packaging. These are rather rare today - and often worth more than $100, though some of these larger scaled models have been reissued by the company (Doty 1996, p. 88-89). Particularly interesting was a Wiking Beetle promotional molded in a clear plastic body. It was labeled \\"Das Gl√§serne Auto\\" and available in a special red and blue display box with body, wheels, interior and seats displayed apart from each other (Wiking No date). The presentation with clear plastic body hit a chord and the idea was copied by several other manufacturers - even in Britain where one manufacturer produced its own 'glass' car (Ralston 2007, p. 15). Around the early 1960s, transparent windows were added to models. Interiors were added in the 1970s. For some models even the original paint from the car manufacturers is used. Today, the scale has been changed to the more uniform 1:87 (HO). Though this scale matches HO train scale (van de Beck 2010), various scales have been produced and Wiking models today are collected in their own right. The company website refers to \\"the delightful yet robust toy cars [that] fit in a trouser pocket\\" indicating their play value independent of other toys (All about No date). 1962 Thyssen tanker truck that achieved a record price at auction. Since 1969 Wiking has produced car models in 1:160 (N) scale - mostly for N-Scale model train sets. Between 1949/50 and 1974/75 Wiking again produced ship models. The company also tried to sell plane models again in the 1960s but this effort was cancelled. Some of these models were made for Ferrero, the Italian chocolate company, scaled down from 1:87 scale to fit inside Kinder Surprise chocolate eggs. Most of these vehicles, though nicely done like the VW bug convertible and the NSU Ro80, were made in Hong Kong. Some were apparently original models, not copies of previously existing Wiking cars. Today old Wiking models are often collector items which can be very expensive. The most expensive Wiking model ever sold is a Mercedes tank truck from 1962 which was produced as an advertising article for the Thyssen company. In June 2006 one of these tank truck models (shown above) sold for at an auction in Cologne. Contemporary Wiking In 1953 the workshops in Buer were closed, followed by the Kiel workshops in 1982. Mercedes-Benz 250 sedan taxi. Peltzer died in 1981 at the age of 78 (February 5, 1903 - November 20, 1981). Some collectors consider this to be the end of a golden era, leaving behind an era of many less expensive and unique stylized models - while a new era began of the mass production of expensive models in fewer liveries. In 1984, Wiking was sold to the Sieper L√ºdenscheid, known for its Siku model cars. Today's Wiking models try be perfectly detailed miniatures in their own right in a similar manner to their competitors (e.g. Herpa and Brekina). This is perhaps slightly different from the earlier philosophy of producing a variety of vehicles more oriented toward HO scale railroad sets. Another big change for the company came in September 2008, when it was announced the traditional home of the factory would be closed and all production would be transferred to the Siku / Sieper works in L√ºdenscheid (Wiking No date).

The Fujifilm FinePix S2 Pro is an interchangeable lens digital single-lens reflex camera introduced in January 2002. It is based on a Nikon F80 (N80 in the U.S.) film camera body that was modified by Fujifilm to include its own proprietary image sensor and electronics. Because of the Nikon body, it has a Nikon AF lens mount and so can use most lenses made for Nikon 35 mm cameras. It is autofocus ing, with an electronically controlled focal plane shutter with speeds from 30 sec. to 1/4000 sec., built-in exposure metering and pop-up flash. Its ISO film speed equivalents range from 100 - 1600. The S2 Pro also has sound recording capability. The camera is no longer in production, having been superseded by the Fujifilm FinePix S3 Pro in February 2004. Aside from the Nikon lens mount, the camera's principal distinction is its 6.17 megapixel photo sensor. Known as the Super CCD, it is unique in having its photodiodes oriented diagonally rather than horizontally and vertically as in all other DSLR cameras. This allows the use of a sophisticated interpolation system that produces an output image equivalent to 12.1 megapixels. The apparent resolution of images in this interpolated mode lies somewhere between 6.17 megapixels and the 12.1 megapixel interpolated output. A huge number of these cameras were built using a Sony sourced defective CCD that was subject to a recall by Fuji. The recall ended when the stock of these replacement CCD's was depleted. There is word that no other stockpiles exist of this Super HAD CCD, making these cameras that are found with the purple or black tinted image problems extinct, only usable for parts. The Fuji F700 used a similar defective HAD CCD, but in 3.1/6.2Mp size. That camera has met a similar fate.

Play Preliminaries The object of two-ten-jack is to get the most points by taking tricks containing positive point cards while avoiding tricks containing negative point cards. Two players receive six cards each from a standard 52-card deck ranking A K Q J 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 and the remaining undealt cards are placed between the players to form the stock. Non-dealer leads the first trick and winner of each trick leads to the next. Players replenish their hands between tricks by each drawing a card from the stock with the winner of the last trick drawing first. Play continues until all of the cards in the entire deck have been played. Points are then tallied before the deck is reshuffled and dealt anew. Following, Trumping, and Speculation In two-ten-jack a player may lead any card and the other player must play a card of the same suit if able, or otherwise must play a trump card if able. If a player has neither cards in the lead suit or trump, then any other card may be played. The highest trump card, or the highest card of the lead suit if no trumps were played, takes the trick In two-ten-jack hearts are always the trump suit and the ace of spades is a special trump card known as speculation ranking above all of the hearts. Rules for playing speculation are as follows: * If a trump (heart) is led, a player may follow with speculation and must play speculation if no other trumps are held in the hand. * If a spade is led, a player may follow with speculation and must likewise play speculation if no other spades are held in the hand. * If a club or diamond is led and the other player has neither of these, speculation may be played, and must be played if no other trumps are available. * A player leading speculation must declare it as either a spade or trump. Scoring and winning Cards are worth the following point values: * 2, 10 and J are worth +5 each * 2‚ô£, 10‚ô£ and J‚ô£ are worth -5 each * 2‚ô†, 10‚ô†, J‚ô† and A‚ô† are worth +1 each * 6 is worth +1 point Hence the total number of card points per deal is +5.

Each Olympic Games has its own Olympic emblem, which is a design integrating the Olympic rings with one or more distinctive elements. They are created and proposed by the Organising Committee of the Olympic Games (OCOG) or the National Olympic Committee (NOC) of the host country. It is the responsibility of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to approve Olympic emblems for the Olympic games. The Olympic emblems are used in promotional materials, by sponsors of the Olympics, on the uniforms of every Olympic competitor. All emblems are the property of the IOC. 2008 Beijing Olympic Emblem The emblem draws on various elements of Chinese culture, depicting a traditional red Chinese seal above the words \\"Beijing 2008\\" and the Olympic rings. The seal is inscribed with a stylised calligraphic rendition of the Chinese character ‰∫¨ (jƒ´ng, meaning 'capital', from the name of the host city) in the form of a dancing figure. The curves are also claimed to suggest the body of a wriggling Chinese dragon. The open arms of the figure symbolise the invitation of China to the world to share in its culture. The figure also resembles that of a runner crossing the finish line. Red, the dominant colour of the emblem, is an important colour in Chinese society, often signifying good luck. 2010 Vancouver Olympic Emblem Unveiling ceremony of the 2010 Winter Olympics emblem, Ilanaaq, April 23, 2005 The 2010 Winter Olympics logo was unveiled on April 23, 2005, and is named Ilanaaq the Inunnguaq.

The logo was based on the Inukshuk (stone landmark or cairn) built by Alvin Kanak for the Northwest Territories Pavilion at Expo 86 and donated to the City of Vancouver after the event. It is now used as a landmark on English Bay Beach. 2010 Singapore Youth Olympic Emblem 2012 Innsbruck Youth Olympic Emblem The official emblem for the first Winter Youth Olympics was presented during the 2010 Winter Olympics at Austria House in Whistler, Canada, and it reflects the vibrant, youthful city in the heart of the Alps combined with its traditional and natural way of life, while it includes the Goldenes Dachl, a famous landmark of Innsbruck. 2012 London Olympic Emblem The London 2012 Olympic emblem on the side of a plane The 2012 Olympic emblem is a representation of the number 2012, with the Olympic Rings embedded within the zero. It was surrounded by controversies and drew many complaints. Some say it resembled Lisa Simpson engaging in a sexual act with Bart Simpson, while others said it meant to spell out the word \\"Zion\\". This created tension in Iran, as the country then threatened to boycott the 2012 games. The font was heavily criticized, but was meant to display edginess and appeal to the younger generation through its look. The emblem wanted to use Olympic values such as pushing oneself to inspire the many people, especially the youth, that watched the games. Ultimately, the emblem worked to improve the world view of the city of London. Along with this, the emblem made no reference to any sport or landmark in London. This was to show that the games were open for everyone, not just people in London, or people of a specific sport. The Olympic emblem was also notable, because the designs were very similar for the Paralympic games. This worked to emphasize the idea that the games were meant for everyone. 2014 Sochi Olympic Emblem The 2014 Sochi emblem was designed to reach out to the newer generation by becoming the first emblem to have a web address in it. It was also one of only three emblems that was text only and did not contain an artistic element.

The creative process that led to the eventual emblem contained ideas that featured many more traditional or artistic components. Ultimately, this emblem was chosen because of it was \\"more future-oriented\\". One of the original emblem designs integrated Russian Khokhloma art, while another draft was more modern and contained physical representations of Russia. The emblem that was chosen worked to show a new up and coming side of Russia that contained elements of positive change. 2014 Nanjing Youth Olympic Emblem The design of the logo was presented in May 2011 and it commemorates Nanjing's rich history by incorporating the Gate of China and the features of some Jiangnan houses in the wording, while the various colors symbolize youths' energetic spirit and passion for sports and culture.

The logo was meant to embody the cariocas, or Brazilian locals. The people embracing each other in the emblem are meant to be welcoming and friendly, while the silhouette of the embrace is meant to outline the Sugarloaf Mountain. The people not only outline the mountain, but are meant to \\"embrace the city\\". The shapes of the body also spell out the word \\"Rio\\". The themes that the emblem represents are known as the \\"emblem pillars\\". The pillars included are centered around \\"passion and transformation,\\" and branch into smaller groups including: \\"harmonious diversity, Olympic spirit, exuberant nature, and captivating energy\\".

Launched in 1993, the brand has become a popular term to refer to indoor bicycles and indoor cycling fitness classes in the United States and throughout the world. History The Spinning indoor cycling program was developed by South African endurance bicycle racer Johnny Goldberg (known as Johnny G) in the mid-1980s after he was struck by a car while training for a race at night. Goldberg's early Spinning prototypes were targeted toward endurance athletes as a substitute for outdoor bicycle training, and allowed the athlete to train year-round regardless of outdoor weather conditions. In 1989 Goldberg opened the Johnny G Spinning Center, in Santa Monica, California, with bikes he built. In 1992 he moved the class to Karen Voight Fitness, in Hollywood, for more exposure. In 1993 Goldberg and his business partner, cycling enthusiast John Baudhuin, launched the Spinning indoor cycling fitness program in Santa Monica, California, through their business entity Mad Dogg Athletics, Inc. The first Spinning brand indoor cycling programs were held in Crunch gyms in New York, but were only regionally popular at that time. By 1994, however, Spinning made national news on Rolling Stone Magazine‚Äôs ‚Äúhot list as the ‚Äòhot exercise‚Äô you need to try.‚Äù Goldberg and Baudhuin made a deal with Schwinn, which debuted bikes at a trade show in 1995. The Spinning program expanded in the United States and worldwide. By 1996 there were more than a thousand Official Spinning Facilities spanning over 30 countries. Goldberg and Baudhuin trained thousands of instructors. ‚ÄúIt was uniquethe first time equipment, training, and philosophy was sold together,‚Äù Goldberg said in 2004. In 2003 Star Trac became the bike manufacturer. In 2004 Goldberg retired from Mad Dogg Athletics and the Spinning brand. In 2015 Mad Dogg Athletics partnered with Precor, a leading provider of personalized fitness solutions, to create a new line of commercial Spinner bikes. The partnership includes the development of three new commercial Spinner bikes along with collaborations on new products, marketing solutions and education programs in the future. Mad Dogg Athletics has trained over 200,000 instructors in its Spinning program and has reached millions of fitness enthusiasts in over 80 countries worldwide through a network of over 35,000 fitness facilities. Mad Dogg Athletics claims trademark ownership for the terms Spin, Spinner, Spinning, Spin Fitness, SPINPower, and the Spinning logo, among others. Possible generic term Spinning arguably has, over time, become a generic term in the United States, and a generic term cannot function as a trademark; but Mad Dogg Athletics has registered Spinning as a trademark on the Principal Register of the United States Patent and Trademark Office. A registration on the Principal Register does not create ownership rights under the laws of the United States, and a registration may be challenged and removed if the challenger proves as a matter of fact that the alleged trademark has become generic. Mad Dogg Athletics continues to defend the Spinning trademark against it being genericized and has recently expanded its focus and efforts on brand protection. Based on the brand's widespread popularity, it has potentially become a generic term for indoor cycling in the Czech Republic. However, in November 2018, the General Court (European Union) upheld Mad Dogg's rights and found that the brand was not a generic term. Related products To protect its trademark for the term Spinning, Mad Dogg Athletics commonly refers to its products and services as the \\"SPINNING brand,\\" ‚ÄúSPINNING indoor cycling,‚Äù ‚ÄúSPINNING certification,‚Äù and similar terms, not just \\"Spinning.\\" Manufacturing facilities are located internationally.

Marie-Th√©r√®se Levasseur (21 September 1721 - 12 July 1801; also known as Th√©r√®se Le Vasseur and Th√©r√®se Lavasseur) was the domestic partner of Genevan philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Biography Th√©r√®se Le Vasseur came from a respected family that had fallen on hard times; her father was a local official in Orl√©ans, and her mother was a merchant. Th√©r√®se and her mother moved to Paris to find work, and were later joined by her father. Le Vasseur met Rousseau in Paris in 1745. Le Vasseur was working as a laundress and chambermaid at the Hotel Saint-Quentin in the rue des Cordiers, where Rousseau took his meals. She was 24 years old at the time, he was 33. According to Rousseau, Th√©r√®se bore him five children, all of whom were given to the Enfants-Trouv√©s foundling home, the first in 1746 and the others in 1747, 1748, 1751, and 1752. They went through a legally invalid marriage ceremony at Bourgoin on August 29, 1768. Therese provided Rousseau with support and care, and when he died, she was the sole inheritor of his belongings, including manuscripts and royalties.

An immigrant from Poland, he and his wife Ida borrowed $300 from friends to start their business on Coney Island in 1916. As of 2016, Nathan's operates over 400 company owned and franchised restaurants in all 50 states and 17 foreign countries, and Nathan's brand products are found in some 45,000 stores across the United States.Nathan's retail product line  Biography  Handwerker was born in Galicia,Nathan Handwerker, 1973 interview in a former kingdom and constituent part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the partitioned Poland under the Austrian rule that roughly spanned the contemporary Poland-Ukraine border. One of 13 children of a poor Jewish shoemaker, he immigrated to the United States in 1912. Handwerker found work as a delivery boy and later obtained a job slicing bread rolls at Feltman's German Gardens, a restaurant in Coney Island, Brooklyn. The restaurant sold franks (hot dogs) for 10 cents each. By one account, Handwerker was encouraged by singing waiters Eddie Cantor and Jimmy Durante to go into business in competition with Feltman's; as United Press International noted in 1974, \\"There are many stories about Nathan and how the business began, but this is the way he told it...\\" The company's official history does not mention the encouragement of those two entertainers. Nathan and Ida spent their life savings of $300 to begin the business. That same year, with $300, Handwerker and his new wife, Ida Handwerker, opened a small hot dog stand with a two-foot grill on the corner of Surf and Stillwell Avenues in Coney Island. Abstract of subscription article. Note: Source gives age as 83, although Handwerker in Famous Nathan documentary gives his birth year as 1892, which agrees with June 14, 1892, birth date at the Social Security Death Index. They spiced their hot dogs with Ida's secret recipe and sold them for a nickel. Handwerker named his previously unnamed hot dog stand Nathan's Hot Dogs in 1921 after Sophie Tucker, then a singer at the nearby Carey Walsh's Cafe, made a hit of the song \\"Nathan, Nathan, Why You Waitin?\\" The food stand developed into the fast food chain Nathan's Famous, spearheaded by his son, Murray Handwerker. On March 23, 1974, Nathan Handwerker suffered a heart attack at his home in North Port Charlotte, Florida. He died March 24, 1974, per differing accounts at either St. Joseph's Hospital in Port Charlotte, Florida, or at Sarasota General Hospital, in Sarasota, Florida. He was buried at Mt.

After the extinction of the Groschlag male lineage, the village would have passed to the Archbishopric of Mainz but the population refused to accept this transition and paid homage to the daughters of the Groschlag family instead. The minister of the archbishopric, von Albini, consequently occupied the village with a force of 50 hussars. In 1806, the village fell to the Grand Duchy of Hesse.

The plant currently consists of 4.7 million square feet of production space and employs approximately 7,000 hourly workers represented by the United Auto Workers Local 249. The plant currently produces the Ford F-150 and the Ford Transit. It is the largest car manufacturing plant in the United States in terms of units produced. The plant is about northeast of the Kansas City, Missouri city center. Since its opening in 1951, the Ford Claycomo Plant, as many in the Kansas City area call it, has generated thousands of jobs, millions of tax dollars for the otherwise minor suburb, and is the largest tax generator in Clay County, Missouri. Current The on facility employs approximately 7,000 people. In addition to the main final assembly plant, KCAP also includes a stamping plant for the Ford Transit, a separate body shop and a separate paint shop for the Ford F-150. Plant tours were discontinued on September 12, 2001, the day after the September 11 attacks. In December 2010 Ford announced it was moving the Ford Escape and Ford Escape Hybrid to the Louisville Assembly Plant, which underwent $600 million in renovations. The move stirred fears that it could result in the loss of half the jobs at the 3,700-person plant. Missouri had been anticipating changes at the plant. In 2010 it passed the Missouri Manufacturing Jobs Act providing tax incentives for companies that invest in plants in the state by allowing them to keep employee withholding taxes. While the bill would benefit all industrial businesses it was specifically targeting the plant and was introduced by Jerry Nolte, whose district includes the plant. Ford could save $150 million over 10 years if it invests in the plant. The bill had been the subject of a filibuster by United States Senate candidate Chuck Purgason who objected to the favoritism extended to Ford and read aloud sections of Allan W. Eckert's The Frontiersman into the record. A day after the announcement of the move of the Escape, Ford said a yet to be announced line would replace the Escape. In 2011, Ford said it would spend $1.1 billion on additions and upgrades, including a new stamping plant. In 2012, it was announced that the plant would be the North American lead production site for the new Ford Transit, which replaced the now discontinued Ford E-Series vans.

He was joined on the hill by leader of the Opposition and former Prime Minister, John Diefenbaker, and Secretary of State, who was in charge of the Centennial, Judy LaMarsh as well as thousands of onlookers.

It is located near the Queen's Gates (the centre gate), in front of the stairs leading to the Peace Tower and Centre Block. The Centre Block is home to the House of Commons, the Senate and serves as an office building for MPs and Senators. The Centennial was celebrated across Canada in various ways; for example the re-enactment of the Battle of the Thames, the building of a destroyer out of match sticks, etc. The government also encouraged the building of a Centennial memorial in each of Canada's 10 provinces. The provincial and federal governments matched whatever the municipal government spent on their memorial, thereby encouraging the construction of grand buildings such as the National Arts Centre in Ottawa. The Centennial Flame is encompassed by a fountain into which many visitors to Parliament Hill throw coins for luck. That change is gathered, washed, dried and sorted by maintenance before it is put into a government bank account.

History In the 1940s and 1950s, as the Northwest Tollway (today's Interstate 90) was being routed through the Rockford area, local politicians debated the costs and benefits of various routings of the tollway. A crosstown route was considered, but turned down in favor of a location miles east of town. By the 1970s, the commercial center of Rockford had shifted from downtown to the East. In effort to draw residents and businesses back to the traditional center of town, the idea of a new crosstown expressway was born. The highway was to follow the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad line from near Interstate 39's interchange with U.S. Highway 20 all the way to downtown Rockford. The said interchange was built in 1984, designed to allow for future extension northward. Part of this highway would have replaced Woodruff Avenue, a street that parallels the railroad, giving the expressway its original name. The highway was later renamed for Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish diplomat noted for saving many Hungarian Jews in the Holocaust. The project was eventually abandoned due to its heavy financial costs and negative impacts the highway would have on its surrounding neighborhoods.

If you're fortunate enough to still have the original BOX that the robot came in, depending upon the condition, it could add well over $1000. to the overall value of the toy, and of course the better the condition of the box, the higher the premium. The best example (and most rare due to the dark green plastics and accessories included) of a mint-in-box Big Loo was sold in 2017 for a record $6495.00 on Ebay by the proprietor of BigLooRobot.com (also the exclusive supplier for exact high quality replicas of the original instruction sheets), and regularly offered museum quality robots with accessories are selling for $2500. to $4000. at Trademark Classics, the latter being one of the only toy shops in the USA that currently offers professional repair on the costly robots for individual clients and museum displays. As of Late June 2020 Big Loo has sold on Ebay consistently for between $800 and $1000, but, Also has been seen at 3 different Antique shops in Michigan and Ohio for between $400 and $600. As always something is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it. Book values go up and down and should be used for insurance evaluation. There was a purchase made of Big Loo without box in close to mint condition in early June 2020 for $350 with all parts. Big Loo was featured on the cover of the Los Lobos album Colossal Head.

It was a patent licensing firm until Micron and others purchased its patents. Headquartered in Munich, Qimonda was a 300 mm manufacturer and was one of the top suppliers of DRAM products for the PC and server markets. Infineon still controls a 77.5% stake, which it has written down (2008). Infineon was on record as having the aim of divesting itself of this stake, with the purpose of becoming a minority stakeholder in 2009. The company has issued 42 million ADR shares, each ADR share representing one ordinary share in Qimonda. At its height in 2007, Qimonda employed approximately 13,500 personnel worldwide, from whom 1,800 were employed in R&D; with access to four 300 mm manufacturing sites and operating six major R&D; facilities, and included a chip packaging complex in Vila do Conde, Portugal, and its lead R&D; center in Dresden, Germany, in total covering three continents. During this time, and on into September 2008, the price of DRAM continued to decline due to market oversupply, resulting in significant corporate financial losses throughout 2008. Meaning of Qimonda \\"Qimonda\\" is an invented name, which falls into the \\"evocative\\" class by branding agencies. These names are designed to evoke the qualities of the product or company rather than explain the actual goods or services the company supplies. Along with the new name, the company supplies an explanation of its meaning: \\"The name and brand identity of Qimonda express the philosophy and personality of the company, illustrating its vision and values. The word ‚ÄúQimonda‚Äù carries different meanings and allows associations in different languages. In Chinese, ‚ÄúQi‚Äù, pronounced as \\"ch-ee', stands for breathing and flowing energy, while ‚Äúmonda‚Äù denotes ‚Äúworld‚Äù in Latin-based languages. \\"Qi\\", when pronounced as a hard \\"k\\", suggests ‚Äúkey to the world‚Äù, a positive connotation.\\" Products and achievements Qimonda produced computing and consumer DRAM, graphics RAM, mobile RAM and Flash memory. Qimonda was primarily reliant on its Deep Trench technology in comparison to the stack capacitor systems of its rival manufacturers. Deep Trench has the benefit of a theoretically smaller footprint than its stack capacitor rival. With approximately one-third lower power consumption due to lower leakage currents, its natural advantages lie in mobile and laptop applications where power supply is a limiting factor. Although offering significant advantages, deep trench technology is technically difficult to manufacture and has led to slippage of Qimonda's technology shrink roadmap in comparison to many of its rivals in recent years. In 2008, Qimonda announced the development of its Buried Wordline Technology. Retaining many of the advantages of Deep Trench technology, in theory it simplifies the manufacturing process and the time provided Qimonda with a competitive technology shrink roadmap. Qimonda was among the first DRAM suppliers to transition a substantial portion of the manufacturing to 300 mm technology. Approximately 2/3 of the DRAM bits shipped were manufactured using 300 mm wafers by February 2007. All 200 mm manufacturing ended by January 2009. On September 18, 2006, Qimonda AG along with Nanya Technology Corporation announced the successful qualification of the 75 nm DRAM trench technology. Process structures of 75 nm further reduce chip size compared to the previous 90 nm technology thereby increasing potential chip output per wafer by about 40 percent. On November 1, 2007, Qimonda AG announced shipment of first GDDR5 samples. On February 3, 2009, Qimonda AG announced the first 46 nm working production chips using its Buried Wordline technology, fabricated at its Dresden 300 mm plant. Restructuring and decline Qimonda AG In October 2008, major restructuring was announced to try to reduce losses and re-align the company within the struggling DRAM sector. The restructuring saw the sale of Qimonda's interest in its largest 300 mm manufacturing site (Inotera, Taiwan - a joint venture between Nanya Technology and Qimonda AG, with QAG owning 35.6% at the time of sale) to its rival Micron Technology for approximately $400m in cash. Additionally, CEO Kin Wah Loh announced the closure by January 2009 of the company's single remaining 200 mm site as well as the adjoining 300 mm facility located in Richmond, Virginia. Other restructuring included the complete closure of the Raleigh R&D; facility and the termination of the back- end component and module manufacturing site in Dresden. Altogether, approximately 3000 employees would be made redundant by the changes (excluding the Micron buy-out of Inotera). With a historical emphasis on PC and server products, the company then focused on products for graphics, mobile and consumer applications using its power-saving deep trench technology. On October 28, 2008, Qimonda AG achieved the lowest share price of USD 0.19 on NYSE. On November 24, 2008, Qimonda AG achieved the lowest share price of USD 0.05 on NYSE. The company continued to lose money, and sought new investors to help keep the company afloat. The continuing fall in the spot price of commodity DRAM resulted in Qimonda‚Äôs 75 nm Deep Trench technology no longer being economically viable. The decision was taken in November 2008 to cease production of all commodity DRAM at their Dresden and Richmond 300 mm manufacturing sites. Until this point Richmond had predominantly produced graphics DRAM, whilst Dresden manufactured commodity DRAM. This left the Dresden site‚Äôs production capability severely under-utilised (although a significant proportion of the line utilization remained as technology development). All of the graphics manufacture was therefore transferred from Richmond to Dresden. Qimonda‚Äôs financial situation worsened during December and the company focused its efforts on securing additional financial support. On December 21, 2008, Qimonda AG issued a press release stating that they had secured a financial package of ‚Ç¨325 million for the ramp up of Buried Wordline technology. The package comprised a ‚Ç¨150 million loan from the German state of Saxony, ‚Ç¨100 million from an unspecified leading financial institution in Portugal, and ‚Ç¨75 million from Infineon, Qimonda‚Äôs parent company. In addition, they were provided with the opportunity to draw on ‚Ç¨280 million in the form of a state guarantee provided by the German federal government. In return, Qimonda agreed to commit to further development of their R&D; and manufacturing sites in Porto, Portugal and Dresden, and to quickly ramp up their 46 nm BWT to improve economies of scale at Dresden. Qimonda North America As a separate legal entity, Qimonda North America (QNA) remained technically solvent. However, without financial support from the parent company or access to revenue from sales (which went to Qimonda AG) there were few options available to QNA. On September 16, 2008, Qimonda North America announced that no funding would be issued for merit increases or promotions as part of the year-end appraisal process in order to reduce costs. On October 13, 2008, Qimonda North America announced that it was closing its 200 mm wafer fabrication plant in Richmond, VA, resulting in the loss of 1200 jobs. On October 27, 2008, Qimonda North America announced that the approved incentive payments due to be paid to employees that month had been postponed until January 16, 2009, for Richmond employees and February 13, 2009, for QNA-direct employees. Qimonda North America announced mandatory unpaid leave in December, 2008 for all employees at its Richmond site amounting to a 10% salary reduction for exempt staff and approximately 15% reduction for non-exempt employees. The mandatory unpaid leave was expected to last until the beginning of April 2009. On February 3, 2009, Qimonda North America announced the closure by April of its remaining 300 mm wafer fabrication plant in Richmond, VA. This is the first known closure of an operating 300 mm production fab. Over the next two months, 1500 employees would be laid off without severance pay. Five hundred employees were made redundant within 24 hours of the announcement. A further 500 were to be made redundant over the coming month. The remainder were to be made redundant as the plant equipment is sold or mothballed by the beginning of April. Bankruptcy and Litigation Qimonda AG Qimonda AG and Qimonda Dresden OHG filed for insolvency protection on January 23, 2009 (similar to Chapter 11 bankruptcy in U.S. courts), stating that the promised bailout package had not become available in time.Chiphersteller Qimonda stellt Insolvenzantrag tagesschau.de They requested the insolvency protection be backdated to January 1, 2009. However, subsequent media reporting of the event suggests that the agreement to the package fell apart at the last minute, and so was not available. It is reported that shortly prior to filing, Qimonda had requested a further ‚Ç¨300 million on top of the already-agreed ‚Ç¨325 million. The backers then refused to meet the demands.Update: Qimonda files for insolvency The company also published its yearly accounts, which had been delayed several times from its normal release date at the end of October 2008. This showed a drop in net sales to ‚Ç¨1.79 billion, down from the previous year's filing of ‚Ç¨3.61 billion. The Munich court appointed Dr. Michael Jaff√© as administrator. Dr. Jaff√© is a lawyer who specialises in insolvency and restructuring. His most famous previous case was his handling of the collapse of the KirchMedia group. In a press release, CEO Kin Wah Loh stated, ‚ÄúGerman insolvency laws offers the opportunity to accelerate the restructuring process that has already been started in order to reposition the company back onto a solid base‚Äù. Under German law, the operating costs (including salaries) are underwritten by the government for three months. This means that Qimonda had until March 31, 2009 to secure a solution to its current insolvency issues. In the days after the announcement, general DRAM spot market prices increased by a peak of 26% from their lowest recorded levels in January. However, within a month of the announcement they had returned to their previous level. The Dresden site plodded ahead with 46 nm Buried Wordline development and produced the first working samples at the beginning of February 2009. It was hoped that the improved technological and cost advantages of the BWL technology would attract new investors or business partners before insolvency cover ends on March 31, 2009. On March 13, 2009, according to EETimes, Qimonda in Dresden ceased all DRAM production for the time being. \\"We have not pulled the plug, we just went to standby-mode,\\" a spokesperson explained. The company together with the administrator had been searching for fresh capital, but it was not possible to finalise a deal by the end of March, which was the end of the insolvency period. The 300 mm Dresden plant will be idled until such time as its future has been decided. Without either a partner to purchase Qimonda or an investor to recapitalise Qimonda, Qimonda's existence as an ongoing concern was dubious at best. Michael Jaffe, the insolvency administrator appointed by a German bankruptcy court, announced that Qimonda is closer to liquidation. By then, Qimonda Richmond was down to a skeleton crew of approximately 60 people, including 10 staff managers. Prior to the layoffs, the level of staff managers was 10 as well. On March 16, 2009, China's Inspur ended talks to buy Qimonda. On April 14, 2009, Qimonda laid off 800 employees in Portugal. Qimonda North America On or about Feb 7, 2009, a laid-off Qimonda employee began legal proceedings against Qimonda North America (QNA) for recompense for two months' worth of pay and benefits in a federal class-action lawsuit. The suit alleges that employees were not given their 60-day written notice of termination or 60 days' severance pay required under the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (dubbed WARN). Qimonda argued that the ‚Äúfaltering company‚Äù exemption under WARN applies, which allows the company to fail to give notice where such advance notice may inhibit the company‚Äôs ability to find capital or business with which to continue operating. Several class action lawsuits were filed. On February 18, 2009 (two days before filing for bankruptcy), the Richmond Times-Dispatch posted an article stating that QNA CFO Miriam Martinez sent out notices to previously laid-off employees informing them that Qimonda North America and Qimonda Richmond were now not in a financial position to honor its severance agreements to those affected employees from the (previous) 200 mm line closure announced in October 2008. Qimonda North America Corp. and Qimonda Richmond LLC filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on February 20, 2009 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Delaware. In their filing, the company lists more than $1 billion in assets and liabilities each, and estimated between 10,000-25,000 creditors. The files‚Äô listing of top 30 creditors shows a total of over $54.2 million owed to traders. QNA CFO Miriam Martinez issued a statement announcing that under the conditions of the bankruptcy filing, all those employees made redundant by the company on or before the date of bankruptcy could no longer be paid any credit due without court authority. This meant that QNA employees who had not already been paid severance would no longer receive any salary, unused vacation time or severance owed to them. This affected the majority of the workforce. Employees' due costs under VISA regulations would also receive no compensation. Those employees remaining with the company from February 20 onwards would only receive pay and benefits from that day forward, up to a maximum of $10,950. Therefore, no payment would be made to those employees for the work performed between February 7 and February 20. As a result of the bankruptcy filing, due to the unpaid wages, unpaid vacation balances, no severance, the unpaid severance of those who have severance agreements, and no 60 days' notice of a plant closure as required by the WARN Act, former workers at Qimonda LLC and Qimonda NA in Richmond, VA have decided to file a class action lawsuit against Qimonda to try and recover the unpaid wages, unpaid vacation balance, unpaid severance, and to get 60 days pay for a plant closure as required by the WARN act. The workers were paid before unsecured creditors (e.g., vendors), but after secured creditors. All for a small fraction of their previous entitlement. The Delaware Bankruptcy Court judge agreed to approve a $35.3 million WARN settlement in August 2011.Mordock, Jeff, \\"Judge OKs $35 Million Settlement in WARN Act Case\\", Delaware Law Weekly via Docs.Google, 2011-08-24. Retrieved 2012-08-09. The Richmond site was only capable of manufacturing Qimonda's 75 nm Deep Trench technology chips with the manufacturing equipment available there. The concurrent DRAM pricing did not make this a viable manufacturing prospect given the financial situation due to the graphics chips, which were developed by the Richmond fab, being transferred to Dresden by Qimonda AG prior to shutting down Qimonda LLC. Because Dresden was the core DRAM development site, manufacturing equipment capable of producing their (at the time, developmental) 46 nm Buried Wordline chips, with its reduced manufacturing cost benefits, was already on site. A corporate decision was taken to consolidate losses by closing the Richmond site. The Richmond fab would not be capable of 46 nm BWL manufacture without substantial new equipment investment, requiring money that Qimonda did not have. Qimonda AG, however, moved the 75 nm video DRAM processes, which commanded a price premium over commodity PC DRAM products, from Richmond to Dresden in the months prior to shutting down Richmond. Transferring the graphics chips process away from Richmond made the situation at Qimonda LLC intractable. On April 2, 2009, Qimonda put the Richmond, VA site for sale. On June 22, 2009, Qimonda Richmond is filing a petition in bankruptcy court to allow 46 employees to receive a bonus payment totaling $1.24 million. However, as one may recall, Qimonda declared bankruptcy on Feb. 20, 2009 in Federal Court in Delaware. As a result, many employees did not receive their final paycheck, nor did many employees receive cash in lieu of their vacation balance. On June 25, 2009, the bankruptcy court in Delaware allowed Qimonda Richmond to pay out a $1.24 million bonus to 46 employees as a part of a \\"shut down\\" bonus. No mention was made concerning those who hadn't received their vacation pay or a severance or in some cases, their final paycheck. On July 1, 2009, former Qimonda employees gathered outside of Qimonda Richmond to protest the $1.24 million payout bonus to 46 employees. Virginia State Delegate Joe Morrissey of the 74th district was present at the protest. In May 2010, the Qimonda signs were permanently removed from the Sandston, Virginia facility. The Sandston facility was purchased by Quality Technology Services and converted into a massive datacenter. Legacy A Qimonda 2 GB DDR2-800 SODIMM Module Qimonda's knowledge-base and collection of 20,000 patents remain very valuable. It was one of only three companies in the world to have mass produced GDDR3, GDDR5, and XDR memory. Winbond of Taiwan was able to achieve relatively good gross margins using trench technology licensed from Qimonda. Winbond is now successfully mass producing 65 nm buried wordline DRAM at this time and, among DRAM manufacturers, is currently the gross margin leader in Taiwan. This attests to the quality of Qimonda's intellectual property. Qimonda is also finished with litigation versus Rambus over intellectual property. However, Winbond manufactures both trench capacitor and stacked capacitor technology. Additionally, Winbond manufactures Flash Memory, SRAM, as well as some legacy DRAM products (DDR, DDR2). Moreover, the trench process is being produced only down to 90 nm, whereas the stacked capacitor process is being produced at the 65 nm lithography. Therefore, the comparison between Winbond and other DRAM manufacturers is an apples and oranges comparison. Qimonda's graphics DRAM was used both in the Nintendo Wii game console (Qimonda GDDR3 graphics DRAM) and in Microsoft's Xbox 360.game console uses Qimonda graphics DRAM Since bankruptcy, Qimonda AG i.L. and its U.S. subsidiary Qimonda Licensing LLC are technology licensing companies that focus on marketing Qimonda's IP portfolio. Alliances Qimonda's strategic alliance with Nanya Technology Corporation (e.g. the joint-venture Inotera) ended shortly before the buy-out by rival chip-maker Micron Technology when Nanya declined the offer of joint development of Qimonda's Buried Wordline technology. Inotera will continue to supply DRAM to Qimonda until approximately mid-2009. Qimonda has other strategic alliances with China- Singapore Suzhou Industrial Park Venture Co., Ltd., SMIC, Winbond Electronics Corporation, IBM, Altis, AMD (for ATI graphics products), Toppan Photomasks, Spansion, and Sandisk.

Iron John: A Lover's Tale Mother Jones Magazine Mar-Apr 1993. p. 26‚Äì33 (1937-1992) was an American aikido pioneer, aikido teacher and writer. Dobson is one of the Western aikido practitioners who studied directly under the founder of aikido, Morihei Ueshiba.  Early life  Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts to a wealthy family on June 9, 1937 and moving to New York City in 1940, Dobson had a tumultuous childhood. Raised by his alcoholic mother and stepfather, he did not meet his real father, who had been disgraced after it was discovered that he forged his degree to get into Harvard Business School, until his late teens. Terry went to the Buckley School and then Deerfield Academy, both prestigious private schools, where he excelled at American football. After receiving a scholarship to play at Franklin & Marshall, he quickly failed out and trained for a summer with the New York Football Giants under Vince Lombardi, the line coach at the time. He was a US Marine doing helicopter maintenance during the Lebanon crisis of 1958, and attended New York University for a brief period. In 1959 he went to Japan to assist in rural development and teach English.  Discovering aikido  During a visit to Tokyo, Dobson witnessed a demonstration of what was then the little-known martial art aikido on an American military base in Yokohama. He instantly fell in love with the art and six months later entered the Aikikai Hombu Dojo as an uchi-deshi (live-in student), and trained as uchi-deshi until his marriage in 1964. He was one of only two non-Japanese to enjoy this privilege during that early era, the other being Andr√© Nocquet. He continued to train at the Hombu Dojo until Ueshiba's death in 1969.  Spreading Aikido in the US  In 1970 Dobson returned to the US where he gave seminars around the country and with Ken Nisson co-founded Bond Street Dojo in New York City and Vermont Aikido in Burlington, Vermont.Our Dojo. Bond Street DojoDojo History. Vermont Aikido In 1979 he moved to San Francisco, California and became involved with Robert Bly and his Mythopoetic men's movement, still teaching aikido as a visiting sensei. Death In 1984 he became ill with what was misdiagnosed as sarcoidosis and moved to Vermont to recover. His teaching trailed off and eventually stopped as he became weaker and weaker. After a change in medication his health improved and he started teaching again in Vermont. Though not fully healthy, he flew to California to give a Men's Conference and teach aikido in 1992. After teaching a class in San Francisco, he fell into a coma. On August 2, 1992, he died in an ambulance in Inverness, California of a heart attack. Dobson is survived by his daughter Marion, son Daniel, and partner Riki Moss.

Strobili are often called cones, but some botanists restrict the use of the term cone to the woody seed strobili of conifers. Strobili are characterized by a central axis (anatomically a stem) surrounded by spirally arranged or decussate structures that may be modified leaves or modified stems. Leaves that bear sporangia are called sporophylls, while sporangia- bearing stems are called sporangiophores. Lycophytes Some members of both of the two modern classes of Lycopodiophyta (Lycopodiopsida and Isoetopsida) produce strobili. In all cases, the lateral organs of the strobilus are microphylls, bearing sporangia. In other lycophytes, ordinary foliage leaves can act as sporophylls, and there are no organized strobili.

Sphenophytes The single extant genus of Equisetophyta, Equisetum, produces strobili in which the lateral organs are sporangiophores. Developmental evidence and comparison with fossil members of the group show that the sporangiophores are reduced stems, rather than leaves. Sporangia are terminal. Image:Equisetum_hyemale.jpgStrobilus of Equisetum Image:Equisetum sylvaticum 240405.jpgStrobilus of Equisetum Image:Equisetum strobilus wm.jpgLiquid- preserved strobilus of Equisetum, showing sporangiophores Image:Equisetum strobilus xs of wm showing sporangiophores.jpgCross-section of liquid- preserved strobilus of Equisetum, showing sporangiophores bearing sporangia Seed plants With the exception of flowering plants, seed plants produce ovules and pollen in different structures. Strobili bearing microsporangia are called microsporangiate strobili or pollen cones, and those bearing ovules are megasporangiate strobili or seed cones (or ovulate cones). Cycads Cycadophyta are typically dioecious (seed strobili and pollen strobili are produced on separate plants). The lateral organs of seed strobili are megasporophylls (modified leaves) that bear two to several marginal ovules. Pollen strobili consist of microsporophylls, each of which may have dozens or hundreds of abaxial microsporangia. Image:Dioon edule04.jpgDioon edule, seed cone Image:Cycas circinalis - sago palm - desc-top of trunk.jpgCycas circinalis, pollen cone Image:Cycas microsporangia.jpgAbaxial surface of Cycas revoluta microsporophyll, showing microsporangia Ginkgos The single living member of the Ginkgophyta, Ginkgo biloba produces pollen strobili, but the ovules are typically borne in pairs at the end of a stem, not in a strobilus. When there are more than a pair of ovules in \\"G. biloba\\", however, or when fossil taxa bearing large numbers of ovules are examined, it is clear that the paired ovules in the extant species are a highly reduced strobilus. Image:Ginkgo biloba Inflorescences.jpgPollen cones of Ginkgo Image:Ginkgo pollen cone wm.jpgPollen cone of Ginkgo, showing microsporophylls each with two microsporangia Conifers Pollen strobili of Pinophyta are similar to those of cycads (although much smaller) and Ginkgoes in that they are composed of microsporophylls with microsporangia on the abaxial surface. Seed cones of many conifers are compound strobili. The central stem produces bracts and in the axil of each bract is a cone scale. Morphologically the cone scale is a reduced stem. Ovules are produced on the adaxial surface of the cone scales. Gnetophytes Gnetophyta consists of three genera, Ephedra, Gnetum and Welwitschia. All three are typically dioecious, although some Ephedra species exhibit monoecy. In contrast to the conifers, which have simple pollen strobili and compound seed strobili, gnetophytes have both compound pollen and seed strobili. The seed strobili of Ephedra and Gnetum are reduced, with Ephedra producing only two ovules per strobilus and Gnetum a single ovule.

Image:Gnetum gnemon BotGardBln1105C.JPGSeed cones of Gnetum Flowering plants The flower of flowering plants is sometimes referred to as a bisexual strobilus. Stamens include microsporangia within the anther, and ovules (contained in carpels) contain megasporangia. Magnolia has a particularly strobiloid flower with all parts arranged in a spiral, rather than as clear whorls. A number of flowering plants have inflorescences that resemble strobili, such as catkins, but are actually more complex in structure than strobili.

This evolutionary convergence is not unusual, since the form of a strobilus is one of the most compact that can be achieved in arranging lateral organs around a cylindric axis, and the consolidation of reproductive parts in a strobilus may optimize spore dispersal and nutrient partitioning. Etymology The word strobilus is related to the ancient Greek strobilos = whirlwind. References * Gifford, E. M. & Foster, A. S. (1988). Comparative morphology of vascular plants, 3rd ed.

Argument  Mathematical thought In 1931, the mathematician and logician Kurt G√∂del proved his incompleteness theorems, showing that any effectively generated theory capable of expressing elementary arithmetic cannot be both consistent and complete. Further to that, for any consistent formal theory that proves certain basic arithmetic truths, there is an arithmetical statement that is true, but not provable in the theory. The essence of Penrose's argument is that while a formal proof system cannot, because of the theorem, prove its own incompleteness, G√∂del-type results are provable by human mathematicians. He takes this disparity to mean that human mathematicians are not describable as formal proof systems and are not running an algorithm, so that the computational theory of mind is false, and computational approaches to artificial general intelligence are unfounded. (The argument was first given by Penrose in The Emperor's New Mind (1989) and is developed further in Shadows of The Mind. An earlier version of the argument was given by J. R. Lucas in 1959.Minds, Machines and G√∂del For this reason, the argument is sometimes called the Penrose-Lucas argument). Objective reduction Penrose's theory of Objective Reduction predicts the relationship between quantum mechanics and general relativity. Penrose proposes that a quantum state remains in superposition until the difference in space-time curvature reaches a significant level. This idea is inspired by quantum gravity, because it uses both the physical constants \\\\scriptstyle \\\\hbar and \\\\scriptstyle G. It is an alternative to the Copenhagen interpretation, which posits that superposition fails under observation, and the many-worlds hypothesis, which states that each alternative outcome of a superposition becomes real in a separate world.'Folger, Tim. \\"If an Electron Can Be in 2 Places at Once, Why Can't You?\\" Discover. Vol. 25 No. 6 (June 2005). pp33-35. Penrose's idea is a type of objective collapse theory. In these theories the wavefunction is a physical wave, which undergoes wave function collapse as a physical process, with observers playing no special role. Penrose theorises that the wave function cannot be sustained in superposition beyond a certain energy difference between the quantum states. He gives an approximate value for this difference: a Planck mass worth of matter, which he calls the \\"'one-graviton' level\\". He then hypothesizes that this energy difference causes the wave function to collapse to a single state, with a probability based on its amplitude in the original wave function, a procedure taken from standard quantum mechanics. Orchestrated objective reduction When he wrote his first consciousness book, The Emperor's New Mind in 1989, Penrose lacked a detailed proposal for how such quantum processes could be implemented in the brain. Subsequently, Stuart Hameroff read The Emperor's New Mind and suggested to Penrose that certain structures within brain cells (microtubules) were suitable candidate sites for quantum processing and ultimately for consciousness. The Orch-OR theory arose from the co-operation of these two scientists and was developed in Penrose's second consciousness book Shadows of the Mind (1994). Hameroff's contribution to the theory derived from studying brain cells (neurons). His interest centred on the cytoskeleton, which provides an internal supportive structure for neurons, and particularly on the microtubules, which are the important component of the cytoskeleton. As neuroscience has progressed, the role of the cytoskeleton and microtubules has assumed greater importance. In addition to providing a supportive structure for the cell, the known functions of the microtubules include transport of molecules, including neurotransmitter molecules bound for the synapses, and control of the cell's movement, growth and shape. Criticism G√∂delian argument and nature of human thought Penrose's views on the human thought process are not widely accepted in scientific circles (Drew McDermott,Penrose is Wrong Drew McDermott, PSYCHE, 2(17), October 1995 David ChalmersMinds, Machines, And Mathematics ‚Äì A Review of Shadows of the Mind by Roger Penrose David J. Chalmers, PSYCHE 2(9) June 1995 and others). According to Marvin Minsky, because people can construe false ideas to be factual, the process of thinking is not limited to formal logic. Further, AI programs can also conclude that false statements are true, so error is not unique to humans. Another dissenter, Charles Seife, has said: \\"Penrose, the Oxford mathematician famous for his work on tiling the plane with various shapes, is one of a handful of scientists who believe that the ephemeral nature of consciousness suggests a quantum process.\\" In May 1995, Stanford mathematician Solomon Feferman attacked Penrose's approach on multiple grounds, including the mathematical validity of his G√∂delian argument and theoretical background.Penrose's G√∂delian argument (PDF) Feferman, PSYCHE 2(7) May 1995 In 1996, Penrose offered a consolidated reply to many of the criticisms of \\"Shadows\\".Beyond the Doubting of a Shadow ‚Äì A Reply to Commentaries on Shadows of the Mind Roger Penrose, PSYCHE, 2(23), January 1996 John Searle criticises Penrose's appeal to G√∂del as resting on the fallacy that all computational algorithms must be capable of mathematical description. As a counter-example, Searle cites the assignment of license plate numbers (LPN) to specific vehicle identification numbers (VIN), to register a vehicle. According to Searle, no mathematical function can be used to connect a known VIN with its LPN, but the process of assignment is quite simple‚Äînamely, \\"first come, first served\\"‚Äîand can be performed entirely by a computer.Searle, John R. The Mystery of Consciousness. 1997. . pp 85‚Äì86. Microtubule hypothesis Penrose and Stuart Hameroff have constructed the Orch-OR theory in which human consciousness is the result of quantum gravity effects in microtubules. However, in 2000, Max Tegmark calculated in an article he published in Physical Review E that the time scale of neuron firing and excitations in microtubules is slower than the decoherence time by a factor of at least 1010. Tegmark's article has been widely cited by critics of the Penrose-Hameroff hypothesis. The reception of the article is summed up by this statement in his support: \\"Physicists outside the fray, such as IBM's John Smolin, say the calculations confirm what they had suspected all along. 'We're not working with a brain that's near absolute zero. It's reasonably unlikely that the brain evolved quantum behavior', he says.\\" In other words, there is a missing link between physics and neuroscience, and to date, it is too premature to claim that the Orch-OR hypothesis is right. In response to Tegmark's claims, Hagan, Tuszynski and Hameroff claimed that Tegmark did not address the Orch-OR model, but instead a model of his own construction. This involved superpositions of quanta separated by 24 nm rather than the much smaller separations stipulated for Orch-OR. As a result, Hameroff's group claimed a decoherence time seven orders of magnitude greater than Tegmark's, although still far below 25 ms. Hameroff's group also suggested that the Debye layer of counterions could screen thermal fluctuations, and that the surrounding actin gel might enhance the ordering of water, further screening noise. They also suggested that incoherent metabolic energy could further order water, and finally that the configuration of the microtubule lattice might be suitable for quantum error correction, a means of resisting quantum decoherence. In 2007, Gregory S. Engel claimed that all arguments concerning the brain being \\"too warm and wet\\" have been dispelled, as multiple \\"warm and wet\\" quantum processes have been discovered.

Initially concerned with the civic functions of Bandra, it expanded to include the suburb of Khar and Santra Cruz by 1933. In 1950, the municipality was merged with the Bombay Municipal Corporation under the Bombay Act No. VII of 1950. The Municipality of Bandra established in 1876 had in 1880-81 an income of ¬£1536 (Rs. 15,360) representing a taxation of 2s. 0¬Ωd. (Rs. 1-0-4) a head. This income chiefly comes from taxes on houses, boats, and roads. During 1880-81 the expenditure amounted to ¬£844 (Rs. 8440), of which ¬£239 (Rs. 2390) were spent on scavenging, ¬£84 (RS. 840) on lighting, and ¬£520 (Rs. 5200) on roads. The chief municipal works are new markets in Bandra and at Khar, representing a cost of ¬£410 (Rs. 4104), and new roads representing a cost of ¬£1169 (Rs. 11,690).[The Bandra markets were built from Local Funds in 1874 at. a cost of ¬£443 (Rs. 4430), and handed over to the municipality who objected to pay the coat sum.] The Bandra municipal district includes the following villages which lie either together or within half a mile of each other: Naupada, Khar, Pali, Varoda, Chimbai, Katvadi, Mala, Sherli Rajan, Chui, and Danda. Of public offices and institutions there are, besides the railway station, a post office, a dispensary, and seven schools. The Sir Kavasji Jahanghir Readymoney Dispensary was founded in 1851 at the request of several influential inhabitants of Salsette. Subscriptions seem to have accumulated as, in 1867, there was a balance of ¬£1920 (Rs. 19,207). In 1874 Government sanctioned a yearly grant of ¬£260 (Rs. 2600) to pay a medical officer and staff of servants. In 1877 Sir Kavasji Jahanghir handed over ¬£1000 (Rs. 10,000) to Government who directed that the dispensary should be called by his name. The attendance in 1880-81 was 14,565 out-patients and five in-patients. One or two private dispensaries are also kept by Bombay practitioners, chiefly native Christians. Most of their patients belong to the middle and upper classes, and their fees vary from 4s. to 6s. (Rs. 2- Rs. 3) a visit. Of the schools the Jesuits maintain the St. Stanislaus' Orphanage and St. Joseph's Convent, the former with 235 boys and the latter with 214 girls. The following schools are also kept by the native Christian clergy: a Diocesan School with an attendance of 170 pupils, a Portuguese Catechism School at Sherli with an attendance of 50, and St. Vincent's School at Pali with an attendance of 45. There are also two Government Anglo-vernacular schools, one at Bandra with 130 boys and 10 girls and one at Danda with 28 boys. The elementary education of native Christian children is fairly provided for, and as a rule they do not attend the Government schools References  * Category:History of Mumbai Category:Government of Mumbai Category:Bandra ","title":"Bandra Municipal Committee"},{"id":"5822407","text":"Woody Chapel, Oklahoma is an unincorporated community located in McClain County, Oklahoma.

It was released on October 7, 1993 by Simon & Schuster and edited by Larry \\"Ratso\\" Sloman and Judith Regan. By mid-1992, Stern's radio show The Howard Stern Show had become the number one morning program in New York City and had hosted the Saturday night television show The Howard Stern Show on WWOR-TV, since 1990. After development on a feature film for New Line Cinema fell through, Stern secured a deal with Simon & Schuster in early 1993 to write a book. Private Parts was an instant commercial success upon release. It debuted at number one on The New York Times Best Seller list and remained there for five weeks. After five days, it became the fastest selling title in Simon & Schuster's history. A paperback edition with extra material was released in 1994. The autobiographical chapters of the book were adapted into the 1997 feature film Private Parts, which starred Stern and his radio show staff playing themselves. This release was supported with a second paperback print of the book. Background By 1993, Stern had been the host of his morning radio show, The Howard Stern Show, at WXRK in New York City for over six years. In January of that year, the show was syndicated to ten markets and had become the first to be number one in New York City, Los Angeles, and Philadelphia simultaneously. Stern had also landed success in television as the host of The Howard Stern Show on WWOR-TV and The Howard Stern \\"Interview\\" on E!. However, development for a feature film with New Line Cinema based on his Fartman character was delayed and ultimately fell through in 1993. In February 1993, the press reported that Stern had entered talks with publisher Simon & Schuster to write a book. Stern was approached by the publisher and found the project an attractive one as it would help strengthen his self- proclaimed title of \\"King of All Media\\". He believed that they wanted him following the success of The Way Things Ought to Be, the first book by popular conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, which generated strong sales and became a success on The New York Times Best Seller list. Stern accepted, partly for the \\"great advance\\" that was offered, which was estimated to be worth over $1 million, and that Simon & Schuster was a prestigious company. On March 23, 1993, Stern held a live press conference on his radio show to announce the deal and aimed for a release in October of that year. A major factor for Stern to write a book was due to his dissatisfaction with the number of times he had been misquoted or paraphrased in print or television, itself a reason why he resisted in granting press interviews. By writing a book himself, Stern said that \\"it will at least be my words.\\" Stern added that he wanted to write a book that dealt with honest opinions because it was something that people \\"don't deal with honesty any more.\\" He cited honesty as the reason why audiences respond to him, yet thought the book would reveal a side to him that his fans were not familiar with. At this time of the book's announcement, Stern had considered to dedicate the book to singer Cher. When Stern announced the book, he said that his initial suggestion of Mein Kampf: Settling Accounts, a spin on Mein Kampf by Adolf Hitler, for the book's title, was rejected by the publisher as it would be unpopular with Jewish readers. Another early title of Sort of the World According to Howard was reported in the following month. Writing Stern wrote the book in approximately six months. He thought it was going to be easy to produce at first, but he looked back on the project as the most difficult of his career at the time. He saw the temptation in taking \\"three or four of my old bits\\" and adapting them into a book for a rush release, but he aimed for a quality product with strong material that would help him gain new fans. A typical day saw Stern return home from doing his radio show and write until dinner or around 8 p.m. He predicted that he could complete the book in three months, but he only managed to produce an outline of the book in that time. Stern wrote the book with assistance from editors Larry \\"Ratso\\" Sloman and Judith Regan. Regan lived in Stern's guest house for six weeks over the summer of 1993 with her then two- year-old daughter and nanny to help complete the book on time. Sloman also stayed over at Stern's house on weekends. One of the researchers hired to work on the book transcribed segments of Stern's radio show and interviews with his parents to produce around 10,000 words of text for Regan to go through. She assured that despite her input, \\"the words are Howard's\\". Stern described Sloman's involvement as a \\"collaborator\\" and worked on selecting the best material for the book. Sloman suggested to have one sponsor for each chapter of the book, an idea that Stern liked but fell through. Around the time of the book's announcement, Stern attempted to find his writing voice by sketching initial ideas onto paper and teaming with his radio show producer Gary Dell'Abate to retrace his career, emphasising on stories and anecdotes from behind the scenes. He later said that he approached the book in the same way as his radio show, talking like \\"I'm sitting around with a bunch of guys.\\" Stern wrote the majority of the book in his basement office at his home on Long Island, New York, using his computer or dictating passages into a tape recorder. Stern later found out that his wife would enter his office when he was asleep and read some pages, offering encouragement or complaints to what he had written. Stern was able to complete the book using a computer archive that he had a friend start nine years earlier, which indexed each radio show by subject matter and scans of every newspaper article about him. Each chapter of the book features a different girl holding a card indicating the chapter number. Stern shaved off his body hair for the photo shoot. Other early book titles included War and Piss, I, Moron, I, Moron: King of All Idiots, and Penis; the latter was considered due to the hilarity of the potential newspaper headline: \\"Howard Stern's 'Penis' is a best seller\\". By August 1993, as a compromise with the rejections, Stern and the publisher reached a compromise with Private Parts, first suggested by Stern's co-host, Robin Quivers. Stern aimed for a title that would attract readers and not turn any particular group off from buying the book. He went on to use \\"Mein Kampf\\" as the title to a chapter in the book which details his early career. Stern wrote a chapter about the ongoing FCC fines against his radio show, \\"but it was so convoluted it wasn't going to make anyone laugh\\", so it was scrapped. Other chapters that were not included detailed his rise to number one in Philadelphia and his WWOR-TV show. Stern changed some of the women's names that he had slept with while attending Boston University to protect their identities. Stern picked psychotherapists Sheenah Hankin and Richard Wessler, who were not aware of him, to read the book and give an analysis. Their eight- page profile on Stern closes the book. Stern recalled the difficulty he had in reading it and entered a state of denial initially, before he realised there was a substantial amount of truth to what they had written. While writing the book, Stern asked Chaunce Hayden, editor of Steppin Out, to supply quotes about him from celebrity interviews published in the magazine. Hayden produced quotes from fifty celebrities and said it was worth the time and effort because he was a big fan of Stern. In the book, Stern mistakenly credited Hayden as \\"Chaunce Howell\\". When the book was finished Stern was informed that he was around 45,000 words too long which required some chapters to be rewritten. Cover Simon & Schuster rejected an early cover that featured Stern and two naked blonde women holding his crotch. The publisher had it altered, removing the women entirely and covering Stern's genital area with a banner presenting the book's title. The shots that were rejected were printed in the book. Release Private Parts was released on October 7, 1993, receiving an initial printing of 250,000 copies. A spokesman for Simon & Schuster said that between 50,000 and 75,000 copies were sold on the first day. On the following day, the publisher ordered a second printing of 500,000 copies, the largest single print order in its history which surpassed the previous record of 400,000 copies for The Way Things Ought to Be by Limbaugh. Five days after the book's release, Private Parts became the fastest selling title in the publisher's history. By October 26, 1993, the book was in its eighth printing with over one million copies in circulation. In November 1995, the book had sold 1.1 million copies.https://www.latimes.com/archives/la- xpm-1995-11-20-ls-5249-story.html The sales were supported by Stern's book signing tour of various cities across the United States, with the largest crowd attendances ever. The first was held at Barnes and Noble in New York City on October 14, 1993.https://www.newspapers.com/image/471676497/?terms=%22howard%2Bstern%22%2B%22private%2Bparts%22 A book party was held on October 27.https://www.newspapers.com/image/178355144/?terms=%22howard%2Bstern%22%2B%22private%2Bparts%22 The success was in spite of mixed reviews and the refusal by several stores to carry the book over objections to its content. On the day of release Sapak Inc., a California-based wholesaler that supplied books to various stores, cancelled its order of the book as it deemed its content too risque for its \\"family oriented\\" customers. The Caldor chain of department stores modified the New York Times Best Seller list which was displayed in stores to remove Private Parts from the top position, moving all subsequent books up one. The inclusion of the book in library lists was also frequently challenged in subsequent years. The book spent five weeks at the top of the non-fiction list from the weeks of October 9 to November 6, 1993 before being displaced by See, I Told You So by Rush Limbaugh. Private Parts spent a total of twenty weeks on the NY Times Best Seller list, hitting the number one spot after a week of its release. With the considerable audience from his radio show, Stern was able to sell the first printing of his book within hours of its release. This was in spite of a perception of Stern's listeners who were considered to not be given to reading books, or even illiterate.(; ) The strong sales were seen as reflection of his populist appeal to a middle-class white male demographic who compose a large part of the fan base of his show.(; ; ) The main reason given for his appeal at the time was as backlash from a push towards what was considered political correctness. Upon release, Private Parts became the fastest selling title in Simon & Schuster's history.(; ) It was later adapted into a film in 1997 starring Stern and his radio show staff as themselves. Reception The book received mixed reviews from critics, often drawing comparisons to Lenny Bruce's How to Talk Dirty and Influence People. Like Stern's radio show, it received a great deal of opposition due to its content. It is number 86 on the American Library Association's list of the \\"100 Most Frequently challenged books Between 1990 and 1999.\\"\\"100 most frequently challenged books: 1990‚Äì1999\\" American Library Association. Retrieved 8 May 2015. A paperback edition was released in September 1994, where Pocket Books, a division of Simon & Schuster, printed a further 2.8 million copies. In late 1995, Stern published a second book called Miss America. Stern's venture into literature drew much of the same criticism as his radio show. Private Parts drew favorable comparisons to Lenny Bruce and his book How to Talk Dirty and Influence People, but it was also characterized as nothing more than an extension of his radio show with little more to offer. Stern was praised for his populist message and attracting a group of people who normally do not read either by choice or for lack of ability. Another frequent criticism was that the material was juvenile, with little more to offer than stories of \\"breasts, behinds, penises, masturbation, defecation, and the expulsion of gas\\". The book frequently drew comparisons to Lenny Bruce's 1965 autobiography How to Talk Dirty and Influence People.; ; ; ) In some instances the comparison was favorable, citing Stern's as the best book by a comedian since Bruce's. Others felt Stern fell short of the mark, or at least not influencing people as suggested by his ratings in certain radio markets. As the host of a highly rated radio show, the comparison between the book and his radio show was inevitable. The radio show was often the starting point from which the reviewer based their opinion of the book.(; ) Sometimes the praise for the book came in spite of the critic's distaste for the show, but often it was used to damn the book as nothing more than a collection of radio show highlights in print, but in more explicit detail.(; ; ; ) Critics would sometimes qualify that they could not adequately relay the stories because of their papers' editorial standards. Another frequent observation about the book was that it was juvenile both in its topics and layout. This included being compared to a comic book for its heavy use of pictures and varying fonts.; Margo Jefferson of the New York Times enjoyed the way it broke up the book, as this allowed readers to read the passages out of sequence. The reliance on stories of body parts, functions, and human sexuality were also cited as a reason for what constituted the entirety of the book, and were not seen as compelling to some readers.(; ) In one instance the review was given by a high school student.

Though Hertzka was not a Zionist and his utopian vision was directed at human beings in general, Theodore Herzl acknowledged the influence of Hertzka on his own ideas in the opening chapter of his book Der Judenstadt, envisioning the creation of a Jewish state.

They have a continuous income and consist of the right to vote. To become an active citizen one must be above 25 years of age and had to pay taxes equal to at least 3 days of a labourer's wages. Passive citizens are citizens who are illiterate and have no knowledge about law and government. They don't have jobs but they are under the protection of government. They don't have the right to vote.The women, men below 25 years of age, children and men above 25 years of age wh didn't have enough to pay the taxes were listed under passive citizens. In France Citizenship during the French Revolution During the French Revolution, a distinction was made for a time between active and passive citizens. In 1791, the Legislative Assembly was chosen by a process of indirect election; the Electors of the Assembly were themselves elected by \\"active\\" citizens, male citizens whose annual taxes equalled the local wages paid for three days of labour. This disenfranchised about half of the male citizens of France. Even higher economic requirements for the Electors and the members of the Assembly left only about 50,000 eligible men in a country of some 25 million people. Slavery Slavery in France, throughout the Revolution, remained common in the colonies. The abolition of slavery in the colonies would have affected planters who were represented in the assemblies by deputies, particularly the Lameths. The coloured free saw that their rights were being taken from them and finally on this date in 1791 the assembly decided to withdraw their civil rights. However, after the Haitian Revolution and new freedom of blacks in French colonies, in 1794 radical Jacobins reinstated the rights of blacks. Furthermore, slavery was abolished in all French colonies, and free blacks of those colonies were made electable to the French government as colonial representatives. Along with this the rights for free association for workers and the right to strike were also taken away. After a series of strikes on June 14, 1791, in workshops located in Paris, the Loi Le Chapelier was passed. The intention was to establish a free labour market by forbidding associations by workers and also the formation of trade unions. Voting Rights It remained that all had the right to contribute towards the making of the laws, but on December 23, 1789, voting rights only extended to property owners. This reflected a belief that only those who had a stake in decisions made for society as a whole and those who had shown they could manage their own affairs should be eligible for political involvement. Three categories were created to divide the citizens of France: Passive Citizens, Active Citizens, and the Electors. The only members of society that could vote were the members that paid a certain amount(3 days of a labourer's wages) of taxes. Passive Citizens were those who had no property rights or voting rights. They were entitled to protection by law with relation to their belongings and their liberty, but had no say in the making of government bodies. This group totalled around three million men within France. The constitution of 1791 reduced the women of France to passive citizens. Active Citizens numbered around four million men. They were required to be literate, speak French, and have been a resident for more than one year. They had a stake in the government bodies. They paid taxes equal to about three days work a year. These men met in primary assemblies to nominate electors and members of the councils in their municipalities. Active citizens (and their sons over the age of 18) were also, in that period, the basis for the French National Guard, the military bastion of the middle class.They elected the electors. Roughly one in every hundred active citizens became electors.To qualify as an Elector one had to paid taxes equal to 10 days work a year: typically 5 to 10 livres. There were about 50,000 electors in France at the time. These electors also met in assemblies where they nominated deputies, judges, and members of other departments. System of Elections This new system of elections and electoral rights managed to remove common people from political involvement. The laws were applied to all equally, with the idea that everyone had passive citizenship rights. There was no expectation that passive citizens would become active citizens. Because of the belief that women could not use reason to deliberate, active citizens could only be men. Vincent Og√© argued that coloured people or \\"gens de couleur\\" owned properties and should be considered for active citizenship. Unfortunately, the assembly felt that this would disrupt their trade overseas and they could not do anything that would hinder that trade. Passive citizens could be aware of political arena by reading newspapers and even by attending political meetings. Political groups and clubs arose as the Revolution progressed. These groups began to hold organized demonstrations and circulated petitions. Newspapers of the time had a lot of political influence. The Constitutional committee felt that qualification by property ownership would result in passive citizens competing to become active citizens. They felt that the passive citizens would fight with more eagerness to become rich in hopes of owning property and becoming active citizens and maybe even electors. This system of representation by the amount of taxes paid left society in the hands of the rich. Camille Desmoulins said it best, ‚Äú [‚Ä¶] but what on earth is meant by this expression ‚Äòactive citizens‚Äô which we hear repeated so often? Active citizens are the men who stormed the Bastille, those who work the land, whereas the idle members of the Court and the clergy, despite the vast estates which they own, are nothing more than vegetables, vegetables like that tree in scripture which bore no fruit and which was therefore condemned to be thrown into the fire and burned.‚Äù In modern usage In the 20th and 21st century debates on illegal immigration, \\"passive citizenship\\" refers to the limited rights enjoyed by non-citizens in another country of current residence: they cannot meaningfully state. Furthermore, it also refers to the lack of participation of registered citizens in the benefitting of their native state's people.

The cemetery is the burying ground of Ross Church and First Zion Church, both located nearby. It is also sometimes known as First Zion Cemetery History What is now Causeway Boulevard marks the original line of fortifications of \\"Fort John Hunt Morgan,\\" a Confederate military camp named after the Kentucky war hero. The camp itself was at Causeway and the river. The Native Guards were among many valorous regiments which trained at Camp Parapet and made their base there. In 1862, with the fall of New Orleans to the Union Army, the fort was occupied by Federal troops, who renamed it \\"Camp Parapet.\\" Camp Parapet was a large site with a blacksmith, grocery, and chapel. Soldiers who died of illness or injury at Camp Parapet were buried in the post's cemetery. Since the time of the Civil War, the cemetery has been used primarily by local residents. The current cemetery ground is smaller than it was originally, since some land north (lakewards) of the current plot was sold to the New Orleans Belt Railroad in the 1930s. Julia Street January 2008 Camp Parapet Camp Parapet also was a very large contraband camp, where large numbers of former slaves sought refuge. They were hired on as laborers, assistants, and many joined the service. They were fed and housed in the camp. All the slaves of the nearby plantations journeyed to Camp Parapet. In 1867-68, the graves of Union troops were moved from civilian graveyards and those of various other camps (including Camp Parapet) to Chalmette National Cemetery. Former slaves were buried in the camp‚Äòs cemetery. After the war, the name Camp Parapet was applied to the neighborhood as well as Shrewsbury, Bath, and Harlem. Today all that survives of Camp Parapet is the magazine, where ammunition is stored. The magazine is located at the opposite end of the block from Ross Chapel.

Wehrenberg Theatres was a movie theater chain in America. It operated 15 movie theaters with 213 screens in the states of Missouri, Illinois, Iowa and Minnesota, including nine theaters with 131 screens in the St. Louis Metropolitan area. It was a member of the National Association of Theatre Owners. On November 21, 2016 it was announced that the Wehrenberg Theater chain would be acquired by Marcus Theatres.http://www.stltoday.com/business/local/st-louis-largest-movie- theater-chain-wehrenberg-sold-to- milwaukee/article_92bbda48-6cfd-5b24-ad77-48332ebb755d.html The acquisition was completed in December 2016.http://www.jsonline.com/story/money/business/2016/12/16/marcus-theatres- buys/95531746/ As of now, Wehrenberg Theatres is defunct.  History  In 1904, Fred Wehrenberg explored the St. Louis World's Fair and saw something that changed his life. The one-time blacksmith who ran a saloon/grocery/butcher shop saw a simple film clip of passengers riding a train while scenery rushed by in the background. The film inspired Fred to rent the former bakery next to his saloon, buy a piano and 99 kitchen chairs and launch the Cherokee Theatre in 1906. As silent movies flickered on the screen, Fred's nephew drummed in the background while his wife, Gertrude, played piano in the pit. The saloon doubled as the theater's de facto concession stand, and many customers frequented both buildings. Business boomed, inspiring the Wehrenbergs to open a second venue, the Airdome. The Airdome was St. Louis‚Äô first open-air venue, basically a drive-in without cars. A screen was erected at one end of a fenced-in lot while an elevated projection booth was built across from it. Guests sat on folding chairs and benches placed on the bare ground. In the winter, a canvas tarp trapped the heat from potbellied stoves to keep guests warm. The Wehrenbergs survived the Great Depression as the movie industry was more stable than most. Fred paved the way for success by calling on help from his family, and coming into his own as a showman. Fred launched numerous promotions, including giveaways of china, glassware, flatware, turkeys and hams. These innovations ensured circuit success even during the city's lean times. Business boomed, and soon the Wehrenbergs expanded their theater circuit. They sold their saloon so they could enter the movie industry full-time. They built St. Louis‚Äô Best Theatre, the first building in the city constructed expressly for use as a motion- picture theater. The Wehrenbergs survived the Great Depression due in part to the stability of the movie industry. Of course, Fred's creativity and mind for promotions helped tremendously. Years before \\"The Jazz Singer\\" premiered, Wehrenberg invented its own version of \\"talking pictures.\\" Local actors scripted dialogue for the silent films, then acted them out behind the screen. Then, in 1948, Fred and his son-in-law, Paul Krueger, opened the first Wehrenberg Drive-In. The Drive-In was named \\"Ronnie's\\" after six-year-old Ronald Paul Krueger, Paul's son and Fred's grandson. The Ronnie's was the beginning of Ron's lifelong association with the circuit. While still a boy, he ran the miniature train around the playground at Ronnie's Drive-In, entertaining the small children in attendance. Fred debuted another family- friendly idea with pony rides at the 66 Drive-In. Grandson Ron was again in charge as he led the pony rides. Ron eventually worked as a carhop, usher and concessionaire before ultimately taking the helm as president of the company. During the 1950s, the industry hit its first snag. Television and a post-war migration to the suburbs closed several indoor theatres. Fortunately, the Wehrenberg circuit could still ride the popularity of the drive-ins. Paul Krueger, who had taken over management of the circuit upon Fred Wehrenberg's death in 1949, himself died in 1963. It was up to 23-year-old Ron Krueger was left to assume the circuit's presidency and continue with his father's plans. With the help of several loyal, long-time employees, Wehrenberg Theatres made it through the rough spots. The 1960s and 1970s saw another surge in the industry. Multiplexes, theaters with two to six screens, became the popular choice of movie-goers. Wehrenberg's Cinema Four Center in St. Charles was the first multiplex in the St. Louis area. In the late 1980s and into the 1990s, the circuit started building megaplexes of ten or more screens. Wehrenberg also expanded outside the St. Louis area. New theatres opened their doors to guests in Springfield, MO, Osage Beach, MO and Cape Girardeau, MO. Wehrenberg Theatres‚Äô updates went beyond buildings; they also upgraded by offering guests ticket purchasing via phone, web or theatre ATM machines. In 2004, Wehrenberg again grew in size and vision with two new theaters. The first, named the Galaxy 16, introduced Iowa to the circuit with its Cedar Rapids location. The second, named the Galaxy 14, is in Chesterfield, MO and boasts St. Louis‚Äô largest screen, the Mega Screen. Both \\"Galaxy\\" locations also are home to \\"Freds Drive-In,\\" a food court designed like nostalgic 1950s diners, but with current favorites like pizza, chicken fingers and a St. Louis tradition ‚Äì toasted ravioli. They also feature \\"Now Playing\\" Family Entertainment Centers and separate party rooms, perfect for children birthdays. Over the years, Wehrenberg Theatres has remained family-owned and operated. Ron Krueger's death on October 21, 2015 has left Bill Menke as President and Midge Krueger as CEO of the company.

He was runner-up in the Bermuda Bowl twice (1961 and 1967), and was second (1968) and third (1960) in the World Team Olympiad. He was a World Bridge Federation World Life Master and an ACBL Grand Life Master. Kay was arguably the greatest bridge player who never became a world champion. He was known for both the remarkable accuracy of his card play and for his even temperament at the table. Away from the table, he was widely respected as an exceptionally kind and humble gentleman. According to Alan Truscott, Kay \\"bent over backward to avoid criticizing his partner, or his opponents, blaming himself for any misfortune if he possibly could.\\" He also played slowly: \\"Kay believed in a thorough analysis at the table, and never played a card until he had examined every angle. This leisurely approach occasionally caused problems.\\" Kay was an account executive for Merrill Lynch for 38 years, retiring as a vice president in 1987. He helped his wife who operated a sports memorabilia business from 1980 to 1997. He and his wife, Judy, also owned a stable of standardbreds (trotters and pacers) from 1970 or 1980 to 1986 or 1987. Kay died from a pulmonary embolism on January 17, 2002. Judy Kay subsequently married Bobby Wolff in late 2003. \\"Author's Tribute ...\\", p. v. Kay was Inducted into the ACBL Hall of Fame in 1996.

The Turkey Swamp area includes the headwaters of the extensive Manasquan, Metedeconk, and Toms River systems to the east, Millstone River to the north, and Assunpink Creek to the west.Freehold Township Master Plan (2010), p.7-1U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map The chief recreational attraction of this park is the lake suitable for bass, bluegill and catfish fishing, as well as canoeing and paddle boating. The core of the park was purchased in 1963. Additional land was purchased in the 1970s and any May 1993 (acquisition of Camp Nomoco) to bring the park to its current configuration. Nomenclature The title of the park may be considered a bit of a misnomer considering the park does not bear a swamp, nor does it act as a habitat for turkeys. Although considering that the soil is rather sandy and the water table lies slightly beneath the surface, this thus gives rise to swampy conditions at times when the surface topography dips to the water line; hence the 'swamp' title. The 'turkey' prefix, however, was adapted from the town's previous name, Turkey. The town once known as Turkey is now known as the unincorporated area of Adelphia.Turkey Swamp hiking information, accessed 3 October 2006 Park information The park features of trails, an archery range, an array of playgrounds, two soccer fields, and various picnic grounds. During the appropriate season, canoes, paddleboats, kayaks, and rowboats may be rented. During the winter season, as the massive lake freezes over, ice-skating is available for park visitors. A significant section of the park is dedicated as a seasonal campground, complete with laundry facilities, hot-water bathrooms, and RV electric & water hook-ups. It consists of 64 pull-through campsites that can accommodate both tent campers and travel trailers. Two wood \\"forest view\\" cabins are also available.Campgrounds at Turkey Swamp Park.

Nomoco Activity Area A more secluded area in the park, called the Nomoco Activity Area, is also available for use by groups interested in group activities. It consists of six sites each capable of accommodating groups of up to 40 people. One of the sites, called \\"the Outpost\\" is more secluded yet, requiring a hike through the woods of 1/4 mile to reach. This area is good for groups seeking wilderness camping. In the Outpost, drinking water, for example, must be carried in, although ground water from hand pump-driven wells are available in the general area. Also, a pit toilet is available as there are no other relief facilities at the Outpost.Nomoco Activity Area at Turkey Swamp Park. Monmouth County Board of Recreation Commissioners.

The Council had operated the 303-acre camp since 1947. The Council trustees were determined to sell the camp, as a Wall Herald reporter noted, to ‚Äúa buyer who cares more about nature and a pristine environment than about developing the land.‚Äù The Nomoco acquisition also helped protect the Metedeconk River watershed while converting a private camping facility into a public one.1990s: A Clear Vision Flora The flora of Turkey Swamp Park includes pitch pine, scrub oak, white oak, sweet gum, pepperbush, huckleberry, blueberry, etc. Trails *The orange-blazed trail, a trail circumventing the lake. *The red-blazed trail, a trail which leads into the woodsy camping area. *The green-blazed, a trail leading to the lakefront area and bordering the red-blazed trail. *The blue-blazed, a trail which guides hikers to the boathouse.

Biography Early life He was born at Ardmayle House, near Longfield and Fort Edward, located just north of Cashel. Known in his younger days as Edward, he was the second son of Robert Hare Long of Ardmayle, and Anna Geraldine McAuliffe. When he was only two years old, his family moved from Ardmayle to Mayfield House, east of Cashel. Another move followed in late 1877 when the family left Tipperary and moved on to Dublin, to the southern suburb of Kingstown (now D√∫n Laoghaire). Since his father was often away on business or attending horse-racing events, young Edward barely knew him, and was just seven years old when he died in Montreal in February, 1880. On 19 October 1881, a Church of Ireland Merit Certificate was awarded to Edward Long of Mariners Church, Kingstown.Long of Longfield Family Papers, Brewer Library, Richland Center, Wisconsin. He presumably also attended a local elementary school. However, in 1885, aged around 13, Edward emulated his elder brother John and ran away from home. He made his way to the waterfront and took the boat to Liverpool, England where he found a job working on the docks, but before long made his way down to London. About this time, he also made the decision to be known by his first name of Robert rather than Edward. Early career Settled in London by 1888, Long, through a stroke of luck, was introduced to Jerome K. Jerome (1859‚Äì1927), journalist and author of Three Men in a Boat (1889) fame, who promptly hired him as an office boy. Jerome was then the co-editor of The Idler and sole editor of To-Day,Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, vol 13, University of Chicago, 1948, p 3. two of the most popular British periodicals of the time. Robert soon began writing book reviews and other short items which he then submitted to Jerome. For several years, Robert continued to develop and polish his writing skills, and accordingly rose through the ranks, so that by 1897, he found himself on the editorial staff both publications. He became confident enough, while continuing to work for Jerome, to set out on his own and in 1894 became \\"engaged in journalism as London correspondent for American newspapers.\\"Who Was Who, 1929-1940, vol 3, p 824 From 1897 to 1904, he served as secretary to the famous English journalist, William Thomas Stead (1849‚Äì1912), who founded the Review of Reviews in 1890, and who went down with the in 1912.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, vol 21, Chicago, 1948, p 349 \\"He was one of W. T. Stead's staff on the Review of Reviews in 1898, in which capacity he went to Russia to interview Count Leo Tolstoy (1828-1910)\\".The Times, Oct 19, 1938 As a result, Robert Long became well-acquainted with the charismatic Russian novelist and philosopher (and author of War and Peace (1866)). \\"Tolstoy, who had great personal sympathy with Stead, deplored the Review of Reviews...\\" \\"It lacked the single intellectual and moral trend which Tolstoy wanted in everything.\\" \\"I have this from my friend, Mr. Robert Crozier Long, who knew Tolstoy well.\\" The Life of W.T. Stead, vol 1, Frederick Whyte, London, 1925, p 313 Robert Long started work for the Westminster Gazette early in his career, circa 1898, when he first went to Russia, and stayed with them until the paper folded. In 1899, he returned to Russia to report on the famine there as a special correspondent for the Daily Chronicle. By this time, Robert Long's considerable linguistic talents began to emerge. Already conversant in French, he began to study Russian. During 1904 and 1905, he returned to \\"Russia as special correspondent of [the] New York American.\\" Russia According to Tania Long Daniell, her parents met in Russia in around 1905. She does not recall where, or under what circumstances. However, they fell in love and were married in Russia sometime in 1909. Thus, Robert Edward Crozier Long married Tatiana, daughter of Arsene Mouravieff, President of the Tamboff District Court, by his wife, Vera Kreiter, of a Russian family with a Baltic name. Arsene Mouravieff was a relative of Count Nicholas Mouraviev-Amoursky (1809‚Äì1881), aide-de-camp to the Czar and Governor-General of Eastern Siberia.Dictionnaire de la Noblesse Russe, Patrick de Gmeline, Editions Contrepoint, Paris, 1978, p 413 The Mouravieffs, whose name is derived from the Russian word for \\"ant\\", are a family of the Russian nobility, dating from the period when Russia was invaded and occupied by the Tartars. Tatiana and Robert spent the first two years of their marriage residing in Russia. When Robert Long was assigned to Berlin by the Westminster Gazette in 1911, he and his wife left Russia and settled in the German capital. Two years later, on April 29, 1913, their daughter Tatiana (known as Tania), was born there. Balkan Wars During the Balkan War of 1912, fought between Bulgaria and Turkey, Robert Long was there as a War correspondent, and as was advisable, he bought himself a Bulgarian army uniform from a second-hand store, hired a servant, rented a horse, and went off to war. He was so preoccupied with his thoughts formulating his next article, that before he realized it, he had wandered into the middle of the battlefield, and ended up being captured by the Turks. When they took off his uniform, they discovered that it had belonged to a Bulgarian general who had died. But the Turks didn‚Äôt know this and believed they had captured a real prize, a true Bulgarian general, so they threw Long in jail where he stayed for an entire week before he was able to convince the Turkish authorities to contact the British Consul in Istanbul. Meanwhile, his wife Tatiana was worrying herself to death back home in Berlin. World War I The stewing Balkan cauldron erupted again during late June, 1914, with the assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, at Sarajevo, Bosnia. This event triggered the First World War, with Germany and Austria poised to attack their European neighbours. \\"My father sent my mother and me out of Berlin in July 1914, as war looked imminent and he stayed behind. He had to leave his apartment, after storing all their possessions, in order not to be arrested as an enemy alien after war was declared, and took refuge in the British Embassy which made him a (temporary) second secretary, giving him diplomatic status. He remained in Berlin until a special train left taking all the foreign diplomats out of Berlin about ten days after the declaration of war. Mother, my German nanny and myself stayed with my English godfather and family until father joined us.\\" Long of Longfield Correspondence (LLC), Aug 1997 letter from Tania Long Daniell, daughter of Robert E. C. Long The Longs did not of course return until the war was over in November 1918. Russian Revolution If he wasn't escaping one world hot spot, he was rushing toward another, this time to Russia at the outbreak of the Revolution of 1917. Sent there as a correspondent for the Associated Press of America, Long arrived in Russia early in 1917. Before long, he had befriended Prince Lvoff, Prime Minister of Russia during the very brief liberal regime in early 1917. A passage from Long's book, Russian Revolution Aspects, advises: \\"Had the Revolution settled down quietly under Lvoff's practical and extremely democratic rule, Russia would be spared the humiliation and anguish of today. For Lvoff was not only a great and tried democrat; he was also a great patriot. Though himself an aristocrat and a man of wealth, he was ready to go to great lengths to meet the Socialist spirit of the workmen, soldiers and peasants.\\" Russian Revolution Aspects, Robert Crozier Long, 1919, E.P. Dutton & Co., N.Y., pp 71-2 Long also had something to say about Russia's ill-fated royal family: \\"Three times in the course of my many visits to Russia, I saw Czar Nicholas II, the last, least considerable and unluckiest of the Romanoffs. The first time, he was at the height of his power; the second time, he had just unwillingly surrendered a part of that power; and the third time, he was returning to his palace between armed guards, a captive of the Revolution.\\" Russian Revolution Aspects, Robert Crozier Long, 1919, E.P. Dutton & Co., N.Y., p 1, \\"The Last Romanoff\\" By this time Long had earned an international reputation as an outstanding journalist, so it is not surprising that he ultimately came to the attention of the American press baron, William Randolph Hearst (1863‚Äì1951), who was so taken with Long's articles on the Russian Revolution, that he made him a very attractive job offer. Long returned to the States with his wife and daughter toward the end of 1917, but soon quit since Hearst wanted to censor his articles. Berlin With his family he returned to Berlin in late 1918, having spent the previous year residing in Stockholm, Sweden, where he could be close to the latest political developments in Russia. For several years, his journalistic career continued to prosper, and important newspapers engaged his services as a special correspondent in Russia, Scandinavia and the United States. He began his association with The New York Times in 1923, as their Berlin-based financial correspondent, and wrote weekly columns for them right up until the time of his death. He also wrote for The Saturday Evening Post and for newspapers in Birmingham and Leeds, England. Long resumed working for The Economist (of London) in 1926 (having previously been employed by them briefly in the early 1920s), and continued writing for the London weekly until his death. Not only did Long possess a keen understanding of economics in addition to his journalistic and linguistic skills, he also possessed an inquiring logical mind. His daughter Tania relates: \\"Father was fascinated with the Einstein Theory of relativity and understood it very well, having become a friend of Einstein's principal assistant in Germany. He was a frequent visitor to Professor Freundlich at the Einstein Potsdam Observatory (where he took me) and wrote many articles on the subject.\\" LLC, Aug 1997 letter from Tania Long Daniell A long-time resident of Berlin, Robert Long witnessed first-hand the rise of Hitler and Nazi Germany. In 1937, when Hitler placed restrictions on transferring money and bank accounts out of Germany, and therefore invoked mail censorship as a means of preventing such transfers, Long managed to outwit the Fuehrer by mailing out instructions to his English bank by writing on a postcard! By September 1938, Robert recognized how dangerous Hitler and the Nazis had become, so: \\"He went (to England) after the Munich Crisis, when many thought war would break out any second and met me (Tania) in England. He had sent mother to Bruges in Belgium while he remained to cover the dramatic events for a couple of British papers (as well as his own) whose correspondents had left Berlin. He was overworked and developed bronchitis and was ill when he arrived in London, having left the German capital at what seemed the last moment. He did not see Churchill but saw men close to Churchill, (men) who promised to pass on his message: if France and England acted immediately to show Germany they meant war if it continued on its way, war would be averted. But this would be the last chance. Another year, it would be too late, as Germany would then be strong enough to take on the allies, in fact the world.\\" Death When Robert returned to Berlin just a week later, he found himself to be the last British citizen still in Berlin, aside from the British diplomats. Although he had always enjoyed good health, his bronchitis, aggravated by the stormy political climate, turned into pneumonia, which resulted in his death on 18 October 1938. The next day, The Times published his obituary, extracts of which read: :Mr. R. E. C. Long, correspondent in Berlin of The Economist and financial correspondent of the New York Times, died suddenly in Berlin yesterday, telegraphs our Berlin correspondent. He was suffering from influenza last month, when with other English correspondents, he had to leave Berlin temporarily, and complications developed on his return. Robert Edward Crozier Long was a foreign correspondent of long experience, well-versed in German history and literature, and with a profound knowledge of the background to developments of the past five years, on which, particularly on the economic side, he wrote with distinction. At the time of his death, he had been longer in Berlin than any other English (or British or Irish) correspondent. He had written several books, mainly on German, Russian and Scandinavian life and politics. He was one of the first English translators of Tchekov.\\" The Times, 19 October 1938 The 19 October 1938 edition of The New York Times devoted a lengthy column to him. The following are excerpts from his New York Times obituary: > ROBERT E. C.

When threatening war clouds gathered ominously over Europe in August 1939, the family left for France, England, and finally the United States. His widow Tatiana Mouravieva Long died on 29 March 1978, just a week short of her ninety-fourth birthday, and her ashes were scattered over her daughter's Ottawa rose garden. She was survived by her daughter Tania, her grandson Robert, her sister Vera and her niece Tatiana. Personal life Although he did not attend university, Robert Long did a good job of educating himself. Aside from his native English, he learned to speak fluent German and Russian and he also spoke very good, though somewhat accented French. In addition he spoke fairly passable Swedish and Danish and read Finnish. He was an active man who thoroughly enjoyed skating, swimming and sailing, and he owned his own boat. Fond of horses, he would often go out riding before breakfast in Berlin's Tiergarten Park. Being somewhat absent-minded, Robert would become so absorbed in his thoughts - planning his next article - that he would become completely oblivious to where he was or to where he was going. Upon one occasion, he found himself on horseback at Potsdamer Platz, Berlin's equivalent of Piccadilly Circus or Times Square! Upon another occasion he had gone out walking. His wife and daughter, who were out shopping, were both highly amused when they ran into Robert who bowed and politely tipped his hat to them. It was quite obvious he had no idea who they were! Robert had a dry, wry, almost sarcastic sense of humour. When, as a girl, Tania would play, for example, some new fox-trot record, he would say: \\"that's the tune the old cow died of!\\" Robert and Tatiana often attended concerts, the theatre and the opera, and they enjoyed dinner parties with their friends. Works During his forty years as a journalist, Long managed to find the time to read and translate books by Russian authors and to write several books and countless articles of his own: * The Reflections of a Russian Statesman (translated from the Russian), 1898 * The War of the Future, 1899 * The Black Monk 1903, (by Anton Chekhov) * The Kiss, 1908 (by Anton Chekhov) * Colours of War, 1915 (as Edward Edgeworth) * The Human German, 1915 * Russian Revolution Aspects, 1919 * The Swedish Woman (a novel), 1924 * The Mythology of Reparations, 1928 * and many articles in Fortnightly Review and other monthlies, chiefly on Russian, German and Scandinavian politics and literature.\\" Long was one of the first to translate Chekhov into English. According to the author's note in his translation of The Kiss and Other Stories, published in 1908, he states that his 1903 translations of The Black Monk and Other Stories \\"published five years ago (were) the only collection of Tchekhoff's stories that had up to that time appeared in English.\\" The Black Monk and Other Stories, Anton Chekhov, translated by R.E.C.

The poem, written after Newman's conversion from Anglicanism to Roman Catholicism, explores his new Catholic-held beliefs of the journey from death through Purgatory, thence to Paradise, and to God. The poem follows the main character as he nears death and then reawakens as a soul, preparing for judgment, following one of the most important events any human can experience: death. Newman uses the death and judgement of Gerontius as a prism through which the reader is drawn to contemplation of their own fear of death and sense of unworthiness before God. His depiction of the overwhelmed Gerontius in Phase Seven of the poem, who begs to be taken for purgatorial cleansing rather than diminish the perfection of God and his courts of Saints and Angels by his continued presence, has become a popular expression of humanity's desire for healing through redemptive suffering. This scene of the poem has done much for the rehabilitation of the doctrine of purgatory which had previously come to be seen as a fearful terror rather than a state of final purification essentially positive in nature. Newman said that the poem \\"was written by accident ‚Äì and it was published by accident\\". He wrote it up in fair copy from fifty-two scraps of paper between 17 January and 7 February 1865 and published it in May and June of the same year, in two parts in the Jesuit periodical The Month.Banfield, Stephen, \\"The Dream of Gerontius at 100: Elgar's Other Opera?\\", The Musical Times, Vol. 141, No. 1873 (Winter 2000), pp. 23‚Äì31 The poem inspired a choral work of the same name by Edward Elgar in 1900. Gerontius owes much of its imagery to the Divine Comedy of Dante Alighieri, an allegorical depiction of traveling through the realms of the dead. Structure The poem is divided into seven individual \\"phases\\", and is Newman's longest written poem. The seven phases are: 1.Gerontius, 2. Soul of Gerontius, 3. Soul, 4. Soul, 5. no title, 6. Angel, 7. Angel. The Phases The poem is divided into seven phases the first detailing Gerontius's final minutes in this world with the later phases illustrating his journey through the courts of Heaven. First Phase Gerontius is a dying man, who on his death bed in his final moments prays to Jesus and Mary for protection and receives the last sacraments. Gerontius isn‚Äôt confident with where he‚Äôs going in the afterlife and acknowledges he could be going to hell. Gerontius's friends pray to God, listing all the figures from the Bible who were provided with similar passages into Heaven. At the end of the phase a priest intones the \\"Proficiscere\\" and bids Gerontius to go forth to the inexpressible joys that await him. Second Phase Gerontius's disembodied soul awakens, \\"refreshed\\". Now awake as just a soul he feels free of time and has a new sense of freedom. Gerontius cannot tell if he‚Äôs alive or dead but assumes he is not dead because he feels nothing out of place. He believes he could get up if only he willed it but finds that \\"I cannot stir a hand or foot\\". All of this begins to disorient him and he begins to feel as if he is floating through space, or possibly that space is floating away from him. His Guardian Angel appears just as Gerontius begins to lose his mind. The angel tells Gerontius that the angel has been watching over him since birth and now the work is done. The angel goes on to explain that throughout Gerontius's life, he has been present to keep a balance of truth and sin, to never let Gerontius fall too far down the wrong way. Gerontius finally accepts after talking to the angel that he is dead. Third Phase The Angel states that Gerontius has barely left the physical realm behind, and goes on to explain that time and other such things are merely constructs made by humans, and no longer apply in the afterlife. He also explains that the only thing keeping Gerontius from God is his own thought. Gerontius also asks the Angel why he no longer fears meeting God, and instead, feels a sense of joy in their potential encounter. The Angel tells the soul that its sense of joy is a recompense proceeding from God to keep it in faith and hope while it passes through the coming demonic temptations. Fourth Phase The soul of Gerontius and the Angel arrive at \\"the judgment- court\\" where demons have assembled. The court is an old region that Satan used to run and used the court to attack people like Job. Satan's legions now run this area in hopes of \\"gathering souls for hell\\". They overhear the demons talking and laughing about Jesus's death. The demons mock those afraid of hell for being cowards because they turn to religion not because of love of the Lord but because of fear of the unknown. The soul of Gerontius asks the Angel why all of his senses still work except sight, \\"All has been darkness since I left the earth; Shall I remain thus sight-bereft all through my penance-time?\\" The Angel explains that his soul now exists in a world where he does not need senses but on the day of resurrection he will regain \\"all thou hast lost, new made and glorified\\". As for his sight he will remain blind through purgatory because purgatory ‚ÄúIs fire without its light.‚Äù The soul takes this in stride, \\"I am not worthy e'er to see again/The face of day\\". Despite being blind, Gerontius is told that he will see God for a split second during judgment. Fifth Phase The Soul and the Angel move onward into the House of Judgment, passing The First Choir of Angelicals whom they overhear singing the praises of God. The Angel explains that buildings in the afterlife are not made of material but made of life, ‚ÄúHoly, blessed and immortal beings/Who hymn their Maker‚Äôs praise continually.‚Äù The Second and Third Choirs of Angelicals are passed. The Third Choir sings about the impending fate of Gerontius, singing about the double agony of the body and soul. The Angel tells Gerontius of his coming beatific vision. The mere sight of God will fill him with love but also sicken him since, in spite of the wondrous grace the Lord showed in consenting to be crucified, Gerontius was a sinful being. This juxtaposition between the soul's natural yearning to see its loving God face to face and the rightful shame it feels for having sinned against Christ's perfect love is the cause of the soul's coming purgatorial agony. They arrive at the Sacred Stairs of the Presence-Chamber where Angels line the stairs on either side to help guide the way. As the fifth phase ends, the Fourth and Fifth Choirs of Angelicals arrive to sing to the soul of Gerontius as he prepares to climb the stairs. Sixth Phase The soul of Gerontius and his Guardian Angel are by this point very near to the \\"veiled presence of our God\\". Far removed from the earlier grandeur of the rhapsodic angelic hosts, Gerontius now finds only a dread and august silence which surrounds the throne of God. The echoes of the prayers for mercy uttered by the Priest and Gerontius's friends at the deathbed in Phase One are discernible in the stillness. Before the throne stands the Angel of the Agony, the same angel who comforted Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane, pleading for the salvation of all mankind. The Guardian Angel recommends Gerontius's case to this being's most powerful prayer. Once the Angel of the Agony has begged Jesus to be merciful to Gerontius and to hasten the purgatorial cleansing of all imperfect, saved souls, Gerontius declares himself ready to meet his God. Guided not by the Guardian Angel's cautious warnings but only by a fervent intemperate love for his Redeemer, Gerontius struggles free from his guardian's embrace and darts longingly to Jesus' feet. Having regained his sight the Soul gazes for a moment into the loving eyes of his Creator. The majesty of the Spirits that surround God however are too much for Gerontius to bear and sick with the love of his Crucified Lord and guilt for his earthly follies he painfully realises that, as yet, he is not ready to receive the beatific vision. He begs his guardian to rescue him from his plight and lead him to a place where, with his whole self still quickened and consumed by God's love, he can by trial and suffering be healed and remade in the image of his God: \\"Take me away, That sooner I may rise, and go above, And see Him in the truth of everlasting day!\\" Seventh Phase The Angel asks that the ‚Äúgolden prison open its gates‚Äù and allow the soul of Gerontius into the realm of Purgatory. The Angel asks for them to take care of him until the day he is allowed to leave into Heaven at which point the Angel will return to ‚Äúreclaim it for the courts of light.‚Äù The souls in Purgatory recite their mantra stating that the Lord will come for them and that they will wake up the next morning to find themselves filled with the Lord‚Äôs mercy and be allowed admittance into Heaven. As the poem comes to an end, the Angel softly releases the Soul of Gerontius, into Purgatory. The Angel tells him that the angels of Purgatory will tend to him and nurse him so he becomes ready to enter Heaven. He offers one last goodbye: ‚ÄúFarewell, but not for ever! brother dear, Be brave and patient on thy bed of sorrow; Swiftly shall pass thy night of trial here, And I will come and wake thee on the morrow.‚Äù Critical response The Dream of Gerontius was an immediate success upon its release, owing in part to the Victorian era's rising interest in such subjects as death, suicide, and the after-life. Other authors such as Philip James Bailey, or Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, like Newman, achieved much fame with their writings about the subject of mortality, but, unlike both Goethe and Bailey, Newman took the subject of death and the soul's \\"life\\" in the realm eternal, one step further. Because The Dream of Gerontius deals with the journey of the soul from life to death to Heaven, something not many authors and poets had done up to that point, many people wondered what inspirations Newman was drawing from when he wrote it. Some believed that Newman drew inspiration from an 11th-century hymn of Saint Peter Damian, \\"De Die Mortus Rythmus\\", when constructing his vision, but there are some who feel that Newman‚Äôs inspirations and motives were more personal. Due to its title, some believed that Newman drew inspiration for the poem from dreams and not from any religious text. Some also felt that the poem itself might not even deal with death at all, but rather be a vision of an old man‚Äîmaybe even Newman himself‚Äîworrying about life after death. Besides these various groups there were also some who viewed \\"Newman himself as carrying greater religious authority and credibility than any available creed or communion\\", and that the \\"Dream of Gerontius\\" was a vision of sage wisdom by a Cardinal in the Catholic Church. Whatever Newman's inspiration, \\"The Dream of Gerontius‚Äù remains one of the pivotal works on death and the soul of the Victorian era and one of Newman's most famous works.

It travels from Gawler (on National Highway A20, the Sturt Highway) to Port Wakefield Road (on National Highway A1). The road has been built to four-lane standard and provides a faster route between Adelaide and Gawler, whilst reducing the amount of traffic on Main North Road, which passes through the heart of the northern suburbs and is interspersed with frequent traffic lights. It also allows freight vehicles to avoid residential areas and go straight to Port Wakefield Road. Since March 2020, the North‚ÄìSouth Motorway continues west of Port Wakefield Road and intersects the Port River Expressway (A9) to reach the harbour at Port Adelaide. These are the northernmost two parts of the North‚ÄìSouth Corridor. Cycling is not permitted on the Expressway. The Stuart O'Grady Bikeway is a sealed shared cycling and walking path adjacent to the eastern side of the expressway. The northern end connects to the on-ramp from Two Wells Road to the Gawler Bypass Road, and the southern end is adjacent to Port Wakefield Road at Mill Road. History The largest road project undertaken in South Australia in at least sixty years, the expressway was delivered at a cost of approximately jointly funded by the South Australian and Commonwealth Governments. The Design and Construct contract was awarded to the Fulton Hogan York Joint Venture, a partnership between trans-Tasman contractor Fulton Hogan and South Australian based York Civil. The design joint venture, managed by Fulton Hogan York Joint Venture consisted of Maunsell, SMEC and Dare Sutton Clark. The work included an 8 km upgrade of the existing Port Wakefield Road. Part of the cost was covered by the AusLink national transport funding. Construction began in 2008 and the road opened on 13 September 2010. The interchanges/bridges along the expressway were all named after famous battles in which Australian forces fought, such as Long Tan, Kokoda, Tobruk, Kapyong and Hamel. In November 2013, one year after the death of prominent South Australian author and journalist Max Fatchen, the Northern Expressway was given the dual name \\"Fatchen Northern Expressway\\" in his honour. In December 2019, a Catastrophic bushfire started on the Northern Expressway at Angle Vale, This affected people in Hillier, Munno Para Downs, Kudla, Munno Para West and Gawler. In February 2020, the on ramp from northbound on Port Wakefield Road was permanently closed. Three weeks later, the Northern Connector project was opened, continuing the freeway south from the Northern Expressway as the North‚ÄìSouth Motorway.

There are no laws that either guarantee citizens' right to information or explicitly structure a censorship scheme. However, censorship in Bhutan is still conducted by restrictions on the ownership of media outlets, licensing of journalists, and the blocking of websites. Public criticism of the government Through 2008, individuals were able to criticize the government publicly; however, the government did at times attempt to impede criticism and monitor political meetings. Controls over media Bhutan has one government majority-owned newspaper, the Kuensel, five private newspapers, several magazines, and three internet service providers. In May 2007, the government proposed controls on advertising; after many unfavorable newspaper editorials, the government withdrew the proposal. Through 2008, newspapers operated freely and published stories critical of the government. Foreign newspapers and magazines were also available. Bhutan also has three private FM radio stations. Through 2008, the government allowed foreign broadcasts and did not censor broadcast content. Private radio and television stations were active and expressed a variety of views, although the government may have limited the number of television channels available. International organizations maintained that the cable costs were often more prohibitive than government restrictions. During the visit of the Indian Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh to Bhutan in May 2008, only journalists from the Bhutan Broadcasting Service and Kuensel were permitted to attend the function. Freelance journalists are also not able to work in Bhutan as officials respond only to journalists from the government media or 'authorized' private media. Media sources suggested that while there is commitment at the highest levels to provide the media with information, some media professionals continued to find it difficult to get access to information from bureaucrats and public officials, especially on issues of corruption and violations of the law. Bhutan does not yet have any legislation guaranteeing the citizens' right to information. Censorship on the Internet Individuals and groups are generally permitted to engage in peaceful expression of views via the Internet. Government officials state that the government does not block access, restrict content, or censor Web sites. However, Freedom House reports the government occasionally blocks access to Web sites containing pornography or information deemed offensive to the state; but that such blocked information typically does not extend to political content. In its Freedom of the Press 2012 report, Freedom House described high levels of self-censorship among media practitioners, despite few reports of official intimidation or threats.\\"Bhutan\\", Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2012, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State, 25 March 2013. Retrieved 25 December 2013. The constitution provides for freedom of speech including for members of the press, and the government generally respects these rights in practice. Citizens can publicly and privately criticize the government without reprisal. The constitution states that persons \\"shall not be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or her privacy, family, home, or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on the person‚Äôs honor and reputation,\\" and the government generally respects these prohibitions. The official forums of Kuensel online allow open criticism of the government though the forums are moderated, and anyone can post from an Internet caf√©. The forums of news portals such as U.S.-based The Bhutan Times (unrelated to the Bhutan Times newspaper) are much less moderated. The website was temporarily blocked by BICMA, Bhutan's media regulatory body, in 2007. Government officials said forum discussions on bhutantimes.com were too critical of Minister Sangey Nidup, maternal uncle of the king. In August 2007, bhutantimes.com reported that the government lifted its block on service within the country. BICMA's censorship pattern appears to reflect individual sensitivities of people who may have been discussed online.  Censorship of the Press in Bhutan  Journalists in Bhutan face very little freedom of the media. They are faced with criminal charges just for posts on their personal Facebook accounts. From 2016-2018, there have been two new cases regarding the prosecution of journalists who posted on their personal Facebook accounts about property disputes and child mistreatment. While the facts of these two incidents happened to be true, they both were still sentenced to 3 months in prison and required to pay a heavy fine. Bhutan government officials have enacted new laws that restricts what can be shared on social media. While the constitution in Bhutan guarantees freedom of speech, civil servants, such as journalists, are denied this right because of a law that states, \\"A civil servant shall not critique his agency and the Royal Government,\\". Bhutan is praised for its high level of \\"gross domestic happiness\\" but its people are beginning to face increasingly strict censorship in the media. Laws Modernly, Bhutan has regulated its domestic media since enactment of the Bhutan Information Communications and Media Act in July 2006. It created an independent body, the Bhutan Information Communications and Media Authority (BICMA), which was formerly a part of the Ministry for Information and Communications. BICMA is responsible for regulating communications, their technology, and their means in Bhutan The Act provides for considerable discretion, including that consideration be given to \\"peace, stability and well-being\\" in taking over communications services and facilities, intercepting communications, regulatory rulemaking, issuing permits to publish materials, show films, and perform dramas, blocking access to protest websites, and banning certain foreign publications in the national interest. The Act further provides penalties for failure to comply with prohibitory orders by BICMA, and empowers the government to enter private property to search and seize when the agency \\"reasonably suspects\\" regulatory violations. According to Freedom House's 2010 annual report, the media law adopted in 2006 led to the establishment of two independent radio stations, but did not provide specific protections for journalists or guarantee freedom of information. Two independent weeklies and the state-owned newspaper generally published articles favorable to the government and covered criticism of the government only occasionally. The older National Security Act is a series of sixteen articles enacted by Parliament on November 2, 1992. Several of its provisions prohibit criticism of the king and the political system. The Act punishes those who undermine or attempt to undermine Bhutan's security by creating or inciting \\"hatred and disaffection,\\" including by speech, with imprisonment for up to ten years. Speech and other acts that create \\"misunderstanding or hostility between the government and people of Bhutan and the Government and people of any foreign country\\" are punishable by up to five years' imprisonment. Furthermore, the Act allows up to three years' imprisonment for those who speak or act to promote or attempt to promote \\"feelings of enmity or hatred between different religious, racial or language groups or castes and communities, or commits any act which is prejudicial to the maintenance of harmony between different religious, racial or language groups or castes or communities, and which disturbs or is likely to disturb the public tranquility.\\" As such, the Act criminalizes hate speech and propaganda harmful to foreign relations. In practice, some criticism of the government was allowed, including critical postings on government Web sites. Certain other pieces of Bhutanese legislation provide for content-based restrictions on speech. For example, the Tobacco Control Act of 2010 makes depictions of tobacco use in motion media other than for health promotion constitute a petty misdemeanor.

It was discovered on 20 March 2001, by American amateur astronomers Don Wells and Alex Cruz at the George Observatory in Needville, Texas. The dark asteroid was named for American writer C. J. Cherryh.  Orbit and classification  Cherryh is a non-family asteroid from the main belt's background population. It orbits the Sun in the central asteroid belt at a distance of 2.1‚Äì3.1 AU once every 4 years and 2 months (1,528 days; semi-major axis of 2.6 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.17 and an inclination of 3¬∞ with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins in October 1990, with a precovery taken by Spacewatch, more than 10 years prior to its official discovery observation at Needville.  Naming  This minor planet was named by the discovering members of the Fort Bend Astronomy Club (FBAC), after C. J. Cherryh (born 1942), the award-winning American science fiction and fantasy author. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 13 July 2004 ().  Physical characteristics  According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Cherryh measures 3.985 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.049. The asteroid's spectral type is unknown. Based on its low geometric albedo it is likely a carbonaceous C-type asteroid. As of 2018, no rotational lightcurve of Cherryh has been obtained from photometric observations. The body's rotation period, pole and shape remain unknown.

These guns were used from 1942 until the end of World War II. History M-42 45 mm anti-tank gun in Finnish Tank Museum in Parola The M-42 was developed by the No. 172 Plant in Motovilikha as an upgrade of the 45 mm anti-tank gun M1937 (53-K). The gun received a longer barrel (L66, 20 calibers more than the previous one, so it was a 45 mm/L66), shells with more powerful cartridges, and a thicker shield (7 mm instead of 4.5 mm), but of hinged construction as a need for reduced profile, requiring crews to kneel while serving the weapon. Some minor changes were also introduced in order to speed up production. These guns were used from 1942 until the end of World War II. In 1943, due to its insufficient anti-armor capabilities against new German tanks such as the Tiger, Panther and Panzer IV Ausf H, the M-42 was partially replaced in mass production by the more powerful 57 mm ZiS-2 anti-tank gun. The M-42 remained in production however, as it was quite effective against lighter vehicles and could pierce the side armour of the Panther and Panzer IV Ausf H. Fragmentation shells and canister shot gave the gun some anti-personnel capability. Mass production of the M-42 ceased in mid-1945. The total number of guns produced is 10,843.

The Senators defeated Vancouver three games to two in the best-of-five game series to become the first team to win back- to-back Cup championships since the 1912/1913 Quebec Bulldogs. Paths to the Finals Ottawa won the first half of the 1920‚Äì21 NHL regular season while the Toronto St. Patricks won the second half, setting up a two-game total goals series between the two clubs to determine the NHL title. The Senators recorded 5‚Äì0 and 2‚Äì0 shutout victories to advance to the Cup final. Meanwhile, Vancouver finished the 1920‚Äì21 PCHA regular season in first place with a 13‚Äì11 record, and defeated the second place Seattle Metropolitans in a championship series to win the PCHA title. Game summaries The series took place at Vancouver's Denman Arena, where the attendance per game during the series averaged over 10,000 people. The attendance for the first game was 11,000, setting a new world record for the largest crowd to see a hockey game, only to be topped in the fifth game. The Millionaires won games one and four with victories of 3‚Äì1 and 3‚Äì2, respectively. The Senators were victorious in games two and three with 4‚Äì3 and 3‚Äì2 wins. Then in the fifth game, Jack Darragh scored both of Ottawa's goals in the 2‚Äì1 victory to clinch the Cup. In game one, played under western rules of seven-men hockey, the Millionaires took a 2‚Äì0 lead after the first period on goals by Alf Skinner and Art Duncan. Smokey Harris scored in the second to stretch the lead to 3‚Äì0 before Darragh put Ottawa on the board with five minutes to play in the second. The third period was scoreless, giving the first win and the series lead to the Millionaires. Skinner was badly cut in the game and was sent to the hospital. In game two, played under eastern rules of six-man hockey, the Millionaires took the lead 3‚Äì2 after one period on goals by Harris, Duncan and Jack Adams. Ottawa tied it the second on a goal by Darragh. Punch Broadbent scored the winning goal with four minutes to play in the third period. Game three was again played under western rules. Skinner remained out. Lloyd Cook opened the scoring for Vancouver in the second minute but Darragh countered for Ottawa five minutes later. Ottawa took the lead in the second with goals by Cy Denneny and Sprague Cleghorn before Jack Adams countered for Vancouver seven minutes later. Ottawa held off the Millionaires with a strong defensive third period to win the game and take the series lead. Game four was played under eastern rules. The first period was scoreless. Skinner put Vancouver ahead early in the second but Boucher tied it up for Ottawa and the teams entered the third period tied 1‚Äì1. In the third, Skinner scored again and Cook scored to put Vancouver up by two goals. Broadbent scored for Ottawa a minute later. Vancouver held off the Senators to win the game and tie the series. In the fifth and deciding game, it was estimated that 12,000 attended and 3,000 were turned away. Skinner scored to put Vancouver up 1‚Äì0 after the first period. Darragh scored twice for Ottawa in the second period to put the Senators ahead with one period to play. With two minutes to play, Cook was body-checked by Eddie Gerard and retaliated. Cleghorn then decked Cook with a punch to the jaw and a free-for- all broke out, only ended by the police going onto the ice. The three were penalized and Ottawa finished the game with five players, while Vancouver finished with six. Ottawa held on to win the game two‚Äì1 and the series and retained the championship. After the game, the teams exchanged sweaters and much of the Ottawas' equipment was taken away by souvenir hunters. Darragh led the Senators in scoring with five goals during the series, while goaltender Clint Benedict only allowed just 12 goals in the five games, earning a 2.40 goals-against average. Since all games were played in Vancouver, the three wins by the Senators meant they were the first team to win three road games in a Final series. Darragh had had to get special permission from his job with Ottawa Dairy Company, at the request of Ottawa mayor Frank Plant, to play in the final. Alf Skinner led the scoring for Vancouver with four goals. It was the final Stanley Cup series for Cyclone Taylor. Vancouver coach Frank Patrick remarked after the series: \\"You have the greatest team I have ever saw. Ottawa ought to be proud of those boys. Their defensive system is marvellous. They are better than the 'Little Men of Iron', the 'Silver Seven' or any other sextet I have ever watched. It was no disgrace to lose to that aggregation.\\" Stanley Cup engraving The 1921 Stanley Cup was presented by the trophy's trustee William Foran. The Senators never did engrave their name on the Cup for their championship season. It was not until the trophy was redesigned in 1948 that the words \\"1921 Ottawa Senators\\" was put onto its then-new collar.

Battle On 27 March PAVN sapper units attacked ƒê·ª©c Hu·ªá () which was held by the ARVN 83rd Ranger Battalion. The initial attack was repulsed as was a subsequent infantry attack by the PAVN 5th Division. Following the failure of these attacks the PAVN laid siege to ƒê·ª©c Hu·ªá. Under orders to maintain a loose siege of ƒê·ª©c Hu·ªá, the PAVN, assisted by the local sapper battalion, blocked the only land access to the camp and continued the artillery bombardment but abandoned the idea of taking it by storm. On the ARVN side, the 25th Division committed a task force consisting of a battalion of the 46th Infantry Regiment, a battalion of the 50th Infantry Regiment, and a tank company to break the siege. Fighting raged in the paddies east and north of the camp for several days, and the Republic of Vietnam Air Force (RVNAF) provided effective support to the counterattacking infantry, losing an A-1 Skyraider and an observation aircraft to SA-7 antiaircraft missiles. Meanwhile, the ARVN task force command post was hit by PAVN 107mm. rocket fire and the commander was one of those killed. As April wore on, the threat of renewed assaults on ƒê·ª©c Hu·ªá by the PAVN 5th Division remained. The situation was particularly dangerous because the PAVN 7th and 9th Divisions were probing aggressively in the eastern part of III Corps. Lt. Gen. Ph·∫°m Qu·ªëc Thu·∫ßn, III Corps commander, determined that he must reduce the threat to his western flank and the T√¢y Ninh corridor while he had the opportunity to do so before the onset of the southwest monsoon. After the rains started, most of the land around ƒê·ª©c Hu·ªá and the Angel's Wing () would be under water. The plan was complicated but workable. General Thu·∫ßn used 18 of his own maneuver battalions and flew to Can Tho where he coordinated with General Nguy·ªÖn Vƒ©nh Nghi for a supporting attack by 2 IV Corps battalions from the M·ªôc H√≥a sector. The details and timing of the operation were carefully safeguarded, and few, if any, Americans in the Defense Attach√© Office, Saigon knew anything about it until 27 April when 45 RVNAF sorties struck targets in Cambodia and known and suspected bases of the PAVN 5th Division. These strikes began Phase I, which lasted through the 28th and included infantry sweeps by two Regional Force (RF) battalions between the V√†m C·ªè ƒê√¥ng River and the northern shoulder of the Angel's Wing. Meanwhile, the 49th Infantry Regiment, less one battalion, and the 7th Ranger Group, also short one battalion, left assembly areas near Hi·ªáp Ho√† () on the V√†m C·ªè ƒê√¥ng and advanced westward through the swamplands, past ƒê·ª©c Hu·ªá to the Cambodian frontier. To the south, three RF battalions provided security by conducting reconnaissance in northern Long An Province, generally between the Bo Bo Canal and the V√†m C·ªè ƒê√¥ng. Another supporting maneuver, which quickly developed into a major operation, was the attack into Svay Rieng Province south of the Elephant's Foot () by two battalions from IV Corps. The northernmost of the two advanced from the border area north of M·ªôc H√≥a and established a blocking position near the local Route 1012 that led eastward from an assembly area occupied by the PAVN 5th Division. The other battalion crossed midway between the Elephant's Foot and the tip of the Parrot's Beak and established a lodgment on the southeastern edge of the PAVN logistical base and assembly area in Svay Rieng. While Phase I of the ARVN sweep into Svay Rieng was getting started, on 28 April the PAVN struck heavily at Long Kh·ªët (), an ARVN post and district town at the inside curve of the Elephant's Foot. Whether the attack was pre-planned or reactive was unknown, regardless, PAVN tanks were reported at first by the defenders. Later, aerial observers correctly determined that the vehicles were captured M113 armored personnel carriers. The defenders held strongly against the PAVN 275th Regiment and 25th Sapper Battalion of the 5th Division. More than 100 sorties were flown on the 28th against PAVN positions, weapons and vehicles in the Svay Rieng area, many of them in support of Long Kh·ªët. On this same day, the ARVN at Long Kh·ªët captured nine prisoners from the 275th Regiment and four from its supporting artillery, which had been employing 122mm. guns and U.S. 105-mm. howitzers. as well as AT-3 antitank missiles and SA-7 antiaircraft missiles. Many PAVN weapons were salvaged, and 75 PAVN soldiers were counted dead on the battlefield. Not only were the Long Kh·ªët defenders tenacious and prepared for the onslaught, but the RVNAF proved its worth in close support as over the two days, the 27th and 28th, it flew 188 tactical and logistical sorties in the Svay Rieng Campaign. In a departure from normal practice, the 3rd Air Division supporting III Corps in the Svay Rieng campaign, located a forward command post at Cu Chi Base Camp alongside the III Corps forward command post in order to improve coordination and responsiveness. Combat pilots returned to their bases with morale-building reports about PAVN troops throwing down their weapons and running when faced with low-level strafing. By the night of 28 April, 11 ARVN battalions of infantry, RF, and Rangers were conducting screening, blocking, and reconnaissance-in-force operations as a prelude to Phase II of the Svay Rieng sweep. Meanwhile, the RVNAF was attacking PAVN troop locations and bases, and Long Kh·ªët was fighting off a violent PAVN armor, artillery, and sapper- infantry attack. In Phase II, originally planned by General Thu·∫ßn to encompass only three days of armored sweeps into the Cambodian bases of the PAVN 5th Division, three columns drove west, generally parallel to each other, crossing the frontier west of Go Dau Ha () and penetrating as deeply as 15km into Svay Rieng before wheeling south and southwest into H·∫≠u Nghƒ©a Province. Making the main effort and the deepest penetration was Task Force 315 with the 15th Armored Cavalry Squadron, the 64th Ranger Battalion, and a company of medium tanks as its striking force. Supported by a composite battery of 105-mm. and 155-mm. artillery this northernmost column crossed the border through the paddies south of Highway 1 and attacked west, turning south short of the swampy ground east of Chiphu (), following local Route 1012 toward the blocking position held by a IV Corps battalion near Ph Chek (). It was screened on its right flank by a mobile RF battalion that advanced along Highway 1 about 12km inside the international frontier. Along the center axis, which started about 2km south of Task Force 315, was Task Force 318, built around the 18th Armored Cavalry Squadron, a Ranger battalion, a tank company and a howitzer battery. This column drove west for about 10km before turning inside the sweep south by Task Force 315. Task Force 310, the only one of the attacking columns without tanks, had a battalion each from the 18th and 25th Infantry Divisions and the 3rd Troop, 10th Armored Cavalry, along with a supporting howitzer battalion it crossed into Svay Rieng just north of the southern tip of the Angel's Wing, along Cambodian Route 1013 and wheeled south inside Task Force 318, generally along the international boundary. In reserve at Go Dau Ha General Thu·∫ßn had 2 companies of medium tanks of the 22nd Tank Battalion, a cavalry troop from the 1st Armored Cavalry Squadron, a battalion of infantry from the 18th Division, and a battery of 105-mm. howitzers. Designated Task Force 322, this powerful force was ready 10 exploit opportunities uncovered by the attacking echelons. The 3rd Armored Brigade controlled operations from Go Dau Ha. 54 UH-1 helicopters mustered for the campaign were effectively used in surprise air assaults into PAVN defenses. Secrecy was more rigidly enforced in this campaign than perhaps any operation since the ceasefire, partly because it was important to surprise the PAVN 5th Division in garrison and partly to conceal, for political reasons, an ARVN offensive into Cambodia. By 29 April Task Force 315 had penetrated about 7km into Cambodia at the cost of only one wounded, but had killed nearly 50 PAVN and captured one prisoner. To the south Task Force 318 had experienced similar success, killing nearly 60 and capturing 5 while suffering only 6 wounded. The following morning, the 315th continued the attack, killing 40 more and sustaining light casualties. Meanwhile, the RVNAF was pounding the PAVN with nearly 200 sorties, accounting for nearly 100 killed, destroying many storage and defensive positions and knocking out mortar and antiaircraft positions. As the threat to the 5th Division base in southern Svay Rieng became critical the PAVN was compelled to reduce the pressure on Long Kh·ªët and concentrate on attempting to relieve the E-6 and 174th Regiments and logistical installations lying in the path of the ARVN armored thrusts. By the end of April, nearly 300 PAVN soldiers had been killed in ground combat, over 100 more had been killed by RVNAF air strikes, and 17 prisoners of war were in ARVN hands. On the other hand, the speed, audacity and superior air-ground coordination that characterized the attack had kept South Vietnamese casualties extremely low: only 21 killed and 64 wounded. In fact, success was so striking that General Thu·∫ßn elected to extend the operation a few days. Further west in the Elephant's Foot, matters were becoming desperate for the PAVN 275th Regiment and its supporting troops. The ARVN 7th Division had moved a forward command post into M·ªôc H√≥a and was controlling the operation of two task forces then committed in the Elephant's Foot. One was composed of the 15th Infantry, 9th Division and part of the 16th Armored Cavalry Squadron; the other included the 10th Infantry and elements of the 6th Armored Cavalry Squadron, in 12 days of fighting in the border area, these two mobile task forces killed 850 PAVN soldiers, captured 31, collected over 100 weapons, and suffered fewer than 300 casualties, including 39 killed. Making the adjustments required by the situation, particularly the fact that the most lucrative PAVN contacts were being made in the southern sweeps of the 315th and 310th Task Forces, General Thu·∫ßn ordered Task Force 315 withdrawn from its northern axis on 2 May and returned to Go Dau Ha where it reverted to reserve. Meanwhile Task Force 322 was committed and advanced about 4km into the center of the Angel's Wing, and the infantry battalions of the 25th Division continued their sweep between ƒê·ª©c Hu·ªá and Go Dau Ha. By 6 May the land route to ƒê·ª©c Hu·ªá Camp was secured and was being improved by ARVN combat engineers, the threat to the vital road junction at Go Dau Ha was substantially reduced, and the ARVN was in complete control of the battlefield. The tank-heavy 322nd Task Force turned south and headed for Ba Thu (), the long-held PAVN base on the border southwest of ƒê·ª©c Hu·ªá. On 10 May, the offensive ended, the last ARVN forces began their march homeward. Their sortie had killed nearly 300 PAVN soldiers, captured 17, collected 100 weapons, and seriously disrupted the communications and logistics of the PAVN 5th Division. Aftermath The operation was an ARVN success. ARVN claimed PAVN losses of over 1200 killed and 65 captured and the 5th Division's base area severely damaged, while ARVN losses were less than 100 killed. Despite its success, this was the last major South Vietnamese offensive of the war. The severe constraints on ammunition expenditures, fuel usage, and flying hours permitted no new initiatives. Although the South Vietnamese armed forces could react strongly to local threats within supporting distances of major bases, outlying threats were beyond their capability to cope with.

The river basin measures in size, with the drainage divided by the Gbengbe and Kabala hills and the Sula Mountains. The estuary which extends over an area of became a Ramsar wetland site of importance in 1999. Geography The Rokel rises in the high interior plateau of the Loma Mountains, in the Guinea Highlands of north central Sierra Leone, flows southwest about through hill ranges and, together with a smaller, parallel stream called Port Loko Creek, feeds into the Rokel estuary before entering the Atlantic Ocean. The estuary, after it joins the Bankasoka River, is also called the Sierra Leone River, is in length and has a width of . Freetown and Pepel are the two ports located on the shores of the estuary. As the estuary widens and joins the Atlantic its width is about . The southern shore is the deepest and forms a natural harbour, which is reported to be the third largest in the world. Mangrove swamps and the mud flats are the dominant ecosystem (accounting for 19% of the mangrove forest in the country) noted around the river's ria. The river basin measures in size, with the drainage divided by the Gbengbe and Kabala hills and the Sula Mountains. The Rokel drops at the Bumbuna waterfalls. Mangrove species recorded are Rhizophora, Avicennia, Laguncularia, and Conocarpus, which cover an area of . Sierra Leone's capital city of Freetown lies at the entrance to the Sierra Leone River, about from the port of Pepel. Geology Rokel River and its tributaries are defined as the \\"Rokel River Group\\" for geological study. The geological formation in this group is reported to be of the Tabe formation with glacial sediments dominating its eastern edge and are exposed along the river in some stretches; the geological formation noted in the river is granite rocks. The formation is broadly categorized as folded sedimentary rocks. It is also reported that its orogeny belongs to the Pan African thermo- tectonic age of about 550 Ma. Geologically it is a tectonically controlled basin with formations of Precambrian, Infra-Cambrian and Pleistocene age. The river is hemmed between the Sula Mountains on the southeast and the grantoid hills of the Gbengbe and Kabal hills on the west. The notable cascade in the river is known as the Bumbuna water falls where the river drops by providing for building a hydroelectric project. History John MacCormac, an Irish businessman, settled on Timbo Island in 1816 and started exporting African Oak from the Rokel River. The trade was quite substantial for a while but eventually went into decline. Iron ore and alluvial gold mining began in the late 1920s and early 1930s, while the Bumbuna Falls hydroelectric project is underway. The Yalunka people established their capital, Falaba, near the source of the Rokel. The estuary, which extends over an area of , was listed as Ramsar site of wetland importance in 1999. The site is bounded by Cape Point on the western side of the Freetown, by the Bunce River on one of its banks, and the Tagrin Point where areas of the Rokel joins at the southern end of its mouth. Development The Rokel river flow has been measured at three gauge stations. The reported maximum and minimum discharge at Magbass, one of the three stations, are and respectively. There are many projects developed in the river basin which derive their water supply requirements from this river. The iron ore mining at Marampa is dependent on pumped water supply from the river. A Rokel River Water Rights Agreement (Ratification) Act was signed with the developers of the mines; the mines are in operation since 1933 to 1975 by Sierra Leone Development Company (DELCO) and Astro Minerals from 1983. The water agreement provides ‚Äúexclusive and preferential rights to the use of the Rokel waters by special agreement‚Äù for a period of 89 years from 1 January 1938. The environmental impacts on the downstream users and disposal of tailings from the mining operations have not been addressed. The iron extracted has resulted in reduction of the height of one the ore bearing hills by . Gold mining in the Sula Mountains and in the Rokel river sediments was an extensive operation undertaken since 1929 in the river and its tributaries after gold was found in the mountains. Steam sediment studies were carried out for assessing the mineral concentration of arsenic. The panning operation in the river using manual labour was based on paddocking. This alluvial gold mining operation has been described as environmentally destructive as forest denudation for the purpose of mining caused extensive erosion of the hills and consequent sedimentation of the river and its tributaries. The Bumbuna Dam has been developed on the river by building a high dam in the narrow reach of the river, which has created a lake that stretches upstream. The Magbass Irrigation Project was implemented downstream of the dam. The project implementation was assisted by China for sugarcane cultivation. The project, implemented in 1980, is located at Magbass on the banks of the river and has an irrigation command of . Flora and fauna The flora in the estuary consists of mangrove forest. The avi fuana in the area consists of 10,000 birds of 36 species (1995 record). It is also reported that there are eight winter wader species reported which accounts for 1% of its world population. The eight species of palaearctic migrant waders recorded are: * Ringed plover (Charadrius hiaticula) * Kentish plover (Pluvialis squatarola) * Sanderling (Calidris alba) * Curlew sandpiper (Calidris ferruginea) * Eurasian whimbrel (Numeniusphaeopus) * green shank (Tringa nebularia) * red shank (Tringa totanus) * Western reef heron (Egrette gularis) References Bibliography    Category:Rivers of Sierra Leone Category:Ramsar sites in Sierra Leone ","title":"Rokel River"},{"id":"5822769","text":"WAMX (106.3 FM, \\"106.3 The Brew\\") is a classic rock radio station licensed to Milton, West Virginia, serving the Huntington metro area.

Yet the government proves uncertain and the writers persistent. In March 1963 \\"the gavel fell on the great debate\\", or so it appears, writes Harrison E. Salisbury, Moscow correspondent for The New York Times. Khrushchev announces that Soviet writers are the servants of the Communist Party and must reflect its orders. Among the authors he specifically targets are the poets Yevgeny Yevtushenko and Andrei Voznesensky. Yevtushenko, on a tour of European cities earlier in the year, recites before large audiences, including a capacity audience at the Palais de Chaillot in Paris, and then returns home. \\"Literary Stalinists took over almost all the key publishing positions\\", Salisbury writes. Yet the artists and writers who are criticized either refuse to recant or do so in innocuous language. Alexander Tvardovsky, editor of the magazine Novy Mir, publishes three brutally frank stories by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, for instance. By midsummer, the effects of the announced crackdown appear nil, with authors publishing essentially as before.Britannica Book of the Year 1964 (covering events of 1963), published 1963 by The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, \\"Literature\\" article, pp 508-519 After the Union of Soviet Writers rebukes Voznesensky, he replies \\"with what is regarded as a classic nonconfessional confession\\", according to Voznesensky's 2010 obituary in the Times: \\"It has been said that I must not forget the strict and severe words of Nikita Sergeyevich [Khrushchev].

It was created by Soviet artillery designer M.N. Loginov of Plant No. 8 (now Kalinin Machine- Building Plant) after the arrest and execution of former designer V. von Behring. Due to insufficient armor penetration it was replaced in service by the longer-barreled M-42 in 1942. Production of the gun ceased in 1943, with a total of 37,354 units built from 1937 to 1943. History The 53-K was essentially an improved version 19-K anti-tank gun mounted on a 37 mm 1-K anti-tank gun chassis (itself a licensed copy of the 3.7 cm Pak 36) using modern ammunition. Other improvements comprised semi-automatic breech, sight, firing button, suspension, reliable shield mount, and movable part re- balancing. The sum of evolutionary improvements resulted in a significantly different design to justify the new factory code (53-K).–°–æ—Ä–æ–∫–æ–ø—è—Ç–∫–∞ The then- experimental gun went to the NIAP after factory testings were completed. It fired a total of 897 shells and traveled a total of 684 km for the entire testing duration from August to September 1937. Despite passing firing tests, suspension springs of the gun broke during travel tests. A further experimental series of 6 pieces were built in November 1937, which bore a number of improvements from the original design. The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and the 6th guns were sent to military testing, while the 5th gun was retained for the plant's own use. The guns underwent factory testing from December 1937 to January 1938. The 3rd gun (barrel number 0734) was sent with a Ya-3 limber was sent to the NIAP, arriving on 28 January, having already fired 605 shots during factory tests. NIAP staff then took the gun apart before improperly re- assembling the gun, which caused some parts to be damaged. The gun fired 1217 shells (798 of them armor-piercing and 419 high explosive shells). Both the original design and the improved, 7 November 1936-finalized M1937 design had identical rates of fire when fired manually without gunnery correction, while the M1937 design fired faster than the M1932 when mechanically fired via a pushbutton, at 13% for AP and 6% for HE shells. Throughout the test the gun had 16 misfires, 13 of them when firing AP and 3 when firing HE, partly associated with shell casing quality. The recoil mechanism screw broke after the 281st shot, but the automation mechanism was generally viewed as satisfactory. The M1937 then traveled a total of 2074 km during travel tests at a travel speed of 30-35 km/h on cobblestone roads, 50-60 km/h on paved roads, and 15-30 km/h off-road without a limber. Three 53-K guns (Nos. 1, 2 and 4) were sent to military testing in early 1938 with Ya-3 limbers. Six T-20 Komsomolets artillery tractors also participated in the tests. The guns fired on average 450 shells without failures, and traveled from Moscow via Kharkov to Krasnodar. The gun was cleared for production after minor defects were fixed, and was accepted into service as the 45 mm anti-tank gun M1937 on 24 April 1938. Production ceased at the Kalinin plant on 6 June 1938, but Plant 235 continued production all the way until 1944. In addition to serving in the Red Army, 53-K guns were also supplied to Republican Spain and were used by the International Brigades in the British Anti-tank Battery of the XV Brigade, who served from the Battle of Brunete onwards. Richard Baxell notes that the gun in Spain \\"was effective against even heavy tanks at distances of up to three kilometers.\\" Richard Baxell Unlikely Warriors: the British in the Spanish Civil War and the Struggle against Fascism (London: Aurum Press 2012) p223 The guns also saw service in first stage of the German-Soviet War, but their anti-armor capabilities allowed them to fight successfully only with German light tanks and armored personnel carriers. Early models of the Panzer III and Panzer IV could also be knocked out at close range, but this put Soviet artillerymen in greater danger. Due to these circumstances, model 1937 guns were replaced with an all-new design, the more powerful model 1942. The mass production of outdated model 1937 guns was stopped in 1943. The total number of guns produced was 37,354. The German designation for captured M1937 guns was the 4.5 cm Pak 184/1(r). Two such guns were employed as an anti-tank platoon, organic to each rifle battalion. Additionally twelve guns were in anti-tank battalions of each rifle division. It was also used by separate anti-tank regiments (4-5 batteries of 4 guns each).

Instituted on 24 November 1714 by Peter the Great on the occasion of his marriage to Catherine I of Russia. For the majority of the time of Imperial Russia, it was the only award for women; the Insignia of Saint Olga existed briefly from 1916 to 1917, but ceased with the fall of the Romanov dynasty. The statutes of the Order were first published in 1713, and the order was under the patronage of Saint Catherine of Alexandria, the patron saint of the Empress. On 24 November 1714, on the Empress' name day, Peter the Great personally bestowed the insignia of the Order upon the Empress Catherine, creating her Grand Mistress of the Order. However, no further members were inducted until 1726. Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna, who died in 1928, was the last Grand Mistress of the Order of Saint Catherine. Today, the claimant to the headship of the former Imperial House Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna claims the right to confer the Order.  Classes  The award was bestowed in two classes: * Dame Grand Cross (entitled to both the Sash badge and the Star) * Dame Lesser Cross (entitled to the Badge)  Insignia  *A Riband (sash) of scarlet moir√© with silver edges embroidered with the inscription: (, \\"For Love and the Fatherland\\"). *The Badge (or Jewel) of the Order consisted of a cross with a large medallion set in the center of it. On the medallion was depicted the order's patron saint, Catherine of Alexandria, holding a large white cross, the symbol of her martyrdom. In the four quadrants formed by the cross are written the initials, \\"D.S.F.R.\\" (Domine Salvum Fac Regem, God Save the Tsar). The Badge was attached to the Riband. On the obverse is an image of eagles destroying a nest of snakes at the foot of a ruined tower, at the top of which is a nest of eaglets. Above is the motto Aequant Munia Comparis (\\"By her works she is to her husband compared\\"). *The Star (or Plaque) consisted of a medallion set on a silver, eight-pointed star with rays, encrusted with diamonds. On the red medallion in the center is depicted the wheel of Saint Catherine (symbol of her martyrdom) surmounted by a cross. Encircling the medallion is the motto of the order (the same as on the Riband).  Membership  Greater Cross: Badge Every Russian Grand Duchess was conferred the Grand Cross of the Order at her christening (or marriage into the Romanov family), and Princesses of the Imperial Blood were invested upon attaining their majority at 18. In addition to the royal members, a fixed number (106) of other members were permitted by the statutes: * 12 Dames Grand Cross * 94 Dames Small Cross The 12 Dames Grand Cross were typically female members of foreign ruling houses. Queen Alexandra of Great Britain was made a Dame Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Catherine by Alexander II, and Princess Alice of Greece was also a member of the Order. The only known award of the order to a male was in 1727 to then 13-year-old prince Alexander Menshikov, son of Aleksandr Danilovich Menshikov, closest friend of Emperor Peter I of Russia. The Dames Small Cross were all women of the highest nobility, who were part of the suite of the Empress and had engaged in important philanthropic or charitable works outside of their duties at Court.  Annual function  Replica of Catherine II's wedding dress (1745) featuring the scarlet sash of the Order of Saint Catherine The Order of Saint Catherine's annual function was held on , the feast day of Saint Catherine of Alexandria. The Order met for a celebration of the Divine Liturgy. Then, wearing the robes and the insignia of the Order, the women of the Imperial Family, followed by the 106 Dames Grand and Small Cross would go in procession from the Imperial Chapel to a banqueting hall specially prepared for the occasion. The Hall of Saint Catherine in the Great Kremlin Palace in Moscow was used for these occasions. The coloring and decoration of the hall incorporate those of the Order. The hall also served as the throne room for the Empress Consort. To this day, in the Russian Federation uses this room to receive foreign dignitaries.

Domains consisting of ankyrin tandem repeats mediate protein‚Äìprotein interactions and are among the most common structural motifs in known proteins. They appear in bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic proteins, but are far more common in eukaryotes. Ankyrin repeat proteins, though absent in most viruses, are common among poxviruses. Most proteins that contain the motif have four to six repeats, although its namesake ankyrin contains 24, and the largest known number of repeats is 34, predicted in a protein expressed by Giardia lamblia. Ankyrin repeats typically fold together to form a single, linear solenoid structure called ankyrin repeat domains. These domains are one of the most common protein‚Äìprotein interaction platforms in nature. They occur in a large number of functionally diverse proteins, mainly from eukaryotes. The few known examples from prokaryotes and viruses may be the result of horizontal gene transfers. The repeat has been found in proteins of diverse function such as transcriptional initiators, cell cycle regulators, cytoskeletal, ion transporters, and signal transducers. The ankyrin fold appears to be defined by its structure rather than its function, since there is no specific sequence or structure that is universally recognised by it. Considering the atomic structures of individual ankyrin repeats, the loop is often a type 1 beta bulge loop, while both alpha-helices commonly have a Schellman loop at their N-terminus.  Role in protein folding  The ankyrin-repeat sequence motif has been studied using multiple sequence alignment to determine conserved amino acid residues critical for folding and stability. The residues on the wide lateral surface of ankyrin repeat structures are variable, often hydrophobic, and involved mainly in mediating protein‚Äìprotein interactions. An artificial protein design based on a consensus sequence derived from sequence alignment has been synthesized and found to fold stably, representing the first designed protein with multiple repeats. More extensive design strategies have used combinatorial sequences to \\"evolve\\" ankyrin-repeats that recognize particular protein targets, a technique that has been presented as an alternative to antibody design for applications requiring high-affinity binding. A structure-based study involving a range of ankyrin proteins of known structures, shows that consensus-based ankyrin proteins are very stable since they maximize the energetic gap between the folding and unfolding structures, encoding a densely connected network of favourable interactions among conserved sequence motifs, like the TPLX motif. The same study shows that insertions in the canonical framework of ankyrin repeats are enriched in conflictive interactions, that are related to function. The same applies to interactions surrounding deletion hotspots. These might be related to complex folding/unfolding transitions that are important to the partner recognition and interaction. Ankyrin-repeat proteins present an unusual problem in the study of protein folding, which has largely focused on globular proteins that form well-defined tertiary structure stabilized by long-range, nonlocal residue-residue contacts. Ankyrin repeats, by contrast, contain very few such contacts (that is, they have a low contact order). Most studies have found that ankyrin repeats fold in a two-state folding mechanism, suggesting a high degree of folding cooperativity despite the local inter-residue contacts and the evident need for successful folding with varying numbers of repeats. Some evidence, based on synthesis of truncated versions of natural repeat proteins, and on the examination of phi values, suggests that the C-terminus forms the folding nucleation site.  Clinical significance  Ankyrin-repeat proteins have been associated with a number of human diseases. These proteins include the cell cycle inhibitor p16, which is associated with cancer, and the Notch protein (a key component of cell signalling pathways) which can cause the neurological disorder CADASIL when the repeat domain is disrupted by mutations. A specialized family of ankyrin proteins known as muscle ankyrin repeat proteins (MARPs) are involved with the repair and regeneration of muscle tissue following damage due to injury and stress. A natural variation between glutamine and lysine at position 703 in the 11th ankyrin repeat of ANKK1, known as the TaqI A1 allele, has been credited with encouraging addictive behaviours such as obesity, alcoholism, nicotine dependency and the Eros love style while discouraging juvenile delinquency and neuroticism-anxiety.

The interruption of the Napoleon's French campaign in Egypt and Syria (1798‚Äì1801) allowed Muhammad Ali's seizure of power from Ottoman Hurshid Pasha, and the founding of the Muhammad Ali dynasty.

During the Second World War, it was under the command of the Stavka's strategic reserve. It was nicknamed \\"Stalin's sledgehammer\\" by German soldiers. These guns were used with success against Finnish pillboxes at the Mannerheim Line, heavy German fortifications and in urban combat for destroying protected buildings and bunkers. This weapon was used until the end of the war in the Battle of Berlin where the Red Army would bring these guns up at point blank range to smash German fortifications with their heavy 203mm shells. In the spring of 1944, a KV-1s tank chassis was used to create a self-propelled variant, the S-51. The heavy recoil from the muzzle blast threw the crew off their seats and damaged the transmission, and so it was cancelled. With an elevation angle of up to 60 degrees and 12 propellant loads to choose from, the B-4 virtually met all the expectations it was given, capable of crushing its targets via an optimal projectile trajectory. History The Artillery Committee (known in short as the Artkom), then led by R.A. Durlyakhov, set up an artillery design bureau in November 1920, with Frantz Lender as its leader. This design bureau was entrusted with work on \\"a 203mm howitzer with long range\\" in January 1926, with the Artkom issuing a resolution on December 11, 1926 to \\"entrust the Artkom design bureau with designing a 203mm howitzer of long range within 46 months\\". The Bolshevik plant (now Obukhov State Plant) took over after Lender's death in 1927, with the Artkom design bureau charged with designing universal 122mm corps guns and 203/152 mm cannons as Letter No. 51255/12Ya5 specified. B-4 howitzers depicted in a USSR stamp commemorating the 30th anniversary of the Red Army. The 203mm howitzer was presented in two variants, namely one with and one without the muzzle brake. The two guns were otherwise identical to each other. Preference was eventually given to the brake-free variant with technical drawings by the Artkom design bureau, and a tracked carriage (a common sight on heavy Soviet artillery pieces) from the Bolshevik plant. The first prototype B-4 howitzer was made in the Bolshevik plant in early 1931. Firing tests were made from July to August 1931 with the aim of choosing appropriate shells for use by the B-4. The howitzer was accepted into service as the 203 mm howitzer model 1931 after extensive field and combat tests in 1933. Production Production of the B-4 started simultaneously at two factories, namely the Bolshevik plant and the Barrikady plant (the latter is now Titan-Barrikady), with the latter experiencing serious production difficulties. It was only able to prepare a single howitzer for delivery in 1933, but deliver did not go through at all. It delivered its first two B-4's during the first half of 1934, delivering a further 13 until the end of the year, after which production at the plant paused until 1938. The reason for the pause, aside from the aforementioned difficulties, was a plan-shift of the plant to production of the 122 mm A-19 corps gun. The Bolshevik plant did not fare too well either, producing 104 howitzers from 1932 to 1936 and 42 in 1937, which caused production to shift back to Stalingrad. 75 howitzers were made there in 1938, progressing to 181 next year. The Barrikady plant managed a 165-piece batch in 1940, and a further batch of 300 pieces in 1941. The final three howitzers were made in Stalingrad from remaining reserves. The Novokramatorsky plant joined production in 1938/39, producing 49 howitzers in 1938 with the Bolshevik plant, a further 48 in 1939, 3 in 1940 and 26 in 1941. Of the 326 B-4 howitzers made in 1941, 221 were delivered in the first half of 1941, with serial production ending in October 1941, when the final nine howitzers were delivered. A total of 1011 B-4 howitzers were made from 1932 to 1942. Technical drawings of the B-4 differed from plant to plant, with their own modifications to facilitate serial production. As a result, despite bearing the common designation of B-4, there were virtually two different models of the howitzers in practical service. Drawings were not unified until 1937, when individual parts and assembly designs, then already tested both in production and in trials, had their layouts changed. The only innovation was the tracked carriage, which allowed firing outright from the ground without any kind of special platforms, unlike many similar weapons. Tracks were also used because the Soviets had invested a great deal into tractor factories during the 1920s and 1930s, making the use of tracks an obvious and economical choice of carriage.Bishop, Chris. The encyclopedia of weapons of world War II. Sterling Publishing Company, Inc., 2002, p.131 Attempts to fully unify howitzer production between the Bolshevik and the Barrikady plant‚Äîlet alone the late- joiner Novokramatorsky‚Äîfailed. 36 B-4 howitzers were planned for the 17 howitzer artillery regiments according to the approved August 1939 mobilization plan, alongside 1374 men allocated to each regiment. 13 of these regiments would be allocated two howitzers instead of one. The total need for the howitzers, at 612 units, was not fully covered until June 1941, when 849 B-4's were placed into service in the Red Army. To cover wartime losses, another 571 units were planned for production. Operational history The B-4 participated in the Winter War, with 142 howitzers placed along the front on March 1, 1940, of which four were knocked out. The B-4 was also called the \\"Karelia Sculptor\\" as Finnish pillboxes hit were virtually turned into a bizarre hodge-podge of concrete chunks and iron armatures. 23 B-4's were captured by the German 11th Panzer Division as the town of Dubno was captured at nighttime on June 25, 1941. A total of 75 B-4 howitzers were lost from June 22 to December 1, 1941, and a further 105 howitzers were built from factories to make up for the loss. After the start of the Great Patriotic War, the Howitzer Regiments were evacuated to the far rear for protection, only returning on November 19, 1942 when the strategic initiative was wrestled back into Soviet hands. These howitzers would still be placed in the strategic reserve all the way up to the end of the war. Captured B-4's used by the Wehrmacht were given the designation 20,3 cm H.503(r), of which 8 pieces remained at the Eastern Front by March, 1944, firing a mix of G-620 concrete- buster and German shells. B-4 howitzer crews were not given instructions on direct-firing against visible targets, however Captain Ivan Vedmedenko was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union for his actions of direct-firing against enemies. The prototype SU-14 also mounted a B-4 atop its chassis. Ammunition The B-4 has a separated-charge propellant load, with provisions to use full or 11 types of propellant charges. Propellant weight varied from 3.24 kg all the way up to 15.0-15.5 kg. The B-4 can fire 100 kilogram F-265 (with screwed-in cap) or F-625D high explosive or G-620/G-620T bunker-buster shells weighing 100‚Äì146 kg, as well as a certain 150-kilogram heavy atomic shell with a range of 18 km still in service today. Muzzle velocity varied from 288 to 607 m/s for the high-explosive shells depending on propellant charge weight, whereas bunker-buster shells were made to fire at 607 m/s.

Dedicated to St Augustine, it is part of the benefice of Swinton and Pendlebury along with St Peter's Church in Swinton and All Saints' Church in Wardley. The church is in the Eccles deanery, the archdeaconry of Salford and the diocese of Manchester. The church was granted Grade II* listed status in 1966 but has since been upgraded to Grade I. Called the \\"Miners' Cathedral\\", due to its almost cathedralesque stature, in the heart of a one time coal-mining community, it was also sometimes locally called \\"Gussie's\\". The church is situated on Bolton Road and has a connected primary school. History Manchester banker, Edward Stanley Heywood of Heywood's Bank commissioned G. F. Bodley to design the church in March 1870. Its foundation stone was laid in the following September and it was consecrated in May 1874. Heywood paid for its construction, decoration and furnishings. The church was constructed to the design of Bodley and Thomas Garner between 1871 and 1874. The cost, ¬£3,300 (¬£ in ) was largely borne by Heywood. Bodley designed a bell tower for the south-east side, higher than the main roof, but it was not built. Architecture Exterior The church is built of red brick and has clay tile roof and stone dressings. It was inspired by the Gothic cathedrals in Albi and Toulouse in France. Its nave and chancel occupy ten bays under a continuous roof. The church has a door at the west end, a porch on the south side and vestry on the north. The bays are separated by shallow weathered buttresses that terminate in triangular gablets above the coped parapet which has pierced quatrefoils above the chancel. The nave and chancel are differentiated by their windows. The nave has three-light windows below blank arches while the chancel has four-light windows with reticulated tracery. The east window between angled buttresses topped by crocketted pinnacles has seven lights decorated with flowing reticulated tracery. The west window has five lights. Clifton Hall Colliery disaster memorial. Interior High altar, church interior The church has large internal buttresses that are pierced by passage aisles and which support high-level arches. The barrel roof is richly painted above chancel. An elaborately carved rood screen separates the nave from the chancel and the sanctuary is raised. The reredos is decorated with painted figures. The organ case, rood screen and sedilia were designed by Bodley. The ornate font on a carved stone is raised from the ground by several steps, and above it is a carved wooden hood suspended from the walls. Clergy The first vicar, Doctor Alfred Dewes (b. Coventry 1825; d. Pendlebury 1911), was vicar from the consecration of the church in 1874 until his death in 1911. He worked unceasingly throughout the smallpox and cholera outbreaks, helping the poor and afflicted. Both vicar and church were the focal point for the mourning following the Clifton Hall Colliery explosion on 18 June 1885, in which 178 men and boys were killed.\\"English Heritage inspires Greater Manchester to help historic places of worship\\", Government News Network, retrieved 4 July 2006.

Reception Nicholas Pevsner writing in the Buildings of England described the church as one of the greatest and most moving of all Victorian churches, with an interior of \\"breathtaking majesty and purity\\". The church was the subject of drawings and paintings by artist L.S. Lowry who lived at 117 Station Road, Pendlebury, between 1909 and 1948. Current condition In recent years, several church restoration projects have been completed, including re-pointing southeast side and the addition of toilets and kitchen. The church is in need of at least ¬£1 million for refurbishments to the interior roof and to repair the pointing on the exterior of the church, and is a priority project for English Heritage, who quote it as being \\"exceptionally important\\".\\"The Diocese of Manchester: Handling problems in partnership\\", English Heritage, retrieved 4 July 2006.

He studied under djembe legend Suncaru Jara, and later became the lead djembe player of the National Ballet of Senegal for 18 years. Life and career Abdoulaye Diakite is a member of the Bamana ethnic group from Mali. The Bamana are a tribe of the Malinke (mainly in Mali and Senegal) who resisted modernization and missionary efforts. The word Bamana means \\"we won‚Äôt join\\" referring to their refusal to leave their heritage behind and remain true to their ancient beliefs and practices. Diakite began drumming at the age of seven. Throughout his youth, Diakite was known for his natural ability on the djembe drum. For many years, he studied with his teacher Suncaru Jara in Tambacounda. At age 16, he played at a festival in Tambacounda that would forever change his life. The Ballet National du Senegal was there looking for a djembe player who sounded like the famous djembefola (djembe player) Dugufana Tarawele. There, they discovered Diakite. In 1969, Abdoulaye Diakite officially joined the Ballet National du Senegal. For the next 18 years until 1986, he traveled the world as their lead soloist. Upon the completion of his last world tour, Diakite chose to stay in the United States and make his home away from home in Oakland, California. In the early 1990s, Diakite founded Tambacounda Productions and co-founded the drum and dance company CEEDO, both located in Oakland. Under the Tambacounda Productions label, Diakite has initiated a variety of performances and conferences that educate the public on the music of West Africa. The biggest of these events includes the Tambacounda West African Drum and Dance Camp, which has been held annually in the Bay Area since 1996. The summer camp was the first of its kind and has arguably been an inspiration to the growth and popularity of West African drumming and dancing in the United States.

At this point, the band had collapsed into a trio, without a full-time drummer, but leader Bill Henderson and guitarist/keyboardist/drummer Brian MacLeod had become a powerful songwriting team during the interim. The single release \\"My Girl (Gone, Gone, Gone)\\" became the group's first hit since the 1979 collapse of their former label Mushroom Records, reaching #1 in Canada and giving Chilliwack their U.S. Top 40 breakthrough peaking at #22 on the Billboard Hot 100: \\"My Girl (Gone, Gone, Gone)\\" also gave Chilliwack their only evident chart item outside North America reaching #57 in Australia with a disproportionately long chart run of 28 weeks. The success of \\"My Girl (Gone, Gone, Gone)\\" led to a touring version of Chilliwack re-forming. The album's second single: \\"I Believe\\", released in early 1982, was also a Top 10 Canadian hit and returned Chilliwack to the U.S. Top 40 at #33. In November of 1982, Wanna Be a Star was certified Platinum (in excess of 100,000 copies sold) in Canada. https://musiccanada.com/gold- platinum/?_gp_search=Chilliwack Overall the album is something of a concept album about the \\"rock and roll\\" lifestyle and the pursuit of fame.

The case established that, where goods are displayed in a shop together with a price label, such display is treated as an invitation to treat by the seller, and not an offer. The offer is instead made when the customer presents the item to the cashier together with payment. Acceptance occurs at the point the cashier takes payment. Facts The defendant displayed a flick knife in the window of his shop next to a ticket bearing the words Ejector knife ‚Äì 4s, (i.e. four shillings). Under section 1 of the Restriction of Offensive Weapons Act 1959 (which was expanded in 1961, after this case finished, to deal with the gap in the law): In late 1959, the claimant, a chief inspector of police, brought forward information against the defendant alleging he contravened section 1(1) by offering the flick knife for sale. Judgement Bristol Justices At first instance, the Prosecutor submitted that the Defendant has displayed the knife and ticket in the window with the objective of attracting a buyer, and that this constituted an offer of sale sufficient to create a criminal liability under section 1(1) of the Act. Mr Obby Simakampa submitted that this was not sufficient to constitute an offer. The judges at first instance found that displaying the knife was merely an invitation to treat, not an offer, and thus no liability arose. The Prosecutor appealed the judges' decision. Divisional Court Lord Parker CJ in the Divisional Court held there was no offence because there was no \\"offer for sale\\". Although the display of a knife in a window might at first appear to \\"lay people\\" to be an offer inviting people to buy it, and that it would be \\"nonsense to say that [it] was not offering it for sale\\", whether an item is offered for the purpose of the statute in question must be construed in the context of the general law of the country. He stated that the general law of the country clearly established that merely displaying an item constituted an invitation to treat. He also read the statute on an exclusive construction (inclusio unius est exclusio alterius), noting that other legislation prohibiting the sale of weapons referred to \\"offering or exposing for sale\\" (emphasis added). The lack of the words exposing for sale in the Restriction of Offensive Weapons Act 1959 suggested that only a true offer would be prohibited by the Act. The court dismissed the appeal. Goods displayed in a shop are merely an invitation to treat or invitation to trade. Ashworth J and Elwes J agreed. Significance The 1959 Act was almost immediately amended by the Restriction of Offensive Weapons Act 1961 section 1 to add (to the offence) or exposes or has in his possession for the purpose of sale or hire, which remains the law. Restriction of Offensive Weapons Act 1961 A similar shopkeeper would today be successfully prosecuted. The principles of offer and acceptance in the case remain good law.

Registered as a mutual aid society, the EEE was founded by Asia Minor refugee merchants. According to the organisation's constitution, only Christians could join. Its members were opposed to Thessaloniki's substantial Jewish population. It was led by Georgios Kosmidis (), a banking clerk. The party's leaders were the main defendants in the trial held after the Campbell Riot of 29 June 1931, in which Greek nationalist mobs attacked the Jewish \\"Campbell\\" settlement in the city. (A co-defendant was Nikolaos Nikos Fardis (), editor- in-chief of the Makedonia newspaper.) Estimates put the party's strength at 7,000 members in 1932; by 1933, it had 3,000 members march to Athens, in apparent imitation of Benito Mussolini's 1922 March on Rome. However, it polled miserably in the 1934 city elections in Thessaloniki, and in 1935, the party imploded as a result of in-fighting. It was revived by the German occupation authorities in 1942, during the Axis Occupation of Greece; many members of EEE became prominent collaborators of the Nazis, and many more joined the Security Battalions and helped in the identification of Greek Jews.

It stands on the Omeo Highway and is 415 km from Melbourne (and the same distance from Canberra), and is located on the Mitta Mitta River not far from Dartmouth Dam. At the 2016 census, Mitta Mitta and the surrounding area had a population of 171. The permanent town population is 39. Etymology The name \\"Mitta Mitta\\"Smyth, Robert Brough, The Aborigines of Victoria, 1878, Government Printer derives from the name local Aboriginal people gave to the Mitta Mitta River ‚Äì \\"mida-modunga\\" (where reeds grow, modunga being a particular type of reed). Geography Mitta Mitta is situated at the southernmost end of the Mitta Mitta Valley on the foothills of the Great Dividing Range. At the airport, Mitta Mitta is 250 m (820 ft) above mean sea level. The town is at the confluence of the Mitta Mitta River and Snowy Creek, 18 km from Mount Bogong, the highest mountain in Victoria. Mitta Mitta is on the Omeo Highway, a major transportation connection between Central Victoria and Gippsland. The hamlet of Mitta Mitta Education Mitta Mitta Primary School (no 887) was openedColquohoun,S.A., Mitta Mitta from the Early Pioneer Days, 1972, Mitta Mitta, Victoria on 1 October 1869. It is a small school that has been threatened with closure a number of times. Children rode horses to the school until the 1980s. Secondary children are bussed to Tallangatta, a 140 km daily round trip. Brief history The Mitta Mitta Valley was settled by early pastoralists in 1835 and Mitta Mitta became a settlement when gold was discovered there in 1852.Kelly, Russell J, Mitta Mining, 2007, Wombat Gully Productions, Substantial hydraulic sluicing replaced alluvial mining, the Pioneer Mine being the most successful, yielding over 441 kg of gold until it closed in 1904. This large open-cut mine still forms the backdrop to the town. Aboriginals used the River as a food source, social connections and sometimes wars. Their presence goes back at least 4,000 years and artifacts are frequently found along the River and creeks. The principle tribe in the district was the Jaitmatang (also spelt yaithmathang) with the theddora-mittung occupying the area around the southern end of the Valley near present Mitta Mitta. Their spoken language was Dhudhoroa (now extinct). Economy Mining, cropping and cattle provided income until the Federation Drought. Dairy farming was a major pursuit until around 2000 and since then, beef cattle production has since become the principal activity with the Mitta Valley offering some the finest and productive country in the State. Some niche agri-business enterprises are appearing, namely the production of hazelnuts and mushrooms. The town was seriously compromised during the 2003 bushfires and was shut down in 2020 during the January bushfires and subsequent COVID-19 lockdown. Tourism is becoming more important and provides an opportunity for economic and population growth to offset some of the pressures from a falling permanent population and a decline in local production. Houses within the township are more frequently being acquired as 'weekenders', indicating the desirability of Mitta Mitta as a beautiful and peaceful retreat.

The circuit became a hub for racing in the Caribbean over the next three decades, however had fallen into disrepair by the mid-2000s. Local rally driver Ralph Williams coerced the FIA and Apex Circuit Design into supporting the circuit's redevelopment, a cause that was boosted by the large crowds witnessed at the local touring car event which delegates chose to attend. Reconstruction began in 2013 on what was grandly proposed as the central hub for racing in the Caribbean. The track was refurbished and reopened in 2014 with the inaugural event being the Top Gear Festival featuring the Global RallyCross Championship. Later in the same year it hosted the 2014 Race of Champions. The Global RallyCross Championship returned in 2015 for a double-header event.

He was the beneficial owner of 16% of Koch Industries, which he received as an inheritance from his father, J. Howard Marshall II. He spent the last 15 years of his life as a defendant in lawsuits by his stepmother, Anna Nicole Smith, and his brother, J. Howard Marshall III, who both sought part of his father's fortune after being left out of the will and testament. Early life and education Marshall attended The Webb Schools, Millersburg Military Institute, and then graduated from Culver Military Academy in 1956. He received an undergraduate degree from Pomona College in 1961. Career Marshall began his career at General Motors as an engine test engineer, followed by a brief tour with the United States Navy. After leaving the Navy, Marshall worked for Loeb, Rhoades & Co., an investment bank in New York. In 1969, Marshall moved to Houston, Texas to work with his father. At his brother's wedding in 1974, he and his brother were each given shares representing a 4% stake in Koch Industries by their father, J. Howard Marshall II, who said \\"these are the crown jewels, take care of them.‚Äù In 1980, the 4 sons of Fred C. Koch fought over control of Koch Industries, founded by their father. J. Howard Marshall III sided with Bill Koch and Frederick R. Koch, while Pierce and his father sided with Charles Koch and David Koch resulting in J. Howard Marshall buying back the shares he had previously given J. Howard Marshall III The company purchased the remaining shares of Bill, Frederick and others in 1983. From 1979 to 1981, he was Vice President of Finance of International Oil and Gas Corporation. During 1982, he managed his own investments. In 1983, he joined Weber, Hall, Sale and Associates, a stock brokerage firm in Dallas. In August 1986, he became the president of Electron Corporation, an iron foundry based in Littleton, Colorado. He also served as chairman since 1981, when his father-in-law died. He led Electron through a successful turnaround, saving over 300 jobs in Colorado and Oklahoma. When the health of his father, J. Howard Marshall, began to deteriorate in 1993, he ceased his securities brokerage business, delegated his responsibilities at Electron and assumed operational responsibilities at Marshall Petroleum. His father died in 1995, leaving the family fortune in trusts for the benefit of Pierce and leaving his brother, J. Howard Marshall III, and his father's widow, Anna Nicole Smith, out of the will and testament. Smith and Marshall III sued, and Pierce and his father's estate were defendants in several cases including Marshall v. Marshall and Stern v. Marshall, which both reached the Supreme Court of the United States. In the end, the courts ruled that Marshall III and Smith had no rights to the estate. Although Pierce did not like the spotlight and dealing with lawyers, he refused to settle the cases because he believed he was fighting a crusade to honor the final wishes of his father. Death Marshall died on June 20, 2006 at the age of 67 as a result of septic shock brought on by a combination of Staphylococcus and Streptococcus infections that were resistant to drugs. His shares in Koch Industries then passed to trusts for the benefit of his wife, Elaine Tettemer Marshall, and his children, Preston Marshall and E. Pierce Marshall Jr. Personal life Marshall married Elaine Tettemer Marshall in 1965 and they had 2 sons: Preston Marshall and E. Pierce Marshall Jr. Marshall always said that his shares in Koch Industries were worth less than amounts indicated in published reports since the company had no plans to become a public company and they were therefore illiquid. Marshall was a motorsports enthusiast and competed in the last running of the Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash, better known as the Cannonball Run, in April 1979. Teamed with Sports Car Club of America racers Dave Faust and Kirby Goodman, Marshall drove a Chevrolet Malibu with the 9C1 Police Patrol Package and a 350 cubic inch LT-1 Z-28 Chevrolet Camaro engine, finishing 13th in a field of 47 competitors, completing the run from Darien, Connecticut to Redondo Beach, California in 36 hours, 51 minutes.

Its origins are connected to the decision of William of Champeaux, the Archdeacon of Paris, to retire to a small hermitage near Paris in 1108. He took on the life, vocation and observances of the Canons Regular, and his new community followed the Augustinian Rule. William was famed for his teaching, and was followed to his hermitage by many of his disciples, including Peter Abelard, and was convinced by them to take up his lecturing again. William was made Bishop of Ch√¢lons-sur-Marne in 1113, and was succeeded in his hermitage at St. Victor's by Gilduin, who promoted the canonical order and its new abbey vigorously. Through generous gifts from popes, kings, queens, and nobles, the Abbey of St. Victor was soon richly endowed. Many houses of canons regular came under its influence and were reformed through its leadership, including the Abbey of Ste Genevi√®ve (Paris), Wigmore Abbey in Wales, St. Augustine's (Bristol), St. Catherine's (Waterford), St. Thomas's (Dublin), and San Pietro ad Aram (Naples).For the history of the congregation of St. Victor including brief descriptions of all abbeys, which have been identified as \\"Victorine\\" so far, cf. Bj√∂rn Gebert, Sankt Viktor von Paris und die Viktoriner. Institutionelle Strukturen eines mittelalterlichen Klosterverbandes, in: Anette L√∂ffler/Bj√∂rn Gebert (eds.), Legitur in necrologio victorino. Studien zum Nekrolog der Abtei Saint-Victor zu Paris (Corpus Victorinum, Instrumenta 7), M√ºnster i.W. 2015, 119-171. King Louis VIII mentioned no less than forty abbeys of the Order of St. Victor in his last will and testament, and he left 4,000 pounds to be equally divided among them, and all his jewels for the building of the abbey church in Paris. Before the abbey was 160 years old, several cardinals and at least eight significant abbots had been produced from among its members. Abbey of St. Victor, 1655 The traditions of William of Champeaux were handed on, and the abbey became a center of piety and learning, attracting famous students, scholars and intellectuals including Hugh of St. Victor, Peter Lombard and Thomas Becket. In fact, the school of Saint Victor, with the schools of Ste Genevi√®ve and Notre-Dame de Paris, was the cradle of the University of Paris.  Formation  It was around 1108 that William of Champeaux retired from teaching with a few disciples in a hermitage (or cella) abandoned near a chapel dedicated to St. Victor, at the foot of the Montagne Sainte-Genevi√®ve (the abbey remained outside the walls of the enclosure built by Philip Augustus at the end of the twelfth century). In 1113, when William was elected Bishop of Chalons-sur-Marne, Louis VI transformed the small retreat into an abbey that was richly endowed the following year. The Pope dedicated the foundation. The successor of William was the prior Gilduin, dearest disciple of William and confessor of the king. Born in Paris, he is the abbot of 1113‚Äì1155. It is most probably during his abbacy, that the customs of St. Victor were composed in the Liber Ordinis Sancti Victoris, following a rigorous asceticism, where silence and manual labor prevailed.Edition of the Liber Ordinis: Liber Ordinis Sancti Victoris Parisiensis, ed. Lucas Joqu√©/Ludo Milis (Corpus Christianorum Continuatio Mediaevalis 61), Turnhout 1984. For the date of the customary cf. Rainer Berndt, Scriptura sacra magistra fidei.

The abbey later fell on hard times, being identified in the 17th and early 18th centuries with the Jansenist movement. It was dissolved and destroyed during the French Revolution. The site of the former abbey is now largely occupied by Paris VI and VII Universities and by the Mus√©um and Jardin des Plantes. The name survives in a neighbouring street. Makeup of the Congregation The Victorines are one of the most illustrious of the twelfth-century congregations in terms of cosmopolitan and intellectual pursuits. Thanks to Hugh and his comprehensive teachings, the school took on a universalist dimension that Victorines defended against those who wanted to \\"rip and shred the whole body and who, by a perverse judgment, arbitrarily choose whatever pleases them.\\" Saint-Victor became a popular retreat of Bernard of Clairvaux and Thomas Becket (1118-1170), and the bishops of Paris had an apartment there. The cloister became a public school of theology and liberal arts, a kind of monastery-university attended by the philosopher Abelard and Peter Lombard, author of the famous Sentences (Libri Quattuor Sententiarum). Library The abbey had a rich library open to the public. In the consulting room the manuscripts were chained. But there were other properties: liturgical manuscripts were kept for the choir, some others near the refectory, for reading aloud in the infirmary to the sick and dying, and others consisting of double reserves by the librarian (armarius). Part of the library consisted of a group of books (minores) the canons or students could borrow over long periods (concessi). The teaching of the abbey activity The most important texts emanating from the teaching activity in the abbey are being made available in English translation in the series Victorine Texts in Translation, Turnhout: Brepols Publishers, 2010 -. favoured the development of library funds. Richly endowed, the abbey would be filled by purchases or copies from elsewhere: the scriptorium seems not to have been well developed. Endowments also enriched the collection. In addition, the documents found upon the death of a Victorin (sermons, for example) were compiled and stored in the library. In Gargantua and Pantagruel by Rabelais, there are satirical references to the library of St Victor (Chapter VII.6). Scriptorium The scriptorium of Saint-Victor has certainly been the cause of experience glosses texts of Scripture by formatting columns, \\"formal provision entirely unique\\"; the biblical text in the center, and commentaries on the outside. This seems to be influence of Italian origin as regards their decoration.  Masters of Saint-Victor  The main and iconic masters of this scholarly abbey remain Hugh and Richard of St. Victor. The first being recognized as the true founder of the school, abbot of 1125-1140, the complete scholar, philosopher, mystic and teacher, whose book De sacramentis christianae fidei (1136-1141) is the most important theological synthesis before scholastic Saint Thomas Aquinas. The second, Richard of St. Victor is considered the founder of the medieval mysticism. Philosophies developed by these Victorines were to give a rational support for the mystical, aided by divine grace, enlightenment or innate principles of truth to the soul. One of the goals of all the Victorines was to promote the spiritual life.

After rejecting two distinct sets of tracks which the band had submitted for album release, Mushroom Records had had Chilliwack - til then self-produced - collaborate with producer Marc Gilutin who co- produced a third distinct set of tracks to be issued as Chilliwack's seventh album, with the sessions co-produced by Gilutin introducing as members of Chilliwack guitarist Brian MacLeod who'd remain a member for four Chilliwack albums, and Jamie Bowers (guitar/ keyboards) who would not record again with the group. The tracks co-produced by Gilutin included two songs written by MacLeod and also two \\"outside songs\\" - the first (and it would prove only) non-original material to ever be recorded by Chilliwack since the band had been rebranded from \\"The Collectors\\" - : \\"Arms of Mary\\" and \\"In Love With a Look\\": \\"In Love With a Look\\" was a co-write by Ted Myers who'd fronted Glider a session group whose self-titled 1977 album release had been produced by Gilutin, while the 1975 original Sutherland Brothers version of \\"Arms of Mary\\" had enjoyed widespread international hit status while barely registering in North America. The third intended version of Chilliwack's seventh album was issued in June 1978 under the title Lights from the Valley, a quote from \\"Arms of Mary\\" which track served as lead single: \\"Arms of Mary\\" would fail to become one of Chilliwack's most successful Canadian chart hits with a modest #49 peak, although the track would become the fourth Chilliwack single to rank on the Hot 100 in Billboard with its #67 peak outranking the band's three previous Hot 100 entries. A second single release: \\"Never Be the Same\\", was a low impact Canadian chart item with a peak of #59 and would not register on the Billboard Hot 100: in fact \\"Arms of Mary\\" would remain Chilliwack's last Hot 100 entry until 26 September 1981 when \\"My Girl (Gone, Gone, Gone)\\" debuted at #81: by its third week on the chart - that of 10 October 1981 - \\"My Girl...\\" had bested \\"Arms of Mary\\" as Chilliwack's highest ranking Hot 100 entry, \\"My Girl...\\"'s 10 October 1981 Hot 100 ranking being #60 (the eventual Hot 100 peak of \\"My Girl...\\" would be #22). Impact Intended to build on the qualified success of the precedent Dreams, Dreams, Dreams album, Lights from the Valley would not in fact rise above its predecessor's success level, with Mushroom's financial problems incurred via litigation with the rock band Heart hampering the promotion of Lights from the Valley. In fact the turmoil inherent in the album's convoluted recording history threatened to shut down the band: veteran guitarist Howard Froese was replaced by Brian MacLeod after the first attempt at Chilliwack's seventh album was rejected - although Froese would receive \\"special thanks\\" on the released Lights from the Valley album, citing background vocals and acoustic guitar - , and by the time of the release of Lights from the Valley Glenn Miller (bass) and Ross Turney (drums) - who had worked alongside Chilliwack's lead vocalist/ guitarist Bill Henderson since the Chilliwack forerunner the Collectors - had left the group necessitating the recruitment of new members Skip Layton (drums) and Ab Bryant (bass) to perform with Henderson, Bowers and MacLeod in Chilliwack's live gigs,Ottawa Journal 4 August 4, 1978 p. 47 and only Henderson, MacLeod and Bryant would remain with Chilliwack for the group's eighth album: the 1979 release Breakdown in Paradise. In 2013, all of the Chilliwack albums on Mushroom were rereleased in CD format: the CD release of Lights from the Valley featured as bonus tracks \\"Mary Lou and Me\\" - the B-side to the 1977 single \\"Fly by Night\\" - and also the songwriting demo of \\"The Hardest Things to See\\" an intended track for Chilliwack's seventh album.

In addition, after the last album three of the longstanding band members left the group, leaving only Bill Henderson and Brian MacLeod from the prior lineup.

The show ran in 2006 in New York City at the Daryl Roth Theater. In the performance Bernhard does what she is best known for: she rips apart celebrity culture while commenting on events of the time. Among the topics she addresses: Britney Spears, Laura Bush, Condoleezza Rice, Bob Dylan, Mariah Carey, golf and the war on terror. The album, released in 2006, is a live recording of her one- woman show of the same title; it combines comedic monologues and musical performances. It was released by Breaking Records and was originally sold through the website and in the lobby of the live show. Unlike the majority of her other CD releases, it was a professionally manufactured CD and not a home- made CD-R. In 2007 the label acquired a distribution deal for the album and a re-released version with an alternate track listing was released. It has slightly alternate artwork (only \\"one Sandra\\" appears on the cover instead of 3) and features bonus digital video content. Most of the songs on the CD are covers of other people's songs. They include Christina Aguilera, Missy Elliott, Lita Ford, Vanity 6, Sheila E., Bob Dylan, Pink and Prince.

The original seedling was discovered near a group of assorted ash trees in Sewell's nursery in the Mount Lofty Ranges in South Australia about 1910, and later grown at the nearby property Raywood (former home of the Downer family). The tree was introduced to Britain in 1928 and to North America in 1956, although it did not become widely available there until 1979. The tree grows to around and has dusty green leaves that turn to a dusty red in the autumn. The bark of the tree is notably smoother than the Caucasian Ash, which is quite apparent on those trees grafted on Caucasian Ash stock. In Australia and the United States the death of some older trees have been observed which has been attributed to a combination of environmental stress and the presence of the fungus Botryosphaeria.

The RFM franchise entered the PBA in 1990, as Pop Cola, joining market rival Pepsi. Guiao was the team's first head coach and led the renamed Diet Sarsi to its first finals appearance, losing to Purefoods Tender Juicy Hotdog in the 1991 All-Filipino Finals. In the 1992 Third Conference, he led Swift to their first championship with a 4-0 sweep of 7-Up in the championship. It was also Guiao's first championship in the PBA.

It was a reference to the PBA suspending Kerby Raymundo and Junthy Valenzuela in Games 3 and 4, respectively as the Beermen won both games. Guiao would later repeat the same feat in 2002 Commissioner's Cup, leading Red Bull to a seven-game series victory over Talk 'N Text to defend its championship won a year ago. Red Bull had a two-season title drought, despite several respectable finishes during those seasons. But in the 2005-06 PBA season, he coached the Bulls to the 2005-06 Fiesta Conference Championship, defeating Purefoods in six games and a runner-up finish in the 2006 Philippine Cup, losing to the same Purefoods team, 4-2. In the 2006-07 Philippine Cup, Guiao led the Bulls to its ninth semifinals appearance in franchise history but lost to San Miguel in seven games.

After a forgetful Commissioner's Cup, the Elasto Painters bounced back in the Governors' Cup and topped the elimination round. The team went on to face San Mig Coffee Mixers (then known as the B-Meg Llamados), with Paul Lee out of the series Yeng and the Elasto Painter found ways to beat the Llamados, the Elasto Painters went up 3-1 before the Llamados won 2 straight games to force Game 7.

Guiao had plans to have Pampanga host several sports for the 2005 Southeast Asian Games but was later scrapped. In 2004, he won the Vice Governor position of the province in the local elections which he currently serves. Guiao, the son of former Pampanga Governor Bren Z. Guiao, had been critical about the leadership of former Pampanga Governor Mark Lapid, who was his former ally, so he switched sides and aligned himself to Lilia Pineda, wife of the alleged gambling lord Bong Pineda. In 2005, he asked Philippine President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to investigate Gov. Lapid and his father Senator Lito Lapid of plunder charges. He ran for re-election as Vice Governor and won as a running mate of Senior Provincial Board Member Baby Pineda, the wife of alleged-Jueteng lord Bong Pineda, under the KAMPI banner (KAMPI is the mother party of Arroyo). He ran for congressman of the First District of Pampanga in 2013.First district folk want new leaders - GuiaoLocal party bares Angeles City bets He won his position against former Rep. Francis Nepomuceno. He ran again for his second term in the 2016 elections against Jon Lazatin, son of former Angeles mayor and 1st district congressman Carmelo Lazatin. However, Guiao lost his re- election bid in the May 9 elections, after he only got 44,672 votes over his opponent Jon Lazatin, with 78,197 of the total counted votes.

Rainwater tanks are devices for collecting and maintaining harvested rain. A rainwater catchment or collection (also known as \\"rainwater harvesting\\") system can yield of water from of rain on a roof. Rainwater tanks are installed to make use of rain water for later use, reduce mains water use for economic or environmental reasons, and aid self-sufficiency. Stored water may be used for watering gardens, agriculture, flushing toilets, in washing machines, washing cars, and also for drinking, especially when other water supplies are unavailable, expensive, or of poor quality, and when adequate care is taken that the water is not contaminated and is adequately filtered. Underground rainwater tanks can also be used for retention of stormwater for release at a later time and offer a variety of benefits described in more detail below. In arid climates, rain barrels are often used to store water during the rainy season for use during dryer periods. Rainwater tanks may have a high (perceived) initial cost. However, many homes use small scale rain barrels to harvest minute quantities of water for landscaping/gardening applications rather than as a potable water surrogate. These small rain barrels, often recycled from food storage and transport barrels or, in some cases, whiskey and wine aging barrels, are often inexpensive. There are also many low cost designs that use locally available materials and village level technologies for applications in developing countries where there are limited alternatives for potable drinking water.Camilli, Luis (2000), Rainwater Harvesting: constructing a cistern and gutter system using village technologies and materials, Maji Safi Rainwater Harvesting Manual While most are properly engineered to screen out mosquitoes, the lack of proper filtering or closed loop systems may create breeding grounds for larvae. With tanks used for drinking water, the user runs a health risk if maintenance is not carried out.  Contamination and maintenance  If rainwater is used for drinking, it is often filtered first. Filtration (such as reverse osmosis, ultraviolet sterilization, or ultrafiltration) may remove pathogens. While rain water is pure it may become contaminated during collection or by collection of particulate matter in the air as it falls. While rain water does not contain chlorine, contamination from airborne pollutants, which settles onto rooftops, may be a risk in urban or industrial areas. Many water suppliers and health authorities, such as the New South Wales Department of Health, do not advise using rainwater for drinking when there is an alternative mains water supply available. However, reports of illness associated with rainwater tanks are relatively infrequent, and public health studies in South Australia (the Australian state with the highest rainwater usage rate) have not identified a correlation. Rainwater is generally considered fit to drink if it smells, tastes and looks fine; However some pathogens, chemical contamination and sub- micrometre suspended metal may produce neither smell nor taste and may not be visible. Australian standards may differ greatly from other places in the world where rainwater is commonly used for drinking water. In the United States, rainwater is being increasingly used throughout the country for various purposes. In the semi-arid western state of New Mexico, for instance, many residents in the Taos and Santa Fe areas in particular use rainwater either for landscaping purposes or even all household uses (including potable indoor water). The \\"smells, tastes, and looks fine\\" standard used in the above paragraph is not an absolute indicator of rainwater safety. Most people who are rainwater users for potable purposes in the USA make certain that their water is safe through filtration, ultraviolet sterilization, and testing. Certain paints and roofing materials may cause contamination. In particular, a Melbourne Water publication advises that lead-based paints never be used. Tar- based coatings are also not recommended, as they affect the taste of the water. Zinc can also be a source of contamination in some paints, as well as galvanized iron \\"Aluminium and cadmium can be an impurity in zinc galvanised iron roofs (Gromaire et al., 2001, Van Metre and Mahler, 2003) and therefore found in collected tank rainwater. Indeed, in Study 2, the tank with high concentration of Cd collected water from a galvanised iron roof.\\" or zincalume roofs, particularly when new, should not collect water for potable use. Roofs painted with acrylic paints may have detergents and other chemicals dissolve in the runoff. Runoff from fibrous cement roofs should be discarded for an entire winter, due to leaching of lime. Chemically treated timbers and lead flashing should not be used in roof catchments. Likewise, rainwater should not be collected from parts of the roof incorporating flues from wood burners without a high degree of filtration. Overflows or discharge pipes from roof- mounted appliances such as air-conditioners or hot-water systems should not have their discharge feed into a rainwater tank. \\"Copper Poisoning\\", a 2010 news article, linked copper poisoning to plastic tanks. The article indicated that rainwater was collected and stored in plastic tanks and that the tank did nothing to mitigate the low pH. The water was then brought into homes by copper piping. The copper was released by the high acid rainwater and caused poisoning in humans. It is important to note that, while the plastic tank is an inert container, the collected acid rain could and should be analysed and pH adjusted before being brought into a domestic water supply system. The solution is to monitor stored rainwater with swimming pool strips, cheap and available at swimming pool supply outlets. If the water is too acidic, the state, county or local health officials may be contacted to obtain advice, precise solutions and pH limits, and guidelines as to what should be used to treat rainwater to be used as domestic drinking water. Maintenance includes checking roofs and rain gutters for vegetation and debris, maintaining screens around the tank, and occasionally desludging (removing sediment by draining and cleaning the tank of algae and other contaminants). Rainwater tanks which are not properly sealed (secured at the top) may act as breeding grounds for mosquitoes.The Sunday Age. November 25, 2007. \\"These flies! Will mozzies be next?\\". Stephen Cauchi quoting Luke Simpkin, Museum Victoria. Several options for dealing with the mosquito issue are: 1\\\\. Flushing ALL water once a week 2\\\\. Using a small amount of cooking oil to suffocate the larvae (the water is still ok for landscape use after this) 3\\\\. Adding the bacillus Bt to the water. This bacteria will not harm animals. 4\\\\. Adding mosquito eating fish Another way to store rainwater without worry of contamination by mosquitoes is to use underground storage tanks. Underground tanks keep the water too cool () for mosquito larvae and also are dark, preventing both mosquito, bacterial, and algae growth. An article by Richard Hill goes into depth about the benefits of underground rainwater storage.http://www.whitewaterlimited.com/BacterialActivityinHarvestedRainWater.pdf  Tanks  Example of caged IBC totes being used for rainwater harvesting Rainwater tanks may be constructed from materials such as plastic (polyethylene), concrete, galvanized steel, as well as fiberglass and stainless steel which are rust and chemical-resistant. Full tanks are usually installed above ground, and are usually opaque to prevent the exposure of stored water to sunlight, to decrease algal bloom. Tanks may be covered and have screen inlets to exclude insects, debris, animals and bird droppings. Almost all steel tanks currently produced for household rainwater collection come with a plastic inner lining to increase the life of the tank, prevent leaks and protect the water quality. Apart from rooftops, tanks may also be set up to collect rainwater from concrete patios, driveways and other impervious surfaces. Initial sizes typically ranged in capacity from around , today modern technology has allowed modular and scalable applications to go into sizes of millions of litres or hundreds of thousands of US gallons. Smaller tanks, such as the plastic (-barrel) are also used in some cases. Larger tanks are commonly used where there is no access to a centralised water supply. Companies recommend a tank for a house supporting two people (if compost toilets are placed) and if the region receives at least of precipitation a year. If it receives less (between , 2 or 3 of these 300-gallon tanks can be placed so that more rain can be gathered at times when it does rain. Also affecting tank size is predicted rainfall and rainfall variability; the higher prices for larger tanks; intended use of rainwater and typical consumption for these uses; the area of roof draining into the tank; security of supply desired. Large polyethylene rainwater tanks being installed. Most rainwater catchment tanks used throughout the world are composed of virgin polyethylene, a substance which in the USA is both FDA and NSF approved for potable water storage. Other types of tanks used for rainwater storage include fiberglass, galvanized metal, stainless steel, and concrete. Each type of tank has positive and negative aspects. Polyethylene tanks, when placed above ground, can be subject to algae growth as well as the possibility of a short life (@20 years) due to normal UV exposure in sunlight. The very strong fiberglass tanks must undergo a specific coating process to be brought up to potable grade. Galvanized tanks must either be lined or coated both for potability as well as to prevent the inevitable rusting at any welded seams. Uncoated galvanized tanks will leach zinc into the stored water and are not recommended in most instances - certainly not for water stored for human consumption. Concrete tanks leach a more benign substance - lime - into stored water and many are used around the world for rainwater storage. One method of harvesting rain water has been is modular, scalable systems which are installable underground. These came as an evolution of a geosynthetic applications called Infiltration Tanks, which when stacked provide a void space volume which allows for the storing of water. Improved and more cost effective industrial design now allow for theoretically limitless storage of water underground. Water supply augmentation In Australia, the brand TransTank International manufactures portable water tanks from specially formulated polyethylene for transport and static applications. In some cities, installation of rainwater tanks may be mandatory, or may help a new building be approved. For example, in Victoria, Australia new houses which have rainwater tank connected to all flush toilets are given an additional 1-star of the required 5-star House Energy Rating. Some governments subsidise purchases of rainwater tanks or provide rebates in areas where they are considered an important means of water supply augmentation. In the United States, Santa Fe County, New Mexico requires a rainwater collection system on all new construction with greater than 2,500 square feet, mostly for landscaping purposes and to prevent over-reliance on wells but in some instances because ground water is prohibitively expensive to obtain, if even available. Rainwater to supplement drinking water supplies may be seen as an alternative to other water supply options such as recycling or seawater desalination. Tanks are often perceived to have environmental costs that are comparatively lower than other water supply augmentation options. Rainwater collection can be made compatible with centralised water supply by tapping it using an electropump. Widespread use of rain barrels also changes the amount of rainwater reaching the ground in a particular area and draining into streams. Depending on the climate, this either helps prevent erosion, sedimentation, and/or pollution, and can reduce the strain on stormwater drainage systems; or it could cause rivers to dry up and ponds to stagnate if the water is diverted to a different watershed. If collected water is used in the same watershed in which it is collected, rainwater collection actually can stabilize flow in rivers and provide more regular and filtered groundwater transfer into ponds. Colorado law In the State of Colorado, United States, the installation of rainwater collection barrels is subject to the Constitution of the State of Colorado, state statutes and case law. This is a consequence of the system of water rights in the state; the movement and holding of rainwater is inextricably linked with ownership of water rights and is enshrined in the constitution of the State of Colorado. The use of water in Colorado and other western states is governed by what is known as the prior appropriation doctrine. This system of water allocation controls who uses how much water, the types of uses allowed, and when those waters can be used. This is often referred to as the priority system or \\"first in time, first in right.\\" Since all water arriving in Colorado has been allocated to \\"senior water right holders\\" since the 1850s, rainwater prevented from running downstream may not be available to its rightful owner. In 2009, legislation in Colorado was enacted that permits capture of rain water for residential use subject to strong limitations and conditions. To be permitted, a residence may not be connected to a domestic water supply system serving more than 3 single- family dwellings. The permit must be purchased from the State Engineer's office and is subject to water usage restrictions. Internal rainwater tank Rainwater tanks or drums may be used inside a house to provide thermal mass for a trombe wall (or water wall). Rainwater Hog modular tanks invented by Sally Dominguez to fit within building structure were used in the Modabode House of the Future floor and on the foyer wall of the Department of Sustainability building in Anglesea, Victoria, harnessing the higher value of the stored rainwater to add effective thermal mass to the enclosed spaces. Specially designed rainwater tanks can also be embedded in or under the concrete slab of a building (stab tank). A house in Cape Schanck Victoria, Australia uses an internal rainwater tank to provide cooling to the living room in summer. During winter the tank is drained and wrapped in an insulating jacket. The tank also provides structural support to the roof, and excess water is used for domestic use including drinking.

Upon completion, it will be the second longest railway tunnel in the world, surpassing the Seikan tunnel by over a kilometre. It will run from near Innsbruck, in Austria, to Fortezza, in Italy, replacing part of the current Brenner railway. The line is part of Line 1, the Berlin to Palermo route, of Trans-European Transport Networks (TEN-T). The Brenner Pass, in the Alps at the border between Austria and Italy, is one of the most important traffic connections between northern and southern Europe, and the motorway going over it is infamous for its frequent traffic jams. Pollution from this traffic is a major concern. The goal is to relieve this situation by greatly improving the railway connection between North Tyrol and South Tyrol with the new tunnel, which will allow trains to cross the Alps much faster. Currently, speeds in the Brenner region barely exceed due to the steepness of the existing tracks, which cross the pass at an elevation of above sea level. The travel time from Innsbruck to Bolzano will be reduced from 2 hours to 50 minutes. The project is funded by Austria and Italy, and a contribution by the European Union. Together with a large part of the existing Innsbruck bypass, the Brenner Base Tunnel will reach a length of 64 km. That would be the longest underground railway connection in the world. The funding promised so far will not suffice for the estimated costs. The tunnel is scheduled to be completed in 2028. Background The passenger and freight traffic across the Alps has increased greatly in recent years and further growth is forecast. Austria is a key country in movement of freight between northern and southern Europe and between eastern and western Europe. The Brenner region is very politically sensitive with respect to both local and cross-border transport issues. Between 1970 and 1999, highway freight increased seven-fold. (3 million to 22 million tonnes) In 1990, 70% of the freight from eastern Europe was transported by rail and the remainder by trucks. These proportions were expected to reverse by 2010. About three-quarters of traffic through the Brenner Pass is currently carried by road transport. Local residents have long fought for relief from the associated pollution. The construction of a rail tunnel is considered by its proponents to be necessary for a shift of freight traffic from road to rail. The railway line from Innsbruck to Bozen was built between 1860 and 1867. Tight curve radii and gradients of up to 2.6% complicate rail operations. However, improvements on the Italian side in recent years to the existing line, which were completed in late 2008, allow the line theoretically to accommodate 240 trains per day. The grades were not significantly improved. The new Brenner line would have a maximum gradient of 0.4%-0.7%. Thus, a locomotive would be capable of hauling more than double the weight. The new line (the base tunnel together with the southern approach from Waidbruck/Ponte Gardena to Franzensfeste/Fortezza) would cut travel time between Innsbruck and Bolzano from about two hours today to less than half that. Project Main tunnel Start of the Tunnel boring machine at Aicha/Aica construction site in April 2008 View of Mauls/Mules construction site in summer of 2008 The long, twin-tube tunnel begins in the Innsbruck suburb of Wilten and penetrates the Alps reaching a height of about above sea level (ASL). The tunnel will be up to below the surface at its deepest point in the gneiss section stretching south from the Italian border. Since under the most recent plan the tunnel starts as a twin-tube tunnel, the junction already prepared in the Inntal tunnel on the Innsbruck bypass will not be used. Instead, a diversion with several branches is planned. The volume of rock to be excavated during the construction of the tunnel is estimated at , of which approximately 60% will be incurred in Austria, as about 60% of the tunnel will be in Austria. A part of the spoil will be used as fill for the approach lines and another part of the spoil material is used to produce the concrete segment for the final lining of the tunnel. The main tunnels will have a circular cross section with a diameter of approx. According to current planning the apex of the tunnel will be at the border at an altitude of about ASL, although an apex farther south would have been lower. The placing of the apex at the border is set out in the treaty between Austria and Italy. As justification for this choice it is stated that this will allow Austrian water to run in the tunnel to Austria and Italian water to Italy. Northern approach Sill river seen from Bergisel in April 2011 On its north end, the base tunnel (BBT) has two entrances, which must go underground a few kilometres before the junction with the main tunnels, and will also be built as part of the BBT. One route leads from the main Innsbruck station under Bergisel and the other connects with the Innsbruck bypass. This route adds about more to the length of the tunnel than the Innsbruck station route; with it included, the BBT, at , would become the longest continuous railroad tunnel in the world. However, if the Axentunnel extension is added to the Gotthard Base Tunnel, its length would become , allowing it to reclaim the 'longest tunnel' title. The northern approach from Munich within Germany is the Grafing‚ÄìRosenheim‚ÄìKufstein route. The \\"Brenner Nordzulauf\\" (Brenner northern link) project aims to construct a high-speed line for speeds of up to 230 km/h (143 mph) between Grafing and Brannenburg in addition to the existing line, adapting the route's capacity to the projected increase as a result of the BBT. The project has reached in-depth planning stages but suffers from lacking support by locals. A more direct route between Munich and Innsbruck, for example, via Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Mittenwald and Seefeld was not pursued, though it could have shortened the Munich Innsbruck line to . Concrete shell for the New Lower Inn Valley railway during completion in 2007 In Austria, a new double-track high-speed line supplements the Lower Inn Valley railway between W√∂rgl and Baumkirchen. It manages to cut travel time between Munich and Innsbruck from 1:50 via the old tracks to merely 0:55 using the high-speed line. About of the line through the Lower Inn Valley (Unterinntal) is built underground, in troughs, or under snow sheds. Noise and vibration mitigation is accomplished by the use of of elastomer in a mass-spring system. The segment's track superstructure is load class E5. It is capable of handling 260-300 trains per day. This section was opened 2012-12-09. Planning is under way on the continuation of this line to the German border at Brannenburg. The southern approach for the BBT will be long and reach from the southern portal of the tunnel in Franzensfeste/Fortezza to Verona. Planning has been completed for some sections. History  The Brenner tunnel is the most important link in the Berlin‚ÄìPalermo railway axis, a series of projects that will create a single railway line from Berlin in Germany to Palermo in Sicily. Schedule history Early in the preliminary planning, at a Brussels meeting in June 2005, BBT SE (Brenner Base Tunnel Societas Europae), presented an interim status report. Expectations following the meeting were that the project could be finalized and the pilot tunnel started by 2006. The target for the tunnel to start service was 2015. In 2007 a construction time line with a 2022 finish date was specified in a memorandum signed by the Austrian and Italian ministers of transport. Funding history On December 2008 Antonio Tajani, the European commissioner for transport, approved funds totalling ‚Ç¨1.7 billion to finance 11 railway projects that together should establish two major routes across the continent. In May 2009 it was confirmed that final go-ahead for the project had been given. The final estimated cost was put at ‚Ç¨8.384bn at 2018 levels. Construction history In the summer of 2007 work started on a pilot tunnel to run along the line of the future tunnel and to be used for removing water and spoil during the major construction phase. Construction of the pilot tunnel between 2006 and 2009 was estimated to cost ‚Ç¨430 million and would be 50% EU funded. On July 6, 2019, two Austrian segments were connected, and an unbroken 36km long tunnel was formed ‚Äì around 65% of the tunnel‚Äôs 55km projected length.https://www.railjournal.com/infrastructure/contractors- celebrate-brenner-exploratory-tunnel-breakthrough/ Design The final design will consist of two tunnels, long. A centre tunnel below the two primary tunnels will be used during construction as a guide tunnel to determine geological conditions, and later for drainage and emergency access. There will be a cross over between the tunnels every . Multi-function stations will be located at Trens (in Freienfeld), St. Jodok, and a third station towards the northern end of the tunnel to provide operational and emergency services. ETCS Level 2 will be installed to provide train control. Funding As the transalpine stretch of the SCAN-MED Corridor, the Brenner Base Tunnel receives substantial funding from the European Union. Between 2015 and 2020, 50 % of the costs for the exploratory tunnel (about 303 million Euro) and 40 % of the costs for the two main tunnels (just under 880 million Euro) were covered by the EU. Austria and Italy will each cover half of the remaining costs (about 60%). The 2017 estimate of the basic costs for the Brenner Base Tunnel was 7.8 billion Euro. Considering the planned end date for the project (2028), the estimate total costs, with risk provision and adjustment for inflation are about 8.384 billion Euro [2]. They can be divided into 4 large categories: 60% of the cost comes from the engineering works, 15% is for outfitting, 10% is for planning, services and internal costs, 1% for parcels of land and related issues and 14% for risk provision.

He died by suicide in July 1991. Early life and flower paintings Bryan John Charnley was born on 20 September 1949 in Stockton-on-Tees. With his twin brother he grew up in London, Chislehurst in Kent, Cranfield, where his father worked as a Senior Lecturer, and finally in Bromham near Bedford. In the summer of 1968, aged 18, he suffered a nervous breakdown but was able to study at Leicester School of Art later that year. In 1969, Charnley gained a place at the Central School of Art and Design in Holborn, London but was unable to complete the course due to another breakdown that was later diagnosed as acute schizophrenia. From 1971 until 1977 he lived at home with his parents between periods of hospitalisation and treatment including ECT. In 1978 he moved to Bedford and began painting. Charnley's work during this period drew heavily on photo-realism, then enjoying popularity in America, rather than the conceptual art that was fashionable in the London art scene, and he produced many large- scale paintings of flowers.Kirsten Tambling, Bryan Charnley: the Art of Schizophrenia (Beckenham: Bethlem Museum of the Mind, exh. cat. 2015), p. 9 However, Charnley was also interested in the work of fellow British artist Bridget Riley, in whose work he saw a 'cool discipline' combined with a strong emotional charge.Kirsten Tambling, Bryan Charnley: the Art of Schizophrenia (Beckenham: Bethlem Museum of the Mind, exh. cat., 2015), pp. 24‚Äì26. Relationship with Pam Jones In 1982, Charnley painted a double portrait of himself and his partner Pam, in what has been called 'the high point of Charnley's photo-realistic early period'.Kirsten Tambling, Bryan Charnley: the Art of Schizophrenia (Beckenham: Bethlem Museum of the Mind, exh. cat. 2015), p. 12) The composition and treatment demonstrates Charnley's interest in the work of David Hockney.Kirsten Tambling, 'Bryan Charnley: the Art of Schizophrenia' (Beckenham: Bethlem Museum of the Mind, exh. cat. 2015), p. 12 Five years later, Pam, who also experienced mental illness, attempted suicide by jumping out of a window. Though she survived, her spine was badly damaged. Charnley's trauma is explored in his painting of the same year, 'Leaving by the Window'.Kirsten Tambling, Bryan Charnley: the Art of Schizophrenia (Beckenham: Bethlem Museum of the Mind, exh. cat. 2015), p.15> Stylistic Development Charnley had been exploring his inner life through painting since at least 1982, particularly addressing the experience of schizophrenia. Writing in 1988, Charnley said he had 'found [himself] on an interior journey in which landscape and subject were subsumed to inner vision'.Artist's Statement, 1988, reproduced at https://www.bryancharnley.info/statement/ However, from 1987 onwards, he increasingly drew on Sigmund Freud's theories about dreams, using elaborate symbolism to convey his mental state.Notes provided by James Charnley to the National Portrait Gallery, London, January 1992, held in the Heinz Archive. In 1984 four of his paintings were purchased by the Bethlem Royal Hospital for their permanent collection. During this period, Charnley also studied the work of other artists held in the Bethlem collection, notably William Kurelek and Louis Wain, whose work 'seemed to me to have a power to move far beyond that expected of the patient as an artist. Here I saw art stripped of all esoteric and conceptual pretensions'.Artist's Statement, 1988, reproduced at https://www.bryancharnley.info/statement/ Charnley's elaborately symbolist work from this period includes 'To The Farm' (1987), 'Grey Self-Portrait' (1986), and 'Brooch Schizophrene' (1987), paintings that have also since been acquired by Bethlem Museum of the Mind.'Bryan Charnley' at ArtUK, https://artuk.org/discover/artists/charnley- bryan-19491991 Charnley had a solo exhibition at the Dryden Street Gallery, Covent Garden in London 1989, and exhibited two paintings at the Visions exhibition at the Royal College of Art in 1990, curated by Aiden Shingler.http://www.stardisc.org/creator.html However, he still struggled to make a living from his art. Final work and death Charnley was frustrated by his apparent lack of success in the art market, and what recognition he received was outweighed by the day to day problems of his illness and the heavy medication he was prescribed to counter it. These factors contributed to his decision early in 1991 to paint a series of self portraits chronicling his experience as he reduced his medication. The journalist and CEO of SANE, Marjorie Wallace, encouraged Charnley to keep a diary of his progress.Marjorie Wallace, 'Bryan Charnley', Telegraph Magazine, 7 December 1991 Charnley made the diary an integral part of the portraits using the text to explain the imagery he was using and to describe his existential state.https://www.bryancharnley.info/self- portraits-2/charnley_self_portrait_series_01/ The Self Portrait Series consists of seventeen paintings with the last one left incomplete before his suicide. Marjorie Wallace's article on Charnley's Self Portraits was published in the Telegraph Magazine in December 1991. He may have been partially influenced by Louis Wain's 'Kaleidoscope Cats', held in the collection of Bethlem Museum of the Mind, are (incorrectly) thought to chart the progress of Wain's mental disorder.'Two Men and Eight Cats', lecture by Dr David O'Flynn, available on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTwbTgX_imE In July 1991, he took his own life, leaving the final portrait unfinished.Robert Howard (October 2001).

It chronicles the battles of Spider Jerusalem, infamous renegade gonzo journalist of the future. Jerusalem dedicates himself to fighting the corruption and abuse of power of two successive United States presidents; he and his assistants strive to keep their world from turning more dystopian than it already is. Protagonists *Spider Jerusalem, main character of the series, gonzo journalist extraordinaire. Inspired by Hunter S. Thompson, and the spiritual cousin to Doonesbury's \\"Uncle Duke.\\" His early, unshaved appearance is a direct reference to Robertson's friend Andre Ricciardi, and not Alan Moore as often suggested. The Filthy Assistants Channon Yarrow *Channon Yarrow, Spider's first assistant in the series. She was formerly a stripper, pay-dacoit, and bodyguard. Physically, Channon is quite tall (we are never told how tall, but she is portrayed as a half a head taller than Spider Jerusalem and a full head taller than Yelena Rossini). Per Spider's orders, Channon ingests medication to give her a genetic trait protecting her from cancer, and takes up chain smoking. Channon begins the series as one of the strippers at a strip club in the Angels 8 district of the city, which is invaded by Spider Jerusalem during the Transient Riots. Inspired when Spider quells the riots by broadcasting a live bulletin about it directly to the rest of the City via a local feedsite, Channon (who turns out to be a journalism student stripping to pay for school) quits the club and is hired by The Word editor Mitchell Royce to be Spider's assistant, a job originally consisting primarily of making sure her boss is supplied with enough brain-enhancing drugs and alcohol to be an effective journalist. Channon leaves Spider's employ briefly, following her boyfriend Ziang's choice to dump her and have his consciousness downloaded into a cloud of floating nanotechnological computers, an experience Spider made her chronicle in his weekly column because he felt that everyone should witness it at least once. During her time away, she became a \\"Bride of Christ\\" - Fred Christ, the self-appointed leader of the Transient Movement and half-alien 'love messiah' founder of the Church of Transience. She rejoined Spider and his new assistant, Yelena, early in their fight to prevent the election of President Gary Callahan, aka \\"The Smiler\\", taking on the role of bodyguard. In this new role, Channon is depicted as physically more powerful and imposing than before, regularly fighting off multiple assailants and taking point when strategy is required. Much of the situations she helps fight off comes from the Smiler himself, who has it out for Spider and his assistants. She also demonstrates expertise with a number of small arms, due to her being regularly searched for them at school... to make sure that she was armed. At the end of the series' run, Channon and Yelena are shown to have retired to the Mountain to care for Spider. The two look after him as live-in assistants. Whilst both are now journalists in their own right, Channon refuses to do weekly journalism after her experiences with Spider focusing instead on books (at the end of the series she has a three-book contract). Yelena Rossini *Yelena Rossini, Spider's second assistant in the series. Daughter of rich philanthropist and political figure, Oscar Rossini. Physically, Yelena is quite short (we are never told how tall, but she is portrayed as a half a head shorter than Spider Jerusalem and a full head shorter than Channon Yarrow), with shoulder-length brunette hair and is usually seen in baggy black t-shirts and suits (primarily to obscure her short stature and modest bust‚Äîparticularly when compared to Channon). Per Spider's orders, as with Channon, she ingested medication to give her a genetic trait protecting her from cancer, and took up chain smoking. After Channon leaves Spider's employ to become a nun, Mitchell Royce, Spider's editor, assigns her to be Spider's assistant, a job consisting primarily of making sure her boss is supplied with enough drugs and alcohol to be an effective journalist. Initially, he claims Yelena is his niece, though she later reveals it was simply a ploy to make sure Spider behaves himself around her. She later refers to him as \\"Uncle Mitch\\", however. Of note is that Yelena has quite a different history from that of Channon. About a week after she's hired, she is interviewed by a major broadcaster, and she describes herself as 24 years of age, born and raised in what is presumed to be a high- class section of the City (Old Heath Road), fluent in seven languages, and a recent business school graduate. One major arc in the story was the relationship between Spider and Yelena. Initially, both were frequently at odds with each other, yet stuck together through a combination of pity and camaraderie. Then, after getting drunk one night, the two ended up sleeping together. In the morning Spider, realizing to his horror what must have happened, tried (unsuccessfully) to escape his bed. Upon realizing she slept in the same bed as Spider, Yelena enters a stage of aggressive denial, insisting nothing happened between them. However, Spider's distinctive \\"live shades\\", mistaking the sex for a criminal assault, had automatically taken pictures. Channon rejoins Spider and Yelena early in their fight to prevent the election of President Gary Callahan, aka \\"The Smiler\\", taking on the role of bodyguard. Whilst Yelena was still officially Spider's assistant, he would refer to them both as 'filthy assistants' throughout the rest of the series. Channon and Yelena become friends, often sneaking away from Spider to have fun. It wasn't until the night the Smiler won the Presidential election, during the election coverage party at their apartment, and after an argument with Channon, that Yelena finally admitted to herself and everyone else in earshot that not only had she had sex with Spider, but also that she wasn't Royce's niece. Channon had known for a couple of weeks, after emptying the pictures from Spider's live shades and seeing the contents of them (at the time, Yelena had not known that Spider's shades had photographic capabilities). She has teased Yelena about their relationship ever since. Since her admittance of her one night stand with Spider, Yelena, in part because of her role as assistant, has started to exhibit behaviour similar to Spider, such as his consumption of booze and cigarettes and his colourful vocabulary (Channon to Yelena: \\"You're turning into him.\\"). It's revealed that Yelena has a tattoo identical to the one on Spider's head near her left buttock. Also, on the rare occasions when Spider seems to be truly sorrowful, she instinctively reaches out to comfort him, although she nearly always either stops short or he shrugs it away. However, after Yelena revealed she'd written a crucial column under his name while he was incapacitated for four days, Spider responded, to her surprise, by kissing her on the forehead, followed by the words \\"Thank you\\", and a warm smile. At the end of the series' run, Channon and Yelena are shown to have retired to the Mountain to care for Spider, now seemingly disabled from a rare affliction and unable to care for himself. The two look after him as live-in assistants, much like Hunter S. Thompson's assistants Deborah Fuller and his last wife Anita Bejmuk. It's briefly hinted by Channon that more goes on between Yelena and Spider than Helena admits. Yelena appeared to be in the early stage of pregnancy (ostensibly by Spider), but nobody explicitly talked about it. In the same sequence, Yelena is also shown to have a spider tattoo on her arm (with the Venus symbol for a body) and is referred to as \\"the new Spider\\". She is last seen returning to the City with Spider's old editor to write weekly columns. Allies *Mitchell Royce is the city editor of The Word, a major newspaper in the City, and thus is Spider Jerusalem's boss. He also hires Channon Yarrow and Yelena Rossini to act as Spider's long-suffering assistants. Spider and Royce's antagonistic but fruitful writer-editor relationship goes back many years; at the time of the War of Verbals (a heated exchange between two powerful English-speaking nations (presumably the United States and Britain) and France over keeping French as the national language of the latter). Royce was only an assistant editor and Spider was not yet at the peak of his notoriety. However, after Spider became involved in political journalism and released a reportage book called Shot in the Face, his popularity reached its peak. Unfortunately, all of his creativity dried up afterwards. Unable to write or function in the City and adored by the very people his writing decried, he retreated into the Mountain to escape the pressure to perform. After five years, however, when he receives a phone-call from the \\"whore- hopping editor\\" of his books, and strapped for cash, Spider returns to the City before contacting his old editor, Royce, in the hope of a steady contract job and the luxuries this would entail until he could sort out the book deal. However, as Spider stumbled from one high profile scoop to the next, he found himself being treated to better and better accommodations as his notoriety returned. One of the main themes of the series was the relationship between Spider and Royce. Whilst the two share an antagonism that is almost a caricature of modern journalism, the two know how to get the other to co- operate. Also, Royce has saved Spider's life and reputation several times during the series (most notably in Year Five, in which he provides Spider with key, hard-earned leads to help Spider rebuild his case against Gary \\"The Smiler\\" Callahan). In issue #32, Spider mentions Royce in an interview, describing him as \\"a good man\\"; high praise by Spider's standards. On leaving The Word, he also tells Royce that he \\"only ever did right\\" by him. Royce is a chain smoker, often seen with an entire pack of cigarettes lit in his mouth at once - typically as a response to Spider's demands or lateness of his column. His favorite pick-up line is \\"Call me Mitchell Royce, Two-Fisted Editor.\\" He mentions on at least two occasions that whenever he attends a party with Spider, he contracts some form of disease (which, of course, he blames on Spider). He is divorced, and claims at one point that at least one of his previous wives was a prostitute. His most uttered line is \\"Where's my fucking column?\\" to Spider, with varying levels of annoyance and emphasis. So ingrained is the phrase in the context of their relationship that Spider has occasionally pointed out when Royce failed to start their conversation with it, whilst at other times he has to point out that no column is due. *The Cat, a mutant white stray cat with two faces and three eyes who Spider finds lurking on the porch of his first apartment. He takes her in, and thereafter she lives a comfortable life eating lizards (which have replaced rats as dominant pests in the City), smoking Russian cigarettes, hunting or killing assorted other animals, and urinating when or where she pleases. *Tico Cortez, an old Mexican friend of Spider's from before he left the City. Tico remembers when Spider still had hair, and preferred him that way. He is a \\"foglet\\", a sentient cloud of nano-machines that can replicate any form and create matter or objects from thin air. Tico usually appears as a translucent pink cloud topped by the head of a Latino man with a goatee and small devil's horns. *Mary, a \\"Revival\\" woman and former photojournalist. At an unspecified time during the early 21st century, Mary suffered chronic heart disease, and she and her husband agreed to take part in a then-new cryogenic system that would allow her to be reborn in a newer younger body in the future. Upon being \\"revived\\", however, she found herself alone in a City that was more strange and complex than she could have imagined, and her husband having by misfortune been unable to join her in cryofreeze and thus long dead. She was initially placed in a hostel full of others like herself, and like most other Revivals, sank into depression and near-catatonia, mentally unprepared to handle their strange new future. Mary began to recover psychologically when Spider discovered and befriended her, lending Mary financial assistance so that she could get a room of her own, and giving her a camera, which allows her to aid Spider with photographic evidence in the Martial Law arc. *Vita Severn, a political director for \\"The Smiler\\". Although her own support for \\"The Smiler\\" is not without sharp criticism, she does so because she believes that he is the only candidate who can unseat \\"The Beast\\", and that she can use her position to promote crucial issues and encourage the population to better themselves. Vita befriends Spider, and the two appear attracted to one another, but the beginnings of a romantic relationship are cut short when Vita is assassinated. A devotional cult which sees her as a martyr springs up after her death (with shrines that echo those of the late Princess Diana), and Spider makes it his personal mission to bring her killer and those who organized the assassination to justice. *Detective Malandra Newton, a CPD detective stationed at Dante Street precinct house, and one of the few honest cops in the City. She was involved in the Rory Lockwood investigation and was forced to remain silent about the fact that it was deliberately being buried by the police. However, she co-operates with Spider during his investigation prior to his incapacitation in the ruinstorm, and subdues and arrests the Smiler at the conclusion of the Martial Law arc. *Oscar Rossini, Yelena's father and a well-known political figure, who supported Senator Longmarch's campaign against \\"The Beast\\". Known for his philanthropy and good nature, he bears a striking physical resemblance to Spider, as well as sharing a similar sense of humour. He shelters Spider (as a way of keeping his daughter close and safe) after he is incapacitated during the Dirge arc. When they reveal a massacre perpetrated by the National Guard and the identity of Vita Severn's assassin, he allows Spider, Channon, and Yelena to escape and finish their work, while he and Lau Qi remain to capture their imminent arrest on camera and further embarrass the White House. He accepted his arrest with confidence and promised to return the unpleasant favor on the arresting officers. It's assumed that Oscar is eventually acquitted after the Smiler's downfall. *Lau Qi, a young Chinese-American woman who is co-founder of The Hole, a feedsite (a futuristic website/file-sharing network) that runs unbiased news coverage as well as allowing people to upload, download, and share other downloadable media. Qi later admitted that they only set The Hole up in the first place to distribute pornography, and that news had been a \\"sideline\\". Spider turns to Qi (pronounced \\"Kay\\") and her colleague/boyfriend John Nkrumah when he is forced to leave The Word after the board of directors, pressured by The Smiler, have him fired; this is in spite of Qi being incredibly apolitical. During The Cure/Martial Law arc, Spider forces her to accompany him as he and his comrades try to evade the National Guard. She is last seen enjoying a glass of wine with Oscar Rossini and setting up cameras to capture his imminent arrest. It's likely she was apprehended (and eventually acquitted) along with him. Antagonists Presidents *The Beast: The Beast is (and was) a two-term president whom Spider Jerusalem despised for his political tactics and condescending attitude toward the population. A Richard Nixon- esque President, The Beast possesses something of a superiority complex and has few qualms with punishing districts which don't support him. Spider repeatedly accused the Beast of being a power-hungry politician who had no real beliefs, who wanted to be president but had no interest in actually doing the job required of him. However, as Spider finds out in an interview, the Beast simply believes in \\"getting through the day,\\" doing the bare minimum required of him in order to ensure that the country continues to run and that at least the bare majority of the population survives. Unlike \\"The Smiler\\", the Beast's real name is mentioned only in passing early on in the series, and it was Spider who gave him the nickname. The Beast's supporters and even his own children refer to him by his nickname, for which he despises Spider. Spider explains that the name originated from his mental picture of the man, \\"a big black animal squatting in the heart of America... the thing in us that votes to fuck other people in the gall bladder, the lizard brain that says nothing but eat-kill-hump-shit.\\" *The Smiler, real name Gary Callahan, is the presidential candidate who is elected at the end of the first story arc of the comic. Nicknamed for his wide, rigid, nearly perpetual grin, the Smiler is originally given Spider's grudging support, until he proves to be far-more corrupt and dangerous than the Beast, eventually becoming the primary antagonist of the series. The Smiler privately admits to Spider that he hates everyone and only wants to be President in order to control and oppress people. Eventually, he begins a personal vendetta against Spider after the journalist repeatedly humiliates him in the public eye. The Smiler goes so far as to send assassins after him, have Spider fired from The Word, and sic the National Guard on the cynical journalist. The Smiler also has no qualms about killing anyone whose death will help him gain or keep power, as demonstrated by his orchestration of the assassinations of Vita Severn and, later, his wife and children. According to Fred Christ, every time the Smiler's support fades he has someone close killed (such that it looks like an accident) in order to regain loyalty via sympathy. Spider finally exposes Callahan for what he is at the end of the series, at which point he's arrested by Detective Newton, perhaps the only cop immune to the Smiler's corrupt influence. In the final issue, it's revealed that he has been denied presidential pardon by his successor, and despite a few hard-core supporters is quickly running out of the money and resources that will allow him to forestall the legal process, implying that he will probably be convicted and incarcerated. Other antagonists *Fred Christ: The Leader of \\"Transient\\" genetic movement, and later the Church of Christ religious movement. Fred began as a manager for several small-time rock bands, but later became a figurehead among \\"Transients,\\" inter-species body modification fetishists who were in the process of transforming their own DNA into that of an alien species from a colony called Old Vilnius. Taking up residence in the Transient-heavy slum of Angels 8, Fred turned the Transient movement into a cult of personality centered around himself, and announced the intention of Angels 8 to secede from the City to Old Vilnius. However, Fred made a deal with 'The Smiler\\" to start a riot that would leave many Transients killed or wounded by the police, in order to damage the Mayor's reputation. Fred himself was arrested after the riots, when he'scaught having sex with a thirteen-year-old Transient. After the riots ended, Fred set up the Church of Christ, continuing his cult with the Smiler's backing, in exchange for certain favours for Callahan and members of his administration. Fred, who already had a reputation for being extremely lecherous, prostituted the female converts of his Church (known as \\"Brides of Christ\\") to Callahan and his staff, while paying for a \\"massive wetware upgrade\\" for Josh Freeh, the Smiler's straw man running mate, who was in fact grown in a cloning tank to specification so that Callahan's vice-presidential nominee would have a clean record. He's repeatedly interviewed by Spider, under escalating violence. During the rioting following the Smiler's declaration of martial law, Fred and some of the other Transients were shot and killed by National Guardsmen. *Stomponato: A vicious, sapient, talking bulldog who is also a police officer. Stomponato swears vengeance against Spider when, after catching Stomponato trying to brutalize and extort a stripper, he knocks him unconscious and pays a shady veterinarian to emasculate the dog. Thereafter, whenever Spider's name is uttered he is prone to going into rabid fits. After pursuing Spider following a disturbance at his second apartment, Stomponato is hit repeatedly by moving vehicles, attacked by (similarly sapient) alley cats, and blinded with holy water by priests in quick succession, before plunging off a wharf into a canal, presumably dying from the fall. *Indira Ataturk, a former assistant of Spider's whose life and reputation were ruined while working for him. During the investigation of a strip bar which was reputed to be using technology to transform the patrons into sex-crazed maniacs, Indira fell under its effects and accidentally became a famous amateur porn actress when someone captured video footage of her engaged in orgiastic group sex. She later, whilst working as assistant to his boss Mitchell Royce, attempted to get revenge on Spider by tipping off assassins and cutting off his insurance, utilities, and other privileges while he was being hunted down. *The Wife: A woman to whom Spider was briefly married. Little is known about her except that she was violent, alcoholic, promiscuous, unfaithful, and utterly hated Spider (a feeling that Spider returned with equal hatred). Spider's wife hated him so much that she had herself put in cryogenic stasis (like Mary and the other Revivals) with orders to revive her only once Spider was confirmed to be dead. Before doing so, she offended an anti-\\"exoteric\\" religious sect in order to motivate them to kill Spider so that she could be revived soon. In order to placate the sect, Spider threw his Wife's frozen head over the side of a building into the canal below, stating \\" Since when does water go crunch?\\" (that was actually Stomponato after he jumped off the wharf unnoticed a moment before). But then he hears a satisfactory plop and says, \\"More like a sloosh than a splash.\\" *Alan Schact: The Smiler's political consultant. Schact and Vita constantly bicker about how the Smiler's campaign should be managed, often trying to make one another look bad in front of the press. Unlike Vita, who believes that Callahan can embody a \\"third way\\" between conservatism and liberalism, Schact believes that the \\"third way\\" means finding a balance between honesty and outright deception. Spider believes and later proves that Schact is the prime architect of Vita Severn's assassination, and eventually exposes him as a predatory pedophile. Schact later commits suicide after being exposed and incinerates his home to minimise any damaging evidence it might yield. Spider eventually makes his survival known to the City by defecating on Schact's grave. *Bob Heller, a virulently, openly conservative (bordering on fascist) and racist candidate who has overwhelming support in the state of Florida. His name and manner, as well as various visual clues, indicate that he is meant to be portrayed as an exaggerated futuristic version of Adolf Hitler, and Spider once describes him as such: \\"Hitler stuffed to the skin with Viagra, Jumpstart (a fictional stimulant drug), gila monster genes, and syphilis.\\" Heller commands the support of a large group of provincial, xenophobic, mostly working-class nationalists, and despises anyone that can be labelled as a pacifist, \\"weirdo,\\" or member of a \\"lower race\\", all of whom Heller sums up as \\"The Weak.\\" (Spider, in turn, dismissively generalizes Heller's average supporter as \\"the neo-Nazi subhuman vote\\" and \\"Joe Fuckface Sportsbar.\\") Still, his wholehearted devotion to his extreme cause even makes Spider nervous. After writing about one of Heller's violence-themed and profanity-laden campaign speeches, Spider felt compelled to append the comment, \\"I swear I didn't make a word of that up.\\" The Smiler cuts a corrupt deal with Heller in order to get the Florida vote, which Spider gleefully exposes; this exposure presumably destroys much of Heller's influence, as he is never a factor in any of the subsequent plot arcs. Others * Ziang Huai, Channon's boyfriend, a technophiliac who sports several pounds of cybernetic machinery built into his body. Ziang is introduced as a follower of Gaian-Bias Buddhism, a religion created to allow its followers to implant themselves with non-biodegradable cybernetics without having to feel bad and to justify cheating on their significant others. Although she realized he wasn't really in love with her, Channon could not help but love him, making their eventual break-up all the more unbearable; he leaves Channon to become a foglet and is never seen again. Whilst he made no further appearances, when Channon and Yelena are at a gun range, Channon tells the simulator to generate the following set of targets: \\"Six. Male. Asian-American. City Modern. Slim. Under thirty.\\" All six targets bear a striking resemblance to Ziang, and she obliterates them with gusto. * Robert McX, a Scottish-American journalist and media personality whose regular television show is a roundup of political events from Washington D.C. as well as various op/ed pieces. He is a tall, burly man with a buzzcut and a thick mustache, as well as a distinctive scar next to his right eye, that runs vertically across almost the full length of his face. McX's facial structure and mustache give him an appearance similar to that of G. Gordon Liddy, though he differs from Liddy in his scar and full head of hair. :Whilst many other journalists in Transmetropolitan are presented as being primarily media personalities uninterested in delivering the truth, McX is depicted as being at least reasonably principled. Whilst his personal politics seems to be moderate conservatism or possibly elements of Objectivism, he has a measure of respect and admiration for Spider, mainly because their purpose is similar. At the end of The Cure it is McX who gets to use Spider's research to publicly accuse the Smiler of having an affair with Liesl, a transient hooker, which he does with a smirk on his face. McX is also one of the leading figures in the journalists' revolt towards the middle of the Martial Law arc (he is the first to openly defy the media blackout), and acts as a catalyst to the consciences of other journalists, leading to the widespread defiance of the media blackout that the Smiler has instituted. He has a secret infestation of intelligent venereal tapeworms, and refers to his life as a series of \\"horrible days.\\" * Kristen, a highly popular drug dealer and previously a political fixer. She worked on a campaign against the Beast, where Spider first knew her. She has a distinctly abnormal eye (possibly cybernetic) and some unusual mannerisms that lead some characters to believe she's at least partly non-human. After using her as a source for several stories, Spider turns on her when he learns her political contacts gave her information about Vita Severn's assassination - she had used her inside knowledge to bet on the likelihood of her death, using the winnings to buy a bar. For revealing this information to Spider, she and her bodyguards (one of whom resembles an adult Charlie Brown) are assassinated by a man in a blur suit. * Senator Tartleton Sweeney, a U.S. Senator who becomes embroiled in a pornography scandal. Sweeney, who had filibustered a number of bills concerning sexual education reform, was alleged to have been paid substantial amounts of money and other gifts for doing so, as well as funding (and supposedly appearing in) a number of pornographic movies; Spider then spent the majority of issue #27 harassing and gathering evidence against him. Spider makes an example of Sweeney to teach his assistants the tactic of \\"monstering,\\" relentlessly and offensively hounding public figures wherever they go. * Liesl Barclay, a transient prostitute and drug abuser; she later took 'The Cure', allowing her to revert to human form. She was hired to sleep with the Smiler, but is the only one left alive who did so, as the Smiler has been slowly but surely murdering all the girls connected to him to prevent the risk of leaked information. Spider rescues her from imminent death and she gives him the interview and genetic evidence to back up the story. Soon after, martial law is declared, and she refuses to go with Spider's merry band, annoyed that he \\"treat(ed her) like a prostitute\\" by getting what he wanted out of her and then seemingly ignoring her, and summarily gets run down and killed in the street by unidentified men in black. However, her death prevents the rest of Spider's group from being apprehended. * James Longmarch, a deceased Senator who had run for President against the Beast. His campaign had been supported by Oscar Rossini. His likeness was used by the Smiler in a campaign endorsement. Spider admits to having voted for him when he ran against The Beast.

The palace economy of the Aegean region and Anatolia that characterized the Late Bronze Age disintegrated, transforming into the small isolated village cultures of the Greek Dark Ages. The half-century between and 1150 BCE saw the cultural collapse of the Mycenaean kingdoms, of the Kassites in Babylonia, of the Hittite Empire in Anatolia and the Levant, and the New Kingdom of Egypt;For Syria, see M.

Richard, \\"Archaeological sources for the history of Palestine: The Early Bronze Age: The rise and collapse of urbanism\\", The Biblical Archaeologist (1987) The deterioration of these governments interrupted trade routes and severely reduced literacy in much of this area. In the first phase of this period, almost every city between Pylos and Gaza was violently destroyed, and many abandoned, including Hattusa, Mycenae, and Ugarit.The physical destruction of palaces and cities is the subject of Robert Drews's The End of the Bronze Age: changes in warfare and the catastrophe ca. 1200 B.C., 1993. According to Robert Drews, \\"Within a period of forty to fifty years at the end of the thirteenth and the beginning of the twelfth century almost every significant city in the eastern Mediterranean world was destroyed, many of them never to be occupied again.\\"Drews, 1993, p. 4 Only a few powerful states, particularly Assyria, the New Kingdom of Egypt (albeit badly weakened), Phoenicia and Elam survived the Bronze Age collapse. However, by the end of the 12th century BCE, Elam waned after its defeat by Nebuchadnezzar I, who briefly revived Babylonian fortunes before suffering a series of defeats by the Assyrians. Upon the death of Ashur-bel-kala in 1056 BCE, Assyria went into a comparative decline for the next 100 or so years, its empire shrinking significantly. By 1020 BCE, Assyria appears to have controlled only the areas in its immediate vicinity; its well- defended heartland was not threatened during the collapse. By the time of Wenamun, Phoenicia had regained independence from Egypt. Gradually, by the end of the ensuing Dark Age, remnants of the Hittites coalesced into small Syro- Hittite states in Cilicia and the Levant, the latter states being composed of mixed Hittite and Aramean polities. Beginning in the mid-10th century BCE, a series of small Aramean kingdoms formed in the Levant and the Philistines settled in southern Canaan, where Canaanite speakers had coalesced into a number of defined polities such as Israel, Moab, Edom and Ammon. From 935 BCE, Assyria began to reorganize and once more expand outwards, leading to the Neo- Assyrian Empire (911‚Äì605 BCE), which came to control a vast area from the Caucasus to Egypt, and from Greek Cyprus to Persia. Phrygians, Cimmerians and Lydians arrived in Anatolia and a new Hurrian polity of Urartu formed in eastern Anatolia and Transcaucasia, where the Colchians (west Georgians) also emerged. The Greek Dark Ages lasted roughly until the early 8th century BC with the rise of Archaic Greece and Greek colonization of the Mediterranean basin during the Orientalizing period. Soon after 1000 BCE, Iranian peoples such as the Persians, Medes, Parthians and Sargatians first appeared in ancient Iran. These groups displaced earlier non-Indo-European-speaking peoples such as the Kassites, Hurrians, and Gutian people in the northwest of the region. However, the Elamites and Mannaeans continued to dominate the southwest and Caspian Sea regions, respectively. A range of explanations for the collapse have been proposed, without any achieving consensus. Several factors probably played a part, including climatic changes (such as those caused by volcanic eruptions), invasions by groups such as the Sea Peoples, the effects of the spread of iron-based metallurgy, developments in military weapons and tactics, and a variety of failures of political, social and economic systems. Regional evidence Evidence of destruction Anatolia Before the Bronze Age collapse, Anatolia (Asia Minor) was dominated by a number of peoples of varying ethno-linguistic origins, including: Semitic-speaking Assyrians and Amorites, Hurro-Urartian-speaking Hurrians, Kaskians and Hattians, and later-arriving Indo-European peoples such as the Luwians, Hittites, Mitanni, and Mycenaeans. From the 16th century BCE, the Mitanni, a migratory minority speaking an Indic language, formed a ruling class over the Hurrians. Similarly, the Indo-European-speaking Hittites absorbed the Hattians,Gurnet, Otto, (1982), The Hittites (Penguin) pp. 119‚Äì130. a people speaking a language that may have been of the non‚ÄìIndo- European North Caucasian languages or a language isolate. Every Anatolian site, apart from integral Assyrian regions in the southeast and regions in eastern, central and southern Anatolia under the control of the powerful Middle Assyrian Empire (1392‚Äì1050 BCE) that was important during the preceding Late Bronze Age, shows a destruction layer and it appears that in these regions civilization did not recover to the level of the Assyrians and Hittites for another thousand years or so. The Hittites, already weakened by a series of military defeats and annexations of their territory by the Middle Assyrian Empire, which had already destroyed the Hurrian-Mitanni Empire, then suffered a coup de gr√¢ce when Hattusa, the Hittite capital, was burned, probably by the Kaskians, long indigenous to the southern shores of the Black Sea, possibly aided by the incoming Indo-European‚Äìspeaking Phrygians. The city was abandoned and never reoccupied. Karaoƒülan, near present-day Ankara, was burned and the corpses left unburied. Many other sites that were not destroyed were abandoned. The Luwian city of Troy was destroyed at least twice, before being abandoned until Roman times; it is famous as the site of the Trojan War. The Phrygians had arrived, probably over the Bosporus or Caucasus Mountains, in the 13th century BCE,Bryce, Trevor. The Kingdom of the Hittites. (Clarendon), p. 379 before being first stopped by the Assyrians and then conquered by them in the Early Iron Age of the 12th century BCE. Other groups of Indo-European peoples followed the Phrygians into the region, most prominently the Dorians and Lydians, and in the centuries after the period of Bronze Age Collapse, Cimmerians and the Iranian-speaking Scythians also appeared. Semitic-speaking Arameans and Kartvelian-speaking Colchians, and revived Hurrian polities, particularly Urartu, Nairi and Shupria also emerged in parts of the region and Transcaucasia. The Assyrians simply continued their already extant policies, by conquering any of these new peoples and polities they came into contact with, as they had with the preceding polities of the region. However Assyria gradually withdrew from much of the region for a time in the second half of the 11th century BCE, although they continued to campaign militarily at times, in order to protect their borders and keep trade routes open, until a renewed vigorous period of expansion in the late 10th century BCE. These sites in Anatolia show evidence of the collapse: * Troy * Miletus * Hattusa * Mersin * Tar·∏´unta≈°≈°a Cyprus The catastrophe separates Late Cypriot II (LCII) from the LCIII period, with the sacking and burning of Enkomi, Kition, and Sinda, which may have occurred twice before those sites were abandoned.Robbins, Manuel (2001). Collapse of the Bronze Age: The Story of Greece, Troy, Israel and Egypt and the Peoples of the Sea. pp. 220‚Äì239 During the reign of the Hittite king Tud·∏´aliya IV (reigned c. 1237‚Äì1209 BCE), the island was briefly invaded by the Hittites,Bryce, Trevor. The Kingdom of the Hittites (Clarendon), p. 366. either to secure the copper resource or as a way of preventing piracy. Shortly afterwards, the island was reconquered by his son Suppiluliuma II around 1200 BCE. Some towns (Enkomi, Kition, Palaeokastro and Sinda) show traces of destruction at the end of LCII. Whether or not this is really an indication of a Mycenean invasion is contested. Originally, two waves of destruction in c. 1230 BCE by the Sea Peoples and c. 1190 BCE by Aegean refugees have been proposed.Paul Astr√∂m has proposed dates of 1190 and 1179 BCE (Astr√∂m). Alashiya was plundered by the Sea Peoples and ceased to exist in 1085 BCE. The smaller settlements of Agios Dimitrios and Kokkinokremmos, as well as a number of other sites, were abandoned but do not show traces of destruction. Kokkinokremmos was a short- lived settlement, where various caches concealed by metalsmiths have been found. That no one ever returned to reclaim the treasures suggests that they were killed or enslaved. Recovery occurred only in the Early Iron Age with Phoenician and Greek settlement. These sites in Cyprus show evidence of the collapse: * Palaeokastro * Kition * Sinda * Enkomi Syria A map of the Bronze Age collapse Ancient Syria had been initially dominated by a number of indigenous Semitic-speaking peoples. The East Semitic-speaking polities of Ebla, the Akkadian Empire and the Northwest Semitic-speaking people of Ugarit and the Amorites (\\"Amurru\\") were prominent among them. Syria during this time was known as \\"The land of the Amurru\\". Before and during the Bronze Age Collapse, Syria became a battleground between the Hittites, the Middle Assyrian Empire, the Mitanni and the New Kingdom of Egypt between the 15th and late 13th centuries BCE, with the Assyrians destroying the Hurri-Mitanni empire and annexing much of the Hittite empire. The Egyptian empire had withdrawn from the region after failing to overcome the Hittites and being fearful of the ever-growing Assyrian might, leaving much of the region under Assyrian control until the late 11th century BCE. Later the coastal regions came under attack from the Sea Peoples. During this period, from the 12th century BCE, the incoming Northwest Semitic-speaking Arameans came to demographic prominence in Syria, the region outside of the Canaanite-speaking Phoenician coastal areas eventually came to speak Aramaic and the region came to be known as Aramea and Eber Nari. The Babylonians belatedly attempted to gain a foothold in the region during their brief revival under Nebuchadnezzar I in the 12th century BCE, however they too were overcome by their Assyrian neighbors. The modern term \\"Syria\\" is a later Indo-European corruption of \\"Assyria\\", which only became formally applied to the Levant during the Seleucid Empire (323‚Äì150 BCE) (see Etymology of Syria). Levantine sites previously showed evidence of trade links with Mesopotamia (Sumer, Akkad, Assyria and Babylonia), Anatolia (Hattia, Hurria, Luwia and later the Hittites), Egypt and the Aegean in the Late Bronze Age. Evidence at Ugarit shows that the destruction there occurred after the reign of Merneptah (r. 1213‚Äì1203 BCE) and even the fall of Chancellor Bay (d. 1192 BCE). The last Bronze Age king of Ugarit, Ammurapi, was a contemporary of the last-known Hittite king, Suppiluliuma II. The exact dates of his reign are unknown. A letter by the king is preserved on one of the clay tablets found baked in the conflagration of the destruction of the city. Ammurapi stresses the seriousness of the crisis faced by many Levantine states due to attacks. In response to a plea for assistance from the king of Alasiya, Ammurapi highlights the desperate situation Ugarit faced in letter RS 18.147: Eshuwara, the senior governor of Cyprus, responded in letter RS 20.18: The ruler of Carchemish sent troops to assist Ugarit, but Ugarit was sacked. A letter sent after the destruction said: The destruction levels of Ugarit contained Late Helladic IIIB ware, but no LH IIIC (see Mycenaean Greece). Therefore, the date of the destruction is important for the dating of the LH IIIC phase. Since an Egyptian sword bearing the name of Pharaoh Merneptah was found in the destruction levels, 1190 BCE was taken as the date for the beginning of the LH IIIC. A cuneiform tablet found in 1986 shows that Ugarit was destroyed after the death of Merneptah. It is generally agreed that Ugarit had already been destroyed by the 8th year of Ramesses III, 1178 BCE. Letters on clay tablets that were baked in the conflagration caused by the destruction of the city speak of attack from the sea, and a letter from Alashiya (Cyprus) speaks of cities already being destroyed by attackers who came by sea. The West Semitic Arameans eventually superseded the earlier Amorites and people of Ugarit. The Arameans, together with the Phoenicians and the Syro-Hittite states came to dominate most of the region demographically, however these people, and the Levant in general, were also conquered and dominated politically and militarily by the Middle Assyrian Empire until Assyria's withdrawal in the late 11th century BCE, although the Assyrians continued to conduct military campaigns in the region. However, with the rise of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in the late 10th century BCE, the entire region once again fell to Assyria. These sites in Syria show evidence of the collapse: * Ugarit * Tell Sukas * Kadesh * Qatna * Hama * Alalakh * Aleppo * Emar Southern Levant Egyptian evidence shows that from the reign of Horemheb (ruled either 1319 or 1306 to 1292 BCE), wandering Shasu were more problematic than the earlier Apiru. Ramesses II (r. 1279‚Äì1213 BCE) campaigned against them, pursuing them as far as Moab, where he established a fortress, after a near defeat at the Battle of Kadesh. During the reign of Merneptah, the Shasu threatened the \\"Way of Horus\\" north from Gaza. Evidence shows that Deir Alla (Succoth) was destroyed after the reign of Queen Twosret (r. 1191‚Äì1189 BCE).Tubbs, Johnathan (1998), \\"Canaanites\\" (British Museum Press) The destroyed site of Lachish was briefly reoccupied by squatters and an Egyptian garrison, during the reign of Ramesses III (r. 1186‚Äì1155 BCE). All centres along a coastal route from Gaza northward were destroyed, and evidence shows Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Acre, and Jaffa were burned and not reoccupied for up to thirty years. Inland Hazor, Bethel, Beit Shemesh, Eglon, Debir, and other sites were destroyed. Refugees escaping the collapse of coastal centres may have fused with incoming nomadic and Anatolian elements to begin the growth of terraced hillside hamlets in the highlands region that was associated with the later development of the Hebrews. During the reign of Rameses III, Philistines were allowed to resettle the coastal strip from Gaza to Joppa, Denyen (possibly the tribe of Dan in the Bible, or more likely the people of Adana, also known as Danuna, part of the Hittite Empire) settled from Joppa to Acre, and Tjekker in Acre. The sites quickly achieved independence, as the Tale of Wenamun shows. These sites in the Southern Levant show evidence of the collapse: * Hazor * Akko * Megiddo * Deir 'Alla (Sukkot) * Bethel * Beth Shemesh * Lachish * Ashdod * Ashkelon Greece None of the Mycenaean palaces of the Late Bronze Age survived (with the possible exception of the Cyclopean fortifications on the Acropolis of Athens), with destruction being heaviest at palaces and fortified sites. Thebes was one of the earliest examples of this, having its palace sacked repeatedly between 1300 and 1200 BCE and eventually being completely destroyed by fire. The extent of this destruction is highlighted by Robert Drews who reasons that the destruction was such that Thebes did not resume a significant position in Greece until at least the late 12th century. Many other sites offer less conclusive causes; for example it is entirely unclear what happened at Athens, although it is clear that the settlement saw a significant decline during the Bronze Age Collapse. While there is no evidence of any significant destruction at this site, lacking the remnants of a destroyed palace or central structure, the change in locations of living quarters and burial sites demonstrates a significant recession clearly. Furthermore, an increase in fortification at this site is suggestive of much fear of the decline in Athens to the extent that Vincent Desborough makes an assertion that this is evidence of later migrations away from the city in reaction to its initial decline, although a significant population did remain. It is possible though that this emigration from Athens was not a violent affair and other causes have been suggested. Nancy Demand posits that environmental changes could well have played a significant role in the collapse of Athens. In particular Demand notes in the presence of \\"enclosed and protected means of access to water sources at Athens\\" as evidence of persistent droughts in the region that could have resulted in a fragile reliance on imports. View of the Megaron of the palace at Tiryns, one of the many Greek palaces destroyed during the Bronze Age Collapse. Up to 90% of small sites in the Peloponnese were abandoned, suggesting a major depopulation. Again, as with many of the sites of destruction in Greece, it is unclear how a lot of this destruction came about. The city of Mycenae for example was initially destroyed in an earthquake in 1250 BCE as evidenced by the presence of crushed bodies buried in collapsed buildings. However, the site was rebuilt only to face destruction in 1190 BCE as the result of a series of major fires. There is a suggestion by Robert Drews that the fires could have been the result of an attack on the site and its palace; however, Eric Cline points out the lack of archaeological evidence for an attack. Thus, while fire was definitely the cause of the destruction, it is unclear what or who caused it. We see a similar situation concurring in Tiryns in 1200 BCE, when an earthquake destroyed much of the city including its palace. It is likely however that the city continued to be inhabited for some time following the earthquake. As a result, there is a general agreement that earthquakes did not permanently destroy Mycenae or Tiryns because, as is highlighted by Guy Middleton, \\"Physical destruction then cannot fully explain the collapse\\". Drews points out that there was continued occupation and attempts to rebuild at these sites demonstrating the continuation of Tiryns as a settlement. Demand suggests instead that the cause could again be environmental, particularly the lack of homegrown food and the important role of palaces in managing and storing food imports, implying that their destruction only stood to exacerbate the more crucial factor of food shortage. The importance of trade as a factor is supported by Spyros Iakovidis, who points out the lack of evidence for violent or sudden decline in Mycenae. Pylos offers some more clues as to its destruction, as the intensive and extensive destruction by fire around 1180 is reflective of a violent destruction of the city. There is some evidence of Pylos expecting a seaborne attack, with tablets at Pylos discussing \\"Watchers guarding the coast\\". Eric Cline refutes the idea that this is evidence of an attack by Sea People, pointing out that the tablet does not give any context as to what is being watched for and why; as such, Cline does not see naval attacks as playing a role in Pylos's decline. Demand, however, argues that, regardless of what the threat from the sea was, it likely played a role in the decline, at least in hindering trade and perhaps vital food imports. The Bronze Age collapse marked the start of what has been called the Greek Dark Ages, which lasted roughly 400 years and ended with the establishment of Archaic Greece. Other cities, such as Athens, continued to be occupied, but with a more local sphere of influence, limited evidence of trade and an impoverished culture, from which it took centuries to recover. These sites in Greece show evidence of the collapse: * Teichos Dymaion (el) * Pylos * Nichoria * Menelaion * Tiryns * Mycenae * Thebes * Lefkandi * IolkosDrews, Robert (1993), The End of the Bronze Age: Changes in Warfare and the Catastrophe ca. 1200 BCE (Princeton University Press) * Knossos * Kydonia Areas that survived Mesopotamia The Middle Assyrian Empire (1392‚Äì1056 BCE) had destroyed the Hurrian-Mitanni Empire, annexed much of the Hittite Empire and eclipsed the Egyptian Empire, and at the beginning of the Late Bronze Age collapse controlled an empire stretching from the Caucasus mountains in the north to the Arabian peninsula in the south, and from Ancient Iran in the east to Cyprus in the west. However, in the 12th century BCE, Assyrian satrapies in Anatolia came under attack from the Mushki (who may have been Phrygians), and those in the Levant from Arameans, but Tiglath-Pileser I (reigned 1114‚Äì1076 BCE) was able to defeat and repel these attacks, conquering the incomers. The Middle Assyrian Empire survived intact throughout much of this period, with Assyria dominating and often ruling Babylonia directly, controlling south east and south western Anatolia, north western Iran and much of northern and central Syria and Canaan, as far as the Mediterranean and Cyprus.Georges Roux, Ancient Iraq The Arameans and Phrygians were subjected, and Assyria and its colonies were not threatened by the Sea Peoples who had ravaged Egypt and much of the East Mediterranean, and the Assyrians often conquered as far as Phoenicia and the East Mediterranean. However, after the death of Ashur-bel- kala in 1056 BCE, Assyria withdrew to areas close to its natural borders, encompassing what is today northern Iraq, north east Syria, the fringes of north west Iran, and south eastern Turkey. Assyria still retained a stable monarchy, the best army in the world, and an efficient civil administration, enabling it to survive the Bronze Age Collapse intact. Assyrian written records remained numerous and the most consistent in the world during the period, and the Assyrians were still able to mount long range military campaigns in all directions when necessary. From the late 10th century BCE, it once more began to assert itself internationally, with the Neo-Assyrian Empire growing to be the largest the world had yet seen. The situation in Babylonia was very different. After the Assyrian withdrawal, it was still subject to periodic Assyrian (and Elamite) subjugation, and new groups of Semitic speakers such as the Aramaeans, Suteans (and in the period after the Bronze Age Collapse, Chaldeans also), spread unchecked into Babylonia from the Levant, and the power of its weak kings barely extended beyond the city limits of Babylon. Babylon was sacked by the Elamites under Shutruk-Nahhunte (c. 1185‚Äì1155 BCE), and lost control of the Diyala River valley to Assyria. Egypt After apparently surviving for a while, the Egyptian Empire collapsed in the mid-twelfth century BCE (during the reign of Ramesses VI, 1145 to 1137 BCE). Previously, the Merneptah Stele (c. 1200 BCE) spoke of attacks (Libyan War) from Putrians (from modern Libya), with associated people of Ekwesh, Shekelesh, Lukka, Shardana and Teresh (possibly Troas), and a Canaanite revolt, in the cities of Ashkelon, Yenoam and among the people of Israel. A second attack (Battle of the Delta and Battle of Djahy) during the reign of Ramesses III (1186‚Äì1155 BCE) involved Peleset, Tjeker, Shardana and Denyen. The Nubian War, the First Libyan War, the Northern War and the Second Libyan War were all victories for Ramses. Due to this however, the economy of the Egyptians was becoming bankrupt but not collapsing, at least not yet. By beating the Libyans, Sea People, and Nubians, the territory around Egypt was safe during the collapse of the Bronze Age. Moreover, his campaigns in Asia also destroyed the economy. With the win over the Syrians as documented, Ramses stated, \\"My sword is great and mighty like that of Montu. No land can stand fast before my arms. I am a king rejoicing in slaughter. My reign is calmed in peace.\\" With this claim, Ramses implicated that his reign is safe in the wake of fallout from the Bronze Age.  Impact  Robert Drews describes the collapse as \\"the worst disaster in ancient history, even more calamitous than the collapse of the Western Roman Empire.\\"[22] Cultural memories of the disaster told of a \\"lost golden age\\": for example, Hesiod spoke of Ages of Gold, Silver, and Bronze, separated from the cruel modern Age of Iron by the Age of Heroes. Rodney Castledon suggests that memories of the Bronze Age collapse influenced Plato's story of Atlantis[23] in Timaeus and the Critias. Possible causes Various theories have been put forward as possible contributors to the collapse, many of them mutually compatible. Environmental Volcanoes Some Egyptologists have dated the Hekla 3 volcanic eruption in Iceland to 1159 BCE, and blamed it for famines under Ramesses III during the wider Bronze Age collapse. Other estimated dates for the Hekla 3 eruption range from 1021 BCE (¬±130) to 1135 BCE (¬±130) and 929 BCE (¬±34).Late Holocene solifluction history reconstructed using tephrochronology, Martin P.

Drought  Speculation that drought was a cause in the collapse of the Late Bronze Age has been targeted in research studies. During what may have been the driest era of the Late Bronze Age, the tree cover around the Mediterranean forest dwindled during the period. Primary sources report that the era was marked by large-scale migration of peoples at the end of the Late Bronze Age. Scientists state that the contraction of the Mediterranean forest was because of drought and not due to an increase in the domestication and clearing of land for agricultural purposes. In the Dead Sea region (Israel and Jordan), the subsurface water level dropped by more than 50 meters. According to the geography of that region, for water levels to drop so drastically the amount of rain the surrounding mountains received would have been dismal. In addition to the spread of drought across the region, drought in the Nile Valley has been thought to also be a contributing factor to the rise of the Sea Peoples and their sudden migration across the eastern Mediterranean. It was suspected that these crop failures, famine and the population reduction that resulted from the lackluster flow of the Nile and the migration of the Sea Peoples led to New Kingdom Egypt falling into political instability at the end of the Late Bronze Age and well into the Iron Age. Using the Palmer Drought Index for 35 Greek, Turkish and Middle Eastern weather stations, it was shown that a drought of the kind that persisted from January 1972 AD would have affected all of the sites associated with the Late Bronze Age collapse. Drought could have easily precipitated or hastened socioeconomic problems and led to wars. More recently, it has been claimed that the diversion of midwinter storms from the Atlantic to north of the Pyrenees and the Alps, bringing wetter conditions to Central Europe but drought to the Eastern Mediterranean, was associated with the Late Bronze Age collapse. Cultural Ironworking The Bronze Age collapse may be seen in the context of a technological history that saw the slow, comparatively continuous spread of ironworking technology in the region, beginning with precocious iron-working in present-day Bulgaria and Romania in the 13th and 12th centuries BCE.See A. Stoia and the other essays in M.L. Stig S√∏rensen and R. Thomas, eds., The Bronze Age: Iron Age Transition in Europe (Oxford) 1989, and T.H. Wertime and J.D. Muhly, The Coming of the Age of Iron (New Haven) 1980. Leonard R. Palmer suggested that iron, superior to bronze for weapons manufacturing, was in more plentiful supply and so allowed larger armies of iron users to overwhelm the smaller bronze-equipped armies that consisted largely of Maryannu chariotry.Palmer, Leonard R (1962). Mycenaeans and Minoans: Aegean Prehistory in the Light of the Linear B Tablets. New York, Alfred A. Knopf Changes in warfare Robert Drews arguesDrews 1993:192ff for the appearance of massed infantry, using newly developed weapons and armour, such as cast rather than forged spearheads and long swords, a revolutionizing cut-and-thrust weapon,Drews 1993:194 and javelins. The appearance of bronze foundries suggests \\"that mass production of bronze artefacts was suddenly important in the Aegean\\". For example, Homer uses \\"spears\\" as a virtual synonym for \\"warriors\\". Such new weaponry, in the hands of large numbers of \\"running skirmishers\\", who could swarm and cut down a chariot army, would destabilize states that were based upon the use of chariots by the ruling class. That would precipitate an abrupt social collapse as raiders began to conquer, loot and burn cities.Drews, R. (1993). The End of the Bronze Age: Changes in Warfare and the Catastrophe ca. 1200 B.C. (Princeton). General systems collapse A general systems collapse has been put forward as an explanation for the reversals in culture that occurred between the Urnfield culture of the 12th and 13th centuries BCE and the rise of the Celtic Hallstatt culture in the 9th and 10th centuries BCE.http://www.iol.ie/~edmo/linktoprehistory.html History of Castlemagner, on the web page of the local historical society. General systems collapse theory, pioneered by Joseph Tainter,Tainter, Joseph (1976). The Collapse of Complex Societies (Cambridge University Press). hypothesises how social declines in response to complexity may lead to a collapse resulting in simpler forms of society. In the specific context of the Middle East, a variety of factors ‚Äì including population growth, soil degradation, drought, cast bronze weapon and iron production technologies ‚Äì could have combined to push the relative price of weaponry (compared to arable land) to a level unsustainable for traditional warrior aristocracies. In complex societies that were increasingly fragile and less resilient, the combination of factors may have contributed to the collapse. The growing complexity and specialization of the Late Bronze Age political, economic, and social organization in Carol Thomas and Craig Conant's phraseThomas, Carol G.; Conant, Craig. (1999) Citadel to City-state: The Transformation of Greece, 1200‚Äì700 B.C.E., together made the organization of civilization too intricate to reestablish piecewise when disrupted. That could explain why the collapse was so widespread and able to render the Bronze Age civilizations incapable of recovery. The critical flaws of the Late Bronze Age are its centralization, specialization, complexity, and top-heavy political structure. These flaws then were exposed by sociopolitical events (revolt of peasantry and defection of mercenaries), fragility of all kingdoms (Mycenaean, Hittite, Ugaritic, and Egyptian), demographic crises (overpopulation), and wars between states. Other factors that could have placed increasing pressure on the fragile kingdoms include piracy by the Sea Peoples interrupting maritime trade, as well as drought, crop failure, famine, or the Dorian migration or invasion.Cline, Eric H.

It first appeared in the June 1979 issue of Gunzo (one of the most influential literary magazines in Japan), and in book form the next month. The novel was adapted by Japanese director Kazuki ≈åmori in a 1981 film distributed by Art Theatre Guild. An English translation by Alfred Birnbaum appeared in 1987. It is the first book in the so-called \\"Trilogy of the Rat\\" series of independent novels, followed by Pinball, 1973 (1980) and A Wild Sheep Chase (1982), before the later epilogue Dance Dance Dance (1988). All four books in the series have been translated into English, but Hear the Wind Sing and Pinball, 1973 (which are realist novels slightly differing from the author's later style) were never widely distributed in the English-speaking world, having only been published in Japan by Kodansha under their Kodansha English Library branding (for English Foreign Language learners), and both only as A6-sized pocketbooks. This was due to Murakami viewing the two novels as \\"works from his immature period\\".\\"Birth of the Pseudo-American Literature\\", Tokou Kouji, Suiseisha An omnibus English edition of Murakami's first two novels (Hear the Wind Sing and Pinball, 1973), under the title Wind/Pinball, with translations by Prof. Ted Goossen of York University, was released in the United States in August, 2015.

He took 1 hour each night to write the novel and finished it in 4 months. It was his debut novel. The story takes place in 1970 over a period of nineteen days between August 8 and August 28, and is narrated by a 21-year-old unnamed man. The story contains forty small chapters amounting to 130 pages. The story covers the craft of writing, the Japanese student movement, and, like later Murakami novels, relationships and loss. Like later novels, cooking, eating and drinking, and listening to western music are regularly described. The narrator's close friend 'the Rat', around whom the trilogy of the Rat evolves, is a student and bar patron who expresses a general alienation towards society. The narrator describes the (fictional) American writer Derek Hartfield as a primary influence, citing his pulp science fiction works, and quoting him at several points. Plot summary Feeling writing as a terribly painful task, the narrator re-tells the story of his 1970 summer. He was a student at a university in Tokyo then, and returned to his seaside hometown in Niigata for summer vacation. That spring, a girl he dated at the university committed suicide. During the summer vacation, he frequented J's bar with his friend \\"Rat\\" and spent much time drinking beer obsessively. One day, he came across a girl lying on the floor in the washroom of the bar and carried her home. The girl had no left little finger. Later, he ran into the girl by chance in the record store where she worked. After that, she started calling him and they hung out a few times. Meanwhile, Rat was clearly troubled about some woman but he did not disclose the details. One day, the girl without a little finger met the narrator at a restaurant near the harbor. They took a walk in the dusk along the warehouse street. She told him, \\"When I sit there alone, I can hear a lot of people coming to talk to me...\\" That night, at her apartment, she revealed she just had an abortion. When he came back in the winter, the girl had left the record store and her apartment. The narrator is married now and living in Tokyo. Rat is still writing novels and sends his manuscripts to the narrator every Christmas. Characters ;I :The narrator of the story, born on Dec 24, 1948. (Murakami was born on Jan 12, 1949). \\"I\\" was a university student studying biology who returned to their hometown for summer vacation. ;Rat :Born in September, he and \\"I\\" became friends in \\"I\\"'s freshman year and they hung out a lot. He lived in a 3-story house with a greenhouse on the rooftop. ;J :Bartender of J's Bar, a Chinese man. \\"I\\" once commented that J's Japanese is better than their own. ;The girl without a little finger :Born on January 10, she lost her left little finger at the age of 8. She had a twin sister and worked in a record shop. ;\\"I\\"'s high school classmate girl :She lent \\"I\\" a California Girls record in high school, and in the summer of 1970 made a request of the same sone on radio for me. She dropped out of university due to illness in March 1970. ;The sick girl :A 17 year old girl who contracted a disease which affected her spinal nerves and had been bedridden for 3 years. ;Three uncles :\\"I\\"'s first uncle gave them a book written by Derek Hartfield. He died three years later of intestine cancer. Their second uncle stepped on a landmine laid by himself in Shanghai 2 days after the end of World War II. Their third uncle was a traveling magician touring the hot springs around Japan. ;Three girls I slept with :The first girl was a classmate and girlfriend in high school; she and the protagonist broke up a few months after graduation. The second was a 16 years old hippie girl \\"I\\" met in the Shinjuku subway station; she stayed in their apartment for one week and left. The third was a girl \\"I\\" met in the university library who was studying French.

Self-claimed as a \\"stand-up comedian dog\\". He liked to end his program with \\"I love you guys.\\" ;Derek Hartfield :A writer who wrote a lot of pulp fictions about aliens and monsters. \\"I\\" learnt a lot about writing from him. At the time this novel was published, many channels for information like internet were non-existent. Hence many readers assumed Derek Hartfield was a real life author, so much so that many librarians were puzzled in receiving requests of books written by Derek Hartfield.\\"Âõ≥Êõ∏È§®Âè∏Êõ∏„Å®„ÅÑ„ÅÜ‰ªï‰∫ã\\", by Kubo Terumi, Chapter 1 Awards * The 22nd Gunzo Prize for New Writers (April 1979) * The 81st Akutagawa Prize (July 1979) - nominated * The 1st Noma Literary Newcomer's Prize (Dec 1979) - nominated Cultural References Music * Rainy Night in Georgia * Who'll Stop the Rain * California Girls * Piano Concerto No. 3 (Beethoven) * Nashville Skyline * Return to Sender * Everyday People * Woodstock (song) * Spirit in the Sky * Hey There Lonely Girl * Good Luck Charm Others * Fiat 600 * Richard Burton * Sentimental Education * Gimlet * Roger Vadim * Jules Michelet * Triumph TR3 * Convoy * Mother Joan of the Angels  English Language Editions    References  Category:1979 Japanese novels Category:Novels by Haruki Murakami Category:Fiction set in 1970 Category:Realist novels Category:Japanese novels adapted into films Category:1979 debut novels ","title":"Hear the Wind Sing"},{"id":"5823262","text":"Spam Bully is anti-spam software made by Axaware, LLC.

Since the 1980s, China has constructed a new legal framework for administrative law, establishing control mechanisms for overseeing the bureaucracy and disciplinary committees for the Communist Party of China. However, many have argued that the usefulness of these laws are vastly inferior in terms of controlling government actions, largely because of institutional and systemic obstacles like a weak judiciary, poorly trained judges and lawyers, and corruption.  Law reform  During the late 1970s and early 1980s, economic reforms called for an expansive role for government, and little attention was paid to administrative law. The 1982 Constitution contained provisions regarded administrative procedures, compensation, and the right to sue.Constitution of the People's Republic of China, Article 41 (1982). As the Constitution is not directly justiciable, between 1982 and 1988, there were more than 130 implementing laws and regulations which provided for administrative litigation in specific instances.Lin Feng, Administrative Law: Procedures and Remedies in China (Hong Kong: Sweet & Maxwell, 1996) at 8‚Äì9. By the end of 1988, the Supreme People's Court had established an administrative law division and more than 1400 local courts had created administrative panels to hear administrative cases.Lin, note 2 at 116. In 1987, drafting of an Administrative Procedure Law (Ë°åÊîøËØâËÆºÊ≥ï) began. The ALL was passed in 1989 and went into effect on 1 October 1990. This law made it possible for individuals to bring a case against the administration and also laid down the relevant criteria and procedures for administrative litigation. The pace of administrative law legislation increased in the 1990s. In 1990, the Administrative Supervision Regulations (Ë°åÊîøÁõëÂØüÊù°‰æã) and the Administrative Reconsideration Regulations (Ë°åÊîøÂ§çËÆÆÊù°‰æã) were passed. Both regulations have since been amended and upgraded into laws. The 1993 State Civil Servant Provisional Regulations (ÂõΩÂÆ∂ÂÖ¨Âä°ÂëòÊöÇË°åÊù°‰æã) changed the way government officials were selected and promoted, requiring that they pass exams and yearly appraisals, and introduced a rotation system. In 1994, the State Compensation Law (ÂõΩÂÆ∂ËµîÂÅøÊ≥ï) was passed, followed by the Administrative Penalties Law (Ë°åÊîøÂ§ÑÁΩöÊ≥ï) in 1996.  Administrative litigation  The Administrative Procedure Law (APL) also known as the Administrative Litigation Law (ALL) allows parties to bring suit when their lawful rights and interests are infringed by a specific administrative act of an administrative organ or its personnel.APL, Article 2. The rights and obligations of the parties involved in an administrative litigation in China are important for realizing the targets, to protect the individuals‚Äô rights and to limit the public powers set up by the Administrative Procedure Law, 1989. According to the law in China, a plaintiff refers to an individual, a legal person or other lawful organizations, whose rights have been directly affected by a defendant, viz. a public authority or its employee exercising public powers. This position has, however, experienced reformation and expansion by the Supreme People‚Äôs Court‚Äôs interpretation of law and the introduction of public interest litigation. A plaintiff is now guaranteed the right of access to a court, right to counsel, right to motion for conflict out, etc. These rights are to be exercised lawfully and should comply with the rules and instructions laid down by the courts. Since all the parties are equal before law, a defendant or a third person is guaranteed similar rights and also subject to similar obligations. A few differences, however, exist among them as well. Several Chinese dissidents have invoked administrative law. In 1991, Guo Ruoji, formerly a professor at Nanjing University, sued the Communist Party committee of his university for stripping him of his professorship and banning him from travelling abroad. Both the Nanjing Intermediate Court and the Jiangsu Provincial Supreme People's Court ruled against Guo, on the grounds that acts of the Communist Party of China is not an administrative organ. Several other dissidents filed similar lawsuits against the government and the CPC. In 1993, Yuan Hongbing, a professor at Renmin University in Beijing, sued the university's CPC committee for banning a book he had edited, The Tide of History, which attacked leftist orthodox views. In 1998, Li Weiping, a Wuhan-based dissident, used the administrative law to sue the head of the city's Public Security Bureau for the seizure of his passport.  Administrative reconsideration (review)  Administrative reconsideration offers a number of advantages over litigation under the Administrative Litigation Law. First, administrative reconsideration is free of charge.Administrative Reconsideration Law, Article 39. Second, administrative reconsideration bodies may consider both the legality and appropriateness of administrative decisions.ARL, Article 3(3). Third, Parties may challenge not only the specific act, but in some cases the abstract act on which it is based.ARL, Article 7.  Supervisory organs  In 1986 the Ministry of Supervision was restored, and in 1993 it was merged with the CPC Discipline Committee system. In 1990, the State Council passed the Administrative Supervision Regulations, which were subsequently amended and upgraded to a law in 1997. The ministry and its subordinate bodies function somewhat like ombudsmen in other jurisdictions. Supervisory organs are charged with overseeing government and administrative officials and their appointed personnel. Whereas courts are generally limited to examining the legality of administrative acts, supervision organs may look into the appropriateness of administrative decisions. Supervisory organs may conduct discovery on administrative departments and officials, issue injunctions to cease acts in violation of law or disciplinary rules, temporarily remove or seal evidence, among other powers.

The town is best known for being the birthplace of Benito Mussolini, dictator of Italy from 1922 to 1943. Mussolini is buried at Predappio, and his mausoleum is a local tourist destination, as well as a site of pilgrimage for Fascists. History From its origins (possibly Roman) until the 1920s, Predappio was a rural town of modest size, situated on the hills of Forl√¨. Augustus divided Italy into eleven provinces and Predappio was within the sixth province. It is believed that the town name derives from the installation in those locations of an ancient Roman family: the Appi. The town was accordingly named Praesidium Domini Appi, abbreviated to Pre.DiAppi. Historically the town developed around the medieval castle, looking down the valley. Along the valley, about from Predappio, the town was known as Dovia (probably a corruption of the local Roman road Duo Via, Two-Way).\\"Predappio: a Small Village that Changed Italy Forever\\" by Gabriele Monti, Emilia Delizia, 22 April 2015 Benito Mussolini was born in Predappio in 1883. After a landslide hit the town in the winter of 1923/24 and left many people homeless, the government decided to build a bigger, more prestigious township to celebrate the birthplace of Mussolini, following the architectural dictates of the emerging Fascist regime. Along with the nearby town of Forl√¨, Predappio was given the title of La Citt√† del Duce (\\"the city of the Leader\\").Duce: The title taken by Mussolini as Italian dictator Predappio has become a site of pilgrimage for Italian and other neofascists,\\"Neo-Fascists In Italy Gather For 90th Anniversary Of March On Rome\\" by Marco Pasqua, Huffington Post, 27 October 2012\\"Inside the Mussolini Museum\\" by Barbie Latza Nadeau, The Daily Beast, 26 April 2015 with this development drawing criticism and protests from anti-fascists.An open letter to the Mayor of Predappio by Alfio Bernabei, Searchlight, 14 December 2011 In April 2009, the town council banned the sale of fascist souvenirs.\\"Mussolini's hometown finally bans fascist souvenirs\\" by Nick Squires, The Daily Telegraph, 17 April 2009 In 2014, the then town's mayor Giorgio Frassineti announced plans to build in the town \\"a museum dedicated to the history of fascism\\".\\"History of fascism museum to open in Mussolini‚Äôs town\\" by Nick Clark , The Independent, 25 April 2014 The mayor, then standing for re-election as a member of the centre-left Democratic Party, stated that the aim of the council's decision was to have people remember a ‚Äúfundamental piece of [Italian] history\\" and that, in this way, \\"Predappio would become a place for reflection ‚Äì cutting the town from the hands of those who want to misuse it.\\" As of early 2016, the museum's construction was still pending, but sale of fascist souvenirs was again permitted in the town.\\"Mussolini's Italian hometown plans fascism museum\\" by Pietro Lombardi, CNN, 17 February 2016 On 2019, Roberto Canali backed by the small far-right party, Brothers of Italy was elected as mayor of Predappio, ending the more than 70 years of left-wing rule in Predappio. In 24 July of that year, Mayor Canali announced plans to open Mussolini crypt to the public all year round.

Michael McCabe is an American policy advisor specializing in environmental and energy policy. He had previously served as a Regional Administrator, and later Deputy Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency, being the only person in the Agency's history to serve as both.  Career  McCabe first served as a policy advisor to Gary Hart's successful 1974 Senate campaign. From 1975 to 1976, McCabe served as legislative assistant to the Senator, specializing in environmental and energy policy, including the promotion of energy efficiency and renewable energy. From 1976 to 1979, he also served as Staff Director of the bipartisan Congressional Environmental and Energy Study Conference. In 1980, McCabe organized and directed the national commemoration of the tenth anniversary of Earth Day. From 1981 to 1985, he served as Staff Director of the U.S. House of Representatives Energy Conservation and Power Subcommittee. From 1987 to 1995, McCabe was Senator Joe Biden's Communications and Projects Director serving as senior advisor on Delaware issues. In 1995, McCabe was appointed by President Clinton as the Regional Administrator of the EPA Middle Atlantic Region. As regional administrator, and in cooperation with governors and senior state officials, McCabe directed the implementation of federal environmental programs in the states of Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia. In 1997, he successfully levied a fine of $12.6 million against Smithfield Foods of Virginia for 6,900 violations of the Clean Water Act, after the company was found to have been discharging illegal levels of slaughterhouse waste into Virginia's Pagan River. He was nominated as Deputy Administrator of the EPA by President Clinton in 1999 and appointed to that position in 2000. He left that job on January 31, 2001, after briefly serving as Acting Administrator during the transition to the Administration of President George W. Bush. McCabe's key role in the DuPont corporation's campaign to defend its use of C8 chemicals and minimize their health effects, as a consultant for the company in 2003 following his time as second-in-command at the EPA, is recounted in the recent environmental documentary The Devil We Know. In the fall of 2008, McCabe joined the Obama/Biden presidential transition team as leader of the group charged with identifying top environmental and energy appointments in the new administration. In 2009, McCabe was appointed by the New Jersey Superior Court to oversee the cleanup of 20 contaminated chromium sites located in low-income communities in Hudson County, New Jersey. For six years he served as independent Site Administrator for the Chromium Cleanup Partnership, a cooperative effort between the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, the government of Jersey City, and PPG, responsible for cleanup of toxic waste from a brownfield site where PPG had previously operated a chromium processing facility. His tenure in this position resulted in more than 1,000,000 tons of contaminated soil and waste being safely removed for future development. McCabe is currently the Principal at McCabe & Associates, a private consulting firm addressing energy and environmental policies based in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania. McCabe graduated from Duke University, dual majoring in political science and sociology. He was secretary of the Student Union, and served on the Major Attractions and Major Speakers committees.

It is situated close to Sweden's second largest lake, V√§ttern. The village is famous for its mining industry started by the Belgian company Vieille Montagne in 1857, hence the name Zinkgruvan (literally \\"the zinc mine\\" in English). Zinkgruvan was founded around the mine in the 1860s, and the history of the village is closely tied to the history of the mine. The people living in Zinkgruvan are mostly mine workers. Zinkgruvan also contains several ski facilities, including an illuminated cross country ski track. The ski association in Zinkgruvan uses snow cannons to ensure that the ski-track is provided with snow during the entire winter. An old ice hockey rink in the village is filled with ice in the winter for public entertainment. Zinkgruvan is home to a museum that documents the history of the mining industry in the town.  Geography  In addition to V√§ttern, the area around Zinkgruvan contains several minor lakes. Zinkgruvan, as many small villages in Sweden, is popular with German tourists during the summer. Tourist attractions include the natural surroundings of the town and the elk that live nearby. Selling accessories and souvenirs to tourists is a major source of income for residents of Zinkgruvan. The headframe of the mine, containing the elevators that move miners and ore in the mine shaft, is a major landmark in the village and is well over 70m high. While some residents regard it as a unique feature of the town, it has been criticized for its Soviet-style architecture.

It is also a locality in the Fraser Coast Region local government area. In the , Great Sandy Strait had a population of 4 people. Geography The Great Sandy Strait extends south from Hervey Bay to Inskip Point. The Mary River enters the strait at River Heads. It covers an area of . Tourism and commercial fishing are the two main industries that are active within the Strait. Boating and fishing are also pursued for recreation. Each year in June the Bay to Bay yacht race is sailed on the Great Sandy Strait. There are numerous named and unnamed islands in the strait. The named island are from north to south: Big Woody Island, Round Island, Little Woody Island, Picnic Island, Duck Island, Walsh Island, Turkey Island, Bookar Island, Thomas Island, Slain Island, Tooth Island, Round Bush Island, New Island, Garden Island, Dream Island, and Stewart Island. Most of the island are low and sandy in character. Only a few have significant elevations, e.g. Big Woody Island rises to above sea level.  History  In July and August 1799 Matthew Flinders chartered the coast from Moreton Bay to Hervey Bay in the Norfolk.A Voyage to Terra Australis, with an accompanying Atlas. 2 vol. ‚Äì London : G & W Nicol, 18. July 1814.The Early History of Tasmania, R.W.Giblin 1928 Although he established that Fraser Island was not a peninsula (as was then believed) but an island, he failed to find a navigable channel through the Great Sandy Strait. His explorations of the area is commemorated by a monument called Matthew Flinders Lookout at the top of an escarpment facing the bay in Dayman Park, Urangan (). Lieutenant Joseph Dayman was the first to navigate through the Great Sandy Strait on 10 November 1846 in a small decked boat called the Asp. It had been intended that Dayman rendezvous with HMS Rattlesnake but that ship had already departed. Dayman decided it was safer to take the Asp through the Great Sandy Strait rather than risk taking the route to the ocean side of the Fraser Island as he was concerned about the Breakpoint Spit at the north of Fraser Island. Environment A complex landscape of mangroves, sandbanks, intertidal sand, mud islands, salt marshes and seagrass beds, the Strait is an important habitat for breeding fish, crustaceans, dugongs, dolphins and marine turtles. On Whalesong Cruises, view the migrating humpback whales use the calms waters of the strait to rest for a few days between July and November. An analysis of commercial catch data in the area between 1988 and 2003 revealed a significant reduction in fish stock. The campaign against the Traveston Crossing Dam included claims the dam would have a significant environmental impact on the Great Sandy Strait. It is located within the boundaries of the Great Sandy Marine Park and adjoins other protected areas within or adjacent to the Strait include Great Sandy National Park, Poona National Park and Great Sandy Conservation Park. Birds Great Sandy Strait is an important site for eastern curlews The lower part of Great Sandy Strait was listed under the Ramsar Convention as a wetland of international significance in 1999. The area is also an important roosting site for CAMBA and JAMBA listed species. Some 806 km2 of the strait has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area because it supports about 120,000 non-breeding waders, including over 1% of the global populations of bar-tailed godwits, eastern curlews, great knots, grey-tailed tattlers, lesser sand plovers, pied oystercatchers, red-necked stints and red-capped plovers, as well as small numbers of the range-restricted mangrove honeyeater.

Responsible for conquering large parts of Persia's Caucasus territories during the Russo-Persian War of 1804-1813, from 1802 to 1806 he also served as the Russian Commander-in-chief in the Caucasus. Family and early career Pavel's younger brother Mikhail Tsitsianov was born in the noble Georgian family of Tsitsishvili to Dimitri Pavles dze Tsitsishvili and his wife Elizabeth Bagration-Davitashvili.Rodovid: ·Éû·Éê·Éï·Éö·Éî ·Éì·Éò·Éõ·Éò·É¢·É†·Éò·É° ·É´·Éî ·É™·Éò·É™·Éò·Éê·Éú·Éù·Éï·Éò ·Éì·Éê·Éë. 1754 ·Éí·Éê·É†·Éì. ·Éó·Éî·Éë·Éî·É†·Éï·Éê·Éö·Éò 1806 Retrieved: June 28, 2013 His grandfather, Paata, moved to Russia in the early 1700s as part of a group of Georgian √©migr√©s accompanying the exiled Georgian monarch Vakhtang VI. Tsitsianov had a younger brother, Mikhail Dmitrievich Tsitsianov, a Senator of the Russian Empire. Tsitsianov began his career at the elite Preobrazhensky Regiment of the Imperial Guard (Russia) in 1772. In 1786 he was appointed Colonel of a Grenadier regiment and it was in this capacity that he began his distinguished career during the Russo-Turkish War (1787‚Äì92) under Catherine the Great. In the aforementioned war, he fought at Khotin, on the Salchea River, at Ismail, and Bender. In 1796 the Empress scrambled to belatedly punish Persia for its invasion of Georgia, sending-off Tsitsianov as part of the Persian Expedition of 1796 under the command of Count Valerian Zubov. Following the mixed results of the mission, as well as the death of the Empress and the subsequent disorder associated with the reign of Emperor Paul I, Tsitsianov temporarily retired from service but returned to work after the enthronement of Alexander I. Tsitsianov's rule in Georgia and wars in the Caucasus In 1802 Tsitsianov was appointed the Governor General of newly annexed Georgia, where his rule was characterized by uncompromising policies towards the locals, including the exile of the remaining members of Georgia's formerly ruling dynasty to Russia.P. Longworth, Russia's Empires, John Murray, 2005, p.191. He successfully carried out highly important projects, such as upgrading the Georgian Military Road, and by leading the Russian armies to successes in the early stages of the upcoming 1804-1813 Russo-Iranian war. Tsitsianov's name was commonly pronounced as \\"Sisianov\\" or \\"Zizianov\\" in Persian; however, his title, \\"the Inspector\\", was pronounced as \\"Ispokhdor\\" in Azeri Turkish. Most Iranians referred to him by this title. \\"Ispokhdor\\" literally translates as \\"his work is shit / he whose job is shit\\". As Prof. Stephanie Cronin states, Tsitsianov presided over a new round of brutal military aggression, that triggered the Russo-Persian War of 1804-1813. He had strong negative feelings towards Muslims in general and the \\"Persians\\" in particular, and held in contempt everything related to Iran. A prime example of tactics and attitude were shown in the conquest of Ganja in early 1804. As added by Cronin, Tsitsianov's conquest of Ganja, which reduced the city to rubble and resulted in the murder of its governor, Javad Khan, his son, and many of the city's defenders and civilian population, was no less brutal and murderous than Agha Mohammad Khan's sack of Tiflis in 1795. Though many resented his policies, Tsitsianov's rule brought some of the much needed stability for Georgians, particularly in terms of keeping at bay the previously rampant incursions and marauding by Lezgian mountaineers. When one of his generals was killed in battle with the Lezgians, his rage knew no bounds and wrote an angry letter to the Sultan of Elisu: \\"Shameless sultan with the soul of a Persian - so you still dare to write to me! Yours is the soul of a dog and the understanding of an ass, yet you think to deceive me with your specious phrases. Know that until you become a loyal vassal of my Emperor I shall only long to wash my boots in your blood\\":Baddeley, Russian Conquest of the Caucasus, Chapter IV Under the orders of Emperor Alexander I, he later led the Russian armies into the new Russo-Persian War. In the summer of 1804, he advanced against the Persian forces in Persian Armenia, and fought at Gyumri, Echmiadzin, on the Zang River, and finally Yerevan. His actions earned him the Order of St. Vladimir, 1st Degree. Tsitsianov's fiery character was used as an allegory of Russian Imperial power in Pushkin's romantic poem Captive of the Caucasus Death and related myths In 1806 he rode up to the walls of Baku, with characteristic bravado, to partake in the ceremony of transferring the city to Russian rule after a successful siege. When the general was about to receive the keys to the city, troops loyal to the Khan of Baku unexpectedly shot him and his fellow Georgian aide-de-camp Elisbar Eristov, with Tsitsianov's head and both hands cut off. The third member of the small mission escaped to relate the gruesome tale.P. Longworth, Russia's Empires, John Murray, 2005, p.192. His head was sent to Fat‚Ä≤h-Ali Shah Qajar in Tehran. In relation to this episode, it is noteworthy that in 1806, Mirza Mohammad Akhbari, a teacher of Akhbari school of Fiqh (Islamic Law) in Tehran, allegedly promised Fat‚Ä≤h-Ali Shah Qajar to secure the death of Tsitsianov by supernatural means. Retreating for a period of forty days to the shrine at Shah-Abdol-Azim, he began to engage in certain magical practices, such as beheading wax figures representing Tsitsianov. After the general was in fact assassinated, his severed head (or, according to some accounts, hand) arrived in Tehran just before the forty days were up. Because Fat‚Ä≤h-Ali Shah feared that the supernatural powers of Mirza might be turned against him, he exiled him to Arab Iraq.

In 1936, Recorded Texas Historic Landmark number 1590 was placed on Lindheimer's grave. Biography Early life Ferdinand Jacob Lindheimer was born to merchant Johann Hartmann and Jahnette Magdeline Reisser Lindheimer on May 21, 1801 in Frankfurt, Germany. Lindheimer was educated at the Frankfurt Gymnasium, a Berlin preparatory school, the University of Wiesbaden and the University of Jena. He received a scholarship in Philology at the University of Bonn. Political activism In 1827 Lindheimer became a teacher at the Bunsen Institute in Frankfurt, where he became an active proponent of governmental reform of Germany. He became one of the Dreissiger refugees who left Germany after participation in the failed Frankfurt Putsch insurrection in 1833. In 1834, Lindheimer arrived in Belleville, Illinois, whence he traveled by boat to New Orleans. Texas residency Lindheimer and several companions began traveling to Texas, but were diverted to Mexico where he lived and worked for more than a year. Here he lived in the German colony in Veracruz where he learned about Mexican botany. The german colony in \\"El Mirador\\" was founded by Karl Sartorius near a large Italian colony in Huatusco. He spent over a year here with the German migrants in Mexico learning as much about the bountiful Mexican flora. Late in 1835 he departed Mexico as the Texas Revolution was beginning and was shipwrecked on the coast near Mobile, Alabama. Lindheimer headed to Texas and arrived at the San Jacinto battlefield the day after the final battle of the Texas Revolution. In 1844 he met Prince Carl of Solms- Braunfels, Germany, who was making final arrangements for the settlement of a German colony in Texas, which would be known as New Braunfels, Texas. Lindheimer lived the remainder of his life in New Braunfels, Texas. Meusebach and Hermann Spiess of the Darmstadt Society of Forty chose the location for Bettina in 1847 on the banks of the Llano River. Lindheimer was a botanist residing in this colony. The Fisher‚ÄìMiller Land Grant commune was named in honor of Bettina von Arnim, an early feminist activist and a personal friend of the Meusebach family.King (1967) p.121 Botanist : '''' During the late 1830s and early 1840s, Lindheimer collected botanic specimens in Texas, part of this time for Dr. Asa Gray of Harvard University. Lindheimer persuaded Wilhelm Bruckisch of the Silesian Beekeepers Society to bring black Italian bees to Texas for pollination of the fruit trees in the Guadalupe River valley. Lindheimer collected fifteen hundred species in the south Texas area, over a period of thirteen years. In New Braunfels, Lindheimer began a friendship with fellow botanical enthusiast John O. Meusebach, who appointed him director of a New Braunfels botanical garden.King (1967) p.93 After resigning as Commissioner-General of the Adelsverein, Meusebach moved from New Braunfels to some acreage he had bought at Comanche Springsin Bexar County, believed to be in the vicinity of current-day Camp Bullis.Morgenthaler (2007) p.99 Lindheimer and Meusebach made botanical collections at Comanche Spring, with Lindheimer's 1849 collections bearing the Comanche Spring place tag.King (1967) p.141 After Meusebach retired to Loyal Valley, Lindheimer was a frequent visitor who exchanged botanical specimens for evaluation with Meusebach.King (1967) p.162 Newspaper editor In 1852, Lindheimer was hired as an editor, and along with Adolph Douai, helped found the German- language newspaper known as the Die Neu-Braunfelser Zeitung. Death and legacy The Lindheimer House, New Braunfels, Texas Lindheimer died December 2, 1879 in New Braunfels. He is known as the Father of Texas Botany, with over 20 species and one genus bearing his name. The Lindheimer House in New Braunfels is preserved as a public museum and operated by the New Braunfels Conservation Society. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970.

During the 1930s and 1940s, Altheim served the Nazi state as a member of Ahnenerbe, a think tank controlled by the Schutzstaffel (SS), the paramilitary wing of the Nazi Party, and as a spy for the SS.. Early Life and Education Franz Altheim was born in Frankfurt, Germany on 6 October 1898. His father was the painter Wilhelm Altheim. Altheim's mother left his father due to his heavy drinking and unconventional lifestyle. Depressed as a result, Wilhelm Altheim died by suicide on Christmas 1914. Altheim studied classical philology and history at the University of Frankfurt beginning in 1916. During World War I in 1917, he joined the German Army, first attending a school for translators and then serving as a translator in Turkey. After the war, he tried and failed to become a sculptor before returning to school, supporting himself by working in a bank. Altheim majored in classical philology, archaeology, and linguistics. While in school, he traveled to Italy several times with the aid of government grants to study classical civilization. He earned his PhD at the University of Frankfurt in December 1921. His dissertion, Die Komposition der Politik des Aristoteles, was supervised by Hans von Arnim. Altheim received a scholarship from the Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaft in 1925, and gained his habilitation in 1928 with the thesis Griechische G√∂tter im alten Rom, which was supervised by Walter F. Otto. During this time, Altheim became acquainted with K√°roly Ker√©nyi and Leo Frobenius. Altheim was introduced to the deposed German emperor Wilhelm II, possibly by Frobenius. Wilhelm was then living at Doorn, Netherlands, where Altheim became a frequent visitor. Altheim was also a member of the George-Kreis. Career Altheim worked as a private lecturer at the University of Frankfurt from 1928 to 1935. He supplemented his income as a private art dealer. He initially appeared indifferent to the Nazis, who came to power in 1932. As the Nazis restricted academic freedom, Altheim was increasing criticized by party officials and students and professors supportive of the party for failure to integrate Nazi ideology into his teaching. In 1935, a colleague wrote a letter to the Nazi Ministry of Education attacking Altheim for not incorporating Nazi doctrine into his work. This letter nearly prevented his appointment in 1936 as Associate Professor of Classical Philology at the University of Frankfurt. In the winter of 1936 he briefly served as Acting Chair of Classical Philology at the University of Halle. In 1937, Altheim was Associate Professor of Classical Philology at the University of Halle. A member of the Sturmabteilung, Altheim conducted research projects with Ahnenerbe financing in the 1930s. With his partner Erika Trautmann, Altheim went on research expeditions to Italy, Sweden, Romania and the Middle East, during which he prepared reports for the Sicherheitsdienst . In 1943, Altheim was appointed Professor of Classical Philology at the University of Halle. His research centered on the history classical antiquity, and many of his monographs on this subject were translated into other languages. Altheim was dismissed from the University of Halle after World War II, but was soon reinstated. In 1948 he was appointed Professor of Ancient History at the University of Halle. In 1950, Altheim was appointed Chair of Ancient History at the newly created Free University of Berlin. After retiring in 1964, Altheim moved to M√ºnster, where he died on 17 October 1976. He was survived by Ruth Altheim-Stiehl, his student and adoptive daughter.

All of its shirts, accessories and clothing is made in England.http://turnbullandasser.co.uk/off-the-cuff-the-anatomy-of-our-shirts History Turnbull & Asser was founded in 1885 by John Arthur Turnbull, a hosier and shirtmaker at 3 Church Place, St. James's. Turnbull met Ernest Asser, a salesman, later on in 1893. Together, they opened a hosiery under the name \\"John Arthur Turnbull\\" in St. James's. As the neighborhood was the site of numerous gentlemen's clubs and high-end haberdashers, the business flourished. The name was changed to \\"Turnbull & Asser\\" in 1895. In 1903, after continued success, Turnbull & Asser moved to its present location at the corner of Jermyn Street and Bury Street. In 1915, during World War I, Turnbull & Asser developed a raincoat which doubled as a sleeping bag for the British Military. It is known as the Oilsilk Combination Coverall & Ground Sheet. During the 1920s, as dress became less formal, men's dress shirts became more noticeable articles of clothing. Turnbull & Asser responded by focusing its business more on shirtmaking, for which it is most known today. Between the 1920s and the 1970s, Turnbull & Asser grew its London business from a haberdashery to a clothier, expanding into sportswear, clothing (both bespoke and ready-to-wear), and ready-to-wear shirts. As its symbol, it used a hunting horn with a \\"Q\\" above, which it called the Quorn, a name it shares with one of the oldest hunts in England. Many of Turnbull & Asser's articles were called by this name, such as the popular \\"Quorn scarf\\". During the 1960s, Turnbull & Asser even had been known for catering to the Swinging London set, with vibrant colors and modern designs. In 1962, Turnbull & Asser began to outfit the cinematic James Bond as first portrayed by Sir Sean Connery, whose dress shirts had turnback cuffs fastened with buttons as opposed to cufflinks, referred to as cocktail cuffs, or James Bond cuffs. In the 1970s and 1980s, Turnbull & Asser began reviving some of the more traditional aspects of its business. The company found that Americans increasingly were buying its wares, so it began offering trunk shows at the Grand Hyatt in New York City. Beginning in 1974, Turnbull & Asser sold ready-to-wear shirts in the United States through department stores Bonwit Teller and Neiman Marcus. For a brief period beginning in 1979, Turnbull & Asser even operated a small store in Toronto opened by Tony Carlisle and Kenneth Williams. Royal Warrant Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales, has bought shirts from Turnbull & Asser since his youth. When, in 1980, the Prince was granted the power of bestowing royal warrants, his first issue was granted to Turnbull & Asser. He also wears Turnbull & Asser suits, made by the former Chester Barrie factory in Crewe, Cheshire. Following the retirement of Paul Cuss, the Royal Warrant was passed down to Steven Quin, who currently heads the bespoke department in Bury Street. Today Turnbull & Asser prides itself on its made in England mantra, with shirts and ties still made in its Gloucester and Kent factories. In addition to its locations, the heralded shirtmaker hosts seasonal bespoke shirt trunkshows in key cities around the world including Los Angeles, Chicago, Toronto, Mumbai, Seoul, Tokyo, Singapore, Hong Kong and more. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Turnbull & Asser dedicated its Gloucester workroom to making medical-grade scrubs for National Health Service personnel.

Best known internationally for his performances and choreography in Riverdance and Dancing on Dangerous Ground, he transitioned to contemporary dance after earning an MA in that style as an artist-in-residence at the University of Limerick in 2002. In 2007, he was nominated for a UK Critics Circle National Dance Award (best male: modern dance) for performances at The Barbican in Fabulous Beast's production of The Bull. His first solo show, Out of Time, premiered in 2008. Early life Dunne was born in Birmingham, England, to Irish parents. He followed his two older sisters to Irish dance class at the local school, Birmingham's Comerford School, when he was just three years old. At the age of nine, he won his first World Championship title and was the first dancer to win the World, All England and All Ireland titles in the same year. From the age of 12, he was taught by Marion Turley in Coventry and when he retired from competition at the age of 22, he had won a total of nine World, eleven Great Britain, nine All Ireland and eight All England titles. At the age of 19, he was the youngest person ever to receive an Irish Post Award in recognition of his achievements in Irish dance. Dunne graduated from Warwick University in 1989 with a BSc in Economics before going on to work as a trainee accountant at the Birmingham offices of Arthur Andersen. Around the same time, he passed his dance teachers exam (T.C.RG) and was teaching successfully with Marion Turley in Coventry and giving workshops in the United States, Australia and New Zealand. He resigned from Arthur Andersen on the day he qualified as a Chartered Accountant to go on a month long tour of Canada with The Chieftains. Irish dance career Between 1992 and 1995, Dunne toured regularly with musical groups The Chieftains and DeDannan. The former saw him begin a dance partnership with Jean Butler. The latter led to a memorable performance with Frankie Gavin and St√©phane Grappelli at Belfast's Ulster Hall, and then to a collaboration with American tap dancer Tarik Winston for the Irish Society St. Patrick's Day Ball in New York City in 1995. Six months later, Dunne would find himself working with both Butler and Winston in Riverdance. Dunne joined the cast and creative team of Riverdance in October 1995. He was initially invited to choreograph and perform the newly commissioned number Trading Taps with Tarik Winston. However, with the departure of original male lead and choreographer Michael Flatley the day before the re-opening of the show at The Apollo in London, he found himself taking over the principal role at short notice. He toured with the production for three years, taking the show to its USA premieres in New York (Radio City Music Hall) and Los Angeles (Pantages Theatre), and also to Australia. His performances were recorded for the Riverdance: Live From New York City (1996) DVD. Further choreography credits for the production followed; Firedance (with Mar√≠a Pag√©s), Heartbeat of the World (with Mar√≠a Pag√©s) and Heartland Duet (with Jean Butler). Special TV appearances during these years include The Royal Variety Show (The Dominion London), The Kennedy Honours (Kennedy Centre Washington D.C.), and The Grammy Awards (including a duet with Savion Glover) at Madison Square Garden, New York. In June 1998, Dunne left Riverdance to begin work on a new project with Jean Butler. In 2013, Dunne said, \\"I did over 900 performances. I left Riverdance because when you perform something 900 times in front of 3,000 or 4,000 people every night, I think a little piece of you dies off with every performance.\\" The new project, Dancing on Dangerous Ground, was based on the myth of Diarmuid Agus Grainne, and was produced by Harvey Goldsmith and Radio City Music Hall. The show received its World Premiere at The Theatre Royal Drury Lane in London in December 1999 and went on to perform to full capacity at Radio City Music Hall in March 2000. Although the show received critical acclaim in New York, it had failed to capture the imagination of audiences and critics in London. It closed in June 2000. Crossover to contemporary dance After an eighteen- month period living in New York, Dunne returned to Ireland in 2001 to take a position as dancer-in-residence at the University of Limerick at the invitation of Micheal O'Suilleabhain. In that year, he took the Masters in Contemporary Dance Performance. He began focusing on the creation of short solo works, and presented these solos at the Vail International Dance Festival in Colorado; Jubilee Auditorium in the Canadian city of Edmonton; and the Queen Elizabeth Hall in London. As part of his final MA, he choreographed \\"Headfoot\\" for the Daghdha Dance/Yoshiko Chuma production of 10,000 Steps which closed the first Dublin International Dance Festival in May 2002. After finishing his Masters in 2002, Dunne sought collaborations with contemporary choreographers in parallel with his own solo creative work. In 2003, he worked again with Yoshiko Chuma in the Daghdha production of The Yellow Room. In 2005, he joined Michael Keegan Dolan's Fabulous Beast Dance Theatre for their production, The Bull. His performances in The Bull at The Barbican in 2007 earned him a nomination for a UK Critics Circle National Dance Awards (best male: modern dance). Other work during this period included choreography for The Abbey Theatre (The Shaughraun 2004), and performances with the Irish Chamber Orchestra (Tour of Ireland 2004 and Carnegie Hall 2005). In January 2008, Dunne's first full-length solo show, Out of Time, premiered at Gl√≥r Irish Music Centre. The show displayed a love-hate relationship with the dance that made him famous. As of May 2016, his show was still touring the United States. In September 2016, Dunne's new collaborative show, \\"Edges of Light\\", began touring Ireland. In June 2017, \\"Edges of Light\\" premiered in New York. The show continued to tour as of July 2018. In 2018, Dunne won a TG4 Gradam Ceoil award for Musical Collaboration as part of the production \\"Concert\\".

Gregorio is a graduate of the University of the Philippines with the degree of Bachelor of Arts in Communication, Major in Film and Audio-Visual Communication (Batch 1994). On August 24, 2018, the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas appointed him as the Special Assistant to the President. Career Prior to his head coaching chores with Purefoods, Ryan Gregorio was an assistant coach and video coordinator of Eric Altamirano with Purefoods in 1997. However, in 2002, dressed as an assistant coach for the Philippine National Basketball Team, and Gregorio was named as the interim coach of the TJ Hotdogs. Under Gregorio's hands, Purefoods won the 2002 Governor's Cup with a 4-3 series victory over the Alaska Aces. The team was led by imports Derrick Brown, Kelvin Price and Best Player of the Conference winner Rey Evangelista. Gregorio coached the team to a dismal performance in the Commissioner's Cup before Altamirano regained coaching duties in the All-Filipino Cup. Despite this, Gregorio was rewarded, along with then-Coca-Cola Tigers mentor Chot Reyes as co-winner of the PBA Press Corps Coach of the Year Award. In 2003, Gregorio became the full-time head coach of Purefoods, after Altamirano was tasked to head the San Miguel All-Stars team. 2004-05 Re-Building the Giants In the 2004-05 season, Gregorio coached the Purefoods team, retooled with amateur stars James Yap, Paul Artadi, Peter June Simon and the vastly improved Kerby Raymundo. Purefoods would have losing records in the 2004 Fiesta Conference. The team marginally improved to finish two quarterfinals' stints in the Philippine Cup and the 2005 Fiesta Conference. 2005-06 Championship Run The 2005-06 PBA season would be Gregorio's finest season yet, he would lead the Purefoods Chunkee Giants to two finals appearances, a runner-up finish in the 2005-06 Fiesta Conference, and a championship against Red Bull in the Philippine Cup Finals, winning in 6 games, 4-2. Prior to the finals meeting with Red Bull, he would bring his team back to life after being down 1 - 3 in the Semi-Finals vs. Alaska. The series victory vs. Alaska would be remembered as one of the best comebacks in the PBA history. He once again coached his team to its second championship in the last four years. The 2006 success earned him his second Coach of the Year Award 2007-08 All-Filipino Finals Appearance Gregorio started the 2007-2008 season with a bang. He led his team to a 5-game sweep of the pre-tournament games and would eventually bag the Pre-Tournament Championship. He would continue his mastery of the All- Filipino Conference as he led his team to a 7-0 start and finished with 12 wins and 6 losses, enough to push the team to the Semi-Finals. He would lead his team to another trip to the Finals, his third. However, his team would eventually lose to Sta. Lucia in 7 games via a controversial series. 2008-09 Skid The 2008-09 PBA season became one of Gregorio's worst seasons. Starting center Rommel Adducul was diagnosed with throat cancer and forced Purefoods TJ Giants to trade key player Marc Pingris to San Miguel Beermen for big man Enrico Villanueva. This signaled a major revamp with Gregorio's team lineup and a losing season finishing with only 15 in 32 elimination round games. He only managed to stir his team through the wildcard in both conferences. His team would end both tournaments in controversies, a bottle-throwing incident between his player James Yap against assistant coach Koy Banal and the benching of reinforcement Marquin Chandler on separate do-or-die games the TJ Giants consequently lost. 2009-10: Farewell Season with Purefoods Franchise  Gregorio guided his team in the 2009-10 PBA season to a record 41 wins. James Yap would earn his 2nd season MVP award. With the return of old reliables Marc Pingris, Paul Artadi together with veteran center Rafi Reavis, and rookie standout Rico Maierhofer, his team would finish as champions in the 2009‚Äì10 PBA Philippine Cup Finals defeating the Alaska Aces 4 - 0. The sweep is the first time in the history of the All-Filipino Conference This however marked the end of Gregorio's era as Llamados coach with his transfer to Meralco Bolts. He would eventually become the franchise's winningest and longest-tenured head coach with 3 championships in 8 seasons as Purefoods/B-Meg coach. Timeline with Purefoods: 1997 - Champion - All-Filipino Cup (Assistant Coach) 1997 - Runner-Up - Governor's Cup (Assistant Coach) 2002 - Champion - All-Filipino Cup (Interim Head Coach) 2006 - Runner-Up - Fiesta Conference (Head Coach) 2006 - Champion - All-Filipino Cup (Head Coach) 2008 - Runner-Up - All-Filipino Cup (Head Coach) 2010 - Champion - All-Filipino Cup (Head Coach) Gregorio was succeeded by his assistant and multi-titled Philippine Basketball League coach Jorge Gallent 2010-2014: Meralco Bolts Head Coach In August 2010, Gregorio left B-Meg Derby Ace Llamados and signed a coaching deal with the Philippine Basketball Association returnee Manila Electric Company (Meralco Bolts). He is also concurrently part of Meralco‚Äôs corporate staff as Assistant Vice President and Head of Meralco Sports and Youth Advocacy. His five years coaching stint with the Bolts would proved to be dismal as he was unsuccessful to lead Meralco beyond the quarterfinals. Assortment of injuries to key players, and trades that hurt the team's chemistry contributed to the Bolts downfall. On July 2014, Gregorio declined the offer to return as head coach. Instead, he opted to concentrate on his corporate affairs role with Meralco. 4 -Time PBA All- Star Coach 2006 - Head Coach North All-Stars (Won) ; Laoag City 2008 - Head Coach North All-Stars (Lost) ; Bacolod City 2010 - Head Coach North All-Stars (Won) ; Puerto Princesa City 2012 - Head Coach Veterans (Won) ; Laoag City 3 - Time PBA Coach of the Year 2002 - Co-Winner (PBA Press Corps Coach of the Year) with Chot Reyes 2006 - Winner (PBA Press Corps Coach of the Year) 2010 - Winner (PBA Press Corps Coach of the Year) Personal life Gregorio is married to Jin Salgado-Gregorio and has two children.

The son of a London butcher, Orton went to sea as a boy, spent a year in Chile, and worked as a butcher and stockman for squatters in Australia in the middle-to- late 1850s. In 1866 Thomas Castro, a butcher from Wagga Wagga in Australia, claimed to be Roger Tichborne, the heir to the Tichborne estates and baronetcy who had been declared lost at sea in 1854. During the protracted court proceedings that followed Castro's claim, evidence was produced that Castro might in fact be Arthur Orton, attempting to secure the Tichborne fortunes by imposture. The verdict of the jury in Regina versus Castro (1873‚Äì74) was that Castro was not Roger Tichborne, and that he was Arthur Orton. He was sentenced to fourteen years imprisonment for perjury. After his release he lived in great poverty, still insisting that he was Tichborne. In 1895 he confessed to being Orton, but retracted almost immediately. He died in 1898; the Tichborne family allowed a coffin plate bearing the names \\"Sir Roger Charles Doughty Tichborne\\" to be placed on the coffin, not because his claim had been conceded, but because \\"No legal means of preventing such an outrage existed\\". Commentators have generally concurred with the court's verdict that the Claimant was Orton, but some 20th-century analysts have raised uncertainties about this accepted view, and have suggested that although the Orton identity remains the most likely, a lingering doubt remains. Biography Orton was born at Wapping, London, the son of George Orton, a butcher and purveyor of ships' stores. Michael Roe, 'Orton, Arthur (1834‚Äì1898)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, Vol.. 5, Melbourne University Press, 1974, p. 374. Retrieved 2009-11-02 He left school early and was employed in his father's shop. In 1849, he was apprenticed to a Captain Brooks of the ship Ocean. The ship sailed to South America and in June 1849 Orton deserted and went to the small Chilean country town of Melipilla. He stayed in Chile for a year and seven months and befriended the Castro family. Orton then went back to London as an ordinary seaman. In November 1852 he sailed for Tasmania aboard the Middleton and arrived at Hobart in May 1853. There, Orton worked for several butchers. There is some evidence he was a heavy drinker; and for minor trade malpractices, he appeared before magistrates. The Hobart Mercury of 1 Aug 1855 reports on the case of 'Fane v. Orton' in the Mayor's Court in which the City Surveyor brought a charge of 'offering for sale...unwholesome meat, unfit for human food' against 'Arthur Orton, butcher, Macquarie-street' to which Orton pleaded guilty. In October 1855, Orton appeared on a charge of obtaining money under false pretences brought by Frederick Dight, after Orton had been a witness against Dight in an earlier Supreme Court trial, but the case was dismissed. Contemporary view of Port Albert, Gippsland. Arthur Orton landed there as a passenger on the schooner 'Eclipse' after leaving Tasmania for mainland Australia in 1855. From 1855 to the mid-1860s there is little detail about his life, but he appears to have pursued gold prospecting, mail-running and pastoral station hand-work, with a suggestion of bushranging and even murder. Orton left Hobart as a passenger on schooner 'Eclipse' on 16 November 1855 bound for Port Albert on the coast of Gippsland, Victoria. He worked for some time on squatters 'runs' in the district. While employed at one he was said to have written 'on a fly-leaf of one of the station novels' and this was later offered as evidence that Orton did not have the education that would have been expected of Tichborne: > \\"This day i have received a letter from Donald MacDonald. With the Seal > Broken. i Arthur Orton here make a vow on this Book. Although not a Bible. > It bear a cross, That i am a man of Bone Blood and flesh. That i will find > out the Man if Possible. That broke the said Seal. And that i will punish > him according to the laws of, My Countrie. > Sined Arthur Orton > Dargo > 11 March 1858\\" In May 1856, he appears in a subscription list, donating ¬£2, for 'the Patriotic Fund from the Upper District of Gippsland' as a stockman and 'one of the men' of 'Mewburn Park'. In April 1859, a letter to the editor of the 'Gippsland Guardian' mentions Orton, 'who was in charge of the Dargo station', and recounts Orton's testimony in relation to 'the mysterious disappearance of William Henry Clare alias Ballaarat Harry, and Thomas Took'. Orton's letters to England while he was in Hobart showed he was fond of dogs and children and affectionate towards his girlfriend in Wapping. However a personal notice in a Hobart newspaper from May 1856 ‚Äì 'If this should meet the eye of Arthur Orton, formerly of 69, Wapping, London, by applying on board the \\"Irene\\", he will hear of his friends.' ‚Äì after he had departed for Victoria raises the question of when the correspondence may have ended. Tichborne Claimant In August 1865 advertisements appeared in Australian newspapers asking for information about the fate of Roger Charles Tichborne (born 1829), who had been on a vessel Bella which disappeared at sea off South America in 1854. This advertisement had been inserted by Lady Tichborne, the missing man's mother, who believed her son was still alive. Roger Tichborne had, however, been presumed dead by the courts and his younger brother had thus succeeded to the Tichborne baronetcy and the family's estates. In 1866, through his solicitor William Gibbes, a butcher in Wagga Wagga known as \\"Thomas Castro\\" came forward, claiming to be the missing Sir Roger. He appeared to have some knowledge of the missing man's background and family history, although many of his assertions were inaccurate or false. However, at Gibbes's prompting he wrote to Lady Tichborne and was invited to come to England to be recognised.McWilliam 2007, pp. 14‚Äì15 Whilst living in England, he stayed at 'Essex Lodge', Thornton Heath, with Lady Tichborne. According to author Bernard Falk, her religious sensibilities were offended by the great usage he and his invited guests made of alcohol and tobacco, so she moved out. It is the contention of most historians that the Claimant was Arthur Orton, whose travels had at some time crossed the path of Roger Tichborne, whose identify Orton had then adopted.McWilliam 2007, p. 277 Recognition, doubt and legal process Vanity Fair by Ape' June 1871 The Scotland Yard detective Jack Whicher discovered that immediately on his arrival in England in December 1866 the Claimant visited Wapping and made enquiries about the Orton family.Greenwood, James 'Low-Life Deeps: An Account of the Strange Fish to be Found There' ‚Äì Chatto and Windus, Piccadilly (1881) ‚Äì The Dictionary of Victorian London'The Tichborne Trial' Nelson Examiner and New Zealand Chronicle, R≈çrahi XXXII, Putanga 96, 21 Hereturik≈çkƒÅ 1873, Page 3 National Library of New Zealand Archive When this visit was made public during the legal processes, it was presented as strong evidence that the Claimant was indeed Arthur Orton.McWilliam 2007, pp. 18‚Äì19 However, Lady Tichborne recognised him as her son with complete certainty;McWilliam 2007, p. 23 he was likewise accepted as Roger by numerous family servants and professional advisers.Woodruff, p. 66 In his analysis of the affair, Rohan McWilliam considers the extent of recognition remarkable, given the physical bulk and unrefined manners of the Claimant, as compared with the Roger Tichborne of 1854.McWilliam, pp. 25‚Äì26 Almost all the rest of the Tichborne family considered the Claimant an imposter. Nevertheless, he obtained much financial support for the prosecution of his claim, which went ahead despite the death of Lady Tichborne in 1868. After a lengthy civil hearing the jury dismissed the Claimant's case to be Sir Roger; he was then arrested and tried for perjury under the name of Thomas Castro. In the trial that followed the jury declared that he was not Roger Tichborne and identified him on the evidence as Arthur Orton. He was sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment, of which he served 10 before his release on licence in 1884. Appraisal After his release the Claimant continued to press his claim, but gradually lost his following. By the mid-1890s he was impoverished; in 1895, for a fee of several hundred pounds, he published a confession in The People that he was Orton. However, almost immediately he repudiated this confession, and styled himself once again as Sir Roger Tichborne. He died on 1 April 1898 in impoverished circumstances, and was given a pauper's burial. In \\"an act of extraordinary generosity\\", the Tichborne family allowed a card bearing the name \\"Sir Roger Charles Doughty Tichborne\\" to be placed on the coffin before its interment.McWilliam 2007, p. 273 This \\"generosity\\" is disputed by author Bernard Falk, who stated that \\"No legal means existed to prevent\\" a named coffin plate claiming the Baronet's title being attached. The modern consensus is that the Claimant was Orton, who had used family information obtained from gullible or self-serving supporters. However, in his 1957 account of the case, Douglas Woodruff insists that at least some degree of doubt as to the Claimant's true identity must remain. Woodruff argues the sheer improbability of anyone conceiving such an imposture from scratch and at such a distance: \\"[I]t was carrying effrontery beyond the bounds of sanity if Arthur Orton embarked with a wife and retinue and crossed the world, knowing that they would all be destitute if he did not succeed in convincing a woman he had never met and knew nothing about first-hand, that he was her son\\".Woodruff, pp. 452‚Äì53 Orton's cause continued to be upheld during the 20th century by his eldest daughter, one of four children borne him by his wife, who lived until 1926. In popular culture He was fictionalized by Jorge Luis Borges in Tom Castro, The Implausible Impostor, written between 1933 and 1934 and published in A Universal History of Iniquity in 1935.

The operation involved a successful counterattack against a July 1988 military incursion from Iraq, by a military force of about 7,000 members of the Mujahadeen-e-Khalq (MEK). The MEK soldiers were armed, equipped and given air support by Iraq. Led by Lt. General Ali Sayad Shirazi, Operation Mersad began on 26 July 1988 and lasted only a few days, where the Iranian Armed Forces crushed the MEK in what was the last military operation of any significance of the war. Both Iran and Iraq had accepted United Nations Security Council Resolution 598, which would end the war on 8 August 1988. The Iraqi-supported Mujahedeen-e-Khalq militant group saw an opportunity to attack central Iran, before the deal came into effect. The attack was decisively defeated by the Iranian military.  Prelude  On 20 July 1987 the Iran‚ÄìIraq War was coming to an end under the United Nations Security Council Resolution 598. Iran had suffered major defeats in southern Iraq during the Second Battle of Al Faw and Operation Tawakalna ala Allah as well as along the central portion of the border within Iran, and was contemplating on accepting the ceasefire. On July 26 1988, six days after Ayatollah Khomeini had officially announced his acceptance of the UN brokered ceasefire resolution as well as seeing Iraqi victories in the previous months, the MEK advanced under heavy Iraqi air cover, crossing the Iranian border from Iraq. It advanced to a maximum distance of 145 km(90 mi) and along the way seized and razed to the ground the Iranian town of Eslamabad-e Gharb. As it advanced further into Iran, Iraq ceased its air support and Iranian forces cut off NLA (National Liberation Army of Iran i.e. MEK forces) supply lines and counterattacked under cover of fighter planes and helicopter gunships. The attack agreed upon by the Iraqi leadership would be a two pronged assault. One portion of the MEK force would attack Iranian forces in Iraqi Kurdistan, the area was still in Iranian and Peshmerga hands. When the Iranian troops moved to fight off the MEK attack in Kurdistan, the renegade Iranian militant group the Mujahedeen-e-Khalq (MEK), supported by Iraqi air power, would launch a large scale incursion into the central portion of Iran, aiming towards the heart of Iran. The MEK under their leader Massoud Rajavi harbored the hope that the attack would lead to a general uprising against the Islamic government of Ayatollah Khomeini. Rajavi would lead the Mujahedeen with Iraqi support in an attack on the western borders of Iran.Hiro, Dilip, The Longest War, (1999), pp. 246‚Äì47 Operation Forough Javidan (Eternal Light)  On 26 July 1988, the MEK, with the support of the Iraqi military, started Operation Forough Javidan (Eternal Light) in central Iran. The Mujahedeen worked with the Iraqi Air Force, advancing towards the Iranian city of Kermanshah and advanced rapidly, seizing and destroying the towns of Qasr-e Shirin, Sarpol-e Zahab, Kerend-e Gharb, and Islamabad-e Gharb. The MEK met scant resistance from the limited numbers of Revolutionary Guards, which were promptly defeated, pushing 145 km (90 mi) deep into Iran towards the provincial capital city of Kermanshah and the road to Tehran seemed to be wide open. Iran's Kurdish fighters did somewhat slow the advance, allowing time for the Iranians to prepare their counteroffensive. Once the MEK had advanced beyond the range of effective Iraqi air cover, giving the Iranians air superiority, the Iranian military launched its counter-attack, Operation Mersad, under Lieutenant General Ali Sayyad Shirazi. Iranian paratroopers landed behind the overstretched MEK lines. Iranian Air Force F-4 Phantoms bombed Mujahedeen convoys on the Kermanshah highway, followed by Army Aviation helicopters using anti-tank missiles. Most enemy armour was destroyed, in a miniature version of the Highway of Death during the Persian Gulf War. The MEK advance had been abruptly and completely halted. The Iranian army and Revolutionary Guard then moved north from Khuzestan, encircling and suppressing the remaining resistance in the city of Kerend-e Gharb on 29 July 1988. On 31 July, Iran drove MEK forces out of Qasr-e-Shirin and Sarpol Zahab, though the MEK claimed to have \\"voluntarily withdrawn\\" from the towns. Iran estimated that 4,500 Mujahedeen soldiers were killed, while 400 Iranian soldiers died. The Iranian successes during Operation Mersad were partially due to their decision to establish a unified command structure and permanently quash the differences between the Army and the Revolutionary Guard.  Aftermath  Mujahedeen members killed in Operation Mersad by Pasdaran in Kermanshah at 1988 Under pressure from other Arab states Saddam and MEK did not launch any more attacks on Iran. Operation Mersad was the last land battle of the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. The last notable combat actions of the war took place on 3 August 1988, in the Persian Gulf when the Iranian navy fired on a freighter and Iraq launched chemical attacks on Iranian civilians, killing an unknown number of them and wounding 2,300. Both sides eventually withdrew to the international border in the coming weeks, with Resolution 598 becoming effective on 8 August 1988, ending all combat operations between the two countries.[102] By 20 August 1988, peace with Iran was restored. UN peacekeepers belonging to the UNIIMOG mission took the field, remaining on the Iran‚ÄìIraq border until 1991. While the war was now over, Iraq spent the rest of August and early September clearing the Kurdish resistance. Using 60,000 troops along with helicopter gunships, chemical weapons (poison gas), and mass executions, Iraq hit 15 villages, killing rebels and civilians, and forced tens of thousands of Kurds to relocate to forced settlements.[99] Many Kurdish civilians immigrated to Iran. By 3 September 1988, the anti-Kurd campaign ended, and all resistance had been crushed.[99] 400 Iraqi soldiers and 50,000 Kurdish civilians and soldiers had been killed. At least in part as a response to the invasion, Iran executed several thousand political prisoners across the country for treason, mainly members of the MEK, but also members of the Tudeh Party (Communist Party) and other opposition groups.Iranian party demands end to repression The estimates for number of executions vary from as little as 1,400Massacre 1988 (Pdf) to as high as 12,000. The most likely number was given by dissident Ayatollah Hussein-Ali Montazeri, as being between 3,800‚Äì4,500. The death toll may have been higher for those MEK executed by frontline court-martials or dying in prison.

Uichico is a former Philippine national team Youth member and a former player and head coach of the La Salle Green Archers in the UAAP before replacing Ron Jacobs as SMB coach in 1999. Uichico was coach of the San Miguel Beermen from 1999‚Äì2006, leading the Beermen to six PBA championships. Basketball career Uichico played for the La Salle Green Archers in the collegiate ranks. He was a member of the 1982 RP Youth Team that won the ABC Under-18 Championship. After a stint with the famed Northern Consolidated Cement squad of Ron Jacobs, Uichico ended his basketball career early. Coaching career In the mid-1990s, Uichico had a coaching stint with the Green Archers and guided them to two runner-up trophies. He also joined the Magnolia Beverage Masters coaching staff during Norman Black and Jacobs tenure. In 1999, Uichico became the new head coach of the Beermen after Jacobs' departure. After an early elimination in the All-Filipino Cup, he coached the Beermen to the Commissioner and Governors Cup titles during the 1999 campaign, ending San Miguel's five-year title drought. He is also the first rookie coach to lead his team to back-to-back titles in the same year, a feat duplicated by Siot Tanquingcen in 2005. In 2000, Uichico once again guided San Miguel to two more titles and laid claim to his first and only Coach of the Year plum. His first All-Filipino Cup title with the Beermen came in 2001, defeating sister team Barangay Ginebra Kings. Ron Jacobs appointed Uichico as one of his assistants for the RP team's 2002 Asian Games campaign. However, after Jacobs suffered a stroke, Uichico was named as the new head coach of the national squad. Uichico guided the Philippines to a fourth-place finish in the event. Their semifinal loss against eventual tournament winner South Korea was a crushing blow for Uichico's squad losing by one point on a Lee Sang Min triple in the final seconds.

GLUT1 facilitates the transport of glucose across the plasma membranes of mammalian cells. This gene encodes a major glucose transporter in the mammalian blood-brain barrier. The encoded protein is found primarily in the cell membrane and on the cell surface, where it can also function as a receptor for human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) I and II. One good source of GLUT1 is erythrocyte membranes. GLUT1 accounts for 2 percent of the protein in the plasma membrane of erythrocytes. GLUT1, found in the plasma membrane of erythrocytes, is a classic example of a uniporter. After glucose is transported into the erythrocyte, it is rapidly phosphorylated, forming glucose-6-phosphate, which cannot leave the cell. Mutations in this gene can cause GLUT1 deficiency syndrome 1, GLUT1 deficiency syndrome 2, idiopathic generalized epilepsy 12, dystonia 9, and stomatin- deficient cryohydrocytosis.  Discovery  GLUT1 was the first glucose transporter to be characterized. GLUT 1 is highly conserved. GLUT 1 of humans and mice have 98% identity at the amino acid level. GLUT 1 is encoded by the SLC2 gene and is one of a family of 14 genes encoding GLUT proteins.  Structure  The SLC2A1 gene is located on the p arm of chromosome 1 in position 34.2 and has 10 exons spanning 33,802 base pairs. The gene produces a 54.1 kDa protein composed of 492 amino acids.Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man, OMIM¬Æ. Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD. MIM Number: {138140}: {08/21/2017}: . World Wide Web URL: https://omim.org/ It is a multi-pass protein located in the cell membrane. This protein lacks a signal sequence; its C-terminus, N-terminus, and the very hydrophilic domain in the protein's center are all predicted to lie on the cytoplasmic side of the cell membrane. GLUT1 behaves as a Michaelis‚ÄìMenten enzyme and contains 12 membrane-spanning alpha helices, each containing 20 amino acid residues. A helical wheel analysis shows that the membrane-spanning alpha-helices are amphipathic, with one side being polar and the other side hydrophobic. Six of these membrane- spanning helices are believed to bind together in the membrane to create a polar channel in the center through which glucose can traverse, with the hydrophobic regions on the outside of the channel adjacent to the fatty acid tails of the membrane.  Function  Energy-yielding metabolism in erythrocytes depends on a constant supply of glucose from the blood plasma, where the glucose concentration is maintained at about 5mM. Glucose enters the erythrocyte by facilitated diffusion via a specific glucose transporter, at a rate of about 50,000 times greater than uncatalyzed transmembrane diffusion. The glucose transporter of erythrocytes (called GLUT1 to distinguish it from related glucose transporters in other tissues) is a type III integral protein with 12 hydrophobic segments, each of which is believed to form a membrane- spanning helix. The detailed structure of GLUT1 is not known yet, but one plausible model suggests that the side-by-side assembly of several helices produces a transmembrane channel lined with hydrophilic residues that can hydrogen-bond with glucose as it moves through the channel. GLUT1 is responsible for the low level of basal glucose uptake required to sustain respiration in all cells. Expression levels of GLUT1 in cell membranes are increased by reduced glucose levels and decreased by increased glucose levels. GLUT1 is also a major receptor for uptake of Vitamin C as well as glucose, especially in non vitamin C producing mammals as part of an adaptation to compensate by participating in a Vitamin C recycling process. In mammals that do produce Vitamin C, GLUT4 is often expressed instead of GLUT1.  Tissue distribution  GLUT1 expression occurs in almost all tissues, with the degree of expression typically correlating with the rate of cellular glucose metabolism. In the adult it is expressed at highest levels in erythrocytes and also in the endothelial cells of barrier tissues such as the blood‚Äìbrain barrier.  Clinical significance  Mutations in the GLUT1 gene are responsible for GLUT1 deficiency or De Vivo disease, which is a rare autosomal dominant disorder. This disease is characterized by a low cerebrospinal fluid glucose concentration (hypoglycorrhachia), a type of neuroglycopenia, which results from impaired glucose transport across the blood‚Äìbrain barrier.  GLUT1 Deficiency Syndrome 1  Many mutations in the SLC2A1 gene, including LYS456TER, TYR449TER, LYS256VAL, ARG126HIS, ARG126LEU and GLY91ASP, have been shown to cause GLUT1 deficiency syndrome 1 (GLUT1DS1), a neurologic disorder showing wide phenotypic variability. This disease can be inherited in either an autosomal recessive or autosomal dominant manner. The most severe 'classic' phenotype comprises infantile-onset epileptic encephalopathy associated with delayed development, acquired microcephaly, motor incoordination, and spasticity. Onset of seizures, usually characterized by apneic episodes, staring spells, and episodic eye movements, occurs within the first 4 months of life. Other paroxysmal findings include intermittent ataxia, confusion, lethargy, sleep disturbance, and headache. Varying degrees of cognitive impairment can occur, ranging from learning disabilities to severe mental retardation.  GLUT1 Deficiency Syndrome 2  Other mutations, like GLY314SER, ALA275THR, ASN34ILE, SER95ILE, ARG93TRP, ARG91TRP, a 3-bp insertion (TYR292) and a 12-bp deletion (1022_1033del) in exon 6, have been shown to cause GLUT1 deficiency syndrome 2 (GLUT1DS2), a clinically variable disorder characterized primarily by onset in childhood of paroxysmal exercise-induced dyskinesia. The dyskinesia involves transient abnormal involuntary movements, such as dystonia and choreoathetosis, induced by exercise or exertion, and affecting the exercised limbs. Some patients may also have epilepsy, most commonly childhood absence epilepsy. Mild mental retardation may also occur. In some patients involuntary exertion-induced dystonic, choreoathetotic, and ballistic movements may be associated with macrocytic hemolytic anemia. Inheritance of this disease is autosomal dominant.  Idiopathic Generalized Epilepsy 12  Some mutations, particularly ASN411SER, ARG458TRP, ARG223PRO and ARG232CYS, have been shown to cause idiopathic generalized epilepsy 12 (EIG12), a disorder characterized by recurring generalized seizures in the absence of detectable brain lesions and/or metabolic abnormalities. Generalized seizures arise diffusely and simultaneously from both hemispheres of the brain. Seizure types include juvenile myoclonic seizures, absence seizures, and generalized tonic-clonic seizures. In some EIG12 patients seizures may remit with age. Inheritance of this disease is autosomal dominant.  Dystonia 9  Another mutation, ARG212CYS, has been shown to cause Dystonia 9 (DYT9), an autosomal dominant neurologic disorder characterized by childhood onset of paroxysmal choreoathetosis and progressive spastic paraplegia. Most patients show some degree of cognitive impairment. Other variable features may include seizures, migraine headaches, and ataxia.  Stomatin-deficient Cryohydrocytosis  Certain mutations, like GLY286ASP and a 3-bp deletion in ILE435/436, cause Stomatin-deficient cryohydrocytosis with neurologic defects (SDCHCN), a rare form of stomatocytosis characterized by episodic hemolytic anemia, cold-induced red cells cation leak, erratic hyperkalemia, neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, hepatosplenomegaly, cataracts, seizures, mental retardation, and movement disorder. Inheritance of this disease is autosomal dominant.  Role as a Receptor for HTLV  GLUT1 is also a receptor used by the HTLV virus to gain entry into target cells.  Role as a Histochemical Marker for Hemangioma  Glut1 has also been demonstrated as a powerful histochemical marker for hemangioma of infancy  Interactions  GLUT1 has been shown to interact with GIPC1. It is found in a complex with ADD2 and DMTN and interacts (via C-terminus cytoplasmic region) with DMTN isoform 2. It also interacts with SNX27; the interaction is required when endocytosed to prevent degradation in lysosomes and promote recycling to the plasma membrane. This protein interacts with STOM. It interacts with SGTA (via Gln-rich region) and has binary interactions with CREB3-2. GLUT1 has two significant types in the brain: 45-kDa and 55-kDa. GLUT1 45-kDa is present in astroglia and neurons. GLUT1 55-kDa is present in the endothelial cells of the brain vasculature and is responsible for glucose transport across the blood- brain barrier; its deficiency causes a low level of glucose in CSF (less than 60 mg/dl) which may elicit seizures in deficient individuals. Recently a GLUT1 inhibitor DERL3 has been described and is often methylated in colorectal cancer. In this cancer, DERL3 methylations seem to mediate the Warburg effect. Inhibitors Fasentin is a small molecule inhibitor of the intracellular domain of GLUT1 preventing glucose uptake. Recently, a new more selective GLUT1 inhibitor, Bay-876, has been described.

They were generally long-legged, long-necked birds, standing around one meter high, with the body of a duck, feet similar to a wader but webbed, and a flat duck-like bill adapted for filter feeding.

Located downtown at the corner of 4th and Brazos Streets, it had a reputation as a punk rock venue for its support of local and touring punk bands, but it also booked a wide variety of other types of music.\\"Dead Venues Live: Episode One,\\" narrated by Jesse Sublett, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4stbqi9Wiw&feature;=player_embedded Location Club Foot was located in a two-story warehouse that was partially underground, on 4th St. between Brazos St. and Congress Avenue, just east of the Greyhound Bus Station. The club featured a large picture window overlooking the bus staging area, and a bar made from a Lincoln Continental that was cut in half. Today, the Frost Bank building exists on the site of both buildings. History The structure had previously been the home of at least two other nightclubs. In 1977 it was a club called Boondock's, which featured live bands. Subsequent to that, it was a club called Crazy Bob's. The club was purchased in 1979 by David Ladd an entrepreneur involved in the real estate development business and motion pictures. It was converted into a Gay Disco called \\"Rushes\\" which opened March 17, 1979. The Grand opening several weeks later was packed with people from all over the country to see Grace Jones perform. It was huge success but as the Disco scene began to fade it became a showcase club for local bands and evolved into a punk rock venue.Jesse Sublett, Never the Same Again: A Rock n' Roll Gothic (Berkeley, Boaz/Tenspeed Press 2004).

It is adapted from the 1974 novel of the same name, the third in Patricia Highsmith's \\"Ripliad\\", a series of books chronicling the murderous adventures of Highsmith‚Äôs anti-hero Tom Ripley. John Malkovich stars as Ripley, opposite Dougray Scott and Ray Winstone. Highsmith's novel was previously adapted in 1977 as The American Friend by director Wim Wenders, starring Dennis Hopper and Bruno Ganz. Plot Tom Ripley is involved in an art forgery scheme in Berlin, in partnership with British gangster Reeves. Upon finding out that Reeves has attempted to cheat him, Ripley forces Reeves‚Äô customer at gunpoint to give him the money intended for the forgeries, and kills the man‚Äôs bodyguard. He also steals back the artwork for himself, and curtly tells Reeves that their partnership is over. Three years later, Ripley is living in a lush villa in Veneto with his wife Luisa, a harpsichordist. Invited by a neighbour to a party, Ripley overhears the host, Jonathan Trevanny, insulting his taste and alluding to his shady reputation. Ripley briefly confronts him, then sullenly leaves the party. Reeves resurfaces, much to Ripley's annoyance, asking him to eliminate a rival mobster. Ripley recommends Trevanny for the job as revenge for the slight. Believing Trevanny, a law-abiding art framer who is dying of leukemia, to be an assassin, Reeves offers him the job for a large fee. A bewildered Trevanny refuses at first, but eventually agrees in order to make sure that his wife and son are provided for after his death. Trevanny travels to Berlin under the pretense of seeing a leukemia specialist, and kills the mobster at a museum. He refuses Reeves‚Äô offer of even more money to kill another mobster, this time on a train, but relents after Reeves threatens his family. Trevanny freezes up on the train and contemplates suicide. Ripley intervenes and the two dispatch the target and his two bodyguards in the train's toilet. Together they return home, where Trevanny vainly attempts to persuade his wife Sarah that he won the money playing roulette. Reeves ignores Ripley's warnings to keep a low profile, fearing that the Mafia will seek reprisal for the killing and deduce who was involved. Sure enough, the mobsters' associates come to Italy seeking revenge, killing Reeves and leaving his body in the boot of their car. They storm Ripley's villa, but Ripley has set them up by carefully boobytrapping his home. With Trevanny's help, Ripley kills them all. Ripley leaves Trevanny under the assumption that all the killers have been dispatched. However, Trevanny returns home to find two surviving gangsters holding Sarah captive. Ripley spots the killers' silver BMW outside in the bushes and doubles back to Trevanny's in time to save his wife. A wounded assassin fires at Ripley, but Trevanny sacrifices himself by jumping in front of the bullet. Genuinely puzzled by Trevanny's selflessness, Ripley tries to give Sarah her husband's share of the blood money, but she spits in his face. That night, Ripley attends Luisa's concert as if nothing has happened, but smiles briefly at the memory of Trevanny's sacrifice.

Roger Ebert added Ripley's Game to his \\"Great Movies\\" list, calling it \\"the best of the four\\" Ripley films he had seen (the other three being Purple Noon, The American Friend, and The Talented Mr. Ripley) and Malkovich \\"precisely the Tom Ripley I imagine when I read the novels,\\" praising what he felt to be \\"one of [his] most brilliant and insidious performances; a study in evil that teases the delicate line between heartlessness and the faintest glimmers of feeling.\\" Ebert criticized the decision not to release the film theatrically in North America, writing: \\"The failure to open it theatrically was a shameful blunder.\\" Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film 3.5 stars out of 4, writing: \\"John Malkovich, oozing danger and sinister charm, gives one of the year‚Äôs most memorable and mesmerizing performances in Ripley‚Äôs Game... Malkovich oils himself around the plot - icy cool one moment, blazingly violent the next - with a master's finesse. Highsmith wrote five Ripley novels, and other actors have played the part, most recently and most blandly Matt Damon in The Talented Mr. Ripley. But Malkovich owns the role. He plays it for keeps.\\" David Rooney of Variety wrote, \\"Malkovich's elegantly malicious performance gives Ripley's Game a magnetic center, complemented by Liliana Cavani's efficient direction and an enjoyable retro feel that recalls the British Cold War thrillers of the 1960s. Despite some pedestrian plotting and a final act that could be tighter, this is suspenseful adult entertainment that should find a receptive audience.\\" Other critics were less favorable, such as Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian, who gave the film two stars out of five. Some critics compared the film unfavorably to Wim Wenders' 1977 adaptation, The American Friend. Nathan Rabin of The Onions A.V. Club remarked, \\"Ripley's Game fatally lacks the squirmy, desperate humanity that made Wenders' take on the same material so hauntingly tragic. Like Malkovich's suavely generic international criminal, it's all craft and no soul, with complexity and depth functioning as collateral damage for its slick thriller mechanics.\\" Neil Young's Film Lounge, giving Ripley's Game a score of 6 out of 10, called the film a \\"largely uninspired\\" adaptation by a \\"pedestrian\\" director, calling The American Friend \\"brilliant\\" by comparison, feeling that \\"any viewer who is a fan of Highsmith and/or The American Friend will have major problems with this version.\\" Home media On March 30, 2004, New Line Home Entertainment released the film on DVD and VHS.

Based on a story by Robert Riskin and Liam O'Brien, the film is about a foreign correspondent who has five days to win back his former fianc√©e, or he'll lose the orphans he adopted. Filmed from late November 1950 to January 29, 1951, the film was released in the United States by Paramount Pictures on September 20, 1951. Plot Newspaper reporter Pete (Bing Crosby) works in a Paris orphanage. His charming way with children and music enables him to find homes for even the most troubled kids. One afternoon, Mr. and Mrs. Godfrey (Alan Reed and Minna Gombell), an American couple, come to the orphanage to adopt Bobby, a boy they saw in one of the ads Pete ran in his newspaper. Bobby misbehaves, but when Pete discovers that Mr. Godfrey plays for the Boston Symphony Orchestra, he quickly produces a young blind opera wunderkind, Theresa (Anna Maria Alberghetti), who sings her way into the Godfreys' hearts. Later that night, Pete dreams that the fianc√©e he left behind in America, Emmadel (Jane Wyman) has visited. She appears in a hologram atop his record player, scolding him for leaving her at the altar and talks about the children they might have had. Filled with regret, Pete arranges to adopt both Bobby and his little sister Suzi and bring them to Boston, where he'll marry Emmadel. American authorities inform him that he must marry within five days or the adoption will be void. After delays in obtaining the children's birth certificates, they and Pete finally fly to Boston, and go to Emmadel's house. While she bonds with Bobby and Suzi, Pete discovers that Emmadel is engaged to an aristocratic man, Wilbur Stanley, whose office she works in. She had gotten tired of waiting for Pete's arrival home. The kids stay with her loud parents (drunken father James Barton, a fisherman, and disapproving mother Connie Gilchrist). Pete tries everything to win Emmadel back. She helps him secure a lease on a new house via her fianc√©'s company. However, when Pete and the children arrive at the house in the rain, they discover that another couple (the McGonigles) also have a lease for the property. Emmadel's fianc√© Wilbur shows up to settle the matter. Wilbur offers Pete a ride to another house - but Pete talks him into letting them stay at the Stanley family's gatehouse. They agree to a friendly competition for Emmadel's heart during the few days leading up to the wedding. Pete and the children settle into the Stanleys' lavish gatehouse, where Emmadel's parents are also staying. Emmadel meets Wilbur's amiable elderly relatives, who present her with $500,000 as a wedding gift. Her parents embarrass her by running screaming through the garden. Emma discovers Pete's presence and visits the gatehouse to have it out with him. While she pulls Suzi's loose tooth, Pete pretends to be in love with Winnifred, Wilbur's fourth cousin twice-removed, and laughs when Emmadel pratfalls on her huge party dress. Pete reveals his plan to Winnifred Stanley. He discovers that she has long been in love with her cousin Wilbur, but feels too socially awkward to pursue him. In a bit of Pygmalion, Pete teaches Winnifred to feel comfortable with herself. Winnifred's newfound confidence bubbles over at the wedding rehearsal. She and Emmadel erupt in a brawl on the front lawn. Winnifred concedes the fight, and Emmadel declares that she's proud to be a fisherman's daughter. The wedding day arrives. News reporters line the outdoor chapel, proclaiming this the Cinderella story of the decade. As he escorts Emma down the aisle, Pa Jones tells her that Pete kidnapped the children and ran so they wouldn't be sent back to France. Emmadel begins to have second thoughts. Pete shows up at precisely the wrong moment, handcuffed to a policeman, with both crying kids in tow. Although Wilbur offers to marry Emma and adopt the children, Bobby and Suzi cling sobbing to Pete. On national television, Wilbur abandons his own wedding and forces a reluctant Emma and a protesting (but secretly thrilled!) Pete to marry. Pete, Emmadel, Bobby, Suzi, Ma and Pa Jones all ride off for their honeymoon together.
