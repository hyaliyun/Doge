Xianbei name Pihetu (毗賀突), formally Prince Yang of Qi (齊煬王), was an imperial prince of the state Northern Zhou. He was a key official and general during the reign of his brother Emperor Wu, but after Emperor Wu's death was feared on account of his ability by his nephew Emperor Xuan, who therefore falsely accused him of plotting treason and strangled him. Background Yuwen Xian was born in 544, as the fifth son of Yuwen Tai, the paramount general of Western Wei. His mother was Yuwen Tai's concubine Lady Dabugan, who was ethnically Rouran. He was initially created the Duke of Fucheng and was said to be intelligent from his youth, and he and his older brother Yuwen Yong (by another concubine, Lady Chinu) studied the Shi Jing and the Zuo Zhuan together. Once, when Yuwen Tai was giving his sons horses, Yuwen Xian alone picked a multicolored horse. When Yuwen Tai asked him why he did so, he reasoned that in battle, a multicolored horse would be easier to tell apart from others. Yuwen Tai was pleased with the response, and from that point on, whenever he saw multicolored horses, he would award them to Yuwen Xian. In 553, Western Wei seized the modern Sichuan and Chongqing region from the Liang Dynasty pretender Xiao Ji. While Yuwen Tai initially entrusted the region to his nephew Yuchi Jiong, he wanted to eventually send a son there due to the wealth and strategic importance of the region. He asked his sons who was willing to go—but none responded except Yuwen Xian. Yuwen Tai responded, \\"A provincial governor needs to pacify the people and rule over them, and you are too young to do that. Based on age, I will pick an older brother of yours.\\" Yuwen Xian responded, \\"It should be based on ability, not age. If you let me try and I fail, I am willing to be punished.\\" Yuwen Tai was impressed with the response, but did not send him due to his young age, but left instructions for Yuwen Xian to be eventually entrusted with the region. In 554, Yuwen Xian was promoted to the greater title of Duke of Ancheng. In 556, Yuwen Tai, after entrusting his heir apparent and Yuwen Xian's older brother Yuwen Jue to Yuwen Xian's cousin Yuwen Hu, died. In spring 557, Yuwen Hu forced Emperor Gong of Western Wei to yield the throne to Yuwen Jue, ending Western Wei and establishing Northern Zhou. Yuwen Jue took the throne (as Emperor Xiaomin) with the alternative title of \\"Heavenly Prince\\" (Tian Wang), with Yuwen Hu serving as regent. Later that year, Yuwen Jue, trying to seize power from Yuwen Hu, had his plot discovered by Yuwen Hu, and Yuwen Hu deposed and then killed him, replacing him with another older brother of Yuwen Xian's, Yuwen Yu (as Emperor Ming). In 559, Emperor Ming, remembering Yuwen Tai's instruction, put Yuwen Xian in charge of the modern Sichuan and Chongqing region, with his headquarters at Yi Province (roughly modern Chengdu, Sichuan). Yuwen Xian, despite his young age of 15, was said to be a capable governor, paying attention to the people's concerns and to the important matters and making good decisions on legal cases. The people of the region favored him so much that they created monuments for him. Emperor Ming created him the greater title of Duke of Qi. During Emperor Wu's reign = During Yuwen Hu's regency = In 560, Yuwen Hu, apprehensive of Emperor Ming's intelligence, poisoned him to death. Emperor Ming, while on his deathbed, designated Yuwen Yong, then the Duke of Lu, the new emperor, and Yuwen Yong took the throne as Emperor Wu. Yuwen Hu resumed his regency. During Emperor Wu's Baoding (保定) era, Yuwen Xian was recalled from his post at Yi Province to be the governor of the capital province of Yong Province (雍州, roughly modern Xi'an, Shaanxi). In winter 564, when Yuwen Hu, in alliance with Tujue, launched a major attack on rival Northern Qi, Yuwen Xian was sent to command part of the army attacking Luoyang, along with Yuchi Jiong, Daxi Wu (達奚武), and Wang Xiong (王雄). However, the Northern Zhou army was defeated by the Northern Qi army commanded by Duan Shao (段韶) and Hulü Guang, and Wang was killed, causing the army to panic. Yuwen Xian visited the various army camps and was able to calm the anxious army, and he wanted to resume fighting, but Daxi, as the senior general, judged the situation to be too volatile, and so ordered a withdrawal. From this point on, however, Yuwen Hu entrusted Yuwen Xian with great responsibilities, and he participated in most important decisions. Yuwen Hu often had Yuwen Xian serve as a liaison between himself and Emperor Wu, and Yuwen Xian spent much effort trying to reduce the building tension between the two. By 568, he officially became minister of the army, as well as deputy prime minister (i.e., deputy to Yuwen Hu). Around the new year 570, Yuwen Xian was sent to try to capture the Northern Qi city of Yiyang (宜陽), near Luoyang, and while he was not successful against Hulü, the armies stalemated. In winter 570, Hulü changed tactics and headed north, encroaching onto Northern Zhou territory north of the Fen River (汾水, flowing through modern Linfen, Shanxi) and seizing substantial amount of territory. Yuwen Hu requested Yuwen Xian's opinion, and Yuwen Xian opined that Yuwen Hu should personally lead an army but stay some distance away from the front, while Yuwen Xian himself would advance and engage Hulü. Yuwen Hu agreed, and Yuwen Xian subsequently won some minor battles against Hulü, eventually causing the armies to again stalemate, although by that point territory had been lost. =After Yuwen Hu's death= In 572, Emperor Wu, apprehensive of Yuwen Hu, conspired with his brother by the same mother, Yuwen Zhi (宇文直) the Duke of Wei, and they ambushed and killed Yuwen Hu. After Yuwen Hu's death was announced, Yuwen Xian personally met Emperor Wu to apologize for having served under Yuwen Hu. Emperor Wu comforted him and had him take over Yuwen Hu's post of Da Zhongzhai (大冢宰)  but reduced the power of the post from being prime minister to only being minister of palace affairs, therefore reducing Yuwen Xian's authority while ostensibly promoting him. Yuwen Zhi was still jealous of Yuwen Xian, and several times advised Emperor Wu to execute Yuwen Xian. Emperor Wu refused. In 574, Yuwen Xian's title was changed to Prince of Qi. That year, Yuwen Xian authored a five-volume work on military strategies and offered it to Emperor Wu, and Emperor Wu was pleased with the work. In fall 574, while Emperor Wu and Yuwen Xian were at Yunyang Palace (雲陽, in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi), Yuwen Zhi took the opportunity to rebel at the capital Chang'an. Emperor Wu commissioned Yuwen Xian with an army to suppress Yuwen Zhi's rebellion, although before Yuwen Xian could get back to Chang'an the rebellion was already put down by the official Yuchi Yun (尉遲運). In 575, Emperor Wu, secretly planning a major attack on Northern Qi, only conferred with Wang Yi (王誼) and Yuwen Xian while making his plans, and Yuwen Xian greatly supported the plan. Emperor Wu personally attacked Luoyang, but after sieging it for 20 days without capturing it, he grew ill and was forced to withdraw. While Yuwen Xian made some gains on another front, he abandoned the gains and retreated with Emperor Wu. In winter 576, Emperor Wu again attacked Northern Qi, with Yuwen Xian as one of his major generals. The attack, while initially repelled by Northern Qi, was very successful, and Yuwen Xian greatly contributed to the eventual seizure, around new year 577, of Northern Qi's secondary capital Jinyang (晉陽, in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi). Emperor Wu put Yuwen Xian in charge of the operation against Northern Qi's capital Yecheng (鄴城, in modern Handan, Hebei), although by the time Yuwen Xian arrived at Yecheng, the Northern Qi emperor Gao Wei had already abandoned Yecheng and fled. Subsequently, Northern Zhou forces were able to capture Gao Wei. Yuwen Xian's army was said to be so disciplined that the people of Northern Qi were barely disturbed by them. Meanwhile, however, Gao Wei's uncle Gao Jie (高湝) the Prince of Rencheng and cousin Gao Xiaoheng (高孝珩) the Prince of Guangning were still at Xindu (信都, in modern Hengshui, Hebei) and resisting Northern Zhou forces. Emperor Wu sent Yuwen Xian to attack Xindu. Yuwen Xian sent a letter from Gao Wei and wrote a letter himself, both trying to persuade Gao Jie to surrender, but Gao Jie refused. Yuwen Xian, however, was able to defeat Gao Jie and Gao Xiaoheng, capturing them. Impressed with their bravery, he personally treated them with respect, even personally attending to Gao Xiaoheng's wounds. Subsequently, Yuwen Xian also defeated the Xiongnu tribal chief Liu Moduo (劉沒鐸), who had claimed imperial title, and captured Liu. In 578, Emperor Wu was launching a campaign against Tujue, but Yuwen Xian, apprehensive of his own successes on the battlefield, declined a commission from Emperor Wu to lead the army, making an excuse that he had a skin disorder that made it difficult for him to attend to the army. Before Emperor Wu actually launched the campaign, however, he fell ill and died, and was succeeded by his son and crown prince Yuwen Yun (as Emperor Xuan). Death Emperor Xuan, who was erratic in his behavior, greatly suspected Yuwen Xian on account of his ability. He initially asked the official Yuwen Xiaobo (宇文孝伯) to ambush Yuwen Xian, but Yuwen Xiaobo refused, he instead plotted with his associates Yu Zhi (于智) and Zheng Yi (鄭譯). One month after Emperor Wu's death, Emperor Xuan summoned his uncles to the palace under the pretense of giving them new commissions, but took the opportunity to ambush and capture Yuwen Xian. Emperor Xuan then had Yu accuse Yuwen Xian of treason. Yuwen Xian refuted each accusation, but was still strangled to death. Yuwen Xian's friends Wang Xing (王興), Dugu Xiong (獨孤雄), and Doulu Shao (豆盧紹) were also executed under false accusations of conspiring with Yuwen Xian, as were Yuwen Xian's sons.

He first came to prominence while his uncle Yuwen Tai served as the paramount general of Western Wei, and subsequently served Northern Zhou after the Yuwen clan established the state after Yuwen Tai's death. In 580, believing that the regent Yang Jian had designs on the throne, Yuchi rose against Yang but was soon defeated. He committed suicide.  During Western Wei  It is not known when Yuchi Jiong was born. His ancestors were a branch of the Tuoba tribe, which founded Northern Wei, and their subtribe was referred to as the Yuchi—and therefore took the name of the subtribe as the surname. His father Yuchi Qidou (尉遲俟兜) married the sister of Northern Wei's branch successor state Western Wei's paramount general Yuwen Tai, and they had two sons together—Yuchi Jiong and his brother Yuchi Gang (尉遲綱). (Yuchi Jiong's mother was later known as Princess Changle during Northern Zhou.) Yuchi Qidou died fairly early. Yuchi Jiong, who was said to be handsome, intelligent, and ambitious in his youth, served under his uncle Yuwen Tai, and married the Princess Jinming, the daughter of Emperor Wen of Western Wei. He showed talent both in military matters and in governance, and Yuwen Tai gave him increasingly important positions. In 552, rival Liang Dynasty, in the aftermaths of the major rebellion by Hou Jing and Hou's death earlier that year, had two major claimants to its throne—Xiao Yi (Emperor Yuan of Liang), who controlled the central and eastern provinces, and Xiao Ji, who controlled the western provinces, both sons of the founding emperor Emperor Wu. Xiao Yi, under attack from Xiao Ji, requested aid from Western Wei—in the form of an attack to Xiao Ji's rear, against Xiao Ji's home province Yi Province (modern central Sichuan). Yuwen believed this to be a great opportunity for Western Wei to conquer the modern Sichuan and Chongqing region, but when he discussed the matters with the generals, most were in opposition. Yuchi, however, was supportive of the plan and advocated an immediate attack. Yuwen thus put him in command over six other generals to attack Xiao Ji's realm, and the attack was launched in spring 553. Yuchi quickly advanced to Xiao Ji's capital at Chengdu (成都, in modern Chengdu, Sichuan). Xiao Ji's army, which was then battling Xiao Yi near Xiao Yi's capital of Jiangling (江陵, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei), collapsed, and Xiao Ji was killed by Xiao Yi. After Yuchi had put Chengdu under siege for five months, Xiao Ji's cousin Xiao Hui (蕭撝) and son Xiao Yuansu (蕭圓肅), who were defending Chengdu, surrendered. The surrounding provinces also soon surrendered, and Western Wei had taken over Xiao Ji's domain. Yuwen made Yuchi the governor of Yi Province, in charge of 12 provinces centering Yi. In 554, six provinces were added to Yuchi's responsibility, for 18 provinces total. However, as Yuchi missed his mother deeply, and his mother was still at the capital Chang'an, Yuwen soon recalled him back to Chang'an.  During Emperor Xiaomin's and Emperor Ming's reigns  Yuwen Tai died in 557, and his nephew Yuwen Hu, serving as the guardian for Yuwen Tai's son Yuwen Jue, forced Emperor Gong of Western Wei to yield the throne to Yuwen Jue in spring 558, ending Western Wei and establishing Northern Zhou, with Yuwen Jue as emperor (but using the alternative title \\"Heavenly Prince\\" (Tian Wang) (as Emperor Xiaomin). Emperor Xiaomin created Yuchi Jiong the Duke of Shu, in commemoration of his victory (as the modern Sichuan region was known in ancient times as the region of Shu). Later in 558, when Emperor Xiaomin tried to seize power from Yuwen Hu, Yuwen Hu deposed and then killed him, making Emperor Xiaomin's older brother Yuwen Yu the Duke of Ningdu emperor instead (as Emperor Ming). Yuchi Jiong's stance in this power struggle is not known, but his brother Yuchi Gang sided with Yuwen Hu. Yuchi's activities during Emperor Ming's reign were not recorded in history. In 560, Emperor Ming was poisoned by Yuwen Hu. Emperor Ming's younger brother Yuwen Yong the Duke of Lu became emperor (as Emperor Wu).  During Emperor Wu's reign  In 562, Yuchi Jiong became the Minister of the Army—one of the six departments of government, under a system designed by Yuwen Tai—although his actual authority over the army is not clear, as Yuwen Hu, as prime minister, also oversaw the armed forces. His brother Yuchi Gang served as Minister of Agriculture. In winter 564, Yuwen Hu launched a major attack on rival Northern Qi, and Yuchi Jiong had the responsibility of attacking Luoyang along with Daxi Wu (達奚武) and Emperor Wu's brother Yuwen Xian the Duke of Qi, but the attack was ultimately unsuccessful and withdrawn. In 568, Yuchi took on the even more honorific title of Taibao (太保)  one of the three senior advisors to the emperor—but with unclear authorities. In 572, Emperor Wu ambushed Yuwen Hu and killed him, taking over power personally. He made Yuchi Taishi (太師)  one of the three senior advisors to him but slightly more honorific than Taibao. In 576, Emperor Wu launched a major attack on Northern Qi, destroying it in 577 and taking over its territory. Yuchi's involvement, if any, in the campaign is unclear. In 578, Emperor Wu died, and the crown prince Yuwen Yun became emperor (as Emperor Xuan).  During Emperor Xuan's and Emperor Jing's reigns  In spring 579, Emperor Xuan established four new senior advisor posts, and he made, as those four, his uncle Yuwen Sheng (宇文盛) the Prince of Yue, Yuchi Jiong, Li Mu (李穆) the Duke of Shen, and Yang Jian the Duke of Sui (and his father-in-law, as the father of his wife Yang Lihua). He also made Yuchi in charge of the region around Xiang Province (相州, roughly modern Handan, Hebei)  effectively, the region north of the Yellow River. Later that year, Emperor Xuan passed the throne to his young son Yuwen Chan (Emperor Jing), becoming retired emperor—but with the highly unusual title of \\"Emperor Tianyuan\\" (天元皇帝, Tianyuan Huangdi). He proceeded to rule in an erratic and cruel manner, causing officials to become alienated. His acts included raping Yuchi Jiong's granddaughter Yuchi Chifan, who had married Emperor Xuan's cousin Yuwen Liang (宇文亮)'s son Yuwen Wen (宇文溫) the Duke of Xiyang, causing Yuwen Liang to plot rebellion. When Yuwen Liang's plot was discovered, Emperor Xuan killed him and Yuwen Wen, seizing Lady Yuchi as a concubine and then creating him one of his five empresses—contrary to the tradition of creating only one empress. (Another granddaughter of Yuchi Jiong's, Sima Lingji, was the young Emperor Jing's wife and empress.) In summer 580, Emperor Xuan died suddenly, and after Yang's friends and Emperor Xuan's associates Liu Fang (劉昉) and Zheng Yi (鄭譯) maneuvered behind the scenes by issuing an edict in Emperor Xuan's name, Yang became regent, and quickly took control of the political scene. As Yuchi had high reputation, Yang feared that Yuchi would oppose him, and therefore sent Yuchi's son Yuchi Dun (尉遲惇) the Duke of Wei'an to Xiang Province, summoning Yuchi back to the capital to attend Emperor Xuan's funeral and replacing him with the general Wei Xiaokuan. Yuchi, believing that Yang was intending to seize the throne, instead announced an uprising against Yang, declaring that he was intending to protect Northern Zhou's imperial lineage. He took the son of Emperor Xuan's uncle Yuwen Zhao (宇文招) the Prince of Zhao and declared him emperor. A number of important generals declared for him—the chief of whom were Sima Xiaonan (司馬消難), who controlled the southern provinces, and Wang Qian (王謙), who controlled the southwestern provinces—but he was unable to persuaded Li Mu, who controlled the modern Shanxi region, to join him. He was also unable to get Northern Zhou's vassal state Western Liang (ruled by Emperor Ming of Western Liang, a great-grandson of Liang Dynasty's Emperor Wu) to join him. Yuchi, despite his reputation, was by this point described as senile, entrusting most of his important matters to his secretary Cui Dana (崔達拏) and his second wife Lady Wang. Cui and Lady Wang's decisions were largely described as inappropriate ones, and the rebels made little advances. Soon, the central government forces, commanded by Wei, arrived at Yuchi's headquarters at Yecheng (鄴城, in modern Handan) and besieged it. When the city fell, just 68 days after Yuchi declared his rebellion, his son's father-in-law Cui Hongdu (崔弘度), who served under Wei, approached him, and gave him time to commit suicide. Yuchi did so, but only after hurling repeated insults at Yang Jian. His sons were killed. During the reign of Emperor Gaozu of Tang (618-626), Yuchi Jiong's grandnephew Yuchi Qifu (尉遲耆福) submitted a petition to have Yuchi Jiong given a proper burial.

The Creek drains the forest plantations and native bush of Silverpeaks Forest and the Careys Creek Conservation Area. It is crossed by State Highway 1 at Evansdale, close to the foot of The Kilmog.  Land tenure and management  The Careys Creek catchment was within the former \\"Silverpeaks State Forest\\" created from poor-quality grazing land in the 1960s and 1970s. The native bush was separated from the pine plantation during the Rogernomics privatisation of the New Zealand Forest Service to become the Careys Creek Conservation Area managed by DOC. The pine plantations passed through other owners and are now run by the Dunedin City Council-owned City Forests Ltd and known as Silverpeaks Forest During its tenure as a State Forest the valley floor was grazed, and accessible by farm vehicle for the first few kilometres. Now this area is reverting to native bush through a succession of rank pasture grasses, brooms, willows and manuka. History The Seacliff Lunatic Asylum, during Truby King's period of management, built a water supply pipeline from a dam at the head of the valley, near Semple Road. Rusting bits of pipe are still visible in places. Recreation The entrance to the Careys Creek valley system is at a small public picnic area, Evansdale Glen, off State Highway 1 about north of the township of Evansdale. Careys Creek Track follows the old farm track to its end at the foot of Rongomai Ridge and becomes progressively rougher as a narrow foot track to the creek's source, ending at a car park on Semple Road. This section probably dates back to the Asylum pipeline construction. Rongomai Ridge Track has a steep climb, continuing as a forestry road to Mountain Road. Honeycomb Ridge Track branches off further up the valley and heads up steep climbs to emerge at a parking area on Mountain Road. At this point, by heading north along Mountain Road, a sign marking the start Rongomai Track can be found.

Known for most of its length as Fingerboard Road, the highway runs from MD 85 in Buckeystown east to MD 27 near Damascus. MD 80 connects Buckeystown and Urbana in southern Frederick County with Damascus in far northern Montgomery County. At the suburban community of Urbana, the route has junctions with Interstate 270 (I-270) and MD 355. MD 80 was constructed between MD 27 and MD 75 in the mid- to late 1920s. The highway was built from Urbana to MD 75 in the mid-1930s and from Buckeystown to Urbana in the late 1930s. MD 80 was relocated at its western end in the mid-1970s and relocated and expanded through Urbana in the 2000s. Route description View east along MD 80 near MD 75 near Green Valley MD 80 begins at an intersection with MD 85 (Buckeystown Pike) south of the Buckeystown Historic District. The highway heads east as two-lane undivided Fingerboard Road, which meets the eastern end of Michaels Mill Road immediately before crossing the Monocacy River. As MD 80 approaches I-270 (Eisenhower Memorial Highway), the highway veers southeast to parallel the Interstate. The route expands to a four-lane divided highway as it curves east and meets the freeway at a four-ramp partial cloverleaf interchange; the southbound I-270 ramps meet MD 80 at a roundabout. Following this interchange, the road passes between two park and ride lots serving MTA Maryland commuter buses. MD 80 has another roundabout with Sugarloaf Parkway before meeting Urbana Pike east of the center of Urbana. The highway intersects MD 355 (Worthington Boulevard), the main east-west street through the suburban development in Urbana, before becoming undivided while passing north of Urbana High School and dropping to two lanes again on either side of Carriage Hill Drive. East of Urbana, MD 80 meets the southern end of Ijamsville Road south of Ijamsville and has staggered intersections with MD 75 (Green Valley Road) south of Monrovia while passing through the expansive area known as Green Valley. Shortly after passing through the hamlet of Kemptown, the highway enters Montgomery County. MD 80 continues as Kemptown Road a short distance southeast to its terminus at MD 27 (Ridge Road) in the hamlet of Claggettsville north of Damascus. History Fingerboard Road is likely named for a finger-shaped sign pointing toward a cannery in Monrovia, a sign that would have been at the highway's western intersection with MD 75. The MD 75 concurrency next to the fingerboard was the first segment of Fingerboard Road paved around 1921. MD 80's old concurrency with U.S. Route 240 (US 240, later MD 355) was paved as a concrete road in 1923. US 240 through Urbana was widened to by 1930 and resurfaced with bituminous concrete in 1938. The first segment of MD 80 proper built was from MD 27 at Claggettsville west to Penn Shop Road, which was paved as a concrete road in 1925 and 1926. Another stretch of concrete was built from MD 75 east to Lynn Burke Road in 1926 and 1927. The western segment was extended part of the way to Bartholows Road in 1928. The Fingerboard-Claggettsville highway was completed when the gap through Kemptown was completed in 1929 and 1930. Fingerboard Road from Urbana to Centerville just east of modern Carriage Hill Drive was built as a treated earth road between 1933 and 1935. This semi-modern road was completed east to MD 75 in 1936. The final section of MD 80 from Buckeystown to Urbana was constructed as a concrete road around 1938. The Urbana-Fingerboard highway was widened and resurfaced between 1950 and 1952. MD 80's interchange with the new Washington National Pike (now I-270) was also constructed in that time span. Shortly thereafter, MD 80 was widened between US 240 and the new freeway. The old highway with which MD 80 passed through the center of Urbana became US 240 Alternate in 1954 and MD 355 in 1955. MD 80's present alignment west of the Monocacy River was constructed between 1973 and 1975. The old road, now named Michaels Mill Road, was redesignated MD 880 and remained in the state highway system until 2008. Reconstruction of MD 80 through Urbana began shortly before 2000; that year, relocation of MD 80 as a four-lane divided highway from I-270 to MD 355 was completed, including the roundabout at Sugarloaf Parkway. The highway was expanded to four lanes through the I-270 interchange and the roundabout with the southbound I-270 ramps were built in 2008. The upgrades to MD 80 were completed in 2009 when the highway was expanded to a four-lane divided highway from MD 355 to Carriage Hill Drive. Junction list Auxiliary routes MD 80 had a trio of auxiliary routes that were created in 2000 when MD 80 was relocated in Urbana. All three routes were transferred to county maintenance in 2005. *MD 80A was the designation for Old MD 80, which ran from a dead end adjacent to the I-270 interchange east to an acute intersection with MD 355. *MD 80B was the designation for Service Road, a connector between MD 80 and MD 80A. *MD 80C was the designation for the segment of Sugarloaf Parkway between MD 80 and MD 355.

The company is the city's longest running all- volunteer playhouse, having presented a full season of performances every year since 1961.  History  Theatre Suburbia was formed in the summer of 1961 and opened its inaugural season with Philip Barry's, The Philadelphia Story on October 27, 1961. Tickets for the first show sold for $1.50 and the original building at 1410 W 43rd Street would not get air conditioning until its second season. The theatre remained on 43rd Street until 2008, when the theatre moved to a modern facility at 4106 Way Out West Drive.History of Theatre Suburbia, http://theatresuburbia.org/about.php?tab=history In 2020 the theatre moved to 5201 Mitchelldale Street, where it can be found today.  Program  Theatre Suburbia produces a 7-show season of modern classics, dramas, comedies and new plays. The annual season runs from September through August. A typical season includes a mystery (often a classic Sherlock Holmes or Agatha Christie favorite), a Christmas holiday production, a play with a distinctive Texas theme or voice, a comedy, and a melodrama. Developing a strong local theatre community is a cornerstone of Theatre Suburbia's program. An effort is made to showcase at least one play by a playwright from within the local regional community. The theatre hosts an annual script contest in which prospective playwrights can submit an original script to be considered for the summer production. Several first-time playwrights have had their scripts produced on stage at Theatre Suburbia and then gone on to have their plays published or performed at other theatres.  Melodrama  Theatre Suburbia's annual production of a classic melodramaMelodrama sets it apart from other community theatre companies. Every summer the company produces a classic melodrama. Elements of a classic melodrama include a plot-driven story with exaggerated stereotypical characters (invariably including a virtuous victim, an unequivocally evil villain, and a larger-than-life hero). Dialog is usually exaggerated, augmented by straightforward plot devices. Melodramas, while popular in the 19th century, are seldom taken seriously by modern dramatists.Singer, Ben (2001). Melodrama and Modernity: Early Sensational Cinema and Its Contexts. New York: Columbia University Press. pp. 44–53. More often, they are lampooned (or simply left to Dudley-Do-Right cartoons). In the hands of Theatre Suburbia's directors and actors, the melodrama takes on a very Texas style and flavor. Western frontier themes are favored in the scripts and wholesome hometown cowboys are typically the preferred hero. Theatre Suburbia calls its melodramas \\"summer mellerdramas\\", and for more than four decades, they have proven to be the most popular productions of the year among local Houston audiences. Additional weekend matinees augment the summertime schedule to better accommodate families with young children. Before each show, the audience is provided with tips for interacting with the performers: cheer for the hero, boo the villain, and always feel free to throw handfuls of popcorn anytime the villain should venture too close to the audience.

Though the east–west leg of the route is longer than the north–south portion, the entire route is signed as north–south. The route starts at an interchange with SR 7 in Bellaire. The route heads west to Belmont where it turns north at an intersection with SR 147. After spending most of the time in Belmont County, SR 149's northern terminus is at SR 9 near New Athens, Harrison County. Route description SR 149 begins at an interchange with SR 7 in Bellaire, just west of the Ohio River. The route heads west on 26th Street through Bellaire paralleling the McMahon Creek. Shortly after leaving Bellaire, the route passes through a large Cut as the creek bends to the south briefly. As the route heads west along the creek, SR 149 passes through several unincorporated communities including Neffs and Glencoe. In Warnock, SR 149 meets and shares a short concurrency (signed as a wrong-way concurrency) with SR 9. Continuing west, the route enters Belmont as Main Street and reaches SR 147 at Jefferson Street. The two routes continue west on Main Street, make a left turn onto Bridge Street, and make a right turn at Railroad Street before exiting the village. At an intersection just west of the village, SR 147 and SR 149 end their concurrency; SR 147 continues west towards Bethesda while SR 149 heads north from this point. Prior to here, SR 149 traveled through a densely wooded valley, but now the route heads through more farmland with rolling terrain. As the route approaches Morristown, the route meets I-70 at Exit 208. From the interchange until the intersection with US 40, the route is surrounded by small businesses, fast foot restaurants, and the campuses of Union Local High School and Union Local Middle School. SR 149 shares a brief concurrency with US 40 on the edge of Morristown. After the westernmost intersection with US 40, SR 149 continues north again towards Flushing. In Flushing, SR 149 heads north on Morristown Street until it reaches SR 331 at High Street. The two routes head east on High Street through downtown Flushing and exit the village together. East of Flushing, SR 149 heads northeast for the last of the route through Belmont County. Upon entering Harrison County, SR 149 continues northeast until ending at an intersection with SR 9 just south of the New Athens village limits. No part of SR 149 is included within the National Highway System. The route is lightly traveled; the busiest section of the road as measured by the Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) is within the SR 7 interchange in Bellaire with an AADT of 9,560. History The highway now known as SR 149 between Morristown and New Athens has been a part of the State Highway System since 1912; the route was called SR 103 until 1922. By 1923, the Morristown-New Athens route was renumbered to SR 149. In 1930, the route was extended south to SR 147 just outside Belmont. In 1979, the route was extended from Belmont to Bellaire on essentially the route it runs today. From 1979 to 2010, SR 149 traveled on a less-direct route through Bellaire. At the intersection of 26th Street and Belmont Street, SR 149 headed into downtown Bellaire and traveled on Belmont, Crescent, Guernsey, 32nd, and Hamilton Streets. In 2010, ODOT completed a relocation of SR 149 to move the state highway off of the local streets in Bellaire.

He first served under the dynasty's founder Emperor Wu, but became the most prominent general of the state during the reign of Emperor Wu's nephew Emperor Xuan, successfully commanding the Chen army in seizing the region between the Yangtze River and the Huai River from rival Northern Qi. After Northern Qi was destroyed by Northern Zhou, however, Wu was defeated and captured by the Northern Zhou general Wang Gui (王軌). After he was taken to the Northern Zhou capital Chang'an, he died in anger. During Liang Dynasty Wu Mingche was born in 512, as the youngest son of the Liang Dynasty general Wu Shu (). His grandfather Wu Jing'an () was a commandery governor during preceding Southern Qi. His family was from Qin Commandery (秦郡, roughly the part of modern Nanjing, Jiangsu, north of the Yangtze River). Despite the fact that Wu Jing'an was a general, the family was not wealthy, and when Wu Jing'an died in 525 when Wu Mingche was 13, it was said that the family could not afford a proper burial. Wu Mingche, despite his young age, worked hard on the family farm, and eventually, partly because of his hard work, the family was able to gather enough funds to bury Wu Jing'an properly. When Wu Mingche grew older, he served as an officer in the guard corps for Emperor Wu of Liang's crown prince, Xiao Gang. When the general Hou Jing rebelled and sieged the capital Jiankang in 548, Wu Mingche appeared to be at his home in Qin Commandery, which, as a result of trade routes' being cut off, suffered from a famine. Wu had grains stored, but rather than keeping the grains for his own clan, he persuaded his older brothers that the grain should be shared with the local people, allowing the people to survive. Hou soon captured Jiankang, and was not defeated until 553, by Wang Sengbian, a general under the command of Emperor Wu's son Xiao Yi the Prince of Xiangdong, who soon declared himself emperor (as Emperor Yuan). Wang Sengbian's lieutenant Chen Baxian was put in charge of the important city Jingkou (京口, in modern Zhenjiang, Jiangsu). When Chen put out a general invitation for people to join his army, Wu met him. Chen was impressed with his abilities, and treated him with respect. It was also around this time that Wu studied histories and other classical works, as well as astronomy and strategies from the official Zhou Hongzheng (). In 554, Emperor Yuan made him a provincial governor, but he continued to serve under Chen's command. In winter 554, Western Wei launched a major attack on Emperor Yuan's capital Jiangling (江陵, in modern Jingzhou, Hubei). Emperor Yuan made an emergency summon to Wang, then in charge of Jiankang, ordering him to come to Jiangling's aid. Wu was one of the generals named by Wang to command part of his troops. However, before Wang could even mobilize his troops, Jiangling fell, and around the new year 555, Western Wei forces put Emperor Yuan to death. Wang and Chen subsequently prepared to make Emperor Yuan's son Xiao Fangzhi the Prince of Jin'an emperor, but when Northern Qi attacked and Wang's forces suffered losses against Northern Qi, Wang accepted the proposal of Emperor Wenxuan of Northern Qi to make Emperor Wu's nephew Xiao Yuanming emperor instead, and he declared Xiao Yuanming emperor in summer 555. Displeased with Wang's decision, Chen made a surprise attack on Jiankang in fall 555, killing Wang and deposing Xiao Yuanming. Chen declared Xiao Fangzhi emperor (as Emperor Jing). Subsequently, when generals loyal to Wang resisted Chen, aided by Northern Qi, Wu served under Zhou Wenyu () in the campaign against Wang's son-in-law Du Kan () and Zhang Biao (), and later participated in a key battle defending Jiankang in 556. For his contributions in the two campaigns, he was created the Marquess of Anwu. In 557, Chen had Emperor Jing yield the throne to him, establishing Chen Dynasty as its Emperor Wu. Wu Mingche continued to serve as a general in the new dynasty's military. During Emperor Wu's and Emperor Wen's reigns Immediately prior to taking the throne, Emperor Wu had sent Zhou Wenyu and another major general, Hou Andu, west against Wang Lin, an independent general still claiming loyalty to Liang, and Wu was one of the generals who served under Zhou and Hou. When Wang subsequently defeated the Chen troops, capturing Zhou and Hou as well as three other generals, Xu Jingcheng (), Zhou Tiehu (), and Cheng Lingxi (), Wu was not captured, and was able to take his forces back to Jiankang. Subsequently, Wu was assigned to operations in the modern Jiangxi region to defend against a possible attack from Wang (who had by this point declared Emperor Yuan's grandson Xiao Zhuang Emperor of Liang) as well as to keep the local warlords in check. In 559, Emperor Wu died and was succeeded by his nephew Chen Qian the Prince of Linchuan (as Emperor Wen). Wang, upon hearing of Emperor Wu's death, decided to attack Chen, and Wu Mingche made an attempt to intercept Wang at Pencheng (湓城, in modern Jiujiang, Jiangxi), but was defeated by Wang's general Ren Zhong (). Wu barely escaped with his life, allowing Wang to continue his advance toward Jiankang. Wang, however, was subsequently defeated by Hou Tian (), and both he and Xiao Zhuang were forced to flee to Northern Qi. As part of Chen's effort to then take control of Xiao Zhuang's territory, Emperor Wen assigned Wu to be the governor of Wu Province (武州, roughly modern Changde, Hunan), but he was defeated by the Northern Zhou (Western Wei's successor state) general Heruo Dun () and forced to withdraw to Baling (巴陵, in modern Yueyang, Hunan). He was, however, able to defeat further Northern Zhou advance there. In 562, when the warlord Zhou Di (), who controlled parts of modern Jiangxi, rebelled, Wu was made the governor of Jiang Province (江州, roughly modern Jiujiang), to command the army against Zhou. However, the strict Wu was unable to get his subordinate generals to obey his orders, and Emperor Wen subsequently sent his brother Chen Xu the Prince of Ancheng to replace Wu. In 564, Emperor Wen made Wu the governor of Wuxing Commandery (吳興, roughly modern Huzhou, Zhejiang)  an apparent demotion, but as Emperor Wen pointed out, actually an important position because Wuxing was the imperial Chen clan's home commandery. When Emperor Wen grew ill in 566, he recalled Wu to serve as the commanding general of the palace guards. Emperor Wen died later that year and was succeeded by his son, the Crown Prince Chen Bozong (as Emperor Fei). During Emperor Fei's reign Initially during Emperor Fei's reign, the government was controlled by, pursuant to Emperor Wen's will, the high level officials Dao Zhongju (), Kong Huan (), Emperor Wen's brother Chen Xu, Yuan Shu (), and Liu Shizhi (). However, by spring 567, two factions were developing—one led by Chen Xu and one led by Dao and Liu, as Dao, Liu, and Chen Xu took up residence in the palace and handled most of the sensitive matters. In spring 567, Liu tried to exclude Chen Xu by having the official Yin Buning () informing Chen Xu that he should leave the palace to attend to the affairs of the capital region Yang Province (), of which Chen Xu was also governor. Chen Xu consulted Mao Xi () and Wu Mingche, both of whom persuaded him not to follow Yin's message. Wu, specifically, argued that Chen Xu was in the position of the Duke of Zhou and the Duke of Shao (uncles and regents to King Cheng of Zhou) and had a responsibility to protect the state. Chen Xu therefore invited Liu to a meeting—and while the meeting was still going on, had Mao confirming with Empress Dowager Shen and Emperor Fei that it was not their order that he leave the palace. Once Mao confirmed so, Chen Xu arrested Liu and ordered him to commit suicide, while demoting Dao to a lesser position. From this point on, the administration was controlled by Chen Xu. Dao later tried to start an uprising with the general Han Zigao (), but the plot was discovered, and Chen Xu forced both of them to commit suicide. As both Dao and Han were trusted associates of Emperor Wen, another trusted associate of Emperor Wen, Hua Jiao () the governor of Xiang Province (湘州, roughly modern Changsha, Hunan) became apprehensive, and he prepared for a battle with Chen Xu, requesting aid from both Northern Zhou and Emperor Ming of Western Liang—a Liang Dynasty prince who claimed title to the Liang throne as a Northern Zhou vassal. In summer 567, Chen Xu commissioned Wu as the governor of Xiang Province and had him command a major part of the troops against Hua, along with Chunyu Liang (). The opposing sides met at Dunkou (沌口, in modern Wuhan, Hubei). Wu and Chunyu were able to ram Hua's, Northern Zhou's, and Western Liang's fleets, causing them to collapse. Hua and the Northern Zhou general Yuwen Zhi () were forced to flee to Western Liang's capital Jiangling. In light of the victory, Wu first captured Western Liang's Hedong Commandery (河東, part of modern Jingzhou), and then further put Jiangling under siege. Western Liang's Emperor Ming was forced to flee to the subsidiary fort of Ji'nan (紀南, near Jiangling). Wu sieged Jiangling for 100 days but could not capture it, and had to withdraw in spring 568. For his contributions, he was promoted to the greater title of Duke of Anwu. In winter 568, Chen Xu deposed Emperor Fei, and in spring 569, he took the throne himself (as Emperor Xuan). Wu continued to serve as a general in Emperor Xuan's military. During Emperor Xuan's reign In 573, Emperor Xuan wanted to launch a campaign against Northern Qi to capture the region between the Yangtze River and the Huai River. The officials that he discussed with had diverse opinions, but Wu Mingche was the one who advocated quick action. Emperor Xuan decided to carry out attack, and because Chunyu Liang was the senior general, most officials believed that he should command the mission. Xu Ling (), however, advocated making Wu the commanding general, pointing out that Wu was a good general and that his family was from north of the Yangtze and therefore he was familiar with the customs of the region. Emperor Xuan therefore put Wu in charge of the main assault, while putting the general Huang Fachu (name not in Unicode) in charge of the secondary front. Wu quickly captured his home commandery (Qin Commandery). Northern Qi sent forces commanded by the general Wei Pohu () to try to stop Wu's advance, but Wu's subordinate Xiao Mohe defeated a group of Northern Qi's best warriors, leading to the Northern Qi army's collapse. Most of the territory south of the Huai River was quickly captured, and as Qin Commandery was Wu's home commandery, Emperor Xuan, in order to honor him, ordered him to publicly offer a sacrifice of an ox, a pig, and a sheep to his ancestors. By fall 573, Wu had the important city of Shouyang (壽陽, in modern Lu'an, Anhui), defending by Wang Lin, under siege, and although he could not capture it quickly, he did when the Northern Qi relief force commanded by Pi Jinghe () arrived but was hesitant to engage him. He captured Wang, Lu Qian (), Kezhuhun Daoyu (), and Li Taotu (). Pi fled, and Wu captured his horses and camels. Because many of Wu's officers were Wang's subordinates and respected him, Wu became apprehensive and executed Wang, delivering the other Northern Qi officials to Jiankang. The region between the Yangtze and the Huai was now entirely in Chen hands, and Emperor Xuan created Wu the greater title of Duke of Nanping. He also put Wu in charge of the six provinces making up of the region. (In order to confer the honors on Wu, he had a high platform built near Shouyang and had Wu ascend the platform to accept these honors, and the entire army felt honored on Wu's account.) In winter 575, Wu launched an attack on Pengcheng (彭城, in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu). However, he appeared to soon withdraw. In 576, he was made the governor of Southern Yan Province (南兗州, roughly modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu). In 577, Northern Zhou destroyed Northern Qi and took over its territory. In winter 577, Emperor Xuan, believing that Northern Zhou's hold on Northern Qi's southern provinces was not yet secure, ordered Wu to launch a major attack on Pengcheng, making Wu's heir apparent Wu Rongzhao () his lieutenant. Initially, Wu defeated the Northern Zhou governor of Xu Province (徐州, roughly modern Xuzhou) Liang Shiyan (), forcing Liang to withdraw inside Pengcheng and defend it. Wu put Pengcheng under siege. In spring 578, the Northern Zhou general Wang Gui () arrived with a force to lift the siege, and he, as his first step, cut off Wu's supply route (and escape path). Xiao Mohe advised Wu to attack Wang as quick as he could to prevent the supply route from being cut off, but Wu did not follow Xiao's suggestion. Soon, the Chen forces were trapped. Wu's subordinates suggested destroying the levee near Pengcheng so that the area would flood, allowing them to escape by ships. Wu agreed, but believing that he, as the commanding general, should withdraw last, did so, sending Xiao with the cavalry first. The cavalry was therefore able to escape, but most of the foot soldiers—30,000—and Wu himself were captured by Wang and taken to the Northern Zhou capital Chang'an. Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou created Wu the Duke of Huaide, but Wu, angry over his capture, died soon thereafter. It appeared that because Wu Mingche was captured and not killed in action, his titles and offices were stripped by Emperor Xuan. After Emperor Xuan's death, Emperor Xuan's son and successor Chen Shubao posthumously created Wu the Marquess of Shaoling in 583 and allowed his younger son Wu Huijue () to inherit the title. (The fact that the title was not inherited by Wu Rongzhao implied that Wu Rongzhao was probably also captured by Northern Zhou forces or died without issue.)

Nicknamed the \\"Blackhawks\\" and flying the MH-53E Sea Dragon, it is staffed by both active duty and reserve personnel. It is the sister squadron to HM-14, the \\"Vanguard\\", based a half-mile away at NS Norfolk. History MH-53E tows a minesweeping sled while conducting simulated mine clearing operations HM-15 was established on 2 January 1987, as the first of two similar active duty squadrons at NS Norfolk. On 1 October 1987, the squadron's permanent duty station changed to Naval Air Station Alameda. In October 1989 the squadron was called upon to provide support for disaster relief effort after the Loma Prieta earthquake in California. To assist they lifted full-size construction backhoe tractors and assisted in other airlift operations. The unit was awarded the Humanitarian Service Medal for their efforts. The squadron was involved in its first major conflict in 1991 when it deployed a three aircraft, 100 man detachment to the Persian Gulf in support of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. The squadron remained in the theater until April 1992 after transporting over 3.2 million pounds of cargo and more than 4,000 personnel. They have also been involved in Operation Enduring Freedom most notably through deployments to Bahrain. HM-15 and the reserve squadron HM-19 were the first squadrons in the U.S. Navy to combine and fully integrate active and reserve squadrons. HM-19 was soon afterward decommissioned, with the integrated squadron maintaining the HM-15 designation, mascot, and insignia. The integration was completed on 5 November 1994. Due to Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC), with the slated closure of NAS Alameda, on 30 June 1996, the permanent duty station of the squadron was officially moved to NAS Corpus Christi. In 2010 it was moved due to BRAC once again and now calls NS Norfolk home. At times, HM-15 has had more than 750 personnel. Its largest work center, the \\"Line Division\\" boasts at times nearly a hundred personnel, supporting rotating \\"round the clock\\" operations. Its second largest work center, the \\"Airframes and Hydraulics Shop\\" has almost 60 personnel. The squadron has deployed to locations like Bahrain, South Korea, the Middle East via the Persian Gulf, Indonesia, and in both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. HM-15 also took part in Joint Task Force Katrina and was part of Hurricane Katrina relief efforts while working with . She has operated from the flight decks of , , , , , USS Bataan, and . In 1995, HM-15 was awarded the Chief of Naval Operations Safety Award and a Meritorious Unit Commendation. Again affected by the Base Realignment and Closure Commission in 2005, the squadron moved from NAS Corpus Christi back to where they first started at NS Norfolk. After a helicopter crash that killed two sailors in Bahrain in July 2012, squadron commander Commander Sara Santoski and Master Chief Petty Officer Bobby T. Anderson were relieved of duty and reassigned.Bozick, Tara, \\"Navy: Norfolk Helicopter Squadron Commander Relieved Of Duty\\", Newport News Daily Press September 2, 2012 Operations A rainbow is formed in the mist rising from the ocean as an HM-15 MH-53E conducts mine countermeasures operations near Naval Air Station Alameda, 1990. Using the MH-53E Sea Dragon helicopter, they patrol foreign and domestic waters to locate and destroy sea-based mines that would harm watercraft and map safe sea-lanes of travel. Mines can be triggered by any number of methods ranging from contact to an electronic signature. While the aircraft hovers safely above the sea, it is capable of dragging through the water a wide variety of instruments and machines to accomplish the mission. In harbors, coordination with EOD Divers helps to clear more shallow waters safely. Squadron deployments have been executed all over the globe, for operational, training, humanitarian, and foreign relations tasking. An aircrew member from HM-15 on a MK-103 mine sweeping mission aboard an MH-53E near Bahrain Due to the capabilities of the huge heavy-lift aircraft used, the squadron also performs the missions of assault support and cargo transport when deployed. HM-15 was the first squadron to load two MH-53Es into a U.S. Air Force C-5 Galaxy transport aircraft. To do so, all seven blades and the main rotor head is removed, the tail folded, and the helicopter inched slowly into the cabin. The pressure in tires and struts must be lowered and raised at appropriate stages in order to get the main gearbox shaft to clear the overhead while going up the ramp. It is not rare to see the squadron maintaining an operational \\"home\\" detachment while supporting two separately located far-flung deployments in other places of the world.

HM-15 is the first U.S. Navy squadron to combine and consolidate training requirements between the USN and the USNR. Changes here had ripple effects all the way up to the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO) as instructions were researched and updated. HM-15 is the first squadron to utilize a fully computerized training documentation system with a graphical user interface (GUI), called \\"Train 'em!\\". This training planning and documentation system replaced hundreds of man-hours of hand-documentation, with one or two personnel and a networked database that synchronized with the administration personnel database, and generated the necessary government training logs required for training documentation and inspections, for \\"ground-pounder\\", \\"aircrew\\", and \\"officer\\" training. This system was eventually distributed to sister squadron, HM-14, and to other naval commands. They are the first squadron to boast its own modern IT work center with certified staff to support all IT functions including cabling, networking, database management, and computer maintenance. This capability was replaced by the Navy and Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) in 2002. HM-15 maintains a trainer with a full size articulated mockup of the cabin and gear of an MH-53E for training Enlisted Aircrew in the roles of mine countermeasures and operational procedures. It is a fairly significant \\"stage\\", looking reminiscent of a huge theme park reality ride, and a brand new building was constructed to house both it and the Squadron Training Department.

History The area which it occupies was once a part of an area of tidal marshland, known as the Deadlake; Batholomew Terrace, a road now adjacent to the park, was marked on 19th century maps of the area as Deadlake Lane. At the end of the 19th century, culverts were constructed to channel a few small streams which fed into the Deadlake, and the creek was filled in with rubble from the quarries at Oreston and Cattedown, a mile or so away. After heavy rain the culverts can become overloaded and water forces its way to the surface. This has only been particularly dramatic once in the last 10 years, with no effect other than temporarily inconveniencing pedestrians using the park as a short cut between Millbridge and the city centre.

The team is selected and supported by Northern Cape Cricket and plays its home games at the De Beers Diamond Oval in Kimberley. At organisational level, Northern Cape Cricket is responsible for the administration and development of cricket in the province and among its primary functions are management and promotion of the Northern Cape team. Originally founded sometime before 1884 as the Kimberley Cricket Club, the organization developed at provincial level as the Griqualand West Cricket Board until 2015 when it was renamed Northern Cape Cricket to comply with a government directive that provincial sporting bodies should have their governance structure aligned with the geo-political structure of the country. The team was called Kimberley to 1890–91 and Griqualand West to 2014–15. It has been called Northern Cape from the beginning of the 2015–16 season. For the purposes of the SuperSport (now Sunfoil) Series, Griqualand West merged with Free State to form the VKB Knights (originally the Diamond Eagles) from October 2004, but Griqualand West (renamed Northern Cape in 2015) has retained its independent status as a team in the CSA Provincial Competitions.

In 1888–89, they won two odds matches against the English touring team known then as R. G. Warton's XI. As a result of those victories, Kimberley were awarded the new Currie Cup as the most accomplished domestic team in South Africa. In the 1889–90 season, they were successfully challenged for the trophy by Transvaal but they recovered it in 1890–91. The first matches as Griqualand West were played in December 1890 for the Champion Bat Tournament and, from 1891–92, the team was known by its provincial name only.

Draining a basin of , it enters the Columbia near the city of Umatilla in the northeastern part of the state. In downstream order, beginning at the headwaters, major tributaries of the Umatilla River are the North Fork Umatilla River and the South Fork Umatilla River, then Meacham, McKay, Birch, and Butter creeks. The name Umatilla is derived from the Native American name for the river, which was first recorded as Youmalolam in the journals of the Lewis and Clark Expedition and spelled in many other ways in early books about Oregon.McArthur, p. 981 Course Mouth of the Umatilla River at the Columbia River in Umatilla, July 2013 The Umatilla River's headwaters lie in the Blue Mountains at the confluence of its north and south forks in the Umatilla National Forest of northeastern Oregon. Flowing generally west, the river receives Lick Creek and Bear Creek, both from the right before reaching the unincorporated community of Bingham Springs. Further downstream it receives Rock Creek from the right, then Bobsled, Augur, and Ryan creeks from the left before entering the Umatilla Indian Reservation and reaching the unincorporated community of Gibbon. From Gibbon to the river mouth, tracks of the Union Pacific Railroad run parallel to the stream. Between Gibbon and Cayuse, three creeksSquaw, Buckaroo, and Coonskinenter the river from the left. Downstream of Cayuse, Moonshine, Cottonwood, and Mission creeks also enter from the left. The maps, which include river mile (RM) markers for the lower of the river, include the following quadrants from mouth to source: Umatilla, Hermiston, Stanfield, Echo, Nolin, Barnhart, Pendleton, Mission, Cayuse, Thorn Hollow, Gibbon, and Bingham Springs. The river flows by Mission at about river mile (RM) 61 or river kilometer (RK) 98, leaves the Indian reservation, and reaches the city of Pendleton at about RM 56 (RK 90), passing under Oregon Route 11. Wildhorse Creek enters from the right, then Patawa Creek from the left. The river passes under Interstate 84 (I-84) and receives McKay Creek from the left. Shortly thereafter, Birch Creek enters from the left about from the mouth. Coombs Creek enters from the left about below that, and then the river, turning north, flows by Echo and under I-84 again. The Umatilla reaches Stanfield about from the mouth, then passes under Oregon Route 207 and receives Butter Creek from the left. Reaching Hermiston at about RM 9 (RK 14), the river flows by a United States Geological Survey (USGS) stream gauge about from the mouth, then passes under Interstate 82 and Oregon Route 730 before entering the Columbia River at Umatilla. The Umatilla River joins the Columbia at what is called Lake Umatilla, a reservoir formed by the John Day Dam on the Columbia. The confluence is from the Columbia's mouth on the Pacific Ocean at Astoria. McNary Dam, another dam on the Columbia, is slightly upstream at about RM 292 (RK 470). Fish Trout fishing at Buck Creek Organization Camp in Umatilla River (September 1956) The Umatilla River supports populations of spring Chinook, fall Chinook, and Coho salmon as well as small trout in its upper reaches. Public access to salmon and steelhead fishing is fairly good downstream of the Oregon Route 11 bridge. Upstream of the bridge, the river runs through the Umatilla Indian Reservation, where fishing is limited to those with a tribal permit.Shewey, p. 307 See also * List of rivers of Oregon * List of longest streams of Oregon References Works cited * McArthur, Lewis A., and McArthur, Lewis L.

The usage was popularised by the song Jiao Wo Ruhe Bu Xiang Ta (教我如何不想她 \\"Tell me how to stop thinking of her\\"), a \\"pop hit\\" in the 1930s in China. The lyrics were written by him and the melody by Yuen Ren Chao. In 1920, he left China to study linguistics abroad, first in London, then in Paris. He gained his PhD at the University of Paris, with research done on Chinese tones. During his time in Paris, he compiled Dunhuang Duosuo (敦煌掇瑣 \\"Miscellaneous works found in the Dunhuang Caves\\"), a pioneering work about the Dunhuang manuscripts. Among his other achievements, Liu was a pioneer in Chinese photography. He called for a photographic style which would be technically advanced but rooted in Chinese tradition. This call was an inspiration to younger photographers such as Lang Jingshan, who established a style of photography which incorporated the aesthetic of Chinese landscape painting. Liu returned to China in 1925, and began teaching in colleges. He collaborated with Li Jiarui () to compile Songyuan Yilai Suzi Pu (宋元以來俗字譜 \\"The vernacular characters used from the Song and Yuan dynasties onwards\\"). Published in 1930, it was a key work in the standardisation of simplified Chinese characters. In 1933 Liu Bannong conducted an interview with Sai Jinhua. He wrote The Wife of Zhuangyuan: Sai Jinhua, which he called her \\"true story\\". He died of an acute illness after a linguistic field-trip, at the age of 44. Lu Xun wrote a short memoir about Liu () after his death. He was the elder brother of the musicologist Liu Tianhua.

It is the oldest continuously used Episcopal church in Colorado, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. History The congregation of Calvary Episcopal Church was begun by the Episcopal missionary Bishop George Maxwell Randall, who later would establish the Colorado School of Mines. This chapel, built upon land donated by William A.H. Loveland, was constructed in 1867-68, and has been in use by the congregation ever since. It was designed by a member of the original church vestry, and is the earliest known work constructed by prominent regional builder John H. Parsons. Its interior woodwork, styled like that of Anglican churches, was carved by Robert Millikin and Woods. The church bell was given to the congregation in 1870 by the wife of George A. Jarvis, whom Jarvis Hall college was named after. Calvary's baptismal font was carved by George Morrison, for whom Morrison, Colorado was named. Upon the beloved bishop Randall's death in 1873, the congregation pledged to preserve this chapel as a monument to his service to Colorado. Several additions have since been built to the structure, including its Guild Hall (1902), projecting chancel (1909), and classroom addition (1954). The original chapel has been restored in an ongoing project from the 1990s-2000s. It is listed on the Golden, Colorado and National historic registers. Noted parishioners of Calvary have included George West, Edward L. Berthoud, and the Coors family, of whom the brewery's founder donated the church pews.

He became Mayor of Dallas, a major factor in the creation of Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, and a philanthropist in later years. Biography Erik Jonsson was born on 6 September 1901 in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. His parents, John Peter and Ellen Charlotte (Palmquist) Jonsson, were both born in Sweden and independently migrated to the United States in the prior decade. Both were naturalized citizens. Jonsson was an only child. The family moved in 1912 to Montclair, New Jersey, where at the age of sixteen Jonsson graduated from Montclair High School. Jonsson was a graduate of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), class of 1922 earning a degree in mechanical engineering. He was an Alpha Tau Omega. Jonsson married Margaret Fonde in Knoxville, Tennessee on 8 February 1923 and together they had three children. =Business career= Jonsson began his career in 1922 at Alcoa as a rolling mill apprentice, and advanced to the position of manufacturing superintendent of an Alcoa subsidiary, the Aluminum Index Company. He held the position from 1923 to 1927. In 1927 he left Alcoa and entered the auto business attempting a Pontiac dealership, returning to Alcoa in 1929 as a sales engineer. During Jonsson's last year at Alcoa, J. Clarence Karcher the husband of Mrs. Jonsson's cousin, occasionally asked Jonsson's assistance with expediting materials orders for his start-up company, Geophysical Service Incorporated a pioneering provider of seismic exploration services to the petroleum industry. In June 1930 Karcher offered Jonsson a job managing the manufacture of seismic instruments at Karcher's company lab in Newark, New Jersey, and in July Jonsson again left Alcoa. In 1934, Jonsson and his family moved to Dallas, Texas. Jonsson held the position of secretary of Geophysical Service, which gave him responsibility for all of the accounting, banking, international, legal, manufacturing, personnel, purchasing, and warehousing activities of the company. Jonsson held this position until 1939. In 1939, the company reorganized as Coronado Corp., an oil company with Geophysical Service Inc (GSI), now as a subsidiary. In 1939, Jonsson became secretary-treasurer. On 6 December 1941, Jonsson along with three other GSI employees, Eugene McDermott, Cecil H. Green, and H.B. Peacock purchased GSI. In 1942, he became vice president and treasurer. He held this position until 1951. During World War II, GSI built electronics for the United States Army Signal Corps and the Navy. After the war GSI continued to produce electronics. The rugged nature of equipment for the oil industry and of military equipment were similar and thus continued expansion into military contracts was a natural progression. In 1951, the company changed its name to Texas Instruments; GSI becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the new company. Jonsson became president of Texas Instruments, a position he held until 1958. Jonsson was elected chairman of the board in 1958 and held this position until 1966. He became honorary chairman in 1966 through 1977. =Civic activities= Jonsson was a strong advocate for education, serving or leading on the boards of many educational institutions and created alliances to improve local educational facilities. Jonsson was a founder of the Southwest Center for Advanced Studies, which became the University of Texas at Dallas in 1969. In 1964, shortly after the assassination in Dallas of President John F. Kennedy, Jonsson became mayor of Dallas, Texas. He worked to improve morale and the image of the city. He was reelected three times. Jonsson pushed through a $175 million bond that financed a new city hall, the Dallas Convention Center and the Dallas Central Library. He was a central leader in the development of Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. Legacy Jonsson Tower, the centerpiece of the Skidmore College campus. Several facilities bear Jonsson's name in recognition of his contributions. These include the J. Erik Jonsson Central Library in Dallas, and the well-known Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas in Richardson. A trustee of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, he helped fund major campus improvements, leading the institute to name the Jonsson Engineering Center and Jonsson- Rowland Science Center in his honor. The J. Erik Jonsson Center of the National Academy of Sciences, overlooking Quissett Harbor in Woods Hole on Cape Cod, is also named in honor of Jonsson. He also served as a trustee of Margaret's alma mater Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, New York. Although founded in 1912, Skidmore started a new campus of which the Jonssons largely funded construction in the 1960s.

Foods of the American Civil War were the provisions during the American Civil War with which both the Union and Confederate armies struggled to keep their soldiers provisioned adequately.  Northern rations  According to Hardee's Rifle and Light Infantry Tactics,printed by Pioneer Press written by a U.S. Army officer from the South before the war, the rations for a soldier during this time usually included: * 20 oz. pork or beefKen Burns, The Civil War, documentary movie series (Beef was either fresh or salted, and pork was always salted.) * 12 oz. hard bread in camp or garrison or 16 oz. of hard bread at sea, on campaign, or on the march * 1 oz. compressed cube of desiccated mixed vegetables or a 1.5 oz. compressed cube of desiccated potatoes if supplemental foods were unavailable This would be supplemented by (per 100 rations): * 8 qts. of beans or peas * 10 lbs. of rice or hominy * 10 lbs. of green coffee beans or 8 lbs. of roasted coffee beans * 10 lbs. of sugar * 2 qts. of salt * 1 quart of vinegar The most common field rations issued to individual soldiers were salt pork and hardtack, both of which were designed to withstand field conditions without deteriorating. Excess salt could be scraped off the meat to supplement the salt ration. However, these rations required cooking to make them palatable. Less experienced soldiers were unlikely to have their own cooking equipment, and the large company-level kettles were sometimes left behind during rapid advances. Food often became infested with insects, especially rice or grain weevils. This, along with scarcity and inedible rations, made it necessary for soldiers to supplement their diets on their own. Soldiers could obtain a greater variety of foods by foraging and/or raiding; receiving food boxes from their families; or purchasing/trading items with other soldiers. Soldiers could not count on obtaining food from the inhabitants of areas where they encamped since most citizens were also affected by the war and had little to give. If inhabitants supported the soldiers' side in the war, sometimes they might manage to provide food, but it was usually acquired by theft. Gail Borden's invention of condensed milk was very helpful in for the Union army. Soldiers would also regularly drink coffee, however it was not always entirely coffee beans. Dandelion root served as a supplement or Ersatz good when coffee beans were scarce. Dandelion root was widely available and caffeine-free, tasting about the same as coffee.  Southern rations  The rations for soldiers in the Confederate States of America army were supposed to follow the guidelines in Hardee's book. Hardee himself would serve in the Confederate Army as a corps commander in the western theater. Although Northern quartermasters took the ration guidelines as their standard, the South's army found itself lacking most of the items listed. The Confederate government attempted to provide adequate rations for their troops but were hampered by blockades, monoculture farming, and lack of transportation. They were served cornbread. Confederate soldiers, on the other hand, had more access to tobacco than their Union counterparts. While opposing troops were on picket duty, it was common for Union soldiers to trade their coffee with the Confederate soldiers in exchange for tobacco (away from the eyes of officers). Southern soldiers could also use roasted chicory root as a coffee substitute. The peanut, due to its wide availability throughout southern North America, was also an important source of food for Confederate soldiers.  Logistics  The Civil War required complex logistics in order to feed the massive numbers of soldiers in the Union and Confederate armies. The task could fall to the respective national governments or on the individual states that recruited, raised, and equipped the regiments and batteries. Both armies had their own commissary departments designed to organize the feeding of soldiers during the war. They oversaw the procurement, logistics, and the distribution of millions of pounds of food supplies, often shipped and stored in wooden barrels. Salted meats, coffee beans, dried peas or dried beans, sugar and hardtack, a stale biscuit (that would have to be softened in a liquid such as coffee), were all commonly distributed by these departments. Often, while on field campaigns, soldiers found themselves saving some portions of food in their haversacks, washable canvas bags that provided storage but did little for food preservation. The soldiers' diets often sometimes included salted pork, salted beef, salt, vinegar, and dried fruits and vegetables. Rarely, the soldiers could obtain fresh items such as carrots, onions, turnips, potatoes, and fresh fruit. The Union army soldiers were often given food items such as bacon, cornmeal, tea, sugar, molasses, and fresh vegetables. Another common dish was Skillygalee, hardtack soaked in water and fried in fat. The Confederate army would fry bacon and add in some water with cornmeal to make \\"coosh\\" often prepared when the army would have little time to make meals during marches.  Beyond the battlefield  Beyond the battlefield, the scarcity of food was felt far more sharply in the South, a result of the success of Union blockades. Northern cookbooks of the period barely make mention of the war. In the few southern cookbooks published during and shortly after, the fact of shortages is inescapable.

Unable to break into the first team, he sought a transfer. Liverpool accepted a bid of £270,000 by Celtic in March 1980, and for a short time McGarvey became Scotland's most expensive footballer. McGarvey played 245 times for Celtic over five years, scoring 113 goals. In that time he won two League Championships, two Scottish Cups and a Scottish League Cup. However, Celtic manager David Hay decided Mo Johnston and Brian McClair would be his forward line for the 1985–86 season and declined to offer McGarvey an extended contract.

The company is also in the process of developing multiple properties for television, film, and stage. He is the former producer of Xtreme Pro Wrestling. He is also the co-creator, producer and head booker of Wrestling Society X which aired on MTV and additional networks worldwide. In the wake of WSX, Kevin was ranked in the Pro Wrestling Torch Most Influential People In Wrestling list. Kevin currently consults with various wrestling, mixed martial arts and other live event and sports/entertainment related producers on production and monetization of content. Masked Republic and Kleinrock's Stone-Rock Entertainment company (founded with actor/producer Stu Stone) created and produced a pilot for a lucha related live Vegas show called Lucha Las Vegas. Professional wrestling career =California independent circuit= Kleinrock's career in wrestling began at the age of 16 when he went to work for Slammers Wrestling Federation (SWF) based out of Sun Valley, California. Kleinrock performed various roles with the SWF including time keeper, ring announcer, program writer, and even brought Slammers to his high school for a fundraiser wrestling show. While working at Slammers, he became friends with Darren McMillan who wrestled as Dynamite D. In 1996, Kleinrock and Slammers parted ways when he headed off to college at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). Shortly thereafter, McMillan and a number of other wrestlers who had left Slammers over the years formed tho Dynamite Wrestling Organization, and after an unscripted shoot angle on an SWF show, the Slammers roster split. McMillan, along with former Slammers referee Patrick Hernandez and Kleinrock, formed Southern California Championship Wrestling (SCCW). SCCW promoted mostly fundraiser events throughout Los Angeles including \\"SlamFest '98\\" which was held at UCLA in conjunction with the Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity (of which Kleinrock was a member) with proceeds going to the Make-A-Wish Foundation. In the main event, SCCW's Sheriff Jess Hansen teamed with Yokozuna as they battled Cincinnati Red and The Honky Tonk Man. Shows, however, were generally promoted by the wrestlers and staff handing out flyers themselves at local wrestling events. At one local World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) event, a flyer was handed to the CEO of Extreme Associates, Rob Black. Black had been in negotiations with Paul Heyman and Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) to co-promote West Coast shows and distribute ECW DVDs in Brazil (where Black co-owned a distribution company). He called McMillan and requested a meeting to discuss the Los Angeles wrestling scene SCCW. As a result, the SCCW folded, and McMillan, Hernandez, and Kleinrock worked with Black to form a new wrestling company, Xtreme Pro Wrestling (XPW). Kleinrock was the vice president of XPW, as well as taking on the role of an on-screen antagonist where he played right-hand man to XPW CEO Rob Black in most of the series 130 plus episodes. He was affiliated with Black's Black Army and was nicknamed \\"Dork-o Dude\\" by XPW commentator Kris Kloss. =Big Vision Entertainment= After the closure of XPW, Kleinrock worked for Houston Curtis' Big Vision Entertainment company. As a former MTV employee, Curtis was able to obtain an interview with the broadcaster for discussions as to creating a show. At the meeting Kleinrock put over a vision of a program combining music and professional wrestling in a format to appeal to the 18 to 24 male demographic, as well as MTV's existing audience. The pilot show for the newly dubbed Wrestling Society X (WSX) was filmed in February 2006 and accepted by MTV. The short-lived weekly television series aired on MTV, MTV2, MTV Tr3s, MTV UK, and over a dozen other MTV outlets throughout the world. In May 2008, Kleinrock served as executive producer and head writer for XPW's \\"Cold Day In Hell\\" reunion show. The event drew the largest crowd for any non-lucha libre independent wrestling show in Southern California since the original XPW. In July 2009, Kleinrock served as executive producer for XPW's \\"XPW X\\" 10-year anniversary show. Big Vision also was involved with NWA Championship Wrestling From Hollywood, an \\"old school\\" TV studio show produced with the National Wrestling Alliance. Kleinrock served as an executive producer and writer for the program in its original form but is not currently involved with the series airing on KDOC in Los Angeles. Kleinrock also worked on a number of non-wrestling related programs while at Big Vision including CBS Sports' The Ultimate Blackjack Tour, a pilot for TruTV based on the East Bay Rats motorcycle club out of Oakland, CA, and the first ever animated Cheech & Chong movie Cheech and Chong's Animated Movie.

Releases in the series included Vince Russo and Ed Ferrara: Inside The WWF (2005), Vince Russo and Ed Ferrara: Inside WCW (2005), One-On-One With Vince & Ed (2005), The Hardy Boys: From The Backyard To The Big Time (2006), Matt Hardy: Behind the Controversies (2006), Jeff Hardy: Unwrapping The Enigma (2006), Doin' Time With New Jack (2007), and Last Call with Raven and Sandman (2008). The series was the first pro wrestling related series to have Direct Response television (infomercial) spots air to sell them. Bankruptcy of Big Vision Entertainment and XPW Big Vision largely ceased trading after its main distributor went bankrupt, this led to Big Vision having no way of selling its products, including XPW related products. As a result of this Big Vision and XPW were only legal entities on paper on were not functioning companies. Big Vision subsequently filed for bankruptcy in 2010, in the state of Pennsylvania after the conviction of Black on obscenity charges. The assets of which were put up for auction in two parts, pornography and wrestling. The wrestling portion included the Ultimate Insiders DVDs. WWE purchased both catalogues and stated they purchased both to obtain the associated intellectual property rights. The pornographic assets were subsequently offloaded by WWE to MindGeek. The pornographic assets which were part of the obscenity lawsuit were included in the sale, but WWE and subsequently MindGeek agreed with authorities not to distribute the indicted materials. XPW meanwhile filed for bankruptcy in the state of California in 2014. The assets of XPW were listed as copyright, trademarks, championship belts, a music library, and minor wrestling associated equipment. WWE completed the purchase of XPW's assets in October 2014. WWE has stated they purchased the assets for the music library and the overall intellectual property. They do not plan on using XPW branding on its shows, but XPW shows may appear on the WWE Network or special compilation collections. WWE has stated that the Ultimate Insiders DVDs will be available on the WWE network. =After Big Vision= While still consulting with Big Vision on a project by project basis, Kleinrock opened his own marketing, management, merchandising and consulting company Worldwide Personified, in January 2010. In early 2010 Kevin served as supervising producer on the Bischoff-Hervey Entertainment produced midget wrestling pilot for TruTV.http://www.pwinsider.com/article/45685/more-on-eric-bischoffs- midget-wrestling-project.html?p=1 When the series was picked up for a full season, he was brought back as a segment producer. Kleinrock also consulted for the A&E; series Strange Days with Bob Saget on their pro wrestling related episode which aired in December 2010. Kleinrock's main focus has become Masked Republic for wrestling/lucha related projects and the early 2011 formation of Stone-Rock Entertainment for additional non-wrestling related projects. In January 2011, Masked Republic produced a TV pilot called Lucha Las Vegas. The company also had a Pay Per View series called Viva La Lucha which produced new episodes bi-monthly from mid-2010 to mid-2011. DVDs of some of the PPVs are available in stores in the U.S. and Canada. Masked Republic also has an apparel line and has had at least one design available in Urban Outfitters stores. All of Masked Republic's merchandise is available through their online store LuchaShop.com. In early 2012 it was announced that Masked Republic was now representing the AAA Lucha Libre company for international television. According to the Masked Republic website, they have other television series in the works including Liga De Lucha, LLU, Viva L.A. Lucha, Heroes Enmascarados, and a show that is referred to most places as The Manny Peeples Show. Masked Republic also uses the Bell Gardens based Santino Bros. Wrestling Academy and the San Jose-based Pro Wrestling Revolution Wrestling Academy and their PWR promotion as \\"development\\" programs for their lucha based TV programs. In June 2011 Kleinrock also became supervising producer of a new wrestling league called the Urban Wrestling Federation which was launched as a brand existing only on Pay-Per-View and owned by former ECW managing partner Steve Karel. Kleinrock was a writer and producer for the initial PPV taping which took place at the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York City on June 3. Three events were taped that night and the debuted on Pay Per View on Sunday, June 26. The concept behind Urban Wrestling is to combine hip hop recording stars as the leaders of different factions who fight in the ring but also on the street and feud over drugs and money. In April 2012, Kleinrock was revealed to be one of the people behind \\"5 Guys Wrestling,\\" a company launching a brand of wrestling called Extreme Reunion (changed in May 2012 to Extreme Rising) to fill a void left by the demise of ECW and provide a more realistic and \\"non-PG\\" approach to pro wrestling. In June 2012, Kleinrock revealed, via his Facebook page, that he had been, managing the launch of a 24/7 Anime channel called Neon Alley which is owned by VIZ Media. In April 2014, Neon Alley transitioned from a self-contained app and website to a channel on Hulu. In 2016, Kleinrock was named Director of Digital Operations & Partner Development for VIZ Media. =Personal life= Kleinrock has two children who both have a rare genetic disorder called Angelman syndrome. Kleinrock has plans to start a non-profit to aid in awareness and proper diagnosis of the disorder as well as provide grants to families who need assistance for Angelman Syndrome related expenses including durable medical equipment and time off of work. Masked Republic has participated in fundraising efforts previously for the Foundation for Angelman Syndrome Therapeutics, the American Diabetes Association and the American Cancer Society. Kleinrock continues his humanitarian efforts towards fundraising for Angelman Syndrome Foundation research and supportive services in 2018, while planning his marriage to long-time girlfriend Merilisse Beyelia.

Listed at 5' 7\\", 168 lb., he batted and threw left handed. (Spanish) Acosta was a distinguished batter in his homeland. As a result, many people called him, in friendly way, as El Loquito que Inventó el Hit (the tiny crazy who invented the hit).Gutiérrez, Daniel; Alvarez, Efraim; Gutiérrez (h), Daniel (2006). La Enciclopedia del Béisbol en Venezuela. LVBP, Caracas. His skills were shown in his motherland with the Aguilas del Zulia, Cardenales de Lara, Industriales de Valencia, Licoreros de Pampero, Llaneros de Acarigua and Tigres de Araguaof the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League. Besides, Acosta played nine seasons in the Mexican League for the Leones de Yucatán, Pericos de Puebla, Tecolotes de Nuevo Laredo and Cardenales de Villahermosa, now known as Olmecas de Tabasco . Along his prolific career of 23 years, Acosta won five batting crowns, two of them in his motherland and the rest of them in México.  Professional career  = Early years = Acosta broke into minor league baseball with the Class-D Dothan Cardinals of the Alabama–Florida League in 1958, batting .313 with 76 RBI and a league-leading 36 stolen bases in 124 games. For whatever reason, the parent Cincinnati Reds assigned him to Dothan for a second season in 1959, and he responded by bopping out a .337 average and again led the circuit with 46 steals. Sufficiently impressed, the Reds moved Acosta up to the Billings Mustangs of the Class C Pioneer League the next season, where he topped the loop with a .369 average (the first of his five pro batting crowns) and 45 swipes. He leapfrogged over B ball in 1961 to play for Class A Columbia Reds of the South Atlantic League, and once more was best in the league in batting (.343) and steals (40), marking his fourth consecutive stolen base titles. =Venezuelan Winter League (1956–1979)= Teolindo Acosta belong to a selected list of baseball players in Venezuela, who are in the top of several offensive departments; Acosta is the third in the list of most games played (1130); third in plate appearances (4324); he is fourth in Run scored (604); also he is third in hits (1289); additionally, is in the second place in Triples (56) and fourth in stolen bases (121). Along his long career of twenty three years in the Venezuelan winter league, Acosta won two batting titles. In between, he spent part of the 1959–1960 season with the Gavilanes and Rapiños clubs of the rival Occidental League. =Mexico League (1968–1976)= Acosta was one of the top batters in Mexican baseball for nine seasons between 1968 and 1976, winning three batting titles in a six-year span. Never a power hitter, the 5’6\\" 158-pound outfielder was a contact hitter who rarely struck out and sprayed the ball all over the field, similar in fashion to Rod Carew. He cooled off a bit over the next few seasons, batting between .269 and 294 from 1962 through 1966, and after only hitting .238 for Buffalo of the International League over 49 games in 1967, he moved south to Mexico for the 1968 campaign with Puebla. Acosta found his footing in the Mexican League, bettering .320 his first eight seasons. He hit .325 for the Pericos in 1968, followed by a Liga batting crown with a .354 average in 1969. Despite that, he moved on to Yucatán in 1970. After hitting .337 that season (including one game in which he went 6-for-6 with six runs), he was the top hitter in Mexico in 1971 with a career-high .392 BA and followed up with a solid .346 season in 1972. Acosta returned to Puebla during his .375 campaign in 1973, and won his fifth and final batting championship in 1974 with a .366 showing. After hitting .320 for Villahermosa in 1975, he wrapped up his career as a 39-year- old with Nuevo Laredo in 1976 by batting .276, his only sub-.300 season in nine Mexican League campaigns. The left-handed Acosta carried a lifetime .328 average in 19 seasons of professional baseball, collecting 2,724 hits with 64 homers and 389 stolen bases. He did even better in Mexico, knocking out a .345 batting average (sixth-best lifetime in the Liga) with 132 stolen bases. He led all of professional baseball in batting in 1971 and 1974. Despite these figures, he is not a member of Mexican baseball's Salon de la Fama.

The book's title was taken from the Marine company that March served in during World War I. It has been regarded as one of the most significant works of literature to come out of the American World War I experience and the most reprinted of all March's work. Plot summary The novel comprises 113 vignettes about World War I Marines in Company K. The novel is told from the viewpoint of 113 different Marines, stretching from the beginning of training to after the war. These sketches create contrasting and horrific accounts of the daily life endured by the common Marine. Many of the accounts stem from actual events witnessed and experienced by the author. It has often been described as an anti-militarist and an anti-war novel, but March maintained that the content was based on truth and should be viewed as an affirmation of life. Literary significance & criticism Writer and literary critic for the Spectator Graham Greene places it among the most important of all war novels: :\\"His book has the force of a mob-protest; an outcry from anonymous throats. The wheel turns and turns and it does not matter, one hardly notices that the captain of the company, killed on page 159, is alive again a hundred pages later. It does not matter that every stock situation of the war, suicide, the murder of an officer, the slaughter of prisoners, a vision of Christ, is apportioned to Company K, because the book is not written in any realistic convention. It is the only War-book I have read which has found a new form to fit the novelty of the protest. The prose is bare, lucid, without literary echoes, not an imitation but a development of eighteenth-century prose.\\" The journalist and writer Christopher Morley had an almost identical response to Company K after reading an advance copy: :\\"It's queer about this bookit suddenly made me wonder whether any other book about the War has been written in this country. It's a book of extra-ordinary couragenot the courage of hope but the quiet courage of despair. It will make patriots and romanticists angryyet it is the kind of patriotism that is hardest and toughest. It ranks at once with the few great cries of protest. It is a selected, partial, bitter picture, but a picture we need. It will live. None of the acts of bravery for which the author was decorated during the War was as brave as this anthology of dismay.\\"Simmonds (1988), p. 4. Company K has often been compared to Erich Maria Remarque's classic anti-war novel \\"All Quiet on the Western Front\\" for its hopeless view of war. University of Alabama professor and author Philip Beidler wrote in his introduction to the 1989 republication of the novel: :\\"the act of writing Company K, in effect reliving his very painful memories, was itself an act of tremendous courage, equal to or greater than whatever it was that earned him the Distinguished Service Cross, Navy Cross and French Croix de Guerre\\". Years after the completion of Company K, Ernest Hemingway published Men At War: The Best War Stories of All Time. In the introduction Hemingway notes that of all the stories published in the novel, the two he most desired to publish were omitted, Andre Malraux's Man's Fate and William March's Nine Prisoners, one of the original serialized excerpts from Company K. Hemingway states that the anti-war aspects of the stories would not bode well, as the novel coincides with the beginnings of World War II. He further states: :\\"Since the military problem, which was by no means clearly presented in the story, will undoubtedly arise many times in this war, I thought the story should be omitted from this book for the duration of the war. After the war, if a new edition of this book is published, I should strongly advise that the story be included.\\"From the 1942 introduction of Ernest Hemingway's Men At War: The Best War Stories of All Time, p. xxx.

The San Nicandro Jews are descended from local non-Jewish families from the 15th century. According to John A. Davis, professor of Italian history at the University of Connecticut, the Jews of San Nicandro represent \\"the only case of collective conversion to Judaism in Europe in modern times\\". History Photograph of Donato Manduzio Beginning in the late 1920s, the community developed as a result of the conversion to Judaism of Donato Manduzio (1885-1948), a crippled World War I veteran who was inspired by his own reading of the Bible. Donato was the son of Giuseppe Manduzio and Concetta Frascaria, poor Roman Catholic peasants from San Nicandro. He did not go to school but he learned reading and writing during World War I, while he was hospitalized in a military hospital in Pisa. After the war, he started to read extensively on religion and Italian literature; He became a folk healer and had encounters with some Protestants (including Pentecostals and Adventists) nearby his hometown. By 1930, he read the Bible and claimed to have had a vision, abandoned Christianity, and started to spread his message among the folk of San Nicandro, exhorting them to live according to the Law of Moses and follow a Jewish lifestyle. He soon converted several dozen of his neighbors, founding a small Jewish Sabbatarian sect. Later, he contacted the Chief Rabbi of the Jewish community of Rome and organized the formal conversion of his followers to Orthodox Judaism. By 1949, most of the San Nicandro Jews emigrated to Israel, where the majority of them settled in the cities of BiryaMichael Brenner, A Short History of the Jews, Princeton University Press (2010), p. 363. and Safed. Today the remaining Jews worship in the historic Scolanova Synagogue, in the neighboring town of Trani, Apulia. The Jewish community of San Nicandro is featured in the documentary The Mystery of San Nicandro, which began filming in Italy in 2011. The film is produced by Toronto-based Matter of Fact Media.

Today, pharmaceutical companies try to make new drugs as selective as possible to minimise binding to antitargets and hence reduce the occurrence of side effects and risk of adverse reactions. Examples of compounds often cited as \\"dirty drugs\\" include tramadol, chlorpromazine, olanzapine, dextromethorphan and ibogaine, all of which bind to multiple receptors or influence multiple receptor systems. There may be instances of advantages to drugs that exhibit multi-receptor activity such as the anti-addictive drug ibogaine that acts within a broad range of neurohormonal systems where activity is also exhibited by drugs commonly associated with addiction including opioids, nicotine, and alcohol. Similarly chlorpromazine is primarily used as an antipsychotic, but its strong serotonin receptor blocking effects make it useful for treating serotonergic crisis such as serotonin syndrome. Dextromethorphan for its part is widely used as a cough medication, but its other actions have led to trials for several conditions such as its use as an adjunct to analgesia, and a potential anti-addictive drug, as well as its occasional recreational use as a dissociative. Kanamycin is an aminoglycoside antibiotic which induces deafness through blockage of the outer hair cells of the cochlea; yet it has many other effects, weakening for instance the collagen and DNA biosynthesis. It acts by inhibiting the synthesis of proteins in susceptible organisms. Kanamycin requires close clinical supervision because of its potential toxicity and adverse side effects to the auditory and vestibular branches of the eighth cranial nerve and to the renal tubules.http://medical- dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/kanamycin Clozapine and latrepirdine are examples of drugs used in the treatment of CNS disorders that have a superior efficacy precisely because of their \\"multifarious\\" broadspectrum mode of activity. Likewise, in cancer chemotherapeutics, it has been recognized that drugs active at more than one target have a higher probability of being efficacious. The anti-histamine and anti-cholinergic effects of atypical and low potency typical antipsychotics, such as the aforementioned clozapine and chlorpromazine, can also mediate against potentially distressing movement disorders such as extrapyramidal symptoms and akathisia associated with dopamine antagonism. In fact, clozapine may even help treat movement problems associated with Parkinson's disease. Examples of \\"promiscuous\\" cancer drugs include: Sutent, Sorafenib, Zactima, and AG-013736. In the field of drugs used to treat depression, the nonselective MAOIs and the TCAs are sometimes believed to have an efficacy that is superior to the SSRIs. SSRIs are usually nevertheless picked as the first-line choice of agent and not the (less- selective) MAOIs and TCAs for several reasons. Firstly, SSRIs are safer in overdose than TCAs. Secondly, MAOIs can cause serious side effects when mixed with certain foods, including life-threatening hypertensive crisis. MAOIs and TCAs generally have more side effects than SSRIs. TCAs in particular have anticholinergic side effects such as constipation and blurred vision, whereas SSRIs have fewer anticholinergic side effects.

At the beginning of April 1975, Phnom Penh, one of the last remaining strongholds of the Khmer Republic, was surrounded by the Khmer Rouge and totally dependent on aerial resupply through Pochentong Airport. With a Khmer Rouge victory imminent, the US government made contingency plans for the evacuation of US nationals and allied Cambodians by helicopter to ships in the Gulf of Thailand. Operation Eagle Pull took place on the morning of 12 April 1975 and was a tactical success carried out without any loss of life. Five days later the Khmer Republic collapsed and the Khmer Rouge occupied Phnom Penh. Strangulation of Phnom Penh At the beginning of 1975 the Khmer Republic, a United States-supported military government, controlled only the Phnom Penh area and a string of towns along the Mekong River that provided the crucial supply route for food and munitions coming upriver from South Vietnam. As part of their 1975 dry season offensive, rather than renewing their frontal attacks on Phnom Penh, the Khmer Rouge set out to cut off the crucial Mekong supply route. On 12 January 1975 the Khmer Rouge attacked Neak Luong, a key Khmer National Armed Forces (FANK) defensive outpost on the Mekong. On 27 January, seven vessels limped into Phnom Penh, the survivors of a 16-ship convoy that had come under attack over the journey from the South Vietnamese border. On 3 February a convoy heading downriver hit naval mines laid by the Khmer Rouge at Phu My approximately from Phnom Penh. The FANK naval branch, the Khmer National Navy (MNK), had mine-sweeping capability, but due to the Khmer Rouge control of the riverbanks mine-sweeping was impossible or at best extremely costly. The MNK had lost a quarter of its ships, and 70 percent of its sailors had been killed or wounded. By 17 February, the Khmer Republic abandoned attempts to reopen the Mekong supply line. In future, all supplies for Phnom Penh would have to come in by air to Pochentong Airport. The United States quickly mobilised an airlift of food, fuel and ammunition into Phnom Penh, but as US support for the Khmer Republic was limited by the Case–Church Amendment, BirdAir, a company under contract to the US Government, controlled the airlift with a mixed fleet of C-130 and DC-8 planes, flying 20 times a day into Pochentong. On 5 March, Khmer Rouge artillery at Toul Leap, north-west of Phnom Penh, shelled Pochentong Airport, but FANK troops recaptured Toul Leap on 15 March and ended the shelling. Khmer Rouge forces continued to close in on the north and west of the city and were soon able to fire on Pochentong again. On 22 March rockets hit two supply aircraft, forcing the US Embassy to announce on 23 March a suspension of the airlift until the security situation improved. The Embassy, realizing that the Khmer Republic would soon collapse without supplies, reversed the suspension on 24 March and increased the number of aircraft available for the airlift. On 1 April the Khmer Rouge overran Neak Luong and Ban-am, the last remaining FANK positions on the Mekong. The Communists could now concentrate all their forces on Phnom Penh. Premier Lon Nol resigned that day and went into exile; the final collapse of the Khmer Republic was imminent. Planning Map of Operation Eagle Pull evacuation sites showing the Embassy and LZ Hotel The evacuation plan was developed and refined by the US Military as Khmer Rouge forces closed in on Phnom Penh, starting as early as 1973. On 27 June 1973 the Seventh Air Force published Contingency Plan 5060C \\"Eagle Pull\\" covering the evacuation of Phnom Penh. Conplan 5060C had three options: *Option 1: the evacuation of Embassy personnel, US citizens and designated Cambodians by regular or chartered civilian airlift from Pochentong Airport. *Option 2: if Khmer Rouge action forced the cancellation of civilian flights from Pochentong Airport, security police from the 56th Security Police Squadron at Nakhon Phanom Royal Thai Air Force Base would be flown in to provide security for the evacuation of approximately 600 Embassy personnel, US citizens and designated Cambodians by USAF fixed wing aircraft (and CH-53 and HH-53 helicopters if needed). *Option 3: if Pochentong was closed to traffic the 56th Security Police Squadron would be landed to secure landing zones (LZs) in central Phnom Penh (and other towns if required) for use by CH-53 helicopters of the 21st Special Operations Squadron and HH-53 helicopters of the 40th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron with airborne mission command performed by C-130 King aircraft of the 56th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron. Option 3 was later revised to provide for the use of USMC helicopters together with USAF helicopters and C-130 Airborne Mission Command based in Thailand, and for the ground security force to be made up of marines rather than air force security police. The LZs were to be adjacent to the US Embassy in Phnom Penh. On 6 January 1975, CINCPAC placed the 31st Marine Amphibious Unit on 96-hour alert to move the evacuation fleet into position off Kampong Som (previously Sihanoukville) in the Gulf of Thailand for the implementation of Operation Eagle Pull. On 6 February the reaction time was reduced to 48 hours, meaning that the evacuation fleet had to maintain a 48-hour cruising radius from Kampong Som. This was further reduced on 28 February to 24 hours, effectively meaning that the fleet had to remain within the Gulf of Thailand. On 21 March the Embassy predicted there would be 3,600 evacuees, far exceeding the original estimate of approximately 400. This necessitated the development of a new evacuation plan whereby Marines would secure Pochentong Airport, while helicopters would ferry evacuees from central Phnom Penh to Pochentong from where they would be flown on C-130 planes to Thailand. However, this plan was quickly overtaken by events as the supply C-130s coming into Pochentong were used for evacuees on the return journey, quickly reducing the number of evacuees that would need to be moved in a final evacuation. On 3 April, given the deterioration in the defences around Phnom Penh, Ambassador John Gunther Dean requested the deployment of the 10-man Operation Eagle Pull command element which landed at Pochentong on a BirdAir C-130 plane. The command element supervised the ongoing fixed-wing evacuation of more than 750 Cambodians over the next seven days in the face of 80–90 rounds of 105 mm artillery and 107 mm rocket fire each day. By 10 April Khmer Rouge fire had become so heavy that the fixed-wing evacuation was ended. The command group then turned its attention to the selection of helicopter landing zones for the evacuation. As the Khmer Rouge controlled the east bank of the Mekong opposite Phnom Penh, the command group selected LZ Hotel, a soccer field about north- east of the embassy. Masked from the river by a row of apartment buildings, this LZ could not be interdicted by direct fire weapons, making it the safest location. The embassy staff prepared to leave on 11 April, but the evacuation was delayed until the following day in order to allow to join the evacuation fleet off Kampong Som. Evacuation fleet HMH-462 helicopters and Operation Eagle Pull evacuation fleet On 3 March 1975 Amphibious Ready Group Alpha (Task Group 76.4), and the 31st Marine Amphibious Unit (Task Group 79.4) embarked and arrived at the designated station off Kampong Som in the Gulf of Thailand, the force comprised: Task Group 76.4 (Movement Transport Group Alpha) * carrying HMH-462 comprising 14 CH-53, 3 CH-46, 4 AH-1J, and 2 UH-1E helicopters  Escort ships for naval gunfire, escort, and area defense:   On 17 March the Joint Chiefs of Staff, concerned that one Marine helicopter squadron was insufficient for the evacuation, ordered that USS Hancock offload its air wing and proceed to Pearl Harbor. On 26 March Marine Heavy Lift Helicopter Squadron HMH-463 comprising 25 CH-53, CH-46, AH-1J and UH-1E helicopters embarked on USS Hancock and it proceeded to Subic Bay. After taking on more helicopters at Subic Bay, USS Hancock was temporarily assigned to Amphibious Ready Group Bravo, standing by off Vung Tau, South Vietnam, but on 11 April she joined Amphibious Ready Group Alpha in the Gulf of Thailand. The marine evacuation contingent comprised one battalion landing team, 2nd Battalion, 4th Marines (2/4). As the Khmer Rouge had no air force and only limited anti-aircraft capability, no fleet air cover was necessary, but the evacuation was supported by USAF aircraft based in Thailand. It was suspected that the Khmer Rouge might possess SA-7 shoulder-launched surface to air missiles and so the evacuation helicopters were painted with infra-red low- reflective paint and equipped with ALE-29 flare dispensers. Evacuation On the afternoon of 11 April 1975, the 31st MAU received orders to execute Operation Eagle Pull. At 06:00 on 12 April, 12 CH-53s of HMH-462 launched from the deck of USS Okinawa and then at 10-minute intervals descended again to pick up their marines. Elements of Companies F and H, and the command group embarked from USS Okinawa while elements of Company G boarded their helicopters on USS Vancouver, giving a total ground security force of 360 Marines. As the helicopters completed loading they formed into groups of three orbiting the task force. At 07:30 Ambassador Dean notified the acting Cambodian Chief of State, Prime Minister Long Boret and other Cambodian leaders including Prince Sisowath Sirik Matak, that the US personnel would officially leave the country within the next few hours and asked if any desired evacuation, in which case they should be at the embassy by 09:30. All declined except for Saukham Khoy, successor to Lon Nol as President of the Khmer Republic, who left without telling his fellow leaders. Prince Sirik Matak, a former Prime Minister and a driving force behind the formation of the Khmer Republic rejected the offer of evacuation and said to Ambassador Dean that \\"I have committed this mistake of believing in you, the Americans.\\" The ten-man command group proceeded to drive vehicles to LZ Hotel, purposely disabling them to block vehicle access from any part of the city, other than the road from the Embassy to the LZ. The command group then proceeded to make contact with King Bird, an orbiting HC-130 plane of the 56th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron, that would control the flow of the helicopters. King Bird then cleared in two USAF HH-53 Super Jolly Green Giants, from the 40th Aerospace Rescue and Recovery Squadron, as scheduled, to insert An Air Force Combat Control Team (CCT) to ensure the safe, controlled landings and departures of Marine helicopters to/from the LZ. Small arms fire during this insertion caused minimal damage to the first aircraft, but the CCT was successfully inserted, and the HH-53's departed to aerial refuel in preparation for the final extraction. At 07:43 the first group of helicopters crossed the Cambodian coastline and about one hour later, after traversing of hostile territory, the initial wave set down on LZ Hotel and the Marines quickly established a defensive perimeter. Large crowds of Cambodians soon gathered, more out of curiosity rather than to interfere. Having established the perimeter defense, the marines began the process of moving the crowds back in order to keep the LZ clear and then began moving the evacuee groups to the waiting CH-53 helicopters. As LZ Hotel could only hold three CH-53s at any time, flights arriving after the initial build-up had to be held at Point Oscar, some south of Phnom Penh until called in by \\"King Bird\\". The evacuation proceeded smoothly although the number of evacuees was substantially less than anticipated. The last estimate indicated there would be 590 evacuees, 146 US nationals and 444 Cambodians and third country nationals. HMH-462 evacuated 84 US nationals and 205 Cambodians and third country nationals. At 09:45, the US Embassy closed. There would be no diplomatic relations between the US and Cambodia again until 11 November 1991. By 10:41 all the evacuees including Ambassador Dean and President Saukham Khoy had been lifted out by helicopters of HMH-462. Helicopters of HMH-463 operating from USS Hancock then began to land to extract the ground security force. At approximately 10:50, 107 mm rocket fire began impacting in the vicinity of LZ Hotel. Less than 10 minutes later, the LZ also received 82 mm mortar fire. As soon as the Khmer Rouge fire commenced, the controllers in the zone notified the Air Force forward air controllers (FACs) flying overhead in 23d Tactical Air Support Squadron OV-10s. The FACs immediately made low passes over the east bank of the Mekong, but could not spot any fire coming from known enemy positions in that location. At 10:59, the last element of 2nd Battalion 4th Marines left the zone and the last marine helicopter landed on USS Okinawa at 12:15. At 11:15, the two USAF HH-53 Super Jolly Green Giants returned as scheduled, and successfully extracted the Combat Control Team and the Eagle Pull command element. After the HH-53's had safely departed the city, King Bird cleared the last Air Force HH-53's to depart for Thailand. These three Jolly Green Giants had been flying a precautionary Search and Rescue orbit just north of Phnom Penh during the entire operation in case any of the participating aircraft ran into trouble. As the Jolly Greens turned for home, the lead aircraft was hit by a machine gun round in the tail rotor. Despite severe vibrations the helicopter made it safely back to Ubon Air Base in Thailand. At 14:50 an HMH-462 CH-53 launched from USS Okinawa to carry Ambassador Dean to U-Tapao Air Base in Thailand. On 13 April, the evacuees were flown to U-Tapao Air Base in Thailand on HMH-462 helicopters and Amphibious Ready Group Alpha proceeded to the South China Sea to rendezvous with Task Force 76 as it stood by to implement Operation Frequent Wind, the evacuation of Saigon.

Spencer Tucker, s.v. \\"EAGLE PULL, Operation\\" On 17 April 1975 the Khmer Rouge entered Phnom Penh bringing the Cambodian Civil War to an end. Long Boret, Lon Non and other top officials of the Khmer Republic Government were executed at the Cercle Sportif (ironically now the location of the US Embassy), while FANK troops in the city were disarmed, taken to the Olympic Stadium and executed. For 2/4 Marines and Amphibious Ready Group Alpha, Operation Eagle Pull served as a small-scale dress rehearsal for the more complex Operation Frequent Wind during the Fall of Saigon 17 days later. In popular culture Operation Eagle Pull is depicted in the film The Killing Fields.

His partner is Nadezhda Kutepova, a human rights lawyer and Russian political refugee in France. Post-Soviet Russia In the 1990s, Satter wrote extensively about post-Soviet Russia. In an article in The Wall Street Journal Europe, April 2, 1997, he wrote: \\"When the Soviet Union fell… the moral impulse motivating the democratic movement had to become the basis of Russia’s political practices. The tragedy of the present situation is that Russian gangsters are cutting off this development before it has a chance to take root.\\" Reviews Jack Matlock, the former U.S. ambassador in Moscow, writing in The Washington Post, said that Age of Delirium was \\"spellbinding\\" and gave \\"a visceral sense of what it felt like to be trapped in the communist system.\\" The Virginia Quarterly Review wrote, \\"The brilliance of this book lies in its eccentricity and in the author’s profound knowledge of and sympathy for the suffering of the Russian people under communism.\\" Martin Sieff, writing in the Canadian National Post, wrote that Darkness at Dawn was \\"Vivid, impeccably researched and truly frightening.\\" Angus Macqueen, writing in The Guardian, compared Darkness at Dawn to Putin’s Russia by Anna Politkovskaya.

He argued that this was part of a conspiracy to bring Putin to power as Boris Yeltsin was fading. During testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives, Satter stated: On 14 July 2016, David Satter filed a request to obtain official assessment of who was responsible for the bombings from the State Department, the CIA and the FBI under the Freedom of Information Act. He received response that all documents were classified by US government because \\"that information had the potential ... to cause serious damage to the relationship with the Russian government\\". CIA refused even to acknowledge the existence of any relevant records because doing so would reveal \\"very specific aspects of the Agency's intelligence interest, or lack thereof, in the Russian bombings.\\" According to a cable on the Ryazan incident from the U.S. embassy in Moscow, on 24 March 2000, cited by Satter, \\"a former Russian intelligence officer, apparently one of the embassy's principal informants, said that the real story about the Ryazan incident could never be known because it \\"would destroy the country.\\" The informant said the FSB had \\"a specially trained team of men\\" whose mission was \\"to carry out this type of urban warfare\\", pages 165-171. and Viktor Cherkesov, the FSB's first deputy director and an interrogator of Soviet dissidents was \\"exactly the right person to order and carry out such actions.\\".How America Helped Make Vladimir Putin Dictator for Life by David Satter, 29 August 2017 The latest book by Satter on this subject was The Less You Know, The Better You Sleep: Russia's Road to Terror and Dictatorship under Yeltsin and PutinThe Less You Know, the Better You Sleep: Russia’s Road to Terror and Dictatorship under Yeltsin and Putin by David Satter, Reviewed by Giles Whittell, The Times Documentary films A documentary film about the fall of the Soviet Union based on Satter's book Age of Delirium was completed in 2011.

It was erected as the Vicariate Apostolic of Gilbert Islands in 1897 and elevated to as the Diocese of Tarawa in 1966. There was a name change in 1978 and, in 1982, the diocese was split from the Mission sui iuris of Funafuti. The diocese currently has jurisdiction over all of Kiribati and Nauru.  History  = The first missionaries = The first Christian missionaries to arrive in the Gilbert Islands were Protestants from Hawaii and New England, the first of whom arrived in November 1857. The most notable of these missionaries was Hiram Bingham II, a Congregationalist minister and son of Hiram Bingham I, an early missionary in Hawaii. Bingham and his wife translated the Bible into Gilbertese, wrote school books, and authored a major dictionary (published posthumously), before leaving the islands in the early 1860s due to ill health. In addition to Bingham's conversions, many of the Gilbertese natives had been taken by blackbirders in the 1870s to work on plantations on other islands in the Pacific, where they were met by Catholic missionaries. Two of these converted laborers, Betero and Tiroi, returned to Nonouti and instructed the local people about Catholicism. They built eight small churches, where people of different villages assembled each Sunday to sing hymns and recite prayers. By 1888, Betero and Tiroi had already baptized 560 people and were instructing and additional 600. As the number of Catholics grew, the two men wrote letters to many Catholic bishops requesting missionaries and priests. = Arrival of Catholic priests = In response to a letter Betero and Tiroi sent to Samoa, three members of the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart, Father E. Bontemps, Father Joseph Leray, and Brother Conrad Weber, left in a tiny schooner from Sydney in 1887 and arrived on Nonouti on the Feast of the Ascension, 10 May 1888. They anchored at the entrance of a wide, shallow lagoon, and took a dinghy to land on shore, where a crowd of local people were waiting. The trip to the shore was taking several hours, so the two priests decided to celebrate Mass on the dinghy some distance from land as it was close to midday. So the first Catholic Mass on the Gilbert Islands took place on a dinghy in the Nonouti lagoon. When the missionaries arrived on shore, they visited the church, which they found to be large and well built, and already equipped with an altar, altar cloth, and crucifix. The following morning, on Good Friday, Mass was celebrated in the church, supplemented by Gilbertese hymns and prayers. After Mass, a statue of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart was placed in a visible location. = Arrival of religious sisters = In 1892, Father Bontemps, accompanied by two young Gilbertese men, left for Europe on a trip to gain assistance for the Gilbert Islands mission. They visited Rome, and in 1894 visited Issoudun, France, where the Daughters of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart, the sister congregation of the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart, had their convent. Bontemps asked the Superior General, Mother Marie Louise, for sisters for the Gilbert Islands. Marie Louise had long been a loyal helper of the Missionaries, but in this case she hesitated due to the exceptional isolation of the Gilbert Islands. However, she hesitantly agreed and named seven sisters, the oldest of whom was 25, to be sent to the islands. Bontemps and the sisters left Issoudun in April 1895, and on the return trip stopped for a short stay with the sisters at Kensington, Australia. They also stopped in Sydney, where two more sisters joined them, bringing the total to nine. They arrived at the Gilbert Islands in August, after a difficult journey on the Archer, an old, slow, and unsteady ship, which had to be used because nobody wanted to risk a new ship in such rough and reef-strewn seas. On 28 June 1897, it was established as Apostolic Vicariate of the Gilbert Islands (Insularum Gilbertinarum in Latin) from Apostolic Vicariate of New Pomerania. = Poverty and hostility from Protestants = Upon their arrival, both material and social conditions were difficult for the sisters. The sisters, who were active in education, faced much opposition from the Protestant teachers. In addition, they faced stark poverty. Upon the sisters' arrival at the mission house where the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart were living and where the sisters were to live, they found a kitchen equipped only with two small saucepans, a few plates, and a single spoon, to serve 12 missionaries. There were no cups or glasses, so the missionaries drank out of jam tins. They lived off of coconuts, taros, fish, black coffee, brown sugar, biscuits, boiled rice, tinned beans, and salted meat. Condensed milk and bread were treats saved for Sundays and feast days. The extreme heat, in addition to malnourishment and disease, caused a number of deaths during the early years; however, it took four months or longer for the news of this to reach Europe. A second group of sisters arrived on Nonouti on 2 February 1899. Conditions were still very primitive and poor. During the sisters' early years in the Gilbert Islands, the young Superior, Mother Mary Isabel, as well as the priests, often traveled from Nonouti, the mission headquarters, to visit newly established missions on other islands in the chain. These voyages were hazardous and often very exciting. On one occasion, Mother M. Isabel and Father Bontemps left Nonouti to visit a nearby island, but after two weeks of battling against wind and strong currents, landed in Nauru, 100 kilometers off course. The island's administrator invited them to come ashore, which Bontemps agreed to do the next morning. However, during the night, the current carried their vessel off to the Caroline Islands. There they were welcomed ashore by Spanish Capuchin missionaries, and were just in time for a feast and baptism of the native king and queen. Mother M. Isabel was given the honor of being godmother. After several days they set out for the Gilbert Islands, and sighted Nonouti on 27 June 1897 after an absence of five months. In addition to material difficulties the missionaries faced, they faced hostile opposition from Protestants, at that time the dominant and established faith. Some of the inhabitants of the southern island of Nikunau asked for missionaries, so the next year a priest and two sisters were sent. They faced fierce opposition from the island's Protestants. Upon their arrival, they were forbidden to go ashore, a command which they disobeyed at risk of their safety. They were left stranded on the beach, with the few possessions they had amidst a crowd of hostile people. Nobody gave them any assistance until dusk, when a European trader took pity on them and allowed them to spend the night on his veranda. The next day the sisters went out to collect materials to build their house. The local policeman threatened imprisonment to anyone who would work with the missionaries, so they had to do the labor themselves. However, several years later conditions had improved to the point where the sisters were able to found a boarding school for girls. = 20th century = The Catholic mission's first inter-island ship was launched in 1938. It was built on the island of Abemama and was named Santa Teretia. Previously in 1894 the mission had bought a small ship, the Maris Stella, but it was sold in 1910 to help the mission through financial difficulty. Before 1894 and from 1910 to 1938 the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart had to rely on passing ships carrying copra or cargo in order to reach the various islands. The new ship was sold to a local company in 1950 and a larger ship, also named Santa Teretia, was bought from an Australian company. The new ship went aground in Nauru during a storm and could not be refloated. A third ship was bought, which also was sunk on a reef of one of the southern islands. In 1970 airstrips were built on most of the outer islands which made travel much more convenient for the priests and sisters. On 21 June 1966, the Vicariate Apostolic of Gilbert Islands, of Bishop Pierre Guichet, vicariate which had existed since 1897, was elevated as the Diocese of Tawara. On 15 November 1978, its name was changed to the Diocese of Tarawa, Nauru and Funafuti, and on 10 September 1982, was changed to the Diocese of Tarawa and Nauru. During the 20th century, the number of active clergy and religious sisters in the diocese grew quickly. In 1950, Bishop Octave Terrienne founded an indigenous congregation called the Sisters of St. Therese. And, in 1960, several indigenous girls asked to join the Daughters of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart and were sent to study at the sisters' Australian novitiate. As there were not many Sisters of St. Therese, they asked to join the Daughters of the Sacred Heart, and the merger happened in 1968. In 1976 the Daughters of the Sacred Heart established a novitiate in the Gilbertine Islands. By 1970, there were nearly 25,000 Catholics in the diocese, nearly 45% of the population. By 2015 Census, Catholics made up 57% of the total population of Kiribati, numbering 63,116.2015 Census Ordinaries # Joseph Leray, MSC (27 July 1897 – 1926) # Joseph Bach, MSC (26 January 1927 – 27 December 1933) # Octave Terrienne, MSC (2 December 1937 – 28 February 1961) # Pierre Guichet, MSC (19 July 1961 – 15 November 1978) # Paul Mea, MSC (15 November 1978 – 29 June 2020) # Koru Tito (29 June 2020 – present)  References  Tarawa and Nauru Category:Catholic Church in Nauru ","title":"Roman Catholic Diocese of Tarawa and Nauru"},{"id":"8884128","text":"The Gospel Broadcasting Network (GBN) is an American Christian satellite broadcast network, which broadcasts 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

History The term rumpology is a neologism. The late American astrologer Jackie Stallone claimed that rumpology is known to have been practiced in ancient times by the Babylonians, the Indians, and the Ancient Greeks and Romans, although she provides no evidence for this claim. Stallone has been largely responsible for the supposed \\"revival\\" of rumpology in modern times. Theory and practice Rumpologists have a variety of theories as to the meaning of different posterior characteristics. According to Stallone, the left and right buttocks reveal a person's past and future, respectively, although she has also commented that \\"The crack of your behind corresponds to the division of the two hemispheres of the brain\\". According to blind German clairvoyant and rumpologist Ulf Beck, an \\"apple-shaped, muscular bottom indicates someone who is charismatic, dynamic, very confident and often creative. A person who enjoys life. A pear-shaped bottom suggests someone very steadfast, patient and down-to-earth.\\" The British rumpologist Sam Amos claims that \\"A round bottom indicates the person is open, happy and optimistic in life. However, a flat bottom suggests the person is rather vain and is negative and sad.\\" Rumpology can be performed either by sight, touch or by using buttock prints. In addition to live readings, Jackie Stallone will perform buttock readings using e-mailed digital photographs, and has claimed to predict the outcome of Presidential elections and Oscar awards by reading the bottoms of her two pet Doberman Pinschers. Ulf Buck claims he can read people's futures by feeling their naked buttocks.

The 22-metre-high tower was built by a Jain merchant Jeeja Bhagerwala during the reign of Rawal Kumar Singh (c. 1179 – 1191) for the glory of Jainism.  History  Chittor has a history going back several centuries. It was an ancient centre of Jain tradition. Chittor is adjacent to the ancient city of Madhyamika. The Jain inscriptions at Mathura from the Kushana period (1st to 3rd centuries) mention a \\"Majjhimilla\\" branch of the \\"Kottiya\\" gana, indicating that it was a major Jain centre. The famous Acharya Haribhadra Suri (6th century) was born in Chittor and wrote \\"Dhurtopakhyana\\" there. There was a scholar Elacharya at Chittor from whom Vira-senacharya (9th century) learned the ancient Shat- khandagama and Kashayapahuda. Vira-senacharya later wrote the famous \\"Dhavala\\" and \\"Jayadhavala\\" on the basis of these books. It was the residence of Jinavallabha who propagated the Vidhimarga in the 12th century. From the 15th to 17th centuries, it was the seat of a Bhattaraka. The tower is built in the Solanki style. It is 30 feet wide at the base and narrows down to 15 feet at the top. Three inscriptions have been found that mention Jija of Bagherwal community as the builder of the stambha.Jain Shilalekh Samgrah, Part 5, Vidyadhar Johrapurkar, Bharatiya Jnanapith, 1971 One of the inscriptions mention Dharmakirti, the disciple of Shubhakirti, who was disciple of Vasantkirti. According to the Balatkara Gana Pattavali, Dharmakirti headed the patta during 1224-1257 AD. Thus the structure dates from the 13th century, although an unrelated Jain inscription of 896 AD was found in the vicinity.Niraj Jain, Chittor Darshan, Vira Nivan Granth prakasha Samiti, 1980 Kirti Stambha is older than another tower in the same fort, known as the Vijay Stambha (Tower of Victory).

It was last active with Air Defense Command, assigned to First Air Force at Gunter Air Force Base, Alabama, where it was inactivated on 31 December 1969. The division was first activated by Continental Air Command in November 1949 at Stewart Air Force Base, New York. It controlled air defense units in the northeastern United States from Stewart, and later from Hancock Field, New York until being inactivated in August 1958. The division was activated again in November 1958 at Dobbins Air Force Base, Georgia to provide air defense of the southeastern United States, moving to Oklahoma City Air Force Station, Oklahoma in 1961. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, it was the primary air defense command for potential attacks from Cuba, acting through its Montgomery Air Defense Sector and a provisional organization at Key West Naval Air Station. The division was inactivated in September 1963. In April 1966, the 32d was again activated at Gunter, where it replaced the Montgomery Air Defense Sector. At Gunter, it also reported to North American Air Defense Command (NORAD) as the 32d NORAD Region. It was again responsible for air defense in the Southeast until 1969, when its mission, personnel and equipment were transferred to the 20th Air Division.

Initially, it assumed responsibility for an area including Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and part of New York. =Cuban Missile Crisis= During the Cuban Missile Crisis, as the division responsible for defense of the area nearest Cuba, the division role expanded. In addition to defense of its area of responsibility, the division (acting largely through its Montgomery Air Defense Sector and Task Force 32, which was established for Continental Air Defense Command and included an operating location at Key West Naval Air Station, Florida) was responsible to defend staging bases and routes to possible drop zones in Cuba for troop carrier units.NORAD/CONAD Participation in the Cuban Missile Crisis, pp. 2, 15 Radar warning capabilities were increased. Four destroyers in the Straits of Florida, whose primary mission was to provide navigation guidance to potential strike aircraft, began to provide low altitude radar coverage as a secondary mission on 23 October, and the was added as a picket ship. The number of Lockheed EC-121 Warning Star airborne early warning and control aircraft at McCoy Air Force Base, Florida was increased from three to six.

It is defined as the stretch of roadway between the Spencer Offramp and Marin City, within the city of Sausalito.Caltrans definitions of highway segments in District Four This grade is traversed by a full freeway multi-lane highway facility. This portion of US 101/SR 1 is an important link in surface transportation connecting the city of San Francisco to Marin County and the North Bay. Nearby locations to the Waldo Grade include: the city of Sausalito, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Bay Model, The Marine Mammal Center and the Golden Gate National Recreation Area. It, and nearby Waldo Point along Richardson Bay between Sausalito and Mill Valley, is named after 1850s California politician William Waldo. Robin Williams Tunnel A tunnel officially known as the Robin Williams Tunnel (previously and informally referred to as the Waldo Tunnel) is located at the highest elevation on US 101/SR 1 along the Waldo Grade. The first bore of the tunnel was completed in 1937 and the second in 1954. The archways at the south-facing ends of the bores were painted in rainbows by a Caltrans employee, Robert Halligan, and for this reason the tunnel is sometimes unofficially referred to as the Rainbow Tunnel. After the suicide of actor Robin Williams in 2014, a petition was started on change.org to rename the Waldo Tunnel as the Robin Williams Tunnel, because Williams is credited with leading San Francisco's comedy renaissance. A bill submitted by California Assemblyman Marc Levine after consulting with Williams' family passed the California State Assembly in April 2015 on a vote of 77-0, and the State Senate in June 2015 on a vote of 37-0. The official sign was installed in 2016. View of Golden Gate Bridge for southbound traffic on Redwood Highway at the southern portal of the Robin Williams Tunnel (2014) As San Francisco and the Golden Gate Bridge are hidden from the northern approach of US 101/SR 1 by hills, automobile travelers heading south along this route get their first views of the city and its iconic bridge upon exiting the tunnel's southbound bore. 1982 landslides On January 4–5, 1982, the freeway was completely closed for 24 hours as a result of two landslides on the Waldo Grade caused by a severe storm in the San Francisco Bay area, and partially closed for nearly two weeks. The first landslide was on January 4, with rock, mud and trees falling onto the highway blocking the southbound lanes and two of the northbound lanes. A second debris avalanche began about below the freeway at about 9:35pm on January 5, in fill material that had been stable since highway construction in 1953. The slide first carried away a house on Sausalito Boulevard, and then destroyed a house below it at 85 Crescent Avenue, killing resident Sally Baum. Three hundred residents were evacuated to a Red Cross shelter. A crack developed in the roadway and, concerned that the highway might fail, CalTrans engineers closed all northbound lanes for twelve days while the road was reinforced with vertical pilings. The closure cut Marin County off from the San Francisco Peninsula. Thousands of Marin County residents were stranded in San Francisco who could not figure out how to get to Marin by using the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge I-580 or the bus lines that serve Marin from the East Bay. Some of the earth from the landslide was later transported to Mill Valley to create a building pad for the Shelter Point office complex.Environmental Screening Analysis, Shelterpoint Office Center, Mill Valley, California, Earth Metrics Inc. Report # 10179, September 20, 1989 In fiction The tunnel is featured in the Clint Eastwood film Dirty Harry and the Humphrey Bogart film Dark Passage. The honking of horns in the tunnel, often done deliberately for the sake of hearing the echoes, was the inspiration for harmonicist Bruce \\"Creeper\\" Kurnow's composition \\"Honk If You Love Harmonica.\\" In the film Bicentennial Man (starring Robin Williams), a futuristic view of a relocated highway bypasses the historic Waldo Grade.Bicentennial Man film storyboards At the beginning of the 2015 Pixar film Inside Out, the main character's family moves from Minnesota to San Francisco. Their first view of the Golden Gate Bridge - and the film's title card - appear as they emerge from the Robin Williams Tunnel, with real-life geography slightly altered to bring the bridge closer to the tunnel exit.

It is also his last studio album as he died on May 2 while recording it, and the only one released under the name hide with Spread Beaver. It is his best-selling album, reaching number 2 on the Oricon chart and having sold over 1.4 million copies. It was also named \\"Rock Album of the Year\\" at the 13th Japan Gold Disc Awards, while its single \\"Pink Spider\\" was named \\"Song of the Year\\". Overview It is the only full-length record to be released under the hide with Spread Beaver name; hide had retitled his solo project to formally include his live band. It was completed without him, due to his death on May 2, 1998. Although all songs are credited to hide, his ultimate level of involvement in the finished product is not entirely clear. In June 1998, Zilch bassist Paul Raven said in an interview: \\"He was under a lot of pressure to finish his solo record. He had three songs completed the day before he died, and now mysteriously a full album is coming out nine days before ours.\\" However, hide's brother and manager Hiroshi wrote in his 2010 book Brothers: Recollections of hide that at the time of his death hide had six out of ten songs finished for Ja, Zoo. This is supported by the fact that I.N.A is credited with additional arrangement on four songs. The album's release was eventually postponed until November 21, 1998, with Zilch's debut album 3.2.1. released on July 23, 1998 and including the song \\"Inside the Pervert Mound\\" which is an English version of \\"Leather Face\\". Eric Westfall, one of the album's recording and mixing engineers, revealed that a week or so after hide's death, he and I.N.A had an emotionally difficult time finishing the album as televisions they had on in the studio were still showing footage of and talking about the dead musician. He said that I.N.A had a particularly difficult task with the vocals for \\"Hurry Go Round\\", which were not fully recorded and have a \\"heavy\\" or somber lyrical theme to them. Westfall went on to state that hide's work is the best material he has ever worked on. A song called \\"Co Gal\\" was originally demoed for Ja, Zoo but was not completed following hide's death. Sixteen years later, the song was finished and commercially released after Yamaha utilized their Vocaloid technology to mimic the deceased musician's voice. Reception Upon its release, Ja, Zoo reached number 2 on the Oricon album chart. When it was re-released on the Japan only format SHM-CD on December 3, 2008, it only reached number 248. By the end of 1998, Ja, Zoo sold 686,290 copies, becoming the 40th best-selling album of the year. It sold an additional 722,080 by the end of 1999, making it the 34th best-selling album of that year. With total sells over 1,408,270 copies, it was certified million by the RIAJ. Together with the sales of both singles and albums in 1998 hide sold over 3,820,720 copies, and if merged with 1999, over 4,542,800 in total.

ABCB5 is an ABC transporter and P-glycoprotein family member principally expressed in physiological skin and human malignant melanoma.  Clinical significance  ABCB5 has been suggested to regulate skin progenitor cell fusion and mediate chemotherapeutic drug resistance in stem-like tumor cell subpopulations in human malignant melanoma. It is commonly over-expressed on circulating melanoma tumour cells. Furthermore, the ABCB5+ melanoma- initiating cells were demonstrated to express FLT1 (VEGFR1) receptor tyrosine kinase which was functionally required for efficient xenograft tumor formation, as demonstrated by shRNA knockdown experiments. In colorectal cancer, ABCB5 was shown to act as a mediator of 5-FU patient chemoresistance, and had a further direct role in tumorigenesis shown by shRNA-mediated colorectal cancer cell-line ABCB5 knockdowns that impeded tumorigenesis in human-to-mouse xenografts. In melanoma, ABCB5 contributes to multi-drug chemotherapy resistance, and tumor growth, controlling a proinflammatory signaling circuit utilizing TLR4, IL-1β, IL8 and CXCR1 signaling involving reciprocal paracrine interactions between the melanoma stem cell and tumor bulk population (in a rheostat manner termed \\"cancer stem cell rheostasis\\"). ABCB5 was shown to maintain the slow-cycling melanoma stem cells using this cytokine signaling loop, which became more differentiated upon ABCB5 interference (e.g. WFDC1 melanocyte differentiation marker increased, cancer cells were faster growing in vitro, tumors were more pigmented), or CXCR1 blockade (slow-cycling ABCB5+ cells entered the cell-cycle). In normal physiology ABCB5 is a functional marker for adult limbal stem cells of the cornea. ABCB5+ cells could regrow a human cornea on a mouse with limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD - a blindness disease of the corneal limbus) while ABCB5- cells could not, indicating a therapeutic potential for treating some types of blindness. ABCB5 was further shown to be anti-apoptotic in these adult stem cells.

Synopsis An old childless couple loved their dog. One day, it dug in the garden, and they found a box of gold coins there. A neighbor thought the dog must have the ability to find treasure, and managed to borrow the dog. When it dug in his garden, there were only bones, so he killed the dog in rage. He told the couple that the dog had just dropped dead. They grieved and buried it under the fig tree where they had found the treasure. One night, the dog's master dreamed that the dog told him to chop down the tree and make a mortar from it. He told his wife, who said they must do as the dog asked. When they did, the rice put into the mortar turned into gold. The neighbor borrowed it, but the rice turned to foul-smelling berries, and he and his wife smashed and burned the mortar. That night, in a dream, the dog told his master to take the ashes and sprinkle them on certain cherry trees. When he did, the cherry trees came into bloom, and the daimyō (feudal landlord), passing by, marveled and gave him many gifts. The neighbor tried to do the same, but the ashes blew into the daimyō's eyes, so he threw him into prison; when he was let out, his village would not let him live there anymore, and he could not, with his wicked ways, find a new home.

Located in Manhattan's East Village, the theatre began in the basement boutique where Stewart sold her fashion designs. Stewart turned the space into a theatre at night, focusing on the work of young playwrights. La MaMa has evolved during its fifty-year history into a world-renowned cultural institution. Background Stewart started La MaMa as a theatre dedicated to the playwright and primarily producing new plays, including works by Paul Foster, Jean-Claude van Itallie, Lanford Wilson, Sam Shepard, Adrienne Kennedy, Harvey Fierstein, and Rochelle Owens. La MaMa also became an international ambassador for Off-Off-Broadway theatre by touring downtown theatre abroad during the 1960s.Bottoms, Steven J. Playing Underground: A Critical History of the 1960s Off-Off-Broadway Movement. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2004. La MaMa is the only theatre of the 1960s Off-Off-Broadway movement's four core theatres that continues to thrive today. The other three Off-Off-Broadway theatres that composed this core included Joe Cino's Caffe Cino, Al Carmines' Judson Poets Theatre, and Ralph Cook's Theatre Genesis. More than any other Off-Off-Broadway producer, Stewart reached out beyond the East Village, forcing rather than following new trends in theatre and performance. To the present, La MaMa's mission is dedicated to \\"the people who make art, and it is to them that we give our support with free theatre and rehearsal space, lights, sound, props, platforms, and whatever else we have that they can use to create their work. We want them to feel free to explore their ideas, and translate them into a theatrical language that can communicate to any person in any part of the world.\\"  Beginnings: Ellen Stewart and the pushcart  > Ellen Stewart is the spirit of La MaMa; she is its guardian, janitor, > fundraiser, press agent, tour manager, conceptual leader—she is the guts of > the place. To understand this theatre one must first know Ellen > Stewart.Poland, Albert, & Mailman, Bruce (editors). The Off Off Broadway > Book: The Plays, People, Theatres. New York: Bobbs-Merrill Company Inc., > 1972. Stewart worked as a fashion designer at Saks Fifth Avenue before starting the theatre. Stewart was inspired by her mentor, \\"Papa Abraham Diamonds,\\" who owned a fabric shop on the Lower East Side. Diamonds told Stewart that everyone needs both a \\"pushcart to serve others\\" and their own personal pushcart. Stewart had a revelation about this advice during a trip she took to Morocco and decided to open a boutique for her fashion designs that would also serve as a theatre for her foster brother, playwright Fred Lights, and his fellow playwright Paul Foster.Crespy, David A. Off-Off-Broadway Explosion: How Provocative Playwrights of the 1960s Ignited a New American Theater. New York: Back Stage Books, 2003. On October 18, 1961, Stewart paid the fifty-five dollar rent on a tenement basement at 321 East Ninth Street to start her boutique and theater.  As an Off-Off-Broadway theatre  =A theatre for the playwright= As opposed to Caffe Cino, which was focused on creating a specific atmosphere or clientele, La MaMa's primary focus was on the playwright. Stewart was interested in the people behind the work, and often didn't even read the plays. She relied on what she called \\"beeps,\\" or \\"clicks,\\" a hunch or feeling she got when meeting people and deciding whether or not to produce work with them. In the early years, Stewart housed and fed playwrights and directors whenever possible.Rosenthal, Cindy. \\"Ellen Stewart: La MaMa of Us All.\\" TDR: The Drama Review, Volume 50, Number 2 (T190), Summer 2006: 28-32. Retrieved from Project Muse. Columbia University Library, November 2, 2010. She acted as a mother; Jean-Claude van Itallie remembers his first meeting with Stewart: > I never could have expected the warmth of Ellen's milk. She basically said > to me, \\"Honey, you're home. This space is for you to put on plays.\\" The > combination of her kindness and her smile and the beauty of the space were > overwhelming ...

Retrieved from ProQuest. > Columbia University Library, November 2, 2010. Not only did Stewart create a nurturing environment for the playwright, but La MaMa's space itself was an appealing blank canvas in its early years. van Itallie said of the space, \\"it imposed no aesthetic, made no artistic suggestions.\\" For this among other reasons, La MaMa was considered by many playwrights to be the most inviting of the Off-Off-Broadway theatres. In 1963, Stewart created a policy of exclusively presenting new plays, producing a new play each week. She also began ringing a bell before each production, welcoming the audience with, \\"Welcome to La MaMa dedicated to the playwright and all aspects of the theatre. Tonight we present ...\\" Stewart believed that young playwrights needed the ability to explore without the fear of professional criticism too early in their career, and that new playwrights shouldn't be critiqued in the same way as more experienced playwrights. Stewart said that playwrights who didn't feel they had the experience to make work at Caffe Cino would come to La MaMa instead. By producing their work, Stewart was creating a space for new playwrights to learn from practical, collaborative experiences. = La MaMa and Caffe Cino = Stewart did not believe that her theater was an imitation of Cino's. Cino and Stewart had a close relationship, and the first documented production at La MaMa, (One Arm, July 27, 1962, an adaptation of a Tennessee Williams story, transferred from Caffe Cino. Perhaps the best way to understand Cino and Stewart's relationship is to consider their different models of producing plays. Cino rarely extended a run, as he didn't want to affect the next play's opening. If playwrights wanted longer runs and more exposure for a popular play, they went to La MaMa. There was an unspoken agreement between Cino and Stewart that the plays produced at either theatre could continue to a second run at the other. When Caffe Cino burned down in 1966, La MaMa hosted benefit shows to aid in the theatre's reopening. Joe Cino's family offered Stewart the theatre after his death in 1967, but she declined.  Early history  = 321 E. 9th Street: Café La MaMa = La MaMa's first home, the basement at 321 East Ninth Street, was renovated over a period of nine months. During this time, the neighbors became concerned about the different men visiting at various times to work on the space. Moreover, as an African-American woman, Stewart was not welcomed into the neighborhood. Barbara Lee Horn writes: > Now, number 321 had been an all white building, and the tenants liked it > that way. Further provoked by the comings and goings, they accused Stewart > of running a bordello—fifteen men in one hour—and asked the health > department to issue a summons for prostitution.Horn, Barbara Lee. Ellen > Stewart and La MaMa: A Bio-Bibliography. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood > Press, 1993. The health department was contacted, but the inspector who arrived happened to be an old vaudevillian. He advised Stewart that getting a license to open a coffeehouse was much easier than getting a license to open a theatre. Following this advice, La MaMa became Café La MaMa. Coffee and cake were served, admission was free, and any compensation that the actors received came from \\"passing the hat.\\" Stewart's fashion designs and seamstress jobs subsidized the theatre during its first decade of operation. The first space was twenty by thirty feet with earthy red walls. The café sat twenty-five people and the dirt floor was planked with orange crates. There was one set piece: a bed. Stewart's initial intention of using the space as a boutique during the daytime quickly disappeared. As Stewart said, \\"Once our theatre got started, I didn't have the discipline to sew. I was too busy doing other things - not writing or directing - but just doing theatre.\\" The plays ran for one week, from Wednesday-Saturday, and major theatre critics did not come. Even operating as a \\"café,\\" Café La MaMa was forced to close and reopen ten times during its first year. Although the neighbors' fears concerning Stewart's supposed brothel had been quelled, fire inspectors often found violations at the theatre, which created serious legal problems. Stewart herself was arrested twice, and several other times under another alias. Issues with fire-code violations at Café La MaMa's first basement location led Stewart to search for a new space. In 1963, the Café was closed by the Buildings Department due to a zoning violation. = 82 2nd Avenue: La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club = Café La MaMa moved into its second home, a loft above a florist shop at 82 Second Avenue, on June 28, 1963. One month after opening, Stewart was informed by the Buildings Department that she had to vacate this new space because she was making a profit from serving coffee. Stewart stopped serving coffee and began charging an admission of fifty cents. On March 12, 1964, Café La MaMa was officially renamed La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club (La MaMa E.T.C). The \\"passing of the hat\\" ended with this transition from café to a members-only club. Even operating as a club, this space was often visited by civic authorities, frequently interrupting performances. This second space was approximately five times larger than the first space and sat up to seventy-four people. The ceilings were twenty by fifty feet high and there was a one-step stage that was twenty by eight feet. 82 Second Avenue is where La MaMa E.T.C. truly became a theater. During this time, playwrights Lanford Wilson and Sam Shepard began producing plays at La MaMa. This was also where Stewart started her tradition of sitting outside on La MaMa's steps during performances to ensure that civic authorities didn't interrupt. Because of building code violations, La MaMa was forced to relocate again in November 1964. All of these relocations were initiated by the Buildings Department inspector, who would contact the Fire Department, who would then contact the Police Department to issue a summons for Stewart's arrest. In order to avoid a third conviction, which would have made her a felon, Stewart moved La MaMa to a new space with the audience's help. Stewart recalled: > It was the closing performance of Balls, Paul Foster's play. There must have > been 35 people who came to see the play. Many of them had never been there > before, I told them just to strike the café. Many didn't know what I meant, > but they all saw the others picking up chairs and tables. Everybody picked > something up and followed me down the street. We took everything, paintings, > tables, chairs, coffeepots—everything. Well, they moved me in one hour. The audience followed Stewart to the second floor of 122 Second Avenue, La MaMa's third home. = 122 2nd Avenue = On November 11, 1964, La MaMa E.T.C. opened at 122 Second Avenue with David Novak's The Wedding Panda. This space was twenty-three by seventy-five feet with a twelve-foot ceiling; the stage at the back was twenty-three by ten feet. The seating capacity was technically seventy-four, but the theatre would often fit 115 people at a time. This new, larger space attracted artists who had previously worked at other tiny Off- Off-Broadway venues but were ready for a larger space. Lanford Wilson's Balm in Gilead, which needed a stage that could accommodate twenty-five people, and was also the first full-length play written for off-off Broadway, opened at 122 Second Avenue in January 1965. Partially due to previous legal struggles, the performances at 122 Second Avenue were primarily publicized by word of mouth. The theatre had no sign; the street-level door was labeled \\"122 Delivery Entrance.\\" There were weekly listings of the productions in the Village Voice, but an address or a phone number was never listed. Only members could attend, and one had to visit 122 2nd Avenue in person to become a member. By 1967, La MaMa E.T.C. had an estimated three thousand members. La MaMa E.T.C. officially became a nonprofit organization in 1967. La MaMa remained at this third location until 1967. This period was crucial to La MaMa's establishment and audience development. La MaMa moved for a final time when the lease on 122 2nd Avenue expired in April 1968. = 74A East 4th Street = The second floor at St. Mark's Place served as a transitional space for La MaMa from January through March 1969. On April 2, 1969, Stewart purchased the building at 74A East 4th Street using grant money from the Ford, Rockefeller, and Doris Duke Foundations.Citation error. See inline comment how to fix. The ground floor of 74A E. 4th is a theatre which seats one hundred people. Originally called the La Mama Repertory Theatre, the theatre is now called the First Floor Theatre. The second-floor space is a cabaret called the La MaMa Experimental Club with the capacity to seat seventy-five.Citation error. See inline comment how to fix. With additional funding, the third floor became a rehearsal space and workshop. Finally, the top floor was turned into an apartment for Stewart. In 1970, a decaying seven-story loft building at 47 Great Jones Street was purchased for additional rehearsal space, using money from the Ford Foundation.Citation error. See inline comment how to fix. = 236 East 3rd Street = In June 1971, La MaMa, a fairly new experimental theater company, founded by Ellen Stewart, acquired 236 East 3rd and other abandoned buildings on the Lower East Side to turn them into art spaces. No. 236 was used primarily for community workshops, in an effort to engage and produce art that was reflective and representative of the surrounding neighborhood. The children's workshops spearheaded by avant-garde jazz drummer Charles “Bobo” Shaw, were some of the most ambitious. A letter to Ellen Stewart in 1973 indicates that the end goal of the space and programming was to establish a Hispanic theater center. Obviously, a goal that was spirited by the future occupants of this location. The Nuyorican Poets Cafe purchased the building 1985. Throughout the 1970s, La MaMa's 236 E. 3rd location became a centerpiece of the Loft Jazz movement with dozens of renowned and budding musicians traversing this space to gather and rehearse. The hallmark of this period was when, in 1979, trumpeter Lester Bowie rehearsed his Sho'Nuff Orchestra in preparing for a onetime performance of a 59-member contemporary jazz collective, a gathering reflective of the “Great Day in Harlem” photoshoot. Of great help during this period was the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act. In 1978 Stewart utilized CETA funds to mount Goethe’s Faust I, directed by Fritz Bennewitz. CETA enabled the hiring of 22 actors, an 8-person chorus, 6 musicians, dancers and an 18-member crew. Millar,Hillary, Drop Dead: Performance in Crisis, 1970s New York, Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 2016 CETA also funded a series of Chamber Concerts, as well as the La MaMa-Ceta Jazz Cabaret. = 66 East 4th Street = In 1974, La MaMa purchased 66 E. 4th Street, which is two doors down from 74A E. 4th. Initially referred to as the Annex, 66 E. 4th includes a flexible theatre space with a seating capacity of 299 as well as an upper floor dormitory for visiting artists. This space had previously served as a forty-eight by one hundred feet television soundstage with thirty-footy high ceilings. In 2009, the Annex was renamed the Ellen Stewart Theatre.  International presence and influence  To date, La MaMa has presented and produced work by artists from over seventy nations. = Early European tours = While frequently moving locations in Manhattan, La MaMa was also traveling internationally. Stewart wanted broad publicity for her playwrights but she wasn't finding this in the United States, due partially to La MaMa's \\"hit or miss quality\\" and partially to the short runs of productions. Critics also found it difficult to determine the \\"dedicated devotion to novelty\\" of La MaMa productions. Upon hearing that Danish and other European countries would review most productions seen in their cities, Stewart decided to establish a reputation in Europe so that the United States would take more notice. In the fall of 1965, with twenty-two plays and sixteen young actors, La MaMa had its first European tour. La MaMa had two traveling companies. The first company, headed by Tom O'Horgan, went to Copenhagen for six weeks and was well-received. The Danish audience was interested in the company's passion and energy, and La MaMa was invited back the following year. The other company, led by Ross Alexander, went to Paris for six weeks. Unfortunately, the French audience found Jean-Claude van Itallie's America Hurrah obscene and the reviews were negative. Still, this first tour achieved its goal; La MaMa returned to New York with several positive Danish reviews. La MaMa had its second European tour from September–December 1966, again with O'Horgan and with ten actors. A third European tour took place from June–November 1967. = Cultural ambassador = The La MaMa companies did not only bring La MaMa plays to Europe but also brought plays that were first presented at other Off-Off-Broadway venues. These included Home Free!, The Madness of Lady Bright, and Miss. Victoria from Caffe Cino, as well as Birdbath and Chicago from Theatre Genesis. Thus, La MaMa acted as \\"international ambassadors, not just for La MaMa, but for new Village playwriting generally.\\" La MaMa has extended past these European tours, with satellite La MaMa theatres opening over the years in Boston, Amsterdam, Bogotá, Israel, London, Melbourne, Morocco, Munich, Paris, Tokyo, Toronto, and Vienna. As of 2006, only a few continued to carry the La MaMa name, including La MaMa Bogotá, La MaMa Tel Aviv, and La MaMa Melbourne. These tours and satellite theatres not only created international connections and established La MaMa as a cultural ambassador for Off-Off-Broadway theatre, but also introduced experimental playwriting and O'Horgan's style of directing to international audiences. The La MaMa tours also allowed Stewart to create cross-cultural exchanges. She brought many notable international artists to La MaMa in Manhattan, including the Polish director Jerzy Grotowski in 1969 and the Romanian director Andrei Șerban in 1970. Stewart also created site- specific productions internationally. In 1981, she directed Romeo and Juliet on the grounds of Leopoldskran Castle in Salzburg, Austria. In 2004, she directed Trojan Women at the ruins in Gardzienice, Poland. La MaMa Umbria, in Spoleto, Italy, is an artist's retreat and cultural center founded in 1990 by Stewart with her MacArthur Grant money. Since 2000, La MaMa has held a three- week international symposium for directors at the Umbria location.  From playwright to director  The European tours influenced Stewart's own aesthetic: \\"I learned in 1965, that English is not the beginning and end of anything. Generally, it's the ending, it messes you up.\\" She also said that, \\"I found the plays that were the most visual were the ones people liked.\\" These realizations shifted Stewart's primary interest from the playwright to the director. In the 1970s, Stewart was interested in pairing playwrights and directors as a kind of theatrical matchmaker. She also had an interest in playwrights who directed and/or were solo performers. Stewart's 1970s shift in focus aligned with the concurrent historical \\"end\\" of the original Off-Off- Broadway movement. While La MaMa is the only Off-Off-Broadway theatre of the core four Off-Off-Broadway theatres that continues to function, La MaMa has evolved and adapted beyond Stewart's original focus on the playwright. = Tom O'Horgan: first artistic director = In 1964, Tom O'Horgan joined La MaMa. Directing over sixty plays, including his all-male version of Jean Genet's The Maids, O'Horgan was crucial to La MaMa's development. He was the theatre's first Artistic Director and was also integral to La MaMa's international tours. As a musician, O'Horgan performed with the Chicago Civic Opera in his youth and had professional training as a harpist, and was also trained in ballet. He came to La MaMa from Second City, bringing his interest and knowledge of Viola Spolin and Paul Sills' role-playing theories of human behavior and games adapted for theatre. This background gave O'Horgan an interest in the totality of theatre, which aligned perfectly with Stewart's interest in a theatrical language that transcended text. This interest of Stewart's developed primarily from La MaMa's international touring. O'Horgan's direction included musically driven vocal and movement techniques, which contributed to the distinctive La MaMa genre of theatre. = The La MaMa Troupe = O'Horgan and Stewart decided to create a workshop to develop the particular type of actors needed for La MaMa's productions. O'Horgan went on to direct the La MaMa Troupe from 1965 to 1969. This decision was initiated by the experience of working on Three from La MaMa with National Educational Television. Three from La MaMa was a television program of three La MaMa theatre pieces: Pavane by Jean-Claude van Itallie; Fourteen Hundred Thousand by Sam Shepard; and The Recluse by Paul Foster. The executive director of National Educational Television, Brice Howard, would not allow any La MaMa actors to perform in Three from La MaMa. Howard declared that the La MaMa actors were too inexperienced, which led Stewart and O'Horgan to start the actor-training workshop. In comparison to the psychological acting style and emphasis on method acting that was popular at the time, the La MaMa workshop focused on the other side of acting: externalized, kinetic techniques. The fifteen members of the La MaMa Troupe had workshops in movement, voice, and acting for five hours a day, five days a week. These workshops included hundreds of different exercises, which are best represented by Hair, a La MaMa show that transferred to Broadway in 1968. Village Voice critic Michael Smith wrote on Hair's Broadway opening: \\"O'Horgan has blown up Broadway.\\" Hair brought international acclaim to O'Horgan and the La MaMa performance style. For some of the actors in the La MaMa troupe, O'Horgan's Hair was a \\"betrayal\\" and a \\"crass commercialization of lovingly developed ensemble techniques.\\" The success of Hair affected La MaMa's identity, as did O'Horgan's frequent lack of availability to direct later productions. O'Horgan left La MaMa in 1969.  Actors' Equity and the showcase code  More experienced actors began to work at La MaMa as its reputation grew, creating problems with the Actors' Equity Association. In 1966, the union refused to allow their members to work at La MaMa without contracts. As a result, La MaMa was forced to shut down from October 12, 1966, until November 9, 1966. Equity believed that since La MaMa did not pay its actors the theatre was competing with Off-Broadway and would have to shut down. Peter Feldman, an Off-Off-Broadway director, wrote into the New York Times disputing Equity's reasoning. He wrote that La MaMa \\"did provide a stimulating environment for actors to work\\" and that working at La MaMa often led to paying jobs for actors when productions got transferred to Off-Broadway or Broadway. Feldman also emphasized that Stewart was not a commercial producer, but the head of a not-for-profit theatre, and was thus being considered unfairly. After a hearing with Stewart, the union resolved the conflict by creating a new showcase code. As long as La MaMa remained a private club, Equity actors could perform without contracts. This code still applies to Off-Off-Broadway productions today.  Education  Education within the La MaMa community has been present since its inception. Through workshops, talk backs, meet-ups, collaborations with colleges, and artist's retreats, the organization has provided opportunities for the younger generation of artists to observe, grow, and network within and beyond the downtown performing arts scene. = Collaborations with Host Institutions = In the early 1980s, La MaMa resident director Leonardo Shapiro and Trinity College professor and performer Judy Dworin sought to create a performing arts program under Trinity College in partnership with La MaMa. When approached with the idea of collaboration, Ellen Stewart responded enthusiastically, offering space for students to take classes at 47 Great Jones St. In 1986, Trinity/La MaMa Performing Arts Program formed, initiating La MaMa's first of many collaborative ventures with educational institutions.Davidson, Martha (Winter 1988). \\"Trinity/La MaMa: The Program\\". The Trinity Reporter. 18: 10–17 – via ISSUU. Examples of additional institutions that have worked with La MaMa include Sarah Lawrence College, which holds courses that allow students to engage in workshops with La MaMa artists and attend performances. = La MaMa Kids = Workshops for children and families occur monthly and are coordinated and taught by La MaMa resident artists. The basics of storytelling, dance, mask and puppet-making are common themes at the workshops. In addition, performances specifically geared to children are present in the La MaMa season.  In the 2000s  In 2005, the theatre was among 406 New York City arts and social service institutions to receive part of a $20 million grant from the Carnegie Corporation,\\"Carnegie Corporation of New York Announces Twenty Million Dollars in New York City Grants\\". . made possible by a donation from then-mayor of New York City, Michael Bloomberg.Roberts, Sam. \\"City Groups Get Bloomberg Gift of $20 Million\\". New York Times, July 6, 2005. Today, over one hundred productions with over four hundred performances are staged at La MaMa each season. Stewart continued to be artistic director and \\"mother\\" at La MaMa until her death on January 13, 2011.Gussow, Mel, & Weber, Bruce. \\"Ellen Stewart, 91, Off-Off-Broadway Pioneer, Dies\\". New York Times, January 13, 2011. The choice of who would follow Stewart was significant, as \\"Ellen is La MaMa\\" to many people. Before her death, Stewart chose to be succeeded by Mia Yoo, who continues to serve as artistic director. La MaMa Archives The La MaMa Archives is a collection chronicling the theatre's history and documenting the development of Off-Off-Broadway theatre. The collection includes approximately 10,000 items in a range of formats, including posters, programs, scripts, costumes, puppets, masks, musical instruments, correspondence, photographs, and audiovisual materials. The Archives has developed a chronological list of productions staged at La MaMa from 1962 through 2010, and in 2014 received a grant from the Council on Library and Information Resources to create a searchable digital catalog of its collection. In 2016, the Archives received a grant from the National Historic Records and Publications Commission to support a collaborative project, with the Bay Area Video Coalition and the Wisconsin Center for Film and Theatre Research, that will result in expanded access to a collection of half-inch open reel videos that document theatrical work performed at La MaMa during the 1970s.

Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. He also holds a PhD from Harvard in the field of political science. He served in the US Peace Corps in Malaysia where he learned Malay/Indonesian. He also was a Fulbright Professor at El Colegio de México in Mexico where he taught courses on U.S. Foreign Policy.  Personal life  Pastor was married to the former Margaret McNamara, daughter of former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, with whom he had two children. He lived in Washington, D.C. He died of colon cancer in 2014.https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/robert-a-pastor-latin-america- specialist-in-diplomacy-and-academia-dies- at-66/2014/01/09/32c500b4-7945-11e3-af7f-13bf0e9965f6_story.htm  Work history  Pastor was a member of the National Security Council Staff with a portfolio that included Latin America and the Caribbean during the administration of President Jimmy Carter from 1977 to 1981. Pastor was nominated by President Bill Clinton in 1994 to serve as the Ambassador to Panama. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved his nomination by a vote of 16-3, but Senator Jesse Helms prevented the full Senate from voting. After the Republicans won control of the Senate in November 1994, Helms became Chairman of the Committee and refused to permit a vote on Pastor, who then requesten Clinton to withdraw his nomination. The main reason that Helms opposed the nomination was that he held Pastor accountable for negotiating the Panama Canal Treaties. He served as a Senior Fellow at the Carter Center, where he established the programs on Latin America and the Caribbean, democracy and election-monitoring, and Chinese village elections. He was also Goodrich C. White Professor of Political Science at Emory University. Pastor was Vice President of International Affairs at American University in Washington, D.C. from September 2002-December 2007. There, he helped establish the American University of Nigeria, transformed and expanded the study abroad program and introduced the \\"Abroad at AU\\" program, bringing students from around the world to study for a semester or year at AU. He also founded and headed the university's Center for Democracy and Election Management, and the Center for North American Studies and was Executive Director of the Carter- Baker Commission on Federal Election Reform. In 2003, Pastor was elected to the Common Cause National Governing Board. Pastor was Vice Chair of the Independent Task Force on the Future of North America, sponsored by the Council on Foreign Relations in association with the Mexican Council on Foreign Relations (Consejo Mexicano de Asuntos Internacionales) and the Canadian Council of Chief Executives.  North American Community  Pastor's advocacy of North American integration has been the subject of heated controversy, with criticisms from the left and the right. Pastor proposed a North American Community, \\"whose premise is that all three sovereign countries benefit when each of the countries makes progress, and all suffer when one fails\\". Pastor is featured in the 2010 Canadian documentary film Water On The Table, in which he refers to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and debates water rights issues.  Published works  He is well published on US foreign policy, having written or edited 17 books, including \\"The North American Idea: A Vision of a Continental Future,\\"Exiting the Whirlpool: US Foreign Policy Toward Latin America and the Caribbean, Democracy in the Caribbean: Political, Economic and Social Perspectives and Limits to Friendship: The United States and Mexico. Pastor has published extensively his theories of a North American Community, including Toward a North American Community: Lessons from the Old World to the New. Through the Independent Task Force on North America he has released the reports Building a North American Community and \\"Creating a North American Community\\", both released in 2005.

The station is owned by Robert and Luanne Wilkins, through licensee Bobbi Wilkins Radio Network Broadcasting Ltd. It airs a religious radio format. Most hours are brokered programming, where national and local religious leaders pay for a segment of time, for preaching or instruction, and where they may appeal to listeners for donations. Hosts include Charles Stanley, Jim Daly, John MacArthur, David Jeremiah and Jay Sekulow. KERI is powered at 1,000 watts, day and night, using a non- directional antenna. Its transmitter is located on Kimber Avenue in Bakersfield, off Route 58 - Exit 115.Radio-Locator.com/KERI KERI's studios and offices are on Easton Drive in Bakersfield.YellowPages.com/KERI History On 17 May 1950, the station first sign-on signed on as KWSO, a 250-watt daytimer at 1050 kHz, owned by Maple Leaf Broadcasting.Broadcasting Yearbook 1951 page 97 It was licensed to Wasco, California, about 40 kilometres northwest of Bakersfield. By the 1960s, the station had assorted programmes including middle of the road and classical music, farm and news reports and religious programmes. The station's signal was limited to the area around Wasco, and was reflected in the KWSO call letters. In the early 1980s, the Federal Communications Commission allowed KWSO to move to 1180 kHz, coupled with a boost in power to 10,000 watts by day and nighttime authorisation, running at 1000 watts after sunset, using a directional antenna.Broadcasting Yearbook 1984 page B-40 With this new power, the station could be heard around the larger Bakersfield radio market. It switched to a full-time religious format, changing its call sign to KERI, which stands for Kingdom of Eucharist and Religious Institute, also known as KERn county Inspirational programming. (The 1050 frequency is now occupied by KJPG in nearby Frazier Park, California, airing a Catholic radio format.) In the early 2000s, the station got another power boost, this time powered at its current 50,000 watts by day and 10,000 watts at night. Its city of licence was changed to two communities, Wasco and Greenacres. In 2004, the station was bought by American General Media, which owns five other stations in the Bakersfield market.Broadcasting Yearbook 2009 page D-110 On 1 January 2009, a frequency swap with talk radio sister station KERN 1410 AM was made. The talk format on KERN was moved to the more powerful 1180 frequency, while the religious format on KERI switched to AM 1410. (For the history of the 1410 frequency, see KERN.) After the switch was made, KERI 1410 was sold to the Watkins Radio Network, which owns about 30 other religious stations around the U.S. Previous logo File:KERI logo.pngKERI logo while broadcast on 1180 AM References External links *Corporate website *Fybush.com Tower Site of the Week photos of radio towers in Bakersfield ERI ERI Category:Radio stations established in 2008 ","title":"KERI"},{"id":"8884258","text":"The Ken-L Ration logo Ken-L Ration was the name of a brand of canned and dry dog food. Ken-L Ration was owned by Quaker Oats, but the brand was sold to H. J. Heinz Co. in 1995.

The dog food's original main ingredient was U.S. Government Inspected horse meat, advertised as \\"lean, red meat\\". History In the 1950s, Ken-L-Ration was the major sponsor of a local TV show in New York City called, We Love Dogs. Each week a dog or puppy was featured as the prize in a contest. Viewers were invited to write and send letters to explain why they should win the dog. The next week, the winning letter was read and the winner appeared on the show and was given the dog. The brand is most notable for a popular advertising jingle from the 1960s. The jingle was based on the song \\"My Dog's Bigger Than Your Dog\\" written by Tom Paxton. The advertisement consisted of three children singing: My dog's faster than your dog, My dog's bigger than yours. My dog's better 'cause he gets Ken-L Ration, My dog's better than yours.

It is also referred to as a bioactive lipid mediator. Sphingolipids at large form a class of lipids characterized by a particular aliphatic aminoalcohol, which is sphingosine. Production S1P is formed from ceramide, which is composed of a sphingosine and a fatty acid. Ceramidase, an enzyme primarily present in plasma membrane, will convert ceramide to sphingosine. sphingosine is then phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase (SK) isoenzymes. There are two identified isoenzymes, SK1 and SK2. These two enzymes have different tissue distribution. SK1 is highly expressed in spleen, lung and leukocytes. While, SK2 is highly expressed in liver and kidney. SK2 is located mainly in the mitochondria, nucleus and the endoplasmic reticulum whereas SK1 is mainly located in cytoplasm and the cell membrane. =Metabolism and degradation= S1P can be dephosphorylated to sphingosine by sphingosine phosphatases and can be irreversibly degraded by an enzyme, sphingosine phosphate lyase. Function S1P is a blood borne lipid mediator, in particular in association with lipoproteins such as high density lipoprotein (HDL). It is less abundant in tissue fluids. This is referred to as the S1P gradient, which seems to have biological significance in immune cell trafficking. Originally thought as an intracellular second messenger, it was discovered to be an extracellular ligand for G protein-coupled receptor S1PR1 in 1998. It is now known that S1P receptors are members of the lysophospholipid receptor family. There are five described to date. Most of the biological effects of S1P are mediated by signaling through the cell surface receptors. Although S1P is of importance in the entire human body, it is a major regulator of vascular and immune systems. In addition, it might be relevant in the skin. In the vascular system, S1P regulates angiogenesis, vascular stability, and permeability. In the immune system, it is now recognized as a major regulator of trafficking of T- and B-cells. S1P interaction with its receptor S1PR1 is needed for the egress of immune cells from the lymphoid organs (such as thymus and lymph nodes) into the lymphatic vessels. Inhibition of S1P receptors was shown to be critical for immunomodulation. S1P has also been shown to directly suppress TLR mediated immune response from T cells. A research team, led by a scientist at Weill Cornell Medical College, has discovered that red blood cells perform a second vital function: angiogenesis. Given its role in creating new blood vessels, scientists recognize S1P as vital to human health — and a player in some diseases, such as cancer. And although S1P is known to be blood borne, no one realized until this study that S1P is supplied by red blood cells to control blood vessel growth. Clinical significance The levels of S1P (in a range of 5–40 µmol/L) are 5 to 10 times up-regulated in ovarian cancer patients' ascites. S1P at this physiological concentration stimulates migration and invasion of epithelial ovarian cancer cells but inhibits migration of normal ovarian surface epithelial cells. Most (more than 90%) ovarian cancers arise from the epithelium of the ovary. Therefore, extracellular S1P could have an important role in cancer progression by promoting migration of epithelial ovarian cancer cells. Ozonization of human blood is associated with increased concentrations of S1P in the plasma. In addition, S1P modulates the proliferation of skin cells. This in particular applies to keratinocytes while fibroblasts are not addressed in this way, apart from cell growth and differentiation While S1P suppresses epidermal proliferation as the glucocorticoids do, it differs from them in so far, as proliferation of dermal fibroblasts is not reduced. In fact, S1P even activates fibroblast-derived extracellular matrix protein production. =As a drug= Administration of S1P has been shown to protect oocytes from chemotherapeutic agents in vitro, as well as in vivo from chemotherapeutic and radiation therapies. which otherwise induce apoptosis of the cells. S1P has protected ovarian tissue xenografts in SCID mouse models from radiation induced atresia. In animal models these protected oocytes have been used to produce healthy live young. Radiotherapies and chemotherapies can cause apoptosis of ovarian follicles, causing premature ovarian failure, and so S1P is of great interest in fertility preservation. However, its mechanism of inhibiting the sphingomyelin apoptotic pathway may also interfere with the apoptosis action of chemotherapy drugs. Due to the hyperproliferative action against epidermal cells, S1P has been considered as an active pharmaceutical ingredient for hyperproliferative skin diseases, in particular, psoriasis vulgaris and acne vulgaris. Although S1P is active at very low concentrations, bioavailability of the compound in human skin is a concern. Therefore, a topical formulation based on specific drug carriers has been considered inevitable. =As a drug target= Lpath Inc has produced and optimized a monoclonal anti-S1P antibody (Sphingomab). Sphingomab can absorb S1P from the extracellular fluid, thereby lowering the effective concentration of S1P. is an experimental anti-S1P monoclonal antibody that has had a phase II clinical trial for renal cell carcinoma. Sonepcizumab (LT1009) as ASONEP (for intravenous injection) has been studied for solid tumours.Safety Study of ASONEP (Sonepcizumab/LT1009) to Treat Advanced Solid Tumors (ASONEP) As iSONEP, a formulation for intravitreal injection, it has been studied for age- related macular degeneration.Safety Study of iSONEP (Sonepcizumab/LT1009) to Treat Neovascular Age-related Macular Degeneration =S1P receptor(s) as a drug target= There are 5 types of Sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor. S1P receptor modulators The drug fingolimod (FTY720), which agonizes the S1P receptor, prevents autoimmune lymphocytes from moving from the lymphoid organs into the central nervous system. It has been shown in phase III clinical trials to reduce relapses and improve other outcomes in multiple sclerosis. S1P, as well as FTY720, has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties at low concentrations and prevent monocyte:endothelial interactions in aorta, possibly through the S1P1 receptor. ONO-4641 (a drug of Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) is a sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor agonist which keeps lymphocytes in lymph nodes and thereby inhibits the infiltration of lymphocytes into lesions.

It reached number 3 on the Oricon chart. His second single \\"50% & 50%\\" was released on the same day. Both singles' covers are identical except; \\"Eyes Love You\\" is green, whereas \\"50% & 50%\\" is red. They form a 3D picture when they are placed side by side. It was certified gold upon release by RIAJ. Background hide embarked on a solo career in 1993 due to the downtime in X Japan. Initially wanting to hire several different vocalists because he was unsure of his own voice, he eventually began taking vocal lessons from Toshi's coach and sang the material himself. Wanting to contrast something unusual with a pop background, hide hired Yukinojo Mori to pen the lyrics to his first two A-sides. As a kid, hide was fond of Bow Wow's 1982 album Warning from Stardust, where the A-side songs had lyrics in English and the B-side in Japanese. Liking the Japanese lyrics better, hide only realized Mori was their author afterwards. In a notable August 11, 1993 performance of the song on the NHK television show Pop Jam, hide was backed by his future Spread Beaver bandmate I.N.A. and Jennifer Finch and Demetra \\"Dee\\" Plakas of American all-girl grunge band L7. The music video for \\"Eyes Love You\\" won the 1994 MTV Video Music Awards' Japan Prize. Releases \\"Eyes Love You\\" and \\"50% & 50%\\" were both released on August 5, 1993 by MCA Victor, as hide's first solo works. Although he previously collaborated with J and Inoran to contribute the song \\"Frozen Bug\\" to the Dance 2 Noise 004 compilation under the group name \\"M*A*S*S\\". A slightly different version of \\"Eyes Love You\\" subtitled \\"T.T. Version\\" appears on his first studio album, Hide Your Face. A remix appears as the B-side to his third single \\"Dice\\". On December 12, 2007, the single was re-released with a new cover. On April 28, 2010, it was re- released again as part of the first releases in \\"The Devolution Project\\", which was a release of hide's original eleven singles on picture disc vinyl. Track listing Cover versions The song was covered by, K.A.Z and I.N.A.'s band, Sonic Storage feat. Kōshi from Flow, on the 2006 Yukinojo Mori tribute album Words of Yukinojo. The title track was covered by A on the Tribute III -Visual Spirits- tribute album, while \\"Oblaat\\" was covered by GotchaRocka on Tribute II -Visual Spirits-, both released on July 3, 2013.

It was formed in 1992 when the Archdiocese of Samoa-Apia and Tokelau was split into the Archdiocese of Samoa-Apia and the Mission Sui Iuris of Tokelau. The current Ecclesiastical Superior is Archbishop Alapati Lui Mata’eliga, appointed 22 December 2015. The Nukunonu Church History From the discovery of the island by Europeans in 1841, several attempts were made by Catholic missionaries to reach Tokelau from Wallis Island between 1845 and 1863. The first Catholic baptism was performed in 1863 on one adult and three children, and several other occurred soon after. Father Didier lived in the country from 1883 to 1890, the year he died at sea. Two elders who were educated in Samoa acted as catechists starting in 1904, and others continued their role over time. The Catholic Church allowed traditional music and dance to be incorporated into Catholic religious ritual, contributing to their efforts at converting the populace. In 1945 Father Jepson came to Tokelau and proposed having a priest permanently stationed there, a church be constructed, and the Order of Mary provide sisters to the island. Father Patrick O'Connor was the only foreigner residing in the country as of 2011. He was assigned to the island country by the Archbishop of Samoa in 1977 to take care of the Catholic parish on the atoll of Nukunonu and has resided there since then. The church services are conducted in Tokelau. The atoll of Nukunonu is mostly Catholic, while Fakaofo and Atafu atolls have both Congregational and Catholic churches. Many religious rules are followed such as families gathering at 6pm for prayers, a midnight curfew, and a ban on swimming on Sundays. Ecclesiastical Superiors #Rev. Msgr.

The song has been described as \\"a gorgeous vignette\\" by critics and been praised for its multilayered, poetic dimensions. When Dylan himself has been questioned about the song's subject matter he has confessed that he has no idea. However, author Paul Williams describes the song as a portrait of a gypsy girl that Dylan has seen only fleetingly but who has completely captivated him. Williams goes on to say that within the context of the song, Dylan is falling in love with not only the gypsy girl but also with the whole idea of gypsies and of himself in love with one. The song takes its name from the Spanish Harlem neighborhood of New York City.  Reception  Music critic Tim Riley writes that \\"'Spanish Harlem Incident' is a new romance that pretends to be short and sweet, but it's an example of how Dylan begins using uncommon word couplings to evoke the mysteries of intimacy...her 'rattling drums' plays off his 'restless palms'; her 'pearly eyes' and 'flashing diamond teeth' off his 'pale face.'\\" Dylan only ever performed the song in live concerts during the period immediately following the release of the Another Side of Bob Dylan album in 1964.  Covers  The song was covered by The Byrds on their 1965 debut album, Mr. Tambourine Man, and had first been performed by the band during their pre-fame residency at Ciro's nightclub in West Hollywood, California. The song was one of four Dylan covers to appear on their debut album. After its appearance on the Mr. Tambourine Man album, The Byrds performed the song infrequently at live concerts. \\"Spanish Harlem Incident\\" was also covered by Dion on his 1978 Return of the Wanderer album. Chris Whitley covered the song (as well as Dylan's \\"4th Time Around\\") on Perfect Day in 2000. In 2006, a live cover of the song by Silkworm was featured on their final EP \\"Chokes!\\", featuring posthumous vocals from drummer Michael Dahlquist. In addition, The Burden of Paradise, a band in which Snake Davis plays, covered the song on their 2008 album, Things That Sting.

The concept is best illustrated by way of example. # Bank A lends a first advance to the borrower, which is secured by a mortgage over the borrower's property. The mortgage is expressed to secure this advance and any future advances. # Bank B subsequently lends more money to the borrower and takes a second ranking mortgage over the same property. # Bank A then subsequently lends a second advance to the borrower, relying on its original mortgage. Bank A will always have a first priority claim against the property for the full amount of its first advance. But it will be able to claim against the property in priority to Bank B with respect to its second advance only if it is permitted to tack the second advance to the mortgage that was taken at the time the first advance was made. If Bank A is not permitted to tack the second advance, then Bank B's claim in respect of the sums that it lent will have priority over Bank A's claims with respect to the second advance. In American jurisprudence, Black's Law Dictionary defines tacking in slightly narrower terms: Separately, in the definition of tabula in naufragio, Black's comments: The common law rules The first case which approached the position in relation to competing mortgagees was Gordon v Graham. During the nineteenth century, its authority came to be doubted. It was questioned whether it had been correctly reported and, even if correctly reported, whether it correctly stated the law. The matter subsequently came before the House of Lords in Hopkinson v Rolt. In the case, the borrower entered into a mortgage over his land which was expressed to \\"secure the sums due and which shall from time to time become due\\" to the bank. Later, the borrower granted a second mortgage in favour of another creditor. Notice of the second mortgage was given to the bank. The borrower was later declared bankrupt, and a dispute arose as to the priority of the bank with respect to advances which were made under the first mortgage after it had received notice of the second mortgage. The three law lords who heard the case were divided, with a majority favouring priority for the second mortgagee. Lord Campbell, the Lord Chancellor (with whom Lord Chelmsford agreed), opined: The dissenting judge, Lord Cranworth, was in favour of upholding the rule in Gordon v Graham as it was reported. He expressed his view in a dissenting opinion: =Actual notice= Although for years it had been supposed that it was sufficient for the first mortgagee to have either actual or constructive notice of the second mortgage, in Westpac Banking Corporation v Adelaide Bank Limited it was held that constructive notice was not sufficient, and that a first mortgagee could tack future advances unless it had actual notice of the second ranking security. =Effect of subordination= Where a subordination agreement places a later mortgage in higher priority than one previously granted, the validity of releases granted by the previous mortgagors will have a significant impact on the priority assigned to each of the secured debts in question. In 2014, the Court of Appeal of Newfoundland and Labrador held in Medoc Properties Limited v. Standard Trust Company, citing that the failure by an assignee to release one of two assigned mortgages with respect to such an agreement resulted in differing priorities given to them. Term loans and overdrafts The common law rules relating to tacking have caused difficulty in relation to overdrafts and revolving loan facilities because of the rule in Clayton's Case, which provided that in relation to any account, payments into the account are presumed to discharge the earliest debts first. This has been held to have several effects: :* Where notice of a second mortgage is given, subsequent payments into the account are applied to reduce the overdraft existing at the time of the notice and, in effect, for the benefit of the subsequent mortgagee.Deeley v. Lloyds Bank, Limited, (1912) AC 756, discussed at :* The subsequent mortgagee takes subject to the overdraft only at that time, that is to say, not subject to future advances, and the reduction of the overdraft correspondingly improves his security. If the overdraft is paid off, then any subsequent indebtedness will be by way of future advances and the bank mortgage will be postponed entirely in relation to the subsequent mortgage, although the bank mortgage does not cease to be effective between the bank and its customer, the mortgagor.London and County Banking Company v. Ratcliffe, (1881) 6 AC 722, at p 737, discussed at Paget, p. 394 The rule is only a presumption of convenience, but in practice it is difficult to displace, and can have a devastating effect on the security rights of first mortgagees. For example, suppose a customer secures an overdraft with a mortgage against their house. Then at a time when the overdraft stands at £100,000, the customer grants a second mortgage over their house as security for a term loan to another bank. If over the following nine months, the customer was to pay £90,000 into the account and draw a further £70,000 out of the account, the amount owed to the first bank would be reduced to only £80,000, but they would only have first ranking security for a mere £10,000. For the remaining £70,000 they would rank behind the second mortgagee. Accordingly, in practice a bank will normally \\"break\\" an account when they receive notice of a subsequent charge over property which stands as security for an overdraft.In practice, most security documents provide that granting a subsequent charge is actually an event of default, and could potentially result in enforcement action by the bank. Statutory modification Ultimately, Hopkinson was thought to cause more inconvenience than it solved, and a number of common law jurisdictions have sought to modify the position by statute.See, for example, s. 49, Land Registration Act 2002 in the United Kingdom, in British Columbia, in Queensland and in Hong Kong. =Modification in England and Wales= The Parliament of the United Kingdom has modified the application of the common law rules in several respects: :* With respect to unregistered land, s. 94 of the Law of Property Act 1925 enables further advances to be tacked onto a first mortgage if: :: (a) the intervening mortgagee consents, :: (b) the bank had no notice of the intervening mortgage at the time of the advance, or :: (c) the original mortgage actually obliged the bank to make further advances. :* With respect to registered land, s. 49 of the Land Registration Act 2002 provides that a bank may tack if: :: (a) the intervening mortgagee consents, :: (b) the bank had no notice of the intervening mortgage from the subsequent mortgagee, or :: (c) the original mortgage actually obliged the bank to make further advances and this agreement had been entered in the register prior to the creation of the subsequent charge.

As a musician she is known as Georgie Born and is known for her work in Henry Cow and with Lindsay Cooper. Background Born was born in Wheatley, Oxfordshire, the granddaughter of the physicist and Nobel laureate Max Born, daughter of the pharmacologist Gustav Born and Ann Plowden-Wardlaw, stepdaughter of American theatre director and writer George Mully, and cousin of the pop singer Olivia Newton-John. She is the partner of social theorist and political geographer Andrew Barry. Music Born studied the cello and piano at the Royal College of Music in London, and performed classical and modern music including stints with the Michael Nyman Band, the Penguin Cafe Orchestra and the Flying Lizards. She also studied for a year at the Chelsea School of Art. In June 1976, she joined the English avant-rock group Henry Cow as bass guitarist and cellist, following the departure of John Greaves. Henry Cow was in a period of intensive touring and Born toured Europe with the group for two years. After Henry Cow, Born performed and recorded with a number of groups and musicians, including fellow Henry Cow member Lindsay Cooper, National Health, Bruford, and Mike Westbrook, particularly as a cellist in the Westbrook Orchestra. Her playing is prominent on Westbrook's album, The Cortege. Late in 1977, Born, Cooper, Sally Potter and Maggie Nichols founded the Feminist Improvising Group. She also recorded with The Raincoats, and played improvised music with Lol Coxhill, Steve Beresford, David Toop and others as a member of the London Musicians' Collective. During the 1980s, Born was an occasional member of Derek Bailey's Company, and played cello and bass guitar on numerous soundtracks for television and film for composers Lindsay Cooper and Mike Westbrook, as well as the soundtrack for the Stephen Poliakoff play Caught on a Train (1980). She had a walk-on part in Sally Potter's film The Gold Diggers (1983). Academia Born studied anthropology at University College London, gaining her BSc in 1982 and her PhD (supervised by Michael Gilsenan and Michael Rowlands) in 1989. Her first academic job (1986–89) was in the Department of Human Sciences at Brunel University, where she assisted Roger Silverstone in setting up the degree in Communication and Information Studies. Born moved to a lectureship in the Department of Media and Communications at Goldsmiths' College, London (1989–97), where she worked alongside Dick Hebdige. =Cambridge= In 1997 Born began work for an Assistant Lectureship in the Faculty of Social and Political Sciences at the University of Cambridge. In 2000 she was appointed to a Lectureship, in 2003 to Reader in Sociology, Anthropology and Music, and in 2006 to Professor of Sociology, Anthropology and Music at Cambridge, a title that recognises her interdisciplinary contributions. At Cambridge, Born teaches the sociology and anthropology of culture, media, music, and ethnographic method in the Department of Sociology. She is responsible for the only dedicated lecture course on contemporary media in the social sciences. Born is a member of Cambridge's Screen Media Group, which in 2006 launched Cambridge's first cross-Schools master's degree, Screen Media and Cultures. Born founded and directs the Cambridge Media Research Group which runs a seminar series and related events. In 2005 she organised a conference at Cambridge on the legacy of Laura Mulvey's essay, \\"Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema\\". Between 1996 and 1998, Born was a visiting professor in the Institute of Musicology at the University of Aarhus, and from 1997 to 1998 Senior Research Fellow at King's College, Cambridge. From 1998 to 2006 she was Fellow and Director of Studies in Social and Political Sciences at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. Born is Honorary Professor of Anthropology at University College London and a Fellow of the Center for Cultural Sociology at Yale University. She is also a Fellow of the Australian Cultural Sociology Association and of the Australian Centre for Independent Journalism. =Oxford= In 2010 Born was awarded an Advanced Grant by the European Research Council for a major programme of research on the transformation of music by digital media. Subsequently, she moved to become Professor of Music and Anthropology at the University of Oxford. Since 2012, she has also been a Fellow of Mansfield College, Oxford. In 2014 she was elected a Fellow of the British Academy, the United Kingdom's national academy for the humanities and social sciences. Notable academic achievements Born uses ethnography to study cultural production, particularly music, television and information technologies, and is a leading exponent both of institutional ethnography and of anthropology's application to the critical study of Western modernity. In relation to music, television and IT her work has ranged from studies of cultural production and cultural politics, to intellectual property, authorship and subjectivity, to materiality, technology and mediation. She is an international authority on computer music and musical modernism in the twentieth century, and also on contemporary media policy, the BBC and public service broadcasting in the United Kingdom and Europe. Born's earlier research involved anthropological and sociological studies of art and popular musics. Her first book, Rationalising Culture: IRCAM, Boulez, and the Institutionalisation of the Musical Avant-Garde, combined ethnography with cultural history in an analysis of the crisis in twentieth-century art music through the example of IRCAM, the computer music research institute founded by Pierre Boulez. The book (edited with David Hesmondhalgh) Western Music and Its Others: Difference, Representation and Appropriation in Music (2000) integrates approaches from musicology, anthropology and post-colonial theory to address how music can be employed to represent social identities and cultural differences, and the techniques whereby both art and popular musics appropriate other musics. Born's second ethnography, Uncertain Vision: Birt, Dyke and the Reinvention of the BBC (Secker and Warburg, 2004; Vintage, 2005), analyses the transformation of the BBC in the preceding decade. It describes the effects on the corporation of Director General John Birt's implementation of the ‘new public management’: marketisation and market research, audit and accountability procedures – all intended to boost efficiency and increase the BBC's democratic functioning by effecting greater responsiveness to its audiences. The study therefore represents one of the most detailed accounts of the impact of commercial management techniques on Britain's public sector. Derived from fieldwork in the mid-1990s and the early 2000s mainly conducted within the corporation's Drama, Documentary, News and Current Affairs departments, the book adds substance to claims that the BBC has moved towards a market orientation to the detriment of its public service remit. Born argues that this resulted from a combination of the imposition of neo-liberal policies and wider changes in the British and international broadcasting ecology. In 2001–02 Born made a study of the digital strategies of the BBC and Channel Four, Britain's main public service broadcasters, which showed that Channel Four was being driven primarily by commercialism and had drifted seriously from its public service remit for innovation and diversity. She has subsequently written both policy interventions and normative essays on the changing nature of public service broadcasting with the advent of digital media. Born was invited in 2005 to give written and oral evidence to the House of Lords Select Committee on BBC Charter Review, and has lectured to public service broadcasters in Europe and Australia as well as to broadcasting and journalist trade unions in Britain and Europe. Between 2004 and 2006 Born was involved in research (with Marilyn Strathern and Andrew Barry) on interdisciplinarity in knowledge and cultural production, in which she carried out case studies of the use of ethnography by the IT industry, and on art- science and new media art. Born has developed an interdisciplinary approach – using anthropology, sociology, musicology and the arts – to theorising cultural and media production that builds on and extends the work of Pierre Bourdieu, one that integrates aesthetics and history with social scientific perspectives. She has published a number of papers in scientific journals, including Social Anthropology, Cultural Anthropology, American Anthropologist, Journal of Material Culture, Screen, Cultural Values, Javnost, The Political Quarterly, Media, Culture and Society, New Formations and Twentieth Century Music. She is on the editorial boards of Anthropological Theory, Cultural Sociology and New Media and Society, and has been on the editorial boards of Popular Music, Free Associations and Journal of the Royal Musical Society. In 2010 Born and Dr. Ben Walton (a University lecturer in the faculty of music at Cambridge) piloted a Mellon-funded interdisciplinary graduate seminar series on 'Music and Society' at Cambridge University's Centre for Research on Arts, Social Sciences and Humanities. This series was open to both graduates in sociology and graduates in musicology and attempted to provide interdisciplinary discussion covering 'a range of subjects that explore music's place and functions within diverse social environments'. Born was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2016 Birthday Honours for services to musicology, anthropology, and higher education.

The program began operating on October 11, 1971, and is the second to operate in the United States. Audio- Reader broadcasts the content of books, newspapers, magazines, and other printed materials via a closed-circuit radio to certified users in Kansas, Missouri and Oklahoma. In addition to the radio program, Audio-Reader operates other services for the blind, including a telephone information service called Telephone Reader, audio description of theater in Kansas City, Missouri, and Lawrence, Kansas, cassette taping of printed materials, and a sensory garden. Audio-Reader is funded through public and private sources, and is run through the University of Kansas through KU's public radio station, KANU. A staff of thirteen operate the service, supervising three hundred volunteers, who record materials at the on-campus office or through telephone headsets from their homes. In addition, the service has live broadcasts of daily newspapers, and some volunteers travel to theaters in the area to provide descriptions of theater performances.  History  Anne \\"Petey\\" Cerf, a Lawrence resident, began working in the mid-1960s to find a way to provide written materials for people unable to use standard print using radio, and hired Midwest Research Institute to determine the feasibility of such a project, originally focusing on using the same radio channels used by Muzak. MRI's report was discouraging, as was the reaction of a major organization for the blind, whose director told Ms. Cerf \\"The blind don't need a special radio service.\\" On a visit to the Library of Congress, Cerf discovered that Stan Potter and Bob Watson, two amateur radio operators, had developed the first radio reading service, through Minnesota Public Radio in 1969. Cerf contacted Potter, and with his help, she worked to start a similar program in Kansas. Cerf presented the idea to the University of Kansas, offering to fund the first two years of its operation, provided the university would administer the program. KANU began operating Audio-Reader in 1971. Audio-Reader began its operation in the kitchen of KU's Sudler House in 1971. Shortly after that, the service was moved to a trailer outside of the house, where it remained for a number of years. During this period, volunteers recalled live broadcasts that were interrupted by heavy rainstorms or squirrels running along the tin roof of the trailer. By the late 1970s, Stan Potter and Audio-Reader director Rosie Hurwitz collaborated to create the Association of Radio Reading Services, which came to be known as the International Association of Audio Information Services (IAAIS) over time. Hurwitz also served as one of the two original presidents of the association, Stan Potter being the other original president. In 1988, Audio-Reader purchased its current facility, a 1920s Tudor-style house, with funding from the Baehr Foundation. The house had once belonged to Phi Kappa Tau, a campus fraternity. Audio-Reader renovated and continues to occupy the house, now called the Baehr house, which contains several small recording studios and an 'air studio' for managing broadcasts. In 2002, the University of Kansas moved the public radio station, now called Kansas Public Radio, to Audio-Reader's site, creating a new building attached to the Baehr house, and putting the two separate staffs in closer proximity. Audio-Reader's current director as of 2007, Janet Campbell, was made interim director of KANU, and she presently runs both organizations as director. \\"For Your Ears Only\\", an annual music sale in Lawrence begun in 2003, is a fundraiser put on by Audio-Reader's staff at the Douglas County Fairgrounds. In July, 2005, Audio-Reader hosted the 2005 IAAIS Conference. In August 2018, KU announced that it would discontinue funding for the Kansas Audio-Reader Network over the next three years.  Technology  Audio-Reader operates on a radio subcarrier frequency 'underneath' KANU's broadcast on 91.5 FM, a common arrangement for radio reading services that allows them to provide copyrighted materials without violating copyright law by broadcasting to the general public. Only radios that are capable of receiving subcarrier channels can pick up such programming. Audio-Reader is only allowed to provide these radios to users who can certify a print-disability from a medical doctor or social service agent. In 1994, Audio-Reader created software for an information delivery system for the telephone called Telephone Reader, which is composed of a computer server connected to a number of phone lines which allows recording and playback of material via the telephone. This program is also used by a few other reading services in the United States. Audio-Reader's version is called the Kansas Lions Telephone Reader, which includes recordings in English and Spanish.  Volunteers and Users  Audio-Reader presently has a group of over three hundred volunteers, serving 5,000 registered clients. Volunteers record books and magazines for later airing on Audio-Reader's radio service, and do live broadcasts of daily newspapers starting at 8 a.m. Telephone Reader volunteers come in starting at 6:00 a.m. CT to begin recording newspaper materials. Eleanor Symons, the first person to volunteer for the service, has remained a volunteer for the service from its inception to the present day, reading three times a week. Listeners to Audio-Reader's service must be unable to use normal printed materials. In most cases, listeners are partially or completely blind, but some listeners have other disabilities, such as dyslexia or allergies to newsprint. A number of Audio- Reader listeners are elderly and have the condition macular degeneration.

It is designed to improve the public's interaction with the US government by quickly directing website visitors to the services or information they are seeking, and by inviting the public to share ideas to improve government. USA.gov links to every federal agency and to state, local, and tribal governments, and is the most comprehensive site in—and about—the US government. While the primary target audience of USA.gov is the American public, about 25 percent of USA.gov's visitors come from outside the United States. USA.gov is part of the Technology and Transformation Services in the General Services Administration (GSA), and includes the Spanish-language web portal to US government services, USAGOV en Español (formerly GobiernoUSA.gov). History USA.gov began in 2000 when Internet entrepreneur Eric Brewer, whose early research in parallel computing was funded by the United States Department of Defense, offered to donate a powerful search engine to the government. That donation helped accelerate the government's earlier work to create a government-wide portal. In June 2000, President Clinton announced the gift from the Federal Search Foundation, a nonprofit organization co-founded by Brewer and fellow entrepreneur David Binetti, and instructed that the portal be launched in 90 days. FirstGov.gov was launched 87 days later on September 22, 2000, during the first-ever webcast originating from the White House Oval Office. GSA and 22 Federal agencies funded the initiative in 2001 and 2002. Since 2002, USA.gov has received an annual appropriation from the U.S. Congress. The name FirstGov.gov was changed in 2007 to USA.gov, in response to user suggestions and telephone surveys. On July 2, 2010, USA.gov revamped the website to improve user access to citizen services through new mobile applications for on-the-go instant access; public engagement platforms; and the fastest, most comprehensive search function for government information. Structure USA.gov helps visitors find federal information in several ways, detailed below. Additionally, USA.gov invites the public to share feedback on apps they would find useful by using government information available on Data.gov and USAspending.gov, and to share ideas to improve government through public dialogues and government contests. =E-mail alerts= Visitors to USA.gov can sign up for free e-mail alerts in both English and Spanish, to learn about popular government topics and important services and benefits. The pages' subjects range from benefits, scams, and fraud, and contacting elected officials to hurricane recovery, travel, and jobs. =USAGov Contact Center= For more than 30 years, the contact center has been a source for answers to questions about consumer problems and government services. If visitors cannot find the government information they are looking for online, they can call 1-844-USAGOV1, or get help through a live web chat service. =USA.gov content= USA.gov links to diverse, useful, and timely citizen-centered government information and services that can help website visitors apply for a government job, register to vote, file their taxes, find government benefits, reserve a campsite at a national park, prepare for disasters, shop at government auctions, learn about visiting the United States, or report an unsafe product, among many other activities. The site's policy is to link to websites of the federal government, quasi- government agencies, and those created by public sector/private sector partnerships; state and local governments; and recognized Indian tribes. In rare instances, the sites link to websites that are not government-owned or government-sponsored if these websites provide government information and/or services in a way that is not available on an official government website. =Live chat= USA.gov offers live chat in English and Spanish, where service representatives can answer website visitors' questions about federal agencies, programs, benefits, or services. =RSS feeds= USA.gov and USAGov en Español offer RSS feeds to help the public stay up to date on useful government information. Website visitors can sign up for USA.gov RSS feeds, and the USAGov en Español. =Search.USA.gov= USA.gov's search engine supports transparency of government information by providing access to government web pages from U.S. federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial governments. The portal features state-of-the-art navigation aids and high-interest, agency-produced databases such as frequently asked questions, government forms, recalls, and government images.http://search.usa.gov/search/images Search.USA.gov is also available on its mobile service. In addition, any U.S. government agency can apply through the USA Services Affiliate Program to install the Search.gov search capability on its own pages, thus allowing agencies at all levels to provide website searching for their own users. =Social Media= USA.gov uses Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube and Instagram to distribute timely official U.S. government information and emergency information, announce official government events and observances, share official government photos and videos, and gather feedback from the public. =URL shortening= A URL shortening service, go.USA.gov, is available to users that have a .gov email address (only .gov URLs may be submitted for shortening through this service). The service will generate a random URL following go.USA.gov/ which redirects the user to the longer .gov URL stored in the system. USAGov en Español 180px A part of USA.gov, USAGov en Español pulls together all of the U.S. government's Spanish-language websites and makes them easily accessible to the public in one central location. The site, which was developed by Spanish speakers, represents an outreach effort to some 43 million Americans who report speaking Spanish at home. Although most of the resources shared on USAGov en Español are federal, the site also links to Spanish-language content provided by states, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and local government websites. Web visitors also can search all federal and state web pages for Spanish content through the site's search engine, call 1-844USAGOV1 for help in Spanish and English or chat with a representative online. Spanish-speaking visitors can sign up for e-mail alerts in Spanish to let them know about important benefits and services. The website also offers information on the same topic in both English and Spanish by simply clicking on a toggle button. Web best practices USA.gov actively promotes best practices within the government web manager community to improve the overall quality of U.S. federal websites as well as public access to government information. =Federal Web Managers Council= =Interagency Committee on Government Information= USA.gov has a leadership role on the Interagency Committee on Government Information (ICGI), formed to meet requirements of the E-Government Act of 2002 (Public Law 107-347, 44 U.S.C. Ch 36). The ICGI drafts recommendations and shares effective practices for federal government information access, dissemination, and retention. Crisis response initiatives USA.gov is a critical destination for information during national disasters. After the September 11, 2001, attack on the United States, USA.gov became a major tool for the U.S. government to provide the most accurate, timely, and comprehensive information, resources, and government services available during that crisis. Several years later, in the wake of Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, USA.gov participated in efforts led by the Department of Homeland Security and worked with over 20 federal agencies to develop guidance to communicate response information related to the storm and its aftermath. Agencies were encouraged to coordinate web information to avoid duplication and inconsistencies so the public could quickly and easily find critical information. Categories identified during Katrina matched information people would be looking for in \\"any\\" disaster, whether natural or man-made. The federal web community can now re-use a good deal of the content developed in response to the hurricane crisis, to enable them to be even better prepared when the next disaster occurs. Model to other government websites USA.gov serves as a model for other government websites and adheres to all requirements and guidelines for federal websites, including those established by the E-Government Act of 2002, the U.S. Office of Management and Budget's (OMB) Policies for Federal Public Websites, and Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 regarding website accessibility. The site also follows requirements of the Privacy Act, the Federal Information Security Management Act, and other privacy and security requirements. Awards USA.gov has won numerous awards and media endorsements, including: * Listing among the \\"Best of...\\" by Money Magazine, \\"Favorite Places on the Web\\" by the Chicago Sun Times, \\"Hot Sites\\" by USATODAY.com, \\"Top 100 Classic Sites\\" by PC Magazine, and Time Magazine's 2007 \\"Top 25 Sites We Can't Live Without.\\" * It also has won \\"#1 Federal Government Website—Comparing Technology Innovation in the Private and Public Sectors,\\" by the Brookings Institution; \\"#1 in Global E-Government Readiness\\" in the United Nations' Global E-Government Readiness Report 2005; \\"#1 in Overall Federal e-Government\\" by Brown University's Taubman Center for Public Policy; and the \\"Innovations in American Government Award\\" by Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government.

A combined U.S. Navy/U.S. Coast Guard VBSS team from and embarked MSST personnel inspects a suspected pirate dhow in the Gulf of Aden, November 2009 US Navy VBSS Team assigned to the VBSS Team attached to USS Whirlwind PC-11 Visit, board, search, and seizure (VBSS) Walker D. Mills (27 Aug 2020) MARINES AND MERCENARIES: BEWARE THE IRREGULAR THREAT IN THE LITTORAL is the term used by United States military and law enforcement agencies for maritime boarding actions and tactics. VBSS teams are designed to capture enemy vessels, combat terrorism, piracy and smuggling, and to conduct customs, safety and other inspections. United States Navy training A U.S. Navy VBSS team from conducts an inspection while enforcing United Nations sanctions against Iraq in 2004. The initial training continuum includes three courses, lasting a total of eight weeks (SRF-B, SRF-A, VBSS), with some team members receiving additional follow-on training. Skills taught in VBSS training revolve around Close Quarters Battle (CQB). Training consists of proficiency in hand-to-hand combat tactics, search procedures, tactical team movements, shooting, rappelling, searching, and arrest procedures for compliant and non-compliant combatants. This aspect of the Navy plays a role in maintaining security and freedom of sea lanes worldwide. Some advanced units, known as Helicopter Visit, Board, Search, and Seizure (HVBSS) teams, have been trained to fast rope aboard vessels from helicopters. All sailors in the U.S. Navy are eligible to serve aboard a VBSS team, but those who aspire to join a team have to be approved by their ship's command. Being approved does not guarantee inclusion on a VBSS team, as it is possible (and not uncommon) for candidates to wash out of VBSS school. The attrition rate for VBSS is 25-30%, on average. U.S. Navy VBSS teams are generally armed with M4 carbines as well as Mossberg 500 shotguns and Beretta M9 pistols. The body armor is generally with kevlar ballistic plate inserts and a buoyant tactical vest that doubles as a life preserver. The majority of U.S. naval ships deploying with VBSS teams are smaller, such as destroyers, cruisers, etc. VBSS teams are used to combat illegal narcotics, arms trafficking and piracy. United States Marine Corps Marines from the 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit conduct VBSS training The United States Marine Corps has several units that conduct VBSS. The premier VBSS force is the ARG/MEU's Maritime Raid Force (MRF), previously known as the Maritime Special Purpose Force. Additionally the various Fleet Antiterrorism Security Teams are trained to varying levels of proficiency in VBSS. =MRF= The MRF is a sub-unit of the ARG/MEU that is task-organized for each specific mission. However, it typically consists of three platoons: a Force Reconnaissance Platoon as the assault element, an Amphibious Reconnaissance Platoon as the support element, and a Battalion Landing Team infantry platoon as the security element. Together these form the backbone of the MRF and are usually augmented by explosive ordnance disposal technicians, counter-intelligence/human intelligence, joint terminal attack controllers, military information support operators, United States Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachments, and chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear specialists, among others as needed. The backbone platoons and enablers are then married with the needed support assets for a particular mission, such as USN and USMC aircraft and small boats. Integral to the ARG/MEU construct, and bringing to bear the full range of ARG/MEU capabilities, the MRF is a conventional force that is capable of many 'SOF- like' missions, including opposed VBSS. United States Coast Guard MSST Over the Horizon Boat The U.S. Coast Guard is another service that commonly conducts VBSS. The USCG belongs to the Department of Homeland Security, and not the Department of Defense, and therefore their VBSS teams act in a law enforcement capacity where the US may exercise its jurisdiction. Law enforcement boarding teams from cutters and stations are generally armed with SIG P229 pistols, Remington M870P shotguns, and rifles of the M16 rifle family, (commonly a Mk 18 or the M-4 SOPMOD). Additionally, the Coast Guard has a number of specialized units, including the Maritime Security Response Teams, and Tactical Law Enforcement Teams, that have advanced boarding capabilities. In addition to law enforcement, the USCG will often use VBSS to conduct at-sea safety inspections of civilian vessels to ensure they are abiding by applicable safety regulations and U.S. law.

6.1 in June 1993, and later with version 7 and PC DOS 2000. In version 6.1, IBM dropped QBASIC, which, in its edit mode, was also the system text editor. It was necessary to provide some sort of editor, so IBM chose to adapt and substantially extend its OS/2 System Editor (1986), a minimally functional member of the E family of Editors. The DOS version is extended with a wide array of functions that are usually associated with more functional versions of the E editor family (see below). In version 7, IBM added the REXX language to DOS, restoring programmability to the basic box. IBM also provided E with OS/2. Features The features include (for PC DOS 7): *online help *edit large text files *draw boxes around text *mouse and menu support *record and play keystroke macros *change case within a marked area *access multiple files in multiple panes *syntax-directed editing of C and REXX *add and multiply numbers in a marked area *locate and make a change globally within a file *select text and move, copy, overlay, or delete it *copy and move text from one file into another file E for PC DOS consists of five files: * \`E.EXE\` \\\\ the executable program itself, (v3.13 in PC DOS 7) * \`E.EX\` \\\\ pre-compiled profile for E's behavior * \`E.INI\` \\\\ text file allowing modification of a few \`E.EX\` defaults (Not in v 3.12 (dos 6)) * \`EHELP.HLP\` \\\\ text file used for E's F1 key help in Browse (read-only) mode * \`BROWSE.COM\` \\\\ loads a file into E in read-only mode. (Not in v 3.12 (dos 6)) Since no tool was provided for building other profiles besides the supplied \`E.EX\`, PC DOS users have limited access to the full extensibility offered by the version 3 of E (e3) available to IBM programmers themselves. Still, it is a powerful implementation, with many features supporting the needs of general programmers. For PC DOS owners who have moved on to other operating systems, E can be run with the use of a DOS emulator (e.g. DOSBox) or with DOS virtualization software (e.g. DOSEMU or NTVDM). E runs quite successfully under the Windows NT 32-bit DOS prompt, for example. E family The history of the PC DOS version of E begins with Personal Editor, a key configurable editor that enabled limited programming using a GML-like language. Personal Editor was initially released in 1982 and became an IBM product not long after. Limitations in Personal Editor led to the development and release in 1984 of the E editor, a much faster editor that supported very long files and included a substantially enhanced user interface. E2, released in 1985, provided enhanced programmability using a REXX-like language. Its UI programmability was designed so flexibly that it was used to develop user interface prototypes for other kinds of software, including Word Processors and Survey software. Subsequent versions, including E3, EOS2, and EPM, provided a wide range of other enhancements. The OS/2 System Editor was developed by the E programming team at the request of the OS/2 Development team. It was designed to be a fast and highly functional text editor with a minimal number of features and no configurability. EPM was later released as the OS/2 Enhanced Editor. The popular SlickEdit shares a common heritage, having been written by the original developer of E3. Other versions of E family editors have been released with IBM programming products. There are several acknowledged E editor family clones, including X2, which both reproduces the Rexx-like EI programming language used in E2 and later versions of E and acknowledges its debt in its documentation.

Wagon Wheel is a densely populated neighborhood of Oxnard, California at the intersection of U.S. Route 101 and Pacific Coast Highway. The neighborhood was originally developed as an office, motel and restaurant complex named Wagon Wheel Junction with a convenient roadside location near the historic community of El Rio. The site in Ventura County became a popular stop for travelers between Los Angeles and Santa Barbara, particularly during its heyday in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. The entire site was demolished in 2011 to begin the development of the community with 1,500 residential units.  History  =Construction= Constructed in 1947, it was the first development by Oxnard developer Martin V. (\\"Bud\\") Smith. The Wagon Wheel Motel and Restaurant were part of a mid- century real estate development in north Oxnard, California called the Wagon Wheel Junction. Before Smith purchased the land in 1945, it was prone to flooding, and was not actually in the city of Oxnard, but situated four miles (6 km) north of Oxnard and six miles (10 km) south of Ventura. After its completion, it became mid-century a roadside attraction on the 101 Ventura Freeway in Ventura County. The Wagon Wheel's Office and Restaurant as viewed from the 101 freeway before being closed in 2005. During excavation of the site, Smith uncovered branding irons from the Hobson Brothers' feed lot operations in the area in the 1920s, and he used this as the basis for his western theme. He began with the repurposing of surplus Seabee barracks won at auction in Port Hueneme, which he relocated in the typical sweeping U shape of period motels. It was the pre-pool era so the rooms all faced a grassy play area with picnic tables. He cut some of the barracks in half and transformed others into a restaurant and office with a western ranch style. He hired Hollywood set designer and carpenter Roy Beatty to design and create wrought iron lamps from branding irons and spurs, and furnish the original rooms with rustic wood beds, chairs and lamps. The theme for the property was typical of the then popular cowboy movies, with windows made from wagon wheels, and cowhide chairs in the restaurant. Along the highway real wagon wheels were placed in the median next to a rustic wooden sign that read: WAGON WHEEL MOTEL NEW AND MODERN BREAKFAST SERVICE DAY AND NIGHT SINGLE $3 DOUBLE $4 FAMILY SUITES In 1952 this 12 unit addition was built to keep up with demand at the popular Motel Smith had to develop, and the area soon had a bowling alley, shopping center, roller skating rink, industrial units, and a row of restaurants. These were all located on streets with wild-west names like Winchester Dr., Petticoat Lane, Saddle Ave., and Buckaroo Dr. His restaurant row included the Wagon Wheel Steakhouse, the El Ranchito and the Trade Winds Polynesian restaurant. When Bud Smith shifted into semi-retirement in the mid 1990s, his company, Martin V. Smith and Associates was the biggest developer and landlord in Oxnard with some 4500 tenants and over 200 properties from Calabasas to Santa Maria. Rather than retire and vacate his office on the 21st story of the Financial Plaza tower, he divested himself of most of his properties, but he kept the Wagon Wheel. =Decline= The demolition of the Colonial House, in 1988, left the Wagon Wheel as the only remaining early example of Bud Smith's vision. In 2002 Wagon Wheel Motel and Restaurant was used as a location for the making of Hollywood Hostel (2003), an adult film. The Wagon Wheel Restaurant closed in 2005. In the summer of 2006 over 26 parolees had registered their address at the motel after they were released from local lockup. The Wagon Wheel Motel was closed in November 2006. Since the Motel closed, Wagon Wheel gained popularity in the skateboarding community with the empty swimming pool. Skaters from all over the west coast, and even some from further, traveled to skateboard in a classic Motel swimming pool. The property owners demolished part of the pool after a southern California independent filmmaker created a short video of skateboarding. It was used as a location for the making of Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Movie (2012) =Landmark status= The Wagon Wheel Junction was a part of a fast disappearing piece of Americana architecture. In 1910, the Automobile Association of America planted the seeds of motel identification with its debut of the \\"Official Automobile Blue Book\\". In the 1950s, independent motel owners began competing with the cookie cutter Holiday Inns of the time with their gargantuan, green-and-yellow signage. Independents, such as the Wagon Wheel, developed the art of roadside showmanship through thematic architectural design and elaborate signage that employed porcelain-enameled panels of steel and used a myriad of lamps and neon. The thematic and imaginative sign of the Wagon Wheel and its \\"B\\" movie ranch architecture served not only as a style statement of a particular time in motel history, but has served as a visual place marker along Highway 101 for more than 50 years. On approaching the Wagon Wheel, the roadside traveler knew immediately \\"We are in Oxnard\\", as there was nothing like it anywhere else. In much the same way, the Madonna Inn and the Apple Farm notifies the traveler that one has nearly reached San Luis Obispo. These thematic roadside motels and hotels are the story of California's love of the automobile, written in their architecture and lending identity to the cities they occupy along the monotonous threads of numbing highway that string those cities and towns together throughout the state. The project proponent hired a consultant to do a historic resource assessment in November 2005 of the entire property, including the Wagon Wheel Motel, Restaurant and Bowling Alley and all other buildings on site. The results of this assessment concluded that these structures did not meet criteria for designation as a landmark. Since this first report found no significant resources, the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) would not compel mitigations, however for some reason the report still listed significant mitigations. The mitigations proposed a memorial to Martin V. Smith in a coffee kiosk on-site, prominently displaying the iconic features of the Wagon Wheel, the neon sign, a photo-documentary of the architectural qualities of the structures, and the creation a video and two 30 minute TV programs about Wagon Wheel Junction and Martin V. Smith to be run on local cable channels. A Peer Review of the original historic assessment in the EIR concluded that the Wagon Wheel Motel did in fact meet criteria for landmark eligibility, so a second Peer Review was commissioned. Both the initial Peer Review by San Buenaventura Research Associates (of Santa Paula) and the second Peer Review by Applied Earthworks (of Fresno) contradicted the first assessment, and stated that the Wagon Wheel Motel, and Restaurant were eligible for landmark status, and in addition the El Ranchito restaurant and Wagon Wheel Bowling Alley may be eligible as well. On March 26, 2007, the Ventura County Cultural Heritage Board, acting as the Oxnard Cultural Heritage Board ruled on the Wagon Wheel. The Board concluded that the Wagon Wheel Motel, Restaurant, and El Ranchito Restaurant were historically significant on the local level because of their association with Martin V. (\\"Bud\\") Smith and as an example of themed roadside architecture of the 1940s and 1950s. By unanimous vote, the seven-member board forwarded a recommendation of landmark designation for the motel buildings, office, and restaurant buildings, to the Oxnard City Council. Then in June 2008 the board added the Wagon Wheel Bowling Alley to their recommended landmark recommendation. In June 2008 the City of Oxnard began circulation of a Draft Environmental Impact Report (EIR) for the proposed development. The Oxnard City Council, voted that the Motel and buildings not be listed as an Oxnard City Landmark. Preservationists and architects from the community and as far away as Los Angeles were on hand at Planning Commission and City Council Meetings. The San Buenaventura Conservancy, a local preservation organization, commented at all the public meetings, and then filed an appeal to the Planning Commission decision certifying the EIR; claiming that there was no cause for a Statement of Overriding conditions that would allow the demolition. The Oxnard City Council voted for EIR certification at the appeal. The City Council Vote approving the Project came on January 27, 2009. In January 2009, the EIR was certified and the Project was approved by the Oxnard City Council, demolition was scheduled to begin as soon as documentary mitigations were completed. =Lawsuit= On March 2, 2009 the San Buenaventura Conservancy, a local non-profit preservation advocacy group filed suit in Ventura County Superior Court against the City of Oxnard, claiming that the City's approval of the Oxnard Village Specific Plan project violated the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The project, as approved, requires the demolition of the Wagon Wheel Motel, restaurant, El Ranchito and bowling alley along with everything built on the site. The Conservancy case argues that the project can be feasibly accomplished without demolition of the Wagon Wheel, and CEQA therefore does not allow the Class 1 impact. The lawsuit requested issuance of a peremptory writ ordering the City to set aside its approval of the project pending compliance with CEQA. The original Ventura County Superior Court case was presented July 10, 2009. The Judge sided with the city of Oxnard. The San Buenaventura Conservancy appealed the ruling and received a stay of demolition until the outcome of the appeal case: San Buenaventura Conservancy v. City of Oxnard et al. (CEQA) (Case: B220512 2nd District, Division 6.) On Wednesday December 15, 2010 a three judge panel at the California 2nd district Court of Appeal in Ventura heard arguments. They rendered a decision finding the CEQA process sufficient and affirming the Superior court decision on March 17, 2011. Demolition of the Wagon Wheel began a week later, and was completed in May 2011. The Wagon Wheel neon sign will be integrated into a small interpretive kiosk about Martin V. Smith in the new project. The Museum of Neon Art in Los Angeles has also expressed interest in the sign. In August 2009 FEMA released new flood maps for the Wagon Wheel Area, and it was noted that Wagon Wheel is directly across the street from a gap in the levee, and the new project would be in the flood zone.Hadley, Scott (August 7, 2009) \\"Oxnard Flood zone is likely to expand\\" Ventura County Star =Redevelopment= Redevelopment of the neighborhood will include 1,500 housing units and 50,000 square feet of commercial space where 450,000 square feet of old industrial buildings were demolished. The developer plans to restore the Wagon Wheel neon sign and integrate it in the development such as at the transit center. The Wagon Wheel Family Apartments, a 120-unit complex managed by the Cabrillo Economic Development Corp., was the first new building on the site. The units were first offered to the residents of the Wagon Wheel Trailer Lodge. The demolition of the trailer park waited until completion of the first phase of the apartments that has five rent levels based on income and family size.Wenner, Gretchen (April 17, 2014) \\"Camping, for days, for a chance at affordable living\\" Ventura County Star Architecture The Wagon Wheel Motel and Restaurant was an example of American roadside architecture from the mid-century. The ranch-style office, motel and restaurant were originally built on the side of Highway 101 and Highway 101A (Alternate) in 1947. The office/restaurant complex incorporated a variety of roof lines, primarily low to medium pitched gables covered with wood shingles and punctuated by several decorative cupolas with weather vanes, and neon lighting. A free-standing 12-unit, two-story motel addition was completed in 1953. One of the most recognizable features of the motel was the giant neon sign that included an animated stagecoach driver and galloping horses. The Wagon Wheel was alongside the 101 freeway at the northern edge of a site between the Santa Clara River and the Esplanade Shopping Center. The site also included industrial buildings, a trailer park an ice skating rink, a former roller skating rink, a bowling alley and a shopping center, all of which were demolished for redevelopment as a development with retail, for sale residential, condos and two high-rise towers totaling 1500 residential units. The Wagon Wheel Bowling Alley was a 32-lane bowling alley built in the Wagon Wheel Junction across the street from the Wagon Wheel Motel in 1953. Designed by the Beverly Hills architect, Arthur Froehlich, known for his mid-century supermarkets and racetracks including the Hollywood Park Racetrack, and the Hanna Barbera Studio in Los Angeles 1962. The building had planer wall surfaces, an over-scaled wing wall and plate glass windows; the bowling alley included a restaurant and banquet room and was an example of the type of reductive Modernism that enjoyed great popularity in the mid-century. The bowling alley was known as Hoberg's after its proprietor, Ed Hoberg. The building was in continuous operation as a bowling alley from 1953 until May 2015. Demolition of the building began in October, 2015 as part of the Wagon Wheel area redevelopment.

School of the Prophets and Doctrine and Covenants Temple in Kirtland In Kirtland, the church's first temple was built. Work was begun in 1833, and the temple was dedicated in 1836. At and around the dedication, many extraordinary events were reported: appearances by Jesus, Moses, Elijah, Elias, and numerous angels; speaking and singing in tongues, often with translations; prophesying; and other spiritual experiences. Some Mormons believed that Jesus' Millennial reign had come. Smith may have first practiced polygamy during the building of the Kirtland temple.\\"LDS Church Authority and New Plural Marriages, 1890 - 1904\\", D.

Kirtland Safety Society By mid to late 1837, many Latter Day Saints (including some prominent leaders) became disaffected in the wake of the Kirtland Safety Society banking debacle, in which Smith and several of Smith's associates were accused of various illegal or unethical banking actions when the bank, with the charter held by Smith, collapsed just prior to a nationwide banking crisis. Many critics leveled accusations that Smith was actively misleading KSS members from the beginning of the financial enterprise as it was operating without an official Ohio bank charter and required reserves. Supporters of Smith, on the other hand, hold that the financial institution's collapse was more than partially due to state and federal financial regulations and that the charges against Smith and his associates are at best inflated. In the meantime, opposition and harassment grew against Smith and those of his associates who supported him. On January 12, 1838 Smith and Rigdon left Kirtland for Far West in Caldwell County, Missouri, in Smith's words, \\"to escape mob violence, which was about to burst upon us under the color of legal process to cover the hellish designs of our enemies.\\" Most of the remaining church members who remained loyal to Smith left Kirtland for Missouri shortly thereafter.

In 1844, after Smith was imprisoned in Carthage, Illinois, he was shot and killed when a mob stormed the jailhouse. Life in Nauvoo, Illinois, 1839 to 1842 In April 1839, Smith rejoined his followers who, having fled east from Missouri, had spread out along the banks of the Mississippi, near Quincy, Illinois. There, for both humanitarian and political reasons, the refugees had been welcomed.\\"There was chronic border friction between Missouri and Illinois, and the 'Suckers' welcomed the chance to demonstrate a nobility of character foreign to the despised 'Pukes.' More important, a presidential election was in the offing, and the Democratic Association, which controlled the votes in the quincy area, was eager to make friends with this huge new voting bloc. Fearful lest the Mormons turn Whig in bitterness against the Democratic government in Missouri they solicited funds for relieving the Mormons' distress and did their best to provide housing.\\" Fawn Brodie, 248-49. Purchasing waterlogged wilderness land on credit from two Connecticut speculators (who drove a hard bargain during this period of economic recession), Smith established a new gathering place for the Saints along the Mississippi in Hancock County.Bushman, 383-84. Smith also purchased land across the river in Iowa from a dishonest recent convert, Isaac Galland. Galland sold his land cheaply enough, but when courts finally straightened out the titles, Gallands' proved worthless. The 250 Mormon families who had settled had to return \\"penniless to Nauvoo.\\" Brodie, 262. He renamed the area \\"Nauvoo\\", which means \\"beautiful\\" in Hebrew.A similar Hebrew word appears in Isaiah 52: 7. Latter Day Saints often referred to Nauvoo as \\"the city beautiful\\", or \\"the city of Joseph\\"—which was actually the name of the city for a short time after the city charter was revokedor other similar nicknames) after being granted a charter by the state of Illinois. The soggy low land and river eddies were exceptional breeding grounds for mosquitoes, and the Saints suffered plagues of malaria in the summers of 1839, 1840, and 1841. (In 1841 malaria killed Joseph's brother Don Carlos and his namesake, Joseph's son Don Carlos, within a few days of one another.)Bushman, 384, 425. Late in 1839, Smith went to Washington to seek redress from the federal government for the Saints' losses in Missouri. He met briefly with President Martin Van Buren, but neither man seems to have thought much of the other, and the trip produced no reparations. Whatever sympathy Van Buren or Congress might have had for Mormon victims was canceled out by the importance of Missouri in the upcoming presidential election.Bushman, 392-93. Nevertheless, Smith shrewdly made Missouri a \\"byword for oppression\\" and \\"saw to it that the sufferings of his people received national publicity.\\"Brodie, 259. The editor of the Chicago Democrat wrote, \\"We will not go so far as to call the Mormons martyr-mongers, but we believe they are men of sufficient sagacity to profit by anything in the shape of persecution....The Mormons have greatly profited by their persecution in Missouri...let Illinois repeat that bloody tragedies of Missouri and one or two other states follow, and the Mormon religion will not only be known throughout our land, but will be very extensively embraced. March 25, 1840 in Brodie, 259. In a bold stroke, Smith sent off the Twelve Apostles to Great Britain to serve as missionaries for the new faith. All left families in desperate circumstances struggling to establish themselves in Iowa or Illinois. While Smith had been imprisoned, Brigham Young, the senior member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, had with indefatigable skill, brought the believers out of Missouri, and the Saints \\"had obeyed him implicitly.\\"Brodie, 258. But with Young and the others in Europe, Smith recovered his earlier prestige and authority. Meanwhile, the missionaries found many willing converts in Great Britain, often factory workers, poor even by the standards of American saints.Bushman (2005), 409; Brodie, 258, 264-65. Many converts came from dissatisfied members of English sects \\"along the margins of conventional church life.\\" On the previous religious beliefs of these Mormon converts, see Grant Underwood, The Millenarian World of Early Mormonism (Urbana: University of Illinois, 1993). The Mormon missionaries were shocked by the poverty they witnessed, and as Fawn Brodie has written, they \\"began to preach the glory of America along with the glory of the gospel.\\" The Mormon Millennial Star published in Liverpool \\"frequently had the ring of a real estate pamphlet.\\" Brodie, 264. These first trickled, then flooded, into Nauvoo, raising Smith's spirits.Bushman (2005), 410. Sac and Fox Indians who visited Nauvoo on August 12, 1841. In February 1841, Nauvoo received a charter from the state of Illinois, which granted the Latter Day Saints a considerable degree of autonomy. Smith threw himself enthusiastically into the work of building a new city. The charter authorized independent municipal courts, the establishment of a university, and the creation of a militia unit known as the \\"Nauvoo Legion.\\" Smith dreamed of industrial projects, and even received a revelation commanding the building of a hotel, \\"that strangers may come from afar to lodge therein.\\"Bushman (2005), 410-13; D&C;, 124: 23. The revelation (still included in the Mormon canon) specifically provided the amount of stock to be owned by any individual and granted a suite of rooms to Joseph Smith and his posterity \\"from generation to generation, for ever and ever.\\" D&C;, 124: 59. Work on a temple in Nauvoo began in the autumn of 1840. The cornerstones were laid during a conference on April 6, 1841. Construction took five years and it was dedicated on May 1, 1846; about four months after Nauvoo was abandoned by the majority of the citizens. =New doctrines= While burdened with the temporal business of creating a city, Smith also elaborated on the cosmology of the new religion. According to Richard Bushman, Smith moved from \\"a traditional Christian belief in God as pure spirit to a belief in His corporeality.\\"D&C;, 130: 22; Bushman (2005), 420. According to LDS theologian David L. Paulsen, this teaching was foreshadowed in the Book of Mormon by the story of the brother of Jared, although even Richard Bushman admits that the \\"doctrine of a corporeal God was not fully articulated until later.\\" David L. Paulsen, \\"The Doctrine of Divine Embodiment: Restoration, Judeo-Christian, and Philosophical Perspectives, BYU Studies 34, no. 4 (1995-96), 19-21. The earliest unequivocal statement of Joseph Smith was made at the opening of the Nauvoo Lyceum, January 5, 1841: \\"There is no other God in heaven but that God who has flesh and bone.\\" Kurt Widmer, Mormonism and the Nature of God: A Theological Evolution, 1830-1915 (Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland, 2000), 122. See also Douglas J. Davies, An Introduction to Mormonism (Cambridge University Press, 2003), 75-76. In other words, Smith declared that God had a body of flesh and bone and taught that \\"the great principle of happiness consists in having a body.\\"Bushman (2005), 421. Instead of affirming that there was an eternal God who had created matter, Smith taught that matter was eternal and that it was God who had developed through time and space. God only assembled the earth from preexisting materials and then had drawn on \\"a cohort of spirits from the pool of eternal intelligences to place upon it.\\"Bushman (2005), 421. In general see, Kurt Widmer, Mormonism and the Nature of God: A Theological Evolution, 1830-1915 (Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland, 2000). Widmer notes that Smith's \\"Doctrine of Eternal Progression\\" includes four components: that God is an exalted man; that man's spirit is co-equal with God and he can become a god; that there are innumerable gods who are progressing in knowledge; and that there is a \\"council or plurality\\" of gods.\\" (119) Another striking doctrine revealed to Smith after 1840 was baptism for the dead, an attempt to join \\"the generation of humanity from start to finish\\" by bringing \\"saving ordinances to the millions who had died without their benefits.\\"Bushman (2005), 422. During the same period, Smith published the Book of Abraham, his translation of what later turned out to be an ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead that he had purchased from a traveling exhibitor in 1835. The Book of Abraham, canonized by the LDS Church after Smith's death, also emphasized the plurality of gods, pre-mortal existence, and the concept that the earth had been organized out of preexisting matter.Bushman (2005), 452-58; Brodie, 170-75; Widmer, 90. The Book of Abraham was also used by later Mormons to justify discrimination against those with black skin because they were, like Pharaoh, descendants of Ham. These doctrinal expansions culminated in a renewed effort to build another temple. Smith chose a site on a bluff in Nauvoo where he blessed the cornerstones in a public ceremony on April 6, 1841. In Kirtland, Smith had instituted rituals of washing and anointing, but in Nauvoo \\"the ceremonies were further elaborated to include baptism for the dead, endowments, and priesthood marriages.\\"Bushman (2005), 448; Ostlings, 9; Davies, 205. Davies notes that \\"Baptism for the dead and covenant-endowments for the conquest of death both found their ultimate validation in the power of the priesthood yet these three elements are absent from the Book of Mormon, whose emphasis upon baptism is always a baptism of repentance of the living for themselves.\\" Smith did not live to see the completion or dedication of the temple. The Saints began to receive endowments on December 10, 1845, and the temple dedication was held on April 30, 1845, just before Nauvoo was abandoned. Smith had \\"a green thumb for growing ideas from tiny seeds,\\" and \\"portions of the temple ritual resembled Masonic rites that Joseph had observed when a Nauvoo lodge was organized in March 1842 and that he may have heard about from Hyrum, a Mason from New York days.\\"Bushman (2005), 449. Smith was initiated as an Entered Apprentice Mason at the Nauvoo lodge on March 15, 1842. The next day, he was raised to the degree of Master Mason; the usual month-long wait between degrees was waived by the Grand Master of Illinois, Abraham Jonas. Some commentators have noted similarities between portions of temple ordinance of the endowment and the Royal Arch Degree of Freemasonry. Richard Ostling and Joan K. Ostling, Mormon America: The Power and the Promise (Harper Collins, 1999), 188. \\"Smith was an active Mason when he introduced the endowment ordinance two years before his death, and many scholars have noted the strong resemblance between the Mormon ordinance and Masonic ritual.\\" See also: Freemasonry and the Latter Day Saint movement. Plural marriage =Revealed to Smith= The early years in Nauvoo had been a time of comparative peace and economic prosperity, but by mid-1842, Smith was entangled in the conflicts that ended with his death two years later.Bushman (2005), 436. A year previous, Missouri courts had once again tried to extradite him on old charges that stemmed from the Mormon War. Although Stephen Douglas, then a member of the Illinois State Supreme Court, declared the writ of extradition void on a technicality, Smith \\"realized that popular opinion was turning against the Saints after two years of sympathy.\\" Not surprisingly, Smith's praise for the Democrat Douglas first provoked opposition to the Mormons in a Whig newspaper, the Warsaw Signal, whose young editor, Thomas C. Sharp, Joseph then unwisely offended.Bushman (2005), 425-28. Prior to Smith's praise for Douglas, Sharp had been a \\"neutral observer\\" of the Nauvoo settlement. Smith had given him a place of honor at the dedication of the temple cornerstone and had invited him to his house for turkey dinner. After Sharp announced that his newspaper would \\"oppose the concentration of political power in a religious body, or in the hands of a few individuals,\\" Smith canceled his subscription and called the paper \\"a filthy sheet, that tissue of lies, that sink of iniquity,\\" and signed the letter \\"Yours, with utter contempt.\\" Emma Hale Smith, wife of Joseph Smith. Throughout her life, and even on her deathbed, Emma Smith denied that her husband had ever practiced polygamy.Emma Smith claimed that the very first time she ever became aware of a polygamy revelation being attributed by Mormons to Joseph Smith was when she read about it in Orson Pratt's booklet The Seer in 1853, Saints' Herald 65:1044–1045Church History, 3: 355-356. Of all Smith's innovations during the years immediately preceding his death, the one that received the most hostile reception was his institution of plural marriage. Joseph Smith married at least twenty-eight women.Bushman, 493; Compton, 4-7; Remini, 153-54; Brodie, \\"The Plural Wives of Joseph Smith,\\" Appendix C in No Man Knows My History, 2nd ed. (New York: Knopf, 1971), 457-88. Remini, 153. Brodie guessed that there might have been as many as 48 plural wives, but succeeding scholars have considered her numbers exaggerated. Remini said that the true number might have been as high as eighty-four, although many of these might have been \\"simply sacred sealings for eternity.\\" Remini, 153. Smith's biography in the Encyclopedia of Mormonism, 3: 1337, says that Smith took at least twenty-eight plural wives. On her deathbed, Emma Smith denied that her husband had ever practiced polygamy.Church History, 3: 355-356. In April 1841, Smith secretly wed Louisa Beaman as a plural wife, and during the next two and a half years, he may have married thirty additional women, ten of them already married to other men.Bushman (2005), 437; Remini, 151; Brodie, 335. Bushman follows the conservative reckoning of Todd Compton, In Sacred Loneliness: The Plural Wives of Joseph Smith (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 1997), excluding one. About a third of Smith's plural wives were teenagers, including two fourteen-year-old girls.Compton, 11; Remini,154; Brodie, 334-43. Smith was \\"a charismatic, handsome man,\\" and in Remini's words, he \\"seemed cheerful and gracious\\" to all.Bushman (2005), 439; Remini, 144. Because many husbands and fathers knew about these plural marriages, Smith must have convinced them that \\"they and their families would benefit spiritually from a close tie to the Prophet.\\"Bushman (2005), 439. Smith also told some women that an angel had commanded him to marry them, sometimes coming with \\"a drawn sword and threatened his life.\\" Brodie, 303. Smith told one prospective wife that submitting to plural marriage would \\"ensure your eternal salvation & exaltation and that of your father's household\\"; a father who gave his daughter in plural marriage was assured that the marriage would ensure \\"honor and immortality and eternal life to all your house both old and young.\\"Whitney, \\"Autobiography\\" [2]; Revelation, July 27, 1842, Revelations Collections; quoted in Bushman, 439; Martha Sonntag Bradley and Mary Brown Firmage Woodward, Plurality, Patriarchy, and Priestess: Zina D. H. Young's Nauvoo Marriages,\\" Journal of Mormon History 20 (1994): 84-118. Furthermore, once sealed for eternity by priesthood authority, Smith revealed that such couples would continue to procreate in the next life, becoming, in effect, gods.Bushman (2005), 439, 444; D&C; 132: 20: \\"Then shall they be gods, because they have no end; therefore shall they be from everlasting to everlasting, because they continue; then shall they be above all, because all things are subject unto them. Then shall they be gods, because they have all power, and the angels are subject unto them.\\" Smith surely \\"must have realized that plural marriage would inflict terrible damage, that he ran the risk of wrecking his marriage and alienating his followers.\\" And for those in the larger world, plural marriage \\"would confirm all their worst fears\\" about Mormonism. \\"Sexual excess was considered that all too common fruit of pretended revelation.\\"Bushman (2005), 438: \\"Joseph's enemies would delight in one more evidence of a revelator's antinomian transgressions. He also risked prosecution under Illinois's anti-bigamy law.\\" Although Emma believed in Joseph's prophetic calling, she was displeased with his multiple marriages, especially since five of the women lived in the Smith household when he married them.Leonard Arrington & Davis Bitton, The Mormon Experience (University of Illinois, 1979), 223; Bushman (2005), 491; Remini, 152-53; Brodie, 340-42: \\"Only Joseph's intimates knew that Emma nagged at him incessantly to be done with plural marriage....There was a hard core of resistance in Emma that Joseph simply could not wear down.\\" Emma may have temporarily approved of Joseph's marriage to two sisters, Eliza and Emily Partridge, but even they were an \\"awkward selection\\" because Joseph had already married the sisters two months previous, and he had to go through another ceremony for Emma's benefit.Bushman (2005), 494; Brodie, 339; Remini, 152-53. The day Joseph married the Partridge sisters, he bought Emma a new carriage. Nevertheless, \\"from that hour,\\" Emily later wrote, \\"Emma was our bitter enemy,\\" and they had to leave the household.Quoted in Brodie, 339. According to Smith's scribe, William Clayton, Joseph's brother Hyrum encouraged him to write down his revelation on plural marriage to present to Emma, and Joseph did so.Bushman (2005), 495-96. When Hyrum presented Emma with the revelation, she abused him.Bushman (2005), 496; Newell and Avery, 161. Hyrum said that he came away from Emma having \\"never received a more severe talking to in his life.\\" Later Joseph supposedly told his brother, \\"I told you you didn't know Emma as well as I did. Historical Record, 6: 224-26 (1887), quoted in Brodie, 341. Clayton reported that when Joseph reproved Emma for demanding from one plural wife a watch Joseph had given her, Joseph \\"had to use harsh measures to put a stop to [Emma's] abuse.\\"Bushman (2005), 496 quoting Clayton, Journal, August 16, 21, 23, 1843, Throughout her life and on her deathbed, Emma Smith frequently denied that her husband had ever taken additional wives.Emma claimed that the very first time she ever became aware of a polygamy revelation being attributed to Joseph by Mormons was when she read about it in Orson Pratt's booklet The Seer in 1853 (Saints' Herald 65:1044–1045). Emma campaigned publicly against polygamy and also authorized and was the main signatory of a petition in Summer 1842, with a thousand female signatures, denying that Joseph was connected with polygamy (Times and Seasons 3 [August 1, 1842]: 869). As president of the Ladies' Relief Society, Emma authorized publishing a certificate in October 1842 denouncing polygamy and denying her husband as its creator or participant (Times and Seasons 3 [October 1, 1842]: 940). In March 1844, Emma said, \\"we raise our voices and hands against John C. Bennett's 'spiritual wife system', as a scheme of profligates to seduce women; and they that harp upon it, wish to make it popular for the convenience of their own cupidity; wherefore, while the marriage bed, undefiled is honorable, let polygamy, bigamy, fornication, adultery, and prostitution, be frowned out of the hearts of honest men to drop in the gulf of fallen nature\\". The document The Voice of Innocence from Nauvoo. signed by Emma Smith as President of the Ladies' Relief Society, was published within the article Virtue Will Triumph, Nauvoo Neighbor, March 20, 1844 (LDS History of the Church 6:236, 241) including on her deathbed where she stated \\"No such thing as polygamy, or spiritual wifery, was taught, publicly or privately, before my husband's death, that I have now, or ever had any knowledge of...He had no other wife but me; nor did he to my knowledge ever have\\". Church History3: 355-356 Even when her sons Joseph III and Alexander presented her with specific written questions about polygamy, she continued to deny that their father had been a polygamist. As Fawn Brodie has written, this denial was \\"her revenge and solace for all her heartache and humiliation.\\" (Brodie, 399) \\"This was her slap at all the sly young girls in the Mansion House who had looked first so worshipfully and then so knowingly at Joseph. She had given them the lie. Whatever formal ceremony he might have gone through, Joseph had never acknowledged one of them before the world.\\" Newell and Avery wrote of \\"the paradox of Emma's position\\", quoting her friend and lawyer Judge George Edmunds who stated \\"that's just the hell of it! I can't account for it or reconcile her statements.\\" =Revealed to others= Although Smith's teachings about plural marriage were expressed in strict confidentiality and only to his leadership, the more men and women who participated, the more likely it became that these secret marriages would be revealed to the Nauvoo community and, of course, to the larger world.\\"Rumors of polygamy among the Mormons were not loud, but they were persistent....there was talk of it, talk that increased with the passing years.\\" Brodie, 186. When in 1841, Smith approached Joseph Bates Noble about marrying his wife's sister, Smith asked Bates to \\"keep quiet\\": \\"In revealing this to you I have placed my life in your hands, therefore do not in an evil hour betray me to my enemies.\\" Noble performed the ceremony \\"in a grove near Main Street with Louisa in man's clothing.\\" Bushman, 438.s By May 16, 1842, the New York Herald reported the rumor that \\"promiscuous intercourse\\" was being practiced in Nauvoo.Quoted in Brodie, 269. Yet Smith might have been able to talk down these reports along with other salacious gossip had it not been for his erstwhile second-in- command, John Cook Bennett.Ostlings, 32. Smith was not always a good judge of men,Ostlings, 32. Bushman says more discreetly that Smith \\"had trouble distinguishing true friends from self-serving schemers.\\" Bushman (2005), 410. and Bennett shortly became Smith's nemesis, although Smith had first predicted that Bennett was \\"calculated to be a great blessing to our community.\\"Bushman, 410. After arriving in Nauvoo in 1841, Bennett had been baptized into the new religion.Ostlings, 12. Emma never trusted him, but Joseph welcomed his assistance in acquiring the Nauvoo city charter. Soon Bennett became the first mayor of Nauvoo, “assistant president,” and Major General of the Nauvoo Legion.Ostlings, 12; Bushman, 459. The latter Bennett threatened to use in challenging Missouri for restitution of the Saints’ lost property, suggesting to skittish gentiles that Mormons intended to use force of arms to accomplish their objectives.Brodie, 273. Bennett wrote that the “blood of murdered Mormons cries aloud for help…and I swear by the Lord God of Israel, that the sword shall not depart from my thigh, nor the buckler from my arm, until the trust is consummated, and the hydra-headed fiery dragon slain.” Times and Seasons, 3 (March 15, 1842), 724. Unfortunately Smith had an eye for women and even began marrying other members wives.Bushman, 460. Bennett was afraid he was going to give the church the reputation of a sex cult so he left the church and started a newspaper.Brodie, 310; Bushman, 460. Bennett, a minimally trained doctor, also promised abortions to those who became pregnant.Smith was incensed at Bennett’s activities and forced Bennett’s resignation as Nauvoo mayor. In retaliation, Bennett remained in the area and wrote “lurid exposés of life in Nauvoo” that were first published in various newspapers and, later that year, compiled into a book.Ostlings, 12; Bushman, 461-62; Brodie, 314. Even contemporaries could hardly escape the conclusion that Bennett was, as Fawn Brodie called him, “a base and ignoble opportunist.” But the Ostlings note that “there was just enough of a kernel of truth to arouse internal suspicion and whip up anti-Mormon sentiment elsewhere.”Ostlings, 13. Non- Mormons looked with increasing uneasiness not only at reports of Mormon “free wifery” but at the comparative success of Nauvoo, the competent drilling of the Nauvoo Legion, and the growing political clout of the Saints. Smith was accused by Sarah Pratt in an 1886 interview with \\"vitriolic anti-Mormon journalist W. Wyl\\"The Prophet Joseph Smith and His Plural Wives , Anderson, Richard L. & Faulring, Scott H., FARMS Review of Books 10:2 of allowing John C. Bennett, a medical doctor, to perform abortions on polygamous wives who were officially single, which she alleged limited Smith's progeny from these wives. link She based this on statements made to her by Bennett.JOSEPH SMITH THE PROPHET: HIS FAMILY AND HIS FRIENDS, copy of Wilhelm Ritter von Wymetal's 1886 book link Orson Pratt, Sarah Pratt's husband, considered Bennett a liar\\"J.C. Bennett has published lies concerning myself & family & the people with which I am connected....His book I have read with the greatest disgust. No candid honest man can or will believe it. He has disgraced himself in eyes of all civilized society who will despise his very name,\\" () whereas Sarah Pratt herself said, \\"[I] know that the principle statements in John C. Bennett's book on Mormonism are true.\\" Allegations against Smith Profile of Joseph Smith (circa 1843) by Bathsheba W. Smith, first wife of Apostle George A. Smith On May 6, 1842, an unknown assailant shot former governor of Missouri Lilburn Boggs three times in the head.Bushman, 468. Sheriff J.H. Reynolds discovered a revolver at the scene, still loaded with buckshot and surmised that the suspect lost his friend in the dark rainy night. Bennett named a rough Mormon loyalist, Porter Rockwell, as the gunman. Mormons assumed Boggs would die and considered his assassination a fulfillment of prophecy. The Nauvoo Wasp indiscreetly gloated that the person who “did the noble deed remains to be found out.\\"Bushman, 468; Brodie, 323; Nauvoo Wasp, May 28, 1842. Boggs refused to die, however, and when he recovered, he pressed Illinois governor Thomas Carlin to extradite Smith to Missouri. Smith once again went into hiding for some months until the U. S. Circuit Court in Springfield finally ruled that the extradition order was unconstitutional.Bushman, 468-75. The court’s reasoning was that if Smith had committed a crime, it had been committed in Illinois not Missouri. Several doctorsincluding Boggs' brother pronounced Boggs all but dead; at least one newspaper ran an obituary. To everyone's great surprise, Boggs not only survived, but gradually improved. The popular pressand popular rumorwas quick to blame Smith's friend and sometime bodyguard Porter Rockwell for the assassination attempt. By some reports, Smith had prophesied that Boggs would die violently, leading to speculation that Smith was involved. Rockwell denied involvement, stating that he would not have left the governor alive if he had indeed tried to keep him alive. Also at about this time, Bennett had become disaffected from Smith and began publicizing what he said was Smith's practice of \\"Spiritual Wifery\\". (Bennett, earlier a pro-polygamy activist, knew of Smith's revelation on plural marriage and encouraged Smith to advocate the practice publicly. When this was rejected by Smith, Bennett began seducing women on his own and was subsequently excommunicated for practicing \\"Spiritual Wifery\\". He stepped down as Nauvoo mayorostensibly in protest of Smith's actionsand also reported that Smith had offered a cash reward to anyone who would assassinate Boggs. He also reported that Smith had admitted to him that Rockwell had done the deed and that Rockwell had made a veiled threat on Bennett's life if he publicized the story. Smith vehemently denied Bennett's account, speculating that Boggs no longer governor, but campaigning for state senatewas attacked by an election opponent. Bennett has been identified as \\"untruthful\\" by many historians and is seldom used as a reputable source. Critics suggested that Nauvoo's charter should be revoked, and the Illinois legislature considered the proposal. In response, Smith petitioned the U.S. Congress to make Nauvoo a territory. His petition was declined. Kinderhook Plates In April 1843, twelve men in Kinderhook, Pike County, Illinois, indicated they had found six small brass plates on the property of Robert Wiley. Wiley had indicated that he had dreamed on three consecutive nights of treasure being buried in a mound, which had caused the plates to be discovered. In reality, Wiley, W. Fugate, and a blacksmith named Whiddon had counterfeited the plates making the characters with an acid process. A letter was sent to the Times and Seasons revealing the discovery. An editorial was published on May 3, 1843 in the Quincy Whig observing that \\"some pretend to say that Smith, the Mormon leader, has the ability to read them\\" and that \\"it would go to prove the authenticity of the Book of Mormon.\\" After a few weeks had passed the plates were brought to Joseph Smith to be translated. Several men presented themselves at Smith's home with the plates to determine if Joseph could translate them. Williard Richards records that Joseph sent William Smith for a Hebrew Bible and lexicon, seemingly in an attempt to translate the plates in a conventional process. William Clayton, in a conflicting account, wrote in his journal: \\"I have seen 6 brass plates... covered with ancient characters of language containing from 30 to 40 on each side of the plates. Prest J. has translated a portion and says they contain the history of the person with whom they were found and he was a descendant of Ham through the loins of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and that he received his kingdom from the ruler of heaven and earth.\\" After this initial meeting, no further mention was ever made by Joseph Smith regarding translation of these plates. Smith may not have sensed the fraud; however he never pursued their translation.(Bushman, Rough Stone Rolling, p. 490) Whiddon, Wiley, and Fugate never said anything further regarding their fraud until 1879, when one of the party signed an affidavit revealing their fabrication and their desire to ensnare Smith. The plates were lost in the Civil War but re-discovered by a Mormon scholar in the archives of the Chicago Historical Society Museum in the 1960s. Non-destructive tests were permitted to be done in 1965 by a Mormon Physicist, George M. Lawrence. In his report Lawrence wrote: The dimensions, tolerances, composition and workmanship are consistent with the facilities of an 1843 blacksmith shop and with the fraud stories of the original participants.\\" This conclusion was not accepted by the Church at large and the original claim of Smith's translation persisted in Church books and publications until 1980 when conclusive tests were completed that determined the plates were made from a modern alloy. \\" Nauvoo Legion Among the powers granted to the City of Nauvoo under its city charter was the authority to create a \\"body of independent militarymen.\\" This force was a militia, and it became known as the \\"Nauvoo Legion\\". By 1842, the militia had 2,000 troops, and at least 3,000 by 1844, including some non-Mormons. In comparison, the U.S. Army had only 8,500 men in this period. Although the charter authorizing the Nauvoo Legion created an independent militia, it could be used by the state governor, the President of the United States, or the mayor of Nauvoo. Joseph Smith himself was Nauvoo's second mayor, and Nauvoo also appointed him highest ranking officer of the Legion, a Lieutenant General. This rank is one step above Major General which most contemporary militias employed as their commanding rank. One motive for the higher rank was to prevent Smith from being tried in a court martial by officers of lesser rank. In 1837 the Missouri militia had contemplated a court martial against Smith, a civilian at that time. In the last month of his life, June 1844, Smith declared martial law in Nauvoo and deployed the Legion to defend the city. Arrest attempt On 6 June 1843, Joseph Smith was indicted by a grand jury in the circuit court of Daviess County, Missouri on the charge of treason against the state. On June 13, 1843, Governor Reynolds dispatch Sheriff Joseph H. Reynolds to apprehend Smith. In Illinois, Reynolds was joined by Constable Harmon T. Wilson (of Hancock County, IL). On June 21, the two placed Smith under arrest when he was staying outside Nauvoo near Dixon, IL. Once they had Smith in their custody, Reynolds and Wilson were themselves placed under arrest by Sheriff Campbell of Lee County, IL. Campbell transported Smith, Reynolds, and Wilson to the Municipal Court of Nauvoo. On July 1, the Municipal Court of Nauvoo dismissed the warrant and freed Smith. United States presidential campaign Smith wrote to the leading presidential candidates and asked them what they would do to protect the Mormons. After receiving noncommittal or negative responses, Smith announced his own third- party candidacy for President of the United States, suspended regular proselytizing, and sent out the Quorum of the Twelve and hundreds of other political missionaries. The Anointed Quorum chose Sidney Rigdon as Smith's running mate.Bushman (2005), pp. 514–15; Brodie (1971), pp. 362–64 Smith proposed the redemption of slaves by selling public lands and decreasing the size and salary of Congress; the closure of prisons; the annexation of Texas, Oregon, and parts of Canada; the securing of international rights on high seas; free trade; and the re-establishment of a national bank. His top aide Brigham Young campaigned for Smith saying, \\"He it is that God of Heaven designs to save this nation from destruction and preserve the Constitution.\\" Political commitments Illinois governor Thomas Ford thought the summer's events presaged Smith's downfall, that a majority of Illinois residents were \\"determined upon driving the Mormons out of the State; and everything connected with the Mormons became political.\\"Thomas Ford, History of Illinois, From Its Commencement as a State in 1818 to 1847 (New York: Ivison and Phinney, 1854), 319. In December 1843, Smith petitioned Congress for the right to make Nauvoo an independent federal territory with the right to call out federal troops in its defense.Bushman, 511; Brodie, 356. Smith also threatened Congress. The Millennial Star later quoted Smith as having said, \\"if Congress will not hear our petition and grant us protection, they shall be broken up as a government and God shall damn them, and there shall be nothing left of them—not even a grease spot.\\" Quoted in Brodie, 356. Then, probably unwisely, Smith also decided to desert both Whigs and Democrats, and announce his own candidacy for President of the United States, sending out the apostles to advertise his campaign.Bushman, 514-15; Brodie, 362-64. Smith chose Sidney Rigdon as his running mate. Meanwhile, he made plans to scout possible sites for a large Mormon settlement in Oregon or California.Bushman, 519. In March 1844, Smith organized a secret Council of Fifty, a policy-making body based on what Smith called \\"Theodemocracy\\"Smith told a St. Louis reporter, \\"I go emphatically, virtuously, and humanely for a Theodemocracy, where God and the people hold the power to conduct the affairs of men in righteousness. And where liberty, free trade, and sailor's right [sic], and the protection of life and property shall be maintained inviolate, for the benefit of ALL.\\" (Quoted in Bushman, 522.) Nevertheless, as Bushman admits, to critics, \\"Joseph's plan for the Kingdom of God looked like a program for Mormon dominance.\\" The Council of Fifty (which originally had fifty-three members) included only three non-Mormons, two of whom were known counterfeiters. (Ostlings, 13). and which was in effect a shadow government.Bushman, 511; Ostlings, 13; Remini, 166; Robert Bruce Flanders, Nauvoo: Kingdom on the Mississippi (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1965), 292-94. One of the Council's first acts was to ordain Smith as King of the Kingdom of God. And, as if they had just organized an independent state, Smith and the Council sent ambassadors to England, France, Russia, and the Republic of Texas.Ostlings, 13. In April, Smith predicted \\"the entire overthrow of this nation in a few years.\\"Quoted in Bushman, 521. Smith's death =Dissent in Nauvoo= Smith faced growing opposition among his former supporters in Nauvoo, and he \\"was stunned by the defections of loyal followers.\\"Bushman (2005), 527. Chief among the dissidents was William Law, Smith's second counselor in the First Presidency, who was well respected in the Mormon community.Ostlings, 14. Law had taken Hyrum Smith's place in the First Presidency as second counselor. Brodie calls Law one of Smith's \\"ablest and most courageous men.\\" Brodie, 368. Law had been one of the few Saints to arrive in Nauvoo with capital; and he and his brother Wilson had purchased a considerable amount of land and constructed flour and lumber mills. Bushman (2005), 528. Brodie notes that Law came from Canada \\"a wealthy man\\" and had fostered \\"more than anyone else the sorely needed industrialization of the city.\\" Brodie, 368. Law's disagreement with Smith was partly economic.Law paid his workers in cash, but Smith \\"operated on scrip, credit, and tithed labor.\\" Law was also convinced that Smith was misappropriating money donated by church members to complete the Nauvoo House hotel in order to buy land and sell it to converts at a profit. Ostlings, 14; Brodie, 368. But the most significant difference between the two was Law's opposition to plural marriage. Law and others gave testimonies at the county seat in Carthage that resulted in three indictments being brought against Smith, including one accusing him of polygamy. There is even evidence that Smith propositioned the wives of both Law and his associate Robert D. Foster.Ostlings, 14.On the legal issues, see Edwin Brown Firmage and Richard Collin Mangrum, Zion in the Courts: A Legal History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 1830-1900 (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1988), 106-113. On May 26, just a few weeks before his death, Smith spoke before a large crowd of the Saints in front of the uncompleted temple and once again denied having any more than one wife.Smith stated \\"I had not been married scarcely five minutes, and made one proclamation of the Gospel, before it was reported that I had seven wives....I have rattled chains before in a dungeon for truth's sake. I am innocent of all these charges, and you can bear witness of my innocence, for you know me yourselves....What a thing it is for a man to be accused of committing adultery, and having seven wives, when I can only find one. I am the same man, and as innocent as I was fourteen years ago; and I can prove them all perjurers.\\"Address of the Prophet—His Testimony Against the Dissenters at Nauvoo, History of the Church, Period I, 6:408–412. Referring to Law, Smith stated \\"This new holy prophet has gone to Carthage and swore that I had told him that I was guilty of adultery. This spiritual wifeism! Why, a man dares not speak or wink, for fear of being accused of this\\". History of the Church, 6:410–411. Bushman argues that, while to Smith's enemies \\"the speech was blatant hypocrisy\\", in Smith's mind \\"priesthood plural marriage was based on another principle than polygamy.\\" Bushman (2005), 538 =Nauvoo Expositor= Unlike earlier dissenters Law had enough money to buy a printing press and publish a newspaper called the Nauvoo Expositor. Its only edition, published on June 7, 1844, contained affidavits testifying that the signers had heard Smith read a revelation giving every man the privilege of marrying ten virgins. The paper also attacked the attempt to \\"christianize a world by political schemes and intrigue\\" and denounced \\"false doctrines\\" such as \\"doctrines of many Gods,\\" which, the paper said, Smith had recently revealed in his King Follett discourse. The newspaper also refused to \\"acknowledge any man as king or lawgiver to the church.\\";, p. 312 Smith declared the Expositor a \\"nuisance.\\" On June 10, the Nauvoo city council passed an ordinance about libels; and Smith, as mayor, ordered the city marshal to destroy the paper.Bushman, 540; ; , 312; J. L. Clark writes that Hyrum's statement \\"appeared in the Nauvoo Neighbor of June 19, 1844, but was omitted from the History of the Church\\" (); ; . The council met on June 8 and June 10 to discuss the matter; Press, type, and newspapers were dragged into the street and burned. Smith argued that destroying the paper would lessen the possibility of anti-Mormon settlers attacking Nauvoo; but he \\"failed to see that suppression of the paper was far more likely to arouse a mob than the libels. It was a fatal mistake.\\"Bushman, 541. Carthage Jail (c. 1885), where Smith was killed in 1844 When the destruction of the Expositor was reported to Smith's journalistic enemy Thomas C. Sharp, his Warsaw Signal published a call to action: \\"Citizens arise, one and all!!! Can you stand by, and suffer such Infernal Devils! to rob men of their property and rights without avenging them. We have no time for comment, every man will make his own. Let it be made with Powder and Ball!!!\\"Warsaw Signal, June 14, 1844. Nauvoo Mormons feared reprisals from the non-Mormons, and non-Mormons were apprehensive about the Nauvoo Legion, especially after Smith declared martial law on June 18. Illinois Governor Thomas Ford, desperately trying to prevent civil war, then mobilized the state militia.Ostlings, 16. The governor promised Smith that he would provide protection if Smith would stand trial at Carthage for the destruction of the newspaper. Smith ordered the Legion to disarm but then fled across the Mississippi to Iowa. Emma warned Joseph that Nauvoo residents believed he had left due to cowardice and that they feared reprisals from local mobs. Smith returned to Illinois on June 23, gave himself up, and was taken to Carthage to stand trial.Ostlings, 17; Bushman, 546. Eight Mormon leaders accompanied Smith to Carthage: Hyrum Smith, John Taylor, Willard Richards, John P. Greene, Stephen Markham, Dan Jones, John S. Fullmer, Dr. Southwick, and Lorenzo D. Wasson. All of Smith's associates left the jail, except his brother Hyrum, Richards and Taylor. =Assassination= The murder of Joseph and Hyrum Smith Pepper-box pistol used by Joseph Smith to defend himself on June 27, 1844 After a hearing, Smith was released but stayed in the jail at the request of Governor Dunklin as there were to be additional charges filed the following day. According to Taylor and Richards, Dunklin promised to take Smith back to Nauvoo; however, he left Carthage without him. Smith and three other Mormon prisoners were held in Carthage Jail in an upstairs room without bars. Both Hyrum and Joseph Smith had pistols that had been smuggled in by friends.Bushman, 549: \\"Joseph spent Thursday, June 27, preparing for the treason trial scheduled for Saturday. He gave a long list of witnesses to Cyrus Wheelock, who earlier in the day had smuggled in a six-shooter in his overcoat. John Fullmer had previously given Joseph a single-shot pistol, which he passed along to Hyrum.\\" On June 27, 1844, an armed group of men with blackened faces stormed the jail. As the mob broke into the room, Hyrum was shot in the face and killed.Bushman, 550: \\"Hyrum was the first to fall. A ball through the door struck him on the left side of the nose, throwing him to the floor.\\" Smith pulled the trigger of his pepper-box six times, firing into the hall and hitting three men, but the mob continued to fire at Smith and the other Mormons.Brodie, 393: \\"Joseph now discharged all six barrels down the passageway. Three of them missed fire, but the other three found marks.\\" Bushman, 550. Richards was unharmed. Taylor was shot several times, but survived. (One of the bullets glanced off his pocket watch.); Smith prepared to jump from the second floor window, but was hit by a ball from the door, causing him to fall out the window. On the ground he stirred a bit; four men fired and killed him.Brodie, 393-94. Bushman has a slightly different scenario, \\"A ball from the doorway struck his hip, and a shot from the outside entered his chest. Another hit under the heart and a fourth his collarbone. He fell outward crying, \\"O Lord my God!\\" Landing on his left side, he struggled to sit up against the curb of a well and died within seconds.\\" =Aftermath= Certain the Mormons would retaliate, the people of Carthage deserted their town by nightfall. But the bodies of Joseph and Hyrum were brought back to Nauvoo, and thousands of mourners filed by their coffins. Fearing desecration of the graves, church leaders decided to bury the men in the basement of the unfinished Nauvoo House. The coffins were filled with bags of sand and buried in the cemetery following a public funeral.Arrington and Bitton, 82; Remini, 174-75. The remains were disinterred in 1928 on the orders of Smith's grandson Frederick M. Smith, then President of the RLDS Church, and reburied along with Smith's wife Emma in a location thought to be safer from Mississippi flooding. http://farms.byu.edu/publications/bookschapter.php?bookid=&chapid;=264 Black, S.E.

The rule is based upon the deceptively simple notion of first-in, first-out to determine the effect of payments from an account, and normally applies in English Law in the absence of evidence of any other intention. Payments are presumed to be appropriated to debts in the order in which the debts are incurred. Facts Mr. Clayton had an account with a banking firm, Devaynes, Dawes, Noble, and Co, that was a partnership rather than a joint stock company as modern banks almost always are. The bank's partners were therefore personally liable for the debts of the bank. One of the partners, William Devaynes, died in 1809. The amount then due to Clayton was £1,717. After Mr. Devaynes' death, Clayton made further deposits with the bank and the surviving partners paid out to Mr. Clayton more than the £1,717 on deposit at the time of Mr. Devaynes' death. The firm went bankrupt in 1810. Judgment Sir William Grant, Master of the Rolls, held that the estate of the deceased partner was not liable to Clayton, as the payments made by the surviving partners to Clayton must be regarded as completely discharging the liability of the firm to Clayton at the time of the particular partner’s death. Significance The ruling was based on the legal fiction that, if an account is in credit, the first sum paid in will also be the first to be drawn out and, if the account is overdrawn, the first sum paid in is allocated to the earliest debit on the account which caused the account to be overdrawn. It is generally applicable in cases of running accounts between two parties, e.g., a banker and a customer, moneys being paid in and withdrawn from time to time from the account, without any specific indication as to which payment out was in respect of which payment in. In such case, when final accounts, which may run over several years, are made up, debits and credits will be set off against one another in order of their dates, leaving only a final balance to be recovered from the debtor by the creditor. The rule is only a presumption, and can be displaced. The rule is one of convenience and may be displaced by circumstances or by agreement. In Commerzbank Aktiengesellschaft v IMB Morgan plc and others [2004] EWHC 2771 (Ch), the court elected to not apply the rule on the fact of the case (sums held in bank accounts derived from victims of Nigerian advance fee frauds). Notwithstanding the criticisms sometimes levelled against it, and despite its antiquity, the rule is commonly applied in relation to tracing claims where a fraudster has commingled unlawfully obtained funds from various sources. =Exception to the rule= The rule does not apply to payments made by a fiduciary out of an account which contains a mixture of trust funds and the fiduciary's personal money. In such a case, if the trustee misappropriates any moneys belonging to the trust, the first amount so withdrawn by him will not be allocated to the discharge of his funds held on trust but towards the discharge of his own personal deposits, even if such deposits were in fact made later in order of time. In such cases, the fiduciary is presumed to spend their own money first before misappropriating money from the trust; see Re Hallett's Estate (1879) 13 Ch D 696. The rule is founded on the principles of equity. If a fiduciary has mixed his or her own money with sums of trust money in a private account, withdrawals are attributed to his or her own money as far as possible, Re MacDonald [1975] Qd R 255. However, if the funds of two beneficiaries, or of a beneficiary and an innocent volunteer, are mixed the rule determines their respective entitlements, Re Diplock.[1948] Ch 465, 547-548 =Applications to a partnership= The rule has special application in relation to partnerships upon the death of a partner. In most jurisdictions, the death of a partner ordinarily has the legal effect of dissolution. The partners' personal representatives have no right to step into the partner's shoes; they cannot take part in its management; they can only claim the deceased partner's share in the assets of the firm. The banker, who provides financial accommodation to the firm, can have no objection in continuing the account; the bank can presume that the surviving partners will account to the representatives of the deceased for his share in the assets. Where the firm has a debit balance, the account should be stopped to fix the liability of the estate of the deceased partner and to avoid the operation of the rule in Clayton's case.

In literature his name is sometimes spelled as Grigor Efimowitsch Grumm-Grzhimailo or Grigory Yefimovich Grumm-Grzhimaylo. Life and work Born in St. Petersburg, his early interest was in the phylloxera problem in the vineyards of N. Y. Danilevsky. He wrote his first scientific work at the age of 21 on some Lepidoptera of the Crimea (1882, vol. 8 of the Proceedings of the Russian Entomological Society). He was associated with Professor M. N. Bogdanov at the St. Petersburg Museum and contributed many of his own collections to it. He also studied the collections of the museum that had been made by Nikolai Przhevalsky, Grigory Potanin, Pyotr Semyonov-Tyan-Shansky, and other explorers of Central Asia. From 1882, Grum-Grshimailo studied Lepidoptera from the Bessarabia, Podolia Governorate, Crimea, and the Baltic and got interested in zoogeography. While collecting near Sarepta, he met the German collector Rückbeil. He also met the Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhailovich Romanov who suggested that he should publish his work. He also promised his support for an expedition to the Pamirs. In 1884, he started his first Pamir expedition on which he visited the Alai Mountains, ascending the Trans-Alai range via Pass Tersagarsky to reach the upper Muksu River to reach Fedchenko's glacier. He visited Lake Karakul and returned. He collected 12,000 specimens, thirty of which were new to science. Spurred by the interest to his work, he made a second expedition in 1885 visiting Karateghin, Darvaz, Bukhara Khanate, Ghissar, Kulyab, Beldzhuan, Shakhrisiabz, Karshi, Guzara, Shirabad, Kabadian, and Kurgan-Tyube. This time he collected 20,000 specimens of insects. His third expedition was in 1886 along the Kara-Darya, via Pass Kugart, then up along the Naryn valley to the Narynsky Fortress (now the town of Naryn), and from there to the south toward At-Bashi and further to the southwest along the broad valley of At-Bashi River, by the At-Bashi Mt. Range, along the Great Silk Route to Tash-Rabat and Lake Chatyr-Kul. They went until Kashgar and then via Pass Irkeshtam and back to Osh. Expeditions conducted with his younger brother Lieutenant M. Y. Grigory Grum-Grshimailo between 1889 and 1890 were intended to bring back specimens of Przewalski's horse . After capturing two wild horses in the vicinity of Gushen (44° N 90°30' E), and no longer afraid that shooting would frighten the animals away they managed to collect 1,048 bird specimens. They traveled 8,600 km.Rodolphe Meyer De Schauensee 1984. The Birds of China. Oxford University Press He made several more expeditions in the succeeding years but he later lost much of the early interest in entomology owing in part to a conflict with the sponsor of his expeditions. A term was that the materials he collected were to go to Grand Duke Nicholas Mikhaylovich Romanov, but he needed a private collection. He was accused of embezzling material and financial difficulties made him sell part of his collection to Henry John Elwes. He was awarded the Constantine Medal in 1907 by the Imperial Russian Geographical Society.

The verb in these constructions is always the copula be (am, are, is, was, were). Inverse copular constructions are intriguing because they render the distinction between subject and predicative expression difficult to maintain. The confusion has led to focused study of these constructions,Inverse copular constructions have been explored in great depth. See Moro (1997) for the original proposal, Heycock and Kroch (1998), Pereltsvaig (2001), Mikkelsen (2005). and their impact on the theory of grammar may be great since they appear to challenge the initial binary division of the sentence (S) into a subject noun phrase (NP) and a predicate verb phrase (VP) (S → NP VP), this division being at the core of all phrase structure grammars (as opposed to dependency grammars, which do not acknowledge the binary division).  Examples  Inverse copular constructions involve nouns and noun phrases, but they do not allow the post-copula nominal to be a personal pronoun: ::a. The cause of the riot is a picture on the wall. ::b. A picture on the wall is the cause of the riot. ::c. *A picture on the wall is it. ::a. Fred is the plumber. ::b. The plumber is Fred. ::c. *The plumber is he. The defining trait of the inverse copular constructions is that two counts of inversion appear to have occurred: the normal subject has inverted to a post-verb position, and the predicative nominal has inverted to the pre-verb position. The verb is a finite form of the copula 'be' (am, are, is, was, were). This type of inversion is generally NOT possible with other verbs.  Subject-verb agreement  Inverse copular constructions where the inverted predicative expression is a noun phrase are noteworthy in part because subject-verb agreement can (at least in English) be established with the pre-verb predicative NP as opposed to with the post-verb subject NP, e.g. ::a. The pictures are a problem. ::b. A problem is/??are the pictures. ::a. Those kids are an annoyance. ::b. An annoyance is/??are those kids. In the inverse copular constructions, the copula agrees with the singular predicative expression to its left as opposed to with the plural subject to its right. This phenomenon seems to be limited to English (and possibly French); it does not occur in related languages such as German, e.g. ::a. Die Bilder sind ein Problem. :::'The pictures are a problem.' ::b. Ein Problem sind/*ist die Bilder. :::'A problem are/is the pictures.' Nor does it occur in some Romance languages, e.g. Italian: ::a. Queste foto sono la causa della rivolta. :::'These photos are the cause of the revolt.' ::b. La causa della rivolta sono/*è queste foto. :::'The cause of the revolt are/is the photos.' The fact that English (unlike German and Italian) demands subject-verb agreement to occur with the pre-verb NP generates confusion about what should qualify as the subject NP. From a morphological point of view, the pre-verb NP in inverse copular constructions should count as the subject, but from the perspective of information structure (e.g. definiteness, old information, specificity), the post-verb NP should be the subject.  Importance for the theory of grammar  Inverse copular constructions challenge one of the major dogmas of the theory of clause or sentence structure, i.e. that the two basic constituents of a sentence - the noun phrase (NP) and the verb phrase (VP) - are associated with the logical/grammatical functions of subject and predicate (cf. phrase structure rules and sentence). In fact, copular sentences that maintain the canonical groupings are not adequate on empirical grounds, since a very unorthodox left-branching structure is necessary, or if one rejects the canonical groupings and positions the subject inside a VP-like constituent, then one has to assume that the subject NP and copula verb can form a type of VP to the exclusion of the predicative expression.

It is today home to the National Institute of Oceanography, and just alongside it lie the Goa University and the International Centre Goa. It is also home to a number of hotels, small and large, and the luxury resort Cidade de Goa is situated in the area.  History  The place is named after Da. Paula Amaral Antonia de Souto-Maior, a historical figure in Portuguese India. She was related to the Portuguese Viceroy of Jaffnapatnam in Sri Lanka. She and her family arrived in Goa in 1744 and she married a Fidalgo from Spain in 1756. Her father was D. Antonio Caetano de Menezes Souto-Maior. They were an extremely affluent family, and the entire property from the present day Cabo Raj Nivas all the way to Caranzalem belonged to the Souto-Maior family. She died on 21 December 1782. Dona Paula was a woman of charity and is known to have helped the villagers and worked a lot for their betterment, so after her death, the villagers decided to rename the village as Dona Paula. Initially the village was called Oddavell. The Dona Paula Beach is also a major tourist attraction. According to a local myth, Dona Paula is entombed in the Cabo Chapel, the residence of the Governor of Goa and is supposed to be seen emerging from the moonlit waves wearing only a pearl necklace. Several tourists as well as locals guided by this myth visit the beach for a glimpse of Dona Paula. The Cabo Raj Bhavan is situated at a scenic spot in Dona Paula. It is also home of a historic British war-graves cemetery. After the end of Portuguese rule in Goa in 1961, Dona Paula became a fashionable residential area and address. MYTHICAL OLD LOVE STORY ABOUT DONA PAULA : Another quite interesting old story has been linked with this Dona Paula beach. Some claim that this is just a rumour, but others say that this story had been linked with an old Portuguese scripture. This story is as follows. Dona Paula was the young daughter of Portuguese Viceroy Don Antonia Caetano de Menezes, and fell in love with a local Goan fisherman. When the Viceroy found out about their affair, he became very angry and forbade his daughter to meet her lover again. Extremely sad and upset, Dona Paula couldn't think of life without the fishermen. She felt unbearable pain and immense sorrow without him. When this pain become insufferable, she decided to end her life. In the name of her immortal love, she drowned herself in the Arabian Sea. This way, a true love story came to an end and become a historical reminiscence. When the Viceroy knew that he had lost his beloved daughter, he was overwhelmed with sorrow and grief. Left with nothing but the memories of his innocent daughter, he decided to name the Arabian Sea area \\"Dona Paula\\". This place is a tribute to an eternal romance and love, and gives a message that, if you are ever going to love someone, it should be like Dona Paula's, pure and heartwarming. Vicinity  Dona Paula is the home to some of the top industrialists and policy makers of the state. It is also the most expensive residential location in Goa. The Raj Bhavan of Goa is located near the La Marvel Colony in Dona Paula. Tourism Dona Paula is located on the sea stretch that spans from Panjim, Miramar and Dona Paula is an area frequented by tourists. During the tourist season, Dona Paula transforms into a crowded stretch which is otherwise a calm place during monsoons. A large part of the Hindi movie Ek Duuje Ke Liye was shot here, popularising the place further. An action sequence from Rohit Shetty's movie Singham was shot here. The idyllic rocky tourist attraction lies at the spot where the Mandovi and the Zuari rivers meet and confluences with the Arabian Sea at a distance of 1 km from this point. One of the attractions in Dona Paula is a whitewashed statue perched on the rocks near the ferry jetty.

The pass is located on Chief Joseph Scenic Byway and crosses the Absaroka Range. Dead Indian Creek runs at the base of the pass. Near the pass are also Dead Indian Gulch, Dead Indian Mountain, and Dead Indian Mesa The flight of the Nez Perce Dead Indian Pass is associated with the flight of the Nez Perce Indians during the Nez Perce War in 1877. Pursued by several hundred soldiers led by General O.O. Howard, Chief Joseph led 700 Nez Perce men, women, and children and 2,000 horses through Yellowstone Park eastward and into the Absaroka Mountains. From the Absarokas the Indians looked for a route to the Great Plains. However, the U.S. army had anticipated that the Nez Perce would attempt to break out of the mountains onto the Plains and had stationed General Samuel D. Sturgis and 600 cavalry near the base of the mountains to intercept the Indians. Sturgis's forces were strategically placed where he could move quickly south or north toward known trails along Clarks Fork or the Shoshone River. Sturgis discounted the Clark's Fork exit from the mountains, \\"finding that no trail could possibly lead through it.\\" The lower several miles of Clark's Fork passed through a narrow canyon with vertical walls. Clarks Fork Canyon. The Nez Perce descended from Dead Indian Pass into Clark's Fork Canyon via a narrow defile in the rock walls. On September 8, 1877, the Nez Perce reached Dead Indian Pass, about six miles from Sturgis's force on the Plains below. Their advance scouts observed the soldiers far below awaiting their appearance. If the Indians took the open and easy route to reach the Plains, they would be easily visible. Instead, they attempted a difficult maneuver to mislead the soldiers. They feinted going south toward the Shoshone River by milling their horses in a big circle to kick up visible dust and sell Sturgis on the idea that they were heading south. Then, invisible to army scouts, they sneaked back north, concealed by heavy timber, and traversed Dead Indian Gulch down to the Clark's Fork River. Dead Indian Gulch was a narrow, steep-sided slit in the rock, dropping almost vertically for 1,000 feet and barely wide enough for two horses to go side-by-side. \\"In a cleanly executed maneuver,\\" said a military historian, \\"the Nez Perce had countered an extremely serious threat and won a brilliant, though temporary respite.\\" Sturgis took the bait and led his soldiers away from the Clark's Fork and headed south to the Shoshone. The Nez Perce passed out onto the Great Plains unopposed. Sturgis quickly realized his error and turned around. He met up with Howard on September 11 who had descended the Clark's Fork following the Nez Perce's route, but the two military forces were now two days and 50 miles behind the Nez Perce. The U.S. army would not finally corner and defeat the Nez Perce until nearly a month later at the Battle of Bear Paw.Brown, pp. 355–356, 388–409 Origin of the name There are two accounts of the naming of Dead Indian Pass. The first refers to the Nez Perce flight in 1877. A Nez Perce was reputedly killed near the pass and it acquired the name. The second account states that in 1878 Col. Nelson A. Miles and his soldiers encountered a group of Bannock Indians. The Crow Indian Scouts killed a Bannock and buried him here.Chapple, Janet, Yellowstone Treasures (2013), Lake Forest Park, WA: Granite Peak Publications, 4th edition, pp. 195–196.

Among others, he was the last person to hold the post of Government Delegate for Poland. Arrested by the NKVD in 1945, he was released soon afterwards only to be forced into exile. He settled in the United States, where he remained active among the local Polish diaspora. An active journalist, he was among the few people whose names were completely banned by the communist censorship in Poland. Early life Stefan Korboński was born 2 March 1901 in Praszka near Wieluń.Stefan Korbonski The Polish Underground State Hippocrenre, 1981 In 1908 his family moved to Częstochowa, where Korboński received basic education at the local gymnasium. However, already in 1918 he joined the ranks of the Lwów Eaglets as a volunteer and took part in the Defence of Lwów. After the besieged city had been liberated, he returned home and volunteered for the Polish Army at the outbreak of the Polish-Soviet War. Demobilized after the end of hostilities, he did not return home and instead volunteered for the third time - this time joining the ranks of the troops of the Third Silesian Uprising. For his service in various formations he was awarded with the Virtuti Militari and the Silesian Cross.Stefan Korbonski Fighting Warsaw Hippocrenre, 2004 Page 4 After the Polish conflicts for the borders ended, Korboński passed his matura exams and joined the Adam Mickiewicz University of Poznań, where he graduated from the faculty of law. During his studies he became involved in politics and joined the ranks of the Polish People's Party \\"Wyzwolenie\\" and then, in 1931, the People's Party. Following his application, he started working in the local Prosecutors Office and in 1929 opened up his own practice in Warsaw. He also quickly rose through the ranks of his party and in 1936 became its chairman for the Białystok Voivodeship (1919-1939). Korboński married Zofia Ristau on 10 July 1938. World War II activities Prior to the outbreak of World War II he was mobilized for the Polish Army and commissioned to the 57th Infantry Regiment in the rank of First Lieutenant. During the Polish Defensive War his unit got surrounded by the Red Army and Korboński himself was taken prisoner by the NKVD. However, he managed to escape and reach the German-occupied part of Poland. He help found the Polish underground as an active member of the Union of Armed Struggle (ZWZ) and then the Armia Krajowa.Stefan Korbonski Fighting Warsaw Hippocrenre, 2004 Page 3 Simultaneously, he was also one of the leaders of the clandestine People's Party, active within the system of the Polish Secret State. As such in 1940 he became a member of the Political Communications Committee, a clandestine political platform attached to the underground army as its political arm and a nucleus of the future parliament. Supported by most parties, already in April of the following year he became the chief of the Directorate of Civil Struggle, the agenda of the Polish government responsible for the coordination and organization of civilian resistance, information and propaganda. During his term at the office, Korboński also extended the responsibilities of the Directorate by including maintaining law and order, organizing a net of underground civil courts and coordinating carrying out their verdicts by the National Security Corps. Korboński in December 1942 became head of Directorate of Civil Resistance.Richard Lukas Forgotten Holocaust Hippocrene, 1990 Page 96 It was Korboński who informed the London-based Poles that the slaughter of Jews in the Warsaw Ghetto had started. The BBC broadcast the information.Richard Lukas Forgotten Holocaust Hippocrene, 1990 Page 156-157 In July 1943 Korboński also became the head of the Social Resistance Department of the Directorate of Underground Resistance. Following the outbreak of the Warsaw Uprising in August 1944, Korboński became the chief of the Department of Internal Affairs, a de facto minister of internal affairs of Poland. However, the fall of the Uprising put an end to that duty. Korboński managed to leave Warsaw as a civilian and continued his duties in hiding. In March 1945, after the NKVD arrested Jan Stanisław Jankowski, Korboński became the last Government Delegate at Home and held that post until his arrest by the NKVD in June of the same year, during which time he worked to rebuild Government Delegacy.Richard Lukas Forgotten Holocaust Hippocrene, 1990 Page 25Anita prazmowska Civil War in Poland, 1942-1948 Palgrave, 2004 Page 154Jozef Garlinski Poland in the Second World War Macmillan, 1985 Page 341 Postwar career Released from Soviet prison following the creation of the communist- controlled Provisional Government of National Unity, he returned to the bar and active political career within the reactivated Polish People's Party, the most popular party in Poland at the time and the main opposition force to the Soviet-backed communist regime. 30 of the 145 seats in the post-war government were offered to non-Soviet supported group and it was planned for Korboński to be part of the post-war government but his name was removed by Bierut.Stanislaw Mikolajczyk The Pattern of Soviet Domination Sampson Low, Martston & Co, 1948 Page 168 In the forged 1947 elections he was also elected a member of the Sejm.

It has numerous common names, including: buffalo gourd, calabazilla, chilicote, coyote gourd, fetid gourd, fetid wild pumpkin, Missouri gourd, prairie gourd, stinking gourd, wild gourd, and wild pumpkin. The type specimen was collected from Mexico by Alexander von Humboldt and Aimé Bonpland sometime before 1817. The feral perennial buffalo gourd has evolved in the semiarid regions and is well-adapted to desert environments. It contains high amounts of protein and carbohydrates and yields abundant oil. The carbohydrates that are formed in the tap root have led to the idea of growing the plant for biofuel. The fruit is consumed by both humans and animals. When mature, a stage marked by increasing desiccation of vine, leaves, fruit-stem, and fruit, the fruit begins its final gourd stage. Geographic location and genetics make it highly likely that Cucurbita scabridifolia originated as a naturally occurring hybrid of C. foetidissima and Cucurbita pedatifolia. Morphology and cultivation Cucurbita foetidissima requires little water and grows best in semiarid and arid environments. Warm weather is required during the five- to eight-month vegetation period. This perennial is well adapted to marginal agricultural lands such as sandy loam soils which have to be well-drained. Germination temperature range is between 15 °C and 37 °C with an optimum at 25 °C. The maximum depth for a successful germination is 12 cm. The germination is possible in a pH range from 2.2 (germination rate 15%) up to pH 8 (germination rate 90%). Asexual propagation is possible from nodal roots. The leaves of the buffalo gourd are typically entire and heart-shaped with a base of and length of . The flowers are borne singly at the nodes of the vines after a certain amount of annual vegetative growth has taken place. The fruit has a diameter of . The fruit weighs 120 g to 150 g, with 292 to 315 seeds per fruit. The seeds, which are long and wide, weigh about 4 g per 100 seeds, with the seed coat accounting for about 30% of the seed weight. The seeds often remain viable for months or even years within an undamaged gourd. One hectare of plants can produce 2.5 tons of seed. The plant forms a fleshy tap root which is used as a storage and overwintering structure. The central tap root can weigh up to . A four-year-old root grown under cultivation can reach a fresh weight of and a length of . Distribution Cucurbita foetidissima is native to North America in the central and southwestern United States (Arizona; Arkansas; southern California; Colorado; Kansas; Missouri; southern Nebraska; southern Nevada, New Mexico; Oklahoma; Texas; and southern Utah) and Mexico (Aguascalientes; Chihuahua; Coahuila; Guanajuato; Guerrero; Hidalgo; northern Jalisco; Mexico; Nuevo León; Querétaro; San Luis Potosí; Sonora; Tamaulipas; and Zacatecas).Biota of North America Program 2014 county distribution mapSEINet, Southwestern Biodiversity, Arizona chapter Uses The buffalo gourd has the potential of being a crop adapted to arid to semiarid lands. *Fresh gourd: The fresh young gourd can be eaten like squash. The mature fruit is no longer edible, due to bitter compounds. *Seeds: Eaten after being prepared by roasting or boiling. *Oil: The extractable oil content in whole seeds reaches from 24.3% to 50%. Linoleic acid, an essential polyunsaturated fatty acid, comprises 38% to 65% of the oil. A characterization of the oils from buffalo gourd indicates that this oil is similar to other common edible oils. *Protein: Whole Buffalo gourd seeds contain approximately 31% crude protein, which is usable for human consumption and for feed. *Starch: Is mainly located in the tap root which forms after the first year of growth. The starch content in the dried root is between 47.5% and 56%. *Fodder: Fresh leaves or the whole plants can be used as animal food. *Biofuel: Biodiesel can be produced from the oil in the seeds. But the main interest to produce renewable fuels is to produce biofuel with the carbohydrates which are located in the tap root. *Other uses: In many Native American cultures, the fruit and other parts of the plant, buffalo gourd oil, are used for soap. Furthermore, the protein can be used for industrial purposes (water paints, paper coating, adhesives and textile sizing). The Zuni people use a poultice of powdered seeds, flowers and saliva for swellings. (p. 375) C. foetidissima contains a saponin that can be obtained from the fruit and root. This can be used as a soap, shampoo, and bleach. Prolonged contact can cause skin irritation.  Pests  Various insects may penetrate the hard skin of the gourd. External structures appear to prevent damage by most insects and the plant is highly resistant to cucumber beetle and squash bug. White molds seem to result in smooth surface areas and black molds often form circular patterns.

Take the following: : \\\\begin{matrix} & \\\\underbrace{a_{}^{a^{{}^{.\\\\,^{.\\\\,^{.\\\\,^a}}}}}} & \\\\\\\\\\\\ & b\\\\mbox{ copies of }a \\\\end{matrix} Cutler's bar notation shifts these exponentials counterclockwise, forming {^b} \\\\bar a. A bar is placed above the variable to denote this change. As such: : \\\\begin{matrix} {^b} \\\\bar a = & \\\\underbrace{a_{}^{a^{{}^{.\\\\,^{.\\\\,^{.\\\\,^a}}}}}} & \\\\\\\\\\\\ & b\\\\mbox{ copies of }a \\\\end{matrix} This system becomes effective with multiple exponents, when regular denotation becomes too cumbersome. : \\\\begin{matrix} ^{^b{b}} \\\\bar a = & \\\\underbrace{a_{}^{a^{{}^{.\\\\,^{.\\\\,^{.\\\\,^a}}}}}} & \\\\\\\\\\\\ & {{^b} \\\\bar a}\\\\mbox{ copies of }a \\\\end{matrix} At any time, this can be further shortened by rotating the exponential counterclockwise once more. : \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\underbrace{b_{}^{b^{{}^{.\\\\,^{.\\\\,^{.\\\\,^b}}}}}} \\\\bar a = {_c} \\\\bar a \\\\\\\\\\\\ c \\\\mbox{ copies of } b \\\\end{matrix} The same pattern could be iterated a fourth time, becoming \\\\bar a_{d}. For this reason, it is sometimes referred to as Cutler's circular notation. Advantages and drawbacks The Cutler bar notation can be used to easily express other notation systems in exponent form. It also allows for a flexible summarization of multiple copies of the same exponents, where any number of stacked exponents can be shifted counterclockwise and shortened to a single variable. The bar notation also allows for fairly rapid composure of very large numbers. For instance, the number \\\\bar {10}_{10} would contain more than a googolplex digits, while remaining fairly simple to write with and remember. However, the system reaches a problem when dealing with different exponents in a single expression. For instance, the expression ^{a^{b^{b^{c}}}} could not be summarized in bar notation. Additionally, the exponent can only be shifted thrice before it returns to its original position, making a five degree shift indistinguishable from a one degree shift. Some have suggested using a double and triple bar in subsequent rotations, though this presents problems when dealing with ten- and twenty-degree shifts. Other equivalent notations for the same operations already exist without being limited to a fixed number of recursions, notably Knuth's up-arrow notation and hyperoperation notation.

Biography  Merrick was born in August 1808 in Jamaica. Mark Dike DeLancey, Rebecca Neh Mbuh, Mark W.

In 1842, Reverend John Clarke and Dr. G. K. Prince, members of the Baptist Missionary Society of London, were seeking Jamaican lay missionaries to join them on an expedition to the Cameroon coast. Merrick signed on.DeLancey and DeLancey 45; Fanso 101–2. The party reached England on 8 September 1842,Ngoh 49. and arrived at Spanish-controlled Santa Isabel on the island of Fernando Po in 1843. = Ministry = The following year, 1844, Merrick visited Bimbia and spoke to King William of the Isubu people to request permission to establish a church on the mainland. Despite some initial resistance, the king acquiesced. Merrick founded the Jubilee Mission in 1844/5, and over the next four to five years, translated parts of the New Testament into the Isubu language, set up a brick-making machine and a printing press, and used the latter to publish his Bible translation and a textbook for teaching in Isubu. Merrick made excursions into the interior, as when he climbed Mount Cameroon and when he became the first non-African to visit the Bakoko people.DeLancey and DeLancey 174. In 1849, Merrick was in ill health. He set off for England on furlough, and on 22 October, he died at sea. On Merrick's death, Joseph Jackson Fuller took charge of the mission station and congregation at Bimbia. Merrick's efforts also paved the way for Alfred Saker to make further progress - he made use of Merrick's printing press to translate and print the Bible in Duala.DeLancey and DeLancey 174; Ngoh 69. Joseph Merrick Baptist College in Ndu, Northwest Province, Cameroon, is named for him.

(1985). Filters Against Folly, How to Survive despite Economists, Ecologists, and the Merely Eloquent, Viking Penguin, The concept is Hardin's interpretation of the closely related phenomenon known as the tragedy of the commons,Hardin, G. (1968). The Tragedy of the Commons. Science 162, 1243–1248. and is referred to in political discourse as \\"privatizing profits and socializing losses.\\" The CC–PP Game originally appeared in Hardin's book titled Filters against Folly: How To Survive Despite Economists, Ecologists, and the Merely Eloquent which was published in 1986. Players of the CC–PP Game aim to commonize the costs (or externalities) generated by their activities across the wider community, while privatizing all profits (financial or otherwise) to themselves. The individual does not broadcast that they are playing the game in order to continue profiting. Hardin related the CC–PP Game to ecological problems such mining, groundwater overdraft, cattle ranching and other actions that cause the depletion of natural resources or an increase in pollution.  Tragedy of the Commons and the CC–PP Game  The CC–PP Game is used to explain how individuals utilize public goods, specifically scarce natural resources. These goods include resources such as clean air, rivers, forests and groundwater. These are public goods because they are both non- excludable and non-rival. It is very difficult to assign property rights to public goods, which results in many people using the resource and the resource's subsequent depletion or the tragedy of the commons. Hardin uses the original conception of the commons as a \\"village pasture used for grazing sheep or cattle in preindustrial England.\\" The pasture was a public space for any villager to use to graze their livestock. Villagers gained profit from each additional animal on the pasture, but did not have to pay the costs of the animals depleting the grass. The village as a whole took on the cost of overgrazing the pasture. This represented the CC–PP Game for Hardin in which the incentive to create individual profit was greater than the cost of overgrazing the field since it was spread out between many individuals. In a more modern example of the CC–PP Game, Hardin attributes the desertification of the Sahel desert to \\"unmanaged access and overuse.\\" John D. Aram summarized the tragedy of the commons and the CC–PP Game stating, \\"Tragic macro effects result from a structure of micro incentives that allows unmanaged access to a fixed resource.\\"  Game Theory and the CC–PP Game  Pay-off matrix for water extraction in CC-PP Game The CC–PP Game is an example of a non-cooperative equilibrium or Nash Equilibrium in which the parties in the game do not cooperate and are incentivized to deplete natural resources, resulting in an inefficient outcome. The CC–PP Game refers to the market for a scarce natural resource, for example groundwater. Groundwater is scarce because it can be extracted from the ground at a much higher rate than it can be replenished naturally. In addition, clean groundwater in many areas is limited. Groundwater is a natural resource that can be difficult to assign property rights to and is needed by all individuals. Private firms as well as everyday consumers will extract groundwater for their own use. Private firms gain profits from using the water to produce a good or directly selling the water. Individual consumers gain utility or satisfaction from drinking the water or using it in their homes. Both the private firm and the individual have an incentive to take water from the ground and receive a gain in utility from taking that water (privatized profits). The water supply is diminished, resulting in a tragedy of the commons and a loss of utility for everyone that uses the groundwater (communized costs). Since an individual user does not have to pay for the cost of water depletion, but is still gaining the utility or profit from using the water, the individual will continue to use the water. Every individual will come to this same conclusion and the natural resource will be depleted. This can be seen in a pay-off matrix. Where there are two individuals making separate choices to defect by privatizing benefits and commonizing costs, or to cooperate and refrain from personal gain in order to preserve a resource. If Individual A decides to preserve water while Individual B does not then Individual A will only receive $20 while Individual B gains $80. This is true vice versa if Individual B decides to preserve water and Individual A decides to extract. Both individuals have an incentive to defect and extract water to gain $50, so as rational consumers they will extract water. However, if neither party extracted water then they would actually gain $50 more in profit. This is a case of the Prisoner's Dilemma. However, unlike the Prisoner's Dilemma that only has two people, CC–PP Game is an aggregate of many individuals, making it harder to see the effects of a single person's decisions.  Real Life Examples  = Fisheries = Fisheries are a prime example of the CC–PP Game. Companies gain a profit for every fish that they catch and are incentivized to continue catching fish. However, their overfishing depletes the amount of fish in the ocean, hurting the environment and other individuals. All individuals pay for the cost of a decrease in the amount of fish. = Mining = Mining companies participate in the CC–PP Game by depleting their worker's health. Hardin argues that the owners of mining companies profit from their workers, while workers suffer the negative health effects of mining such as respiratory damage, chronic lead poisoning, mercury poisoning, black lung disease, and poisoning by radon gas in uranium mines. Hardin states, \\"Until the development of nationalized schemes of compensation in the twentieth century the costs of deteriorated health were \\"paid\\" by the miner himself, partly in medical bills but even more in reduced capacity to work and enjoy life.\\" = Intangible Assets = Hardin also included \\"intangible assets\\" such as “worker safety, stabilizing the cost of healthcare, and economic efficiency\\" as instances of tragedy of the commons. These assets can also deteriorate if individuals choose to privatize benefits and communize costs.  Policy Applications  Hardin proposed several solutions to the CC–PP Game in his books and essays. In Hardin's early works, he expressed his belief that they only way to protect natural resources was by limiting individual's freedoms. He stated that preserving the commons would only be possible by “mutual coercion, mutually agreed upon.” Today, this would be considered command and control regulation. Hardin believed that individuals needed regulation or systems in place to force them to stop depleting resources. He rejected the option of people volunteering to not ruin common goods because of individual's lack of will power and lack of incentives to limit themselves. He believed that voluntary self-restraint was not a solution to avoiding the tragedy of the commons. However, later in his career, Hardin argued that a strict individual responsibility could preserve the commons. He described systems of accountability for policy makers in order to preserve the commons for their constituents. This puts the responsibility for preserving the commons onto the political system. Ideally Hardin wanted all costs and benefits to be privatized. John D. Aram argues that Hardin would be in favor of a flat tax structure and elimination of public subsidies.

Work stopped after initial studies in 1993. It will be controlled by a motorway company as yet unannounced. It will be a toll road. It will replace the A47, known for being obsolete and accident-prone. It will be privately managed in order to profitably be capable of bearing the intense traffic that will be brought to it from the influx of motorists to the A45 who currently drive on the A47. The project is officially dropped in 2018. History Initially the A45 ran from Pierre-Bénite to Brignais with one lane in each direction, it was later expanded to include two lanes in either direction. This section is now the A450. The first feasibility studies for its construction began in 1993 (the preliminary studies between 1995 and 1996, were open for discussion in 1997. , partie F – 1.3. Présentation générale du programme, pp. 408-411. ), and studies for the preliminary design were conducted from 1999 to November 2005. The public inquiry for the A45 took place between November 24, 2006 and January 20, 2007. On July 17, 2008, after the grenelle de l'environnement, the Minister of Ecology and Regional Development, Jean-Louis Borloo declared the project as having public benefit. Since this declaration, no work has been started, and the project is currently at a halt. Project plan and goals  =As an alternative to the A47= The scheme involves the doubling of the A47 between Saint-Etienne and Lyon, more precisely between Pierre-Bénite and Fouillouse. The project was instigated as a result of a debate held in 1993 rejecting a project to enlarge the A47, as it was concluded it would be too difficult to widen the A47 where it crossed through two communes, Givors and Rive-de-Gier. Additionally, there was a need for an alternative motorway to the A47 in the event of serious accidents or heavy traffic. Despite its inadequacies, the A47 is effectively the only current route for motor vehicle traffic between Lyon and Saint-Étienne. Five junctions were set forth by the ministerial decision of February 12, 1999: at La Fouillouse (A72), Vallée d'Onzon (D 3 and north of Saint-Étienne), Saint- Chamond (A47), Rive-de-Gier (A47 and D 342 ex-D 42), and at Brignais (D 386 ex-N 86). The A45 project, with an estimated cost of €1.3 billion excluding taxes, will be managed by an undetermined motorway company. The project will involve the construction of four tunnels and eleven viaducts. In exchange, the company will receive the proceeds of the tolls, and by order of Jean-Louis Borloo, a subsidy from the local governments of between €520 and €700 million. Another goal is to open up the urban agglomeration around Saint-Étienne, in addition to serving as an alternative to the A47, which suffers from high traffic, and has a reputation for frequent accidents and having obsolete facilities. Improvements to the A47 will continue between Givors and Saint- Chamond after the A45 opens, much as was already done above Saint-Chamond, when Saint-Étienne was selected as a site for matches of the 1998 FIFA World Cup. =Current situation of the project site= The Lyon - Saint-Étienne route is one of the major routes of the Rhône-Alpes region., 2.2.

Clover is a former young adventurer from Cowes on the Isle of Wight in England, who, at the age of 15 years and 362 days, was the youngest person in the world to successfully sail across the Atlantic Ocean single-handedly (in late 2002 – early 2003). Another young Briton, Michael Perham, surpassed his record in 2007. Clover also allegedly crossed the English Channel single-handedly at the age of 11, which led his mother to dare him to cross the Atlantic Ocean next. Education Clover was educated at Ryde School with Upper Chine, a co- educational independent school in the seaside town of Ryde, on the Isle of Wight,BBC News at 6 and all ITN news programmes on the first day of Clover's return to school, after his successful single-handed voyage. Both broadcasters featured interviews with Clover and his classmates inside the school, and named the school in their reports. followed by the University of Plymouth (subsequently renamed Plymouth University for marketing purposes), in 2005. The record From 19 December 2002 to 12:50 GMT on 12 January 2003, Seb raced his father across the Atlantic Ocean for between Santa Cruz de Tenerife on the Canary Islands and Nelson's Dockyard on Antigua. Both father and son sailed identical Contessa 32 yachts. Seb made the crossing in a yacht called Reflection, his father in one called Xixia. The voyage did not pass without problems. Both racers had close encounters with killer whales and rigging problems meant Seb was unable to catch up with his father. He had to repair a shroud fixture that broke in heavy weather. His priority became to keep the mast standing and finish without pushing the boat too much. Seb eventually lost the race and arrived in Antigua a day behind his father when he was 15 years and 362 days old. He lost his title in January 2007, when Michael Perham made the crossing at the age of 14. Awards In the aftermath of his achievement, Clover received several awards. He was named Best Prodigy of the Year by the Duchess of York in the second edition of Britain's Brilliant Prodigies Awards. He also received the Young Sportsman Award in the BBC South Sports Awards 2003 and the Raymarine Young Sailor of the Year Award 2003 which was announced at the Schroders London Boat Show.

The song was left incomplete at the time of hide's death on May 2, 1998, being finished by his Spread Beaver band mates and included on the album Ja, Zoo. On May 2, 2007, the single was re-released with a new cover. On December 8, 2010, it was re-released again as part of the third releases in \\"The Devolution Project\\", which was a release of hide's original eleven singles on picture disc vinyl. Background At the Visual Japan Summit on October 15, 2016, Teru of Glay said that he was told their 1997 single \\"However\\" inspired hide to write \\"Hurry Go Round\\". \\"Hurry Go Round\\" was one of the songs from Ja, Zoo that was unfinished at the time of hide's death. Eric Westfall, one of the album's recording and mixing engineers, revealed that a week or so after hide's death, he and I.N.A had an emotionally difficult time finishing the album as televisions they had on in the studio were still showing footage of and talking about the dead musician. He said that \\"Hurry Go Round\\" gave them particular difficulty due to its \\"heavy\\" or somber lyrical theme about \\"the circle of life,\\" with them both crying while working on it individually. He commented that I.N.A only had one or two temporary vocal recordings from hide with which to finish the song. Westfall claimed that the liner notes crediting Rich Breen for mixing the track are incorrect and that the mix actually used was done by himself. Despite him being told that it would be, it was never corrected in later pressings. Reception and legacy Lyrics to \\"Hurry Go Round\\" are engraved on hide's tombstone. Seen here on the right, partially obscured by flowers just above a carving of one of his guitars. \\"Hurry Go Round\\" reached number 2 on the Oricon chart. By the end of the year it sold 567,890 copies and was the 41st best-selling single of the year, being certified Platinum by the RIAJ. Some of the lyrics to the song are engraved on hide's tombstone. \\"Hurry Go Round\\" was chosen as the title for a May 26, 2018 documentary film about hide. Its ending theme is a new version of the song titled \\"Hurry Go Round (hide Vocal Take 2)\\". This version of the song features only hide's vocals and Pata's acoustic guitar, and is included on the June 6, 2018 tribute album Tribute Impulse. The 251st chapter of the manga series Rurouni Kenshin, published in September 1999, is titled \\"Hurry Go Round\\" after the song. Author Nobuhiro Watsuki was listening to the song a lot while drawing the final arc of the series and felt it fit well with the characters Yukishiro Enishi and Hitokiri Battōsai, and referred to it as the Jinchū arc's theme song.

The GDOI protocol is specified in an IETF Standard, RFC 6407, and is based on Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP), RFC 2408, and Internet Key Exchange version 1 (IKE). Whereas IKE is run between two peers to establish a \\"pair-wise security association\\", GDOI protocol is run between a group member and a \\"group controller/key server\\" (controller) and establishes a security association among two or more group members. GDOI Functional Block Diagram Functional Overview GDOI \\"interprets\\" IKE or ISAKMP for the group security domain in addition to pair- wise security associations. GDOI uses an IKE v1 Phase 1 security association for authenticating a GDOI member to a GDOI controller. The IKE/GDOI Phase 1 cryptographic protocol exchange protects a new type of Phase 2 exchange in which the member requests (\\"pulls\\") group state from the controller. The \\"group key\\" is the most important state in a GDOI member. The group key encrypts keys that decrypt application data. Thus, the group key is also called a \\"key encrypting key\\" in GDOI. A group's key-encrypting key is used for the \\"Rekey Security Association\\". Once the \\"Rekey-SA\\" is established, the GDOI controller can send (\\"push\\") unsolicited updates to the group security association to members over multicast, broadcast or unicast channels. This is why GDOI is called a \\"multicast key management system\\" as it uses and supports multicast messaging for very large groups. These multicast messages are unsolicited messages and are therefore called \\"push\\" messages, which are unsolicited messages sent from the controller to the members; explicit requests from a member to a controller are called \\"pull\\" messages in GDOI. Thus GDOI group key updates are pushed and can reach any number of group members with a single efficient transmission from the controller. GDOI group key updates also serve to remove members from groups. RFC 2627 describes one Group Membership Management protocol that allows selective key updates to members to efficiently remove a member from the group. \\"Efficiency\\" is evaluated in terms of space, time and message complexity. RFC 2627 and other algorithms such as \\"subset-difference\\" are logarithmic in space, time and message complexity. Thus, RFC 2627 supports efficient group \\"membership management\\" for GDOI. In a practical implementation, GDOI group membership management is a separate function that the controller or a AAA function invokes to remove a de-authorized group member. \\"AAA\\" is authorization, authentication and accounting, which might run some kind of AAA protocol. But the AAA function could also be a \\"customer care\\" function for a service provider or a \\"subscriber management system\\" for a media services provider. The provider or AAA function must have a credential infrastructure such as a Public Key Infrastructure using X.509 digital certificates, SPKI or some other credential. In an X.509 environment, the provider or AAA function will install a certificate to allow a member to join a group when the Group Controller queries the PKI during a GDOI Registration exchange when a member attempts to join a group and \\"pull down\\" the group state. Member Key Ladder =Key Ladder= The group state that is stored in the group member are keys and key metadata. Conceptually, the group member's keys are structured in a set of 1:N relationships and often called a \\"key ladder\\". The member has a credential such as an X.509 certificate that proves it is authorized to join one or more groups. The default group policy for the \\"Private Authentication Key\\" is a 2048-bit RSA key, but other policies are possible. Similarly, the default \\"group key\\" or \\"Key Encrypting Key\\" is a 128-bit AES key, but other policies are possible. Finally, the data encryption key is application-dependent but is commonly a 128-bit AES key. In some groups, a member can be a sender that generates a data encryption key and encrypts it with the key encrypting key. So long as the two share the group key for the same group, the sender can use that \\"key encrypting key\\" to encrypt the key(s) for the media files or streams that it serves. Not all GDOI groups make a distinction between sender and receiver, however, and whether or not group members may send to each other is a matter of group policy. The type of keys in the key ladder are also determined by group policy. Each group can have its own policy for cryptography, key lifetime, and member behavior. =Group Policy= Implementations and Products *In Cisco *In Juniper External links * RFC 6407 Category:Cryptographic protocols Category:IPsec ","title":"Group Domain of Interpretation"},{"id":"8884904","text":"Islam and modernity is a topic of discussion in contemporary sociology of religion. The history of Islam chronicles different interpretations and approaches. Modernity is a complex and multidimensional phenomenon rather than a unified and coherent one. It has historically had different schools of thought moving in many directions.The Responsibilities of the Muslim Intellectual in the 21st Century, Abdolkarim Soroush  Industrial Revolution's impact on Islam  In the 18th century Europe was undergoing major transformations as the new ideas of the Enlightenment, which stressed the importance of science, rationality, and human reason, and the new technologies of the Industrial Revolution swept across Europe, giving Europeans great power and influence. In the last quarter of the 18th century, the gap widened between the technical skills of some western and northern European countries and those of the rest of the world. The rise of modern Europe coincided with what many scholars refer to as the decline of the Ottoman Empire, which by the 18th century was facing political, military, and economic breakdown. While prior to the 18th century the Ottomans had regarded themselves to be either of superior or, by the mid-18th century, of equal strength to Europe, by the end of the 18th century the power relationship between the Ottoman Empire and Europe began to shift in Europe's favor. =French occupation of the Ottoman Empire= In 1798 Napoleon Bonaparte's army occupied the Ottoman province of Egypt and killed roughly 3000 Egyptians. Although the occupation was only three years, followed by lingering hostility to the French, the experience ultimately exposed the Egyptian people to Enlightenment ideas and Europe's new technology. =Ottoman scholars in Europe= The exposure to European power and ideas would later inspire the new governor of Egypt, Muhammad Ali, to draw on this technology to modernize Egypt, setting an example for the rest of the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman government began to open embassies and send officials to study in Europe. This created conditions for the \\"gradual formation of a group of reformers with a certain knowledge of the modern world and a conviction that the empire must belong to it or perish\\".Albert, Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age, 1983: p.43 One of the scholars sent by Muhammad Ali to Europe in 1826 was Rifa'a Rafi' al-Tahtawi. The five years he spent in Paris left a permanent mark on him. After his return to Egypt he wrote about his impressions of France and translated numerous European works into Arabic. Tahtawi was impressed with Europe's technological and scientific advancement and political philosophy. Having studied Islamic Law, he argued that \\"it was necessary to adapt the Sharia to new circumstances\\" and that there was not much difference between \\"the principles of Islamic law and those principles of 'natural law' on which the codes of modern Europe were based\\".Albert, Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age, 1983: p.75 Like Tahtawi, Khayr al-Din was also sent to Paris where he spent four years. After his return from Europe he wrote a book in which he argued that the only way to strengthen the Muslim States was by borrowing ideas and institutions from Europe, and that this did not contradict the spirit of the Sharia.Albert, Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age, 1983: pp.88 = Modernization reforms in the Ottoman Empire = In the period between 1839 and 1876 the Ottoman government began instituting large-scale reforms as a way to modernize and strengthen the empire. Known as the Tanzimat, many of these reforms involved adopting successful European practices that were considered antithetical to conservative Muslims. In addition to military and administrative reforms, Ottoman rulers implemented reforms in the sphere of education, law, and the economy. This included new universities and changes in curricula, as well new economic systems and institutions. There were also European-inspired changes to law that restricted Islamic law to family affairs such as marriage and inheritance. The Ottoman Empire was the first Muslim country where modernity surfaced, with major shifts in scientific and legal thought.Watson, The Modern Mind, 2001: p.970 In 1834, Ishak Efendi published Mecmua-i Ulum-i Riyaziye, a four volume text introducing many modern scientific concepts to the Muslim world. Kudsi Efendi also published Asrar al-Malakut in 1846 in an attempt to reconcile Copernican astronomy with Islam. The first modern Turkish chemistry text was published in 1848, and the first modern Biology text in 1865.Watson, The Modern Mind, 2001: p.971 Eventually, the Turks adopted the metric system in 1869. These shifts in scientific thought coincided with Tanzimat, a reform policy undertaken by the Sultans of the Ottoman Empire that was inspired by French civil law. This reform confined sharia to family law. The key figure in the Turkish modernist movement was Namik Kemal, the editor of a journal called Freedom. His goal was to promote freedom of the press, the separation of powers, equality before the law, scientific freedom, and a reconciliation between parliamentary democracy and the Qur'an. =The Greater Muslim world= The influence of modernism in the Muslim world resulted in a cultural revival. Dramatic plays became more common, as did newspapers. Notable European works were analyzed and translated. Legal reform was attempted in Egypt, Tunisia, the Ottoman Empire, and Iran, and in some cases these reforms were adopted.Watson, The Modern Mind, 2001: p.974 Efforts were made to restrict the power of government. Polygamy was ended in India.Watson, The Modern Mind, 2001: p.975 Azerbaijan granted suffrage to women in 1918 (before several European countries). At the recommendations of reform-minded Islamic scholars, western sciences were taught in new schools. Much of this had to do with the intellectual appeal of social Darwinism, since it led to the conclusion that an old-fashioned Muslim society could not compete in the modern world. In 19th century Iran, Mirza Malkom Khan arrived after being educated in Paris. He created a newspaper called Qanun, where he advocated the separation of powers, secular law, and a bill of rights. Jamal al-Din al-Afghani, who was politically active in the Islamic world and published the pamphlet \\"Al-'Urwa al-Wuthqà\\" during a brief spell in France, proclaiming that Europe had become successful due to its laws and its science. He became critical of other Muslim scholars for stifling scientific thought,Watson, The Modern Mind, 2001: p.972 and hoped to encourage scientific inquiry in the Muslim world.  Modernism, religion and ideology =Islamic Modernism= Modernism impacted interpretations of Islam. One movement was Islamic Modernism, which was both an attempt to provide an Islamic response to the challenges presented by European colonial expansion, and an effort to reinvigorate and reform Islam from within as a way to counter the perceived weakness and decline of Muslim societies in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It called for \\"a 'reformation' or reinterpretation (ijtihad) of Islam\\", and emerged in the Muslim world from Egypt to Southeast Asia. Islamic modernists argued that Islam and modernity were compatible and \\"asserted the need to reinterpret and reapply the principles and ideals of Islam to formulate new responses to the political, scientific, and cultural challenges of the West and of modern life\\". The reforms they proposed challenged the status quo maintained by the conservative Muslims scholars (ulama), who saw the established law as the ideal order that had to be followed and upheld the doctrine of taqlid (imitation / blind following). Islamic modernists saw the resistance to change on the part of the conservative ulama as a major cause for the problems the Muslim community was facing as well as its inability to counter western hegemony. Modernists Jamal al-Din al-Afghani (1838–1897) is regarded as one of the pioneers of Islamic modernism. He believed that Islam was compatible with science and reason and that in order to counter European power the Muslim world had to embrace progress.Albert, Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age, 1983: pp.103–129 Muhammad Abduh (1849–1905) was a disciple and collaborator of al- Afghani. He was even more influential than his master and is often referred to as the founder of Islamic modernism. Abduh was born and raised in Egypt and was a scholar of Islam (alim). He taught at al-Azhar and other institutions and in 1899 became Mufti of Egypt. Abduh believed that the Islamic world was suffering from an inner decay and was in need of a revival.Albert, Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age, 1983: p.136 Asserting that \\"Islam could be the moral basis of a modern and progressive society\\",Albert, Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age, 1983: p.140 he was critical of both secularists and the conservative ulama. He called for a legal reform and the reinterpretation (ijtihad) of Islamic law according to modern conditions. While critical of the West, he believed that it was necessary to borrow or assimilate what was good from it.Albert, Arabic Thought in the Liberal Age, 1983: p.156 Abduh became a leading judge in Egypt after political activities in Paris as al-Afghani's assistant. He pushed for secular law, religious reform, and education for girls. He hoped that Egypt would ultimately become a free republic, much like how France had transformed from an absolute monarchy.Watson, The Modern Mind, 2001: p.973 Muhammad Rashid Rida (1869–1935) also became active in the Egyptian modernization movement as Abduh's disciple, although he was born and educated in Syria. Al-Manar was his journal, through which he initially advocated greater openness to science and foreign influence. He also stated that sharia was relatively silent about agriculture, industry, and trade, and that these areas of knowledge needed renewal. He would eventually evolve to conservative positions close to Wahhabism. Qasim Amin was another reformer in Egypt and Abduh's disciple who was heavily concerned with the rights of women. Khayr al-Din al-Tunisi was similarly educated in Paris around the same time. He surveyed the political systems of 21 European countries in an effort to reform Tunisia. Notable Modernists on the Indian subcontinent include Sayyid Ahmad Khan (1817–1898) and Muhammad Iqbal (1877–1938) in the Indian subcontinent (the latter was also the conceiver of the modern state of Pakistan). Like al-Afghani and Abduh, they rejected the doctrine of taqlid and asserted the need for Islam to be reinterpreted according to modern conditions. Other Modernists include Mahmud Tarzi of Afghanistan, Chiragh Ali of India, Ahmad Dahlan of Java, and Wang Jingzhai of China. Although Islamic modernists were subject to the criticism that the reforms they promoted amounted to westernizing Islam, their legacy was significant and their thought influenced future generations of reformers.  Pakistan and Turkey  Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founder of Pakistan, was also a prominent Muslim modernist of the twentieth century. In some parts of the world, the project of Islamic modernity continued from the same trajectory before World War I. This was especially the case in the new Republic of Turkey, under Mustafa Kemal Atatürk. But in Egypt, Hassan al-Banna founded the Muslim Brotherhood, the first Islamist organization, which had no interest in reinterpreting Islam to make it compatible with modernity. Turkey has continued to be at the forefront of modernising Islam. In 2008 its Department of Religious Affairs launched a review of all the hadiths, the sayings of Mohammed upon which most of Islamic law is based. The School of Theology at Ankara University undertook this forensic examination with the intent of removing centuries of often conservative cultural baggage and rediscovering the spirit of reason in the original message of Islam. Fadi Hakura from London's Chatham House likens these revisions to the Reformation that took place in Protestant Christianity in the 16th Century.\\"Turkey in radical revision of Islamic texts\\" Robert Pigott, Religious affairs correspondent, BBC News, 26 February 2008 Turkey has also trained hundreds of women as theologians, and sent them senior imams known as vaizes all over the country, away from the relatively liberal capital and coastal cities, to explain these re-interpretations at town hall meetings. = After World War I = The aftermath of World War I resulted in the fall of the Ottoman Empire and the domination of the Middle East by European powers such as Britain and France. Intellectual historians such as Peter Watson suggest that World War I marks the end of the main Islamic modernist movements, and that this is the point where many Muslims \\"lost faith with the culture of science and materialism\\",Watson, The Modern Mind, 2001: p.1096 but that several parallel intellectual streams emerged thereafter. = Arab socialism = Arab socialism of the Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party and Nasserite movement emerged as a stream of thought during decolonialization of Arab countries. It emphasized ethnicity, culture, politics and played down the role of religion. Its popularity peaked in the 50s and 60s. As a political ideology based on an amalgamation of Pan-Arabism and socialism, Arab socialism is distinct from the much broader tradition of socialist thought in the Arab world which predates Arab socialism by as much as 50 years. Michel Aflaq, the principal founder of ba'athism and the Ba'ath Party, coined the term in order to distinguish his version of socialist ideology from the Marxist socialism in Eastern Europe and Eastern Asia, and social democracy and democratic socialism in Western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. The Six-Day War between Israel and its neighbours ended in a decisive loss for the Muslim side. Many in the Islamic world saw this as the failure of socialism. It was at this point that \\"fundamental and militant Islam began to fill the political vacuum created\\". = Islamic fundamentalism = In the late 20th century an Islamic Revival or Islamic Awakening developed in the Muslim World. (Islamic fundamentalism is the common term in the West used to refer to contemporary Islamic revivalism, according to John Esposito.) It was manifested in greater religious piety and in a growing adoption of Islamic culture.Lapidus, p.823 One striking example of it is the increase in attendance at the Hajj, the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, which grew from 90,000 in 1926 to 2 million in 1979.Kepel, Gilles, Jihad: on the Trail of Political Islam, Harvard University Press, 2002, p.75 But the said increase in the number of pilgrims may also be attributed to other factors such as increase in populations, modern transportation facilities and to some extent the over all financial prosperity of the Muslims all over the world thus making the Pilgrimage affordable to more and more Muslim populations. Two of the most important events that fueled or inspired the resurgence were the Arab oil embargo and subsequent quadrupling of the price of oil in the mid-1970s, and the 1979 Iranian Revolution that established an Islamic republic in Iran under Ayatollah Khomeini. The first created a flow of many billions of dollars from Saudi Arabia to fund Islamic books, scholarships, fellowships, and mosques around the world; the second undermined the assumption that Westernization strengthened Muslim countries and was the irreversible trend of the future. The revival is a reversal of the Westernisation approach common in Arab and Asian governments earlier in the 20th century. It is often associated with the political Islamic movement, Islamism, and other forms of re-Islamisation. While the revival has also been accompanied by some religious extremism and attacks on civilians and military targets by the extremists, this represents only a small part of the revival. The revival has also seen a proliferation of Islamic extremist groups in the Middle East and elsewhere in the Muslim World, who have voiced their anger at perceived exploitation as well as materialism, Westernization, democracy and modernity, which are most commonly associated with accepting Western secular beliefs and values. The spread of secularism has caused great concerns among many Islamic political groups. It has been the reasoning for the Islamization of politics and protest, due to the large Muslim majority in the Middle East as well as the region's imperial past.Fawcett, L (2005) International Relations of the Middle East, UK: Oxford University Press, p 72 For Islamic countries in the Middle East, there is not necessarily a problem as such with modernity, however, \\"the problem is when modernity comes wrapped with westernization, with absolutely and utterly rampant materialism\\".BBC News online, Islam and the West, Monday, 12 August 2002, 14:11 GMT 15:11 UK In the book Political Islam: Religion and Politics in the Arab World (1994), the author N. Ayubi explained what he believes to be the two main concerns of Islamic political movements and extremist groups in the Middle East: # The Western belief in a bureaucratic state; and # The secular values and beliefs associated with concepts such as modernity.Ayubi, N. N. M.

California – in all its dimensions—is the object of its focus. Cal Cultures (as it is also known) grew out of a concerted effort to explore new epistemological, conceptual, and methodological challenges created by the diverse demographics of a new and changing California. Central to this effort are the stratified economic conditions, resulting power relations and social formations that have reconfigured California at the nexus of local struggle and global process at the turn of this century. California is the prism through which the program explores these challenges specifically in the ways they intersect with immigration, the environment, health, education, language, cultural production, citizenship, democracy and diversity. Cal Cultures remaps California within the complexity of global cartography and accentuates the state's multiple geopolitical borders and transnational frontiers, including Mexico and the Americas, Asia and the Pacific, and regions represented by emerging diasporic relations such as Africa and the Middle East. The program's ultimate goal is to foster new dialogue, frameworks and collaborations in research and practice at both the University of California and with the broader regional, international and global communities of which all Californians are a part. Cal Cultures emphasizes the need for new and inclusive knowledge and practical engagement. Local communities are not only instrumental in this design but are at the heart of this understanding.  Minor  Cal Cultures offers an undergraduate minor. It is similar to other social justice oriented minors at UC San Diego in that its basic requirements lower and upper division courses from departments in the Social Sciences and the Arts & Humanities that relate to the program's mission. What sets this minor apart from others though is that minor requirements may also be fulfilled with coursework in conjunction with internships at local and community-based organizations.  Fellowships  Every year, Cal Cultures gives out fellowships to graduate students whose research focuses on questions relevant to California as a major nexus in global and diasporic processes, and that attends to hierarchical, comparative and relational processes inherent in this contemporary condition. This includes research on social movements, the military, boundaries, diverse community history and rapidly changing populations, as well as projects that focus on the literal and metaphorical borders between the Americas, Asia and the Pacific, as well as those that highlight community-based collaborative research methodologies.  Events  Some of the events that Cal Cultures has sponsored or co-sponsored in the past include: -“Understanding the U.S. Addiction to Prisons: From California to Abu Ghraib” (a lecture by Ruth Wilson Gilmore, Professor of Geography and American Studies and Ethnicity, University of Southern California) -\\"The Latino Challenge to Black America: Towards a Conversation Between African-Americans and Hispanics\\" (a book presentation by Earl Ofari Hutchinson, a well known syndicated columnist) -\\"Building the Left in the Age of the Right: Challenging Racism and Empire\\" (a lecture by Eric Mann, Director of the Labor/Community Strategy Center in Los Angeles) -\\"Vigilante Man: A History of White Violence in California\\" (a lecture by Mike Davis, (Urban theorist, former MacArthur Fellow and Professor of Creative Writing at UC Riverside) -“The Latino Threat: Constructing Immigrants, Citizens, and the Nation” (a book presentation by Leo Chávez, Professor of Anthropology at UC Irvine) -\\"Multilingual San Diego: Portraits of Language Loss and Revitalization\\" (a book presentation by Ana Celia Zentella, Professor of Ethnic Studies at UC San Diego)  Conferences  In the past, Cal Cultures has also co-sponsored various conferences, including: -Crossing Borders Ethnic Studies Graduate Student Conference (UC San Diego, 2007) -The 12th meeting of the Politics of Race, Immigration, and Ethnicity Consortium (UC San Diego, 2008) -Migrations Across Disciplines Symposium (UC San Diego, 2009) -Transborder California Digital Mapping Project Workshop (UC San Diego, 2009) -7th Cultural Studies Seminar, Globalization and Culture: Transnationalism, Cultural Citizenship, and Territoriality (Autonomous University of Baja California, Mexicali, Mexico) -TransCalifornia Conference (UC San Diego, 2010)  Directors  California Cultures in Comparative Perspective is currently headed by Prof. Robert Alvarez (Director), and Prof. Elana Zilberg\\"Elana Zilberg\\", communication.ucsd.edu. (Associate Director).  Faculty  California Cultures in Comparative Perspective also shares a small number of faculty members with other departments at UC San Diego: Marisa Abrajano (Political Science) Emily Colborn-Roxworthy (Theater and Dance) Mark Jacobsenhttp://www.econ.ucsd.edu/~m3jacobs/ (Economics) Eun-Young Jung (Music Department) Roger Levyhttp://idiom.ucsd.edu/~rlevy/ (Linguistics) David E. Pedersen (Anthropology) Daniel Widener (History)  Criticism  Although one of the program's original goals was to increase the number of historically underrepresented faculty (HURM) at UC San Diego, to date the majority of faculty hired through the program is not HURM faculty. The budget crisis of 2009 that will change the nature of the entire University of California system will alter the nature of programs such as California Cultures.

History They were originally formed in 1880 as Wigtown F.C., but changed their name to Wigtown & Bladnoch F.C. in 1919. Bladnoch is a small village barely a mile from Wigtown, but was the base for two of the largest employers in the area. Bladnoch Distillery was founded in 1817 by the McLelland brothers as the southernmost distillery in Scotland, and Bladnoch Creamery, founded in 1899 by the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society.History of Bladnoch – Galloway Today They play their home matches at Trammondford Park, which has room for 1,500 spectators. The club motto is \\"moving forward – to achieve our goals\\". They have competed in the South of Scotland Football League since the league reformed in 1946, although they resigned for seasons 1962–63 and 1972–73 due to financial problems.Scottish Football Historical Archive They have won the league on four occasions, the latest being 2013–14 when they prevailed in the first championship after Threave Rovers and Dalbeattie Star left the South of Scotland League to join the newly formed Scottish Sun Lowland League and only failed to win two of their 20 league games that season. Wigtown & Bladnoch have also appeared in the Scottish Cup on 14 occasions but their only moment of glory was in January 1952 when they defeated Scottish Football League club Montrose 2–1 at Links Park, Montrose.

Short Rice Noodles / Lao Shu Fen 老鼠粉 - MaMaChineseCooking.com or លត lot in Khmer . Accessed January 12, 2007. It is short, about 5 cm long and 5 mm in diameter. It has a white semi-transparent colour. The noodle is available in many Chinese markets in Chinese populated areas such as Hong Kong, Taiwan, Indonesia, Malaysia , Thailand and Singapore. Names Quite a number of names have been used to describe the noodle. The noodle is more commonly known as silver needle noodle in Hong Kong and Taiwan, and rat noodle in Malaysia and Singapore. It is known as locupan in Indonesia. The noodles are named as such because the shape of the noodles is long and tapered much like a rat's tail, translucent white like needles, or from the way the noodles are made by pushing them through the holes of a sieve. Production The noodles are made from a mixture of ground rice flour from glutinous or non-glutinous rice and water, but sometimes combined with cornstarch to reduce breakage during cooking. The noodles are made by pushing the rice and water mixture through a sieve directly into boiling water in the same manner as Spätzle. The noodles are made beforehand and then further prepared before serving. The noodles are only available fresh and they are made by noodle vendors or commercially produced and seldom homemade as it is too tedious to make a small amount for home consumption. Preparation Fried Lao Shu Fen / Fried Yin Zhen Fen / Fried Short Rice Noodles The noodles may be stir-fried, scalded and flavored with a mixture of sauces, cooked in soup or cooked dry in a clay-pot. As with most Chinese noodles, it can be served for breakfast, lunch or dinner as a main course or supplementing a rice meal. Many Chinese restaurants, hawkers and roadside stalls serve the noodle in various forms. One of the famous dishes that can be found widely in Southeast Asia is Clay-Pot Lao Shu Fen. The purpose of using clay-pot is to keep warmth of the dish.

Axwell House, derelict in 2003 Prior to his succession he lived at Greencroft Hall, Greencroft, Durham, a spacious mansion built by his grandfather James Clavering (1647–1721) in the late 17th century. In 1758, he replaced his father's old house Axwell House, near Blaydon on Tyne, with a new mansion house in Palladian style. He had substantial mining interests including collieries at Beckley and Andrews House which between 1726 and 1747 were leased out to the Grand Allies partnership.

He also wrote on the history of anarchism and socialism. Life and career Joll was born on 21 June 1918 in Bristol and was educated at Winchester, the University of Bordeaux and New College, Oxford. He left to join the British Army in 1940, eventually serving in the Special Operations Executive. He returned to Oxford after World War II, completed his studies, and became an instructor there. He was a Fellow and Tutor in Politics from 1947 until 1950. He then transferred to St Antony's College. In 1955 he met the painter and art historian John Golding; the two men formed a long relationship which lasted until Joll's death. While at Oxford, Joll wrote a book on the Second International (1955) and a book on Léon Blum, Walter Rathenau, and Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, called Intellectuals in Politics (1960). In 1964 he published The Anarchists, which showed his intertwined interests in the culture, events, political philosophy, and individual personalities forming the history of a Leftist movement. In 1967 Joll left St Antony's, Oxford to teach at the London School of Economics, as the Stevenson Professor of International History. His best known work was Europe Since 1870: an International History, which appeared in 1973. He returned to biography in 1977, with his book on Italian Marxist intellectual Antonio Gramsci; he was elected a Fellow of the British Academy in the same year. Several prizes in the Department of International History at the London School of Economics remain named in his honour. Later, he gave refuge to Anthony Blunt, Golding's colleague at the Courtauld Institute and former teacher, after Blunt's exposure as a former Soviet spy, for which Joll was attacked in the press. Following his retirement in 1981, he became Emeritus Professor of the University of London. Joll died 12 July 1994 from the cancer of the larynx. In his obituary notice for The Independent newspaper, the historian Sir Michael Howard, noted: > Joll's real focus was the history of ideas broadly conceived - > philosophical, ethical and aesthetic, as well as political - and the > interface between this and the political history of Europe in the 19th and > 20th centuries. He firmly believed that history was made by people rather > than by dispassionate forces. But he also believed that one could not > understand why people act as they do unless one also understands the > influences that moulded their minds.

She spent much of her early career as a flagship for the Flying Squadron and in the Mediterranean, Home and Channel Fleets. Revenge was assigned to the International Squadron blockading Crete during the 1897–1898 revolt there against the Ottoman Empire. She was placed in reserve upon her return home in 1900, and was then briefly assigned as a coast guard ship before she joined the Home Fleet in 1902. The ship became a gunnery training ship in 1906 until she was paid off in 1913. Revenge was recommissioned the following year, after the start of World War I, to bombard the coast of Flanders as part of the Dover Patrol, during which she was hit four times, but was not seriously damaged. She had anti-torpedo bulges fitted in early 1915, the first ship to be fitted with them operationally.Burt, pp. 87, 90 The ship was renamed Redoubtable later that year and was refitted as an accommodation ship by the end of the year. The last surviving member of her class, the ship was sold for scrap in November 1919. Design and description The design of the Royal Sovereign-class ships was derived from that of the battleships, greatly enlarged to improve seakeeping and to provide space for a secondary armament as in the preceding battleships.Gardiner, p. 116; Parkes, pp. 359 The ships displaced at normal load and at deep load. They had a length between perpendiculars of and an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of .Chesneau & Kolesnik, p. 32 As a flagship, Revenges crew consisted of 695 officers and ratings in 1903.Burt, p. 73 The Royal Sovereigns were powered by a pair of three- cylinder, vertical triple-expansion steam engines, each driving one shaft. Their Humphrys & Tennant engines were designed to produce a total of and a maximum speed of using steam provided by eight cylindrical boilers with forced draught. The ships carried a maximum of of coal which gave them a range of at a speed of . Their main armament consisted of four breech-loading (BL) guns mounted in two twin-gun barbettes, one each fore and aft of the superstructure.Parkes, p. 355 Each gun was provided with 80 rounds. Their secondary armament consisted of ten quick-firing (QF) guns. 200 rounds per gun were carried by the ships. Sixteen QF 6-pounder () guns of an unknown type and a dozen QF 3-pounder () Hotchkiss guns were fitted for defence against torpedo boats. The two 3-pounders in the upper fighting top were removed in 1903–1904, and all of the remaining light guns from the lower fighting tops and main deck followed in 1905–1909. The Royal Sovereign-class ships mounted seven 14-inch (356 mm) torpedo tubes, although Revenge had four of hers removed in 1902.Burt, pp. 73, 85, 87, 94 The Royal Sovereigns' armour scheme was similar to that of the Trafalgars, as the waterline belt of compound armour only protected the area between the barbettes. The belt and transverse bulkheads thick closed off the ends of the belt. Above the belt was a strake of nickel- steel armour closed off by transverse bulkheads. The barbettes were protected by compound armour, ranging in thickness from and the casemates for the 6-inch guns had a thickness equal to their diameter. The thicknesses of the armour deck ranged from . The walls of the forward conning tower were thick and the aft conning tower was protected by 3-inch plates. Construction Aerial view of Revenge taken by Samuel Cody during naval trials of observation kites in 1908. Revenge was the ninth ship of her name to serve in the Royal NavyColledge, p. 293 and was ordered under the Naval Defence Act Programme of 1889. The ship was laid down by Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company at their shipyard in Jarrow in Tyne and Wear, England, on 12 February 1891. She was floated out of the drydock on 3 November 1892,Burt, pp. 73, 94 and completed on 22 March 1894Silverstone, p. 263 at a cost of £954,825. Operational history =1892-1896= Upon completion, Revenge was placed in reserve at Portsmouth. Almost two years later, she mobilised there on 14 January 1896 as flagship of the Particular Service Squadron, soon renamed the Flying Squadron, which was formed in response to rising tensions in Europe following the Jameson Raid and Germany's Kaiser Wilhelm II's telegram of support to the Boer government. The squadron was briefly attached to the Mediterranean Fleet in the middle of the year.Burt, 94; Stilwell, pp. 147–49 When it was disbanded on 5 November, Revenge relieved the battleship as the flagship of the second-in- command of the Mediterranean Fleet.Burt, p. 94 Illustration of units of the International Squadron arriving at Suda Bay, Crete, on 21 December 1898. The French protected cruiser Bugeaud, carrying Prince George of Greece and Denmark, who will take up duty as High Commissioner of the Cretan State, leads the column. She is followed (right to left) by the Russian armored cruiser Gerzog Edinburgski, HMS Revenge, and the Italian battleship Francesco Morosini. =International Squadron= From February 1897 to December 1898, Revenge served in the International Squadron, a multinational force made up of ships of the Austro-Hungarian Navy, French Navy, Imperial German Navy, Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina), Imperial Russian Navy, and Royal Navy that intervened in the 1897-1898 Greek uprising on Crete against rule by the Ottoman Empire. She served as flagship of the British component of the squadron, initially under Rear-Admiral Robert Harris, and later under Rear- Admiral Gerard Noel, and played a very active role in the International Squadron's operations. Leading a Royal Navy force that reinforced the battleship , the British ship on station at Crete when unrest broke out in early February 1897, Revenge and the battleship arrived at Canea (now Chania) on 9 February 1897.McTiernan, Mick, \\"Spyros Kayales – A different sort of flagpole,\\" mickmctiernan.com, 20 November 2012.The British in Crete, 1896 to 1913: British warships off Canea, March 1897McTiernan, p. 14.Clowes, p. 444. She contributed personnel to an international landing force of sailors and marines the squadron put ashore at Canea on 15 February 1897.The British in Crete, 1896 to 1913: Naval Patrol On 21 February 1897, she joined the British torpedo gunboats and , the Russian battleship Imperator Aleksandr II, the Austro-Hungarian armored cruiser , and the German protected cruiser in the International Squadron's first direct offensive action, a brief bombardment of Cretan insurgent positions on the heights east of Canea after the insurgents refused the squadron's order to take down a Greek flag they had raised, and she hit the farmstead that served as the insurgents′ base of operations with three 6-inch (152-mm) shells.McTiernan, p. 17. After a bombardment by the British battleship on 26 and 27 March 1897 forced insurgents to abandon their siege of the Izzeddin Fortress near the entrance to Suda Bay, Revenge put a contingent of Royal Marines ashore that occupied the fortress.The British in Crete, 1896 to 1913: The battle for the Malaxa blockhouseMcTiernan, p. 23.Clowes, p. 446. Thanks to the International Squadron's actions, organized fighting on Crete ended in late March 1897, although the insurrection continued.McTiernan, p. 28. The squadron focused on supporting international occupation forces ashore and enforcing a blockade of Crete and key ports in Greece.McTiernan, pp. 20-21. After Rear Admiral Noel relieved Rear Admiral Harris on 12 January 1898, Noel withdrew his flag from Crete, and Revenge conducted operations elsewhere. However, a violent riot by Cretan Turks in Candia (now Heraklion) on 6 September 1898, prompted reinforcement of the international forces on Crete, and Revenge arrived with Rear-Admiral Noel aboard on 12 September 1898. In a meeting aboard Revenge on the morning of 13 September 1898, Noel ordered the Ottoman governor, Edhem Pasha, to take a number of actions to ensure that no further violence would take place and deliver the ringleaders of the riot to the British to face trial; when Edhem Pasha expressed reluctance, Revenge and Camperdown conducted a demonstration that convinced him to comply.McTiernan, pp. 32-35, 42. The riot led the International Squadron to demand the withdrawal of all Ottoman forces from Crete, and when the final Ottoman troops finally departed on 6 November 1898, sailors from Revenge and the British battleship supervised their embarkation aboard the British torpedo gunboat .The British in Crete, 1896 to 1913: Ottomans Evacuate CreteMcTiernan, pp. 35-36. On 19 December 1898, Revenge, with Noel aboard, joined the Italian battleship Francesco Morosini (carrying the admiral commanding the International Squadron's Italian ships) and the Russian armored cruiser Gerzog Edinburgski (with the senior Russian commander, Rear Admiral Nikolai Skrydlov, aboard) in steaming to Milos with the French protected cruiser Bugeaud, flagship of the International Squadron's overall commander, Rear Admiral Édouard Pottier. At Milos, they rendezvoused with Prince George of Greece and Denmark aboard his yacht. After Prince George boarded Bugeaud on 20 December, Revenge, Francesco Morosini, and Gerzog Edinburgski escorted Bugeaud to Crete, where Prince George disembarked on 21 December 1898 to take office as the High Commissioner of an autonomous Cretan State under the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire, bringing the Cretan uprising to an end.The British in Crete, 1896 to 1913: Escorting a PrinceClowes, p. 448McTiernan, p. 39. The International Squadron then dissolved. =1899-1913= In 1899, Revenge suffered a cordite explosion in one of her 6-inch (152-mm) magazines due to spontaneous combustion, but the damage was not very severe because only three cartridges detonated.Brown, p. 124 In April 1900, the battleship replaced her in the Mediterranean and she returned home, paying off into Fleet Reserve at Chatham Dockyard. During this time the ship had a wireless telegraph installed.Burt, pp. 85, 94 On 18 April 1901, Revenge was recommissioned at Chatham by Captain Frederic Fisher to relieve Alexandra as both the coast guard ship at Portland and the flagship of Rear Admiral Sir Gerard Noel, Admiral Superintendent of Naval Reserves. In March 1902, she arrived at Portsmouth for a refit that included the provision of casemates for her upper-deck six-inch guns, and her crew was temporarily transferred to the elderly ironclad , which also took on her duties at Portland. Captain Fisher and his crew were back on board Revenge in early June 1902, following gun trials after the repairs. After the refit, she took part in the fleet review held at Spithead on 16 August 1902 for the coronation of King Edward VII, then commissioned in October 1902 to serve as flagship of the Home Fleet upon its creation.Parkes, p. 362 Revenge (background) collided with the battleship (foreground) in Portsmouth in 1912. In April 1904, Revenge and her sister ship both struck a submerged wreck off the Scilly Isles while serving with the Home Fleet, damaging their bottoms. In July 1905, the ship participated in maneuvers with the Reserve Fleet and was then transferred to the Portsmouth Reserve Division on 1 September 1905. In June 1906, she relieved the battleship Colossus as the gunnery training ship at Portsmouth and was assigned to the gunnery school HMS Excellent.Burt, pp. 92, 94 On 13 June 1908, Revenge was struck by the merchant ship when the latter was cut loose by her tugboat during a sudden squall in Portsmouth Harbour. In October 1909, she conducted gunnery tests on the obsolete battleship to evaluate the effects of shells against varying thicknesses of armour.Brown, pp. 116, 118–19; Burt, p. 94 On 7 January 1912, the ship was badly damaged when, during a gale at Portsmouth, she broke loose from her moorings and drifted onto the bow of the dreadnought . Later that year, her guns were relined down to 10 inches (254 mm) for testing;Campbell 1982, p. 45 the liners were removed in October 1912. Revenge was relieved as a gunnery training ship by the battleship and paid off on 15 May 1913. She was laid up at Motherbank, awaiting disposal. =World War I= Revenge was given a reprieve from the scrapyard by the outbreak of World War I in August 1914. The Admiralty decided to bring her back into service for use in coastal bombardment duties off the coast of Flanders. In September and October 1914, she was refitted at Portsmouth for this mission, which included relining her 13.5-inch guns down to 12 inches (305 mm), improving their range by about 1,000 yards (914 meters).Campbell 1981, pp. 96, 202 Her refit completed, she was ordered on 31 October 1914 to stand by to relieve the battleship as flagship of the Dover Patrol. Revenge was declared ready for service on 5 November 1914, and was assigned to the Channel Fleet's new 6th Battle Squadron along with the battleships Albemarle, , , , and . Plans for the squadron to participate in an attack on German submarine bases were cancelled due to bad weather on 14 November 1914, and instead Revenge and the battleship departed Dover, England, for Dunkirk, France. Flemish coast in 1915. She has a deliberately induced to list to increase the range of her guns. Revenge participated in her first action of the war when she joined the gunboat , six British and four French destroyers, and a French torpedo boat in bombarding German troops from off Nieuwpoort, Belgium, on 22 November 1914. On 15–16 December 1914, Revenge bombarded German heavy artillery batteries, during which time she received two 8-inch (203-mm) shell hits, one of which penetrated her hull below the waterline and caused her to be withdrawn for repairs.Burt, pp. 94, 99; Corbett, pp. 19–20 In early 1915, the ship participated in experiments using aircraft to observe and control her gunfire, but these were only partially successful.Bacon, pp. 77, 79 In April and May 1915 she underwent a refit at Chatham Dockyard in which she had anti- torpedo bulges fitted.Burt, pp. 87, 90, 99 Afterwards, Revenge conducted trials using sea-based observers on off-shore platforms to direct the bombardment.Bacon, pp. 79–80 On 2 August 1915, she was renamed Redoubtable to free the name Revenge for a new dreadnought battleship. On 7 September 1915, Redoubtable returned to combat, joining the gunboats Bustard and in bombarding German barracks and gun positions at Westende, inflicting much damage on the Germans. One of her anti-torpedo bulges was deliberately flooded to give her a list that would increase the range of her guns. The ship was hit by a pair of 6-inch shells during the action.Bacon, p. 89; Burt, p. 99 Redoubtable underwent another refit from October to December 1915. Afterwards, she was not recommissioned, instead serving as an accommodation ship at Portsmouth until February 1919. Disposal Redoubtable was sold to Thos W Ward for scrapping for £42,750Burt, p. 99 on 6 November 1919. She subsequently was broken up at Swansea and Briton Ferry.

The Sao lived by the Chari River basin in territory that later became part of Cameroon and Chad. They are the earliest people to have left clear traces of their presence in the territory of modern Cameroon.Hudgens and Trillo 1051. Sometime around the 16th century, conversion to Islam changed the cultural identity of the former Sao. Today, several ethnic groups of northern Cameroon and southern Chad, but particularly the Sara, Kotoko, claim descent from the civilization of the Sao. Origins The Sao civilisation began as early as the sixth or fourth century BC, and by the end of the first millennium BC, their presence was well established around Lake Chad and near the Chari River.DeLancey and DeLancey 237. The city states of the Sao reached their apex sometime between the ninth and fifteenth centuries AD. Although some scholars estimate that the Sao civilization south of Lake Chad lasted until the fourteenth or fifteenth century, the majority opinion is that it ceased to exist as a separate culture sometime in the 16th century subsequently to the expansion of the Bornu Empire. Insoll, Archaeology, 281; Fanso, History, 18. The Kotoko are the inheritors of the former city states of the Sao.Lebeuf, Principautés, 53-120. Culture It had been suggested that the Sao were the descendants of the Hyksos who conquered Ancient Egypt and that they moved south from the Nile valley into middle Africa in several waves under pressure from invaders, or that they originated in the Bilma Oasis north of the lake Chad.Fanso, History, 15-19. A more widely accepted theory is that the Sao were simply the indigenous inhabitants of the Lake Chad basin and that their ultimate origins lie south of the lake.Fanso 18. And recent archaeological research indicates that the Sao civilization developed indigenously from earlier cultures in the region (such as the Gajiganna culture, which began at around 1,800 BCE and began to build fortified towns by about 800 BCE), gradually increasing in complexity. Sao artifacts show that they were a sophisticated civilization working in bronze, copper, and iron.Fanso 19. Finds include bronze sculptures and terra cotta statues of human and animal figures, coins, funerary urns, household utensils, jewelry, highly decorated pottery, and spears.Fanso 19; Hudgens and Trillo 1051. The largest Sao archaeological finds have been made south of Lake Chad. G. T. Stride presented these important facts about the Sao civilization. ,,[T]he So people possessed considerable political and artistic genius. Although they never combined effectively to form an empire, they developed city-states which were the centres of intense local patriotism. Each city was surrounded by strong defensive walls and dominated the life of the surrounding countryside which it both protected and governed. Government was by an elaborate hierarchy, headed by a divine ruler ... Except on ceremonial occasions, the rulers made few public appearances and even then remained concealed from the common gaze by a screen. Women occupied a respected position in society and the Queen Mother and senior sister of the ruler exercised considerable political influence on the government of the states. The So people were mainly settled farmers but among them were craftsmen of considerable industrial and artistic merit. They were able to work in both clay and metals to manufacture household utensils, tools, and works of art for religious purposes. Impressive objects found by archaeologists include burial urns and ... figures of animals and human beings both in clay and bronze. All this had been achieved ... before about A. D. 700 ... The vigour of the government and civilization is best demonstrated by their long resistance to the empires of Kanem and Bornu [sic] and the fact that many cultural characteristics of the Kanuri [were later] adopted from the So.\\" Ethnic groups in the Lake Chad basin, such as the Buduma, Gamergu, Kanembu, Kotoko, and Musgum claim descent from the Sao. Lebeuf supports this connection and has traced symbolism from Sao art in works by the Guti and Tukuri subgroups of the Logone-Birni people. Lebeuf, Principautés, 137-173; Fanso, History, 19. Oral histories add further details about the people: The Sao were made up of several patrilineal clans who were united into a single polity with one language, race, and religion. In these narratives, the Sao are presented as giants and mighty warriors who fought and conquered their neighbors.

Metering pulses are also known as billing pulses and tax pulses.https://www.3amsystems.com/World_Tone_Database/Signalling_guide?q=Metering_pulse The properties of metering signals differ between the telephone administrations in various countries. Some systems use alternating current pulses superimposed on the direct current (battery) levels of the local loop, while others may use a reversal of tip-ring polarity of the wire pair. Common frequencies of the A.C. pulses are 50 Hz, 12 kHz, and 16 kHz, with typical durations of the signal varying from several tens to hundreds of milliseconds. 50 Hz pulses are applied to the telephone circuit as common-mode signals with respect to ground, as applying them differentially would make them audible for the talking parties as buzzing tones. The pulse amplitude (RMS voltage) is high enough to distinguish them from signals induced from mains electricity. 12- and 16 kHz metering pulses are applied differentially across the telephone circuit, as these frequencies cannot be heard by listeners with conventional telephone instruments. Each pulse represents an incremental cost. For calls with higher billing rates, the exchange equipment generates metering pulses at a higher rate than during calls to cheaper destinations, or during periods of lower billing rates. On residential telephone lines, metering pulses are not used to generate billing records, but serve to inform the calling subscriber with a visual display in form of a counter or advancing dial connected to the telephone instrument. In commercial pay station telephones and coin collectors, A.C. signaling pulses operate coin control.J.G. Pearce, Telecommunications Switching, Plenum Press & Springer Science, N.Y. (1981), , p.96.

Under the bridge, the canal Hammarbykanalen carries the water of Hammarby Sjö over to Saltsjön. The bridge, actually two separate bridges, carries the railway Saltsjöbanan and a road. For unknown reasons the location of the bridge, like many other places along the shores of Sweden and Norway, was named 'Danviken', meaning danernas vik, \\"The Bay of the Danes\\", and until the early 20th century most people called it Dannviken (short a, like Danmark is still pronounced) rather than, as is common today, Daanviken (long a).  History  Since King Gustav Vasa (1496–1560) had the water level of the lake Hammarbysjön increased by 4.8 metres, the lake emptied into Saltsjön through a small rivulet overshadowed by a simple wooden bridge and the familiar silhouette of an old mill, and for many centuries Danviken remained mostly renowned for its hospital, Danviks hospital, which the king had moved from Riddarholmen near the city. In 1922, a railway viaduct built in 1893 was demolished together with the old bridge, both replaced by a single-leaf bascule bridge with its concrete counterweight hanging over the 14 metres wide roadway shared by trains and vehicles. On the eastern side of the canal a concrete viaduct connected to the bridge, and the bridge's load-carrying steel trusses left a horizontal clearance of 12.5 metres for the ships below. To deal with increasing postwar traffic loads, the capacity of the bridge was increased in 1956 by adding a new bridge south of and parallel to the old, the two structures separated by less than a metre. The new bridge was 22.2 metres wide, of which 14 metres were used by vehicles, and 5 metres for bicycles and pedestrians, which effectively left the trains and bicyclists have the old bridge for themselves. A single-leaf bascule bridge was chosen again, but this time having in mind that the canal was prospected to be widened, which would hopefully be done easily by adding more bridge to the present unaltered structure. By the 1970s traffic had increased enough again to motivate a redevelopment of the traffic system surrounding the bridge and the enlargement of the bridge itself. This was done in the period 1973–1977 by replacing one of the open-web girders with a steel girder underlying the deck, thus giving space for additional cantilevering roadways. Plans There were plans to a new high double-track tramway bridge, carrying the Saltsjöbanan railway without delays for any bridge openings. Rising cost estimates (about 3 bn SEK plus more at Slussen station etc.) have caused the plans to be cancelled. Instead a new metro line will be built between Kungsträdgården and Nacka.

To help the oasification process, engineers aim to develop a thriving dense woody plant cover to redress the hydrological, edaphic and botanical degradation affecting a slope. This is done through appropriate soil preparation and the introduction of suitable plant species. It is also necessary to make adequate water harvesting systems—ideally taking advantage of the degradation process of the slope, collecting runoff water in ponds around the sites to be forested. The term \\"oasification\\" was coined in 1999 by Andrés Martínez de Azagra Paredes, PhD Forest Engineer and professor on Hydraulics and Forest Hydrology at E.T.S. of Agroforestry Engineering in Palencia, University of Valladolid, Spain. In oasification, soil and nutrient harvesting are regarded as fundamental component parts in the reclamation process of a degraded slope. Besides harvesting water, oasification preserves and accumulates soil and nutrients, helping to control water erosion—a common problem in dry climates. Ludwig et al. (1997) reported about sloping areas under semiarid conditions in Australia where the landscape is naturally divided into source and sink zones (surface runoff and run-on areas), which are sometimes reclaimed by plant species through retention of water soil and litter.

Specialising in Gaul and the Roman epoch, he was notably a student of the École Normale Supérieure, member of the École française de Rome and professor of national antiquities at the Collège de France. His major work is a multi-volume history of Gaul. He was involved with the controversy over the archaeological findings at Glozel in France; he was among those who believed the artefacts recovered were faked.

Ultra Gypsy expanded on the American Tribal Style repertoire of movement, costuming, and music. \\"In the late 1990s Jill and her dance company, Ultra Gypsy, began to scale down the tribal costume, expand the movement vocabulary, work with modern DJ mixed music and play with theatrical themes in their performances. This had a significant impact on tribal dancers and opened up the floodgates of Tribal Fusion innovation.\\" An early example of Ultra Gypsy's work was filmed by the cable TV program \\"The Cutting Edge\\", produced by Jerry B in Berkeley, CA in 2001; directed and edited by D. Sosnoski.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydMv17AsMJo Stephanie Barto, a student of Nericcio, brought ATS to the Midwest with a group called Read My Hips, founded in Chicago with Heather Stants. Later, during the early development of Tribal Fusion, Heather Stants worked to introduce new elements to Tribal Style bellydance, including a minimalist aesthetic, underground electronica music and elements of modern dance. In 1999, she formed Urban Tribal Dance Company in San Diego, largely influenced by hip hop and street dance styles. In contrast to many other tribal fusion performers, Urban Tribal Dance Company was known for their minimalist costuming more traditional to modern dance than to Tribal Style. Tribal Fusion was named and largely popularized by Rachel Brice, who was the first to fuse American Cabaret technique with American Tribal Style, and the first to perform as a soloist. In the early days, she referred to herself as \\"Cabaret with a Tribal aesthetic.\\" Rachel Brice attributes the technique used by many tribal fusion dancers to Suhaila Salimpour.http://www.deeprootsdance.com/2010/09/rachel- brice-on-tribal-fusion.html In an email conversation between Rachel Brice and Carolena Nericcio, Carolena wrote that Rachel performed a \\"Fusion.\\" Rachel decided to refer to herself as \\"Tribal Fusion,\\" to reflect that she was fusing the style of Fat Chance Belly Dance with other styles. This term stuck, and its definition has morphed as dancers have pursued it as a style of its own. > \\"Most people can agree that the poster girl of Tribal Fusion Belly Dance is > Rachel Brice.

It > is from ATS that Tribal Fusion set its foundation.\\" Mardi Love, a pioneer in Tribal Fusion, was an early member of Urban Tribal with Heather Stants, later joining The Indigo with Rachel Brice. Zoe Jakes was a long time and contributing member of The Indigo, going on to create her own form of Avant Garde belly dance with Beats Antique. Rachel Brice also greatly contributed to the popularity of movements similar to popping, though she credits Suhaila Salimpour and former troupe mate Ariellah Aflalo as the sources. Initial members of The Indigo performance group were Mardi Love, Rachel Brice, Michelle Campbell, Sharon Kihara, Shawna Rai, Janice Solimeno, and Ariellah Aflalo. Sharon Kihara also studied with Frederique (The Lady Fred) and performed with Ultra Gypsy. Today, Tribal Fusion is a rapidly growing and evolving dance form. Some feel it is moving away from its American Tribal Style Belly Dance Roots, and some newer Tribal Fusion Dancers have never studied American Tribal Style Belly Dance. For the founders of the form, however, the connection with American Tribal Style Belly Dance is what makes it considered \\"Tribal Fusion Belly Dance,\\" rather than simply \\"Fusion Belly Dance.\\" Costume Many Tribal Fusion dancers once used the ATS \\"uniform\\" as a basis for costuming, the scenario is changing. Additional elements of the costume are strongly influenced by the nature of the fusion - flamenco fusion dancers will wear flamenco skirts, burlesque fusion dancers will wear feathers etc. Costumes are often very elaborate with layers of fabrics, Tulle bi telli, antique tribal jewelry from many cultures, hair ornaments, and permanent body adornment such as tattoos and piercings. At the other extreme, where the fusion has a strong contemporary influence, the costume is pared down to a sleek minimalist style. Mardi Love pioneered and paved the way for many of the elements of the more adorned Tribal Fusion costumes that are popular today. After working with the more minimalist Urban Tribal, she helped sculpt the intricate, vibrant, and complicated costumes worn by The Indigo. She is the artist who popularized Rajasthani cowrie falls for the hair, using colorful, hand dyed yarn to braid cowrie shells together. She also created one of the most popular belt styles of the mid-to late 2000s by combining Indian mirrored \\"shisha\\" with Afghan Guls (beaded medallions), and adding colorful yarn fringe (such as Colinette Pointe 5). Subgenres Balkys, a dancer performing in France Tribal Fusion is closely related to Dark Fusion pioneered by Ariellah Aflalo, and Improvisational Tribal Style (ITS) bellydance pioneered by Amy Sigil. Tribal Fusion and ITS are both descended from American Tribal Style (ATS) while Dark Fusion exists between Tribal Fusion and Gothic belly dance. Vaudeville bellydance is an emerging style of tribal fusion bellydance that uses cultural elements of the mid-1800s through the 1930s. The rising popularity of this style is partially due to The Indigo and their show Le Serpent Rouge. Vaudeville bellydance often uses jazz, swing, blues, Balkan, or Middle Eastern-derived music (Beats Antique is a prime example). The costumes are perhaps the most recognizable feature of vaudeville bellydance because they almost always incorporate style influences from the Jazz Era and earlier.http://vaudevillebellydance.blogspot.com/ As the name vaudeville bellydance suggests, this style is deeply inspired by pre-WWII vaudeville acts, often incorporating comedy into performances. Vaudeville bellydance can also be called tribal vintage style, although vaudeville bellydance is typically inspired by a more narrow time period. This form is closely associated with Burlesque fusion bellydance and much overlap exists between them. Both styles have strongly influenced the tribal fusion genre overall. Other popular tribal fusion subtypes include steampunk, Art Nouveau, gothic fusion bellydance, world fusion, theatrical bellydance, and urban tribal which is a hip-hop/jazz dance fusion. Many tribal fusion dancers also practice other movement arts such as aerialism, hatha yoga, hooping, fire spinning, poi and other flow arts, juggling, contemporary circus, erotic dance and burlesque, ballet, global folk dance, gymnastics, and martial arts; as such, influences from these arts can be witnessed firsthand in the acts presented at haflas and festivals across the country. Music Zoe Jakes performing to Beats Antique Tribal Fusion dance evolved closely with developments in the electronica and world music genres. Early Bay Area DJs who contributed to the form include Cheb i Sabbah & Bassnectar. The movement carried over into the music produced specifically for bellydancers, also called Oriental music, giving rise to the creation of the electronica Oriental genre. Artist Jeremiah Soto of Solace and Eventide Musical Productions produced some of the first Electronica Oriental albums, quickly followed by Turbo Tabla artist Karim Nagi, and beatboxing champion Pete List. Many more names followed suit creating a rapidly growing musical outlet for the budding new dance form. Producer Miles Copeland contributed greatly to the electronica Oriental movement signing many musicians and dancers who would become forerunners of the Tribal Fusion movement.

It was directed by Robert Lewis, written by Lew Hunter, and stars Melinda Dillon, Richard Masur, Dana Hill, and Ronny Cox. It is a Green/Epstein Production in association with Columbia Pictures Television. The film received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Drama Special, and won a Young Artist Award for star Hill in the category of Best Young Actress. After its initial airing on CBS, it was later released on VHS by RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video in 1983, and turned up occasionally via syndication and cable television into the mid-1990s. Production The screenplay for Fallen Angel was written by Lew Hunter, and went through fourteen rewrites. Jim Green, arguing that he \\"did not want to make this film [and] CBS asked [us] to make it,\\" was focused on avoiding sensationalism common in too many television films.J. O'Conner, John (February 24, 1981). \\"TV – Child Pornography, Social Disease\\". The New York Times. Retrieved April 15, 2017. Plot As the film opens, a child pornography shoot is disrupted when its young star Michelle (Cheshire) refuses to perform. The man who recruited her, pedophile Howard \\"Howie\\" Nichols (Masur), attempts to reason with director Dennis (Hayward), claiming he \\"just needs a few days\\" (in order for Michelle to have an abortion, as Howard had gotten her pregnant). However, Dennis has already made up his mind to dump Michelle and gives Howard an ultimatum: find a more cooperative young \\"star\\" or he'll blow the whistle on the operation and disappear, leaving Howard to take the rap. Faced with this threat, Howard agrees to begin searching for a new girl to take Michelle's place. 12-year-old Jennifer Phillips (Hill), a recent elementary school graduate and aspiring gymnast, fits the mold perfectly. She was voted \\"Most Shy\\" in her class, her father was recently killed in a robbery of his catering truck, she feels unable to communicate with her mother Sherry (Dillon), and she cannot accept her mother's new boyfriend (who was also her father's co-worker), Frank Dawson (Cox). By chance, Jennifer shows up at the local video arcade while Howard is there posting an ad for the girls' softball team he coaches at the town rec center. He strikes up a brief conversation and gives her a quarter. She runs into him again while leaving. After snapping a Polaroid photo of Jennifer, Howard tells her she looks like Farrah Fawcett and that she would be great in movies. Before she departs, he takes another picture and asks Jennifer if she'd be interested in joining his softball team, to which she agrees. During their next meeting, Howard asks Jennifer if she has a nickname; when she tells him no, he dubs her \\"Angel\\" before taking yet another picture, this time comparing her to Raquel Welch. As she leaves, Howard rescinds his earlier comparison, telling her \\"you know why you don't look like Raquel? You're sexier.\\" Following a 13th birthday celebration at the coffee shop where Sherry works as a waitress, Jennifer again spends the day with Howard, who gives her a teddy bear (which she names Howard, after him) and sets up an impromptu photo shoot by the lake. Things start fairly innocent, but Howard soon asks her to lift her knee-length skirt and \\"show a little skin\\" while posing. When she proves reluctant to do so, Howard attempts to explain to her about \\"the beauty of the human body\\", even showing her some pornographic magazines, but then backs off. He does, however, make Jennifer promise to \\"keep our real friendship a secret.\\" The next day, Howard takes her to the local animal shelter to give her a puppy, whom she names Fred, but asks Jennifer to just tell her mom that she found him. They then head back to the lake for another photo shoot, with Howard now suggesting Jennifer pose without her blouse and shorts, but allowing her to keep her bra and panties on. Assuring Jennifer he'd never hurt her, she finally agrees to pose, no doubt swayed by Howard's offer to give her a full set of prints, \\"like a real movie star.\\" Having decided she's ready to make her \\"debut\\", Howard arranges for Jennifer to come to the house where Dennis does his filming. After a brief meeting, Dennis realizes she's exactly what he's looking for, but Howard attempts to stop him, wanting Jennifer all to himself. However, Dennis reiterates his threat to tip off the authorities and make Howard the fall guy, and Howard backs off. Jennifer is then teamed with a boy about her age named David (Gunn), and the two start out posing for a variety of fairly innocent shots (mostly depicting the pair kissing and cuddling), but during a shoot at the lake, Howard asks them to pose nude. A seasoned veteran, David cooperates, but Jennifer refuses. Using his manipulative tactics, Howard reminds Jennifer how much he needs her, and how he's the only one who does. Finally, after he threatens to send Fred back, a tearful Jennifer reluctantly complies, with Howard reminding her to \\"deny everything\\" and \\"always say no\\" if caught. As it turns out, Jennifer is caught when Frank spots her in a kiddie porn magazine ad that some \\"idiot sheet metal guys\\" had on one of his stops, which he informs Sherry of. Remembering what Howard told her, Jennifer denies everything when confronted, but convinced she can no longer stay at home, later runs away. She attempts to ask Howard for a place to stay (as he put his three young male stars up in a nearby apartment), but he initially refuses, only to change his mind when Jennifer gets flirtatious, assuring Howard \\"I'll make it up to you\\" and reminding him how she's \\"getting older and better.\\" Upon returning home, Sherry finds her daughter's goodbye letter (in which Jennifer admits to having been the girl in the magazine ad) and begins searching adult establishments and popular hangouts in the area. Later, she goes to the rec center, where Howard feigns surprise over Jennifer's disappearance and absence at that evening's ballgame, but promises to talk to her and send her home if he finds her. In reality, Jennifer is at the boys' apartment and avoided the game at Howard's suggestion (\\"it's almost the first place they'll look\\"). Before leaving the ball field, it suddenly occurs to Sherry to check the second number Howard had given her earlier as his \\"answering service,\\" and she calls the police station to get the corresponding address. Meanwhile, Howard stops by the apartment before heading home, sends the boys into the other room and attempts to seduce Jennifer. However, only moments before he can go through with his devious plans, he is stopped in the nick of time by an angry Sherry, who now fully understands exactly what Howard was doing, and flies into a rage at him before leaving with her daughter and the boys. Subsequently, arrested for his illegal activities, Howard prepares for the impending trial with his attorney, reviewing his testimony and attempting to justify his perversions (during which time we learn that Howard's former \\"angel\\" Michelle has been institutionalized, making her the \\"Fallen Angel\\" of the title). Meanwhile, the prosecution wants Jennifer to testify against Howard, but Sherry refuses to allow it, feeling they need to move on. However, Frank is more objective, admitting that while he's worried about what will happen to Jennifer if she testifies, he's also worried about what will happen to other kids if she doesn't, telling Sherry it could be the most important decision her daughter's ever made, and encouraging Jennifer to think about it. Gradually realizing she needs to do the right thing, Jennifer's decision is solidified by a subsequent chance encounter with Howard, who has been released on bail and attempts to talk her out of testifying. The film ends with Jennifer taking the witness stand during Howard's trial, ready to tell her story.

Geography Landscape in the ex Medio Campidano Province Geologically, it is a graben, a tectonic structure formed in the mid-Pliocene/early Pleistocene (4 to 2 million years ago). Later it was subject to large sedimentary deposition phenomena, creating an overall thickness of 600 m of sediments. The plain is crossed by the Tirso River, the longest in Sardinia. History Agriculture has been successful in Campidano since the Neolithic, continuing on through the Punic and the Romans, who cultivated here grains and grape. Dams of the large Sardinian rivers nourish the artichoke and wheat cultures, also typical products of this zone. Paddy fields are present near Oristano.

The date of the play's authorship is uncertain, and is generally placed in the 1625–32 period by scholars. The title page of the first edition states that the play was acted by the King's Men at the Blackfriars Theatre. The text is preceded by the motto \\"Fide Honor,\\" an anagram for \\"John Forde,\\" which Ford employs in other of his plays as well. The volume was dedicated to William Lord Craven, Baron of Hampsteed-Marshall.Craven, eldest son of a Lord Mayor of London, was a prominent soldier of the era who fought with King Gustavus Adolphus in the Thirty Years' War, and was later rumored to have secretly married Elizabeth of Bohemia after the death of her first husband, Frederick V, Elector Palatine. Synopsis Set in Classical Greece, the play recounts the story of Amyclas, King of Laconia (or Sparta), his daughter Calantha, and their court. The young Spartan general Ithocles, motivated by pride, interferes with his sister Penthea's intended marriage to Orgilus. Ithocles demands that she marry a greater nobleman, Bassanes. Bassanes proves to be a tyrannical husband, irrational and jealous, who keeps his wife a prisoner. Orgilus pretends a journey to Athens but secretly remains in Sparta in disguise. Ithocles, victorious in battle, recognizes that he has wronged Penthea and Orgilus, and supports a planned marriage between his friend Prophilus and Orgilus's sister Euphrania. Ithocles himself seeks the hand of Calantha, the King's daughter - and she accepts him, instead of her cousin Nearchos, a prince of Argos. The unhappy Penthea starves herself to death; Orgilus traps Ithocles in a mechanical chair and murders him, just before his planned wedding to Calantha. In the closing scene, Calantha dances at a prenuptial banquet, and keeps dancing as she is informed of the deaths of her father the King, her friend Penthea, and her fiance Ithocles. The dance ended, Calantha, now Queen of Sparta, condemns Orgilus for his murder of Ithocles, appoints Nearchos her heir and successor, and dies of a broken heart. Notes References * Farr, Dorothy M.

In the early 20th century a new colliery at Thurcroft was developed. The Fence Colliery Company was formed in 1862 with the purchase of Fence Colliery, a small coal pit sunk alongside the main Sheffield to Worksop road at the lower end of the village of Fence. This pit had already been in operation for over 20 years and under new ownership was considerably developed. It closed as a coal producing unit in 1904, coal from its reserves being brought to the surface at Orgreave, but it was retained as a pumping station and later became the National Coal Boards workshops, finally closing in the 1990s. Orgreave Colliery (1982) Orgreave Colliery, then a small concern, was bought by the company in 1870. It was situated less than a mile from Fence, adjacent to the main line of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway, to the west of Woodhouse. It was joined to this railway by a steeply graded but short branch line. Five years after the purchase of Orgreave colliery the company changed its name and became Rother Vale Collieries Limited extending its empire just two years on with the sinking of a new pit at Treeton. A railway branch was constructed by well-known contractors Logan and Hemingway between Orgreave and Treeton to link the collieries to the Midland Railway at Treeton. In order to gain a foothold in the traffic at Treeton the M.S.& L.R. gained authorisation for a branch line, unusually, under its \\"Extension to London\\" Act, 1893. This opened for traffic, including the Paddy Mail, on 10 October 1898. Thurcroft Colliery (1977) Church built for Rother Vale Collieries in Thurcroft Moving further eastwards the Rother Vale Colliery Company began the sinking of a new colliery at Thurcroft in 1909. Although the Barnsley seam was reached in 1913 extraction became difficult. The point of sinking was situated over a large geological fault which had thrown the coal out of its normal position. In 1918 the United Steel Companies was formed and the following year, along with steel making interests in South Yorkshire and Lincolnshire, Rother Vale Collieries became part of the group.

In a statement published in To Pontiki on January 25, 2007, Revolutionary Struggle admitted that it had carried out the embassy attack, claiming that the \\"strike was our answer to the criminal war against 'terrorism' that the US has unleashed over the entire planet with the help of fellow-traveling states\\". The European Union added RS to its list of designated terrorist organizations on June 29, 2007.MKO stays on EU terrorist list Payvand On May 18, 2009, a U.S. State Department spokesman announced in a press briefing that U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton had formally designated Revolutionary Struggle as a foreign terrorist organization under the U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act.Justia Regulation Tracker, The Federal Register, Vol. 74, No. 94, 18 May 2009 =Investigation= In January 2009, Greek police said their ballistics tests showed the weapon used in RS's 30 April 2007 attack was used again in a 5 January 2009 shooting of a police officer. A second weapon used in the 5 January attack was tied by the police to a 23 December 2008 attack on a police bus. That attack was reported to have been claimed by a group calling itself Popular Action (Λαϊκή Δράση, Laiki Drasi), as a response to the 2008 civil unrest in Greece.Guns 'link several Greek attacks'. BBC News. 9 January 2009. =Arrests= On March 10, 2010, two men were spotted breaking into a car (SEAT Ibiza) in Dafni, Attica at 4.40am and possibly resisted arrest by firing on the police officers. One of them, Lambros Fountas, who was later found to have been on the terrorist watch list since 1995, was shot dead, but the other escaped. However, the escapee left forensic evidence which linked him to previous terrorist attacks. In April 2010 after a long investigation, six suspected members of the group were apprehended. The subsequent investigation led police to over €119,000 in cash, Zastava handguns, fake identification documents which were used to rent safehouses, explosives (195 kg of ANFO hidden in a motorbike garage) and detailed plans of future terrorist attacks. Later, police investigating another address in Kypseli rented under another false ID used by the suspects discovered an RPG-7. Other weapons discovered there included many hand grenades, two Kalashnikovs and an MP5 submachine gun that ballistics later linked conclusively to previous attacks.http://www.phantis.com/news/?newsID=2010042191248 In late April 2010, the three prime suspects being held confirmed their involvement in Revolutionary Struggle in a letter to the press, but denied that the government could prove they participated in the actions related to their charges. The three also promised to continue their revolutionary activities as long as they are living. Pola Roupa and Nikos Maziotis, who both openly admit their involvement in Revolutionary Struggle, were convicted for their participation in the group's activities in absentia after absconding with their son in 2012. Maziotis was captured in 2014 and Roupa in 2017. On January 31st, 2020, Konstantina Athanasopoulou was arrested along with Giannis Michailidis of the Conspiracy of Fire Nuclei along with an unnamed woman were captured by Anti-Terrorism police, claiming they were heavily armed. https://www.amwenglish.com/articles/fugitive-anarchist-comrades-g-michailidis- k-athanasopoulou-captured-by-anti-terrorist-police/ List of attacks * January 2007: Grenade fired at American embassy facade in Athens * April 2007: Shots fired at police station in Athens suburb of Nea Ionia * October 2008: Failed bomb attempt on Royal Dutch Shell's headquarters in south Athens * January 2009: In response to the killing of Alexandros Grigoropoulos, shots fired at police guarding the Ministry of Culture building in Athens, seriously wounding one policeman * March 2009: Two bomb attacks on Citibank branches in AthensReport: Greek terror group claims Citibank attacks.

The Castlegate Quarter is one of the eleven quarters of Sheffield city centre. It is named after Castlegate, the quarter's main thoroughfare. The boundaries of the Castlegate Quarter are formed by Castlegate and the River Don to the north, Exchange Place to the east, Commercial Street and part of the High Street to the south, and Angel Street and Snig Hill to the west. For the latter part of the 20th century, the Castlegate Quarter was dominated by Castle Market, a large indoor market building. Following the demolition of Castle Market in 2015, the quarter is now undergoing regeneration as of 2020. The quarter's eponymous road, Castlegate, was originally part of the main thoroughfare from the city centre to the north of the city, linking Park Square to The Wicker; however, the completion of the Sheffield Northern Relief Road dual-carriageway in 2007 redirected traffic away from the Castlegate area, and the road was downgraded. Castlegate was built along the southern bank of the River Don along the north side of what was once Sheffield Castle, and was originally the location of several slaughterhouses. It has also subsequently served as a back entrance to the Alexandra Opera House and then the Castle Market, which was constructed in the 1960s to provide permanent accommodation to tradesmen. Castle Market closed in November 2013 with the opening of the Moor Markets across the city centre, and demolition of Castle Market commenced in 2015. The foundations of the old Sheffield Castle, from which the area takes its name, were rediscovered following the demolition of the market building. In August 2018, archaeologists began excavations of the castle foundations in order to return them to public view for the first time in hundreds of years. Sheffield City Council subsequently invested £5 million as part of Grey to Green Phase Two, a regeneration plan for the Castlegate Quarter following the closure of the market, which includes removing the River Sheaf from its culvert close to its confluence with the River Don and creating a new riverside park incorporating the castle ruins. As part of the scheme, Castlegate was pedestrianised and its bus stops were relocated onto surrounding roads.https://sheffieldnewsroom.co.uk/news/grey_to_green_phase_two/  References  Category:Sheffield City Centre (quarters) ","title":"Castlegate Quarter"},{"id":"8885423","text":"Robert Andrew Willis, DL (born 17 May 1947) is an Anglican priest, theologian, chaplain and hymn writer.

William McGillivray (1764 - October 16, 1825), of Chateau St. Antoine, Montreal, was a Scottish-born fur trader who succeeded his uncle as the last chief partner of the North West Company. He was elected a member of the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada and afterwards was appointed to the Legislative Council of Lower Canada. In 1795, he was inducted as a member into the Beaver Club. During the War of 1812 he was given the rank of lieutenant colonel in the Corps of Canadian Voyageurs. He owned substantial estates in Scotland, Lower and Upper Canada. His home in Montreal was one of the early estates of the Golden Square Mile. McGillivray Ridge in British Columbia is named for him. Early years In 1764, McGillivray was born at Dunlichity, near Daviot in the Scottish Highlands. He was the eldest son of Donald Roy McGillivray (1741–1803), tacksman of Achnalodan in Dunmaglass and later of Dalscoilt in Strathnairn. His mother, Anne (1740–1807), was the daughter of Lieutenant John McTavish (1701–1774), of Garthbeg. The McGillivrays had traditionally held the Dunmaglass estate since the fourteenth century, and William's grandfather was a first cousin of the Chief of Clan McGillivray, Captain William McGillivray of Dunmaglass. However, on his side of the family the land had dissipated so that William's father was a small tenant on what had become part of the Lovat estate, and he was unable to provide secondary schooling for William and his brothers Duncan and Simon. When William's uncle, Simon McTavish, visited from Montreal in 1776, he paid for the education of the McGillivray boys and in 1784 brought William out to Canada to work for him in the North West Company, with an annual salary of £100. Fur trading As a clerk, after a year between Montreal and Rainy River, he was accompanied by proprietor Patrick Small to Île-à-la-Crosse, Saskatchewan. He spent the winter of 1786–87 at Snake Lake, setting up a trading post to compete with Gregory, McLeod & Co. He and Roderick McKenzie served their respective companies on good terms with each other. McGillivray played an important part in the two companies merging in 1787. The following year he returned to Île-à-la-Crosse and started trading at Rat River. This enabled him to purchase the share left open by Peter Pond in the North West Company, for £800 in 1790. Promoted to the rank of proprietor, he was given responsibility at Churchill River, where about 80 men and 40 Métis lived. At about this time he took his 'country wife'. In 1791, he was given charge of the westernmost department on the Athabasca River. All these postings were crucial to the experience he needed to one day step into his uncle's shoes, who was becoming increasingly dominant within the NWC. McTavish, Frobisher & Co. McGillivray returned to Montreal in 1793 and then took a trip to Scotland and England. He was now a partner in McTavish, Frobisher & Co., who controlled the NWC. With John Gregory, he was sent to manage the company's huge depot at Grand Portage, stirring jealousy among some of the other partners. When Joseph Frobisher retired in 1798, McGillivray took his place. He set up an agency at New York City to get around the East India Company's monopoly enabling them to trade with China. He was closely involved too with the firm of McTavish, Fraser & Co., at London, managed by another relation of his uncle's, John Fraser. In 1803, he helped organize the move of the NWC's main depot from Grand Portage to Thunder Bay. All this time he was dealing with relations with the Hudson's Bay Company and the splinter XY Company that had broken away from the NWC, led by John Richardson. North West Company North West Company - Coat of Arms When Simon McTavish died in 1804, McGillivray was well experienced and his choice to succeed him as the head of the NWC. He took over at a period of intense competition in the North American fur trade. His first action was to strike a deal ending the NWC's rivalry with the XY Company, later serving as a coalition between them. He surrendered 25% of the NWC's shares to the XY, but left his close friend, Alexander Mackenzie, out of the new co-partnership because of his reputation as a trouble-maker in the fur trade. He reorganized the managing firm of McTavish, Frobisher and Co., which after John Gregory's retirement he renamed McTavish, McGillivrays and Co. The partners were himself, his brother Duncan, their brother-in-law Angus Shaw, and the two Hallowell brothers, James and William. The London firm of McTavish, Fraser & Co., remained unchanged except for McGillivray bringing in another brother, Simon. Due to rising costs within the NWC, he reduced manpower and curtailed the various costly habits of the living and travelling arrangements of the proprietors. Competition with Astor The rising costs and fall in profits were largely attributed to the intensified competition with John Jacob Astor and the HBC and the disruptions in the European market caused by the French Revolution. At first the NWC had collaborated with Astor, to avoid the East India Company's monopoly, and they shared some of the same trade routes to China. Over time, American pressure at their shared Pacific trading post on the mouth of the Columbia River was applied to the NWC in a subtle but systematic fashion, and to retain his freedom, McGillivray contemplated negotiating with the East India Company. Hudson's Bay Company The rivalry between the NWC of Montreal and the English-controlled HBC gradually degenerated into a bitter and violent struggle, first under McTavish and then McGillivray. From 1810, the scarcity of beaver began to be a problem and only served to heighten tensions between the two companies. The NWC was stronger on the ground, but it was not as financially strong as the HBC. During the War of 1812, the Americans destroyed the NWC's trading post at Sault Ste. Marie, giving them a net loss of over £8,000 for that year. Also in 1812, Lord Selkirk (a shareholder in the HBC) established the Red River Colony which directly served the interests of the HBC and affected the NWC's free transport of goods between Fort William and the fur-bearing Lake Athabasca region. Attempting to gain control over the movement of Pemmican in the region, Miles Macdonell, governor of the new Red River Colony, declared war with the established NWC men. McGillivray had no illusions about Lord Selkirk's actions nor about the conduct of Miles Macdonell, remarking that Selkirk, \\"has thought proper lately to become the avowed rival of the North- West Company in the trade which they themselves have carried on for upwards of thirty years with credit to themselves. In a fair commercial competition, we have no objection to enter the lists with his Lordship, but we cannot remain passive spectators to the violence used to plunder or destroy our property\\".Northwest to the Sea; a biography of William McGillivray (Toronto and Vancouver, 1975). The struggle was continued by Macdonell's successors, Robertson and then Semple, culminating in the Battle of Seven Oaks, in which Semple and some 20 settlers were killed by the NWC men, led by Cuthbert Grant. Lord Selkirk arrested McGillivray and a number of NWC proprietors, holding them responsible. He seized Fort William and confiscated their furs for his own benefit. McGillivray was released and cleared at Montreal. The strength held by the NWC had been in a steady decline since 1810 and Selkirk's actions helped tip the balance in the power struggle towards the HBC, even with its debts. William's brother Simon conceded that from 1810 the richest and most talented partners of the NWC (notably those connected to the XY Company) had withdrawn and been replaced by men with less capital and less work ethic, and given to extravagant spending. Nepotism was also a problem: 14 members of the McTavish and McGillivray families (not including relatives by marriage) had been given partnerships since 1800, undermining the drive and morale of those hoping for promotion. Eventually, William McGillivray accepted the inevitability of a merger between the NWC and the HBC, and his brother Simon McGillivray set about bringing it to pass. An agreement was signed in 1821 and the once great Montreal company disappeared under the trading banner of the HBC. McGillivray was content that he had settled on equal terms with the HBC, but only a few months after his death both McTavish, McGillivrays & Co., of London and McGillivrays, Thain & Co., of Montreal were declared bankrupt. Life at Montreal McGillivray enjoyed a leading role in Quebec society, particularly at Montreal. He had been elected a member of the Beaver Club in 1795 and in 1804 he was made a Justice of the Peace in the Indian Territories and for the Province of Quebec. In 1808, he replaced John Richardson in the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada and in 1814 he was elected to the Legislative Council of Lower Canada. He also became a significant landowner, purchasing 12,000 acres at Inverness, Quebec in 1802, which he later sold to Joseph Frobisher. During the War of 1812, McGillivray obtained the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the Corps of Canadian Voyageurs, who succeeded in capturing Detroit. In gratitude for this service, the government of Upper Canada granted him the substantial lands at Plantagenet. In 1817, at a cost of £20,000, he purchased 'Bhein Ghael', a comparatively small but beautifully located Scottish estate on the Isle of Mull, overlooking Ghael Bay. In 1808, David Thompson had given what is now called the Kootenay River the name McGillivray's River, in honour of William and his brother Duncan. After losing the NWC to the HBC, McGillivray had made ready to leave Montreal for a new life in England. He died during a trip to London in 1825 and was buried at St James's Church, Piccadilly, where there is a memorial to him and his wife in the church. Their graves were destroyed by enemy bombs during the Second World War. A memorial to William McGillivray in St James's Church, Piccadilly.

Built in 1803, the house enjoyed \\"a magnificent view of the city and river\\".Montreal in Evolution: Historical Analysis of the Development of Montreal's Architecture and Urban Environment. By Jean-Claude Marsan The McGillivrays were well known for their hospitality and kept open house at St. Antoine, as they had done before in their townhouse on St. Gabriel Street. Even his old rival John Jacob Astor came to dine there once a year on his annual trips to Montreal. The ballroom was said to be \\"an enchanting sight\\".The Higher Hill (1944). By Grace MacLennan & Grant Campbell In 1820, the English geologist, John Jeremiah Bigsby, was invited to a dinner at St. Antoine, which he described at great length in his entertaining book, The Shoe and Canoe: I had the pleasure of dining with the then great Amphictyon of Montreal at his seat, on a high terrace under the mountain, looking southwards and laid out in pleasure-grounds in the English style. The view from the drawing room windows of this large and beautiful mansion is extremely fine, too rich and fair, I foolishly thought, to be out of my native England. Close beneath you are scattered elegant country retreats embowered in plantations, succeeded by a crowd of orchards of delicious apples, spreading far to the right and left, and hedging in the glittering churches, hotels, and house-roofs of Montreal, Quebec... Mr McGillivray was accustomed to entertain the successive governors in their progresses, and was well entitled to such honour, not only from his princely fortune, but from his popularity, honesty of purpose, and intimate acquaintance with the true interests of the colony... My host was then a widower with two well-educated daughters. The company was various and consisted of a judge or two, some members of the Legislative Council and three or four retired partners of the North West Company of fur- traders (including David Thompson). Our dinner and wines were perfect. The conversation was fluent and sensible... It is hardly necessary to say that I passed a very agreeable evening. Our host was a large, handsome man, with the pleasant, successful look of the men of his habits and mode of life.

These can form a recombinant strain that co-exists with the strain from the initial infection, as well as the strain from the new virus, and may cause more rapid disease progression or carry multiple resistances to certain HIV medications. HIV superinfection may be interclade, where the second infecting virus is phylogenetically distinct from the initial virus, or intraclade, where the two strains are monophyletic. People with HIV risk superinfection by the same actions that would place a non-infected person at risk of acquiring HIV. These include sharing needles and forgoing condoms with HIV-positive sexual partners. Cases have been reported globally and studies have shown the incidence rate to be 0-7.7% per year. Research from Uganda published in 2012 indicates that HIV superinfection among HIV-infected individuals within a general population remains unknown. Further research from The Journal of Infectious Diseases indicates that there have been 16 documented cases of superinfection since 2002. \\"If a person is infected with a second virus before seroconversion to the first virus has taken place, it is termed a dual infection. Infection with a second strain after seroconversion is known as superinfection.\\"  Immunology  A study conducted in Kenya in 2007 shows that superinfection tends to occur during the course of the initial infection, that is during acute infection, or 1–5 years after initial infection, but not during the latency period. Thus, superinfection occurs after an immune response to the initial infection has already been established. It is unknown what aspects of the natural immune response to HIV may protect someone from superinfection, but it has been shown that cytotoxic lymphocyte responses do not seem to be protective. Immune responses to initial infection with a particular strain of HIV do not provide protection against superinfection with a different strain. The effect of neutralizing antibodies (NAb) is also unknown, but it has been shown that individuals with HIV tend not to have a NAb response prior to superinfection. In addition, it has been demonstrated that superinfection can occur in individuals that demonstrate a robust anti- HIV antibody response. The anti-HIV antibody response broadens and strengthens in individuals post-superinfection. The finding that superinfection occurs within and between HIV subtypes suggests that an immune response to initial HIV infection provide limited protection against infection by a new viral strain. This means that HIV-vaccine strategies made to replicate the host's immune response to HIV infection may not prevent new infections. Studies indicate that superinfection causes a spike in HIV viral load and a decrease in CD4+ cell count similar to those reported during primary HIV infection. Early studies of HIV superinfection analysed these spikes to diagnose cases of superinfection. It is unclear whether superinfection causes a sustained increase in viral load. The effect of superinfection on the progression of HIV infection is unclear because of its ambiguous effects on surrogate markers for the disease, such as an increase in viral load or a decrease in CD4 cell count. The potential of superinfection to cause rapid disease progression depends on viral and host factors. Cases of superinfection are yet to be identified in sufficient numbers to conduct detailed studies on the effect of superinfection on the host immune response.  Causes  HIV superinfection is distinct from HIV dual infection, where an individual is simultaneously infected with multiple distinct viral strains. HIV superinfection involves an individual with HIV being infected by a new, phylogenetically distinct HIV strain. Early reports of HIV superinfection were observed in cases of co- infection with HIV-1 and HIV-2. Studies have shown that a lack of neutralizing antibodies against HIV-1 infection predisposes patients to superinfection. Additionally, the tendency of HIV-1 virions to recombine when two subtypes infect a single cell increases its susceptibility to HIV superinfection. Further evidence of superinfection stems from the fact that nearly 10% of HIV-1 infections are associated with a transmittable recombinant strain. HIV-1 virions are divided into nine subtypes, all of which are characterized by different rates of disease progression, viral load and sensitivity to assays used in detection. When a single cell is infected by two HIV-1 subtypes, they recombine, forming a new, transmittable recombinant strain.  Mechanism  = Loss of immune control = Following initial acute HIV infection, CD8+ T-cells control viral replication and maintain it at a viral set point. Following superinfection, CD8+ T-cells lose control over replication and it deviates from the set point. The mechanism responsible for this is unknown. A weakened T-cell response against the initial virus enables the superinfecting strain to resist immune control, resulting in an increased replication rate and subsequent viremia. Increased viral load and a declining T-cell response enables the superinfecting strain to recombine rapidly, further decreasing immune control. = Recombination = HIV virions each contain a double- stranded RNA genome. When superinfection occurs, cells contain 2 different HIV strains. These can exchange genetic material such that an RNA strand from each strain is contained in a single virion. As this progeny virion infects new cells, the RNA template transcribed by viral reverse transcriptase changes, resulting in a reverse transcript with genetic material from both parental viruses. Recombination results in a rapid increase in HIV viral diversity, causing quicker adaptations to host immune response and resistance to ART. Recombination tends to produce two distinct recombinant forms, the presence of which are used as evidence of dual infection. The high prevalence of interclade recombinants increases the likelihood of superinfection being more widespread than reported.  Circulating recombinant forms  Circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) are mosaic viruses - recombinants with randomly assorted genetic material from phylogenetically distinct parental viruses. They spread geographically through human propagation, for example CRF02_AG, which is found in west and central Africa, as well as South America. CRF's account for 10% of HIV infections worldwide. There are 15 known CRFs, reported on 4 continents. More recombinants are likely to arise in regions with a growing HIV epidemic and where viral clades intersect, including Africa, Southeast Asia and South America.  Unique recombinant forms  Unique recombinant forms (URFs) are mosaic viruses that have not spread geographically. They are also reported in areas where multiple viral clades intersect. In 2004, a study by AIDS on sex workers in Nairobi, Kenya reported URF generation in a woman initially infected with clade A, and then 9 years later acquired clade C, which recombined with the initial infecting virus to form a recombinant of clades A and C that fully replaced the parental clade A virions.  Diagnosis  Initial reports solely documented interclade superinfection, where patients are infected by a virus of a different clade from the initial virus. This is because the viruses in initial cases were all subtypes of HIV-1, with at least a 30% difference in nucleotides in their envelope proteins that makes such superinfections easier to detect. Superinfection is identified by the detection of viral recombinants for phylogenetically distinct parent strains. Multiregion hybridisation assays are used to identify interclade superinfection by detecting genetic differences between parental and progeny strains. Heteroduplex mobility assays can be used to sequence viral genetic material, allowing the detection of samples with a genetic difference exceeding 1.5%. Bulk sequencing is used to amplify viral RNA to enable the identification of new phylogenetic species in a patient over time. However, this method is poor at detecting genetic differences at levels of 20% of lower. A third method, next-generation-sequencing assays, was developed in 2005. It enables the rapid sequencing and screening of genomes, detecting genetic differences of 1% or less. There are no known methods to estimate the timing of superinfection.  Prognosis  Studies on individuals with superinfection with 2 strains of HIV showed a poorer prognosis. Superinfection is correlated with a faster progression of the HIV infection. Patients in studies have displayed a shorter lag between seroconversion and experiencing an AIDS-defining clinical condition or death. However, it is unclear whether this rapid conversion is a direct effect of superinfection, or a result of a weaker immune response to the virus caused by superinfection.  Epidemiology  It is difficult to gain accurate estimations of the frequency of HIV superinfection because most studies are performed on patients infected with the HIV-1 B subtype, and recombinant strains are difficult to distinguish from the original strain for this subtype. HIV superinfection has been reported in the USA, Canada, Europe, Australia, Asia, and Africa. Data on the prevalence of superinfection has been gathered from case reports and observational studies, suggesting that it is underreported. Initial care reports and observational studies of superinfection were in men who have sex with men, intravenous drug users and female sex workers. Incidence in heterosexual populations was first reported in rural Africa. Incidence rates have been reported as 0% to 7.7% annually, although this varies across populations and depends on the frequency of antiretroviral drug use, the length of the follow-up period, and the method used to detect superinfection. However, a study in Uganda conducted using next-generation deep sequencing assays found that the rate of superinfection was large enough to be comparable to the primary HIV infection rate. Risk factors for superinfection are not clearly understood because of the small number of cases documented. However, the risk factors for primary infection are considered to apply to superinfection, including: * high number of sexual partners * limited condom use * no anti-retroviral use *detectable plasma viral load * absence of male circumcision * non-marital relationships The results of studies modeling the effect of HIV superinfection on viral recombination have suggested that superinfection has been instrumental in spurring community recombination rates. However, these studies were based on several epidemiological assumptions that are yet to be verified. These include assumptions about the pattern of HIV-1 transmission and that superinfection causes transmission to uninfected sexual partners.  History  1987 - First evidence of superinfection reported in studies of chimpanzees. 1991 - HIV-1 found to superinfect HIV-2-infected cells in a study through inducing infection in cells cultured from HIV patient samples. 1999 - In pig tailed macaques, a \\"window of susceptibility\\" demonstrated by showing that superinfection with a new viral strain was only possible after initial infection in macaques. 2002 - First definitive study on superinfection after cases reported in IV drug users in Bangkok, Thailand. The initial cases were all interclade superinfections. 2003 - Intraclade infection by an immune response to one strain of HIV-1 cannot prevent superinfection with a second virus from the same clade. 2005 - The ability of HIV superinfection to cause ART resistance.  Implications for treatment and care  = Drug resistance = Because of viral recombination, superinfection patients infected with at least one drug-resistant strain are likely to develop a mosaic recombinant strain with multi-drug resistance. This lowers the potential success of ART. Additionally, the existence of multiple strains of the virus in a host enhances interclade and intraclade recombination, accelerating global virus diversification for HIV. = Impact on vaccine development = Research on the development of an HIV-1 vaccine has sought to replicate virus-specific CD8+ T-cell responses, which play a role in the control of HIV-1 replication. Superinfection case reports have shown that superinfecting strains generally had different viral epitopes from the initial infecting cell. An immune response to the initial infection would, therefore, be ineffective against the super-infecting strain, leading to the proliferation of the superinfecting strain. An HIV-1 vaccine designed to recognize specific viral epitopes would be ineffective as it would not provide protection against HIV-1 viruses that do not share the same epitope. Such an ineffective vaccine could also lead to faster disease progression than in unvaccinated individuals. A successful vaccine would, therefore, have to incorporate viral epitopes derived from several viral subtypes. = Impact on clinical care = Increasing rates of antiretroviral therapy (ART) use have led to concerns about the development of drug-resistant strains which could be transmitted through superinfection. Individuals with drug-resistant strains are vulnerable to superinfection with a susceptible strain of the virus, reversing the effect of ART's the clinical aspects of HIV infection. Individuals with HIV were found to have a sudden increase in viral load, or a decrease in CD4 count should be tested for a resistant viral strain to identify the resistance profile of the secondary strain. Sexual practices, such as serosorting, place individuals with HIV infection at a higher risk of superinfection and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). HIV positive individuals engaging in unprotected sex with seroconcordant partners require counseling on the risks of superinfection and STDs, both of which are expressed more virulently because of immunosuppression in HIV patients. Counselling for HIV patients on the risk of HIV superinfection, and encouraging safe sexual and injection practices have shown an improvement in safer sexual practices, reducing the risk of superinfection.

A lecture tour in the USA lasted from 1916 to 1917 after which he was Swedish consul in Sumatra in 1920 among other postings and a study period in the US from 1921 to 1925.Mjöber, Eric Georg (1882–1938), in Musgrave, A., Bibliography of Australian Entomology, 1775–1930, Royal Zoological Society of New South Wales, Sydney, 1932, 380 pp. Australian expeditions In the early 1900s Mjöberg set off to the Kimberley region of Western Australia in an attempt to prove his Darwinian human evolution theory. What he did not know was that his expedition would have dire repercussions for years to follow for indigenous Australians, and for himself. In Western Australia, Mjöberg became obsessed with the Aboriginal people, and what started off as collecting native flora and fauna for research, soon led to the desecration of sacred burial grounds and the smuggling of human remains back to Sweden. Historians have described Mjöberg as aggressive, arrogant and devious, a leader who made enemies with local Aboriginal people, pastoralists and even his own scientific team. After 1911, he made a second expedition to Australia's east coast: Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, removing one set of remains from each. Controversy The 1915 publication of his diaries about the 1910 expedition exposed his unethical and illegal collection of material from Australia. Most of the material kept in Sweden's Museum of Ethnography was brought there between 1910 and 1911. Swedish anthropologist Claes Hallgren of Dalarna University wrote the book Two Travellers – Two Pictures of Australia, examining Mjoberg's methods, prompting an ethical debate that led the Swedish Government to contact the Australian authorities. Ninety years after their removal, his great-niece Lotte Mjöberg, a journalist in Stockholm, initiated the return of skeletons to the Aboriginal people in September 2004.\\"Beautiful and broken forever in the eyes of Eric Mjoberg\\" by Nicolas Rothwell, The Australian, 23 February 2013\\"Stolen remains coming home\\" by David King, The Australian 6 September 2004 Aboriginal elders travelled to Stockholm to receive the remains and start the process of spiritual healing. Spokesman for the Kimberley Aboriginal Law and Culture Centre, Neil Carter said: \\"The belief is that once a burial ground has been disturbed, the spirits and the country will not rest until the remains have been brought back.\\" Aborigines believe that the spirit of the departed cannot go on into the afterlife if the bones are disturbed. Eighteen boxes containing bones, believed to include the skeletons of two small children, were sent to the National Museum of Australia for identification before being interred at their traditional lands. Taking them without permission, Mjöberg passed them off as kangaroo bones to get them out of the country. His attitude was representative of the Social Darwinism of the times according to Dr Hallgren, who writes that the popular \\"Gothic Horror\\" presentation, and demonising Aborigines was the context and \\"justification\\" for Mjöberg's hunting for skeletons. It was designed to impress his audience of his work as an adventurer.Dr Claes Hallgren, Eric Mjöberg and the Rhetorics of Human Remains, abstract July 2005 Decline Mjöberg died in poverty in Stockholm after a long, undiagnosed illness during which he had constant nightmares reflecting his experiences in the Kimberleys, including a sense of being pursued by Aboriginal people and contact with the Wondjina – creation spirits of the Dreamtime. During this time he was forced to sell part of his collection. Despite his ill health he managed to write an account of this experience. In the Australian documentary Dark Science, an elder explains that the spirits give intruders a hard time, making them sick, but that Aboriginal people know ways to forestall these effects, and that outsiders do not.

Tanks! is an avant-garde music group, consisting of Gary Lightbody (of Snow Patrol) and producer Jacknife Lee, who has produced the last three albums for Snow Patrol, among others. The group's music is very different from Snow Patrol and has been termed \\"weird\\" by Lightbody. The group will visit Lee's home in January 2010 to record an album, after they finish working on another project Tired Pony. History Listen... Tanks! evolved after experiments in the studio between Gary Lighbody and Jacknife Lee. Lightbody has credited indie rock band Sunset Rubdown's second album Shut Up I Am Dreaming as inspiration to himself and Lee to start the project. Note: Gary Lightbody's official blog on the band website. Both Lightbody and Lee play all the instruments. The only known song by the group is \\"Black and Silver\\", which was premiered on BBC Radio 1 on 10 January 2007 by Lightbody himself, while he was guest presenting for Zane Lowe (who was on vacation) during the 2007 takeovers. The sound of the song was described by Hot Press as \\"heavily treated vocals and assorted electronic clicks and beeps\\". Note: Archived page, can be found here. NME described it as having a \\"heavily processed arrangement, pitching an ominous multi-tracked vocal backing against glockenspiels and Lightbody’s vocal\\". Lightbody himself sees the song as \\"a strange, little, dark, country, folkish beast.\\" Apart from \\"Black and Silver\\", more music has been recorded, whose direction has been branded by Lightbody as a \\"mad turn\\". In May 2009, Lightbody revealed plans of releasing material in an album called Listen Tank. He described the group's sound as \\"russian submarine music\\", explaining that the record utilizes a lot more voice than the guitar, the result sounding like a choir performing underwater. Due to the radical differences from typical Snow Patrol, he doesn't expect every fan to like it. Lightbody has taken a year-off from Snow Patrol to work on the project. Lightbody has hinted at the possible inclusion of a few guests on the record, but nothing has been confirmed. The duo will visit Lee's Los Angeles home in January 2010 to finish the album after they finish working on another Lightbody side-project, Tired Pony.

He is so far the only person in Željezničar history to have won league titles both as a player and as a manager. As a player he won the Yugoslav First League with Željezničar in 1972 and the First League of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1998. Club career Hadžiabdić started playing football in the youth teams of Iskra Bugojno and Bratstvo Travnik, before signing his first professional contract with Željezničar in 1965.

Many of these navvies as they were known were of Irish origin, hence the name given to the trains (see: Paddy). Once the main line was built the name passed to the workmen's specials, which in many cases, were operated along the main line railways and sometimes operated by the main line companies to an exchange point where the trains were taken over by the industrial company. In a time before the provision of pit-head baths it was illegal to travel in a normal service train in working clothes, so special trains were provided, usually of the railway company's most ancient coaches.

The members of the confraternity strive to pray the entire Holy Rosary weekly. History Dominican Order Coat of Arms There is insufficient evidence to establish the existence of any Rosary Confraternity before the last quarter of the fifteenth century. There were Dominican guilds or fraternities, but it is not known if they were connected with the Rosary. Through the preaching of Alanus de Rupe (Alan de la Roche) such associations began to be erected shortly before 1475.Thurston, Herbert. \\"Confraternity of the Holy Rosary.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 13. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 3 January 2015 One of the first was erected at Cologne in 1474 by Fr. James Sprenger.In the Plumpton Correspondence (ed. Thomas Stapleton, Camden Society, p. 50), a priest in London writes in 1486 to his patron in Yorkshire: \\"I send a paper of the Rosary of our Ladye of Coleyn and I have registered your name with both my Ladis names, as the paper expresses, and ye be acopled as brether and sisters.\\" Even at that time the entry of the name of each associate on the register was an indispensable condition of membership. The Perpetual Rosary is an organization for securing the continuous recitation of the Rosary by day and night among a number of associates who perform their allotted share at stated times. This is a development of the Rosary Confraternity, and dates from the seventeenth century. The Confraternity was last reorganized by Pope Leo XIII in 1898 with the Apostolic Constitution, Ubi Primum.\\"The Popes on the Rosary\\", Marian Library, University of Dayton Organisation This archconfraternity is under the administration of the Dominican order, as is the Confraternity of the Holy Name and The Confraternity of Angelic Warfare. Thus no new confraternity may be erected without the sanction of the Dominican Master General. In the \\"patent of erection\\", which is issued for each new confraternity by the General of the Dominicans, a clause is added granting to all members enrolled therein \\"a participation in all the good works which by the grace of God are performed throughout the world by the brethren and sisters of the said [Dominican] Order.\\" Throughout the world, the Archconfraternity is administered by the different Provinces of the Dominican order. In the United States, the Eastern Dominican Province (Province of St. Joseph) has its Confraternity based in Columbus, Ohio.\\"The Confraternity of the Most Holy Rosary\\", Dominican Friars, Province of St. Joseph The Rosary Confraternity of the Western Dominican Province (Province of the Holy Name of Jesus) is based in Portland, Oregon at their Rosary Center.The Rosary Confraternity Homepage The Rosary Confraternity is probably the largest organization of this type within the Catholic Church. Benefits and obligations Members of the Rosary Confraternity promise the recitation of a weekly Rosary as their sole obligation. This does not bind under pain of sin. Along with several plenary and partial indulgences that are granted to members of the Confraternity, members also believe they are benefited from the countless Rosaries that are offered for their intentions by the other members throughout the world. In addition, enrolled members also participate in all the prayers and good works performed by the friars, nuns, sisters, and laity of the Dominican Order. The Rosary Confraternity of the Dominican Province of the Most Holy Name of Jesus publishes Light and Life, a bi-monthly newsletter of the Rosary Confraternity of the Western Province.The Rosary Light and Life Newsletter, Official News Letter of the Rosary Confraternity =Indulgences= # For members of the Rosary Confraternity, a plenary indulgence, under the usual conditions, is granted: ## on the day of enrollment. (When application is made, a certificate of membership is sent, indicating the day of the enrollment.) ## on the following feast days: Christmas, Easter, Annunciation, Purification, Assumption, Our Lady of the Rosary, and Immaculate Conception. # For those who pray the Rosary, a plenary indulgence is granted under the usual conditions, when the Rosary is prayed in Church, or in a Public Oratory, in a family (family Rosary), Religious Community, or Pious Association. Otherwise a partial indulgence is granted.\\"Rosary Indulgences\\", The Rosary Center, Dominican Fathers, Province of the Most Holy Name of Jesus =Obligations= As a requirement of membership, each member of the Confraternity promises to pray fifteen decades of the Rosary each week and to include the other members of the Confraternity in their intentions. This is sole obligation of membership in Rosary Confraternity. It does not bind under pain of sin. Pope John Paul II, in his 2002 Apostolic Letter,The Apostolic Letter Rosarium Virginis Mariae added five optional mysteries to the rosary, which he gave the name, \\"Luminous Mysteries.\\" Since the new group of mysteries are in fact optional, they are, properly speaking, not an integral part of the Rosary of St. Dominic. The Rosary Confraternity does not require its members to recite the new Luminous Mysteries, and Rosarians who continue to recite the 15 mystery Dominican Rosary as received from the ecclesiastical tradition do fulfill their confraternity obligations. The 15 mystery rosary consists of the Joyful, Sorrowful & Glorious Mysteries.Obligations of members of the Rosary Confraternity Activities of the confraternity The \\"Perpetual Rosary\\" is an organization for securing the continuous recitation of the Rosary by day and night among a number of associates who perform their allotted share at stated times. This is a development of the Rosary Confraternity, and dates from the seventeenth century. It is continues in various convents which exist for the purpose as well as in lay society Dominican Life: Sisters of the perpetual Rosary The \\"Living Rosary\\" or \\"Association of the Living Rosary\\" was begun in 1826 by Pauline Marie Jaricot. While it is independent of the confraternity it is also under the administration of the Dominican Order and its goals coincide. It consists in a number of circles of fifteen members who each agree to recite a single decade every day and who thus complete the whole Rosary between them. In the year 1877, the pope Pius IX subjected all Associations of the Living Rosary to the general of the Dominican Order. However recently the care of the association has given to the local Bishops.The Living Rosary Because of the close relation of the Rosary to the Brown Scapular of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel and Our Lady of Fatima, Rosary confraternities are often closely tied to the Confraternity of the Brown Scapular and the Blue Army of Our Lady of Fatima whose goals are linked. In some parishes in the United States, the Confraternity of the Most Holy Rosary is also known as the Altar Rosary Society.  The Principal Rules Of The Confraternity of the Holy Rosary  Members should: # Have their names written in the register of the confraternity and, if possible, go to Confession and Communion and say the Rosary on the day they are enrolled. # Possess a blessed rosary. # Say the Rosary every day or at least once a week. # Whenever possible, go to Confession and Communion on the first Sunday of every month and take part in the Rosary processions. None of these rules binds under pain of sin.

Along with fellow activist Maya Evans, he was arrested on 25 October 2005 next to the Cenotaph war memorial in London, for refusing to cease reading aloud the names of civilians by then killed in Iraq in the course of the Iraq war. Rai was convicted under the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 (SOCPA) for organising an illegal demonstration in the vicinity of Parliament.  Political Views  Rai first became politically active in the campaign against Pershing II and Ground Launched Cruise Missiles - nuclear weapons scheduled to be deployed in Western Europe in the late 1980s. In December 2006, Rai and Evans lost an appeal against their convictions. For refusing to pay a fine of £350 (and £150 court costs), Rai was sent to Wandsworth prison in south London for 14 days on 23 August 2007. Police 'exaggerate demo numbers' \\"The human rights committee also heard from Milan Rai, who was jailed after he refused to pay a fine for demonstrating against the Iraq war near the Houses of Parliament without police permission....\\" BBC News, 22 October 2008. Retrieved 21 February 2013. This was his fourth prison sentence. Previous prison sentences (14 days in Pentonville in 1995, seven days in Wormwood Scrubs in 1996, and 28 days in Lewes in 2005) were all imposed for similar anti-war protests. Also taken into account in his 2007 sentencing was a further fine of £100, imposed for organising and participating in anti-war protests during the \\"No More Fallujahs\\" tent city demonstration in Parliament Square. Rai's fine for these offences was imposed in May 2007 - Maya Evans was his co-defendant. Evans is best known for being the first person to be convicted of participating in an unauthorized demonstration in the vicinity of Parliament under SOCPA. Rai was the first person to be convicted of organizing an unauthorized demonstration in the vicinity of Parliament. Evans and Rai were also, through their May 2007 convictions, the first people to be convicted in the same trial of organizing and participating in unauthorized demonstrations in the vicinity of Parliament - at different parts of the same two-day event. Their appeal against their SOCPA convictions is currently before the European Court of Human Rights (as of February 2009). As well as being a co-ordinator of anti-war group Justice Not Vengeance, Rai is co-editor with anti-war artist Emily Johns of the London-based monthly magazine Peace News. Their co-editorship began in March 2007. Rai was a Peace News seller while at school, selling copies to peace activist and poet Stephen Hancock, later a co-editor of the magazine. Rai's primary organizational affiliations have been with the British Ploughshares movement (1988–1993); ARROW (Active Resistance to the Roots of War; 1990–2003); the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND; 1992–1997); Voices in the Wilderness UK (1998–2003) Howard Clark, People Power:Unarmed Resistance and Global Solidarity, Pluto Press, 2009. (p. 230) and Justice Not Vengeance (2003–present). The Ploughshares movement is an international campaign of direct citizen disarmament of nuclear and other military equipment. ARROW was a London-based affinity group which organized mass actions and carried out a wide variety of campaigns, including a weekly vigil (1991–2003) against the economic sanctions - and then the impending war - on Iraq. CND is Europe's largest peace organization, devoted to British unilateral nuclear disarmament. Voices in the Wilderness UK, which Rai founded in 1998, a British arm of Voices in the Wilderness in the US, began life as a campaign of direct action against the economic sanctions on Iraq - breaking unjust laws by carrying children's medicines and other critical civilian goods to Iraq without an export licence. It developed a research function, and became an important part of the British anti-war scene. Justice Not Vengeance, which Rai co-founded in the aftermath of the 2003 invasion of Iraq, is an anti-war campaigning group dealing with an array of issues around the \\"war on terror\\".  Awards  Rai has been awarded the Frank Cousins Peace award from the Transport and General Workers' Union (shared, 1993), and the Peace Award of the Christian peace group Pax Christi (2007).

It was introduced by James Baker. SUS is a development of fitness proportionate selection (FPS) which exhibits no bias and minimal spread. Where FPS chooses several solutions from the population by repeated random sampling, SUS uses a single random value to sample all of the solutions by choosing them at evenly spaced intervals. This gives weaker members of the population (according to their fitness) a chance to be chosen. FPS can have bad performance when a member of the population has a really large fitness in comparison with other members. Using a comb-like ruler, SUS starts from a small random number, and chooses the next candidates from the rest of population remaining, not allowing the fittest members to saturate the candidate space. Described as an algorithm, pseudocode for SUS looks like: SUS(Population, N) F := total fitness of Population N := number of offspring to keep P := distance between the pointers (F/N) Start := random number between 0 and P Pointers := [Start + i*P  i in [0..(N-1) return RWS(Population,Pointers) RWS(Population, Points) Keep = [] for P in Points i := 0 while fitness sum of Population[0..i] < P i++ add Population[i] to Keep return Keep Where Population[0..i] is the set of individuals with array-index 0 to (and including) i. Here RWS() describes the bulk of fitness proportionate selection (also known as \\"roulette wheel selection\\") – in true fitness proportional selection the parameter Points is always a (sorted) list of random numbers from 0 to F.

It usually refers to migrations after Christopher Columbus' voyage to the Americas in 1492. For earlier Transatlantic crossings, see: Norse colonization of North America and Theory of Phoenician discovery of the Americas.  16th to 18th century  *The European colonization of the Americas—from 1836 to 1914, over 30 million Europeans migrated to the United States. *The Great Migration (Puritan) of English to North America, from 1650 onward. *The forced migration of Africans: See Slave trade and Atlantic slave trade *The Spanish colonization of the Americas  19th century onward  Among the various transatlantic migrations, the period of time between the mid-19th century to the early 20th century marks the “Age of Mass Migration” where 40% of U.S. population growth was due to the inflow of immigrants. Economic theory sought to explain, however, if immigrants were positively or negatively selected from the sending pool into the United States. Ingrid Semmingsen in her book, Norway to America: a History of the Migration, wrote “Many have asked if it was the more capable, the more enterprising and energetic persons who left, or if it was those who fell behind in the struggle for bread, the losers, the maladjusted, and the deviant” in reference to the composition of those who migrated into the United States. The Roy Model of comparative advantage suggests that where there are higher wages for skilled workers in one location, the most able will migrate to that country and earn that income. Moreover, if there are higher wages for unskilled workers in one location, the least able will leave their own country and migrate to earn that income. As a result of the improvements in transportation after the Industrial Revolution, long-distance migrations increased in the 19th century. For example, the duration of the Atlantic passage fell from 5 weeks (1725) to one week (1900). In addition, the length of indentured servitude necessary to pay for the fare decreased from 4 years to approximately 4 weeks, substantially decreasing one of the main deterrents for making the trek. Between 1846 and 1940, some 55 million migrants moved from Europe to America. 65% went to the United States. Other major receiving countries were Argentina, Canada, Brazil and Uruguay. Also, 2.5 million Asians migrated to the Americas, mostly to the Caribbean (where they worked as indentured servants in plantations) and some, notably the Japanese, to Brazil and the USA.

Skanstullsbron and Johanneshovsbron viewed from south-west in April 2006. Skanstullsbron (Swedish: \\"The Fortlet Tollgate Bridge\\") is a bridge in central Stockholm, Sweden. Overpassing the older bridge Skansbron, it connects the major island Södermalm to the southern district Johanneshov. The first proposal for an elevated bridge stretching over the canal Hammarbykanalen was produced in 1921, before work on the lower Skansbron bridge began in 1923. It remained the favoured bridge design to solve the increasing traffic load of the area during the 1920s and 1930s and was approved by the city council in 1939. World War II led to shortage of both finance and material, but work was started in 1944 and the new bridge was inaugurated in 1947. Skanstullsbron is a concrete double viaduct, with one bridge for vehicles and pedestrians and the other for the metro. Its total length is 574 metres of which 403 metres consists of the 16 spans of the southern beam bridge. The three central spans, 118, 112, and 106 metres long, offer a maximum horizontal clearance of 32 metres and a panoramic view of the surrounding city.

Early life Gely Abdel Rahman was born in Gez'irat Saay, or Saï (island), a small island in the Nile river in northern Sudan. Ethnically from Mahas Skoot, his father migrated to Egypt in the 1920s, where he worked in Royal Palaces as Guard or (Boaab) in Ansh'as Elramel (Elsharqeia Province). Gely came to Egypt with his mother when he was two years old. He has four sisters and three brothers. He began writing poems when he was 7. When he was nine years old, he learned the whole book of Qur'an by heart, for which he has been awarded a Royal prize. Gely joined Al-Azhar school in Cairo, where he completed his primary and secondary education. His life in Al-Azahar constituted Gely ideas about the oppression and the social inequity, when most of Al-Azahar students at that time (1940s) came from different African countries and resided in unhealthy accommodation conditions which led in many cases to students being afflicted by tuberculosis and dying because of that. Gely had been arrested when he contributed a student demonstration when he was a student in Al-Azhar. Career After finishing his secondary education, Gely while studying in Dar El Uloum worked as editor in one of the Egyptian newspapers. His work as editor corresponded with Gamal Abdel Nasser taking power in Egypt on 23 July 1952. Gely's first poem was published in 1953 in the El-massry news paper . Gely works as editor in El- Gamhoria Newspaper or The Republic, and also as an editor in El-massa, an art newspaper in 1955. Gely joined The Democracy Movement For National Liberation in Egypt in 1951 and continued his activities also with the Sudanese Communist Party from that time until he died in 1990. Gely migrated to former Soviet Union to complete his university studies in Moscow in 1964. He was granted a scholarship from African and Asian writers Union, so he joined Gorky Institute for Arts in Moscow. Gely received his master's degree in arts in 1969. After graduation, Gely worked as an editor at Moscow News newspaper and then as a lecturer at the Oriental Institute in Moscow. This institute is a part of Soviet Academic Science society. He has received a Ph.D. in Comparative Art Theory from Oriental Institute. He published much of his poetry while he had been in Moscow and also while living in Russia he had poetry published in different languages like English, Russian, and French. In 1977 he was invited to Aden University, where he worked as a lecturer in arts and in aesthetics, was awarded a professorship and spent seven years. In 1983, Gely moved to Algeria to teach at the Language and Art Institute at Algeria University, where he stayed until afflicted by Kidney failure in February 1989. He then moved to Egypt seeking a remedy. Gely Abdel Rahman died in August 1990 in Cairo after a surgical operation for a dialysis. He had been married to a Soviet woman named Malakhat Salmanova (Milla) who recently died in Switzerland, and had two daughters, Rena and Reem.

Due to his stature, many supporters affectionately nicknamed him \\"the fat goalie\\". Felgate had a long professional career from 1978 to 1995, making a total of 612 Football League appearances. Of the league appearances, 238 came with the Bolton Wanderers and he also turned out for league sides Rochdale, Crewe Alexandra, Lincoln City, Grimsby Town, Cardiff City, Chester City, and Wigan Athletic. He also had spells with Bury and Wolverhampton Wanderers without making any league appearances for these clubs, and Felgate later continued to play non-league football for clubs including Leigh RMI, Hyde United, and Bacup Borough until he was in his mid-40s. Felgate is perhaps best known for his performance in net for Leigh RMI against Fulham in the 1998/99 FA Cup at Craven Cottage. Non-league Leigh achieved a 1–1 draw against the southwest London side, and thereby attention of the British media. In particular, Felgate, who was then 38 years old, received widespread plaudits for his performance in the match, which prompted then-Fulham boss Kevin Keegan to declare that Felgate's goalkeeping was \\"the best I've ever seen at any level.\\" Felgate won a solitary full Welsh international cap in 1983, having earlier played for his nation's schoolboys team. The keeper came on as a substitution for the legendary Neville Southall in a friendly against Romania. Felgate would have had an additional international cap had Wales's scheduled match against Northern Ireland two years earlier in 1981 not been cancelled to Bobby Sands's hunger strike. After his retirement from playing, Felgate first acted as Manchester City's Academy Goalkeeping Coach and later became the assistant manager for the semi-professional Rossendale United club. He was then employed by Stockport County's as first team Goalkeeping Coach in League One. In January 2009 he left Stockport County to rejoin Manchester City as their academy goalkeeping coach.

The Type 3 Ho-Ni III superseded the Type 1 Ho- Ni I and its variant the Type 1 Ho-Ni II in production, and gave better protection to the crew due to having a completely enclosed superstructure. History and development Previous gun tanks, Type 1 Ho-Ni I and Type 2 Ho-I, were not really optimized designs. Type 1 Ho-Ni I used an open casemate with frontal and side armour only for the main gun, which made the crew vulnerable in close combat situations. The Type 2 Ho-I, despite its enclosed rotating turret, was armed with a low-velocity howitzer more suitable against gun emplacements and fortifications and required specialized shaped-charge warhead ammunition in tank destroyer roles. The fully enclosed and armored casemate of the Type 3 Ho-Ni III with the Type 3 75 mm tank gun was intended to address these issues, and an order of 57 was placed with Hitachi Ltd in early 1944. Production was hampered by material shortages, and by the bombing of Japan in World War II, and only 31 to 41 were completed by the time of the end of the war. Design Type 3 Chi-Nu tanks of the 4th Tank Division, with Type 3 Ho-Ni III self-propelled guns among them. The Type 3 Ho-Ni III utilized the chassis of the Type 97 Chi-Ha medium tank. The main armament of the Type 3 Ho-Ni III was a Type 3 75 mm tank gun, which was based on the 75 mm Type 90 Field Gun; the field gun itself was loosely based on the French Schneider et Cie Canon de 85 mle 1927. The Type 3 75 mm tank gun was also used in the Type 3 Chi-Nu medium tank. The Type 3 Ho-Ni III 75 mm main gun was mounted in a fully enclosed fighting compartment with its flanks protruding beyond the hull sides, giving the appearance of a gun turret although in reality it was incapable of rotation. There was no provision for secondary armament, and no front hull machine-gun. It had several hatches, including a large one which opened to the sides, which was fitted \\"in the rear plate\\" of the superstructure. Service record Although the Type 3 Ho-Ni III were assigned to various combat units, most were stationed within the Japanese home islands to defend against the projected Allied Invasion. As the surrender of Japan occurred before that invasion, there is no record of the Type 3 Ho-Ni III being used in actual combat.

Education Ivinskis studied at Telšiai and Plungė gymnasiums. In 1925 he entered the University of Lithuania to study philosophy, but later changed the subject to history. In 1929, Ivinskis received a grant to continue his studies in Germany. There, under the direction of prof. Albert Brackmann, he received a Ph.D. for his thesis Geschichte des Bauerstandes in Litauen () in 1932. In 1933 in Gdańsk he was habilitated for his work Lietuvių ir prūsų prekybiniai santykiai pirmojoje XVI a. pusėje (). After returning to Lithuania he was drafted into the army. During his free time, he gave lectures at the Vytautas Magnus University and in 1940 became an extraordinary professor. In that year he was invited to work at the Vilnius University. He served as the dean of Faculty of Theology–Philosophy at the Vytautas Magnus University from 1941 to 1942. For his active public defense of university autonomy, the Nazis listed him among other prominent public figures to be transferred to Stutthof concentration camp. Ivinskis was saved from death because he was ill, and was hospitalized for half a year. Emigration In 1944, Ivinskis retreated to the West. Unlike most other Lithuanian refugees, he did not emigrate to the United States and chose to live in Germany. He gave lectures as Gastprofessor at Baltisches Forchungsinstitut in Bonn, and from 1963 taught the history of Eastern Europe at Bonn University.

Originally, and in later poorly constructed walls, the rubble was not consolidated. Later, mortar and cement were used to consolidate the core rubble and produce sturdier construction. Modern masonry still uses core and veneer walls; however, the core is now generally concrete block instead of rubble, and moisture barriers are included. Often such walls end up as cavity walls by the inclusion of space between the external veneer and the core in order to provide for moisture and thermal control. History =Greeks and Phoenicians= Both the early Phoenicians and Greeks used rubble-filled masonry walls. The word emplekton was borrowed from Greek ἔμπλεκτον and originally meant \\"rubble\\" but came to apply to the construction technique as well. =Romans= The Romans started with basic emplekton masonry walls, but developed the technique one step further using temporary walls (forms), that were removed after the cemented rubble (concrete) had cured. This Roman technique was called opus caementicium, and eventually led to modern ferroconcrete construction. =India= The buildings of the Taj Mahal are constructed with walls of brick and rubble inner cores faced with either marble or sandstone locked together with iron dowels and clamps. Some of the walls of the mausoleum are several metres thick. =Ancestral Puebloans= Chacoan Masonry types by Stephen H. Lekson In the large complexes at Chaco Canyon, the Ancestral Puebloans used the wall and rubble technique, with walls of carefully shaped sandstone. The Ancestral Puebloans used mud as their mortar, both with the veneer and to consolidate the core. This core and veneer technique was also used at other Ancestral Puebloans sites outside of Chaco Canyon. Later pueblos used mud bricks (adobe) for the veneer. =Mayan= In the Puuc region, and as far south as at least Tikal, the Mayans developed core-and-veneer walls to the point where, by the classic period, they were filled with concrete. Problems Traditional core-and-veneer walls suffered from moisture migration and thermal expansion and contraction. They had a low tensile strength, hence a poor resistance to twisting or stretching. Tensile strength was increased by increasing the width of the walls or by providing masonry \\"piers\\" (vertical columns or ribs), either inside the wall or as additional exterior support.

He was re-elected Governor in early 2017 after serving an earlier term between 2006 and 2012. Irwandi first won a term as governor in the 2006 Aceh regional election as an independent candidate (non-party). Muhammad Nazar, S. Ag. was his running mate in 2006. However Irwandi lost his 2012 re-election campaign to Zaini Abdullah following a strong challenge and intensive campaigning by other local political rivals. Allegations that he may have wrongfully granted land concessions involving previously protected high conservation value land to palm oil companies also surfaced before the campaign. In 2017, he was reelected as the Governor of Aceh, with Nova Iriansyah as his partner.Irwandi Yusuf Returns Aceh Governor - Jakarta Post - 8 April 2017. In 2018, the former Free Aceh Movement ( (GAM) leader was the second Aceh governor implicated in a corruption case after Abdullah Puteh, who was sentenced to 10 years for graft surrounding the procurement of an MI-2 Rostov helicopter worth US$872,500. Irwandi was arrested along with Bener Meriah Regent Ahmadi and eight other individuals on corruption charges. On April 8, 2019, Yusuf was sentenced to seven years in prison for accepting bribes from Ahmadi totaling Rp 1.05 billion (US$74,084) in exchange for granting number of infrastructure projects in the regency. He was also found to have accepted Rp 8.7 billion in gratuities from businessmen during his two terms as governor. Biography Irwandi Yusuf, a veterinarian (Alumnus of Syiah Kuala University, Banda Aceh), joined the Free Aceh Movement in 1990, participating for three years before taking up a scholarship at Oregon State University, US, in 1993, where he undertook a master's degree in Veterinary Science. After returning to Banda Aceh to teach at his alma mater, Irwandi became a founding member of the Acehnese branch of the Fauna and Flora Preservation Society (now known as Fauna and Flora International), lending his veterinary expertise to their conservation campaigns. Political career In 2018, the former Free Aceh Movement leader was the second Aceh governor implicated in a corruption case after Abdullah Puteh, who was sentenced to 10 years for graft surrounding the procurement of an MI-2 Rostov helicopter worth US$872,500. Irwandi was arrested along with Bener Meriah Regent Ahmadi and eight other individuals following a suspicious transaction involving provincial and regency officials, according to the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK). Since Irwandi was caught red-handed by the KPK, he started to lose supports from Acehnese people. In the past, his concern for Acehnese socio-political issues led him into further contact with the Free Aceh Movement. He held several different positions in the movement, including as a special staff office for psychological warfare in the Central Free Aceh Movement command, as negotiation coordinator, and as Expert Staff on counter-intelligence in the Central Command of the Aceh National Army. He spent some time in 2001 with the Red Cross, taking the opportunity to study humanitarian law. Irwandi was arrested in 2003 and interned in the Keudah Prison in Banda Aceh. Irwandi was in his jail cell when the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake struck. The epicenter of the quake was close to the Acehnese coastline. The population of Aceh before the December 2004 tsunami was 4,271,000, and as of 15 September 2005 was 4,031,589; a discrepancy of 239,411 lives. 170,000 people were confirmed dead. As the tsunami's waters rose inside the prison, Irwandi fled to the Musholla (prayer room) on the second floor while walls crumbled around him. His only means of escape was to punch a hole through the asbestos ceiling, scramble onto the roof, and hang on until the tsunami abated. Out of the prison population of 278, Irwandi was one of just 40 survivors.Seth Mydans, 'A Rebel-Turned-Governor Takes the Wheel in Indonesia', The New York Times, 14 April 2007. In the aftermath of the tsunami, the Free Aceh Movement and the Indonesian central command negotiated a peace settlement, and Irwandi renounced his separatist agenda. No longer in conflict with the Indonesian government, the former rebel liaised with the international non-governmental organizations whose presence paved the way for Aceh's first democratic election in almost 30 years. It was a major victory for Irwandi, who won 39.3% of the popular vote, as announced by Public Issue Network and Indonesian Survey Circle. He took office on 8 February 2007 and established a normal relationship with the army that once pursued him as a Free Aceh Movement rebel. In an unusual move for a former revolutionary, he kept much of the old administration in place although he also moved to reform a range of positions in the senior ranks of the provincial public service. In a 2007 New York Times interview, Irwandi said, \\"I tell them, 'I believe, I trust you all. You are all trustworthy until you prove otherwise. Then I will know.'\\" In the same interview, he remarked that his former enemies in the cabinet were welcome to 'rock and roll' with him – \\"Rock and roll... That means to do something new, rocky, that was never felt before. It is spirit. Spirited people. Young blood. Young spirit.\\"Seth Mydans, op. cit. His first term expired on 8 February 2012, and later he lost his reelection run against Zaini Abdullah. In July 2018, he was arrested by the Corruption Eradication Commission, after allegedly having been caught red-handed receiving bribes. Environmental issues One of Irwandi's declared priorities was the protection of Aceh's magnificent rainforest. \\"This is my obsession, since a long time ago – that Aceh is Aceh, and the forests of Aceh need to be kept well.\\" His first step as a green governor was to embrace the establishment of carbon trading in Aceh using the REDD mechanism, (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation) to reinvigorate the faltering economy and prevent further destruction of Aceh's rainforests.Merrill Lynch invests $9M in rainforest conservation, expects profit Irwandi declared a moratorium on all logging in Aceh in March 2007, and personally drove out to villages to conduct spot inspections of former logging camps, encouraging the locals to take up sustainable new professions. However, in 2011, Irwandi's apparent pro-environmental efforts were abruptly halted and reversed. He allegedly surprised supporters when information was uncovered that, on 25 August 2011, he had quietly granted a concession to palm oil supplier PT Kallista Alam which authorised the destruction of a peat swamp forest that is one of the last refuges of the critically endangered Sumatran orangutan.Michael Bachelard, ' Credits lost in tangle of Aceh's forest', The Sydney Morning Herald, 9 June 2012. Some of the indigenous peoples took the about-face from the so-called 'Green Governor' personally, calling it a betrayal of their homeland and of his previous environmental credentials. On a legal level, though, many environmental organisations argued that Irwandi's decision breached a presidential moratorium – part of an international deal to save Indonesia's forests – as well as legislation protecting a conservation area where the Tripa swamp is located. Litigation was filed by environmental groups known as WAHLI, challenging the legality of this concession and contending it was granted in an area of protected forest and further violated a moratorium on peatlands conversion.Fakhrururradzie Gade, 'Irwandi Yusuf, Indonesia's 'Green Governor', Allows Prime Jungle to be Cleared for Palm Oil', Huff Post Green, 9 December 2011 On 27 March 2012, on the eve of the WAHLI case being heard in court, over seventy illegally set fires mysteriously broke out in this protected Tripa swamp area, including fires set in the oil palm concession granted by Irwandi to PT. Kallista Alam. Many involved with the WAHLI litigation believed the fires were set in direct defiance of the pending litigation, in effect ignoring any eventual ruling on the alleged legality of Irwandi's granted concession. Mainstream media outlets and environmental organisations report that these fires could lead to the imminent and immediate extinction of the animal inhabitants of the Tripa swamp, including over 200 orangutans. On 3 April 2012, the Council of Judges of the Banda Aceh National Administrative Court dismissed the WALHI case on jurisdictional grounds. WALHI was expected to appeal.Michael Bachelard, 'Indonesian court backs palm oil company over orangutans and carbon storage', The Sydney Morning Herald, 4 April 2012 The court acknowledged that the permit that Irwandi approved allowing PT Kallista Allam to convert the Tripa peat swamp into palm oil plantations was indeed located inside the protected Leuser Ecosystem and thus in violation of current Indonesian law. Some legal observers considered the lack of a decision by the court as a case of inappropriate behaviour because it refused to reach a ruling even though the case had been running for nearly five months. Irwandi had spoken out amid the considerable attention that emerged in the wake of the Tripa peat swamp fires and the WALHI litigation. In reports on 5 April 2012, Irwandi claimed that the land grant, while legal, was 'immoral' yet intended by him to bring world attention to global inability to tackle global climate change, in effect destroying the Tripa forests to save them.Michael Bachelard, 'Former Aceh chief denies orangutans died in burn', The Age, 6 April 2012. Irwandi was quoted as saying, \\"That concession, 1,600 hectares, was like a pinch to the international community. Maybe I will make a threat to lift the moratorium [entirely] to make them look at Aceh.\\"ibid. He also denied that any orangutans had died in the fires despite evidence to the contrary.ibid. Later, after Irwandi had left office, the apparent over- exploitation of the Tripa forest area continued to attract comment. In July 2012 it was reported that officials from the national Environment Ministry who visited the Tripa area said that there were 'strong indications' that deliberate burning had been taking place in the region to convert the area to an oil palm plantation,Sita W. Dewi, 'Environment: Graft suspected in palm oil conversion', The Jakarta Post, 10 July 2012. On 30 August 2012, judges of the Higher Administrative Court in Medan granted the WAHLI appeal, casting further doubt on Yusuf's one-time claims to be the \\"Green Governor.\\" The ruling contained among other things: 1) the granting of the WALHI appeal; 2)cancellation of the contested Tripa license issued by the Governor of Aceh (then Yusuf) on 25 August 2011; 3) an order to the current governor of Aceh to withdraw the contested State Administrative Decision issued by Yusuf on the plantation permit to PT. Kalista Alam issued on 25 August 2011; 4) and an order that the Defendants jointly cover the cost of both court process. Aceh election in 2012 On 9 April 2012 Irwandi lost the re-election campaign that would have allowed him to continue as governor of Aceh. Irwandi claimed voter fraud and voter intimidation was the cause of his loss.Hotli Simandjuntak and Nani Afrida, 'Irwandi claims foul play during poll, plans court date', The Jakarta Post, 11 April 2012. Zaini Abdullah, the new governor of Aceh elected to replace Irwandi, took office on 25 June 2012. Zaini, then 72, was the former Free Aceh Movement foreign minister in exile in Sweden before the signing of the 2005 Indonesian government-Free Aceh Movement peace agreement in Helsinki. Deputy Governor Muzakir Manaf, then 48, was the former commander of the Free Aceh Movement's Armed Wing. Despite a guarantee from incoming deputy governor Muzakir Manaf that Irwandi's safety would be guaranteed if he attended the inauguration of the new provincial government in June 2012, following the event Irwandi was surrounded and beaten about the face and head by uniformed Aceh Party supporters. He was accused of being a traitor to the Free Aceh Movement, the Acehnese militia, because of his negotiations and compromises with the Indonesian government. Irwandi's own governorship campaign in 2006 had been as an independent candidate, not with his former rebel comrades, a fact exploited by the Aceh Party (PA) during the 2012 election campaign to sway popular opinion in their direction. Irwandi stated that the PA's propaganda implying that he betrayed the Free Aceh Movement was the cause of the attack by party supporters. Only one arrest was made.Farouk Arnas, 'Aceh's Ex-Governor Irwandi Fears for Safety after Assault' , The Jakarta Globa, 1 July 2012.

The moving force behind the bill was probably Mr Secretary, Robert Cecil who wrote his policy in Notes for the Parliament on the basis of a speech to be made on November 5. The Ninth Parliament of Elizabeth's reign had opened on October 24, 1597, and it promised to be one of its most productive. Cecil was concerned that the dearth of corn, high prices, rising homelessness, and \\"the lamentable cry of the poor, who are like to perish\\" was causing considerable distress, riot and even rebellion: in London alone there were an estimated 10,000 vagabonds; and 2,000 in Norwich.F G Emmison, Elizabethan Life: Disorder, (Essex County Council, 1970) p.200-202 During 1597 the harvest failed causing widespread suffering and hardship: many thousands were made unemployed by the enclosures which compounded the effects of the famine. One MP Sir Francis Hastings defined the term 'vagabond' and called for them to be arrested, whipped and returned to their place of origin where they would be set to work in a House of Correction.Gillian Maitland, \\"Sixteenth Century Poverty And Elizabethan Legislation\\", unpublished, Worcester College of Education, p.64 Despite local variations in provision, vagrancy continued to be a national problem. Cecil promoted the three bills to follow, supported mainly by Puritans. However a majority of the gentry in the Commons rebelled against the social measures; one of these was the flamboyant Sir Walter Raleigh.J.E.Neale, Elizabeth I: and her Parliaments 1584-1601, Jonathan Cape, London, 1957, p.348-349 On 22 November 1597, Chairman of the Grand Committee, Sir Robert Wroth, seconded by Henry Finch, both Puritans three of the greatest pieces of Elizabethan legislation. In December the bill was read for a second time (secunda vice) before being kicked upstairs to the Lords. In Grand Committee it received many amendments, and likewise from the Lords. The bill caused considerable debate in both houses. However the two houses could not agree how categories of prisoner were to be described. On the third reading in the Commons the bill was rejected on a division by 106 votes to 66. Under Elizabethan procedure, the Lords drafted a compromise bill which passed both houses with ease.Sir Simond D'Ewes, Lords Journal, vol.ii, pp.203-220. It introduced penal transportation as a punishment for the first time. During the reign of Henry VIII, it has been estimated that 72,000 people were executed.1911 Encyclopædia Britannica, Capital punishment With the establishment of settlements in North America, an alternative practice (seemingly borrowed from Spain) began of a reprieve of the death sentence should the condemned person consent to be transported to an American colony, and be entered into bond service. However, it is probable that this part of the legislation was never put into force.Sources in the National Archives for research into the transportation of Irish convicts to Australia (1791-1853) : Introduction Another effect of the Act was to lessen the severity of a punishment meted out to strolling players imposed under a 1572 act wherein \\"all fencers, bearwards, common players of interludes, and minstrels (not belonging to any baron of this realm, or to any other honourable person of greater degree),\\" wandering abroad without the license of two justices at the least, were subject \\"to be grievously whipped and burned through the gristle of the right ear with a hot iron of the compass of an inch about.\\" '1911 Encyclopædia Britannica, Theatre The Relief of the Parish Poor remained in force down to 20th Century, the third act to pass in 1597 was an Act to erect Hospitals and 'working houses for the poor' that became the basis for the Victorian workhouse system; and another was the Act for \\"the punishment of rogues, vagabonds and sturdy beggars\\". Rogues who escaped were arrested, branded and then returned to the House of Correction until the 'governor' could decide when to obtain their release. Since many vagabonds took refuge in these areas, the main change brought in by the act at Clause 3 was the stipulation that vagrants or 'sturdy beggars' should be sent back to their place of origin. They were viewed by Parliament essentially as being migrants, and therefore should be returned from whence they came.Slack, p.360, 376 n4. The act required every parish to keep a record of every resident, including potential vagrants, who might go wandering across the realm. Unfortunately most of this information was only available in the larger cities. The paucity of quality record-keeping meant it was difficult to interpret how population increases reflected upon rising vagrancy rates during 'The Dearth' of 1590s. The act insisted the \\"wandering\\" and \\"loitering\\" was designated into two social groups of unskilled poor and unemployed economic migrants: however as no person was forced to \\"wander\\" it was thus interpreted as falling hardest on the poorest.Vagrancy Act (Acts of the Privy Council, 1597-8, pp. 388-91596-7, x629-30, and 1647-8 were years of high grain prices. These acts were lasting testaments to Elizabethan religious radicalism that were among the most profound of the many reforms of the period. These were violent times. There were riots and plague in London in 1592, and then in 1596 an armed uprising in Oxfordshire. The Queen's fears and apprehensions were exaggerated by the enclosure acts that drove sheep onto the land, and peasants off it, as described to her by John Manwood in his treatise A Brefe Collection of the Lawes of the Forest (1592); they circumscribed the royal prerogative. The Midland counties of thick afforested areas, such as the Forest of Arden were more disorderly, unruly and more likely to have livestock than the lowland arable areas. The poor would \\"dwell in woods ...like drones devoted to thievery,\\" whereas \\"the forests, if inclosed, would be more secure for travellers,...and more beneficial for the Commonwealth.\\"Christopher Hill, The World Turned Upside Down: Radical Ideas during the English Revolution (New York: Viking, 1975, p. 41.Philip Pettit, The Royal Forests of Northamptonshire: A Study in their Economy, 1558-1714 Gateshead: Northumberland Press, 1968, p.133. The difference gave rise to David Underdown's 'chalk and cheese' description citing immigration, price instability, dearth, and social instability as main factors leading to vagabondage and vagrancy among the lower orders driving out by informal rough justice. The cow pasturage thus represented a border area with woodlands of lawlessness and violence. Marxist historians Christopher Hill and Sharp, have argued that the violence was syptomatic of organized angry resistance mobilised in the iron founding areas, turning out weaponry from secret 'hideaways'. They have contended that far from passive acceptance of their starving condition, the poor sought to fight back against the callous landlords. The foresters were \\"addicted to crime and violence - all rogues.\\"As You Like It and the Enclosure Riots, p.9 Irish vagrants travelled in bands like a circus, and often assumed the title \\"gypsies\\" which was affected. There is little evidence of gangs of aggressive beggars roaming Elizabethan England, except in as much as \\"gentlemen of the road\\" and other soubriquet are mentioned in Shakespeare's legendary works. Informative though it was, much of the literature was based on the romanticism of the Robin Hood, as the lawless vagabond and thief. In one clause beggars were punished for 'subtle crafts' proscribing palmistry, fortune-telling, minstrelling or unlicensed acting, most often associated with illiterate itinerant communities. By contrast the English tended to travel in ones and twos frequenting along the way at familiar haunts, such as a refreshment house, barn, or lodging-house. No Gaming was allowed and the Innkeepers were expected to keep a good house. The Quarter Sessions were a binding cognizance against \\"harbouring rogues, vagabonds and others without passports.\\"Emmison, p.203. Typically, young adults, predominantly men, either looking for work or engaged in petty crime. Officials prescribed that they \\"deserved to be whipped or stocked\\" as a punishment for transgressions.P.R.O. SP i6/388/7(xxiv, xxxvii), TNA Those that were not punished were integrated into town life \\"to save the town harmless.\\" Towns suffered from relatively high mortality rates, and so new 'blood' was always welcomed to boost numbers.Slack, p.367 By the Jacobean Parliament of 1610 it was noted that \\"thieves, rogues and beggars\\" had threatened local populations by coming out of the woods, from whence they had earlier taken refuge in times of The Dearth. The act also made those listed in several categories liable for impressment in the service of the fleet. Jacobean statute reversed the requirement to send people home, perhaps in recognition of a New World circumstance in which Transportation helped to satisfy demands for colonists. Indeed, Australian law has traced the origins of the commutation of labour to Macquarie Harbour down to the 1597 act and a Privy Council decision of 1602. When “lesser offenders adjudged by law to die” [to] be punished instead in a manner that will correct them “and yield a profitable service to the Commonwealth in parts abroad...”. The Vagabond Act 1597 was repealed by section 28 of the Vagrants Act 1713.

Large-scale conventional warfare occurred in the Gaza Strip, starting on 28 June 2006, which was the first major ground operation in the Gaza Strip since Israel's unilateral disengagement plan was implemented between August and September 2005.

Background  In 2005, Israel's unilateral disengagement plan saw it pulling forces out of Gaza and dismantling Jewish settlements that had been built in the territory in the years of the occupation. Israel remained in control of Gaza's borders, coastline and airspace, with the exception of the southern border which continues to be supervised by Egypt and European Union monitors. Following disengagement in 2005, Qassam rockets continued to be fired out of Gaza into Israel, and the pace of the attacks quickened in 2006 following the victory of the Islamist group Hamas in the Palestinian legislative elections of early 2006. 757 missiles hit Israel between disengagement and the end of June 2006 and Israel responded with artillery fire and airstrikes. Between the end of March 2006 – when the Hamas government assumed power – and the end of May 2006, Israel fired at least 5,100 artillery shells into the Gaza Strip Qassam launching areas in an attempt to stop them being fired. Hamas had announced a ceasefire in 2005 and until 10 June 2006, Hamas did not take responsibility itself for the firing of ordnance into Israel, but the group's leader said in February that it wouldn't impede other groups from carrying out \\"armed resistance\\" against Israel. This was a significant statement because Israel had often pressured the Palestinian government to stop such attacks in the past, and Palestinian willingness to do so had been seen as a key indicator of intent by Israel. However, Hamas was implicated in rocket attacks and attacks carried out by other groups, as well as engaging in its own attacks, despite the ceasefire.Hamas Must End Attacks Against Civilians, Human Rights Watch, June 8, 2005 The political context of this exchange of fire was an internal struggle in the Palestinian territories between Hamas and the old ruling party, Fatah. Fatah members and supporters predominated in the Palestinian security forces and the civil service and Hamas complained that they were hampering the new government's capability to function. Violent protests, clashes and attempted assassinations mounted during 2006.Palestinians, Israel and the Quartet: Pulling Back from the Brink, International Crisis Group Meanwhile, because Hamas refused to recognize Israel's right to exist or reaffirm its commitment to previous agreements between the Palestinian Authority and Israel, the Israeli government and the Quartet (the EU, the UK, the US and Russia) imposed an economic embargo on the Hamas government. * On June 8 Israel resumed its policy of the extrajudicial killing of key Hamas leaders, with the IDF assassination of Jamal Abu Samhadana, founder of the Popular Resistance Committees, which regularly launches home-made rockets into Israel. The Israeli military said Samhadana and the other targeted militants were planning an attack on Israel. The policy of targeted killings had ceased with the February 2005 Israeli-PA ceasefire agreement, which Hamas had also pledged to observe. Samhadana had been appointed the Palestinian Interior and National Security Ministry of the PNA's new Hamas-led government on April 20, 2006, a position similar to the ministry's director-general. * In response to Samhadana's assassination, Palestinians in the Gaza Strip fired two rockets into Israel hours after his death, hitting a building in the southern town of Sderot, but causing no casualties. * On June 9, Israel responded to the rocket fire with a bombardment of launching sites. During this campaign an explosion occurred on a busy Gaza beach, killing eight Palestinian civilians belonging to one family. Following the blast, an internal Israel Defense Forces (IDF) enquiry was initiated. On June 13, Israeli Defence Minister Amir Peretz and Chief of Staff Dan Halutz appeared alongside IDF General Meir Klifi to announce the findings of the enquiry, stating \\"The chances that artillery fire hit that area at that time are nil.\\" In further interviews, Klifi theorised that the deaths could have been caused by old ordnance or by a Palestinian planted mine. In contrast a Human Rights Watch (HRW) investigation found that \\"the evidence we have gathered strongly suggests Israeli artillery fire was to blame\\". According to Mark Garlasco, the head HRW investigator, contentious issues was that the injuries sustained by the Palestinian victims were inconsistent with either a typical mine or an explosion from beneath the sand. Israel acknowledged that it had been shelling 250 m away from the family's location. Palestinians claimed that the explosion was caused by this Israeli shelling.\\"CHRONOLOGY-Key events since Hamas rose to power\\", Reuters, July 4, 2006Gaza Beach Libel Der Krieg der Bilder , Süddeutsche Zeitung, June 16, 2006 * On June 10, Hamas formally withdrew from its 16-month ceasefire, and began openly taking responsibility for the ongoing Qassam rocket attacks. * On June 13, Israel killed 11 Palestinians in a missile strike on a van carrying Palestinian militants and rockets in Gaza. Among those killed were nine civilian bystanders. Reuters called this \\"the deadliest such attack in four years\\". * On June 20, Israel killed 3 Palestinian civilians in a missile strike on a car in Gaza's Jabaliya refugee camp. * On June 24, Israeli commandos entered the Gaza Strip and captured Osama and Mustafa Muamar, whom Israel claimed were Hamas militants. Hamas claimed that they were the sons of a Hamas supporter but not Hamas members themselves. It was Israel's first raid into the Strip since its forces pulled out of Gaza in September 2005.\\"Noam Chomsky interview regarding Gaza and Lebanon\\" , Democracy Now!, July 14, 2006 * On June 25, armed Palestinians crossed the border from the Gaza Strip into Israel via a makeshift tunnel and attacked an IDF post. During the morning attack, two Palestinian militants and two IDF soldiers were killed and four others wounded. The Palestinians captured Corporal Gilad Shalit, who suffered a broken left hand and a light shoulder wound. Hamas claimed that the attack was carried out in response to June 9 killings, but the IDF concluded that the digging of the tunnel must have taken between 3 and 6 months.Gil Hoffman et al., \\"Shalit's health better than first feared\\", Jerusalem Post, June 29, 2006 * On June 26, Shalit's captors issued a series of statements demanding the release of all female Palestinian prisoners and all Palestinian prisoners under the age of 18. The statements came from Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades (the military wing of Palestinian governing party Hamas), the Popular Resistance Committees (which includes members of Fatah, Islamic Jihad and Hamas), and the Army of Islam. More than 8,000 Palestinians were being held as prisoners by Israel. Approximately two-thirds of these prisoners were convicted in court, while around ten percent were held without charge.B'Tselem, Statistics on Palestinians in the custody of the Israeli security forces * On June 29, the IDF issued a summary of activity in the Gaza Strip: > Early this morning, July 29, 2006, the IDF began engineering work in the > Erez industrial area in the northern Gaza Strip in order to thwart terror > threats and to discover tunnels and explosive devices in area. In addition, > the IDF carried out aerial attacks against a structure used by Hamas to > store and manufacture weaponry in Gaza City, as well as a tunnel located > along the Israeli-Egyptian border near Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip. > Prior to the attacks on these targets, in order to ensure the safety of the > residents of the Gaza Strip, the IDF warned the population not to stay in > structures that are used by terrorist organizations for storing weapons. > Terrorist organizations operate from within civilian population, while > cynically exploiting uninvolved civilians and using them as human shields, > exploiting their homes to store weapons and launch rockets at Israeli towns > from populated areas. The IDF will continue to act with determination > against terrorist organizations and terror infrastructure in order to create > the conditions for the return of Corporal Gilad Shalit and to stop terror > attacks and the launching of missiles against Israel. Timeline = Naval closure = On June 26, the Israeli Navy imposed a naval closure of the Gaza Strip, to prevent Shalit being smuggled out by sea. The navy increased patrols of naval vessels along the Gaza coastline, and prepared for an attempt to smuggle Shalit out by boat, sending instructions to captains. Palestinian fast boats were banned from operating in the area, and only small Palestinian fishing boats were allowed on the sea. = IDF enters Southern Gaza = Israeli forces entered Khan Yunis on June 28, 2006 in search for Shalit. Four Israeli F-16s flew over the Latakia residence of Bashar Assad, President of Syria, in a symbolic move linked by the IDF spokesperson to Israel's view of the Syrian leadership as a sponsor of terrorism, and the presence in Syria of Hamas leader Khaled Mashal. In preparation for the Israeli operation, the government of Egypt announced it deployed 2,500 policemen to the Egypt-Gaza Strip border to prevent the possible transfer of Shalit into Egypt, as well as to prevent an influx of refugees out of the Strip. In the early hours of the operation, several Palestinian civilian locations were targeted. Bridges were destroyed that effectively cut the Gaza Strip in half. Power was also cut to 65% of the Gaza Strip after Israeli planes fired at least nine missiles at Gaza's only power station. Israeli forces also occupied the Gaza International Airport. Airstrikes were carried out on Hamas training and munitions camps, though no casualties were reported. In apparent response, the Popular Resistance Committees announced they had abducted an 18-year-old man from the West Bank settlement of Itamar, Eliyahu Asheri, and would kill him if the invasion continued. On June 29, IDF combat engineers and Shabak agents, acting on intelligence, found Asheri's body in an abandoned car in an open field outside of Ramallah. The youth appeared to have been shot to death, and findings indicated that he may have been killed as early as Sunday, casting doubt on the PRC's earlier claims that he was alive and kept in captivity. Although the PRC said it was behind the attack, it became known that the capture was planned and carried out by Fatah militants. Four Palestinians were captured by IDF forces for killing Asheri, all al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades activists and Palestinian Preventive Security force members. The al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades later announced that they had captured a third Israeli, Noach Moskovich from the central Israeli city of Rishon LeZion. However Moskovich was eventually discovered dead, apparently of natural causes, near the spot where he had last been seen. The Brigades also threatened that, should there be any Palestinian civilian casualties as a result of the incursion, they would attack Israel's overseas embassies. As night fell, the Israel Defense Forces began shelling locations in Gaza with artillery, and hit two weapons warehouses. = Incursion into Northern Gaza = As night approached June 28, IDF troops and tanks massed on the northern border of Gaza Strip, and prepared to take strategic positions in the second phase of the operation, which Israel claimed targeted Qassam rocket sites. Qassam rockets were continually fired into Israel, and during the early hours of June 29, several Israeli naval vessels shelled Qassam locations. Thousands of leaflets advising civilians to leave their homes were dropped on inhabited areas in the northern Gaza Strip towns of Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun which Israel had identified as frequent launch sites for Qassam rockets. An explosion was reported in Gaza City, and eyewitnesses reported it was at the Islamic University. The university is believed to be a pro-Hamas institute. Witnesses reported Israeli tanks, soldiers, and bulldozers entering Northern Gaza. Following a plea from Egypt for more time for negotiations however, the IDF later announced it would put a hold on the second phase to give the militants a final chance to turn over Shalit. = Arrest of Hamas government members = On June 29, Israel arrested 64 Hamas officials. Amongst them were Palestinian Authority cabinet ministers and members of the Palestinian Legislative Council. Eight Hamas government members (five of whom in Ramallah) and up to twenty Legislative Council representatives were detained in the operation. Among those arrested are the Finance Minister Omar Abd al-Razaq; Labour Minister Mohammad Barghouti; Religious Affairs Minister Nayef Rajoub, brother of former West Bank strongman Jibril Rajoub of the rival Fatah party; East Jerusalem legislative council member and number two on Hamas list, Muhammad Abu Tir; as well as heads of regional councils, and the mayors and two municipal council members of Nablus, Beita and Qalqilya and the latter's deputy mayor. At least a third of the Hamas cabinet have been detained and held by Israel. As a result, many Hamas officials have gone into hiding. The IDF stated that the arrested Hamas ministers \\"are not bargaining chips for the return of the soldier – it was simply an operation against a terrorist organization\\". Israeli Minister of National Infrastructure, Benjamin Ben- Eliezer, hinted that the Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority, Ismail Haniya, is not immune from being arrested or attacked by the Security Forces. The Israeli army and government officials said, the arrested Hamas officials will be questioned and eventually indicted. \\"Their arrests were not arbitrary. They will be put to trial, and they will be able to defend themselves in accordance with a legal system which is internationally recognized,\\" Israeli Deputy Prime Minister Shimon Peres said, explaining the arrest of Hamas members. The operation to arrest these Hamas ministers was reportedly planned several weeks before and was met then with the approval of Israel's Attorney General, Menachem Mazuz. On June 28, Shabak Director Yuval Diskin brought a list of names to the approval of Israel's Prime Minister, Ehud Olmert. Mazuz decided that those arrested will be prosecuted for the criminal offences of failing to prevent acts of terror and membership of a terrorist organization (which carry a maximum sentence of twenty years) and tried by military judges before an open military tribunal, as would be the case for any other Gaza or West Bank resident. August 6, Israeli forces detained the Speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council, Aziz Dweik, at his home in the West Bank. Dweik, who is regarded as a key member of Hamas, was apprehended after Israeli military-vehicles surrounded his home in Ramallah. = Bombardment phase = Beginning on June 30, the IDF began to hit the Gaza Strip with a variety of targeted bombardments. Israeli warplanes struck more than a dozen times in Gaza in the hours after midnight, hitting a Fatah office and a Hamas facility in Gaza City as well as roads and open fields. Israeli Air Force aircraft struck the Palestinian Interior Ministry in Gaza City. The Israel Defense Forces confirmed its planes hit the office of Interior Minister Said Seyam, which it called \\"a meeting place to plan and direct terror activity\\". Shortly after, several militants approached an IDF position in Southern Gaza carrying anti-tank weaponry. The Israeli forces opened fire, wounding two militants, and causing them to leave their position.Israel hits Palestinian Interior Ministry. CNN, 5 July 2006 In a separate Israeli airstrike, three missiles hit the office of Khaled Abu Ilal, an Interior Ministry official, who also heads a pro-Hamas militia. After Israeli warnings that the Palestinian Prime Minister Ismail Haniya could be targeted for assassination if Corporal Shalit was not freed, Israeli aircraft hit the Prime Minister's office with two missiles in the early hours of July 2. On July 12, the IDF dropped a 550 lb bomb on a building in Gaza City, killing a family of nine. A spokesman for the Israeli army said they were trying to kill a group of Hamas militants led by Mohammed Deif, and did not know that a family was living inside the house when they bombed it. = High- trajectory fire into Israel = Map of the conflict area On July 4, high- trajectory fire by Palestinian militants into Israel reached a milestone when an improved Qassam rocket succeeded in reaching central Ashkelon, the first Palestinian-made rocket to do so, hitting an empty school yard, and causing light damage and no injuries. The next day, two more Qassam rockets hit a neighborhood in southern Ashkelon, wounding 8 civilians. The IDF was given the go-ahead to move into Northern Gaza with a large force, with the stated aim of attempting to push the militants farther into Gaza, and out of range from Ashkelon and other coastal towns. Qassams also struck near Netivot (which is 12 km. east of Northern Gaza), Sa'ad, Kibbutz Kfar Aza, as well as smaller towns and kibbutzim in the Negev. = Ongoing responses = On July 5, 2006, the Israeli Security Cabinet called for prolonged and gradual military action in Gaza. A communique issued after the meeting said that in light of the capture of Cpl. Gilad Shalit and the continuation of the rocket fire on Israel, \\"preparations will be made to bring about a change in the rules of the game and mode of operating with the Palestinian Authority and Hamas.\\" Later that day IDF soldiers apprehended a Palestinian wearing an explosives belt, who entered the industrial zone in the West Bank town of Barkan, near the Jewish settlement of Ariel, in a Palestinian taxi which the IDF said was destined for a major Israeli city. = Ground operation in northern Gaza Strip = On July 6, 2006, the IDF's Golani Brigade under the command of Colonel Tamir Yadai, backed by IAF jets and artillery fire, reoccupied the site of three former Israeli settlements of Dugit, Nisanit and Elei Sinai in the northern Gaza Strip. Additional forces entered the nearby Palestinian town of Beit Lahiya. A Beit Lahiya resident was quoted in Ynetnews.com as saying, \\"It's a crazy scene – everyone is shooting at everyone,\\" and \\"Soldiers are coming out of the trees, from the rooftops. The residents don't know if they should leave their homes or hide.\\" Israeli tanks and helicopter gunships entered Beit Lahiya firing at militant positions. Palestinian militants responded with automatic weapons fire. = \\"Autumn Clouds\\" = Operation \\"Summer Rains\\" was completed by Operation \\"Autumn Clouds\\", launched on November 1. When \\"Autumn Clouds\\" ended on November 26, with an Israeli withdrawal and ceasefire between Hamas and Israel, no deal for the release of Shalit had been reached. The ceasefire was only shakily observed, with rockets hitting Israel at an average rate of just over forty five per month before the next major flare-up of violence in May 2007, according to the Israeli government. During this intervening period Hamas did not itself take responsibility for rocket fire into Israel, and Israel refrained from firing tank or artillery shells into the Gaza Strip. The ceasefire broke down completely amid escalating conflict between Hamas and Fatah.  Impact on Gaza Strip residents  Palestinian officials say that it could take six months and some $15 million to repair the damage done to the destroyed power plant. According to the Palestinian Environmental NGOs Network, \\"The public health and safety and environmental hazards stemming from the damage caused to infrastructure as a result of this military operation include water shortages, contaminated remaining drinking water, uncontrolled discharge and untreated sewage flowing in the streets resulting in groundwater pollution, pollution of agricultural land which Gazans will now be unable to cultivate to harvest crops, negatively impacting their earning.\\" The Israeli army was accused of using Palestinian civilians as human shields in an operation in northern Gaza. According to the Israeli human rights group, B'tselem, six civilians including two minors were subjected to the illegal tactic during an incursion into the town of Beit Hanoun.(BBC NEWS) On June 29 the IDF made the following announcement to Gaza residents, distributed through pamphlets and broadcast through other means: :To the civilians of the area: The IDF extends its operations to all areas of the Gaza Strip, and therefore conducts military activities in your area, for the time period that is required. The operations will be launched in order to locate the site in which the captured soldier, Gilad Shalit, is being held, to rescue him, and to continue to defend the citizens of Israel. For your own safety and due to our intent to prevent injuring citizens who are not involved in activities against our forces, you must avoid being on any premises in which the IDF is operating and be attentive to the IDF's instructions. Anyone who interrupts IDF forces activities, conducted in order to complete the mission to bring the captured soldier home safely, will be in danger.(bold in the original) =Concern for potential humanitarian crisis= Early on, all border crossings in and out of Gaza were shut. Gas stations predicted petrol supplies would run out by sundown Thursday as companies rely on generators. On June 29, Álvaro de Soto, United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process and the Secretary-General's Special Representative to the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Palestinian Authority, said that fuel in Gaza would run out in two to three days, which would result in the collapse of the sewage system. Senior UN officials estimated that Gaza has two weeks of food supply left. UN Undersecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator Jan Egeland said, \\"No one can hide from us what they're doing, neither the Palestinian nor the Israeli side. We are appalled by seeing how they're playing with the future of defenseless civilians, including children,\\" and warned that Gaza was three days away (as of June 29) from a humanitarian crisis. It was predicted that all 22 Gaza hospitals would lose electricity from spare generators within one week due to the shortage of fuel and an average of 200 daily surgeries would be postponed or cancelled. There were fears that about 250 citizens suffering renal failure would face death due to the lack of electricity to run dialysis units. On Sunday July 2, Israel reopened Gaza's main cargo crossing – the Karni crossing, allowing 50 trucks with food, medical supplies and fuel, to travel from Israel to Gaza. Other trucks carrying fuel entered northeastern Gaza through the Nahal Oz border crossing. The next day, however, citing a security threat, Israel once again closed the Karni crossing. On July 20, Paul Hunt, the UN Human Rights Council's Special Rapporteur on the Right to the Highest Attainable Standard of Health has claimed that some Israeli attacks on Gaza constitute a violation of international humanitarian law, and called for an independent inquiry into war crimes in Gaza by Israel. Hunt stated that \\"The destruction of Gaza's electricity power station is profoundly inconsistent with the health and safety of all civilians living in Gaza, especially the young, sick, infirm and elderly, as well as their right to the highest attainable standard of health, enshrined in the International Bill of Rights and other international human rights instruments.\\" On July 24, Israel partially re-opened the Karni crossing. PNA sources reported that the Raffah crossing might also be re- opened in the next two days. Over one month later, on August 25, for the first time in the two months since the conflict began, Israel opened the Rafah crossing for twenty four hours, with 2,500 people entering Gaza and 1,500 exiting.\\"Rafah border crossing opens for a day\\", Jerusalem Post, August 25, 2006  Casualties  Five Israeli soldiers were killed during the conflict, including two in the initial Palestinian cross-border attack and one in a friendly fire incident. Six Israeli civilians were killed and nearly 40 wounded. According to B'Tselem, since June 28, 2006 there were 416 Palestinians killed (1 on June 30, 164 in July, 60 in August, 26 in September, 48 in October and 117 in November). The Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the armed branch of Hamas, confirmed that 124 of their fighters were killed as of November 25, 2006. The Israeli government said that non-combatants killed were primarily caught in the crossfire or died during a targeted killing; some Israeli raids targeting militants resulted in the deaths of bystanders or passers-by. Palestinian ambulance workers said that Israeli troops sometimes fired at them, preventing ambulances from reaching casualties; the Israeli government said that Palestinian militants used ambulances to transport weapons and attack them., Palestinian Misuse of Medical Services and Ambulances for Terrorist Activities. State of Israel, Ministry of Justice. The Department for International Agreements and International Litigation. October 13, 2004. Accessed November 17, 2012 Civilians died in gun battles between Palestinian gunmen and Israeli troops. Palestinian militants operated from houses; although most were abandoned, in some cases family members refused to flee and were wounded or killed. Since many Palestinians killed were not identified as militant, civilian or \\"other\\", the figures in each category were uncertain. At least six Palestinian policemen and two presidential guards were killed in clashes with Israeli forces.  Aftermath  As of December 21, 2006, over 60 Qassams had hit Israel since the declared cease-fire on November 26.Targeting Terrorists: A License to Kill?. Avery Plaw. A senior member of Hamas said that the group agreed to a cease-fire with Israel \\"because we need a period of calm to recuperate,\\" the Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth reported. \\"This lull in fighting will not bring us to speak about peace,\\" Abu Abdullah said. From late March to early April 2007, Israeli forces carried out raids in Gaza. On April 21, Palestinian militants launched three rockets into Israel after raids in the West Bank that killed five Palestinians, three of whom were militants. Israel responded with an airstrike that killed one suspected militant. In May 2007, Palestinian fighters resumed shelling of Israeli towns, launching over 70 missiles in three days to the 17th.  Reactions  =Hamas= * Hamas (military wing) – The military wing of Hamas urged Palestinians to rise up, and stated \\"fight your enemies, who came to their deaths. Grab your rifles and resist\\". On July 6, 2006, PA Interior Minister Said Siyyam of Hamas issued the Palestinian government's first, official call to arms since Israeli ground forces invaded Gaza, appealing on Thursday to all security forces to fulfill their \\"religious and moral duty to stand up to this aggression and cowardly Zionist invasion.\\" The majority of PA security forces are loyal to Fatah, which opposes Hamas. =Israel= * – David Siegel, spokesman for the Israeli embassy in Washington, D.C. said that \\"Israel did everything it could in exhausting all diplomatic options and gave Mahmoud Abbas the opportunity to return the captured Israeli... This operation can be terminated immediately, conditioned on the release of Gilad Shalit.\\" In describing Israel's assault on Gaza, Prime Minister Ehud Olmert said, \\"I take personal responsibility for what is happening in Gaza. I want no one to sleep at night in Gaza. I want them to know what it feels like.\\" =Palestinian Authority= * Fatah – Mahmoud Abbas condemned the attacks on the bridges and power plant saying that \\"attacking civil infrastructure [is] a collective punishment against [the] Palestinian people and a humanitarian crime\\". =International organizations= * Amnesty International – The organization characterized the deliberate attacks by Israeli forces against civilian property and infrastructure in the Gaza Strip as \\"war crimes,\\" and called for \\"an end to the wanton destruction and collective punishment being carried out by Israeli forces in the Gaza Strip.\\" A statement further observed that \\"destruction of three bridges and electricity networks [...] have left half the population of the Gaza Strip without electricity and have reportedly also adversely affected the supply of water.\\" Amnesty International also stated \\"The hostage-taking of Corporal Gilad Shalit, and the killing of Eliyahu Asheri, the 18-year-old settler, by Palestinian armed groups violate fundamental principles of international law. Corporal Gilad Shalit should be released immediately and unharmed\\". * – Its spokesman Alaa Rushdy said that the operations were \\"part of aggressive Israeli policies directed against the Palestinian people, whether it be through destruction or the killing of civilians\\". * -The External Relations Commissioner, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, said that \\"Both sides need to step back from the brink before this becomes a crisis that neither can control.\\" * – On July 6, 2006, The United Nations Human Rights Council passed a resolution deploring Israel's military operations in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip as a violation of international law. Passed by a vote of 29 – 11, with 5 abstentions, the resolution, \\"urges all concerned parties to respect the rules of international humanitarian law, to refrain from violence against the civilian population and to treat under all circumstances all detained combatants and civilians in accordance with the Geneva Conventions.\\" \\"Deep concern\\" was expressed over the \\"arbitrary arrest of Palestinian (Cabinet) ministers, members of the Palestinian Legislative Council and other officials as well as the arbitrary arrests of other civilians\\" and military attacks.\\" On July 13, 2006, The United States vetoed a UN resolution condemning this military operation. =Other countries= * – Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu expressed concern over the worsening humanitarian crisis, calling on Israel to \\"cease the military actions immediately\\" and for Palestinian authorities to help release the hostage as soon as possible. * – Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov called for the unconditional release of Shalit while urging Israel to show restraint. \\"Such restraint, together with the involvement of the international community, can lead to dialogue restarting and the two sides can go back to implementing the 'Road Map'\\". * – \\"Israel has committed an indefensible act,\\" the Swedish TT news agency quoted Swedish Prime Minister Göran Persson as saying. \\"It is disproportionate in terms of what the Palestinians have done,\\" Persson said. \\"To go like that and remove part of a government and members of parliament is incompatible with international law.\\" Persson cast doubt on the possibility of an exchange of prisoners. The situation \\"keeps getting worse and the dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians has now become virtually impossible. It is ominous,\\" he said. * – \\"A number of actions by the Israeli defense forces in their offensive against the Gaza Strip have violated the principle of proportionality and are to be seen as forms of collective punishment, which is forbidden,\\" the Swiss Foreign Ministry said in a statement. \\"There is no doubt that [Israel] has not taken the precautions required of it in international law to protect the civilian population and infrastructure,\\" Switzerland said. Switzerland also called for the \\"rapid release\\" of the captive Israeli soldier. * – A Syrian official stated \\"These aggressive operations form a provocation and are unjustified. If their goal is to place responsibility for the capture of the Israeli soldier on the political leadership of Hamas – then Israel is making a scandalous mistake that is crossing the boundaries of logic.\\" * – White House Press Secretary Tony Snow said that \\"Israel has the right to defend itself and the lives of its citizens... [But] in any actions the government of Israel may undertake, the United States urges that it ensures that innocent civilians are not harmed and also that it avoid the unnecessary destruction of property and infrastructure.\\" The United States vetoed a UN resolution condemning this military operation.

The vehicle was to be very heavy, and carry 11 crewmen. The complete history of the O-I is unknown, due to the \\"obscure\\" nature of the project and the limited documentation known to have survived post-war.Tank Encyclopedia O-I History and development After the Battles of Khalkhin Gol against the Soviet Union in 1939, Japan tried to improve their tank designs using lessons learned from this battle. Many Japanese tanks such as the Type 95 Ha-Go light tank and the Type 97 Chi-Ha medium tanks were proven to be insufficient to counter Soviet armored forces. A larger tank design was urgently needed. A super heavy tank project was proposed directly in response to the Japanese defeat at Khalkhin Gol. In early 1940, Hideo Iwakuro, a colonel with the Army Ministry of Japan (陸軍省 Rikugun-shō) ordered the Army Engineering Division to develop a new super heavy tank. Colonel Iwakuro indicated that the new tank should be at least two times larger than the current Type 95 Heavy Tank (26 tonnes). The general outer appearance design was not dissimilar to the Type 95 Heavy Tank. The proposed 100 ton prototype was to be equipped with a Type 92 105 mm cannon for its main gun. The development process was restarted by the Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Tokyo Machinery Division on the 120 ton version under the designation \\"Mi-To\\" (for Mitsubishi -Tokyo). Later it was given the official designation of the \\"O-I tank\\" (オイ車). \\"オ\\" is an abbreviation of \\"大き\\"(big or large) and \\"イ\\" in Japanese army nomenclature, refers to model number 1, from old Japanese alphabet iroha. The tank was again to be equipped with a Type 92 105 mm cannon for its main gun. Its two smaller front hull turrets were designed to be \\"offset slightly left from the mid-point\\". One turret was designed to carry a Type 1 47 mm tank gun as secondary armament. The other turret was to carry a 7.7 mm machine gun. The rear hull was designed to have two more smaller turrets each with a 7.7 mm machine gun. One of the main features of the O-I tank was its thick armor. Its armor had a maximum thickness of up to 200 mm, as well as 35 mm +75 mm plates on its sides and 150 mm at the back. The tank was to have two V-12 petrol-fueled aircraft engines designed by BMW in Germany and licensed to Kawasaki Heavy Industries in Japan. This was the same engine used in the Type 5 Chi-Ri medium tank. The engines were mounted \\"lengthwise parallel to each other\\" in the rear hull. According to historian Steven Zaloga, there were \\"rumors that work was underway\\" on the 120-ton version, but no known documentation survived the war. According to Akira Takizawa, one prototype of 120 tons was completed in 1943. However, the tank was \\"unpractical\\" and the project terminated. According to Kenneth Estes, the O-I project was cancelled before the 120+ ton prototype was completed. According to another source, the model kit company FineMolds in Japan bought some original documents and plans of the O-I. The source also contends that the proposed 100 ton design and \\"140-150\\" ton design are \\"incorrect representations of the O-I\\". A tank track from the project is on display at the JGSDF Fuji School in Japan. In the end, the complete history of the O-I prototype is unknown due to the \\"obscure\\" nature of the project and the limited documentation known to have survived post-war.

Sometimes applied anthropology and public anthropology are added as additional subfields. Among the journals published by the AAA, American Anthropologist is the only one that follows the \\"four-field\\" approach, publishing articles from the four main subfields of anthropology.Segal et al. 2005, Introduction, p.20 Proponents of the four- field approach see American Anthropologist's broad scope as important to maintaining disciplinary unity, while critics have expressed serious reservations about this aim, and criticize pressures since the 1970s against editors and works that do not subscribe to four-field holism as an ideal for anthropological scholarship.Segal et al. 2005, Introduction, pp.7, 22 In 2010, then editor-in-chief Tom Boellstorff proposed that American Anthropologist be viewed as an “interdisciplinary” journal, arguing that the goal should be \\"to present the best work in 'anthropology'—as defined in the broadest possible sense. That certainly includes work that speaks across subdisciplines in some manner, often by integrating methods, problematics, and relevant literatures from more than one subfield.

Sources for his life and legend include Irish annals, martyrologies, genealogies and hagiographical works. Of the two surviving medieval Lives, one was written in Latin, the other in Irish. The Latin Life was written c. 1400 by Augustine mac Graidín, who belonged to the Saints' Island on the southeastern shore of Lough Ree, south of the present- day village of Newtowncashel.Stokes, \\"St Fechin of Fore\\", p. 3. His main source appears to have been a Life originating in Féchín's monastery on Omey Island. The Irish Life (Betha Féchín Fabair \\"The Life of St Féchín of Fore\\") was written down by Nicol Óg, son of the abbot of Cong, in 1328 and it seems that parts of it go back to even earlier (Latin) sources. The text may be seen as a combination of two texts. The first part is primarily concerned with the saint's position as a mediator and negotiator between the Luigne (or Luigni) of Connacht, of which he was supposedly a member, and the more powerful Luigne of Meath, on whose territory Fore Abbey was founded.Stalmans and Charles- Edwards, \\"Meath, saints of (act. c.400–c.900).\\" The second part focuses more attention on Leinster and the payment of tribute. The Latin and Irish Lives both agree that Ailerán of Clonard, a contemporary of St Féchín, had composed an account of the saint's good works. In the 17th century, John Colgan produced another Latin Life (the Vita seu supplementum), for which he drew on three Irish Lives.Stokes, \\"St Fechin of Fore\\", p. 4. Background Féchín is said to have been born in Bile, probably Billa in what is now the parish of Ballysadare (Kilvarnet), (Co. Sligo).Breen, \\"Féchín (Mo-Ecca)\\" The medieval Lives call his mother Lassair, identified in the Irish text (first part) as a member of a royal Munster line. The late Irish Life asserts that the saint's foundation at Fore (Co. Westmeath) in Mide was connected to the Luigne and that Féchín himself belonged to the Luigne of Connacht.Charles-Edwards, Early Christian Ireland, p. 467 n. 82. In the annal for 814, however, the Chronicon Scotorum appears to suggest that the saint's church was connected to both the Gailenga and the Luigne. On the other hand, the Life's claim is corroborated by an entry in the Annals of Ulster (sub anno 993) which styles Máel Finnia, bishop of Fore, bishop of the peoples (túatha) of the Luigne. The Lives tell us that Féchín received his monastic training from St Nath Í of Achonry and later moved on to Clonmacnoise. It has been suggested that his name translates as \\"little raven\\", consisting of the Old Irish noun fiach \\"raven\\" and a diminutive suffix. His name is explained in this manner in a note added to the Félire Óengusso, which says that he received this name when his mother saw him gnawing on a bone and exclaimed \\"my little raven!\\" (mo fiachan). The same note also names him Moéca, which is explained as meaning \\"backslider\\": when Féchín felt aggrieved over the reward he received for herding the oxen of Ciarán of Clonmacnoise, he left in anger, going eastwards. When he was called back, he refused to return with his face before him and so walked backwards instead, hence the name.Felire Óengusso, ed. Stokes, pp. 48-9 alt= Foundations The first monastic houses said to have been founded by Féchín are those on the islands of Omey and Ardoilén, both off the coast of Galway, which fell under the protection of the king of Connacht, Guaire Aidne mac Colmáin. His principal foundation was Fobur, now Fore, Co. Westmeath. Between 771 and 1169, Fore was burned at least twelve times. Legend The Monk Gerald of Wales related the following legend of Féchín: \\" Chapter LII (Of the mill which no women enter) *\\"There is a mill at Foure, in Meath, which St. Fechin made most miraculously with his own hands, in the side of a certain rock. No women are allowed to enter either this mill or the church of the saint; and the mill is held in as much reverence by the natives as any of the churches dedicated to the saint. It happened that when Hugh de Lacy was leading his troops through this place, an archer dragged a girl into the mill and there violated her. Sudden punishment overtook him; for being struck with infernal fire in the offending parts, it spread throughout his whole body, and he died the same night\\". Death According to the Annals of the Four Masters, Féchín died on 14 February in the year 664 [665], during the plague which struck the island at the time.\\"A great mortality prevailed in Ireland this year, which was called the Buidhe Connail, and the following number of the saints of Ireland died of it: St. Feichin, Abbot of Fobhar, on the 14th of February; St. Ronan, son of Bearach; St. Aileran the Wise; St. Cronan, son of Silne; St. Manchan, of Liath; St. Ultan Mac hUi Cunga, Abbot of Cluain Iraird Clonard; Colman Cas, Abbot of Cluain Mic Nois; and Cummine, Abbot of Cluain Mic Nois.\\" Annals of the Four Masters s.a. 664 § 1. His feast-day is celebrated in Ireland on the 20th of January. A story about Féchín and the plague is found both in the Latin Life of Saint Gerald of Mayo and in the notes to the hymn Sén Dé (by Colmán of the moccu Clúasaig) in the Liber Hymnorum. It relates that the joint high-kings Diarmait Ruanaid and Blathmac appealed to Féchín and other churchmen, asking them to inflict a terrible plague on the lower classes of society and so decrease their number. Féchín was one of the churchmen to answer their request and to perish in the event, whereas Gerald kept aloof and survived. One of Féchín's fellow victims in the plague of 665 is said to have been St Rónán mac Beraig (son of Berach), founder of Dromiskin Monastery: Druim Inesclainn, whose relics were enshrined in 801.Ó Corráin, \\"Ireland c. 800\\", p. 588. The Uí Chrítáin, a clerical dynasty who claimed collateral descent from Lóegaire, ruled his house between the mid-9th century and 978, and asserted that their eponymous ancestor Crítán was Rónán's grandfather.Ó Corráin refers here to the genealogies in the Book of Ballymote and the clerical obits for this dynasty in the Irish annals (Annals of Ulster and Annals of the Four Masters). The Uí Chrítáin also claimed another five saints as descendants of their line, notably St Columba. Veneration Saint Feichin's church ruins on Omey Island Places connected with Féchín's cult include: Fore Abbey (Co. Westmeath), Cong Abbey (Co. Mayo), Omey Island (Co. Galway), Ardoilén/High Island (Co. Galway), Inishmaan (Co. Galway), Claddaghduff (Co. Galway), Cleggan (Co. Galway) and Termonfeckin (Co. Louth). Around 1200 the Norman landlords known as the De Lacys built a Benedictine Priory dedicated to St Féchín and St Taurin. Also, at Ballysadare, (Co. Sligo), above the west bank of the river, exist the ruins of St. Fechin's Church, and in the Catholic Church in nearby Colooney is a stained glass portrait of the saint. Local legend has him as a brother of St. Adomnán of Skreen and Iona, where Adomnán was the successor and first biographer of St. Colm Cille. In Scotland Féchín is venerated in the Latinised form Vigeanus. The village of St Vigeans, near Arbroath in Angus, has a major collection of early medieval sculpture surviving from a monastery dedicated to the saint, perhaps founded in unrecorded circumstances among the Picts in the 8th century. Other places possibly connected with Féchín in Scotland are Ecclefechan in Dumfriesshire and Torphichen in West Lothian. Lesmahagow was also originally dedicated to the saint (under the hypocoristic or devotional form of his name, Mo-Ecu). Supernatural powers and healing abilities were attributed to Féchín, with holy wells being dedicated to him throughout Ireland, with a concentration of sites in the west. A holy well stands among the remains of his monastic community on Omey Island. A pilgrimage site for those seeking a physical cure for all manner of ailments.

Description The show began running on April 2, 2001 and originally dealt with the arbitration of marital problems between litigants. The show was originally called Sala de parejas (Couple's Court) until April 2005, when it was expanded to include other disputes not related to marital issues, such as violence and child abuse,\\"Dr. Ana Maria Polo of 'Caso cerrado' Writes First Book Sharing Beh - Hispanically Speaking News.\\" Hispanically Speaking News, 21 Dec. 2010. Web. 11 May 2011. . and occasional segments where Polo seeks to educate the audience about issues related to the law. Along with the show's new format and new content added, production decided it was necessary to rename it. Caso Cerrado, the second and current show title, refers to the phrase Polo says at the end of every case, which is usually accompanied by the strike of a gavel. On each show, Polo usually takes up to two cases with conflicting guests and attempts to solve them through arbitration. Polo does not function as a judge, but as an arbitrator to settle differences between litigants. Before participating, guests are required to sign contracts agreeing to recognize and comply with Polo's decision. Until 2006 the show was produced by Promofilm Estados Unidos. It is now solely produced by Telemundo. The network does provide alternate English language closed captioning for the program on the CC3 caption channel.  Recognition  In 2010, Caso Cerrado made history by becoming the first show on a Spanish-spoken broadcasting company to be nominated for an Emmy award. Ana María Polo was nominated for an episode of the series that covered a family's special case in which a horse was purchased under false pretenses.\\"Telemundo's 'Caso cerrado' Breaks Ground with Daytime Emmy Nomination.\\" Los Angeles Times, 25 June 2010. Web. 9 May 2011. .  Criticism  Caso Cerrado has been criticized over the veracity of the cases and situations introduced in the show. In the end credits, a disclaimer is presented stating that most of the cases are dramatized. On January 4, 2009, Ana María Polo stated during an interview with the Chilean newspaper La Tercera, \\"Most of the cases have to be arranged and modified. It's the message that we send to the audience that really counts.\\" She added that every case is real, however, sometimes actors are used in cases where participants in the dispute do not want to appear on the show.  Broadcast  In the United States, where the show is produced, Caso Cerrado is broadcast exclusively by Telemundo. According to Businesswire.com, 1,455,000 people tune the show daily, and it's the number one Spanish-spoken show at the 4PM time slot. 39% of the viewers of Caso Cerrado are aged among 18 - 34.\\"Telemundo's Caso cerrado Kicks off 2011 as #1 Spanish-Language Program among Total Viewers at 4PM.\\" Business Wire.

Influence  In 2009, Ana María Polo visited Chile to attend several MEGA shows. Due to the success of the Telemundo's original show Caso Cerrado in Chile, Caso Cerrado Chile began production with Polo as host and has aired on MEGA since September 18, 2009.

It belongs to an Independent Baptist congregation, and was originally a parish church of the Church of Scotland. History The congregation was established in January 1808, when Christopher Anderson, a young Edinburgh businessman, began evangelical work in the Pleasance area of the city. By 1816 his Pleasance church was too small and he bought Charlotte Chapel, recently vacated by a Qualified congregation which had joined the Scottish Episcopal Church and then moved to St John's Church, on Princes Street. This original two-storeyed building seated 750. Anderson was pastor until 1851 and membership peaked at 232 in 1873, although many more attended services. Membership began to fall due mainly to emigration, and by 1901 the church had no minister and only a small congregation. Joseph Kemp, of Hawick, who was appointed pastor, began a revival, holding open-air meetings in Princes Street. Membership rose once more and in 1907 plans for a new building were prepared. The Rose Street church building was built at a cost of £7,250 and opened in 1912 with seating for exactly 1000. Assembly Rooms (Edinburgh) site of the chapel's Bicentenary Luncheon. In 2008 during the latter part of pastor Peter Grainger's tenure, the church held its 200th anniversary celebrations over the course of an extended weekend in October which included a large cèilidh at an area school, a formal luncheon at the Assembly Rooms on George Street, and a concert by modern hymn writers Kristen and Keith Getty. Also for the bicentennial the church saw many former members return and guest ministers visit including James Moser, Derek Prime, and American-based radio pastor Alistair Begg. Begg, a native of Scotland, was formerly \\"Pastor's Assistant\\" to Derek Prime at Charlotte Chapel beginning in September 1975 and returned to lead the 2008 celebrations, preaching at both the Sunday morning and evening services at the church's former Rose Street location. In addition, a scholarly book exploring the church's history and concluding with the 200th anniversary was later written by \\"honorary elder and former secretary\\" Dr. Ian L.S.

Unstarted shock structure evident on left, started intake on right. In supersonic aerodynamics, unstart refers to a generally violent breakdown of the supersonic airflow. The phenomenon occurs when mass flow rate changes significantly within a duct. Avoiding unstarts is a key objective in design of the engine air intakes (inlets U.S.) of supersonic aircraft which cruise at speeds of M2.2+.  Etymology  The term originated during the use of early supersonic wind tunnels. “Starting” the supersonic wind tunnel is the process in which the air becomes supersonic; unstart of the wind tunnel is the reverse process. The shock waves that develop during the starting or unstart process may be visualized with schlieren or shadowgraph optical techniques.  In aircraft engine intakes  The design of some air intakes for supersonic aircraft can be compared to that of supersonic wind tunnels, and requires careful analysis in order to avoid unstarts. At high supersonic speeds (usually between Mach 2 to 3), intakes with internal compression are designed to have supersonic flow downstream of the air intake's capture plane. If the mass flow across the intake's capture plane does not match the downstream mass flow at the engine, the intake will unstart. This can cause violent, temporary loss of control until the intake is restarted. Few aircraft, although many ramjet-powered missiles, have flown with intakes which have supersonic compression taking place inside the intake duct. These intakes, known as mixed-compression intakes, have advantages for aircraft that cruise at Mach 2.2 and higher. Most supersonic aircraft intakes compress the air externally, so do not start and hence have no unstart mode. Mixed compression intakes have the initial supersonic compression externally and the remainder inside the duct. As an example, the intakes on the B-70 Valkyrie had an external compression ratio (cr) at M3 of 3.5 and internal cr about 6.6,B-70 Aircraft Study Final Report Volume IV SD 72-SH-0003 April 1972, L.J.Taube, Space Division, North American Rockwell, p.

Early in the development of the B-1 Lancer its mixed external/internal intake was changed to an external one, technically safer but with a small compromise in cruise speed. It subsequently had fixed intakes to reduce complexity, weight and cost.\\"Design for Air Combat\\" Ray Whitford 1987, Jane's Publishing company Limited, , p.119 Work in the 1940s, for example by Oswatitsch, showed that supersonic compression within a duct, known as a supersonic diffuser, becomes necessary at M2-3 to increase the pressure recovery over that obtainable with external compression. As flight speed increases supersonically the shock system is initially external. For the SR-71 this was until about M1.6 to M1.8\\"Flying the SR-71 Blackbird\\" Col. Richard H. Graham, USAF(Retd.) 2008, Zenith Press, , p.170 and M2 for the XB-70. The intake is said to be unstarted. Further increase in speed produces supersonic speeds inside the duct with a plane shock near the throat. The intake is said to be started. Upstream or downstream disturbances, such as gusts/atmospheric temperature gradients and engine airflow changes, both intentional and unintentional(from surging), tend to cause the shock to be expelled almost instantaneously. Expulsion of the shock, known as an unstart, causes all the supersonic compression to take place externally through a single plane shock. The intake has changed in a split second from its most efficient configuration with most of its supersonic compression taking place inside the duct to the least efficient as shown by the large loss in pressure recovery, from about 80% to about 20% at M3 flight speeds. There is a large drop in intake pressure and loss in thrust together with temporary loss of control of the aircraft. Not to be confused with an unstart, with its large loss in duct pressure, is the duct over-pressure resulting from a hammershock. At speeds below the intake starting speed, or on aircraft with external compression intakes, engine surge or compressor stall can cause a hammershock. Above the intake starting speed, unstarts can cause stalls depending on the intake systems design complexity. Hammershocks have caused damage to intakes. For example, the North American F-107 during flight at high speed experienced an engine surge which bent the intake ramps. The Concorde, during development flight testing, experienced significant damage to one nacelle after both engines surged.\\"Concorde A Designer's Life The Journey to Mach 2\\" Ted Talbot 2013, The History Press, . Plate 17-19 =Intentional= When an unstart occurred on the SR-71 very large drag from the unstarted nacelle caused extreme rolling/yawing. The aircraft had an automatic restart procedure which balanced the drag by unstarting the other intake. This intake had its own tremendous drag with the spike fully forward to capture the shock wave in front of the intake.\\"Flying the SR-71 Blackbird\\" Col. Richard H. Graham, USAF(Retd.) 2008, Zenith Press, , p.141 =Avoidance= Decelerating from M3 required a reduction of thrust which could unstart an intake with the reduced engine airflow. The SR-71 descent procedure used bypass flows to give unstart margin as the engine flow was reduced. Thrust reduction on the XB-70 was achieved by keeping the engine flow stable at 100% rpm even with idle selected with the throttle. This was known as \\"rpm lock-up\\" and thrust was reduced by increasing the nozzle area. The compressor speed was maintained until the aircraft had slowed to M1.5. Theoretical basis Using a more theoretical definition, unstart is the supersonic choking phenomenon that occurs in ducts with an upstream mass flow greater than the downstream mass flow. Unsteady flow results as the mismatch in massflow can not gradually propagate upstream in contrast to subsonic flow. Instead, in supersonic flow, the mismatch is carried forward behind a 'normal' or terminal shock wave that abruptly causes the gas flow to become subsonic. The resulting normal shock wave then propagates upstream at an effective acoustic velocity until the flow mismatch reaches equilibrium. There are other ways of conceptualizing unstart which can be helpful. Unstart can be alternatively thought of in terms of a decreasing stagnation pressure inside of a supersonic duct; whereby the upstream stagnation pressure is greater than the downstream stagnation pressure. Unstart is also the result of a decreasing throat size in supersonic ducts. That is the entrance throat is larger than the diffusing throat. This change in throat size gives rise to the decreasing mass flow which defines unstart. The choking reaction of unstart results in the formation of a shock wave inside of the duct. Shock instability or buzz Under certain conditions, the shock wave in front or within a duct may be unstable, and oscillate upstream and downstream. This phenomenon is known as buzz. Stronger shock waves interacting with low momentum fluid or boundary layer tend to be unsteady and cause buzz. Buzz conditions can cause structural dynamics-induced failure if adequate margins are not incorporated into design.

Bushell, ‘Oi! – The Debate’, Sounds, 24 January 1981, 30–1.G. Bushell, Dance Craze (London, 1981). The movement was partly a response to the perception that many participants in the early punk rock scene were, in the words of The Business guitarist Steve Kent, \\"trendy university people using long words, trying to be artistic...and losing touch.\\"Robb, John (2006). Punk Rock: An Oral History (London: Elbury Press). . History Oi! became a recognised genre in the latter part of the 1970s, emerging after the perceived commercialisation of punk rock, and before the soon-to-dominate hardcore punk sound. It fused the sounds of early punk bands such as the Sex Pistols, the Ramones, the Clash, and the Jam with influences from 1960s British rock bands such as the Small Faces, and the Who, football chants, pub rock bands such as Dr. Feelgood, Eddie and the Hot Rods, and the 101ers, and glam rock bands such as Slade and Sweet. Although Oi! has come to be considered mainly a skinhead-oriented genre, the first Oi! bands were composed mostly of punk rockers and people who fit neither the skinhead nor punk label. First-generation Oi! bands such as Sham 69 and Cock Sparrer were around for years before the word Oi! was used retroactively to describe their style of music. In 1980, writing in Sounds magazine, rock journalist Garry Bushell labelled the movement Oi!, taking the name from the garbled \\"Oi!\\" that Stinky Turner of Cockney Rejects used to introduce the band's songs.G. Bushell, Hoolies: True Stories of Britain’s Biggest Street Battles (London, 2010), 156. The word is an old British expression meaning hey or hey there! In addition to Cockney Rejects, other bands to be explicitly labeled Oi! in the early days of the genre included Angelic Upstarts, the 4-Skins, the Business, Anti-Establishment, Blitz, the Blood, and Combat 84.Marshall, George (1991). Spirit of '69: A Skinhead Bible (Dunoon, Scotland: S.T. Publishing). . The prevalent ideology of the original Oi! movement was a rough brand of working- class rebellion. Lyrical topics included unemployment, workers' rights, harassment by police and other authorities, and oppression by the government. Oi! songs also covered less-political topics such as street violence, football, sex, and alcohol. Some fans of Oi! were involved in white nationalist organisations such as the National Front (NF) and the British Movement (BM), leading some critics to dismiss the Oi! subgenre as racist. However, none of the bands associated with the original Oi! scene promoted racism or far-right politics. Some Oi! bands, such as Angelic Upstarts, The Business, the Burial and the Oppressed were associated with left wing politics and anti-racism, and others were non-political.Worley, Matthew, Oi! Oi! Oi!: Class, Locality, and British Punk (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013) Rock Against Communism (RAC) was a partial development from white power/white supremacist movements, which had musical and aesthetic similarities to Oi! Although due to Cold War fears the genre had appeal to some punk rock bands distinct from original Oi! in that they opposed all totalitarianism,Barberis, Peter, John McHugh, and Mike Tyldesley (2000). Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations (London and New York: Continuum International Publishing Group), p. 175. . but was not connected to the Oi! scene. Timothy S. Brown writes: > [Oi!] played an important symbolic role in the politicization of the > skinhead subculture. By providing, for the first time, a musical focus for > skinhead identity that was 'white'—that is, that had nothing to do with the > West Indian immigrant presence and little obvious connection with black > musical roots—Oi! provided a musical focus for new visions of skinhead > identity [and] a point of entry for a new brand of right-wing rock music. Garry Bushell, the journalist who promoted the Oi! genre, argued that the white power music scene was \\"totally distinct from us. We had no overlap other than a mutual dislike\\". The mainstream media increased its claims that Oi! was linked to far-right racist politics after an Oi! concert at the Hambrough Tavern in Southall on 4 July 1981 ended with five hours of rioting, 120 people being injured and the tavern being burnt down.Marshall, George (1991). Spirit of '69: A Skinhead Bible (Dunoon, Scotland: S.T. Publishing), pp. 106, 110. .D. Renton, When We Touched the Sky: The Anti-Nazi League, 1977–81 (London, 2006), 136–55. Before the concert, some audience members had written NF slogans around the area and bullied Asian residents of the neighbourhood. In response, local Asian youths threw Molotov cocktails and other objects at the tavern, mistakenly believing that the concert—featuring the Business, the 4-Skins and the Last Resort—was a neo-Nazi event. Although some of the concert-goers were NF or BM supporters, none of the performers were white power music bands, and the audience of approximately 500 people included left- wing skinheads, black skinheads, punk rockers, rockabillies and non-affiliated youths.Marshall, George (1991). Spirit of '69: A Skinhead Bible (Dunoon, Scotland: S.T. Publishing), pp. 107–108. . In the aftermath of that riot, many Oi! bands condemned racism and fascism. These denials, however, were met with cynicism from some quarters because of the Strength Thru Oi! compilation album, released in May 1981. Not only was its title a play on a Nazi slogan \\"Strength Through Joy\\", but the cover featured Nicky Crane, a skinhead BM activist who was serving a four-year sentence for racist violence (Crane later disavowed his alignment with the far right after revealing he was gay). Bushell, who compiled the album, stated its title was a pun on the Skids' album Strength Through Joy, and that he had been unaware of the Nazi connotations. He also denied knowing the identity of the skinhead on the album's cover until it was exposed by the Daily Mail two months after the release. Bushell, a socialist at the time, noted the irony of being branded a far-right activist by a newspaper that \\"had once supported Oswald Mosley's Blackshirts, Mussolini's invasion of Abyssinia, and appeasement with Hitler right up to the outbreak of World War Two.\\" After the Oi! movement lost momentum in the United Kingdom, Oi! scenes formed in continental Europe, North America, and Asia. Soon, especially in the United States, the Oi! phenomenon mirrored the hardcore punk scene of the late 1970s, with American Oi!-originating bands such as the Radicals, U.S. Chaos, Iron Cross, Agnostic Front, Anti Heros. Later American punk bands such as Rancid and Dropkick Murphys have credited Oi! as a source of inspiration. In the mid-1990s, there was a revival of interest in Oi! music in the UK, leading to older Oi! bands receiving more recognition. In the 2000s, many of the original UK Oi! bands reunited to perform and/or record.

The village is located along the upper course of the River Witham 1.5 miles downstream (north) of South Witham, and approximately south from the nearest major town, Grantham. It has an estimated population of 143 in around 72 households, at a density of 0.1/hectare. The current civil parish of Colsterworth includes the hamlet of Lobthorpe. Nearby villages include Gunby, Colsterworth and Stainby. The village is perhaps best known for its links with Isaac Newton, who is known to have lived nearby and visit the village on numerous occasions and made carvings in the wall of the church porch, and for the presence of nearby RAF North Witham. History =Toponymy= The origin of the name \\"North Witham\\" is uncertain, though the village appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as \\"Widme\\" and then again in 1382 in the will of the village rector as \\"N Wythum.\\" The origin of the name Witham is disputed however theories include the settlement being named after Wymund, an early settler in the area, or that the name was taken from the prefix \\"With\\" meaning willow and \\"ham\\" (the suffix appointed to Anglo-Saxon settlements widely believed to mean \\"village\\") which gives us With-ham: willow village. =Early history= No details are known of the village are known prior to the Domesday Book. However a Saxon clay loomweight from around 650 AD was found at Manor Farm in the village and is now being stored at the City and County Museum in Lincoln. It is believed that an Anglo-Saxon church existed on the site of the current church of St Mary. However no actual evidence of this has been found, other than a carved Anglo-Saxon cross in the Celtic style which can now be found in the church porch, and patches of herringbone brickwork within the current structure. There are several traces of medieval farming in the village, and the site of a Shrunken medieval village. =The church= As mentioned above North Witham's Parish Church of St Mary is believed to have been first built in its current form in around 1086 by the Normans; however, evidence such as herringbone brickwork in the church wall suggests that perhaps at least some of the modern structure is Anglo-Saxon. The church attracts considerable attention because of its striking and unusual features, which include an original Norman doorway in the northern wall of the structure. It is thought that such a small village was provided with such an extravagant church because of the early residents of the area who included Countess Judith, niece of William the Conqueror, and Sortibrand, the local Thane. The current tower and spire of the church were erected between 1380 and 1410; however, the current bells (a ring of three) weren't installed until around 1540. Also during the 15th century an arch between the vestry and the chancel was made leading into a room with a chamber above it. Local tradition states that the upper chamber was inhabited by the parish priest and above the archway there still remains a small hole through which the priest could check to see if the lamp above the altar was still lit. A side chapel was once present at the church; however, this was later destroyed and its foundation wasn't rediscovered until the restoration of the church in 1887. The side chapel is thought to have been where masses were said for the souls of the dead. The next major changes to the church came in the 16th century when the English Reformation occurred and many of the church's ornaments, including a rood screen and a number of smaller items, were removed or destroyed. However it was over this period, between 1530 and 1564, that the current church bells were installed in the spire. The most notable bell is \\"Catherine\\" which was installed prior to 1540 and bears the inscription \\"Principio fine sonans sonus hic sit Caterine\\" (May this sound of Catherine be sounding in the beginning (and) in the end.) The other two bells, which were installed later, bear the inscriptions \\"Hope wel have w(e)l\\" and \\"CelorumXte placeat tibi rex sonus iste\\" (\\"O Christ, King of Heaven, may the sound please Thee\\") respectively. The Church contains a number of tombs of the Sherard family, who were influential in the area in the past, and also a helmet from a suit of armour thought to have belonged to the occupant of one of the tombs. The entirety of the suit of armour, or one similar to it, was present in the church well into the 20th century, however much of it was stolen by thieves. Hannah Newton (born Hannah Ayscough), the mother of Isaac Newton, married Barnabus Smith the Rector of the parish on Tuesday 27 January 1646 in his parish, and during the prohibited period for marriages. She moved to the rectory, staying there until August 1653 when her seventy-one-year-old husband died. Isaac's two half- sisters and half-brother were baptized in the parish, and probably born there. Graffiti accredited to the young physicist can still be seen in several places in and around the church. =Modern history= A total of 25 men are listed as having Served in the First World War on the North Witham Roll of Honour, it is thought that this may have been around one quarter of the village's total population. Four died in service, and 21 returned. A wall plaque to commemorate the dead was installed in the village church some time after the conflict. A similar Roll of Honour in the church records the service of local people in the Second World War. It records 1 dead and 15 survived. The casualty was Sgt. Alfred Crompton. A third memorial records the additional death of Flt. Sgt Cyril Geeson in the war in the east. During World War II RAF North Witham was established near the village and the airfield was used by the USAAF later in the conflict. Following the end of World War II the airfield was closed, then used as an ammunition dump and test track for a time, before being donated to the Forestry Commission who still run the site under the name Twyford Wood. Governance A Parish Council was traditionally responsible for local issues, however control was merged into the Parish council for Colsterworth in 2007 because of a lack of interest from villagers in North Witham itself. The North Witham Parish council had previously met in the village hall: a cricket pavilion from the nearby village of Great Ponton which was moved to North Witham in the early 1960s. Although effectively merged with Colsterworth, the 'civil parish has not been abolished and remains a separate legal entity. At district level the village falls into the Morkery ward of South Kesteven and is current represented at the district council by the Conservative Party Councillor Margery Radley. North Witham falls into the Grantham and Stamford parliamentary constituency and is represented by Nick Boles of the Conservative Party.  Education  Records suggest that a school existed in the village prior to 1857, however it wasn't until 1872 that a purpose built school building was constructed by Browne's Hospital, Stamford. In September 1874 the school is recorded to have had 24 pupils, however by 1936 this had dropped to 14. During 1941 a German bomber, thought to have been under the illusion that it was above the nearby town of Grantham, bombed North Witham and completely destroyed the school. The remaining pupils continued to have lessons inside the rectory in the village until May 1942 when the six pupils were given places at South Witham and Colsterworth schools. Today children of a primary school age continue to attend the schools in the nearby village, however older children have to travel to nearby towns such as Grantham and Stamford to continue their education. Community In the past the parish contained two public houses, the Plough Inn and the Black Bull, however both were closed in the 20th century. A village shop was opened in the village hall during the 1980s, but closed after two years. A previous telephone box was removed by British Telecom in 2007 after it was vandalised; a post box from the reign of King George VI is still in place. A Camping and Caravanning Club certified campsite is used by caravanners as a stopping-off point when using the nearby A1 road. The village is on the route of the No.28 bus between Grantham and South Witham.

There Trokelowe wrote his Annales including the period 1259 to 1296 and a useful account of the reign of Edward II of England, from 1307 to 1323, after which date his chronicle was continued by Henry de Blaneford. A reference made by Trokelowe to the execution of Roger Mortimer shows that he was writing after 1330.

() is a Canadian electronics company and part of Esterline Corporation's Avionics & Controls business segment. The company's principal manufacturing facility is located in Montreal, Quebec, with additional facilities located in Ottawa, Ontario and Sugar Grove, Illinois.  History  The company was founded in 1903 as Canadian Wireless Telegraph Company of Canada by Guglielmo Marconi. In 1925 the company was renamed Canadian Marconi Company. In 1948 English Electric purchased the UK based Marconi Company and in 1953 acquired 50.6% of Canadian Marconi Company. In 1968 English Electric was itself purchased by General Electric Company (GEC), which took control of the 50.6% share of CMC. On November 30, 1999 British Aerospace completed its purchase of GEC's Canadian Electronic Systems to form BAE Systems. In December 1999 BAE Systems purchased GEC's 51.6% share of CMC in a separate transaction. In February 2000 the company changed its name to BAE Systems Canada. In April 2001 ONCAP (an investment group comprising Onex Corporation and other investors) completed its purchase of BAE Systems Canada. This saw BAE Systems sell its then 54% majority share and ONCAP purchase the remaining 46% publicly held shares. The company was then renamed CMC Electronics since it had previously sold its rights for the Marconi name to Marconi plc. In 2007, after owning the company for 6 years, the investment time frame initially planned by ONCAP, CMC Electronics was sold to, and is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Esterline Corporation.  Company structure  CMC Electronics is a wholly owned subsidiary of Transdigm. CMC has two primary operating business units: Avionics Products, and Cockpit System Integration. A third business unit, NavComm, is Canada's largest distributor of marine electronics. According to a 2009 company presentation, 50% of the company's sales go to the USA, 19% to Canada, and 31% to overseas customers. It has an approximate 50/50 split between commercial sales and military sales. The President of CMC Electronics is Mr. Robin St-Arnaud.

A Democrat, he was the eighth mayor of Metropolitan Nashville and Davidson County.https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2019/09/28/john-cooper-sworn- nashville-mayor-oath-of-office/2439607001/ He was elected in 2015 as vice- mayor and was sworn in as acting mayor after Megan Barry's resignation on March 6, 2018. Briley went on to win the May 24 special election for the balance of Barry's term with 55% of the vote over nearly a dozen challengers, avoiding a runoff and making him the official mayor of Nashville. John Cooper defeated Briley in the 2019 Nashville mayoral election. Briley was the first native of both Nashville and Tennessee since Bill Boner in 1991 to be mayor.  Education  Briley is a lifelong Nashvillian, and his grandfather was the first elected mayor of Metropolitan Nashville. His early education included Glendale Elementary School, Lipscomb Middle School, and Montgomery Bell Academy. Briley earned a bachelor's degree from Georgetown University in 1987 before traveling to Latin America where he volunteered as a teacher of English. He completed his JD at Golden Gate University in 1995 and received honors for administrative and environmental law.  Political career  Briley was elected to serve as an At Large Metro Councilman for Davidson County from 1999 to 2007. He was the Vice-Chair of the Budget and Finance Committee and held seats on the Personnel, Public Information, Human Relations and Housing Committee, the Traffic and Parking Committee and the Greenways Committee. He was past Chair of the Ad Hoc Committee on Solid Waste and the Water Rate Oversight Committee. Briley was voted Best Council Member by the Nashville Scene in 2001, 2002 and 2006 and was spotlighted as one of \\"40 under 40\\" by Business Nashville magazine in June 2000. In November 2006, Briley announced his candidacy for Mayor of Nashville. His campaign included a number of familiar political faces, including Will Cheek Jr., member of the Democratic National Committee and former chair of the Tennessee Democratic Party, and his son, Will Cheek III, an attorney at the firm of Bone McAllester Norton. Jerry Martin, who served at Finance Director under Congressman Jim Cooper in 2002, chaired the campaign's finance committee. Emily Passini was campaign manager; Drew Stanieuski was deputy campaign manager. Sarah Lingo was finance director and Alex Youn was director of field operations. Briley finished fifth in the August 2007 election and returned to private life. In 2015, Briley was elected Vice Mayor of Nashville. On March 6, 2018, Mayor Megan Barry resigned her position after pleading guilty to felony theft in a plea bargain regarding improper use of public funds for travel expenses and an affair with the head of her security, leaving the Vice Mayor to fill the position. Briley was sworn in as mayor of Metro Nashville. Within a week of his acceding to the office, Briley announced both his intent to run for the remaining year of Barry's term in the Nashville mayoral election, which was initially set for August 2, 2018 by the Davidson County Election Commission, but subsequently moved to May 2018 after a lawsuit filed by opponents was successful, and a plan to demolish the abandoned Herschel Greer Stadium, former home of the Nashville Sounds minor league baseball team. Greer Stadium was on the grounds of Civil War Fort Negley, and Briley announced a plan to leave the area as undeveloped, natural park space, in part out of respect to the many slaves and former slaves who worked on the construction of Fort Negley, several of whom died in the process and whose remains are buried on the grounds. Briley also continued the mayor's office's support of the Let's Move Nashville transit referendum, signing a \\"Declaration of Transportation Independence\\" on April 2. Briley's support seemingly meant little to the transit referendum, which was defeated by over a three-to-two majority on May 1, 2018, but apparently his support did little to dampen his personal popularity, as he was elected by an absolute majority to the balance of Berry's unexpired term in a special election only three weeks later over a dozen opponents, all of whom had expressed opposition to the transit initiative. Briley campaigned for re-election as Mayor of Metropolitan Nashville in the 2019 Nashville mayoral election. In the election's first round, John Cooper led Briley 35% to 25% as both advanced to a runoff election. In the runoff, Briley was defeated by Cooper by a margin of approximately 70% to 30%. Cooper then succeeded Briley as Mayor of Nashville when he was sworn in on September 28, 2019.https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2019/09/18/nashville-mayor-john- cooper-swearing-in/2344271001/https://communityimpact.com/nashville/southwest- nashville/city-county/2019/09/23/inauguration-set-for-metro-nashville-mayor- elect-john-cooper/  Contributions  In 2005, Briley proposed citywide wireless Internet access for Nashville. Received coolly by the administration, Briley's proposal nonetheless contributed to the development of free wireless access at Davidson County's public libraries as well as many public parks, including Centennial Park. A task force, led by Briley and including council members and representatives from technology and infrastructure providers, ultimately supported this narrower public access. In 2006, Briley was one of a small number of vocal opponents to proposed development which would have moved the city's AAA baseball team, the Nashville Sounds, into downtown Nashville. This proposed development, adjacent to Nashville's Riverfront Park along the Cumberland River, was eventually cancelled and later replaced by a plan for a new stadium located slightly north of downtown Nashville, First Tennessee Park. In 2007, Briley wrote legislation requiring government buildings in Nashville to be built within LEED certification requirements.  Personal life  Briley is married to Jodie Bell and has one son. He is the grandson of Beverly Briley, first mayor of the combined Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County. His brother, Rob Briley, has previously served as a Tennessee State Representative for the 52nd District. Briley has been a practicing lawyer and was a member of Bone McAllester Norton PLLC prior to becoming mayor and having to wind up his legal practice; unlike his former position of vice mayor, being Mayor of Nashville is a full-time occupation.

The , 45-story high-rise stands along Walnut Street and Washington Square and is the 15th tallest building in Philadelphia. The Chicago-style, glass-and-concrete skyscraper incorporated into its design several historic 19th-century buildings that lined Walnut Street. These buildings included three Federal-style rowhouses built in 1807 called York Row and the Italianate-style former headquarters of the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society, built in 1868–1869. After lying vacant and neglected for years, the only part of York Row preserved were the rowhouses' facades. Only a back portion of the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society building was demolished, the rest being incorporated as retail and office space. Developer P&A; Associates first attempted to develop the site in 1995, but was delayed because of a lack of investor confidence in the project. When the Philadelphia residential market improved in the late 1990s, St. James Associates Joint Venture, a joint venture of P&A; Associates and others, began construction in November 2001. The high-rise building, completed in 2004, features 306 units, with each but the studio apartments having a private balcony. Its amenities include a swimming pool, a private courtyard, and a nine-story parking garage that makes up the base of the building. History =PSFS headquarters and York Row= The site of The St. James was formerly occupied by a group of historic 19th-century buildings that lined Walnut Street in the Washington Square West neighborhood in Center City, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The most notable of these was the former headquarters of the Philadelphia Savings Fund Society (PSFS). Designed in 1868 by Addison Hutton, the granite-faced Italianate-style building was the second headquarters building that PSFS had built. Construction began on the building on June 13, 1868 and it was opened for business on October 11, 1869. An addition designed by Hutton was added in 1885, and another designed by Frank Furness in 1895. The building served as the PSFS headquarters until 1932 when the company moved to the PSFS Building on Market Street. The other buildings are a group of three brick three-story rowhouses called York Row. Built in 1807 in the Federal style, they are an early example of speculative housing development. York Row was built at a time when Philadelphia's population was shifting westward, away from the Delaware River. The PSFS headquarters building in the 1970s. York Row is on the far right. The buildings were bought for US$4.7 million in 1988 by real estate investor Samuel A. Rappaport. Rappaport, who made a fortune by buying, improving, and then selling run-down properties, announced in 1989 that he planned to turn the building into his own personal headquarters and add a glass-enclosed ballroom on its top. Rappaport also planned to have an apartment in one of the York Row houses. However, like many other Rappaport-owned buildings, they ended up being left vacant and neglected, becoming a target for vandals and the homeless. Rappaport died in 1994, and in January 1995 developer P&A; Associates announced its agreement to buy the properties from his estate. The developer also disclosed plans to build a luxury residential tower at the site. The plan called for dismantling part of Furness's additions to the PSFS headquarters, which would serve as the tower's lobby. The York Row houses would have been completely demolished. The plan was controversial as preservationists wanted the buildings to remain unchanged. P&A; Associates met with representatives of the Preservation Alliance for Greater Philadelphia and in February 1995 advanced a new plan that would preserve most of the PSFS headquarters and the York Row facade. The new plan, which was approved by the Philadelphia Historical Commission, included renovating the PSFS headquarters and converting it into restaurant and office space. The York Row building interiors had been stripped of everything except for one fireplace mantle and could not be restored. P&A; Associates would instead preserve the front facade of the houses, back to the roof ridge line. =Construction= After its announcement in 1995, the project stalled because P&A; Associates was unable to find investors to finance the project. Investors were skeptical that luxury residential apartments outside the Rittenhouse Square neighborhood in Center City could be successful. The delay allowed another developer to announce an agreement to acquire the property. In March 1999, Chicago-based developer the Barton Group announced its plan to build a 37-story, 322-unit luxury residential tower. The Barton Group's plan would also incorporate the PSFS headquarters building and York Row into the tower. At the end of the 1990s, Philadelphia was experiencing a condominium boom, with more than 70 Center City office and manufacturing buildings being converted into rental and condominium apartments between 1998 and 2004. With the residential market in Center City growing, P&A; Associates found financing by going into a partnership with real estate firm Boston Financial to fund its planned residential tower. Around the same time, the Barton Group ended its intentions with the site and sold its interest in the property to P&A; Associates and Boston Financial. The tower announced by P&A; Associates and Boston Financial would be a 300-unit luxury rental tower called St. James Court, named after an adjacent street. The high-rise would still incorporate the preservation efforts for the 19th-century buildings it agreed to in 1995. P&A; Associates received final approval from the city zoning board and the historical commission in August 1999, but continued to seek more financing, which it was able to secure from Corus Bank of Chicago in September 2001. To develop the tower, now called The St. James, P&A; Associates formed the St. James Associates Joint Venture with Clark Realty Capital LLC and Lend Lease Real Estate Investments, which represented an undisclosed client. With financial backing from its partners and tax breaks for new residential construction passed in 2000, construction began on November 28, 2001. BACE Construction (Philadelphia based) was awarded the construction of the project. Philadelphia had not seen any residential high-rise development since the 1980s, and The St. James was one of the first to begin construction in the city, preceded only by the 16-story Residences at the Dockside, which broke ground in 2000. It became the largest residential building in the city. By the beginning of March 2004, 20 percent of the 306 units in The St. James had been leased. Construction was completed later that month, with finishing touches added later in the year. In March 2005, a year after the building was completed, P&A; Associates and Clark Realty Capital, under the name of 700 Walnut LP, announced The St. James was for sale. At the time, 45 percent of its units were being rented. P&A; Associates sold off its interest in the building that same year. Building The St. James is a 45-story, high-rise luxury residential skyscraper in Center City. At tall, it is the 12th tallest building in Philadelphia. The US$80 million, Chicago-style high-rise was designed by Solomon Cordwell Buenz & Associates Inc. with assistance by architectural firm Bower Lewis Thrower. Located between 8th Street, Walnut Street, St. James Street, and Washington Square, The St. James stands two blocks from Independence Hall. The glass and concrete skyscraper's east and west facade is split between a curved wall, a squared-off wing, and a strip of blue glass that separates them. The St. James contains of residential and commercial space. This includes of office space, of retail space, and of residential space. The 306 residential units feature ceilings and floor-to- ceiling windows. The building features a four-pipe heating and air- conditioning system, and every unit, except for the studio apartments, has a private balcony. Building amenities include an 11th-floor health club and a swimming pool. The first nine floors of The St. James house private parking for building residents. The street-level retail floor is occupied by a Starbucks and an Oceanaire seafood restaurant. Along Walnut Street, The St. James incorporated the front facades of the York Row houses, while the rest of the buildings were demolished. The main tower is set from the York Row facades to preserve the Row's original look. All but the rear wing of the PSFS headquarters building was incorporated into the tower. The demolished portion of the PSFS building was converted into a hidden courtyard for residents. Preservationists were critical of how the York Row houses were preserved. Calling them \\"facadectomies\\", vice president of the Preservation Alliance for Greater Philadelphia J. Randall Cotton felt that saving the facades did not preserve the essence of the buildings, but that it was better than nothing. Cotton said, \\"At the eyeball level, it will give something of the coherence of the Philadelphia cityscape, which is a human scale. The beauty of Philadelphia is that its lots were 20 to 25 feet, which allowed for a door and two windows. It's a falsehood to put a big building behind them. But it's preferable to demolition.\\" The Philadelphia Inquirer architecture critic Inga Saffron was critical of the parking garage on the lower floors, saying it \\"detracts from [The St. James's] crisp, vertical lines and bumps clumsily against the historic buildings. The garage also makes the tower feel distant from the life of the city.\\" The St. James has won several awards, including the 2006 National Association of Home Builders awards for Best Luxury Rental Apartment Primary Market and Best High-Rise Rental Apartment.

Life  =Early life= Nicholas was born to Nicholas P. Kemmer and his wife Barbara Statzer in Saint Petersburg. His family moved to Germany in 1922, where he was educated at Bismarckschule Hanover and then at the University of Göttingen. He received his doctorate in nuclear physics at the University of Zurich and worked as an assistant to Wolfgang Pauli, who had to give strong arguments in 1936, before being allowed to employ a non-Swiss national.Charles P. Enz, Beat Glaus, Gerhard Oberkofler (eds.): Wolfgang Pauli und sein Wirken an der ETH Zürich, vdh Hochschulverlag ETHZ Zürich, 1997, , p. 62 (in German language) Later on, Kemmer moved to the Beit Fellowship at Imperial College London. =British nuclear development= Kemmer moved to Trinity College, Cambridge in 1940 to work on Tube Alloys, the wartime atomic energy project. In 1940, when Egon Bretscher and Norman Feather showed that a slow neutron reactor fuelled with uranium would in theory produce substantial amounts of plutonium-239 as a by-product, Kemmer (who was lodging at the Bretschers') proposed the names Neptunium for the new element 93 and Plutonium for 94 by analogy with the outer planets Neptune and Pluto beyond Uranus (uranium being element 92). The Americans Edwin M. McMillan and Philip Abelson at the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory, who had made the same discovery, fortuitously suggested the same names. =Professorship= Kemmer spent 1944–1946 in Canada. At the University of Edinburgh from 1953 to 1979, he was Tait Professor of Mathematical Physics, creating the Tait Institute of Mathematical Physics in 1955. He was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1954. His proposers were Norman Feather, Max Born, Sir Edmund Whittaker and Alexander Aitken. He served as the Society's Vice-President from 1971 to 1974. Kemmer was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1956 and won its Hughes Medal in 1966. He was awarded the J. Robert Oppenheimer Memorial Prize in 1975. Nicholas Kemmer was also a mentor and a teacher of the only Pakistani Nobel laureate, Dr. Abdus Salam. Kemmer is credited to trained and work with Salam in Neutron scattering by using relativity equations.

When a councillor has an interest in a topic under debate that may affect their ability to fairly and objectively consider the subject, he or she is said to have a prejudicial interest. An example would be a councillor discussing a planning application for a company in which he or she has an interest. The councillor has an interest in the plans being approved and is therefore considered to have a \\"prejudicial interest\\". The Standards Board for England is the body responsible for investigating allegations of undeclared prejudicial interests. It is the responsibility of the councillor to declare their interest prior to discussions or votes and, once declared, they must leave the room for the duration of the discussion or vote. Anyone can make an allegation of an undeclared prejudicial interest although the Standards Board for England can only investigate reactively rather than proactively - i.e. they cannot intervene to stop an offence from taking place, only investigate the offence once it has taken place. Councillors and members of other local authorities in England are governed by a Code of Practice which is enforced by the Standards Board for England. In Scotland, the Standards Commission for Scotland carries out a similar function but also regulates members of devolved bodies.

Population spikes often reflect synaptically induced firing and therefore, they can be classified as a type of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials. In some areas of the brain, such as the hippocampus, neurons are arranged in such a way that they all receive synaptic inputs in the same area. Because these neurons are in the same orientation, the extracellular signals from the generation of action potentials don't cancel out, but rather add up to give a signal that can easily be recorded with a field electrode. The PS is usually recorded with an extracellular electrode placed close to neural cell bodies or axons. The first interpretations of hippocampal field potentials were developed by Per Andersen.

The teaching emphasizes that God is an inherently social being.Theology for the Community of God, pg 76, Stanley J. Grenz, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2000, : \\"At the heart of Christian understanding is the declaration that God is triune - Father Son and Spirit. This means that in his eternal essence the one God is a social reality, the social Trinity. Because God is the social Trinity, a plurality in unity\\" Human unity approaches conformity to the image of God's unity through self-giving, empathy, adoration for one another, etc. Such love is a fitting ethical likeness to God, but is in stark contrast to God's unity of being.Against Eunomius, esp. 2.12, Gregory of Nyssa, at CCEL Those who are often associated with this term include Jürgen Moltmann, Miroslav Volf, Elizabeth A. Johnson, Leonardo Boff, and John Zizioulas. Three persons Orthodox Christian theology asserts that the one God is manifest in three 'persons' (this term was generally used in the Latin West). Social trinitarian thought argues that the three persons are each distinct realitiesthis was generally presented in the East with the Greek term 'hypostasis' from the First Council of Nicaea onward. Hypostasis was here employed to denote a specific individual instance of being. So, the Trinity is composed of three distinct 'persons' or 'hypostases' which are in integral relation with one another. The Cappadocian Fathers outlined the traditional set of doctrines describing the relational character of the Trinity: the Father is the Father by virtue of begetting the Son; likewise the Son is the Son precisely by being begotten. These two hypostases do not have their identity first as individual entities that then relate; rather, they are what they are precisely due to their relations. John Zizioulas is perhaps the best-known contemporary proponent of this emphasis in trinitarian theology, which he labels relational ontology.John Zizioulas. Being as Communion, Crestwood, NY: St. Vladimir's Press, 1985. Many proponents of the social trinitarianism, including John Zizioulas, criticize modern individualism by mapping human relationships onto this relational ontology as well. This suggests that the individual is not constituted over and against other persons. On the contrary, say these proponents, a person's identity and self are deeply constituted by their relationships, such that a person could not be the same person were it not for the relationship - the relationship, in some sense at least, precedes (ontologically, though not necessarily temporally) the person rather than the person preceding the relationship.Patricia Fox, God as Communion, Collegeville, Minnesota: The Liturgical Press, 2001. Fox outlines how Zizioulas', Rahner's, and Elizabeth Johnson's thought can inform a robust understanding of the term 'person'. Two theological keys to the idea of person found in the social trinitarianism are the trinitarian concept of perichoresis (\\"interpenetration\\"associated most strongly with Saint John of Damascus), and the Christological doctrine of two wills in one person (which was central to Maximus the Confessor's defense of orthodoxy). The doctrine of the two wills of Christ stems from the Council of Chalcedon where the Church affirmed that Jesus is fully human and fully divine, without division and yet without mixing. Thus Jesus is one person, yet with two natures, which two natures yield two wills. This was intended to combat both Nestorius' two-persons approach and the monophysite doctrine of Jesus as being so divine that his humanity was overwhelmed. This allowed the Church to affirm that Jesus was truly one person who both participated in the divine Trinitarian \\"economy\\" as well as in the human sphere of material being. One essence The three persons of the Trinity must not be confused as three distinct gods, an error that the name 'Trinity' itself was developed to combat: Tri-unity (as first outlined by Tertullian). All three persons/hypostases have one divine nature: their essence (\\"ousia\\" in Greek). It was in the development of the Trinity that the Greek terms ousia and hypostasis were fully separated; before the First Council of Nicaea, they had often been used interchangeably. Social Trinitarian thought argues that this one essence can be thought of as the loving relationship between Father, Son, and Spirit. This relationship can be analogized to human loving relationships; however, as mentioned above, it is a complete unityit does not arise from the three hypostases but is intimately involved in their very ontological constitution. The idea of perichoresis of the persons of the trinity has been cited to provide at least part of this greater unity. It is important to note that though the Cappadocians, for example, tended to begin with the three persons and from there develop the sense of unity, while Augustine of Hippo more or less began, drawing from the Latin tradition of Tertullian, with the unity and then developed the three distinct persons (along a psychological metaphor), neither the Eastern nor the Western traditions actually see either the 3 or the 1 as ontologically prior to the other: the three are always united in and constituted by the one; the one is always expressed in the three.Catherine LaCugna.

They are often referred to as the Buffalo Class following the naming of locomotive 1134. History These large tank locomotives, with their wheels and dia × stroke cylinders were capable of working trains on the main line. They followed on from George Armstrong's 1016 Class built from 1867, themselves derived from the earlier 302 Class of Joseph Armstrong, and were perpetuated by his successor William Dean until 1881. Modernised saddle tank locomotives of similar size were then produced in the 1813 Class. The first six were built with side tanks. The following locomotives had saddle tanks covering their boilers and fireboxes, but from 1874 longer saddle tank extending to the front of the smokebox were the norm. All the earlier locomotives were eventually fitted with these larger tanks. Most were reconstructed with pannier tanks from 1911 onwards. The first locomotives had just a spectacle plate to give protection for the crew, but then small cabs, open at the back, were fitted. Later on most of the surviving locomotives were given full cabs so that there was protection when running in reverse. Other changes to various locomotives over their long lives were Belpaire fireboxes, enlarged coal bunkers, and even superheaters. One or two were fitted with spark-arresting chimneys. 21 were fitted for working autotrains. =Broad gauge conversions= Locomotive 1256 with the last broad gauge service at Truro in 1892 Ten locomotives were built in 1876 with broad gauge wheels outside the standard double frames. Five more broad gauge locomotives were built in 1878, while from 1884 another 35 were converted from standard gauge to broad. All were eventually converted back to standard gauge. 1256 was one of a pair of locomotives that worked the last broad gauge train from back to Swindon for conversion on 20 May 1892.

The species is found in Central and Eastern Europe and West Asia. They are found in Greece, Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Jordan, Israel and Lebanon, and like others of the family show considerable variation with four or five subspecies. A morphologically similar species Archon apollinaris has been recently separated and has been found to be sympatric and reproductively isolated. Older individuals often lose their scales, especially on the forewings, and appear very transparent. The larvae feed on species of Aristolochia including A. poecilantha, A. parviflora, A. bodamae, A. hirta, A. bottae, A. auricularia, A. rotunda, A. sempervirens, A. maurorum and A. billardieri.

He fought with him in the Battle of Haldighati and died in 1576. In Haldighati Battle, he commanded an army of Afghans who were against the rising power of Mughal Empire. Biography Hakim Khan Suri was a member of the Sur dynasty and was a descendant of Sher Shah Suri, the founder of the Sur Empire. Hakim Khan was a seasoned Sur, who had his own axe to grind against the imperial motives of the Mughals. He found in Pratap an energetic, chivalrous and bold veteran hero, for whom the Mughal imperialism was a nuisance too. The Battle of Haldighati is widely but wrongly perceived as a Hindu-Muslim conflict, but this is not the case. Both armies had a mix of Hindus and Muslims. This was a struggle between the Mughal imperialism and Mewar. Whereas Hakim Khan Suri led the vanguard for Rana Pratap, Akbar's army was commanded by the Rajput chief of Jaipur, Man Singh I and half the Mughal army was composed of Rajput soldiers. Hakim Khan was part of the battle to exact revenge from the Mughals for the defeat of Sikandar Shah Suri, his forefather. Hakim Khan fighting with Maharana Pratap and Man Singh I along with Akbar, clearly establishes the fact that the battle of Haldighati was fought against imperialistic and expansionistic design, and it was not a communal one. He also served as the treasurer of Rana Pratap. Legacy Hakim Khan Suri occupies a high place in the annals of Mewar and an award of the Maharana Mewar Foundation bears his name. Hakim Khan Sur Award goes is given by the foundation to people for outstanding achievement and service to the nation. Every year a commemorative festival is held at Haldighati where his memorial is located.

Its most famous product was Cleeve's Toffee, a popular confectionery which continued to be sold in Ireland until the 1980s. Origins The business was established in 1883The Irish Times, \\"Prospectuses\\", 27 November 1897, (p.10) by Thomas Cleeve, a Canadian of English extraction. Cleeve first came to Ireland as a teenager to work for J. P. Evans & Co., a Limerick-based supplier of agricultural machinery owned by his uncle. Over the next 20 years Cleeve rose to become managing director of this company.Lee, David and Jacobs, Debbie, Made in Limerick Vol.1, History of industries, trade and commerce, Limerick Civic Trust, 2003 Through his contacts with Irish farmers, Cleeve saw the potential to process milk and manufacture dairy products for home consumption and export. Together with Edmond Russell,a local businessman, and William Beauchamp, a solicitor, Cleeve acquired Lansdowne, a site on the northern bank of the River Shannon. There, the partners set up a factory to produce condensed milk and butter. Early history In 1889, the business was incorporated as a private limited company. Within ten years 60,000 tins of condensed milk were being produced daily at its Limerick headquarters, with 10,000 cows providing the raw material. As the business expanded, Thomas Cleeve was joined by his four younger brothers who moved from Canada to help manage the company. They set up or acquired a chain of smaller creameries and factories throughout Munster. Branches were established in London and Liverpool to facilitate sales into the British market. By the end of the nineteenth century the Condensed Milk Company had 2,000 employees on its payroll and counted 3,000 farmers as suppliers of its raw material. Its exports reached practically every corner of the British Empire. The company's brands included \\"The Cup\\", \\"The Calf\\", \\"The Goat\\", \\"The Shamrock\\", and \\"Cleeve's Full Cream Milk\\". A separate factory in Limerick manufactured Cleeve's Toffee. Following the death of chairman Sir Thomas Cleeve in 1908, his brother, Frederick, became managing director, with William Beauchamp assuming the position of chairman. Business grew significantly following the outbreak of World War I in 1914, and employee numbers rose to 3,000. The Condensed Milk Company became a major supplier to British forces fighting in Europe. It was alleged after the war that company profits reached £1m during this period. Industrial and civil strife In 1917, the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union set up three branches in Limerick. Within a year the union had successfully recruited the Cleeve workforce as members. In 1919, the short-lived Limerick Soviet brought the company's headquarters at Lansdowne to a standstill. Even though normal business resumed at the factory, the stoppage was a turning point in the Cleeves' fortunes. Over the course of the next three years, the company faced an unprecedented array of challenges which threatened the continued viability of the business. Following the resumption of peace in Europe, the price of milk fell dramatically affecting company profits. On top of that, the War of Independence led to considerable damage being inflicted on many of the company's factories and creameries. Some of this damage was caused by Crown forces, despite the Cleeves being staunch Unionists. Other instances were seemingly the work of Irish Nationalists who saw the Condensed Milk Company as a symbol of British rule. The third challenge faced by the company lay in the radicalisation of sections of its workforce. For instance, in May 1920 at Knocklong, County Limerick, the workers decided to escalate a pay dispute by taking over the company's creamery in the town. They hoisted a red flag over the premises and erected a banner across the entrance which read \\"Knocklong Soviet Creamery, we make butter not profits.\\" The Cleeves conceded defeat after five days and granted retrospective wage increases to the workers. The success of the workers at Knocklong precipitated similar disputes at other Cleeve factories. By November 1923, the directors decided they could not continue and announced that the company was going into liquidation. Frederick Cleeve had stepped down as managing director several years earlier and was replaced by Sir Thomas Cleeve's son, Francis. The company was bought as a going concern by a syndicate of local businessmen led by Andrew O'Shaughnessy, a member of Dáil Éireann. Francis Cleeve remained on as managing director for another year to facilitate the transition. Decline Lansdowne factory, June 2005 In 1927, the Free State government established a new semi-state body, the Dairy Disposal Company, to regularise and rationalise the industry. The new body took over the Condensed Milk Company, by far the largest producer in the country, as well as other smaller concerns. The company continued to operate under State control until the early 1970s. At that stage, the government decided to break up the Dairy Disposal Company and transfer ownership of the creameries to a number of farmer co-operatives. In 1974, most of what remained of the Condensed Milk Company was sold to one of these, Golden Vale, subsequently a subsidiary of the Kerry Group.The Irish Times, \\"£1m. creamery take-over in Clare, 28 June 1974 The current owners continue to process milk at the Lansdowne factory and its tall chimney remains as one of Limerick's most distinctive landmarks.

It is situated around half a mile south of the village of Old Dailly, to the north-east of Girvan in south Ayrshire, Scotland. History The 16th-century tower was built by a branch of the Boyd family, relatives of the Earls of Kilmarnock, and extended several times. The original 16th-century square three-storey tower was extended in the 17th century to create an L-shaped building. The castle later fell into decline, becoming near ruinous by the early 19th century. Starting in 1857, the site was drastically restored and a modern wing added on the east.Penkill Castle site record at CANMORE. Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland The castle owner has been known as the Laird of Penkill, starting in the 16th century with Adam Boyd, 1st Laird of Penkill. The lairds were all men until the 14th Laird, the artist Alice Boyd, in the late 19th century. She is credited with extending the original castle grounds after she became laird. The 16th Laird of Penkill, Evelyn May Courtney-Boyd, was also the last; she sold Penkill Castle in the 1980s. It was bought by an American lawyer, Elton Eckstrand, who further restored it.Boyd, Richard G. \\"Penkill Castle\\". Clan Boyd International website. In 1992 Penkill was sold by Eckstrand to Scots-born Canadian businessman Don Brown, then subsequently in 1993 to the then HTV Wales chairman and TV producer and director Patrick Dromgoole, and thus remains in private hands. Penkill Castle played a minor part in the history of the British Pre-Raphaelite movement. In the late 1850s, the Pre-Raphaelite artist William Bell Scott began a liaison with Alice Boyd, whose brother was then the laird. Scott visited Penkill often and on one occasion painted a series of murals illustrating James I's poem The Kingis Quair in the staircase. Scott died at Penkill on 22 November 1890.

It is situated Kringsjå neighborhood of the Oslo, Norway, borough of Nordre Aker. Located from Stortinget, the station is served by Line 5 of the metro every fifteen minutes. Travel time to Stortinget is fifteen minutes. The station opened on 10 October 1934 at the same times as the rest of the Sognsvann Line. The station received a major upgrade in 1993, in which it received longer platforms and an overpass. The new station was designed by Arne Henriksen. Among the most used stations west of the city center, it derives its high ridership from two student dormitory complexes. History Tram at Kringsjå before the double track was installed in 1939 Construction of the Sognsvann Line started in 1933. It and Kringsjå Station were opened on 10 October 1934. At first the line was built with double track to Østhorn and single track to Sognsvann. Between 1937 and 1939, the upper section was converted to double track. Unlike further south along the line there was not as much construction of housing. The area around Kringsjå was mostly developed from the 1960s. Until 1970 there was a café at the station. Kringsjå Student City opened in 1970, followed by Fjellbirkeland Student City in 1990. East of the station there was also a major construction of condominiums and row housing since the 1960s. Kringsjå Studenty City in the background During the 1980s, the city decided to connect the four suburban lines west of the city center with the Oslo Metro. The Sognsvann Line was selected as the first line to be upgraded, so the two systems would become compatible. The line was upgraded to metro standard by replacing the overhead wire with a third-rail power supply and installing automatic train protection. From 4 April 1993 trains along the Sognsvann Line were connected to the eastern part of the metro, initially connected with the Østensjø Line. Service T1000 train pulling into the station in 2007 The station is served by Line 5 of the Oslo Metro. During regular hours, it operates at a 15-minute headway. Travel time to Stortinget is fifteen minutes. Operations are carried out by Sporveien T-banen on contract with Ruter, the public transport authority in Oslo and Akershus. The infrastructure itself is owned by Sporveien, a municipal company. Service is provided using MX3000 three- and six-car trains. The station had an average 2,066 boarding passengers in 2002, ranking second on the line. Only the University of Oslo campus station of Blindern has more. The high ridership derives from the large portion of students in the area, with about 2,400 students living within the station's catchment area. Kringsjå is located in fare zone 1. Facilities Kringsjå is a rapid transit station situated on the Sognsvann Line, from Stortinget in the city center. It is open ground station featuring two side platforms. The station meets the metro standard of the Oslo Metro. This includes two side platforms and an overpass.

The ancient parish of Wormingford on the south bank of the River Stour, north- west of Colchester and south-east of Sudbury, Suffolk, covered 2,322 acres (929 hectares). The Stour forms the northern boundary, and the eastern, southern, and western ones follow mainly field boundaries, but sometimes cut through fields. Detached fields totalling in Little Horkesley, were transferred to that parish in 1889. Wormingford has a post office and a public house and restaurant called The Crown. Most of the parish lies on a relatively high plain which drains northwards to the River Stour and southwards to the River Colne. From the Stour the ground rises southwards to reach a height of more than 225 ft (70 m) in the south-west. A band of alluvium runs beside the Stour and there are river terrace deposits south of that, then, as the ground rises, bands of London clay, and sands and gravels. Most of the higher south part of the parish is boulder clay, good farming land, with a small pocket of sands and gravels running south-east from Wood Hall. Wormingford Mere of is a natural feature formed by the Stour. The main road from Colchester to Bures and Sudbury (B1508) runs from south-east to north-west across the parish. Minor roads connected the parish with Assington (Suffolk) across Wormingford bridge, with Fordham, and with Little Horkesley and Nayland (Suffolk). Other minor roads and tracks and a network of footpaths link the scattered farms and houses. The ford from which the parish takes its name (originally 'Withermund's ford') was probably that in the river Stour by the watermill, at the bottom of Church Road, where there is a sand bank in the middle of the river. A ford further east near Garnons has also been suggested, but seems less likely. The Church Road ford was replaced before 1802 by a bridge, called a horse-bridge in 1812. About 1821 Messrs. Jones, who leased the river tolls, built a new bridge, apparently a narrow wooden footbridge. It collapsed in the winter of 1895–6 and was replaced by an iron bridge in 1898. The modern form of the place name, recorded from 1254, gave rise to three stories of dragons, ('worm' meaning serpent or dragon). The first story says the village is the location where the patron saint of England, St George, killed his dragon; a mound in the village is said to cover the body of the legendary dragon. The second, also unsubstantiated, is that a crocodile escaped from Richard I of England's menagerie in the Tower of London and caused much damage in Wormingford before being killed by Sir George Marney; a stained glass window in the parish church (St Andrew's) depicts this legend. The third, written in 1405 by John de Trokelowe, a monk, told of a dragon who threatened Richard Waldegrave's territory near Sudbury but fled into the Mere when pursued. A large number of scattered archaeological finds from all periods from the Neolithic suggest that settlement was first on the flood plain, alongside the Stour, before woodland on the higher ground further south was gradually cleared. Prehistoric tools were found in the complex of ring ditches and other crop marks near the Mere in the north-west of the parish; when a Bronze Age barrow nearby was destroyed in 1836 'hundreds of urns in rows' were found. The artist John Constable of East Bergholt (1776–1837), had Wormingford associations, his relatives farming at Wormingford Hall and Gernons. John Nash R.A., who lived at Bottengoms, painted in and around the village from 1929 until 1977. Wormingford Air Field Originally a relief airfield for biplanes in the First World War, the airfield was expanded by Richard Costain Ltd and a number of sub-contractors during the period 1942/43. Earmarked for an Eighth Heavy Bomb Group, nothing ever came of this and at the end of November 1943 the yet to be completed station was handed to the Ninth Air Force for use by one of its Fighter Groups. On 30 November, the 362nd Fighter Group arrived at Wormingford. The Group was assigned to the 70th Fighter Wing. It did not fly its first mission until 8 February 1944. Its operational status at Wormingford was a short one and they left on 8 April 1944. During its stay, the 362nd mounted over 30 missions, losing five aircraft. The next group to move in was the 55th Fighter Group with its P-38 Lightnings from Nuthampstead in Hertfordshire. The 55th's role as a fighter group was to be a short one due to some of the disadvantages of the aircraft. However, the 55th later become renowned for ground strafing and ground attack bombing. On D-Day, the P-38 groups were given the task of acting as convoy escorts for the armada of ships moving to and from Normandy. The 55th was selected to serve with the occupation forces in Germany and in July 1945 it left Wormingford for Gielbelstadt airfield in Bavaria. The old airfield is now used by the Essex and Suffolk Gliding Club.  Wormingford Cricket Club  The cricket club has been a part of the village for many years. The team currently plays in the PDQ North division, which it joined in 1976 then rejoined in 1991.

It is the eighth episode of the third series, and the 25th episode overall. Dermot Morgan, who played the show's title character, died the day after filming was completed. Synopsis Father Kevin falls victim to depression. After Ted prevents a depressed Father Kevin (Tommy Tiernan) from jumping to his death at the \\"It's Great Being a Priest\\" conference, an American priest, Father Buzz Cagney (Jeff Harding), asks him if he will come to a parish in Los Angeles. Ted cannot wait and excitedly tells Jack, Dougal and Mrs. Doyle, who incorrectly think they will be able to come with him. Ted does not have the heart to tell them otherwise and brings them to the airport, leaving them there while he gets on the plane. However, Ted has second thoughts when Buzz mentions the gang culture around Ted's new parish in Los Angeles and its violent state. Realising he is in serious trouble, Ted abandons going on his trip and rejoins Jack, Dougal and Mrs Doyle. It transpires that the three of them never wanted to go to the States anyway, with the possible exception of Jack, who yells 'Feck!' when he learns of what has gone wrong, though the promise of a drink cheers him up. The group leaves the airport and heads for home, and Ted resigns himself to the fact he is probably never going to escape Craggy Island. The scene then transits to the montage of all the events in the series and ends with Ted and Dougal wishing each others a good night sleep. =Alternate ending= The episode was always intended to be the last Father Ted; in the original script, the last scene was to be set at the \\"It's Still Great Being a Priest\\" conference with Father Kevin once again on the window ledge and once again Ted arriving on the ledge, except this time it is not to stop him from jumping but to join him, because he was depressed that the intended trip to America fell through and he would have to stay on Craggy Island forever. This ending was abandoned in favour of a montage of clips from all three series of the show. This was for a two fold reason; the writers thought their ending would not work, and by virtue, Dermot's death occurring pushed them into dropping the ending, due to the idea now seeming especially tacky.Father Ted - The Definitive Collection.

Polk (1845-1849) President Andrew Johnson (1865-1869) The Tennessee Democratic Party is the branch of the US Democratic Party in Tennessee. It was founded in 1826. TDP traces its roots to President Andrew Jackson's populist philosophy that government should belong to the \\"common man\\". In the 1960s, the Democratic Party in the South turned away from its post-Civil War support of the Jim Crow system and toward civil rights for all. In the twenty-first century it asserts that government should be run by and for citizens of every race, age, gender, religion and condition. Tennessee delegation of the Democratic National Committee The delegation of each state to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) consists of the highest-ranking elected male and female persons within the state's Democratic Party. In 2018 these were Mary Mancini and John Litz. As determined by DNC rules, Tennessee was allowed three additional members, elected by the Tennessee Democratic Executive Committee for a four-year term. National party rules call for elections to be held during the calendar year in which a Democratic National Convention is held. The Tennessee delegation is expected to represent Tennessee on all matters before the committee.Tennessee Democratic Party =Responsibilities of the National Committee= * Electing the National Party Chair and other National Party Officers * Issuing the call to the national convention * Conducting the party's presidential campaign * Formulating and disseminating statements of party policy * Setting the DNC's budget and conducting all other business Issues =Children and families= Political issues include infant mortality in Memphis, which sports one of the country's highest rates. During the 111th Congress Congressman Steve Cohen authorized a resolution that passed the House. This resolution urged a stronger national commitment to ending infant mortality. H.R 3962, the Affordable Health Care for America Act includes the Newborn Act. This act would create 15 national pilot programs in cities across the nation like Memphis. The act would provide resources for more research and educational programs aimed at helping women get prenatal care during pregnancy and delivery. x Another issue is the reform of foster care. Congressman Jim Cooper serves on the board of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute (CCAI) in order to try to improve conditions for foster children. =Health care= In 2009 the Affordable Care Act was enacted by unanimous vote of Democrats, including Tennessee Democrats. Tennessee Democrats sponsored the Medicare Information Act. This act makes sure that every taxpayer receives information on their Medicare contributions. =Energy and environment= TDP asserts that US energy policies pose economic, national security and environmental threats. It believes that the US is too dependent on foreign oil. Cooper claimed that instead of sending money overseas to countries we are unfriendly with, we should consider other options. Tennessee Democrats supported the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water Protection Act and the Clean Air Act. Others include: the 10 Million Solar Roofs Act, American Clean Energy and Security Act, American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the Radioactive Import Deterrence Act, Grand Canyon Water Sheds Protection Act, Nonnative Wildlife Invasion Prevention Act, the Northern Rockies Ecosystem Protection Act, the Safe Markets Development Act, the Retrofit for Energy and Environmental Performance Program Act, and the America's Red Rock Wilderness Act. =National security= Tennessee Democrats believe in a strong national defense supported by necessary resources. National security policies that Tennessee Democrats have approved of include, the Panel on Defense and Acquisition Reform, which has investigated budget overruns in weapons procurement. This work helped to enact the Weapons Acquisition Reform Act of 2009. Tennessee Democrats support the National Urban Search and Rescue System Act. This act combines the authorization of the National Urban Search and Rescue program and put its authority in one section of the Stafford Act. Doing so would help to make sure that Urban Search and Rescue can efficiently respond to a wide range of national disasters. The bill provides Urban Search and Rescue Task Force members with uniform workers compensation and tort liability protection under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act. =Transportation= Tennessee Democrats supported the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Others include the American Coastal Waters and Shorelines Protection Act, which would ban foreign vessels from oil drilling activities in American coastal waters. The Critical Infrastructure Earthquake Preparedness Act directs the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to create a grant program that will improve the ability of trauma center hospitals and airports to withstand earthquakes. =Education= Since the end of World War II, education has been a top priority for Tennessee state government. Education is typically the highest priority of candidates in legislative races. Decisions on education at the state level affect more people, create more emotion, and have greater long term political consequences. Education in Tennessee (including pension and health care benefits) is the largest segment of the state budget.

It operates some 92 buses and 74 trolleybuses on 25 daytime routes, as well as 5 overnight services (known as Nachstern) and one funicular service. History VBL dates back to December 1899, when a tramway was opened in the city, which at the time had a population of around 30,000. This tramway was completed in 1903, when it reached 11.3 km in length. Over the period 1909–1936, the tramway was extended to the Emmenbrücke and Kriens areas. The late 1920s and early 1930s saw the first bus services being introduced to the city. Initial proposals for a trolleybus system in 1938 were rejected by the citizens of Lucerne, however further proposals in 1941 were met with a far more positive response, and the first line was opened between Lucerne station and Allmend. Trolleybuses gradually replaced trams in the city, and the tramway was finally closed in 1961. The Lucerne trolleybus system was upgraded in 1965/66 with the introduction of 14 new articulated trolleybuses. The 1970s revolutionised the way tickets were bought on the bus and trolleybus networks, with most now being purchased from roadside vending machines. In the 1980s several motorbus lines were converted to trolleybuses. The fleet was upgraded in 1985 with the purchase of 54 new vehicles. A new fare system was introduced in 1991, with the network being divided into various zones. In the same year, VBL took delivery of 4 new articulated trolleybuses and 6 articulated motorbuses. The start of the 21st century brought with it a large intake of new vehicles, with both motorbuses and trolleybuses being delivered. VBL now boasts a very modern fleet, with the Mercedes-Benz Citaro comprising a large portion of the bus fleet.

Catteries come in two varieties – boarding catteries and breeding catteries. In the USA, the terms used are boarding kennel and breeding kennel.  Boarding cattery  Rockwell Cattery A boarding cattery is where cats are housed temporarily, when they cannot stay at their owners' home. Boarding catteries (cat boarding kennels) are mostly used by owners who are away on holiday, although they may also be used during house moves, building work or when their owners are incapacitated, for example if they have to go into hospital. Cats must be adequately looked after, otherwise the owner(s) of the cattery may face legal action by the law or cat protection bodies such as the RSPCA if the owner(s) of the cat feel that it be necessary. All establishments boarding cats within the United Kingdom are required to be licensed and inspected by the local authority's Environmental Health department under the Animal Boarding Establishments Act 1963. Licensed establishments will have a copy of their licence prominently displayed as part of their conditions of licence. A veterinary surgeon (vet) will not be deemed to keep a boarding establishment for cats so long as the cat is at the time receiving treatment by the veterinary surgeon and the boarding is a requirement of the treatment. A vet will be deemed to be keeping a boarding establishment if, at the time of boarding, the cat is not under treatment or required to board as part of that treatment. If the boarding facility is advertised as ancillary to the vet's main business, the establishment will need to be licensed and inspected by their local authority and meet the conditions as per any other boarding establishment. In determining whether to grant a licence for the keeping of a boarding establishment for animals by any person at any premises, a local authority shall in particular pay regard to the following: # that cats will at all times be kept in accommodation suitable as respects construction, size of quarters, number of occupants, exercising facilities, temperature, lighting, ventilation and cleanliness # that cats will be adequately supplied with suitable food, drink and bedding material, adequately exercised / stimulated, and (so far as necessary) visited at suitable intervals # that all reasonable precautions will be taken to prevent and control the spread among cats of infectious or contagious diseases, including the provision of adequate isolation facilities # that appropriate steps will be taken for the protection of the cats in case of fire or other emergency # that a register – either hard or soft copy – be kept, containing a description of any cats received into the establishment, date of arrival and departure, and the name and address of the owner; such register is to be available for inspection at all times by an officer of the local authority, vet or veterinary practitioner authorised by the local authority. International Cat Care (ICC), a long-established cat charity in the United Kingdom, has defined standards for the construction and management of boarding catteries. ICC standards are in addition to those set by local councils for licensing purposes.  Breeding cattery  A breeding cattery is where cats are bred. Cats may be bred as a hobby, or on a commercial basis where they are sold for profit. In the United States, there are two main cat registries – the Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) and The International Cat Association (TICA) which establish standards for member breeders. These cat registries also award certificates for catteries that have been inspected for healthy environments. Additionally, many U.S. States and municipalities, along with the Federal government, provide some regulations of breeding catteries. In Europe the standards are established by the Fédération Internationale Féline (FIFe) or World Cat Federation (WCF). In Italy by the Associazione Nazionale Felina Italiana (ANFI).

Operation  A typical bamboo cannon consists of a large bamboo node or tube containing some water to which a little calcium carbide is added. The carbide reacts immediately with the water releasing acetylene gas, which has the widest range of explosive limit of any common chemical and a very low ignition energy. A sharp report is produced when a flame is introduced into the bamboo chamber. However, the low density of the acetylene/air mixture is such that the total combustion energy is quite low and weak containers such as bamboo or even glass rarely shatter. Adding too much carbide does not increase the energy of the explosion but instead weakens it due to high fuel to air ratio. After the shot, fresh air is needed in the tube in order to have another explosion after more carbide is added. The operating principle also works with other combustible fuels besides acetylene, but since most others have narrower explosive limits, the effect is not as reliable. Common examples are solvent-containing aerosol consumer products such as spray paint or hairspray. Less-volatile fuels can also work, with skill, such as 200ml of hot kerosene, poured into a small hole near the breech of the cannon. A lighting stick is used to ignite the fumes and fire the cannon, then fresh air is blown into the small hole and the cannon fired again. The bamboo used for this is usually around 4 to 6 inches in diameter and 4 to 5 feet long. Indonesia In Indonesia bamboo cannon is traditional game played by children. It was very popular in the 1990s. Nowadays, it's still played by children in rural areas, where the material (bamboo) is widely available. In West Kalimantan, on the banks of the Kapuas river, there are Bamboo Cannon Festivals, which are celebrated a week before Idul Fitri. The biggest bamboo cannon in Indonesia broke records of Indonesian World Record Museum (MURI) in 2007 and again 2009. Malaysia Like other fireworks, bamboo cannons are illegal as stated in Malaysian Explosive Act 1957; more Malay children turn to the more dangerous bamboo cannon as an alternative to commercial firecrackers which were banned by the government.  Philippines  A boga made of tin cans with igniter attached The boga or PVC cannon is a noisemaker popular during New Year celebrations in the Philippines. The boga is operated in much the same way as a bamboo cannon, but is held in the manner of a rocket launcher. Originating in the province of Cavite, use of the device has been banned by the Philippine government since 2006. Originating from the province of Cavite, the device is made from a length of pipe of substantial diameter mated to a toy gun. Denatured alcohol (sometimes paint thinner or acetone) is squirted or sprayed into the pipe's breech end and ignited by the toy gun's trigger mechanism which is connected to a piezo igniter or by putting small fire. The combination of air and flammable fuel in the pipe's enclosed space when ignited by a spark from the trigger mechanism or by small fire causes the fuel-air mixture to combust, resulting in a loud, booming sound. The first prototype is made from segmented tin cans connected with packaging tapes or electrical tapes and cut PET bottles (which is still used) and later design is made of PVC pipes. Other modifications of boga are introduced such as firing round projectiles which can be used as a weapon and pet bottles as breech end. In the Philippine city of Kidapawan, North Cotabato, the Kanyóng Kawayan Festival is held from 14-20 December to promote safer noisemaking alternatives during the Christmas season. Empty powdered milk cans are common projectiles used in the city-wide contest held during the event. A variant form, known as bong-bong, is used by the people of Mangaldan, Pangasinan, but with water and motor oil as the fuel. =Ban and injuries= The Department of Health has repeatedly warned against use of the noisemaker, which they deem to be dangerous as its use carries a risk of blast or burn injury. A ban was ordered on 27 December 2005 against the use of the devices for the impending New Year celebrations. Officials cited a variety of possible injuries from use of the device, mostly involving delayed explosions to the facial region resulting in eye injury, among others. Post-traumatic conjunctivitis was cited as one of the noted effects. Users of the device mostly are children and teenage boys, tend to prematurely open the boga whenever it fails to fire, causing any delayed blasts to fire upon the unsuspecting user's face. Of 178 firecracker-related injuries recorded for the 2006 season (as of December 28) so far, eighteen percent were confirmed to have been caused by use of boga. In December 2007, health department officials maintained the ban on the devices, reminding the public with press releases, flyers and awareness campaigns. Africa The practice is also present in Africa. In Ghana, they are called Pampuro Tuo and are used during the Christmas and New Year’s holidays. Many African countries, and Africans in the diaspora, including Jamaica and Haiti have similar practices. Australia The PVC cannon is a prohibited weapon in the Australian state of New South Wales, along with other devices which are designed to propel or launch a bomb, grenade, rocket or missile by any means other than an explosive.WEAPONS PROHIBITION ACT 1998 (NSW) Sched 1, s.2(3).

The game consisted of an overhead projector which displayed moving targets behind a background; players would fire at the targets with a rifle, in which a mechanism of reflections would determine whether or not the \\"laser shot\\" from the rifle hit the target. The concept behind the Laser Clay Shooting System came from Hiroshi Yamauchi, while Gunpei Yokoi was behind the development of the system. It was released in deserted bowling alleys in Japan in 1973; upon release, it was a commercial success. However, the success of the system quickly evaporated as a result of the 1973 oil crisis and the ensuing recession in Japan, which left Nintendo billion in debt and on the verge of bankruptcy. In 1974, Yamauchi, in an attempt to revive Nintendo, released a smaller, cheaper version of the Laser Clay Shooting System, titled \\"Mini Laser Clay\\". Deployed mostly in arcades, players shoot moving targets, provided by a 16mm film projector, at an arcade cabinet. This system featured several games and achieved significant success for Nintendo throughout the mid to late 1970s, which helped the company out of its financial situation. Overview The Laser Clay Shooting System was a shooting simulation that were present in many former bowling alleys in Japan. In the simulation, players fire their laser rifles at moving targets produced by an overhead projector. A series of reflections determines whether or not the target was hit by the \\"laser shot\\"; when a hit is registered, the projector displays a picture of a destroyed target.Gorges, p. 182. The Laser Clay Shooting System was redesigned in 1974 and was renamed \\"Mini Laser Clay\\". This game would be displayed in arcades as opposed to bowling alleys. Mini Laser Clay consisted of two shooting ranges in which up to four players could play simultaneously. Players would pay to shoot ten clay pigeons with two shots per pigeon; players would \\"pull\\" each clay pigeon by stepping on a button near their feet. High scores would earn players tokens which could be exchanged for prizes.Gorges, p. 184. Cheaper models of Mini Laser Clay featured single players who would shoot targets, projected by a 16mm film, at an arcade cabinet with a revolver.Gorges, p. 186. History The idea for the Laser Clay Shooting System Game started in 1971, when Hiroshi Yamauchi read a newspaper article about shooting (also referred to as \\"Ball Trap\\") competitions. He then asked his assistant Gunpei Yokoi about the possibility of using their current product, the \\"Opto-Electronic Gun SP\\", for shooting simulations. Days after Yamauchi's request, Yokoi asked Yamauchi to buy him a rifle for the purposes of designing an \\"electronic Ball Trap simulation\\" by using the rifle as a prototype. Assisting in the development were Masayuki Uemura and Genyo Takeda. The project was approved in 1971 and was dubbed the \\"Laser Clay Shooting System\\". Advertisements for The Laser Clay Shooting System often featured Japanese actor and martial arts expert Sonny Chiba. Yamauchi wanted to see shooting simulations developed in deserted bowling alleys in Japan; bowling in Japan was a 1960s fad which was replaced by Karaoke by the end of that decade. The first Laser Clay Shooting System was unveiled to the public in early 1973, despite technical setbacks which were fixed in extremis on the same day it was unveiled. Nintendo proceeded to buy out deserted bowling alleys in various strategic locations, in which they were fitted with the simulation system. Costing between and million to install, each system included overhead projectors which displayed airborne targets behind a mountainous or forest landscape, and a mechanism that consisted of reflections which detected whether or not the \\"laser shot\\" hit the flying target on the projector. Yamauchi was successful in the first few weeks of operation, as his \\"test locations\\" were running at capacity. In February 1973, with imminent success of the Laser Clay Shooting System, Yamauchi established a new Nintendo subsidiary, Nintendo Leisure System Co., Ltd., to handle the maintenance and orders of the system. He then continued to buy out more former bowling alleys and fitted them with Laser Clay Shooting Systems, and the subsidiary had many pre-orders for them. As a result, the factories dedicated to building these systems were running at capacity around the clock in order to meet public demand. Advertising for the Laser Clay Shooting System featured Japanese actor and martial artist Sonny Chiba.Gorges. pp. 182–183. However, in October, 1973, OPEC dramatically raised the price in oil, which would eventually trigger the 1973 oil crisis. As a result, the Japanese economy, which imported over 98% of their requirements for oil, was forced to scale back on all unnecessary amenities in anticipation of an imminent recession. As a result, Nintendo received cancellation requests of the Laser Clay Shooting System from its clients, and, in less than a year, nearly all of its orders were cancelled. Having invested billions of Yen in their product, Nintendo's profits were cut in half, and they found themselves billion in debt, in which Yamauchi would spend 7 years paying off. Yamauchi would cancel his \\"electronic Ball Trap\\" project as a result, and Nintendo's future was uncertain. What kept Nintendo (and Yamauchi) going was that they were listed on the stock market, and Nintendo still had to answer to shareholders, some of whom continued their support of the floundering company.Gorges. pp. 183–184. In 1974, as Laser Clay had still maintained some popularity in Japan, Yamauchi redesigned the Laser Clay Shooting System into a smaller and cheaper version, and dubbed it \\"Mini Laser Clay\\". This redesigned system was intended for arcades. Yamauchi pitched to professionals: \\"With such a machine in your arcade venue, you will undoubtedly draw the attention of the whole neighbourhood.\\" Since orders from arcades were low, Nintendo needed cheaper methods to make the product. As a result, Yokoi came up with the idea of using 16mm projectors and video; this allowed the system to be sold in the form of arcade cabinets.Gorges. pp. 184, 186. In 1974, Wild Gunman, the first game of its kind, was released. Alongside Wild Gunman, Nintendo designed an adult version of the game titled Fascination; instead of cowboys, the game featured a Swedish woman in an evening dress who would dance around on the projection. Then, when the women struck a pose, players would shoot off key parts of her clothing until she was completely nude. However, the game was never released to the general public. While the Mini Laser Clay system started slow, Nintendo eventually garnered sufficient sales, and they continued to sell the system to more arcades. In 1976, Shooting Trainer was released on this system, attracting many international players; this was followed by New Shooting Trainer in 1978. Other games released for the Mini Laser Clay system included Sky Hawk (1976), Battle Shark (1977), and Test Driver (1977).Gorges. pp. 186, 188. Some sources say that Duck Hunt (1976) was part of the Laser Clay Shooting System, while others say that it was part of the \\"Nintendo Beam Gun Series\\" – a separate project to bring shooting simulations into the home. According to Gizmodo, it was part of a revamping of the Laser Clay Shooting System.

Biography The son of Mark Perry Ansorge and Jennie Bach Ansorge, Martin Ansorge was born into a Jewish household in Corning, Steuben County, New York on January 1, 1882. He attended the public schools and the College of the City of New York. He graduated from Columbia College of Columbia University in 1903 and Columbia Law School in 1906. He was admitted to the bar in 1906 and commenced practice in Manhattan, New York City.  Start of political career  Ansorge was the unsuccessful Republican candidate for election to Congress in 1912, 1914, and 1916. In his bid for the 21st District Congressional Seat in 1916, Ansorge's campaign slogan was \\"Feed America First\\", advocating the necessity of an embargo upon shipment abroad of foodstuffs needed for the consumption of American people, taking a stand on international trade negotiations and import tariffs post World War I. He declined the Republican nomination for Congress in 1918. World War I During the First World War Ansorge enlisted as a private in the United States Army. He was assigned to the Motor Transport Corps; Ansorge was stationed at Camp Meigs in what is now the Brentwood neighborhood of Washington, D.C., and intended to serve in France. The armistice took place before he left the country, and he was honorably discharged at the end of the war. Continued political career He was the first chairman of the Triborough Bridge Committee, a position he held from 1918 to 1921. Ansorge was elected as a Republican to the 67th United States Congress (March 4, 1921 - March 3, 1923). He lost reelection to the 68th United States Congress in 1922 by the margin of 345 votes, and unsuccessfully contested the victory of Royal H. Weller. In the contest proceedings, he won dismissal of an injunction prevent the opening of the ballot boxes; the subsequent recount reduced Weller's margin of victory, but Weller won the seat by 10 votes. As a Congressman, Ansorge was influential in the passing of the first-ever anti- lynching legislation. His writing of legislation on the matter was eventually included into the ultimately successful Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill, which prohibited lynching in America. Shortly after Ansorge's much heralded speech on the floor of Congress in support of the controversial Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill, Butler wrote to Ansorge \\"You are making a fine and highly patriotic record in the House, and your friends are proud of you\\". As founder of the Young Republicans at Columbia University, Ansorge was a protoge, close friend, and political ally of then Columbia University President Nicholas Murray Butler. The two remained very close for years, and Ansorge was staff to Butler at the Republican Convention. Ansorge spoke on behalf of Butler at a number of political rallies in New York. Ansorge was co-author of the original Port Authority Bill, which he shepherded successfully through Congress. He was an active leader in efforts to develop \\"the greatest port in the world\\" connecting New York and New Jersey. He presented the bill to President Calvin Coolidge to sign into law. The pen stayed in the Ansorge family for some years until it was given to the City Museum of New York. In 1922, Ansorge nominated the first African-American to the U.S. Naval Academy. Later career Ansorge was an unsuccessful candidate for judge of the court of general sessions of New York City in 1924 and unsuccessful candidate for justice of the supreme court of New York in 1927 and in 1928. The New York Times made mention of Ansorge as a candidate for Mayor of New York City in 1949. Ansorge continued to practice law in New York City, was a member of the board of directors of United Air Lines from 1934 to 1961. He represented Henry Ford in the Aaron Sapiro libel lawsuit, which resulted in Ford's apologies and agreement to pay court costs. Death and burial Ansorge died at his apartment in the Ansonia Hotel at 74th Street and Broadway in Manhattan, New York City on February 4, 1967. He was interred in Temple Israel Cemetery, Hastings-on-Hudson, New York.

His last known club was Hednesford Town, whom he departed in 2010. Career A former Aston Villa trainee, Brock spent three years as a professional at Villa Park, but never made a first team appearance. He joined Northampton Town in March 1997, but once again failed to make the first team. At the end of the 1996–1997 season, he was released, where he joined Football Conference side Kidderminster Harriers. He became Harriers number one soon after, going on to play over 150 times for the Aggborough club. He won the Conference title with Harriers in 2000-2001 - despite having to battle for the number one jersey with the vastly experienced Tim Clarke - and made twenty six appearances as they romped to the title. After falling down the pecking order during the 2003–2004 season, Brock left Kidderminster in the summer of 2004, joining Halesowen Town. His stay was brief - a week - before he became one of AFC Telford United's first ever signings in July 2004. In his three years at the New Bucks Head, he played over 100 times, making him the reformed club's highest appearance maker, and won two promotions. Sandwiched in between were two more goes at professional football; firstly, in October 2004, Peter Taylor's Hull City came calling, with Brock spending a month on loan at the KC Stadium as cover for regular keeper (and another ex- Villa trainee) Boaz Myhill. He also trialled for League Two side Oxford United in early 2005, playing in a reserve game for the Kassam Stadium side. After clinching promotion to Conference North via the Northern Premier League play- offs in 2006–2007, Telford brought in Hednesford's Ryan Young, immediately relegating Brock to the stands. He was allowed to leave in November 2007, joining Southern League Premier Division strugglers Bromsgrove Rovers for a short spell, before dropping down a further level to link up with Dean Edwards at Willenhall Town, where he saw out the 2007–2008 season.

This is one of civilization's earliest forms of decoration, dating back at least 7,000 years to the oldest known human societies in Mesopotamia and Egypt. The art has taken many forms throughout the centuries, from the simple beadwork of ancient times to the sophisticated metalworking and gem cutting known in the modern day. Before an article of jewellery is created, design concepts are rendered followed by detailed technical drawings generated by a jewellery designer, a professional who is trained in the architectural and functional knowledge of materials, fabrication techniques, composition, wearability and market trends. Traditional hand-drawing and drafting methods are still utilized in designing jewellery, particularly at the conceptual stage. However, a shift is taking place to computer-aided design programs like Rhinoceros 3D and Matrix. Whereas the traditionally hand-illustrated jewel is typically translated into wax or metal directly by a skilled craftsman, a CAD model is generally used as the basis for a CNC cut or 3D printed 'wax' pattern to be used in the rubber molding or lost wax casting processes. Once conceptual/ideation is complete, the design is rendered and fabricated using the necessary materials for proper adaptation to the function of the object. For example, 24K gold was used in ancient jewellery design because it was more accessible than silver as source material. Before the 1st century many civilizations also incorporated beads into jewellery. Once the discovery of gemstones and gem cutting became more readily available, the art of jewellery ornamentation and design shifted. The earliest documented gemstone cut was done by Theophilus Presbyter (c. 1070–1125), who practiced and developed many applied arts and was a known goldsmith. Later, during the 14th century, medieval lapidary technology evolved to include cabochons and cameos. Early jewellery design commissions were often constituted by nobility or the church to honor an event or as wearable ornamentation. Within the structure of early methods, enameling and repoussé became standard methods for creating ornamental wares to demonstrate wealth, position, or power. These early techniques created a specific complex design element that later would forge the Baroque movement in jewellery design. Traditionally, jewels were seen as sacred and precious; however, beginning in the 1900s, jewellery has started to be objectified. Additionally, no one trend can be seen as the history of jewellery design for this time period. Throughout the 20th century jewellery design underwent drastic and continual style changes: Art Nouveau (1900–1918), Art Deco (1919–1929), International Style & organicism (1929–1946), New Look & Pop (1947–1967), Globalization, Materialism, and Minimalism. Jewellery design trends are highly affected by the economic and social states of the time. The boundaries of styles and trends tend to blur together and the clear stylistic divisions of the past are harder to see during the 20th century.

Each print depicts a different stage in the life of the fictional Tom Nero. Beginning with the torture of a dog as a child in the First stage of cruelty, Nero progresses to beating his horse as a man in the Second stage of cruelty, and then to robbery, seduction, and murder in Cruelty in perfection. Finally, in The reward of cruelty, he receives what Hogarth warns is the inevitable fate of those who start down the path Nero has followed: his body is taken from the gallows after his execution as a murderer and is mutilated by surgeons in the anatomical theatre. The prints were intended as a form of moral instruction; Hogarth was dismayed by the routine acts of cruelty he witnessed on the streets of London. Issued on cheap paper, the prints were destined for the lower classes. The series shows a roughness of execution and a brutality that is untempered by the funny touches common in Hogarth's other works, but which he felt was necessary to impress his message on the intended audience. Nevertheless, the pictures still carry the wealth of detail and subtle references that are characteristic of Hogarth. History In common with other prints by Hogarth, such as Beer Street and Gin Lane, The Four Stages of Cruelty was issued as a warning against immoral behaviour, showing the easy path from childish thug to convicted criminal. His aim was to correct \\"that barbarous treatment of animals, the very sight of which renders the streets of our metropolis so distressing to every feeling mind\\". Hogarth loved animals, picturing himself with his pug in a self-portrait, and marking the graves of his dogs and birds at his home in Chiswick. Hogarth deliberately portrayed the subjects of the engravings with little subtlety since he meant the prints to be understood by \\"men of the lowest rank\\" when seen on the walls of workshops or taverns. The images themselves, as with Beer Street and Gin Lane, were roughly drawn, lacking the finer lines of some of his other works. Fine engraving and delicate artwork would have rendered the prints too expensive for the intended audience, and Hogarth also believed a bold stroke could portray the passions of the subjects just as well as fine lines, noting that \\"neither great correctness of drawing or fine engraving were at all necessary\\".Quoted in Uglow, p.506. To ensure that the prints were priced within reach of the intended audience, Hogarth originally commissioned the block-cutter J. Bell to produce the four designs as woodcuts. This proved more expensive than expected, so only the last two of the four images were cut and were not issued commercially at the time. Instead, Hogarth proceeded to create the engravings himself and announced the publication of the prints, along with that of Beer Street and Gin Lane, in the London Evening Post over three days from 14 to 16 February 1751. The prints themselves were published on 21 February 1751 and each was accompanied by a moralising commentary, written by the Rev. James Townley, a friend of Hogarth's. As with earlier engravings, such as Industry and Idleness, individual prints were sold on \\"ordinary\\" paper for 1s. (one shilling, equating to about £ in terms), cheap enough to be purchased by the lower classes as a means of moral instruction. \\"Fine\\" versions were also available on \\"superior\\" paper for 1s. 6d. (one shilling and sixpence, about £ in terms) for collectors. Variations on plates III and IV exist from Bell's original woodcuts, bearing the earlier date of 1 January 1750, and were reprinted in 1790 by John Boydell, but examples from either of the woodcut printings are uncommon. Prints =First stage of cruelty= First stage of cruelty (Plate I) In the first print Hogarth introduces Tom Nero, whose surname may have been inspired by the Roman Emperor of the same name or a contraction of \\"No hero\\". Conspicuous in the centre of the plate, he is shown being assisted by other boys to insert an arrow into a dog's rectum, a torture apparently inspired by a devil punishing a sinner in Jacques Callot's Temptation of St. Anthony. An initialled badge on the shoulder of his light-hued and ragged coat shows him to be a pupil of the charity school of the parish of St Giles. Hogarth used this notorious slum area as the background for many of his works including Gin Lane and Noon, part of the Four Times of the Day series. A more tender-hearted boy, perhaps the dog's owner, pleads with Nero to stop tormenting the frightened animal, even offering food in an attempt to appease him. This boy supposedly represents a young George III. His appearance is deliberately more pleasing than the scowling ugly ruffians that populate the rest of the picture, made clear in the text at the bottom of the scene: { style=\\"font-style:italic; font-size:90%; text- align:center\\"  While various Scenes of sportive Woe, The Infant Race employ, And Victims bleeding shew, The Tyrant in the Boy.  Behold! a Youth of gentler Heart, To spare the Creature's pain, O take, he cries—take all my Tart, But Tears and Tart are vain.  Learn from this fair Example—You Whom savage Sports delight, How Cruelty disgusts the view, While Pity charms the sight. } The young \\"George III\\" The other boys carry out equally barbaric acts: the two boys at the top of the steps are burning the eyes out of a bird with a hot needle heated by the link-boy's torch; the boys in the foreground are throwing at a cock (perhaps an allusion to a nationalistic enmity towards the French, and a suggestion that the action takes place on Shrove Tuesday, the traditional day for cock-shying); another boy ties a bone to a dog's tail—tempting, but out of reach; a pair of fighting cats are hung by their tails and taunted by a jeering group of boys; in the bottom left-hand corner a dog is set on a cat, with the latter's intestines spilling out onto the ground; and in the rear of the picture another cat tied to two bladders is thrown from a high window. In a foreshadowing of his ultimate fate, Tom Nero's name is written under the chalk drawing of a man hanging from the gallows; the meaning is made clear by the schoolboy artist pointing towards Tom. The absence of parish officers who should be controlling the boys is an intentional rebuke on Hogarth's part; he agreed with Henry Fielding that one of the causes for the rising crime rate was the lack of care from the overseers of the poor, who were too often interested in the posts only for the social status and monetary rewards they could bring. Below the text the authorship is established: Designed by W. Hogarth, Published according to Act of Parliament. 1 Feb.. 1751 The Act of Parliament referred to is the Engraving Copyright Act 1734. Many of Hogarth's earlier works had been reproduced in great numbers without his authority or any payment of royalties, and he was keen to protect his artistic property, so had encouraged his friends in Parliament to pass a law to protect the rights of engravers. Hogarth had been so instrumental in pushing the Bill through Parliament that on passing it became known as the \\"Hogarth Act\\". =Second stage of cruelty= Second stage of cruelty (Plate II) Rembrandt, Balaam and the Ass George Taylor Triumphing over Death In the second plate, the scene is Thavies Inn Gate (sometimes ironically written as Thieves Inn Gate), one of the Inns of Chancery which housed associations of lawyers in London. Tom Nero has grown up and become a hackney coachman, and the recreational cruelty of the schoolboy has turned into the professional cruelty of a man at work. Tom's horse, worn out from years of mistreatment and overloading, has collapsed, breaking its leg and upsetting the carriage. Disregarding the animal's pain, Tom has beaten it so furiously that he has put its eye out. In a satirical aside, Hogarth shows four corpulent barristers struggling to climb out of the carriage in a ludicrous state. They are probably caricatures of eminent jurists, but Hogarth did not reveal the subjects' names, and they have not been identified. Elsewhere in the scene, other acts of cruelty against animals take place: a drover beats a lamb to death, an ass is driven on by force despite being overloaded, and an enraged bull tosses one of its tormentors. Some of these acts are recounted in the moral accompanying the print: { style=\\"font- style:italic; font-size:90%; text-align:center\\"  The generous Steed in hoary Age, Subdu'd by Labour lies; And mourns a cruel Master's rage, While Nature Strength denies.  The tender Lamb o'er drove and faint, Amidst expiring Throws; Bleats forth it's innocent complaint And dies beneath the Blows.  Inhuman Wretch! say whence proceeds This coward Cruelty? What Int'rest springs from barb'rous deeds? What Joy from Misery? } The cruelty has also advanced to include abuse of people. A dray crushes a playing boy while the drayman sleeps, oblivious to the boy's injury and the beer spilling from his barrels. Posters in the background advertise a cockfight and a boxing match as further evidence of the brutal entertainments favoured by the subjects of the image. The boxing match is to take place at Broughton's Amphitheatre, a notoriously tough venue established by the \\"father of pugilism\\", Jack Broughton: a contemporary bill records that the contestants would fight with their left leg strapped to the floor, with the one with the fewest bleeding wounds being adjudged the victor.Uglow, p.503. One of the advertised participants in the boxing match is James Field, who was hanged two weeks before the prints were issued and features again in the final image of the series; the other participant is George \\"the Barber\\" Taylor, who had been champion of England but was defeated by Broughton and retired in 1750. On Taylor's death in 1757, Hogarth produced a number of sketches of him wrestling Death, probably for his tomb. According to Werner Busch, the composition alludes to Rembrandt's painting, Balaam's Ass (1626).See Werner Busch, Nachahmung als burgerliches Kunstprinzip: Ikonographische Zitate bei Hogarth und in seiner Nachfolge (Hildesheim 1977). In an echo of the first plate, there is but one person who shows concern for the welfare of the tormented horse. To the left of Nero, and almost unseen, a man notes down Nero's hackney coach number to report him. =Cruelty in perfection= Cruelty in perfection (Plate III) In Bell's woodcut, a log in the foreground bears his and Hogarth's names and the date. Van Dyck's \\"Ecce Homo\\" By the time of the third plate, Tom Nero has progressed from the mistreatment of animals to theft and murder. Having encouraged his pregnant lover, Ann Gill, to rob and leave her mistress, he murders the girl when she meets him. The murder is shown to be particularly brutal: her neck, wrist, and index finger are almost severed. Her trinket box and the goods she had stolen lie on the ground beside her, and the index finger of her partially severed hand points to the words \\"God's Revenge against Murder\\" written on a book that, along with the Book of Common Prayer, has fallen from the box.Uglow, p.504. A woman searching Nero's pockets uncovers pistols, a number of pocket watches—evidence of his having turned to highway robbery (as Tom Idle did in Industry and Idleness),It has been suggested that he has done so out of desperation following his dismissal as a coach driver because of the report against him from the Second Stage, as well as other atrocities assuredly committed by him. and a letter from Ann Gill which reads: The spelling is perfect and while this is perhaps unrealistic, Hogarth deliberately avoids any chance of the scene becoming comical. A discarded envelope is addressed \\"To Thos Nero at Pinne...\\". Ronald Paulson sees a parallel between the lamb beaten to death in the Second Stage and the defenceless girl murdered here. Below the print, the text claims that Nero, if not repentant, is at least stunned by his actions: { style=\\"font-style:italic; font-size:90%; text-align:center\\"  To lawless Love when once betray'd. Soon Crime to Crime succeeds: At length beguil'd to Theft, the Maid By her Beguiler bleeds.  Yet learn, seducing Man! nor Night, With all its sable Cloud, can screen the guilty Deed from sight; Foul Murder cries aloud.  The gaping Wounds and bloodstain'd steel, Now shock his trembling Soul: But Oh! what Pangs his Breast must feel, When Death his Knell shall toll. } Various features in the print are meant to intensify the feelings of dread: the murder takes place in a graveyard, said to be St Pancras but suggested by John Ireland to resemble Marylebone; an owl and a bat fly around the scene; the moon shines down on the crime; the clock strikes one for the end of the witching hour. The composition of the image may allude to Anthony van Dyck's The Arrest of Christ. A lone Good Samaritan appears again: among the snarling faces of Tom's accusers, a single face looks to the heavens in pity. In the alternative image for this stage, produced as a woodcut by Bell, Tom is shown with his hands free. There are also differences in the wording of the letter and some items, like the lantern and books, are larger and simpler while others, such as the man to the left of Tom and the topiary bush, have been removed. The owl has become a winged hourglass on the clock tower. =The reward of cruelty= The reward of cruelty (Plate IV) Having been tried and found guilty of murder, Nero has now been hanged and his body taken for the ignominious process of public dissection. The year after the prints were issued, the Murder Act 1752 would ensure that the bodies of murderers could be delivered to the surgeons so they could be \\"dissected and anatomised\\". It was hoped this further punishment on the body and denial of burial would act as a deterrent. At the time Hogarth made the engravings, this right was not enshrined in law, but the surgeons still removed bodies when they could. A tattoo on his arm identifies Tom Nero, and the rope still around his neck shows his method of execution. The dissectors, their hearts hardened after years of working with cadavers, are shown to have as much feeling for the body as Nero had for his victims; his eye is put out just as his horse's was, and a dog feeds on his heart, taking a poetic revenge for the torture inflicted on one of its kind in the first plate. Nero's face appears contorted in agony and although this depiction is not realistic, Hogarth meant it to heighten the fear for the audience. Just as his murdered mistress's finger pointed to Nero's destiny in Cruelty in Perfection, in this print Nero's finger points to the boiled bones being prepared for display, indicating his ultimate fate. While the surgeons working on the body are observed by the mortar-boarded academics in the front row, the physicians, who can be identified by their wigs and canes, largely ignore the dissection and consult among themselves. The president has been identified as John Freke, president of the Royal College of Surgeons at the time. Freke had been involved in the high-profile attempt to secure the body of condemned rioter Bosavern Penlez for dissection in 1749. Aside from the over-enthusiastic dissection of the body and the boiling of the bones in situ, the image portrays the procedure as it would have been carried out. Two skeletons to the rear left and right of the print are labelled as James Field, a well-known boxer who also featured on a poster in the second plate, and Macleane, an infamous highwayman. Both men were hanged shortly before the print was published (Macleane in 1750 and Field in 1751). The skeletons seemingly point to one another. Field's name above the skeleton on the left may have been a last minute substitution for \\"GENTL HARRY\\" referring to Henry Simms, also known as Young Gentleman Harry. Simms was a robber who was executed in 1747. The motif of the lone \\"good man\\" is carried through to this final plate, where one of the academics points at the skeleton of James Field, indicating the inevitable outcome for those who start down the path of cruelty. This woodcut image from 1495 has many of the basic elements of Hogarth's picture. The composition of the scene is a pastiche of the frontispiece of Andreas Vesalius's De humani corporis fabrica, and it possibly also borrows from Quack Physicians' Hall (c. 1730) by the Dutch artist Egbert van Heemskerck, who had lived in England and whose work Hogarth admired. An earlier source of inspiration may have been a woodcut in the 1495 Fasciculo di medicina by Johannes de Ketham which, although simpler, has many of the same elements, including the seated president flanked by two windows. Below the print are these final words: { style=\\"font-style:italic; font- size:90%; text-align:center\\"  Behold the Villain's dire disgrace! Not Death itself can end. He finds no peaceful Burial-Place, His breathless Corse, no friend.  Torn from the Root, that wicked Tongue, Which daily swore and curst! Those Eyeballs from their Sockets wrung, That glow'd with lawless Lust!  His Heart expos'd to prying Eyes, To Pity has no claim; But, dreadful! from his Bones shall rise, His Monument of Shame. } Reception Hogarth was pleased with the results. European Magazine reported that he commented to a bookseller from Cornhill (a Mr. Sewell): In his unfinished Apology for Painters he commented further: In his 1817 book Shakespeare and His Times, Nathan Drake credits the representation of \\"throwing at cocks\\" in the first plate for changing public opinion about the practice, which was common at the time, and prompting magistrates to take a harder line on offenders. In his \\"Lectures on Ethics\\" Immanuel Kant refers to the engravings as an example of how cruelty towards animals leads indirectly to failing duties towards humans as Hogarth \\"brings home to us the terrible rewards of cruelty, and this should be an impressive lesson to children.\\" Others found the series less to their liking. Charles Lamb dismissed the series as mere caricature, not worthy to be included alongside Hogarth's other work, but rather something produced as the result of a \\"wayward humour\\" outside of his normal habits. Art historian Allan Cunningham also had strong feelings about the series: The Anatomy Act 1832 ended the dissection of murderers, and most of the animal tortures depicted were outlawed by the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835, so by the 1850s The Four Stages of Cruelty had come to be viewed as a somewhat historical series, though still one with the power to shock, a power it retains for a modern audience. See also * Before 1900s in comics Notes a. A pair of impressions from Bell's original printing were acquired for £1600 by the University of Glasgow's Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery in 2005. b. There is some confusion over the date of George \\"The Barber\\" Taylor's career and death. In his earlier work Paulson puts him as a pupil of Broughton, killed in a fight with him in 1750, and the Tate Gallery dates Hogarth's sketches to c. 1750. In Hogarth's \\"Harlot\\", he states that Taylor retired in 1750 but came out of retirement in 1757 for a final fight in which he was badly beaten, dying from his injuries several months later. Most records date Taylor's championship to the middle 1730s. c. The initials on the box are normally read as A. G. for Ann Gill, but the G resembles a D, suggesting the box too may have been stolen. d. John Ireland identifies the president as \\"Mr Frieake, the master of Nourse, to whom Mr Potts was a pupil\\". Since Ireland identifies him as the master of Nourse, he undoubtedly means John Freke, an acquaintance of Hogarth's and surgeon at St Bartholomew's Hospital from 1729–1755 and a Governor 1736–1756. The dissection could be taking place at St Bartholomew's Hospital, where all three surgeons were based, but it also has features of the Cutlerian Theatre of the Royal College of Physicians near Newgate (particularly the throne, which bears their arms, and its curved wall resembling a cockpit) and the niches of the Barber-Surgeons' Hall (which was not used for dissection after the surgeons split away to form the Company of Surgeons in 1745).

He is a former minister having held several positions, a former chairman of Indonesian Football Association and National Sports Committee of Indonesia. He is an alumnus of the National Military Academy in Magelang, Central Java and Medical Faculty of Padjadjaran University in Bandung, West Java. In 1998, he received a master's degree from American World University, an organization forbidden to operate in 2005 because of its diploma mill action. Family Agum is married to Linda Amaliasari and has 2 children, Haris Khaseli Gumelar and Ami Dianti Gumelar. Military career Agum entered the Indonesian Military Academy in Magelang, Central Java in 1969. In 1973, he was appointed as staff in the Operational Command for the Restoration of Security and Order. In late 1987, Agum was promoted to Vice Intelligence Assistance of Special Force Command until 1990. In 1991, he was transferred to Vice Intelligence of Jakarta military area command. In 1992 Agum was promoted to Chief of Danrem 042/Garuda Hitam at Lampung. In 1993, he was promoted as Director A of Strategic Intelligence Board of Indonesian National Armed Forces and also promoted to Chief of Special Force Command. In 1994, he was promoted to the position of Chief of Staff of the Bukit Barisan Military Area Command until 1996 when he was again transferred and promoted as Chief of the Wirabuana Military Area Command until 1998. By 1998 he was promoted as Governor of National Resillience Institute, until 1999. Politic career =Wahid Presidency= When Abdurrahman Wahid became president in 1999, Agum was appointed as Minister of Transportation. In July 2001 he was moved to the position of Minister of Defense and Coordinating Minister of Politics, Social and Security during the fourth Wahid government cabinet reshuffle. =Megawati Presidency= When Wahid was impeached by the People's Consultative Assembly and Megawati Sukarnoputri was appointed as president, Agum was appointed as Minister of Transport, a position he held in the Mutual Assistance Cabinet until 2004. =Widodo Presidency= In January 2018, Agum was appointed as a member of the Presidential Advisory Council in a minor reshuffle, replacing Hasyim Muzadi who died in 2017. 2004 Indonesian Presidential Election During the first direct presidential elections in Indonesia in 2004, Agum was selected as a vice presidential candidate. He joined the incumbent vice president Hamzah Haz as a running mate. The Hamzah – Agum team was supported by the United Development Party. In the first round of the election (July 5, 2004), the Hamzah – Agum team received relatively low support (only 3.5 million votes). These results put the duo into fifth place on in the 2004 Indonesian presidential elections behind SBY – Jusuf Kalla, Megawati Sukarnoputri – Hasyim Muzadi, Wiranto – Solahuddin Wahid and Amien Rais – Siswono Yudohusodo. The Hamzah – Agum team was therefore eliminated and was not eligible to take place in second round of the election held several months later. 2008 West Java Gubernatorial Election In 2008 the West Java province held the first direct gubernatorial election. Agum took part in the competition, supported by a coalition of Indonesian Democratic Party - Struggle and United Development Party, with his running mate, the incumbent vice governor Nu'man Abdul Hakim. Agum was unsuccessful with the Agum – Nu'man duo taking second place behind Ahmad Heryawan – Yusuf Macan Effendie team from coalition of the Prosperous Justice Party and National Mandate Party.http://www.antara.co.id/view/?i=1213343905&c;=NAS&s;= Notes References * Agum Gumelar * Profil Agum Gumelar *Complete profile of Agum Gumelar External links * PSSI Category:1945 births Category:Living people Category:People from Tasikmalaya Category:Indonesian National Military Academy alumni Category:Government ministers of Indonesia Category:Presidents of PSSI Category:PSSI officials Category:Sundanese people Category:Defense ministers of Indonesia Category:Indonesian generals Category:Transport ministers of Indonesia ","title":"Agum Gumelar"},{"id":"8886751","text":"\\"Summer in Siam\\" is a single by The Pogues from their 1990 album, Hell's Ditch.

The AMU acts as a gateway between a patient's general practitioner, the emergency department, and the wards of the hospital. The AMU helps the emergency department produce a healthy turnaround for patients, helping with the four-hour waiting rule in the United Kingdom. An AMU is usually made up of several bays and has a small number of side-rooms and treatment rooms. They are fully equipped with emergency medical treatment facilities including defibrillators and resuscitation equipment.  Patients  From the emergency department, patients can be moved to AMU where they will undergo further tests and stabilisation before they are transferred to the relevant ward or sent home. Also, patients can be admitted straight to AMU from their general practitioner if he or she believes the patient needs hospital treatment. A patient's stay in the unit is limited, usually no more than 48 hours. The AMU deals with admissions only, patients will never be transferred from a ward to the AMU. Surgical procedures are not carried out in the unit either; these are referred on to the relevant theatre such as cardiothoracics and general surgery.  Staff  Senior staff in an AMU typically include a consultant in acute medicine, general medicine, emergency medicine, or critical care. Often a registrar in general medicine, and a ward sister or a charge nurse have roles in the unit. A number of staff nurses work alongside the senior staff to provide care to patients in the unit. The department can also include pharmacists, who carry out duties such as medical history taking. Although AMU has its own staff trained to deal with patients and provide care, members of staff from other departments in the hospital are needed in AMU to assess patients and provide further diagnosis. Typical examples of staff who may be needed in AMU are general surgeons, cardiothoracic surgeons, cardiologists, and a psychiatric liaison nurse. Alternative names for the department The name \\"acute medical unit\\" is recommended by the Royal College of Physicians in its 2007 acute medicine report. Despite this, many hospitals use different names for the department.

Obol Investment was an apparent Swedish company involved in fund managing and sponsoring sport events. In 2006, it signed a 15-year sponsorship deal with the Swedish Basketball Federation that resulted in the renaming of Basketligan (\\"the Basketball league\\") to Obol Basketball League. It was later revealed by independently working journalists at Norrbottens- Kuriren and Sveriges Radio's Kaliber, an investigative journalism program, that the company did not have a permits to conduct business in Sweden and that the company seemed to have no traceable fund assets. Or at least not in the amounts claimed by the company spokespersons ($1-15 billion US Dollars). The Obol affair According to Radio Sweden's domestic program Kaliber on 3 December 2006, the company \\"Obol Investment\\" doesn't exist, and doesn't have the necessary permits to manage funds in Sweden, Switzerland or any other country. It was also revealed that the focal point of Obol, the charismatic entrepreneur Bo Johansson (born 1962 in Malmberget), had been supplying false information about the circumstances of his own upbringing as well as the origins of Obol itself. Johansson claimed that he was orphaned when he was only 16 when his parents actually died a few years apart in his mid 20s. The founder and owner of Obol, an Englishman known as \\"Sir Brownleigh\\". Obol has been marketed as a highly internationalized business with vast sums (up to 15 billion US dollars) in investment funds about which there seems to be no public information. Despite this, the company's website is hosted from a server in Köping, Sweden. In press releases on their webpage from 4-9 December 2006, Obol Investment's two main representatives, Bo Johansson and Jan Saradlic, denounced the criticism in the media as a \\"journalistic frontal attack\\", \\"a nightmare\\" and \\"a mass hunt/slaughter of Obol\\", as well as stating that they are looking into possibilities of suing for libel. \\"Rightful and appropriate\\" criticism about withholding of information has been admitted, however, and all investments in the Obol Investment Concept fund were to be repaid. As of 12 January 2007, Obol had repeatedly avoided attending meetings with Finansinspektionen, the agency charged with supervising the Swedish financial market, to clear up any suspicions of illegal activities. Finansinspektionen is currently conducting an investigation whether Obol and its owners have been pursuing business ventures that would require permits. Bo Johansson returned to Sweden in 2019 under a different last name. He claims that a member of the company tasked with returning funds to investors sent it to a relative in Croatia.

It contains all primary legislation in force since 1267, and all secondary legislation since 1823; it does not include legislation which was fully repealed prior to 1991. The contents have been revised to reflect legislative changes up to 2002, with material that has been amended since 2002 fully updated and searchable. New Statute Law Database In December 2008 the Statute Law Database team transferred to The National Archives, which meant that the responsibility for the Office of Public Sector Information and SLD websites became the responsibility of one department. A major consideration of the transfer was to enable the rationalisation of the two websites in order to provide one point of access to all UK legislation and in doing so reduce duplication in effort, increase efficiency (for example taking advantage of technological developments to streamline processes) and provide a more user friendly and accessible service across the board. Since December 2008 a considerable amount of work has taken place to look at who the customers of the joint services are and look carefully at their requirements. The content of the new Statute Law Database consists of the combined content of the previous UK Statute Law Database (SLD), and the Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI) website. Updated legislation on the new website is the same data as that available on SLD. The only exceptions are a few acts that are being updated by the editorial team that are available on SLD but will not be available on the new site until the revisions are complete and they are ready to be published to SLD and the new website. Many of the revised documents held by SLD are also available in the OPSI dataset as an \\"as enacted\\" version. The new website combines these so one can switch between the different versions. Aspects of the new site: * For the majority of revised legislation, now held the 'as enacted' and 'revised' version. The different versions can be accessed via the buttons in the 'What Version' area on the table of contents. * 'Next' and 'Previous' buttons are now available when navigating the content of legislation (this has only been made possible because of the way the legislation is held on the new site). * 'Change to Legislation' – Much work has been done in order to make the revised legislation as usable as possible although it is not fully up to date. The development of the new site has allowed us to take the 'Tables of Legislative Effects' information currently published on SLD and incorporate the 'unapplied effects' into the content of the legislation at provision level. This means that instead of having to look through the 'Tables of Effects' year by year in order to establish the current position of a piece of legislation, one can access all the outstanding effects when viewing the act. The outstanding effects also include links to the affecting legislation meaning that one can view the amendments more easily. * Links in annotations – all annotations giving authority for amendments that have been applied now contain links to the affecting legislation (on SLD will only be able to do this for amendments carried out post 2002.) * Probably one of the main areas of difference from SLD is that the 'attributes' information have been removed from the foot of the provisions in order to make it more meaningful to users. The 'geographical extent' can now be turned on and off using the 'show geographical extent' button and the 'start date' information is now presented on the 'Timeline of Changes' so as to give the ability to navigate through the legislation at specific points in time. History = Background = Access to statute law in the United Kingdom was, for some time, a difficult matter. As the Hansard Society noted in 1992, \\"[a]t present the accessibility of statute law to users and the wider public is slow, inconvenient, complicated and subject to several impediments. To put it bluntly, it is often very difficult to find out what the text of a law is – let alone what it means. Something must be done.\\"Zander, M., The Law-Making Process, Cambridge University Press, Sixth Edition, 2004, p. 103, =Development=  1991 to 1995  The idea for creating a UK-wide legislation database dates back to 1991 when the government awarded a contract to Syntegra, a BT company previously known as \\"Secure Information Systems Limited\\", to create a database containing all the public Acts comprised in the publication Statutes in Force together with all amendments made since a \\"base date\\" of 1 February 1991. The database was delivered by Syntegra in November 1993, but not accepted by the government until Summer 1995 at a cost of £700,000. The database was originally intended for use by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel, but following testing with the public service it was decided to make it available to legal practitioners and the private sector on a commercial basis, as well as to public libraries and Citizens Advice Bureaux. The original database consisted of an Interleaf editorial system which allowed legislation to be held and edited in SGML. In 1991 there were no plans to make the database available on the internet. The aim of the project was to create an electronic version of Statutes In Force which would be available on CD-ROM to much the same audience as that to which Statutes In Force had been available prior to 1991.See Talk page for information from staff of the Office of Public Sector Information, 30 August 2009. In 1995 Syntegra developed the first version of the Statute Law Database website. This was only ever available in pilot form and to a limited number of Government users. 1996 to 2000 On 9 February 1996, Roger Freeman, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, announced that the copyright and charging policy of the Statute Law Database would \\"be decided nearer the time of implementation in 1997\\". This date was pushed forwarded to 1999 and then to 2000. In March 1999, it was disclosed that \\"[t]he partially updated database is presently available to a number of users within central government who have access to the Statutory Publications Office Intranet. The Lord Chancellor's Department are considering options for the future marketing of the Statute Law Database. These options include free Internet access, the granting of non-exclusive licences to legal information publishers and the provision of a subscription on-line service.\\" In September a demonstration version of the database was made available on the Syntegra Track Record website, containing legislation for the years 1985 to 1995, though this was quickly removed. 2001 to 2006 In 2004, it was announced that the system designed by Syntegra would be modernised by replacing its editorial database, developing two new enquiry systems (one for government departments (accessible via the Government Secure Intranet, \\"GSI\\") and the other for the general public), and the revision and updating of the statute book. Two contracts were signed by the Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA) with Computacenter, one for the delivery of the editorial system, the other for the government enquiry system. The combined cost of the contracts was £458,000.Freedom of Information Act response, 1 July 2005 A content management system named TSO ActiveText (after TSO, The Stationery Office) is used in the new system to store legislation in XML with a specific DTD. Documents in ActiveText are fragmented and can be edited using XMetaL which allows editors to check documents in and out of the database for editing. All the legislation from the original SGML database was converted into XML. After the editorial system was completed, further development began on a new online Statute Law Database Enquiry System. The government's enquiry system was launched on 31 May 2006 with a plan to roll out general access in three phases. The first stage would open the database to a very limited number of users for testing. On 2 August 2006 the Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA) commenced the second stage of the database project, allowing the system to be tested in use by issuing login details and passwords to a wide range of selected customers including Government users, law librarians, police staff, Citizens Advice Bureaux and students. The pilot did not specifically include any commercial legal publishers. Initially, the DCA intended to charge users for access to \\"historical law\\", but not current law, however, following pressure notably from The Guardian and its \\"Free Our Data\\" campaign, it was announced in October that the system would be free to use.Law Society Gazette, \\"Statutes free on web\\", 5 October 2006 The SPO's Clare Allison revealed nevertheless that the DCA would be \\"looking at options that concern the commercial reuse of the data\\". The delays involved in realising the database led to a number groups requesting the raw data of the legislation in order to put together their own versions. Among those refused access was Julian Todd, the co-creator of the website TheyWorkForYou, who stated \\"I can’t comprehend what the DCA thinks it is gaining by not giving us a database dump of the law.\\" Todd had submitted a request under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 for disclosure of the data, but this was refused and he brought an appeal before the Information Commissioner. The database was finally made available to the public on 20 December 2006. Announcing its launch, Baroness Ashton, a Parliamentary Under-Secretary in the Department for Constitutional Affairs, said that \\"[t]he Statute Law Database provides an authoritative and easy-to- use historical database of UK statute law. I hope it will be welcomed as a useful tool for professionals who need to keep up with changes to the law as well as those who simply have an interest in historic and current legislation.\\"Your Right to Know, 20 December 2006 2007–present Content The database contains the text of primary legislation since 1267 and secondary legislation issued after 1823, some 80,000 texts. All primary legislation on the site has been revised to show the effect of legislation and amendments enacted until 2002. The database is not fully up to date and, as of 2009, there is no estimate for when it will be fully up to date. Acts are targeted for updating according to a system of priorities based on demand ascertained mainly from Webtrends reports showing which Acts are viewed most frequently. Until December 2008, the responsibility for keeping the database up-to-date lay with the Statutory Publications Office, part of the Ministry of Justice. Since that date, responsibility has been transferred to a team within the Information and Policy Services Directorate (formerly called the Office of Public Sector Information) of The National Archives.About us, Statute Law Database. Retrieved on 24 April 2009. Following the transfer, a programme of work is now underway to bring together the content of the existing Statute Law Database with \\"as enacted\\" original legislation from the website of the Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI) to form a single \\"UK Legislation\\" website. In addition, a \\"table of effects\\" has been published every year since 2002 which lists all the legislation repealed, the effects of primary and secondary legislation brought into force since 2002 on primary legislation in the database. =Primary legislation= The database content includes the following primary legislation in '' * Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain (1707–1800); * Acts of the English Parliament (1267-1706); * Acts of the pre- UK Parliaments (1424–1707); * UK local Acts (from 1991); * Acts of the Scottish Parliament (1999 to date); * Measures of the Welsh Assembly (2007 to 2011); * Acts of the Welsh Assembly (2011 to date); * Acts of the Irish Parliament (1495-1800); * Acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland (1921–1972); * Measures of the Northern Ireland Assembly (1974); * Acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly (2000–2002, 2007 to date); * Orders in Council made under Northern Ireland Acts (1974 to date); * Church of England Measures (1920 to date). Other primary legislation that is held in unrevised form includes: * Post-1991 local Acts (and a small number of pre-1991 local Acts). =Secondary legislation= The database also contains certain secondary legislation which is mostly updated: * Statutory Instruments (from 1948); * Welsh Statutory Instruments (from 1999); * Scottish Statutory Instruments (from 1999); * Statutory Rules of Northern Ireland (from 1991); * Church Instruments (from 1991). Current limitations While the database reflects amendments to primary legislation, it is not up to date. Also the database does not currently include: * Some of the pre-1991 repealed legislation; * Most pre-1991 local Acts; * Secondary legislation pre-dating 1823; * Orders in Council made under the Royal Prerogative; * Byelaws. There are no plans to extend the database to include the above material. However, a Select Committee report on the \\"Merits of Statutory Instruments\\", published on 7 November 2006, recommended that the database should be extended to cover secondary as well as primary legislation. The government responded that this was indeed important, but that \\"[t]he immediate priority is to ensure that a fully revised and up to date version of the official statute book is delivered for use by the public and that work on this is maintained. After this has been achieved consideration will then be given as to how work can be extended to updating secondary legislation.\\" See also * Halsbury's Statutes  References  External links *UK Statute Law Database *Government promises data shake-up BBC News 2007-01-12 Category:Law of the United Kingdom Category:Government databases in the United Kingdom Category:Online law databases Category:Government services web portals in the United Kingdom ","title":"Legislation.gov.uk"},{"id":"8886825","text":"The Zakarids or Zakarians (, Zak'aryanner), also known by their Georgian name as Mkhargrdzeli (), were a noble Armenian Encyclopaedia of Islam. — E.

The Zakarians considered themselves Armenians. History The first historically traceable Zakarid was Khosrov. When the David IV of Georgia liberated Lori from the Seljuq grip, the Zakarids came to be vassals of the House of Orbeli. Under George III of Georgia, Sargis Zakarian was appointed as governor of the Armenian city of Ani in 1161, however it was soon recaptured by the Shaddadids. In 1177, the Zakarids supported the monarchy against the insurgents during the rebellion of Prince Demna and the Orbeli family. The uprising was suppressed, and George III persecuted his opponents and elevated the Zakarids. Sargis was granted Lori during the reign of the Tamar of Georgia in 1186. The sons of Sargis, Zakare and Ivane Zakarian, were the most successful representatives of the family, who were military commanders under Queen Tamar. Zakare and Ivane took Dvin in 1193. They also took Sevan, Bjni, Amberd and Bargushat, and all the towns above the city of Ani, up to the bridge of Khodaafarin bridge. Around the year 1199, they took the city of Ani, and in 1201, Tamar gave Ani to them as a principality. Eventually, their territories came to resemble those of Bagratid Armenia. Around the same time, Ivane converted to Georgian Orthodox Christianity, while Zakare remained Armenian Apostolic in faith. The brothers commanded the Armenian-Georgian armies for almost three decades, achieving major victories at Shamkor in 1195 and Basen in 1203 and leading raids into northern Persia in 1210 and suppression of rebellions of mountaineers in 1212. They amassed a great fortune, governing all of northern Armenia; Zakare and his descendants ruled in northwestern Armenia with Ani as their capital, while Ivane and his offspring ruled eastern Armenia, including the city of Dvin. Both brothers left several bilingual inscriptions across the Armeno-Georgian border lands and built several churches and forts, such as the Harichavank Monastery and Akhtala Monastery in northern Armenia. The family went in decline with the establishment of Mongol power in the Caucasus. When the Khwarezms invaded the region, Dvin was ruled by the aging Ivane, who had given Ani to his nephew Shahnshah, son of Zakare. Dvin was lost, but Kars and Ani did not surrender. However, when Mongols took Ani in 1236, they had a friendly attitude towards the Zakarids. They confirmed Shanshe in his fief, and even added to it the fief of Avag, son of Ivane. Further, in 1243, they gave Akhlat to the princess T’amt’a, daughter of Ivane. After the Mongols captured Ani in 1236, the Zakarids ruled not as vassals of the Bagratids, but rather the Mongols. The later kings of Zakarids continued their control over Ani until the 1360, when they lost to the Kara Koyunlu Turkoman tribes, who made Ani their capital.

He was born in Bordeaux and died in Paris. Lobre first gained recognition in the late 19th century when his work was displayed at the Salon du Champs-de-Mars. In 1888 he received an honorary mention and a travel grant from the Salon. That summer he traveled to Normandy where he stayed with Jacques-Émile Blanche. By this time, Blanche regularly hosted popular artists. Degas and Whistler were among his most prominent guests.Guillermo Solana - http://coleccionctb.museothyssen.org/ColeccionCTB/eng/htm/obra150/ficha.htm By the turn of the 20th century, Lobre produced work in the Intimist style. His motifs were dominated by comfortable bourgeois settings. In April 1905, his work was displayed alongside other practitioners of the style in a collective exhibit at Henri Gervex's galleries. The exhibit featured pieces by Édouard Vuillard – who coined the term \\"intimiste\\" to describe his own paintings – Henri Matisse, Hermann-Paul, Rene Prinet and Ernest Laurent. Lobre was granted prominent space for his \\"delicious interiors of the Chateau of Versailles\\".The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs Vol. 7, No. 25 (Apr. 1905) The star of 1908's Salon du Champs-de-Mars was unquestionably Rodin, but Lobre was \\"well represented\\",The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs Vol. 13, No. 63 (Jun. 1908), pp. 177-181 and his prominence increased during the period before the Great War. Lobre was close to the poet Robert de Montesquiou who dedicated his collection of sonnets, Les Perles rouges (1899) to him. When Europe descended into chaos in the summer of 1914, Maurice Lobre helped depict its atrocities. Some of the work he produced during this period is now part of the Smithsonian collection and grouped with fellow Intimists Hermann-Paul and Ernest Laurent.

It is found in Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Turkmenistan, Kirghizstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. It is locally common in desert habitats. Description left Male upperside: white, with a slight cream-yellow tint. Forewing: base densely, costal margin lightly, irrorated (speckled) with black scales; cell with a transverse black median and a black apical spot, the latter extends from the costa along the discocellulars almost to the lower apex of cell; beyond the cell an oblique, short black bar, widened posteriorly and with three superposed red spots, the middle spot minute, sometimes absent; this is followed by an irregular subterminal black band, widened at the veins, widest near the costa, and gradually narrowed to a faint line posteriorly. In many specimens this band is not extended below vein 5, in others it reaches or almost reaches the tornal angle and is joined in its extension downwards to a prominent black transverse spot in interspace 3. Beyond this band the apex is marked with a small diffuse black patch, and the apices of the veins with black spots that are extended inwards to the subterminal band. Hindwing: base and dorsal margin broadly irrorated with black scales: a black upper discal and a subcostal spot, both generally centred with red; a subterminal series of slender black lunules, followed by a terminal row of transversely linear black spots; the middle and postdiscal areas of the wing darkened by the markings of the underside that show through by transparency. Cilia of both forewings and hindwings white alternated with black. Underside: ground colour similar. Forewing: markings as on the upperside, but the cellular spots, the spot in interspace 3 and the short bar beyond apex of cell larger, more intensely black, the red spots on the last also larger; the subterminal and terminal markings paler, more diffuse. Hindwing with basal, median and subterminal broad transverse bands of irrorated black scales, all the bands with their margins uneven and zigzag; the outer margin of the basal band with four transversely placed red spots, and transverse red discal spots edged with black in interspaces 1, 2, 5 and 7; the termen margined with a fine, more or less interrupted, black line. In a few specimens the red spots are more or less obsolescent. Antennae: Pale yellowish white, the shafts obscurely ringed with black head, thorax and abdomen, black, the head and the thorax anteriorly with long greyish-white hairs; beneath: the palpi, thorax, legs and basal portion of the abdomen similarly clothed. Female: Differs from the male as follows: Upperside: All the markings larger and more conspicuous; an additional large black spot in the middle of interspace 1. Underside: Similar to that of the male, but with the additional black spot as noted above.

Version 7 July 2006. in The Tree of Life Web Project, Nomenclature According to Francis Hemming, Édouard Ménétries proposed the name Hypermnestra in 1846 as a replacement name for Ismene Nickerl, 1846, which is an invalid junior homonym of Ismene Savigny, 1816 and Ismene Swainson, 1820. However, the introduction of this name by Ménétriés was overlooked for a long time, and Hypermnestra was attributed either to Heydenreich 1851 or to Westwood, [1852].http://tolweb.org/Hypermnestra/65392 References External links TOL Overview and taxonomic discussion *Rusinsects Category:Papilionidae Category:Insects of Pakistan Category:Butterflies of Iran Category:Taxa named by František Antonín Nickerl Category:Butterflies described in 1846 ","title":"Hypermnestra helios"},{"id":"8886881","text":"Gardenia jasminoides, the gardenia, cape jasmine, cape jessamine, danh-danh, or jasmin, is an evergreen flowering plant of the coffee family Rubiaceae. It originated in Asia and is most commonly found growing wild in Vietnam, Southern China, Korea, Taiwan, Japan, Myanmar, India and Bangladesh. With its shiny green leaves and heavily fragrant white summer flowers, it is widely used in gardens in warm temperate and subtropical climates, and as a houseplant in temperate regions. It has been in cultivation in China for at least a thousand years, and was introduced to English gardens in the mid-18th century. Many varieties have been bred for horticulture, with low-growing, and large, and long-flowering forms. History Evidence of G. jasminoides in cultivation in China dates to the Song Dynasty (960-1279 AD), where both wild and double-flowered forms have been depicted in paintings, such as those of the Song Emperor Huizong, and the Tenth century artist Xu Xi.Keswick, p. 204 The Yuan Dynasty (1271–1368) saw it on lacquerware, and the Ming Dynasty on porcelain (1368–1644). Gardenias were seen in nurseries in Guangzhou in 1794 by English statesman Sir John Barrow. Meanwhile, it was first propagated in England in August 1757 by a James Gordon of Mile End, and sold well thereafter. It was first grown in the United States in 1762, in the Charleston garden of Alexander Garden, who had moved there 10 years previously. Taxonomy and naming Gardenia jasminoides was described by English botanist John Ellis in 1761, after it had been conveyed to England in the 1750s. It gained its association with the name jasmine as the botanist and artist Georg Dionysius Ehret had depicted it and queried whether it was a jasmine as the flowers resembled the latter plant. The name stuck and lived on as common name and scientific epithet. The name G. augusta of Linnaeus has been ruled invalid. The common names cape jasmine and cape jessamine derive from the earlier belief that the flower originated in Cape of Good Hope, South Africa. Description Leaves G. jasminoides is a shrub with greyish bark and dark green, shiny, evergreen leaves with prominent veins. It is characterized by a rounded habit with very dense branches with opposite leaves, lanceolate- oblong, leathery or gathered in groups on the same node and by a dark green, shiny and slightly waxy foliage. The white flowers have a matte texture, in contrast to the glossy leaves. They gradually take on a creamy yellow color and a waxy surface. They can be quite large, up to in diameter, loosely funnel-shaped, and double in form. Blooming in summer and autumn, they are among the most strongly fragrant of all flowers. They are followed by small, oval fruit. Cultivation In cultivation in the UK, G. jasminoides has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. It is widely used as a garden plant in warm, temperate and subtropical gardens. It can be used as a hedge. It requires good drainage and a sunny location, and prefers an acidic soil with a pH between 5.0 and 6.5. G. jasminoides is generally considered to be somewhat difficult to cultivate. As a subtropical plant, it thrives best in warm temperatures above in humid environments. Getting those conditions is rather hard in temperate latitudes, the reason for which gardenias are usually cultivated as houseplants or in greenhouses. In warm places, though, it can be grown outdoors. Either way, it prefers bright indirect sunlight or partial shade. Apart from the difficulties in creating suitable conditions for the plant to live, gardenias need to be planted in an acidic soil (it is a calcifuge). If the soil is not acid enough, many of its nutrients (especially iron compounds) will not be available for the plant, since they will not dilute in water, so will not be absorbed by the roots. If this happens, gardenias start to develop chlorosis, whose main symptom is a yellowing of the leaves. (See Soil pH). For this reason, it is advisable not to water gardenias with very hard water. When having to water with hard water, it is possible to add some vinegar or lemon juice to it before doing so, this will lower the pH of the water, or use an effective pH modifier, like phosphoric or nitric acid. Iron chelate can be added to the soil to lower the pH, but care must be taken since an overdose can kill the plant, as with any other inorganic soil amendment. Some gardeners spill vinegar over the soil to effectively keep the pH low and prevent chlorosis. This can be carried out either regularly or when the first symptoms of chlorosis have been spotted. =Cultivars= Many cultivars have been developed, of which the double- flowered forms are most popular. G. 'Radicans' is a low-growing groundcover which reaches 15–45 cm (6–18 in) and spreads up to a metre wide, while G. 'Fortuniana' and G. 'Mystery' are double-flowered cultivars. The former was sent by Scottish botanist Robert Fortune in 1844 to the Royal Horticultural Society in London. The latter has a large upright habit and has been a popular variety good for hedging. It reaches 1.8 to 2.5 m (6–8 ft) high and wide. 1880s botanical drawing G. 'Aimee' is an early-flowering (spring) form. Cultivars such as G. 'Shooting Star' and G. 'Chuck Hayes' are more cold-hardy, roughly to zone 7.United States Plant Patent PP19896 A cultivar called 'Summer Snow' is distinguished by its large flowers and grows in USDA Zones 6-10. 'Crown Jewel' is a dwarf spreading variety That has survived several weeks below zero in Zone 6. Unlike other varieties, G. 'Golden Magic' bears flowers which change to a golden yellow relatively early after opening white. It grows to 1.5 m (5 ft) high and 1 m (3.5 ft) wide. Uses The fruit has crocin which is used as a yellow dye, which is used for clothes and food. Polynesian people in the Pacific islands use these fragrant blooms in their flower necklaces, which are called Ei in the Cook Islands, Hei in French Polynesia and Lei in Hawaii =Traditional uses= Gardenia jasminoides fructus (fruit) is used within traditional Chinese medicine to \\"drain fire\\" and thereby treat certain febrile conditions.  Chemical composition of fruit  The iridoids genipin and geniposidic acid can be found in G. jasminoides. Crocetin (a chemical compound usually obtained from Crocus sativus) can also be obtained from the fruit of G. jasminoides.

Historically, the village was a centre for nailmaking, Adam Smith's \\"very trifling manufacture\\" inspiring his division of labour principle from An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776). It looks out over the neglected Pathhead Sands, and industry today is centred on Hutchison's Flour Mill and the Forbo-Nairn Plant. The historic centre of Pathhead is a trio of streets running parallel with the coast: Nether Street, Mid Street and what used to be Back Street, now Commercial Street. Water was supplied from wells at either end of Mid Street and vibrant commerce was centred on the Pathhead and Sinclairtown Reform Co-operative Society of present-day Branning Court, which was established in 1914. Ecclesiastical life focuses on Pathhead Parish Church, a Dysart extension and in addition to the many extant churches, the village once hosted the now demolished Pathhead West, Millie Street Free Church, United Reform and the stately Loughborough Road Main Church.Kirkcaldy Civic Society's \\"Pathhead Walkabout\\", p.39.

Erwin went to Vallejo High School and then graduated in biology in 1964, followed by a masters in 1966 from San Jose State College (now San Jose State University). He went to the University of Alberta to study carabid beetles under George Ball, obtaining a Ph.D. in 1969 followed by a post-doctoral stint at Harvard under P. Jackson Darlington, Jr. He took up an entomologist position in the United States National Museum (later the Smithsonian Institution) but took a year off to study carabid beetles at the University of Lund under Carl H. Lindroth. On return in 1971, Erwin was deputed to examine the beetles of Panama. By fogging the forest canopy with pesticide, he collected the falling specimens and found 1,200 species of beetles living in Luehea seemannii trees. Of those 1,200 species of beetles, he estimated that 163 are found only in the Luehea seemannii tree and not in other species of trees. There are about 50,000 species of trees in the tropics and beetles make up 40% of insects and related animals. Erwin estimated that there are about twice as many species of insects and related animals in tropical trees as there are on the ground of the forest. Erwin is notable for his controversial extrapolation of 30 million as the total number of arthropod species. Erwin served as secretary of the Society of Systematic Biologists from 1973 to 1975, and was the editor in chief of ZooKeys. He described over 20 genera and more than 400 species of insect, and as of 2015 is commemorated in the names of 47 species, two genera, one subfamily and one subspecies.

It operates six trams on the Gråkall Line, that connects the city centre to parts of the suburb of Byåsen, and the recreational area at Lian. It has 800,000 annual passengers, and operates as Line 1. The trams operate each 15 minutes during the day, and each 30 minutes in the evenings and during the weekends. The company took over the last remaining part of the tramway in 1990, after the former operator Trondheim Trafikkselskap had closed the Gråkall and Lade Line in 1988. The company took over the trams and the track, and claimed it could operate without municipal subsidies. In 2005, Gråkallbanen was bought by Veolia Transport Norge, renamed Veolia Transport Bane AS in 2008, and launched aggressive plans to take over the bus transport in Trondheim. Veolia Transport Norge was demerged to become Boreal Transport Norge in May 2011, and Veolia Transport Bane became Boreal Transport Bane AS. In November 2012, the company name was changed again, to Boreal Transport Midt-Norge AS, as a preparation for a coming PSO contract with AtB. From August 2013, the company also operated regional buses in major parts of Sør- Trøndelag. In 2016, the bus operations were moved to another Boreal subsidiary and the company was once again renamed, this time to Boreal Bane AS. History =Background= In 1988 the city council in Trondheim decided to close the Trondheim Tramway and replace it with diesel buses to save money. This was despite that the council just four years earlier had spent more than NOK 100 million on a new depot and 11 new tram cars. The bus service in Byåsen was complicated. A temporary feeding bus was established on Gamle Oslovei and Vådanveien. Breidablikk received its own line, while another served along Uglaveien from Munkvoll to Herlofsonløypa. After the tramway was reasphalted, the bus continued to along the old right-of-way to Lian. Bygrensen was not served by any buses. =Initiative= St. Olavs Gate Henry H. Tørhaug, a former tram user who lived at Bygrensen, took initiative to start Friends of the Gråkall Line () in October 1988. It attracted many local people in Byåsen who were dissatisfied with the bus service, along with many tram enthusiasts, and politicians from Bylista. This resulted in AS Gråkallbanen being founded. It proposed a more rational operation of the line, limited to the remaining right-of-way from St. Olavs Gate to Lian. The company offered a back door to several politicians, since it claimed it could operate the tram without municipal subsidies. On 22 June 1989, the city council voted to re-open the line from St. Olavs Gate to Lian. After the mater was re-considered on 31 August, it passed with 42 against 40 votes. The company was free to receive subsidies from the county and the state. The new company started negotiating with TT about the details of the take-over. In particular, the number of trams to be used was a difficult matter. Gråkallbanen wanted all eleven, while TT only would give up six. In the end the politicians voted to give seven to the new company. Since the tram lines were presumed to be kept for the museum line, Gråkallbanen was not charged the extra NOK 135,000 for maintaining the tracks on the roads. The city also accepted to take economic responsibility for the heritage trams. During the discussions, TT demanded that the municipality pay NOK 23.8 million for the trams, depots and other material, but this was rejected by the city. The city also chose to give NOK 5 million to Gråkallbanen as a one-time payment, equal to the subsidies they were giving TT to operate the new bus routes in Byåsen. The negotiated agreement was passed with 51 against 34 votes in the city council. After all the agreements were in place, TT announced on 30 December 1989 that it had found a new buyer for the trams. An agreement had been made with the Copenhagen-based Unimex Engineering, who would sell the eleven trams to the Cairo Tramway. On 2 January 1990, TT sent a letter to Gråkallbanen giving them the option to purchase the trams for the same price as the Egyptions, at an estimated NOK 17–20 million. However, Gråkallbanen pointed out to the politicians that it was possible to purchase used articulated trams for DEM 20,000 from the Stuttgart Stadtbahn. The company took the press with it to Stuttgart to negotiate the agreement, and the following Adresseavisen presented the cities new trams to the people. However, by the time the delegation had returned, they were informed that the deal had been annulled. Adresseavisen tried to locate Unimex in Copenhagen, but it turned out to be a company that had never sold a tram. At a press conference in Trondheim, the director of TT blamed Arbeider-Avisa's journalists for the deal not going through. When asked about the matter, representatives from the tramway company in Kairo said that the deal did not go through because the trams did not fit. =Reopening= The depot at Munkvoll The final decision to restart the trams was made by the city council on 29 March 1990. In the meantime, Bylista had changed their political support for the 1989 mayor election. Instead of supporting the Labour candidate Per Berge, they instead chose to support Marvin Wiseth from the Conservative Party, who took over as mayor 1 January 1990. The reason was that the Labour Party was not willing to give a clear support to the tramway operation. The Conservative Party, on the other hand, was more than willing to support any suggestions that involved privatization. The non-socialist parties succeeded at keeping the mayor until 2003 after this. On 9 June the overhead wires were powered up, and from 3 July there were test-runs with some of the historic trams. Tracks and substructure were replaced between Nyveibakken and Bergsligate. A ballast tamper was rented from Germany, and the asphalt from Kyvannet to Herlofsonløypa was removed. Part of the work was done by volunteers. The night before 6 July, seven of the trams (no. 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9 and 11) were taken out of the depot at Lademoen, and moved by truck to Kongens Gate, where they were put onto the Gråkall Line. They were then hauled by the working machine to Munkvoll. At noon the next day the first tram took a trial run in the city streets. They kept the TT colors, but were given the GB logo. At the same time they were renumbered (90–99, with holes). The official opening was on 18 August 1990, with a parade of historic trams leading the way. The traffic the first full year was 900,000 passengers annually, which is 20% higher than with the buses. Passenger numbers decreased until 1997, when they started rising somewhat. That year a bus corresponds with the tram at Breidablikk, and offers a correspondence with Marienborg, St. Olavs Hospital and Øya. During the 2000s, the ridership has stabilized at about 800,000. =Takeover= In 2005, a 67% stake of the company was taken over by Veolia Transport Norge (at the time named Connex). Approved by the general assembly on 11 April 2005, Veolia promised additional capital of NOK 10.7 million to the company. It only paid a few million for the shares. In 2005, the municipality made a new ten-year agreement concerning the operation of the tramway. The ownership of the nine trams were transferred to Gråkallbanen, so they no longer needed to pay comprehensive insurance that was at NOK 250,000. After the Veolia take-over, Gråkallbanen launched several plans to become a larger company in Trondheim. In 2007, it announced that it would apply to take over all bus routes in the city, that at the time were operated by Team Trafikk (the successor of Trondheim Trafikkselskap). The company has launched several ambitious suggestions for routes to supplement Team Trafikk, but has yet to receive permission to operate any of them. The same year, the Socialist Left Party announced that it wanted to renationalize the company, but Veolia has said it has no intentions to sell the company back to the city. =Plans= Gråkallbanen has plans expanding the present line from St. Olav's Gate to either Prinsens Gate (one block away) or to Trondheim Central Station and onwards to Pirterminalen. This expansion would cost about NOK 80 million and would be paid by the city.

It is a large glaciated massif composed of three main summits, on a ridge running from west to east. The main (and central) summit is 3,900 metres high and is located within the Swiss canton of Graubünden, although the border with the Italian region of Lombardy runs about 100 metres west of it at almost the same height (3,898 m). The western summit (3,823 m; on the international border) is named Piz Spinas and is the only one not covered by ice. The eastern summit (3,882 m; within Switzerland) is named Piz Palü Orientale. The name Palü derives from the Latin palus, meaning a swamp, and the mountain is said to be named after the Alpe Palü, a high alpine pasture some 4 km to its east. Climbing history As early as 12 August 1835, the 3,882 m east peak was climbed by Oswald Heer, and Peter and M. Flury, with guides Johann Madutz and Gian Marchet Colani (the 'chamois king of the Bernina'), who were under the impression that this was the highest summit of the mountain. This is still the normal route from Switzerland, be it followed by an easy traverse to the central peak. A second ascent of the east summit was made on 24 July 1864 by Edward N. Buxton, W.F. Digby, William Edward Hall, J. Johnston, and Montagu Woodmass with the Pontresina guides Peter Jenny, Alexander Flury, and J. B. Walther. This group was unaware of the ascent almost 30 years earlier and also believed to have reached the highest summit (they had no vision on the summit). Approaching from the Italian (south) side, four weeks later (17 August 1864) D. W. Freshfield, J. D. Walker and R. M. Beachcroft with the guide François Devouassoud climbed the pass between the central and east summits, but chose to climb the latter peak again.Gottlieb Studer, Die Pizzi di Palü in Über Eis und Schnee: Die höchsten Gipfel der Schweiz und die Geschichte ihere Besteigung, Volume 3, Bern, 1899 It is uncertain when the central and highest peak (sometimes distinguished by the name Muot da Palü) was first reached. Robin CollombCollomb, Robin, Bernina Alps, Goring: West Col Productions, 1988 believes that this was in 1866 by Kenelm Edward Digby with the before mentioned guide Peter Jenny and a porter. It was certainly ascended on 28 June 1868 by A. W. Moore, Horace Walker and Jakob Anderegg. Just four weeks later a traverse of all three peaks was made by Herren Albert Wachler, Wallner, and George, with the guides Hans and Christian Grass on 22 July 1868.

It was founded by Jerry Lucey in 1978. The name was derived from Henry O'Shea, a baker and building owner in the South Main Street area of Cork city. The club was known for its house, trance, R&B;, hip hop and regular live rock concerts. Gigs held there included a number by The Golden Horde, Toasted Heretic, Sonic Youth with support band Nirvana, Therapy?, The Wedding Present and The Fall. During late 1980s, the club ran a series of three-night long acid house weekenders, which attracted DJs such as Laurent Garnier, Shades of Rhythm and Justin Robertson. From the mid 1990s its dance nights were mostly deep house. The venue closed in June 2003 and the building demolished soon after.Carroll, Jim. \\"Digging for gold at Sir Henry’s again\\". Irish Times, 18 September 2013. Retrieved 4 September 2015 Early years Sir Henrys was a rock bar for most of the 1980s. The club at the time also held gigs by an older and more traditional \\"pub rock\\" element, but this scene had died out by the mid 1980s, as post-punk bands such as Nun Attax (later Five Go Down to the Sea?) grew in prominence. Many of Ireland's up-and-coming young bands performed here and the 'Battle of the Bands' was held there for a number of years where unsigned talent competed for a recording contract. Artists that performed there over these years included Phil Lynott, John Martyn, ex-Clash Mick Jones' Big Audio Dynamite, The Pogues and The Sisters of Mercy. On August 20, 1991, Sonic Youth played Sir Henry's, supported by the then virtually unknown band Nirvana. Some scenes were featured in the documentary 1991: The Year Punk Broke.The documentary documents Sonic Youth and Nirvana's 1991 European tour. The list of cities are shown at the beginning of the documentary and it includes the Cork date.  Dance venue  As dance music became more popular and the demand for small venue live gigs decreased, Sir Henry's became a venue for the \\"Sweat\\" night. Started in 1988 by Shane Johnson and Greg Dowling, this was to become one of the top clubs in Europe in the early 1990s, supplemented with the addition of the Back Bar with DJ's such as Donkeyman (Mark Ring) and Stephen Grainger (Stevie G). Over the 1990s, Sweat built up an international reputation, being variously described as \\"a gorgeous blend of underground house\\" (i-D), a \\"deep house frenzy\\" (The Face) and \\"the best music on that side of the Irish Sea\\" (DJ Magazine). By the mid 1990s Sir Henry’s had become a house venue, playing host to some of genre's better known artists such as Kerri Chandler, Jerome Sydenham, Roger Sanchez, Glenn Underground, Cajmere, Derrick May, Migs, Fred Everything, Charles Webster, Kevin McKay, and Mike Pickering. The short independent films \\"120 bpm\\" and \\"The House That Cork Built\\" record the club's place in Irish House music. The venue hosted the \\"alternative\\" disco night Freakscene for many years.

He may be best remembered for his role as Count Vronsky in the film adaptation of Anna Karenina (1948) with Vivien Leigh. Early years Moore was raised in County Cork in an Irish- speaking household. His father, Peadar Ó hAnnracháin (born 1873) (also known as Peter/Peadar Hourihane and Peadar O'Hourihane) was a writer and poet, and a staunch supporter of the Irish language. Peadar, a son of Seaghan Ó hAnnracháin (born 1834) and Máire Ní Dhonabháin (also born 1834) and who was one of the first organisers for Conradh na Gaeilge (Gaelic League), was twice imprisoned by the British during the Irish Civil War. Peadar lived with his parents and his sister, Áine Ní Annracháin (born 1885), and his niece, Máirín Ní Dhiomasaig (born 1903), at 14 Poundlick, Skibbereen, County Cork in 1911. He also wrote for the Southern Star newspaper for many years and had been its editor. His mother, Máire Ní Dheasmhumhnaigh (born 1888), also known as Mary Desmond, was the daughter of Dónal Ó Deasmhumhnaigh (born 1851) and Nóra Ní Bhriain of Kinsale. Several members of Kieron's family pursued careers in the arts. His sister Neasa Ní Annracháin was a stalwart of the Raidió Éireann Players, while his brother, Fachtna, was director of music at the station, and a second sister, Bláithín Ní Annracháin, played the harp with the National Symphony Orchestra. Following his family's move to Dublin, Moore attended Coláiste Mhuire, an Irish-language school. Later, his medical studies at University College Dublin were cut short when he was invited to join the players at the Abbey Theatre. He married Barbara White in 1947; the couple had four children. Career Moore in Custer of the West (1967) Moore began his acting career at the Abbey Theatre in Dublin, and made his British stage debut at the age of 19 as Heathcliff in a production of Wuthering Heights. His first film role was as an IRA man in The Voice Within (1945), where he was billed as \\"Keiron O'Hanrahan\\". He acted on the Liverpool stage in Purple Dust. He gave an acclaimed performance in the West End hit Red Roses for Me (written by Seán O'Casey). This was seen by Alexander Korda, who signed Moore to a long-term contract. Korda announced he was likely to become a major star: > He has a brilliant acting talent. Then he has six-feet-two of brawn, a > mobile photogenic face, rich expressive eyes, and ability to adapt himself > to any type of role – ultra romantic or the last word in villainy. Very soon > he will be one of the big names on the world's screens.\\" Adopting the stage name Kieron Moore, he was cast in a leading role in A Man About the House (1947), directed by Leslie Arliss. Arliss said Moore was \\"terrific. Naturally, since he's had no film experience, his work is still a bit rough, but he does the right thing by instinct. He smashes through at you from the screen.\\" There followed the psychological thriller Mine Own Executioner (1947), co-starring with Burgess Meredith. Korda then gave Moore the plum role of the suave Count Vronsky in Julien Duvivier's production of Anna Karenina (1948), which starred Vivien Leigh and Ralph Richardson. The movie was a box-office flop, and Moore received the worst notices of his career. He played Heathcliff in a BBC Television adaptation of Wuthering Heights in 1948. Korda's fourth film with him was a comedy set in Ireland, Saints and Sinners (1949), directed by Arliss. Moore went to France to co-star with Michèle Morgan in Marc Allégret's Maria Chapdelaine (1950), also known as The Naked Heart. =Hollywood= Moore was invited to Hollywood, where in 1951 he made two films, playing Uriah the Hittite in the biblical epic David and Bathsheba, supporting Gregory Peck and Susan Hayward, and a French Foreign Legion corporal in Ten Tall Men, starring Burt Lancaster. Both were supporting roles. Moore went to Italy to play the lead in an Italian-English comedy, Honeymoon Deferred (1951). In France, he had a small role in another film for Allegret, La demoiselle et son revenant (1952). =British B films= Moore was in a British B film, Mantrap (1953), for Hammer Films, supporting Paul Henreid. He had the lead in Recoil (1953, directed by John Gilling), Conflict of Wings (1954) and The Blue Peter (1954). He supported Michael Redgrave in The Green Scarf (1954). \\"Thank heavens for this\\", Moore said. \\"I've had a rough time of it, especially during the last three years. Now perhaps I can re-establish myself as an actor.\\" It did not happen. Moore had the lead in the Danzinger Brothers' Satellite in the Sky (1956) and returned to Hammer for The Steel Bayonet (1957). He directed some episodes of The Vise in 1956-57 and was in Overseas Press Club – Exclusive!, and Three Sundays to Live (1957) for the Danzigers. =Supporting roles and occasional leads= Moore had supporting roles in Carol Reed's The Key (1958) and Robert Aldrich's The Angry Hills (1959) and had a memorable role as town bully Pony Sugrue in Walt Disney's Darby O'Gill and the Little People (1959), where he fought a young Sean Connery. He also guest-starred in Tales of the Vikings (1959). He gave an impressive performance in the comedy-thriller The League of Gentlemen (1960), playing a homosexual former fascist and army officer recruited to take part in a big robbery. He also played opposite Patrick McGoohan in an episode of Danger Man titled 'The Sanctuary' (1960). There followed roles in The Day They Robbed the Bank of England (1960), and The Siege of Sidney Street (1960), shot on location in Ireland. Moore had the lead role in Doctor Blood's Coffin (1961), directed by Sidney J. Furie and supporting roles in I Thank a Fool (1962), The 300 Spartans, The Main Attraction (1962), The Day of the Triffids (1962) (for Philip Yordan), Girl in the Headlines (1963), and Hide and Seek (1964). Moore did two more for Yordan, The Thin Red Line (1964), and Crack in the World (1965) (the second disaster movie after 'Triffids' where his character's romantically linked to Janette Scott), then Son of a Gunfighter (1965) (all second-billed and all shot in Spain) and Arabesque (1966). He had lead roles in Bikini Paradise (1967) (filmed in the Canary Islands) and Run Like a Thief (shot in Spain) (1967). In his final film, Custer of the West (1967), he played Chief Dull Knife, for Yordan, again shot in Spain. He also made television appearances in such shows as Three Live Wires, Sir Francis Drake, Zero One. Boy Meets Girl, Department S, Vendetta, Jason King, The Adventurer, The Protectors and Randall and Hopkirk (Deceased)—the last of these was in the episode \\"When the Spirit Moves You\\", as the villain Miklos Corri. Moore created a TV series, Ryan International (1970), which he also starred in and wrote some episodes. It ran for ten episodes. His last acting appearance was in an episode of The Zoo Gang (1974). Post-acting career Moore quit acting in 1974, becoming a social activist on behalf of the Third World. He joined CAFOD (Catholic Agency for Overseas Development), with which he worked for nine years. During that time he made two film documentaries, Progress of Peoples (Peru) and The Parched Earth (Senegal). Later, as projects manager, he travelled to the Middle East and India. He next became associate editor of The Universe, editing its supplement New Creation, which he transformed into the magazine New Day. He last worked for television, providing voice-overs for Muiris Mac Conghail's RTÉ documentaries about the Aran Islands and the Blaskets. Moore retired in 1994 to the Charente-Maritime in France, where he joined the church choir, became a hospital visitor, and enjoyed reading French, Spanish, English and Irish literature. He was survived by his wife, the former actress Barbara White, who played opposite him in The Voice Within and Mine Own Executioner, their daughter Theresa (Soeur Miriame- Therese) and sons Casey, Colm and Seán.

The apt name “Highwayman Fly” was given by an early observer of their way of robbing ants. Very little is known about their breeding habits. The genus is found in the Afrotropical and oriental region with one species from Australia possibly a recent introduction. Description Most of the species have a yellow or brown ground-colour, an antero-posteriorly compressed head, stout mouthparts, a projecting clypeus below the lower facial margin, and have a silent flight. thumb Behaviour Bengalia flies are best known for their remarkable highwayman-like habit of robbing ant pupae from ants moving on ant roads. With respect to Bengalia depressa this habit is described as follows: “[The flies were] settling on blades of grass, stones, and other raised objects near the ant column. ... When any ant made a little circuit away from the main body, a fly would generally pursue it at a distance of about half an inch, but back away as soon as the ant turned towards it. ... Eventually Lamborn saw a fly stalk a minor ant carrying a pupa in its jaws. Suddenly the fly rushed forward and apparently pierced the pupa bringing the ant up with a sharp jerk. The two insects then had a tug of war with very little advantage to either side, until the ant apparently became annoyed and letting go of the pupa rushed at the fly, which escaped with the booty which it proceeded to suck. Then he saw a fly swoop down on the ant column and rise at once with a pupa and attendant ant, both of which it dropped after carrying them for about a foot. The ant, however, still held on and started to run off with its charge. The fly caught it again and this time rose three feet in the air and then dropped ant and pupa again. This time the ant left the pupa which the fly immediately seized and proceeded to suck.” SpeciesRognes, K.

Studia dipterologica 12: 443–471 Further Rognes considers all the new genera created as junior names for Bengalia. Lehrer's work adds 49 species to the already described 41 species and 18 of these new species are treated as invalid by Rognes. At present, major sources of Dipteran taxonomy do not recognize Lehrer's 10 new genera as valid, nor the 18 new species treated as invalid by Rognes (e.g.Thompson, F. C. (editor). 2006. Biosystematic Database of World Diptera. , accessed on 9 Nov. 2007). Additional names published by Lehrer have since been synonymized, with 120 new synonymies established in a single review in 2020.Verves, Yury G. & Lyudmila Khrokalo (2020) Review of the taxa of Calliphoridae and Sarcophagidae (Diptera) studied by late Prof. Andy Z. Lehrer. Priamus Supplement(44): 1-282. This dispute reflects that at present, there is no consensus as to the best way to subdivide the Calliphoridae, which many authorities acknowledge is not a natural group (in this case, polyphyletic); the BioSystematic Database of World Diptera, for example, states \\"The Calliphoridae are marked as a polyphyletic group of convenience as at the present we are unwilling to reduce the Oestridae to a subordinated group within a monophyletic Calliphoridae nor to elevate a number of other groups (Polleniidae, Helicoboscidae, and Bengaliidae) so as to properly delimit both Calliphoridae and Oestridae.\\" Similarly, the dispute at the generic level is that some of Lehrer's genera are paraphyletic, and, additionally, that they are based largely or exclusively upon features of the male genitalia, and it is therefore impossible to identify most female specimens to subfamily, let alone genus (the rejection of Lehrer's subdivisions therefore being both taxonomic and a matter of practicality). The dispute at the species level centers on the fact that Lehrer did not include or examine 24 of the 41 known species in his revision, so of the 31 species he validly described that were not immediately synonymized, many could still potentially be synonyms of these 24 excluded species.

It originally used licensed data from Singapore Land Authority under a non-exclusive agreement until July 2004. On top of providing free maps for personal use, the website also offers a variety of ad-supported services. The website has since expanded to include maps in Malaysia and Indonesia. In recent years, it has been involved in lawsuits against other businesses who appeared to have used Streetdirectory.com's maps without permission. Ironically, it lost a suit initiated by Singapore Land Authority for copyright infringement in early 2008 resulting in its maps taken offline for months. The website has since been taken over officially by JobsDB in August 2008, it was mentioned that JobsDB had negotiated its purchase since 2007. The website underwent a severe downtime from April to August 2008 citing re-development of its maps from scratch. It came back online after announcing JobsDB's purchase. The speedy recovery of its status is now under the radar of Singapore Land Authority for yet another copyright infringement suit. Services The website is best known for offering an online version of the Singapore street directory, which is free for personal use. It is also accompanied with value-added tools such as driving directions, photos of locations, and a travel guide. Some of these services have been previously offered only on a pay-per-use basis, but an advertisement-supported alternative has since been made available. Use of litigation Since early 2004, Streetdirectory.com has gained prominence in several of its owner's successful legal action against schools and small and medium enterprises for what they see as unauthorised use of its maps. This is after Virtual Map has also won landmark cases against larger enterprises such as NTUC Income\\"NTUC Income facing legal action over map download\\", Ho Ka Wei, The Straits Times, 1 February 2004\\"100 companies sent bills of up to $50,000 for downloading maps from a street directory website \\", Riyaz Jariwalla, Lawdit Solicitors and Suncool International, with the former's damages waived and the latter's appeal being subsequently dismissed.\\"Singapore: Virtual Map’s Copyright Endorsed by Singapore High Court\\", Angeline Raj, Mondaq, 25 August 2005\\"Company loses map-download appeal\\", Selina Lum, The Straits Times, 3 February 2005 Its owner is known to have hired an IT firm to conduct investigations aggressively against the unlicensed use of their maps on other websites, and most of the defendants contacted by Virtual Map's legal team claim that they were not aware that doing so constitutes a copyright infringement. Nevertheless, they were liable for damages and lawyers subsequently warned of this fact in the local media. The justification given by Virtual Map was that enough skill and effort was made in using SLA data to create maps that the company can claim its own independent copyright to, and suffered from a loss of potential profit when businesses reproduced their maps online without paying any licensing fees. Such use constituted, as Virtual Map claims, infringement of the Copyright Law and has angered existing clients who have legally paid to license their maps. This position was endorsed by the High Court of Singapore, which gave Virtual Map the green light to send cease and desist letters to hundreds of companies and organisations who have used the maps on their websites in a similar manner, demanding that they either pay up to $10,000 or more, or to face legal action. In most cases matters were settled out of court. SLA v. Virtual Map In October 2006, Virtual Map became embroiled in a civil suit against the ex-provider, Singapore Land Authority (SLA), a statutory board under the Singapore Ministry of Law.\\"Land Authority sues StreetDirectory.com for copyright infringement\\", Oo Gin Lee for CNet Blogs, 24 November 2006 Until July 2004, Singapore Land Authority (SLA) provided digitised data to Virtual Map non-exclusively under seven agreements that the latter has signed, and claims that the latter has infringed SLA's copyright by continually selling and redistributing its maps even after the expiration of the agreements.\\"The roadmap to the courts\\", Leong Wee Keat, Today for Channel NewsAsia, 24 November 2006\\"Land authority sues online map company\\", Elena Chong, The Straits Times, 10 January 2006, H6 The statutory board is currently seeking damages, an injunction to prevent further use of the data by Virtual Map, an order to disclose its client's list and addresses, and to destroy all copies of the infringing material. In its defence, Virtual Map has reiterated that its works have been sufficiently original, an argument which held in Suncool's unsuccessful appeal against the company. The defendant has also claimed that SLA has obtained information from other agencies that it did not own.\\"Firm says its maps different from SLA's\\", Tor Ching Li, Today, 9 January 2006 On the second day of the trial, three SLA employees took the stand to testify that Virtual Map has copied \\"SLA's skeleton\\", which has been the \\"hard work, skill, labour and money invested by the government\\", and pointed out several irregularities in Virtual Map's work.\\"Is 'altered copying' an infringement?\\", Tan Hui Leng, Today, 10 January 2006 The trial began on 8 January 2007. SLA has since set up an alternative website that allows non- commercial users to download its maps for free. Eight months later on 7 August 2007, a district court ruled that Virtual Map's online maps on streetdirectory.com had breached SLA's copyright. District Judge Thian Yee Sze also held that Virtual Map should stop \\"dealing in maps which are reproductions of SLA's street directory vector data and address point vector data\\", and further ordered an inquiry into the damages due to SLA. Lawyers from Drew & Napier represented SLA, while Virtual Map was defended by counsel from Rodyk & Davidson. Streetdirectory.com lost its subsequent appeal on the decision, but it did not affect the earlier legal settlements against hundreds of businesses and organisations. However, it had to shut down its map service pending replacement of its map data.\\"Virtual Map goes to court again\\", Tham Yuen-C, The Straits Times, 21 August 2007Virtual Map shuts down street directory site after losing suit , Chua Hian Hou, The Straits Times, 3 April 2008 Acquisition On 1 August 2008, four months after the lawsuit, Streetdirectory.com and the remaining assets of Virtual Map was acquired by JobsDB for an undisclosed sum.

Årstabroarna () are two parallel railway viaducts in central Stockholm, Sweden. Passing over the watercourse of Årstaviken and the islets Årsta holmar, they connect the major island Södermalm to the southern mainland district Årsta.  Eastern Årsta Bridge  The eastern bridge, the older of the two and still often referred to as Årstabron (\\"The Årsta Bridge\\"), is still in operation almost 80 years after its inauguration in 1929. When projected in the early 1920s, an agreement between the state and the city stipulated the arterial railway passing through the city had to be made independent of the sea route passing beneath it. It was therefore decided that the railway should be relocated to a bridge passing over Årsta holmar, with a horizontal clearance of 26 metres ensured by a bascule bridge over the northern passage, and a truss arch bridge (The truss is the old one) over the southern passage offering a span of 100 metres. In front of a reworked agreement in 1925, the city, intending to add an iron roadway passing above the present railway, required the bridge to be reinforced accordingly, and additionally it was decided the planned bascule bridge should be replaced by a lift bridge. The plans were carried through and the bridge opened in 1929. The bridge, on its completion the longest bridge in Sweden, was designed be the architect Cyrillus Johansson (1884–1959) and the engineers Ernst Nilsson (1874–1946) and Salomon Kasarnowsky (1887–1960). It has often been compared to a classical Roman aqueduct, and is today declared a historical landmark.A spectacular aerial view of the bridge and viaduct can be seen on the video for Abba's 1982 hit 'The Day before you came'. Possible ways of adding car lanes atop the bridge were discussed on several occasions during the remainder of the 20th century, the most elaborate plans, in 1960, being to have a motorway, called Tantoleden, connect Ringvägen and Årsta by building a new bridge on the west side of the old.  Western Årsta Bridge  A western bridge, designed by Sir Norman Foster (1935-), 833 metres long and 19,5 metres wide, was finally inaugurated in 2005. Along with the new bridge a new commuter train station, Årstaberg, was created south of the bridges. Twice the width of the old, thus permitting an elevated pathway next to the railway, the pillars of the new bridge are not only much more slender, but also reduced to ten, less than half of the old. Preceded by two decades of fiery debate, as Foster had the bridge painted in falu red, a traditional deep red colour, the bridge was nicknamed falukorven (a Swedish sausage) by its critics.

Formerly its own municipality, the community was annexed by San Jose in 1936 and it remains relatively independent with a suburban feel. The neighborhood has walkable tree-lined streets, diverse architecture, specialty shops, and independent businesses. The historic downtown on Lincoln Avenue between Willow Street and Minnesota Avenue is a well-known destination, with a variety of restaurants and shops. Today, Willow Glen continues to experience high property valuation and it is considered one of the most desirable residential neighborhoods in San Jose. History Cherry Avenue, south of Britton Avenue The Roberto-Suñol historical site The neighborhood began in the mid-1800s as Rancho Los Coches (Sunol) and Rancho San Juan Bautista, Mexican land grants adjacent to the San Jose pueblo. By the 1860s the small unincorporated community needed its first school, and Willow Glen Elementary School was founded in 1863 on land donated by Ira Cottle. Willow Glen continued as an unincorporated community until the 1920s, when the City of San Jose ordered the Southern Pacific Railroad to re-route the Southern Pacific Railroad trunk line which at that time was going down Fourth Street. The Southern Pacific then proposed to re-route down Lincoln Avenue. In order to forestall that attempt, Willow Glen was incorporated as a city in 1927. The railroad was instead re-routed to its current route through a then-unincorporated area now known as North Willow Glen, where its principal user is now Caltrain. Being a city, however, required thinking about issues such as sewage. Willow Glen had no sewer system – individual homes had their own cesspools or septic systems. Because the area was marshy before being drained for Willow Glen, the high water table resulted in raw sewage often spilling above-ground from flooded cesspools. Rather than build their own very expensive sewage treatment system, in 1936 Willow Glen's residents opted to be annexed to San Jose and be linked to San Jose's sewage system, the measure passing by a vote of 17 to 38. Lincoln Avenue was renamed from \\"Willow Glen Road\\" in 1865, shortly after the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln. Etymology and Development \\"Willow Glen\\" was named for the marshy wet area between the Guadalupe River and Los Gatos Creek. The soggy land tended to produce vegetation like willows and cattails that are somewhat unique to the immediately surrounding area. As both waterways run south to north, the marsh was damper and less viable for planting and grazing year-round north toward the fork. What was historically called 'Willow Glen' would have actually originated at its northernmost point where the Los Gatos Creek runs into the Guadalupe River. This is the approximate site of the SAP Center in downtown San Jose today and would not be considered part of the Willow Glen neighborhood. Over time, the historical community developed between the Guadalupe River and Los Gatos Creek, roughly two miles south of the point where they intersect, and beneath what is today Interstate 280. The modern community was largely founded by Frank Lewis and Isaac Bird (the namesake of \\"Bird Avenue\\"). Lewis noticed the potential of the marsh for raising crops and orchards, and in 1860 dug the channel between Willow Street and Curtner Avenue that carries the Guadalupe River to this day. That channel effectively drained the marsh and opened Willow Glen for farming. In turn, Bird started farming hops on the newly available farmland and found instant success producing some of the best hops and barley in the region. Bird's continued success brought fame to the region among local growers. By the late 1800s, Willow Glen was generally considered one of the most ideal spots in all of Santa Clara County for raising wheat, barley, hay, tobacco and hops. By 1880, plots of Willow Glen farmland were priced nearly 10 times higher than similar plots in the valley. Geography Map of Willow Glen's neighborhood boundaries. Minnesota Avenue Willow Glen includes areas within zip code 95125, though not all of the zip code area can actually be considered to be part of the Willow Glen neighborhood, and there are areas within the 95126 zip code that many people would consider to be part of Willow Glen. The Willow Glen Neighborhood Association's by-laws reserve voting memberships to individuals and businesses within boundaries of the Association defined by the San Jose 2009 Greenprint - Willow Glen Planning Area Map, and within 1/2 mile of the Greenprint boundary. Interstate 280 is almost universally accepted as the community's northern border. The Guadalupe River was the original eastern border of Willow Glen during its time as a municipality. The Los Gatos Creek originally served as a natural western end for the community, until 1866, when extreme flooding of the creek caused it to naturally cut a new channel running far west around what was traditionally considered Willow Glen. The reshaped creek left behind a dry creek bed, known as the \\"Dry Creek,\\" and opened up Willow Glen for greater southwest expansion. Architecture Willow Glen neighborhoods are almost exclusively composed of custom or semi-custom homes in a diverse range of architectural styles. Many architect-commissioned houses can be seen in the neighborhood, including Victorian, Neoclassical (Queen Anne Cottage and Neocolonial), Colonial Revival, Craftsman, Mission, Prairie, Spanish Eclectic, Eichler Homes, and Tudor. In recent years many smaller houses have been replaced with larger houses. Events =Dancin' on the Avenue= Dancin' on the Avenue was Willow Glen's annual street party that occurs on one day in the summer, along Lincoln Avenue between Willow Street and Minnesota Avenue. The event was organized by the Willow Glen Business Association. It ran from 1995 to 2018. =Founders' Day= Founders' Day occurs in September although it has not been celebrated every year. The event celebrates the rich history, cultural heritage, and progressive present of the neighborhoods, homes, and community of Willow Glen. The highlight is a festive parade that proceeds down Lincoln Avenue. The origins of Founders' Day are not known. Archives of the Willow Glen Resident newspaper indicate it originates from the area's nine years of independence from San Jose between September 8, 1927 and September 4, 1936. Another view is that it celebrates the work of Antonio Maria Sunol who built Laura Ville in 1847. =Christmas tree lights= Willow Glen Christmas decorations Willow Glen residents have a distinct Christmas tree decoration tradition. This tradition involves buying similar, very small, Christmas trees and placing them in the front yard ten feet from the sidewalk with multicolored lights. People and businesses in the neighborhood generally make significant decorations every year, both within the neighborhood and in the Lincoln Avenue business district, drawing visitors from all around the area. The tradition of a Christmas tree on each residence's lawn was started in 1950 by Robert and Arlene Cimino. Trees were purchased in bulk from the Knights of Columbus and delivered to participating homes. The Ciminos moved from the area in 1956 and the tradition was continued by Frank Badagliacca, Jr. His wife, Dolores Badagliacca, came up with the idea of putting a single white light on the top of each tree. The tradition now stretches to over 200 streets in the greater San Jose area., Transportation Although no railway stations exist within Willow Glen, the area is served well by VTA light rail's Blue Line and Caltrain stations on or near its borders: Fruitdale, Race, Curtner, Tamien, Diridon, and Virginia. =Trails and bikeways= The two sections of the Los Gatos Creek Trail terminate in Willow Glen. The connection requires on-street travel through much of Willow Glen. One section of the Guadalupe River Trail terminates near the far north east edge of Willow Glen but otherwise does not run through it. The Highway 87 Bikeway runs along the eastern edge of Willow Glen but terminates at Willow Street at its most northern point. The Three Creeks Trail runs diagonally through Willow Glen and passes close to downtown.

Popular products included the Scientific Solutions LabMaster series of boards for S-100 and Apple computers.Origins of Tecmar  Scientific Solutions  right In 1981, at the COMDEX show, Tecmar introduced 20 expansion cards for the new IBM Personal Computer (PC) announced three months earlier. Using experience in developing scientific and industrial products for Intel 8086 microcomputers, the company purchased two PCs on the first day and up to 50 employees worked on the peripherals; Tecmar's speed surprised even IBM. These products included the Scientific Solutions LabMaster, LabTender, IEEE-488, BaseBoard, TimeMaster, GraphicsMaster, memory expansion boards, external hard disk drives and tape drives. In 1985, Tecmar incorporated Scientific Solutions Inc. and used this new company to design and distribute the data acquisition products. Their early achievements are now well known and expressed by their corporate saying: Scientific Solutions First in PC Data Acquisition. Scientific Solutions has been an independent company since 1995 and is still active as of 2019.Scientific Solutions, Inc.  Repositioning as a tape brand  In 1986, Tecmar was acquired by the technology holding company Rexon. While Scientific Solutions continued to design and market scientific and multimedia products, Tecmar concentrated on data storage. In 1991, Rexon purchased two other tape drive manufacturers, WangTek and WangDAT to add to the Tecmar product line. Then in 1995, while Rexon was having financial difficulties, Tecmar was sold to Legacy Storage Systems and Scientific Solutions continued as an independent company focused on the original Tecmar product line of data acquisition equipment. Three years later, in 1998, Tecmar was sold to a new holding company, TTI,Acquisition by TTI which positioned Tecmar as a comprehensive magnetic tape data storage brand. This was reinforced in 1999 when Iomega sold their Ditto brand to Tecmar.Acquisition of Ditto brand At this time, Tecmar offered DAT, QIC, Travan and Ditto magnetic tape technologies. In 2000, Overland Data saw this and acquired TecmarAcquisition by Overland in an effort to complement its line of higher end tape products. This did not last long.

Cornelis de Bruijn wrote in 1703: :\\"In the locality in which we were, to our great surprise, we found many elephant teeth, of which I kept one myself, for the sake of curiosity, but I can not understand how these teeth could get here. True, the Emperor [Peter I] told us that Alexander the Great, passing this river, as some historians assure, reached the small town of Kostenka, about eight versts from here, and that it could very well be that at that time several elephants had fallen, the remains of which are still here today.\\" The site is also mentioned by Samuel Gottlieb Gmelin in 1768. The settlement name Kostyonki itself is a derivation from \\"bone\\". Kostenki-1 was excavated by I. S. Polyakov (1845-1887) in 1879. Further excavations during 1881-1915 were mostly searches for stone tools. Systematic excavations were performed from the 1920s, most notably those led by P.P. Efimenko during 1923-1938\\\\. In the second half of the 20th century it was recognized that there were other sites in the neighbourhood, now labelled Kostenki-1 to Kostenki-21 and Borshchevo-1 to Borshchevo-5. The most famous of these are Kostenki-12 (Volkovska) and Kostenki-14 (Markina Gora). A 25,000-year-old bone circle structure of at least 60 mammoths, measuring over in diameter, was discovered at Kostenki in 2020.

This initial cultural development might be attributable to local Neanderthals. Ornaments predating the volcanic eruption, found at Kostenki 17/2 (\\"Spitsyn culture\\", 38–32 ka), were apparently perforated by a hand-operated rotary drill or drills; these may suggest that the population was technologically capable of preparing for a volcanic winter.

Human remains Ancient dwelling reconstruction in the Kostyonki In the period around 40-24 kya, a latitudinal clinal pattern of modern/Neanderthal traits was indicated in Europe. The Kostyonki sites are located at the more modern eastward end. The earliest directly dated human remains from this site are dated to 32,600 ± 1,100 14C years and consist of a tibia and a fibula, with traits classifying the bones as European early modern humans. In 2009, DNA was extracted from the remains of a male hunter-gatherer from Kostenki-12 who lived circa 30,000 BP and died aged 20–25. His maternal lineage was found to be mtDNA haplogroup U2. He was buried in an oval pit in a crouched position and covered with red ochre. Kostenki 12 was later found to belong to the patrilineal Y-DNA haplogroup C1* (C-F3393). Fu 2016. A male from Kostenki-14 (Markina Gora), who lived approximately 35–40,000 BP, was also found to belong to mtDNA haplogroup U2. His Y-DNA haplogroup was C1b* (C-F1370). The Kostenki-14 genome represents early evidence for the separation of Europeans and East Asian lineages. It was found to have a close relationship to both \\"Mal'ta boy\\" (24 ka) of south-east Siberia (Ancient North Eurasian) and to the later Mesolithic hunter-gatherers of Europe and western Siberia, as well as with a basal population ancestral to Early European Farmers, but not to East Asians.

Plot The story is based on the novel of the same name by Mai Muengderm. In 1936 in rural Bang Kapi, at the time nothing but rice paddies and small farming villages, Kwan and Riam are the son and daughter of rival village chiefs. They both work in the rice fields with their water buffaloes. Riam at first resists the courtship of Kwan, but Kwan, a jolly young man who sings and plays bamboo flute, is persistent. Kwan pleads with Riam, telling her he wants to die in the river if he doesn't have her love. Riam gives in to Kwan's charms and the two pledge their love for each other at a spirit shrine on an island in the river. Riam's father disapproves of the relationship. He wants Riam to marry Joi, the son of a wealthy local nobleman. Riam's father, Joi and some other men go to confront Kwan and find him on the spirit-house island with Riam. A brief sword fight ensues, and Kwan is struck by sword wielded by Riam's older brother, Roen. The cut on the side of Kwan's head eventually becomes a noticeable scar, which Kwan says is a mark of his love for Riam. At home, Riam is chained up in a storage shed. Her father then decides to send Riam to Bangkok, where she will be sold into slavery as a maid for Mrs. Thongkham, a money lender who holds the deed to Riam's father's land. When the woman sees Riam's face, she is struck by Riam's resemblance for her dead daughter. Instead of being put to work as a servant, Riam is essentially adopted by the woman, who gives Riam Western clothes and introduces her to high-class Bangkok society, including the son of a wealthy nobleman, Somchai. Kwan grows despondent. His father urges him to enter the monkhood to wash away his bad luck. Kwan then goes to take a drink of water, and sees blood in the drinking gourd. He then breaks down and apologizes to his father for being ungrateful, and promises to be ordained the next day \\"if I'm still alive\\". After hearing that her mother is near death, Riam returns to the village on Somchai's boat. Riam arrives to see her mother die, and a funeral is held. Kwan comes to bid his last respects, and Riam agrees to meet him the next day at noon, on the spirit island. The next day, Kwan sets fire to Somchai's boat, to prevent Riam from leaving without meeting him. Kwan is then hunted by Somchai, Riam's father and older brother, Roen. Somchai finds Kwan and shoots him in the chest with a pistol. The mortally wounded Kwan swims to the spirit island. Riam then jumps in after Kwan, and grabs the knife from his hands and stabs herself, dying with her true love in the river.

The Occupation of Araucanía or Pacification of Araucanía (1861–1883) was a series of military campaigns, agreements and penetrations by the Chilean army and settlers into Mapuche territory which led to the incorporation of Araucanía into Chilean national territory. Pacification of Araucanía was the expression used by the Chilean authorities for this process. The conflict was concurrent with Argentine campaigns against the Mapuche (1878–1885) and Chile's wars with Spain (1865–1866) and with Peru and Bolivia (1879–1883). The Mapuche people had a history of resistance to Spanish conquest with the area known as Araucanía remaining de facto independent through the colonial era. Following an independence from Spain relations between the nascent republic and the Mapuches of Araucanía remained mostly amicable. However economical and geopolitical reasons together with increasingly negative attitudes towards the Mapuche made Chilean authorities decide to seek an incorporation of Araucanía, by arms if necessary. Mapuche chiefdoms responded in different ways, some aligned with Chile, other declared themselves neutral while a substantial group led by the Arribanos sought to violently oppose the advance of Chilean settlers and military. In the first ten years (1861−1871) Mapuches could not prevent Chile from advancing its positions but managed to defeat in detail small detachments avoiding large battles. Following ten years with few hostilities the Mapuches were unable to physically oppose a large Chilean army that in 1881 penetrated from the north to Cautín River, efectively putting most of the territory under Chilean rule. On November the same year Mapuches made a last-ditch effort to regain control of the territory by launching coordinated attacks against Chilean settlements. With most of these attacks repelled within a matters of days Chile went on the next years to consolidate its conquests. The conflict led to the deaths of thousands of Mapuche by warfare and smallpox. Many Mapuches faced hardship as result of not being able to cultivate and the due widespread pillaging by Chilean army and bandits, indeed many came to brink of starvation. Disruption of the Mapuche economy caused first by war and later by having their lands reduced plunged many into poverty that has persisted for generations.  Background  Mapuche groups in Araucanía around 1850. De facto Chilean territory in blue. Beginning in the second half of the 18th century Mapuche-Spanish and later Mapuche-Chilean trade increased and hostilities decreased.Bengoa 2000, pp. 45–46. Mapuches obtained goods from Chile and some dressed in \\"Spanish\\" clothing.Bengoa 2000, p. 154. Despite close contacts Chileans and Mapuches remained socially, politically and economically distinct. During Chile's first fifty years of independence (1810–1860) the government's relationship with the Araucanía territory was not a priority and the Chilean government prioritized the development of Central Chile over its relationship with indigenous groups.Bengoa 2000, p. 162.Bengoa 2000, p. 151. Domingo Faustino Sarmiento stated: > Between two Chilean provinces (Concepción and Valdivia) there is a piece of > land that is not a province, its language is different, it is inhabited by > other people and it can still be said that it is not part of Chile. Yes, > Chile is the name of the country over where its flag waves and its laws are > obeyed. = Expansion of Chilean agriculture = The Chilean agricultural sector was badly affected by the Chilean War of Independence.Bengoa 2000, p. 155. Following the Chilean silver rush that began in 1832, agriculture expanded in the Norte Chico. The next major expansion of agricultural activity occurred from 1848 onwards as a result of wheat demand during the colonization of Australia and the California Gold Rush. Despite the eventual vanishing of the Californian and Australian markets, wheat cultivation remained highly profitable. In the 1850s, with the German colonization of Valdivia, Osorno and Llanquihue and the onset of sheep farming in the Chilean territory at the Strait of Magellan, Araucanía remained the sole place for agriculture to expand.Bengoa 2000, p. 156. Mapuche lands around the south of the Bío-Bío River began to be bought by non-Mapuches in the late 18th century, and by 1860 land between Bío-Bío and Malleco River was mostly under control of Chileans.Bengoa 2000, p. 157. The Chilean wheat boom increased pressure to acquire lands in Araucanía by Chileans and led to numerous scams and frauds against Mapuches. A limited number of speculators obtained control over vast lands through frauds and maintained control over their assets with the aid of gunmen. A contrast appeared: while the Chilean economy had a booming agricultural sector, a large part of the Mapuche economy revolved around livestock operations in one of the largest territories any indigenous group had ever possessed in South America. = Shipwreck of Joven Daniel = Elisa Bravo Jaramillo who was said to have survived the wreck of Joven Daniel to be then kidnapped by Mapuches. In 1849 a ship travelling between Valdivia and Valparaíso, Joven Daniel, was wrecked at the coast between the mouths of Imperial and Toltén River.Ferrando 1986, pp. 395–396 The shipwreck was looted by a local Mapuche tribe and some of the survivors were killed. These events became first known in Valdivia and later in Santiago where they fueled a strong anti-Mapuche sentiment and reaffirmed prejudiced views that the Mapuches were brutal barbarians. President Manuel Bulnes's opposition called for a punitive expedition and Mapuches prepared for a confrontation with the Chilean Army. Bulnes however dismissed the calls for a punitive expedition in view of its irrelevance to the eventual conquest of Araucanía. = 1851 revolution = When Chilean liberals began the 1851 Revolution Mapuche chief Mañil joined the rebel army and fought with José María de la Cruz's army against the troops of Manuel Bulnes at the Battle of Loncomilla.Bengoa 2000, pp. 163–165. After defeat at Loncomilla Mañil returned south. According to historian José Bengoa Mapuches saw the government in Santiago as their main enemy, explaining thus the participation of Mapuches on the side of José María de la Cruz Concepción-based revolt. = 1859 uprising = The encroachment over time of settlers advancing from the north across Bío Bío River into Mapuche territory and the appearance of German settlers in the south of the Mapuche territory led chief Mañil in 1859 to call for an uprising to assert control over the territory.Bengoa 2000, pp. 166–170. Most Mapuches responded to the call, except the communities at Purén, Choll Choll, and the southern coastal Mapuches who had strong links with Valdivia. The towns of Angol, Negrete and Nacimiento were attacked. A peace proposal made by settlers was accepted in 1860 during a meeting of several Mapuche chiefs. The agreement established that land transfers could only be made with the approval of the chiefs. The 1859 uprising reinforced the Chilean view of Mapuches as a dangerous threat to the emerging settlements in Araucanía and influenced public opinion in Chile to push for the complete incorporation of Araucanía into Chile.Ferrando 1986, pp. 398–402 These events contributed to the Chilean authorities' decision of occupying Araucanía.  Planning of the occupation  Photo of Cornelio Saavedra Rodríguez, the planner and military leader of the occupation until 1871. In 1823, Chilean minister Mariano Egaña had a project approved by Congress to colonize the territory between Imperial River and Bío Bío River, establishing a series of forts on the northern shores of Imperial and Cautín Rivers in the middle of Araucanía.Ferrando 1986, pp. 386-387 Chilean president Ramón Freire adopted the project initially but was later convinced to focus instead on the expulsion of the Spanish from Chiloé Archipelago, leaving the Araucanía issue pending. In 1849, Chilean minister Antonio Varas delivered a report to the Chilean congress analyzing the situation in Araucanía.Ferrando 1986, pp. 389-391 In his report, Varas recommended that a government regime distinct from the rest of the country should be designed for an eventual incorporation of Araucanía. Varas expressed the view that the eventual mission was to be to forcibly assimilate and \\"civilize\\" the indigenous inhabitants by altering their material standard of living to western standards and \\"raise their spirit to the moral and religious truths\\". Manuel Montt, as President of Chile, passed a law on December 7 of 1852 that created the Province of Arauco, a territory intended to administer all territories south of the Bío-Bío River and north of Valdivia Province.Villalobos et al. 1974, pp. 575-581. The final planning of the occupation of Araucanía can be largely attributed to Colonel Cornelio Saavedra Rodríguez.Bengoa 2000, pp. 170-174. The plan outlined by Saavedra envisaged a state-led colonization influenced by the developments of the United States frontier in sharp contrast to the old private enterprise-led Spanish colonization of Chile. The plan included the following points:Saavedra, Cornelio (1861) quoted in Ferrando 1986, pp. 405-419 #The advancement of the Chilean Army to Malleco River and the establishment there of a defensive line. #The subdivision of state land in plots and transfer of state titles of land in the territory between Malleco and Bío Bío River to privates. #The colonization of Araucanía by Chilean and foreign settlers gathering in particular locations foreign settlers of different nationalities to ease their assimilation. #Indigenous peoples were to \\"enter into reduction and civilization\\".  Occupation  Map showing the \\"old\\" and the \\"new\\" frontier established by 1870 = Chilean advance to Malleco (1861–62) = In 1861 Cornelio Saavedra Rodríguez ordered major Pedro Lagos to advance into the confluence of Mulchén River with Bureo River.Ferrando 1986, p. 426 A small fort was erected at the site between December 1861 and May 1862 after the local Mapuche chief Manuel Nampai handed over the land. From this fort the town of Mulchén grew. Following a custom inherited from colonial times, Saavedra assigned salaries to friendly Mapuche chiefs in zones of Mulchén.Ferrando 1986, pp. 427-428 Cornelio Saavedra attempted to pressure the Chilean government to approve his plans by presenting his renounce in December 1861 and again in February 1862.Ferrando 1986, p. 425Ferrando 1986, p. 429Bengoa 2000, pp. 189-192. In 1862 Saavedra advanced with a group of 800 soldiers into the remnants of the town of Angol while other troops reinforced the defenses of Los Ángeles, Negrete, Nacimiento and Mulchén. An eventual defense of Purén and Santa Bárbara was to be made by groups of civilians.Ferrando 1986, pp. 431-432 = Mapuche response and Chilean coastal advance (1863–68) = Saavedra retired from the army in January 1864 after political pressures from the ministers of President José Joaquín Pérez.Ferrando 1986, p. 437 The Chincha Islands War between Spain and an alliance between Chile and Peru made the government call Saavedra into the army again in 1866 in order to defend the coast of Araucanía against possible Spanish attacks.Ferrando 1986, p. 441 Saavedra ordered a fort to be constructed in the coast between Lebu and Imperial River. The government also granted Saavedra three steam ships to scout the coast.Ferrando 1986, p. 442 In December 1866 the coastal locality of Queule was occupied by Chilean troops. In response to the Chilean advances, the Arribanos decided to go to war while the Lafquenches of Budi Lake, Toltén and Queule had a meeting where they declared themselves neutral in the conflict but still loyal to the Chilean government. The Pehuenches did also declare themselves neutral. The Pehuenche chief Pichiñán is reported to have spoken against the Moluches, who wanted war, claiming that they engaged in robbery and received for that just punishments by Chileans. Historian José Bengoa claims Pehuenche neutrality was indebted to the fact that their lands in the Andes were not subject to colonization. In 1867 Saavedra called the Mapuches to a \\"parliament\\" where he informed them of the Chilean decision of fortifying the Malleco River line.Bengoa 2000, p. 197. The parliament was attended by around thousand Abajinos.Guevara, Tomás quoted in Bengoa 2000, p. 197-198. The Arribanos gathered around 2000 men near the parliament but refused to attend unless the Chileans sent some men as hostages. Despite this incident the a parliament was held the next day. Mapuches are reported to have been infuriated when they discovered the plans of Saavedra and that Mapuche chief Nahueltripai had allowed the Chileans to establish forts in his lands. These events lead to the formation of an alliance between the northern Abajinos and the Arribanos. = Second Chilean campaign (April 1868 – March 1869) = As the Mapuches prepared for war many moved their families to safe sites south of Cautín River (according to El Mercurio de Valparaíso) or to Lonquimay (according to El Ferrocarril).Bengoa 2000, pp. 205-207. The Abajino chiefs Catrileo and Pinolevi who had close ties with the Chilean government refused to join the Abajino-Arribano alliance and were in 1868 killed in a malón directed at them.Bengoa 2000, pp. 201-203. Painting of the Mapuche cavalry charge at Quecherehuas. In 1868 the Arribano chief Quilapán, son of Mañil, attacked a Chilean outpost at Chihuaihue. A group of Chileans led by Pedro Lagos came under attack while moving to Quechereguas. Yet another party of Mapuches defeated a Chilean Army group killing 23 of 28 soldiers. In response to the initial failure commandant José Manuel Pinto launched a scorched earth strategy in Mapuche lands in the summer of 1869. In these incursions by the Chilean Armies houses and crop fields were looted and more than 2 million livestock animals stolen from Mapuches. Part of the Mapuche civil population, including women and children, were either killed or held captive.Bengoa 2000, p. 208. In addition to the pillaging by the Chilean Army, bandits looted Mapuche property with consent of Chilean authorities.Bengoa 2000, p. 217. The Mapuches refused to engage in battles allowing the Chilean armies cross all over their territory.Bengoa 2000, p. 222. The differences in war materiel between Mapuches and the Chilean Army was huge, while Chileans used repeating rifles Mapuches had few firearms and used bolas, spears and slings.Bengoa 2000, p. 213. The war provoked a famine among Mapuches in the winter of 1869, with the situation being worsened by a smallpox epidemic.Bengoa 2000, p. 224. Some Mapuches sold their few remaining livestock and their silver adornments in the towns of La Frontera to obtain food. = Parliaments of Toltén and Ipilco (December 1869 – January 1870) = Cornelio Saavedra Rodríguez in a meeting with some of the main lonkos of Araucania in 1869 In late 1869 and early 1870 Saavedra arranged two parliaments; one at Toltén and another at Ipinco.Bengoa 2000, pp. 227-230. At Toltén Saavedra attempted to make agreements with the southern chiefs in order to isolate Quilapán. The chiefs attending the meeting could not agree on whether Saavedra should be allowed to establish a town in southern Araucanía or not. At Toltén Mapuche chiefs revealed to Saavedra that Orélie-Antoine de Tounens was once again at Araucanía. Upon hearing that his presence in Araucanía had been revealed Orélie-Antoine de Tounens fled to Argentina, having however promised Quilapán to obtain arms. There is some reports that a shipment arms seized by Argentine authorities at Buenos Aires in 1871 was ordered Orélie-Antoine de Tounens.Bengoa 2000, p. 187. A French battleship, d'Entrecasteaux, that anchored in 1870 at Corral drew suspicions from Saavedra of some sort of French interference. At the parliament of Ipinco the Abajinos rejected all the points proposed by Saavedra. The parliament did nevertheless serve to weaken the Abajino–Arribano alliance. = Declared war (May 1870 – March 1871) = In 1870 the Chilean Army resumed its operations against the Mapuches. José Manuel Pinto declared formally war to the Mapuches on behalf of Chile in May 1870.Bengoa 2000, p. 238. In the 1870-1871 period the Mapuches tended to evacuate their families in advance prior to the arrivals of the looting Chilean Army.Bengoa 2000, p. 240. During the winter of 1870 the Chilean Army continued to burn rukas and steal livestock. These inconclusive operations were subject of ridicule in some Santiago newspapers. Despite of this the situation of many Mapuche worsened; newspaper El Meteoro reported scarcity of food, livestock numbers had declined and harvest or sowing had not been possible for many Mapuches for almost three years.Bengoa 2000, p. 242. Domingo Melín, who went on behalf of Quilapán, sought unsuccessfully in 1870 a peace agreement with Chile. Portrait of Quilapán c. 1870. In the summer of 1871 Quilapán amassed an army that included reinforcement of Mapuches coming from Argentina and launched a campaign against the fortified Malleco Line and the settlers around it.Bengoa 2000, pp. 243-246. This attack was repulsed by the Chilean Army whose cavalry had recently changed its Minié rifles by Spencer repeating rifle giving them a distinct advantage against the Mapuches. Quilapán sent a letter in March 1871 to Orozimbo Barbosa seeking for a peace agreement. No agreement took place but hostilities ceased for 10 years (1871-1881).Bengoa 2000, p. 247.Bengoa 2000, p. 249. Cornelio Saavedra renounced to the command of the Army of Operations of Araucanía (Ejército de Operaciones en la Araucanía) in 1871 due to political reasons. = Informal truce (1871–1881)= During the period following the war of 1871 Mapuches in the Chilean occupied parts suffered many abuses and even murder by settlers and Chilean military.Bengoa 2000, pp. 269-270. Mapuches noticed the shrinking of Chilean garrisons as Chile sent troops northwards to fight Peru and Bolivia during the War of the Pacific (1879–1883). The apparent weakening of Chilean military presence in Araucanía and the many abuses caused the Mapuches to start planning rebellion. A case of horse theft in 1880 caused chief Domingo Melín to be escorted by Chilean troops to Angol in order to stand trial. Before reaching Angol Domingo Melín and some of his relatives where killed by the Chilean military.Bengoa 2000, pp. 271–272. The Mapuches responded to this by attacking the fort and village of Traiguén in September 1880. Almost thousand warriors participated in the retribution, evidence that according to José Bengoa the Mapuches had been preparing for war. The campaigns of the Argentine Army against the Mapuches in the other side of the Andes pushed in 1880 many Mapuches into Araucanía.Bengoa 2000, pp. 273–274. Pehuenche chief Purrán was taken prisoner by the Argentine Army and the Argentine Army penetrated in the valley of Lonquimay which Chile considered part of its legal territory. The fast Argentine advance alarmed Chilean authorities and contributed to the Chilean-Mapuche confrontations of 1881. = Chilean advance to Cautín (1881)= In January 1881 the Mapuches of the Malleco zone rose against the Chilean occupation. The town and forts of Traiguén, Lumaco and Collipulli were attacked.Bengoa 2000, pp. 275-276. Having decisively defeated Peru in the battles of Chorrillos and Miraflores in January 1881 Chilean authorities turned their attention to Araucanía seeking to defend the previous advances that had been so difficult to establish.Ferrando 1986, p. 547Bengoa 2000, pp. 277-278. The idea was not only to defend forts and settlements but also to advance the frontier all the way from Malleco River to Cautín River. Interior minister Manuel Recabarren was appointed by president Aníbal Pinto to oversee the process from the town of Angol. Colonel Gregorio Urrutia was summoned from Chilean-occupied Lima to Araucanía to take charge of the Army of the South. On March 28 Gregorio Urrutia founded the town of Victoria at the shores of Traiguén River.Ferrando 1986, p. 548 Racabarren personally led a large column that established the forts of Quillem, Lautaro and Pillalelbún. In this last place Recabarren was approached by some Mapuche chiefs who asked him to not advance beyond Cautín River. Recabarren answered by telling them that the whole territory was being occupied. At the founding of Temuco in the northern shores of Cautín River Recabarren met chief Venacio Coñoepán and other chiefs from Choll-Choll who asked him to not advance further. With the Chilean advance to Cautín River a small mountain range called Cadena de Ñielol remained a focus of Mapuche resistance from where warriors conducted pillaging raids or attacks against vulnerable targets.Ferrando 1986, p. 550-551 To end this activity Gregorio Urrutia established a fort in the range. Initially Mapuches offered little resistance to Chilean advance to Cautín River.Bengoa 2000, p. 281. Recabarren believed that Mapuches had not reacted because they expected the foundation of new forts and towns to be preceded by parliaments with Chilean authorities. Communes grouped by dates in which they were founded, 19th century communes were founded as forts. And those of Curarrehue and Teodoro Schmidt were organized from previous populations as early as 1981. = Mapuche uprising of 1881= A wave of Mapuche attacks began in late February 1881, just a few days after the founding of Temuco in the middle of Mapuche territory.Bengoa 2000, p. 286. The first major attack was against a caravan of carts carrying injured soldiers from Temuco to Fuerte Ñielol. The whole escort of over 40 soldiers and the 96 injured and sick soldiers were killed. In response to these attacks Gregorio Urrutia launched an attack on the Mapuche warriors of Cadena Ñielol burning in his way over 500 rukas and captured over 800 cattle and horses.Bengoa 2000, p. 290. On the other side of the Andes Pehuenches assaulted on March the Argentine outpost of Chos Malal killing the whole garrison of 25-30 soldiers.Bengoa 2000, p. 293. In mid-March Mapuche chiefs met to discuss the situation. They rejected the establishment of new Chilean settlements and decided to go to war.Bengoa 2000, p. 287. They set 5 November as the date for their uprising.Bengoa 2000, p. 298 A group of Arribanos attacked by mistake on wrong date, November 3, the fort of Quillem. This attack put on alert all Chilean garrisons in Araucanía, settlers took refuge in the forts. On November 5 Mapuches unsuccessfully attacked Lumaco, Puerto Saavedra and Toltén.Ferrando 1986, p. 552.Bengoa 2000, p. 297.Bengoa 2000, p. 300. Around Tirúa Costino warriors suffered heavy casualties in two engagements with a group of more than 400 armed settlers, campesinos and some soldiers.Bengoa 2000, pp. 310-311. Only Imperial was effectively overrun. The most important engagements were held at the fort of Ñielol and Temuco located at the heart of Araucanía. In these localities revolting Mapuches were unsuccessful in dislodging Chileans and their allies from fortified positions.Bengoa 2000, p. 321. The uprising was not unanimous as a number of Mapuche leaders and communities sided with Chile.Bengoa 2000, p. 313. After defeat uprising Mapuche chiefs were severely punished. The rukas of Ancamilla and other revolting chiefs were razed.Ferrando 1986, p. 555. = Occupation of peripheral areas (1882–83)= Chilean army during the Occupation of Araucanía. Cornelio Saavedra had considered the ability to cross the Andes one of the Mapuches principal military strengths. To block Mapuches from freely crossing the Andes and to assert sovereignty over the Andean valleys several expeditions were organized in the summer of 1882.Bengoa 2000, pp. 323-324. One expedition founded the fort of Nitrito in the Andean valley of Lonquimay, another founded Cunco near Llaima Volcano and yet another expedition founded Curacautín in the upper course of Cautín River. On January 1, 1883, Chile refounded the old city of Villarrica ending thus formally the process of occupation of Araucanía.Pinto 2003, p. 194. Six months later, on June 1, president Domingo Santa María declared:Ferrando 1986, p. 583 > The country has with satisfaction seen the problem of the reduction of the > whole Araucanía solved. This event, so important to our social and political > life, and so significant for the future of the republic, has ended, happily > and with costly and painful sacrifices. Today the whole Araucanía is > subjugated, more than to the material forces, to the moral and civilizing > force of the republic...  Aftermath  Map of land ownership in western Araucanía in 1916. Historian Ward Churchill has claimed that the Mapuche population dropped from a total of half a million to 25,000 within a generation as result of the occupation and its associated disease and famine.Ward Churchill, A Little Matter of Genocide, 109. The conquest of Araucanía caused numerous Mapuches to be displaced and forced to roam in search of shelter and food.Bengoa 2000, pp. 232-233. Some Chilean forts responded by providing food rations. Until around 1900 the Chilean state provided almost 10,000 food rations monthly to displaced Mapuches. Mapuche poverty was recurring theme in Chilean Army memoirs from the 1880s to around 1900. The Chilean government confined the mapuche to nearly three thousand reductions (called \\"títulos de merced\\"), comprising 500,000 hectares of land. The forts established in coast became nuclei for the formation of new towns.Ferrando 1986, p. 447 In the years following the occupation the economy of Araucanía changed from being based on sheep and cattle herding to one based on agriculture and wood extraction. The loss of land by Mapuches following the occupation caused severe erosion since Mapuches continued to practise a massive livestock herding in limited areas.Bengoa 2000, pp. 262-263. =Chilean and foreign settlers= Italian immigrant family in Capitán Pastene, Araucanía. When the territory of Araucanía was subdued the Chilean government issued calls for immigration in Europe. The most numerous groups of settlers were the Italians who settled mainly around Lumaco, the Swiss who colonized Traiguén and Boers who settled mainly around Freire and Pitrufquén. Other settler nationalities included Englishmen, French people and Germans. There are estimates that by 1886 there were 3,501 foreign settlers in Araucanía, another investigation points out that 5,657 foreign settlers arrived to Araucanía in the 1883–90 period.Pinto 2003, p. 225. At first Chilean settlers arrived to Araucanía by their own initiative. Later the government begun to stimulate the settlement of Chileans in Araucanía. Chilean settlers were mostly poor and largely remained so in their new lands.Pinto 2003, p. 217. =Education in Araucanía= In 1858 there were 22 public schools in the Province of Arauco. This number increased as with each new town established in Araucanía a school was built. Public education definitely overshadowed the older and tiny missionary school system in Araucanía during the conquest.Pinto 2003, p. 203. During the conquest many Mapuche chiefs were forced to send their sons to study in Chillán or Concepción. In 1888 the provinces first high school was established in Temuco.Pinto 2003, p. 204. Scholar Pablo Miramán claims the introduction of state education had detrimental effects on traditional Mapuche education in Araucanía.Pinto 2003, p. 205. The sons of Mapuche chiefs were the key targets of public education. =Violence and lawlessness= After the Mapuche resistance had been crushed Araucanía suffered a sudden rise in violence and continued to be an insecure zone for many years. Assaults and robbery were common. Because of this until the 1920s carbines, revolvers and other firearms were common in the households of Araucanía.Ferrando 1986, p. 620 In 1896 a police force called Cuerpo de Gendarmes de las Colonias was created to improve law and order in the provinces of Arauco, Malleco, Cautín, Valdivia, Llanquihue and Chiloé. This institution was until 1905 led by captain Hernán Trizano. Later Cuerpo de Gendarmes de las Colonias would be fused with other policing bodies to form Carabineros de Chile, Chile's current national police force.

Exterior image of St Mary's. Saint Mary's is a Catholic church in Calton, Glasgow, Scotland. It is the second oldest church in the Archdiocese of Glasgow and acted as the Pro-Cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Glasgow from 14 August 2009 to April 2011, during the restoration of St Andrew's Cathedral. The church building on Abercromby Street, completed in 1842, is protected as a category A listed building. Foundation A number of parishes pre-date St Mary's (St Mary's, Greenock, and St Mirin, Paisley; both 1808, St Patrick, Dumbarton, 1830, St Margaret, Airdrie, 1836; St. John, Barrhead, St Mary, Duntocher, and St Fillan, Houston; all 1841), but of all of these only Saint Margaret's, Airdrie, still has the original church (opened 1836). Airdrie is now in the Diocese of Motherwell, hence St Mary's Calton's claim to be second oldest in the Archdiocese of Glasgow. The church was built between 1839 and 1842 during the time of the Western District under the direction of Bishop Andrew Scott. The parish was founded, the church opened and dedicated all on 15 August 1842. Father Peter Forbes who, for the previous three years had toured Ireland fundraising for the new church building, was appointed the first parish priest from the same date. Bishop Scott was joined on the day of the dedication by Bishop John Murdoch, his co-adjutor and the titular of the church was designated as Saint Mary of the Assumption, commonly known as Saint Mary's, Calton. Father Forbes had raised £3,000 for the building (£5.4 million at 2005 prices) and so it was opened fully paid for and free of debt. It is also where the football club Celtic F.C. was founded. 2004 and following renovations In 2004 the building began a major renovation programme under the guidance of the famous Glasgow architects Page and Park. The first phase involved the back area of the church including the side-chapels and the sacristy area. The roofs were renewed, rot works carried out and repairs made to the external stonework. The stained glass in the side-chapels was restored and renewed. This phase was completed in August 2003. In 2006 the next phase took place—that of the complete renewal of the roof. This phase finished in December 2006. . The funeral of Tommy Burns took place there in 2008.

Their rise to power came about as a result of the death of Vira Narendrasinha, who left no legitimate heir- the throne passed to his brother-in-law, who was crowned as Sri Vijaya Rajasinha in 1739. A cadet branch of the Madurai Nayak dynasty, the Kandyan Nayaks were related to the Thanjavur Nayakkars as well.University of Ceylon review, Volumes 14–16, p.129.Enemy lines: childhood, warfare, and play in Batticaloa, By Margaret Trawick, p.40-41. In total, four Nayakkar monarchs ruled in Kandy, the last of whom, Sri Vikrama Rajasinha, was deposed as a result of the Kandyan nobility's collusion with the British and exiled to Vellore Fort in India.The Nayaks of Sri Lanka, 1739–1815: political relations with the British in South India, by Subramanian Gopalakrishnan, p.11-15. The Nayaks of Kandy were notable for re- establishing the long-dormant tradition among the Sinhalese monarchs of marrying from South Indian nobility, and for their childless marriages resulting in non-linear succession.Enemy lines: childhood, warfare, and play in Batticaloa, By Margaret Trawick, p.40. The Kandy Nayaks were practicing Shaivite Hindus, however were also patrons of Theravada Buddhism and paid tribute to the Buddhist sanghas. The stability and power of the Kandyan Nayaks were heavily reliant on the support from the Madurai and Thanjavur branches of the House, particularly in the form of military assistance against the Portuguese and Dutch- alliances cemented by intermarriage between Kandy and South India.Sri Lanka and the Maldive Islands, By Chandra Richard De Silva, p.111, p.137. Thus, intermarriage across the Palk Strait became a matter of policy for Kandy in 17th and 18th centuries. The Telugu-led dynasty of Kandy was the last dynasty of the island before being fully colonized by the British Crown in 1815. Origins The Nayaks of South India started as governors of Vijayanagara Empire ruling parts of Tamil Nadu during the 14th and 15th centuries. After the Vijayanagara Empire collapsed in the mid-16th century some of these governors declared independence and established their own kingdoms in Gingee, Thanjavur, Madurai and Chandragiri. The Nayakars were Tamil speakers of Telugu ancestry. They had often the Tamil language as court language. According to a Telugu work called Sinhaladvipa Katha, the Nayak king Kumara Krishnappa, who reigned at Madurai (1562–1572), is said to have conquered Kandy. Kumara Krishnappa killed the then reigning Kandy king, sent the late king's wife and children to Anuradhapura and placed his own brother- in-law Vijaya Gopala Naidu as his viceroy in Kandy.Ancient Jaffna: being a research into the history of Jaffna from very early times to the Portug[u]ese period, by C. Rasanayagam, p.385. The last king of the Kandy Mahanuwara dynasty, Narendra Sinha, died in 1739 without an offspring from his queen. His queen was a Madurai Nayak princess. Narendra Sinha's had nominated a brother of his Madura queen to succeed him;Census of Ceylon, 1946, Volume 1, Part 1, p.20 and he was crowned under the assumed title of Sri Vijaya Raja Sinha. Thus, Sri Vijaya Rajasinha succeeded the throne and established the Kandy Nayak line. Kandy before the Nayaks The last king of the Kandy Mahanuwara dynasty was Vira Narendra Sinha who ruled from 1707 to 1739. This king ascended the throne in 1707 when he was seventeen and was considered to be a very pious and scholarly. In 1708 the king married a bride from Madurai Royal family, the daughter of Pitti Nayakkar. Again, in 1710, he married another bride from Madurai. He had no children by either of the queens. He also had a secondary Kandyan wife from noble family of Matale. She bore him a son. However, the children of the secondary wife were not considered heirs to the throne. The king also had a concubine from a high caste, who bore him a son named Unambuwe, and did survive. The bar to his succession was the lack of royal status in the mother. Thus, the king nominated, as his successor, the brother of his first queen who had remained at the court ever since his sister married him. According to the law of succession that prevailed in Ceylon, the throne passed almost always from father to son, born of a mahesi or from brother to brother. However, when Narendra Sinha's brother-in-law succeeded the throne, the Sinhalese Kandyan aristocracy had no problem with this new form of succession. The practice of marrying princesses from Madurai is said to have come into occurrence as the Kandy kings insisted on consorts from the Suryavamsa lineage to grace their coronation and to produce heirs acceptable to the people.Contacts Between Cultures: South Asia, by K.

The new king, considered to be a man of considerable culture, devoted his entire attention to the furtherance of the majority religion Buddhism despite being a Hindu. He is said to have commissioned life sized images of Buddha in recumbent, standing and sitting postures to be cut in the rock caves in various parts of the country. His reign also marked several conflicts with the Dutch who were ruling the coastal provinces, based on trading issues. Sri Vijaya Rajasinha destroyed the churches and initiated a persecution against the Portuguese and Dutch, which was continued under Kirti Sri Rajasinha. It ceased only because the king considered that certain calamities which fell upon the country were due to his action. He married a bride from the Royal family of Madurai. Marriage alliance with Madurai royal family When the king ascended the throne he sought a wife from South India. For this purpose he sent messengers to Madurai in 1739. Since the Madurai Nayaks had now lost the power and prestige they enjoyed in the days of Vijayaranga Chokkanatha, the family members thought it advisable and even desirable to accept the offer from the king of Kandy. Hence the family of Bangaru Thirumala, who was now residing in Vellaikuruchi Fort near Thirupachetiram in Sivaganga Zamin responded. Two brothers Rama Krishnappa Nayaka and Narenappa Nayaka, kinsmen of Bangaru Tirumala Nayaka meet the Kandyan envoys at Ramnad. Narenappa Nayaka had a daughter of marriageable age and agreed to the Kandyan request. The brothers with their families and some kins accompanied the envoys to Ceylon for the daughter's nuptial; settled in Kandy with their kith and kin. Narenappa Nayaka was destined to be not only the father-in-law of one king, but the father of the next two kings of Kandy; for his two sons, the one five or six years old in 1740, and the other still an infant were successively to succeed Sri Vijaya Rajasinha. Sri Vijaya Rajasinha married another Madurai princess in 1747. Each bride brought a contingent of relatives with royal lineage ultimately making Kandy their permanent home. The king, however, died childless soon after, having nominated as his successor, his eldest brother in-law who had been living in the court ever since his sister had married the king. Thus by this peculiar mode of succession the son of Narenappa Nayaka who claimed kingship with the ruling Madurai Nayak family now ascended the throne of Kandy as Kirti Sri Rajasinha. =Kirti Sri Rajasinha 1747–1782= Kirti Sri Rajasinha was a prince from the Nayaks of Madurai royal family and brother-in-law to Sri Vijaya Raja Singha. He succeeded his brother-in-law to the throne in 1751. He devoted the first few years of his reign to the advancement of literature and religion. The king, later with the Dutch assistance got down to learning Bhikkus from Siam (Thailand) for the purpose of advancing Buddhism in Sri Lanka, also building the Raja Maha Vihara (Gangarama) was built at Kandy. Kirti built the existing inner temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic, and caused the Mahavansa chronicle to be continued from the time of Parâkkamabâhu IV down to his own reign. Attack on Dutch forts In 1761 King Kirti Sri Rajasinha attacked the Dutch garrisons and forts at Matara, Katuwana, Tangalle, Marakade and Urubokke, completely destroying them, and killing Dutch while some surrendered and ended as prisoners. In order to revenge the humiliation, the new Dutch governor Van Eck had immediate plans to attack Kandy, but the weakness in fortification and garrison forbade the Dutch. Later they did attach in 1764 and in 1765. Hence, in the early part of 1763 the Dutch were only consolidating their positions and gradually expelling Kandyans from the territories taken over from Dutch. Throughout 1763 the King continually sought peace and sent his envoys to discuss terms. The Governor wished the King to cede the three four and seven Korales and Puttlam and hand over the entire coastline of island to the Dutch. The king was not agreeable to any demand that diminished his sovereignty and was deliberately delaying a settlement hoping for help from the English in Madras after his discussion and negotiations with John Pybus 1762. Meeting with the British The King in mid-1762 sought help from George Pigot, Governor of Fort St George Madras for assistance. The British eager to obtain the monopoly of trading in cinnamon, pepper, betel nut (puwak) from the Kandyan Kings also wanted to expel the Dutch from the coasts. A reason to call on the British for assistance by the Kandyan King in 1762 was that after the treaty of Paris, the Dutch poured troops into Sri Lanka. They were bent on capturing Kandy from six directions (1764). Anticipating such a scenario the King sent an envoy to the English Governor of Madras to assist him in expelling the Dutch. This envoy, a junior Kandyan Official in the military made a clandestine trip to Madras Fort, and the English responded by sending their councillor John Pybus. John Pybus, a writer of the British East India Company, sailed to Kandy with a backup of five ships and about 200 armed men. A British vessel brought Pybus to Trincomalee on 5 May 1762. The Dutch knew of the arrival of Pybus through their spies and they were kept informed of his movements. Pybus took an exhausting covert trip to meet the King on 24 May 1762. After several talks without any conclusive decisions Pybus left after a month. The King gave him a ring, sword, a gold chain with breast jewels and left the country crossing the river at Puttalam pass while the Dissawa who accompanied Pybus presented the ships commander Samuel Cornish a gold chain and a ring in the name of King \\"Kirti Sri Rajasinha\\". John Pybus in his notes described the King as a man of tolerable stature, reddish in complexion and very brisk in his movements. Pybus was amazed as to how the kandyans had managed to fight a war with Dutch and had captured Matara Dutch Fort. He wrote that \\"They had put every European to the sword except two officers who are now prisoners of the country.\\" Marriage The Kandy King, Kirti Sri Rajasinha (Kirti Sri Maha Raja), married two daughters of Vijaya Manan Naicker, the grandson of Vijaya Raghava Nayaka of TanjoreUniversity of Ceylon review, Volumes 14–16, p.129 and also brought some dispossessed Nayaks of Tanjore to live in Kandy.University of Ceylon review, Volumes 14–16, p.127 He also married the daughter of one Nadukattu Sami Nayakkar in 1749. He further married three more Nayakkar queens from Madurai, but had no children from them. He had six daughters and two sons by his Sinhalese wife (Yakada Doli), daughter of the late Dissave (Headman) of Bintenna and granddaughter of the blind and aged Mampitiya Dissave. Both his sons survived the king and his daughters' married Nayakkar relatives of the king. Mampitiya's sons claim for the throne was overlooked and the choice fell on the king's brother who was living in court. The king died on 2 January 1782, of the injuries caused two months before by a fall from his horse after a reign of 35 years which the people saw as a great religious revival, and had a sentimental attachment to the King. =Sri Rajadhi Raja Singha 1782–1798= Brother of Kirti Sri Rajasinha, the new king who ascended the throne as Sri Rajadhi Rajasinha. He came from Madurai as a child along with his brother. Hence he was raised as Kandyan and Sinhalese; emerging as a brilliant pupil of the Malwatte Temple's chief Prelate at that time. He was quite a sophisticated person and learned many languages amongst which were Pali and Sanskrit. A lavish patron of Buddhism, he was a great aficionado of poetry and he himself was a poet. He died childless in 1798 without nominating a successor. The burden fell on Pilimatalava, the first Adigar (Prime Minister) Pilimatalawe, an able, ambitious and intriguing chief, to select a successor to the vacant throne. The controversial Adigar was also seen as one of the main reason for the demise of the dynasty. =Sri Vikrama Rajasinha 1798–1815= His Majesty Sri Vikrama Rajasinha, Last King of Ceylon The next king who ascended the throne was Prince Kannasamy, the former kings' nephew, barely 18 years old. He was crowned under the title of Sri Vikrama Rajasinha. He would also be the last king of the Kandy Nayakar dynasty and the last of Sri Lanka. During his time the British colony was fully established on other parts of Sri Lanka. There was a rival claimant to succeed King Sri Rajadhi Rajasinha, the brother of Queen Upendramma, who had a stronger claim. However, Pilimatalawe, the first Adigar (prime Minister) choose the South Indian Prince to the Kandyan Throne, with reportedly deep-seated plans to usurp the throne to set a new dynasty of his own. The young king, upon ascending the throne, faced many conspiracies and reigned through one of the most turbulent periods in Sri Lanka's history. Internal conflict During his time, the British who had succeeded the Dutch in the Maritime Provinces had not interfered in the politics of the Kandy. But Pilimatalava, the first Adigar of the king, started covert operations with the British to provoke the King into acts of aggression, which would give the British an excuse to seize the Kingdom. The Adigar manipulated the king into beginning a military conflict with the British, who had gained a strong position in the coastal provinces. War was declared and on 22 March 1803 the British entered Kandy with no resistance, Sri Vikrama Rajasinha having fled. The adigar massacred the British garrison in Kandy in June and restored the king to the throne. Pilimitalava plotted to overthrow the king and seize the crown for himself, but his plot was discovered, and, having been pardoned on two previous occasions, he was executed. The disgraced adigar was replaced by his nephew, Ehelepola, who soon came under suspicion of following his uncle in plotting the overthrow of Sri Vikrama Rajasinha. A rebellion instigated by Ehalepola was suppressed, after which he then fled to Colombo and joined the British. After failing to surrender (after 3 weeks of notice), the exasperated king dismissed Ehelepola, confiscated his lands, and ordered the imprisonment and execution of his wife and children. A propagandised account of the execution was widely circulated by sympathisers. Ehelepola fled to British-controlled territory, where he persuaded the British that Sri Vikrama Rajasinha's tyranny deserved a military intervention. The pretext was provided by the seizure of a number of British merchants, who were detained on suspicion of spying and were tortured, killing several of them. An invasion was duly mounted and advanced to Kandy without resistance, reaching the city on 10 February 1815. On 2 March, the kingdom was ceded to the British under a treaty called the Kandyan Convention. Exile and death Sri Wikrama Rajasinha is said to have governed the Kandy Kingdom as per the laws of Manusmṛti.Ceylon: a general description of the island and its inhabitants, By Henry Marshall, p.132 On 2 March, the kingdom was ceded to the British under a treaty called the Kandyan Convention. Sri Vikrama Rajasinha was captured and sent along with his family and attendants as a royal prisoner by the British to Vellore Fort in southern India. A son was born to him while he was in exile but he died without an issue. The king then adopted the son of his daughter as his own son who was titled .Twentieth century impressions of Ceylon: its history, people, commerce, industries, and resources, by Arnold Wright, p.65 During Sri Vikrama Rajasinha's time as a royal prisoner in Vellore Fort the erstwhile king received a privy purse, which his descendants continued to receive from the Government of Ceylon until it was abolished in 1965. Sri Wikrama Rajasinha died of dropsy on 30 January 1832 aged 52 years. Public works For centuries Kandy, originally known as Senkadagala, has been the bastion of Sri Lanka's culture and its spiritual centre. The palace complex at Kandy includes Sri Lanka's most venerated shrine, the Dalada Maligawa or Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic. Raja Maha Vihara (Gangarama) was built at Kandy by the second Nayak king Kirti Sri Rajasinha while his successor Sri Rajadhi Rajasinha was a lavish patron of Buddhism. The first Nayak king Sri Vijaya Rajasinha is noted for various erection of Buddhist statues throughout the Kingdom. The Kandy Lake overlooking Kandy was commissioned by Sri Vikrama Rajasinha.

An offshoot of the French Salmson company, it was taken over by local management. After producing war supplies during World War II, it ceased car production, moved to Glasgow, Scotland, and produced printing machinery. Foundation In 1929, the French Salmson company started a British branch company, Moteurs Salmson in Raynes Park, London, as a radial aero engine maker for the British Empire market. Taken over by British sports car racer Howard Martineau and investors in 1930, they renamed it British Salmson Aero Engines Ltd and continued production under license. As aero engine sales proved slow, the company extended the license deal to include local production of cars from 1934. Production =S4C= The British S4C had the same twin-overhead- camshaft, 1471 cc, four-cylinder engine and chassis as its French parent, but the gearbox was updated to include synchromesh on the top two ratios. The coachwork was to a British design and was available in four-door saloon, sports saloon, open tourer and drophead coupé versions bought in from Ranalah or Newns. Two engines were offered, the single carburettor 12/55 and the tuned, twin carburettor 12/70. The latter was claimed to take the car to 80 mph (130 km/h). About 230 are estimated to have been made. In 1937 the engine was enlarged to 1596 cc and the car became the S4D. Hydraulic brakes and transverse spring independent front suspension were fitted. The new car was heavier than the superseded S4C and in spite of the larger engine, there was no significant increase in performance. A curved back saloon and drophead coupé were offered. About 75 were made, production stopping in 1938. The S6D or 20/90 of 1936 to 1939 had no French equivalent. The engine was a six- cylinder unit of 2580 cc, still with twin overhead cams and the car was available as either Sports Saloon, 2-seater sports or drophead coupé. A maximum speed of nearly was claimed. Bendix cable brakes were fitted to the first few cars but later ones had Lockheed hydraulics. About 15 were made up to the outbreak of war. World War 2 and beyond At the outbreak of World War II, car production ceased and the company became a general engineering company, producing components and sub-assemblies for other manufacturers. Car production did not restart after the war, but a few small 31 cc engines for converting bicycles were made. The company eventually moved to Glasgow, Scotland, where they made printing machinery.

Frachtenberg helped write the Handbook of American Indian Languages, BAE Bulletin 40, and also wrote \\"Alsea Texts and Myths\\", BAE Bulletin 67. Early life and education Frachtenberg was born to Abraham Frachtenberg and Jeanette (Rottenstreich) in Czernowtz, Austria, now a city in Ukraine, on February 24, 1883. He graduated from the Imperial Royal Gymnasium, Przemysl, Austria, now in Poland, in 1904. After immigrating to the United States in 1904, Frachtenberg enrolled at Cornell University. He was awarded a Master of Arts from Columbia University in 1906 where his thesis was titled, Richard Wagner, his life and his works. During his studies at Columbia, Frachtenberg became a student of Franz Boas, often called the father of American anthropology. Frachtenberg's research centered around some of the subdivisions of what later became the Penutian language group, and he received a PhD from Columbia in 1910 for his work on the Coosan languages. Professional career Frachtenberg lectured in anthropology at Columbia until 1912, and in 1913 he became a \\"Special Ethnologist\\" at the Smithsonian Institution's Bureau of American Ethnology (BAE). While at BAE, he taught students at Chemawa Indian School in Salem, Oregon. From the school, he studied the ethnology of Alsea, Siletz, Quileute, Chimakum, and Shasta peoples with attention to art and religion. In late 1917, after returning from Salem to Washington, D.C., Frachtenberg was abruptly fired from his job at BAE for making comments derogatory to the government of the United States, at a time of heightened nationalism and World War I. Franz Boas tried to defend him, but the Secretary of the Smithsonian, Charles Walcott, dismissed him because he believed the comments were \\"inimical to the public welfare.\\" He did not, however, consider the comments disloyal, or treasonous. ound his comments He did not that he did not comments were neither Frachtenberg had immigrated from then Austria-Hungary, part of the Central Powers.

He was also national field director of Keren Hayesod during the 1920s. While conferring with Jewish leaders in Waterloo, Iowa, in 1930, Frachtenberg became ill.

When Eberhard died in 1440, his son Jean de la Marck began reinforcing the fortress, but it was Robert II de la Marck, the grandson of Jean, who finished the most important work. In 1530, the fortifications of the manor were modernised by the construction of a circular boulevard and terraces with cannons, thickening the curtain wall by an additional .

The Landsverk's were still in use up until the late 1960s. One L60 is preserved in running order and the other is in the National Museum of Ireland, Collins Barracks, Dublin. After The Emergency, the corps established a main battle tank cadre equipped with the Churchill, which formed the basis of the 1st Tank Squadron in 1959. This was equipped with the Comet until its disbandment in 1973. The Cavalry Corps has served in many locations on UN peacekeeping missions, including the Congo, Cyprus and Lebanon, either as Cavalry groups on their own, or attached as part of a battalion group. In these deployments the Cavalry Corps were equipped with Panhard AML vehicles - prior to their retirement in 2013. Cavalry Corps today The Cavalry Corps today is approximately equivalent in size to a single cavalry regiment; however the Defence Forces have never utilised the regimental structure (although there was an attempt during 1942 to organise units into a cavalry regiment). Instead, cavalry operates as independent squadrons. Today, the army has a total of three cavalry squadrons: *1st Cavalry Squadron (1 CAV) *2nd Cavalry Squadron (2 CAV) *1st Armoured Cavalry Squadron (1 ACS) The 1st, 2nd Squadrons are standard light cavalry units equipped with the Mowag Piranha AFV and other light armoured vehicles. One squadron is attached to each of the army's two infantry brigades to act as light armoured support. In addition to their regular duties, 2nd Cavalry Squadron also operates as the Presidential Motorcycle Escort, a task inherited from the Blue Hussars in 1948. The 1st Armoured Cavalry Squadron was formed in 1998 by the amalgamation of the 1st Armoured Car Squadron and the reformed 1st Tank Squadron. 1st Armoured Cavalry Squadron is an independent unit that is stationed at The Curragh.

He is best known for his pioneering work on Solid-state chemistry, where his work on oxidation rate theory, counter diffusion of ions and defect chemistry led to a better understanding of how reactions take place at the atomic level. His life and achievements were honoured in a Solid State Ionics symposium commemorating his 100th birthday in 2001, where he was described as the Father of Solid State Chemistry. Early life Wagner was born in Leipzig, Germany; the son of Dr Julius Wagner who was the Head of Chemistry at the local institute and secretary of the German Bunsen Society of Physical Chemistry. Wagner graduated at the University of Munich and gained his PhD at the University of Leipzig in 1924 supervised by Max Le Blanc with a dissertation on the reaction rate in solutions. \\"Beiträge zur Kenntnis der Reaktionsgeschwindigkeit in Lösungen\\" Career Wagner was interested in the measurement of thermodynamic activities of the components in solid and liquid alloys. He also carried out research on problems of solid state chemistry, especially the role of defects of ionic crystals on thermodynamic properties, electrical conductivity and diffusion. He became a research fellow at the Bodernstein Institute at the University of Berlin. It was in Berlin that he first became acquainted with Walter H. Schottky who asked him to co-author a book on thermodynamic problems. Together with H Ulich they published \\"Thermodynamik\\" in 1929, which is still considered a standard reference in the field. In 1930 he was Privatdozent at the University of Jena and published a notable paper with Schottky “Theorie der geordneten Mischphasen” (Theory of arranged mixed phases). His subsequent published papers led to the new concept of chemical disorder now known as Defect Chemistry. Wagner spent one year as Visiting Professor of Physical Chemistry, at the University of Hamburg in 1933, before moving to the Technische Universität Darmstadt where he was Professor of Physical Chemistry until 1945. He proposed an important law of oxidation kinetics in 1933. In 1936 he published a crucial paper “On the mechanism of the formation of ionic crystals of higher order (double salts, spinels, silicates)” a concept of counter-diffusion of cations, which contributed to the understanding of all diffusion controlled, solid state reactions. Over a twenty-year period he produced an important body of work relating to the bulk transport processes in oxides. Wagner and Schottky proposed the point defect-mediated mechanism of mass transport in solids, Wagner then extended the analysis to electronic defects. For these works and for his subsequent research on local equilibrium, his oxidation rate theory, and the concept of counter diffusion of cations, Wagner is considered by some as the \\"father of solid state chemistry.\\" At the end of the Second World War, it was anticipated that German universities and research establishments would undergo a long period of re-building and Wagner was invited to the USA to become a scientific advisor at Fort Bliss, Texas with other German scientists as part of Operation Paperclip. He acquired US citizenship at this time. His work on the thermodynamics of fuels used in V2-rockets was continued by Malcolm Hebb and their techniques are now known as the Hebb-Wagner polarisation method. Wagner was a professor of metallurgy at MIT from 1949 until 1958. He then returned to Germany to take up the position of Director of the Max Planck Institute of Physical Chemistry at Göttingen, which was vacant to due to the untimely death of Karl Friedrich Bonhoeffer In 1961 he produced a paper on the theory of the ageing of precipitates by dissolution- reprecipitation Ostwald ripening now known as the Lifshitz-Slyozov-Wagner - theory, which helps predict the rate of coarsening in alloys. When NASA tested the theory in space shuttle experiments they discovered the theory didn't work as they at first expected and realised the way engineers had been using it needed to be reconsidered.NASA Legacy Wagner officially retired in 1966 but from 1967 to 1977 was a Scientific Member of the Max Planck Institute in Göttingen, continuing to contribute to publications. Many modern inventions based on solid state technology and Semiconductor fabrication, used in devices such as solar energy conversion have been developed with the aid of Wagner's theories. Some examples of solid state electrochemical devices are typically, fuel cells, batteries, sensors and membranes. Wagner died on 10 December 1977 in Göttingen.

It is the federal legislature of the United States of America, continuing an unbroken chain dating back to the 1st Congress in 1789. The Senate has 100 members; the House of Representatives has 435 members and six non-voting delegates. Demographics In the Senate, there were 17 women: Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Susan Collins (R-ME), Kay Hagan (D-NC), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY), Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX), Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), Mary Landrieu (D-LA), Blanche Lincoln (D-AR), Claire McCaskill (D-MO), Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK), Patty Murray (D-WA), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Olympia Snowe (R-ME), and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI). There were 13 Jews, two Cuban Americans (Bob Menendez, D-NJ and Ted Cruz, R-TX), one Native Hawaiian (Daniel Akaka, D-HI) and one African American, Roland Burris (D-IL). The average age of senators in 2007 was 62 years.https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/RS22555.pdf The oldest senator was Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), born January 23, 1924. The youngest senator was Carte Goodwin (D-WV), born February 27, 1974. The median age of all Americans is 38 years.https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the- world-factbook/fields/2177.html =Religious demographics= The top five religious affiliations in the 111th Congress were Roman Catholic (30.1%), Baptist (12.4%), Methodist (10.7%), Jewish (8.4%), and Presbyterian (8.1%). Protestant denominations have held a large majority throughout congressional history, reflecting American's traditional demographics. In the 111th Congress, 54.7% of seats were held by members of Protestant denominations. 45 Jews served in the 111th Congress. Eleven representatives and six senators were members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Senator Olympia Snowe, as well as Representatives John Sarbanes, Zack Space, Gus Bilirakis, Dina Titus, Niki Tsongas and Melissa Bean are Orthodox Christians. In 2007, Keith Ellison of Minnesota became the first practicing Muslim to become a member of the United States Congress. He was joined by André Carson of Indiana following a special election on March 11, 2008. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii and Hank Johnson of Georgia became the first two Buddhists to be elected to the United States Congress on November 7, 2006. Johnson is a member of the Soka Gakkai movement and Hirono is a member of the Jodo Shinshu sect, although she is non-practicing. Both are Japanese Buddhist oriented. Senator Kent Conrad (D-N.D.) and Representatives Walt Minnick (D-Idaho) and Pete Stark (D-CA) were the only Unitarian Universalists that served in the 111th Congress. In a response to a survey from the Secular Coalition for America, Rep. Pete Stark became the only open atheist in the history of Congress. One member of the 111th Congress is a Quaker, Representative Rush Holt (D-NJ). Nine members of the 111th Congress were categorized Not Given / Unspecified / Unavailable / Don't Know. Hawaii is the only state that currently holds a majority non-Christian House delegation; both representatives Mazie Hirono and Colleen Hanabusa are Buddhists. =Sexual orientation= There have been six openly lesbian, gay, or bisexual members in the history of Congress. Gerry Studds (elected in 1972) became the first openly gay man to serve in congress when he publicly announced his sexuality in 1982.First openly gay person elected to Congress dies NBC News, October 14, 2006. Barney Frank (serving since 1981) first spoke publicly about his sexual orientation in 1987. Steve Gunderson, elected in 1980 and outed in 1994,The Advocate: Closeted in the capital: they're powerful, Republican, and gay. Will the marriage battle finally get them to come out to their bosses? and Jim Kolbe, elected in 1984 and outed in 1996, are two other previous members of Congress who were openly gay. Current Senator Tammy Baldwin is the first and so far the only open lesbian to win election to Congress.Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin  About Tammy In 1998, she became the first ever openly gay person to win election to Congress as a non-incumbent. She went on to become the first openly gay person to win election to the U.S. Senate in 2012. Former California representative Michael Huffington is bisexual, but did not come out until after his term had ended. Jared Polis (who was elected in 2008 and assumed office on January 6, 2009) is the first openly gay man to have been elected to the House as a freshman. Republican representative Mark Foley's homosexuality was well known in his district, though he did not serve openly in Congress and did not come out publicly until after his term ended. =Occupational background= Members of the 111th Congress come from a variety of occupational backgrounds. As of the start of the 111th Congress, members of Congress include: *269 members (227 Representatives, two Delegates, and 40 Senators) served in state or territorial legislatures *214 members (182 Representatives and 33 Senators) list their occupation as public service/politics *225 (168 Representatives and 57 Senators) list lawhttps://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R40086.pdf *201 (175 Representatives and 27 Senators) list business *94 (78 Representatives and 16 Senators) list education *At least 112 members of the 111th Congress were former congressional staffers, including nine congressional pages.

Of these, five (three Representative and two Senators) also hold a Master of Laws (LL.M.) degree. *83 Representatives and 16 Senators earned a master's degree – often a Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) – as their highest educational degree *27 Representatives and one Senator (Mark Begich) have no educational degree beyond a high school diploma. *23 Representatives (but no Senators) have a PhD *17 Representatives and three Senators have a medical degree (this number includes one Senator with a veterinary medicine degree and one Representative with a dental degree). *Five Representatives (but no Senators) have an associate's degree as their highest degree. One House Member has a licensed practical nurse (L.P.N.) degree. Three Representatives (John Shimkus, Geoff Davis, Brett Guthrie) and one Senator (Jack Reed) are graduates of the United States Military Academy, while two Senators (John McCain, Jim Webb) and one Representative (Joe Sestak) are graduates of the United States Naval Academy.

There were 167 veterans in the 107th Congress, 153 in the 108th Congress, 126 in the 110th Congress, and 121 in the 111th Congress.Amer, Mildred. Membership of the 108th Congress: A Profile. 2004.Amer, Mildred, and Jennifer Manning. \\"Membership of the 111th Congress: A Profile .\\" Congressional Research Service. Some were still serving as reservists during their tenure. On December 17, 2012, Senators Frank Lautenberg and Daniel Akaka became the last remaining World War II veterans in the Senate after Senator Daniel Inouye died of respiratory complications. Representatives Ralph Hall and John Dingell were the final remaining WWII veterans in the House of Representatives, though Representative Hall lost his 2014 primary battle and Dean of the House Dingell retired at the end of that same congress. On January 3, 2013, Senator Lautenberg was the final remaining WWII veteran serving in the senate until his untimely death on June 3, 2013. Sen. Jim Webb (D-VA), a Marine Corps veteran, served in Vietnam as platoon commander with Delta Company, 1st Battalion 5th Marines; he earned a Navy Cross, Silver Star, two Bronze Stars, and two Purple Hearts. Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) served in Vietnam as a naval aviator. Shot down during his 23rd bombing mission over Vietnam in 1967, McCain was captured and tortured as a prisoner of war and was finally released in . He earned the Silver Star, Bronze Star, Purple Heart, Distinguished Flying Cross, Navy Commendation Medal and the Prisoner of War Medal, though it was created years after his release. =Race/ethnicity= African Americans African Americans currently make up about 13% of the US population, but have historically been underrepresented in Congress. In the 111th Congress, 42 members (9.5%) of the House were African American. As of 2010, there was one African-American serving in the Senate. Roland Burris was sworn in as senator on January 15, 2009, after being appointed by Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich. Following the end of Burris's tenure in the Senate and his replacement by Republican Mark Kirk on November 29, 2010, there were once again no African Americans serving in the Senate. Barack Obama previously held Burris's seat but resigned from his position on November 16, 2008, after winning the Presidential election of 2008 and becoming the first African American to be elected President of the United States. Until the emancipation of enslaved African Americans after the Civil War and the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, blacks were generally barred from voting outside of the Northeast. As a result of these new laws, Joseph Rainey and Jefferson F. Long won election to Congress in majority-black districts and Hiram Rhodes Revels was appointed as senator from Mississippi (then a majority-black state) in 1870. However, the end of Reconstruction in 1876 marked a weakening of black rights and by 1901, when George Henry White left the House after losing a reelection bid, there were no African Americans left in Congress. In 1929, Oscar Stanton de Priest became the first African American congressman since White. He and his successor, Arthur W. Mitchell, spent their tenure as the only African Americans in Congress while representing a majority-black House district in Chicago. Not until the election of Adam Clayton Powell, Jr. of New York City's Harlem did Congress feature two African Americans serving at the same time in the modern era. The Voting Rights Act of 1965, which strengthened black voting rights, increased the position of black office-seekers. Shirley Chisholm became the first African American female member of Congress when she won a 1968 election in New York, while Andrew Young of Georgia became the first modern African American congressman from the South after he won election in 1972. In 1970, a year that saw the election of four black freshman congressman, black membership in the House reached double-digits. Only eight African Americans have served in the U.S. Senate. Hiram Revels and Blanche Bruce both served during Reconstruction in then majority-black Mississippi. Popularly elected black senators are Edward Brooke (served 1967–79), Carol Moseley Braun (served 1993–99 as the first black female senator), Barack Obama (served 2005–08), and Cory Booker (2013-). Roland Burris (served 2008-2010) was appointed to finish the term of then-president-elect Obama, and Tim Scott was appointed in January 2013 to finish the term of Jim DeMint, who left the Senate to head the Heritage Foundation. Brooke served in Massachusetts, while Braun, Obama, and Burris each held the same Illinois seat. Scott serves from South Carolina and is the first African-American U.S. senator from the South since Reconstruction. Booker won a special election in October 2013 and is the first African-American senator from New Jersey. He was elected to finish the term of the late Frank Lautenberg, who died in June 2013. Both Scott and Booker face reelection in 2014 and, should they run and win, would become the first elected African-American U.S. senators to serve in the chamber concurrently. Hispanic Americans Representation of Hispanics is somewhat complex, particularly because of the different ways to define membership in this group. Hispanics represent over 14% of the U.S. population, while the Senate was 3% Hispanic and the House was approximately 5% (25 members) Hispanic. Considering that Hispanics make up only 4% of American voters, Hispanic political incorporation has been relatively high compared with previous immigrant groups. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus has 21 members. José Manuel Gallegos, a Mexican American, was the first Hispanic in Congress. He was the first delegate to the US Congress from the Territory of New Mexico. The first to represent a state was Romualdo Pacheco, a Mexican American, who represented California in 1877. In 1929, Octaviano Ambrosio Larrazolo of New Mexico became the first Hispanic to be elected to the United States Senate. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Cuban American first elected in 1989, was the first Hispanic woman in Congress. While Hispanic women have served in House, none have been elected to the Senate. Unlike black Americans, Hispanics never were legally barred from the polls, and in New Mexico and California, they were a large and influential minority. Since the election of Dennis Chavez and Joachim O. Fernández to the House in 1931, Hispanics have continuously been represented in Congress. Most Hispanic members of Congress, including all elected prior to 1970, were of Mexican descent with the exception of Herman Badillo, who won election in 1970, becoming the first Puerto Rican from a mainland state in Congress. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen was elected in 1989 as the first Cuban American congresswoman. Prior to 2005, only three Hispanics have won a term in the U.S. Senate. These members were Octaviano Larrazola (served 1928–29), Dennis Chavez (formerly of the House, and served 1935–62), and Joseph Montoya (also formerly a House member, served 1964–77), all of Mexican descent. However, two Hispanics won Senate seats in 2004, Ken Salazar and Mel Martinez (the first Cuban American senator). As of the 113th Congress, there are three Hispanics in the US Senate: Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey; Marco Rubio, a Republican from Florida; and Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas. They are all Cuban-American. Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have a high level of political incorporation in terms of their actual voting population. However, as a result of this group's historically low voting rates, overall political incorporation of the general population is relatively low. The population of this group has increased in size by 600% in the last 30 years due to immigration. Despite high levels of naturalization and voter outreach efforts, this primarily foreign-born community with less than 1% of voters has 2% of congressional population. As 4.4% of the total population in the United States falls into this category, this 2% still represents less than half of the total Asian American and Pacific Islander population. There were eight members of Asian or Islander descent in the House and three in the Senate. Senator Daniel Inouye and Representatives Mike Honda, Doris Matsui, and Mazie Hirono are all Japanese Americans. Senator Daniel Akaka is a Native Hawaiian, Delegate Eni Faleomavaega is a Samoan, and Joseph Cao is a Vietnamese American. Bobby Scott of Virginia, who is also half African American, has Filipino American ancestry. Steve Austria of Ohio also claims Filipino American ethnicity. John Ensign of Nevada has claimed that he is 1/8 Filipino American, enlarging the number of those who claim to be Filipino American in Congress to the highest point since the Philippine Islands had been represented as a territory. Judy Chu became the first Chinese American woman in Congress when she won a special election in 2009. David Wu of Oregon is Taiwanese American. Robert William Wilcox, a Native Hawaiian who served as Hawaiian territorial delegate from 1900 to 1903, was the first Pacific Islander chosen to serve in Congress. Benito Legarda y Tuason and Pablo Ocampo joined the House in 1907 as Resident Commissioners, becoming the first Asian Americans to serve in the Congress, and beginning the representation of the Philippines which ended in 1947. Dalip Singh Saund (served 1957–63) was the first South Asian American in Congress and is one of only two Indian Americans to be elected to the legislature. Hiram Fong, who served three decades in the Senate from 1959 to 1977, is the first and one of only two Chinese American members to have entered Congress. Daniel Inouye (serving since 1959) was the first Japanese American in the House and later the first in Senate. Patsy Mink (served 1965–77 and again from 1990 to 2002) was the first Asian American woman in Congress. Bobby Scott, elected in 1993, is the first US born member of Congress to have Filipino ancestry. David Wu, elected in 1998, is the only person of Taiwanese ancestry to serve in Congress, while in 2009, Joseph Cao became the first Vietnamese American in the legislature. Only five members of the U.S. Senate have ever been of Asian American or Pacific Islander backgrounds. Four of these politicians have been from Hawaii. Native Americans Compared with the European American, African American, Latino, and Asian/Pacific American communities, American Indians, who comprise 1.5% of the population, are the most underrepresented group. Tom Cole, a Chickasaw, and Markwayne Mullin, a Cherokee, are the only registered American Indians currently in Congress. Tracking Native American members of Congress is complex, since many people of mixed blood are not registered as part of the American Indian population. Charles Curtis, who was three-eighths Native American and had ancestry from a variety of different tribes, was elected in 1892 as the first U.S. representative from this group. Curtis accomplished several other firsts during his political tenure. He became the first American Indian to serve in the US Senate (in office 1907–13 and 1915–29), to lead a major party (served as Republican Senate Majority Leader from 1925 to 1929), and to obtain the office of Vice President. Several of the nation's major tribes have been represented in Congress in limited number. Charles David Carter (served 1907–27) was the first Chickasaw in Congress; William Wirt Hastings (served 1915–35) was the first Cherokee in the legislature; Ben Reifel (served 1961–71) was the first Sioux to win election to the body. Other than Curtis, only a few members of the U.S. Senate have been American Indians. Robert Latham Owen (served 1907–25) and Ben Nighthorse Campbell (served 1993–2005 after several previous terms in the House and the first Cheyenne in Congress) are the others to have earned that distinction. Middle Eastern Americans Middle Eastern Americans also have typically low levels of voting incorporation, except among a particular voting group. As a group, Middle Eastern Americans are not measured by the U.S. Census, which, combined with differences in the definition of this group, makes measuring its percentage of the population difficult. Estimates place about 1.8% of the nation's population to be of this origin. Nearly all Middle Eastern members of Congress have been Lebanese Americans. George Kasem became the first Lebanese congressman when he won his first and only term in 1958. Since Abraham Kazen took office in 1967, serving until 1985, Lebanese Americans have consistently served in Congress. There are currently two Lebanese members of the House: Charles Boustany, and Darrell Issa. Five members of the U.S. Senate have been of Middle Eastern descent, all five with Arab American ancestry and four of Lebanese descent. James Abourezk, who served from 1973 to 1979, became the first Lebanese American Senator. George Mitchell (served 1980-95), who is half Lebanese, became the first Middle Eastern American party leader, as he served as Senate Majority Leader from 1989 to 1995. James Abdnor (served 1981-87) and Spencer Abraham (served 1995-2001) also were Lebanese American senators, while John Sununu is the only person of Palestinian ancestry to serve in Congress. Member of Congress Anna Eshoo is also of Middle Eastern descent, she is an Assyrian. Foreign-born Americans Two Senators were born overseas to U.S. citizen parents, John McCain of Arizona and Michael Bennet of Colorado, (who were born in the Panama Canal Zone and India, respectively. Senator Ted Cruz (Texas) was born in Canada to a Cuban (U.S. permanent resident) father and a native-born American mother. There were eight current Representatives who were born overseas—Lincoln Diaz-Balart, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, and Albio Sires from Cuba; Mazie Hirono from Japan; Ciro Rodriguez from Mexico; Pete Hoekstra from the Netherlands; and David Wu from Taiwan. Foreign-born Congresspersons comprised 2% of the voting membership of the House. This figure does not include four members who were born overseas to U.S. citizen parents: Geoff Davis (Canada), Chris Van Hollen (Pakistan), James A. Himes (Peru), and Diana DeGette (Japan).Office of the Clerk, U.S. House of Representatives. (2010).

Elections Elections for all House seats and 35 Senate seats were held on November 4, 2008, across the country. The Democratic Party increased its majority in both houses, and regained control of the White House before the end of the second term of George W. Bush.

Biography =Early life= Born in Brookfield, Missouri, Pratt graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1917. He received his commission as a second lieutenant after enlisting in the army during World War I, in August 1917.Don F. Pratt. - Arlington National Cemetery. - Retrieved: 2008-06-08 From 1932 to 1936, he served as adjutant, 15th Infantry Regiment, in Tientsin, China. Next he was an instructor, for the infantry school at Fort Benning, Georgia, from 1937 until 1941. Upon the United States entry into World War II, he was named chief-of-staff, 43rd Infantry Division, 1941-1942. His next assignment, in August 1942, was as the deputy commander, for the newly formed 101st Airborne Division, at the rank of brigadier general. Pratt was named the assistant division commander on September 15, 1943, under Major General William C. Lee. Stationed near the town of Newbury, England, on February 9, 1944, Lee suffered a major heart attack. Pratt thought that he would be chosen to succeed Lee, but Maxwell D. Taylor, then 82nd Airborne artillery commander, was given command of the 101st Airborne. =Invasion of Normandy= For the American airborne landings as part of the Invasion of Normandy, General Pratt, originally assigned to command the division train and reserve troops of the 101st to be landed by sea, received permission to land with a force of CG-4A Waco gliders assigned to Mission Chicago, the first U.S. glider assault during the invasion.Eckert, David. - Waco Drawings - Tribute to the American Combat Glider Pilots of World War II. - (c/o www.pointvista.com). - Retrieved: 2008-06-08 Pratt flew as a passenger (along with his aide 1st Lt. Lee John May), in the lead glider, a quickly substituted CG-4A with a bolt-on Griswold nose protection device, painted to represent The Fighting Falcon. The original \\"Fighting Falcon\\" was moved to position #45 in the flight serial. It was a CG-4A paid for by War Bond funds raised by Greenville, Michigan students who intended to raise the $17,000 cost of one glider, but ended up raising over $72,000. Piloted by Lieutenant Colonel Mike Murphy, senior glider pilot of IX Troop Carrier Command, and Second Lieutenant John M. Butler, the #1 glider came down into its designated landing zone, LZ \\"E\\", two miles west of Sainte-Marie-du-Mont, Manche, Normandy, between 0345 and 0400 hours on June 6, 1944. The Waco glider landed successfully but when Lieutenant Colonel Murphy applied the brakes, the tall wet grass caused the glider to skid without significant slowing, and it overran the landing zone, crashing into a hedgerow line of poplar trees. Lieutenant Colonel Murphy suffered severe injuries, with both legs broken, one a compound fracture. A tree limb came through the co- pilot side of the cockpit, killing Butler. Pratt, sitting in the Jeep, died from a broken neck resulting from whiplash. The Jeep was not chained, but was tied down with nylon rope and did not break loose. Lieutenant May was riding on the jump seat behind the Jeep and survived the crash. Pratt was first buried, wrapped in a parachute, in Normandy until the end of the war, then re- interred at Arlington National Cemetery (Section 11) July 26, 1948. He was succeeded by Gerald J.

Harnessing Nonlinearity: Predicting Chaotic Systems and Saving Energy in Wireless Communication. Science 2 April 2004: Vol. 304. no. 5667, pp. 78 – 80 PDFHerbert Jaeger (2007) Echo State Network. Scholarpedia. is a recurrent neural network with a sparsely connected hidden layer (with typically 1% connectivity). The connectivity and weights of hidden neurons are fixed and randomly assigned. The weights of output neurons can be learned so that the network can produce or reproduce specific temporal patterns. The main interest of this network is that although its behaviour is non-linear, the only weights that are modified during training are for the synapses that connect the hidden neurons to output neurons. Thus, the error function is quadratic with respect to the parameter vector and can be differentiated easily to a linear system. Alternatively, one may consider a nonparametric Bayesian formulation of the output layer, under which: (i) a prior distribution is imposed over the output weights; and (ii) the output weights are marginalized out in the context of prediction generation, given the training data. This idea has been demonstrated in Sotirios P. Chatzis, Yiannis Demiris, “Echo State Gaussian Process,” IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, vol. 22, no. 9, pp. 1435-1445, Sep. 2011. by using Gaussian priors, whereby a Gaussian process model with ESN-driven kernel function is obtained. Such a solution was shown to outperform ESNs with trainable (finite) sets of weights in several benchmarks. Some publicly available implementations of ESNs are: (i) aureservoir: an efficient C++ library for various kinds of echo state networks with python/numpy bindings; and (ii) Matlab code: an efficient matlab for an echo state network. The Echo State Network (ESN) belongs to the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) family and provide their architecture and supervised learning principle. Unlike Feedforward Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks are dynamic systems and not functions. Recurrent Neural Networks are typically used for: Learn dynamical process: signal treatment in engineering and telecommunications, vibration analysis, seismology, control of engines and generators. Signal forecasting and generation: text, music, electric signals. Modeling of biological systems, neurosciences (cognitive neurodynamics), memory modeling, brain-computer Interfaces (BCIs), filtering and Kalman processes, military applications, volatility modeling etc. For the training of RNN a number of learning algorithms are available: backpropagation through time, real-time recurrent learning. Convergence is not guaranteed due to instability and bifurcation phenomena. The main approach of the ESN is firstly to operate a random, large, fixed, recurring neural network with the input signal, which induces a nonlinear response signal in each neuron within this \\"reservoir\\" network, and secondly connect a desired output signal by a trainable linear combination of all these response signals. Another feature of the ESN is the autonomous operation in prediction: if the Echo State Network is trained with an input that is a backshifted version of the output, then it can be used for signal generation/prediction by using the previous output as input. The main idea of ESNs is tied to Liquid State Machines (LSM), which were independently and simultaneously developed with ESNs by Wolfgang Maass. LSMs, ESNs and the newly researched Backpropagation Decorrelation learning rule for RNNs are more and more summarized under the name Reservoir Computing. Schiller and Steil also demonstrated that in conventional training approaches for RNNs, in which all weights (not only output weights) are adapted, the dominant changes are in output weights. In cognitive neuroscience, Peter F. Dominey analysed a related process related to the modelling of sequence processing in the mammalian brain, in particular speech recognition in the human brain. The basic idea also included a model of temporal input discrimination in biological neuronal networks. An early clear formulation of the reservoir computing idea is due to K. Kirby, who disclosed this concept in a largely forgotten conference contribution. The first formulation of the reservoir computing idea known today stems from L. Schomaker , who described how a desired target output can be obtained from an RNN by learning to combine signals from a randomly configured ensemble of spiking neural oscillators.  Variants  Echo state networks can be built in different ways. They can be set up with or without directly trainable input-to-output connections, with or without output reservation feedback, with different neurotypes, different reservoir internal connectivity patterns etc. The output weight can be calculated for linear regression with all algorithms whether they are online or offline. In addition to the solutions for errors with smallest squares, margin maximization criteria, so-called training support vector machines, are used to determine the output values. The fixed RNN acts as a random, nonlinear medium whose dynamic response, the \\"echo\\", is used as a signal base. The linear combination of this base can be trained to reconstruct the desired output by minimizing some error criteria.  Significance  RNNs were rarely used in practice before the introduction of the ESN. Because these models fit need a version of the gradient descent to adjust the connections. As a result, the algorithms are slow and much worse, making the learning process vulnerable to branching errors. Convergence cannot therefore be guaranteed. The problem with branching does not have the ESN training and is additionally easy to implement. ESNs outperform all other nonlinear dynamic models. However, today the problem that RNNs made slow and error-prone has been solved with the advent of Deep Learning and the unique selling point of ESNs has been lost. In addition, the RNNs have proven themselves in several practical areas such as language processing. To cope with tasks of similar complexity using reservoir calculation methods, it would require memory of excessive size. However, they are used in some areas such as many signal processing applications. However, ESNs have been widely used as a computing principle that mixes with non- digital computer substrates. For example: optical microchips, mechanical nanooscillators, polymer mixtures or even artificial soft limbs.

As part of its remit, AoC NILTA works to support Adult Community Learning (ACL) as well as further education colleges and institutions. AoC NILTA works with and on behalf of post-16 learning and skills development in order to: *Drive forward the sustainable use of technologies to extend the opportunities available to learners *Support excellence in the quality of educational provision *Support innovation in the development and delivery of the learning experience for all AoC NILTA works to advocate and develop the use of ICT and e-learning in the post-16 education curriculum. AoC NILTA also has a focus on the use of appropriate Management Information Systems (MIS) and networking within post-16 institutions to facilitate and enhance the learning experience. AoC NILTA works closely with other advisory bodies in the sector and associated sectors, such as NIACE, e-skills UK, Becta, DfES, LSN, LSC, TechDis, ALT, Jisc and LLUK. History of AoC NILTA The National Information Learning Technology Association (NILTA) merged with the Association of Colleges (AoC) to form AoC NILTA in 2004. The concept of a national body to advise further education colleges about the use of information technology arose from an educational visit to Germany and France in September 1988. The visit was organised by members of Her Majesty’s Inspectorate and the group consisted of senior representatives from colleges and polytechnics. After the visit, the college members organised a residential weekend seminar to consider the implications of the visit for the UK further education sector. It was agreed to establish a voluntary organisation to encourage college staff to share examples of good practice. There was a founders meeting in London in April 1989 and the first national event was a conference in October at the Grand Hotel, Bristol. For the first year, the title of Standing Committee for Information Technology in Further Education (SCITFE) was adopted but was not endorsed by the colleges. It was renamed the National Association for Information Technology in Further Education (NAITFE) after one year. It was during the first year that regional committees of the Association started to be formed and A National Council was established to determine policy and direction. Very close links were maintained with the Department of Education and Science (DES) and the Inspectorate (HMI) and colleges were invited to join the Association for a modest annual fee. The Association did not have its own office but used member colleges’ premises for meetings of the Council and the Chairman (Peter Shuker), Vice-Chairman (John Gray) and Treasurer (Chris West) performed all of the administration. The national conferences provided a focus for innovation in ILT in FE throughout the period and fielded leading edge speakers from industry and government ministers. The Association was a pioneer of the use of video technology in its conferences (at a time when this was unknown in educational conferences) i.e. the pre–recorded interview with minister Tim Eggar at the second conference in Nottingham 1990 and the live dual video links with the minister Tim Boswell in 1991. The Association provided support to develop information and learning technologies in FE through voluntary professional contributions in an era, which preceded government-funded bodies such as the JISC Regional Support Units, BECTA, FERL, LSDA and LSN. In June 1991, the DES convened a meeting at its headquarters in Elizabeth House and invited key industrialists from the IT sector to meet with the Association to discuss actions that could bring mutual benefits. This meeting led to sponsorship for the Association and the inclusion of companies at the Annual Conference. Prior to the incorporation of colleges in 1992, the Council decided to appoint its first Chief Executive, Malcolm Himsworth on a part-time basis and Leeds College of Building became the host organisation for the Association. The Association became a limited company with charitable status and a wholly owned subsidiary company was formed to become the business arm. A curriculum sub-group and management information sub-group were established, the latter with strong support from the Further Education Funding Council. In 1995, the Association decide to change its name to National Information and Learning Technologies Associations partly to reflect the core business of supporting student learning and as part of the merger agreement with the CMIS Group. The FEFC's Higginson Report, completed during 1995 and published in 1996 after some FEFC delay, had coined the term ILT and NAITFE adopted the term soon after. Higginson had made a number of recommendations that would need NILTA's support to achieve. NILTA was invited to chair the three national consultative conferences in early 1996. Also in 1996, the Association organised its first international initiative with a visit to the American Association of Community Colleges Annual Convention in Atlanta. The Chairman gave a presentation to one of the option groups, with a video- conferencing link back to the UK. In December 1996, Malcolm Himsworth retired as Chief Executive to be replaced by Ernie Haiden. Ernie served until 1998 when Mary Barker was appointed as the first full-time Chief Executive. Later that year Peter Shuker stood down as national Chairman after serving for 10 years and Fred McCrindle took over the chairmanship.

Whitney (January 31, 1819 – November 10, 1914) was a Brooklyn grocer and Mayor of Brooklyn from 1886 to 1887. Early life Whitney was born January 31, 1819 in Oyster Bay, New York. He moved to Brooklyn at age 18, and worked in a grocery store at 20 Fulton Street. He eventually became head of the grocery, and remained at the store until the day before he died. 1885 Brooklyn Mayors race Reformer and incumbent Republican mayor Seth Low had fallen out of favor with national Republicans for crossing party lines to support Grover Cleveland over Republican James G. Blaine in the 1884 Presidential election. The national party blamed Low for losing New York State and thus the election. After losing party support, Low declined to run for a third term as Brooklyn Mayor in 1885. Not only was Low not on the ticket in the 1885 mayoral election, he refused to support the machine Republican candidate, General Isaac S. Catlin. Instead, he supported a reform candidate, General John R. Woodward. This Republican infighting presented an opportunity for Brooklyn Democrats to take back the mayoralty. Daniel Whitney was an affable local grocer whose store was on Fulton Street, near Brooklyn City Hall. Whitney built up a reliable reputation during his four terms on the Board of Aldermen. This gained him the attention of the local Democratic political machine, run by party boss Hugh McLaughlin. The Democrats chose the relatively inexperienced Whitney to run for Brooklyn mayor in 1885. With the Republicans split between Catlin and Woodward, Whitney was able to win the mayoralty of Brooklyn by 12,000 votes. Whitney's election marked the end of Low's reformist policies. Whitney's single mayoral term was described as \\"dull, plodding, but honest\\" by the Brooklyn Daily Eagle. Whitney was never particularly popular, but Democrats held power in Brooklyn for the next seven years. During this time Brooklyn city government returned to corrupt machine politics, as it had been before Low's time. After his time as mayor, Whitney left political life and returned to run the small \\"old-fashioned\\" grocery where he had worked all his life, and continued there until the day before his death. In later years, Whitney was a central member of the Society of Old Brooklynites, a civic organization which remembered and celebrated the old days when Brooklyn was an independent city. Personal life Whitney had three sons with his first wife; she died in 1889. He remarried at age 71 to Miss Henrietta Titus of Glen Cove, New York in 1893; she was 45 years old. Whitney was a member for over 50 years and trustee of the Sands Street Methodist Church. On January 30, 1909, on the eve of Whitney's 90th birthday, he was feted with a grand reception at the Sands Street church. \\"Several hundred\\" people attended, and speeches were given in his honor by Borough President Bird Sim Coler and ex-mayors Charles A. Schieren and David Boody. On November 9, 1914 Whitney left his grocery a little early and walked to his nearby home on Poplar Street. His body was found in bed the next morning by his housekeeper. He was buried at Green-Wood Cemetery. The New York Times reported that Whitney's estate was valued at less than $4,000 when he died, and described him as a \\"comparatively poor man.\\" References External links * Category:1818 births Category:1914 deaths Category:Burials at Green- Wood Cemetery Category:Mayors of Brooklyn Category:American grocers Category:People from Brooklyn Category:People from Oyster Bay (town), New York Category:New York (state) Democrats Category:American Methodists Category:19th-century American politicians ","title":"Daniel D.

Overview The play consists of four sections involving three sisters and their mother, each focusing on one of the women as she confronts various issues with the man in her life. Emily is a recent widow, relocating to a new apartment, who finds herself attracted to the owner of the moving company. Celia is the wife of a bigoted ex-Army sergeant whose reunion with an old pal leaves her out in the cold. Dorothy and her spouse discreetly try to learn if each has been faithful to the other as they celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary. Last of all is Ma, the stubborn Irish matriarch who rises from her deathbed in order to have a priest sanctify her common-law marriage to a Dutchman. Production Furth wrote his play intending it to be a tour de force for a single actress playing all four roles. The title is derived from the quote \\"Just as the twig is bent, the tree's inclined\\", written by Alexander Pope in his Moral Essays in 1773.

It is often used in religious festivals of Tibetan Buddhism (cf. tshechu). The instrument is played by strumming, fingerpicking or (most commonly) plucking.Dancing on the demon's back: the dramnyen dance and song of Bhutan, by Elaine Dobson, John Blacking Symposium: Music, Culture and Society, Callaway Centre, University of Western Australia, July 2003 The dramyen, chiwang (fiddle), and lingm (flute) comprise the basic instrumental inventory for traditional Bhutanese folk music.http://stringedinstrumentdatabase.aornis.com/ Structure A Nepalese Dranyen The dranyen is a long-necked, double-waisted and fretless lute. It is usually hollowed out of a single piece of wood and can vary in size from 60 cm to 120 cm in length. Unlike a contemporary guitar, the dranyen does not have a round sound hole in the wooden sounding board, but rather rosette-shaped ones like a lute. For 6 string dranyen all six strings continue to the pegbox. They run in 3 double courses. This is a common Tibetan style. 7 string dranyen are a common Bhutanese style. Of this styles's seven strings, or thag, only six continue to the pegbox. Thus, six tuning pegs are located in the pegbox, while one (typically corresponding to the string which is third from the left) is located in the neck itself. Strings were originally made from animal gut, but are presently made from synthetic material like nylon (similar to the progression in usage of guts in racquet sports). The seven strings occur in two double courses, and one triple course. These become three double courses by the time they reach the pegbox. Traditional dranyens are equipped with a single bridge. Resonance is achieved with a taught, thick animal skin. Certain older forms of the dranyen possessed sympathetic strings and under-strings to produce more resonance. Some dranyens come with a plectrum attached to the base for plucking. Plectrums were traditionally made of bone, but are now made of plastic or wood. It is often ornately and colourfully painted or carved with religious symbols and motifs, and its pegbox is often impressively carved into a \\"C\\" shape resembling a chusing, a type of sea monster. Tassels may be hung from the horns of the chusing to give the instrument a more frightening look. Play A Dranyen (centre) in the Horniman Museum, London, UK. The triple (usually middle) course of the dramyin typically contains the half string on the left, which is usually tuned an octave above the middle unison strings. One of the other two courses are typically tuned an octave apart. The courses are normally plucked in unison during playing. Typically a single note is played at a time, making for melodic music and not harmony. Dranyens may also be played to keep time, in a rhythmic fashion. One standard tuning for the Dranyen is: g G c' c c f f. The standard way of plucking a course is down and up. One of the two strings in the course is plucked in a downward motion, and the other in the upward motion. The downward motion is typically louder than the other. Cultural significance Tibetan street-musician Dramyins are often used as accompaniment while narrating stories for providing ambience and keeping time, as shown in the Bhutanese film Travellers and Magicians Dramyins are notably used in the performance of Dramyin Cham - a cham dance of subjugation performed by Drukpa monks during the singing of Dramyin Choeshay - a religious song. These are performed at religious festivals called tsechus - banned in Tibet, but continuing unabated in Bhutan much as they have been for the past four centuries. The Dramyin music in the cham is notable as it is one of the very few instances of stringed instruments in monastic music in Bhutan, or for that matter in Tibetan Buddhism in general. A Dramyin player leads the dance and keeps time for the dancers by plucking the instrument. In many chams, the place of the dramyin is taken by a percussion instrument, usually the cymbals. The Dranyen is generally regarded as a secular instrument, and the performance of a Dranyen Cham or Dranyen Choeshay are one of the few instances when Dranyen is allowed to be played inside a monastery or a Dzong. However, dranyens are often depicted on thongdrels (Tibetan: thankas) and given as offerings to deities. The guardian king of the Eastern direction - Sharchop Gyalpo (identified with Dhritarashtra of Hindu mythology) is associated with a dranyen in religious iconography. The Dranyen's melodious sound is supposed to attract demons, and the role of the carved chusing on the pegbox acts to ward off demons. The Dranyen is associated with a guardian deity in the Dranyen Cham. Popular culture and modern variants Rigsar is a popular music arising in Bhutan. Rigsar music often makes extensive use of the dranyen, although the traditional dranyen is typically modified into the rigsar dranyen by Bhutanese musician Sonam Dorji, for use in such popular music. The rigsar dranyen has 15 strings, two bridges and an extra set of tuning keys.An article about the Rigsar Dranyen in RA Online See also *Music of Bhutan *Music of Tibet *Tibetan Institute of Performing Arts References Category:Necked lutes Category:Buddhist music Category:Bhutanese musical instruments Category:Tibetan musical instruments Category:Himalayan musical instruments ","title":"Dramyin"},{"id":"8888022","text":"Lieutenant Colonel Arthur Plugge, CMG (17 February 18772 July 1934), was an English-born officer who served during World War I with the New Zealand Military Forces. As commanding officer of the Auckland Infantry Battalion of the New Zealand Expeditionary Force, he was among the first New Zealanders to land at Gallipoli on 25 April 1915. Plugge's Plateau Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery is located on the hilltop where he established his headquarters on the day of the Gallipoli landing. Early life Plugge was born in Hull, England on 18 February 1877. Educated at Elmfield College in York, he subsequently attended Leeds University. Emigrating to New Zealand in 1899, he taught science at Kings College in Auckland. He was headmaster at another Auckland school, Dilworth Ulster Institute, from 1909 until 1914. He was actively involved in the Territorial Force, serving with the 3rd Auckland Regiment. Military career Following the outbreak of World War I, Plugge volunteered for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF). A major in the Territorial Force, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and placed in command of the Auckland Infantry Battalion, which was formed from one company each of four territorial regiments and had the first serial number, 12/1, on its roll. He was not particularly popular as a commander, being regarded as an amiable but weak leader, and reportedly favoured the company drawn from his territorial regiment. Lieutenant Colonel Plugge, OC Recreation, standing in the ring at the New Zealand Division boxing championships held in Doulieu, France =Gallipoli= Plugge's battalion arrived in Egypt on 3 December 1914 and from there were the first New Zealand troops to land at ANZAC Cove on 25 April 1915. Upon landing, Plugge positioned his battalion headquarters at the top of a hill just inshore from the Cove. The hill was consequently given the name Plugge's Plateau by the invading troops, and after the war, Plugge's Plateau Commonwealth War Graves Commission Cemetery was established on the hilltop. During the day's action, Plugge was lightly wounded in the wrist by a shell fragment. He was wounded again a few weeks later on 8 May, during the Second Battle of Krithia. Plugge was evacuated to Malta for medical treatment, and here he contracted malaria which necessitated his transfer to England for treatment. After recovering his health, he was returned to his command in Gallipoli, leading his battalion during the evacuation from the peninsula. He was mentioned in despatches and appointed to the Order of St Michael and St George in October 1915, for his services during the Gallipoli campaign. =Western Front= When the New Zealand Division was being formed in Egypt following the conclusion of the Gallipoli Campaign, Plugge was made commander of the 1st Auckland Infantry Battalion, which was part of the 1st New Zealand Infantry Brigade. He went on to lead his battalion during the Battle of the Somme. In December 1916, following a reorganisation of the division, he was removed from his command by the divisional commander, Major General Andrew Russell. This was partly due to dissatisfaction with Plugge's performance, and was also an attempt to address a high desertion rate amongst his battalion. In light of his Gallipoli service, Plugge was not returned to New Zealand. Instead, he was allowed to remain with the division as its sports coordinator. It transpired that this was a role in which he excelled, and he remained in the position until he was discharged from the NZEF on 18 June 1918. Later life On his return to New Zealand, Plugge took up dairy farming at Taupiri, near Huntly. He also maintained an involvement with the School Cadet Corps and the Boy Scouts. He died on 2 July 1934 at the age of 57 and was buried in Taupiri Cemetery with military honours. He was survived by his wife, Millicent, and three children. A son, John, had been killed in a flying accident with the Royal Air Force just two months earlier.

Agur ben Jakeh () was the compiler of a collection of proverbs found in Proverbs 30, which is sometimes known as the Book of Agur or Sayings of Agur. Biblical accounts The initial text of the chapter runs as follows (JPS translation), and bears great similarity to . This translation is not universally accepted as correct; see below. The text (verse 1) seems to say that he was a \\"Massaite,\\" the gentilic termination not being indicated in the traditional writing \\"Ha-Massa.\\"Compare . This place has been identified by some Assyriologists with the land of Mash, a district between Judea and Babylonia, and the traces of nomadic or seminomadic life and thought found in and give some support to the hypothesis. Heinrich Graetz, followed by Bickell and Cheyne, conjectures that the original reading is המשל (\\"Ha-Moshel,\\" = \\"the collector of proverbs\\"). The true explanation is still uncertain.  In rabbinical literature  \\"Agur,\\" and the enigmatical names and words which follow in Proverbs 30:1, are interpreted by the Aggadah as epithets of Solomon, playing upon the words as follows: \\"Agur\\" denotes \\"the compiler; the one who first gathered maxims together.\\" \\"The son of Jakeh\\" denotes \\"the one who spat out,\\" that is, \\"despised\\" (from קוא, \\"to spit\\"), le-Ithiel, \\"the words of God\\" (ot, \\"word\\"; El, \\"God\\"), exclaiming, \\"I can [ukal] transgress the law against marrying many wives without fear of being misled by them.\\" Another exposition is that \\"Agur\\" means \\"the one who is brave in the pursuit of wisdom\\"; \\"the son of Jakeh\\" signifies \\"he who is free from sin\\" (from naki, \\"pure\\"); ha-massa (\\"the burden\\"), \\"he who bore the yoke of God\\"; le-Ithiel, \\"he who understood the signs\\" (ot, \\"sign\\") and deeds of God, or he who understood the alphabet of God, that is the creative \\"letters\\" (ot, \\"letter\\");See Ber. 55a. we-Ukal, \\"the master\\".Tan., Waera, ed. S. Buber, 2, p. 18; Midr. Prov. 30:1; Yalk. on the passage, § 962. Alternate explanations of first verse Scholars, including Perdue, have considered other meanings for \\"le-ithiel\\" and \\"ukhal\\". Observing that \\"it is highly unlikely that the two Hebrew terms refer to personal names\\" (note that the names Agur and Jakeh are not seen anywhere else in the Bible or any other Israelite document), Perdue points out that some better translations for le- ithiel would be \\"I am weary, O God\\"; or: \\"I am not God\\". \\"Ve-ukhal\\" would complement it: \\"How can I prevail/I am exhausted?\\". The highly non-standard Hebrew and the lack of parallel language elsewhere makes it difficult to settle on a particular shade of meaning. Some have speculated that Agur is a \\"foreign sage from the East\\" (Perdue, op cit), who is quoted here only to be later rebuked. Another explanation may be: This is the name of the author of the wise sayings provided in Prov. 30. Either this was a real person, or as some have suggested, it was a fanciful name for Solomon. Proverbs 30 says that he was the son of Jakeh (Hebrew: “Yaqeh”) which means “to obey” or “obedient.” Again, this is either a real person, or another symbolic name for Solomon. Status as Prophet of Christianity Agur's question \\"What is his name or his son's name, if you know it?\\" in Proverbs 30:4 was interpreted by several Christian authors as one of the allusions in Old Testament to the coming of the Christ, the Son of God. This viewpoint is also expressed in John Witherspoon's \\"On the Purity of The Heart,\\". However, Rashi interpreted this verse and the preceding one () as referring to Moses, namely the wisdom of the Torah that Moses knew and understood, and that no prophet had arisen since like Moses.Compare  References  . *Leo G.

This veterinary disease in adult cattle follows an abrupt move from feedlot (dried feed indoors) to 'foggage pasture' (fast growing, lush pasture, with high protein levels). Clinical signs begin within 1 to 14 days and death may follow within 2 to 4 days. The condition can affect up to 50% of the herd, and around 30% of affected cattle may die as a result. This metabolic nutritional-respiratory disturbance has also been reported in other ruminants (red deer) and on a wide variety of grasses, alfalfa, rape, kale, and turnip tops. Clinical signs The bovine experiences difficulty breathing and will do everything it can to ease this discomfort. It will try to stand with its airway as straight and extended as possible, raising its head and stretching its neck forwards. Breathing rate will increase as high as 80 breaths per minute. there may also be extension of the tongue, and drooling. The animal may grunt as it breathes and froth may form around the mouth as the condition progresses. Rectal temperature will be normal, although some may show an elevated temperature from respiratory effort. . Cause 'Fog fever' results from feedlot economics and the biochemistry of the cattle stomach (rumen) being slow to adjust to green grazing. After a low-protein, dried formulation, cattle are less prepared for a sudden, large exposure to high-protein grass. The level of L-tryptophan in crops is most likely to be high in lush, rapidly growing pastures, particularly (but not exclusively) in the fall. The change in diet to vegetation rich in L-tryptophan causes a corresponding increase of the amino acid typically found in protein in the rumen. Lactobacillus bacteria in the rumen degrade L-tryptophan to indoleacetic acid; bacteria in the rumen convert this to 3-methylindole (3MI) (skatole), which is readily absorbed through the rumen wall into the portal circulation. (3-methylindole is produced exclusively from indoleacetic acid and not directly from L-tryptophan.) Club cells in the terminal bronchioles convert the 3-methylindole to 3-methyleneindolenine, which is toxic to the adjacent alveolar epithelial cells. This toxicity leads to emphysema and pulmonary edema which may cause death by asphyxiation. In the history of research into this causative pathway, the roles of L-tryptophan and indoleacetic acid to 3-methylindole were identified as early as 1967 and 1972. Treatment There is little that can be done for affected cattle. To move from the pasture only on the advice of a veterinarian, since stress of movement can be deadly even in less severely affected. Mild cases may recover quickly, but full recovery may require a few weeks. Prevention Ideally pastures should be used before they become overly lush and protein-rich. If this is not possible, the new diet should be introduced slowly by grazing the cattle just a few hours each day and increasing gradually, over a period of a fortnight. Cutting the pasture immediately before putting the cattle out may help. Drugs are available (monensin or lasalocid) which change the rumen biochemistry in preparation for high tryptophan levels, inhibiting the bacteria that convert L-tryptophan to 3-methylindole. Care must be taken to keep these products away from horses, for which, since horses have no rumen, they are toxic.

Their method can be regarded as an extended form of cultural praxis deriving from a general interest in the conservation and presentation of knowledge and culture. It questions the ways cultural economies present themselves, the conditional changes they undergo and to what extent they initiate a potential move. It is questions like: How does the presentation of history and the past shape the image of the present? Which aspects of cultural practices are (deliberately) kept in the shadows of official historiography and why?

Names It is first mentioned under the title \\"Midrash Mishlei\\" by R. Hananeel b. Ḥushiel.As quoted in the Mordechai on Bava Metziah 3:293 Nathan of Rome called it \\"Aggadat Mishlei\\".Arukh, s.v. נקד In addition, it was erroneously called \\"Shocher Tov\\",ed. Zolkiev, 1800; Benjacob, Oẓar ha-Sefarim, p. 302, Nos. 449-451 a name which properly refers to Midrash Tehillim.  Content  This midrash is different from all the other aggadic midrashim, in that its interpretations approach the simple exegesis then in vogue, being brief and free from the prolixity found in the other midrashim, so that this work is in the form of a commentary rather than in that of a midrash. The interpretations follow immediately upon the words of the text, without the introductory formulas found in the other midrashim, \\"as Scripture says,\\" or \\"Rabbi N. N. began\\" (the latter formula, however, occurs at the beginning of the midrash). The editor of the midrash drew upon the Mishnah, Tosefta, Mekhilta, Sifre, Pesikta de-Rav Kahana, Avot de-Rabbi Natan, Bereshit Rabbah, Vayikra Rabbah, Ecclesiastes Rabbah, Canticles Rabbah, and the Babylonian Talmud. But he does not seem to have known anything about the Jerusalem Talmud, since he does not quote from it. The editor was therefore probably a Babylonian Jew, although this cannot be definitely decided. The midrash has not been fully preserved; for there are no comments on several chapters (3, 7, 18), and other chapters have only partial comments. The editor of Yalkut Shimoni used some portions of this midrash which are now missing, although it may be assumed that not all the teachings which he attributed to this midrash were really a part of the Midrash Mishlei which he had at hand.Compare S. Buber, Midrash Mishle, Introduction, p. 5b The exact time of composition cannot be determined. Zunz holdsG. V. p. 268 dates it to the mid-11th century; but this is dubious inasmuch as it is mentioned by name by Hananeel and Nathan, both of whom lived in the early 11th century. Buber thinks that the midrash was compiled as early as the 8th century, since quotations from it are found (though without references to the source) at the end of the Halakot Gedolot and in the Seder R. Amram 12b. Although the midrash contains comparatively few legends, myths, or parables, it has many interesting teachings with no parallel in other midrashim. For instance, the four riddles which the Queen of Sheba propounded to King SolomonBuber, l.c., p. 20b are found in no other extant midrash, but they correspond to the first four of the nineteen riddles mentioned in the manuscript Midrash ha- Ḥefez.Compare S. Schechter in Folk-Lore, 1890, p. 353  Manuscripts and editions  Aside from the manuscripts of Midrash Mishlei mentioned by S. Buber,pp. 14b-15a there is one in the JTS library.p. 5, 1018, fols. 25a-48b This manuscript, which includes only chapters 1-15, corresponds in many passages with the Constantinople edition. In 14:34ed. Buber, p. 39b it has \\"Metatron\\" instead of \\"Michael,\\" as in the printed editions. If this reading is the original one, it would confirm the assumption that the editor was a Babylonian, since the name \\"Metatron\\" occurs only a few times in the sources from Israel, the name \\"Michael\\" being found instead.e.g., Targ. Yer. on Exodus 24:1 has \\"Michael,\\" while Sanhedrin 38b has \\"Metatron\\" The first edition was issued at Constantinople without date; the second, at Venice in 1547. Apart from these two, eight other editions have been issued.Compare Buber, Introduction, p. 16a The latest and best edition in 1900 was that by Buber,Vilna, 1893 with an introduction and notes.

It is a compilation of older interpretations and explanations of Biblical passages, arranged according to the sequence of those portions of the Bible to which they referred.  Contents  The individual elucidations form an organic whole only insofar as they refer to the same Biblical passage. Lengthy citations from ancient works are often abridged or are only partially quoted, the remainder being cited elsewhere. Since the interpretations of the ancient exegetes usually referred to several passages, and since Yalkut Shimoni endeavored to quote all such explanations, repetitions were inevitable, and aggadic sayings relating to two or more sections of the Bible were often duplicated. In many instances, however, only the beginning of such an explanation is given, the reader being referred to the passage in which it is recorded in its entirety.  Order and arrangement  Title page from Yalkut Shimoni on Book of Joshua, facsimile of Salonique edition (1527). The work contains two sections, which are numbered separately: * The first part covers the Pentateuch and contains 963 sections as follows:  §§ 1–162 to Genesis  §§ 163–427 to Exodus  §§ 428–682 to Leviticus  §§ 683–788 to Numbers  §§ 789–963 to Deuteronomy * The second part contains 1,085 sections, covering the Prophets and the Writings:  §§ 1-252 being devoted to the first prophets (Joshua, Samuel, and Kings)  §§ 253–335 to Book of Jeremiah  §§ 336–384 to Book of Ezekiel  §§ 385–514 to Book of Isaiah  §§ 515–595 to the twelve minor prophets  §§ 596–609 to Book of Ruth  §§ 610–890 to Psalms  §§ 891–928 to Book of Job  §§ 929–965 to Book of Proverbs  §§ 966–979 to Ecclesiastes  §§ 980–994 to the Song of Solomon  §§ 995–1043 to Lamentations  §§ 1044–1059 to Book of Esther  §§ 1060–1066 to Book of Daniel  §§ 1067–1071 to Ezra and Nehemiah  §§ 1072–1085 to Book of Chronicles The order of books follows the Talmudic order,Bava Batra 14b except that Esther precedes Daniel, while the reverse order is followed in the Talmud. The division into sections is arbitrary, and the sections are very unequal in length. For example, in the Vilna edition Deuteronomy 818 containing only five lines, while Deuteronomy 938 comprises eighteen columns. Each passage, often in the text itself, indicates the sources from which the explanations are derived. In the Salonica edition they are given at the beginning of each corresponding Biblical passage, although in later editions they were placed in the margin. In many instances, however, the sources are given in an inconvenient place or are entirely eliminated, while some references are even indicated by a later redactor, as, for example, Job 921, where mention of the source (Exodus Rabbah) is a later addition, the original redactor being unacquainted with Exodus Rabbah.Compare A. Epstein, Rabbi Shimeon Ḳara veha-Yalkut Shimoni, in Ha-Ḥoḳer, i. 137  Sources  The sources embrace not only the major portion of halakhic and aggadic literature during the ancient and geonic epochs, but also the aggadic literature as late as the 12th century. The author made use of the older midrashic works, such as Seder 'Olam, Sifra, Sifre, Sifre Zuṭa, Mekilta, the Baraita on the Thirty-two Middot, the Baraita on the Forty-nine Middot, and the Baraita on the Erection of the Tabernacle (\\"Meleket ha-Mishkan\\"), and he availed himself also of the Mishnah, both Talmudim, and Semaḥot, Kallah, and Soferim. He drew from the ethical and historical aggadah, such as Abot de-Rabbi Natan, Tanna debe Eliyahu (Rabbah and Zuṭa), Derek Ereẓ, Masseket Gan Eden, Midrash Wayissa'u, the Chronicle of Moses, and the Midrash on the Death of Moses. The author's chief source, however, was the explanatory midrashim, such as the midrash rabbot on Pentateuch (with the exception of Exodus Rabbah), Pesiḳta, Pesiḳta Rabbati, Yelammedenu, Tanḥuma, Debarim Zuṭa, Midrash Abba Gorion, Esfa, Tadshe, Abkir, Pirḳe Rabbi Eli'ezer, and the midrashim on Samuel, Psalms, Proverbs, and Job. The latter works are often cited simply as \\"Midrash,\\" without any more definite identification. In that portion of Yalkut Shimoni which covers the books of Samuel, Psalms, and Proverbs, the term \\"Midrash\\" designates the midrash on the respective books. The term \\"Midrash\\" is used also to indicate the source of passages which belong to older or more recent works. In these few instances the author was apparently either uncertain of his references or he used an older collection known under the name of \\"Midrash,\\" but did not have access to the original documents. It must also be borne in mind that the redactor failed to use various sources, such as the Midrash on the Ten Commandments and the Midrash on the Death of Aaron, and that he likewise ignored the Targumim and writings relating to esoteric doctrines, with the exception of the Otiyyot de-R. Akiba, to which he alludes in Genesis 1, § 1.  Author and date  The author cannot be determined with certainty. The title-page of the Venice edition ascribes the composition of the work to R. Simeon of Frankfort, \\"the chief of exegetes\\" (\\"rosh ha- darshanim\\"), and this was accepted by David Conforte and Azulai, who called him Simeon Ashkenazi of Frankfort. J.L. RapoportIn Kerem Ḥemed, vii. 7 et seq. maintained that R. Simeon (11th century, the father of R. Joseph Ḳara) was its author, but this assertion is untenable since Yalkut Shimoni includes midrashim of a later date. If Yalkut Shimoni was so old, moreover, it would be difficult to explain why R. Nathan b. Jehiel and Rashi fail to mention it. A. Epstein inclines to agree with Zunz that the author of Yalkut Shimoni flourished in the early part of the 13th century. According to Zunz, the work was written by R. Simeon Ḳara, who lived in southern Germany at that period, and the title \\"ha-Darshan\\" was bestowed upon him probably at a later date. It is certain that a manuscript of Yalkut Shimoni, mentioned by Azariah dei Rossi, existed in 1310;Compare Zunz, G. V. pp. 295–303 but despite this, there is scarcely any allusion to the work during the 14th and 15th centuries. This may be ascribed, however, to the unhappy position of the German Jews and to the repeated persecutions of the period; for peace and prosperity were necessary for the copying of so extensive a work, and the Jews of Germany had neither. After the beginning of the 15th century, on the other hand, the work must have been disseminated in foreign countries, for it was used by Spanish scholars of the latter half of that century, Isaac Abravanel being the first to mention it.Compare A. Epstein, l.c. p. 134  Editions  = Older editions = The editio princeps of Yalkut Shimoni was printed in Salonica in 1521; the part relating to the Prophets and Writings appeared first. The part relating to the Pentateuch appeared between 1526 and 1527, and the entire work was later published in Venice (1566) with certain emendations and deviations from the Salonica edition. All later texts are merely reprints of the Venetian edition, with the exception of one published at Livorno (1650–59), which contained additions and corrections as well as a commentary by R. Abraham Gedaliah. The latest text prior to 1900 (Vilna, 1898) is based on the editions of Lublin, Venice, and Livorno, and contains footnotes giving the sources, a glossary of difficult words, and an index of the chapters and verses of Biblical passages. To this edition is appended a brief commentary by Abraham Abele Gumbiner of Kalisz entitled Zayit Ra'anan. =Current editions= * Yalkut Shimoni: Midrash al Torah, Neviim u-Khetuvim.

It stars Mohanlal and Gavin Packard in the lead roles. The story is set at Kovalam beach in Kerala and Poojappura Central Prison, Trivandrum.The Background score was done by Ilayaraja. The movie was well ahead of its time and has a cult following among movie lovers. Its freshness and finesse in script and wonderful narration is commendable also the performance of all characters and above all, the master craft of P. Padmarajan. Often cited as one of the finest crime thrillers in Malayalam. Plot Jeevan (Mohanlal) is taken to central jail from court. It is the year 1988. In his own words, \\"My name is Jeevan. I feel so depressed to know that I can't see this dew morning and the street lamps for years; but little would benefit in regretting now\\". The story moves back to 1982, at Kovalam, where Jeevan is running a restaurant. He also is involved in sale and purchase of several smuggled foreign goods along with transfer of foreign currency. Popularly and fondly called by everyone as \\"Uncle\\", Jeevan is one of the richest businessman in Kovalam, and has no bad vices. He is a real mystery to all, as he also keeps everyone away from his personal life. Porinju (Ashokan) and Kanthi (Maniyan Pilla Raju), two jobless youths, are involved in small- time drug business to make ends meet. Both have their own families and personal issues and dream of being rich one day. They happen to meet Fabien, a European tourist, who wants them to fetch him three kilos of brown sugar. Both Porinju and Kanthi get lured into this deal. Jeevan supports them by lending 1.5 lakhs, on the condition that they will give up the drug trade after the deal is closed. Both Porinju and Kanthi leave for Goa. They return a week later at night with the stuff. They directly go to the restaurant run by Jeevan and inform him about it. Jeevan warns them to be careful. Fabien is informed about the stuff and asked to arrive at the lighthouse late, in the light. At the lighthouse, Fabien plays foul and shoots down Porinju. Meanwhile, Merlin (Leena Nair), the girlfriend of Fabien breaks into the Jeevan's place and steals around four lakhs rupees along with gold. On getting the information, Jeevan comes to the house, but finds it completely ransacked. Kanthi, who escaped from Fabien reaches Jeevan and informs him about the death of Porinju. He takes Jeevan to the hut where Fabien was staying with Merlin. But Fabien had within the time escaped with the currency and drugs. He had jilted even Merlin. She was assaulted and left back. Jeevan finds her with both hands and legs tied. She informs him that Fabien is already on his way and they won't be able to chase him. She also informs that he is a psychopathic killer. Kanthi takes Jeevan's car and leaves to chase Fabien, but is killed on the way by him. The next day, the police recover the bodies of Porinju and Kanthi. Jeevan is shocked to find that Merlin has also committed suicide by taking sleeping pills. Jeevan is the main suspect as Kanthi's body was found in his car and Merlin was found dead in his house. He is arrested and sentenced to 7 years in prison. But the prosecution couldn't nail for murders of Porinju and Kanthi as there were no proofs. He gets a 5-year jail term for the death of Merlin. It was just weeks before his release that Fabien enters his jail. Jeevan agrees to help Fabien in escaping from jail, if he pays Rs. 5 lakhs. After the release, Jeevan plans everything and is back in jail for a petty crime. His sole aim is to finish off Fabien. The film then cuts to the present. On the day of Gandhijayanthi, when, all the cops are busy with the celebrations, Jeevan escapes from jail with Fabien. On their way, Fabien collects Rs. 5 lakhs from an agent and pays it to Jeevan. After collecting the amount, Jeevan in a fiery fight finishes off Fabien. Jeevan goes back to jail when his voice over comes in background with the visual of him driving the van and images of passing street lights in the plain glass of the van \\"I am getting sad to know that I am going to miss these street lights again. I had great comfort when she (one of his friend's lovers) accepted the money (that Jeevan took from Fabien) and the happy thing for me is that this time is that they won't have any circumstantial evidences against me; but only evidence, the real evidence. Its on my shirt, on my face, on my hands...and everywhere \\". He smiles triumphantly and reaches back at the prison. When the cops ask about Fabien, Jeevan walks with a winning smile and opens the door of the van where the cops find Fabien's corpse.

His son, a young boy was adopted and crowned to the Madurai Throne, with the queen Meenakshi as queen regent, when the Madurai king died without heir. Strife between Bangaru Thirumalai and queen Meenakshi would later erupt into many battles leading to the downfall of the dynasty. Later, through marriage alliances with the Sinhalese royalty, relatives of Bangaru Thirumala came to rule the Kandy kingdom in Sri Lanka. They ruled till 1815 when the last king, Sri Vikrama Rajasinha was deposed and taken captive by the British. He was exiled to Vellore Fort from Kandy. Family origins Bangaru Tirumala was a member of royal family of Madurai Nayaks and a Governor/Commander of the Madurai Country in charge of Madurai and Tirunelveli regions. He is said to be descendant from another branch of the royal family issuing from Kumara Muttu, probably a younger brother of Thirumalai Nayak.History of the Nayaks of Madura, R. Sathianathaier, Sakkottai Krishnaswami Aiyangar; pages 97, 136, 151 and 232 Beginnings  When Vijaya Ranga Chokkanatha Nayak died in 1731 without an heir, one of his queens Meenakshi adopted Bangaru Thirumala’s son Vijayakumara then a young boy as an heir for the Madurai Throne and became Queen Regent for the adopted prince. During this time Tiruchirapalli Fort was the headquarters of Madurai Kingdom, while Madurai was bifurcated into a Province, still retaining the vast Fort. =Queen Meenakshi= When Queen Meenakshi took over the administration, the Kingdom was in deep trouble, with enemy troops of Delhi Sultans, Mysore armies and Maratha armies attempting to seize the throne. Also pilferage of enemy spies and widespread anarchy prevailed in the kingdom. The palace administrators were rampant on treason and corruption. The queen attempting to bring order, sacked many troublesome officials and commanders, and replaced them with better ones. She was also assisted by her brother Venkata Perumal Nayak and things looked better for a period. Madurai throne claimants Hardly a year or two passed when Bangaru Tirumala, feeling that he deserved the throne, instigated an insurrection against the queen. He was also joined by Queen Meenakshi’s recently ousted Minister \\"Dalavay Venkatachari\\". Their first attempt at ousting the queen by attacking the Tiruchirapalli fort ended in a failure. Bangaru Tirumala operated from Madurai Fort while the Queen held court from the Tiruchirapalli Fort Palace. During this period the Madurai Kingdom was a feudatory of the Delhi Sultanate, whose representative in the south was the Nawab of Carnatic. The Nizam of Hyderabad held an intermediate authority. Bangaru Tirumala approached Safdar Ali Khan, son of the Carnatic Nawab, with an offer of three million rupees to oust the queen in favour of him. The latter after accepting the offer, settled the dispute in Bangaru Tirumala’s favour by declaring him as the King. Safdar Ali Khan then left to Arcot without attacking Meenakshi’s fort in Tiruchirapalli and left the matters to his kin and advisor Chanda Sahib to enforce the new events. The wily queen, not paying any attempt at the suspicious settlement, responded by offering Chanda Sahib a crore of rupees (ten million) and to declare her duly entitled to the throne. Startled at the detour of affairs Bangaru Tirumala left to Madurai, to rule over that province and Tirunelveli, without wishing any harm to Chanda Sahib. End of Nayak dynasty Bangaru Tirumala‘s withdrawal was only temporary as he collected a good number of discontents from the army and Polygars again launched offensive attacks on the Tiruchirapalli Fort. Several battles and attacks continued on either sides, with Bangaru Tirumala finally seizing the Dindigul Fort,a key fort and territory in between the Madurai and Tiruchirapalli. Two years passed (1736), when Chanda Sahib returned to Trichrapalli, combining with Meenakshi, attacked Bangaru Tirumala, who was still ruling the southern provinces of Madurai. In a battle at Ammayanayakkanur near Dindigul, Bangaru Thirumala’s army, largely strengthened by some Polygars, fought a well-contested battle against the Queen and Chanda Sahib with over 80,000 soldiers, but was finally defeated, taking refuge in Sivaganga palace. Chanda Sahib, after the victory over Bangaru Tirumala, proclaimed himself ruler of Meenakshi’s kingdom, after locking the queen up in her palace, later driving her to consume poison, thus putting an end to over 200 years of Nayak rule in Madurai. With the Tanjore Marathas Bangaru Tirumala still undaunted joined with the Tanjore Marathas to oust Chanda Sahib. Tanjore Kingdom was recently (1740) attacked and subjugated by Chanda Sahib, compelling them to cede Karaikal to the French, who were Chanda Sahib’s new ally. Also Chanda Sahib was left on his own by his Uncle Carnatic Nawab, but still suspicious over the former's ambitions. Bangaru Tirumala and the Tanjore King joined together and called in assistance of the Marathas of Satara in Bombay. These people having their own grievances against the Carnatic Nawabs (with whom Chanda Sahib was still identified) marched down with a vast army in the south in 1741, first defeating and killing the Nawab of Arcot in the Battle, later after a three months siege at Trichinopoly fort, took Chanda Sahib as a captive, killing both Chanda Sahib’s brothers. Finally in 1751, Chanda Sahib was captured after a series of Carnatic Wars and beheaded by a Tanjore general, Mankoji. Madurai again The Marathas disregarding the claims of Bangaru Tirumala appointed a Maratha Morari Rao of Gooty (in 1741), as their governor of the conquered kingdom. In 1744, the Nizam of Hyderabad sent an army to re-establish his weakened authority in the Carnatic making Morari Rao flee from Madurai. The Nizam appointed Anwar-ud-din as Nawab of Arcot, and ordered Vangaru Tirumala to be appointed to the Throne of Madurai. The rulers of Ramnad, Sivaganga, Tanjore were also keen on appointing Bangaru Tirumala on the throne thereby to retain a Nayak Kingdom. Thus for a brief period Bangaru Thirumala seemed to take the crown as a de jure ruler, while the administrative control was carried out by the Arcot army. Bangaru was also repeatedly warned of attempts by Anwar-ud-din and his aides on plans to usurp the Throne. But very little is known afterwards as some sources point out that he was poisoned by Anwar-ud-din.  Relationship with Kandy Nayaks See also: Nayaks of Kandy One section of Bangaru Thirumala’s family came to rule Kandy through marriage alliances with the Sinhalese royalty. They were the last dynasty to rule Sri Lanka. They are often mentioned as Nayakkar Dynasty or Vaduga Rulers or Nayaks of Kandy. Among the four kings who constituted the Kandy Nayak dynasty only the last three were related to Bangaru Thirumalai. Background: Three kings of the Kandy Mahanuwara kingdom, had married brides from Madurai. These kings were: Rajasinghe II (1635–1687) Vimaladharmasurya II (1687–1707) Vira Narendra Sinha (1707–1739). The royal status of these brides or their relationships to the Nayakas of Mudurai have not been established. The available documents in both Madura and Sri Lanka make it highly doubtful that these brides were of royal descent. In the case of the bride who married Vira Narendra Sinha, it has been established that she was the daughter of a Nayak named Pitti Nayak, who had probably seen better days, but was a very poor man when his daughter married the king of Kandy.The Kandyan Kingdom of Sri Lanka, 1707-1782: Author: Lorna Srimathie Dewaraja, pages 29 -36 The bride was accompanied by her father, mother and brother (who was young a child), and her family continued to reside there. Later in 1732 Narendra Sinha falls critically ill, and being childless, he adopts the brother of his queen who had grown up in the Kandyan court, as son and heir.The history of Sri Lanka, By Patrick Peebles, page 39 When Narendra Sinha died in 1739, this prince ascended the throne as Sri Vijaya Rajasinha. The new king Sri Vijaya Rajasinha, married princess Upendramma, daughter of Narenappa Nayaka, who was the cousin of Bangaru Thirumala (i.e. their mothers were sisters). This queen too is accompanied by her father, mother and 2 young brothers, who all take residence in Kandy. Sri Vijaya Rajasinha too dies childless, and his wife's brother, i.e. Narenappa's son, ascended the throne, under the name Kirti Sri Rajasinha. When he too dies without a child, his brother ascended the throne as Rajadhi Rajasinha. When Rajadi Rajasinha also dies childless, Sri Vikrama Rajasinha of Sri Lanka (1798-1815 AD), ascended the throne. He was queen Upendramma’s nephew. Other descendants Several of Bangaru Thirumala’s descendants lived in the Vellaikurichi Fort in Sivaganga Zamin, and their family living there till recent times. The Vellaikurichi Fort along with some encompassing villages were granted by the Raja of Sivaganga. In the 1820s, a descendant of Bangaru was reported to be in Madurai seeking pecuniary assistance from the government. Also it is reported, every year they conducted a ceremony of reciting poems of their royal forebears of their valour and deeds on the first day of Tamil month of Chittirai.

The NBACC (pronounced EN-back) is the principal U.S. biodefense research institution engaged in laboratory-based threat assessment and bioforensics. NBACC is an important part of the National Interagency Biodefense Campus (NIBC) also located at Fort Detrick for the US Army, National Institutes of Health and the US Department of Agriculture.  Background and mission  The NBACC was created as a federal response to the anthrax letter attacks in 2001 as the first national laboratory operating under the Department of Homeland Security. The Department of Homeland Security said the mission of the NBACC is \\"to provide the scientific basis for the characterization of biological threats and bioforensic analysis to support attribution of their planned or actual use.\\"https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/National%20Biodefense%20Analysis%20and%20Countermeasures%20Center- NBACC-060914_2.pdf Part of the NBACC's mission is to conduct realistic tests of the pathogens and tactics that might be used in a bioterrorism attack. It seeks to quantitatively answer questions pertaining to what might happen in a biological attack. This work is carried out by about 180 researchers and support staff and has become more advanced since the NBACC became certified to work with biological select agents and toxins in September 2011. Its work is necessary in the preparation and response to biological threats, which can be handled as they emerge through the NBACC national security biocontainment laboratory. The NBACC is equipped to develop and investigate genetically engineered viruses and bacteria. The NBACC evaluates new and emerging technologies, along with delivery devices that U.S. adversaries might use to disseminate the pathogens. The NBACC coordinates closely with the many departments and agencies in the U.S. government, including the U.S. intelligence community which has assigned advisers to the Center. The NBACC is involved in a partnership with the National Interagency Confederation for Biological Research at Fort Detrick and initiated the \\"Work for Others\\" program, which expands the NBACC's capacity to share information with a variety of related federal agencies.  Significance of operation  In June 2017, Daniel M. Gerstein, senior policy researcher at the RAND Corporation and former acting Under Secretary and Deputy Under Secretary of the DHS's Science and Technology Directorate, said, \\"In the last 40 to 60 years, hundreds of new diseases have cropped up across the world ... The country and the world have not proven ready to handle a true public health crisis.\\" Describing the NBACC's value to science, Gerstein said, \\"Back in 2001, we did not have this facility, and it literally took months in order to do the forensics analysis of samples ... they had to outsource ... to 12 different facilities to get everything analyzed back then. Today, the NBACC can do those forensic analyses in a couple days.\\" The risk of a bioterrorism attack continues to grow. International terrorist organizations, such as ISIS, have shown growing desire to access and use biological weapons. A 19-page document providing instructions on the creation of biological weapons was discovered on a laptop obtained from ISIS in 2014. Kenyan authorities stopped an ISIS-affiliated anthrax plot in late 2016. In early 2017, South Korea speculated that North Korea was developing biological weapons that could be dispersed through drones. The NBACC and affiliated groups play an important role in protecting the public from these mounting threats. NBACC has already proven capable of responding to these types of threats, as an important actor in the United States response to the Ebola Outbreak of 2014. During the crisis, NBACC scientists carried out experiments to test the duration of the virus' activity when placed on different surfaces, and best practices for sanitation after completing tests.  Threats to continued work  Under President Trump's budget proposal for fiscal year 2018, the NBACC stands to lose funding that allows it to continue scientific studies. The NBACC is faced with the threat of complete shutdown of its facilities by September 2018. Daniel M. Gerstein said the result of the closure of the NBACC would be a \\"potentially devastating public health concern.\\" The cost of replacing the services provided by the NBACC will be more expensive than continuing its operations simply due to the nature of changing the role of the NBACC's facilities, according to Homeland Preparedness News. Congressman John Delaney (D-MD), who represents the Maryland congressional district in which the NBACC resides, said in a statement from May 2017: > I am 100 percent opposed to the closing of the National Biodefense Analysis > and Countermeasures Center in Frederick and will fight this deeply misguided > move by the Trump Administration ... The National Biodefense Analysis and > Countermeasures Center is a unique facility that is crucial to our homeland > security, intelligence, and anti-terrorism endeavors. This is the lab that > protects us against anthrax attacks, ricin attacks and other bioterrorism > threats. In May 2017, several faculty at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said the loss of the NBACC would make the impact of a bioterror attack \\"far more dire.\\" They said, \\"In the first moments after the attack is identified, we'd want to know the identity of the pathogen used in the attack, whether it could spread from person to person and what drugs and vaccines would work to treat and protect people. But with ... complete elimination [of the NBACC] ... the delay before these and other facts are known would increase, costing many lives.\\" In September 2015, the Battelle National Biodefense Institute (which operates the NBACC) was awarded a 10-year contract for operations and management. At the time, Battelle said the contract would be worth $480 million if fully executed. The proposed Trump budget for 2018, though, would see this award retracted, leading to the end of all scientific operations by March 2018. Facilities NBACC laboratories operate at the biosafety levels of 2, 3, and 4, providing the optimal level of safety and operational capacity. In particular, the NBACC's biosafety level of 4 allows its facilities to research pathogens that have no existing vaccines or treatment. This makes it one of only seven locations in the United States where this occurs. In June 2006, construction began on a new $128 million, facility inside the Ft. Detrick installation. Space inside the 8-story, glass-and-brick structure opened in 2008 and is divided between NBACC's two centers: * The National Biological Threat Characterization Center (NBTCC), which seeks to identify and prioritize biological threats and our vulnerabilities to those threats through its laboratory threat assessments. It includes biocontainment suites, including air-handling equipment, security controls, and other supporting features. It is classified as a SCIF, or Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility, meaning that while the majority of research that occurs at the lab is unclassified, some research results must remain classified for security purposes. * The National Bioforensic Analysis Center (NBFAC), a forensic testing center equipped to identify and characterize the possible culprit pathogens after an attack has already occurred.  Notable accomplishments  The NBACC achieved a \\"Superior\\" Defense Security Service (DSS) rating in 2012 and 2013 and was recognized for staff volunteerism. It has played a role in over 100 federal law enforcement cases. The NBTCC has unique national biosafety level 3 and 4 aerobiology capabilities, which are necessary to collect crucial data that is used to develop biodefense plans and responses. In 2013, it provided necessary data, which addressed 10 specific biological agent knowledge gaps, to improve hazard, risk, and threat assessments. The data allowed for significant growth in the credibility of hazard and risk assessment modeling of bioterrorism scenarios for a variety of toxin threat agents, including both bacteria and viruses. The NBFAC played a role in more than 45 federal law enforcement investigations of biological crimes in 2013 alone. Also in 2013, it activated unique bioforensic laboratories at biosafety level 3 with accreditation for casework operations. Its processes maintain operational capability to study more than 60 high- priority human, animal, and plant pathogens and toxins. Its sequencing methods are imperative to enable new kinds of studies. It played a central role in developing capabilities to investigate genetically modified and de novo synthetic agents (new complex molecules formed from simple molecules). In January 2018, the Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity selected Battelle to create a software platform able to fight the development of synthetic biological threats. Battelle said it would develop the threat assessment platform with collaboration from Ginkgo Bioworks, One Codex and Twist Bioscience. The intended final result is a program that can \\"merge computational approaches into a software tool that can be applied in real- world scenarios.\\" Controversy and response Questions have been raised by some arms-control and international law experts as to the necessity and advisability of the very high level of security surrounding the NBACC and as to whether it does (or will) place the United States in violation of the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BWC). (The BWC outlawed developing, stockpiling, acquiring or retaining pathogens \\"of types and in quantities that have no justification\\" for peaceful purposes.) NBACC's opponents contended that the facility would operate in a \\"legal gray zone\\" and skirt the edges of the BWC, which outlaws production of even small amounts of biological weapons. They contend that a high degree of transparency is needed to reassure Americans (and the rest of the world) of the U.S. government's good intentions. In their view, the U.S. government may find it hard in the future to object to other countries testing genetically engineered pathogens and novel delivery systems when they invoke their own national biodefense requirements. The Bush administration contended that the NBACC is purely defensive and thus its operations are fully legal and in accord with the BWC. A principle is that assessing the technical threat of biological pathogens is essential to inform and help develop biodefense policy. Administration officials say that making small amounts of biowarfare pathogens for study is permitted under a broad interpretation of the treaty. Faculty at the NBACC provided their own responses to help answer questions raised by critics. In May 2008, director Patrick Finch said that research at the laboratory is not conducted to \\"create threats in order to study them.\\" Maureen McCarthy, former Homeland Security director of research and development, said, \\"All the programs we do are defensive in nature. Our job is to ensure that the civilian population of the country is protected, and that we know what the threats are.\\" Bernard Courtney, the NBACC's former scientific director, described oversight, mentioning that frequent independent reviews over particular experiments occur. These reviews are operated by a group of up to four scientists on a case-by-case scenario. Additionally, research at the labs is overseen by the Institutional Biosafety Committee. The CDC also conducts inspections to assure labs comply with Select Agents rules. The Final Environmental Impact Statement, or FEIS, for NBACC facilities states that all research is performed for defense purposes and is conducted in a legal manner, including under the BWC.

Both of these novels deal with the situation in contemporary Algeria. He is also the director of the new review Algérie Littérature/Action.Aïssa KHELLADI Africultures.com  Life  Aïssa Khelladi was born in Algeria in 1953, right before the beginning of the Algerian war for Independence fought between the Algerian National Liberation Front (F.L.N.) and the French government. He began attending Koranic school at a young age before attending primary and secondary school in Algiers before dropping out to support his family once his schooling was no longer mandatory. He then took a baccalaureate exam before continuing his education at the University of Algiers, earning a BA and a DEA (Diplôme d'études approfondies, which is equivalent to a master's degree)) in psychology after receiving a grant from the Algerian Ministry of Defense. After earning his degree, he wrote two books between 1981 and 1984, “Attende et Journal” and a collection of short stories. In 1988, he was discharged from the army after attaining the rank of captain and shifted his focused solely to his writing. This devotion to journalism and literature lead him to aid in the creation and launch of Hebdo News in 1990. His writing for that paper culminated in a condemnation of the Islamic Salvation Front (F.I.S.) by another newspaper, Ennour. Shortly afterward, Khelladi published an essay titled “Les Islamistes Algeriens Face Au Pouvoir” (“Algerian Islamists in the face of Power”), digging into the religious agendas of the F.L.N. and F.I.S. Subsequently, “Les Islamistes Algeriens Face Au Pouvoir” was banned by the Algerian government and Khelladi fled the country after a failed assassination attempt. He was granted political asylum in France, where he continued his career. While in France, he published another novel, titled “Peurs et Mensonges” (“Fears and Lies”) in 1996. In the same year, Khelladi founded the magazine Algérie Littérature/Action alongside Marie Virolle. While still in France, he published two novels in 1998, “Rose d’Abime” and “Spolaition”. He has since returned to Algeria to focus on publishing and is currently working on another novel.  Literary/Journalism Work  = Les Islamistes Algeriens Face Au Pouvoir = This novel focuses on the F.I.S. and F.L.N. and the effect their Islam agenda had on the country of Algeria. Khelladi's claim in “Les Islamistes Algeriens face au pouvoir” is that the F.L.N. was consumed by a religious agenda that pushed its incompetent leaders to make up for their failures by forcing Islam on the people of Algeria. He concedes that while the F. I. S. did not have a concrete plan, they still were able to spread their ideology throughout the people of Algeria. = Peurs et Mensonages = Peurs et Mensonages is a fictional novel that follows a journalist by the name of Amine Touati as he grips the conflict of violence and counter-violence in his country and well as the very ideologies that form the foundations for his work and the actions, he sees every day. The novel takes place in prison, where Touati is tasked with confessing and will thus be rewarded with exile. = Algérie Littérature/ Action = After fleeing from the Algerian government in 1994, Khelladi became a political refugee in France, where he continued in literary and journalistic career. This led him to, in 1996, start Algérie Littérature/Action alongside Marie Virolle in her apartment with two thousand francs (~US$300). Then began by publishing articles by close friends and themselves, including Khelladi's “Peurs et Mensonges”. Overtime, they gained recognition and respect from writers and the mainstream audience and began received more high-quality submissions to consider for publication. Once they had “proven themselves” they received financial backing from Centre National du Livre (CNL) and the Fond's d’Action (FAS) as well as more mainstream media attention from radio shows, television and newspaper. AL/A was published in a single volume at a time, usually 200-300 pages long that featured a novel followed by cultural publications such as biographies, literary criticisms and short stories. This structure was adapted primarily for publishing reasons, as it had to be considered a periodical in order for Virolle and Khelladi to start publishing with so little money. However, they also wanted this structure in order to not prioritize one type of writing over the other, opting to create an anthology of multiple types of Algerian literature. The publishing house behind AL/A, Marsa Publishing, is now located in both Paris and Algeria, with the publishing centralized in Paris but most of the works coming from Algeria and other places around the globe.

From issues #67–93, cover dated December 1970 to April 1975, the X-Men series consisted of reprints due to lack of sales. In May 1975, Giant-Size X-Men #1 was published, in which Professor X recruits a new international team to save the X-Men. With issue #94, the magazine was revived, and all of the original X-Men quit, save team leader Cyclops, and are replaced by such \\"All-New, All- Different\\" X-Men as Storm, Wolverine, Nightcrawler, and Colossus. A former X-Men adversary, Banshee, also joins the team at this point. Sunfire returns to Japan in this issue, and Thunderbird dies in issue #95. Publication history Uncanny X-Men #94 is the beginning of writer Chris Claremont's 16-year run on the title. Under his guidance, Uncanny X-Men would become the industry's top title, and, along with Spider-Man, the driving force behind Marvel Comics for the next 20 years. Uncanny X-Men #94 was reprinted in Essential X-Men Volume 1 along with Giant-Size X-Men #1 and issues #95–119. It was also reprinted in Marvel Masterworks Uncanny X-Men Volume 1 along with Giant Size X-Men #1 and issues #95–100. In 2006, Giant Size X-Men #4 reprinted issue #94 along with other Thunderbird related issues and a new Thunderbird story by Chris Claremont. In 2004, Marvel released a CD containing issue #94 called SNAP! X-Men. Issue #94 was also reprinted in Classic X-Men #2 (1986), Marvel Masterworks #11, and Essential X-Men #1 (1996). Plot Professor Xavier calls a meeting of the X-Men. There, Sunfire clarifies that he only agreed to help Xavier save the X-Men and has no intention of becoming a member. Banshee also proposes to go on his way, but Professor X and Cyclops convince him to stay. Angel breaks the news that he, Marvel Girl, Iceman, Havok, and Lorna Dane are confident enough in their powers to leave the X-Men. Cyclops wants to leave with Marvel Girl, but realizes with his destructive power he has no chance at living a normal life. The next day, Cyclops leads the new X-Men to the Danger Room for their first training session. Over weeks of training, the new recruits learn to work as a team, but Cyclops's harsh remonstrances at any failings cause tension. In the Colorado Rockies, Count Nefaria and the original Ani-Men seize control of the military base in Mount Valhalla and threaten to launch the USA's entire inventory of nuclear missiles unless every nation of the world pays Nefaria a ransom. The United States Air Force contacts the Avengers for help. Unable to oblige, the Avengers pass the mission on to the X-Men. The X-Men pile into the Blackbird and head to Valhalla. There General Fredericks informs them that Nefaria has ignorantly armed the Doomsmith System, which controls Valhalla's nuclear missiles and can only be shut down within a certain window, which closes in 52 minutes. As the Blackbird enters Valhalla's defense perimeter, Count Nefaria disables it with the defense systems, sending the X-Men into a fatal fall.

Applications include the retention of paper on plotter surfaces, astrictive robotic prehension (electrostatic grippers) etc. Clamping pressures in the range of 0.5 to 1.5 N/cm2 (0.8 to 2.3 psi) have been claimed. An electroadhesive pad consists of conductive electrodes placed upon a polymer substrate. When alternate positive and negative charges are induced on adjacent electrodes, the resulting electric field sets up opposite charges on the surface that the pad touches, and thus causes electrostatic adhesion between the electrodes and the induced charges in the touched surface material. Electroadhesion can be loosely divided into two basic forms: that which concerns the prehension of electrically conducting materials where the general laws of capacitance hold (D = E ε) and that used with electrically insulating subjects where the more advanced theory of electrostatics (D = E ε + P) applies.

It is responsible for advocating at national and international levels for members, developing public policy positions, and providing services to members. The Institute has over 8,000 members from across Canadian, and serves as a national umbrella for the eleven Provincial and Territorial Institutes and Associations (PTIA). Founded in 1919, its primary aim of the CIP is to be \\"the leading and globally respected voice of Canadian professional planning [and] to advance and raise the profile of Canadian professional planning, for our members in Canada and abroad, through leadership, advocacy, expertise, and education\\". The Institute plays an active role in defining the planning profession and working towards more sustainable communities. Presently, the Institute defines planning as: \\"the scientific, aesthetic, and orderly disposition of land, resources, facilities and services with a view to securing the physical, economic and social efficiency, health and well-being of urban and rural communities\\". This definitions provides a national focus and unity for the profession, while clearly illustrating the need for planners to work towards sustainability in urban and regional developments. As the national body for planning, the Institute also provides codes of conduct and practice for planners, as well as numerous resources on current trends in planning and allied professions.  Membership  = Categories of Membership =  Professional Membership  Planners who have been certified by a Provincial / Territorial body governing planning as a Registered Professional Planner, Licensed Professional Planner, Urbanistes, or equivalent are eligible for this category. Planners who live outside of Canada, or have been licensed by a reciprocal organization are eligible for an international version of this class. Professional members are the only class entitled to use the professional designation MCIP (Member of the Canadian Institute of Planners). This designation is a registered trademark, only available to professional planners in good standing.  Candidate Membership  Individuals who are in the process of pursuing full membership, usually possessing an eligible degree from the Professional Standards Board, but completing work experience requirements or exams. International classes for students completing certification with reciprocal bodies or residing outside of Canada are also available.  Student Membership  Those in post-secondary educational institutions are able to join the CIP as student members, but only students in recognized planning programs are eligible to be voting members.  Public Membership  Members of the public, planners who are no longer practicing are eligible for non-voting membership. = Benefits = The primary benefit to full / professional members is the use of the MCIP designation and seal. The designation demonstrates to clients, the public, and employers that a planner meets all professional standards and is part of a profession. Professional and Candidate members are also automatically enrolled in a professional liability insurance program. A large part of the work CIP does is advocating for the planning profession and the value of planning. The Institute lobbies the federal government and other stakeholders to influence public policy. To educate members and the public CIP regularly hosts events like World Town Planning Day seminars, and its annual national conference. It also regularly hosts online and in person workshops and training seminars on current issues in planning. To encourage student involvement in planning, the Institute offers numerous scholarships and bursaries to those enrolled in planning programs though a separately incorporated planning student trust fund. Nine awards are disbursed annually, totaling over $30,000 in support to students. Other member services and benefits include: *a quarterly magazine entitled 'Plan Canada' *free subscription to the 'Zoning Trilogy' *discounts on home and life insurance. *'Perkopolis' discounts and services *annual awards for planning excellence *annual national conference *online information and services. = Reciprocity = The Canadian Institute of Planners maintains reciprocal agreements with the American Planning Association and the Planning Institute of Australia. These official agreements means planners with certification in one jurisdiction can easily transfer their certification to another, and begin practicing there.  Provincial and Territorial Institutes and Associations  The Institute represents planning solely at the national level, and works closely with the independent Provincial and Territorial Institutes and Associations (PTIA). Regulation of the profession and certification of members are the purview of PTIAs, as the Canadian Constitution places the regulation of professions within provincial control.Brophey, B., & Lanktree, C.

Earl Zindars, in an interview conducted by Win Hinkle, stated that \\"Blue in Green\\" was indeed \\"100-percent Bill's.\\"See page 20 of the Fall 1993 issue of Letter from Evans, where Zindars states that the composition was entirely Evan's handiwork: \\"I know that [one] is because he wrote it over at my pad where I was staying in East Harlem, 5th floor walkup, and he stayed until 3 o'clock in the morning playing these six bars over and over.\\" In a radio interview broadcast on May 27, 1979, Evans himself said that he had written the song. On being asked about the issue by interviewer Marian McPartland, he said: \\"The truth is I did [write the music]... I don't want to make a federal case out of it, the music exists, and Miles is getting the royalties....\\"\\"Bill Evans On Piano Jazz\\" (NPR) at 35m30s. Recorded November 6, 1978; originally broadcast May 27, 1979. Evans alleged that when he suggested that he was entitled to a share of the royalties, Davis wrote him a check for $25.Peter Pettinger, How My Heart Sings, Yale University Press (1983), pp. 82–82. In a recording made in December 1958 or January 1959 for Chet Baker's album Chet (prior to the Kind of Blue sessions), Evans' introduction on the jazz standard \\"Alone Together\\" has been directly compared to his playing on \\"Blue in Green\\".\\"Chet (20 Bit Mastering)\\" at Amazon.

It was created by Art Canfil and the company Mega Micro Computers, and published by Avalanche Productions. The game Taipan! was inspired by the novel Tai-Pan by James Clavell. The player is in the role of a trader in the Far East. The goal of the game is for the player to accumulate wealth through trade and possibly also through booty won in battles against pirates. As soon as the player's net worth reaches one million pounds, the player has the option to retire. A companion book about the game was co- authored by Canfil and illustrated by Chrisann Brennan.  Gameplay  The player begins the game with a ship. At the beginning, they have the option to either start without any cash but five guns, or with some cash and a debt. The basic strategy of the game is to buy goods (opium, silk, arms, and general cargo) at a low price and sell them at a higher price. Silk, arms, and general cargo have no special features; opium is special in that it can be confiscated at random points by the local authorities, resulting in a fine for the player. This makes dealing in opium riskier than dealing in the other goods; however, it is also generally the most profitable item for trade. At various times when arriving at a port, a message will pop up indicating a special price has occurred for one of the commodities. In this case, either the commodity's price falls or rises significantly. The player may trade at any of seven historically named ports: Hong Kong, Shanghai, Nagasaki, Saigon, Manila, Singapore, and Batavia. The port at Hong Kong is the player's home port. Here the player has access to ship repair, a money lender, and a bank. Often in Hong Kong, the local extortionist Li Yuen asks if the player would like to \\"donate\\" money to the Sea Goddess. If the player refuses to donate, Li Yuen eventually sends a fleet of hostile ships after the player (which are much more difficult to fight than ordinary pirates). On the other hand, if one chooses to pay Li Yuen, he will occasionally drive off hostile ships for you. The money he asks depends on the amount of cash the player carries. It is not advisable to carry too much excessive cash; the donations asked from Li Yuen, the fines for dealing with opium and the amount stolen from oneself after occasionally getting \\"beaten up and robbed\\" always depend on how much you have. Money may be transferred into your bank account for some interest. The player also has the option of borrowing money from Elder Brother Wu, the moneylender, although this amount is limited to twice the amount the player already has on hand (if the player has zero, they cannot borrow anything). Goods may be stored in the warehouse in Hong Kong, while waiting for prices to rise. However, purchases left in the warehouse may be stolen if left too long. Rates of theft are higher with higher-end commodities such as opium or silk. Note: A bug in the original game allows the player to overpay the moneylender, acquiring \\"negative debt\\". This \\"negative debt\\" will accumulate interest very quickly, and will count towards the player's net worth. As the game's vocabulary of number words ends at \\"trillion\\", this can cause the game to display garbage instead of the player's correct net worth. This has been fixed in the online \\"for browsers\\" version of the game. Runner's Gambit: When attacked by ships an effective escape strategy is to do nothing and wait until the crew asks, \\"Taipan, what shall we do??\\" and then immediately pressing 'R' for run. This strategy which usually results in a quick escape may only work on the Apple II version. Throughout the game, the player is sometimes offered the opportunity to purchase ship upgrades. When this happens, the player can trade their old ship for a larger one with fifty extra units of cargo space by paying some money. Guns are also occasionally offered to the player for varying prices, when arriving in a harbor. More guns mean more firepower (and subsequently also larger fleets attacking), but also require 10 units of valuable cargo-space in the hold. When being attacked by hostile ships, the player may decide to either \\"run\\" or \\"fight\\". Dropping cargo overboard increases the chance of escaping if the player decides to run. In order to fight, the ship must be equipped with guns. When hit by enemy fire, the ship gets damaged, and occasionally a gun is lost. If the ship's condition reaches zero percent, it will sink, and the game ends. But if the player succeeds in sinking all hostile ships, they earn some booty (cash). Reception J. Mishcon reviewed Taipan in The Space Gamer No. 32. Mishcon commented that \\"This game is so much fun that I must recommend it [...] It will be a constant delight for older children.\\" References External links *Taipan! for web browsers *C64 port Category:1982 video games Category:Apple II games Category:North America-exclusive video games Category:Trade simulation games Category:TRS-80 games Category:Turn-based strategy video games Category:Video games based on novels Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set in Asia Category:Video games set in the 19th century ","title":"Taipan!"},{"id":"8888596","text":"Trondheim Tramway Museum (Sporveismuseet i Trondheim) is a tram museum located in Trondheim, Norway.

He was known as the \\"Gentleman Highwayman\\" as a result of his courteous behaviour during his robberies. He famously robbed Horace Walpole, and was eventually hanged at Tyburn. The film Plunkett & Macleane was based loosely on his exploits. The reward of cruelty (Plate IV)-MacLaine skeleton is at upper right Maclaine was the second of two sons of an Irish Presbyterian minister Rev. Thomas Maclaine of 1st Monaghan Presbyterian Church in Ireland. The elder son also became a minister. Educated to become a merchant, Maclaine frittered away his inheritance in Dublin on fine clothes, gambling and prostitutes. He moved to London and married the daughter of an innkeeper or horse dealer. With the dowry of five hundred pounds, he set himself up as a grocer in Welbeck Street. His wife died within 3 years, and he ruined his business in adopting the airs of a gentleman to attract a new wealthy wife. At that time the son of a clergyman would have all the true airs of a gentleman, though perhaps not the funds. He joined bankrupt apothecary William Plunkett as a highwayman. Plunket and Maclaine were responsible for around 20 highway robberies in six months, often in the then-relatively untamed Hyde Park. Amongst their victims were Horace Walpole and Lord Elgington. The thieves were always restrained and courteous, earning Maclaine the sobriquet \\"gentleman highwayman\\". The proceeds enabled him to live the high life. According to the Derby Mercury of 21 September 1750 Maclean was held in the Gatehouse, Westminster for robbing Josiah Higden of a Portmanteau containing divers wearing apparel on the Salisbury Stagecoach route. After one robbery, the information on the stolen items was circulated and led to Maclaine's arrest — he stripped the lace from a waistcoat taken in the robbery and attempted to sell it to a pawnbroker in Monmouth Street, who by chance took it to the same man who had just sold the lace and recognised it. Rather than returning home to fetch the money to pay for the lace, the man alerted a constable and Maclaine was arrested. When his premises were searched, many of the other things the men had stolen, including Lord Eglington's blunderbuss and coat, were uncovered. Walpole writes: Such accounts were fictionalised in books written soon after the trial and later versions are based on these books rather than on the facts of the charges as stated by the Derby Mercury, written four weeks before Maclaine's execution. Maclaine's trial at the Old Bailey became a fashionable society occasion, and he reputedly received nearly 3,000 guests while imprisoned at Newgate. He was convicted and hanged at Tyburn on 3 October 1750. His brother, Archibald, a minister of religion and a translator, travelled from the Hague to intercede with the court for mercy for his brother. After Maclaine was hanged, he earned a mention in the poem The Modern Fine Lady by Soame Jenyns: as an aside after the line \\"She weeps if but a handsome thief is hung\\" the following note was added: \\"Some of the brightest eyes were at this time in tears for one McLean, condemned for robbery on the highway.\\" These lines quietly and eloquently speak of an England subdued by its justice system. Maclean paid with his life. Plunket escaped with his money and his life. An early Cheap Repository Tract describing the execution of James MacLaine Representations in popular culture Maclaine was once thought to be the original model for Macheath the Knife, antihero of John Gay's The Beggar's Opera, but as that was written in 1728, when Maclaine was only four, this cannot be sustained: the preferred claimant for this distinction is Jack Sheppard. But Maclaine's execution was the subject of an early Cheap Repository Tract in 1795, which went through several editions. A modern, although fictionalised, portrayal of his life appears in the 1999 film Plunkett & Macleane, where he was played by Jonny Lee Miller. His skeleton appears in the final plate of William Hogarth's The Four Stages of Cruelty.

The property is listed on both the National Register of Historic Places and the Virginia Landmarks Register. History =Site history= In 1714 Charles Fleming took on a land patent of 670 acres (2.7 km2) with an intent to cultivate it. The land, however, \\"lapsed,\\" and was later granted to Thomas Randolph in 1722. This area was later included in a tract made up of 2870 acres (11.6 km2), which later came to be known as \\"Clifton.\\" But it was this initial purchase of the 670 acres (2.7 km2) that would form \\"The Fork,\\" known for its position on the James and Willis Rivers. It would later become Ampthill. In 1724, Randolph sold to Robert \\"King\\" Carter, then the wealthiest landowner in Virginia. In his will dated 22 August 1726, King Carter willed the 2870 acre (11.6 km2) tract to his then unborn grandson, with the stipulation that the child carry the Carter name. Some time later, Anne Carter and Major Benjamin Harrison of Berkley Plantation, christened a son, Carter Henry, who later become the owner of the property known as \\"Clifton,\\" in Cumberland County, Virginia. Carter Henry Harrison moved to Clifton upon graduation from law school. There he raised his family and wrote the Cumberland Resolutions, which were presented to the community from the steps of the Effingham Tavern. These resolutions were later incorporated into the Virginia Resolutions, which were the basis for the Declaration of Independence, written by Harrison's nephew, Thomas Jefferson. =Ampthill= Carter Henry Harrison died in 1793. In his will, Carter Henry willed Clifton to his son, Randolph, and The Fork to his son Robert. Robert sold The Fork to Shadrack Vaughan in 1804. Randolph later repurchased the property in 1815. The Fork was a clapboard structure of no more than three bedrooms. In 1815, the decision was made to add an addition to the existing manor. Randolph called upon his cousin, Thomas Jefferson, to design the brick addition that exists today. These plans exist today on file with the University of Virginia. The addition began its first phases of construction in 1835 and was completed in 1837. The two \\"houses\\" were separate for a number of years until a one-story passageway was built to connect the two. After the construction of the brick addition was completed the structure was renamed Ampthill. and Accompanying photo It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. Hard times and poor planning saw Ampthill pass from family member to family member over the years, finally falling out of the family's hands in 1923. Ampthill was then purchased by J. Rodgers and I. M. Baker, but as they were unable to meet the financial obligations of their mortgage, the land was then purchased by Frank Baber in 1933. This sale was never officially recorded, so Inez M. Baker, William Abernathy Baker and Irving Marshall Baker purchased the home from the Federal Land Bank in Baltimore and Frank and Mary Tyler Baber in 1936. The house was then sold to Dorothy Des Leal Neville and John Neville, who defaulted. Ampthill and the existing land was then auctioned and purchased by Thomas G. Hardy and Andrew E. Godsey in 1952. In November of that year, the Rea family purchased the home from the Hardys and the Godseys. The Rea family lived at Ampthill for a number of years and sold the home in 1986 to the Saunders family, who were descended from the Harrison line that originally lived at Ampthill. The Saunders later moved from the property and in 1998, the property was purchased by George Costen of Charlottesville. Beginning in 1999 and for a number of years that followed, Ampthill went under a major historic restoration, which included a near reconstruction of one of the outbuildings, which served as a garage for the Rea family for a number of years. Ampthill was a bed and breakfast and enjoys the prestige of being the only privately owned Jeffersonian property in Virginia. Her windows are the original glass. Ampthill exists today on of the original 2870 acres (11.6 km2), is the home to 40 head of cattle and includes the manor house, four outbuildings and the barn, which dates to 1920, by far the youngest standing structure on the property.

Whiteface is on the eastern border of the Sandwich Range Wilderness. To the east, between Whiteface, Passaconaway, and Mt. Wonalancet, lies The Bowl natural area, an unlogged cirque. Mt. Whiteface lies within the watershed of the Saco River, which reaches the Gulf of Maine at Saco, Maine. The south side of Whiteface is drained by the Whiteface River, thence into the Cold River, Bearcamp River, Ossipee River, and the Saco River. The east side is drained by the Wonalancet River, thence into Swift River, and Bearcamp River. The north side is drained by Downes Brook, thence into another Swift River, and the Saco River. The summit of Mt. Whiteface is in a wooded area along the Rollins Trail, approximately north of the top of the massive granite cliff for which the mountain is named. Many hikers reach the open area at the top of the cliff and do not realize the true summit is farther to the north. The summit is popular among winter climbers, favoring the Blueberry Ledge trail for ascent.  History  In the 1850s, the first official trail to the summit is built, the McCrillis trail. In 1871, the US Coast Survey erected a signal station on the summit. In 1875, the poet Lucy Larcom visited the summit, and wrote a sonnet about it. In 1895, Thomas S. Wiggin cuts the Wiggin trail to the summit, branching from Dicey's Mill Trail. In 1899, Gordon H. Taylor blazes the Blueberry Ledge Trail, useful for snowshoeing. In 1914, The Bowl is added to the WMNF. In 1931, The bowl is designated as a Research Natural Area. In 1984, Congress creates the Sandwich Range Wilderness, including Mount Whiteface.

The history of tuberous sclerosis (TSC) research spans less than 200 years. TSC is a rare, multi- system genetic disease that can cause benign tumours to grow on the brain or other vital organs such as the kidneys, heart, eyes, lungs, and skin. A combination of symptoms may include seizures, developmental delay, behavioural problems and skin abnormalities, as well as lung and kidney disease. TSC is caused by mutations on either of two genes, TSC1 and TSC2, which encode for the proteins hamartin and tuberin respectively. These proteins act as tumour growth suppressors and regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. Originally regarded as a rare pathological curiosity, it is now an important focus of research into tumour formation and suppression. The history of TSC research is commonly divided into four periods.Rott (2005), page 2 - Introduction. In the late 19th century, notable physicians working in European teaching hospitals first described the cortical and dermatological manifestations; these early researchers have been awarded with eponyms such as \\"Bourneville's disease\\" and \\"Pringle's adenoma sebaceum\\". At the start of the 20th century, these symptoms were recognised as belonging to a single medical condition. Further organ involvement was discovered, along with a realisation that the condition was highly variable in its severity. The late 20th century saw great improvements in cranial imaging techniques and the discovery of the two genes. Finally, the start of the 21st century saw the beginning of a molecular understanding of the illness, along with possible non-surgical therapeutic treatments. 19th century Rayer's végétations vasculaires. ;1835: French dermatologist Pierre François Olive Rayer published an atlas of skin diseases. It contains 22 large coloured plates with 400 figures presented in a systematic order. On page 20, fig. 1 is a drawing that is regarded as the earliest description of tuberous sclerosis.Curatolo (2003), chapter: \\"Historical Background\\". Entitled \\"végétations vasculaires\\", Rayer noted these were \\"small vascular, of papulous appearance, widespread growths distributed on the nose and around the mouth\\". No mention was made of any medical condition associated with the skin disorder. ;1850: English dermatologists Thomas Addison and William Gull described, in Guy's Hospital Reports, the case of a four-year-old girl with a \\"peculiar eruption extending across the nose and slightly affecting both cheeks\\", which they called \\"vitiligoidea tuberosa\\". ;1862: German physician Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen, who was working as an assistant to Rudolf Virchow in the Institute for Pathological Anatomy in Berlin, presented a case to the city's Obstetrical Society.(As cited in Curatolo (2003)) The heart of an infant who \\"died after taking a few breaths\\" had several tumours. He called these tumours \\"myomata\\", one of which was the \\"size of a pigeon's egg\\". He also noted the brain had \\"a great number of scleroses\\". These were almost certainly the cardiac rhabdomyomas and cortical tubers of tuberous sclerosis. He failed to recognise a distinct disease, regarding it as a pathological-anatomical curiosity. Von Recklinghausen's name would instead become associated with neurofibromatosis after a classic paper in 1881. ;1864: German pathologist Rudolf Virchow published a three-volume work on tumours that described a child with cerebral tuberous sclerosis and rhabdomyoma of the heart. His description contained the first hint that this may be an inherited disease: the child's sister had died of a cerebral tumour.(As cited in Acierno (1994)) ;1880: French neurologist Désiré-Magloire Bourneville had a chance encounter with the disease that would bear his name. He was working as an unofficial assistant to Jean Martin Charcot at La Salpêtrière. While substituting for his teacher, Louis J.F. Delasiauve, (contains an abridged translation of Bourneville's 1880 paper) he attended to Marie, a 15-year-old girl with psychomotor retardation, epilepsy and a \\"confluent vascular-papulous eruption of the nose, the cheeks and forehead\\". She had a history of seizures since infancy and was taken to the children's hospital aged three and declared a hopeless case. She had learning difficulties and could neither walk nor talk. While under Bourneville's care, Marie had an ever-increasing number of seizures, which came in clusters. She was treated with quinquina, bromide of camphor, amyl nitrite, and the application of leeches behind the ears. On 7 May 1879 Marie died in her hospital bed. The post-mortem examination disclosed hard, dense tubers in the cerebral convolutions, which Bourneville named Sclérose tubéreuse des circonvolutions cérébrales. He concluded they were the source (focus) of her seizures. In addition, whitish hard masses, one \\"the size of a walnut\\", were found in both kidneys. ;1881: German physician Hartdegen described the case of a two-day-old baby who died in status epilepticus. Post-mortem examination revealed small tumours in the lateral ventricles of the brain and areas of cortical sclerosis, which he called \\"glioma gangliocellulare cerebri congenitum\\". Cerebral tuberous sclerosis showing sclerotic, hypertrophic circumvolutions. ;1881: Bourneville and Édouard Brissaud examined a four-year- old boy at La Bicêtre. As before, this patient had cortical tubers, epilepsy and learning difficulties. In addition he had a heart murmur and, on post- mortem examination, had tiny hard tumours in the ventricle walls in the brain (subependymal nodules) and small tumours in the kidneys (angiomyolipomas).(As cited in Curatolo (2003)) ;1885: French physicians Félix Balzer and Pierre Eugène Ménétrier reported a case of \\"adénomes sébacés de la face et du cuir\\" (adenoma of the sebaceous glands of the face and scalp).(As cited in Curatolo (2003)) The term has since proved to be incorrect as they are neither adenoma nor derived from sebaceous glands. The papular rash is now known as facial angiofibroma. ;1885: French dermatologists François Henri Hallopeau and Émile Leredde published a case of adenoma sebaceum that was of a hard and fibrous nature. They first described the shagreen plaques and later would note an association between the facial rash and epilepsy.(As cited in Curatolo (2003)) ;1890: Scottish dermatologist John James Pringle, working in London, described a 25-year-old woman with subnormal intelligence, rough lesions on the arms and legs, and a papular facial rash. Pringle brought attention to five previous reports, two of which were unpublished. Pringle's adenoma sebaceum would become a common eponym for the facial rash. Early 20th century A woman with adenoma sebaceum, 1900. Jan van der Hoeve's retinal phakoma. ;1901: Italian physician GB Pellizzi studied the pathology of the cerebral lesions. He noted their dysplastic nature, the cortical heterotopia and defective myelination. Pellizzi classified the tubers into type 1 (smooth surface) and type 2 (with central depressions).(As cited in Curatolo (2003)) ;1903: German physician Richard Kothe described periungual fibromas, which were later rediscovered by the Dutch physician Johannes Koenen in 1932 (known as Koenen's tumours).(As cited in Rott (2005)) ;1906: Australian neurologist Alfred Walter Campbell, working in England, considered the lesions in the brain, skin, heart and kidney to be caused by one disease. He also first described the pathology in the eye. His review of 20 reported cases led him to suggest a diagnostic triad of symptoms that is more commonly attributed to Vogt. ;1908: German paediatric neurologist Heinrich Vogt established the diagnostic criteria for TSC, firmly associating the facial rash with the neurological consequences of the cortical tubers.(As cited in Curatolo (2003) and fully cited by Who Named It?) Vogt's triad of epilepsy, idiocy, and adenoma sebaceum held for 60 years until research by Manuel Gómez discovered that fewer than a third of patients with TSC had all three symptoms. ;1910: J. Kirpicznick was first to recognise that TSC was a genetic condition. He described cases of identical and fraternal twins and also one family with three successive generations affected.(As cited in Curatolo (2003)) ;1911: Edward Sherlock, barrister-at- law and lecturer in biology, reported nine cases in his book on the \\"feeble- minded\\". He coined the term epiloia, a portmanteau of epilepsy and anoia (mindless).(As cited in Jay (2004)) The word is no longer widely used as a synonym for TSC. The geneticist Robert James Gorlin suggested in 1981 that it could be a useful acronym for epilepsy, low intelligence, and adenoma sebaceum. ;1913: H. Berg is credited with first stating that TSC was a hereditary disorder, noting its transmission through two or three generations.(As cited in Curatolo (2003)) ;1914: P. Schuster described a patient with adenoma sebaceum and epilepsy but of normal intelligence. This reduced phenotypic expression is called a forme fruste.(As cited in Curatolo (2003)) ;1918: French physician René Lutembacher published the first report of cystic lung disease in a patient with TSC. The 36-year-old woman died from bilateral pneumothoraces. Lutembacher believed the cysts and nodules to be metastases from a renal fibrosarcoma. This complication, which only affects women, is now known as lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM).(As cited in Curatolo (2003)) ;1920: Dutch ophthalmologist Jan van der Hoeve described the retinal hamartomas (phakoma). He grouped both TSC and neurofibromatosis together as \\"phakomatoses\\" (later called neurocutaneous syndromes).(As cited in Curatolo (2003)) ;1924: H. Marcus noted that characteristic features of TSC such as intracranial calcifications were visible on x-ray.(As cited by , as cited in Curatolo (2003) and Gómez (1995)) Mid-20th century ;1932: MacDonald Critchley and Charles J.C. Earl studied 29 patients with TSC who were in mental institutions. They described behaviour—unusual hand movements, bizarre attitudes and repetitive movements (stereotypies)—that today would be recognised as autistic. However it would be 11 years before Leo Kanner suggested the term \\"autism\\". They also noticed the associated white spots on the skin (hypomelanic macules). ;1934: N.J. Berkwitz and L.G. Rigler showed it was possible to diagnose tuberous sclerosis using pneumoencephalography to highlight non-calcified subependymal nodules. These resembled \\"the wax drippings of a burning candle\\" on the lateral ventricles.(As cited in Gómez (1995)) ;1942: Sylvan E. Moolten proposed \\"the tuberous sclerosis complex\\", which is now the preferred name. This recognises the multi-organ nature of the disease. Moolten introduced three words to describe its pathology: \\"the basic lesion is hamartial, becoming in turn tumor-like (hamartoma) or truly neoplastic (hamartoblastoma).\\" ;1954: Norwegian pathologist Reidar Eker bred a line of Wistar rats predisposed to renal adenomas. The Eker rat became an important model of dominantly inherited cancer.(As cited in Yeung (1994)) ;1966: Phanor Perot and Bryce Weir pioneered surgical intervention for epilepsy in TSC. Of the seven patients who underwent cortical tuber resection, two became seizure-free. Prior to this, only four patients had ever been surgically treated for epilepsy in TSC.(As cited in ) ;1967: J.C. Lagos and Manuel Rodríguez Gómez reviewed 71 TSC cases and found that 38% of patients have normal intelligence.(As cited in Curatolo (2003)) ;1971: American geneticist Alfred Knudson developed his \\"two hit\\" hypothesis to explain the formation of retinoblastoma in both children and adults. The children had a congenital germline mutation which was combined with an early lifetime somatic mutation to cause a tumour. This model applies to many conditions involving tumour suppressor genes such as TSC.(As cited in Rott (2005)) In the 1980s, Knudson's studies on the Eker rat strengthened this hypothesis. ;1975: Giuseppe Pampiglione and E. Pugh, in a letter to The Lancet, noted that up to 69% of patients presented with infantile spasms. ;1975: Riemann first used ultrasound to examine TSC-affected kidneys in the case of a 35-year-old woman with chronic renal failure.(As cited in Rott (2005)) Late 20th century Normal cranial CT scan. Normal cranial PET scan. ;1976: Cranial computed tomography (CT, invented 1972) proved to be an excellent tool for diagnosing cerebral neoplasms in children, including those found in tuberous sclerosis. ;1977: Ann Mercy Hunt MBE and others found the Tuberous Sclerosis Association in the UK to provide self help and to fund research. ;1979: Manuel Gómez published a monograph: \\"Tuberous Sclerosis\\" that remained the standard textbook for three editions over two decades. The book described the full clinical spectrum of TSC for the first time and established a new set of diagnostic criteria to replace the Vogt triad.(As cited in Özgür (2005)) ;1982: Kenneth Arndt successfully treated facial angiofibroma with an argon laser.(As cited in Rott (2005)) ;1983: Positron emission tomography (PET, invented 1981) was compared to electroencephalography (EEG) and CT. It was found to be capable of locating epileptogenic cortical tubers that would otherwise have been missed.(As cited in Rott (2005)) ;1984: The cluster of infantile spasms in TSC was discovered to be preceded by a focal EEG discharge.(As cited in Curatolo (2003)) ;1985: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, invented 1980) was first used in TSC to identify affected regions in the brain of a girl with tuberous sclerosis.(As cited in Rott (2005)) ;1987: MR was judged superior to CT imaging for both sensitivity and specificity. In a study of fifteen patients, it identified subependymal nodules projecting into the lateral ventricles in twelve patients, distortion of the normal cortical architecture in ten patients (corresponding to cortical tubers), dilated ventricles in five patients, and distinguished a known astrocytoma from benign subependymal nodules in one patient. ;1987: MR imaging was found to be capable of predicting the clinical severity of the disease (epilepsy and developmental delay). A study of 25 patients found a correlation with the number of cortical tubers identified. In contrast, CT was not a useful predictor, but was superior at identifying calcified lesions.(As cited in Curatolo (2003)) ;1987: Linkage analysis on 19 families with TSC located a probable gene on chromosome 9. ;1988: Cortical tubers found on MR imaging corresponded exactly to the location of persistent EEG foci, in a study of six children with TSC. In particular, frontal cortical tubers were associated with more intractable seizures.(As cited in Curatolo (2003)) ;1990: Vigabatrin was found to be a highly effective antiepileptic treatment for infantile spasms, particularly in children with TSC. Following the discovery in 1997 of severe persistent visual field constriction as a possible side-effect, vigabatrin monotherapy is now largely restricted to this patient group. ;1992: Linkage analysis located a second gene to chromosome 16p13.3, close to the polycystic kidney disease type 1 (PKD1) gene. ;1993: The European Chromosome 16 Tuberous Sclerosis Consortium announced the cloning of TSC2; its product is called tuberin.(As cited in Rott (2005)) ;1994: The Eker rat was discovered to be an animal model for tuberous sclerosis; it has a mutation in the rat-equivalent of the TSC2 gene. ;1995: MRI with fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences was reported to be significantly better than standard T2-weighted images at highlighting small tubers, especially subcortical ones. ;1997: The TSC1 Consortium announced the cloning of TSC1; its product is called hamartin. ;1997: The PKD1 gene, which leads to autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), and the TSC2 gene were discovered to be adjacent on chromosome 16p13.3. A team based at the Institute of Medical Genetics in Wales studied 27 unrelated patients with TSC and renal cystic disease. They concluded that serious renal disease in those with TSC is usually due to contiguous gene deletions of TSC2 and PKD1. They also noted that the disease was different (earlier and more severe) than ADPKD and that patients with TSC1 did not suffer significant cystic disease. ;1997: Patrick Bolton and Paul Griffiths examined 18 patients with TSC, half of whom had some form of autism. They found a strong association between tubers in the temporal lobes and the patients with autism. ;1998:The Tuberous Sclerosis Consensus Conference issued revised diagnostic criteria. ;1998: An Italian team used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to study three patients with TSC and partial epilepsy. Combined with MRI, they were able to study the association between tuberous areas of the brain, neuronal malfunctioning and epileptogenic areas. Later studies would confirm that MEG is superior to EEG in identifying the eliptogenic tuber, which may be a candidate for surgical resection. 21st century Rapamycin (sirolimus) ;2001: A multi-centre cohort of 224 patients were examined for mutations and disease severity. Those with TSC1 were less severely affected than those with TSC2. They had fewer seizures and less mental impairment. Some symptoms of TSC were rare or absent in those with TSC1. A conclusion is that \\"both germline and somatic mutations appear to be less common in TSC1 than in TSC2\\". ;2002: Several research groups investigated how the TSC1 and TSC2 gene products (tuberin and hamartin) work together to inhibit mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-mediated downstream signalling. This important pathway regulates cell proliferation and tumour suppression. ;2002: Treatment with rapamycin (sirolimus) was found to shrink tumours in the Eker rat (TSC2) and mouse (TSC1) models of tuberous sclerosis. ;2006: Small trials showed promising results in the use of rapamycin to shrink angiomyolipoma and astrocytomas. Several larger multicentre clinical trials began: lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) and kidney angiomyolipoma (AML) were treated with rapamycin; giant cell astrocytomas were treated with the rapamycin derivative everolimus. 2012 A consensus conference was held and revised guidelines for the diagnosis and management of tuberous sclerosis were published.

Williams was born in Hereford, Herefordshire. Beginning his musical career on lead guitar and accordion, he switched to bass in 1964, playing in numerous line- ups and backing chart artistes of the day such as Vince Taylor and Bert Weedon before joining soul band Lloyd Alexander Real Estate, which contained, or was associated with, the future members of Audience. When Audience folded, Williams went on to play sessions for numerous artistes, also joining The Nashville Teens and Jonathan Kelly's Outside before retiring from the music business in 1975 to pursue interests in animal welfare, ultimately founding The Fox Project, a wildlife charity. Williams reformed Audience in 2004 with other co-founders Howard Werth and Keith Gemmell, plus new drummer John Fisher, who died in 2008 and was subsequently replaced by Simon Jeffrey. Audience finally folded in 2013 due to Gemmell's declining health and Williams' reluctance to continue with substitute musicians. In 2009, Williams joined Blue Pulse, releasing, in May 2012, an album entitled Trams, largely featuring his own material.

It is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and a Grade I listed building. It is thought that the mound on which the keep stands was a site used by the ancient Britons and that in Anglian times there was a stronghold on the site held by Mildred, son of Ackman. The present castle was built about 1160 by the Umfraville family at the request of King Henry II on land awarded to them following the Norman Conquest, presumably as a defence against the Scots. Not long after its erection, in 1174, it was taken by the Scots and was then rebuilt more strongly. In 1296 it was besieged by Robert de Ros and some 40,000 men, but the siege by the supporters of John Balliol was withstood.Northumberland National Park: Harbottle Castle, accessed March 2017 In the 1310s Robert the Bruce captured the castle. It was restored in 1336, but was in ruins again by 1351. It was repaired at the end of the 14th century and in about 1436 the castle passed into the hands of the Tailleboys. It was for a long time the residence of the Warden of the Middle Marches and used as a prison. A child's poem about the castle set in stone In 1515, Margaret Tudor, the widowed queen of King James IV of Scotland and sister of King Henry VIII of England, having been banished by the regent, John Stewart, Duke of Albany, came to the castle with her second husband, Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus. There, their daughter was born, who was also called Margaret. Margaret Douglas was to become the mother of Lord Darnley, the second husband of Mary, Queen of Scots, and grandmother of King James VI of Scotland and I of England. Further building work took place between 1541 and 1551 and more repairs were made in 1563. In 1605, King James I granted the castle and manor to George Home, 1st Earl of Dunbar, Lord Treasurer of Scotland, but thereafter, the castle fell into decay and much of its masonry was used in other buildings. A survey of 1715 reported the castle to be ruinous once more. Today, only earthworks and some standing masonry remains. The site is run by the Northumberland National Park Authority and entry to it is free. Confusingly, following the abandonment of the castle as a residence, the name Harbottle Castle was reused as follows:- Harbottle Castle () is also the name of a 19th-century mansion house situated at the east end of Harbottle village. Stone from the derelict medieval castle was used in the building of a 17th- century manor house. The manor was acquired by Percival Clennell in 1796, and in 1829, the house was replaced on the site with a two-storied five-bayed mansion designed by architect John Dobson for Fenwick Clennell. The house is protected with Grade II listed building status. The stable block was converted into a separate house in 1890.

Robert began to study in London for the medical profession, but ill-health caused him to return to settle in Cornwall. In 1829, he published The Mount’s Bay; a descriptive poem ... and other piecesThe Mount’s Bay; a descriptive poem ... and other pieces Penzance : J. Downing & T.

Here he met Robert Were Fox, and carried on some physical and chemical investigations with him. =Career= He was appointed Professor of Mechanical Science, Government School of Mines. In 1845, he accepted the invitation of Sir Henry de la Beche to become keeper of mining records at the Museum of Economic (afterwards Practical) Geology, and when the school of mines was established in 1851 he lectured for two years on mechanical science, and afterwards for a short time on experimental physics. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Statistical Society in 1855. In 1858, he founded, with the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society, The Miners Association. His principal work was the collection and editing of the Mineral Statistics of the United Kingdom,Introduction to Mineral Statistics by the Mining History Network and this he continued to the date of his retirement (1883), when the mining record office was transferred to the Home Office. He was elected fellow of the Royal Society in 1852. In 1884, he published a large volume on British Mining in which the subject was dealt with very fully from an historical as well as a practical point of view. He also edited the fifth and some later editions of Andrew Ure's Dictionary of Arts, Mines and Manufactures. =Other interests= Hunt had many interests outside of mineralogy, and published several popular books on various topics. He was an early pioneer in photography, a poet, and an antiquarian with a keen interest in folklore. Following Daguerre's development of the daguerreotype in 1839, Hunt took up photography with great zeal. Just two years later, in 1841, he published his Manual of Photography, which was the first English treatise on the subject.Manual of Photography: reproduced online in Googlebooks. Hunt also experimented generally on the action of light, and published Researches on Light in 1844. He also developed the actinograph in 1845. Hunt had a long-abiding interest in poetry as well. He regularly wrote and published poetry and tried in the 1830s to pursue a career as a playwright. In 1848, Hunt published the hugely ambitious work The Poetry of Science, which outlined most of the important discoveries that had been made in natural philosophy until that time, while also communicating the aesthetic aspects of science to the general reader. In it, Hunt was attempting to make it clear that science and objective discovery were subjects worthy of poetic language.The Poetry of Victorian Science He also collected and wrote Popular Romances of the West of England (1865),Popular Romances of the West of England full text online of the third edition (1903) which included a record of myths and legends of old Cornwall, and proved so popular that it went through a number of editions. =Death and legacy= He died in London on 17 October 1887. A mineralogical museum at Redruth Mining School was established in his memory, but this closed in 1950 and the minerals were transferred to the School of Metalliferous Mining now the Camborne School of Mines.

History  There have been a set of various historical and contemporary movements that aim to use local government to develop socialism, especially in the United States and United Kingdom. = In the United States = Municipal socialism has been used to describe public ownership of streetcar lines, waterworks, and other local utilities, as was favored by \\"Progressives\\" in the United States in the late 1890s/early 1900s.Source: The American Nation: A History of the United States (Authors: Mark C.

A chapter on municipal socialism appears in Class in America: an Encyclopedia: > The heyday of municipal socialism is generally considered to have been from > 1901 to 1917. [...] In 1911 there were seventy-three Cities with socialist > mayors, and over 1,200 other socialist elected officials across the nation. = In the United Kingdom = The term municipal socialism has been used to describe the local government-led social reform developed in the United Kingdom. This includes the reforms initiated by Joseph Chamberlain as mayor of Birmingham between 1873 and 1875. These reforms included rendering gas and water supplies public services, controlled by the government, clearing slums and the introduction of a city park system. Chamberlain's reforms were influential on Beatrice Webb, one of the leaders of the Fabian movement. Beatrice Webb's husband, Sidney Webb, wrote in Socialism in England, published in the 1890s: > It is not only in matters of sanitation that this 'Municipal Socialism' is > progressing. Nearly half the consumers of the Kingdom already consume gas > made by themselves as citizens collectively, in 168 different localities, as > many as 14 local authorities obtained the power to borrow money to engage in > the gas industry in a single year.

The Fabians were influential in the London County Council and London School Board, as well as in some other local authorities, through the newly formed Labour Party. A more radical expression of the municipal socialist movement was Poplarism in Poplar, east London, led by George Lansbury. More recently, the term refers to the attempts in the 1980s in British cities by hard left activists in the British Labour Party to win control of local authorities and use them to develop left-wing policies on a local level, in opposition to Margaret Thatcher's right-wing Conservative central government. Examples include the Greater London Council under \\"Red\\" Ken Livingstone, Lambeth council under \\"Red\\" Ted Knight and Linda Bellos, Liverpool council under Derek Hatton and Sheffield council (sometimes referred to as \\"the People's Republic of South Yorkshire\\") under David Blunkett. These authorities were often derided as \\"loony left\\" by Conservative supporting tabloid newspapers. Recently, municipal socialism has seen a comeback in the city of Preston: which was brought to notoriety by The Economist piece on the topic. https://www.economist.com/britain/2017/10/19/preston-jeremy-corbyns-model-town The New Statesman has also called the policies of the town \\"new municipalism\\" and \\"community wealth building\\" alongside that of municipal socialism.https://www.newstatesman.com/spotlight/2019/04/what-new- municipalism-and-can-it-really-combat-austerity Both The Economist and New Statesman tie the projects to Jeremy Corbyn's leadership of the Labour Party.  Critical reception by communists  Vladimir Lenin was sharply critical of municipal socialism when the idea was taken up by Russian Mensheviks in the early twentieth century: > The bourgeois intelligentsia of the West, like the English Fabians, elevate > municipal socialism to a special “trend” precisely because it dreams of > social peace, of class conciliation, and seeks to divert public attention > away from the fundamental questions of the economic system as a whole, and > of the state structure as a whole, to minor questions of local self- > government. In the sphere of questions in the first category, the class > antagonisms stand out most sharply; that is the sphere which, as we have > shown, affects the very foundations of the class rule of the bourgeoisie. > Hence it is in that sphere that the philistine, reactionary utopia of > bringing about socialism piecemeal is particularly hopeless. The Marxist left was similarly critical of municipal socialism in its 1980s incarnation. The Revolutionary Communist Group wrote: > \\"Municipal socialism\\" became an avenue that Labour used to retain the > allegiance of the new labour aristocracy from the public sector. Many jobs > and ‘non-jobs’ were given to this already privileged layer as the left > feathered its own nest. Spurious community groups, housing schemes, race > relations and ethnic minority units for tiny privileged layers of black and > Irish people were set up and paid for. They were all designed to foster the > interests of those who found jobs and funding through them, with little > benefit to those who were really suffering the onslaught of Thatcherism. > Even when \\"municipal socialism\\" took on a popular and widely supported > position, its limitations were quickly exposed. The Fare's Fair dispute of > 1982 showed this at an early stage, after the Law Lords overruled an attempt > to introduce cheap fares on London transport, and Ken Livingstone's Greater > London Council did not make a serious fight of it. In reality, Thatcher > destroyed \\"municipal socialism\\" by continually restricting local democracy > and the rights of local authorities to raise and spend money.David Yaffe > 2001  See also  * Civic Gospel * Libertarian municipalism * Herbert Morrison * Militant tendency  References   Further reading  * Gutav Cohn \\"Municipal Socialism\\" The Economic Journal 1910 * Municipal Socialism in Europe, by G.

He currently is the television play-by-play commentator for the Seattle Mariners on Root Sports Northwest and is the co-host (with Mike Krzyzewski) of Basketball and Beyond with Coach K on Sirius XM Satellite Radio. Sims was also the television play-by-play host for the UFL on Versus. Biography Sims grew up in Philadelphia and attended Bethany College in West Virginia, where he played one year of varsity football, finishing third in kickoff returns in the Presidents' Athletic Conference, and catcher for the Bison baseball team (in Division III) and majored in mass communications. He began his career as a sportswriter for the New York Daily News. In the early 1980s he was a sports reporter for the short lived \\"Satellite News Channel\\". Moving to radio, Sims became the host of WNBC's SportsNight in the mid-1980s (replacing Jack Spector), a five-hour nightly sports call-in show that was a precursor to the all-sports talk format of WFAN. He went on to cohost the midday show with Ed Coleman on New York's Sports Radio 66 WFAN on in the early 1990s, the show being nicknamed \\"Coleman and the Soul Man\\". He then became a weekend sports anchor at WCBS-TV in New York and also was a radio host for the New York Knicks. From 1990-1992 Sims was the radio voice of Temple Owls football in the Big East. In 1991, Sims joined ESPN as a play-by-play announcer for college basketball, and added college football in 1998. He primarily called Big East contests on the ESPN Plus regional network. He continues to broadcast college basketball games for FOX and FS1. Sims was the #2 broadcaster for NFL on Westwood One Sports's Sunday afternoon doubleheader before taking the permanent play-by-play position on Sunday Night Football. He replaced Joel Meyers on the Sunday Night Football game in 2006. Sims worked \\"Sunday Night Football\\" games from 2006 to 2012. In 2013 Sims returned to Sunday Afternoon NFL action, working with former NFL quarterback, Mark Malone. In addition to Sunday Night Football, Sims also calls college basketball for Westwood One, with his most notable call to date being the George Mason-UConn regional final in 2006 (where #11 seed George Mason upset top-seed Connecticut to become the second #11 seed in history to reach the Final Four). While working in other sports, he occasionally provided Major League Baseball play-by-play for ESPN and did an internet radio show for MLB.com. In , he took the opportunity to return to baseball full-time as part of the Seattle Mariners television broadcast. One of the few African-American broadcasters in the sport, he is also perhaps the only one of that group not to have played in the major leagues. His broadcast partner is former Mariner Mike Blowers. Sims was the broadcaster on the FOX television network on April 21, 2012, describing Philip Humber's perfect game. However, the game was broadcast in its entirety only in the Chicago and Seattle markets, because the rest of the country heard Joe Buck and Tim McCarver call a game between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox. Because the game was broadcast on FOX in both markets, Sims had to call the game from a neutral standpoint as a broadcaster and not as the usual Mariners broadcaster, even though his team lost to a perfect game. Just four months after calling Philip Humber's perfect game, Félix Hernández threw the first perfect game in Mariners' history. Sims called the game for Root Sports in Seattle. This is the first time that one broadcaster has called two perfect games in the same Major League Baseball season. Notable catchphrases Sims is noted for using the following catchphrases on Mariner broadcasts: *\\"Giddy up! Baby! Giddy up!\\"- used on exciting plays and also used on balls that may go over the fence for a homerun. *\\"Boomstick Baby!\\"- used whenever Nelson Cruz hit a homerun. *\\"Holy Mackerel!\\" *”Bro-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-ther.” - used after a particularly dispiriting loss or play. *\\"There's a drive! Deep to left/right field! Say goodbye!” \\"Hey Lloyd, do some delivery... from a truck... to the airport!\\" \\"A three run jack by Seager!\\"- used when Kyle Seager hit a three run homerun for his fourth hit of the night at Yankee Stadium on June 2, 2014. Sims is a staunch believer in letting his audience know when a pitcher is working on a no-hitter. \\"That dugout superstition is not my concern. Telling the story of the game is what I do.\\" References External links * Category:Living people Category:1953 births Category:African-American sports journalists Category:American sports journalists Category:American radio sports announcers Category:American television sports announcers Category:Bethany College (West Virginia) alumni Category:Bethany Bison baseball players Category:Bethany Bison football players Category:College basketball announcers in the United States Category:College football announcers Category:Major League Baseball broadcasters Category:National Football League announcers Category:United Football League broadcasters Category:Television anchors from New York City Category:Television personalities from Philadelphia Category:Seattle Mariners broadcasters Category:Tampa Bay Buccaneers broadcasters Category:New York Knicks broadcasters Category:National Basketball Association broadcasters Category:Sportswriters from New York (state) Category:Sportswriters from Pennsylvania ","title":"Dave Sims"},{"id":"8888806","text":"Interstate 80 (I-80) is a part of the Interstate Highway System that runs from San Francisco to Teaneck, New Jersey. In Wyoming, the Interstate Highway runs from the Utah state line near Evanston east to the Nebraska state line in Pine Bluffs. I-80 connects Cheyenne, Wyoming's capital and largest city, with several smaller cities along the southern tier of Wyoming, including Evanston, Green River, Rock Springs, Rawlins, and Laramie. The highway also connects those cities with Salt Lake City to the west and Omaha to the east. In Cheyenne, I-80 intersects I-25 and has Wyoming's only auxiliary Interstate, I-180. The Interstate runs concurrently with U.S. Route 30 (US 30) for most of their courses in Wyoming. I-80 also has shorter concurrencies with US 189 near Evanston, US 191 near Rock Springs, and US 287 and Wyoming Highway 789 (WYO 789) near Rawlins. The Interstate has business loops through all six cities along its course as well as a loop serving Fort Bridger and Lyman east of Evanston. On April 14, 2019, the Republican controlled state legislature of both the state house and the state senate proposed that the entire route of Interstate 80 in Wyoming from the Utah state line to the Nebraska state line in both directions to be converted as a toll road. Route description =Evanston to Rock Springs= I-80 enters Uinta County concurrent with US 189 from Summit County, Utah, west of Evanston, the county seat of Uinta County.

It operated both the city buses, and the Trondheim Tramway until 1988. The company was owned by the city council. TT was founded in 1972 as a merged between the municipal owned tramway companies Trondheim Sporvei and Graakalbanen, and the bus company Bynesruten. In 1974, the company was reorganized as a municipal agency, and also took over the private bus operator Trondheim Bilruter, along with the city bus lines of Klæburuten and NSB Bilruter. In 2001, the company merged with Hemne og Orkladal Billag to create Team Trafikk, that was later sold to Nettbuss. History =Establishment= Since 1966, the City of Trondheim had owned two tramway companies, Trondheim Sporvei and Graakalbanen. It also owned the majority of the bus company Bynesruten. In 1969, the city council decided to merge the three companies into Trondheim Trafikkselskap, and to organize it as a limited company to limit bureaucratization, and realize efficiency through simpler decision making. The company was formally founded on 28 July 1971, and took over the three other companies on 1 January 1972. Odd Hovdenak, former director of Trondheim Sporvei, was appointed CEO.Kjenstad, 2005: 252 During fall 1972, TT had had to ask the city council for a total of in loans to cover operational expenses. The time when public transport in Trondheim could operate with a profit was over.

Also the routes operated by Klæburuten within the city limits were to be taken over. There had been no effictivizations due to the limited company model, and instead the new TT would be organized as a municipal agency. In 1973, the last year Trondheim Bilruter operated on itself, it lost NOK 880,000. The city had also granted that company a loan. Both it and TT transported about nine million passengers that year. The city paid NOK 9.5 million for TRB, and received 59 Scania CR 76, CR 110 and CR 111 buses bought after 1966, in addition to 25 older models. TRB had eleven routes. From both NSB and Klæburuten the city had agreed to take over eleven buses. However, the city forgot to specify which buses were to be taken over, and they received the oldest buses from each of the companies. None of the buses from NSB, that were handed over on 25 July 1974, were in usable condition. The part of Klæburuten was taken over for NOK 1.1. million. Until 1979, 33 new Scania CR111 and 31 MAN SL200 buses were bought. This required the depot at Sorgenfri to be expanded.Kjenstad, 2005: 267–68 Arne Watle, since 1951 CEO of Trondheim Bilruter, was appointed CEO of the new company. Hovdenak became CFO. The two administrations were merged, but not reduces, creating 52 administrative positions. In the beginning there were also problems with two very different corporate cultures. TT established itself at Sorgenfri, after the administration of the former companies had been scattered around town. The former buses used by Trondheim Sporvei were moved to Sorgenfri, and the disabled transport took over their location at Dalsenget Depot.Kjenstad, 2005: 263–64 Ticket prices increased from NOK 1.40 to 1.50, and a new logo, that combined the wings of TBR and the city's coat of arms used by the tramway. From May the buses and trams were repainted in a new color scheme. The former two-color trams (with blue tops and yellow bottoms) and red buses were instead painted two-color with yellow tops and blue bottoms. In 1975, pensioners and welfare recipients received half price, after having fought for this since 1957. From 1 October, monthly passes were also introduced. The zones were extended, so the entire Gråkall Line was within a single fare. In 1976, public transport ridership increased by 12%, including an 8.9% increase for the trams; TT transport 20.3 million passengers that year, of which 6 million were by tram. The municipality subsidies with NOK 24.6 million, and the county with NOK 3.5 million. However, county subsidies were not available for the tram routes, which also had to cover the cost of infrastructure.Kjenstad, 2005: 269 References =Notes= =Bibliography= * Category:Bus companies of Trøndelag Category:Companies based in Trondheim Category:Companies formerly owned by municipalities of Norway Category:Defunct bus companies of Norway Category:Defunct railway companies of Norway Category:Trondheim Tramway operators Category:Railway companies established in 1971 Category:Railway companies disestablished in 2001 Category:Norwegian companies established in 1971 Category:Companies disestablished in 2001 Category:2001 disestablishments in Norway ","title":"Trondheim Trafikkselskap"},{"id":"8888876","text":"Mark Levengood in 2007 Mark Levengood, (born 10 July 1964 in Lejeune Base Camp, North Carolina, in the United States), is a Finnish journalist, writer, and television host who is working in Sweden.

The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria has several churches in Great Britain and Ireland under the jurisdiction of four diocesan bishops. The first liturgical service prayed in the British Isles took place in London on 10 August 1954, officiated by delegates attending the general assembly of the World Council of Churches. The foundation of the church and its establishment of a parish started with a liturgical service held in London in February 1969, prayed by the Bishop of Christian Education, Shenouda (later Pope Shenouda III of Alexandria, the 117th pope of the church). Regular services only began in 1971 when the first resident Coptic priest, Father Antuniyus al-Suryani (later Metropolitan Pakhomious of Beheira), celebrated the Divine Liturgy at Saint Andrew's Church, Holborn, London. In 1976, the church council purchased a building in Kensington, establishing the Coptic Orthodox parish of St Mark; this was served by three monastic priests, who later on became members of the Holy Synod of the mother church in Egypt. Pope Shenouda III consecrated St. Mark's Coptic Orthodox Church in Kensington, London in 1979. By 1981, other communities had been established around Britain and Ireland, with regular services at which visiting priests officiated, including Fr Bishoy Boshra and Fr Antonious Thabet. In April 1985, St Mary & St Antony's Coptic Orthodox Church in Birmingham was consecrated by the first resident bishop sent to Britain, Bishop Missael, making it the second church to be established in England and the first outside London. Following the establishment of St Mary & S. Mark's Coptic Orthodox Centre in Birmingham, Bishop Missael was consecrated on 26 May 1991 by Pope Shenouda III as the first bishop of the first Coptic Orthodox diocese in the British Isles, the Diocese of Birmingham, which became the Diocese of the Midlands. In 1995, Bishop Antony was consecrated with the formation of the Diocese of Ireland, Scotland, North East England and its Affiliated Regions. Fr Angaelos Anba Bishoy (now Bishop Angaelos) of Archangel Michael & St Anthony Coptic Centre in Stevenage was consecrated in 1999 as a general bishop and patriarchal exarch for youth ministry at the Patriarchal Centre and the Coptic Orthodox Theological College. The Coptic Orthodox Church and congregation has continued to grow and expand in various parts of Britain and Ireland. Historical background It is known in the ecclesiastical history of the Church of Alexandria that the church had sent missionaries in the 3rd or 4th century to the Celtic lands, especially monks. It is also known within the Celtic tradition, especially in Ireland, that the foundation of the monastic system among the Celts was either based in portion on or inspired by the Egyptian monastic system, and there are many traces of Alexandrine theology embedded in Celtic theology.

After the LBSCR came to a co-operation agreement with the Compagnie des Chemins de Fer de l'État Français, she transferred to their fleet under a French flag. Sussex became the focus of an international incident when she was severely damaged by a torpedo from a German U-Boat in 1916 and at least 50 passengers died. After the war she was repaired and sold to Greece in 1919, being renamed Aghia Sophia. Following a fire in 1921, the ship was scrapped. Description and construction Built in 1896 by William Denny and Brothers of Dumbarton at a cost of UK£60,016 for the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway Company, with some participation of the French Compagnie des chemins de fer de l'Ouest (CF de l'Ouest) which had been operating the Newhaven-Dieppe service jointly since 1863. Sussex was an almost exact replacement of the 1893-built Seaford, which sank in 1895 after collision with another LBSCR vessel, the cargo ship Lyon; in the light of that sinking, an extra watertight bulkhead was incorporated. Sussex had a certified capacity of 750 passengers. Sussex was { long, with a beam of , depth of and draught of . As built, she measured 1,117 GRT and 328 NRT. She was powered by two four-cylinder triple expansion steam engines made by Denny & Co, totalling 308 nhp or 4772 ihp, to give the required service speed of . Sussex was launched on 30 April 1896 by Viscountess Duncannon, whose husband was a director, and later chairman, of LBSCR. The ferry undertook builders' trials on 10 and 14 July, achieving , and was delivered on 18 July. History Sussex served on the Newhaven - Dieppe route, making her maiden voyage on 31 July 1896. In March 1912 she came to the assistance of the stricken P&O; liner , which had been in collision with the 2850-ton German-registered 4 masted steel-barque Pisagua and subsequently sank with the loss of 9 lives. Replaced by the on the Newhaven - Dieppe route in 1913, she was moved to Brighton to offer long day trip excursions, in competition with the White Funnel fleet paddle steamers of Bristol-based P and A Campbell. However, this proved unlucrative, and she was laid up from the end of that season. She was then sold in 1914 to the Compagnie des Chemins de Fer de l'État Français, remaining under the management of the LBSCR. =World War I= During the First World War, shipping from Newhaven was diverted to operate from Folkestone in order to free Newhaven for supplying British troops on the Western Front. On 24 March 1916, Sussex was on a voyage from Folkestone to Dieppe when she was torpedoed by . The ship was severely damaged, with the entire bow forward of the bridge blown off. Some of the lifeboats were launched, but at least two of them capsized and many passengers were drowned.Lyn MacDonald, The Roses of No Man's Land (London: Macmillan, 1980). pp. 139-143. Of the 53 crew and 325 passengers, at least 50 were killed, although a figure of between 80 and 100 is also suggested. Sussex remained afloat and was eventually towed stern-first into Boulogne harbour. The dead included the celebrated Spanish composer Enrique Granados, his wife Amparo, a Persian prince, Bahram Mirza Sardar Mass'oud, and Irish tennis player Manliffe Goodbody. Vera Collum, returning to her hospital in France where she worked as a radiographer, was badly injured. Several Americans were injured, including Wilder Penfield, then a medical student at Oxford University and later an eminent neurosurgeon. His left leg was shattered by the blast, and Penfield required months of treatment and rehabilitation afterward.Penfield, Wilder (1977). No Man Alone: A Neurosurgeon's Life, p. 36. Little, Brown and Company, Toronto. Although none of the 75 US citizens aboard were killed,Macdonald, p. 139. the incident enraged public opinion in the United States, and caused a heated diplomatic exchange between the US and German governments. In May 1916, Germany issued a declaration, the so-called Sussex pledge, which effectively represented the suspension of the \\"intensified\\" U-boat campaign. Between 1 and 3 January 1917, , , , , assisted in the salvage of Sussex after she struck a mine near the West Dyck shoal on her way to Dunkirk, each ship receiving a portion of the salvage money. Sussex remained in France, and was used by the Marine Nationale at Le Havre. =Post-World War I= Sussex was repaired in France post-war, and in 1920 was sold to D Demetriades, Piraeus, being renamed Aghia Sophia.

He is a member of the Greater Flint Area Sports Hall of Fame, the Greater Flint Afro-American Hall of Fame, and the College Football Hall of Fame. Williams served three years on the Cincinnati City Council. Early life Williams was born on September 19, 1954 in Flint, Michigan. The son of Elijah and Julia Williams, he overcame a hearing disability as a child. Williams was a star athlete and student at Flint Southwestern High School. He played competitive football and also wrestled. As a junior, he played linebacker, but switched to fullback his senior year. The recipient of an academic scholarship, Williams was a three-time All-Ivy League linebacker in football and Ivy League heavyweight wrestling champion in 1975 at Dartmouth College, graduating in 1976 with a B.A. in psychology. He also took courses there in tai chi and ballet. NFL career In 1976, Williams was drafted in the third round by the Cincinnati Bengals, for whom he played 14 seasons, (including two Super Bowls, XVI (1981) and XXIII (1988)). Williams recorded 16 interceptions and 23 fumble recoveries, still a franchise record. During his career Williams amassed 62.5 sacks, the second most in the team's history. In his final two seasons with Cincinnati, he was appointed to an open seat on the Cincinnati City Council in 1988 and was elected for a second term in 1989 on the Charter Party ticket. Williams has received numerous honors, including selection to the NFL All-Rookie Team (1976), the Byron \\"Whizzer\\" White Award for Humanitarian Service (1985), and the NFL Walter Payton Man of the Year Award (1986). He was also named Co-Sportsman of the Year in 1987 by Sports Illustrated. Post-NFL life After retiring from the NFL, Williams joined the World League of American Football as the Vice President/General Manager of the New York/New Jersey Knights. He later rejoined the NFL, where he conceived and opened the NFL's first Youth Education Town (YET) in Los Angeles. Williams was hired as director of sports development for Disney on April 19, 1993. In the mid-1990s, he oversaw the creation of Disney's Wide World of Sports Complex, a state-of-the-art multi-sport facility that opened on March 28, 1997 and hosts more than 180 athletic events annually in some 30 sports. By 1998, he had become Vice President of Disney Sports Attractions, where he oversaw a newly created sports and recreation division that merged Walt Disney World Resort Recreation, Water Parks, and Disney Sports Attractions. The latter included Disney's Wide World of Sports Complex, the Walt Disney World Speedway, and Walt Disney World Golf. Williams retired from Disney in November 2007, stepping down to focus on rehabilitating his legs from damage sustained during his playing NFL career. Although he was a starter for 14 seasons, Williams played most of his career on a bad right knee. He has had 24 knee surgeries since his career ended. He had the first surgery in 1979, plus knee replacements as well as multiple infections. In 2008, when he was diagnosed with the bone infection osteomylitis, he had eight surgeries in five months. His right leg is now 2 5/8 inches shorter than his left one, and he has struggled to avoid having it amputated. Williams uses cannabis to treat the pain and inflammation present in his knee, which he says has allowed him to walk without crutches again. In December 2007 Williams was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame. He received an honorary Doctor of Laws from Dartmouth College in 1990 and is a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. Williams now lives in Sarasota, Florida.

Williams was born in Winchester in 1780. He was the son of the Rev. Philip Williams of Winchester. On 24 April 1798 he matriculated at New College, Oxford, of which he was also a Fellow until 1818. He was awarded his BCL in 1805 and his DCL in 1825. In 1824 he was appointed Vinerian Professor of English Law, which he remained until his death in 1843. At this period Oxford University was in a prolonged decline: the demands on the post were few, and there are no records of Williams' work. In 1806 he was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn, where he became a KC and a bencher in 1831. He also served as Recorder of Winchester. He married Jane Blachford; her grandfather was Sir Fitzwilliam Barrington, 8th Baronet. His daughter Sarah Jane Williams married her second cousin Charles Simeon, who also had Sir Fitzwilliam Barrington, 10th Baronet as his grandfather. Simeon was later a member of the Canterbury Association. For some years, she lived with her husband in Christchurch, New Zealand.

Samuelson and William D. Nordhaus (2004). Economics, 18th ed., [end] Glossary of Terms, \\"Distribution.\\" In general theory and the national income and product accounts, each unit of output corresponds to a unit of income. One use of national accounts is for classifying factor incomes and measuring their respective shares, as in national Income. But, where focus is on income of persons or households, adjustments to the national accounts or other data sources are frequently used. Here, interest is often on the fraction of income going to the top (or bottom) x percent of households, the next x percent, and so forth (defined by equally spaced cut points, say quintiles), and on the factors that might affect them (globalization, tax policy, technology, etc.). Descriptive, theoretical, scientific, and welfare uses Income distribution can describe a prospectively observable element of an economy. It has been used as an input for testing theories explaining the distribution of income, for example human capital theory and the theory of economic discrimination (Becker, 1993, 1971). In welfare economics, a level of feasible output possibilities is commonly distinguished from the distribution of income for those output possibilities. But in the formal theory of social welfare, rules for selection from feasible distributions of income and output are a way of representing normative economics at a high level of generality. Neoclassical distribution theory In neoclassical economics, the supply and demand of each factor of production interact in factor markets to determine equilibrium output, income, and the income distribution. Factor demand in turn incorporates the marginal- productivity relationship of that factor in the output market.John Bates Clark (1902). The Distribution of Wealth.

Wicksteed (1914). “The Scope and Method of Political Economy in the Light of the ‘Marginal’ Theory of Value and Distribution,\\" Economic Journal, 24(94), pp. 1–23.George J. Stigler (1941).

Chapter-preview links.C.E. Ferguson (1969). The Neoclassical Theory of Production and Distribution. Cambridge. Description & review excerpt. Analysis applies to not only capital and land but the distribution of income in labor markets.J.R. Hicks (1932, 2nd ed., 1963). The Theory of Wages. London: Macmillan. The neoclassical growth model provides an account of how the distribution of income between capital and labor is determined in competitive markets at the macroeconomic level over time with technological change and changes in the size of the capital stock and labor force.F.H. Hahn (2008). \\"neoclassical growth theory,\\" The New Palgrave: A Dictionary of Economics. Abstract. More recent developments of the distinction between human capital and physical capital and between social capital and personal capital have deepened analysis of distribution. Statistics Vilfredo Pareto proposed the distribution of income can be described by a power-law: this is now called the Pareto distribution.

He was the predecessor to Timothy Richard as head of this society. Missionary experiences Williamson was born in Falkirk, Scotland. He was the eldest of seven sons. As a young man he worked at a large mercantile establishment. After this work he attended Glasgow University with the aim of going to China as a missionary. He completed his arts and theological studies, and offered himself to, and was accepted by, the London Missionary Society for the mission field in China.Aird (1894), 393-394 For seven years he worked in evangelism, Chinese literary studies, and traveling.

In 1863 Williamson returned to China with the National Bible Society of Scotland as its first agent there. He started at Yantai in Shandong Province and then traveled extensively distributing copies of the Bible in Chinese. During this period he visited Beijing, Mongolia, and Manchuria. In 1867, Alexander Williamson, who had given Robert Jermain Thomas Bibles to take to Korea, journeyed to northeastern China to the border with Korea. There at “Korea Gate,” Williamson sold Christian books to Korean border merchants. In August 1869, his younger brother and fellow missionary, James Williamson also of the London Missionary Society, was murdered near Tianjin. That same year, Alexander returned to Britain. In 1871, Williamson was awarded a Doctorate of Law by the University of Glasgow for his writings about China. Between 1871 and 1883 he was back at Yantai with the NBSS and in 1874 also with the Scottish United Presbyterian Mission. In 1883 he had to return to Scotland for health reasons.

The first actual library building was established on East Hastings Street in 1935. In 1954, a municipal bylaw was enacted to officially establish the Burnaby Public Library. After merging with the North Burnaby Library Association in 1957, BPL's first permanent library building, the McGill Branch, was built in North Burnaby in 1961. The branch was named after Grace McGill, a volunteer with the North Burnaby Library Association since its 1927 inception. The Kingsway branch was established in 1962 followed by the Central Park branch in 1974 and the Cameron branch in 1980. In 1991, the Central Park branch was replaced by the Bob Prittie Metrotown branch, BPL's current central branch.

Overview  The payment card industry consists of all the organizations which store, process and transmit cardholder data, most notably for debit cards and credit cards. The security standards are developed by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council which develops the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards used throughout the industry. Individual card brands establish compliance requirements that are used by service providers and have their own compliance programs. Major card brands include American Express, China UnionPay, Discover Financial Services, Japan Credit Bureau, MasterCard Worldwide and Visa International. Most companies use member banks that connect and accept transactions from the card brands. Not all card brands use member banks, like American Express, these instead act as their own bank. , the United States uses a magnetic stripe on a card to process transactions and its security relies on the holder's signature and visual inspection of the card to check for features such as hologram. This system will be outmoded and replaced by EMV in 2015. EMV is a global standard for inter-operation of integrated circuit cards (IC cards or \\"chip cards\\") and IC card capable point of sale (POS) terminals and automated teller machines (ATMs), for authenticating credit and debit card transactions. It has enhanced security features, but is still susceptible to fraud.  Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council  On 7 September 2006, American Express, Discover Financial Services, Japan Credit Bureau, MasterCard Worldwide and Visa International formed the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) security council with the goal of managing the ongoing evolution of the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard. The council itself claims to be independent of the various card vendors that make up the council. As of 1 August 2014, the PCI SSC website lists 688 \\"Participating Organizations\\". Internationally, 61 different financial institutions were noted, including Bank of America, Capital One, JP Morgan Chase, Royal Bank of Scotland, TD Bank and Wells Fargo. A total of 275 merchants were listed, including Amazon.com, Burger King, Citgo, Dell, Equifax, Exxon Mobil, Global Cash Access, Motorola, Microsoft, Southwest Airlines and Walmart.  Industry growth  MasterCard's Nicole Krieg has noted that the Russian credit card market started in early 2000, when issuers first began launching products. However, credit products became especially popular in Russia in 2005, after new legislation took effect. Immense growth was noted in just eight years, by comparing second quarter growth on Visa card purchases, which went from $306 million in 2002 to $61.5 billion in 2010. Merchants who accepted Visa cards also increased from 21,000 to 331,000 during the same period. Visa also noted that they had issued 70 million cards and the Central Bank of the Russian Federation reported that 8.6 million credit cards were on issue.

It is best known as the site of an ancient Bhagavathy temple, Pattazhy Devi Temple. Pattazy is a part of Pathanapuram Block Panchayat andruled by pattazhy panjayath Kollam district Panchayat. Etymology The name Pattazhy has an uncertain etymology. Pattazhy may stem from an imperfect Malayalam portmanteau fusing Patt (\\"Soft\\") and Aazhy (\\"Ocean\\"). Thus the word Pattazhy represents the compassion and affection of Pattazhy Devi to her beloved devotees and depth of her grace. The name Pattazhy may have also derived from the word Bhattarika which means a virtuous and pious woman. Culture Pattazhy is a temple village situated in Pathanapuram Taluk of Kollam District in Kerala. The land of Pattazhy comprising two panchayat areas (Pattazhy and Pattazhy vadakekara) was given as a gift to Pattazhy Devi by the King of Travancore for the help and shelter given in the fierce fight against the king of Kayamkulam. When the king was extending his kingdom by winning war with the neighboring kingdoms with the help of Ramayyan Dalawa, Kambithan, a hardcore worshipper of Pattazhy Devi helped the king to take over Kayamkulam Kingdom. As a symbol of his gratitude the king ordered to let Pattazhy be named and dedicated to Devi by issuing a royal order. The annual festival at Pattazhy Devi Temple is one of the famous temple festivals in central Travancore. The Kumbhathiruvathira and Meenathiruvathira were the famous festivals of Pattazhy. The festival is known for Kambam (fire works), Aalpindi Vilakku Ezhunnallathu (Procession of small structure made out of plantain kernel and germinating leaves of coconut tree with numerous lamps on it), Ponnin Thirumudi (Devi's idol carved out of pure gold and rare precious stones) Ezhunnallathu.

The southern segment, which is long, runs from SR 150 in Dillonvale to SR 151 in Smithfield. The northern segment, which is long, runs from an interchange with U.S. Route 22 (US 22) in Bloomingdale to SR 7 in Empire. Route description Looking west along the SR 43–SR 152 concurrency in Richmond Both segments of SR 152 wholly consist of two-lane roads—one lane in each direction. No part of SR 152 in included in the National Highway System. The southern segment of the route begins in the village of Dillonvale at an intersection with SR 150 (Smithfield Street). Immediately, SR 152 heads northwest to cross Piney Fork. The road then parallels the creek as it exits Dillonvale to enter Smithfield Township. It later exits the Piney Fork valley to ascend to a ridge away from the creek. Through this area, single-family houses line both sides of the road. After following the ridgeline for about , SR 152 descends to a valley formed by the Dry Fork southwest of Smithfield. The road soon enters the Smithfield village limits and it heads northeast through the mostly residential neighborhood on Main Street. After descending another hill, this segment of SR 152 ends at an intersection with SR 151 on the north side of the village. The northern segment starts at its southern end at a diamond interchange with US 22 partially in the village Bloomingdale and Wayne Township. South of the interchange, Steubenville Street, the former alignment of US 22 as evidenced by its county road number, Jefferson County Road 22A (CR 22A). SR 152 heads northeast through rolling terrain with few houses and some agricultural businesses. At the next intersection with CR 22A, SR 152 turns off the through road and descends on a winding road to cross Cross Creek and a Columbus and Ohio River Railroad. The road ascends to a ridge line (Quaker Ridge) on a winding road that heads through a mix of forest, open space, and small houses. The road enters Salem Township, treks to the north-northwest, and has an intersection with SR 646\\\\. North of this intersection, SR 152 begins to curve to the northeast and enters the village of Richmond on Walnut Street. At the top of a hill, SR 152 reaches Main Street which also carries SR 43\\\\. The two highways form a concurrency and travel together southeast ascending a hill. After two blocks, SR 152 turns onto Lisbon Street to continue climbing a hill out of the village. SR 152 exits the Richmond to continue northeast through Salem Township, Island Creek Township (where it passes the Edison High School campus), and Knox Township. This portion of the road features few homes lining the road, mostly a mix of open space (including some farmland) and forest. At a former strip mine, the road begins to curve to the east and has a concurrency with SR 213\\\\. The easternmost intersection with SR 213 is in the unincorporated community of Knoxville where a small cluster of homes and a fire station are present. SR 152 heads northeast through the community of Sugar Grove where there are some homes that line the road. At an intersection with CR 68 adjacent to a Methodist church's cemetery, SR 152 curves to the east and begins a long descent into the village of Empire. About halfway downhill, the road begins to parallel Jeremy Run. At the bottom of the slope, the road, which is known as Stewart Street in Empire, crosses a Norfolk Southern railroad and travels for one block through a residential neighborhood. After the one block, the road reaches an interchange with SR 7\\\\. This interchange incorporates local roads to facilitate some movements to and from SR 7\\\\. SR 152 officially ends at the top of the northbound entrance ramp to SR 7, about from the Ohio River. History The northern segment of SR 152 from Bloomingdale to Empire was first designated in 1923. However, a highway numbered SR 378 followed a similar alignment from 1916 to 1923. The modern-day southern segment of SR 152 from Dillonvale and Smithfield was designated SR 333 by 1932. By 1937, SR 152 was extended south to Smithfield and by 1938, SR 152 took over the entire alignment of SR 333 and traveled continuously from Dillonvale to Empire. Between 1942 and 1944, the segment between Smithfield and US 22, which was a gravel and earth-surfaced road, was removed from the State Highway System. With the exception of a extension of the northern segment towards Bloomingdale when the US 22 freeway opened between 1969 and 1971, the two segments of SR 152 have remained unchanged since.

In September 2009 the charity wound down. The website was discontinued soon after. Overview Intelligent Giving aimed to raise public interest in charitable giving and advised donors how to make the most satisfactory use of their money. It was one of several organisations, including New Philanthropy Capital (UK) and Charity Navigator (US), that formed for this purpose, and it operated in a relatively new sector in the not-for-profit arena. It sought to bring its findings to as wide a readership as possible, employing a casual, witty approach on its website. The authors aligned themselves with donors, not with the charity fundraising community. The organisation was a company limited by guarantee and itself gained charitable status in 2008. Services and work The central feature of Intelligent Giving's website was a charity ratings service. In 2005–06, it researched and rated over 500 UK charities and listed a further 1,000. Although it clearly acknowledged that quality of work is the most important way to judge a charity, it held transparency as an important indicator of a charity’s diligence, and said that this was the most important aspect—and a cross-sector comparable one—of a charity's annual report. Media coverage In March 2007, Intelligent Giving claimed that English Premiership football clubs were not giving enough to charity. Chelsea FC was particularly criticized in this work, and an alleged member of the Club's media team threatened an Intelligent Giving employee with violence in response to media reports. In June 2007, the organisation analysed the Jewish charities it had profiled and concluded, \\"They are pretty appalling in terms of transparency.\\" Details from the report were published in The Jewish Chronicle. In July 2007, Intelligent Giving won the New Statesman New Media Award for Information & Openness. October 2007 saw Intelligent Giving name and shame in The Guardian the rugby union charity Wooden Spoon Society for providing a very low return on its fundraising activities. Intelligent Giving's argument was rejected by John Inverdale, a BBC broadcaster, in an opinion piece in The Daily Telegraph as \\"misguided reporting that fails to understand how fund-raising operates.\\" It was also condemned by Wooden Spoon in a statement. Voluntary sector response Steve Taylor of Sue Ryder Care, who decried the organisation as a 'self appointed guardian' with 'little demonstrable understanding of the operating framework' of charities; the Institute of Fundraising, which called its research methods 'rudimentary'; and Sir Terry Wogan (a trustee of Children in Need) who condemned its work as 'contemptible'. Intelligent Giving said that its approach was significantly more nuanced than that of other charity- profiling services, such as Charity Navigator in the US.

He performed weekly gigs in the Omaha area both solo and with ensembles such as Luigi, Inc. He served the Omaha music community for over 60 years. He toured Europe twice and performed with jazz legends such as Sarah Vaughan, Ella Fitzgerald and Dinah Washington. Luigi, Inc has shared the stage with Jean-Luc Ponty, James Brown and Dizzy Gillespie. Biography Luigi Waites was born Lewis Waites on July 10, 1927 in Omaha, Nebraska to Ione Kelley and Sylvester Waites. Waites began playing drums at age twelve, and soon after began playing local nightclubs around Omaha. At the time the two local musicians unions were segregated. During his high school years, Waites regularly played in bars and clubs which sometimes affected his ability to get enough sleep on school nights. He might perform as a professional musician until the wee hours and then jump into a taxicab standing by in front of his mother's house to rush him to class at Central High School the next morning. This, to the chagrin of some of his instructors, since on a teacher's salary in that day most schoolteachers could not afford to take a cab to work each day. While Waites served in the U.S. Army during World War II at Camp Lee, Virginia, he met jazz drummer Elvin Jones. Luigi married Eva Jean Little in 1950 and beget six children. In 1960, Waites founded The Contemporaries, a multicultural, independent drum corps that featured jazz rhythms, lyres and modern dance steps. Then, during the 1970s, Luigi Waites was a solo artist in The National School Tours program where he performed in classrooms and school assemblies. When leading his band, Luigi Inc, he performed on vibraharp rather than drums. Luigi Inc is a 5 piece jazz combo located in Omaha, Nebraska. Founded by Luigi Waites, Luigi Inc (short for including, not incorporated) has the distinct honor of maintaining one of the longest running gigs in the country. He appeared with the group over 1,700 consecutive Sunday nights in Omaha at the bar, Mr. Toad, beginning in 1978. During the 2000s, Waites collaborated with pop band Shelter Belt As a drummer, Luigi Waites was influenced by Buddy Rich, Joe Jones, Louie Bellson and Max Roach. Waites died at 4 a.m. on April 6, 2010 at Immanuel Medical Center in Omaha, Nebraska of natural causes. He was 82 years old.
