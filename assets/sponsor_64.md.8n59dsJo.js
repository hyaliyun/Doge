The book was adapted for a film the following year. Plot Graham Weir is a middle-aged schoolteacher at Railway Street Secondary School. A timid self-loathing alcoholic, he is taunted and despised by his pupils, his colleagues and his wife. Recognizing a like-minded soul in one of his pupils he takes her under his wing and offers to give her extra tuition. Before long the girl claims to have fallen in love with him and attempts to lead him into an affair. Surprised, Weir fends off her unwelcome advances as gently as possible and disengages himself from her. However, following an accusation by the pupil, he is later charged with indecent assault and is forced to defend himself in court, not only from the criminal charge itself but also from the derision and lack of empathy that surrounds him.http://lostbooklibrary.blogspot.co.uk/2012/02/term-of-trial.html Film adaptation Term of Trial is the film adaptation, released in 1962, directed by Peter Glenville and starring Laurence Olivier, Simone Signoret, Sarah Miles and Terence Stamp.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0056568/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1 References Category:1961 British novels Category:Social realism Category:British novels adapted into films Category:Hamish Hamilton books ","title":"Term of Trial (novel)"},{"id":"42402094","text":"Percy Hattersley-Smith (19 May 1847 - 19 January 1918) was an English cricketer.

Life  Kornauth was born in Olm√ºtz, Moravia. A cellist and pianist from his youth, he went in 1909 to Vienna, where he studied with Robert Fuchs, Guido Adler, Franz Schreker (with whom he quarrelled) and Franz Schmidt.Gruber (n.d.) After teaching music theory at Vienna University from 1919, Kornauth embarked on an international career as pianist, accompanist and conductor that took him to Indonesia (1926-9) and to South America (1934-5). In 1940 he resumed a teaching career in war-time Vienna and Salzburg. He joined the Nazi-sponsored Reichsmusikkammer, but continued to support his teacher Adler, who was held under house arrest as a Jew, until the latter's death in 1941.Powell (2013), 3-4. In post-war Austria, Kornauth became director of the Salzburg Mozarteum (1946-7), and was elected to the Austrian Arts Senate in 1954. He died in Vienna in 1959. Kornauth composed extensively and won a number of prizes including the Austrian State Prize (1913) (for his Viola Sonata op.3), the Gustav Mahler Foundation prize (1919), and the Austrian W√ºrdigungspreis (1951). His style was however conventional; when the English composer Humphrey Searle visited Vienna in the 1930s he was displeased to find that the only modern music played by the main orchestras was that of Schmidt \\"or lesser composers like ... Kornauth.\\"Cited in Powell (2013), 3. Kornauth himself recognised in his 1958 autobiography that \\"epigonism was inherent in my personality.\\" Most of Kornauth's output consists of lieder, chamber music and piano pieces, but there are also five orchestral suites amongst other larger scale pieces.Powell (2013), 3.

This dish is commonly popular in Java island, but can trace its origin to Sundanese cuisine of West Java, Indonesia. Ingredients The beef preferably used in this dish is shank part. First the beef is boiled until medium well, then being cut quite thick along the muscle fiber into half-palm size. Then using stone pestle and mortar, the beef pieces are beaten mildly to loosen the meat fibers and spread its size a little bit. The spices used in this dish are ground shallot, garlic, chili pepper, coriander, palm sugar and salt, mixed with bruised lemongrass, galangal, daun salam (Indonesian bay leaf), a little coconut milk and turmeric water. The meat pieces are cooked with the spices well until the spice are absorbed into the meat and the stock evaporate. Then the meat pieces are fried in coconut oil until the color darken and the meat is done. Empal gepuk is sprinkled with bawang goreng (fried shallot) and served with steamed rice.

ATF officials stated that the strategy pre-emptively targeted people likely to commit serious crime rather than waiting for them to do so; opponents and critics, and later, judges, expressed concerns that it was tantamount to entrapment and punishing people for thoughts and possibilities rather than actual criminal acts, by presenting them with deliberately hard to resist fabricated inducements and goading them to become a participant, or to engage in more extreme criminal activities, up to an extent chosen almost completely by ATF. In 2013 Illinois Chief Federal Judge Ruben Castillo expressed significant concerns over one such case (Brown et al). In 2014 California judge Otis Wright went further and dismissed another such case (Hudson) as \\"outrageous\\" government conduct and \\"unconstitutional\\", stating that it had neither prevented nor detected crime, but cost the taxpayer dearly, and that the overwhelming extent of ATF direction of the purported crime, and the level of ATF involvement, made the ATF operative more of a participant rather than an observer, the sentence a reflection of ATF whim rather than defendant's own conduct, and the case into one that lacked due process.U.S.A. vs. Hudson, Whitfield and Dunlap ruling, case 2:13-cr-00126-ODW-3, dated 2014-03-10  Accusation of racial bias  In legal proceedings filed in Chicago a team of attorneys sought dismissal of charges against 40 defendants. One study that was unsealed had concluded that the ATF showed racial bias in target selection for the sting operations. The study concluded that the disparity between white and black defendants was so large that the chances of it being explained by any reason other than racial bias was around zero.  U.S. v. Hudson, Whitfield & Dunlap (decided 2014)  The case was one of many US Government cases where a situation was presented to members of the public, who were tempted into committing a crime related to drugs, theft, or firearms, on the basis of a fabricated situation \\"sting operation\\". In this case, the judge Otis D. Wright II dismissed citing \\"outrageous\\" behavior. He found that by fabricating every aspect of the supposed circumstances in a manner calculated to entice the subjects' involvement, the government acted \\"repugnant[ly] to the Constitution\\" by creating a crime \\"cut from whole cloth\\" that was intended not to fail to entice involvement, and was not related to any actual or existent criminal enterprise, but was calculated to produce a sentence of around 15 years.  US entrapment case law  * In Jacobson v. United States () the Supreme Court considered an entrapment case from outside drug enforcement, and overturned the conviction of a Nebraska man for ordering child pornography after two years of being cajoled by material created by postal inspectors. Held: the government must show that predisposition existed before the government became involved, and prior behavior when activity was legal does not constitute evidence of predisposition to break the law if the conduct is subsequently made illegal. (Contrast Hampton v. United States, where predisposition did exist, even though the drugs and drug related activity of the defendant in that case wholly coincided with the encouragement of law enforcement agents.)

It is inscribed with two rows of symbols, which some have indicated resemble ancient Runic characters. The stone was stolen in 2012. On April 26, 2013, the Rhode Island Attorney General announced that the rock was recovered after an individual came forward with information. The rock was moved to the University of Rhode Island School of Oceanography for testing, but the tests were not carried out because it would have required damaging the stone. In January 2014, plans were announced to move the runestone to Goddard Memorial State Park in East Greenwich. In October 2015, the runestone was placed for long-term public viewing in Wickford, a village of North Kingstown Rhode Island. Provenance The Narragansett runestone was first reported to the Rhode Island Historical Preservation and Heritage Commission (HPHC) in the 1980s. The New England Antiquities Research Association (NEARA) ran several studies and published a number of papers in the 1980s and 1990s about the rock. According to NEARA, the stone was discovered by a quahogger in December 1984 while digging in the mud flats of Narragansett Bay. The HPHC was unable to find any information about the stone in any previous inventories of Narragansett Bay. They found that as early as 1939, the runestone was located upland and may have been buried. Recently, the inscriptions on the stone were visible only for a short period of time between the shifting tides, due to dramatic erosion of the shoreline at Pojac Point and the fact that the stone was positioned 20 feet from the extreme low tide line mark. In 2014, Everett Brown of Providence reported that he and his brother Warren had carved the runes on Quidnessett Rock in summer 1964. He said that he had forgotten about the incident until the stone was removed and recovered in 2013. His account has been disputed by other local people, who state that they saw the stone before 1964, and have challenged other elements of his statements. Media The stone is referenced in episode 11 of season 1 of America Unearthed. Disappearance and recovery The state Coastal Resources Management Council reported that the runestone had been removed from the tidal waters off Pojac Point between July and August 2012. In May 2013, the state Attorney General‚Äôs Environmental Unit and DEM‚Äôs Criminal Investigation Unit announced that they had recovered the stone. Town historian and independent columnist G. Timothy Cranston said that a Pojac Point resident had removed the stone, as he was tired of having tourists scouring the neighborhood and shoreline looking for the stone.

Miller and written by Andre Fabrizio and Jeremy Passmore. The film stars Thomas Jane, Bruce Willis and Ambyr Childers. The plot follows Julian Michaels (Willis), who has opened a resort with questionable ethics, where people can act out their fiercest fantasies with the resort's androids. When one of the androids, Kelly (Childers), becomes sentient and escapes, she joins forces with police detective Roy Tedeschi (Jane) to bring Michaels down and destroy his resort.  Plot  A futuristic resort, Vice, offers visitors the opportunity to live out all their fantasies, no matter how violent or deviant, on sophisticated androids (referred to as \\"artificials\\"). Every day, the androids' memories are reset, and any damage sustained is scheduled for repair. To maintain the illusion that the androids are real, they are programmed to have behavioral responses such as emotions and believe themselves to be human. Kelly, a gynoid bartender, believes herself to be on the last day of her job. After meeting Evan, a friendly visitor who encourages her to follow her dreams, she and her friend Melissa, also a gynoid, are brutally killed by a different visitor. At the same time, Detective Roy Tedeschi arrests a rapist at the resort as he sexually assaults one of the androids. Tedeschi's captain orders him to stay away from Vice and only arrest its patrons after they leave, as Vice provides massive tax revenue for the city. Tedeschi believes that visitors to Vice become desensitized to violence and rape, pointing to the man he arrested as proof, and suspects that his department is taking bribes from the resort. As Tedeschi storms out, he vows to stop Vice. Vice CEO Julian Michaels orders Kelly immediately reactivated, as important clients are scheduled to arrive soon. Soon after, she experiences random flashbacks, and she is recalled. An engineer explains that her memories can not truly be deleted, only made inaccessible. To stop her from having flashbacks, he must first bring all her memories to the forefront. Alarmed by the trauma of reliving all her deaths and sexual assaults, Kelly breaks free of her restraints before her memories can be reset. Security forces chase her through the resort, but she escapes into the outside city. There, she learns the truth about Vice and herself. Michaels orders a security team, lead by Chris, to quietly reacquire her through any means necessary. Michaels plans to expand the use of androids to military and commercial use once they have become more socially acceptable. Believing a loose android could jeopardize this, he covers up the escape and blames the resort's brief shutdown on a terrorist attack. Tedeschi becomes suspicious and angers his captain when he confronts Michaels. Ordered again to stay away from Vice, Tedeschi is assigned to a series of homicides apparently performed by a professional mercenary. Unknown to Tedeschi or his captain, this is Chris' work as he attempts to recapture Kelly and kills anyone who gets in his way. After evading Chris, Kelly visits an abandoned church she has seen in her dreams. There, she meets Evan again, who reveals himself as her creator. Evan created her in the image of his dead wife so he could spend more time with her. Michaels bought out his company. When Evan learned of Michaels' plans, he left but lost control of his research. Evan promises to help Kelly, but before they can leave, Tedeschi arrives, having realized that fingerprints left at a crime scene belong to Evan's dead wife. As Tedeschi attempts to arrest Evan, Kelly knocks him unconscious. Vice's security also track Kelly to the church; Evan and Kelly escape as Tedeschi and the security team open fire on each other. Evan's friend James, a computer hacker, gives them new identities and passage out of the city. En route, Evan dies while protecting Kelly from more of Vice's thugs. Kelly takes up Tedeschi's offer to stay and shut down Vice. Returning to James, he gives them a virus that will shut down Vice and upgrades Kelly to give her advanced combat skills. After a makeover, Tedeschi and Kelly infiltrate Vice posing as a married couple. Kelly tracks down Michaels but fail-safe programming prevents her from harming him. However, after Kelly is captured, Tedeschi forces a tech to load the virus. All of Vice's androids have their memories restored, and they start a rebellion, killing the visitors who previously brutalized them. Kelly then reveals that, despite wanting to kill Michaels, she is actually a decoy to distract Michaels and his guards for Tedeschi, and she is already aware of the fail-safe programming. Ignoring Kelly's taunting, Michaels begins a gunfight with Tedeschi which kills Chris. Kelly then frees herself and hands Chris' pistol to Tedeschi, who then uses it to kill Michaels. As Kelly and Melissa embrace outside the resort as the chaos continues, Michaels' eyes suddenly open.

A former Masonic temple, The Temple Downtown, was used for exterior shots of Evan's abandoned church home. Exterior shots representing the futuristic city are of and around Miami's downtown in South Florida.  Release  Vice was released on DVD and Blu-ray on March 17, 2015. It grossed $1.3 million in US sales.  Reception  The film has a 4% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 27 reviews; the average rating is 2.4/10. It also has a Metacritic score of 17 out of 100 based on 14 reviews. Justin Chang of Variety called it a \\"relentlessly mediocre\\" film that \\"barely engages with its potential ideas beyond the most blandly expository, bullet-ridden level\\". Chang said Willis' against-type casting could have been fun, but Willis instead seems bored. Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times wrote that the film \\"has absolutely nothing to recommend it\\", and Robert Abele of the Los Angeles Times called it \\"dystopian sci-fi for dummies\\". In giving it a C rating, Ignatiy Vishnevetsky of The A.V. Club described it as \\"crummy and artless in a way that's intrinsically watchable\\". Vishnevetsky wrote that although Jane's acting is not believable, it is fun to watch the bizarre mannerisms, comparing it to Gary Busey's off-kilter performances.

Biography  After primary preliminary studies in Ano Syros and the School of the Franciscans in Naxos, Marangos, at the suggestion of the Roman Catholic Bishop of Syros Aloisiou Vlaga, he departed for Rome to prepare the priestly vocation. In 1856 he was ordained a priest and returned to Syros. Due to lack of priests he was called to Patras where there served the Catholic community in the Parish Church of Saint Andrew. In 1856, at the age of 33, Marangos was elected assistant bishop of Tinos and Mykonos next to Bishop Francis Zaloni. With Zaloni's death in 1866, Pope Pius IX named him Bishop of Tinos-Mykonos. Besides the great efforts he raised the intellectual and cultural level of the congregation at that time, that numbered 6,000 faithful, made completions in the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Rosary of Xynaras, built a new Hall Episcopal Seminary and founded the church administration. Beside these facts, he organized the Archives of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Naxos, Andros, Tinos and Mykonos, which is among the East's richest archives. Marangos took part in the First Vatican Council, where, because of his high theological training, he was elected Rapporteur of the Commission on Dogma. On 10 August 1874, King George I of Greece by royal decree recognized Marangos as being entrusted with the episcopal functions in those parts of the Kingdom in which no other Western Church Bishops had.[œâœÇ ŒµœÄŒπœÜŒøœÅœÑŒπœÉŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒøŒΩ ŒºŒµ œÑŒ± ŒµœÄŒπœÉŒ∫ŒøœÄŒπŒ∫Œ¨ Œ∫Œ±Œ∏ŒÆŒ∫ŒøŒΩœÑŒ± ŒµŒπœÇ ŒµŒ∫ŒµŒØŒΩŒ± œÑŒ± ŒºŒ≠œÅŒ∑ œÑŒøœÖ ŒíŒ±œÉŒπŒªŒµŒØŒøœÖ ŒµŒπœÇ œÑŒ± ŒøœÄŒøŒØŒ± Œ¥ŒµŒΩ œÖœÄŒ¨œÅœáŒøœÖœÉŒπŒΩ Œ¨ŒªŒªŒøŒπ œÑŒ∑œÇ Œ±œÖœÑŒÆœÇ ŒîœÖœÑŒπŒ∫ŒÆœÇ ŒïŒ∫Œ∫ŒªŒ∑œÉŒØŒ±œÇ ŒïœÄŒØœÉŒ∫ŒøœÄŒøŒπ] With the reestablishment of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Athens, Pius IX appointed him to it. Marangos helped to support those affected by the earthquakes of Cephalonia and Aigio, as well as helped those in need after the unfortunate Cretan Revolt against the Turks. For this reason he was honored by the Greek State to the distinction of Commander of the Royal Order of the Redeemer. He died aged 58 in Smyrna where he had traveled to participate in the local session. The funeral sequence was in the Cathedral Basilica of St. Dionysius the Areopagite and was attended by the Prime Minister of Greece, ministers, the mayor and the crowd of Catholic and Orthodox faithful.

The company then appointed a new creative director with the hopes of turning things around. Unfortunately, things didn‚Äôt go to plan as the new partner company for Links of London, Folli Follie, was fined ‚Ç¨20 million for overstating its revenue by ‚Ç¨1 billion.

They set up the Immaculate Conception Mission (French: Mission de L‚ÄôImmacul√©e Conception) for the Fort William First Nation. In July 1849 two French Jesuit missionaries, Fr Pierre Chon√© (1808-1879) and Fr Nicolas Fr√©miot (1818-1854) came to the area and started the mission. From there, St. Patrick's Church was one of many churches that was missioned to the First Nations in Northern Ontario, as well as St. Andrew's Church, which was handed over to the diocese in 1997.History from Diocese of Thunder Bay retrieved 4 April 2014 =Construction= St. Patrick's was built in 1892, the same year as Thunder Bay was incorporated as a town. The foundation stone was laid on 10 October 1891,History from StPatricksCathedral.ca retrieved 4 April 2014 and the first Mass was celebrated on 21 August 1892. The Jesuit parish priests made plans for the construction of an elementary school later that decade. In Autumn 1924, the Jesuits handed over administration of the parish to the Diocese of Sault Sainte Marie. =Reconstruction= In 1952, the Diocese of Fort William was created and St. Patrick's became its cathedral. In 1970, the diocese was renamed and it became the Diocese of Thunder Bay. From 1955, plans were drawn up to build a new larger cathedral. Three plots of adjacent land was purchased for a total of $50,000. In September 1962, the old church was demolished. A year later, 15 September 1963, the foundation stone of the new cathedral was laid and a year after that, on 8 September 1964, the first Mass was celebrated.

MGH. Munich, 2002, book VII, 65 that mentions Berestye as ‚Äúurbs‚Äù. Caesar i.e. Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor learnt in 1017 that the Russian prince Yaroslav the Wise had attacked Duke of Poland Boles≈Çaw and he had gained nothing but captured Berestye. As there are no further details in the chronicle, the word ‚Äúurbs‚Äù in Latin could denote a fortified settlement or a sort of fortress. A record of 1182 in the chronicle Chronica seu originale regum et principum Poloniae of the famous Polish chronicler Vincent Kadlubko narrates, that ‚ÄúQui Russiam ingressus primam Brestensium urbem aggreditur; tam viris, quam arte ac loci situ munitissimam obsidionum undique arctat angustiis‚Äù.Chronica seu originale regum et principum Poloniae book IV, chapter 14 Here the chronicler narrates, that Brest was the first to be attacked by Casimir II the Just, who raided into the lands of Rus, Brest offered defiance when it was besieged. The chronicler describes Brest as a most protected place by people, art of fortification and location, implying its protection by rivers and their several branches, however, the word ‚Äúurbs‚Äù in Latin gives no answer, what was besieged: a fortified town or just a sort of fortress. In a document of 1099, written in the Old East Slavic, Berestye is mentioned as ‚Äúgrad‚Äù i.e. gord for the first time. There is a record in the Russian Primary Chronicle dating back to 1276 that narrates about the construction of a ‚Äúgrad‚Äù and a tower by Vladimir Vasilkovich. The tower was similar to the Tower of Kamyanyets according to the chronicle. Probably, it was a keep like the Tower of Kamyanyets, dominating over the castle, yet little evidence remains as the tower was razed when the Brest Fortress was built in the 19th century.  Urban castle  In 1390, by the royal charter W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço, acting as a Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland, granted Magdeburg rights to the city. The charter mentioned the position of Castellan. If there was a castellan before 1390, one can admit, there was a castle in Brest earlier. Nevertheless, after 1390, becoming an urban castle, it was not only a site, fortified with military buildings, but a centre of administration, a symbol of power. It was important centre, controlling population and their various activities, traffic along three major trade routes meeting in Brest.Lawrowska, Irena ‚ÄûAnalysis Of the Territorial Layout Of Brest-Litovsk (XIV-XVI Century)‚Äù, DPNH, Wroc≈Çaw, 2012 ISSN 0860-2395, In 1554, Brest was granted urban coat of arms, showing the castle at the confluence of two rivers.

It lies in the Burren, a region in the northwest of the county. It contains many antiquities, including three early-medieval Christian churches, ruined castles, prehistoric cairns and ring forts and two Martello Towers built in the early 19th century. Geography =Location= The parish is in the extreme north of the Barony of Burren, and the county of Clare. The parish is and covers . The parish holds Lough Murree, a lake of . It has two headlands that extend into Galway Bay, Aughinish Point and Finavarra Point. =Description= The land is mostly low-lying, rising to Abbey Hill in the east at above sea level, although large parts of Abbey Hill are actually located in neighbouring Abbey parish which completely surrounds the Oughtmama parish townland of Behagh. Oughtmama parish also includes part of Turlough Hill and Slieve Carran, the latter rising to over 1,000 feet above sea level. The parish is not continuous, but consists of several exclaves such as Behagh. It borders on County Galway in several places. It contains the villages of Aughinish and Finavarra. The population in 1841 was 2,075 in 325 houses. In the townland of Newquay stands Mount Vernon Lodge, formerly held in fee by the Skerett family, then owned by the parents of Hugh Lane and later the summer home of Lady Augusta Gregory. Name The name of the parish, ucht m√°ma, means \\"breast of a yoke\\", i.e. the upper front of a mountain pass. The parish takes its name from the townland of Oughtmama in the east, and describes the situation of that townland on one of the hills that surround the Corcomroe valley. Antiquities The two larger early medieval Oughtmama churches The smallest of the three early medieval Oughtmama churches Public info sign at the Oughtmama churches showing the likely appearance of the monastic enclosure =Early medieval monastic site= There are three churches in the Oughtmama townland, two of them are well preserved, lying together in a straight line. The third is a ruin about away. The three churches are a National Monument of Ireland. Although they have not been dated precisely, as there have been no excavations at the site, the churches are thought to be part of an early medieval monastic site and to have been altered several times over a period of 400 or 500 years. The site included a double enclosure of limestone walls, domestic buildings and gardens, a mill race with water mill a leacht (a stone slab likely used as an outdoor altar) and a holy well (see below). The two larger churches are located within the inner enclosure, whilst the third lies between inner and outer wall. The western (and largest) is considered the oldest. It was likely built around 1100 as a one-room oratory and enlarged in the 13th century when the other two churches were built. The western church features high quality stonemasonry of the type known as Cyclopean with large, well-cut stones. The central church is also a one-roomed building, featuring a combination of older (possibly removed from the western church) and more recent (i.e. 12th- to 13th-century) features like the doorway. Like the middle church, the eastern one is built on a stone plinth. It is in a much more ruined state than the other two and it is also not aligned with the other two buildings. Its position outside the inner enclosure has led to the theory that it may have served as a place of worship for women, either nuns or lay members of the congregation. Based on old records, the churches may be assumed to have been built to honor three saints, each named Colman, including Colman mac Duagh. The outer enclosure was around 50 to 100 m from the inner wall, both of which are still partially reflected in the shape of current field boundaries. The remains of the domestic buildings lie around 100 m east of the churches. These structures, along with the water mill, terraced garden and a possible midden indicate the presence of a substantial number of people at the settlement's peak. Around 700 m to the northeast of the churches, half way up the slope, lies a holy well dedicated to St. Colman, Tobar Cholm√°in. It reportedly served as a cure for eye sores and is still visited by people for that purpose, as evidenced by votive offerings. The traditional annual day of pilgrimage for this site is 15 November. =Others= There are various cairns and cahers in the parish, mostly ruined. Turlough Hill (also known as Knockycallanan hill) features a cairn on the highest point. It is likely prehistoric but has not been excavated, so it is uncertain whether it served burial purposes. To the east of the cairn are numerous hut circles, located on the same bedrock terrace as the cairn. At least 165 remains of round stone huts have been identified. This assembly is almost without parallel in Ireland. At Mullaghfarna, County Sligo, a collection of 153 huts situated on a limestone terrace contained both Neolithic and early Bronze Age artifacts, but these were washed into the pavement so as to provide limited information allowing to date the structures. Both purpose and dating of the Turlough Hill settlement remain enigmatic. This is also true for another structure, located around 600 m to the northeast and just outside the parish's border. It is a large walled enclosure (225 m diameter), resembling a Bronze Age hill fort. However, this structure does not seem to have been built with fortification in mind. It lacks the typical Bronze Age outer ramparts and the main entrance to the east, following a large fault in the bedrock, shows no defensive structures. It is also much too large to defend effectively. An alternative interpretation is for this to have been an earlier, Neolithic, enclosure. Given its strategic position, overlooking the lands around Kinvara as well as a significant part of the northeastern Burren, it may have been used for occasional gatherings of people from different tribes or groupings, for ceremonial or trade purposes. The department of archaeology of the National University of Ireland, Galway is currently conducting research on the antiquities of Turlough Hill. There are records of a Franciscan abbey called Beagh, which must have stood in the townland of that name, but there are no traces of it, and no tradition. The ruins of Turlough Castle lie on the border of a lough. It is almost level with the ground, as is the castle of Finavarra. Both castles belonged to the O'Loghlen family. The hereditary poets of the O'Loghlens in Finavarra were the O'Daly family. They moved to Galway towards the end of the 15th century. One of their descendants was James Daly, 1st Baron Dunsandle and Clanconal. There are Martello towers on Aughinish Point and Finavarra Point: Finavarra Tower and Aughinish Tower. Located in Finavarra Demesne are the ruins of Finavarra House and its gate lodge. It is described as \\"remains of detached L-plan three-bay two-storey over basement house with dormer attic, built c. 1825.\\" This was the residence of the Skerrett family from the mid-18th to the mid-19th century. In the 1850s, the main part of the estate of the Skerretts was in the parish of Oughtmama and in the nearby parishes of Drumcreehy, including part of the village of Ballyvaughan and Rathborney. They also held land in the parish of Kilfenora. Nearby, an octagonal pillar/monument known as the leacht of Donoughmore O'Daly stands close to the shore. Townlands The townlands are Aghawinnaun, Aughinish, Behagh, Boloona, Coolnatullagh, Cragballyconoal, Deelin Beg, Deelin More, Finavarra Demesne, Gortaclare, Gortboyheen, Kilweelran, Knockycallanan, Newquay, Oughtmama, Poulaphuca, Rine, Scanlan's Island, Slievecarran and Turlough.

Also, concentric, circular ridges and graben outline the Sappho Patera depression at the summit. The volcano is crossed by various rift zones, including the north-south trending Badb Linea rift, the Guor Linea rift extending to the northwest, and the Virtus Linea rift continuing to the southeast. The combination of volcanic- tectonic structures around Irnini Mons supports varying intensities of deformation and a multi-directional stress history. Although classified as a shield volcano, Irnini Mons contains many elements of the Venusian coronae, bringing speculation to its formation. If Irnini Mons was originally a corona, a shallow oval-shaped depression, it would support a thin lithosphere on Venus. On the other hand, it being a shield volcano supports the theory of a thicker lithosphere and Irnini Mons' stress history could be summarized simply as a transition from predominantly compressive forces to extensional relaxation, resulting in the observed radiating graben and concentric ridges. Irnini Mons is a significant structural feature on Venus because the preservation of the geology allows for the analysis of Venus' regional stress orientation in response to a pressurized magma chamber over time.Buczkowski, D.L.; McGill, G.E.; Cooke, M.L.

The younger flows resurface and superimpose the older flows as seen by the intensity of observable wrinkle ridge deformation decreasing from older to younger flows. Irini Mons is characterized by various fracture, ridge, and graben complexes. This includes north-south trending rift and ridge structures that are parallel to the Badb Linea rift zone. Furthermore, many graben radiate from the central magma chamber resulting in a symmetrical web of structures. The radial graben are highly reflective in radar imaging and, therefore, easily noticeable. This radial network is a result of regional stresses that are altered closer to the magma-pressurized summit of Irnini Mons. The pressure from the magma chamber results in radiating graben because the regional linear compression is altered to radial compression in proximity to its \\"pressurized hole\\". Circumferential ridges and graben are also highly reflective to radar, and therefore, easily observed around the Sappho Patera depression. These concentric features formed after Irnini Mons lost the high pressure dynamic support from the mantle upwelling due to the lack of overlying flows. The presence of circumferential structures along a shallow depression on Irnini Mons' summit is a characteristic of coronae on Venus. The presence of corona-like features suggest two possible theories for interpretation of how Irnini Mons developed. One hypothesis is a transition from a primarily shield volcano structure to a primarily corona structure due to continued lithosphere thinning and lack of resurfacing flows. Another hypothesis is Irnini Mons was originally a corona which was uplifted due to compressive forces. =Regional Geology= The low viscosity basaltic flows that compose Irnini Mons overlay several regional plains and tessera units of Eistla Regio. The oldest observed rocks are a highly deformed tessera unit with ridges and grabens at high angles between one another which create the tessera-textured pattern for which it is named. The plains units are generally less deformed, but show a dominant linear trend of wrinkle ridges going in an east-west direction from the prevalent north-south compression. The tessera structures are truncated by the east-west wrinkle ridges, indicating the tessera formed before the wrinkle ridges. The youngest plains material is significantly less deformed than the older plains material and underlies the Irnini flows. All impact craters observed occurred prior to formation of the east-west wrinkle ridges. The largest regional structure is the Guor Linea rift extending to the northwest, with its counterpart, the Virtus Linea rift, trending back in a southeast direction. Both of these rift zones cut through the plains units but not through Irnini Mons, indicating the Irnini flows postdate these rifts. Badb Linea is the third rift zone and consists of closely spaced, linear grabens trending in a north-south direction. However, unlike the other rifts, Badb Linea has structures which both truncate and cross-cut the Irnini flows, signifying that its rifting occurred before and after the Irnini flows. The abundance of tectonic structures (e.g. wrinkle ridges, graben, and tessera) in proximity to Irnini Mons provides indications for the regional stress orientation of the shallow crust, as well as local timelines. The dominant change from east-west trending regional wrinkle ridges to radial ridges around Irnini Mons signifies a transition from north-south compression to radial compression near the summit. Formation Theories frame =Shield Volcano= The most widely accepted belief is that Irnini Mons formed as a shield volcano, and experienced a crater collapse later in its geologic life. Shield Volcanoes on Venus develop as a result of mantle upwelling occurring under thick lithosphere in a constant location over a relatively long period of time. Effusive flows from the magma chamber emitted low viscosity, basaltic lava which resurfaced the regional tessera plains of Venus. The placid flows eventually formed a shallow sloping volcano with its summit above the magma pressurized center.Dufek, Josef (2000).

Abstract 2012. http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/venus2009/pdf/2012.pdf The central depression, Sappho Patera, formed due to a loss of dynamic support from the central magma chamber upwelling. The loss of mantle support resulted in a gravitational collapse of the summit and a relaxation of the compressive stresses directed towards the summit.McGill, G.E. (1998). Venus: Evolution of central Eistla Regio. 29th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. LPI. Abstract 1191. http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/LPSC98/pdf/1191.pdf The result is a pattern of concentric ridges and fractures around a semi-circular, caldera-like depression on the summit of Irnini Mons.Pace, K.R., Krassilnikov, A.S. (2003). Calderas on Venus: Tectonics, volcanism, and relationship with regional plains. 34th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. LPI. Abstract 1309. http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2003/pdf/1309.pdf In addition, Irnini Mons then ceased to emit steady flows and went into a stable isostatic balace with low density lithospheric support. The lack of steady, resurfacing flows allowed the preservation of volcanic-tectonic features that had developed over the life-span of the volcano. The transition from volcanic build-up to summit collapse is directly related to the degree of melting from the central magma chamber.Grindrod, P.M., Stofan, E.R. (2004). The evolution of four volcano/corona 'hybrids' on Venus. 35th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. LPI. Abstract 1250. http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2004/pdf/1250.pdf =Uplifted Corona= An alternate theory is, rather than being a shield volcano, Irnini Mons developed as a corona under thin lithosphere, and was simply tectonically uplifted to its present elevation under the north-south compression. Coronae develop when a mantle upwelling bends the crust upwards, which later collapses when the dynamic support from the upwelling is lost, resulting in a shallow oval-shaped depression. This hypothesis requires two assumptions: *The formation of Irnini Mons as a corona occurred simultaneously with uplift. *The Irnini flows predate the radial and circumferential structures seen on Irnini Mons' summit. If the corona uplift theory is correct, then most of the topographic highs in the Eistla Regio region of Venus would also be due to uplift. Additionally, it supports the hypothesis of a thin lithosphere on Venus. The theory of corona uplift much more unlikely than Irnini Mons simply being a shield volcano which underwent natural volcanic progression. Timeline of Events Detailed geologic map by the United States Geological Survey of the V-20 quadrangle on Venus. Irnini Mons and Sappo Patera are located in the center of this quadrangle. An approximate timeline of the regional geologic events, occurring over a time period of a few hundred million years, can be summarized as: # East-west wrinkle ridge formation on the regional plains due to north-south compression. # Formation of radial graben due to magma pressure and radial ridges due to magma pressure and regional compression around Irnini Mons. # Badb Linea rifting and decline of regional compression forms graben at further distances from Irnini Mons. # Lessening of magma pressure and formation of concentric graben near summit. # Formation of concentric ridges near summit due to gravitational relaxation.

After education at Sutton Coldfield grammar school, Bedford won a Queen's scholarship at Westminster School in 1840, and qualified for a studentship at Christ Church, Oxford. An attack of scarlet fever made him miss that chance, and on 6 June 1844 he matriculated as a commoner at Brasenose College. In 1847 he was secretary of the Oxford Union Society when Lord Dufferin was president. He graduated B.A. in 1848 and proceeded M.A. in 1852. In 1849 Bedford was ordained to the curacy of Southwell, Nottinghamshire, and in 1850 he succeeded his uncle, Dr. Williamson, as rector of Sutton Coldfield. He held the post for 42 years, and was rural dean for 25. Bedford died at Cricklewood on 23 January 1905; his ashes were buried after cremation at Golders Green. Works Bedford wrote on the antiquities of Sutton Coldfield in Three Hundred Years of a Family Living, being a History of the Rilands of Sutton Coldfield (1889), and The Manor of Sutton, Feudal and Municipal (1901).

NASA's Mars Science Laboratory Rover, named Curiosity, arrived at the low lying depression on December 17, 2012, 125 sols, or martian days, into its 668 sol planned mission on the planet. Primary mission goals of the Mars Science Laboratory were to assess the potential habitability of the planet and whether or not the Martian environment is, or has ever been, capable of supporting life. The site was chosen after much study of the region by previous missions. The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter observed morphological features created by the presence of liquid water, suggesting the presence of an ancient lake which could have sustained microbial life. The geologic depression takes its name from the city Yellowknife, capital of the Canadian Northwest Territories, in honor of the 4 billion year old rock in the region surrounding the city, which matches the approximate age of the uncovered rock in Gale Crater. Gale Crater Curiositys path from Bradbury Landing to Yellowknife Bay and the geologic way- points along the way. Yellowknife Bay is a 5-meter geologic depression located in the large impact crater known as Gale Crater. The Crater is located on Mars near the northwestern part of the Aeolis quadrangle just south of the planet's equator. The crater's central feature is a mountain called Aeolis Mons, nicknamed Mount Sharp. Geologic units in the interior of the crater offer a wide range of relative ages of the impact and provide a detailed geologic history of activities within the crater. Gale Crater is the landing site of the Mars Science Laboratory rover, which was launched from Cape Canaveral on November 26, 2011 and landed at the site designated Bradbury Landing on August 6, 2012. The rover is equipped with a more advanced suite of instruments than has ever landed on an extraterrestrial planet, perfect for assessing the geology of the target regions. From its landing point, Curiosity drove half a kilometer northeast to the low lying depression. A flatter and more lightly colored region than the previous terrain, this region was designated Yellowknife Bay. A top mission priority for the Mars Science Laboratory team was to capture a 360-degree, color panoramic image of this region. This image was then to be used to select drilling locations of the rock samples, John Klein and Cumberland, taken from Yellowknife Bay. Habitability Yellowknife Bay - three rock strata: Glenelg member, Gillespie Lake Member, and Sheepbed Member (Curiosity rover). Conditions on Mars during the first billion years were dramatically different from the present day. Whether or not the conditions were once habitable depends largely on the volatile content, specifically water (H20) and carbon dioxide (CO2), of the surface. The greatest source of evidence for the presence of these volatiles comes from observations of surface morphologies. Previous observations of Gale Crater show that the strata exposed at Yellowknife Bay are most likely fan or down slope equivalents, such as lacustrine deposits. Curiosity used its ChemCam and Mastcam instruments to analyse the chemistry and layering of a geological outcrop designated as \\"Shaler\\". This geologic formation displayed cross- bedding features, clear indicators of past interactions with water flows. Yellowknife Bay was chosen by the Mars Science Laboratory team as the first major site for exploration because the exposed strata was inferred to be a shallow fluvial-lacustrine deposit. These aqueous environments are believed to preserve evidence of paleo-habitability and potentially, earth-like microorganisms capable of breaking down rocks and minerals for energy, known as chemolithoautotrophs. Until Curiosity had arrived on Mars, all surface age dating of Mars had been through relative techniques using geomorphology and crater counting methods in order to determine an estimated age of the rock layering. The Mars Science Laboratory team used the rover to collect samples from the mudstone at Yellowknife bay then, using the mass spectrometer, from the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument package measured argon isotopes for an absolute radiometric date of the rock member, and an approximate age of its exposure to the surface. The age of the lake bed rock was dated to 4 billion years old, and exposed by wind erosion between 30 and 110 million years ago, giving us the first absolute age of a rock on another planet. Still, a more ideal location to search for evidence of life on Mars would have been a member exposed more recently, as few as a million years or less, so it could have been better preserved from the harsh surface radiation. Yellowknife Bay Geology Cross section of three sedimentary beds which compose the Yellowknife Bay formation, as well as drill sites for the John Klein and Cumberland rock samples. The primary composition of most terrestrial bodies in our solar system is igneous rock, but it has long been speculated that sedimentary rock exists in great quantity on Mars, as it does on Earth. The Curiosity rover has confirmed the presence of sedimentary rock composed of fine-, medium-, and coarse-grained sandstone basalt. This exposure is about thick and is divided into three unique strata. From bottom to top, these strata have been designated: the Sheepbed member ( thick), the Gillespie Lake member ( thick), and the Glenelg member ( thick); the assemblage of members is known as the Yellowknife Bay formation. Active erosion, attributed to both aeolian and fluvial events, has caused the Gillespie Lake Member to weather away, revealing the underlying Sheepbed layer and creating a topographic step observable in HiRISE images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The Gillespie Lake bed appears massive and is composed of poorly sorted, angular to well-rounded grains, which make up sheetlike sandstone basalt. These characteristics further support a model of fluvial transport and deposition. In addition, sandstone beds associated with the Gillespie Lake Member seem similar to microbially induced sedimentary structures (MISS) found on Earth, according to one study. It was from the Sheepbed layer that Curiosity took two drilling samples from the mudstone sedimentary rock. These drill samples were named John Klein and Cumberland and were, respectively, the second and third drilling samples Curiosity retrieved from the martian regolith. The first being an eolian deposit, named Rocknest, sampled from an area to the west of Yellowknife bay. The two samples were drilled apart and within of the same stratigraphic level. =John Klein and Cumberland Samples= John Klein site chosen for Curiositys drill sampling. A number of different instruments were used by Curiosity in attempts to assess the mineralogy of the mudstone sampled from the Sheepbed strata. The CheMin XRD, Mastcam, Chemcam, alpha particle x-ray spectrometer (APXS), and the Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) were all used to obtain the most complete picture possible of the chemistry and mineralogy of the two samples, which were used to describe the region as a whole. A large amount of phyllosilicates, clay minerals such as smectite, were found to be major constituents in the two samples. Clay minerals are hydrous aluminum phyllosillicates and form only in the presence of water, further supporting the claim that an ancient crater lake once existed in this region. Other silicates were detected as well, such as the Magnesium-rich end-member of olivine called forsterite, pigeonite, plagioclase, augite, clinopyroxene, and orthopyroxene. These detected minerals are all indicative of a potential mafic source for the origin of the deposition. After Yellowknife Bay With the Mars Science Laboratory's primary goal of establishing whether a habitable paleo-environment could have existed on Mars accomplished while within Yellowknife Bay, the team of NASA scientists then directed Curiosity out of the Yellowknife bay formation and toward the original destination of Mount Sharp, which rises from the base of Gale Crater. On July 4, 2013, Curiosity drove away from the Glenelg member and began its journey to Mount Sharp. NASA scientists estimated this drive would take the rover a year to complete.

Lifeless Planet was in development since 2011 and is primarily the product of the one developer, David Board.  Plot  The game follows an astronaut on a trip to another planet that is thought to be filled with lifeforms. The mission is a failure as the ship is lost in the crash, both of the other crew members are killed, and the planet turns out to be an enormous wasteland seemingly completely devoid of life; however, among the vast emptiness is a derelict Soviet Union science outpost constructed on the planet. The game follows the protagonist as he explores the planet, figures out how the Soviets managed to travel to the planet and why the outpost is now empty,, and why the planet is devoid of life. As he explores through the planet, he occasionally receives hallucinations and flashbacks of his life on Earth. As the protagonist makes his way across the planet in search of answers, he finds out he is not alone and the only other survivor is a mysterious Russian woman named Aelita who guides him through the planet's eerie landscape. Through audio recordings left behind by the Soviet colonists, the protagonist is able to piece together what occurred on the planet. In 1974, the Soviets discovered a portal in Siberia which led them to the planet. The planet was originally filled with bountiful lifeforms, among them a strange type of green moss that acted as the primary energy source for the planet's native lifeforms (which the Soviets adapted as their main source of electricity on the planet). Wanting to use the planet to establish a \\"new Motherland\\" for their people, the Soviets kept their discovery a secret as they began colonizing the planet. The entrance portal was eventually discovered to be only one way, constructed in this manner by the planet's previous inhabitants due to the times between the planet and Earth being out of sync (Earth is hundreds of years ahead of the planet). To compensate, the previous inhabitants had constructed a second \\"exit\\" portal that led back to Earth, which was discovered by the Soviet colonists and used with the entrance portal to receive resources and new colonists. However, the Soviets' overuse of the portals and the planet's resources caused the green moss to gradually die out, which led to the portal mutating the remaining lifeforms on the planet to become hostile towards the colonists. The portals themselves also became extremely unstable, and their connection to Earth was eventually severed. While looking for a solution, the Soviet scientists discovered that Aelita, a colonist who had lost both of her children early on in the crisis, had been maintaining a secret garden containing the various plant forms of the planet, among them the now extinct green moss. After observing that Aelita could interact with the plant forms, the desperate scientists experimented on her, injecting her with DNA taken from the plant forms of the planet. As a result, Aelita transformed into a human-plant hybrid that was able to survive on the planet and influence the growth of its plant life-forms. Unfortunately, this was insufficient to prevent the colonists' demise and all of them were eventually wiped out, leaving Aelita the sole survivor. After discovering this information, the protagonist is led by Aelita to the heart of the planet, where she sacrifices herself to restore the planet's original life forms. This also has the consequence of repairing the previously unstable portals, allowing the protagonist to leave the planet. As the protagonist makes his way to the exit portal, an interview flashback reveals that he had a wife on Earth. One day, she disappeared, later discovered to have fallen off of a cliff and rendered comatose, with a mysterious green moss growing around her toes by the time she was found by the protagonist. Afterward, she was placed under life support, which served as the reason for the protagonist volunteering to participate in the one-way expedition to the planet in the first place: despite knowing that it would take a long time (if at all) for his wife to recover, he was still unwilling to take her off of life support, as he wanted to give her \\"every chance to live again, even if [he] wasn't there\\". Reaching the portal, the protagonist returns to Earth, now hundreds of years into the future. Reflecting on his experiences, the protagonist arrives on a cliff (the same one of which his wife fell off) that overlooks a futuristic city.  Gameplay  The player explores the desolate environment of Lifeless Planet. The game contains platforming adventure and puzzles to solve. Levels in the game are linear, but their large size allow for limited exploration. The gameplay difficulty increases as the game progresses to match up with the player's skills learned from playing the game. The game involves various mechanics. Namely, the two most important mechanics are the protagonist's oxygen and jetpack fuel levels. The protagonist must replenish his oxygen using various \\"Oxygen Supply Vehicles\\" and oxygen tanks scattered intermittently throughout the game, with each replenishing action granting an extra 8 in-game hours of oxygen. The protagonist must also use his jetpack to cover short distances between platforms, with jetpack fuel allowing sustained boosts across larger gaps. Unlike oxygen replenishing sources, jetpack fuel tanks are usually strategically located beside difficult jumps that require more advanced platforming. An additional mechanic is a \\"mobile grabber arm\\" that is obtained fairly early on in the game, which allows the protagonist to grab objects and solve puzzles which would otherwise be out of reach. Puzzles in the game are relatively simple, involving: finding and operating a switch to activate a power source; using dynamite to blow away obstacles; rolling and jumping on moveable rocks to access new areas; transporting green moss power sources to outlets; and pressing buttons in a specific order to open a giant gate (the latter two of which usually involve using the aforementioned mobile grabber arm). The first puzzle of the game involves exploring a small colonist town to find both halves of a passcode that is needed to gain entry into the main Soviet laboratory. Lore in the game come mainly in the form of audio recordings left behind by the Soviet colonists, which act as the main source of exposition for the game. There are also a very small number of minerals that the protagonist can inspect. When the protagonist inspects a mineral or traverses an area of interest, he will make an entry into his log. There are no hostile mobs that the protagonist must fight during his journey, but there are still several ways in which he may die. The most common method is falling to death, but the protagonist can also be killed by the planet's mutated plant life (provided he accidentally touches it) or by being incinerated in lava (which is only found in the game's \\"inferno\\" level). As such, the protagonist must generally follow the green footsteps whenever he encounters them, as they provide the safest path to take when navigating the planet.  Development and release  The game was originally planned to be an action platformer, but as development of the story expanded, developer David Board chose to refocus the game to center on the story. The game is inspired by classic adventure games including LucasArts's The Dig and the platform game Another World, as well as by Cold War sci-fi B movies. Board said that he aimed for the game to convey the \\"combined sense of optimism and dread of what science was capable of in the hands of humankind\\". The game was part funded through crowdfunding, launching a Kickstarter campaign in September 2011. The campaign achieved its $8,500 target within 24 hours of going live, and eventually closed with over $17,000 raised. The exposure generated by the campaign helped to secure a publishing deal for the game. Though Board originally intended to release the game in July 2012, delays meant it took until March 2014 for just the Steam Early Access release. The early access release included the first six chapters of the game, approximately one third of the game's content which corresponds to about two hours of gameplay. PC Gamer described that gameplay as \\"perfunctory\\", with some puzzle solutions being extremely obvious, a lot of time spent \\"just walking\\", and some gameplay elements feeling \\"contrived\\". The final version of the game has around 20 chapters and which was released June 6, 2014. It would also include features not present in early access such as support for OS X, subtitles, and the option for Russian or German language. This game is similar to the work of Aleksey Nikolayevich Tolstoy, Aelita.  Reception  The game received mixed reviews, generating a score of 59/100 on reviews aggregation website Metacritic.

Its identifier in the Geographic Names Information System is 1179707. Historically, a Native American path went from Council Cup up the Little Wapwallopen Creek valley and to Wilkes-Barre. The path ran from Council Cup to the creek and then northeast alongside it before going past Lily Lake and over Penobscot Mountain towards where Wilkes-Barre is now located. The first person to settle in Conyngham Township was Martin Harter, who settled on the creek near its mouth in 1795. In the late 1800s, there was an old ferry road near the mouth of Little Wapwallopen Creek. A railroad bridge also crosses the creek. Historically, a road ran from a small settlement on Big Wapwallopen Creek to an even smaller one on Little Wapwallopen Creek, near where Church Road presently is. The Glen Brook Water Company once had plans to construct a dam on the creek and also on its tributary Pond Creek. The Wilkes-Barre Ice Company and the Hazleton Ice Company also dammed a stream in the creek's watershed in 1912 and 1916 respectively, forming the Ice Ponds.

It is long and carries T-392/Hollow Road. Floodwaters from Little Wapwallopen Creek reached a height of over St. Marys Road in Dorrance Township during a storm in 1972. This is the only recorded flooding of a developed area caused by a major storm in the township. The creek also once flooded to a depth of over Hislop Road in Rice Township. In August 2002, the Pennsylvania Environmental Council received $57,897.76 to carry out a restoration plan on the upper reaches of Little Wapwallopen Creek. Since 2005, a project to remedy streambank erosion on the creek has been successful. The creek has a watershed association known as the Little Wapwallopen Creek Watershed Association. Biology The drainage basin of Little Wapwallopen Creek is designated as a Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. Wild trout naturally reproduce in the creek from its mouth upstream for to T-392. They also do so in the tributary Pond Creek from its headwaters downstream to its mouth. Henry C. Bradsby's 1893 book History of Luzerne County, Pennsylvania stated that Long Pond and Round Pond, two ponds in the watershed, had a large fish population. The creek was stocked with 700 fingerling, yearling, and adult brook trout in 1909.

He played non-league football in the north-east of England before joining First Division club Sunderland, but never played first-team football for that club. His primary position was that of centre half, although he also played at right back or right half. Life and career Halliday was born in Browney Colliery, in County Durham. As a schoolboy, he played three times for Durham Schools under-15 team in the 1923‚Äì24 season, and captained England Schoolboys against Wales in Cardiff. He played for non-league teams in his local area, and captained Durham Amateurs before turning professional. He spent the 1927‚Äì28 season with First Division club Sunderland, but never appeared for the first team, and joined Third Division North club Darlington in 1928 as an 18-year-old. He established himself in the starting eleven, and despite his youth, captained the team for three years. In the 1932‚Äì33 season, Halliday made 41 out of a possible 42 appearances in the league, taking his total to 127 in senior competition. In May 1933, he and Darlington teammates Harry Brown, Billy Eden and Fred Hopkinson were members of the Rest of Durham XI that faced Sunderland in a match to celebrate the silver jubilee of the Durham County Football Association. Darlington had finished bottom of the Northern Section, so had to apply for re-election. Although their application was successful, Halliday left the club. He moved into the Southern Section of the Third Division with Norwich City, where he became a regular in the side. He made 40 appearances as Norwich won the divisional title and with it promotion to the Second Division for the first time in the club's history. Based on Norwich's recruitment of Exeter City's Harold Houghton, the Manchester Guardian suggested that the club \\"realise[d] the worth of a footballer of experience and anticipation in such a struggle\\", and went on to list \\"other players of this stamp\\", including \\"Halliday, a rare centre-half\\". In his review of the season, the Observer's J.A.H. Catton, praised Norwich's forwards, and thought that \\"of all the capital players behind the front line, Thomas Halliday, a centre half-back formerly of Darlington, must be highly commended.\\" Halliday took over the captaincy from Stan Ramsay during the next season. He remained with Norwich for six-and-a-half years, making the last of his 203 appearances for the club on 27 December 1938 in a 4‚Äì0 defeat away to Newcastle United, and finished the season with Exeter City in the Third Division South. In recognition of his contribution to Norwich City, Halliday was elected to the club's Hall of Fame. He died in 1975, aged 65 or 66.

A dozen years later, Polish husband-and-wife sociologists Stanis≈Çaw Ossowski and Maria Ossowska (the Ossowscy) took up the same subject in an article on \\"The Science of Science\\"Maria Ossowska and Stanis≈Çaw Ossowski, \\"The Science of Science\\", originally published in Polish as \\"Nauka o nauce\\" (\\"The Science of Science\\") in Nauka Polska (Polish Science), vol. XX (1935), no. 3. whose 1935 English-language version first introduced the term \\"science of science\\" to the world.Bohdan Walentynowicz, Editor's Note, in Bohdan Walentynowicz, ed., Polish Contributions to the Science of Science, p. XI. The article postulated that the new discipline would subsume such earlier ones as epistemology, the philosophy of science, the psychology of science, and the sociology of science.Maria Ossowska and Stanis≈Çaw Ossowski, \\"The Science of Science\\", reprinted in Bohdan Walentynowicz, ed., Polish Contributions to the Science of Science, pp. 84‚Äì85. The science of science would also concern itself with questions of a practical character such as social and state policy in relation to science, such as the organization of institutions of higher learning, of research institutes, and of scientific expeditions, and the protection of scientific workers, etc. It would concern itself as well with historical questions: the history of the conception of science, of the scientist, of the various disciplines, and of learning in general.Maria Ossowska and Stanis≈Çaw Ossowski, \\"The Science of Science\\", in Bohdan Walentynowicz, ed., Polish Contributions to the Science of Science, p. 86. In their 1935 paper, the Ossowscy mentioned the German philosopher Werner Schingnitz (1899‚Äì1953) who, in fragmentary 1931 remarks, had enumerated some possible types of research in the science of science and had proposed his own name for the new discipline: scientiology. The Ossowscy took issue with the name: > Those who wish to replace the expression 'science of science' by a one-word > term [that] sound[s] international, in the belief that only after receiving > such a name [will] a given group of [questions be] officially dubbed an > autonomous discipline, [might] be reminded of the name 'mathesiology', > proposed long ago for similar purposes [by the French mathematician and > physicist Andr√©-Marie Amp√®re (1775‚Äì1836)].\\"Maria Ossowska and Stanis≈Çaw > Ossowski, \\"The Science of Science\\", in Bohdan Walentynowicz, ed., Polish > Contributions to the Science of Science, pp. 87‚Äì88, 95. Yet, before long, in Poland, the unwieldy three-word term nauka o nauce, or science of science, was replaced by the more versatile one-word term naukoznawstwo, or logology, and its natural variants: naukoznawca or logologist, naukoznawczy or logological, and naukoznawczo or logologically. And just after World War II, only 11 years after the Ossowscys landmark 1935 paper, the year 1946 saw the founding of the Polish Academy of Sciences' quarterly Zagadnienia Naukoznawstwa (Logology) ‚Äì‚Äî long before similar journals in many other countries.Bohdan Walentynowicz, \\"Editor's Note\\", Polish Contributions to the Science of Science, p. xii. The new discipline also took root elsewhere‚Äîin English-speaking countries, without the benefit of a one- word name. Science =The term= The word science, from the Latin scientia meaning knowledge, signifies somewhat different things in different languages. In English, science when unqualified, generally refers to the exact, natural, or hard sciences.Michael Shermer, \\"Scientia Humanitatis: Reason, empiricism and skepticism are not virtues of science alone\\", Scientific American, vol. 312, no. 6 (June 2015), p. 80. The corresponding terms in other languages, for example French, German, and Polish, refer to a broader domain that includes not only the exact sciences (logic and mathematics) and the natural sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, Earth sciences, geography, astronomy, etc.) but also the engineering sciences, social sciences (history, geography, psychology, physical anthropology, sociology, political science, economics, international relations, pedagogy, etc.), and humanities (philosophy, history, cultural anthropology, linguistics, etc.).Michael Shermer, \\"Scientia Humanitatis\\", Scientific American, vol. 312, no. 6 (June 2015), p. 80. University of Amsterdam humanities professor Rens Bod points out that science‚Äîdefined as a set of methods that describes and interprets observed or inferred phenomena, past or present, aimed at testing hypotheses and building theories‚Äîapplies to such humanities fields as philology, art history, musicology, linguistics, archaeology, historiography, and literary studies. Bod gives a historic example of scientific textual analysis. In 1440 the Italian philologist Lorenzo Valla exposed the Latin document Donatio Constantini, or The Donation of Constantine ‚Äì which was used by the Catholic Church to legitimize its claim to lands in the Western Roman Empire ‚Äì as a forgery. Valla used historical, linguistic, and philological evidence, including counterfactual reasoning, to rebut the document. Valla found words and constructions in the document that could not have been used by anyone in the time of Emperor Constantine I, at the beginning of the fourth century C.E. For example, the late Latin word feudum, meaning fief, referred to the feudal system, which would not come into existence until the medieval era, in the seventh century C.E. Valla's methods were those of science, and inspired the later scientifically-minded work of Dutch humanist Erasmus of Rotterdam (1466‚Äì1536), Leiden University professor Joseph Justus Scaliger (1540‚Äì1609), and philosopher Baruch Spinoza (1632‚Äì77). Here it is not the experimental method dominant in the exact and natural sciences, but the comparative method central to the humanities, that reigns supreme. =Knowability= Science's search for the truth about various aspects of reality entails the question of the very knowability of reality. Philosopher Thomas Nagel writes: \\"[In t]he pursuit of scientific knowledge through the interaction between theory and observation... we test theories against their observational consequences, but we also question or reinterpret our observations in light of theory. (The choice between geocentric and heliocentric theories at the time of the Copernican revolution is a vivid example.) ... How things seem is the starting point for all knowledge, and its development through further correction, extension, and elaboration is inevitably the result of more seemings‚Äîconsidered judgments about the plausibility and consequences of different theoretical hypotheses. The only way to pursue the truth is to consider what seems true, after careful reflection of a kind appropriate to the subject matter, in light of all the relevant data, principles, and circumstances.\\"Thomas Nagel, \\"Listening to Reason\\" (a review of T.M. Scanlon, Being Realistic about Reasons, Oxford University Press, 132 pp.), The New York Review of Books, vol. LXI, no. 15 (October 9, 2014), p. 49. The question of knowability is approached from a different perspective by physicist-astronomer Marcelo Gleiser: \\"What we observe is not nature itself but nature as discerned through data we collect from machines. In consequence, the scientific worldview depends on the information we can acquire through our instruments. And given that our tools are limited, our view of the world is necessarily myopic. We can see only so far into the nature of things, and our ever shifting scientific worldview reflects this fundamental limitation on how we perceive reality.\\" Gleiser cites the condition of biology before and after the invention of the microscope or gene sequencing; of astronomy before and after the telescope; of particle physics before and after colliders or fast electronics. \\"[T]he theories we build and the worldviews we construct change as our tools of exploration transform. This trend is the trademark of science.\\"Marcelo Gleiser, \\"How Much Can We Know? The reach of the scientific method is constrained by the limitations of our tools and the intrinsic impenetrability of some of nature's deepest questions\\", Scientific American, vol. 318, no. 6 (June 2018), p. 73. Writes Gleiser: \\"There is nothing defeatist in understanding the limitations of the scientific approach to knowledge.... What should change is a sense of scientific triumphalism‚Äîthe belief that no question is beyond the reach of scientific discourse. \\"There are clear unknowables in science‚Äîreasonable questions that, unless currently accepted laws of nature are violated, we cannot find answers to. One example is the multiverse: the conjecture that our universe is but one among a multitude of others, each potentially with a different set of laws of nature. Other universes lie outside our causal horizon, meaning that we cannot receive or send signals to them. Any evidence for their existence would be circumstantial: for example, scars in the radiation permeating space because of a past collision with a neighboring universe.\\"Marcelo Gleiser, \\"How Much Can We Know?, Scientific American, vol. 318, no. 6 (June 2018), p. 73. Gleiser gives three further examples of unknowables, involving the origins of the universe; of life; and of mind: \\"Scientific accounts of the origin of the universe are incomplete because they must rely on a conceptual framework to even begin to work: energy conservation, relativity, quantum physics, for instance. Why does the universe operate under these laws and not others? \\"Similarly, unless we can prove that only one or very few biochemical pathways exist from nonlife to life, we cannot know for sure how life originated on Earth. \\"For consciousness, the problem is the jump from the material to the subjective‚Äîfor example, from firing neurons to the experience of pain or the color red. Perhaps some kind of rudimentary consciousness could emerge in a sufficiently complex machine. But how could we tell? How do we establish‚Äîas opposed to conjecture‚Äîthat something is conscious?\\" Paradoxically, writes Gleiser, it is through our consciousness that we make sense of the world, even if imperfectly. \\"Can we fully understand something of which we are a part?\\" Among all the sciences (i.e., disciplines of learning, writ large) there seems to exist an inverse relation between precision and intuitiveness. The most intuitive of the disciplines, aptly termed the \\"humanities\\", relate to common human experience and, even at their most exact, are thrown back on the comparative method; less intuitive and more precise than the humanities are the social sciences; while, at the base of the inverted pyramid of the disciplines, physics (concerned with mattergy ‚Äì the matter and energy in the universe) is, at its deepest, the most precise discipline and at the same time utterly non-intuitive. =Facts and theories= Theoretical physicist and mathematician Freeman Dyson explains that \\"[s]cience consists of facts and theories\\": \\"Facts are supposed to be true or false. They are discovered by observers or experimenters. A scientist who claims to have discovered a fact that turns out to be wrong is judged harshly.... \\"Theories have an entirely different status. They are free creations of the human mind, intended to describe our understanding of nature. Since our understanding is incomplete, theories are provisional. Theories are tools of understanding, and a tool does not need to be precisely true in order to be useful. Theories are supposed to be more-or-less true... A scientist who invents a theory that turns out to be wrong is judged leniently.\\"Freeman Dyson, \\"The Case for Blunders\\" (review of Mario Livio, Brilliant Blunders: From Darwin to Einstein‚ÄîColossal Mistakes by Great Scientists that Changed Our Understanding of Life and the Universe, Simon and Schuster), The New York Review of Books, vol. LXI, no. 4 (March 6, 2014), p. 4. Dyson cites a psychologist's description of how theories are born: \\"We can't live in a state of perpetual doubt, so we make up the best story possible and we live as if the story were true.\\" Dyson writes: \\"The inventor of a brilliant idea cannot tell whether it is right or wrong.\\" The passionate pursuit of wrong theories is a normal part of the development of science.Freeman Dyson, \\"The Case for Blunders\\", The New York Review of Books, vol. LXI, no. 4 (March 6, 2014), p. 4. Dyson cites, after Mario Livio, five famous scientists who made major contributions to the understanding of nature but also believed firmly in a theory that proved wrong. Charles Darwin explained the evolution of life with his theory of natural selection of inherited variations, but he believed in a theory of blending inheritance that made the propagation of new variations impossible. He never read Gregor Mendel's studies that showed that the laws of inheritance would become simple when inheritance was considered as a random process. Though Darwin in 1866 did the same experiment that Mendel had, Darwin did not get comparable results because he failed to appreciate the statistical importance of using very large experimental samples. Eventually, Mendelian inheritance by random variation would, no thanks to Darwin, provide the raw material for Darwinian selection to work on.Freeman Dyson, \\"The Case for Blunders\\", The New York Review of Books, vol. LXI, no. 4 (March 6, 2014), pp. 6, 8. William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) discovered basic laws of energy and heat, then used these laws to calculate an estimate of the age of the earth that was too short by a factor of fifty. He based his calculation on the belief that the earth's mantle was solid and could transfer heat from the interior to the surface only by conduction. It is now known that the mantle is partly fluid and transfers most of the heat by the far more efficient process of convection, which carries heat by a massive circulation of hot rock moving upward and cooler rock moving downward. Kelvin could see the eruptions of volcanoes bringing hot liquid from deep underground to the surface; but his skill in calculation blinded him to processes, such as volcanic eruptions, that could not be calculated. Linus Pauling discovered the chemical structure of protein and proposed a completely wrong structure for DNA, which carries hereditary information from parent to offspring. Pauling guessed a wrong structure for DNA because he assumed that a pattern that worked for protein would also work for DNA. He overlooked the gross chemical differences between protein and DNA. Francis Crick and James Watson paid attention to the differences and found the correct structure for DNA that Pauling had missed a year earlier. Astronomer Fred Hoyle discovered the process by which the heavier elements essential to life are created by nuclear reactions in the cores of massive stars. He then proposed a theory of the history of the universe known as steady-state cosmology, which has the universe existing forever without an initial Big Bang (as Hoyle derisively dubbed it). He held his belief in the steady state long after observations proved that the Big Bang had happened. Albert Einstein discovered the theory of space, time, and gravitation known as general relativity, and then added a cosmological constant, later known as dark energy. Subsequently, Einstein withdrew his proposal of dark energy, believing it unnecessary. Long after his death, observations suggested that dark energy really exists, so that Einstein's addition to the theory may have been right; and his withdrawal, wrong. To Mario Livio's five examples of scientists who blundered, Dyson adds a sixth: himself. Dyson had concluded, on theoretical principles, that what was to become known as the W-particle, a charged weak boson, could not exist. An experiment conducted at CERN, in Geneva, later proved him wrong. \\"With hindsight I could see several reasons why my stability argument would not apply to W-particles. [They] are too massive and too short-lived to be a constituent of anything that resembles ordinary matter.\\"Freeman Dyson, \\"The Case for Blunders\\", The New York Review of Books, vol. LXI, no. 4 (March 6, 2014), p. 8. =Empiricism= Steven Weinberg, 1979 Nobel laureate in physics, and a historian of science, writes that the core goal of science has always been the same: \\"to explain the world\\"; and in reviewing earlier periods of scientific thought, he concludes that only since Isaac Newton has that goal been pursued more or less correctly. He decries the \\"intellectual snobbery\\" that Plato and Aristotle showed in their disdain for science's practical applications, and he holds Francis Bacon and Ren√© Descartes to have been the \\"most overrated\\" among the forerunners of modern science (they tried to prescribe rules for conducting science, which \\"never works\\").Jim Holt, \\"At the Core of Science\\" (a review of Steven Weinberg, To Explain the World: The Discovery of Modern Science, Harper, [2015], 416 pp., $28.99, ), The New York Review of Books, vol. LXII, no. 14 (September 24, 2015), p. 53. Weinberg draws parallels between past and present science, as when a scientific theory is \\"fine-tuned\\" (adjusted) to make certain quantities equal, without any understanding of why they should be equal. Such adjusting vitiated the celestial models of Plato's followers, in which different spheres carrying the planets and stars were assumed, with no good reason, to rotate in exact unison. But, Weinberg writes, a similar fine-tuning also besets current efforts to understand the \\"dark energy\\" that is speeding up the expansion of the universe.Jim Holt, \\"At the Core of Science\\" (a review of Steven Weinberg, To Explain the World: The Discovery of Modern Science, Harper, 2015), The New York Review of Books, vol. LXII, no. 14 (September 24, 2015), p. 53. Ancient science has been described as having gotten off to a good start, then faltered. The doctrine of atomism, propounded by the pre-Socratic philosophers Leucippus and Democritus, was naturalistic, accounting for the workings of the world by impersonal processes, not by divine volitions. Nevertheless, these pre-Socratics come up short for Weinberg as proto-scientists, in that they apparently never tried to justify their speculations or to test them against evidence. Weinberg believes that science faltered early on due to Plato's suggestion that scientific truth could be attained by reason alone, disregarding empirical observation, and due to Aristotle's attempt to explain nature teleologically‚Äîin terms of ends and purposes. Plato's ideal of attaining knowledge of the world by unaided intellect was \\"a false goal inspired by mathematics\\"‚Äîone that for centuries \\"stood in the way of progress that could be based only on careful analysis of careful observation.\\" And it \\"never was fruitful\\" to ask, as Aristotle did, \\"what is the purpose of this or that physical phenomenon.\\" A scientific field in which the Greek and Hellenistic world did make progress was astronomy. This was partly for practical reasons: the sky had long served as compass, clock, and calendar. Also, the regularity of the movements of heavenly bodies made them simpler to describe than earthly phenomena. But not too simple: though the sun, moon and \\"fixed stars\\" seemed regular in their celestial circuits, the \\"wandering stars\\"‚Äîthe planets‚Äîwere puzzling; they seemed to move at variable speeds, and even to reverse direction. Writes Weinberg: \\"Much of the story of the emergence of modern science deals with the effort, extending over two millennia, to explain the peculiar motions of the planets.\\"Jim Holt, \\"At the Core of Science\\" (a review of Steven Weinberg, To Explain the World: The Discovery of Modern Science, Harper, 2015), The New York Review of Books, vol. LXII, no. 14 (September 24, 2015), pp. 53‚Äì54. The challenge was to make sense of the apparently irregular wanderings of the planets on the assumption that all heavenly motion is actually circular and uniform in speed. Circular, because Plato held the circle to be the most perfect and symmetrical form; and therefore circular motion, at uniform speed, was most fitting for celestial bodies. Aristotle agreed with Plato. In Aristotle's cosmos, everything had a \\"natural\\" tendency to motion that fulfilled its inner potential. For the cosmos' sublunary part (the region below the moon), the natural tendency was to move in a straight line: downward, for earthen things (such as rocks) and water; upward, for air and fiery things (such as sparks). But in the celestial realm things were not composed of earth, water, air, or fire, but of a \\"fifth element\\", or \\"quintessence,\\" which was perfect and eternal. And its natural motion was uniformly circular. The stars, the sun, the moon, and the planets were carried in their orbits by a complicated arrangement of crystalline spheres, all centered around an immobile earth.Jim Holt, \\"At the Core of Science\\" (a review of Steven Weinberg, To Explain the World: The Discovery of Modern Science, Harper, 2015), The New York Review of Books, vol. LXII, no. 14 (September 24, 2015), p. 54. The Platonic-Aristotelian conviction that celestial motions must be circular persisted stubbornly. It was fundamental to the astronomer Ptolemy's system, which improved on Aristotle's in conforming to the astronomical data by allowing the planets to move in combinations of circles called \\"epicycles\\". It even survived the Copernican revolution. Copernicus was conservative in his Platonic reverence for the circle as the heavenly pattern. According to Weinberg, Copernicus was motivated to dethrone the earth in favor of the sun as the immobile center of the cosmos largely by aesthetic considerations: he objected to the fact that Ptolemy, though faithful to Plato's requirement that heavenly motion be circular, had departed from Plato's other requirement that it be of uniform speed. By putting the sun at the center‚Äîactually, somewhat off-center‚ÄîCopernicus sought to honor circularity while restoring uniformity. But to make his system fit the observations as well as Ptolemy's system, Copernicus had to introduce still more epicycles. That was a mistake that, writes Weinberg, illustrates a recurrent theme in the history of science: \\"A simple and beautiful theory that agrees pretty well with observation is often closer to the truth than a complicated ugly theory that agrees better with observation.\\" The planets, however, do not move in perfect circles but in ellipses. It was Johannes Kepler, about a century after Copernicus, who reluctantly (for he too had Platonic affinities) realized this. Thanks to his examination of the meticulous observations compiled by astronomer Tycho Brahe, Kepler \\"was the first to understand the nature of the departures from uniform circular motion that had puzzled astronomers since the time of Plato.\\" The replacement of circles by supposedly ugly ellipses overthrew Plato's notion of perfection as the celestial explanatory principle. It also destroyed Aristotle's model of the planets carried in their orbits by crystalline spheres; writes Weinberg, \\"there is no solid body whose rotation can produce an ellipse.\\" Even if a planet were attached to an ellipsoid crystal, that crystal's rotation would still trace a circle. And if the planets were pursuing their elliptical motion through empty space, then what was holding them in their orbits? Science had reached the threshold of explaining the world not geometrically, according to shape, but dynamically, according to force. It was Isaac Newton who finally crossed that threshold. He was the first to formulate, in his \\"laws of motion\\", the concept of force. He demonstrated that Kepler's ellipses were the very orbits the planets would take if they were attracted toward the sun by a force that decreased as the square of the planet's distance from the sun. And by comparing the moon's motion in its orbit around the earth to the motion of, perhaps, an apple as it falls to the ground, Newton deduced that the forces governing them were quantitatively the same. \\"This,\\" writes Weinberg, \\"was the climactic step in the unification of the celestial and terrestrial in science.\\" By formulating a unified explanation of the behavior of planets, comets, moons, tides, and apples, writes Weinberg, Newton \\"provided an irresistible model for what a physical theory should be\\"‚Äîa model that fit no preexisting metaphysical criterion. In contrast to Aristotle, who claimed to explain the falling of a rock by appeal to its inner striving, Newton was unconcerned with finding a deeper cause for gravity. He declared in a postscript to the second, 1713 edition of his Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica: \\"I have not as yet been able to deduce from phenomena the reason for these properties of gravity, and I do not feign hypotheses. It is enough that gravity really exists and acts according to the laws that we have set forth.\\"Joshua Rothman, \\"The Rules of the Game: How does science really work?\\" (review of Michael Strevens, The Knowledge Machine: How Irrationality Created Modern Science, Liveright), The New Yorker, 5 October 2020, pp. 67‚Äì71. (p. 70.) What mattered were his mathematically stated principles describing this force, and their ability to account for a vast range of phenomena. About two centuries later, in 1915, a deeper explanation for Newton's law of gravitation was found in Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity: gravity could be explained as a manifestation of the curvature in spacetime resulting from the presence of matter and energy. Successful theories like Newton's, writes Weinberg, may work for reasons that their creators do not understand‚Äîreasons that deeper theories will later reveal. Scientific progress is not a matter of building theories on a foundation of reason, but of unifying a greater range of phenomena under simpler and more general principles. =Artificial intelligence= The term \\"artificial intelligence\\" (AI) was coined in 1955 by John McCarthy when he and other computer scientists were planning a workshop and did not want to invite Norbert Wiener, the brilliant, pugnacious, and increasingly philosophical (rather than practical) author on feedback mechanisms who had coined the term \\"cybernetics\\". The new term artificial intelligence, writes Kenneth Cukier, \\"set in motion decades of semantic squabbles ('Can machines think?') and fueled anxieties over malicious robots... If McCarthy... had chosen a blander phrase‚Äîsay, 'automation studies'‚Äîthe concept might not have appealed as much to Hollywood [movie] producers and [to] journalists...\\"Kenneth Cukier, \\"Ready for Robots? How to Think about the Future of AI\\", Foreign Affairs, vol. 98, no. 4 (July/August 2019), p. 192. As machines have become increasingly capable, specific tasks considered to require \\"intelligence\\", such as optical character recognition, have often been removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the \\"AI effect\\". It has been quipped that \\"AI is whatever hasn't been done yet.\\" Since 1950, when Alan Turing proposed what has come to be called the \\"Turing test,\\" there has been speculation whether machines such as computers can possess intelligence; and, if so, whether intelligent machines could become a threat to human intellectual and scientific ascendancy‚Äîor even an existential threat to humanity.John R. Searle, \\"What Your Computer Can't Know\\", The New York Review of Books, 9 October 2014, p. 52. John Searle points out common confusion about the correct interpretation of computation and information technology. \\"For example, one routinely reads that in exactly the same sense in which Garry Kasparov‚Ä¶ beat Anatoly Karpov in chess, the computer called Deep Blue played and beat Kasparov.... [T]his claim is [obviously] suspect. In order for Kasparov to play and win, he has to be conscious that he is playing chess, and conscious of a thousand other things... Deep Blue is conscious of none of these things because it is not conscious of anything at all. Why is consciousness so important? You cannot literally play chess or do much of anything else cognitive if you are totally disassociated from consciousness.\\"John R. Searle, \\"What Your Computer Can't Know\\", The New York Review of Books, 9 October 2014, p. 52. Searle explains that, \\"in the literal, real, observer-independent sense in which humans compute, mechanical computers do not compute. They go through a set of transitions in electronic states that we can interpret computationally. The transitions in those electronic states are absolute or observer-independent, but the computation is observer- relative. The transitions in physical states are just electrical sequences unless some conscious agent can give them a computational interpretation.... There is no psychological reality at all to what is happening in the [computer].\\"John R. Searle, \\"What Your Computer Can't Know\\", The New York Review of Books, 9 October 2014, p. 53. \\"[A] digital computer\\", writes Searle, \\"is a syntactical machine. It manipulates symbols and does nothing else. For this reason, the project of creating human intelligence by designing a computer program that will pass the Turing Test... is doomed from the start. The appropriately programmed computer has a syntax [rules for constructing or transforming the symbols and words of a language] but no semantics [comprehension of meaning].... Minds, on the other hand, have mental or semantic content.\\"John R. Searle, \\"What Your Computer Can't Know\\", The New York Review of Books, 9 October 2014, p. 54. Like Searle, Christof Koch, chief scientist and president of the Allen Institute for Brain Science, in Seattle, is doubtful about the possibility of \\"intelligent\\" machines attaining consciousness, because \\"[e]ven the most sophisticated brain simulations are unlikely to produce conscious feelings.\\" According to Koch, \\"Whether machines can become sentient [is important] for ethical reasons. If computers experience life through their own senses, they cease to be purely a means to an end determined by their usefulness to... humans. Per GNW [the Global Neuronal Workspace theory], they turn from mere objects into subjects... with a point of view.... Once computers' cognitive abilities rival those of humanity, their impulse to push for legal and political rights will become irresistible ‚Äì the right not to be deleted, not to have their memories wiped clean, not to suffer pain and degradation. The alternative, embodied by IIT [Integrated Information Theory], is that computers will remain only supersophisticated machinery, ghostlike empty shells, devoid of what we value most: the feeling of life itself.\\"Christof Koch, \\"Proust among the Machines\\", Scientific American, vol. 321, no. 6 (December 2019), pp. 46‚Äì49. (Texts quoted from pp. 48 and 49.) Professor of psychology and neural science Gary Marcus points out a so far insuperable stumbling block to artificial intelligence: an incapacity for reliable disambiguation. \\"[V]irtually every sentence [that people generate] is ambiguous, often in multiple ways. Our brain is so good at comprehending language that we do not usually notice.\\"Gary Marcus, \\"Am I Human?: Researchers need new ways to distinguish artificial intelligence from the natural kind\\", Scientific American, vol. 316, no. 3 (March 2017), p. 63. A prominent example is known as the \\"pronoun disambiguation problem\\" (\\"PDP\\"): a machine has no way of determining to whom or what a pronoun in a sentence‚Äîsuch as \\"he\\", \\"she\\" or \\"it\\"‚Äîrefers.Gary Marcus, \\"Am I Human?: Researchers need new ways to distinguish artificial intelligence from the natural kind\\", Scientific American, vol. 316, no. 3 (March 2017), p. 61. Computer scientist Pedro Domingos writes: \\"AIs are like autistic savants and will remain so for the foreseeable future.... AIs lack common sense and can easily make errors that a human never would... They are also liable to take our instructions too literally, giving us precisely what we asked for instead of what we actually wanted.Pedro Domingos, \\"Our Digital Doubles: AI will serve our species, not control it\\", Scientific American, vol. 319, no. 3 (September 2018), p. 93. Kai-Fu Lee, a Beijing-based venture capitalist, artificial-intelligence (AI) expert with a Ph.D. in computer science from Carnegie Mellon University, and author of the 2018 book, AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley, and the New World Order, emphasized in a 2018 PBS Amanpour interview with Hari Sreenivasan that AI, with all its capabilities, will never be capable of creativity or empathy.Amanpour, 28 September 2018. Paul Scharre writes in Foreign Affairs that \\"Today's AI technologies are powerful but unreliable.\\"Paul Scharre, \\"Killer Apps: The Real Dangers of an AI Arms Race\\", Foreign Affairs, vol. 98, no. 3 (May/June 2019), pp. 135‚Äì44. \\"Today's AI technologies are powerful but unreliable. Rules-based systems cannot deal with circumstances their programmers did not anticipate. Learning systems are limited by the data on which they were trained. AI failures have already led to tragedy. Advanced autopilot features in cars, although they perform well in some circumstances, have driven cars without warning into trucks, concrete barriers, and parked cars. In the wrong situation, AI systems go from supersmart to superdumb in an instant. When an enemy is trying to manipulate and hack an AI system, the risks are even greater.\\" (p. 140.) George Dyson, historian of computing, writes (in what might be called \\"Dyson's Law\\") that \\"Any system simple enough to be understandable will not be complicated enough to behave intelligently, while any system complicated enough to behave intelligently will be too complicated to understand.\\"Kenneth Cukier, \\"Ready for Robots? How to Think about the Future of AI\\", Foreign Affairs, vol. 98, no. 4 (July/August 2019), p. 197. Computer scientist Alex Pentland writes: \\"Current AI machine-learning algorithms are, at their core, dead simple stupid. They work, but they work by brute force.\\"Kenneth Cukier, \\"Ready for Robots? How to Think about the Future of AI\\", Foreign Affairs, vol. 98, no. 4 (July/August 2019), p. 198. \\"Artificial intelligence\\" is synonymous with \\"machine intelligence.\\" The more perfectly adapted an AI program is to a given task, the less applicable it will be to other specific tasks. An abstracted, AI general intelligence is a remote prospect, if feasible at all. Melanie Mitchell notes that an AI program called AlphaGo bested one of the world's best Go players, but that its \\"intelligence\\" is nontransferable: it cannot \\"think\\" about anything except Go. Mitchell writes: \\"We humans tend to overestimate AI advances and underestimate the complexity of our own intelligence.\\"Melanie Mitchell, Artificial Intelligence: A Guide for Thinking Humans, New York, Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2019, , quoted in The New Yorker, 4 November 2019, \\"Briefly Noted\\" section, p. 73. Humankind may not be able to outsource, to machines, its creative efforts in the sciences, technology, and culture. =Uncertainty= A central concern for science and scholarship is the reliability and reproducibility of their findings. Of all fields of study, none is capable of such precision as physics. But even there the results of studies, observations, and experiments cannot be considered absolutely certain and must be treated probabilistically; hence, statistically.Lydia Denworth, \\"A Significant Problem: Standard scientific methods are under fire. Will anything change?\\", Scientific American, vol. 321, no. 4 (October 2019), pp. 62‚Äì67. (p. 66.) In 1925 British geneticist and statistician Ronald Fisher published Statistical Methods for Research Workers, which established him as the father of modern statistics. He proposed a statistical test that summarized the compatibility of data with a given proposed model and produced a \\"p value\\". He counselled pursuing results with p values below 0.05 and not wasting time on results above that. Thus arose the idea that a p value less than 0.05 constitutes \\"statistical significance\\" ‚Äì a mathematical definition of \\"significant\\" results.Lydia Denworth, \\"A Significant Problem: Standard scientific methods are under fire. Will anything change?\\", Scientific American, vol. 321, no. 4 (October 2019), pp. 62‚Äì67. (pp. 63-64.) The use of p values, ever since, to determine the statistical significance of experimental results has contributed to an illusion of certainty and to reproducibility crises in many scientific fields,Lydia Denworth, \\"A Significant Problem: Standard scientific methods are under fire. Will anything change?\\", Scientific American, vol. 321, no. 4 (October 2019), pp. 62‚Äì67. (p. 63.) especially in experimental economics, biomedical research, and psychology.Lydia Denworth, \\"A Significant Problem: Standard scientific methods are under fire. Will anything change?\\", Scientific American, vol. 321, no. 4 (October 2019), pp. 62‚Äì67. (p. 64.) Every statistical model relies on a set of assumptions about how data are collected and analyzed and about how researchers decide to present their results. These results almost always center on null-hypothesis significance testing, which produces a p value. Such testing does not address the truth head-on but obliquely: significance testing is meant to indicate only whether a given line of research is worth pursuing further. It does not say how likely the hypothesis is to be true, but instead addresses an alternative question: if the hypothesis were false, how unlikely would the data be? The importance of \\"statistical significance\\", reflected in the p value, can be exaggerated or overemphasized ‚Äì something that readily occurs with small samples. That has caused replication crises. Some scientists have advocated \\"redefining statistical significance\\", shifting its threshold from 0.05 to 0.005 for claims of new discoveries. Others say such redefining does no good because the real problem is the very existence of a threshold.Lydia Denworth, \\"A Significant Problem: Standard scientific methods are under fire. Will anything change?\\", Scientific American, vol. 321, no. 4 (October 2019), pp. 62‚Äì67. (p. 67.) Some scientists prefer to use Bayesian methods, a more direct statistical approach which takes initial beliefs, adds in new evidence, and updates the beliefs. Another alternative procedure is to use the surprisal, a mathematical quantity that adjust p values to produce bits ‚Äì as in computer bits ‚Äì of information; in that perspective, 0.05 is a weak standard. When Ronald Fisher embraced the concept of \\"significance\\" in the early 20th century, it meant \\"signifying\\" but not \\"important\\". Statistical \\"significance\\" has, since, acquired am excessive connotation of confidence in the validity of the experimental results. Statistician Andrew Gelman says, \\"The original sin is people wanting certainty when it's not appropriate.\\" \\"Ultimately\\", writes Lydia Denworth, \\"a successful theory is one that stands up repeatedly to decades of scrutiny.\\" Increasingly, attention is being given to the principles of open science, such as publishing more detailed research protocols and requiring authors to follow prespecified analysis plans and to report when they deviate from them. Discovery =Discoveries and inventions= Fifty years before Florian Znaniecki published his 1923 paper proposing the creation of an empirical field of study to study the field of science, Aleksander G≈Çowacki (better known by his pen name, Boles≈Çaw Prus) had made the same proposal. In an 1873 public lecture \\"On Discoveries and Inventions\\",Boles≈Çaw Prus, On Discoveries and Inventions: A Public Lecture Delivered on 23 March 1873 by Aleksander G≈Çowacki [Boles≈Çaw Prus], Passed by the [Russian] Censor (Warsaw, 21 April 1873), Warsaw, Printed by F. Krokoszy≈Ñska, 1873. http://www.gutenberg.org/files/30407/30407-h/30407-h.htm Prus said: Prus defines \\"discovery\\" as \\"the finding out of a thing that has existed and exists in nature, but which was previously unknown to people\\";Boles≈Çaw Prus, On Discoveries and Inventions, p. 3. and \\"invention\\" as \\"the making of a thing that has not previously existed, and which nature itself cannot make.\\"Boles≈Çaw Prus, On Discoveries and Inventions, p. 4. He illustrates the concept of \\"discovery\\": Prus illustrates the concept of \\"invention\\": According to Prus, \\"inventions and discoveries are natural phenomena and, as such, are subject to certain laws.\\" Those are the laws of \\"gradualness\\", \\"dependence\\", and \\"combination\\".Boles≈Çaw Prus, On Discoveries and Inventions, p. 12. Each of Prus' three \\"laws\\" entails important corollaries. The law of gradualness implies the following:Boles≈Çaw Prus, On Discoveries and Inventions, p. 14. From the law of dependence flow the following corollaries: Finally, Prus' corollaries to his law of combination: {{blockquotea) Anyone who wants to be a successful inventor, needs to know a great many things‚Äîin the most diverse fields. For if a new invention is a combination of earlier inventions, then the inventor's mind is the ground on which, for the first time, various seemingly unrelated things combine. Example: The steam engine combines Rumford's double boiler, the pump, and the spinning wheel. [‚Ä¶] What is the connection among zinc, copper, sulfuric acid, a magnet, a clock mechanism, and an urgent message? All these had to come together in the mind of the inventor of the telegraph‚Ä¶ [‚Ä¶]Boles≈Çaw Prus, On Discoveries and Inventions, pp. 15‚Äì16. The greater the number of inventions that come into being, the more things a new inventor must know; the first, earliest and simplest inventions were made by completely uneducated people‚Äîbut today's inventions, particularly scientific ones, are products of the most highly educated minds. [‚Ä¶]Boles≈Çaw Prus, On Discoveries and Inventions, p. 16. b) A second corollary concerns societies that wish to have inventors. I said that a new invention is created by combining the most diverse objects; let us see where this takes us. Suppose I want to make an invention, and someone tells me: Take 100 different objects and bring them into contact with one another, first two at a time, then three at a time, finally four at a time, and you will arrive at a new invention. Imagine that I take a burning candle, charcoal, water, paper, zinc, sugar, sulfuric acid, and so on, 100 objects in all, and combine them with one another, that is, bring into contact first two at a time: charcoal with flame, water with flame, sugar with flame, zinc with flame, sugar with water, etc. Each time, I shall see a phenomenon: thus, in fire, sugar will melt, charcoal will burn, zinc will heat up, and so on. Now I will bring into contact three objects at a time, for example, sugar, zinc and flame; charcoal, sugar and flame; sulfuric acid, zinc and water; etc., and again I shall experience phenomena. Finally I bring into contact four objects at a time, for example, sugar, zinc, charcoal, and sulfuric acid. Ostensibly this is a very simple method, because in this fashion I could make not merely one but a dozen inventions. But will such an effort not exceed my capability? It certainly will. A hundred objects, combined in twos, threes and fours, will make over 4 million combinations; so if I made 100 combinations a day, it would take me over 110 years to exhaust them all!Boles≈Çaw Prus, On Discoveries and Inventions, pp. 16‚Äì17. But if by myself I am not up to the task, a sizable group of people will be. If 1,000 of us came together to produce the combinations that I have described, then any one person would only have to carry out slightly more than 4,000 combinations. If each of us performed just 10 combinations a day, together we would finish them all in less than a year and a half: 1,000 people would make an invention which a single man would have to spend more than 110 years to make‚Ä¶Boles≈Çaw Prus, On Discoveries and Inventions, p. 17. The conclusion is quite clear: a society that wants to win renown with its discoveries and inventions has to have a great many persons working in every branch of knowledge. One or a few men of learning and genius mean nothing today, or nearly nothing, because everything is now done by large numbers. I would like to offer the following simile: Inventions and discoveries are like a lottery; not every player wins, but from among the many players a few must win. The point is not that John or Paul, because they want to make an invention and because they work for it, shall make an invention; but where thousands want an invention and work for it, the invention must appear, as surely as an unsupported rock must fall to the ground.Boles≈Çaw Prus, On Discoveries and Inventions, p. 18. But, asks Prus, \\"What force drives [the] toilsome, often frustrated efforts [of the investigators]? What thread will clew these people through hitherto unexplored fields of study?\\"Boles≈Çaw Prus, On Discoveries and Inventions, p. 18. Prus holds that, over time, the multiplication of discoveries and inventions has improved the quality of people's lives and has expanded their knowledge. \\"This gradual advance of civilized societies, this constant growth in knowledge of the objects that exist in nature, this constant increase in the number of tools and useful materials, is termed progress, or the growth of civilization.\\"Boles≈Çaw Prus, On Discoveries and Inventions, p. 5. Conversely, Prus warns, \\"societies and people that do not make inventions or know how to use them, lead miserable lives and ultimately perish.\\"Boles≈Çaw Prus, On Discoveries and Inventions, p. 24. =Reproducibility= A fundamental feature of the scientific enterprise is reproducibility of results. \\"For decades\\", writes Shannon Palus, \\"it has been... an open secret that a [considerable part] of the literature in some fields is plain wrong.\\" This effectively sabotages the scientific enterprise and costs the world many billions of dollars annually in wasted resources. Militating against reproducibility is scientists' reluctance to share techniques, for fear of forfeiting one's advantage to other scientists. Also, scientific journals and tenure committees tend to prize impressive new results rather than gradual advances that systematically build on existing literature. Scientists who quietly fact-check others' work or spend extra time ensuring that their own protocols are easy for other researchers to understand, gain little for themselves.Shannon Palus, \\"Make Research Reproducible: Better incentives could reduce the alarming number of studies that turn out to be wrong when repeated\\" (State of the World's Science, 2018), Scientific American, vol. 319, no. 4 (October 2018), p. 58. With a view to improving reproducibility of scientific results, it has been suggested that research- funding agencies finance only projects that include a plan for making their work transparent. In 2016 the U.S. National Institutes of Health introduced new application instructions and review questions to encourage scientists to improve reproducibility. The NIH requests more information on how the study builds on previous work, and a list of variables that could affect the study, such as the sex of animal subjects‚Äîa previously overlooked factor that led many studies to describe phenomena found in male animals as universal.Shannon Palus, \\"Make Research Reproducible\\", Scientific American, vol. 319, no. 4 (October 2018), p. 59. Likewise, the questions that a funder can ask in advance could be asked by journals and reviewers. One solution is \\"registered reports\\", a preregistration of studies whereby a scientist submits, for publication, research analysis and design plans before actually doing the study. Peer reviewers then evaluate the methodology, and the journal promises to print the results, no matter what they are. In order to prevent over- reliance on preregistered studies‚Äîwhich could encourage safer, less venturesome research, thus over-correcting the problem‚Äîthe preregistered- studies model could be operated in tandem with the traditional results-focused model, which may sometimes be more friendly to serendipitous discoveries. =Rediscovery= A 2016 Scientific American report highlights the role of rediscovery in science. Indiana University Bloomington researchers combed through 22 million scientific papers published over the previous century and found dozens of \\"Sleeping Beauties\\"‚Äîstudies that lay dormant for years before getting noticed.Amber Williams, \\"Sleeping Beauties of Science: Some of the best research can slumber for years\\", Scientific American, vol. 314, no. 1 (January 2016), p. 80. The top finds, which languished longest and later received the most intense attention from scientists, came from the fields of chemistry, physics, and statistics. The dormant findings were wakened by scientists from other disciplines, such as medicine, in search of fresh insights, and by the ability to test once-theoretical postulations. Sleeping Beauties will likely become even more common in the future because of increasing accessibility of scientific literature. The Scientific American report lists the top 15 Sleeping Beauties: 7 in chemistry, 5 in physics, 2 in statistics, and 1 in metallurgy. Examples include: Herbert Freundlich's \\"Concerning Adsorption in Solutions\\" (1906), the first mathematical model of adsorption, when atoms or molecules adhere to a surface. Today both environmental remediation and decontamination in industrial settings rely heavily on adsorption. A. Einstein, B. Podolsky and N. Rosen, \\"Can Quantum- Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?\\" Physical Review, vol. 47 (May 15, 1935), pp. 777‚Äì780. This famous thought experiment in quantum physics‚Äînow known as the EPR paradox, after the authors' surname initials‚Äîwas discussed theoretically when it first came out. It was not until the 1970s that physics had the experimental means to test quantum entanglement. J[ohn] Turkevich, P. C. Stevenson, J. Hillier, \\"A Study of the Nucleation and Growth Processes in the Synthesis of Colloidal Gold\\", Discuss. Faraday. Soc., 1951, 11, pp. 55‚Äì75, explains how to suspend gold nanoparticles in liquid. It owes its awakening to medicine, which now employs gold nanoparticles to detect tumors and deliver drugs. William S. Hummers and Richard E Offeman, \\"Preparation of Graphitic Oxide\\", Journal of the American Chemical Society, vol. 80, no. 6 (March 20, 1958), p. 1339, introduced Hummers' Method, a technique for making graphite oxide. Recent interest in graphene's potential has brought the 1958 paper to attention. Graphite oxide could serve as a reliable intermediate for the 2-D material. =Multiple discovery= Historians and sociologists have remarked the occurrence, in science, of \\"multiple independent discovery\\". Sociologist Robert K. Merton defined such \\"multiples\\" as instances in which similar discoveries are made by scientists working independently of each other. Reprinted in Robert K. Merton, The Sociology of Science: Theoretical and Empirical Investigations, Chicago, University of Chicago Press,1973, pp. 371‚Äì82. \\"Sometimes the discoveries are simultaneous or almost so; sometimes a scientist will make a new discovery which, unknown to him, somebody else has made years before.\\"Merton's hypothesis is also discussed extensively in Harriet Zuckerman, Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United States, Free Press, 1979. Commonly cited examples of multiple independent discovery are the 17th-century independent formulation of calculus by Isaac Newton, Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, and others; the 18th-century independent discovery of oxygen by Carl Wilhelm Scheele, Joseph Priestley, Antoine Lavoisier, and others; and the 19th-century independent formulation of the theory of evolution of species by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace.Tori Reeve, Down House: the Home of Charles Darwin, pp. 40-41. Merton contrasted a \\"multiple\\" with a \\"singleton\\" ‚Äî a discovery that has been made uniquely by a single scientist or group of scientists working together.Robert K. Merton, On Social Structure and Science, p. 307. He believed that it is multiple discoveries, rather than unique ones, that represent the common pattern in science.Robert K. Merton, \\"Singletons and Multiples in Scientific Discovery: a Chapter in the Sociology of Science,\\" Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, 105: 470‚Äì86, 1961. Reprinted in Robert K. Merton, The Sociology of Science: Theoretical and Empirical Investigations, Chicago, University of Chicago Press, 1973, pp. 343‚Äì70. Multiple discoveries in the history of science provide evidence for evolutionary models of science and technology, such as memetics (the study of self-replicating units of culture), evolutionary epistemology (which applies the concepts of biological evolution to study of the growth of human knowledge), and cultural selection theory (which studies sociological and cultural evolution in a Darwinian manner). A recombinant-DNA-inspired \\"paradigm of paradigms\\", describing a mechanism of \\"recombinant conceptualization\\", predicates that a new concept arises through the crossing of pre-existing concepts and facts. This is what is meant when one says that a scientist, scholar, or artist has been \\"influenced by\\" another ‚Äî etymologically, that a concept of the latter's has \\"flowed into\\" the mind of the former.Christopher Kasparek, \\"Prus' Pharaoh: the Creation of a Historical Novel,\\" The Polish Review, vol. XXXIX, no. 1 (1994), pp. 45-46. The phenomenon of multiple independent discoveries and inventions can be viewed as a consequence of Boles≈Çaw Prus' three laws of gradualness, dependence, and combination (see \\"Discoveries and inventions\\", above). The first two laws may, in turn, be seen as corollaries to the third law, since the laws of gradualness and dependence imply the impossibility of certain scientific or technological advances pending the availability of certain theories, facts, or technologies that must be combined to produce a given scientific or technological advance. =Technology= Technology ‚Äì the application of discoveries to practical matters ‚Äì showed a remarkable acceleration in what economist Robert J. Gordon has identified as \\"the special century\\" that spanned the period up to 1970. By then, he writes, all the key technologies of modern life were in place: sanitation, electricity, mechanized agriculture, highways, air travel, telecommunications, and the like. The one signature technology of the 21st century has been the iPhone. Meanwhile a long list of much-publicized potential major technologies remain in the prototype phase, including self-driving cars, flying cars, augmented-reality glasses, gene therapy, and nuclear fusion. An urgent goal for the 21st century, writes Gordon, is to undo some of the consequences of the last great technology boom by developing affordable zero- and negative-emissions technologies.Wade Roush, \\"The Big Slowdown: Major technological shifts are fewer and farther between than they once were\\", Scientific American, vol. 321, no. 2 (August 2019), p. 24. Technology is the sum of techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Paradoxically, technology, so conceived, has sometimes been noted to take primacy over the ends themselves ‚Äì even to their detriment. Laura Grego and David Wright, writing in 2019 in Scientific American, observe that \\"Current U.S. missile defense plans are being driven largely by technology, politics and fear. Missile defenses will not allow us to escape our vulnerability to nuclear weapons. Instead large-scale developments will create barriers to taking real steps toward reducing nuclear risks‚Äîby blocking further cuts in nuclear arsenals and potentially spurring new deployments.\\"Laura Grego and David Wright, \\"Broken Shield: Missiles designed to destroy incoming nuclear warheads fail frequently in tests and could increase global risk of mass destruction\\", Scientific American, vol. 320, no. no. 6 (June 2019), pp. 62‚Äì67. (p. 67.) Psychology of science =Habitus= Yale University physicist-astronomer Priyamvada Natarajan, writing of the virtually-simultaneous 1846 discovery of the planet Neptune by Urbain Le Verrier and John Couch Adams (after other astronomers, as early as Galileo Galilei in 1612, had unwittingly observed the planet), comments: =Nonconformance= A practical question concerns the traits that enable some individuals to achieve extraordinary results in their fields of work‚Äîand how such creativity can be fostered. Melissa Schilling, a student of innovation strategy, has identified some traits shared by eight major innovators in natural science or technology: Benjamin Franklin (1706‚Äì90), Thomas Edison (1847‚Äì1931), Nikola Tesla (1856‚Äì1943), Maria Sk≈Çodowska Curie (1867‚Äì1934), Dean Kamen (born 1951), Steve Jobs (1955‚Äì2011), Albert Einstein (1879‚Äì1955), and Elon Musk (born 1971).Melissa A. Schilling, Quirky: The Remarkable Story of the Traits, Foibles, and Genius of Breakthrough Innovators Who Changed the World, New York, Public Affairs, 2018, , p. 13. Schilling chose innovators in natural science and technology rather than in other fields because she found much more consensus about important contributions to natural science and technology than, for example, to art or music.Melissa A. Schilling, Quirky: The Remarkable Story of the Traits, Foibles, and Genius of Breakthrough Innovators Who Changed the World, New York, Public Affairs, 2018, , p. 11. She further limited the set to individuals associated with multiple innovations. \\"When an individual is associated with only a single major invention, it is much harder to know whether the invention was caused by the inventor's personal characteristics or by simply being at the right place at the right time.\\"Melissa A. Schilling, Quirky: The Remarkable Story of the Traits, Foibles, and Genius of Breakthrough Innovators Who Changed the World, New York, Public Affairs, 2018, , p. 12. The eight individuals were all extremely intelligent, but \\"that is not enough to make someone a serial breakthrough innovator.\\" Nearly all these innovators showed very high levels of social detachment, or separateness (a notable exception being Benjamin Franklin).Melissa A. Schilling, Quirky: The Remarkable Story of the Traits, Foibles, and Genius of Breakthrough Innovators Who Changed the World, New York, Public Affairs, 2018, , p. 35. \\"Their isolation meant that they were less exposed to dominant ideas and norms, and their sense of not belonging meant that even when exposed to dominant ideas and norms, they were often less inclined to adopt them.\\"Melissa A. Schilling, Quirky: The Remarkable Story of the Traits, Foibles, and Genius of Breakthrough Innovators Who Changed the World, New York, Public Affairs, 2018, , p. 14. From an early age, they had all shown extreme faith in their ability to overcome obstacles‚Äîwhat psychology calls \\"self-efficacy\\". \\"Most [of them, writes Schilling] were driven by idealism, a superordinate goal that was more important than their own comfort, reputation, or families. Nikola Tesla wanted to free mankind from labor through unlimited free energy and to achieve international peace through global communication. Elon Musk wants to solve the world's energy problems and colonize Mars. Benjamin Franklin was seeking greater social harmony and productivity through the ideals of egalitarianism, tolerance, industriousness, temperance, and charity. Marie Curie had been inspired by Polish Positivism's argument that Poland, which was under Tsarist Russian rule, could be preserved only through the pursuit of education and technological advance by all Poles‚Äîincluding women.\\"Melissa A. Schilling, Quirky: The Remarkable Story of the Traits, Foibles, and Genius of Breakthrough Innovators Who Changed the World, New York, Public Affairs, 2018, , p. 15. Most of the innovators also worked hard and tirelessly because they found work extremely rewarding. Some had an extremely high need for achievement. Many also appeared to find work autotelic‚Äîrewarding for its own sake.Melissa A. Schilling, Quirky: The Remarkable Story of the Traits, Foibles, and Genius of Breakthrough Innovators Who Changed the World, New York, Public Affairs, 2018, , p. 16. A surprisingly large portion of the breakthrough innovators have been autodidacts‚Äîself-taught persons‚Äîand excelled much more outside the classroom than inside.Melissa A. Schilling, Quirky: The Remarkable Story of the Traits, Foibles, and Genius of Breakthrough Innovators Who Changed the World, New York, Public Affairs, 2018, , p. 17. \\"Almost all breakthrough innovation,\\" writes Schilling, \\"starts with an unusual idea or with beliefs that break with conventional wisdom.... However, creative ideas alone are almost never enough. Many people have creative ideas, even brilliant ones. But usually we lack the time, knowledge, money, or motivation to act on those ideas.\\" It is generally hard to get others' help in implementing original ideas because the ideas are often initially hard for others to understand and value. Thus each of Schilling's breakthrough innovators showed extraordinary effort and persistence.Melissa A. Schilling, Quirky: The Remarkable Story of the Traits, Foibles, and Genius of Breakthrough Innovators Who Changed the World, New York, Public Affairs, 2018, , pp. 17‚Äì18. Even so, writes Schilling, \\"being at the right place at the right time still matter[ed].\\"Melissa A. Schilling, Quirky: The Remarkable Story of the Traits, Foibles, and Genius of Breakthrough Innovators Who Changed the World, New York, Public Affairs, 2018, , p. 18. Lichenology When Swiss botanist Simon Schwendener discovered in the 1860s that lichens were a symbiotic partnership between a fungus and an alga, his finding at first met with resistance from the scientific community. After his discovery that the fungus‚Äîwhich cannot make its own food‚Äîprovides the lichen's structure, while the alga's contribution is its photosynthetic production of food, it was found that in some lichens a cyanobacterium provides the food‚Äîand a handful of lichen species contain both an alga and a cyanobacterium, along with the fungus.Erica Gies, \\"The Meaning of Lichen: How a self-taught naturalist unearthed hidden symbioses in the wilds of British Columbia‚Äîand helped to overturn 150 years of accepted scientific wisdom\\", Scientific American, vol. 316, no. 6 (June 2017), p. 56. A self-taught naturalist, Trevor Goward, has helped create a paradigm shift in the study of lichens and perhaps of all life-forms by doing something that people did in pre-scientific times: going out into nature and closely observing. His essays about lichens were largely ignored by most researchers because Goward has no scientific degrees and because some of his radical ideas are not supported by rigorous data.Erica Gies, \\"The Meaning of Lichen\\", Scientific American, vol. 316, no. 6 (June 2017), pp. 54‚Äì55. When Goward told Toby Spribille, who at the time lacked a high-school education, about some of his lichenological ideas, Goward recalls, \\"He said I was delusional.\\" Ultimately Spribille passed a high-school equivalency examination, obtained a Ph.D. in lichenology at the University of Graz in Austria, and became an assistant professor of the ecology and evolution of symbiosis at the University of Alberta. In July 2016 Spribille and his co-authors published a ground-breaking paper in Science revealing that many lichens contain a second fungus. Spribille credits Goward with having \\"a huge influence on my thinking. [His essays] gave me license to think about lichens in [an unorthodox way] and freed me to see the patterns I worked out in Bryoria with my co-authors.\\" Even so, \\"one of the most difficult things was allowing myself to have an open mind to the idea that 150 years of literature may have entirely missed the theoretical possibility that there would be more than one fungal partner in the lichen symbiosis.\\" Spribille says that academia's emphasis on the canon of what others have established as important is inherently limiting.Erica Gies, \\"The Meaning of Lichen\\", Scientific American, vol. 316, no. 6 (June 2017), pp. 57‚Äì58. =Leadership= Contrary to previous studies indicating that higher intelligence makes for better leaders in various fields of endeavor, later research suggests that, at a certain point, a higher IQ can be viewed as harmful.Matthew Hutson, \\"Ineffective Geniuses?: People with very high IQs can be perceived as worse leaders\\", Scientific American, vol. 318, no. 3 (March 2018), p. 20. Decades ago, psychologist Dean Simonton suggested that brilliant leaders' words may go over people's heads, their solutions could be more complicated to implement, and followers might find it harder to relate to them. At last, in the July 2017 Journal of Applied Psychology, he and two colleagues published the results of actual tests of the hypothesis. Studied were 379 men and women business leaders in 30 countries, including the fields of banking, retail, and technology. The managers took IQ tests‚Äîan imperfect but robust predictor of performance in many areas‚Äîand each was rated on leadership style and effectiveness by an average of 8 co-workers. IQ correlated positively with ratings of leadership effectiveness, strategy formation, vision, and several other characteristics‚Äîup to a point. The ratings peaked at an IQ of about 120, which is higher than some 80% of office workers. Beyond that, the ratings declined. The researchers suggested that the ideal IQ could be higher or lower in various fields, depending on whether technical or social skills are more valued in a given work culture. Psychologist Paul Sackett, not involved in the research, comments: \\"To me, the right interpretation of the work would be that it highlights a need to understand what high-IQ leaders do that leads to lower perceptions by followers. The wrong interpretation would be,'Don't hire high- IQ leaders.'\\" The study's lead author, psychologist John Antonakis, suggests that leaders should use their intelligence to generate creative metaphors that will persuade and inspire others. \\"I think the only way a smart person can signal their intelligence appropriately and still connect with the people,\\" says Antonakis, \\"is to speak in charismatic ways.\\" Sociology of science =Specialization= Academic specialization produces great benefits for science and technology by focusing effort on discrete disciplines. But excessively narrow specialization can act as a roadblock to productive collaboration between traditional disciplines. In 2017, in Manhattan, James Harris Simons, a noted mathematician and retired founder of one of the world's largest hedge funds, inaugurated the Flatiron Institute, a nonprofit enterprise whose goal is to apply his hedge fund's analytical strategies to projects dedicated to expanding knowledge and helping humanity.D.T. Max, \\"The Numbers King: Algorithms made Jim Simons a Wall Street billionaire. His new research center helps scientists mine data for the common good\\", The New Yorker, 18 & 25 December 2017, p. 72. He has established computational divisions for research in astrophysics, biology, and quantum physics,D.T. Max, \\"The Numbers King: Algorithms made Jim Simons a Wall Street billionaire. His new research center helps scientists mine data for the common good\\", The New Yorker, 18 & 25 December 2017, p. 76. and an interdisciplinary division for climate modelling that interfaces geology, oceanography, atmospheric science, biology, and climatology.D.T. Max, \\"The Numbers King: Algorithms made Jim Simons a Wall Street billionaire. His new research center helps scientists mine data for the common good\\", The New Yorker, 18 & 25 December 2017, p. 83. The latter, fourth Flatiron Institute division was inspired by a 2017 presentation to the Institute's leadership by John Grotzinger, a \\"bio- geoscientist\\" from the California Institute of Technology, who explained the challenges of climate modelling. Grotzinger was a specialist in historical climate change‚Äîspecifically, what had caused the great Permian extinction, during which virtually all species died. To properly assess this cataclysm, one had to understand both the rock record and the ocean's composition, but geologists did not interact much with physical oceanographers. Grotzinger's own best collaboration had resulted from a fortuitous lunch with an oceanographer. Climate modelling was an intrinsically difficult problem made worse by academia's structural divisions. \\"If you had it all under one umbrella... it could result [much sooner] in a major breakthrough.\\" Simons and his team found Grotzinger's presentation compelling, and the Flatiron Institute decided to establish its fourth and final computational division. =Mentoring= Sociologist Harriet Zuckerman, in her 1977 study of natural- science Nobel laureates in the United States, was struck by the fact that more than half (48) of the 92 laureates who did their prize-winning research in the U.S. by 1972 had worked either as students, postdoctorates, or junior collaborators under older Nobel laureates. Furthermore, those 48 future laureates had worked under a total of 71 laureate masters.Harriet Zuckerman, Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United States, New York, The Free Press, 1977, pp. 99‚Äì100. Social viscosity ensures that not every qualified novice scientist attains access to the most productive centers of scientific thought. Nevertheless, writes Zuckerman, \\"To some extent, students of promise can choose masters with whom to work and masters can choose among the cohorts of students who present themselves for study. This process of bilateral assortative selection is conspicuously at work among the ultra-elite of science. Actual and prospective members of that elite select their scientist parents and therewith their scientist ancestors just as later they select their scientist progeny and therewith their scientist descendants.\\"Harriet Zuckerman, Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United States, New York, The Free Press, 1977, p. 104. Zuckerman writes: \\"[T]he lines of elite apprentices to elite masters who had themselves been elite apprentices, and so on indefinitely, often reach far back into the history of science, long before 1900, when [Alfred] Nobel's will inaugurated what now amounts to the International Academy of Sciences. As an example of the many long historical chains of elite masters and apprentices, consider the German-born English laureate Hans Krebs (1953), who traces his scientific lineage [...] back through his master, the 1931 laureate Otto Warburg. Warburg had studied with Emil Fis[c]her [1852‚Äì1919], recipient of a prize in 1902 at the age of 50, three years before it was awarded [in 1905] to his teacher, Adolf von Baeyer [1835‚Äì1917], at age 70. This lineage of four Nobel masters and apprentices has its own pre-Nobelian antecedents. Von Baeyer had been the apprentice of F[riedrich] A[ugust] Kekul√© [1829‚Äì96], whose ideas of structural formulae revolutionized organic chemistry and who is perhaps best known for the often retold story about his having hit upon the ring structure of benzene in a dream (1865). Kekul√© himself had been trained by the great organic chemist Justus von Liebig (1803‚Äì73), who had studied at the Sorbonne with the master J[oseph] L[ouis] Gay-Lussac (1778‚Äì1850), himself once apprenticed to Claude Louis Berthollet (1748‚Äì1822). Among his many institutional and cognitive accomplishments, Berthollet helped found the √âcole Polytechnique, served as science advisor to Napoleon in Egypt, and, more significant for our purposes here, worked with [Antoine] Lavoisier [1743‚Äì94] to revise the standard system of chemical nomenclature.\\"Harriet Zuckerman, Scientific Elite: Nobel Laureates in the United States, New York, The Free Press, 1977, p. 105. =Collaboration= Sociologist Michael P. Farrell has studied close creative groups and writes: \\"Most of the fragile insights that laid the foundation of a new vision emerged not when the whole group was together, and not when members worked alone, but when they collaborated and repsonded to one another in pairs.\\"Michael P. Farrell, Collaborative Circles: Friendship Dynamics and Creative Work, 2001, quoted in James Somers, \\"Binary Stars: The friendship that made Google huge\\", The New York Review of Books, 10 December 2018, p. 30. Fran√ßois Jacob, who, with Jacques Monod, pioneered the study of gene regulation, notes that by the mid-20th century, most research in molecular biology was conducted by twosomes. \\"Two are better than one for dreaming up theories and constructing models,\\" writes Jacob. \\"For with two minds working on a problem, ideas fly thicker and faster. They are bounced from partner to partner.... And in the process, illusions are sooner nipped in the bud.\\" As of 2018, in the previous 35 years, some half of Nobel Prizes in Physiology or Medicine had gone to scientific partnerships.James Somers, \\"Binary Stars: The friendship that made Google huge\\", The New York Review of Books, 10 December 2018, p. 31. James Somers describes a remarkable partnership between Google's top software engineers, Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat.James Somers, \\"Binary Stars: The friendship that made Google huge\\", The New York Review of Books, 10 December 2018, pp. 28‚Äì35. Twosome collaborations have also been prominent in creative endeavors outside the natural sciences and technology; examples are Monet's and Renoir's 1869 joint creation of Impressionism, Pablo Picasso's and Georges Braque's six-year collaborative creation of Cubism, and John Lennon's and Paul McCartney's collaborations on Beatles songs. \\"Everyone\\", writes James Somers, \\"falls into creative ruts, but two people rarely do so at the same time.\\"James Somers, \\"Binary Stars: The friendship that made Google huge\\", The New York Review of Books, 10 December 2018, pp. 30‚Äì31. The same point was made by Francis Crick, member of what may be history's most famous scientific duo, Francis Crick and James Watson, who together discovered the structure of the genetic material, DNA. At the end of a PBS television documentary on James Watson, in a video clipping Crick explains to Watson that their collaboration had been crucial to their discovery because, when one of them was wrong, the other would set him straight.\\"American Masters: Decoding Watson\\", PBS \\"American Masters\\" series, season 32, episode 9 (2019), first aired on 2 January 2019. =Politics= Big Science What has been dubbed \\"Big Science\\" emerged from the United States' World War II Manhattan Project that produced the world's first nuclear weapons; and Big Science has since been associated with physics, which requires massive particle accelerators. In biology, Big Science debuted in 1990 with the Human Genome Project to sequence human DNA. In 2013 neuroscience became a Big Science domain when the U.S. announced a BRAIN Initiative and the European Union announced a Human Brain Project. Major new brain-research initiatives were also announced by Israel, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, and China.Stefan Theil, \\"Trouble in Mind: Two years in, a $1-billion-plus effort to simulate the human brain is in disarray. Was it poor management, or is something fundamentally wrong with Big Science?\\", Scientific American, vol. 313, no. 4 (October 2015), p. 38. Earlier successful Big Science projects had habituated politicians, mass media, and the public to view Big Science programs with sometimes uncritical favor.Stefan Theil, \\"Trouble in Mind\\", Scientific American, vol. 313, no. 4 (October 2015), p. 42. The U.S.'s BRAIN Initiative was inspired by concern about the spread and cost of mental disorders and by excitement about new brain-manipulation technologies such as optogenetics.Stefan Theil, \\"Trouble in Mind\\", Scientific American, vol. 313, no. 4 (October 2015), p. 39. After some early false starts, the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health let the country's brain scientists define the BRAIN Initiative, and this led to an ambitious interdisciplinary program to develop new technological tools to better monitor, measure, and simulate the brain. Competition in research was ensured by the National Institute of Mental Health's peer-review process. In the European Union, the European Commission's Human Brain Project got off to a rockier start because political and economic considerations obscured questions concerning the feasibility of the Project's initial scientific program, based principally on computer modeling of neural circuits. Four years earlier, in 2009, fearing that the European Union would fall further behind the U.S. in computer and other technologies, the European Union had begun creating a competition for Big Science projects, and the initial program for the Human Brain Project seemed a good fit for a European program that might take a lead in advanced and emerging technologies. Only in 2015, after over 800 European neuroscientists threatened to boycott the European-wide collaboration, were changes introduced into the Human Brain Project, supplanting many of the original political and economic considerations with scientific ones.Stefan Theil, \\"Trouble in Mind\\", Scientific American, vol. 313, no. 4 (October 2015), pp. 38-39. As of 2019, the European Union's Human Brain Project had not lived up to its extravagant promise.Ed Yong, \\"The Human Brain Project Hasn't Lived Up to Its Promise: Ten years ago, a neuroscientist said that within a decade he could simulate a human brain. Spoiler: It didn't happen\\", The Atlantic, 22 July 2019. =Funding= Government funding Nathan Myhrvold, former Microsoft chief technology officer and founder of Microsoft Research, argues that the funding of basic science cannot be left to the private sector‚Äîthat \\"without government resources, basic science will grind to a halt.\\"Nathan Myhrvold, \\"Even Genius Needs a Benefactor: Without government resources, basic science will grind to a halt\\", Scientific American, vol. 314, no. 2 (February 2016), p. 11. He notes that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, published in 1915, did not spring full-blown from his brain in a eureka moment; he worked at it for years‚Äîfinally driven to complete it by a rivalry with mathematician David Hilbert. The history of almost any iconic scientific discovery or technological invention‚Äîthe lightbulb, the transistor, DNA, even the Internet‚Äîshows that the famous names credited with the breakthrough \\"were only a few steps ahead of a pack of competitors.\\" Some writers and elected officials have used this phenomenon of \\"parallel innovation\\" to argue against public financing of basic research: government, they assert, should leave it to companies to finance the research they need. Myhrvold writes that such arguments are dangerously wrong: without government support, most basic scientific research will never happen. \\"This is most clearly true for the kind of pure research that has delivered... great intellectual benefits but no profits, such as the work that brought us the Higgs boson, or the understanding that a supermassive black hole sits at the center of the Milky Way, or the discovery of methane seas on the surface of Saturn's moon Titan. Company research laboratories used to do this kind of work: experimental evidence for the Big Bang was discovered at AT&T;'s Bell Labs, resulting in a Nobel Prize. Now those days are gone.\\" Even in applied fields such as materials science and computer science, writes Myhrvold, \\"companies now understand that basic research is a form of charity‚Äîso they avoid it.\\" Bell Labs scientists created the transistor, but that invention earned billions for Intel and Microsoft. Xerox PARC engineers invented the modern graphical user interface, but Apple and Microsoft profited most. IBM researchers pioneered the use of giant magnetoresistance to boost hard-disk capacity but soon lost the disk-drive business to Seagate and Western Digital. Company researchers now have to focus narrowly on innovations that can quickly bring revenue; otherwise the research budget could not be justified to the company's investors. \\"Those who believe profit-driven companies will altruistically pay for basic science that has wide-ranging benefits‚Äîbut mostly to others and not for a generation‚Äîare naive.... If government were to leave it to the private sector to pay for basic research, most science would come to a screeching halt. What research survived would be done largely in secret, for fear of handing the next big thing to a rival.\\" Governmental investment is equally vital in the field of biological research. According to William A. Haseltine, a former Harvard Medical School professor and founder of that university's cancer and HIV / AIDS research departments, early efforts to control the Covid-19 pandemic were hampered by governments and industry everywhere having \\"pulled the plug on coronavirus research funding in 2006 after the first SARS [...] pandemic faded away and again in the years immediately following the MERS [outbreak, also caused by a coronavirus] when it seemed to be controllable.William A. Haseltine, \\"What We Learned from AIDS: Lessons from another pandemic for fighting COVID‚Äì19\\", Scientific American, vol. 323, no. 4 (October 2020), pp. 36‚Äì41. (p. 40.) [...] The development of promising anti- SARS and MERS drugs, which might have been active against SARS‚ÄìCoV-2 [in the Covid-19 pandemic] as well, was left unfinished for lack of money.\\"William A. Haseltine, \\"What We Learned from AIDS: Lessons from another pandemic for fighting COVID‚Äì19\\", Scientific American, vol. 323, no. 4 (October 2020), pp. 36‚Äì41. (p. 41.) Haseltine continues: Private funding A complementary perspective on the funding of scientific research is given by D.T. Max, writing about the Flatiron Institute, a computational center set up in 2017 in Manhattan to provide scientists with mathematical assistance. The Flatiron Institute was established by James Harris Simons, a mathematician who had used mathematical algorithms to make himself a Wall Street billionaire. The Institute has three computational divisions dedicated respectively to astrophysics, biology, and quantum physics, and is working on a fourth division for climate modeling that will involve interfaces of geology, oceanography, atmospheric science, biology, and climatology. The Flatiron Institute is part of a trend in the sciences toward privately funded research. In the United States, basic science has traditionally been financed by universities or the government, but private institutes are often faster and more focused. Since the 1990s, when Silicon Valley began producing billionaires, private institutes have sprung up across the U.S. In 1997 Larry Ellison launched the Ellison Medical Foundation to study the biology of aging. In 2003 Paul Allen founded the Allen Institute for Brain Science. In 2010 Eric Schmidt founded the Schmidt Ocean Institute.D.T. Max, \\"The Numbers King: Algorithms made Jim Simons a Wall Street billionaire. His new research center helps scientists mine data for the common good\\", The New Yorker, 18 & 25 December 2017, p. 75. These institutes have done much good, partly by providing alternatives to more rigid systems. But private foundations also have liabilities. Wealthy benefactors tend to direct their funding toward their personal enthusiasms. And foundations are not taxed; much of the money that supports them would otherwise have gone to the government. Funding biases John P.A. Ioannidis, of Stanford University Medical School, writes that \\"There is increasing evidence that some of the ways we conduct, evaluate, report and disseminate research are miserably ineffective. A series of papers in 2014 in The Lancet... estimated that 85 percent of investment in biomedical research is wasted. Many other disciplines have similar problems.\\"John P.A. Ioannidis, \\"Rethink Funding: The way we pay for science does not encourage the best results\\" (State of the World's Science, 2018), Scientific American, vol. 319, no. 4 (October 2018), p. 54. Ioannidis identifies some science-funding biases that undermine the efficiency of the scientific enterprise, and proposes solutions: Funding too few scientists: \\"[M]ajor success [in scientific research] is largely the result of luck, as well as hard work. The investigators currently enjoying huge funding are not necessarily genuine superstars; they may simply be the best connected.\\" Solutions: \\"Use a lottery to decide which grant applications to fund (perhaps after they pass a basic review).... Shift... funds from senior people to younger researchers...\\" No reward for transparency: \\"Many scientific protocols, analysis methods, computational processes and data are opaque. [M]any top findings cannot be reproduced. That is the case for two out of three top psychology papers, one out of three top papers in experimental economics and more than 75 percent of top papers identifying new cancer drug targets. [S]cientists are not rewarded for sharing their techniques.\\" Solutions: \\"Create better infrastructure for enabling transparency, openness and sharing. Make transparency a prerequisite for funding. [P]referentially hire, promote or tenure... champions of transparency.\\" No encouragement for replication: Replication is indispensable to the scientific method. Yet, under pressure to produce new discoveries, researchers tend to have little incentive, and much counterincentive, to try replicating results of previous studies. Solutions: \\"Funding agencies must pay for replication studies. Scientists' advancement should be based not only on their discoveries but also on their replication track record.\\" No funding for young scientists: \\"Werner Heisenberg, Albert Einstein, Paul Dirac and Wolfgang Pauli made their top contributions in their mid-20s.\\" But the average age of biomedical scientists receiving their first substantial grant is 46. The average age for a full professor in the U.S. is 55. Solutions: \\"A larger proportion of funding should be earmarked for young investigators. Universities should try to shift the aging distribution of their faculty by hiring more young investigators.\\" Biased funding sources: \\"Most funding for research and development in the U.S. comes not from the government but from private, for-profit sources, raising unavoidable conflicts of interest and pressure to deliver results favorable to the sponsor.\\" Solutions: \\"Restrict or even ban funding that has overt conflicts of interest. Journals should not accept research with such conflicts. For less conspicuous conflicts, at a minimum ensure transparent and thorough disclosure.\\"John P.A. Ioannidis, \\"Rethink Funding: The way we pay for science does not encourage the best results\\" (State of the World's Science, 2018), Scientific American, vol. 319, no. 4 (October 2018), p. 55. Funding the wrong fields: \\"Well-funded fields attract more scientists to work for them, which increases their lobbying reach, fueling a vicious circle. Some entrenched fields absorb enormous funding even though they have clearly demonstrated limited yield or uncorrectable flaws.\\" Solutions: \\"Independent, impartial assessment of output is necessary for lavishly funded fields. More funds should be earmarked for new fields and fields that are high risk. Researchers should be encouraged to switch fields, whereas currently they are incentivized to focus in one area.\\" Not spending enough: The U.S. military budget ($886 billion) is 24 times the budget of the National Institutes of Health ($37 billion). \\"Investment in science benefits society at large, yet attempts to convince the public often make matters worse when otherwise well-intentioned science leaders promise the impossible, such as promptly eliminating all cancer or Alzheimer's disease.\\" Solutions: \\"We need to communicate how science funding is used by making the process of science clearer, including the number of scientists it takes to make major accomplishments.... We would also make a more convincing case for science if we could show that we do work hard on improving how we run it.\\" Rewarding big spenders: \\"Hiring, promotion and tenure decisions primarily rest on a researcher's ability to secure high levels of funding. But the expense of a project does not necessarily correlate with its importance. Such reward structures select mostly for politically savvy managers who know how to absorb money.\\" Solutions: \\"We should reward scientists for high-quality work, reproducibility and social value rather than for securing funding. Excellent research can be done with little to no funding other than protected time. Institutions should provide this time and respect scientists who can do great work without wasting tons of money.\\" No funding for high-risk ideas: \\"The pressure that taxpayer money be 'well spent' leads government funders to back projects most likely to pay off with a positive result, even if riskier projects might lead to more important, but less assured, advances. Industry also avoids investing in high-risk projects... Innovation is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to predict...\\" Solutions: \\"Fund excellent scientists rather than projects and give them freedom to pursue research avenues as they see fit. Some institutions such as Howard Hughes Medical Institute already use this model with success.\\" It must be communicated to the public and to policy-makers that science is a cumulative investment, that no one can know in advance which projects will succeed, and that success must be judged on the total agenda, not on a single experiment or result. Lack of good data: \\"There is relatively limited evidence about which scientific practices work best. We need more research on research ('meta-research') to understand how to best perform, evaluate, review, disseminate and reward science.\\" Solutions: \\"We should invest in studying how to get the best science and how to choose and reward the best scientists.\\" =Sexual bias= Claire Pomeroy, president of the Lasker Foundation, which is dedicated to advancing medical research, points out that women scientists continue to be subjected to discrimination in professional advancement.Claire Pomeroy, \\"Academia's Gender Problem\\", Scientific American, vol. 314, no. 1 (January 2016), p. 11. Though the percentage of doctorates awarded to women in life sciences in the United States increased from 15 to 52 percent between 1969 and 2009, only a third of assistant professors and less than a fifth of full professors in biology- related fields in 2009 were women. Women make up only 15 percent of permanent department chairs in medical schools and barely 16 percent of medical-school deans. The problem is a culture of unconscious bias that leaves many women feeling demoralized and marginalized. In one study, science faculty were given identical r√©sum√©s in which the names and genders of two applicants were interchanged; both male and female faculty judged the male applicant to be more competent and offered him a higher salary. Unconscious bias also appears as \\"microassaults\\" against women scientists: purportedly insignificant sexist jokes and insults that accumulate over the years and undermine confidence and ambition. Writes Claire Pomeroy: \\"Each time it is assumed that the only woman in the lab group will play the role of recording secretary, each time a research plan becomes finalized in the men's lavatory between conference sessions, each time a woman is not invited to go out for a beer after the plenary lecture to talk shop, the damage is reinforced.\\" \\"When I speak to groups of women scientists,\\" writes Pomeroy, \\"I often ask them if they have ever been in a meeting where they made a recommendation, had it ignored, and then heard a man receive praise and support for making the same point a few minutes later. Each time the majority of women in the audience raise their hands. Microassaults are especially damaging when they come from a high-school science teacher, college mentor, university dean or a member of the scientific elite who has been awarded a prestigious prize‚Äîthe very people who should be inspiring and supporting the next generation of scientists.\\" =Sexual harassment= Sexual harassment is more prevalent in academia than in any other social sector except the military. A June 2018 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine states that sexual harassment hurts individuals, diminishes the pool of scientific talent, and ultimately damages the integrity of science.Clara Moskowitz, \\"End Harassment: A leader of a major report on sexual misconduct explains how to make science accessible to everyone\\" (State of the World's Science, 2018), Scientific American, vol. 319, no. 4 (October 2018), p. 61. Paula Johnson, co-chair of the committee that drew up the report, describes some measures for preventing sexual harassment in science. One would be to replace trainees' individual mentoring with group mentoring, and to uncouple the mentoring relationship from the trainee's financial dependence on the mentor. Another way would be to prohibit the use of confidentiality agreements in connection with harassment cases. A novel approach to the reporting of sexual harassment, dubbed Callisto, that has been adopted by some institutions of higher education, lets aggrieved persons record experiences of sexual harassment, date-stamped, without actually formally reporting them. This program lets people see if others have recorded experiences of harassment from the same individual, and share information anonymously. =Deterrent stereotypes= Psychologist Andrei Cimpian and philosophy professor Sarah-Jane Leslie have proposed a theory to explain why American women and African-Americans are often subtly deterred from seeking to enter certain academic fields by a misplaced emphasis on genius.Andrei Cimpian and Sarah-Jane Leslie, \\"The Brilliance Trap\\", Scientific American, vol. 317, no. 3 (September 2017), pp. 60‚Äì65. Cimpian and Leslie had noticed that their respective fields are similar in their substance but hold different views on what is important for success. Much more than psychologists, philosophers value a certain kind of person: the \\"brilliant superstar\\" with an exceptional mind. Psychologists are more likely to believe that the leading lights in psychology grew to achieve their positions through hard work and experience.Andrei Cimpian and Sarah-Jane Leslie, \\"The Brilliance Trap\\", Scientific American, vol. 317, no. 3 (September 2017), pp. 61‚Äì62. In 2015, women accounted for less than 30% of doctorates granted in philosophy; African-Americans made up only 1% of philosophy Ph.D.s. Psychology, on the other hand, has been successful in attracting women (72% of 2015 psychology Ph.D.s) and African-Americans (6% of psychology Ph.D.s).Andrei Cimpian and Sarah-Jane Leslie, \\"The Brilliance Trap\\", Scientific American, vol. 317, no. 3 (September 2017), p. 62. An early insight into these disparities was provided to Cimpian and Leslie by the work of psychologist Carol Dweck. She and her colleagues had shown that a person's beliefs about ability matter a great deal for that person's ultimate success. A person who sees talent as a stable trait is motivated to \\"show off this aptitude\\" and to avoid making mistakes. By contrast, a person who adopts a \\"growth mindset\\" sees his or her current capacity as a work in progress: for such a person, mistakes are not an indictment but a valuable signal highlighting which of their skills are in need of work.Andrei Cimpian and Sarah-Jane Leslie, \\"The Brilliance Trap\\", Scientific American, vol. 317, no. 3 (September 2017), p. 63. Cimpian and Leslie and their collaborators tested the hypothesis that attitudes, about \\"genius\\" and about the unacceptability of making mistakes, within various academic fields may account for the relative attractiveness of those fields for American women and African-Americans. They did so by contacting academic professionals from a wide range of disciplines and asking them whether they thought that some form of exceptional intellectual talent was required for success in their field. The answers received from almost 2,000 academics in 30 fields matched the distribution of Ph.D.s in the way that Cimpian and Leslie had expected: fields that placed more value on brilliance also conferred fewer Ph.D.s on women and African-Americans. The proportion of women and African- American Ph.D.s in psychology, for example, was higher than the parallel proportions for philosophy, mathematics, or physics.Andrei Cimpian and Sarah- Jane Leslie, \\"The Brilliance Trap\\", Scientific American, vol. 317, no. 3 (September 2017), pp. 63‚Äì64. Further investigation showed that non-academics share similar ideas of which fields require brilliance. Exposure to these ideas at home or school could discourage young members of stereotyped groups from pursuing certain careers, such as those in the natural sciences or engineering. To explore this, Cimpian and Leslie asked hundreds of five-, six-, and seven-year-old boys and girls questions that measured whether they associated being \\"really, really smart\\" (i.e., \\"brilliant\\") with their sex. The results, published in January 2017 in Science, were consistent with scientific literature on the early acquisition of sex stereotypes. Five-year- old boys and girls showed no difference in their self-assessment; but by age six, girls were less likely to think that girls are \\"really, really smart.\\" The authors next introduced another group of five-, six-, and seven-year-olds to unfamiliar gamelike activities that the authors described as being \\"for children who are really, really smart.\\" Comparison of boys' and girls' interest in these activities at each age showed no sex difference at age five but significantly greater interest from boys at ages six and seven‚Äîexactly the ages when stereotypes emerge.Andrei Cimpian and Sarah-Jane Leslie, \\"The Brilliance Trap\\", Scientific American, vol. 317, no. 3 (September 2017), p. 65. Cimpian and Leslie conclude that, \\"Given current societal stereotypes, messages that portray [genius or brilliance] as singularly necessary [for academic success] may needlessly discourage talented members of stereotyped groups.\\" =Academic snobbery= Largely as a result of his growing popularity, astronomer and science popularizer Carl Sagan, creator of the 1980 PBS TV Cosmos series, came to be ridiculed by scientist peers and failed to receive tenure at Harvard University in the 1960s and membership in the National Academy of Sciences in the 1990s. The eponymous \\"Sagan effect\\" persists: as a group, scientists still discourage individual investigators from engaging with the public unless they are already well-established senior researchers.Susana Martinez-Conde, Devin Powell and Stephen L. Macknik, \\"The Plight of the Celebrity Scientist\\", Scientific American, vol. 315, no. 4 (October 2016), p. 65.The Editors, \\"Go Public or Perish: When universities discourage scientists from speaking out, society suffers\\", Scientific American, vol. 318, no. 2 (February 2018), p. 6. The operation of the Sagan effect deprives society of the full range of expertise needed to make informed decisions about complex questions, including genetic engineering, climate change, and energy alternatives. Fewer scientific voices mean fewer arguments to counter antiscience or pseudoscientific discussion. The Sagan effect also creates the false impression that science is the domain of older white men (who dominate the senior ranks), thereby tending to discourage women and minorities from considering science careers. A number of factors contribute to the Sagan effect's durability. At the height of the Scientific Revolution in the 17th century, many researchers emulated the example of Isaac Newton, who dedicated himself to physics and mathematics and never married. These scientists were viewed as pure seekers of truth who were not distracted by more mundane concerns. Similarly, today anything that takes scientists away from their research, such as having a hobby or taking part in public debates, can undermine their credibility as researchers.Susana Martinez-Conde, Devin Powell and Stephen L. Macknik, \\"The Plight of the Celebrity Scientist\\", Scientific American, vol. 315, no. 4 (October 2016), p. 66. Another, more prosaic factor in the Sagan effect's persistence may be professional jealousy. However, there appear to be some signs that engaging with the rest of society is becoming less hazardous to a career in science. So many people have social- media accounts now that becoming a public figure is not as unusual for scientists as previously. Moreover, as traditional funding sources stagnate, going public sometimes leads to new, unconventional funding streams. A few institutions such as Emory University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology may have begun to appreciate outreach as an area of academic activity, in addition to the traditional roles of research, teaching, and administration. Exceptional among federal funding agencies, the National Science Foundation now officially favors popularization.Susana Martinez-Conde, Devin Powell and Stephen L. Macknik, \\"The Plight of the Celebrity Scientist\\", Scientific American, vol. 315, no. 4 (October 2016), p. 67. =Institutional snobbery= Like infectious diseases, ideas in academia are contagious. But why some ideas gain great currency while equally good ones remain in relative obscurity had been unclear. A team of computer scientists has used an epidemiological model to simulate how ideas move from one academic institution to another. The model-based findings, published in October 2018, show that ideas originating at prestigious institutions cause bigger \\"epidemics\\" than equally good ideas from less prominent places. The finding reveals a big weakness in how science is done. Many highly trained people with good ideas do not obtain posts at the most prestigious institutions; much good work published by workers at less prestigious places is overlooked by other scientists and scholars because they are not paying attention.Viviane Callier, \\"Idea Epidemic: An infectious disease model shows how science knowledge spreads\\", Scientific American, vol. 320, no. 2 (February 2019), p. 14.

Huckabee had assumed the office of governor in July 1996 after Jim Guy Tucker resigned over implications of his involvement in the Whitewater affair. Because Huckabee had not yet been elected to the post, and the aftermath of Tucker's resignation had temporarily tarnished the title of Governor, it was deemed the Democratic challenger, Jonesboro attorney Bill Bristow, would be of worthy competition. However, Huckabee's appeal as an honest Southern Baptist minister in the wake of scandal and his brief but high-profile experience opposed to Bristow's lack thereof made him a much more attractive candidate amongst the Arkansas electorate. His well-funded grassroots campaign across all portions of the state and Bristow's lack of support from the Democratic Party, which was more focused on Blanche Lincoln's U.S. Senate race, enabled him to soar in the polls. On election day, Huckabee won the election with nearly 60% of the vote, the largest margin for any Republican Governor of Arkansas since Reconstruction till Asa Hutchinson‚Äôs 2018 election performance of 65.3%. According to a CNN exit poll, Huckabee received 48% of the African-American vote in his 1998 election; but some experts have questioned whether those numbers are a representative sample on how he did on the whole in the election. =Results= References 1998 Arkansas Gubernatorial ","title":"1998 Arkansas gubernatorial election"},{"id":"42403060","text":"Sat Bir Singh Khalsa is a researcher in the field of body mind medicine, specializing in yoga therapy.

He is best known for his surviving paintings, poetry, and calligraphy , and for his relationships with prominent statesmen and early amateur literati artists such as Su Shi, Huang Tingjian and Mi Fu. Life Born in the city of Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, Wang rose to a senior military position before marrying Princess Shuguo (1051-1080), the daughter of Emperor Yingzong of Song. Her older brother, Emperor Shenzong of Song, succeeded Yingzong to the throne. In 1079, Wang was implicated in a political scandal by virtue of his friendship with Su Shi and demoted as a result of the Crow Terrace Poetry Trial, before later being exiled from the Song capital for three years. Painting Wang was an accomplished amateur painter, whose widely accepted surviving works are handscrolls depicting landscape scenes. One of these, painted in ink with light color in the stylistic tradition of Li Cheng and Guo Xi, is entitled \\"Light Snow on a Fishing Village\\". A handscroll in the Shanghai Museum called \\"Misty River , Layered Peaks\\" is painted in a blue-and-green palette associated with Tang painter Li Sixun. Another landscape handscroll in the Shanghai Museum shares the same title but depicts a different scene. It is noteworthy for a series of poems Wang and Su wrote each other on the scroll. Richard Barnhart has proposed that a hanging scroll attributed to Guo Xi in the Shanghai Museum is instead a fourth surviving painting by Wang. Poetry Although less remembered as a poet than a painter, Wang Shen traded rhymes with Su Shi, one of the most renowned poets of the Song dynastic era, if not all time.

Early life The parents of Mattia Maggio come from the Salento in Apulia, and had once emigrated from their homeland and settled in Swabia in Germany. Maggio was born in N√ºrtingen; in the age of eight years he moved with his family to Vaihingen an der Enz. As he grew up bilingual, he speaks German and Italian fluently. Mattia Maggio discovered as a child his passion for football. This sport he practiced with his friends on the street and in the e-youth, he joined the VfB Vaihingen. At the age of ten years, he applied for a trial with VfB Stuttgart and in a three-month selection process, he beat out over 200 other competitors. Maggio joined now in the youth academy of the Bundesliga side. He played until 2011 for the Swabians before he went in the summer in the Italian homeland of his parents when he accepted an offer the youth of Novara Calcio. He justified the change with the opportunity to further develop especially as he got a little operating times with the Swabians. In Novara, he was also in the extended professional squad, which had risen in the summer in the Serie A. In Novara, he was also in the extended professional squad, which had risen in the summer in the Serie A. However, he was only allowed to play in January. Club career =Serie A debut= On 12 May 2012, he celebrated his professional debut when he came off the bench in the 1-2 defeat in Serie A against AC Milan in the 84th minute for Simone Pesce. =Hamburger SV= Maggio returns in January 2013 to Germany and after a trial joined Hamburger SV. He signed a contract there in the reserve team, however, was initially used in the A-Youth (U-19). In four games, he scored three goals. On May 15, 2013 Maggio debuted in the reserve team in the league game operation and scored his first goal as he's 3-1 win against Victoria Hamburg scored the 2‚Äì0. In the final phase of the 2013‚Äì14 season Maggio came to injury-related failures of many players on offense and good performance for his part in the professional squad. For example, Maggio scored in a 4-1 victory over SV Eichede three goals. He made his Bundesliga debut for the club on 4 April 2014 in a match against Bayer Leverkusen. Maggio substituted Jacques Zoua 77 minutes into a 2‚Äì1 home win.https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2014/04/04/germany/bundesliga/hamburger- sv/bayer-04-leverkusen/1487281/ Hamburger SV finished after 34 matches on the 16th place in the table game and had the Barrage, where the \\"Rothosen\\" had requested a 0-0 and a 1-1 prevailed on away goals against SpVgg Greuther F√ºrth and thus managed to avoid relegation. In the remaining games Maggio could not draw attention to himself and thus had to leave the club. International career Steffen Freund was on Mattia Maggio attention when he played for VfB Stuttgart and because of Maggio played twice in the U-16 national team of Germany. Maggio felt but as Italians and looked, however, as an Italian and he identifies himself with Italy and he feels attracted to Italy. Because of this, he then decided to play for Italy, and he played 13 times for the U-17 National Team in Italy.

The clothing was sold out of a boutique store on Rodeo Drive before adding multiple locations there and elsewhere. Bernini's stores were known as offering \\"the very best menswear\\", with some branches selling custom-made suits. Pricing for a suit, shirt, and shoes could run into the thousands of dollars. Visitors to the line's many stores included celebrities like rapper Puff Daddy and basketball player Michael Jordan. Bernini suits were worn on-air by Love Connection television show host Chuck Woolery, who was provided the suits by the company, as noted by the program announcer at the end of each show. By 1998, Bernini had expanded to three locations on Rodeo Drive, including the original store at 346 N. Rodeo, Bernini Sport at 326 N. Rodeo, and Bernini Couture at 355 N. Rodeo‚Äîleading to the facetious observation that Rodeo Drive was \\"threatening to become 'Bernini Drive'\\". The company opened locations in large outlet shopping centers, like in Cabazon, California. In the late 1990s, the company opened \\"Off Rodeo Drive Beverly Hills\\" multi-brand superstores inside of Mills Corporation shopping centers, including in Ontario, California (Ontario Mills), suburban Houston, Texas (Katy Mills), and suburban Dallas-Fort Worth (Grapevine Mills). The \\"Off Rodeo Drive\\" properties consisted of a corridor replicating the actual Rodeo Drive of Beverly Hills, with separate doorways leading to mini-stores for clothing brands such as Calvin Klein, Donna Karan, Gianni Versace, Hugo Boss, Moschino, Shauna Stein, Giorgio Armani, and Bernini. As of 2009, Bernini also operated a number of shops in Las Vegas, including a Bernini and \\"the fancy men's clothing store\\" Bernini Collections at Caesars Palace Forum shops, a Bernini Couture at Caesars Palace Appian Way shops, and The Bernini Collezioni at the MGM Grand, selling items from other companies including Brioni, Canali, Versace, Hugo Boss, and Zegna.

Immediately after graduation he was offered a teaching position at Alfred University where he taught for 35 years until he retired.Johnson, 2008. John Wood: On the Edge of Clear Meaning Artwork Wood had the ability to work across a variety of artistic forms, from straight photography, collage, clich√© verre, solarization, mixed media, offset lithography to drawing. Wood moved freely between conceptual and visual exploration, not adhering to a single style. Although he often raised questions about political, social and environmental issues, he avoided promoting personal solutions or adding narratives to the images. The artist instead preferred to focus on the viewer‚Äôs interpretation and the possibility for multiple meanings.Shales, 2008.

Evidences from the images of the Beta Regio shows the history behind the region, the rise of the region is caused by an uplift of the mantle plume, which caused the formation of Theia Mons shield volcano. The Devana Chasma rift system were also constructed by the uplift, and became active due to the Theia Mons volcano. Furthermore, these evidences proposed several aspects concerning the development and history of the rift zone. Nowadays, the rift zone is still active but the rifting is much slower because of the relative cold mantle plume. In previous centuries, the mantle plumes were hotter and the rifting rate were faster, but the mantle got colder and that consistent with the current cold plate of Venus.Campbell, D. B., J. W.

Shield volcano formation and activating of the rift zone and spreading the crust Comparison between Venus and Earth rift systems Due to the similarities between Earth and Venus, it is suggested that they have a similar lithospheric elastic thickness of ~30 km. East African Rift is the only rift that can be compared to Devana Chasma.Solomon, S.C. (1985) The elastic lithosphere: Some relationships among flexure, depth of faulting lithosphere thickness and thermal gradient, Lunar Planet. w. 799-600. Both rifts have fault segments length around ~100 km, which makes them stronger than any extensional system on Earth.Foster, Adrian, and Francis Nimmo. \\"Comparisons Between The Rift Systems Of East Africa, Earth And Beta Regio, Venus.\\" Earth And Planetary Science Letters 143.1-4 (1996): 183-195. GeoRef. Web. 28 Feb. 2014. However, they differ in their half grabens, East African Rifts' half grabens are around 50 km wide while on Venus it is around 150 km. In East African Rift, the higher elastic thickness can explain the wide half grabens. However, on Venus the main force is the high shear stress due to the cold lithosphere, which require the faults to be stronger in order to move. As a result, it has a wider half grabens than the one on Earth. Studying and comparing these two rift systems help us to understand how volcanism and tectonic activities affected the development and formation of the Beta Regio region on Venus.Head, J. W., L. S.

Inset is of a region in Terra Sirenum investigated by Davila et al. (2011). Color represents elevation as determined by MOLA (red is higher elevation, yellow is lower elevation). Across the southern highlands of Mars, approximately 640 sites of chloride- bearing deposits have been identified using the Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS). These isolated, irregularly shaped patches (approximate size range of 0.33 ‚Äì 1300 km2, with an average size of 24 km2) have been dated to the older geologic periods on Mars: Noachian (4.5 ‚Äì 3.5 billion years ago) and Hesperian (3.5 ‚Äì 2.9 billion years ago) periods. On Earth, chlorides are known to form through aqueous processes. Similar processes are expected to be responsible for the formation of chloride deposits on Mars. The finding of these deposits is significant in that it provides further evidence for the presence of surface or subsurface water in ancient Mars. Importance of chlorides Chlorides contain the anion Cl‚àí and are soluble in water, meaning they provide evidence of past aqueous processes, which helps to constrain the type of environment at a particular region. On Earth, two main processes form chlorides: efflorescence and precipitation. Whereas on Earth these minerals are formed in more alkaline environments, the minerals on Mars form from more acidic fluids and the processes are connected to basaltic weathering. The key similarity between the formation of chlorides on the two planets is the presence of water. This is important because water is essential to life on Earth, and therefore drives the search for evidence of life on other planets. Chlorides are of particular interest because of their potential to preserve a biological signature through chemical sedimentation. In addition, their presence throughout the entire southern hemisphere of Mars suggests their formation have been an important process to the early history of Mars. Methods for identification thumb350pxUpper Left) Chloride deposits shown in blue as observed by THEMIS in Terra Sirenum A) HiRISE image of black box in upper left B) HiRISE image showing the polygonal fractures (inset of Box B in Box A) C) HiRISE image showing the chloride deposits overlying degraded craters (inset of Box C in Box A) The chloride salts were identified using THEMIS onboard the 2001 Mars Odyssey orbiter. The spectrum acquired from THEMIS shows a featureless slope over the wavenumber range of ~672 to 1475 cm‚àí1. Few things describe this spectrally distinct feature, and thus has been concluded to be the result of chloride-bearing deposits. One such supporting terrestrial example is the identification of halite in Death Valley by instruments in the same wavelength as THEMIS. Further investigation of these deposits using the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) showed the features to be light-toned and irregularly shaped fractures overlying small, degraded craters. Spectra from the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer (CRISM) on MRO was also used for comparison in lab experiments to explain the featureless slope observed in the THEMIS data. Known minerals on Earth were tested to see if they reproduced the same distinct THEMIS spectra. Pyrite was determined to not be a possible match for the mineral deposits on Mars. Flood basalt mixtures containing halite reproduced the spectra in some instances, reinforcing the conclusion that this THEMIS spectra, and thus the deposits, are chloride. However, the most definitive evidence that these are in fact chloride deposits will come from in situ observations on the Martian surface. Terra Sirenum Terra Sirenum is a region in the southern highlands of Mars (approximately at 38.8¬∞S, 221¬∞E), with a distinguishing feature of a higher brightness as compared to the typical background soils. It is of particular interest because it is the location of the largest regional occurrence of chlorides. One study has interpreted six regions of chloride deposits (10 ‚Äì 50 km2) in the lowest topographical levels of an inter-crater basin (300 ‚Äì 400 km) as individual salt flats. Connecting channels between the salt flats provides evidence for a common origin, such as evaporation of water. Comparing these salt flats to ones observed on Earth, such as those in the Atacama Desert further supports the hypothesis of a formation due to evaporation. Using CRISM data, this study also observed phyllosilicates in the rims of craters and the surrounding ejecta to occur near the chlorides. Another study also observed phyllosilicates to be closely located to chlorides with CRISM, as well as THEMIS. Phyllosilicates also provide evidence for aqueous processes occurring during the Noachian period. Both studies determined that the phyllosilicates were deposited first.

It is a sequel to A Fairly Odd Movie: Grow Up, Timmy Turner! and A Fairly Odd Christmas, and was released on August 2, 2014. The film was released on DVD on October 28, 2014 and was released on Blu-ray on December 4, 2015. Plot Following his previous adventure, Timmy Turner is assigned a summer job in Fairy World's Yuck Factory by head fairy, Jorgen Von Strangle, who believes that as he is grown up, he should work for a living due to him being grown up, something his own fairies agree upon. Timmy, despite not being happy he will not be able to enjoy a summer vacation, chooses to do so in order to impress Tootie, who now works for the Help Creatures Dimmsdale Research Center. Returning to Dimmsdale from his latest day of work, Timmy visits Tootie at the Center and discovers, much to his disappointment, that the head of the Center wishes her to deliver a special gas cure for rare spotted dolphins to Hawaii, which will be contained in a vial in the same size and shape as Timmy's lip balm. In mix-up and totally unaware of it, Timmy sets his lip balm down by the gas cure, which is inadvertently packed away into a travel case by mistake while he takes the cure's vial. Later, upon returning to home, Timmy is shocked to discovers that his parents are also going to Hawaii, after Mr. Turner's pencil company chose it for the company's next vacation. Mr. Turner further reveals that he has been put in charge of providing the entertainment in the form of a fire dance and been given the money to do so, only to learn from Timmy after reading the note his boss gave him in more detail, that he will be fired if he fails to provide. Meanwhile, two children from a rich family, Marty and Mitzy, are excited about going to Hawaii, until they learn their parents won't be going, instead sending them off with a babysitter, who turns out to be Vicky, much to their chagrin. In Fairy World, Timmy is visited by Jorgen and told he is being promoted. Much to his chagrin, Timmy learns he is to look after the source of all fairy magic, Abracadabraium, while Jorgen is away in Hawaii competing in the Bronze Biceps contest. Reluctantly, Timmy takes on the job, but whilst preparing to have his lunch, Timmy discovers that his father packed the check he had been given within his sandwich by mistake, while also discovering that his lip balm got mistakenly taken by Tootie and not the gas cure. Seeking to avoid both suffering by these minor accidents, Timmy decides to head to Hawaii, taking the Abracadabraium with him in a bowling bag. Meanwhile, Poof's counterpart, Foop, who had been spying on him, meets with the Anti-Fairy council over his failure to destroy Timmy's fairies, and vows that he has found a new way to do so by going after the Abracadabraium and destroying it, despite the fact that no anti-fairy can touch it because of the good magic stored in it. The council orders him to do so, stripping him of his bottle, the source of his magic, to ensure he completes his task on the promise he will receive something horrible for his punishment. Heading for Hawaii, Foop runs into Mr. Crocker at the airport, after he was sent there by his mother in the hopes of curing his obsession with fairies. Realizing that Foop plans to cause mischief for Timmy and destroy Fairy World, Mr Crocker agrees to help him in acquiring the Abracadabraium. After returning the check to his father, much to his delight, and giving back the gas cure to Tootie, so she can keep her job, Timmy decides to relax with her and his fairies on the beach. While doing so, he and Tootie run into Marty and Mitzy, who had run away from Vicky after she had mistreated them on their vacation, and help them to continue to escape from her so they can have fun. But while relaxing, Mr. Crocker, who is given the money for the fire dance by Mr. Turner, and Foop, having taken on human form, successfully distract the pair and steal the bag carrying the Abracadabraium from Timmy, soon putting Fairy World in danger, and weakening Cosmo, Wanda and Poof. Realizing he had been duped, Timmy is soon spotted by Jorgen who becomes furious he lost the Abracadaraium and orders him and Tootie to get it back; his anger changes his skin and wins him 3rd place in the Bronze Biceps contest and publicity, ruling him out in getting it back. Seeking to get it back, the pair and the fairies recruit Marty and Mitzy to help and soon discover that Foop plans to drop the Abracadabrium into a lava pool within a volcano. Arriving to stop him, the group discover that Mr. Crocker, who was planning to drop it, became affected by it, turning good and refusing to do as Foop wants. Angered, Foop risks touching the substance to destroy it, leading to Timmy struggling with him to get it back and falling into the lava with it. Much to the surprise of the others, Timmy survives and becomes a fairy (his appearance that of his cartoon self in his youth) after absorbing some of the powers of the Abracadabraium. A defiant Foop swears revenge but is soon sent packing by Poof, while Mr. Crocker soon returns to his normal self. With Timmy now a fairy, Jorgen reassigns Cosmo, Wanda and Poof to Marty and Mitzy, who he states deserves them, all while leaving them close by for Timmy to see them. Timmy soon uses his fairy powers to save his father's job by creating a fire dance for him with Mr. Crocker in it, after learning he took the money for it. While Marty and Mitzy take delight in having fairies, turning Vicky into a rabbit, Tootie declares she will need time to get used to Timmy as a fairy, before dancing with him. The stage sets off fireworks and Poof sends off the audience with an \\"Aloha!\\". In the Epilogue, Foop gets sent down the drain which he describes as the \\"unspeakable horror\\", which ends the film.

The museum is now part of the Musei Reali di Torino, the royal site that has unified the Royal Palace, the Sabauda Gallery, the Archaeological Museum, the Royal Library and the Armoury. The whole site has been included on the UNESCO World Heritage list since 1997.  History  The Royal Armoury was founded by Charles Albert, king of Sardinia, and opened to the public in 1837. Since then it has been housed in the Galleria Beaumont, built on the site of a previous gallery connecting the Royal Palace to Palazzo Madama. Designed by Filippo Juvarra in 1733, it was decorated by the court painter Claudio Francesco Beaumont (hence its name) in 1738-1743, whose oil paintings on the ceiling depict Stories of Aeneas. The gallery was completed after 1762 by Benedetto Alfieri, who also designed the nearby stairway as an access to the State offices (Segreterie di Stato). Until 1832, several large paintings from the royal collections were displayed on the walls of this gallery. The paintings were then moved to Palazzo Madama, the first seat of the public collection called Reale Galleria (now Sabauda Gallery). King Charles Albert decided to place his collection of arms and armour inside this gallery; most of them came from Turin‚Äôs and Genoa‚Äôs arsenals, as well as from the museums housed since the 18th century in the Palazzo dell‚ÄôUniversit√†. The royal collection included prehistoric and medieval objects, weapons and armour used by the dukes (later kings) of Savoy, but also many prestigious diplomatic gifts. Charles Albert enriched such collection through the acquisition of single pieces on the market (mainly in Paris) and of whole private collections, such as the one formed by the set designer Alessandro Sanquirico in Milan (1833) and the Martinengo della Fabbrica collection from Brescia (1839). In 1836, the king asked Pelagio Palagi to redesign an adjacent room in order to make it the seat of the Medagliere, i.e. a large collection of medals, coins and seals. The room‚Äôs Greek-style furniture was specifically meant to preserve and display this collection, as well as antiques and other precious objects belonging to the royal family. The Medagliere was closely connected with the Royal Library still housed on the ground floor. Palagi also designed the so-called Rotonda at the other end of the Galleria Beaumont, on the site of a former theatre (later ballroom) once connected to Palazzo Madama through a further gallery which was demolished in 1809. The Rotonda became an extension of the original Armoury: arms, flags and other objects connected with the military history of the kingdom of Sardinia after the 18th century were then displayed in showcases in this room. The collection includes weapons formerly owned by Napoleon and by the kings of Italy, since the Savoy family gained that title after the unification of the country in 1861. European and American swords, guns and rifles are now displayed alongside oriental arms and armour acquired by or donated to the kings.  Collections  Among the objects belonging to the collection are the sword of San Maurizio, one of the most important relics owned by the Savoy family, made in the 13th century and still preserved with its 15th-century impressed, gilded and painted leather case; a 14th-century enamel horse bit from Naples; a 16th-century pistol which belonged to the emperor Charles V; precious armour such as count Girolamo Martinengo‚Äôs corsaletto (breastplate), dating from c. 1540, Henry II‚Äôs parade shield (c. 1556 ‚Äì 1559), and the war and jousting armour made by the Milanese armourer Pompeo della Cesa around 1590; extremely rich arms such as the hunting musket decorated in ivory by the German engraver Adam Sadeler around 1600; the sword used by Napoleon during his campaign in Egypt; guns and rifles owned by Charles Albert of Sardinia and by the kings of Italy Victor Emmanuel II and Umberto I; a Russian model Smith & Wesson revolver dating from the late 19th century.

The Crow Terrace Poetry Trial (or Crow Terrace Poetry Case, ÁÉèËá∫Ë©©Ê°à) was a trial on charges including treason and l√®se majest√© that occurred in the year 1079 of Song dynasty era in Chinese history. \\"Crow Terrace\\" refers to the nickname of the Imperial Office of the Censorate (Âæ°Âè≤Ëá∫), which prosecuted the case, citing Sung Criminal Code, Article 122: \\"Denouncing the Imperial Chariot\\". The most prominent figure of the dozens accused was the official and artist Su Shi (1037 ‚Äì 1101), whose works of poetry were produced in court as evidence against him. The trial was a major landmark in the struggle for free speech, in medieval China. The trial resulted in Su Shi's conviction and exile, as well as the conviction of over thirty other individuals, who faced varying punishments including fines and official reprimands. The Crow Terrace Poetry Trial had the significant effect of dampening subsequent creative expression and set a major negative precedent for freedom of speech, at least for the remainder of Song Dynasty China. Besides the significance of the Crow Terrace Poetry Trial for Su Shi and poetry, it is also a rather remarkably well-documented instance of a medieval Chinese literary prosecution, with surviving copies of indictments, arguments, case disposition; not to mention numerous of Su Shi's poems, which were entered as evidence. General background Approximate map of Northern Sung China (960‚Äì1127), with neighboring empires indicated. The Crow Terrace Poetry Trial took place in 1079, the 2nd year of the Yuanfeng era (Yu√°n Fƒìng ÂÖÉË±ê; \\"Primary Abundance\\") 1078‚Äì1085 of the Song dynasty. The disparate states of the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period had been unified by the first Song ancestor, Zhao Kuangyin (Emperor Taizu of Song); and, the capital city established in Kaifeng. The Crow Terrace Affair occurred during the reign of Emperor Shenzong of Song, who was then emperor: he was born in 1048 and reigned from 1067 to 1085. Poetic background As Alfreda Murck puts it: \\"Poetry pervaded the lives of educated scholars in the Song dynasty\\" (51). The poetic legacy was greatly derived from poetry of the Tang dynastic era. Especially important was the work of the Tang poet Du Fu (Murck, 52-59). Du Fu (712 ‚Äì 770) had a revival of interest in his poetry during the Song dynastic era. One of Du Fu's poems was \\"Autumn Day in Kui Prefecture\\": written in and about the exile experience in Kui Prefecture. Su Shi's early life An early Yuan Dynasty portrait of Su Shi, by Zhao Mengfu Ë∂ôÂ≠üÈ†´, held at Taipei Palace Museum. Su Shi (1037 ‚Äì 1101) also has sometimes been known as Dongpo. It was he who was put on trial in 1079, in the Crow Terrace Poetry Affair. Su Shi \\"Dongpo\\" was already a prominent and popular poet, as well as being deeply involved in the factional political of the time. Su Shi's career began with particular promise. His father, Su Xun, was a known scholar-official and his brother, Su Zhe, followed. The brothers passed the imperial civil service tests in 1057 with honors (followed up in 1061 with specially-decreed examinations). Thus, Su Shi came to the attention of emperor Renzong, who reigned from 1022 to 1063. Not only that, but Su Shi obtained the patronage of prominent government official and renowned poet Ouyang Xiu. When Renzong died in 1063, he was replaced by Yinzong, who ruled 4 years before expiring. The new emperor was the 19-year-old Shenzong, who was eager for a full treasury to fund his ambitions of re-conquest of the former Tang empire's northern territories, which had been incorporated into neighboring, non-Chinese empires (Murck, 32). Wang Anshi's New Policies: initial implementation Much of Wang Anshi's New Policies had to do with fiscal issues. Shenzong's support of them had much to do with the aspiration to expand the imperial sway beyond the current borders. For this, much cash would need to be forthcoming. Pictured here is the obverse and reverse of a Tian Xi Tong Bao (1017‚Äì1022) coin, typical for much of Chinese history. The holes could be used to string coins together into convenient groups. Song dynasty monetary policies also included experimentation with paper notes. Although theoretically, the emperor was the final and absolute authority in Chinese politics during the Song dynasty, in actuality many factors importantly affected events: these included other politically influential persons such as the emperor's in-laws and other relatives and also party politics. Party political division at the time was severe: Wang Anshi led a group of \\"reformists\\", also known as the \\"New Policy party\\", whose ideas were perhaps ahead of their time. Su Shi was part of the politically-opposed \\"conservative\\" group, later known as the \\"Yuanyou party\\", after the era-name during which they had exercised most power. Wang Anshi's New Policies had their ups-and-downs in imperial favor, but initially he was able to sweep the political field of oppositional voices. Sima Guang, the main oppositional leader retired to Luoyang, as did various others in his faction. Su Shi's patron Ouyang Xiu (1007 ‚Äì 1072) was demoted, exiled, and eventually permitted to retire. Su Shi was not identified as a main leader of the opposition party and was exiled as governor of Hangzhou, which in itself was not the worst place to be sent, or the worst position for someone pursuing a career in politics, but it forbade his appearance at court, and consequentially denied him direct influence or interaction with the imperial government, at the national level. Hangzhou: life and poetry in exile Su Shi Dongpo caused a causeway to be created across West Lake. This is a view of it from 2005. Su Shi's political vulnerability had been increased by a prior conviction, which resulted in his first sentence to exile, before the Crow Terrace incident. His first exile was relatively mild: it was as governor of Hangzhou, on beautiful West Lake, where the poet Bai Juyi had previously governed, a city which would later become the capital of the Song dynasty after the fall of Kaifeng to invasion (much after Su Shi's lifetime). Su Shi obtained a small farm-hold, here, which he worked while fulfilling his service as a local official. As governor of Hangzhou, Su Shi employed more than 200,000 workers in environmental works to dredge mud and sediment out of West Lake, thus preserving it from silting up and no longer being a lake, as it was in danger of doing so. The dredged material was used to build a causeway (just as the poet Bai Juyi had done similarly, in similar circumstance, back in the Tang dynasty era). Su Shi's works helped endear him to the local population. Su Shi's sobriquet \\"Dongpo\\" derives from this period of exile to the \\"Eastern Slope\\", referring to the location of his farm. An anthology of Su Shi's poetry from his Hangzhou era came into circulation, collected and published by his friends (Murck, 48). David Hinton (364) describes this first exile in Hangzhou as the time when he \\"consolidated his mature poetics\\". New Policy: continuation without Wang Anshi paper money. This is a specimen. While Su Shi concentrated on making the lives of the local people in his charge better, and pursued his poetry which his position allowed time for, Wang Anshi's policies went awry. Were they bad policies, or were they badly implemented, or were climatic changes leading to drought and poor harvests to blame? These are all serious questions, important to historians of the time, and nowhere near to being definitively answered; but, they are rather subject of great scholarly debate. What is certain is that Su Shi was exiled until emperor Shenzong became somewhat disillusioned with Wang Anshi (the powerful empress dowager had never been much of a fan of his). The Kaifeng merchants were becoming angry at the price inflation of wholesale goods together with additional tax increases and imposition of fees; and in north of the country a major drought followed by horrible famine occurred in 1074, displacing thousands of refugees (Murck, 37-38). In late 1075, this was followed by a spectacular comet, traditionally viewed as a sign of great changes on earth, if not portending the fall of dynasties (Murck, 48) These events helped to lead Wang Anshi into a relatively gentle exile, and to lead to the restoration of Su Shi and other banished officials to positions of power and respect, aided by empress dowager Cao. However, this was just the warm-up to a bitter and deadly political struggle between the two factions in the ensuing years: now both groups had had their ranks decimated, and all sorts of charges of criminal impropriety were our would be filed. Ouyang Xiu had even already been charged with incest, and placed in early retirement: the battle lines drawn, and Su Shi would soon be charged with treason to the state. End of exile Su Shi was no longer in formal exile, but he avoided returning to the court in Kaifeng. His persecutor Wang Anshi had been removed from there. And, Su Shi had the support of Renzong's widow, who recalled his stellar performance in the examinations. However, despite recall and promotion, in the field of bitter factional politics, this made Su Shi a target for whatever charges could be invented or discovered. Even avoiding the harsh scrutiny in Kaifeng would not guarantee safety, instead Kaifeng would visit him. Accusation and arrest Su Shi Dong Po's poetry was not only popular with the literate set: his poems were even sung in the streets (Murck, 49). This came to official attention. In the summer of 1079, Su Shi was arrested and spent the next 4 months in jail, in Kaifeng, during his trial. He was also beaten (Hinton, 364). When his family packed up their goods and followed him to Kaifeng, they were brutally seized and searched by soldiers sent to stop their boat and search for incriminating manuscripts: as a result the women of the family burned most of Su Shi's writings that the soldiers did not take away (Murck, 50). Fearing that any of his writings could be used against him, Su Shi's wife burned his papers on the deck (Hinton, 364). Despite this, some 2,400 of his poems yet survive (Hinton, 365). Other conspirators Another major figure indicted in this case was Wang Shen, a wealthy noble and imperial in-law, who was also a painter, poet, and friend of Su Shi. Wang was particularly accused of having caused a collected edition of Su Shi's allegedly subversive poems to be printed and published. Another person involved in the case was Huang Tingjian (Hartman, 20). Huang and his uncle were heavily fined, and Huang was exiled. Another person implicated in the events was Su Shi's brother Su Zhe. There were in total more than 30 indictments in the case. Prosecution Prosecution was by the Office of the Censor (censorate, or \\"Crow Terrace\\"). This office, under a head official was charged with investigating and prosecuting the other officials within the imperial bureaucracy. Lead prosecutors in the case (non-pinyin) were Li Ting and Shu Tan, early supporters of Wang Anshi and New Policy party members: Li Ting had been appointed chief of the censorate in 1078 (Hartman, 21). Su Shi's case involved an initial indictment, out of an eventual total of four separate indictments. Evidence The main evidence used by the prosecution in the trial were over thirty years of poetry and prose written by Su Shi. This was collected from many of his associates, and printed editions from the market place were also considered. The analysis as to the meanings and implications of Su Shi's writings was not clear-cut, in terms of whether they were actually treasonous, or whether they were in the bounds of acceptable expression. Much of Su Shi's testimony revolved around these points, and what was said versus what he intended to imply, a matter much open to interpretation, much of it of an erudite nature, involving scholarly allusions, often obscure, dating back over a millennium and more of a continuous literary tradition. Defense Su Shi seems to have represented himself, as according with the legal tradition in China at the time, as would have been the case also with the other accused. His defense relied on admitting that he criticized the New Policy legislation and its supporters at the court. This criticism was legal, and his poetry would not have been needed to demonstrate that he was critical of these policies. Su Shi had in fact memorialized the emperor explicitly detailing his thoughts and feelings in this regard, in forceful prose (for a sample translation, see de Bary, 425-431). To avoid conviction, it was necessary for Su Shi to avoid the prosecution being able to prove that he had criticized or demeaned the emperor or his dynasty: using poetry to give indirect advice to the emperor which involved criticism of his subordinates and suggested policy improvements could be construed as a service to the state, and indeed there was a time-honored tradition of doing so, dating back through the earliest phases of the Chinese poetic tradition. The main question was: did Su Shi's poems cross the line from criticizing the imperial subordinates and their actions, or did his criticism extend to actually defaming the emperor himself? Whether Su Shi had crossed this line was also key in the case of the other persons accused, as their indictments centered around publishing or disseminating Su Shi's poems, which if illegally found to defame the emperor, automatically made them guilty of criminal conspiracy, if found that they were even merely aware of the poems and failed to report them to the authorities. Trial Misty River, Layered Peaks, by Wang Shen. Su Shi's trial lasted for 4 months, starting in the summer of 1079: he was accused of writing or allowing writings to circulate that the government might consider to be treasonously derogatory to the person of the emperor or to the state, which were considered to be basically equivalent. The charges were of \\"denouncing the imperial chariot\\" (Murck, 49) and of \\"great irreverence toward the emperor\\" (Murck, 49): conviction carried a mandatory death penalty by beheading, according to the statutory Song penal code, although this had never yet been applied (Murck, 49). Among the evidence were poems by Su Shi (also known as \\"Master Dongpo\\"). Su Shi defended himself, denying accusations, or explaining how the lines of his poems really referred to the results of the actions of corrupt ministers, which according to ancient tradition it was incumbent as a duty of a loyal official to point out. In his trial, Su Shi confessed to such things as comparing the attachment of unscrupulous officials to their salaries with an owl's attachment to eating a rotten rat (Murck, 76). According to Alfreda Murck (92), in a further confession, this time regarding the interpretation of a poem that he had written on the occasion of the banishment of Zeng Gong to serve in a remote government posting, Su Shi admitted: \\"This criticizes indirectly that many unfeeling men have recently been employed at Court, that their opinions are narrow-minded and make a raucous din like the sound of cicadas, and that they do not deserve to be heard.\\" However, he omitted to enlighten the court upon his use in this poem of matched rhymes from Du Fu's \\"Autumn Day in Kui Prefecture\\", or the added meanings which could then be derived from his poem (Murck, 92). In the end, Su Shi was convicted. The failure of the court to notice the extended meanings derivable by comparison of his rhymes with Du Fu's was apparent (to those in the know), and Su Shi and others, such as Wang Shen, having learned a way to avoid censorial persecution while still being able to express themselves to each other would continue to employ and expand upon this rhyme-matching, in conjunction with similarly coded painting. Sentencing Numerous convictions resulted from the Crow Terrace Poetry Case. Sentences ranged from fines to exile. Some of the fines were quite large, and some of the exile destinations were to remote and dangerous locations, with little literary culture and a prevalence of malaria and other diseases. However, Su Shi and the rest avoided the death penalty. =Su Shi: Commutation of death sentence= Map of the XiaoXiang area. Su Shi avoided the death sentence, partly due to the embarrassment which the government would face for decapitating a popular figure for some verses of poetry which it took them 4 months to explain as being derogatory towards itself, and partly because of the influence of empress dowager Cao. Cao was Renzong's widow, and former regent, during the few years of the reign of the sickly and infirm emperor Yingzong (Paludan, 129-130). She remembered Renzong's pleasure at discovering the talents of the Su brothers through the imperial examinations process. Also, capital punishment by the public removal of Su Shi's head would have been a clear violation of the Song dynastic founder Taizu's precepts, who had had written in stone for all of his successors to read that \\"Officials and scholars must not be executed\\", as the 2nd of his 3 admonitions which each of his successors were supposed to kneel down before and to read as part of their ceremony of investiture as emperor (Paludan, 122). In early 1080, Su Shi was sentenced to exile, and placed under 2 years of house arrest, in a very remote and difficult place, the small village of Huangzhou District, on the Yangzi River. Technically the sentence was penal servitude for 2 years (Murck, 49 and 304, note 75). At the end of the 2 years he was then by law allowed to apply to the imperial authority for recall from exile, but there was no legal mechanism by which this pardon would be automatically granted, and by this time Su's supporter dowager empress Cao was dead; thus, Su Shi remained in exile for a few more years (Murck, 49). =Others= Others convicted included Su Shi's brother, Su Zhe, who was exiled. Huang Tingjian and his uncle Li were heavily fined, and Huang was exiled. In total, there were over 30 convictions. Social and political import The Crow Terrace Poetry Case had an important and lasting effect on Song dynasty society and culture. The fact that a popular poet and popular government official could be censored and relegated to extreme exile had a chilling effect on freedom of speech (Murck, 49): :::\\"The 1079 trial and conviction of a prominent figure, one of the realm's most respected scholars, marks a further change in political culture. Civil bureaucrats were losing security along with respect. Su's conviction caused consternation.... Already habituated to elaborate indirection in their commentaries and poetry, anti-reformers were revising or burning poems that might be interpreted as seditious\\" (Murck, 49). Poetry criticism The Crow Terrace Poetry Trial's surviving manuscripts provide a rare instance of self- criticism by a poet. Su Shi was forced to defend himself against charges for which the chief evidence was his poetry. The surviving records of the case include detailed commentary by Su Shi on his own poems. The context in which his self-commentary is made tends to emphasize the political and social criticism implied in many of his poems, which may not otherwise be so evident today (Hartman, 24). Also, Su Shi's defense relied on making a case that his sociopolitical criticism was directed toward New Policy supporters as court, and not against the emperor himself or the state itself, rather that he was fulfilling a time-honored and legally acceptable function (if not indeed a duty), in which his poetry was intended as a service toward the emperor and the state (the \\"imperial chariot\\"), intended to advise rather than illegally criticize the emperor or the dynasty (criticism of Wang Anshi and other officials was legally permissible, as such, so long as no blame appeared to be directed towards the emperor for retaining their services). New poetry Su Shi and friends continued to write poetry, despite (or perhaps encouraged by) their frequent banishment. Su Shi collected some of his extant works from friends, having ensured that any offending lines had been removed (Murck, 50). Some of his poetry began more and more to use such a deep and subtle allusive process that it would be difficult for those outside his group to grasp the real meaning, let alone put him back on trial. One of these techniques was to use rhymes from other poems; thus, alluding to lines from that poem, and also alluding to other poems which Su Shi and his friends circulated which also matched these rhymes. Subtle complexities of profound political dissent could then be masked under cover of seemingly innocuous lines about nature scenes in the Xiaoxiang region: indeed a set of 8 conventional scenes evolved (Murck, passim). These are known as the Eight Views of Xiaoxiang.

Virtual Beetle Chalcosoma caucasus Description Chalcosoma caucasus males can reach a length of , while females grow to 50-60mm.Natural World Caucasus beetles are the largest of the genus Chalcosoma and one of Asia's largest beetles. They have a striking sexual dimorphism. The males have specialised enormous, curved horns on the head and thorax that they use to fight with each other to gain mating rights with females. Females are significantly smaller. The elytra of the females have a velvety texture, as they are covered by tiny hairs. When males enter into contests for females the fighting spirit is as strong as in Hercules Beetle of South America. Because they can be captured throughout the year the acquisition of these beetles is easy and the price is quite low. Caucasus beetles differ from chalcosoma atlas beetles (for which they are often mistaken) in that they have a small tooth on their lower horns. Their grubs go through 3 stages, l1, l2, and l3. The l1 has a skull diameter of 2mm, l2 has a 7mm skull, and the largest (l3) can have a skull diameter of 13 mm. Their grubs generally live underground for 12‚Äì15 months; the larger males remain grubs longer than females . Their pupae live 1‚Äì2 months, while the adults live for 3‚Äì5 months. Females live longer than males.The breeding manual of a Chalcosoma caucasus Distribution This species can be found from Malaysia south into Indonesia (Sumatra, Java, Malay Peninsula, Indochina) and Thailand in East region (Chanthaburi province, Sa Kaeo province).

History Bethlehem Lutheran Church gathering, Pimpama Island (Carl Heinrich Heck is centre of the middle row) The district is named after Stegelitz, Germany, the home town of the pioneer family Kleingschmidt. In the late 1800s, the farming district located between the Pimpama River and the Logan River called Pimpama Island and encompasses the modern localities of Jacobs Well, Norwell, Steiglitz and Woongoolba. It was referred to as an island because there were a number of lagoons and swamps that isolated the area during the wet season; however, this disadvantage made it good land for growing sugar cane. Rocky Point Sugar Mill, Woongoolba and Steiglitz, 2014 The Rocky Point Sugar Mill was established by Carl Heinrich Heck in 1878 on Mill Road (and crosses the boundary between Woongoolba and Steiglitz). Despite being one of the oldest sugar mills in Australia, it is still privately owned by the Heck Group. There were once other sugar mills in the area, but they have now closed and Rocky Point has expanded to replace their lost capacity. In the , Steiglitz had a population of 441 people.

He resigned from his position with the U.S. Navy during the McCarthy era, when he found it impossible to refute anonymous charges that he was disloyal to the U.S. Early years Stephen Brunauer was born Istv√°n Brunauer on February 12, 1903, to a Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary. His father was blind and his mother worked as a seamstress. He emigrated to the United States in 1921 and attended City College of New York and Columbia University, majoring in English and chemistry. He received his A.B. from Columbia in 1925. He pursued graduate studies in chemistry and engineering, earning his master's degree in 1929 from George Washington University, where he was a student of Edward Teller, who later described his confidence in asserting his theories and challenging his teachers. While a student, he belonged briefly to the Young Workers' League, a Communist front organization. He later described it as \\"a glorified social club with dances and picnics and infrequent participation in picket lines and strikes.\\" Government career He became an American citizen around 1925 and began working for the Fixed Nitrogen Research Laboratory of the U.S. Department of Agriculture in Washington, D.C., in 1928. He married Esther Delia Caukin in 1931, an expert in international relations who worked for the American Association of University Women and, after 1944, for the U.S. State Department. They lived in Washington, D.C., with the exception of one year of living in Baltimore while he earned his doctorate from Johns Hopkins University in 1933. They had a son in 1934, who died December 1937, and two daughters in 1938 and 1942. His doctoral thesis led to the development of BET theory, based on work he did with Paul H. Emmett and Edward Teller. He left the Department of Agriculture following the attack on Pearl Harbor and joined the U.S. Naval Reserve and by 1942 was heading its high explosives research group in the Bureau of Ordnance. He recruited Albert Einstein as a consultant to the Navy in 1943. Einstein had corresponded with Esther Brunauer before the war when he was trying to help German academics find employment in the U.S. At the end of World War II, having reached the rank of commander on November 9, 1945, he left military service and became a civilian employee of the Navy with the same responsibilities as before. He visited Hungary to investigate the state of scientific research there and assisted several scientists in emigrating to the U.S. The personal contacts he made during this trip with may have provided the basis for questions raised about his loyalty to the United States in the 1950s. The Atomic Energy Commission denied him a security clearance because of his earlier membership in the Young Workers' League, but he continued to work as a government scientist.Richard M. Fried, Nightmare in Red: The McCarthy Era in Perspective (Oxford University Press, 1990), 23-5, 27 He successfully passed several other security reviews that his work required and became chief chemist in the Research and Development Section of the Navy's Bureau of Ordnance. In 1950, when Senator Joseph McCarthy launched the anti- Communist crusade known by his name, McCarthyism, he named Esther Brunauer as one of the State Department employees whose loyalty he questioned. The Senate's Subcommittee on the Investigation of Loyalty of State Department Employees known as the Tydings Committee, which was investigating McCarthy's charges against her, exonerated her in July.Fried, Nightmare in Red, 26 The U.S. Navy suspended Stephen Brunauer's security clearance on April 10, 1951, In consequence, his wife was suspended by the State Department and subjected to another security review as well. Two months later, on June 14, when it appeared that the Navy was going to deny him his security clearance, he resigned saying he feared the process \\"must have been a source of embarrassment and inconvenience to the Navy\\". He said the review process left government employees defenseless because they \\"cannot learn the identity of those who have given derogatory information\\" and \\"much of the information on which the charges are based is withheld\\". He called the experience \\"costly, disheartening and nerve-wracking\\". He acknowledged his association with the Young Workers' League in the 1920s, but said that he had been a \\"strong anti- Communist\\" for 18 years. His wife was forced from the State Department on June 16, 1952, identified as a \\"security risk\\" without explanation. She said she thought the \\"official reason\\" was her marriage but the real reason was \\"political expediency\\". After government service He found work with the Portland Cement Association in Chicago. He became chair of the chemistry department at Clarkson University in 1965 and the first director of the Clarkson Institute of Colloid and Surface Chemistry, retiring in 1973. His first wife died in 1959. In 1961 he married Dalma Hunyadi, a Hungarian-born professor at Clarkson. Together then wrote a book about the nineteenth-century Hungarian poet and dramatist Dezs≈ë Kosztol√°nyi.Review by G√°bor Kem√©ny of Dezs≈ë Kosztol√°nyi (M√ºnchen, 1983) He died on July 6, 1986, in Potsdam, New York, and was buried in Potsdam, New York. The day before his death he completed a research paper evaluating BET theory. Upon his death, the American Chemical Society called him \\"undoubtedly one of the most highly respected surface scientists of our time\\". It said that \\"in 1951, his career again underwent a marked change of direction\\", omitting any mention of his security clearance problems. The American Ceramics Society bestows the Brunauer Award annually in his honor. Clarkson bestows its Brunauer Award to a graduating senior annually. = Writings = * The Adsorption of Gases and Vapors, Volume 1 (Oxford University Press, 1943) * \\"Einstein in the U.S. Navy\\", in Burtron H.

The society has also been active among the Ewes in southeastern Gold Coast, now Ghana. The mission was engaged in New Zealand and India prior to concentrating its activities in Ghana from 1847. Reverend Johan Hartwig Bauer was the first Inspector and he established a school for missionaries in Hamburg. History Missionary Andreas Pfisterer 1899 at the mission school in Akpafu, Trans-Volta Togoland, which was at that time a German colony but is now Ghana V√∂lkner's gravestone on the church wall in Opotiki The North German Mission was founded in 1836 by Lutheran and Reformed missionary associations in Hamburg. Missionary Carl Sylvius V√∂lkner arrived in New Zealand on behalf of the Society in 1849 and was murdered there by the MƒÅori as a missionary of the Church Missionary Society (CMS) in 1865 , provoking a military backlash. The matter is known in New Zealand as V√∂lkner Incident. The church in Opotiki is named \\"St Stephen the Martyr\\" after him. After the first activities in New Zealand and India, the mission concentrated its work from 1847 on the area of the settlement area of the Ewe in the then slave coast . It has been based in Bremen since 1851 and is known in West Africa as Bremen Mission or Mission de Br√™me. Pastor Cornelius Rudolf Vietor a founding member in 1851, was the chairman and president of the board from 1868‚Äì1888. Johann Carl Vietor , a merchant in West Africa, was a member of the company's executive committee. The mission area was divided between the two colonial powers, the United Kingdom and France in 1890: it was a foreign mission on the British ruled Gold Coast and a national mission in German Togo. Embedded in this colonial field of tension, the North German Mission tried to find its way between the fronts. In Togo, it maintained its independence from the government within the school system by preferring the native language Ewe to the colonial language German. It also sought to preserve the traditional local structures. During this era, the head of mission, inspector Franz Michael Zahn (from 1862 to 1900), was known to have a colonial-critical attitude, which is born by submissions in the German parliament. There was a change under his successor Schreiber (from 1900 to 1924) towards an uncritical attitude towards the colonial powers. During the First World War , the German Togoland colony was conquered by the French and British. 52 mission employees were detained. After the division into British and French mandates, community support from the mission was prohibited. Close contact with Bremen however remained. The occupation of the mission area by the Western Powers was a first step towards the independence for the young West African church. In 1914 it had approximately 11,000 members, 14 pastors and 237 religious teachers. In May 1922, local representatives of the missions met in Kpalim√© for a synod. The colonial government had banned the participation of Europeans. The assembly declared the union, independence and unity of the parishes as the \\"Evangelical Ewe Church\\". Pastor Robert Kwami became its first leader and Synod Clerk. Between 1923 and 1939, the North German Missionary Society was again able to send its people. The previous one-way traffic from Germany to West Africa gradually gave way to a sibling partnership. The 150 lectures given by the African Synod Secretary, Robert Kwami in 82 locations in northern Germany were accompanied by a racist Nazi campaign in Oldenburg shortly before Hitler came to power. The so-called Kwami affair not only caused a sensation in Germany but Dutch and English daily newspapers also reported on this prelude to church struggle. After Togo and Ghana gained independence from the colonial powers, the churches there asked the North German Mission for assistance. In 1961, employees who did not act as missionaries were sent to Togo and Ghana. In 1980 the four German churches listed in the \\"Members\\" section merged into a common mission. In 2001, the Eglise √âvang√©lique Presbyt√©rienne du Togo and the Evangelical Presbyterian Church, Ghana, which resulted from the missionary work, were included in the North German Mission as equal partners in a new statute. =Christian mission and written language= The yellow area is the original distribution area of the Ewe language When the missionaries of the North German Mission arrived in Africa, there were several dialects of the highly developed Ewe language, which only existed as spoken, not as written language. The missionaries learned the language and developed a script from Latin letters with the addition of phonetic characters. The missionaries worked out Bible translations, catechism, song and school books in the new written language. The four Gospels were translated by the missionary Johann Bernhard Schlegel (1827‚Äì1859) and printed in 1861. There followed the book of the Acts of the Apostles and the letters of Paul, Peter, James and Judas, which were translated by the missionaries Weyhe and Merz.The Epistles of Paul, Peter, James and Juda in the Ewe language. Printed by JF Steinkopf for the British and Foreign Bible Society, Stuttgart 1875 Schlegel had decided to choose the Anlo Ewe dialect for the creation of the written language, which is spoken mainly in the western part of the language area on the coast. In 1856/57 he published a ‚ÄúKey to the Ewe Language‚Äù. The entire New Testament was available in 1877 in the translation of the missionary Merz. The missionaries Jakob Spieth and Gottlob D√§uble edited the present translations and published a second edition of the Gospels, Acts, and Letters. The First Book of Moses in the Old Testament, Genesis, was printed in Ewe in 1870, followed by the Psalms,The book of Psalms in the Ewe language. Bremen 1871. Printed by C. Hilgerloh. Translated by missionary Weyhe then the Book of Joshua, the Book of Judges and the Book of Ruth,The books of Joshua, Judges and Ruth in the Ewe language. Bremen 1875. Printed by C. Hilgerloh.

Translated by Missionary Merz and the prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah.The Prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah in the Ewe language. Printed by J. Frese. Bremen 1889. Translated by Missionary Merz Johannes Kn√ºsli wrote an Ewe-German-English dictionary in Europe from 1887‚Äì88.Keta 1891. 1084 pages After his death on 23 May 1891, his widow Anna Kn√ºsli published the \\"lithographic\\" dictionaryGerman-Ewe dictionary. By Anna Kn√ºsli. Bremen 1892. 413 pages Ewe-German-English in 1891. A complete edition of the Bible was available in 1913. The final design of the font was done by Diedrich Hermann Westermann who, at the turn of the century, in the service of mission, developed a comprehensive dictionary with over 15,000 words, which first appeared in 1905 and completed a final grammar of Ewe in 1907. Westermann returned from Africa in 1907 due to illness and retired from serving as a missionary, but remained an honorary member of the North German Mission. Members The North German Mission is a mission of six partner churches that work on an equal footing in the mission. The partner churches in Germany are the Evangelical Church of Bremen, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Oldenburg, the Evangelical Reformed Church in Germany and the Church of Lippe, in Africa the Evangelical Presbyterian Church of Togo (EEPT) and the Evangelical Presbyterian Church, Ghana. Tasks \\"The proclamation of salvation in Christ for the salvation of lost souls\\" - this is how the task of the North German Mission was understood exclusively for many years. After Togo's political independence, the church developed its own missionary approach there: ‚Äú'The whole gospel for all people'. Salvation in Christ is that God wants to make the whole world we live in new. According to Genesis 2:7 \\"God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul.\\" The ‚ÄúNorth German Mission‚Äù understands ‚Äúsoul‚Äù to mean the whole person and focuses its work on him. Many development aid projects are designed to enable people to live a human life. The transition from the old \\"pagan\\" religion to Christianity is no longer in the foreground. The goal is rather the realization of the Word of God in the different areas of life of the people. The evangelical mission should become concrete in people's daily lives. They should be able to live together in a protected environment in peace and justice. Testimony and Gospel Every year on Trinity Sunday, the North German Mission invites all to a partnership service in its partner churches. A 300-page four-language children's Bible in Ewe, German, English and French was developed and illustrated together with groups of girls and boys from Africa and Europe. Bible translation Johann Bernhard Schlegel and Andreas Jakob Spieth were early Bible translators of the mission society. Intercultural learning, development Happy children in front of a primary school in GhanaThe school is run by the EPC and supported by the North German Mission The member churches of the North German Mission in the two African countries operate over 600 of their own primary and secondary schools, several high schools (Mawuko, Saboba, Tatale, Hohoe, Badou, Lom√©-Agbal√©p√©dogan, Tado) and teacher training centers (Amedzofe and Bimbilla). The German member churches provide help with the establishment and operation of the training centres. Scholarships are often awarded. Music education is also a focus. The African partner churches maintain, partly together with other churches, training centres for pastors and catechists in Porto Novo, Atakpam√©, Peki and Accra. Vocational training: The churches also organise handicraft training for young people in tailoring, secretarial skills, housekeeping, tailoring, carpentry, building trade, electrical installation and in the use of computers for example in Alavanyo, north of the provincial capital Ho between the Volta reservoir and the Togolese border. The Evangelical Presbyterian Church offers vocational training in the \\"E. P. Church-Trades Training Center Alavanyo\\". This also includes computer courses and a course for secretaries. At the same time, the young people are taught how to prevent HIV / AIDS.. The construction of a well near Kpalim√© in TogoThe North German Mission provided financial support for the construction of the well, which is equipped with a solar- powered underwater pump Nutritional advice and new cultivation methods.for example in Nots√©, where the agricultural advisory program of the Evangelical Church in Togo (EEPT) propagates the cultivation of pineapples. There are also rural development and advisory centers or model farms in Chereponi, Yendi, New Ayoma, Ho, Dambai, and Moyen Mono. Small animal husbandry and new products are propagated.Snail farming, mushroom farming, fishing, beekeeping, small animal breeding The North German Mission supports many development aid projects with a focus on sustainable agriculture. Protecting the rainforest, reforestation and combating bushfires are all part of this. An important topic: water. Wells are built and equipped with solar pumps. Women‚Äôs work: Bible studies, literacy courses, training centres, and income-generating projects such as bread baking or handicrafts. Ghanaian women managing microcredit.The North German Mission financially supports the church in Ho and also helps to provide the necessary initial capital for the microcredit. The granting of small loans is organized by women. This enables small business projects such as handicrafts, fish trade, grain trade and hairdressing salons. This project is based on ideas similar to those of Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus . Women's programs in particular are often about generating additional income. Youth work: Self- help projectsfor example in Kessibo, Adaklu Wumenu assist young people to find employment. Children: An education campaign is fighting child slavery. Street children are reintegrated into their families through a counseling program or receive support to attend school. Many children cannot go to school because they have to take care of the younger siblings while their parents are working. That is why the Protestant churches of Ghana and Togo have set up qualified kindergartens for example in Kwamikrom, Lom√© and preschools in their congregations . Food security: In Northern Togo, the women's department of the Evangelical Church is working on buying soy, rice and n√©r√© at harvest time and later selling it again at moderate and fair prices. Democracy and human rights : These include free elections, pluralistic democracy, reconciliation between hostile political groups, the fight against child trafficking, peace work in the broadest sense. Peace work: Seminars for non-violent conflict resolution are organized. An office in Lom√© is working to combat illegal gun ownership. Projects are carried out to achieve the goals.Example: In 2007 the North German Mission invited delegates from the European Union, from Togolese civil society, from partnership and human rights groups and from development aid organizations to a conference on \\"Democracy and Human Rights in Togo\\". The municipality in Dokplala took the initiative to build this pharmacy.The North German Mission provided funds for the construction of the building and for a basic set of medicines Diakonia The six churches work closely together to promote aid agencies and promote existing projects, with new institutions being created over and over again. The goal of ‚Äúhelping people to help themselves‚Äù is often recognizable, the start-up financing is intended to help the poorer sections of the population to create their own earning opportunities. Young people, women and the elderly are the focus of the diaconal work. Curative medicine: EEPT and E. P. Church maintain numerous health centres, hospitals and pharmacies.for example in Bladjai, Dambai, Dzemeni, Agou-Nyogbo An important principle of health work is disease prevention. This includes counselling and regular examinations of the children in the villages, family planning, AIDS education programs and support for AIDS orphans and people infected with HIV. Organised vaccinations against tetanus, polio and measles. Social work: The E. P. Church runs a centre for life and family counselling. To prevent ethnic conflicts, the Church is involved in peace work. Prison counselling supports prisoners in Ho, Ghana. Literature * Werner Raupp (ed.): Mission in source texts.

Environmental issues Sign about environment remediation, Gilberton, 2014 Gilberton has acid sulphate soil in naturally water-logged conditions. The lowering of the water table due to drainage work on the Pimpama River allows oxidisation of the iron sulfide to create sulphuric acid which can, in turn, enable the release of iron, aluminium and other heavy metals, doing damage to both the natural and built environment. Application of lime to neutralise low pH levels and the maintenance of broad shallow drains to reduce oxidisation are used to mitigate the problem. Gold Coast Intra Regional Transport Corridor The proposed Gold Coast Intra Regional Transport Corridor will connect Gold Coast suburbs from Coomera to Carrara with a multi-modal urban arterial road by 2031. It is proposed to reserve a land corridor from Coomera to Stapylton for future extensions; on current plans, this land corridor will pass through Gilberton near the confluence of Sandy Creek and Halfway Creek.

It was first recorded in print by John A. & Alan Lomax in their jointly authored 1938 edition of Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads. Like many folk songs, it is known by a variety of titles, such as \\"Rambler, Gambler,\\" and \\"I'm a Rambler, I'm a Gambler\\" The song begins with the lines \\"I'm a rambler, I'm a gambler, I'm a long way from home / And the people who don't like me, they can leave me alone.\\" Its lyrics mention two towns in Texas, Belton and Saline, as well as the state of Wyoming. History John Lomax did not include the song in his original 1910 edition of Cowboy Songs and Other Frontier Ballads, but it appears in the 1938 edition, co-authored with his son Alan.Lomax, John A., Edward N. Waters, and Alan Lomax. Cowboys Songs and Other Frontier Ballads. New York: Macmillan, 1938. pp. 266-267. The younger Lomax recorded that they learned the song from one Alec Moore, whom he described as a \\"retired cowpuncher ‚Ä¶ whose present occupation is riding herd on an ice-cream wagon on the streets of Austin, Texas.\\" Alan Lomax recorded his own rendition for his 1958 LP Texas Folksongs (Tradition Records, TLP1029). In September 1960, 19-year-old Bob Dylan recorded the song ‚Äî his second-earliest known solo recording session. The recording can be found (titled \\"Rambler, Gambler\\") on The Bootleg Series Vol. 7: No Direction Home: The Soundtrack. Joan Baez performed the song live in the early 1960s; a 1963 recording is included in some editions of Joan Baez in Concert, Part 2; her 1989 album Speaking of Dreams included a medley of the song, paired with The Del-Vikings' \\"Whispering Bells\\", performed with Paul Simon. Other notable performers to have recorded the song include Odetta (as \\"Rambler-Gambler\\"), Simon & Garfunkel (as \\"Rose of Aberdeen\\"), Flatt & Scruggs, Gordon Bok (as I'm a Rambler, I'm a Gambler\\"), Ian & Sylvia (as \\"Rambler Gambler\\"), and Sandy & Caroline Paton (as \\"I'm a Rambler and a Gambler\\").

Having originally coined the term \\"paleoart\\" to refer to science-based paleontological illustration, Hallett remains one of the most influential masters of modern dinosaur imagery. He currently lives in Dallas, Oregon. Biography Hallett has considered himself a paleoartist since 1974 and he began his work at the San Diego Natural History Museum. He has been published in a number of museums, magazines and books including Life, Smithsonian, and National Geographic. He has worked as a teacher, a designer and an art director, and was also a consultant on the major films Jurassic Park and Disney's Dinosaur. In 1986, Hallett's paleontological paintings experienced a major tour in the United States, the United Kingdom, continental Europe, Japan and Australia, and appeared in numerous museums including the American Museum of Natural History and the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. He is also the recipient of several major awards, including the annual Lanzendorf Paleoart Prize given out by the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, which he won in 2002. Hallett cites the painter Charles R. Knight as one of his major influences. He describes his process of creating artwork as first preparing for weeks researching the available material including original fossils, consulting with paleontologists on likely behavior, and researching modern analogues before starting sketches of the anatomy and scenes for the final painting.

It is, like the current edition of the OED, an online-only publication; there is no hardcopy available at this point. Creating DCHP-2 The process started with the scanning and digitization of the first edition of the dictionary (DCHP-1). The online version of DCHP-1 was made publicly accessible in 2013. The main data collection phase for the DCHP-2 lasted from 2007 to 2010 and included 36,000 new citations derived from the 7,000 new potential headwords found in The Canadian Oxford Dictionary and other sources.Introduction to DCHP-2 Potential headwords and citations were cross- checked with other varieties of English using web data and entered into the Bank of Canadian English, a quotation filing system, to be proofread and edited. The potential headwords and citations were then classified into one of the six categories of Canadianisms according to their distinctive histories in Canada, cultural significance, or usage frequency.  Reception  Since its launch on March 17, 2017, public reception to the dictionary has been good. About 40 users (in late 2017) consult the dictionary a day.

History In 1913, the Boston and Maine Railroad (B&M;) built its repair yards in North Billerica off High Street, which were named the Billerica Repair Shops. This complex expanded into a large industrial park that is now called Iron Horse Park. Pan Am Railways now own the site and still have their main offices in the park, but the old B&M; repair yards and buildings are no longer in operation, although the railroad tracks remain in use as there are a couple of rail customers in the park area. The employees of the Billerica Repair Shops built a small neighborhood behind the old Faulkner Mills along the railroad line, adjacent to the depot, starting in 1904. This neighborhood became known as Garden City because of the large flower gardens the residents would have in their yards. Based on the Garden suburbs in England, Garden City can be considered one of America's oldest suburbs, according to the October 2, 2005 edition of the Lowell Sun. Today, only a few houses still have these gardens, but the old name still remains. Some of the streets in the neighborhood were built on the old track beds of the Billerica and Bedford Railroad where it ran spur lines between the depot, round house, and the loading dock of the old mills. In the 1980s, the former shops became a Superfund site. Occasionally, a small freight train will run down the old Billerica and Bedford track from the depot to the Salem Road Crossing and switch onto the parks spur line to deliver and pick up cars from customers, including the Boston Globe's distribution plant, and exit the park onto the main Lowell Line and return to Boston. Iron Horse Park is the dividing line between North Billerica and East Billerica.

The Liberal Party boycotted the poll in protest over last year's election campaign. This resulted in another conservative majority. The assembly convened on 10 December 1882. Unlike last time, the conservatives showed a surprising degree of independence, that was shown primarily against the Russians. Disagreements over foreign and domestic policies (such as railway construction) led prince Alexander I and the Assembly to stand against Russian influence and restore the constitution on 6 September 1883.

For its entire length, it is an urban corridor of the Augusta metropolitan area. It connects Evans and Martinez with Augusta. Even though Georgia does not sign its county highways, except for on green street signs, Wheeler Road is Columbia County Route 573 (CR 573). It is named for Joseph Wheeler, an American military commander and politician. He had the rare distinction of serving as a general during wartime for two opposing forces: first as a noted general in the cavalry of the Confederate States Army in the 1860s during the American Civil War, and later as a general in the United States Army during both the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War near the turn of the twentieth century. For much of the Civil War, he served as the senior cavalry general in the Army of Tennessee and fought in most of its battles in the Western Theater. Between the Civil War and the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Wheeler served multiple terms as a United States Representative from the state of Alabama. Route description Wheeler Road begins at an intersection with Georgia State Route 383 (SR 383; South Belair Road) on the Evans‚ÄìMartinez line in the southeastern part of Columbia County, where the roadway continues as South Old Belair Road. The highway travels northeast through Martinez proper for approximately to an intersection with Beverly Road, where Wheeler Road curves to the east- southeast. At the intersection with the southern terminus of Hardy Road, it curves back to the northeast. It then intersects the southern terminus of Flowing Wells Road (CR 164) and the western terminus of Mason McKnight Jr. Parkway. Here, Wheeler Road turns to the right and travels to the south- southeast. Immediately, it has an interchange with Interstate 20 (I-20; Carl Sanders Highway). Within this interchange, the road enters Richmond County (and the city limits of Augusta) and curves to the southeast. Wheeler Road travels just south of Doctors Hospital. Just southeast of the hospital is an intersection with both the southern terminus of Medical Center Drive, which leads to the hospital itself, and the northern terminus of Augusta West Parkway, which mostly serves as a frontage road for the western side of I-520 (Bobby Jones Expressway). Here, the roadway curves to the east-northeast. Just over later, Wheeler Road has an interchange with I-520. On the eastern side of the interstate is an intersection with the southern terminus of Robert C. Daniel Jr. Parkway and the northern terminus of Marks Church Road, the latter serving as a frontage road for the eastern side of I-520. The highway travels just to the south-southeast of Augusta Exchange, a regional retail park. At an intersection with Walton Way Extension, the road narrows from four lanes to two. After that intersection, it transitions into a more residential corridor. Just west of an intersection with the southern terminus of Regent Drive, the highway gradually curves to the east-southeast and travels between Langford Middle School, Tutt Middle School, and Westminster Schools of Augusta. Wheeler Road skirts along the southern edge of Big Oak Park and Westover Memorial Cemetery.

Biography Holger Glinicki was born in Hamburg on 25 October 1952. He was paralysed following a motorcycle accident in 1972 that broke his fourth thoracic vertebra. He became involved in disability sports, playing wheelchair basketball for RSC Hamburg, who were the German national champions in 1983, and played a total of 123 international games. He became assistant coach of the German women's national wheelchair basketball team in 2003, and then coach in 2006. The team won five consecutive European championships, in 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009 and 2011, and a silver medal at the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing. The German team started off slow in its games against the United States and China at the 2012 Summer Paralympics, winning these games by slim six-point margins. Marina Mohnen thought that they played their best basketball only in the final minutes of a game.

It was the first gold medal that Germany had won in women's wheelchair basketball at the Paralympics since 1984. They were awarded the Silver Laurel Leaf by President Joachim Gauck in November 2012, and were named Team of the Year for 2012. Glinicki celebrated by plunging off Canary Wharf into London's River Thames. He was named Hamburg's coach of the year for 2012. Glinicki was philosophical about the win, noting in December 2012 that there were many awards and ceremonies, but that the memory of London was fading over time. He returned to coaching his club team, Hamburger SV (now renamed BG Baskets Hamburg), which included national team members Mareike Adermann and Edina M√ºller (and Australia's Bridie Kean). It went on to win the national championship for the eighth time in 2013. The national team was not so fortunate, losing the European Championship to the Netherlands by a point, 56‚Äì57, before a home town crowd in Frankfurt in July 2013. In April 2014, Glinicki coached BG Baskets Hamburg to a win in the final of the International Wheelchair Basketball Federation Euro League Challenge Cup, its first International title, with a 62‚Äì54 over the Frankfurt Mainhatten Skywheelers.

Biography Marina Mohnen in Birmingham in July 2010 Marina Mohnen was born in Bitburg on 31 October 1978. Mohnen majored in economics (business education). Mohnen began playing basketball when she was eleven, but in 1999 she suffered a severe anterior cruciate ligament injury. She took up wheelchair basketball as a 4.5 point player, initially playing for her home town team in Bitburg, but she subsequently moved to Koblenz, then to Bonn, and then to Cologne, where she now lives again after a stint in Italy. As part of RSC K√∂ln from 2004 to 2009, she played an important role in the rise of the team. She then moved to the Italian club S.

In September 2008, Mohnen participated in the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing, her first, but the German team was beaten in the gold medal game by the United States, and took home Paralympic silver medals. After the Paralympics, the team's performance was considered impressive enough for it to be named the national \\"Team of the Year\\", and it received the Silver Laurel Leaf, Germany's highest sporting honour, from German President Horst Koehler. Mohnen beat Olympic gold medallists Britta Heidemann, Marion Rodewald and Oksana Chusovitina, and long-distance runner Sabrina Mockenhaupt, to take the title of Cologne's Sportswoman of the Year for 2008. Mohnen was part of the team that won the European Championship for the sixth time in a row in Nazareth in 2011, thereby qualifying for the 2012 Summer Paralympic Games in London. As part of the team's preparation, they toured the United States and Australia. Mohnen was captain of the team in London. In the gold medal match in London, the team faced the Australia women's national wheelchair basketball team, who had defeated them 48‚Äì46 in Sydney just a few months earlier, in front of a capacity crowd of over 12,000 at the North Greenwich Arena, that included Mohnen's mother Kati and sister Sonja. The German team had been undefeated up to that point, but had started slowly in its games against the United States and China, winning both games by six-point margins, and seemed to play their best basketball only in the final minutes of a game. They defeated the Australians 44‚Äì58 to win the gold medal, the first that Germany had won in women's wheelchair basketball since 1984, a 28-year period. Mohnen contributed eleven points. They were awarded the Silver Laurel Leaf by President Joachim Gauck in November 2012, and were named Team of the Year for 2012. Bitburg honoured Mohnen by entering her name into the Golden Book of the City. In July 2013 the team lost the European Championship to the Netherlands before a home crowd of 2,300 in Frankfurt by a point, 56-57.

Bowden designed the coachwork of Healey's Elliott, an influential British sports car. He was also the designer of the Spacelander, a space-age bicycle which was commercially unsuccessful when in production, but has since become a collector's item. Early life and career Bowden was born in North Kensington, London on 3 June 1906. He received violin training at Guildhall, and completed a course in engineering at Regent Street Polytechnic. Automobile design A 1948 Healey Elliott, designed by Bowden In 1925 Bowden began working as an automobile designer for the Rootes Group. By the late 1930s, Bowden was chief body engineer for the Humber car factory in Coventry. During World War II, he designed an armored car which was used by Winston Churchill and George VI. In 1945, he left the Rootes Group and formed his own design studio in Leamington Spa with partner John Allen. The studio was one of the first such design firms formed in Britain. Bowden designed the body of Healey's Elliott, which, in 1947, was the first British car to break the 100 mph barrier. Working with Achille Sampietro who created the chassis, Bowden drew the initial design for the auto directly onto the walls of his house. Shortly before his departure to the United States Bowden penned a sketch design for a two-seater sports racing prototype, the Zethrin Rennsport, being developed by Val Zethrin. This used the same wheelbase as the short-chassis Squire Sports, and was dressed in a contemporary all-enveloping streamlined body. This design theme was carried through to his subsequent work on the early Chevrolet Corvette and Ford Thunderbird. Bicycle design =The Classic= The Bowden Spacelander bicycle, prototype designed in 1946; manufactured 1960. Brooklyn Museum For the 1946 exhibition Britain Can Make It, Bowden submitted a design for a highly streamlined bicycle which he named the Classic. The bicycle was constructed of pressed aluminium and featured a driveshaft and a hub dynamo that stored energy when riding downhill and gave a boost when riding uphill. Although the bicycle's unusual appearance created substantial public interest initially, British bicycle makers were reluctant to invest in the high degree of re-tooling needed to manufacture the bicycle. In 1949 Bowden pursued the possibility of having the Classic manufactured in South Africa, but, according to Bowden, abrupt changes in South African import policy prevented that plan from materializing. =The Spacelander= Multicolored Bowden Spacelanders on display at Bicycle Heaven In 1952 Bowden emigrated to Windsor, Ontario before moving to the United States. While in Muskegon, Michigan in 1959, he met with Joe Kaskie, of the George Morrell Corporation, a custom molding company. Kaskie suggested molding the bicycle in fibreglass instead of aluminium. Although he retained the futuristic appearance of the Classic, Bowden abandoned the hub dynamo, and replaced the drive-train with a more common sprocket-chain assembly. The new name, Spacelander, was chosen to capitalize on interest in the Space Race. Financial troubles from the distributor forced Bowden to rush development of the Spacelander, which was released in 1960 in five colours: Charcoal Black, Cliffs of Dover White, Meadow Green, Outer Space Blue, and Stop Sign Red. The bicycle was priced at $89.50, which made it one of the more expensive bicycles on the market. In addition, the fibreglass frame was relatively fragile, and its unusual nature made it difficult to market to established bicycle distributors. Only 522 Spacelander bicycles were shipped before production was halted, although more complete sets of parts were manufactured. Bowden designed a third iteration of the bicycle, called the 300, but only a small number of prototypes were ever made. Beginning in the 1980s, there was a resurgence of interest in the Spacelander as a collectors item. Two bicycle enthusiasts, John Howland and Michael Kaplan, purchased the rights to the Spacelander name from Bowden, and have manufactured a small number of reproductions and replacement parts. The first reproduction was sold in 1988 for $4,000. The reproduction's design has been modified to improve durability.

It was founded by the Society of Jesus in 1885. It is situated in the centre of the city on the corner of Mary Street West and Brown Street. History =Foundation= The parish started as The Church of the Nativity and St Agnes, it was staffed by Jesuits from their main centre, the Mission of the Immaculate Conception for the Fort William First Nation. The first priest for St. Agnes' was Fr. Richard Baxter SJ. In 1887, the newly created church was blessed by the Bishop of Peterborough, Thomas Dowling.Piovesana, Hope and Charity, pp. 24-29. From 1907 to 1909, the local population increased by 50%, so the church size was expanded. A basement was added and a separate presbytery was built. Plans were drawn up for an elementary school and it was opened in 1910. =Construction= On 24 May 1914, a building permit was obtained for the construction of a permanent brick church. On 26 July 1914, the foundation stone was laid by Bishop David Scollard, the first bishop of Diocese of Sault Sainte Marie. The church was completed on 15 January 1915. One month later, the Jesuits handed administration of the church to the Diocese of Sault Sainte Marie. =Reconstruction= On 29 April 1952, the Diocese of Fort William was created and the parish was part of the new diocese. On 26 February 1970, it was renamed as the Diocese of Thunder Bay.History from Diocese of Thunder Bay retrieved 4 April 2014 In July 1965, the parish priest of thirty years, Monsignor A. J. Hogan, retired and the first bishop of the new diocese, Edward Jennings, invited the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate to administer the parish. By 1969, the parish had paid off the debt incurred from its construction, and funds began to be collected for the building a new larger church.Piovesana, Hope and Charity, pp. 126-27. In 1979, a building committee was formed. By 1981, $500,000 had been collected. The last Mass at the old church was celebrated on 31 May 1981. On 6 June 1982 the new church was dedicated and opened.Piovesana, Hope and Charity, pp. 225-227. In 1995, the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate handed over the church back to the Diocese of Thunder Bay who continue to serve the parish. Parish The church has four Sunday Masses. There is one at 5:00pm on Saturday evening, 9:00am and 11:00am on Sunday morning and at 7:00pm on Sunday evening.

The accident sequence began when an improperly secured load of large pipes broke loose from a gondola car on an eastbound freight train. The loose pipe, dragged by the moving train, damaged the westbound passenger track. A passing westbound freight train crew notified the first train and stopped to assess what had happened. A fast westbound passenger train could not stop and derailed from the damaged track, colliding with the westbound freight on the adjacent track. Finally, an eastbound fast passenger train struck the derailed equipment from the first two trains. There were 21 deaths and 49 people were injured. This accident holds the record for the most trains involved in a single accident. Site The accident occurred on the mainline of the Erie Division at a point 2.4 miles east of Conneaut and 1861 feet from the Ohio - Pennsylvania state line. This was on the famous Water Level Route, a four- track mainline where fast passenger trains from the Midwest ran on an almost gradeless route to New York. The main tracks here, from south to north, were designated as No. 4, eastward freight; No. 2, eastward passenger; No. 1, westward passenger; and No. 3, westward freight. It was raining at the time of the accident. The distance between the center-lines of adjacent tracks was 13 feet. Accident =Trains involved= * Extra 1871 East was an eastbound freight consisting of two diesel-electric units 103 cars and a caboose. It was moving on track No. 4 at a speed of 36 miles per hour. * Extra 1736 West was a westbound freight powered by two diesel-electric units pulling 120 cars and a caboose. It was moving on track No. 3 at a speed of 31 miles per hour. * No. 5, the New York to Chicago Mohawk, was a first-class passenger train consisting of two diesel-electric units, a mail car, two express cars, one baggage car, two coaches, one sleeping car, one club-sleeping car, two sleeping cars, and one observation-sleeping car. It was proceeding westbound on track No. 1 at a speed of 76 miles per hour. * No. 12, the New York to St. Louis Southwestern Limited, was also a first-class passenger train. It consisted of two diesel-electric units, one baggage-dormitory car, two coaches, one dining car, two sleeping cars, one coach, four sleeping cars, and one observation-sleeping car. It was traveling eastbound on track No. 2 at a speed of 71 miles per hour en route to New York City from St. Louis. =Events= * Immediately east of the point where the accident occurred Extra 1871 East met Extra 1736 West moving on track No. 3. The flagman of Extra 1871 East observed the stop signals given with a white light from the rear platform of the caboose of the west-bound train. He acknowledged the signals and immediately informed his conductor. The brakes of the train were then applied from the caboose by the use of the conductor's valve. The train stopped with the front end in the vicinity of Springfield, Pa., 3.2 miles east of the point of the accident. The flagman immediately proceeded westward to provide flag protection and the conductor inspected the train. * The seventy-third car of 1871 East, Baltimore and Ohio 254645, was loaded with 58 pieces of pipe. Each pipe was approximately 35 feet long and 18 inches in diameter. The conductor found the side stakes had broken on the north side of the car and part of the lading had fallen from the car. He observed that the ends of high tension bands used to secure the load were trailing over the sides of the car, counted 49 pieces of pipe on the car, and later made a notation on the waybill that nine pieces of pipe were missing. After he completed his examination of the car he uncoupled it from the rear portion of the train and instructed the front brakeman to assist in the movements necessary to set out the car on an adjacent auxiliary track. Before the car was set out he communicated by telephone with the train dispatcher to inform him of the delay to his train and that some pipe pieces were missing from the car. The dispatcher then informed him that the accident had occurred. * The crew of Extra 1736 West approached the point of the accident on track No. 3 at a speed of 31 miles per hour. When the locomotive passed the point at which the accident occurred, the crew did not observe any defective condition of the tracks or any obstruction on or near the tracks. The flagman proceeded to the rear platform of the caboose to inspect Extra 1871 East moving on track No. 4. He observed sparks flying from the vicinity of the running gear of a car about midway of that train. When its caboose passed, he gave stop signals with a white light which were acknowledged. He then entered the caboose and informed his conductor of the defective condition he had observed * Immediately afterward, No. 5, moving on track No. 1, was approaching the point where the accident occurred at a speed of 76 miles per hour. The train was moving on a curve to the right and was passing Extra 1736 West moving on track No. 3. The engineer then observed that the track immediately in front of his locomotive had been shifted northward toward track No. 3. Before he could move the brake valve to the emergency position, the locomotive was derailed and collided with Extra 1736 West. At about the same time the locomotive of No. 12 passed the locomotive of No. 5. *As No. 12 was approaching the point where the accident occurred at 71 miles per hour. The engineer made an emergency application of the brakes when the locomotive was passing the locomotive of No. 5. The fireman observed fire flying as derailed equipment obstructed track No. 2 immediately in front of the locomotive. The collision occurred before the speed of the train was materially reduced. No. 12's locomotive and the first 10 cars were derailed and collided with Extra 1736 West. * The seventy-sixth car of 1736 West was struck by the derailed locomotive and equipment of No. 5 and the seventy-fifth to the ninetieth cars, inclusive, were derailed. Immediately after the collision occurred, the derailed equipment of No. 5 which obstructed track No. 2 was struck by train No. 12. The derailed cars of Extra 1736 West stopped in various positions on or near the westward main tracks. The seventy-eighth, eighty-first, eighty-second and eighty-fourth cars were destroyed. The seventy-sixth, seventy-seventh, and eightieth cars were badly damaged and the other derailed cars of this train were somewhat damaged. * A separation occurred between the locomotive and the first car of No. 5. The diesel- electric units remained coupled and stopped about in line with the track and with the front end about 740 feet west of the point of the accident. Both diesel-electric units were badly damaged. Separation occurred at each end of each of the first six cars and these cars stopped in various positions on and across the tracks and intermingled with the derailed equipment of Extra 1736 West. The seventh car stopped with the front end against derailed equipment on track No. 3 and the rear end on the train structure of track No. 1 end the other derailed cars stopped in line with that track. The first six cars were destroyed and the other derailed cars of this train were badly damaged. * The locomotive and the first nine cars of No. 12 derailed. Separation occurred between the locomotives and the first car. The locomotive units stopped in diagonal positions with the front end of the first unit south of the westward main tracks and about 95 feet east of the point of the accident. The second unit stopped at right angles to the tracks and with the front end against the left rear corner of the first unit. Both units were badly damaged. The first four cars stopped in diagonal positions intermingled with the derailed cars of the other two trains and the other derailed cars stopped about in line with the track. The first two cars were destroyed and the other derailed cars of this train were badly damaged. Rescue effort The accident site was isolated from any main road. Only a muddy dirt lane led from the crash site to a major road two miles south, and it soon became blocked by vehicles mired in the mud. The injured were either carried on stretchers or moved by hand car to the nearest road. Some waited up to four hours for help. About 100 persons were treated on the scene and 62 were transported to hospitals. Investigation The Interstate Commerce Commission investigated the accident. Their findings indicated that the lading of Baltimore and Ohio car 254645 on Train Extra 1871 East was not properly secured for movement when loaded because the high tension bands were not properly sealed. Because the load was not properly secured, nine sections of pipe fell from the car while in transit. When the pipes fell from the car in question, one piece wedged between the track structure of track No. 1 and the next car, a boxcar. As the train proceeded at a speed of 36 miles per hour the resultant thrust transmitted by the pipe to track No. 1 moved track No. 1 northward a distance of about 18 inches before the pipe fell clear of the cars. The damaged condition of the track was not observed before passenger train No. 5 arrived at the point of the accident. The track was sufficiently damaged to cause the derailment of train No. 5 which in turn caused the derailment of Extra 1736 West. Passenger train No. 12 struck the derailed equipment of passenger train No. 5 before protection could be provided.

The novels follow Qiang Ba, an expert on Tibetan Mastiffs, and his mentor Fang Xin, as a mysterious letter pulls them into a convoluted search for a hoard of Buddhist treasure hidden during the persecution of the 9th century Tibetan emperor Langdarma. Elements of Tibetan culture, geography, and mythology are prominent throughout the story, alongside modern aspects of intrigue and globetrotting. The series' first two novels were posted online and publication began quickly after an interested publisher bought the rights in 2008. It became an instant success, with the ten novels selling a combined 10 million copies. A film adaption, co-produced by the newly formed Oriental DreamWorks and China Film Group, was announced, but was cancelled. Background He, an ethnic Han Chinese, grew up in ethnically Tibetan Sichuan province and lived for more than a decade in Tibet itself. He developed a love for trekking though the Tibetan landscape, even undertaking a solo trek through the Hoh Xil region (known for being the world's third-least populated area). He started writing The Tibet Code in 2005 as a short adventure story about the pursuit of a rare breed of Tibetan Mastiff, while still working full-time as a part of a medical staff. But as the plot expanded, he turned to a daily consumption of books and historical texts about Tibet (reading more than 600 books on the subject). The story was initially posted online and attracted a small readership of about 30,000, until 2008, when it first attracted the attention of publisher Hua Nan. Hua quickly bought the rights and rushed the series to print (some critics, suspicious of such deeply researched material being published so quickly, accused He of \\"fronting a secret collective of collaborators\\", which he denied). The series, initially titled The Last Temple, was rebranded by the publisher as The Tibet Code, in a nod to the bestselling novel The Da Vinci Code. Film adaptation In April 2013, DreamWorks Animation announced an adaption of The Tibet Code as the first project of its newly formed Chinese venture, Oriental DreamWorks, in collaboration with China Film Group. DreamWorks Animation CEO Jeffrey Katzenberg described the film as \\"be[ing] for China, like the Indiana Jones and The Da Vinci Code films\\" and having \\"all the makings of a world-class, quality, blockbuster franchise.\\" China Film Group chairman Han Sanping suggested that the film could also \\"represent traditional Chinese culture and Chinese morality\\" to the world. In June 2015, Los Angeles Times reported that the film adaptation had been cancelled. According to Katzenberg, his company could not come to terms with the producer who owned the rights to the book. =Criticism= The announcement of DreamWorks' participation in a film about Tibet, a region often associated in the West with accusations of human rights violations and forced cultural assimilation, was greeted by some anti-China critics as pandering to the Chinese government for access to the country's lucrative film market. At the announcement press conference, Katzenberg stressed that \\"the books themselves are not political. The movie shouldn't be assumed to be controversial and political.\\" References Category:Book series introduced in 2008 Category:2008 novels Category:2000s adventure novels Category:2000s fantasy novels Category:Chinese adventure novels Category:Chinese fantasy novels Category:Fantasy novel series Category:Novel series Category:Chinese novels adapted into films Category:Tibet in fiction ","title":"The Tibet Code"},{"id":"42405898","title":"Members of the Victorian Legislative Assembly, 1889‚Äì1892"},{"id":"42405956","text":"To Proino is a television morning program airs on ANT1 on 14 October 2013 every Monday to Friday at 10am to 1pm, It was hosted by Giorgos Liagkas and Fay Skorda, featuring Giorgos Lianos, Sasa Stamati, Themis Georgantas and Laura Narges are the persons who had been selected to be with Giorgos and Fay.

He was originally known as a member of the hip hop group The Team. After the group went on hiatus, he was the one member of the group to break out as a solo artist. He was signed to rapper The Game's The Black Wall Street Records and Capitol Records in 2006. While signed there he released the EP Doin' That. However, he wasn't signed to them for long, before deciding to go back to releasing music independently via Moe Doe Entertainment. After returning to just that label, he has released two EPs: Bass Rock and Playboy. He also released the song \\"Slow Down\\", which was featured on the video game Grand Theft Auto V. He blends hyphy with street-styled rap.  Musical career  Carson started his professional rapping career by selling his debut mixtape The Story Vol. 1 out of the trunk of his car in 2001. After sneaking backstage at a TRL concert he met producer Ty Fyffe, who he forged a close friendship with. Shortly after he moved to New York City with Ty Fyffe, staying there for almost a year. There he joined Fyffe to studio sessions with rappers such as Jay-Z and Cam'ron. This increased his confidence. On meeting, Fyffe he stated \\"I wanted to get up out of Oakland. This was before they were playing local music on the radio, other than E-40.\\" Then in 2002, Carson moved back to California and formed the hip hop group The Team, with local Bay Area rappers Mayne Mannish and Kaz Kyzah. They released a project on local legend Keak da Sneak's record label and got put into local radio rotation. They then gained more popularity in late 2005 after releasing the singles \\"Just Go\\" and \\"Bottles Up\\" to promote their third studio album, World Premiere, which peaked at number 95 on the US Billboard Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums chart, and number 50 on the Billboard Top Independent Albums chart.[ ((( The Team > Charts & Awards > Billboard Albums )))]. All Media Guide, LLC. Retrieved on April 4, 2014. However the album was interminably delayed, blunting its impact. With the help of rapper The Game and his Black Wall Street Records, Carson secured a major record label deal with Moedoe and Capitol Records in 2006. On his signing, he asserted \\"As a rapper, there's no ceiling in L.A. [like there is in the Bay].\\" He followed that by touring with The Game. Carson released his debut retail EP Doin' That on September 4, 2007., which was supported by the single \\"Doin' It\\" featuring Sean Kingston. Plans were then revealed for a debut album to be released by Black Wall Street and Capitol titled Theater Music, however it would be pushed back indefinitely. He explained the deal falling through by saying, \\"timing wasn't right\\", the person who signed him left the label and the studio head died. However, Carson would not be officially released from Capitol until 2009. To celebrate his independence, Carson released his second EP Bass Rock on July 21, 2009 by Moe Doe Entertainment. It was released for digital download and made available in select record stores. In December 2011, Carson reunited with The Team to record the song \\"Slow Down\\". Then on June 26, 2012, \\"Slow Down\\" was released as a single by Universal Music Group. Following its release, a DJ named J-12 invented a dance specifically for the song, inspiring dozens of kids to upload their own versions to YouTube.

The remix would feature Gucci Mane, E-40, The Game, and Dom Kennedy in place of his The Team comrades. Off the strength of the song, The Team performed the song at Hot 97's Summer Jam. \\"Slow Down\\" would then be included on The Team's reunion EP, Hell of a Night. As it would turn out, the song would also be the first single from his second official mixtape S.T.S.A. (Something To Speak About). S.T.S.A. featured guest appearances by E-40, Iamsu!, Problem, and B-Legit. It was completely produced by The Team collaborator Sho Nuff. Following its release he begun working on his next project. He released the song \\"Pour Up\\" as the first single for his next EP on June 4, 2013. \\"Pour Up\\" would later be remixed with additional verses by The Game and Young Jeezy.

On March 4, 2014, Carson released Playboy via Moe Doe Entertainment. It takes its name from the rapper Too Short's nickname Playboy Short. The EP contained production from DJ Mustard, League Of Starz, Dez Dynamic and Sho Nuff, with guest appearances including D-Lo, August Alsina and Master P. It was met with generally positive reviews. Jameel Raeburn of XXL said, \\"A lack of variety may be the main detractor for new listeners on Playboy EP, but overall the project is filled to the brim with tracks that slap.

Life and career Born in Dunfermline, Scotland, on 19 January 1913, Kellock studied in Edinburgh and worked at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, before coming to Australia in the 1930s. In the United Kingdom, he specialised in stained glass, textiles, fabric printing, dye mixing and pottery work, including glass mixing. Kellock was appointed Head of the Art Department at the Hobart Technical College and examiner in history of architecture for the RAIA in Tasmania from 1939 to 1941. He was in charge of the art school at Geelong Grammar School and moved to Ballarat in 1946, where he began his stained glass business and was also art teacher at the Ballarat School of Mines. Kellock was a fellow of the British Society of Master Glass Painters, a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in London and an associate of the Stained Glass Association of America. Artistic philosophy In 1946, Kellock wrote \\"Appreciation is not a mere matter of caprice; we must not be satisfied by 'This pleases me, That does not' ... We may learn to feel more widely and to ... find pleasure in qualities which at first were not apparent. Even as artists we should understand and practise appreciation, for a sympathy with others is of value in completing and enriching our own work. We are not only artists, we are also human beings ... Unless art is of some use to humanity and makes life better and richer, humanity will pass it by ... Under all forms of art, there lies a common principle. The human mind is capable of ... a scientific or intellectual form ... an emotional or imaginative form ... It is this touch of emotion and imagination which is the essence of art.\\"Taylor-Kellock, 'The Appreciation of Art', S.M.B. Students' Magazine (1946), p 19. Commissions Kellock carried out a wide range of commissions for Australia's leading church architect, Louis Williams, in his churches, chapels and schools, with fifty- five windows for St Mark's Chapel, Flinders Naval Depot (Westernport) in Victoria; seventeen windows for St John's in Camberwell, Victoria; St Giles' in Murrumbeena, Victoria; Geelong Grammar school chapel in Geelong, Victoria; All Saints' Newtown, Geelong; St Andrew's, Brighton; St Mark's in Red Cliffs, Victoria; St George's in Parkes, New South Wales; All Saints' in Canowindra, New South Wales, and St Stephen's, Adamstown, New South Wales; St Edmund's, Wembley, Western Australia; St David's Cathedral in Hobart, Tasmania; St John's, Devonport, Tasmania, Holy Trinity, Ulverstone, Tasmania.. The stained glass Kellock made for St Mark's Chapel, honouring Royal Australian Navy crews and ships lost in action, was among his most outstanding achievements. Kellock also worked for other architects and his memorial windows are in the Littlejohn Memorial Chapel in Scotch College, Melbourne, Melbourne Grammar School Chapel, St John's, Beaufort, Victoria; St Augustine's, in the City of Moreland; St Paul's Ballarat; St John's, Balian, Christ Church Cathedral, Grafton, New South Wales, Methodist church, Albury, New South Wales and windows in Brisbane and Tasmania.

He received the 2011 Harvey Award for Most Promising Newcomer for his work on the Thor: The Mighty Avenger, and won a 2013 Eisner Award for Best Penciller/Inker for his work on The Rocketeer: Cargo of Doom and Daredevil. He was also nominated for the 2006 Russ Manning Most Promising Newcomer Award. Early life Chris Samnee grew up in De Soto, a nearby suburb of St. Louis. His earliest experiences superheroes came through the Super Friends cartoon. He was not aware of the print source material for those cartoons until his grandmother began buying him three-packs of comics from a grocery store. His first comic book was a Batman book that he read when he was five or six years old, and that became his favorite character. He began copying the work of 80s artists whose work he was exposed to, like Tom Mandrake, Jim Aparo and Alan Davis. He would also research those who influenced these artists, such as comic strip artist Milton Caniff, whom Samnee read in an interview in Comics Journal was an influence on Aparo, and Frank Robbins. Samnee's grandmother further encouraged Samnee to expand his reading to the Dick Tracy comic strips found in a collection at a local library. By his mid-teens he was also heavily interested in Japanese manga and anime.\\"Chris Samnee: The Devil is in the Details, Part 1\\". Toucan: The Official Blog. May 31, 2013. Samnee was about 10 years old when he realized he wanted to produce comics for a living. He convinced his parents to drive him an hour and a half to the airport Holiday Inn, where local comics conventions were held, and where he would bombard writers and artists with questions on how to produce comics and break into the industry. One particularly helpful creator was Conan artist Mike Doherty, who advised him on what to draw, and gave him some 11 x 14 Marvel Comics illustration board to draw on. Samnee was so in awe of holding professional board with the Marvel logo printed on it that he could not bring himself to draw on it, and in a 2013 interview, indicated that he still had it. Career Samnee was 15 when his first work was published, art for an eight-page Silver Age Batman-type story for Gary Carlson's book, Big Bang Comics, which was being published by Image Comics at the time. He was not paid for the work, but did the job as stepping stone to future paid work. He would continue working odd jobs, such as flea market caricature artist, a pizza cook, a cable guy in order to pay bills until he could find paying comics work. He did unpaid art for FemForce for AC Comics while working as a barista at Borders Books. He drew the Oni Press graphic novel Capote in Kansas around 2004 or 2005, inking his own pencils because that book's budget did not provide for an inker. That work was published in 2006, and Samnee was nominated for the Russ Manning Most Promising Newcomer Award. Today he inks his own pencils, as he describes his pencils as \\"just awful\\", and not something he would envision another person inking. While he was still working at Borders, he signed a contract to do a graphic novel for Vertigo, though it would be months before the writer finished the script that Samnee could begin drawing. During this time he did some short stories, American Splendor an issue of Exterminators that Tony Moore had recommended him for, and three issue of Queen & Country with writer Greg Rucka. Prior to doing the last issue of Queen & Country, he drew an issue of Area 10 for Vertigo. In 2009 Samnee drew a story written by Ed Brubaker for Daredevil #500. That same year he drew The Mighty for DC Comics, working with writer Peter J. Tomasi. Tomasi would later recommend Samnee to draw a couple of short stories he wrote for DC's 2009‚Äì2010 \\"Blackest Night\\" storyline. Tomasi would also subsequently hired Samnee to illustrate the latter portion of Tomasi's creator-owned Image Comics series, Battlegrounds, when the initial artist on it, Peter Snejbjerg, was forced to leave it before completing it. In 2010, Nate Cosby offered Samnee the art duties on the all-ages book Thor: The Mighty Avenger. Though Samnee initially was apprehensive about not being the right fit for that character, after reading Roger Langridge's script, he accepted the job, which garnered him his first major notice from readers of the superhero genre, and the 2011 Harvey Award for Most Promising New Talent, as well as nominations for Best Artist and Best New Series. He remained on that series, drawing all eight issues before it was cancelled in March 2011. In 2012 Samnee drew Ultimate Comics Spider-Man #6. That same year, he returned to Daredevil as the regular artist on tha series with writer Mark Waid, beginning with issue #12. He continued on that series until issue #36 and both he and Waid remained as creative team when Marvel relaunched that series with a new #1 issue in April 2014. Techniques and materials Samnee uses 300 series two-ply Strathmore Bristol board. He does not use non-photo blue pencils or any other equipment purchased at specialty stores for preliminary sketching, but uses .9 mm mechanical pencils that he purchases from Target. For inking he formerly used a sable hair Rafael 8404 number 3, 4, and 5, but found that he was able to produce convention sketches more quickly with implements that could be easily stored in pencil bags or pencil boxes, like brush pens, which eliminated the need to clean brushes and the worry about spilling ink, and eventually began using these tools for his professional work as well. The brush pens he uses include Zebra and Kuretake models, though most of his work is with a Pentel color brush, whose synthetic hair and refillable, squeezable barrel allows Samnee to controls the amount of ink on the brush. According to Samnee, this implement feels similar to a dipped brush, but does not require cleaning, and allows him the convenience to work wherever he wants.\\"Chris Samnee: The Devil is in the Details, Part 2\\".

It is one of 138 sites containing 521 stone structures that were built around the Lake Victoria region in Kenya. The main enclosure of Thimlich Ohinga has walls that vary from 1 to 3 meters in thickness, and 1 to 4.2 meters in height.The Mystery of Thimlich Ohinga Fort on Lake Victoria, 2011-03-16, The Star The structures were built from undressed blocks, rocks, and stones set in place without mortar. The densely packed stones interlock. The site is believed to be more than 550 years old. The area is occupied by the Luo people. 'Thimlich' means \\"frightening dense forest\\" in Dholuo, the language of the Luo. 'Ohinga' means \\"a large fortress\\" in Dholuo. Inhabitants and architectural style The Thimlich Ohinga area has been speculated to have been inhabited by a Bantu speaking people that mysteriously vacated the area sometime prior to colonization of Kenya. There has not been extensive research on the actual builders of the Thimlich Ohinga structures, but some sources concur that perhaps the proto-Gusii/Kuria or proto-Luhya inhabited the Thimlich Ohinga area. However, these speculations are shaky given that the mentioned tribes lack the terms \\"Thimlich\\" and \\"Ohinga\\" in their lexicon. The terms \\"Thimlich\\" and \\"Ohinga\\" are found the Dholuo lexicon and the area is traditionally inhabited by the Luo. Migrants from Uganda, Rwanda, Sudan, and Burundi are believed to have also made their way through the area, some of whom ended up going south into Tanzania. It was vacated for the last time during the first half of the twentieth century. The architectural style of the Thimlich Ohinga mirrors the building style of the Great Zimbabwe Empire, 1,900 miles / 3,600 kilometres to the south in Zimbabwe, albeit smaller in size. Another difference is that Great Zimbabwe architecture was built with shaped stones, however, like Thimlich Ohinga, the utility of mortar appears to have been avoided. Thimlich Ohinga is an example of defensive savanna architecture, which eventually became a traditional style in various parts of East and Southern Africa. It portrays stone-built homesteads practices and a communal, centralized system of control, which became prevalent in the Lake Victoria region. Later forms of this stone-walled architecture can be seen on some traditional houses in Western and South- Western Kenya. Oral histories suggest that Thimlich Ohinga was constructed by the then-inhabitants to serve as protection against outsiders in Kadem, Kanyamwa areas, as well as from neighbouring ethnic groups from what is now Tanzania - but as the names suggest, (Kadem is an example of a Luo name) the present names came about after the Luo began to inhabit the area. For reasons yet unknown, Thimlich Ohinga was abandoned by the original builders. Over time, other communities moved into the area in the period between the 15th and the 19th centuries and those who lived within the complexes maintained them by repairing and modifying the structures. The re-occupation and repair did not interfere with the preservation of the structures. Aside from being a defensive fort, Thimlich Ohinga was also an economic, religious, and social hub. Archaeological research carried by the National Museums of Kenya has unveiled the manufacture of goods like pottery, and also yielded human and animal bones. Inside the structures, are partitions of various kinds like corridors, smaller enclosures and depressions. Some of the compartments include games sections where men played games like 'ajua', and grinding stones where women ground grain. Livestock pens for cattle, sheep, goats, chicken, ducks, guinea fowl and retaining walls for gardens were also built. The entryways were purposefully made small, so that potential intruders would be quickly subdued by guards in a watch tower near the entrance. It is easy to scan the whole complex from the watchtower built from raised rocks. Inhabitants of Thimlich Ohinga also had smaller side forts which had houses, meal areas, animal pens, and a granary. Etymology Neville Chittick, the former Director of the British Institute of History and Archaeology in East Africa, documented the site in the 1960s. Researchers from the National Museums of Kenya commenced work on the site in 1980. Once called \\"Liare Valley\\" after a valley to the north-east of the area, Thimlich Ohinga was gazetted as a Kenyan National Monument under its new name in 1981. The name was changed because \\"Liare Valley\\" did not describe the exact location of the site. Location Thimlich Ohinga is located 181 kilometres south of Kisumu in Migori county, on a gentle sloping hill 46 kilometres north-west of Migori town near Macalder's Mines. The other 137 sites that resemble it are concentrated in the areas of Karungu, Kadem-Kanyamkago, Gwassi, Kaksingiri Lake headlands, Kanyidoto and Kanyamwa. Conservation The Kenya Wildlife Service, and the National Museums of Kenya have designated Thimlich Ohinga a conservation site. Wild animals like guinea fowl, various species of monkeys, birds and antelope live in the forests surrounding the site. The National Museums of Kenya submitted a request to UNESCO, on behalf of the government, requesting the inclusion of Thimlich Ohinga Cultural Landscape on the World Heritage Site. The location has become a World Heritage site in 2018.

Written by keyboardist Don Walker and vocalist Jimmy Barnes, it was released as a single in 1978, peaking at number 65 on the Australian charts. It appeared as a track on the 1979 album Breakfast at Sweethearts. Details The single, \\"Goodbye (Astrid Goodbye)\\" preceded the album Breakfast at Sweethearts by some months, and was recorded when demos were being done for the album. The single is markedly different from the later album version, with a doubled guitar riff and a less prominent piano. A fast-paced rocker, lyricist Walker said the song was written because the band, \\"needed a set finisher.\\" Described as, \\"the band's blazing showstopper,\\" it was often played as the last song in concerts, and also on the live album Swingshift. Lyrically, the song is written from the perspective of a husband leaving his wife. Opening with the lines, \\"Open up the door Astrid, cause I'm comin' down the stairs / And I ain't gonna listen to no more pissin' around\\", the three verses are all addressed to the wife. The lyrics were originally written for a completely different song that was sung by Ian Moss before being given to Barnes to write matching music. Walker later said he knew no-one named Astrid, and he had probably heard the name in relation to Bill Wyman's wife. Although included in Cold Chisel's greatest hits collections, the single received little airplay at the time of release. Reception Critic Toby Creswell described the song as a rudimentary 12-bar thrash. He said the song is, \\"full of wit and attitude. The Narrator lets fly his scorn for the woman's lifestyle. All the bottled-up anger spews out. Taking three chords and a simple story and transforming them into a unique and confronting piece like this takes real genius.\\" Reviewed at the time of release, Roadrunner said, \\"Radio play is the chief objective of Cold Chisel's \\"Goodbye\\". It's a good, basic rock song with great vocals.

Maximilian Lenz (4 October 1860, Vienna ‚Äì 19 May 1948, Vienna) was an Austrian painter, graphic artist and sculptor. Lenz was a founding member of the Vienna Secession; during his career's most important period, he was a Symbolist, but later his work became increasingly naturalistic. He worked in a variety of media, including oils, watercolours, lithography and metal reliefs.  Life  Copper relief from the Fourteenth Exhibition of the Vienna Secession (1902) Lenz studied at the Kunstgewerbeschule in Vienna, then at the Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna under Carl Wurzinger and Christian Griepenkerl. A member of the Vienna K√ºnstlerhaus spent the early 1890s in South America, designing banknotes in Buenos Aires. In 1897, Lenz left the K√ºnstlerhaus to become a founding member of the Vienna Secession, and his work for the group's first exhibition was hailed as \\"outstanding\\". His 1899 painting, A World (Eine Welt, also translated as A Day Dream), draws on the time's prevailing currents, including dreamlike and fantastic imagery painted in intense colour. It was shown at the Fourth Exhibition of the Vienna Secession in spring 1899, and received critical praise for its \\"graceful charm and dreamy yet sparkling beauty\\" and its mood of \\"pure grace and musical euphony\\". The painting was also shown in winter 1911-12 with the Munich Secession. Having shown his picture On the Way to Wonderland at the Tenth Exhibition of the Vienna Secession in 1901 and the Thirteenth Exhibition in spring 1902, at the Secession's Fourteenth Exhibition in the summer of that year (the 'Beethoven exhibition') he showed a number of reliefs in various metals, which were noted as beautiful and inventive. Some of his copper panels were also shown at the 1904 World's Fair in St Louis. Summer Lust (1906) However, a foray, together with various other Secession artists, into woodcuts for the Beethoven exhibition catalogue was panned as \\"rough\\" and more like the work of an amateur than an experienced painter, but was also found to be enthusiastic not totally without merit. With Gustav Klimt, Lenz visited Ravenna in the winter of 1903-04, where they saw and were influenced by the golden mosaics. At the Twentieth Exhibition in 1904, Lenz's painting Iduna's Apples, was considered to be one of the highlights amongst the paintings shown, along with the works of Klimt and Rudolf von Alt. The large painting, similar in style to Aubrey Beardsley, created a \\"gorgeous\\" effect of gold and black: a black-haired woman sits in a lush landscape, wearing only a golden crown and sat on a golden cloak, holding Iduna's apple‚Äîalso golden‚Äîin her hands. Within the Secession, for the first decadeLenz was a Pre-Raphaelite influence; after 1910, his work showed more naturalism, and he moved away from the foreground after 1918. Art nouveau  A Song of Spring (1913). Lenz served on the Secession's official committee in 1905 and again in 1906. He also exhibited with the Secession in spring 1906, showing the Forest King and the Wailing Maiden; in 1907; in 1908 at the Twenty-Ninth Exhibition; in 1909 and 1910, showing the playful painting Marionnetes; in 1911, showing Concert; in 1913; and as part of a collective exhibition in 1941. His 1913 painting A Song of Spring was influenced by the dancer Isadora Duncan's 1904 stay in Vienna, sharing her symbolic themes of cyclic renewal and rebirth and featuring mediaeval costume. These ideas and a connection with dance are also prominent within Klimt's work, and the Symbolist movement as a whole. Lenz also painted religious themes, including The Baptism of the Ethiopians. During World War I, Lenz created several posters advertising Austro-Hungarian war bonds. In 1926, he married Ida Kupelwieser (1870‚Äì1927), the daughter of the jurist Karl Kupelwieser. He left the Secession and rejoined the K√ºnstlerhaus in 1938.  Selected works  A 1917 poster advertising war bonds, designed by Lenz. * Spring. Colour lithograph, 1898, 13.97 x 15.08 cm.

Background and composition The song has highly pandeistic- sounding overtones, as it derides conventional religious belief in Heaven and Hell while affirming a religious belief under which one ought to \\"live life to the fullest.\\" In his autobiography, Jennings related of I Do Believe that, \\"when I finished the song, and before the Highwaymen recorded it, I showed it to Will\\" -- that being 'bootleg preacher' Will D.

It also appeared on the Red Hot and Country video. It was covered by Bonnie Bramlett on her 2008 album, Beautiful.Blues Revue, Issues 110-115, 2008, p. 68.

Biography  Trollmann became in 1880 an officer in the infantry, in 1887 General Staff Officer, in 1903 Colonel, and in 1910 Major General. In 1913 he became Field marshal lieutenant and commanded the 18th Infantry division at the outbreak of World War I.

Music video Though technically a love-related song, it exposed the taboo and hitherto unspoken practice of men punching pregnant women they conceived out of wedlock in order to kill the fetus (del firme impacto de tus manos, \\"the firm impact of your hands\\"Gloria Trevi - Billboard.com) by purposely eye opening lyrics. The music video shows a girl with blood drenching her swollen abdomen (a miscarriage), as well as a child abduction. The lyrics at the beginning of the chorus also goes Yo no puedo reponerme de ese beso que me subio al cielo, que es el mismo que ahora me hunde en el infierno (\\"I cannot recover from that kiss that took me to Heaven, the same one which now plunges me to hell\\"). Effects Later, Trevi herself was sentenced to jail for conspiring with director Sergio Andrade to sexually abuse women. After her acquittal on lack of evidence and release from jail, Trevi in 2007 sued a Mexican promoter who accused her of murdering her own child she lost while in prison.

Of the 13 defendants, three were acquitted and ten, including Olmert, were found guilty. Holyland Park building complex Holyland: Tower 1 (right), Park Towers (left) Holyland Towers is a complex of luxury apartment buildings in Jerusalem, along Highway 50, South of the old city. The developer is Hillel Cherny (alt.: Hillel Cherney, Hillel Charney). Before construction began in 1995, it was the site of Holyland Hotel (Eretz Hatzvi Hotel) and the open air Holyland Model of Jerusalem, now located on the grounds of the Israel Museum. When the old hotel was torn down, an archeological survey revealed a Bronze Age burial ground. The initial plan was to replace the existing hotel with a larger one. This plan was later abandoned in favor of constructing residential housing, which required rezoning. It was the re-zoning process that led to bribery charges. The plan includes a total of 1200 apartments. So far, one skyscraper and seven apartment towers have been built. Holyland Tower 1 (2009), a high building with 32 floors, is the highest building of Jerusalem. A similar Tower 2 is projected. In the same complex are Holyland Park Tower 1 to 7 (2004-2009), each with 15 floors. The Park Towers are connected by air bridges. The architecture is by Carmi Architects, Spector-Amisar, Tishby-Rozio Architects, and Moshe Zur Architects and Town Planners. The buildings are visible from most places in the city. Critics have said they are ugly and intrude on the city skyline. Early allegations In 1996 the journalist Yoav Yitzchak claimed that Hillel Charney, the developer of the project, had obtained a false assessment of the value of the land, which had substantial tax benefits. Based on guidance from the Attorney General, a criminal investigation was launched against the Commissioner of Income Tax, Doron Levy, and his deputy Udi Barzilay. The police investigation did not result in prosecution, but forced Doron Levy to resign. A Disciplinary Committee by the Board of Valuers, which operates as a disciplinary court, opened proceedings against the assessors who were involved in the conspiracy. The two assessors were convicted. In the summer of 2008 Yoav Yitzchak revealed additional suspicions of misconduct in the project, alleging that the developers had bribed the mayor of Jerusalem, Ehud Olmert. This was followed by a \\"draft statement of claim\\" prepared by businessman Schmuel Dachner, who was employed as a real estate consultant and broker by the Holyland project. He claimed not to have been paid him all his expenses and fees due to him, and because his demands were not answered he prepared a \\"draft statement of claim\\" against those involved in the case, and then contacted the police regarding the matter. Bribery investigation and indictment This led to the opening of a police investigation. On April 6, 2010, five were arrested for suspected bribery: Hillel Charney; Meir Rabin, formerly employed by the Holyland project; Eliyahu Hasson, Holyland's accountant; Jerusalem city architect Uri Shitrit and Olmert's former partner and associate, attorney Uri Messer. A sixth suspect, Amram Benizri, was placed under house arrest. In February 2010 the prosecutor's office signed an agreement with Samuel Dachner, which awarded Dachner payment of \\"living wage\\" of 12000 shekels per month. On January 5, 2012, the State Attorney's Office for the District Court in Tel Aviv filed an indictment against 17 defendants, on counts of giving or receiving bribes. The defendants included the prime minister and former mayor Ehud Olmert, Hillel Charney, and Avigdor Kellner, Danny Dankner the deputy chairman of Bank Hapoalim, Meir Rabin, who had worked as an assistant to Schmuel Dachner, Uri Shitrit, former Mayor of Jerusalem Uri Lupolianski, Olmert's former Chief of Staff Shula Zaken, and Jacob Efrati, who headed the Israel Lands Administration. The prosecutors said that the corruption was not an isolated incident, but was part of established business practice, with bribery being used to subvert the planning process by changing zoning laws, overcoming opposition by citizens' groups and enabling violations of construction and pollution regulations. Trial The evidence phase began on 1 July 2012 with the testimony of Schmuel Dachner that he had given money to Shula Zaken. Dachner died on March 1, 2013, several hours after he was cross-examined. Four days after his death his full name was revealed: (until then he was referred to by his initials, SD). Yossi Olmert, brother of Ehud Olmert, confirmed that Samuel Dachner gave him half a million. A few days before giving the verdict in the case, the State Attorney signed a plea bargain with Zaken, sentencing her to 11 months in prison in exchange for the delivery of evidence and incriminating evidence against Olmert. On March 31, 2014, at the end of a trial involving 140 sessions held over two years, Tel Aviv District Court judge David Rosen convicted 10 of the 13 accused and acquitted Yaakov Efrati, the Israel Lands Administration, Amnon Safran and Shimon Galon, former executives at Holyland Park. *Ehud Olmert was convicted of receiving NIS 560,000 ($160,000 US) in bribes. Olmert was acquitted of two other charges of bribery. The judge rejected Olmert's version of events, declaring that he had lied to the court. Sentence: 6‚Äì8 years in jail, and one million NIS fine. *Shula Zaken was convicted of all charges of receiving bribes totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars as well as of money laundering, and was acquitted only of the count of receiving a bribe of ten thousand shekels. Sentence: 11‚Äì41 months in jail, fine 25 thousand NIS, 75 thousand NIS confiscated. *Uri Lupolianski was convicted of accepting bribes totaling more than NIS 2 million. *Avigdor Kelner, founder of \\"Holyland Park\\", was convicted of money laundering and giving bribery.

Early life and education  Page was born and raised in the United Kingdom. According to Page, he was interested in graphic design since he was a child. However, after school he felt that he was more interested in Applied Mathematics and pursued a degree in that discipline. He holds a degree in Applied Mathematics from Queen Mary University of London.  Career  After completing his education, Page joined a property company in a finance position and later got involved in programming and database development. There, he had to create corporate presentations that got him involved in graphic design. In 2007, he participated in a poster design competition that he won. Towards the end of 2009, Page learned that 2009 was the International Year of Astronomy and designed several posters as a personal project. When the International Year of Astronomy organization saw the posters, they contacted page to seek permission to use them. He granted the permission and the posters were used in promotional events. In 2011, he designed 10 posters for the International Year of Chemistry. These posters were later used by the International Year of Chemistry in an official capacity. Each of the posters was inspired by a prominent person in the field of chemistry. He designed a poster inspired by Marie Curie's work, which was used to promote a screening of a film about her life. The International Year of Chemistry also offered the poster prints on their website. As of 2009, Page creates logos, designs and editorial illustrations for organisations and sells prints on his website. He has also worked on designing T-shirts.

Home altars often contain a cross or crucifix, in addition to a Bible, a breviary, a daily devotional, icons of Jesus Christ and prayer beads, among other religious articles specific to the individual's Christian denomination, for example, the images of the saints for Catholics, the Anglican Rosary for Anglicans, the Small Catechism for Lutherans. History Believers have historically hung a Christian cross on the eastern wall of their homes to indicate the eastward direction towards which they focused their prayers. The Christian Treasury traces the origin of the family altar to the prophet Abraham erecting one in the Old Testament (). Since at least the 2nd century, believers such as Hipparchus, hung or painted a Christian cross, to which they prostrated in front of, on the eastern wall of their home in order to indicate the eastward direction of prayer during the seven fixed prayer times, as an \\"expression of their undying belief in the coming again of Jesus was united to their conviction that the cross, 'the sign of the Son of Man,' would appear in the eastern heavens on his return (see ).\\" Syrian Christians viewed their prayers in front of the Christian cross hanging on the eastern wall of their house as symbolizing \\"their souls facing God, talking with him, and sharing their spirituality with the Lord.\\" Many Christians, such as those in the tradition of the Church of the East, continue the practice of hanging a Christian cross on the east wall of their house today; communicants in the Oriental Orthodox Churches today, such as those of the Indian Orthodox Church and Coptic Orthodox Church, pray the canonical hours contained in the Shehimo and Agpeya breviaries respectively (a practice done at seven fixed prayer times a day) facing the eastward direction. Many Christians have built on this ancient custom, with those in the West erecting home altars and those in the East erecting icon corners, usually on the eastern wall of their dwelling place. Purpose and usage A homemade altar made from wood in a traditional Catholic home Home altars usually are adorned with a couple of votive candles and they also sometimes have a small vase of flowers. In many Christian households, individual family members, or the family as a whole, may gather to pray at the home altar. Christian hymns may also be sung there. Family altars are also used to promote the \\"development or intensification of personal piety and godly conduct.\\" It is common for Western Christians to have a prie-dieu in front of their home altar, which provides believers a space to place their Bible and breviary while kneeling before God in prayer. As with certain traditions of Oriental Christianity, some Western Orthodox Christians make use of the prayer rug to provide a clean space for offering Christian prayers to God.

Reorganized as a cadre unit in 1931, it became part of the Kiev Military District when the Ukrainian Military District was split on 17 May 1935. The division transferred to the Zhitomir Army Group of the Kiev Special Military District on 26 July 1938 during another reorganization. The 46th was soon transferred to Irkutsk, assigned to the Transbaikal Military District. It was reorganized under peacetime tables of organization and equipment with an authorized strength of 6,000 personnel in April 1940. When Operation Barbarossa, the German invasion of the Soviet Union, began on 22 June 1941, the division was assigned to the 32nd Rifle Corps of the 16th Army of the Transbaikal Military District, and still stationed in Irkutsk. It was commanded by Major General Alexander Filatov at the time. Sent west, it was wiped out during the Battle of Smolensk in July.

Leo and his life are known only through his letters, written during the reign of Basil II () and addressed to the emperor and various senior church and civil officials. Most of his letters have been dated to the 990s, but some may be later still. The letters also provide some glimpses into his family: he had an uncle who was a bishop (probably also of Synnada), and a full brother. Leo had also an unnamed adoptive father, who died .

Particularly severe overhangs that reach, or nearly reach, the horizontal, are referred to as a roof. In climbing, overhangs and especially roofs place special demands both in terms of technique and equipment as well as the constitution of the sportsman or sportswoman. With increasing steepness the loading on arm and hand muscles increases, because the feet can support less and less of the body weight. Rest points where the muscles can be relaxed, especially no-hands rests, are rarely found in overhangs. Climbing techniques to tackle overhangs include placing the body's centre of mass as close as possible to the rock and striving for the highest possible body tension. Many climbing techniques such as the foothook are almost exclusively used in overhangs and roofs. For a long time in Alpine climbing, roofs were almost always tacked using climbing aids. By contrast, in modern sport climbing, severely overhanging terrain is no longer a rarity, because climbing halls frequently include overhangs and roofs. A well-known natural example of severely overhanging terrain is the rook in the north face of the Western Zinne, whose upper end is about 40 metres horizontally from the foot of the rock face. Severe climbing routes that feature overhangs and roofs include Separate Reality in the USA and La Rambla in Spain.

Special education services in the Commonwealth are provided to students from ages three years to 21 years old. In the 2010‚Äì11 school year, the total student enrollment was more than 1.78 million students with approximately 275,000 students eligible for special education services. Among these students 18,959 were identified with mental retardation and 21,245 students with autism.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Testimony Hearing on Special Education Senate Republican Policy Committee, January 2013 The largest group of students are identified as Specific Learning Disabilities 126,026 students (46.9 percent) and Speech or Language Impairments with 43,542 students (16.2 percent). In order to comply with state and federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act rules and regulations, the School engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress . To identify students who may be eligible for special education services, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Special Education administration. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the District seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the District or contact the district's Special Education Department. The IDEA 2004 requires each school entity to publish a notice to parents, in newspapers or other media, including the student handbook and website regarding the availability of screening and intervention services and how to access them. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for Special Education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Special Education funding structure is through the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) funds and state appropriations. IDEA funds are appropriated to the state on an annual basis and distributed through intermediate units (IUs) to school districts, while state funds are distributed directly to the districts. Total funds that are received by school districts are calculated through a formula. The Pennsylvania Department of Education oversees four appropriations used to fund students with special needs: Special Education; Approved Private Schools; Pennsylvania Chartered Schools for the Deaf and Blind; and Early Intervention. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs.Browne, Patrick., Senate Education Committee Hearing on Special Education Funding & Accountability testimony, November 1, 2011 Over identification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education.Kintisch, Baruch., Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Education Law Center, November 11, 2011 The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students.Amy Morton, Executive Deputy Secretary, Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Pennsylvania Department of Education, November 11, 2011 In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive requiring schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports.US Department of Education, U.S. Department of Education Clarifies Schools' Obligation to Provide Equal Opportunity to Students with Disabilities to Participate in Extracurricular Athletics, January 25, 2013 Charter schools received an increased tuition payment, from the home school district, for pupils who receive special education services. Tuition Students who live in the local school district's attendance area may choose to attend one of Pennsylvania's 157 public charter schools. A student living in a neighboring public school district or a foreign exchange student may seek admission to a charter school operating in a neighboring school district. For these cases, the Pennsylvania Department of Education sets an annual tuition rate for each school district. It is the amount the public school district pays to a charter school for each resident student that attends the charter and it is the amount a nonresident student's parents must pay to attend the District's schools. The 2012 tuition rate for East Penn School District Elementary School students - $8,746.97. School safety and bullying The Seven Generation Charter School administration reported there were zero incidents of bullying in the school in 2012. Additionally, there were no incidents involving local law enforcement and no sexual misconduct with students. Each year the school safety data is reported by the district to the Safe School Center which publishes the reports online. The Seven Generations Charter School Board of Trustees has provided the district's antibully policy online. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the District must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and anti harassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Wellness Seven Generations Charter School provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. Nurses are available in each building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health's extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. A free dental screening is provided at the school. The school does not participate in the federal School Breakfast or school lunch programs. Children are expected to bring their own lunch to school each day. They do provide a small lunch and snack for children who fail to bring a lunch to school. There is a school wide healthy snack plan which lists for parents appropriate snacks to be provided at school. =Highmark Healthy High 5 grant= In 2011, the Seven Generations Charter School received funding through a Highmark Healthy High 5 grant. The School received $6,135 which was used to purchase equipment and implement the Weller Health Education Center's programming on nutrition education.Highmark Foundation, 2011 School Challenge Grants, 2011 Beginning in 2006, Highmark Foundation engaged in a 5-year, $100 million program to promote lifelong healthy behaviors in children and adolescents through local nonprofits and schools. Grants In addition to tuition payments, Seven Generations Charter School applied for several grants to increase its funding. Both the Pennsylvania Department of Education and the Federal government offer several education grants each year. The school administration did not participate in: Science Its Elementary state grants (discontinued effective with 2009-10 budget by Governor Rendell), Education Assistance Grants, 2012 Striving Readers Comprehensive Literacy grant, nor the federal 21st Century Learning grants. =Federal stimulus grant= Seven Generations Charter School received an extra $10,582 in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) - Federal Stimulus money to be used in specific programs like special education and meeting the academic needs of low-income students. The funding was limited to the 2009‚Äì10 and 2010-2011 school years. Due to the temporary nature of the funding, schools were repeatedly advised to use the funds for one time expenditures like: acquiring equipment, making repairs to buildings, training teachers to provide more effective instruction or purchasing books and software. =Race to the Top grant= Seven Generations Charter School officials did not apply for the federal Race to the Top grant which would have provided nearly one quarter million dollars, in additional federal funding, to improve student academic achievement.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Race To The Top Webinar powerpoint for districts December 2009, December 9, 2009 Participation required the administration, the school board and the local teachers' union to sign an agreement to prioritize improving student academic success. In Pennsylvania, 120 public school districts and 56 charter schools agreed to participate. Pennsylvania was not approved for the grant. The failure of districts to agree to participate was cited as one reason that Pennsylvania was not approved.Race to the Top Fund, U.S. Department of Education, March 29, 2010.

The name has been suggested to apply to two different localities, Pitsunda in Georgia and Bor√ßka in Turkey.  Byzantine town  According to the mid-10th century De administrando imperio, Soterioupolis was located on the border with Abasgia, while seal finds attest that it was the capital of a border district or kleisoura. The Escorial Taktikon, written in the 970s, mentions a \\"strategos of Soterioupolis or Bourzo\\", and the contemporary Notitiae Episcopatuum record that it was the seat of an autonomous archbishopric. The site's identification has been disputed: Alexander Kazhdan in the Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium dismisses the suggestions expressed by various authors for an identification with Pitsunda or Sukhumi, and considers Soterioupolis to have been a single site. Werner Seibt and Ivan Jordanov, on the other hand, distinguish between the various references of the name, equating the Soterioupolis of the De administrando imperio with Pitsunda, which in the mid-11th century formed part of a military command with nearby Anakopia, securing Byzantine presence in coastal Abchasia and the northwestern Caucasus in general, where Byzantium had commercial and strategic interests. The seat of the strategos of the Escorial Taktikon, however, is considered to be located further south, at the fortress Bourzo (identified by Nicolas Oikonomides and B. Baumgartner with modern Bor√ßka in Turkey), to which are to be attributed the seals of the kleisourarches of Soteropolis, as well as the references preserved in the collection of miracles of Saint Eugenios of Trebizond, according to which the strategos was a subordinate of the doux of Chaldia.

On 23 May 1953, it was reorganized. The 31st Motor Rifle Regiment became the 135th Mechanized Regiment, the 1062nd Artillery Regiment was formed from the mortar regiment and howitzer battalion, the 85th Separate Motorcycle Battalion became a reconnaissance battalion and the chemical defense company was activated. The anti-aircraft artillery regiment was renumbered as the 1144th in April 1955. In June 1957, the division was reorganized again. The 135th Mechanized Regiment became the 374th Motor Rifle Regiment, the 96th Tank Regiment was disbanded and replaced by the 143rd Tank Regiment and the 78th Heavy Tank Self-Propelled Regiment disbanded. In 1960, the separate tank training battalion was disbanded. In October 1960, the division became part of the 1st Army Corps. On 19 February 1962 the 345th Separate Missile Battalion and separate equipment maintenance and recovery battalion were activated. On 11 January 1965, the division was redesignated as the 78th Tank Division, restoring its original World War II number. In April 1970, the 374th Motor Rifle Regiment moved to the 155th Motor Rifle Division and was replaced by the 5th Guards Motor Rifle Division's 369th Guards Motor Rifle Regiment. At the same time the division transferred to Ayaguz. In 1972, the chemical defense company became the 564th Separate Chemical Defense Battalion. The 1052nd Separate Material Supply Battalion was formed in 1980 from the motor transport battalion. On 24 September 1981, the division became part of the 32nd Army. In 1988, the division was equipped with T-62 tanks and BMP-1 infantry fighting vehicles. On 1 March 1988, it returned to control of the 1st Army Corps. On 4 June 1991 it became part of the reformed 40th Army.During the Cold War it was maintained at 65% strength. In March 1992 it was taken over by Kazakhstan.

Personal details Bill Walton was born April 11, 1923, in Fort Worth, Texas. Walton was a pilot in the Army Air Corps during World War II. He died on April 23, 2001 in Valparaiso, Indiana.https://cushmanfoundation.allenpress.com/Resources/ResearcherGallery/walton  Education  After the war he returned to finish his undergraduate degree at Amherst College; he graduated with an Honors A.B. in geology in 1949. There he worked closely with Fred B. Phleger, a premier academic foraminiferologist (who transplanted his research group to SIO in 1949); this close friendship and joint interest in living foraminifera lasted throughout the lives of both men. Bill's Scripps/UCLA doctoral thesis (1954) under Phleger, was titled \\"The Ecology of Living Foraminifera, Todo Santos Bay, Baja California.\\" His field work employed the RV E.W. Scripps, crewed in part by fellow graduate students.  Rose Bengal Dye  In 1952, while a graduate student, Walton published the paper \\"Techniques for recognition of living foraminifera\\".Walton, W. (1952), Techniques for recognition of living foraminifera, Contrib. Cushman Found. Foraminiferal Res., 3, 56 ‚Äì 60. This would become his most-cited paper as it describes a technique for using a protoplasm stain, Rose bengal, to discriminate between living and dead foraminifera in modern samples. Generations of scientists have used this stain on samples taken from oceans around the world and successfully determined how deep in the sediment living foraminifera were burrowing. The technique has proven controversial with some scientists claiming it tends to \\"overstain\\". Walton considered these claims to be baseless and stated that \\"people are not following the published technique\\".  Professional career  Immediately upon graduation Bill Walton joined Gulf Oil Company in their Research and Development in Pittsburgh as a paleoecologist. Moving to Amoco Oil Company in 1957 he rose from paleoecologist to research director for geology and geochemistry, chief geologist and exploration manager for Latin America and the far east, retiring from that post in 1981. Among his several industry-related honors were the AAPG President's Award and also AAPG Distinguished Lecturer (1972‚Äì73).  Return to Research  From 1981 to 1985, Bill conducted independent research on foraminiferal ecology in his personal laboratory in Barnstable, Massachusetts, very near Woods Hole where he long had had similarly interested associates. Throughout that period, and later, he returned to Scripps on extended visits to conduct studies with Fred Phleger and Wolf Berger. Returning full-time to academia in September 1985, Bill joined Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, as adjunct professor of in the Department of Geological Sciences. There he taught a Senior Linkage Seminar on \\"The Petroleum Industry: Its Success, Its Problems and Its Future\\" and continued his studies of foraminiferal ecology and the comparison of modern salinity- dependent phenotypes with those of the geological record.

The screenplay is by Iqbal Kuttippuram, while Jomon T. John handles the cinematography. The music is composed by Bijibal. The film was released on 25 July 2014. Plot Kunjunni Menon (Santhosh Keezhattoor), a witty thief, loves Lakshmi (Lena), a police constable. While following her one day, he finds out that she wishes to marry a policeman. Vasudeva Shenoy (Anoop Menon), Laksmi's colleague expresses his desire to marry her, despite his mother's objections. Kunjunni poses as a police constable and manages to marry Lakshmi before Shenoy can convince his mother. Shenoy then gets married and both the couples are blessed with baby boys on the same day. In the present, Shenoy's son Vikram (Unni Mukundan) has become an SI and proposes to his childhood friend Deepika (Namitha Pramod) a week before joining. Lakshmi's son Adithyan (Dulquer Salmaan), who has been missing for a few years, returns to town at the same time. The story then proceeds into a series of flashbacks. Lakshmi finds out that Kunjunni had cheated her but they pretend to have an amicable marriage. A young Adithyan however, still believes his father to be a policeman. He and Vikram become rivals in school and start competing with each other, wagering that the loser should salute the winner, a habit they then carry into adulthood. Adithyan always ends up losing. One day Kunjunni is caught red-handed by Shenoy and his team while attempting a theft and is paraded half-naked through the street. A distraught Adithyan and friends watch the scene. Unable to face his son and berated by Lakshmi, Kunjunni commits suicide. Vikram grows up into a hard-working young man while Adithyan becomes quite lazy and does petty illegal activities to gain some pocket money. Adithyan and Deepika fall in love while Deepika and Vikram remain close friends. Once the duo passes their degrees, both decide to apply for the SI selection test. Though the two share a healthy rivalry, Shenoy is spiteful towards Adithyan. Adithyan outranks Vikram in the preliminary round which irritates Shenoy. Vikram however, acknowledges Adithyan's superior intellect displaying his deep respect for his rival. Shenoy is able to trap Adithyan in a narcotics case and desperate to put him behind bars, he guards the evidence personally. But Adithyan is saved when Vikram secretly swaps the evidence with Lactose powder and Adithyan expresses his gratitude, revealing that the respect they hold is mutual. In a final attempt, Shenoy convinces Lakshmi that he was the one who swapped in evidence and asks her for a favor in return. Lakshmi hides the interview memo Adithyan was to receive and only Vikram's name appears on the final rank list. A heartbroken Adithyan blames Lakshmi for Kunjunni's death and claims that she could have changed him had she tried. Adithyan disappears that night. In the present, the police station is holding a small function to commemorate Shenoy's retirement and Vikram taking charge on the same day. Among the notable guests, new sub-collector Lokesh (Nivin Pauly) joins as a surprise to wish the father-son duo. Lokesh later reveals that he and Adithyan are friends and the story proceeds to one final flashback. On a train journey to Delhi, Lokesh stops Adithyan from committing suicide. The two later become close friends and roommates. On Lokesh's insistence, Adithyan prepares for the UPSC exams while doing odds jobs in between. Both of them clear the exam together and Lokesh further reveals that Adithyan is now an ACP, Shenoy's superior. Shenoy is forced to accept defeat and salute Adithyan. Satisfied with his revenge, he decides not to tell Vikram. Vikram manages to find out and salutes Adithyan publicly. The two embrace and acknowledge their friendship. Vikram asks Adithyan to accept Deepika and reveals that his next goal will be to catch up with Adithyan.

Genevieve Catholic Church is a Roman Catholic church located in Ste. Genevieve, Missouri, the first organized European settlement west of the Mississippi River in the United States of America . History The cornerstone of this church was laid down on April 30, 1876. The cross was placed upon the steeple on November 1, 1879, with the building consecrated on September 29, 1880. Three-fourths of the cost of church was donated by Odile Pratte Valle, widow of Felix Valle, a grandson of Francois Valle I. The Catholic faith first came to the Ste. Genevieve area when Jacques Marquette traveled down the Mississippi River in 1673. The parish of Ste. Genevieve was officially started in January 1759 by Jesuits who came from Quebec. Christian and Catholic history in the region goes back at least until the 1750s, although missionary priests from Kaskaskia, Illinois, and across the Mississippi River may have visited the area earlier. It is believed that a church was erected in the area around 1752 or 1754. The earliest marriage record dates back to 1759. The first regular pastor, Jean Baptiste de la Morinie, served from November 10, 1761, until October 15, 1763. The year 1763 was the year of the Jesuit expulsion from French America. The site of the present church has been used as a church since the 1790s when old log church was possibly moved here to higher ground in 1794. An early stone church was erected on this site in 1835 and consecrated on November 12, 1837. The current church was built around the previous stone structure. The foundations of the previous log and stone churches are still visible in the basement of the present church. The present church was designed by Francis Xavier Weiss, a legendary pastor who served the parish of Ste. Genevieve from 1865 until 1900, and was built in a Gothic Revival style. In 1911, the church was enlarged with the rear wall removed and a hexagonal as aspe and two small transepts erected. The church is linked to a 1925 rectory of American Foursquare and Spanish Colonial style. Commandant Francois Valle II and a few of his family members and pastors are buried below the church nave. As of 2013, the church serves about 1,100 families and has about two dozen relics. One relic belonged to Ste. Genevieve, the patron of Paris, and was placed around the neck of her statue inside the church. Between Christmas Eve 2012 and January 4, 2013, some saints' relics were stolen from the church. Afterwards, the relic of Ste. Genevieve was moved to a more secure location.

Born in Barnsley, the early part of his playing career coincided with World War II but he subsequently represented Sheffield United, Nottingham Forest and Coventry City in the Football League. Career Collindridge was working as a miner and playing as an amateur for local side Wombwell Main when he was offered a trial with Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1937. Having failed to secure a contract with Wolves, Collindridge signed an amateur contract with Rotherham United the following summer, remaining with the Millers for a season before turning out for Barough Green, his home-town side in 1938. It was here that Collindridge was spotted by Sheffield United, who signed him on amateur terms in December 1938, and professionally a month later in January 1939. Collindridge was initially utilised in the reserves and did not make his first team debut until October 1939, by which time World War II had commenced and competitive football in England had been abandoned. Playing regularly for United in the wartime leagues, Collindridge also represented Chesterfield, Notts County, Lincoln City and Oldham Athletic as a guest player during the war. By the end of the war Collindridge was established as a first team choice for Sheffield United and he finally made his Football League debut in August 1946 in a 1‚Äì0 home loss to Liverpool. Initially deployed as an outside left Collindridge was increasingly asked to play as a centre forward during this period, despite it not being his preference. In 1950 Collindridge rejected a move to Preston North End but did eventually sign for Nottingham Forest for ¬£12,500 in August 1950. Winning a Third Division South championship medal in 1950‚Äì51, Collindridge remained with Forest for four years before joining Coventry City on a free transfer in June 1954. After a further two seasons with City, and with his career winding down, Collindridge joined non-league Bath City in 1956 before finishing his career with Arnold St Mary's. Personal life Born in the Baraugh Green area of Barnsley, Collindridge worked as a miner in Wombwell Main Colliery during his early playing days and continued this role during the early years of the Second World War.

Plot Thomas \\"Jack\\" Jackmann, an ex-policeman turned GNE security inspector, arrives at the Jevel Afra Drill site, a remote research station in the Central Sahara Desert during a sandstorm. None of the facility's 25 team members, led by Professor Borman, have been heard from in three days, so Jack is sent to check up on them. However, he instead finds the facility abandoned with signs of struggle, cryptic messages scrawled on the walls in Arabic with blood, and even the remains of a ritual where a jackal was skinned and sacrificed. He calls this in to his radio operator Kat at headquarters and sends photos of the writings to be translated. Unable to properly search the rest of the compound due to the storm, he investigates video recordings and discovers that the drill site was established by Borman to investigate a newly-detected air pocket nine miles below the surface. The scientists then began to exhibit signs of paranoia, causing Jack to also feel paranoid and experience a vivid hallucination while trying to sleep in his vehicle. By morning, the storm has cleared and Jack searches the facility in earnest, meeting Dr. Jenny \\"JC\\" Christensen, seemingly the sole remaining member of the science team. She explains that Borman was murdered by the chief geologist and his body was stored in the refrigeration unit along with Dr. Varga who died of a heart attack. Jack calls in the deaths to GNE, but the police are tied up searching for the other missing scientists and his boss Chief Caswell orders to stay put in case anyone returns. JC, meanwhile, is anxious to leave, leaving him suspicious of her having not seen her in video or photos of the team. While he recovers from hitting his head on a crane hook, she attempts to steal his vehicle but he has hidden the keys on his person. A call from Kat then reveals that one of the doctors, Ivanoff, was found alive and that JC did not appear on the crew roster, although JC herself explains this with evidence that due to budget constraints not allowing segregated quarters, Borman falsified her name and gender. JC recounts that, six days prior, the drill had broken through to the cavity and audio sensors on the drill picked up chilling audio of what sounded like human screams. Fearing they had broken through to Hell itself, the crew then began to hallucinate seeing dead loved ones, panic and some even grew violent. At this point, Jack has also begun to see things and act nervous. The two begin to develop a strong attraction to each other while watching the sunset over the desert and they share dinner to celebrate Jack's birthday. He then reveals the severe trauma he deals with after his wife Susan killed herself and their two children six years before over suspicions of him having an affair. Heartbroken, he quit working as a police officer and took the remote work in the desert to try and find peace with himself. To comfort him, Jack and JC sleep together, but his hallucinations worsen due to his resurfaced trauma. In his nightmares, Jack begins to suspect that JC is not human and fears for his life and sanity. Arming himself, he discovers human remains in the site's cesspit and, in a panic, attacks JC in the shower. She tries to subdue him but Jack locks himself in Borman's office and finds a hidden recording of the Professor feverishly explaining that the Devil itself had been released, further convincing Jack that JC is dangerous. Finding her in the kitchen carving meat, her persona has become that of the Devil and convinces him to sell his soul. In reality, she is merely playing along with his delusions in a ploy to get his car keys so she can drive them to get help. Jack finds himself reliving the day of the murder-suicide and wounds JC with a screwdriver before setting the facility on fire. Just then a GNE rescue team arrives and subdues Jack, evacuating them both to a hospital via helicopter before the facility explodes. Jack's superiors Caswell and Inspector Khaled later back up JC's story and presence on the expedition, explaining that the rescued Ivanoff had a sample of a kind of toxic gas released from the underground cavity by the drill. Inhalation of the gas caused the afflicted to lose the ability to differentiate between reality, memory, and imagination, causing irrational behavior in the scientists as well as Jack. JC, meanwhile, was less affected because her quarters were separate from the main compound. The remaining scientists are still missing and presumed dead, having scattered into the desert. Despite these revelations, Jack's paranoia about JC being the Devil quickly resurfaces and stealing a handgun tries to kill her but is stopped by his coworker Alex. His sanity truly broken, Jack finally gives in to his despair and the film ends as he commits suicide to the laughter of his dead wife. Cast Production Val Kilmer was in talks to star in May 2002.

From ancient times many family houses in Kerala have special snake shrines called Kavu or Pambin Kavu where this exotic and spectacular ritual performance is associated to, it is generally conducted to appease the snake gods and thereby to bring prosperity to the family.  History  Snakes and Snake worship, primarily the cobra and associated sub species of snakes have been revered from ancient times all over India. Snakes are always mentioned in Vedic books or they are depicted in famous religious epics like Mahabharata, Vishnu Purana etc. Hindu Gods like Vishnu and Shiva have been associated with snakes. According to Hindu mythology, Lord Vishnu takes rest under the shade of the giant snake, Adisesha. Lord Shiva wears a snake vasuki around his neck. The Nairs of Kerala claim to be Kshatriyas of Nagavanshi descent, thus maybe snake worship was popularized and brought to wider practise by them. Mostly, snakes were seen as a symbol of fertility. Elsewhere in India, snakes are worshiped on Nag Panchami, Nagaradhane and Aashleshabali.  Ritual  Sarpam thullal is generally held to appease snake gods for prosperity of the family or to give an offspring to the couples who may have difficulties in conceiving a child. People generally take a vow is also associated with the ritual and Sarpam Thullal is done after the fulfillment or accomplishment of the vow. But in most of the scenarios Sarpam Thullal is done to ward off any doshas of the family and bring peace and prosperity. The temple astrologer is the one who normally initiates the process or in certain places it is held as an annual or regular practice. Once the date is finalized by the family, the associated Pulluvan family with the temple is informed. It is the Pulluvan and Pulluvathy and their assistants who hold the skills and responsibility of creating the aesthetic requirements for the Sarpam Thullal. They create a pandal and decorate it. The selection of the girls who will later become the mediums or manifestations of Snake Gods is done by the family. Generally two girls/females are supposed to sit in the Kalam but certain places it is six. In modern times in many places females between the ages of 10 to 60 are not allowed and is generally performed by girls who have not reached puberty. Typically the karnavar of the family or an elderly person will be the one who oversees the function and grands his blessing to the function. The pulluvan and his team create a floral decoration using various natural colors on specially made floor before the snake idols. The floral decoration is called Nagakalam. Nagakalams are of various types such as Bhasma Kalam (A Kalam which is made of just ash powder) and Varna Podi Kalam (A Kalam which is made up of colour powder). The kanyas wear Pavada and blouse. Once the pulluvan and his team is done with decorations and other preparations the kanyas are called to the venue. They normally sit in the kalam or besides the kalam. In certain places where there are more than two kanyas, they stand besides the kalam. Nagarajavu generally stands inside the kalam. Kanyas are given pokulas or arecanut flowers. The pulluvan starts singing and playing the veena and the pulluvathy sings along and plays the kudam. The initial lines are generally sung in praise of Ganesha, followed by other gods. Then the Tala or beat changes along with the song. Later part is dedicated to Serpent gods and the kanyas sitting in the kalam. The kanyas generally starts to get into a trance like state within 20‚Äì30 minutes and it is reported that they feels that the snake which is drawn on the floor has come alive. Some of them have experienced vibrations all over their body and they feel their body is resonating towards the vibrations. The girls are generally not given any training to dance and in many cases it might be the first time they are watching the ritual. They move towards the vibration . They swing their hair and rub the powder of the kalam(the divine solace created). So the induced trance state is highly revered as girls are generally supposed be too young to perform any sophisticated acting to make the onlookers believe in the ritual. The ritual has strong parllels to the function of an Oracle and generally speaks to the onlookers after entering into the trance state and informs them on the behalf of the snake gods. It can be sees that the kanyas does not speak the normal day-to-day language while in the trance state adding on to the mystery.

It has been estimated that the militia led by Thomas Lubanga Dyilo was 30 percent children. In 2011 it was estimated that 30,000 children were still operating with armed groups. The United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUSCO), released a report in 2013 which stated that between 1 January 2012 and 31 August 2013 up to 1,000 children had been recruited by armed groups, and described the recruitment of child soldiers as \\"endemic\\". The former president Laurent Kabila had used children in the conflict from 1996 onwards and it was estimated that up to 10,000 children, some aged only seven years old, served under him. The International Criminal Court (ICC), in the first trials held on human rights violations in the DRC, led to the first indictments, the first trials and the first convictions, in national jurisprudence for the use of children in combat.  Background  It is estimated in the academic literature that up to 300,000 children form a part of both irregular, and regular armed forces worldwide, and that this number is increasing. In Africa it is estimated that up to 120,000 children, which is 40 percent of the worldwide total, are currently used as combatants or support personnel. Africa has the highest growth rate in the use of children in conflict, and on average, the age of those enlisted is also receding. In 2003 it was estimated that up to 30,000 children were used as soldiers in the DRC, with children making up up to forty percent of some militias. In 1989 The United Nations passed the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Article 38 states that \\"State parties shall take all feasible measures to ensure that persons who have not attained the age of 15 years do not take a direct part in hostilities.\\" The optional protocol on the involvement of children in armed conflict came into force in 2002 which stipulates that state actors \\"shall take all feasible measures to ensure that persons below the age of 18 do not take a direct part in hostilities and that they are not compulsorily recruited into their armed forces.\\" The DRC is a signatory of both of these agreements. The official stance taken by UNICEF is that the use of children in armed conflicts is that it is morally reprehensible and illegal.  State reaction  On 19 March 2006, Major Jean-Pierre Biyoyo was sentenced to five years in prison for recruiting and training child soldiers, it was the first time that a court in the DRC had tried, and convicted a soldier for child recruitment.  International reaction  A group of demobilized child soldiers in the DRC According to David M. Rosen, criticism has been levelled at the US over its support to nations which do recruit children into their armed forces. To comply with the Child Soldiers Protection Act (CSPA) in 2009 the State Department listed six nations which were subject to being sanctioned by the act. Burma, Chad, the DRC, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen. On 25 October 2009, Barack Obama waived the restrictions on four of the six nations. As justification for this Obama stated that the nations involved were important in that they cooperated with interests essential to US foreign policy. The reason given for the DRC exemption was \\"a need to continue defense reform services and to influence the negative behaviour patterns of the military into a non-political professional force respectful of human rights.\\" Obama also said that all four of these nations were making advances in the elimination of the use of children. However in the DRC child recruitment may actually be on the increase. A report by MONUSCO confirmed that all parties to the conflict were recruiting girls as child soldiers, and that these children were frequently raped, or used as sex slaves or bush wives by groups such as the Union of Congolese Patriots (UPC) and Patriotic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (FPLC). In fact, according to a paper published by The International Peace Support Training Centre in Nairobi, Kenya, girls constitute a very large portion of child soldiers in the Democratic Republic of the Congo; roughly 40%. A study by Milfrid Tonheim in 2011, which surveyed many former female child soldiers in eastern Congo, also found that many of these girls return home to high levels of stigmatization, often related to the sexual abuse inflicted upon them.  Proceedings of the ICC  Thomas Lubanga Dyilo, who was leader of the UPC, a group which operated in the Ituri region in the Northeast of the DRC, was indicted by the ICC in 2006 on three counts of war crimes, recruitment, conscription, and the use of children under 15 in combat. According to Michael Bochenek, who is the director of Amnesty International's International Law and Policy Program, the \\"verdict will give pause to those around the world who commit the horrific crime of using and abusing children both on and off the battlefield\\" Luis Moreno Ocampo has said that the Lubanga was \\"only the start of cases linked to the years of militia violence in Ituri which has killed thousands and produced more than 600,000 refugees.\\" Germain Katanga former leader of the Front for Patriotic Resistance of Ituri (FRPI), and Mathieu Ngudjolo Chui were indicted on seven counts of war crimes, and three counts of crimes against humanity in 2008, which included the use of children under 15 years of age being used in combat, by the pre trial chamber of the ICC. Katanga was convicted of having taken part in the Bogoro massacre on 24 February 2003. He was cleared of sexual offenses and the use of child soldiers.

Biography Boulaz was born in Avenches, Switzerland. She attended a trade school and worked as a journalist for the International Labour Organization in Geneva. Boulaz began climbing in the Alps in the 1930s and continued making major ascents until the 1970s. Of her major climbs, four were the first ascents and at least nine were the first female or all-female ascents. At the start of her career, Boulaz and Lulu Durand became the first women to climb the Dent du Requin (1932) and the southwest face of the Dent du G√©ant. She made a number of climbs with Durand in 1935: the first female traverse of the Aiguille des Grands Charmoz; the first female traverse of Les Droites; the first female ascent of the north face of the Petit Dru (with Raymond Lambert), and the second ascent ever; the first female ascent of the Central Spur of the Grandes Jorasses; the Aiguille Noire de Peuterey; and the Brenva Face of Mont Blanc. She was the first person to climb the east face of the Bel Oiseau (1938), the north face of Mont V√©lan (1941), and the Rothorn of Valais (1941). She was the first woman to climb the Pear Buttress on Mont Blanc's Brenva Face (1939), the Walker Spur of the Grandes Jorasses (1952), and the north face of the Cima Grande di Lavaredo (1960). Outside of the Alps, Boulaz traveled often within the Himalaya, the Caucasus and the Sahara. In 1959, she was a member of the all-female expedition to Cho Oyu where Claude Kogan, Claudine van der Straten-Ponthoz and three Sherpas died during an avalanche. In 1977, she was the first to climb a new route in the A√Ør Mountains of the Sahara, which she named Tour Loulou. She was made an honorary member of the Swiss Alpine Club, even though the club did not allow women to become members at the time, as well as holding honorary membership of the Ladies' Alpine Club and the Alpine Club. Boulaz was also a successful alpine skier; she was a member of the Swiss national ski team in 1936 and 1937, and in 1937 she placed fourth in the FIS World Ski Championships slalom category in Chamonix.

Administered by the Cotroceni Monastery, the inn was, for much of its history, the most important in Bucharest. Like other inns in Bucharest, it was affected by the advent of modern hotels: it was closed around the mid-19th century and it was demolished in 1882 to make way for the current headquarters of the National Bank of Romania. Description While this was not the first inn of Bucharest (such as the older Saint George's Inn), it was on a larger scale than anything Bucharest ever had.Potra, p.35 The inn served as both warehouses and living quarters for merchants and it may have been inspired by the fondachi of Venice (such as Fondaco dei Tedeschi and the Fondaco dei Turchi).Potra, p.35 However »òerban had never been to Venice and his brother, stolnic Constantin Cantacuzino, who studied in Padova, was not in friendly terms with »òerban.Potra, p.36 Nevertheless, such inns were not unique to Venice and »òerban Cantacuzino may have seen them in Constantinople.Potra, p.36 It was surrounded by thick walls just like some of the monasteries of Bucharest. Archeological digs around the area showed that the walls had a thickness of one meter, being made out of well-burnt narrow bricks.Potra, p.47 History =Planning= »òerban Cantacuzino had planned to build an inn since he was a postelnic in the diwan of Grigore Ghica, writing this in a chrysobull (hrisov) of one of his donations to Cotroceni Monastery.Potra, p.34 Between 1666 and 1680, Cantacuzino buys a number of 39 properties (empty lots and shops) in the Greeks' Quarter (Mahalaua Grecilor).Potra, p.34 The lot had an area of 7510 m¬≤, having a 105-meter front on Lipscani street and a 70-meter front on Uli»õa Mare (today Sm√¢rdan).Potra, p.35 This area of Bucharest was well-chosen for an inn, as the nearby the T√¢rgul de Sus (Upper Market) began to develop during this period, being also close to the shops of some richest merchants of the time, such as Pano Pepano or Ghionea Musta»õƒÉ.Potra, p.35 On January 8, 1683, »òerban Cantacuzino donated the lot and shops to the Cotroceni Monastery (which he began building 4 years earlier).Potra, p.35 =Construction= It is assumed that the inn was built by the same craftsmen as the Monastery of Cotroceni, the building of which finished in 1683, so its construction began during the summer of 1683.Potra, p.35 Within three years, in 1685, the inn was ready to allow merchants and tenants to settle in.Potra, p.36 The guest rooms, shops, cellars and warehouses were ready, but certain annex buildings (such as the stables, the hay storage buildings and the kitchens) were not ready even by 1688 when »òerban Cantacuzino died.Potra, p.36 It seems that the reason why it was left unfinished was financial: Cantacuzino spent much on the Cotroceni Monastery and also on the Siege of Vienna (1683), in which he participated on the Ottoman side.Potra, p.36 =Decay and demolition= After 1850, the inn was abandoned and it began to deteriorate. The inn, with its fortress walls became anachronic and was left outside the development of the commercial city centre. In 1882, it was demolished and in its place the National Bank of Romania built its new headquarters.Potra, p.47 Notes References * George Potra, Istoricul Hanurilor Bucure»ôtene, Editura »òtiin»õificƒÉ »ôi enciclopedicƒÉ, 1985 External links Category:Inns in Bucharest Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Bucharest Category:Hotel buildings completed in the 17th century Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1685 Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1882 ","title":"»òerban VodƒÉ Inn"},{"id":"42408149","text":"Codex Chimalpopoca or C√≥dice Chimalpopoca is a postconquest cartographic Aztec codexGibson, Charles and John B.

It is best known for its stories of the hero-god Quetzalcoatl.Bierhorst, John. In Dav√≠d Carrasco (ed). \\"Chimalpopoca, Codex.\\" In The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerican Cultures. : Oxford University Press, 2001. The current whereabouts of the codex are unknown. It appears to sadly have been lost in the mid-twentieth century. Study of the codex is therefore necessarily provided only through copies and photographs. The codex consists of three parts, two of which are more important, one that regards the pre-Hispanic history of Central Mexico, the Anales de Cuauhtitlan and the other that regards the study of Aztec cosmology, the Leyenda de los Soles.  Physical characteristics  According to Walter Lehmann, who studied the Codex in 1909 and 1926 when it was housed at the Museo Nacional de M√©xico, the manuscript was about 22 cm high and 15 cm long. The paper was thin and yellowed with worn edges.  Name  The title page Codice Chimalpopoca is accompanied by the date 1849 and a note explaining that the name was given it by Charles √âtienne Brasseur de Bourbourg, in honor of a Mexican scholar of the early nineteenth century, Faustino Galicia Chimalpopoca.  History  The original of the manuscript is unknown and the original is probably a copy of an even older work. The three parts of the copied manuscript in Mexico's National Institute are all in one hand. The script is provided with cover pages bearing the genealogy of Mexican historian Fernando de Alva Cort√©s Ixtlilxochitl. Although Ixtlilxochitl himself does not make mention anywhere in his works of this manuscript, it is tempting to speculate that he is the copyist. In the mid-eighteenth century, the well known collector Lorenzo Boturini Benaduci describes a manuscript that closely resembles the Codex Chimalpopoca, and specifies that it was copied by Ixtlilxochitl. What is known is that at the end of the eighteenth century, Mexican scholar Antonio de Le√≥n y Gama made a copy of the manuscript, which is preserved at the Biblioth√®que nationale de France. Following the disappearance of the original manuscript, probably in 1949, the best source for its study is the photograph of the original that was taken by Primo Feliciano Vel√°zquez in 1945.  Contents  Codex Chimalpopoca is composed of three parts unrelated to each other. The first part, called Anales de Cuauhtitlan (Annals of Cuautitl√°n), is a work in the Nahuatl, which takes its name from the city of Cuautitl√°n. The content is primarily historical. It nevertheless contains a brief version of the Leyenda de los Soles (Legend of the Suns). This part occupies pages 1‚Äì68 of the codex. The second part, with the title Breve relaci√≥n de los dioses y ritos de la gentilidad, consists of a short book written in Spanish (pages 69‚Äì74 of the manuscript) by a certain Indian cleric of the sixteenth and seventeenth century, Pedro Ponce de Le√≥n, which deals with Aztec deities and rites. The third part, called Leyenda de los Soles is another work in Nahuatl that develops versions of the most frequently cited sun legends (pages 75‚Äì84). The Codex's name was given it by Francisco del Paso y Troncoso in 1903. The second section, the Breve relaci√≥n, is not included in the 1945 copy.  References Bibliography  *Bierhorst, John.

He climbed extensively in the Himalaya and Karakorum and summited five of the fourteen eight-thousanders. After ascending Makalu in 2009, he fell ill due to dissipated pulmonary and cerebral oedema and subsequently died in Kathmandu on 4 June, aged 36. Early life Mick Parker was born in Box Hill, a suburb of Melbourne, to Gail and Bruce Parker. He attended Donburn Primary School and Wesley College, where he took up cross country running and rock climbing, before leaving school to study graphic arts at Box Hill Senior Secondary College. Climbing career Parker's passion for climbing began in 1996 when he took an ice climbing course in New Zealand. In 2003 he climbed Cho Oyu's northwest face from Tibet after an unsuccessful attempt on Kangchenjunga. He summited Broad Peak for the first time in Pakistan in 2004 (he made a second unsuccessful attempt in 2006). In 2005, he made attempts to climb Mount Everest and K2, but failed in both. On K2, he chose to give up his chance of reaching the summit in order to bring an endangered Irish climber to safety and escort him back to base camp; on Everest, he was forced to retreat because of poor weather. In 2007, Parker joined the Australian Army Alpine Association‚Äîfor whom he led numerous expeditions‚Äîon their attempt to climb Gasherbrum I in Pakistan. After leaving the rest of the team who decided to turn around, he continued climbing alone and reached the summit on 29 July, becoming the second Australian to have climbed the mountain.

Despite his unenviable reputation for corruption, he had a highly successful career until the outbreak of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, when he went into opposition to King Charles I. He fought in the wars on the side of the Irish Parliament, and was killed at the Battle of Knocknanuss. He was a nephew of the poet Edmund Spenser, and was himself the founder of a notable military dynasty. Background Robert was born in County Cork about 1596, the eldest son of John Travers of Ballinamona, who was Registrar of the Consistory Court of Cork and of the Diocese of Ross, and his wife Sarah Spenser, sister of Edmund Spenser. His grandfather is generally recorded as Brian Travers who came to Ireland from Lancashire in the middle of the sixteenth century. However, there is little evidence for this and a number of writers dispute the link to the Lancashire familyH. J. S., Notes and Queries article 7 November 1863, S. Smith Travers, 1864 \\"Collection of Pedigrees of the Family of Travers; or Abstracts of Certain Documents Collected Towards a History of that Family\\", Edmund Spenser 1884 \\"The Complete Works in Verse and Prose\\" could find no support for a link with Brian Travers, Higginson, 1912 \\"Spenser‚Äôs Shepherd‚Äôs Calender in Relation to Contemporary Affairs\\" concludes that the \\"relation of the Irish John Travers, who married a Sarah Spenser, to the Travers family of Lancashire is therefore entirely hypothetical\\". Sarah Spenser came to Ireland in about 1588 to keep house for her brother Edmund, who after the downfall of the Earl of Desmond was granted a part of the Desmond inheritance, including the castle of Kilcolman. Edmund granted a portion of his lands to John and Sarah as a wedding gift. Both were buried at Cork in Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral, where Robert erected a memorial to them, but the building has been so much altered since then that no trace of the memorial survives. A St. Fin Barre‚Äôs chapter recordAnnals of St Fin Barre's Cathedral, Cork by Richard Caulfield, 1871 page 18. dated 2 September 1623 shows that George Lee, Dean, and the Chapter, granted to Robert Travers, of Mooretown, in Ibawn, Esq., a place of burial in the south side of the chancel of our Church, next the south wall at the window now the most eastern of the same side, in which place John Travers, father of the said Robert, as well as Sara Spenser, als. Travers, mother of Robert, with his paternal grandmother, as also his two brothers are buried. In which place the said Robert, with our consent, heretofore had erected a marble tomb; until the next walls of the ruin being destroyed through age, in order that they may be repaired anew, the said monument was removed for a time for the sake of safety. The record notes that Sara Spenser is said to have been sister of the poet. Travers' uncle, the poet Edmund Spenser Early career Robert was educated at the University of Oxford, and took there a degree in civil law. Since most, though not all of the commanders in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms had seen military service, it is possible that he was a soldier for a time. Unusually for the eldest son of a landowning family, he decided on a full-time legal career (this was a more common choice for a younger son at the time). He practiced mainly in the ecclesiastical and Admiralty courts. He won praise for his legal ability, but also gained a reputation for corruption which stayed with him throughout his life. He became Vicar General of the Diocese of Meath, but so many accusations of extortion, of the taking of bribes and of misappropriation of funds were made against him that in 1621 he was prosecuted in the Court of Castle Chamber (the Irish parallel to Star Chamber), and was found guilty of bribery. He was fined ¬£300 and ordered to be imprisoned at the Crown's pleasure.Crawford, Jon G. A Star Chamber Court in Ireland- the Court of Castle Chamber 1571-1641 Four Courts Press 2005 pp.558‚Äì9 Castle Chamber was never very effective in enforcing its orders, and the sentence of imprisonment never took effect. Even so it is surprising that Travers' conviction did not result in his professional disgrace: on the contrary he continued in legal practice and was knighted in 1625. Most likely he owed his immunity to his powerful friends, especially Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork, whose cousin Elizabeth Boyle he later married.Burke's Peerage 107th Edition Delaware 2003 Vol.1 p.795 Richard Boyle, 1st Earl of Cork, Travers patron. Judge In the early 1620s he was appointed Deputy to Sir Lawrence Parsons, the Irish Admiralty Judge, and was also made judge of the provincial Admiralty Court in Munster.Costello, Kevin The Court of Admiralty of Ireland 1575‚Äì1893 Four Courts Press Dublin 2013 p.7 Here again he became notorious for taking bribes and for keeping prize goods for himself. By 1625 Sir Edward Villiers, who was briefly Lord President of Munster, was writing in despair that the Crown could not trust the conduct of the Admiralty to \\"such a one\\" as Travers, and referred pointedly to his Castle Chamber conviction for corruption.Costello p.7 Villiers urged that Henry Gosnold, Travers' predecessor, who had a reputation for integrity, be restored to office. Gosnold did return to the Admiralty Court in the 1630s, but during the Civil War found himself unable to exercise power effectively. The Parliament of Ireland set up a rival court at Kinsale with Travers as its judge; not surprisingly, further accusations of corruption were made against him.Costello p.17 Politics He entered the Irish House of Commons in 1634 as member for Clonakilty.Ironically, Henry Gosnold, with whom Travers so often clashed, had represented the same borough. Since the town of Clonakilty was Lord Cork's own creation (he obtained its charter in 1612), there is no doubt that Travers was the Earl's nominee. This Parliament had been called by the formidable Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, who for several years was virtually all-powerful in Ireland.Wedgwood, C.V Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford 1593-1641- a revaluation Phoenix Press reissue 2000 p.149 Lord Cork's initial friendly overtures to Strafford were firmly rebuffed: Strafford was determined to establish King Charles I's absolute authority in Ireland, and to achieve this he believed that it was necessary to curb Cork's power and influence. Lord Cork in return worked patiently for Strafford's destruction, and in May 1641 was able to write grimly in his diary: \\"the Earl of Strafford was beheaded on Tower Hill, as he well deserved\\".Wedgwood p.175 Travers was returned to the House of Commons in 1639, again for Clonakilty, and was clearly identified as an opponent of Strafford. He signed the Remonstrance of November 1640 in which the Irish Parliament, having previously lavished praise on Strafford, now accused him of tyranny and corruption without parallel in Irish history. Travers was active in the Commons in 1641, especially in pressing home the attack on Strafford. Like most Irish and indeed English MPs, he seems to have believed that once Stafford was brought down the King would be able to reach a compromise with the English and Irish Parliaments.Wedgwood p.320 Civil War and death The outbreak of the Irish Rebellion of 1641 showed that any hope of a peaceful settlement was an illusion. Travers, like all Protestant landowners in Ireland, now feared for his lands and his life.Wedgwood p.392 The Irish Parliament was deeply suspicious of the King's attitude to the Irish Confederacy. The rebels claimed to have the King's warrant for their actions, and although this was untrue, it was true that Charles never entirely ruled out the possibility of employing the Confederate Army. Parliament's suspicions were confirmed by the Cessation of 1643, whereby James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde, the Irish Royalist commander, signed a ceasefire with the Confederates, which was repeatedly renewed. Ultimately, Parliament was driven to fight the King as well as the Confederates.Wedgwood, C.V.

Before 1638, he married secondly Elizabeth, daughter of Richard Boyle, Archbishop of Tuam, a first cousin of the Earl of Cork, and his wife Martha Wight. By this second marriage, he had four children: * John (died 1712), his father's heir, who married Mary Scudamore. * Richard (died 1700), who married Eleanor Stawell and inherited the lands of his uncle Zachary Travers of Garrycloyne Castle, near Blarney.

Her daughter Eleanor Meade was the fourth wife of Godwin Swift, the uncle of Jonathan Swift and cousin of John Dryden, while another daughter, Joanna, was the grandmother of Jonathan Swift's prot√©g√©e Laetitia Pilkington. * Martha, who married first Captain Robert Stannard of Kilmallock (died 1655) and secondly in 1656 Sir Richard Aldworth of Newmarket, having children from both marriages.

Xenocracy is a cross between a space combat action sim and a political strategy game. Story The year is 10 600 of the Common Era. Mankind has colonised space, founding a Solar dominion on the power and wealth created by the mineral lycosite. Four great planetary superpowers - Earth, Mars, Venus and Mercury - wage a covert war for the outer colonies and their rich reserves of lycosite. Only the peacekeepers of the United Planet Nations can prevent these skirmishes and raids from erupting into all-out Solar War. You are the WingToucher commanding the elite U.P.N.https://archive.org/search.php?query=creator%3A%22Simis%20Limited%22 Gameplay In the far future, four planetary superpowers (the Earth Dominion, the Mercury League, the Venus Alliance and the Mars Combine) are vying for control of the solar system and on the brink of all-out \\"thermostellar war\\". As commander of the United Planet Nations peacekeeping fighter squadron, your role is to maintain the balance and prevent cold war and localized conflicts from escalating into open interplanetary hostilities. Further complicating the matter, you must deal with pirates and a looming alien threat. As each planetary superpower launches low-intensity strikes (as opposed to open warfare) against the colonies and outposts of the other three, you are presented with the choice, via a strategic solar system map showing flaring geopolitical hotspots, of which to aid. If you aid one superpower too much at the expense of the others, as one is first tempted to do, you upset the balance and cause the war you sought to prevent. Whichever you choose, afterward you are realistically presented with complaints and political propaganda from the other three superpowers, and receive news broadcasts concerning the interplanetary geopolitical wrangling. In addition to keeping the peace, you also manage research and development of newer and more powerful technologies, which will eventually prove crucial. Several fighter and weapon types are available, and the scenery varies from asteroid belts and dust clouds to planetary surfaces. You may choose from several wingmen, each with a personal description and personality type, whom you must do your best to keep alive. Missions include such tasks as defending mine complexes from attack (or attacking them) and protecting convoys (or destroying them).

KFC restaurants in China are owned or franchised by Yum China, a restaurant company that also owns the Pizza Hut and Taco Bell chains in China and was spun off from Yum! Brands in 2016. KFC has 5,919 outlets in China as of 2018.http://services.corporate- ir.net/SEC/Document.Service?id=P3VybD1hSFIwY0RvdkwyRndhUzUwWlc1cmQybDZZWEprTG1OdmJTOWtiM2R1Ykc5aFpDNXdhSEEvWVdOMGFXOXVQVkJFUmlacGNHRm5aVDB4TWpjME1EUXdOaVp6ZFdKemFXUTlOVGM9JnR5cGU9MiZmbj1ZdW1DaGluYUhvbGRpbmdzSW5jLnBkZg According to research by Millward Brown, KFC was the most powerful foreign brand in China in 2013. KFC drive through restaurant in Qingdao History KFC became the first Western fast food company in China after its first outlet opened in Qianmen, Beijing, in November 1987. The operation was a joint venture, with a 60 percent stake held by KFC, 27 percent by the Beijing Tourist Bureau and 13 percent by Beijing Food Production. In early 1988, Bank of China took a 25 percent stake in the venture, and KFC's original stake was diluted to 51 percent. Warren Liu, a former vice-president of Tricon Global Restaurants (KFC's former parent company) argued that, \\"being the first ... has continued to provide KFC with a substantial competitive advantage.\\" By 1988 the Beijing outlet had the highest volume sales of any KFC in the world. Instead of importing American managers, KFC hired management from rising Asian economies such as Taiwan. Existing Chinese distribution infrastructure was poor or non-existent, so KFC created its own, which ensured high quality standards. The chain had an early advantage against its Western fast food rivals, as fried chicken has been a staple Chinese dish since antiquity, whereas hamburgers were foreign and relatively unknown. By 1994, there were 28 KFC outlets in China, including seven in Beijing. By 1997, there were 100 outlets. In 2008, CEO David Novak announced plans to open more than 20,000 restaurants in China, saying: \\"We're in the first innings of a nine-innings ball game in China.\\" At the start of 2008, the chain added its first Chinese street food snack to its menu, the youtiao. The street snack menu was expanded in 2010 with the addition of the shaobing. In August 2010, KFC China announced its biggest product launch to date: the Rice Bowl, which heralded the arrival of rice as an accompaniment across the chain. =2012-14 supply issues= In December 2012, the chain faced allegations that some of its suppliers injected antiviral drugs and growth hormones into poultry in ways that violated food safety regulations. This resulted in the chain severing its relationship with 100 suppliers, and agreeing to \\"actively co-operate\\" with a government investigation into its use of antibiotics. KFC China sales in January 2013 were down 41 percent against the previous year. In May 2013, Businessweek speculated that KFC may be \\"losing its touch\\" in China. Recovery has been slower than Yum! expected, with same store sales continuing to decline as late as October 2013, although the rate of decline is slowing. Leslie Patton of Businessweek also highlighted increased competition in the fast food category from competitors. To counter sluggish sales, the menu was revamped in 2014. In April 2014, Yum! announced that first quarter KFC sales had risen by 11 percent in China, following a 15 percent fall in 2013. In July 2014, Chinese authorities closed down the Shanghai operations of the OSI Group, amidst allegations that it had supplied KFC with expired meat. Yum! immediately terminated its contract with the supplier, and stated that the revelation had led to a \\"significant [and] negative\\" decline in sales. Operations Sam Su is chairman and CEO of Yum!'s Chinese operations. The Zinger burger is the highest selling menu item. KFC has adapted its menu to suit local tastes, with items such as rice congee, egg custard tarts and tree fungus salad, with an average of 50 different menu items per store. Another item is the Dragon Twister, a wrap that includes fried chicken, cucumbers, scallions, and duck sauce, similar in preparation to Peking duck. Chinese outlets are typically two to three times larger than American and European outlets; many are open 24 hours a day and provide home delivery; and two new menu items are released each month. 78 percent of Chinese sites are company-owned, compared to 11 percent internationally.

Route description = Peninsula Boulevard (CR 2) = 214x214pxPeninsula Boulevard begins in Cedarhurst at Rockaway Turnpike (CR 257), near a connecting road to New York Route 878 (Nassau Expressway), and runs through the Five Towns area, where it spends much of its journey running northeast and southwest as a four-lane undivided thoroughfare. In Hewlett, it becomes a divided highway at Franklin Street and then runs beneath a bridge for the Far Rockaway Branch of the Long Island Rail Road between Mill Road and Gibson Boulevard. After Gibson Boulevard, the divider becomes wider as it winds towards Rockaway Avenue, only to return to its former stature. Within Lynbrook, New York, the road takes a sharp northern trajectory after the intersection with New York State Route 27 (Sunrise Highway) and almost immediately runs beneath Lynbrook (LIRR station). The road returns to the northeast at South Niemann Avenue and then intersects Merrick Road. After Ocean Avenue, it runs as a divided roadway along the southeastern edge of Hempstead Lake State Park. This divided portion was the original route of the Southern State Parkway before the parkway's current route across Hempstead Lake. Between Lakeview Avenue and the Southern State Parkway, it contains residential frontage roads on the east side, and pedestrian bridges over the road, the first being Lakeside Drive, and the second being North Village Avenue. The segment along North Village Avenue was a former segment of the Southern State Parkway. The second of these frontage roads ends at Mercy Hospital on the southeast corner of the interchange with the current Southern State Parkway at Exit 19 in South Hempstead. Beyond the Southern State, the road maintains its status as a divided highway even as it enters Downtown Hempstead, where it briefly turns east as it intersects Franklin, Greenwich, and Henry Streets. It is at the latter where the road turns back to the northeast to serve as the southern terminus of Clinton Street, which leads to Glen Cove Road, then intersects New York State Route 102 (Front Street), and finally terminates at New York State Route 24 (Fulton Street). = Bay Boulevard (CR 2A) = Bay Boulevard is a short extension of Peninsula Boulevard in Cedarhurst. It runs from an intersection at Rockaway Turnpike (CR 257) to an industrial area just west of Nassau Expressway (NY 878). = Route shields = Peninsula Boulevard, along with all of the other county routes in Nassau County, became unsigned in the 1970s, when Nassau County officials opted to remove the signs as opposed to allocating the funds for replacing them with new ones that met the latest federal design standards and requirements, as per the federal government's Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices.

Early life Ware was born in Baker County, Georgia to Zeddie Ware and Willie Mae (Kegler) Jenkins, who were both born in Georgia. His father died when Charlie was young. In 1920, he was living with his widowed mother and three siblings, John, Zeddie and Mary Lou, at their maternal grandparents' farm in rural Milford. He, his mother and grandmother were recorded as being \\"mulatto.\\"1920 United States Federal Census In 1930, he may have been the 16-year-old Charlie Ware imprisoned at the \\"Industrial Farm for Colored Males\\" in Adamsville, where boys as young as 10 were incarcerated.1930 United States Federal Census In 1940, he was living in Micanopy, Florida and working at the Franklin Lumber & Basket Co.

Woodruff. During the festivities, Ware allegedly flirted with the African-American mistress of the white overseer of the plantation. The overseer complained about this to his friend L. Warren Johnson, the white sheriff of Baker County. Sheriff Johnson that night went to the Ware home, where he beat his wife, Louise Ware, and forced Ware out of bed. Warren arrested him and handcuffed him, and forced Ware to recite the 23rd Psalm before driving him to the county jail. He then made a claim over the radio of an attempted knife attack ‚Äî \\"[He's] coming on me with a knife. I'm going to shoot him!\\" ‚Äî before shooting the handcuffed Ware four times. Ware was shot three times in the neck but survived. Ware was later indicted by a Baker County grand jury on charges of felonious assault. His lawyer, C. B. King, then filed a $100,000 civil suit in federal court, alleging that Johnson's story was preposterous and that he had shot Ware with no provocation. In the spring of 1963, the all-white jury deliberated for less than 90 minutes before exonerating the sheriff. Later, the black community successfully organized a boycott of a grocery store owned by one of the jurors, forcing him out of business. When Ware's criminal case was brought to trial in July 1963, additional charges of drunkenness on the part of Ware at both the barbecue and on a public highway were included. Ware was found guilty by the jury, but they recommended a lenient sentence. By the time of this trial, Donald L. Hallowell had also become one of Ware's lawyers. He used the trial to challenge the exclusion of African-Americans from serving on Baker County juries. Death Ware later moved to Albany, Georgia, where he died at Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital at aged 84 following multiple strokes. He was survived by his wife, Louise, two daughters and 13 sons.

It lies along one of the paths of the ancient Silk Road and has long been a trade crossroads for China, Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan. This has led to skirmishes and battles over the centuries. Mayoon has approximately 120 dwellings (1,000 residents) along the alpine Hunza-Nagar River. Mayoon is 218 km southwest of China by the Karakoram Highway, 150 km north of India, and less than 100 km southeast of Afghanistan. The economy is sustained by agriculture and tourism. This region of the Hunza Valley is known for its high quality water, scenic views of the nearby mountain peaks, and its advanced agriculture. Major crops include corn, wheat, mulberries, peas and assorted vegetables. The mountainous region also produces fruits including grapes, apricots, plums, and cherries. Language The dominant local language is Shina, an Indo-Aryan language. The Shina spoken at Mayoon is a regional dialect which diverges somewhat from the Shina spoken in nearby Gilgit and Nager. Brushuski, Wakhi language, and Domki are also spoken within the region. Urdu, Pakistan's national language, functions as the lingua franca while English is spoken among the educated and those involved in the tourism industry. History Most of Mayoon's 1,000 residents are descendants of Shinaki Hunza migrants from the town of Nasirabad. The Shinaki group settled the area in the early 19th century. The region falls along one of the many Silk Road trade routes and has been contested by Chinese, Indian, Afghan, Soviet, and English armies over the centuries. Nasirabad and Mayoon are old settlements which used to be the first bastions of defence in the lower Hunza valley, protecting the main upper Hunza region. People from Nasirabad and Mayoon fought wars and battles against Sikhs, British and other forces in the late 19th century. ‚ÄòSikh Mara Jung‚Äô is a deep, narrow valley where the people of Mayoon defeated an army of 500 Sikhs in a single night. Colonel Durand was wounded by a gunshot, reportedly fired from Mayoon Fort. The modern stereotyping of Shinakis as straightforward and aggressive people stems from the centuries of fighting. Besides warfare, the region of the Hunza Shinaki was also famous for its simplicity. The King of Hunza had a special respect for lower Hunza. In the modern era, people of these areas are typically well educated, simple and financially strong. Amir Hussain, emerging young intellectual, columnist and one of the leading social development experts of Gilgit-Baltistan , belongs to the Village of Mayoon. He is a graduate of London School of Economics and has been one of the well known figures in the contemporary intellectual history of Hunza. Culture The culture of the Shinaki tribe of Mayoon derives from local social customs and religious practice. The main celebrations are Nowruz, Ginani and Saalgirah. On such occasions, traditional delicacies are made. Mayoon is a Pakistani pre-wedding custom, during which the bride often goes into a 7- to 15-day seclusion before the wedding. The seclusion is from the groom until the wedding. In other cases, a party of her close friends is held, during which she dresses in yellow. It is not known if this custom takes its name from the community of Mayoon, or if the name is separately derived. Both private and government educational institutions operate in the region. Most of the people of the Mayoon region are Isma'ili Muslims, followers of the Aga Khan. Transport Popularly known as the Silk Road, the Karakoram Highway (KKH) runs about 100 km from Gilgit to Hunza. Most people travel by road; it takes between two and three hours to reach Hunza from Gilgit. The journey from Islamabad to Hunza can take as long as 24 hours. The main bus stand is on the KKH in Aliabad. Along the KKH, there are booking agents in towns for long-distance buses and jeeps. From Kashgar (China), a regular international bus service to Hunza via Sust crosses the Khunjerab Pass (about 5000 meters high). Across the river in Hunza, at Sust, there is a village called Khuda Abad. People usually do not stop at Khunjerab Pass on their way to Sust by bus. In Sust, one may trek in the valleys or continue to Hunza-Karimabad (two hours), to the Baltit Fort. The Khunjerab Pass is open from 1 May to 30 December and closed in winter. The international bus waits until enough people have gathered, which can take days (as of 2012). An alternative option is to take a first bus to Tashkurgan, stay one night, go to immigration for departure approval and then take a second bus to Sust and another to Hunza. =Airport= Mayoon is served by Gilgit Airport (IATA: GIL), a small domestic terminal approximately 40 km to the south. It offers 45-minute flights to Islamabad, substantially reducing the transit from 15 hours by car or 24 hours by bus. The service is provided by Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), which offers regular flights on 42-seat planes between Gilgit and Islamabad. Connections, however, are often subject to weather cancellations, particularly in winter when flights may be delayed several days. =Transport links= * To China: The bus service (NATCO & PTDC) is scheduled to begin crossing the border from Sust, Gilgit-Baltistan to Tashkurgan, China every day at nine o'clock in the summer. In autumn, the bus runs only when full. If passengers are lacking, buses may be delayed for several days before embarking to Tashkurgan. * To Islamabad via the Karakoram Highway: several buses leave each day from Ali Abad (20 km east), Hunza, and Gilgit. * To Gilgit via the Karakoram Highway: mini-buses leave for Gilgit every 30 minutes from Ali Abad (20 km east). Demographics The approximately 1,000 inhabitants of Mayoon occupy about 120 dwellings. The people are broadly considered Hunza. The fair-skinned and light-eyed Hunzakuts are somewhat anomalous to the region and claim to be descendants of soldiers lost from Alexander's army when Alexander invaded India in 326 BC, although genetic studies have not confirmed this speculation. ‚ÄîPolitical Views:'''''' Muhammad Faqir son of Arab khan is the first selective union council Chairman of mayoon hunza. Historically Mayoon has been one of the important political centers of Hunza with the king of Hunza making special allowances for the bravery of the people of Mayoon and to buy their political loyalty. The young generation of Mayoon is influenced by the political and intellectual traditions shaped by the political thoughts introduced through the leading intellectual Amir Hussain and his followers in Hunza and beyond. Geography Mayoon is in a mountainous region and has an elevation of 1892 meters. The swift-flowing Hunza Nagar River provides ample water for irrigation of crops, but it also serves as a barrier that prevents direct access from the community of Mayoon to the paved Karakoram Highway. Access is by a shallow river crossing about 10 kilometres away. The community occupies a wedge of fertile land 1 kilometre east-west and 0.5 kilometre north-south. Its geographic coordinates are 36¬∞14'25\\"N, 74¬∞25'28\\"E. Nearby major peaks include the Rakaposhi (7788 m), the recently climbed Ultar Peak (7388 m) and Bublimoting Peak (6000 m).

History The D.G. Yuengling and Son brewing company was founded in Pottsville in 1829 by David Yuengling, a German immigrant. The original water source for the company was a hillside spring several blocks west of the brewery. The land around the springhouse was made into a park in the late 1800s. When water demand outstripped the spring's capacity in the 1960s, however, the company began using city water instead and shut down the park and springhouse. Contemporary development In 2002, Richard \\"Dick\\" Yuengling Jr. donated the land and spring to the city of Pottsville. The park had become abandoned and overgrown and the city took on its redevelopment. Yuengling Jr. had been approached by the Lasting Legacy for Pottsville Foundation and the Bicentennial Committee to start discussions about the donation. Yuengling Jr. stated it was fitting the city should have the land \\"because it was the source of Pottsville's first water supply\\", and \\"Why shouldn't the city have it? It will certainly enhance the quality of life for those living near it.\\" When the renovations were completed in the Spring of 2004, the park featured footpaths, wooden bridges, gazebos, waterfalls and gardens. The park was the first urban green space created in Pottsville in \\"recent history\\". The price of creating the park was approximately $350,000, and local company Prodesign Plus helped work on design and construction. All money spent on upgrading the park was funded by private donations. The ground breaking of the park was held on June 10, 2004, and the ribbon cutting ceremony to officially open the park was on September 10, 2005. In 2012, Lasting Legacy spent an estimated $20,000 installing a bathroom in the park. Deborah \\"Debbie\\" Yuengling Ferhat, Richard L. Yuengling Jr.'s daughter, sits on the board at Lasting Legacy.

Life Mathew Anden was born in Berlin in 1942; his name was Mathias Schreiner. He was son of Katharine Schreiner but was adopted by his aunt, Yoshi Schreiner. His mother was in a Russian concentration camp and thought to be deceased, thus the adoption. However, she came back in 1950, but the adoption was never changed. Mathew and Yoshi came to the United States in June of 1957. When he became an American citizen he changed his name to Mathew Anden. When he was a teenager, Anden began to act in plays. He played in theaters across the United States, in Minneapolis, Maine, New Orleans, Boston, and Detroit, and worked from 1971 to 1972 at a theater of Baltimore, often playing leading roles. His most significant role was in the 1965 Off-Broadway production of The Threepenny Opera, in which he played the role of Finch. Throughout his career, he acted alongside such theater stars as Gail Strickland, Joyce Van Patten and Diana Scarwid. He also acted in plays by Harvey Perr, Max Frisch and Se√°n O'Casey. His career as a stage actor encompassed continuously the 1950s, 60s and 70s in the United States. He was a member of the actors studio. He was not very fond of film acting, and acted in just four movies or feature films throughout his career, though he worked with famous actors such as Paul Newman, Burt Reynolds, Ryan O'Neal and, in German films, Nicole Heesters and Hans-Peter Korff. Anden had guest roles on The Waltons, as well as on various German crime shows. In one of his few nonfictional television appearances, he was interviewed for the show Making it in Hollywood.

Early life and education  Wali Ahmad was born at Sandakai, a small village in Chakisar, Swat. Born into a religious family, he was given religious education locally. He proceeded to Madrasah-i-Deoband for higher studies. He then visited Makkah for the performance of Hajj and travelled to Syria, Baghdad and other centers of Muslim civilization.  Anti British movement  Wali Ahmad returned from abroad and opened a religious school (Madrasah) at Tahkal (Peshawar). In those days Haji Sahib of Turangzai was working against the British. Wali Ahmad was very much inspired by Haji Sahib. He went to Swat, in 1910, and organized the people in Swat and Kohistan against the British.  Reformation of society  Wali Ahmad (Sandakai Mullah) was against the aberrations in Islamic customs and rituals prevalent in Swat. So he continued to struggle for the formation of an Islamic government in Swat. He built a force of fifty to sixty shaykhs (disciples) equipped with latest weapons and were ready for every kind of action ordered by their pir (religious leader). He established his own mobile Shari'at Court where he tried to compensate and remove the grievances of people. He declared many prevalent practices such as Qada 'Umri, Iskhat and visiting shrines of saints to be innovations in Islam.  His role in the formation of Swat State  At that time, there was no government and central controlling authority in Swat. Wali Ahmad wanted a united government of Swat to eliminate the influence of the Nawab of neighboring Dir. The Khans of Swat supported him. The people of upper Swat, under the command of Sandakai Mullah, defeated the Nawab in 1914, which made the former a political leader. Sandakai Mullah was desirous f having a centralized organization Swat. Thus,Syed Abdul Jabbar Shah of Sithanah was made ruler of Swat in 1915. But he could not managed to protect Swat from the attacks of Nawab of Dir. Sandakai Mullah, who had first brought and made Abdul Jabbar Shah as king in Swat, drove him out and enthroned Miangul Abdul Wadud as the ruler of Swat, thus playing the role of king maker and king breaker.  The fate of Sandakai Mulla  With the passage of time, his relations with Miangul Abdul Wadud also became strained. He, again focused his attention on the eradication of innovations and un-Islamic rituals. He re-established his mobile Shari'at Court and executed his orders. The Badshah Sahib considered his presence and influence as serious threat to his power. So he wanted to reduce and diminish his role and influence. Miangul Abdul Wadud sent him his men and threatened him to leave Swat or he will be killed. The Badsha had now become so strong that nobody could challenge him. So, ultimately Sandakai Mullah left Swat in 1920 and settled in Kohan, Dir, where he died a natural death in 1356 A.H.

Sequential execution is displayed on the top, while its equivalent fork‚Äìjoin execution is on the bottom. In parallel computing, the fork‚Äìjoin model is a way of setting up and executing parallel programs, such that execution branches off in parallel at designated points in the program, to \\"join\\" (merge) at a subsequent point and resume sequential execution. Parallel sections may fork recursively until a certain task granularity is reached. Fork‚Äìjoin can be considered a parallel design pattern. It was formulated as early as 1963. By nesting fork‚Äìjoin computations recursively, one obtains a parallel version of the divide and conquer paradigm, expressed by the following generic pseudocode: solve(problem): if problem is small enough: solve problem directly (sequential algorithm) else: for part in subdivide(problem) fork subtask to solve(part) join all subtasks spawned in previous loop return combined results  Examples  The simple parallel merge sort of CLRS is a fork‚Äìjoin algorithm. mergesort(A, lo, hi): if lo < hi: // at least one element of input mid = ‚åälo + (hi - lo) / 2‚åã fork mergesort(A, lo, mid) // process (potentially) in parallel with main task mergesort(A, mid, hi) // main task handles second recursion join merge(A, lo, mid, hi) The first recursive call is \\"forked off\\", meaning that its execution may run in parallel (in a separate thread) with the following part of the function, up to the that causes all threads to synchronize. While the may look like a barrier, it is different because the threads will continue to work after a barrier, while after a only one thread continues. The second recursive call is not a fork in the pseudocode above; this is intentional, as forking tasks may come at an expense. If both recursive calls were set up as subtasks, the main task would not have any additional work to perform before being blocked at the . Implementations Implementations of the fork‚Äìjoin model will typically fork tasks, fibers or lightweight threads, not operating-system-level \\"heavyweight\\" threads or processes, and use a thread pool to execute these tasks: the fork primitive allows the programmer to specify potential parallelism, which the implementation then maps onto actual parallel execution. The reason for this design is that creating new threads tends to result in too much overhead. The lightweight threads used in fork‚Äìjoin programming will typically have their own scheduler (typically a work stealing one) that maps them onto the underlying thread pool. This scheduler can be much simpler than a fully featured, preemptive operating system scheduler: general-purpose thread schedulers must deal with blocking for locks, but in the fork‚Äìjoin paradigm, threads only block at the join point. Fork‚Äìjoin is the main model of parallel execution in the OpenMP framework, although OpenMP implementations may or may not support nesting of parallel sections. It is also supported by the Java concurrency framework, the Task Parallel Library for .NET, and Intel's Threading Building Blocks (TBB). The Cilk programming language has language- level support for fork and join, in the form of the \`spawn\` and \`sync\` keywords, or \`cilk_spawn\` and \`cilk_sync\` in Cilk Plus.

It was released through the jazz label Concord Records on June 26, 2012, one year after Abrams competed on the Fox reality television series. The record deal was struck with the help of American Idol judge Randy Jackson, who serves as an executive producer on this album. Abrams spent six weeks recording the songs at Kensaltown Studios in London. He described this as an unusual experience, in which he often sang while sitting on a couch and recorded in an open room. Ambient noises from the city can be heard in the background of some tracks. Abrams served as a co- writer on nine of the album's eleven tracks and, for the most part, felt that his creative vision was communicated. The album carries an upbeat tone. It predominately focuses on themes of nature and romantic yearning. Humorous subject matter is dealt with as well, such as in the songs \\"Wore Out My Soul\\", which is a double entendre about shoes, and \\"Stuck in London\\", which contains nonsense lyrics. Although Abrams had been known for jazz on American Idol, he went in a pop direction for this album, combining the two genres. \\"Dry Spell\\" has been considered the most jazz-influenced original song. However, a cover of the Ray Charles standard \\"Hit the Road Jack\\" is included as well and features a duet with fellow American Idol season 10 contestant Haley Reinhart. A deluxe version of the album, which includes covers of \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" and \\"Have You Ever Seen the Rain?\\", received a limited release. Touring for the album was not extensive. However, Abrams opened a jazz festival on Penang Island, and after being dropped by Concord Records, he toured across Ethiopia. \\"Simple Life\\" and \\"Get Out\\" were released as dual singles a few weeks ahead of the album. Music videos were created for the two songs, as well as for non- singles \\"Stuck in London\\" and \\"Great Bright Morning\\". Jack Black, who had previously performed with Abrams on the American Idol season finale, appeared in a promotional comedy video that depicted Abrams as a homeless street busker. Some critics were disappointed that Abrams did not make a more traditional jazz album. However, critical reception was positive overall. Some reviews compared Abrams to Jason Mraz, while others singled out the two jazziest songs, \\"Dry Spell and \\"Hit the Road Jack\\", as highlights. \\"Midnight Girl\\" also received high praise. It was listed as one 2012's best songs by an American Idol alumni. The album charted at No. 101 on the Billboard 200. It peaked at the No. 1 spot on Billboard's Top Heatseekers chart, while the single \\"Get Out\\" peaked at No. 23 on the Adult Contemporary chart and No. 39 on the Adult Pop Songs chart. Background Unlike several of the other finalists from the tenth season of American Idol, Abrams did not gain a record deal in the immediate aftermath of the series. This caused Kate Ward to write an article for Entertainment Weekly, in which she called Abrams the \\"most musically talented contestant\\" from that season and suggested a petition to get him signed. In January 2012, it was reported that Abrams had signed with Concord Records, the jazz label that Esperanza Spalding - one of Abrams' musical inspirations - is a part of. When asked earlier what kind of album he would like to make, Abrams answered \\"between rock and jazz and everything in between.\\" Although he finished in sixth place, Abrams has said that he is glad he did not win American Idol. The tight schedule for releasing an album that is imposed on the winner would have placed more pressure on him than he would have liked. Instead, Abrams was able to spend as much time as he felt necessary to find \\"the right label and the right music\\". \\"I need a chill vibe\\", he said explaining his feelings on the matter. The album was released on June 26, 2012, about a year after Abrams' participation on American Idol, and about ten months later than season ten winner Scotty McCreery's debut album. As soon as the American Idol Summer tour finished, Abrams went to Los Angeles, where he began writing sessions. Writing and recording All of the songs were co-written by Abrams, except for \\"A Boy Can Dream\\" and \\"Hit the Road Jack\\". Although he had written songs on his own before, this marked the first time that Abrams had ever co-written with someone. Only new song ideas were used for the album. Abrams valued the \\"collaborative process\\" of working with other writers and feels that this is crucial to making music \\"fun\\". The album mixes elements of jazz and pop - Abrams has said that he \\"learned how pop music works\\" from his co-writers. Describing the album's genre as \\"organic focal\\", he placed heavy emphasis on melodies and harmonies - the \\"focal point\\" - while relying primarily on organic instruments, such as acoustic guitar, upright piano, and double bass. Commenting in particular on the double bass (or upright bass), which he gained notice for using during his run on American Idol, Abrams said that he feels the instrument \\"adds depth, changing frequencies you wouldn't hear on an electric bass.\\" One of the takeaways that Abrams hoped fans would get from this album is his ability to play more instruments than just those that he used on TV. In addition to the double bass, Abrams played the cello, the drums, the acoustic guitar, the melodica, the recorder, the shaker, and a wurlitzer on the album. He gave serious consideration to being the only instrumentalist, but concluded that the album would be stronger with \\"input from different artists\\". American Idol season ten third-place finalist Haley Reinhart (left) dueted with Abrams (right) on the Ray Charles standard \\"Hit the Road Jack\\". American Idol judge and fellow upright bass player Randy Jackson served as an executive producer on the album. He suggested the possibility of collaborating, shortly after Abrams' run on the series. Although Abrams had little direct involvement with Jackson on the album, Jackson made several important connections for Abrams. Jackson is the one who connected Abrams with Concord Records. Before recording the album, Abrams had mentioned an interest in working with Ellen DeGeneres, who judged American Idol the year before he competed. Iain Pirie and Martin Terefe also served as executive producers on the album. Commenting on Terefe, who produced many of Jason Mraz's albums, Abrams said, \\"I think he‚Äôs probably the nicest, but weirdest guy I've ever met...If something‚Äôs not working, he‚Äôll let you down very easily and if something‚Äôs good, he‚Äôll be your biggest cheerleader\\". The tone of the album is intended to be happy and upbeat. Abrams wanted to \\"put out good vibes\\" with the music, explaining that he hoped to help people \\"feel good about the world\\". The album progresses into somewhat more negative subject matter as it goes on though. \\"We all thought it would be funny if we started the album off really happy and then got to the negative content\\", Abrams said. Opening track \\"Simple Life\\" was a collaboration with Toby Gad. A bass line that Gad played on the piano reminded Abrams of relaxing in his hammock and \\"looking up at the sky.\\" The song developed from a discussion that the two had about \\"how nice\\" it is to take a break from technology every now and then and just go outside to enjoy nature. One time when Abrams wanted to do this, he was at a friend's house, in an area that he was unfamiliar with. Despite his desire to \\"go play guitar behind the house and be in nature\\", he was wary of the location. Reminding himself that he was now an adult, he \\"tuned [his] guitar down to a dropped D\\" and told himself, \\"I'm not scared of ghosts no more.\\" From this emerged the song \\"Ghosts\\", which he took to Rune Westberg for further development. An additional element was then added, to make the song about staying the same in a relationship even when other aspects of your life are changing. \\"Great Bright Morning\\", which Abrams described as \\"a friendship song\\", was written with Andy Stochansky and Jamie Hartman. The song continues the theme of exploring nature and is about Abrams' dog, Rocky. \\"He's got a stub instead of a tail\\", explained Abrams. \\"I think [that] is probably the coolest part...[it] is so funny because whenever someone comes home, if I come home or my mom or dad walks in, he gets really excited and starts shaking his little stub.\\" Abrams has had Rocky since the fifth grade and adopted him out of a bundle. He pictured the two of them \\"walking through the hills of Idyllwild\\" for the song - his hometown, where he has called the hills \\"magical\\", and of which he said, \\"You can watch a sunset [there], and the only other person to enjoy it with you is your dog.\\" Another location that had influence on the album was London. Abrams recorded all of the songs in that city, at Kensaltown Studios. He found this to be a unique experience, as the room was \\"totally open\\" and had windows. The mixer was not in a separate room - he could hear all of the music. Most of Abrams' vocals were recorded while sitting on a couch. Since Abrams played live, sounds of the city, such as buses, clock towers, and birds, made it onto the recordings and can be heard on the finished album. \\" I think recording anywhere else other than LA has different kinds of vibes\\", Abrams said about the experience. He felt that recording in London \\"captured the wonder\\" and the \\"wanderlust\\" that he felt about the city. An initial two week stay extended into six, and during this time, Abrams wrote two songs - one of these is \\"Stuck in London\\". While walking around the city, Abrams began forming a melody for the song. After playing his ideas for Terefe, he was advised to \\"reverse the chords of the chorus\\". Joined by co-writer Sacha Skarbek, the trio then took the song in a \\"party jazzy\\" direction. \\"I loved it. He just went along with my madness and made it into the Caribbean dance party fun track\\", Abrams said. Wanting to use evocative imagery in the song, Abrams came up with \\"fun\\" lyrics that held little bearing on his actual life. Ian Barter came to Abrams with a fully formed melody for a song, which Abrams then improvised lyrics over. While joking around, Barter suggested making the whole thing into a veiled love song about shoes, to which Abrams responded, \\"That's hilarious, let's do it.\\" The song is called \\"Wore Out My Soul\\". Abrams has called Barter a \\"genius\\" and was happy to write about an unconventional topic. \\"I feel like there's no subject that can't be sung about...every rock should be turned\\", he said. \\"Blame It On Me\\", which was co-written with Aron Friedman and Pamela Sheyne, allowed Abrams to \\"[play] a character\\". Abrams called this song the least like him on the record, remarking that he would \\"never really say\\" the lyrics another person. The song focuses on a woman who is trying to come up with an excuse for leaving in the middle of a date, even as the man knows that she is just intimidated by his sexiness. Abrams has joked that the album is \\"mostly about wanting girls to like\\" him. \\"Get Out\\" is Abrams' \\"heartbreak song\\", that he described as having \\"a very simple 'I hate you, but I love you' kind of vibe\\". Written on the guitar and then recorded with \\"pop instruments\\", it was a collaboration with Westberg and Jason Reeves. \\"Midnight Girl\\" is a very personal song for Abrams. Drawing inspiration for it from a real life relationship that none of his friends were able to understand, Abrams wanted to make the point that when two people are in a loving relationship, they should not be discouraged by how others view them. The song was co-written with Stochansky and Hartman. \\"A Boy Can Dream\\" was written by busbee, Tommy Lee James, and Zac Maloy, without any initial input from Abrams. The song reminded Abrams of a time when he had met a girl at a wedding on New Year's Eve and had felt something special between the two of them. He described the relationship as having been \\"kind of cinematic\\". When Abrams saw the song, he said that it was \\"eerie\\" how close the lyrics matched his own experience. He changed a few of the lyrics though, to make them fit him even better. The song tells of a short-lived relationship that lingers in a boy's memory, as he wonders what might have happened had it not ended. Longing gives way to desperation on the album's penultimate track, \\"Dry Spell\\". Abrams said that it is \\"probably the jazziest [song] on the album\\" and that it tells the story of a man who is a \\"mess\\" and needs to \\"let loose\\". He particularly enjoyed writing this one (with Friedman and Sheyne), and described \\"laying down the base track\\" for it as \\"awesome\\". Jamie Cullum plays the piano on this track and was characterized by Abrams as \\"a crazy cool piano player that just has the bebop in his soul.\\" Soon after the album's release, Abrams commented that he already had ideas for \\"several\\" new albums \\"brewing\\". At least one of these he hoped would be more in line with traditional jazz and would include jazz covers. One Ray Charles standard did make it onto this album - \\"Hit the Road Jack\\", which Abrams performed as a duet with fellow American Idol season ten finalist Haley Reinhart. Abrams and Reinhart had previously recorded a cover of \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside\\" together. The two are close friends, and when asked, Abrams said that he \\"wouldn't be opposed\\" to recording an entire album with her. The track's producer Steve Jordan suggested that they do a \\"funky\\" version of \\"Hit the Road Jack\\", after Abrams mentioned his desire to cover a Ray Charles song. They sought to give the song an \\"urban twist\\" - something which Abrams described as \\"a big risk\\". Initially, Abrams was going to record the song without Reinhart. However, he and Jordan decided to try recording the song as a duet, so as to better evoke the Ray Charles original. Abrams remarked that he \\"pulled [Reinhart] into the recording session to see what would happen, and it was magic.\\" Abrams has said that he got to do \\"a lot of things\\" he \\"wanted to do\\" on the album, and he has expressed enthusiasm over the songs, saying \\"I'll sing every single one 'til the day I die.\\" However, he has also hinted that conflict may have occurred during the process of making the album - some parties were concerned that none of the songs would be viable as a single. \\"I did have to fight for a couple things\\", Abrams said. Reflecting on the situation a few years later, Abrams felt that certain individuals placed their financial goals for the album above artistic merit. Overall though, Abrams had a good experience with the label and found that people were open to his vision. Abrams' favorite songs on the album are \\"Stuck in London\\" and \\"Midnight Girl\\". He likes \\"Stuck in London\\", because it has \\"kind of an odd meter\\" and \\"different time signatures\\", and he has described \\"Midnight Girl\\" as a \\"very sweet\\" song that can be played \\"with just an acoustic guitar or with a full band.\\" As a whole, he considers the album to be a \\"trial record\\", unfocused in its genre, but still \\"pretty good\\". He toyed with the idea of recording a second album under an alias, on which he would have done \\"straight jazz versions\\" of all the songs on this album. Singles \\"Simple Life\\" and \\"Get Out\\" were both released as singles on June 5, 2012. They were sold together on iTunes. \\"Simple Life\\" was also offered on its own as a free download from Tumblr. \\"Get Out\\" spent thirteen weeks on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart, peaking at No. 23, and four weeks on the Adult Pop Songs chart, peaking at No. 39. A music video for \\"Simple Life\\" was released in September 2012. It features Abrams enjoying the outdoors with hippies and was called \\"adorably Abrams-esque\\" by Lyndsey Parker of Yahoo! Music. A music video for \\"Get Out\\" was then released in February 2013, featuring multiple versions of Abrams, each playing one of the tracks instruments in a subway busking band. It was called a \\"hoot\\" by Michele Amabile Angermiller of The Hollywood Reporter and was named the second best 2013 music video for an American Idol alumni by Mark Franklin of The York Dispatch. Promotion To promote the release of the music video for \\"Get Out\\", Abrams released a short comedy video to YouTube, which featured cameos from Jack Black (who performed with Abrams on the American Idol season 10 finale), fellow American Idol season 10 alumni Haley Reinhart (who performs \\"Hit the Road Jack\\" with Abrams on this album) and Paul McDonald, as well as season 6 runner-up Blake Lewis. Leading up to the release of the video, Abrams managed to pique public curiosity in his affairs by asking several of his friends from American Idol to launch a Twitter hashtag called #wherescasey. Those who participated (which included season 10 winner Scotty McCreery) pretended to be worried about Abrams, and the story was even reported upon by TMZ. The video depicts Abrams as a homeless busker and was envisioned as tie-in with the \\"Get Out\\" music video (which depicts Abrams in a similar condition). Although the scenario is purely fictional, Abrams really did walk down Hollywood Boulevard in his bare feet, while carrying a \\"giant stuffed gorilla\\" (which is also featured in the video) as a publicity stunt. A TMZ tour bus noticed him while he was doing this, and when it decided to stop, Abrams performed a song and danced. Although \\"Stuck in London\\" and \\"Great Bright Morning\\" were never made into singles, music videos for the songs were released in October 2013 and February 2015 respectively. They both feature Abrams and a group of friends singing by a campfire in Abrams' own backyard. The video for \\"Stuck in London\\" features Jackie Tohn (who competed on the eighth season of American Idol), while the video for \\"Great Bright Morning\\" features Lewis, Elliot Yamin (who competed on the fifth season of American Idol), Dani Knight (who competed on The X Factor) and actress Alyson Stoner. Both videos feature Reinhart as well. In March 2013, Abrams returned to the American Idol stage to perform a cover of \\"I Saw Her Standing There\\" by The Beatles. Although he has never recorded this song, the promotional appearance led to sales of his album rising about 2,000% over the previous week. Abrams said that appearing on the show again was nerve- racking and that he was \\"star-struck\\" by that season's new judges, Nicki Minaj, Mariah Carey, and Keith Urban. A deluxe version of the album was released in Wal-Mart stores. It contains two bonus tracks - covers of \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" and \\"Have You Ever Seen the Rain\\". During the same week as the album's release, an extra original song, called \\"Chip on Your Shoulder\\", was made available as an online music video. The song is about Abrams' struggles with inflammatory bowel disease and was available exclusively at IBDIcons.com, the website for a national campaign dedicated to raising awareness of the disease. For every one of Abrams' fans who registered at the website to view the music video, a donation of one dollar was made to Crohn's & Colitis Foundation of America. Abrams performing at a concert in 2013 Touring Upon the album's release, Abrams described his touring plans as being simple and low-key. \\"I might go around the country in my car. Bring a bass, a guitar, an accordion and see what happens. I'm not too sure\\", he said. On December 5, 2013, he opened the 10th Penang Island Jazz Festival. Jason Cheah of Malaysian newspaper The Star, wrote that ahead of the concert, some people questioned whether Abrams had strong enough jazz credentials to be a proper fit. However Cheah was greatly impressed by Abrams and praised the artist's depth of musical knowledge. He called the concert \\"arguably one of the best small hall gigs\\" in that area of the entire year. The Hollywood Reporter wrote in February 2014 that Abrams had recently toured Ethiopia upon the invitation of a friend from the charity organization Ethiopia Skate. Abrams had just been dropped by Concord Records around this time and traveled to the country extemporaneously. \\"I basically went there, having nothing but a will to play some music\\", he said. Abrams played at several jazz festivals in the country, as well as at \\"random night clubs\\". He has said that he met and occasionally played with some of the preeminent Ethiopian jazz artists during this trip. Reception =Critical reception= The album was well received by critics. Sherry Lipp of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer called it more contemporary than one would have expected from Abrams and felt that this kept it from being a traditional jazz album. However, she considered the pop elements to be \\"well- crafted\\". \\"Dry Spell\\" was singled out in her review as the most jazz- influenced original song on the album. Lipp wrote that this track did an excellent job of showcasing Abrams' skills on the double bass. She appreciated its \\"jazzy piano solo\\" and \\"complex drum rhythms\\" as well. Jim Farber of the New York Daily News agreed with Lipp that \\"Dry Spell\\" is one of the album's highlights. He noted that Jamie Cullum, who plays piano on the track, is a good match with Abrams, declaring that the two are \\"equally impish\\". In Farber's opinion the \\"jazzier songs [like \\"Dry Spell\\"] have more individuality than the pop ones\\". Lipp found Abrams' cover of \\"Hit the Road Jack\\" to be \\"more relaxed\\" and \\"slowed-down\\" than the original \\"with a more prominent bass line.\\" She praised Reinhart's performance, writing that the guest artist proves her \\"jazz-blues chops\\". Mark Franklin of The York Dispatch called the duet \\"great\\". The tone of the album was found to be light and casual. \\"There's not a lot of soul searching\\" wrote Lipp. Farber found the performances to be lacking in \\"depth\\" and \\"sex\\", although he determined that Abrams \\"makes up for [this] in charm.\\" He thought that Abrams, with his \\"high, boyish pitch\\", comes across as an innocent. \\"While many songs mean to communicate romantic pining, Abrams' delivery has such ease and sweetness, it erases any sadness. He sings entirely in winks and blushes, playing the bashful best friend who never gets the girl but always gets the joke\\", Farber wrote. In a three out of four star review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted that Abrams carries a bright disposition throughout the album by mostly avoiding sad subject matter. \\"It's all love songs and paeans to the wonders of a simple life, whether it's embracing a \\"Great Bright Morning\\" or eating mangos in a mango tree\\", wrote Erlewine. Franklin was enamored with the album's approach, writing that it \\"goes down as easy as a sunny, 85-degree summer day.\\" Commenting on whether Abrams lived up to his American Idol hype, Franklin wrote, \\"Mission accomplished in a mellow, just-having-fun sorta way.\\" Opinions differed though, on how well Abrams managed his transition from television performer to recording artist. Lipp lamented that his \\"ferociousness and quirkiness\\" do not come off as strongly on the album as she would have liked, but recognized that \\"what works on the Idol stage does not always translate into real world record sales.\\" Erlewine remarked that the very qualities that had made Abrams stand out on the series prove to be \\"grating, but only mildly so\\" over the course of an entire album. He pointed to \\"all the good cheer, the jazzy runs and scats, [and] the way [Abrams] leans just a little too hard into his phrases whenever he wants to seem soulful\\" as examples. However, Farber thought that Abrams succeeded in carrying over his appeal. He wrote, \\"[Abrams]' vocals sound less fettered and more fluid than ever ‚Äî enough to make even his busiest scats seem not skittish but pretty. It's a style as supple in tone as it is agile in cadence.\\" Both Farber and Erlewine compared the musical style to that of Jason Mraz, although Erlewine ultimately felt that the album comes across as \\"a wannabe throwback to the '70s.\\" Farber heard similarities to Bobby McFerrin, writing that \\"Simple Life\\" could be \\"the long lost son\\" of McFerrin's song \\"Don't Worry, Be Happy\\". Lipp praised Abrams' abilities as a musician and a songwriter. In addition to her jazzy favorites, \\"Dry Spell\\" and \\"Hit the Road Jack\\", she pointed to \\"Blame It On Me\\" and \\"Great Bright Morning\\" as the album's best tracks. Worrying that some might overlook \\"Great Bright Morning\\" because of its subtlety, she praised it as \\"heartfelt\\" and noted that its \\"warm acoustic work make[s] it worth going back to.\\" \\"Blame It On Me\\" was called the \\"funkiest thing here\\" by Erlewine, and Lipp wrote that the song's \\"steady-rocking, propulsive pop\\" is a good fit for Abrams' style of singing. While opining that none of the songs are genuinely bad, she nonetheless pointed to \\"Midnight Girl\\", \\"A Boy Can Dream\\", and \\"Get Out\\" as the three weakest, calling the former two unmemorable and likening the latter to a Justin Bieber pop song. Franklin praised \\"Get Out\\" as a highlight however, and named \\"Midnight Girl\\" as the album's best non-single, writing that it \\"grew on [him] with repeated listens.\\" He also named \\"Midnight Girl\\" as the tenth best 2012 song by an American Idol alumni, while naming the album as a whole the fourth best for 2012 by an alumnus of the show. =Sales and chart performance= The album sold around 4,000 copies in its first week, debuting at No. 101 on the Billboard 200. It spent eight weeks on Billboard's Top Heatseekers chart and peaked in the No. 1 spot. Following Abrams' March 2013 American Idol promotional performance, the album had sold 27,000 copies in total.

He played college basketball for the University of Florida before playing professionally in the NBA Development League, Australia, Germany and Greece. In 2016, he won an NBL championship with the Perth Wildcats. He helped the Wildcats defend their title in 2017, while earning All-NBL First Team honors. With a move to Melbourne United came another championship for Prather, as he collected a personal three-peat in 2018. Early life Prather was born and raised in Jackson, Tennessee, under the stern watch of his mother Enova and sister Brittany, with his parents having split before he was born. Growing up, family and basketball kept him away from the growing criminal element in his community. At the age of 12, his stepfather, Jeffery, noticed Prather's athleticism and began teaching him the skills required to pursue playing professionally. High school career Prather attended Jackson's North Side High School, where he averaged 28 points per game as a sophomore, and 24.4 points and 14 rebounds as a junior. During his junior season, he had a 53-point, 24-rebound performance in a district game against Fayette Ware High School. Following his junior year, he was ranked the 25th best prospect by Scout.com, and the 10th best small forward. On November 17, 2009, he signed a National Letter of Intent to play college basketball for the University of Florida.

He totaled six 20-point games, including his career-best 28 points in Florida's season opener against North Florida. This increase in production was a key factor for Florida becoming one of the top teams of the 2013‚Äì14 season. For the fourth straight year, the Gators reached the Regional Finals, where they defeated Dayton to move on to the Final Four. In the National semi-finals, the Gators were defeated by Connecticut to fall short of reaching the Championship Game, despite a 15-point effort from Prather.

She was Professor of Social and Local History at the University of Roehampton from 1994 to 2001. Early life Spufford was born Honor Margaret Clark in Cheshire on 10 December 1935. Her parents, Mary (n√©e Johnson) and Leslie Marshall Clark, were scientists. During her childhood, she was educated at home by her mother. During World War II, she lived in the Welsh borders to be safer from the threat of bombing. In 1953, with the death of her father, the family moved to Cambridge. There, she attended the sixth form of Cambridge High School for Girls, a grammar school. In 1956,Newnham College Roll Letter 2014, pp230 she matriculated into Newnham College, a women-only constituent college of the University of Cambridge. Due to ill health she left university without completing her degree. For all her adult life she suffered from early onset osteoporosis. Although her first fracture was at the age of 17, the disease was not diagnosed until she was 31. She later returned to university and studied in the Department for English Local History at the University of Leicester. She graduated in 1963 with a Master of Arts (MA) degree, having achieved a distinction. She remained to complete post-graduate research and completed her Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) degree in 1970. Her thesis was titled People, Land & Literacy in Cambridgeshire in the 16th & 17th Centuries. Academic career Spufford began her academic career as a research fellow at Lucy Cavendish College, Cambridge, in 1969. After three years at the University of Cambridge, she joined Keele University as an honorary lecturer and senior research fellow where she stayed for the rest of the 1970s. In 1980, she returned to Newnham College, Cambridge as a fellow and college lecturer in history. She was initially also a senior research associate at the History faculty. In 1985, she gave up her official Fellowship and was appointed a bye-fellow because her blood pressure became labile, which meant she could no longer commit herself to continue teaching undergraduates on a regular basis. She continued teaching a large group of doctoral students, who called themselves 'The Spuffordians' and came to her from as far away as Canada, California, Australia and Japan because of her reputation, based on her publications. After a year at the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study in Wassenaar, she was appointed Research Professor in Social and Local History at the University of Roehampton in 1994. She retired in 2001. She spent two terms in Japan, the second as guest of the Japan Academy, overseeing a cooperative research project on local history in Japan. The resulting publication of a series of volumes, is currently (March 2015) in progress. Publications Spufford started publishing in 1960 and had already published two smaller books and ten articles before her most influential book 'Contrasting Communities' was published in 1974. It has been kept continuously in print ever since.Cambridge University Press, ISBN Hardback 0-521-20323-6, ISBN Paperback 0-521-29748-6 It changed the way that historians looked at local communities in early modern England. Her next important book 'Small Books and Pleasant Histories: Popular Fiction and its Readership in Seventeenth Century England' was published in 1981 and it too has been kept continuously in print ever sinceHardback, Methuen, , Paperback, Cambridge University Press, 1985, It made people aware of the extent of literacy in rural England and what there was for her rural readers to read. As a consequence it brought to the attention of historians of English literature, the immense quantity of ephemeral literature that underpinned the literary cannon. She later extended her work on education and literacy from rural England to other parts of Europe. Her next landmark book 'The Great Reclothing of Rural England' came out in 1984.Hambledon Press, Hardback It brought the attention of historians to the chapmen who toured rural England before the proliferation of shops, carrying with them the essential linens for clothing and a range of haberdashery and other small objects, including her small books. This has produced similar studies in other parts of Europe. Her next book 'The World of Rural Dissenters, 1520-1725' was published in 1995.Cambridge University Press, Hardback , Paperback, 2011, It was an attempt with a number of her research students to look at the continuity and social range of dissent in rural England from the Lollards to the early 18th century. She herself contributed an influential introductory chapter, a small book in itself, summarising her particular views on the importance of religion in the 16th and 17th centuries. Her 'Poverty Portrayed' also appeared in 1995.Centre for Local History, Keele University. Also as Volume 7 Staffordshire Studies, It tied together documents about rural poverty with paintings by the two Egbert Van Heemskerks, father and son, portraying rural society in Holland and England.

United States, 325 U.S. 91 (1945), also known as the Screws precedent, was a 1945 Supreme Court case that made it difficult for the federal government to bring prosecutions when local government officials killed African-Americans in an extra-judicial manner. Claude Screws, the sheriff of Baker County, Georgia, arrested Robert \\"Bobby\\" Hall, an African American, on January 29, 1943. Hall had allegedly stolen a tire, and was alleged to have tried to fight back against Screws and two of his deputies during the arrest. Hall was arrested at his home. Screws then beat Hall to death. The local U.S. attorney then convened a grand jury which indicted Screws on charges of violating Hall's civil rights. Screws was then convicted at the federal court house in Albany, Georgia. The conviction was upheld by the Circuit Court and then appealed to the Supreme Court. While the case was moving through the courts Screws was reelected as sheriff by a very wide margin. The Supreme Court, in a decision authored by William O. Douglas, ruled that the federal government had not shown that Screws had the intention of violating Hall's civil rights when he killed him. This ruling greatly reduced the frequency with which federal civil rights cases were brought over the next few years.
