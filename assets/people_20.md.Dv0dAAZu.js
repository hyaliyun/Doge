The brand name, Geox, was created from a mixture between the Greek word ‚Äúgeo‚Äù (earth), and ‚Äúx‚Äù, a letter-element symbolizing technology. Polegato was born in 1952 near Treviso. Originally groomed to take over the family wine-making business, company promotional material has it that the idea for the shoe came when he participated in a wine industry conference in Reno; while out jogging in Reno's hot desert climate, his feet got hot from the exertion and he had the idea to cut a couple of holes in the soles of his shoes with a Swiss Army knife. He developed the idea into a viable product with the help of a small leather-goods business his family owned. After unsuccessfully pitching his invention to several established footwear manufacturers, but after having passed the market testing phase for a line of children‚Äôs footwear, Polegato began large-scale production of shoes under the Geox brand name. That same year, he improved the original patent and extended the product range to men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs footwear. Research and development The Geox group has consistently invested in innovation, ever since it was founded. Its Montebelluna head offices are host to R&D; facilities, which are unique in their kind. Here, 15 engineers, chemists and physicists are employed in research on perspiration and human-generated heat-movement patterns, testing all materials used in their footwear and manufacturing clothing. The Montebelluna-based team of scientists have created and patented new machinery to help them pursue their research.

Kramer has tickets for the opera Pagliacci, and everyone is going, including Elaine and Joe. Elaine drops in on Joe's apartment where she discovers that he has a wall of pictures of her that he secretly took with his telephoto lens. Terrified, she attempts to leave the apartment. When Joe tries to stop her, insinuating that she is cheating on him, she maces him with cherry Binaca and flees. Jerry, Kramer, Elaine, and George go to the opera, where Elaine tells the others that Joe is not coming, and Susan has to pick up a friend at the airport and can't come either, so they have two extra tickets. George and Kramer attempt to scalp the tickets, working separately after Kramer refuses to sell for anything less than an absurdly high price. As Jerry and Elaine wait for them to return, they are asked by a street performer impersonating Canio for tips. Jerry had flipped a coin earlier, and it was taken by another spectator, so he does not have any money for the clown, which annoys him. Joe, in full Pagliaccio costume, walks through a park on his way to the opera house. He is antagonized by a group of hoodlums, but uses martial arts to knock them all out. He approaches Kramer and intimidates him with his manner, particularly as Kramer is scared of clowns.

George finally agrees to sell the ticket to someone, when Susan runs up and says she can join him because her friend's plane was diverted to Philadelphia. George gives her ticket to her, and gives the man his own; since he will not attend the show, he must then invent an explanation that will please Susan. Kramer shows up with the tickets, and he, Elaine and Jerry take their seats. They are joined by Susan and Harry Fong, the man to whom George sold his ticket. They ask where George is; Susan tells them that he was \\"uncomfortable.\\" Jerry and Elaine ask Kramer to whom he gave the last ticket.

It was the tenth episode of the fourth season. It aired on November 11, 1992. The cast assembled to read this episode's script on October 14, 1992, and it was filmed six days later, on October 20. Plot After a month and a half of procrastinating on a television pilot idea, Jerry is nervous about the series' fate, while George remains indifferent. Jerry introduces Marla, his new girlfriend, who is a virgin. George asks out a woman named Stacy (Leah Lail). He knows he cannot keep this relationship up, though, as he's dating Susan. George then finds himself in a dilemma: this is the first time he has something good to say when asked \\"What do you do?\\" (\\"television writer\\"), but he cannot use this title to pick up women because of Susan. However, if he breaks up with Susan to see other women, he'll wind up losing his job title, since Susan is one of the executives of NBC. Jerry is amused by the irony of this situation. Elaine talks colorfully about the diaphragm she carries around while Marla is in the room, unaware of Marla's virginity. Later, when Jerry informs her of this, she fears that she offended Marla and goes to talk to her. She then educates Marla on the \\"normal behavior\\" of men after they're through having sex with someone. This makes Marla hesitant to have sex with Jerry. George comes up with an idea for the pilot, involving a man being forced into becoming a butler after a set of insurance-related circumstances. Meanwhile, Elaine becomes the indirect cause of a biking accident that delivery boy Ping has. Jerry pitches the butler idea to the NBC executives, getting much unexpected approval; during the meeting, George inadvertently gets Susan fired by kissing her in front of NBC executive Rita (Anne Twomey). She breaks up with him, but George finds that he still cannot pick up women, most of whom view the role of sitcom writer as unprestigious. Production \\"The Virgin\\" was written by Peter Mehlman, and co-written by the Farrelly brothers, who went on to write and direct such comedies as Dumb and Dumber, There's Something About Mary, Shallow Hal, and Stuck on You. This episode introduced the character Marla. She also appears in the next episode, \\"The Contest\\", and has cameos in \\"The Pilot\\" and \\"The Finale\\". Jackie Swanson and Dedee Pfeiffer were additional actresses who auditioned for the role. In the episode, Jerry pitches the idea of an episode where all the main characters are doing is waiting for a table in a Chinese restaurant. This is an inside joke, pertaining to when Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David proposed season two's \\"The Chinese Restaurant\\". This left the real-life executives of NBC indifferent, as was the case when the idea was proposed in this episode. Bob Balaban (who plays Russell Dalrymple) was supposed to appear in this scene, but the role was written out due to a scheduling conflict. It is explained in the episode that Russell had to deal with \\"a problem on the set of Blossom.\\" Reception Over 16 million people viewed this episode. It gained an 11.6 Nielsen Rating and a 17 audience share, meaning that 11.6% of American households watched the episode, and 17% of all televisions in use at the time were tuned into it.

It is the 12th episode of the fourth season and aired on November 25, 1992. Plot Jerry and Elaine are flying home from St. Louis to New York after Jerry has performed a show and Elaine has visited her sister. Elaine objects to Jerry paying the skycap his suggested tip, arguing it is far too much. In revenge, the skycap sends her luggage on a flight to Honolulu. When their flight to John F. Kennedy International Airport is cancelled, Jerry and Elaine rebook on a flight to LaGuardia Airport, which has one seat left in first class and one in coach. Jerry claims the first class seat, arguing that Elaine has never flown first class and so cannot miss it. Elaine is uncomfortable in the small coach seats and deals with rude, obnoxious people while Jerry parties in first class with a model, Tia Van Camp (Jennifer Campbell), and a steady flow of complimentary wine and desserts. Elaine sneaks into first class, but is immediately caught and returned to coach. Due to their having to rebook and a rerouting of their flight, George and Kramer go between JFK and LaGuardia to pick them up. At JFK, George takes the last copy of Time, since Jerry mentioned George in his interview for the magazine. Another customer argues he has more right to the magazine since he is the cover feature. Looking at the customer's face and the headline \\"Caught!\\", George realizes his companions are a police escort and so taunts him with the magazine as he is dragged away. Kramer sees a man who he believes is a former roommate, John Grossbard, who owes him $240 from twenty years ago. Kramer hatches a scheme: he and George will buy tickets for the man's flight and board it, Kramer gets his money back, and they get off the plane and return the tickets. George buys into the scheme, as it will give him frequent flier miles, and he will just get his money back. However, Kramer buys non-refundable tickets, claiming the woman who sold them convinced him it was a good deal, much to George's dismay. The two board the plane and Kramer confronts Grossbard, demanding the money; when Grossbard denies knowing Kramer, Kramer attempts to reach into his pocket and grab his wallet, which creates a scene. During this, George is waiting for the bathroom. When the door opens up, it is the prisoner. He grabs George, pulls him into the bathroom, and locks the door. Kramer is detained and removed from the plane, but he escapes the security guard's grasp and runs away. When Jerry and Elaine land, Tia gives Jerry her phone number, while she is followed by paparazzi. Elaine's bag arrives in Honolulu. Kramer comes sliding down the baggage chute. Jerry, Elaine, and Kramer leave, while George is seen on the airplane, flying to an unknown location, screaming for help. Production In the scene where Elaine is offered the kosher meal, the voice from across the aisle, claiming he had ordered it, is Larry David's. Larry Charles, writer of the episode, makes an appearance coming out of an airplane bathroom before Elaine goes in. Deck McKenzie, Jerry Seinfeld's stand-in on the show, appears as the security guard. When confronted by the shackled prisoner in the airport gift shop, George says, \\"But you are, Blanche. You ARE in the shackles!\\" This is a reference to What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?, where Baby Jane Hudson delivers a similar line to a wheelchair-bound Blanche Hudson.

The exposure is subtle enough that no one notices it until after Elaine has mailed out the Christmas card to all of her friends and relatives, including her 10-year-old nephew and her religious boyfriend. Though she believes the nipple can be ignored, Jerry manages to confirm the nipple can be easily seen by using Newman. Jerry has a date with Tia Van Camp (Jennifer Campbell), the Calvin Klein model he met on the plane in the previous episode. After the date, Kramer identifies the perfume Tia is wearing as the one he pitched to a Calvin Klein representative in \\"The Pez Dispenser\\", called \\"The Beach\\". She tells him it is a new Calvin Klein product called \\"Ocean\\". Tia dumps Jerry after witnessing him scratching his nose, which she mistakes for him picking his nose. Jerry attempts to explain his actions at the Calvin Klein office but Tia refuses to believe him. Jerry launches into a rant about how people who pick their noses should not be socially ostracized, with references to The Merchant of Venice and The Elephant Man. Elaine delivers a similar speech to her boyfriend when he breaks up with her over the nipple exposure. George visits a therapist to discuss a problem with his girlfriend Susan, but the session is unproductive as first George, and then also the therapist, obsess over the stuck zipper on George's jacket. George convinces Susan to get back together with him by citing the example of Louis Pasteur and his wife. Upon their reconciliation he again feels entrapped by the relationship, so he uses \\"the pick\\" to disgust her enough to break up with him again. Kramer confronts Calvin Klein (Nicholas Hormann) to complain about \\"Ocean\\", and is instead asked to be an underwear model. In the first advertisement to feature Kramer, his genitals are accidentally exposed. Production The original title for this episode was supposed to be \\"The Nipple\\", but Larry David thought that this would be too sexually explicit for network television. Newman appears in this episode for only 13 seconds when Jerry brings him in and asks if Elaine's nipple is visible in her Christmas card photo.

It is led by self-taught Philippine guitarist-composer Johnny Alegre, together with bassist Colby de la Calzada, drummer Koko Bermejo, pianist Elhmir Saison and saxophonist Tots Tolentino. The ensemble first gathered in May 2002 at Manila‚Äôs Pink Noise Studios for Alegre‚Äôs composition, ‚ÄúStones of Intramuros‚Äù, for inclusion in the jazz anthology CD, Adobo Jazz Vol. 1, and thereafter carried on as a working unit. The band's first public appearance in October of the same year for the Adobo Jazz album launch at the Monk's Dream Jazz Bar heralded the AFFINITY's reputation ‚Äìas described by aficionados in the ensuing reviews‚Äî as ‚ÄúManila‚Äôs Jazz Superband‚Äù, with a power trio at its core. For the remainder of the year, the group emerged in various guises and personnel variations, manned by a who's who of luminaries from the Philippine jazz scene. In 2003, the original quintet that recorded ‚ÄúStones of Intramuros‚Äù returned to the studio to record new compositions by Alegre; followed by a succession of other dates leading to the release of the eponymous album, Johnny Alegre AFFINITY, by the UK-based jazz specialty label, Candid Records. The band was prominently featured at the annual F√™te de la Musique and the Korg Music Festival. In November, the Johnny Alegre AFFINITY inaugurated their new compositions and arrangements before an enthusiastic jazz audience at the University of the Philippines Theatre, which was subsequently broadcast, live, on prime time over national television. This national debut performance was also issued as a DVD by the sponsoring Upsilon Sigma Phi fraternity, and had since been included in a historical documentary of Philippine Jazz, issued by the Jazz Society of the Philippines. In 2004, AFFINITY once again became the focal point of two major jazz concert events, the Makati Jazz Festival celebrating its Foundation Day; and the 2nd Manila Jazz Festival. In 2005, through critical support matched by impressive album sales, Candid Records ushered the Manila ‚Äújazz superband‚Äù through a tour of stellar performances (highlighted by a formal launch at the famed Ayala Museum), capped by two groundbreaking performances at London's PizzaExpress Jazz Club. Their repeat performance in the 3rd Manila Jazz Festival was subsequently issued as a DVD by the Jewelmer Corporation (that also featured the Jamie Oehlers Group from Australia and several Philippine artists). A new Candid Records release, entitled Eastern Skies, was launched in December 2007 featuring AFFINITY amidst big band and symphonic arrangements by orchestrator Ria Osorio featuring the music of Johnny Alegre with the Global Studio Orchestra, conducted by Gerard Salonga.

When he tells Jerry and Elaine, they enthusiastically plan a double date, much to George's dismay, as he imagines himself being upstaged by Jerry. At the restaurant, Elaine asks Cheryl for advice on dealing with the lawsuit from Ping, the Chinese food delivery boy whom Elaine injured in \\"The Virgin\\". Cheryl reveals that she is the prosecuting attorney in the case, as Ping is her cousin. Jerry and Elaine joke about this coincidence, making Cheryl laugh hysterically. While she is away, George makes them promise not to be funny around her. Jerry overdoes it, making comments that are so morbid that Cheryl is depressed by the end of the date. At Jerry's apartment, Kramer returns early from baseball fantasy camp, where he accidentally punched Mickey Mantle. Elaine sees Cheryl with George and thanks her for persuading Ping to drop the case. She says that she did that because they all seemed like such nice people. As Elaine is giving Jerry the mail that she has been holding for him while he was out of town, Babu Bhatt, the Pakistani who Jerry tried to help in \\"The Cafe\\", is hauled off by the INS.

They go to the jail where Babu is being held. When they tell him what happened he becomes angry. Jerry promises to straighten things out. Jerry has lunch with Cheryl, where he continues his morose facade, so that he can ask her to solve Babu's problems with the INS. When she sees George, she confesses that she is attracted to Jerry's dark, disturbed personality. George, realizing his scheme has backfired, tells her the truth. Stunned at this revelation, she gets up and leaves. At Jerry's apartment, Elaine sees Ping and thanks him for dropping the case.

It is the 16th episode for the fourth season, and first aired on February 4, 1993. Plot Jerry and George struggle to keep NBC interested in their show. In writing the pilot, they drop their plan to include a character based on Elaine, because they don't know how to write for a woman. Kramer tells Jerry that he encountered Gail Cunningham, who Jerry previously dated; Kramer snubbed her because she refused to kiss Jerry after three dates. Gail confronts Jerry at Monk's Caf√© over Kramer's behavior, for which he disavows responsibility. Elaine is wearing a pair of shoes from Botticelli, and feels embarrassed when Gail makes a big deal over it. George asks his therapist for feedback on the script. She reveals that she didn't like it, and George throws a tantrum. Kramer tells Jerry that he encountered Gail again, and ended up kissing her. Jerry is perturbed that she would willingly kiss Kramer without even going on a real date, and Kramer hypothesizes that it was the snubbing which made her so amorous. After Kramer tells Elaine that Gail told him about Elaine's shoes, she confronts Gail at the restaurant where she is a chef. Elaine, who is coming down with the flu, sneezes on a plate of pasta primavera that is then served to NBC executive Russell Dalrymple. Jerry and George finish writing their script and meet Russell at his apartment home, but Russell runs to the bathroom when he becomes violently ill with the stomach flu. Russell's 15-year-old daughter arrives, and Russell catches George staring at the girl's cleavage; he sends them away without providing any input on the script. Jerry and George decide that the best way to assuage Russell's anger would be to demonstrate their point-of-view by arranging for him to stare at Elaine's cleavage. Gail agrees to inform Jerry when Russell dines at her restaurant again, on the condition that Elaine give her the Botticelli shoes. Elaine wears a low-cut dress to the restaurant and Russell stares at her cleavage; he acknowledges to Jerry and George that a man will stare at cleavage that enters his field of vision. Jerry, George, and Elaine eat at the restaurant. Elaine agrees to go on a date with Russell. She persuades Jerry and George to write her into the 'Jerry' scripts. When she suggests a scenario where the butler is distracted by her cleavage, the others decry this type of humor as \\"too broad\\" for their show, but soon relent. Production This was the first episode of season 4 in which Seinfeld was moved from its Wednesday time slot to Thursday at 9:30, right after Cheers, which was in its last season. Seinfeld would take over Cheers spot the following fall and remain there for the rest of the series. The four main characters apprised their viewers of this change in a short segment that ran during the Super Bowl. It's revealed in the DVD \\"Inside Look\\" that many on the show were worried that people would be viewing Seinfeld for the first time in this new spot and therefore would know nothing about the story arc of Jerry and George's NBC pilot. The show's popularity skyrocketed through the rest of the season, however, starting its successful run. As David Sims wrote at The A.V. Club, \\"The whole thing was promoted during the Super Bowl and was the start of Seinfeld moving from semi-popular critical hit to world-invading zeitgeist water-cooler explosion.\\"  Critical reception  Reviewer David Sims gave the episode an A, saying, \\"Every cast member gets some really fun material to play with and the plots spiral together marvelously... This plot is a great dissection of male honor, or the bro code, or whatever you want to call it. ... Seinfeld episodes like this are almost like heist movies‚Äîit's just great watching a plot come together.\\" Aaron George of Place2BeNation, giving a grade of 7 out of 10, said, \\"I continue to really enjoy all the 'writing' scenes. They truly capture the essence of the excitement of finding hilarity in the most mundane lines that you write.\\" On the other hand, \\"It's starting to stretch the believability a bit that Jerry is continuing to write this pilot with George.

The line \\"‚Ä¶ not that there's anything wrong with that\\"‚Äîas a reference to homosexuality‚Äîhas become a popular catchphrase among fans. Plot While at Monk's Caf√©, Elaine notices a woman in a nearby booth eavesdropping, and as a prank speaks to Jerry and George as if they were a closeted gay couple. The eavesdropping woman turns out to be Sharon, a New York University reporter who is planning on interviewing Jerry. Later, Sharon visits Jerry's apartment to conduct the interview. His and George's conversation during the interview inadvertently solidifies her misconception that they are gay. Eventually, they recognize her from the coffee shop, and strenuously deny that they are gay, conditioning their denials with \\"Not that there's anything wrong with that.\\" Throughout the episode, Jerry and George fear being seen as homosexual, yet also feel afraid they will be perceived as homophobic. The interview with Jerry is published in the school newspaper, and subsequently gets picked up by the Associated Press. Sharon asks to see Jerry, leading to them kissing in his apartment. George decides to use his (fake) orientation as an excuse to break up with his girlfriend, Allison (Kari Coleman). George tries to act outraged at finding Jerry making out with Sharon to prove that he is homosexual to Allison, but when Jerry doesn't follow along, George's ruse doesn't convince her and Sharon walks out. In a last-ditch attempt to get Allison to break up with him, George tells her he is a porn actor, but this only makes her even more attracted to him. Kramer enters his apartment with an attractive young man, causing George and Jerry to briefly wonder if he is gay.

Jerry gets assigned to Sid Fields, a bad-tempered old man with a Senegalese housekeeper, who he claims is trying to steal his possessions. Elaine is repulsed by the goiter of the woman she is visiting and George depresses his assigned senior citizen, Ben Cantwell, by questioning his outlook on dying, until he walks out. George becomes interested in Mr. Fields' housekeeper when Jerry mentions that she can't speak English. Kramer and Newman try selling Jerry's old records to a used record store but are not satisfied when the owner offers them a very small amount, as the records are all by obscure artists and of minimal interest. Fields tells Jerry he is throwing away of some of his \\"junk\\", including some old records. When Jerry invites Kramer and Newman to come pick them up, Fields gets upset at their frantic intrusion and bites Kramer's arm, causing him to jerk back and launch his dentures into the sink. They are promptly destroyed after George (visiting to meet the housekeeper) turns on the garbage disposal, mistaken for a light switch. Jerry loses track of Fields when they try to take him to the dentist to replace the dentures. Kramer and Newman take Fields' records to the music store's owner, who offers them a slightly larger sum of money, since the records are all very common. Kramer eggs Newman into insulting the owner and a fight ensues, resulting in the records being destroyed. After discovering that the phone line in Fields‚Äô apartment is busy, everyone (including Fields' son) rushes over, expecting Fields to have found his way back, and instead burst in on George and the housekeeper in a state of undress.

Plot After dinner, Jerry and Elaine discover a strong smell of body odor in Jerry's BMW 5 Series, assumed to have been left by a valet who was tasked with parking it. After they endure an unpleasant drive to the home of Elaine's boyfriend Carl (Nick Bakay), Carl is offended by the smell of Elaine's hair when they embrace. He tells her he has to get up early, so she does not spend the night. George and Kramer return a video; at the video store, he admires two women who are holding hands. George is astounded when they turn around and one is his ex-girlfriend, Susan, who tells George she converted to lesbianism shortly after they broke up. Meanwhile, Kramer practices his golf swing with a broom in front of Susan's girlfriend, Mona, a golf instructor. She is clearly amused by him. The clerk tells George that he has to pay a $2 fee because he didn't rewind the tape. Kramer suggests it would be cheaper to keep the video, rewind it himself, and return it the next day. Kramer comments that Jerry and Elaine have absorbed the body odor from the car. Elaine realizes the odor is the reason Carl didn't spend the night with her. Jerry demands that the restaurant share the cost of cleaning the car. The restaurant ma√Ætre d' (Michael Des Barres) refuses. Jerry locks him inside the car, not letting him out until he agrees to pay half of the $250 fee. George discovers someone stole the video out of the car while he and Jerry were inside the restaurant. Mona is attracted to Kramer, which Jerry, Elaine and George cannot understand; she has never been with a man. This angers Susan, due to her dislike of Kramer, as well as George, who worries that he drove Susan to lesbianism. Feeling more attracted to her after finding this out, George attempts to woo Susan, and appears to be making progress. However, the two are approached in Monk's Caf√© by George's ex, Allison (from the episode \\"The Outing\\"), who instantly establishes a mutual attraction with Susan. After a complete \\"de-ionizing\\" of the car, Jerry discovers the stink is still there. Elaine goes to a hair salon to wash the smell out of her hair, but Carl tells her that she still smells. She finally resorts to dousing her hair in tomato sauce. Jerry tries to sell the car, but the dealer claims he cannot sell it. Kramer's relationship with Mona ends when she smells the odor on him - he had borrowed Jerry's jacket, which he was wearing in the car. Jerry tries abandoning the car, deliberately dropping the keys in plain view of a street hoodlum. The hood takes the keys and hops into the car, but is disgusted by the smell. Production Co-writer Peter Mehlman got the idea for the episode from the real-life experiences of a friend of his. According to Mehlman, the friend would frequently pitch him ideas for episodes, none of which were even close to being good enough to use, but on this occasion the friend was simply complaining about the ordeal, at which point Mehlman immediately decided that it would be perfect for the show. Amy McWilliams remarks that this is an example of many episodes that are \\"open-ended\\": it lacks \\"a traditional resolution completely, as when the viewer is simply left with a final comic shot of a street hoodlum wrinkling his nose as he tries to steal 'The Smelly Car'.\\" Critical response Linda S.

It aired on May 13, 1993. Plot The group travels to a mall in Lynbrook to buy a big-screen television as an engagement gift for their friend \\"The Drake\\" (Rick Overton). George, who has borrowed his father's treasured car (a 1978-1980 model Mercury Monarch), parks in a handicapped parking space after being urged by Kramer to do so since they couldn't find any spaces. When they return, they find an angry mob plotting to attack the vehicle's owner because a disabled woman, who had to park in a distant spot because of their illegal parking, has been injured in a wheelchair accident. After sneaking away, they try to come up with a plan to divert the mob's attention and blame both George and, especially, Kramer. They later return to find the car completely demolished. George invents a preposterous story about being cut off in traffic to explain the accident. While visiting Lola (Donna Evans Merlo), the injured handicapped woman, at the hospital, Kramer falls in love and feels compelled to replace her wheelchair. George and Kramer go on to buy a used wheelchair which is much cheaper than a brand-new, top-of-the-line model. Jerry and Elaine go to have lunch with The Drake after missing his party and discover that he and his fianc√©e have broken off their engagement. They are indignant that the former couple are not returning their expensive engagement presents to the givers, believing that this should be common courtesy when an engagement is broken. Discretely inquiring about the TV, they learn that The Drake let his ex-fiance have all the gifts, and she in turn donated them to charity. George's father Frank Costanza receives an award for outstanding service in helping the handicapped. In the middle of receiving the award, he is arrested for George's parking in the handicap spot, as Frank is the registered owner of the vehicle. As a result of the accusation, Frank's award is taken away from him. Frank forces him to become his butler as punishment, an idea taken from the pilot episode that George is writing with Jerry. Lola breaks up with Kramer (telling him that he's not good looking enough for her and to drop dead) and later rolls down a hill in the used wheelchair, which she cannot stop due to faulty brakes. George's first job as his father's butler is to retrieve the big- screen TV at The Drake's house, so that it can be donated to charity. George and Kramer retrieve the TV, then reunite with Jerry and Elaine to return it for a refund. In the final scene, the gang is once again looking for a parking space at the mall, and Kramer tries to talk George into parking next to a fire hydrant, using near-identical rationales as he had at the handicapped spot. Production This is the first appearance of George's father Frank Costanza, played by John Randolph. After this episode, Randolph was replaced with Jerry Stiller, who would play Frank for the rest of the series. In 1995, the scenes in which Randolph appeared were re-shot with Stiller for the series' syndication in the United States. However in some syndicated airings Randolph is still listed in the credits.

It makes up the 63rd and 64th episodes and first aired on May 20, 1993. This two-part episode aired at an earlier time, 8:00 PM, to make room for the two-hour finale of Cheers, whose timeslot would be claimed by Seinfeld at the start of the new fall season. Approximately 32 million people watched this episode (both parts) when it initially aired, and the show became a major ratings grab for its next five seasons. Plot =Part 1= Jerry and George get the green light to produce Jerry, the pilot for the series based on their \\"nothing\\" lives. Russell Dalrymple, the president at NBC behind the pilot, is obsessed with Elaine. George is obsessed with a potentially cancerous white spot on his lip and a box of raisins taken by an actor playing Kramer. The real Kramer appears to audition for the role of Kramer in ‚ÄúJerry‚Äù but has an urgent need to use the men‚Äôs room. Unable to locate public facilities, Kramer makes his way to his apartment through Central Park but is further delayed by being mugged and \\"misses his chance\\", resulting in constipation. Jerry has an audition with the new \\"Elaine\\", a method actress interested in being Elaine in every way, including insisting being called Elaine and even going as far as dating Jerry (and breaking up with him in Part 2). Jerry points out to the real Elaine that Monk's coffee shop appears to be only hiring buxom waitresses, so she tries to get hired; when the owner turns her down, she files a report with the Equal Employment Opportunity office. =Part 2= Rehearsals for the pilot begin. NBC executive Russell Dalrymple's obsession with Elaine begins to affect his work. She tries to let him down easy by saying she can't be in a relationship with a high-powered man and would prefer to be with someone selfless, such as a member of Greenpeace. Kramer resolves his constipation by administering himself an enema. George thinks that his white spot has been diagnosed as cancer and goes on a tirade at NBC, only to discover that he misunderstood the diagnosis. At the taping of the pilot, \\"Crazy\\" Joe Davola leaps out of the audience and onto the set while yelling \\"Sic semper tyrannis!\\" He's removed and the taping goes poorly, with the director and actors getting increasingly annoyed by George's kibitzing, and Jerry coming to the discovery that he is not as good at acting as he is at standup. The pilot airs and numerous characters from past episodes comment on it. In order to prove himself worthy of Elaine, Russell joins Greenpeace and is lost at sea during a botched assault on a whaling ship. The cover for the Jerry pilot script floats away at sea along with the former NBC president as one of Russell's shipmates vows to find Elaine and tell her about Russell's actions in fighting the whalers. His replacement at NBC, Rita Kearson, dislikes the show and cancels it immediately, without waiting for the ratings to come in. George and Jerry blame Elaine for driving Russell to leave. Jerry, George, Kramer, and Elaine convalesce at Monk's, where Elaine spots the men from the Equal Employment Opportunity office eating. She scolds the owner of the cafe for only hiring large breasted women; the owner explains that they are all his daughters.

In the \\"Inside Look\\" commentary on the Seinfeld Season 5 DVD, Larry David revealed that a friend of his came up with the setup of this episode: Elaine never having orgasms with Jerry. Larry David said that the idea was \\"too good to pass up.\\" Plot In Monk's Caf√©, George tells Jerry about his lack of confidence in bed with his new girlfriend Karen, and entertains the possibility that she is faking her orgasms. Elaine mentions that she feigned all her orgasms while she and Jerry were dating. Jerry is flabbergasted at this revelation. Kramer takes a bite out of a bad peach, which he tries to return to the store where he bought it. This leads to him being banned from the store after he insults the owner, Joe. Meanwhile, Jerry begs Elaine to give him another shot at giving her an orgasm, which she rebuffs in the belief that sex will ruin their friendship. This causes Jerry to become bitter and resentful toward Elaine. George becomes so obsessed with his performance in bed with Karen that he experiences what seems to be erectile dysfunction. Kramer asks Jerry to buy fruit in his place at Joe‚Äôs store. Jerry is banned when Joe realizes he is shopping for Kramer. George winds up buying fruit for both Kramer and Jerry. George tastes one of Kramer‚Äôs mangoes, which causes an erotic transformation, prompting him to race to Karen's apartment. Though he impresses her with his sexual performance, Karen throws George out of her apartment when he ridicules her vocalizations during orgasm, incorrectly assuming she was faking. Elaine agrees to have sex with Jerry after concluding it will destroy their friendship if they don't do it. However, Jerry again fails to give her an orgasm, and blames George. Elaine then asks: \\"Y'know, I'm a little hungry ... you wouldn't happen to have any of that mango left?\\" Jerry then realizes his solution. Reception This episode gained a Nielsen rating of 19.3 and an audience share of 29, meaning that 19.3% of American households watched the episode, and 29% of all televisions in use at the time were tuned into it. This episode was first read by its cast on August 11, 1993, at 10:30 a.m. to much anticipation, as it was to premiere in a new 9:00 timeslot. NBC officials, however, were a bit more apprehensive because it was taking over the timeslot of the highly successful sitcom Cheers. Production Larry David used the pseudonym \\"Buck Dancer\\" for this episode when credited. \\"The Mango\\" was written by Larry David and Lawrence H. Levy. The subplot in which Kramer is banned from a fruit shop is based on one of David‚Äôs personal experiences, where he himself was banned from a fruit shop for squeezing the product too much.\\"Inside Look\\" on the Seinfeld Season 5 DVD When the episode aired, David found himself in the middle of a media frenzy surrounding the now-popular show. David gave some insight to his approach on writing the script by saying, \\"I like taking the worst qualities that a person has and trying to make something funny out of it. Doesn‚Äôt everybody do terrible things and have terrible thoughts? Just by trying to be as funny, you‚Äôre going to deal with a lot of things that are real, so the show‚Äôs really about something. The whole thing about the show being about nothing is ridiculous.\\" Kenny Kramer (who was the inspiration for Kramer) said that Jerry, George, Elaine, and Kramer are \\"the most shallow, superficial, self- indulgent people...but we see there‚Äôs a little of us in them, our own dark character.\\" Awards and nominations The Mango received the following awards/nominations: *1994 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Writing in a Comedy Series nomination: Larry David and Lawrence H.

Jerry doesn't know what to think of George's uncanny ability to see fine details while \\"squinting;\\" however, after George mistakes an onion for an apple, Jerry wonders whether George was also mistaken about seeing Amy with Jeffrey. After trying on many pairs of glasses, George finally decides upon a new style and buys them, but is distressed when Kramer later points out that they are women's-style glasses made by Gloria Vanderbilt. Dwayne also refuses George a discounted price. When Kramer finds out about the refused discount, he goes down to the optometrist and \\"threatens\\" him with a candy bar, forcing Dwayne to reinstate the discount and his promise to Kramer in owing him. George then makes a deal with an unsuspecting blind man to trade the man's uncomfortable eyeglass frames with George's, and have the lenses switched. With his vision back, George finally realizes that it was not Amy kissing Jeffrey, but a mounted police woman affectionately petting her horse. Meanwhile, Kramer bursts into Jerry's apartment and accidentally jars Jerry's giant new air conditioner loose from the windowsill; the unit falls to the sidewalk, serendipitously crushing and almost killing the same dog that had bitten Elaine. Uncle Leo gives Jerry and Amy tickets to see Paul Simon live and tells them that Jeffrey apologized; Jerry mistakes Jeffrey's apology for the latter supposedly seeing Amy and blames her until Uncle Leo says Jeffrey apologized for getting different seats. The episode ends as we see George's \\"stolen\\" glasses right on top of the lockers in the Health Club. Production The theft of writer Tom Gammill's glasses from a gym was the inspiration for George's predicament. Gammill's solution was to wear prescription goggles. A short scene revealing that Amy was in fact having an affair with Jeffrey was filmed but deleted before broadcast.

It is the fifth episode of the fifth season, and first aired on October 14, 1993. Plot Jerry, Elaine, George, and Kramer go to the hospital to meet friends who have just had a baby. At the hospital, George gets a parking spot right in front of the hospital, but a mental patient jumps from the roof and lands on it. George attempts to get the hospital to pay for the damages, but the director refuses and insinuates that George is running a scam. Meanwhile, Kramer stumbles into the wrong room at the hospital (1937 instead of 1397) and becomes convinced that he has seen a \\"pig man\\" (half-pig, half-man). He espouses a conspiracy theory concerning the government and genetic mutation leading to pig-men armies. Jerry and Elaine agree to be the newborn baby's godparents. Jerry uses the role as a prompt to perform impersonations of Marlon Brando's character from The Godfather, but his friends are severely unimpressed. They are obligated to arrange the bris, which involves booking a mohel and holding the baby during the circumcision. Kramer, disturbed by the concept of the bris, upsets the mother with grotesque descriptions of circumcision and seizes the baby in an unsuccessful rescue attempt. The mohel (Charles Levin) is extremely irritable and high-strung and implies that he was charged with malpractice due to a botched circumcision on at least one previous occasion. Made increasingly nervous by this, Jerry flinches as the circumcision gets underway, and the mohel cuts Jerry's finger. The four go to the hospital, where the baby's parents have to break up a fight between Jerry and the mohel. Jerry's finger is stitched up. Kramer finds the \\"pig man\\" (whom he discovers is actually \\"a fat little mental patient\\") and \\"liberates\\" him from the hospital. The \\"pig man\\" steals George's car, which was again conveniently parked. The parents strip Jerry and Elaine of their role as godparents, deciding they prefer Kramer due to the concern he expressed for the baby. Pleased, Kramer performs an off-the-cuff impersonation of The Godfather which far eclipses Jerry's.

It is the sixth episode of the fifth season, and first aired on October 28, 1993. Plot Jerry and George are at the US Open. During a break, George buys an ice cream sundae and gets it all over his face, which is broadcast on television and mocked by the commentators. Jerry becomes smitten with Laura (Marlee Matlin), a deaf lineswoman. Kramer decides to become a ball boy for the tournament, and excels at the tryouts. Elaine, who is using her company's car service, is tired of having to always make small talk with the drivers. She pretends to have a hearing problem to avoid talking to him but is caught when she reacts to a radio message for the driver to pick up Tom Hanks. When the driver is angry with her for faking deafness, she gets him tickets to a Metallica concert, which causes the driver to temporarily lose his hearing. George's girlfriend Gwen (Linda Kash) breaks up with him, telling him \\"it's not you; it's me.\\" George is offended, but more by the fact he considers this to be his signature break-up line (\\"If it's anybody, it's me.\\" \\"Alright, George, it's you.\\" \\"You're damn right it's me!\\"). George suspects the real reason for the breakup is that Gwen saw the video of him eating the ice cream and was disgusted. When George finds out that Laura can read lips, he asks her to come with him to a party that he knows Gwen will attend and eavesdrop on conversations to find out the real reason she dumped him. The gang take Elaine's car service to the party, and the car is driven by the same driver as Elaine had before. When he recognizes Elaine, the driver throws everyone out of his car. They end up walking to the party, arriving late. During Gwen's conversation with a male friend, Kramer (having learned some sign language from a cousin) interprets for Laura, incorrectly interpreting that Gwen and the male friend are agreeing to \\"sleep together\\" instead of \\"sweep together.\\" George confronts them angrily, causing a scene. Later, the group returns to the US Open to watch Kramer serve as a \\"ball man\\" at the first match of Monica Seles' comeback (from her stabbing injury). However, soon into the match, Kramer runs into Seles, injuring her. After the match, Laura gets into the limo with the same chatty driver. When he starts talking to her, she explains to him that she's deaf. He gives her a dubious expression, thinking she is faking it like Elaine. Production \\"The Lip Reader\\" was writer Carol Leifer's first produced script for Seinfeld. As had become a signature of the show, Leifer drew on her real life experiences for the storylines. While working as a stand-up comedian, Leifer used a car service for traveling between shows; preferring to have \\"some peace and quiet\\" during her rides, she was annoyed that she consistently ended up with drivers who would talk to her even when she buried her face in a magazine. She added in Elaine's pretending to be deaf to both tie her plot in with George's and raise the down-to-earth experience of not wanting to talk with drivers to a level of absurdity. Sports commentators ridiculing a spectator who was messily eating a hot fudge sundae was something Leifer actually saw on TV. In the scene where George comes up with the idea of using Laura to eavesdrop on his ex-girlfriend, Leifer's script had Jerry and George talking out of the sides of their mouths in order to avoid being lip-read by Laura. Actors Jerry Seinfeld and Jason Alexander came up with the idea of using organic gestures to cover their mouths on their own. Critical reception David Sims of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A- / B+, calling it \\"perfectly good but just a little more forgettable than the stone cold classics season five opened with, \\"including \\"some very memorable moments.\\" Sims notes that much of the episode \\"makes George look like a fool.\\" Nick DeNitto remarked that \\"Laura's lip-reading isn't perfect, which leads to some funny moments of miscommunication.\\" Commentator Paul Arras praises the episode for its \\"jokes that take on stereotypes, political correctness, and other assumptions about etiquette.\\" > While Elaine becomes the foil, Matlin plays the character with such self- > confidence and empowerment, it's easy to forget that social etiquette > implies her deafness should be cause for pity.

The film has an ensemble cast, including Joel David Moore, Kane Hodder, Deon Richmond, Tamara Feldman, Richard Riehle, Mercedes McNab, Robert Englund, and Tony Todd. In the style of old-school slasher films, such as Friday the 13th, the plot follows a group of tourists on a New Orleans haunted swamp tour, who accidentally get stranded in the wilderness, only to be hunted by a vengeful, supernatural deformed man who kills anyone that enters the swamp. The film spawned three sequels‚ÄîHatchet II, Hatchet III, and Victor Crowley‚Äîand a comic book series. Plot Sampson and his son Ainsley are hunting alligators in a swamp. While Ainsley is urinating, Sampson falls silent; Ainsley finds Sampson dead before he too is killed by a monstrous being. During a Mardi Gras celebration in New Orleans, a group of friends including Ben and his best friend Marcus decide to go on a haunted swamp tour. They find the tour closed because the guide, Rev. Zombie, was sued for negligence. Rev. Zombie suggests they try a place farther down the street, owned by the over-the-top, inexperienced tour guide Shawn. Marcus decides to leave but changes his mind upon seeing two topless girls: Misty, a ditzy porn star, and Jenna, a bossy, boastful, up-and-coming actress. Their sleazy director, Doug Shapiro, is also present. Ben pays for himself and Marcus and Shawn leads them to his tour bus, where the other tourists, Jim and Shannon Permatteo, a Minnesota married couple, and the quiet, hot-tempered Marybeth are waiting. Shawn does not know what he is doing, which the others realize as they arrive at the swamp. Shapiro has Misty and Jenna strip down and film a scene for Bayou Beavers as everyone boards the boat, while a homeless swamp-dweller named Jack Cracker warns them away from the swamp. Shawn leads them through swamplands and past abandoned houses, including one where Victor Crowley, a deformed creature, lived. The boat hits a rock and begins sinking, leaving them stranded. As the crew walks through the woods, they encounter the shabby Crowley house, and Marybeth shares the legend of Victor Crowley. Victor was a deformed child with a rare disease, bullied by other kids and was kept hidden by his father, Thomas Crowley. One night a group of mean teenagers stumbled across the house and threw fireworks at it to scare Victor. The house began burning, and Thomas returned, causing the teens to flee. Victor was killed when Thomas accidentally hit him in the face with a hatchet while trying to break down the door. Marybeth claims that Victor, now undead, roams the swamp at night, looking for his father, and that they are not safe in the woods, but the crew doesn't believe her. As Jim and Shannon approach the house, Victor appears and kills them, causing the group to flee. Marybeth shoots Victor with a handgun, but he gets up and resumes his pursuit. Shapiro splits from the group and is killed by Victor. The remaining survivors decide to return to the house where they can arm themselves. While at the house, Marybeth and Ben discover her brother and father's remains. Marcus, Shawn, Misty and Jenna hear a noise in a bush. Marcus goes to investigate and discovers that it was only a raccoon. Victor then surprises the group and injures Jenna with a belt sander. Marybeth and Ben return and attack Victor. While the other survivors flee, Shawn tries fighting Victor, but instead is killed. Victor then kills Jenna. The survivors decide to lure Victor back to his house and set him on fire with the gasoline tanks in the shed. Ben goes into the shed to retrieve a gasoline tank while Misty stands guard and Marybeth and Marcus act as bait. Marybeth and Marcus discover that Misty is missing, and her corpse is thrown onto Ben by Victor. Ben finds a tank and throws it on Victor while Marybeth and Marcus set him on fire, but rain extinguishes him. They start fleeing, but Victor grabs and kills Marcus. Victor grabs a gate pole and chases Ben and Marybeth, throwing it into Ben's foot. Marybeth bends the pole until it is pointed at Victor, who impales himself upon it and collapses, apparently killed. Ben and Marybeth flee in Sampson's boat; Marybeth is ensnared by seaweed and pulled underwater. She sees Ben's arm sticking into the water for her to grab, but is pulled up by Victor, who is holding a dying Ben's severed forearm. She screams in horror, as Crowley roars into her face, setting the opening for the next film.

For most of that period, he was the only white member of the government. Early life and career Stamps was born in Wales in 1936. After qualifying as a doctor in the UK, he went out to colonial Rhodesia in 1962 to join its Public Health Service. He spent the remainder of his life in Rhodesia and Zimbabwe. He was appointed as Deputy Medical Officer for the municipality of Salisbury in 1968 and was promoted to Chief Medical Officer in 1970. He was dismissed from this last post in 1974, allegedly for trying to switch the emphasis in healthcare provision slightly more towards the black community.Guardian :2000 interview At that time, whites comprised no more than 15% of the population of Salisbury but at least 60% of municipal spending on social services in the city was directed towards them. After his dismissal, Stamps worked as a doctor in a number of community projects while becoming increasingly interested in development and political activities. He became Chairman of the 'Freedom from Hunger' campaign (a UN-sponsored organisation) in Rhodesia. In May 1976, he was elected to Salisbury City Council. At the time of Zimbabwe's independence, an insurance funded healthcare system provided a first world provision for most whites. By contrast, most blacks enjoyed only the most basic of medical services. The only access to healthcare for blacks in rural areas was through mission station clinics or clinics provided by white farmers for workers and their families. In the early-1980s, Stamps was active in raising finance from overseas sources (government, NGO and international organisations) to fund the construction of clinics and community hospitals in rural areas. The Zimbabwean government also sought to expand healthcare facilities and Stamps worked closely with the Ministry of Health on a number of projects. One thing Stamps found with these early projects was this it was less difficult to raise funds to cover the capital construction cost of a project than it was to cover its continuing revenue costs. He also took an interest in wider social and economic problems facing Zimbabwe. The land tenure system which had been installed during the existence of Rhodesia had resulted in a situation in which most of the farming land in the country was either: (a) individually titled and white owned, or (b) collectively owned for use by African tribes. Both of these forms of tenure presented problems that needed to be urgently addressed. Although most Zimbabweans agreed on the need for reform in general terms, conservative elements (including both white farmers and African tribal chiefs) would put up stubborn resistance to specific proposals for reform. Stamps sought to develop a new model for land ownership and usage. In 1982, he acquired a formerly white-owned dairy farm near Harare for development as a co-operative. Funded by a $2,000,000 grant from the German charity AgroAction, he was able to settle 2,000 people at this farm. Stamps claimed that Vuti farm became self-funding after eight years. Political career At the 1980 election, Stamps fought the white roll Kopje constituency as an Independent candidate against the Rhodesian Front. Although he polled only about one-third of the vote in a straight fight, this was the highest vote for any non- Rhodesian Front candidate. Along with a number of the white elite in the post- independence period, Stamps subsequently joined ZANU-PF. Being one of only a small number of party members with healthcare management experience, Stamps' advice and services were eagerly sought. He became a ZANU-PF Member of Parliament at the 1985 general election and in 1986 was appointed as Minister of Health and Child Welfare ‚Äì a position he held until 2002. During his early years as a Minister, he promoted the development of community healthcare using the slogan \\"Health for All by the Year 2000\\". He oversaw a substantial expansion of the Zimbabwean healthcare and public health systems in the late-1980s and early-1990s. This expansion attracted a great deal of favourable attention both at home and abroad. The Zimbabwe experience was often held up as an example for other developing countries. Stamps took a lot of the credit for this and was frequently asked to address international conferences.ZIMBABWE-HEALTH: Breaking The Silence On AIDS, IPS News, 19 July 1996 His credibility in Zimbabwe was such that he could speak out on various matters that other politicians would exercise caution over. For example, his predecessor as Health Minister had dismissed the AIDS epidemic as a fiction invented by the media to cause panic. In an interview in 1996, Stamps commented that: > Ministers have tended to shy away from the issue because it is seen as > contaminated. AIDS activity by government is not seen as politically > beneficial, since it may offend conservative religious and traditional > groups and somehow attracts a stigma. There are no votes in talking about > AIDS. Only lost votes.\\" Stamps was also critical of police conduct in attempting to maintain public order, notably when measures to quell disorder at an international football match in 2000 ended up leaving eleven people dead. He also drew attention to \\"Project Coast\\", the name given to chemical and biological warfare programmes run by South Africa in the 1970s and 1980s.Frontline interview : Project Coast Project Coast included attempts to develop genetically engineered diseases and toxins that would affect blacks more than whites. The idea being to apply treatments to a population to correct any ethnic imbalance. Stamps' suggestion that various epidemics in Rhodesia in the 1970s (notably, an anthrax epidemic in 1978) may have been the result of a biological attack was widely disbelieved. A 'Southern African Research and Documentation Centre' report has claimed an unnamed former senior member of the Rhodesian Security Forces, and Colonel Lionel Dyke, a Mugabe ally who participated in the Gukurahundi, stated that anthrax and cholera spores (supplied by the South African Defence Force) were deliberately spread in the TTLs during the closing stages of the civil war.Southern African News Feature, 2001 :report on biological warfare in Rhodesia Events in the late-1990s pushed Zimbabwe into economic recession. This made it difficult to sustain many of the new healthcare facilities and services that had been constructed in earlier years. The government was struggling with a large budget deficit and the external bodies that had provided funding for building and equipment costs in the past seemed reluctant to fund the continuing operation of the associated facilities. Bad publicity concerning corruption, cronyism and incompetence in Zimbabwe did not help in this regard. The salaries paid to doctors and nurses were eroded by inflation, and many key personnel emigrated.The East African, 1998 :report on medical staff shortages There were also a series of damaging strikes that attracted unfavourable attention at home and abroad.AFP report, 1999 :health service problems Stamps found himself struggling to prevent the collapse of the system he had built up, and was reported to have lost his temper with media and union representatives on several occasions.Africaweb report from Financial Gazette, 1996 :minister attacks journalist During most of his time as Health Minister, Stamps was the only white member of the government. As such, he was often called upon to present the government's position on various matters which were outside his normal brief. For example, he frequently defended the government's policy on land reforms in interviews with Western journalists. This made him a hate figure to many White ZimbabweansReport on 2000 BBC Interview : caution, partisan view His popularity among both the members of ZANU-PF and the wider population declined as a result of problems in the healthcare system. However, Stamps remained well regarded by President Mugabe. During the near breakdown in relations between Whites in Zimbabwe and the ZANU-PF government around the time of the 2000 election, Stamps attempted to exercise some moderating influence on the situation: > Whites are the face of the problem, but the causes go deeper than that. In > general, our race relations are good ‚Äì certainly much better than those of > our neighbour, South Africa. We have the opportunity to improve on the solid > black/white relationship that has been built over the past 20 years. It is > the extremists who are creating divisions.Black peasants have waited for 110 > years, says white minister, The Guardian, 12 April 2000 Stamps actively campaigned for ZANU-PF in the 2000 election2000 Forum on Imperialism : caution, partisan view and was returned to the House of Assembly as a non-constituency MP. He carried on as Health Minister until March 2002, but was becoming increasingly exhausted, and in late 2001 he suffered a stroke. He was replaced as Health Minister by his deputy, David Parirenyatwa, in August 2002; due to Stamps' illness, Parirenyatwa had already been effectively running the ministry.\\"ZIMBABWE: New government without Makoni\\", SADOCC, 25 August 2002. After leaving the government, Stamps acted as adviser on health matters to the Office of the President. As a footnote to his political career, in July 2002 Stamps was one of 92 Zimbabweans subject to EU \\"smart sanctions\\" intended to express disapproval of various Zimbabwe government policies. Stamps was banned from the EU and access to assets he owned in the EU was frozen.UN press release, 2002 :EU names Zimbabwe blacklist Many observers found the EU's treatment of Dr. Stamps to be curious, given that by July 2002 he was retired from politics and a semi-invalid. Also, he had never been implicated in human rights abuses, anti-democratic acts, corruption or any other form of wrongdoing. In February 2008, as Health Adviser in the Office of the President and Cabinet, Stamps attended President Mugabe's eighty-fourth birthday celebrations with several other high-profile ZANU-PF party members. Death Dr. Timothy Stamps died on 26 November 2017 after succumbing to a lung infection on Sunday at the Borrowdale Trauma Centre in Harare. The Government of Zimbabwe declared him a National Hero.

In 2005, a 150-foot man-made waterfall was installed in the park, and dedicated in \\"Dr. Joe's\\" memory in 2007. The garden features a bog and lake that may be viewed from a half-mile long elevated boardwalk. Its plants include indigenous vegetation, with individually labeled trees, shrubs, ferns, and bamboo, as well as wildflowers and wild roses. The site is also a haven for native and migratory birds.

He was born in Quebec around 1784, the son of Thomas Fraser, and grew up in Edwardsburgh Township in Upper Canada. He worked from 1802 to 1806 as a clerk for the North West Company with Duncan Cameron at Lake Nipigon. He returned to Upper Canada in 1807 and settled at Johnstown. He served as lieutenant in the local militia during the War of 1812, becoming captain in 1813, and fought at the Battle of Crysler's Farm. Fraser was named justice of the peace in the Johnstown District in 1816. In 1818, he was fined for an assault on Robert Gourlay who was holding meetings in the eastern part of Upper Canada. He was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada in 1830 for Grenville. In 1832, he was appointed customs collector at Brockville. He commanded a group of militia at the Battle of the Windmill in 1838. In 1839, Fraser triggered some friction between Canada and the United States when he seized an American schooner for failing to declare a cannon to customs. By 1840, several banks had secured judgements against him for unpaid loans and the government was pressing him for customs duties that he had collected but not provided. He lost his post as customs collector and justice of the peace in 1843. He retired to the farm that he had named Fraserfield located on the Saint Lawrence, where he died in 1857.

This bargaining unit includes employees who perform a wide array of specialized, professional services from accounting to zoology. Within Minnesota, MAPE is the largest state bargaining unit with over 15,000 employees. Origin of MAPE In 1972 with the passage of the Public Employee Labor Relations Act (PELRA), state workers were given the right to join a union. Prior to 1972, the governor and the Minnesota Legislature controlled state employees' rights and benefits. With the passage of PELRA, state professional workers were initially represented by the international American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) - a union that currently represents many of the state's technicians, maintenance, and clerical workers. As time passed, state professionals discovered that the workplace issues they faced were different than many of the workers in AFSCME. Therefore, in 1980, these professionals voted to break away from this larger union to form their own independent union. This founding group of 4,500 grew to become the Minnesota Association of Professional Employees (MAPE), which now has over 11,850 members. As it does not have a national umbrella organization over it, MAPE is one of the largest independent unions in existence. Structure of MAPE In order to support a variety of worksites and employees located all over the state of Minnesota, MAPE has broken the state down into 21 separate regions. Members of each region are served by electing their own slate of officers to represent them at the local level. In order to make sure that the central organization is meeting the needs of all members in all regions, MAPE convenes a Delegate Assembly every Fall, typically in the first week or two of September. As MAPE has grown and new members joined, the organization has naturally evolved. Since 1999 MAPE has worked hard to be a proactive, member-driven group. A new region/local structure was designed to promote grassroots activism. Statewide Strike of 2001 Throughout the late 90s and into early 2000, Minnesota experienced a robust economy characterized by tax cuts and rebates. Things changed in 2001 after the ‚Äúdot-com‚Äù bust and the events of September 11. Recessionary times gave way to grim financial forecasts amid rising health care costs. The struggle to maintain benefit and compensation levels for state workers finally came to a head. MAPE and AFSCME members refused to accept the high co-pays and out-of-pocket expense limits proposed by the state, and so in September, 2001, members of the two biggest unions representing state workers voted overwhelmingly to strike. The Minnesota Association of Professional Employees announced that 84.2 percent of its members who voted rejected the state's final contract offer and authorized a strike, and earlier that day, leaders of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) Council 6 filed an official notice with the Bureau of Mediation Services and the state's Department of Employee Relations that more than 13,000, or 90 percent, of its voting members had approved a strike. Negotiators for the unions and the state held a preliminary meeting at the Bureau of Mediation Services on Sept. 6. The Bureau conducted additional sessions from Sept. 12 to Sept. 16. The major sticking point was wages. The state had offered a wage increase of about 2.5 percent per year but said that additional increases based on years of service could increase that to about 5 percent for many workers. The members were asking for increases of approximately 6 percent per year for the coming years. Governor Jesse Ventura kept a low profile. But he did order special training exercises for the Minnesota National Guard in the event that he would order them to replace striking state workers. Recent history After a devastating 2003 round of negotiations resulting in wage freezes and insurance increases, the 2005 negotiations team had a resolute goal to ‚Äòhold the line‚Äô on insurance increases while negotiating a fair wage increase. Many MAPE members even felt this was unrealistic but nonetheless, MAPE achieved its goal by holding the line on insurance increases while managing an across the board increases for everyone. MAPE Today MAPE has built on coalition power over the last five years and has become a leader in the Minnesota labor community. Some of the coalitions MAPE works with on a regular basis are: Minnesota is Watching the Minnesota Fair Trade Coalition Twin Cities Labor & Religion Network Upper Midwest Labor/Management Coalition on Health Care, Broad Purchasing Alliance, Minnesota Universal Health Care Coalition Alliance for a Better Minnesota, and many others. MAPE also partners with other unions and non-profits and works towards building a better community for all. The partial state government shutdown of July 2005 was an unprecedented fiasco which will live on in the minds of MAPE members and other state employees who were sent home for eight days that summer with no knowledge of when they would be allowed to return to work. The governor and legislature failed to pass a state budget by the constitutional deadline of midnight on June 30, 2005 and therefore had no authority to pay thousands of the state‚Äôs employees for work performed. The politicians further attempted to divide state employees by deeming some ‚Äúessential,‚Äù and sending the rest home. The ‚Äúmake half‚Äù settlement allowed those workers sent home, through no fault of their own to receive half of the pay or vacation hours lost ten months after the fact. Over the past five years, MAPE has expanded to include some school district, county and municipal government professional employees with separate bargaining agreements. These employees have sought out MAPE because they see the value and strength of having a union protecting their rights and benefits. MAPE continues on its mission to protect and promote the interests of public employees. MAPE is committed to lobbying for its members to have all the resources they need to provide quality public services to the state‚Äôs citizens.

History Dahanu is an ancient town with a long history. It was settled probably as early as 500 CE. Some records show possible settlement as early as 150 BC. The reasons for nomadic lifestyle of locals are unknown. All these developments are before 100 CE and are in reference to Dahanu area rather than Dahanu village. Later the village was settled. Soon it attracted many other communities like Tribals, Gujaratis and CKP community. Later the Zoroastrians arrived too. It was frequented by Arab travellers. By the 1490s, the Portuguese established their influence on the region. The region was under De Facto control of Portuguese from circa 1495 to 1540. Before this, it was under weak administration of Sultan of Gujarat. The Maratha Conquest of Thane and Vasai caused great damage to their influence as well as dominance over the region. The Inquisition established at Goa and other Portuguese Colonies fueled this change of power. During their reign, Portuguese built a small church to convert people to Christianity. This plan backfired and caused great discontent among people. The church fell in ruins and was destroyed before 1940. Dahanu enjoyed good treatment from Marathas and relatively low taxes. In 1818, with fall of Maratha Empire, it went under British rule. An unnamed officer was assassinated in the town by villagers over some dispute in the 1870s. Its details are unknown.

(Information dated 7/4/13.) Laxmi Narayan Temple Laxmi Narayan Temple is in Dahanu Gaon. This temple is from Peshwa Era. It belongs to the Karandikar family. It is open to all. The temple has wooden carved Pillars on which the \\"Sabha Mandap\\" stands. Geography Dahanu is located at . It has an average elevation of 9.89 metres. To the west of the town is the coast of the Arabian sea while the east is lined with the Sahyadri ranges. This combination has made Dahanu a tourist destination. Sprawling Chickoo wadis (farms), rose gardens, salt pans are among the other things that dot the landscape. The Dahanu beach is an extensive 15 km stretch lined by coconut and Saru (casuarina equisetifolia) trees. This is mostly crowded on the weekend when people from the metropolitan city of Mumbai come to visit as it is a short commute. The other days life is very laid back and the beach does not see much tourist crowd except inhabitants of Dahanu. There are horse and weekend fairs on the beach. =Climate= Residential Dahanu is a good residential location. Very good schools and colleges are located here. Among them Shirin Dinyar Irani Learners Academy is well Known for Sport and innovative activities.St Mary's High school is the popular school with about 4000 students studying from nursery to class X . Transportation  State transport buses (Maharashtra State Transport Corporation) and Auto rickshaws are the general mode of transport in and around the town. The National Highway NH8 runs through the taluka near Charoti, around 25 km east of the Dahanu town. Dahanu has its own railway station, Dahanu Road. It lies on the Western line of the Mumbai Suburban Railway network. It is the northern limit (terminal station) of the Suburban local train network, although the track continues north to Gholvad and beyond.Regular local trains & Memu are available for Churchgate, Dadar, Borivali & Virar, & also Panvel. There are also direct express trains from Dahanu which connects it with cities like Mumbai, Surat, Pune, Ahmedabad, Goa, Trivandrum, Bhuj, Jaipur, Jodhpur, Jamnagar, Delhi, Amritsar, Firozpur, Porbunder.

Parnaka(Dahanu Beach) Demographics India census, Dahanu has a population of 50,287. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. Dahanu has an average literacy rate of 71%: male literacy is 77% and, female literacy is 64%. In Dahanu, 13% of the population is under 6 years of age. Among minority languages, Gujarati is spoken by 34.43% of the population and Hindi by 19.80%. Population of Dahanu Taluka Adivasis(Warlis, Dubla,Dhodi), Bhandari, Machhi, Agri(Mangela) and Bari community people dominate the population of the town with significant amount of Parsis and Iranis;Jains,Muslims and Gujaratis. This makes Dahanu a rich town by itself compared to neighboring taluka of Palghar. In spite of a tradition of resistance, the indigenous Warlis have today become poor marginal farmers or migrant labourers barely surviving from year to year. While their narratives and consciousness come from a history of police brutality, exploitation by landlords, moneylenders and liquor contractors and from their continuous struggle for land rights and access to the forests, they are today forced into practicing settled subsistence agriculture. Moreover, categorized as backward and primitive, their culture, heritage and ecological understanding has come under attack. They now live on the margins of industrial and urban areas on the fringes of their slowly eroding forest lands.

It was opened in March 2001 and serves patients from the Royal Borough of Greenwich and the London Borough of Bexley. The hospital was built to accommodate the services previously provided at Greenwich District Hospital and Brook General Hospital, and is a Private Finance Initiative hospital. It is managed by the Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust. History The hospital's name originates from the Queen Elizabeth Military Hospital, which occupied the site from 1977 until its closure in 1995, and was named after Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother (who opened the hospital on 1 November 1978). The military hospital was built on the site of the former Shrapnel Barracks and was a replacement for the Royal Herbert Hospital in Shooters Hill and Queen Alexandra Military Hospital. A new hospital was procured under a Private Finance Initiative contract to replace the military hospital and to accommodate services previously provided at Greenwich District Hospital and Brook General Hospital in 1998. The new hospital was built by Skanska at a cost of ¬£84 million and opened in March 2001, being officially opened by the Queen on 11 December that year. In July 2012, Andrew Lansley, Secretary of State for Health, announced that the South London Healthcare Trust, formed in 2009 was to go into special measures and become the first Trust to have an independent Administrator appointed. The Trust was subsequently disbanded by Jeremy Hunt, Lansley's successor as Secretary of State for Health. On 1 October 2013 it was transferred to Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust on the disestablishment of South London Healthcare NHS Trust. Following power cuts, water shortages and floods the trust applied to the Independent Trust Finance Facility, part of the Department of Health, for ¬£48 million to repair the hospital in June 2016. It stated that \\"The infrastructure issues arise from unresolved legacy problems with the 60 year PFI agreement between the Meridian Hospital Company and the now dissolved Greenwich Health Authority, and derive from failures in specification and design standards, cost cutting at construction and contract terms that give the present trust limited redress against defects arising from the initial design and installation.\\" The application was approved in November 2017. In April 2018, following the January 2018 liquidation of Carillion, renewed concern about privatised provision of services at Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust prompted a petition, supported by the trade union GMB and local MP Matthew Pennycook, to bring 'soft' facilities services back in-house. Criticisms In February 2017, the South London Critical Care Network reviewed the hospital's intensive care department and found a complete lack of medical leadership. Care for patients across the trust could be affected because of issues with the critical care service. It was suggested that \\"younger fitter patients with single organ failure\\" would not be admitted to intensive care until they developed multiorgan failure because of pressures on bed availability. Only 3.5 full- time equivalent consultants were in post, with staff working locum shifts to fill gaps. \\"There was no ownership of the care of deteriorating patients in the wider hospital.\\" Ear nose and throat surgeons in Lewisham would not go to Woolwich, so patients needing tracheostomy had to be sent to Lewisham for their operation.

The castle, which was constructed between 1926 and 1929, was the home and laboratory of John Hays Hammond, Jr. He was an inventor who was a pioneer in the study of remote control and held over four hundred patents. The building is composed of modern and 15th-, 16th-, and 18th-century architectural elements and sits on a rocky cliff overlooking Gloucester Harbor. At present, the castle operates as the Hammond Castle Museum, displaying Hammond's collection of Roman, medieval, and Renaissance artifacts as well as exhibits about his life and inventions. The Great Hall contains a large pipe organ which has been used for concerts and recordings by many famous organists including Richard Ellsasser and Virgil Fox. Unfortunately, as of 2004, the organ is no longer functional. Tours are both guided and self- guided. Visitors may explore ten living areas (including a dining room, library, study, exhibit rooms, kitchen, and guest bedrooms), an inner courtyard, the northern towers and the Great Hall. History and Development John Hays Hammond Jr. engaged the Boston, Massachusetts architectural firm of Allen & Collens in 1923 to design Hammond's dream residence, a medieval style castle. The original castle was to be a tower house built on his father's Lookout Hill compound.Allen & Collens. Blueprint. 18 November 1923 Hammond's close friend, Leslie Buswell, who would soon begin construction on his own nearby home, Stillington Hall, warned Hammond he was trying to recreate Chartres Cathedral, almost matching the 121' high nave of the cathedral. In 1924, Hammond called for a more modest redesign which would reduce the height of the structure from 120' to 87' and a footprint of 43' by 30', but maintain the tower house style.Allen & Collens. Blueprint. 25 March 1925 After being ordered from the Lookout Hill property by his parents, Hammond moved to purchase a new site a mile to the south near Norman's Woe Reef. A complete redesign was developed which resulted in a shorter castle (81') but larger footprint (142' by 70').Allen & Collens.

The school is situated north of Hackney Central on the A102. It is a few hundred metres west of Homerton University Hospital. It lies in the parish of St James, Clapton. Admissions There are 900 pupils in the school. As Clapton Girls Technology College, the school was amongst the top 5% of schools that had improved nationally. More than half the pupils that attend are eligible for free school meals and under a third have special educational needs. More than 50 languages are spoken at the school and 70% of the pupils hold English as an additional language. History The school is located in Laura Place, on the site occupied by Newcome's School, a fashionable boys' school, from the early 18th century until 1815, and occupied after 1825 by the London Orphan Asylum. =Grammar school= On 21 September 1906 the County Secondary School for Girls, South Hackney, opened on Cassland Road in Hackney. In May 1916 it moved to Laura Place and changed its name to Clapton County Secondary School for Girls. In September 1939, owing to the outbreak of the Second World War, the school was evacuated to Bishop's Stortford in Hertfordshire.Clapton Girls' Academy school history. Retrieved 22 April 2020. In 1947 the school was renamed the John Howard School, after the 18th century prison reformer John Howard, and had around 450 girls. The school motto Possunt Quia Posse Videntur, commonly translated as \\"they can because they think they can\\", was adopted in the 1950s, and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother paid a visit to the school in 1966. =Comprehensive= In 1977 the school absorbed Clapton Park School, a secondary modern school with 1,000 girls on Chelmer Road in Homerton, and adopted the motto Wisdom and Togetherness. It became a comprehensive school for girls aged 11-16. In 1999 the school was awarded Technology College status and changed its name to Clapton Girls Technology College. The former Clapton Park School, located off Glyn Road near Homerton University Hospital, has since been turned into flats. In June 2008 Clapton Girls Technology College achieved an \\"outstanding\\" Ofsted report. Following a subject inspection in December 2006, the Mathematics Department was also deemed to be \\"outstanding\\". SATs and GCSE results improved significantly after the school became a Technology College in 1999. The school also became a Leading Edge Partnership school, and its leadership and management were also recognised in an Investors in People assessment in 2007. The school site was transformed under the Building Schools for the Future programme, with new and refurbished buildings, as well as landscaped grounds. The school received many awards in recognition of the education delivered, including Artsmark Gold and Inclusion Quality Mark, and the status of Healthy Schools and International Schools. The Clapton Girls Technology College sixth form opened in 2007. From September 2010 it has operated in collaboration with the sixth form at Our Lady's Convent Roman Catholic High School, giving the opportunity for an increased course offer. =Academy= On 1 September 2011 the school formally gained academy status and changed its name to Clapton Girls' Academy.

This type of arrangement originated in the European investment management industry, most notably with the SICAV (an open- ended collective investment). The SICAV model was copied for the UK Open-ended investment company (OEIC) and offshore fund models. Advantages The umbrella fund structure makes it cheaper for investors to move from one sub- fund to another and saves the investment manager costs relating to regulatory duplication. An umbrella fund can also be set up to provide retirement, death and other benefits to members of a participating employer. In such a fund there are several participating employers who enjoy more or less the same benefits and the fund is managed by professional trustees. They cut the cost by saving on maintenance and management fees and sometimes take advantage of reduced tax rates.

It is composed of three reference points on the celestial sphere: * P is the Celestial Pole (either North or South). It is a fixed point. * Z is the observer's zenith, or their position on the celestial sphere. * X is the position of a celestial body, such as the sun, moon, a planet, or a star. The position of Z or X is described via its declination‚Äîthe angular distance north or south of the equator (corresponding to its latitude)‚Äîand the hour angle‚Äîthe angle between its meridian and the Greenwich meridian (corresponding to its longitude). If the observer knows the angles subtended by P, Z, and X, they can calculate their position on the globe. By measuring the angle of the celestial body in the sky, the observer can get the local hour angle (LHA) of X, which is the angle subtended at P between Z and X (the angle between the Z and X's meridians) and calculate the longitude by subtracting from the Greenwich hour angle of the celestial body. Finding the latitude requires measuring the vertical angle (altitude) of X from the horizon using a sextant, the declination of X from a reference book, and a set of sight reduction Tables. The sun, moon, and planets move relative to the celestial sphere, but the only the stars' hour angles change with the rotation of the earth, completing a full 360 degrees every solar day.

The series is published by the US branch of Oxford University Press and is currently in its third edition. Originally conceived as a trade children's series, the books quickly found fans among classroom teachers; in response to the prompting of educators Oxford University Press developed ancillary teaching materials to accompany the series. Branded as 'alternatives to traditional textbooks' the series is regularly used in both public and private schools, usually in middle school classes. The books are all written in a personal tone, as if the author were a storyteller. The texts have been released to ample praise by teachers, home-schoolers, students, and many others. The series has won the James A. Michener Award in Writing and the Parent's Choice Gold Award.

The series has sold millions of copies and was accepted as a textbook in several U.S. states. David McCullough, a Pulitzer Prize-winning author of history books, praised A History of US before a U.S. Senate subcommittee hearing in 2005. Although it has received positive reviews from most people, some conservative critics have alleged that the works are politically-biased. A series of reviews in 2000‚Äì2001 in The Textbook Letter, a publication of the Textbook League, criticized various aspects of the first two books of A History of US. In a review of volume 2, Making Thirteen Colonies: 1600‚Äì1740, Alice Whealey noted many claims regarding the history of Western civilization as erroneous, focusing on republicanism, Moorish Spain, and Abrahamic religious stories presented as fact. Also regarding volume 2, Earl Hautala wrote that Hakim's inclusion of the Bible stories of Abraham and Moses is unjustified and incorrect from both a Biblical and a non-Biblical perspective.

It operates two free-to-air television channels on the Freeview platform and three 24-hour radio networks through terrestrial radio and Sky. The radio stations, AM936, Chinese Radio FM 99.4 and Chinese Radio FM 104.2, broadcast a combination of Hong Kong and Chinese programmes, and local music, parenting and talkback shows. In December 2005, the company claimed to have 11,500 subscribers across the country for its seven channels of Chinese, Taiwanese and Hong Kong programmes. In 2009, the company claimed 20,000 people received its World TV subscriber magazine. Mediakit] World TV's largest shareholder is Taiwanese resident Fun-nu Tsai with a 19 percent stake; chief executive Henry Ho owns 15 percent of the company and 11 other investors also have shares. The company's income is now evenly shared between advertising and subscription fees. History =2000-2004= Winston Peters was interviewed by World TV in 2002. World TV launched in June 2000 to take advantage of the infrastructure and viewing quality of the Sky TV digital platform that had been launched the year before. Through its ongoing partnership with Sky, it has continued to provide entertainment, educational and cultural programming to new migrants, New Zealand-born Chinese New Zealanders and other speakers and learners of standard Mandarin throughout the country. The company's mission has been to help new generations of Asian New Zealanders retain their language and cultural identity through quality programming, up-to-date information, imported entertainment and local community news. World TV attracted the attention of other media in 2002, for an interview by Rod Peng on the Face to Face programme with New Zealand First leader Winston Peters. Peters claimed most migrants from the past 30 years would agree the volume of new migrants coming into the country could be a cause of \\"discord, violence and racism\\". Peters also used the appearance to accuse other media of misrepresenting him as anti-Asian, because of what he called an unprofessional focus on emotions rather than facts. He argued he was instead an advocate for new migrants being settled, employed and integrated in small numbers. Peng described Peters as a \\"very capable politician\\" with a \\"very big communication problem\\". Between November 2003 and December 2004, Touch China TV also made an attempt to target Chinese-speaking audiences with a two-hour afternoon slot on music channel C4. A University of Otago study put the station's closure down to its failure to combine local content and Chinese programming in a way that gave it a point of difference to transnational broadcasters geared at new English-as-second-language migrants.Voci, P.

In 2004, it set up wholly owned subsidiary Chinese Voice Broadcasting to operate the stations on a day-to-day basis. In 2006, World TV added three channels to serve Korean and Japanese language communities. In August 2007, CTV8, the first 24-hour free-to-air Chinese television channel, joined the service - initially as an analogue channel and later as part of the Freeview line-up. English-language television channel TV9 began broadcasting on Freeview in February 2012, combining imported programmes with simulcasts of Chinese Radio shows. Chief executive Henry Ho said the introduction of specialist English- language broadcasting was a reflection of growing demand for information about Asia, strengthening trading and cultural ties between Asia and New Zealand, and New Zealanders becoming increasingly interested in Asia. The Chinese media market is very competitive, despite the closure of several Asian media outlets.Yang, L.

Biography He was born and received his musical education in Naples and began to compose operas at the age of 20. His early operas were produced in the theatres of Naples, Florence, Rome, Milan, and Venice. In 1735 he was invited to St. Petersburg together with a big Italian opera troupe, and became the maestro di cappella (Kapellmeister) to Empress Anne Ioanovna and later Empress Elizaveta Petrovna. In the winter operas were usually given in a wing of the Zimniy Dvorets (the Winter Palace), and in the summer time in the Theatre of Letniy Sad in the Summer Garden. His La forza dell'amore e dell'odio was the first Italian opera performed in Russia. It was staged in 1736 as –°–∏–ª–∞ –ª—é–±–≤–∏ –∏ –Ω–µ–Ω–∞–≤–∏—Å—Ç–∏ (Sila lyubvi i nenavisti - The Power of Love and Hatred) with a supplement to the Russian translation by Vasily Trediakovsky printed as a booklet. This was the first opera libretto printed in Russian.Some sources provide an arguable information that this opera was actually performed in Russian by the Russian singers. This was followed by Semiramide (Il finto Nino, overo La Semiramide riconosciuta) in 1737, Artaserse in 1738, Seleuco with Russian translation by Sumarokov, premiered in Moscow 1744, Scipione with Russian translation by Adam Olsufiev, in St. Petersburg 1745, Mitridate in 1747, and others. The majority of the operas he wrote in Russia were to Italian libretti. However, in 1755 Araja composed –¶–µ—Ñ–∞–ª –∏ –ü—Ä–æ–∫—Ä–∏—Å (Tsefal i Prokris ‚Äì Cephalus and Prokris), an opera in three acts to the Russian libretto by Alexander Sumarokov after the Metamorphoses by Ovid. It was staged at St. Petersburg on March 7, OS February 27, 1755 with effective sets by Giuseppe Valeriani. This was the first opera with Russian singers. This opera was a great success, and Araja received 100 half-imperialsHalf-imperial was a coin equal to 5 rubles in gold. and a luxurious sable coat valued at 500 rubles as a gift from Empress Elizaveta Petrovna. The opera was re-staged at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg on June 14, 2001. His next two operas were premiered in different Russian towns: Amor prigioniero in Oranienbaum in 1755, and Iphigenia in Tauride in Moscow in 1758. In 1759 Araia returned to Italy, but was recalled for the coronation of Tsar Peter III in 1762. He left soon after in the wake of Peter's overthrow by Catherine the Great. His last compositions were the oratorio La Nativita di Gesu and the opera La Cimotea. He died in Bologna sometime between 1762 and 1770.

Its history remains uncertain because of a lack of contemporary sources. The territory's status is subject to scholarly debate; some modern historians describe it as an independent polity that was annexed either around 833 or 870 by the Principality of Moravia, while others say that it was under influence of the neighbouring West Slavs from Moravia from its inception. Background Modern-day Slovakia was dominated for centuries by Germanic peoples, including the Quadi and the Langobards or Lombards, who were there until the middle of the 6th century. A new material culture characterized by handmade pottery, cremation burials and small, square, sunken huts that typically featured a corner stone oven appeared in the plains along the Middle Danube around that time. The new culture, with its \\"spartan and egalitarian\\" nature, sharply differed from the earlier archaeological cultures of Central Europe. According to Barford, a report by the Byzantine historian Procopius is the first certain reference to Early Slav groups inhabiting parts of present-day Slovakia. Procopius wrote that an exiled Lombard prince named Hildigis mustered an army, \\"taking with him not only those of the Lombards who had followed him, but also many of the Sclaveni\\"Procopius: History of the Wars (7.35.19.), pp. 461‚Äì463. in the 540s. The nomadic Avars, who arrived from the Eurasian steppes, invaded the Carpathian Basin and subjugated the local inhabitants in the second half of the 6th century. Thereafter, Slavic groups inhabiting areas around the core regions of the Avar Khaganate paid tribute to the Avars. The khaganate experienced a series of internal conflicts in the 630s. According to the Chronicle of Fredegar, the \\"Slavs who are known as Wends\\" rebelled against the Avars and elected a Frankish trader named Samo as their king in the early 7th century. Samo's realm, which emerged in the northern or northwestern regions of the Carpathian Basin, existed for more than three decades. It disintegrated soon after its founder's death and Avar control of the region was restored. The Avar Khaganate collapsed around 803 as a result of several successful military campaigns launched by the Franks against it. The fall of the Khaganate contributed to the rise of new polities among the Slavs in the region. The shift in political control was accompanied by changes in military strategy and equipment. According to Curta, swords and other items of the \\"Blatnica-Mikulƒçice horizon\\" show \\"a shift from the mounted combat tactics typical of nomadic warfare to heavy cavalry equipment\\", and the development of a local elite in the regions to the north of the river Danube and the Great Hungarian Plain in the early 9th century. Sources Modern sculpture of Pribina in Nitra The remains of a 9th-century fortress covering , the age of which has not been determined, were unearthed in the centre of Nitra. Beeby writes that the fortress belongs to the \\"Great Moravian period\\". According to Steinh√ºbel, the fortress may have been named after the river Nitra, which flows below the hill upon which it stood. Archaeological research shows that a settlement inhabited by blacksmiths, goldsmiths and other artisans developed at the fortress. An extensive network of settlements emerged around it in the 9th century. The main source of information about the polity now known as the Principality of Nitra is the Conversion of the Bavarians and Carantanians, a document compiled around 870 to promote the interests of the Archdiocese of Salzburg in Pannonia. The manuscripts state that \\"one Pribina\\", who had been \\"driven across the Danube by Mojmir, duke of the Moravians\\", fled to Radbod, Margrave of Pannonia (c. 833‚Äì856) in East Francia around 833. Radbod introduced him to King Louis the German, who ordered that Pribina should be \\"instructed in the faith and baptized\\". According to a sentence in three of the eleven extant manuscripts of the Conversion, Archbishop Adalram of Salzburg (r. 821‚Äì836) consecrated a church for Pribina \\"on his estate at a place over the Danube called Nitrava\\" at an unspecified date. Modern historians debate whether this sentence was part of the original text or was only a marginal note which was interpolated into the main text in the 12th century. Scholarly debates: the status and location of Pribina's Nitrava According to a widely accepted interpretation of the Conversion, Pribina was initially the ruler of an independent polity which was centered on Nitra. For instance, Barford writes that Pribina \\"was apparently prince of Nitra\\". Pribina's assumed realm is described as the \\"first demonstrable Slavic state north of the middle Danube\\" by Lukaƒçka. Lukaƒçka also says that Pribina had a retinue and that most its members \\"certainly descended from the former tribal aristocracy\\" but some of them \\"could have come from the free strata of the mass of the people\\". Richard Marsina says that it \\"can hardly be unambiguously decided whether Pribina was a prince of a greater tribe or of two or three smaller joined tribes\\". He adds that Pribina may have belonged to the second or third generation of the heads of this polity, which emerged in the valleys of the rivers Hron, Nitra, and V√°h. Scholars who write that Pribina was an independent ruler also say that his principality was united with Moravia after he was exiled from his homeland. Kirschbaum and Steinh√ºbel add that the forced unification of the two principalitiesMojmir's Moravia and Pribina's Nitraunder Mojmir gave rise to the empire of Great Moravia. According to Marsina, the inhabitants of Pribina's principality who \\"definitely were aware of their difference from the Moravian Slavs\\" preserved their \\"specific consciousness\\" even within Great Moravia, which contributed to the development of the common consciousness of the ancestors of the Slovak people. Pribina was not an independent ruler, but Duke Mojmir of Moravia's lieutenant in Nitra, according to Vlasto. He says that Pribina's attempts to achieve independence led to his exile. The identification of \\"Nitra\\" with \\"Nitrava\\" is not universally accepted by scholars. Imre Boba and Charles Bowlus are among the scholars who challenged that identification. The Hungarian historian Imre Boba says, the Humanist historian Johannes Aventinus wrongly identified Nitrava (granted along with Brno and Olomouc by Louis the German, according to Aventinus) with Nitra, because Nitrava was in \\"Hunia or Avaria\\", to the south of Bavaria. He also says that the Latin term \\"locus Nitrava\\" could not refer to a city. According to his view, none of the modern names of Nitra (Slovak Nitra, Hungarian Nyitra and German Neutra) could develop from a \\"Nitrava\\" form. Boba's linguistic approach is not compliant with onomastic research which suggests that Nitra was the primary form of the place name and \\"Nitrava\\" is only the secondary name; both forms were recorded already in the 9th century. The Czech historian Du≈°an T≈ôe≈°t√≠k, who says that the association of Nitra with Nitrava cannot be challenged, writes that the latter form developed from the name of the Nitra River, which fits well into the system of Indo-European toponyms; other rivers with similar names are not known. Charles Bowlus also rejects the identification of Nitrava with Nitra, because the latter town was only annexed by Moravia during the reign of Svatopluk, years after Pribina's expulsion, according to a letter that Archbishop Theotmar of Salzburg and his suffragans wrote around 900. According to T≈ôe≈°t√≠k, the content of the letter can be explained as a reasonable mistake of its compilators who knew that the territory was in the past a separate realm different from Moravia. Duchy of Nitra (Kingdom of Hungary) Duchy\\" (including its parts around Nitra) within the Kingdom of Hungary in the 11th century. The Duchy or Ducatus is the denomination for territories occasionally governed separately by members (dukes) of the √Årp√°d dynasty within the Kingdom of Hungary in the 11th-12th centuries. The symbol of the ducal power was a sword, while the royal power was represented by the crown. Modern historians do not share a consensual view on the origins of the Duchy or territorial units administered by members of the royal family within the medieval Kingdom of Hungary. Gy√∂rgy Gy√∂rffy writes that the Ducatus or \\"Duchy\\" developed from the command over the Kabars and other ethnic groups which joined the federation of the Hungarian tribes. According to his opinion, this command was initially, even before the Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin around 895, bestowed upon the heir to the supreme head of the Hungarian tribal federation, in accordance with the customs of the Turkic peoples of the Eurasian steppes. Therefore, Gy√∂rffy continues, the crown prince's command over these ethnic groups transformed, in the course of the 10th century, into his authority over the territories where they settled. On the other hand, Gyula Krist√≥, who rejected Gy√∂rffy's theory, writes that the Duchy only came into being when King Andrew I granted one- third of his kingdom to his younger brother, B√©la around 1048. He cites the Illuminated Chronicle which clearly states that this was the \\"first division of the kingdom\\". The practise of dynastical divisions of the kingdom's territories commenced in 1048 when King Andrew I of Hungary conceded one-third of the counties of his kingdom in appanage to his brother, B√©la. The territories entrusted to the members of the ruling dynasty were organized around two or three centers and the duchy made up one-third of the kingdom's territory. B√©la's autonomous duchy (ducatus) extended from the Morava river to the border of Transylvania. It was composed of two parts: Nitra and neighboring Bihar, extending from the upper Tisa in the north to the K√∂r√∂s river in the south, from the Transylvanian borders in the east to the Tisa river in the west. B√©la was a sovereign lord of his demesne. This is testified by ducal half-denarii - they had the words BELA DVX engraved on them - as well as by the previously mentioned Hungarian Chronicle. B√©la probably had the coins struck at his ducal seat in Nitra and new fortifications were added to the Nitra castle. At that time, Duke B√©la was the heir presumptive, but later King Andrew I fathered a son, Solomon. The birth of Solomon gave rise to conflicts between the two brothers that resulted in a civil war. The civil war stopped in 1060 when B√©la defeated his brother and ascended the throne.Mikul√°s Teich, Dusan Kovac and Martin D. Brown: Slovakia in History, Cambridge University Press, 2011, p. 26 When B√©la died in 1063, his sons G√©za, Ladislaus and Lampert had to flee from the Kingdom of Hungary, because their cousin, Solomon (who had already been crowned in 1057) returned followed by the troops his brother-in-law, Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor provided him. Shortly afterwards, King Boles≈Çaw II of Poland provided military assistance to the three dukes thus they could return to the kingdom. However, the parties wanted to avoid the emerging civil war and therefore they made an agreement on 20 January 1064 in Gy≈ër. Under the agreement, the three brothers: G√©za, Ladislaus and Lampert accepted the rule of their cousin, King Solomon who conceded them their father's former duchy (the Ducatus).Mikul√°s Teich, Dusan Kovac and Martin D. Brown: Slovakia in History, Cambridge University Press, 2011, p. 26-28 Following a nine-year-long period of cooperation, conflicts arose among the king and the dukes, and the latter could expand their power over the larger part of the kingdom and the king had to flee to the western borders. In 1074, the eldest duke, G√©za was proclaimed king, while King Solomon could maintain his rule only in some western counties of the kingdom. Following his ascension to the throne, King G√©za confirmed his brothers, Ladislaus and Lampert in the possession of the Duchy. When G√©za died on 25 April 1077, his partisans proclaimed Ladislaus king who could enforce King Solomon to accept his rule in 1081. During Ladislaus' reign, the Duchy may have governed by his brother, Duke Lampert, but it has not been proven yet.Mikul√°s Teich, Dusan Kovac and Martin D. Brown: Slovakia in History, Cambridge University Press, 2011, p. 27-28 The Ducatus was revived in 1095‚Äì1096, when King Coloman of Hungary made an agreement with his brother, Prince √Ålmos, who had been debating Coloman's right to the throne following the death of King Ladislaus I, and conceded the territories in appanage to him. In 1105, Duke √Ålmos rebelled against his brother and sought military assistance from the Holy Roman Empire and Poland, but his troops were defeated by the king shortly afterwards. In 1107, Duke √Ålmos made a pilgrimage to the Holy Land, and taking advantage of his absence, King Coloman occupied the territories of the Duchy. When Duke √Ålmos returned from the Holy Land and realised that his territories had been incorporated into the royal domains, he escaped to the court of Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor. Upon the duke's request, the Emperor laid siege to Bratislava. However, King Coloman sought the assistance of Duke Boleslaw III of Poland, who attacked Bohemia. In November, the emperor made a peace with Coloman, who let his brother come back to his court, but the Duchy and his ducal power was not to be restored. Shortly afterwards, Coloman set up the bishopric of Nitra in one of the seats of the Ducatus.

He is a fellow at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv. Between 2009 and 2011 Arad served as the National Security Advisor to the Prime Minister of Israel, and the head of the Israeli National Security Council. Between 1999 and 2009 Arad was the Founding Director of the Institute for Policy and Strategy at the Herzliya Interdisciplinary Center (IDC). Arad established and chaired the annual Herzliya Conference, Israel's principal international policy conference, convening Israeli and international leaders, policy-makers and most senior experts in the field of national security, broadly defined. Arad was a Professor at the Lauder School of Government, Diplomacy and Strategy. Between 1997 and 1999 Arad was foreign policy advisor to Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu on secondment from the Mossad, in which he served for more than two decades, culminating in his tenure as Director of Research (Intelligence). Arad had been serving as advisor to the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. He was also the Founding Chair of The Atlantic Forum of Israel. Arad has been a critic of the Iraq War and former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, arguing that the energy spent there should have been shifted towards dealing with the nuclear program of Iran.Katz, Yaakov. \\"Stuck in Iraq, can the US now take Iran?\\", The Jerusalem Post. Following his NSC term, Arad was expected to be the new Israeli ambassador to London, but instead he returned to academia. History =Early life= Arad was born in Tiberias in 1947. In 1955 he followed his family to France, where they spent two years, and he travelled with his family to Mexico in 1963. While in Mexico, he studied economics and anthropology at the University of the Americas. Three years later, he returned to Israel to carry out his military service in the Israel Air Force. =Education= In 1971, Arad earned a bachelor's degree in history and international relations from Tel Aviv University. He was subsequently awarded a Fulbright Fellowship for advanced studies at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs, where he earned an M.A. degree (1973) in public administration and international relations, and a Ph.D. degree (1975) in international relations from the Politics Department.Princeton University Graduate Alumni Index, 1839-1998 His Ph.D. dissertation, World Energy Interdependence and the Security of Supply was supervised by Professors Richard Ullman and Edward Morse. =Professional career= Arad became a Professional Staff Member with the Hudson Institute in 1972, working under Herman Kahn and Donald Brennan. At Hudson, he carried out policy work on nuclear strategy, arms control, energy and security. Arad returned to Israel in 1975 and was offered positions with the Mossad and with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He chose to join the Mossad, where he spent most of his professional career. He served in two divisions, one of which was the Research (Intelligence) Division, which he eventually headed (at the rank equivalent to Major General). At the Mossad, he also dealt with foreign liaison and his assignments also included posts abroad, acquiring the reputation, in the words of Andrew Marshall, the Director of the Pentagon's Office of Net Assessment, \\"a top global defence strategist\\". Intending to retire from Mossad in 1997, Arad was elected in 1996 as Director of the Jaffe Center for Strategic Studies at Tel Aviv University, now the Institute for National Security Studies.http://www.inss.org.il/about.php?cat=46‚àà=0 However, at the request of Prime Minister Netanyahu, Arad remained in government to serve as the Prime Minister's Foreign Policy Advisor, a position he held through 1999. Concurrently with his ongoing academic activities, Arad has been advising the Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee. He has also been active in advancing Israel's relations with Euro-Atlantic community. In 2000, Arad founded the EU-Israel Forum and led it through 2003. In 2004, he established the Atlantic Forum of Israel which seeks to enhance Israel's relations with the Atlantic Alliance. Arad (second from right) in September 2009, seated next to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In April 2009, Arad was appointed National Security Advisor to the Prime Minister of Israel, Benjamin Netanyahu, and Head of the Israeli National Security Council. While in government Arad fought for the NSC to be strengthened and upgraded, knowing it would be an uphill battle. His functional and geographical proximity to the Prime Minister, his personal relationship with Netanyahu, and his presence in real-time decision-making situations gave the new NSC a real role. Arad played a key role in fostering U.S.-Israel relations. His departure was marred by allegations about a leak on civilian nuclear energy. Arad was officially cleared by the deputy attorney general of any leak, and the Comptroller General, in his report about the National Security Council sided with Arad in his approach to the implementation of the National Security Act. In 2013 the French Government awarded Arad the distinction of Officer of the L√©gion d'honneur. =Academic career= In 1977, Arad took a sabbatical leave and carried out post-doctoral research at the Center for Strategic Studies at Tel Aviv University. Arad's co-authored volume, Sharing Global Resources, commissioned by the New York Council on Foreign Relations (with his wife, Ruth Arad and others), was published in 1979. After retiring from government in 1999, Arad lectured at Haifa University and in 2000 he joined the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya (IDC Herzliya), which became his academic home. At IDC, he established the Institute for Policy and Strategy and founded the Annual Herzliya Conference Series on the Balance of Israel's National Security. Modeled after prestigious international policy conferences and gatherings such as the World Economic Forum (Davos), the Munich Conference on Security Policy (Verkunde), the Trilateral Commission meetings, and the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) conferences, the Herzliya Conference soon became the principal policy event in Israel. In 2005, the Israeli Council on Higher Education conferred upon Arad the academic rank of Professor in recognition of his expertise and international reputation. In the course of his work at IDC Herzliya, Arad conceived of a path-breaking international policy project exploring the applications of risk management to national and international security policy. Involving a global group of scholars and coordinated at Yale University and the Eurasia Group, the project culminated in the book Managing Strategic Surprise: Lessons from Risk Management and Risk Assessment recently published by Cambridge University Press. Arad contributed a chapter on intelligence and surprise attack, in which he applied analytical tools of risk management to the integrative administration of national intelligence systems. The edited volume garnered academic and professional acclaim and has been portrayed as a \\"superb collection of our best thought leaders.\\" In 2013 Arad initiated, with the Technion‚Äôs Samuel Neaman Institute, the Israel‚Äôs Grand-Strategy forum which he chaired. The forum submitted its conclusions and recommendations to the President of the State of Israel in 2017.  Public activities  Arad held several public duties while out of his governmental positions: * 2005-2009: Board member, The Israeli Society for Excellence through Education; * 2011-2013: Chair, Center for Defence Studies; * 2007- : Board member, Center for Intelligence Heritage (Malam); * 2013 - : Board member, Yad David Ben Gurion Society; Personal Uzi Arad is married to Dr. Ruth Arad and is the father of Dr. Dorit Ben-Ami and Dr. Orna Arad.

Segregated portfolio assets comprise assets representing share capital, retained earnings, capital reserves, share premiums and all other assets attributable to or held within the segregated portfolio. Separation of liability Only the assets of each segregated portfolio are available to meet liabilities to creditors in respect of that segregated portfolio; where there are liabilities arising from a matter attributable to a particular segregated portfolio, the creditor may only have recourse to the assets attributable to that segregated portfolio. Under the laws of some jurisdictions, where the assets of a segregated portfolio are inadequate to meet that portfolio's obligations then a creditor may have recourse to the general assets of the SPC, but not those assets which belong to a different segregated portfolio. An SPC is technically a single legal entity and the segregated portfolios within the SPC will not be separate legal entities which are separate from the SPC, although for bankruptcy purposes they are treated as such. In some jurisdictions, separation of liability is achieved by different statutory mechanisms. For example, Barbados allows the formation of both ‚ÄúSegregated Cell Companies‚Äù and ‚ÄúCompanies with a Separate Account Structure‚Äù. The former are SPCs by another name. The latter separate liabilities by allowing a company to allocate assets and attendant liabilities to any number of separate accounts. In Nevis, similar provisions in the Insurance Ordinance 2004 allow insurers to establish ‚Äústatutory funds‚Äù to which they may allocate the risks of any insured who agrees to such allocation. The assets of a statutory fund are only available to meet liabilities in respect of business allocated to that fund. Formation SPCs originated in Guernsey and Delaware, but a number of other jurisdictions followed, and they can now be formed in Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Anguilla, Ireland (the Republic of), Mauritius, Jersey, the Isle of Man, Malta, Bahrain, Gibraltar and Samoa. Usage SPCs have several potential functions. They are mostly commonly used in the formation of collective investment schemes as umbrella funds and for the formation of captive insurance companies (typically a variation of a \\"rent-a-captive\\"). They are also sometimes used as asset holding vehicles (characteristically where each portfolio holds a single ship or aircraft) and they can also potentially be used in capital markets debt issuances. However, although growing in popularity SPCs still remain something of a niche product. Because of the relative ease of forming multiple offshore companies in most jurisdictions where SPCs are available for incorporation, and because it is uncertain how the concept of segregated portfolios (and thus no consequential cross-contamination of liabilities) would be treated in an onshore bankruptcy or by credit ratings agencies, many promoters still instead opt for the formation of multiple companies under a single holding company.  South Africa  Unlike most developed financial markets, there is no legal structure similar to segregated portfolio companies in South Africa. Rather, these companies, known locally as cell captive companies, are companies with different classes of shares, each class being issued to a different cell owner. Separation of assets and liabilities, known as ring-fencing, is achieved through contractual agreements, and given the lack of statutory structure there exists a theoretical risk that creditors may claim dues from cells other than those that are their debtors according to the arrangement agreed to. However, such a precedent has as yet not been set. In South Africa, there are seven long-term insurers and eleven short-term insurers registered to conduct cell captive insurance business, who manage more than 130 short- term and 50 long-term third-party cell captive insurance arrangements.FSB Discussion paper on third-party cell and similar arrangements See also * Offshore Financial Centres * Special-purpose entity * Special-purpose acquisition company * Special purpose private equity fund References Further reading * Nevis Statutory Funds ‚Äì Risk Segregation of a Different Kind, by Atlas Insurance Management Category:Offshore finance Category:Legal entities Category:Types of business entity Category:Venture capital firms ","title":"Segregated portfolio company"},{"id":"5073348","text":"Araia may refer to: *Araia, √Ålava, a town in √Ålava, Basque Country, Spain *Francesco Araja, also known as Francesco Araia *ARAIA, Associate of the (Royal) Australian Institute of Architects See also * Araya (disambiguation) ","title":"Araia"},{"id":"5073351","text":"Juan Gonz√°lez de Mendoza, O.S.A.

He joined the army but after some years resigned to enter the Order of Saint Augustine. He published his most famous text in 1585, Historia de las cosas m√°s notables, ritos y costumbres del gran reyno de la China. It was based on the journals of Miguel de Luarca, whose 1580 trip to Ming China provided a simple majority thereof. He never set foot in China, but spent two years in Mexico before returning to Spain. On 31 May 1593, he was appointed during the papacy of Pope Clement VIII as Bishop of Lipari. On 7 June 1593, he was consecrated bishop by Filippo Spinola, Cardinal-Priest of Santa Sabina, with Crist√≥bal Senmanat y Robuster, Bishop of Orihuela, and Lorenzo Celsi (bishop), Bishop of Castro del Lazio, serving as co- consecrators. On 24 May 1599, he resigned as Bishop of Lipari. On 7 May 1607, he was appointed during the papacy of Pope Paul V as Bishop of Chiapas. On 17 November 1608, he was appointed during the papacy of Pope Paul V as Bishop of Popay√°n. He served as Bishop of Popay√°n until his death on 14 February 1618.

He was the minister of Duddingston Kirk from 1805 to 1840. Life The youngest of eight children, Thomson was born in the manse at Dailly, Ayrshire, the fourth son of Mary Hay and her husband, Rev Thomas Thomson, the local parish minister of the Church of Scotland. He was educated at Dailly Parish School. From an early age, he displayed an aptitude for drawing and painting and, inspired by the Ayrshire countryside, developed a love for landscape painting. In 1791 he enrolled at the University of Glasgow to study law and theology, and in 1793 he transferred to the University of Edinburgh to study divinity. While there, he met many people who were prominent in Edinburgh artistic circles, including Walter Scott, and Alexander Nasmyth, the latter of whom who gave him art lessons. After graduating, Thomson returned to Ayrshire and was licensed as minister of the Church of Scotland, and subsequently ordained as minister of Dailly in 1800 in place of his father. In 1805 he was translated to Duddingston near Edinburgh and became the most famous minister of the local Kirk, remaining in the role until death in 1840. In 1814 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were John Playfair, Archibald Alison, and Sir David Brewster. Whilst at Duddingston a very fine portrait of him was painted by Robert Scott Lauder who married Thomson's daughter Isabella in 1833. Thomson died at Duddingston in 1840, having spent 41 years in the ministry. He was succeeded by Rev James Macfarlane. His grave in Duddingston churchyard is marked by a distinctive stone sarcophagus.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/21861/john-thomson Artistic aspects Thomson had a studio at the foot of the manse garden on the shore of Duddingston Loch. Later, this was replaced by Duddingston Tower, a structure designed for Duddingston Curling Society in 1825 by William Playfair. The Society used the ground floor as their clubhouse, and Thomson used the upper floor of the tower, known today as \\"Thomson's Tower\\", as his studio. The move to Duddingston allowed him to renew his acquaintances with men of influence in artistic circles and develop his art. Like his early teacher, Naysmith, Thomson believed in working outdoors, observing directly from nature. Influenced by the techniques of Rosa, Lorrain, Poussin, Raeburn and renowned English landscape artist Turner, he developed a broad Romantic style, and became a landscape artist with an established reputation. This allowed him to augment his small stipend and become quite wealthy through the sale of his paintings. In addition to Scott, Naysmith and Raeburn, Thomson was friendly with writer and fellow amateur artist, Thomas Dick Lauder, and such was Thomsons reputation that in 1818 he entertained Turner at his studio, who is said to have remarked of the outlook over the Loch: \\"By God sir, I envy you that piece of water.\\" https://www.lifestyle.scotsman.com/outdoors/justphenomenal_specific.cfm?articleid=223 Thomson went on to collaborate with Turner in producing engravings to illustrate Walter Scott's Provincial Antiquities and Picturesque Scenery of Scotland, published in 1826. Recognising his talent, Thomson's congregation nominated him to become a member of the Association of Artists in Edinburgh. He went on to receive honorary memberships of the Royal Institution for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts in Scotland and the Royal Scottish Academy. Family In 1801 he married Isabella Ramsay (1782-1809) and together they had a daughter Margaret (1806-1827).Grave of Rev Thomson, Duddingston Kirk Following Isabella's death he married Frances Ingram Spence (1779-1846) in 1813.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/21861/john-thomson His older brother was the antiquarian Thomas Thomson FRSE. Memorials Thomson's nephew Lochhart Thomson had installed a memorial stained glass window in 1903 in Duddingston Kirk. It stands immediately to the west of the pulpit. Anecdotes *In addition to being known for his landscape paintings, Thomson is often credited with giving rise to the famous Lowland Scots adage \\"We're a' Jock Tamson's bairns\\", which as early as 1847 was described as \\"an expression of mutual good fellowship very frequently heard in Scotland.\\" However, there is some evidence that it may predate John Thomson, and there is also a Scottish Gaelic version. *One version attributing the origin of the adage to Thomson is that his first wife died after they had five children, he then married a widow who already had five children, and this second marriage produced another four children. When his wife then made introductions to visitors and tried to explain which family the various children belonged to, Thomson would interrupt her with the statement that \\"They're a' Jock Thomson's bairns\\". It may also be accounted for by his general reputation for forgiveness and inclusiveness, for example his reputed disapproval of the excessive use of withdrawing communion tokens to exclude parishioners from taking communion.This might explain an already extant old saying being adopted to refer to him. *To ensure privacy to paint in his studio, Thomson named the Tower \\"Edinburgh\\", in order that casual visitors to the Manse could be informed by his staff that he was unavailable, as he had gone to \\"Edinburgh\\". *Duddingston Loch has a long historical connection with curling and skating and is the setting for the iconic painting, The Skating Minister, by Thomson's artistic acquaintance, Henry Raeburn. The subject of the painting is not Thomson however, but Robert Walker, minister of the Canongate Kirk.

In 1996 the hospital became part of The Royal Hospitals NHS Trust, later renamed Barts and The London NHS Trust. In 1998 the services previously carried out by the hospital were transferred to the Royal London Hospital. History The hospital was formed in 1942 by the amalgamation of two institutions founded in the mid-Victorian era. One of its origins lies in the Dispensary for Women and Children, founded in Bethnal Green in the East End of London by two Quaker sisters, Ellen and Mary Philips, in 1867. The following year it moved to premises in Hackney, re-focused on pediatrics, and was re-named the North Eastern Hospital for Children, opened by Princess Louise. The hospital continued to expand and a substantial new building was opened by Princess Beatrice in 1902. This organisation became the Queen's Hospital for Children in 1907. Scenes from the East London Hospital for Children The other main origin of the 1942 hospital was the East London Hospital for Children, founded by the newly married couple Sarah Maud Heckford and Dr. Nathaniel Heckford in 1868. They had met while assisting patients during the cholera epidemic in 1866. Elizabeth Garrett Anderson, the first English female doctor, was a visiting physician thereJo Manton, Elizabeth Garrett Anderson: England's First Woman Physician (Methuen, London 1965): 193-195. In 1932 it was re-named the Princess Elizabeth of York Hospital for Children. A new site, known as the Banstead Wood Country Hospital, opened in 1936. The Queen's Hospital for Children amalgamated with the Princess Elizabeth of York Hospital for Children to form the Queen Elizabeth Hospital for Children in 1942. The Shadwell site closed in 1963, the Bethnal Green site closed in 1996 and the Banstead site closed in 1998. Rydon Homes and Family Mosaic Housing Association started to redevelop the Bethnal Green site in 2014. A time capsule was discovered there in December 2014, containing newspapers, a catalogue of donors, a hymn sheet and a ribbon from the opening ceremony performed by Princess Beatrice in 1902. by August 2016, the redevelopment was complete, and 24 homes stood on the site of what had been the QE Hospital for Children.

Production The movie is a modern remake of Bizet's 1875 opera Carmen. It was shot entirely in Xhosa, and combines both music from the original opera with traditional African music conducted and directed by the British conductor, Charles Hazlewood. It takes place in the Cape Town township of Khayelitsha. U-Carmen was translated into Xhosa by Andiswa Kedama and Pauline Malefane, who also play Amanda and Carmen in the movie, respectively. The cast rehearsed for four weeks before they began shooting the film. The film's musical numbers were recorded live on the set without any additional dubbing. The film was Dornford-May's directorial debut. Also, none of the cast members had ever acted on film before. Plot summary The film begins when Nomakhaya arrives at a Cape Town police station, looking for police sergeant Jongikhaya. He is out on patrol, so she decides to return later to avoid being harassed by the other officers. Meanwhile, Carmen and Amanda are going to work at the cigarette factory. They pass in front of Jongikhaya's police vehicle and Carmen yells at him for parking there. Nomakhaya eventually finds Jongikhaya and gives him a ring that his dying mother sent him: she urges him to return to his village to see his mother before she dies. A flashback reveals that Jongikhaya has been disowned by his mother after he drowned his brother during an argument. Later, the bored police officers decide to go to the cigarette factory to see the girls. Carmen is piqued when Jongikhaya reads his Bible and ignores her. She flirts with him and throws a rose into his car. Later, the cigarette girls are watching TV when they see that a singing star, Lulamile Nkomo, from their township is returning to the area for a special concert. Pinki turns off the TV when Carmen is trying to watch the footage and a fight ensues. The police arrive to break up the fight; Jongikhaya takes Carmen into custody after she wounds Pinki with a knife. However, Carmen convinces Jongikhaya to let her go in exchange for her love and promises to meet him later at a local bar. Jongikhaya is demoted by Captain Gantana and confined to barracks for his role in the escape. Several days later, Carmen, Amanda, the cigarette factory workers, and Carmen's drug dealer friends eagerly await the arrival of Lulamile Nkomo at Bra Nkomo's bar. The police arrive to search for Carmen, but she hides. Jongikhaya also arrives, although he is treated with hostility by the factory girls and the drug traffickers until Carmen vouches for him. He declares his undying love for Carmen and she warns him again that she only belongs to herself. He also gives her his mother's ring. At the urging of Carmen, Jongikhaya quits his job and becomes a drug trafficker. However, one night during a smuggling operation, he becomes jealous when Carmen is friendly towards another man and starts a fight. The other drug traffickers beat him up and a furious Carmen declares that their relationship is over. Carmen returns the ring that he gave her. Jongikhaya is determined that Carmen will not forget him. He declares he will kill her if she rejects him. Carmen is scheduled to sing at Lulamile Nkomo's homecoming concert. Her friends warn her that Jongikhaya is in the audience. When Carmen tries to tell Jongikhaya that their relationship is over, he chases her outside the music venue and threatens her with a knife. Despite his ominous threat, Carmen refuses to take him back. Jongikhaya stabs her and is seized by members of the concert audience as she dies.

The bar mine's principal advantage is its long length, and therefore its trigger length. A typical anti-tank landmine is circular, and a vehicle's wheels or tracks, which make up only a small proportion of its total width, must actually press on the mine to activate it. To increase the probability of a vehicle striking the mine, the mine's effective trigger width must be increased. The bar mine's shape allows a 50% reduction in the number of mines in a minefield without reducing its effectiveness. It was reported that it would take 90 sappers 150 minutes to lay a 1,000 yard mine field consisting of 1,250 Mk 7 British anti-tank mines, weighing a total of 17 tonnes. By comparison, it would take 30 sappers 60 minutes to lay a 1,000 yard minefield consisting of 655 bar mines weighing a total of 7.2 tonnes.The History of Landmines, Mike Croll, The long mines can also be laid through a simple plough attached to the rear of a FV432 Armoured Personnel Carrier. Laying circular mines in similar fashion requires a far larger plough and more powerful towing vehicle. The bar mine laying FV432s were also usually fitted with launchers for the L10 Ranger Anti-Personnel Mine, to make subsequent clearing of the minefield by hand by enemy sappers more difficult; however, the L10 was withdrawn from service by March 1999, in line with several conventions regulating mines which have been agreed to by the United Kingdom. The bar mine is made of plastic, and cannot be detected by metal detectors. A metal plate is attached to bar mines which are intended to be subsequently recovered by friendly forces, usually for training purposes. A full width attack mine (FWAM) fuze and an anti-disturbance fuze are available for the bar mine; these are secured on the ends of the mine, adjacent to the pressure plate. If either is used, the mine must be laid by hand. A training version of the mine is bio-degradable, and consists of sand or peat in a cardboard casing. Service FV432 and plough minelayer The L9 Bar Mine entered British service in 1969. A number of sub-variants of the mine exist, designated L9A1 through L9A8. It was replaced as an anti-tank mine in British service (by the Shielder minelaying system) in 2010. The bar mine was used by small detachments of special forces of the British Army during the Gulf War in 1991. A number were captured from Kuwaiti Army stocks by the Iraqi Army in 1990, and subsequently used by them in the same conflict. It was reported that they disabled a number of M60 Patton tanks and other armoured vehicles belonging to the United States Marine Corps, even when these were fitted with mine-clearing ploughs. Unless the plough struck the mine squarely in the centre, the mine would often be rotated into a position in which it would pass between the tines of the plough, then blow up the track and front roller of the tank. The British Army has since been using bar mines simply as breaching frame charges, for instance to blow holes in tough compound walls in Afghanistan and Iraq.Engineer Review August 2008 Among other users have been Denmark, where it was introduced as the Pansermine M/75, with the mine plough towed by the M113 armored personnel carrier. In 1989 an electromagnetic FWAM fuse replaced the original fuse as Pansermine M/88. Both mines have since been taken out of use. Theft from MOD train In 2012, a parcel of forty bar mines being shipped by rail on a Ministry Of Defence (MOD) train from DMC Longtown to Oxfordshire disappeared while in transit. Twenty-eight were recovered promptly alongside the line near Warrington, but twelve (approximately 100 kg of RDX) were missing, Counter-terrorism officers together with the Royal Military Police led the enquiry. Five men were later jailed for their part in the theft and the missing explosives were recovered.

It is located in the municipality of Stari Grad. Today, Terazije has primarily function of the main transit square, surrounded by the important public buildings, cultural institutions, hotels, public monuments and parks. Though not classically shaped square, Terazije was historically important as the gathering spot and the former business and commercial center of Belgrade. With the Knez Mihailova Street, which extends to the northeast connecting directly Terazije and Belgrade Fortress, the square is one of the oldest and most recognizable ambience units of Belgrade. Due to its historical and cultural importance, Terazije was declared a protected spatial cultural-historical unit in January 2020.  Location  Terazije square Despite the fact that many Belgraders consider the Republic Square or Kalemegdan to be the city's centerpiece areas, Terazije is Belgrade's designated center. When street numbers are assigned to the streets of Belgrade, numeration begins from the part of the street closest to Terazije. Terazije itself is also a short street, connected by the King Milan Street, the main street in Belgrade, to the Slavija square, by the Nikola Pa≈°iƒá Square to the King Alexander Boulevard, the longest street in Belgrade, by Prizrenska street to the neighborhood of Zeleni Venac and further to New Belgrade, and by the Kolarƒçeva street to the Square of the Republic. The neighborhood also borders Andriƒáev Venac and Pioneers Park on the southeast, Park Aleksandrov on the south and neighborhood of Varo≈° Kapija on the west. A small, covered square of Bezistan connects it to the Nikola Pa≈°iƒá Square.  Etymology  With regard to the origin of the name Terazije, the historian and writer Milan ƒê. Miliƒáeviƒá wrote: \\"In order to supply Belgrade with water, the Turks built towers at intervals along the ƒëeriza or an aqueduct, a water supply system which brought water in from the springs at Veliki Mokri Lug. The water was piped up into the towers for the purpose of increasing the pressure, in order to carry it further. Those towers were: one, where the Terazije Fountain is today (roughly at the small square between the [hotels] Balkan and Moskva; second was where the Ruski car Tavern is; and the third was where kafana Grƒçka Kraljica is now. The tallest of the three was the one at Terazije. That tower, beside its height, also stood on the spacious clearance, away from the surrounding houses and was taller than any of the neighboring buildings. All those towers were called \\"water terazije\\" by the Turks. Because of that, the entire neighborhood of the new section of Belgrade, especially the one between the Stari Dvor and close to the Stambol Gate, is today called Terazije\\". For the word itself, it literally means \\"[water] scales\\", more commonly known as \\"water balances\\" or su terazisi. But the tower-like structures were more than just scales - they were maintaining water pressure when conveying water to neighbourhoods at a high-level. The towers were tall and had a cistern at the summit from which the water flowed into distribution pipes. The Ottoman ƒëeriza followed the route of the ancient aqueduct from the period of Singidunum, the Roman predecessor of Belgrade.  History  = Before 1800 = Old kafana \\"Kod Albanije\\" in the 1910s. Belgrade's first public clock is in the front The top of the Terazije Ridge is rich in water springs. Water used to run down the slope, where the modern Prizrenska Street is, into the Zeleni Venac area. Zeleni Venac is built in the area that was previously part of the trench which surrounded the Belgrade Fortress in the 18th century. When the trench was covered, a pond was formed, partially filled by the stream from Terazije. Today's central city square turned into the bog filled in sludge and covered with overgrowth. Local population visited the pond hunting for ducks. It was recorded that during the cold winters, wolves would reach the pond. The draining of the pond began in the 1830s, but the underground water from Terazije still soaks the land between Terazije and the Sava river. = 1800-1850 = Being outside of the moat and the city walls at the time, it was considered \\"distant\\" by the citizens. As it was located in front of the Stambol Gate and close to the Tsarigrad Road, some artisan shops and khans developed in time. The road was leading through the gate into the city and across the moat. Also, the existence of the water tower, with drinking fountain, helped the area to became sort of the \\"parking lot\\" in front of the city entrance. Terazije started to take shape as an urban feature in the first half of the 19th century. In the 1840s, Serbian ruling prince Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá wanted to resettle Serbian population from the old moated town where they had been mixed with the Turkish inhabitants, and from the neighborhood of Savamala on the bank of the Sava river in order to modernize it. He ordered Serbian craftsmen, especially blacksmiths, cartwrights and coppersmiths, to build their houses and shops on the location of the present square, an empty, inhabited area spreading in front of the Stambol Gate. Also, the move was intended to prevent the fires being lit all over the town and tone down the noise made by these specific types of artisans. However, the craftsmen and artisans refused to relocate, especially the residents of Savamala as prince Milo≈° planned to relocate them even further than Terazije, to the then distant village of Palilula, \\"behind God's back\\". The prince resorted to violence. He gathered his henchmen and thugs and sent them to Savamala in 1835. As the settlement was still just a shanty town, with houses made of rotten wood and mud, all the houses were demolished in one day, without any demolition equipment. Additionally, the ustabasha, chief of the cartwright and blacksmith guild, was publicly beaten, receiving 25 hits. The artisans then agreed to relocate. Ilija ƒåarapiƒá, the president of the Belgrade Municipality 1834-1835 and 1839‚Äì1840, had a special task of assigning the parcels in Terazije to these craftsmen and whoever accepted to fence the lot on his own, would have it for free. One of the lots was granted by prince Milo≈° to his favorite architect, Had≈æi Nikola ≈Ωivkoviƒá. Driving together in the coach one day, prince asked ≈Ωivkoviƒá to whom belongs one of the lots without the fence. ≈Ωivkoviƒá replied it was his, but the prince said: Well, now its not yours anymore, when you failed to fence it all this time. Politician and a businessman Stojan Simiƒá, member of the influential Simiƒá family, purchased the lot at the end of Terazije in the late 1830s. It was a piece of marshland which encompassed the modern features of Stari dvor, Pioneers Park and Park Aleksandrov. By the summer of 1840, he drained the marsh, filled and leveled the terrain and on the northern side of the modern Kralja Milana street built a luxurious mansion from 1840 to 1842. The edifice became known as the Old Konak. Development of the first Serbian royal compound began in 1843, when the state leased the mansion, with the surrounding garden, as the court for the ruling prince Alexander Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá. As the royal family now moved into the neighborhood, first regulatory plan for Terazije, which envisioned it as the new commercial and business center of Belgrade, was drafted in 1843. Terazije in early 1920s = 1850-1900 = The idea for the monument to Karaƒëorƒëe, leader of the First Serbian Uprising from 1804 to 1813, appeared in 1853 and the proposed location was Terazije First official proposal came in 1857, from Toma Vuƒçiƒá-Peri≈°iƒá, one of the leaders of the Defenders of the Constitution. Though Ottoman administration over Serbia was limited at the time, it was still strong enough to prevent building of the monument. They couldn't allow a memorial to the bitter enemy of their empire. After the Saint Andrew's Day Assembly in 1858‚Äì1859, dethroned Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá was restored to power and the idea of erecting a monument to Karaƒëorƒëe on Terazije was abandoned. The \\"Kasina\\" kafana and later hotel was built in 1858. It was named as the gambling was organized for the VIP members (female variant of the word casino). Clientele originally included members of the Serbian Progressive Party. National Assembly of Serbia was seated in the venue's hall for a while in 1918, and until 1920 the National Theatre held performances here, too. In 1860 the kafana \\"Kod Albanije\\" (\\"Chez Albania\\"), was opened. A small, crummy house, built in the oriental, Turkish style, with yellow fa√ßade, it was very popular. The clock in front of it was the first public clock in Belgrade, so it became the most popular meeting point in the city. It was demolished to make way for the Palace Albanija, which was finished in 1939. Starting in 1859, Atanasije Nikoliƒá, educator and agriculturist, planted a number of chestnut trees on Terazije, in the process of making Belgrade greener, where Nikoliƒá, as an engineer and an urbanist, was also charged with arranging the Ko≈°utnjak and Topƒçider parks, and avenues along Terazije and Topƒçider Road, and other streets. He grew seedlings in the nursery garden he personally established in Topƒçider during the 1830s, when he arranged the park. The chestnut avenue in Terazije was planted in double rows. Up to about 1865, the buildings at Terazije were mainly single and double-storied. The water tower was removed in 1860 and replaced by the drinking fountain, \\"Terazijska ƒçesma\\", which was erected in to celebrate the second rule of Prince Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá. During the first reconstruction of the square in 1911, the chestnut avenue was cut, while the ƒçesma was moved to Topƒçider in 1912. In 1860, construction of the Palace with Towers, next to the Old Konak began. It was intended to be the palace of the heir apparent prince Mihailo Obrenoviƒá. The prince never used it, residing mostly in the Little Palace which he built next to the Old Konak, while his court hosted the ministries of interior and foreign affairs. The building was designed by Kosta ≈†repaloviƒá. On 24 May 1860, privately owned predecessor of the public transport in Belgrade was organized. The omnibus line was operated by the diligences. Its starting point was in Terazije, at the kafana \\"Kod Zlatnog Venca\\", and connected it to Topƒçider. The enterprise wasn't much lucrative so the owner Luka Jakovljeviƒá sold it in 1861 to Milan Te≈°iƒá, who expanded the line from Terazije to Varo≈° Kapija and lifted the price to 3 groschen. Terazije Quarter was officially formed on 3 March 1860, so Terazije administratively became part of Belgrade, so as the other neighborhoods outside of the former trench. After the incident at the ƒåukur Fountain, Ottoman garrison withdrew from the Stambol Gate. The gate was demolished from 26 April to 31 May 1866, removing the last \\"scar\\" which divided city parts on the opposite sides of the trench, thus making Terazije one urban unit with the older part of the city. This prompted accelerated urbanization, not only of Terazije, but of the other neighborhoods outside of the old city limits. When the first horsecar was introduced in Belgrade, on 14 October 1892, the station was located in Terazije, next to the fountain. The Little Palace was demolished in April-May 1881 to make way for the Stari Dvor. Designed by Aleksandar Bugarski, it was build on the orders by the prince, later king Milan Obrenoviƒá. The foundation stone was laid on 23 June 1881 and the building was finished by 1883. = 1900‚Äì1918 = Terazije in 1934 Palace Albania, finished in 1939, at night By the turn of the century, the square formed with an \\"egg-shaped\\" base, where the Palace Albanija is today. Near this base, a low, yellow house was built, with several toy and slipper stores covered with roller shutters (ƒáepenak) at the ground level. The upper floor was the seat of the \\"Zvezda\\" monthly magazine, edited by Janko Veselinoviƒá. The \\"Zlatni Krst\\" kafana was built next to it, today replaced with the highrise built in the 1960s. There was also an \\"Albanez\\" inn, sort of students' mess hall, as its clientele were mostly high and middle school students, and their professors. Next to it was \\"Zlatna Slavina\\" inn, frequently visited by the journalists and writers, adjoined by the bookstore and publishing house. The old hotel \\"Balkan\\" with one floor leaned on it. A bit protruding was the bakery (\\"bread shop\\") famous at the time for its products (egg burek, various kifli, pogaƒçice, hot kaymak lepinjas). In May 1904, the insurance company \\"Rusija\\" purchased the estate of Nikola Vukoviƒá across the \\"Balkan\\", which adjoined the fountain. It included house and the \\"Velika Srbija\\" inn. The \\"Velika Srbija\\" was known for good food and wine, and was demolished and replaced by the Hotel Moskva by 30 January 1908. Around it, there were several small shops and grocery stores. Further away was the \\"Viktoroviƒá\\" pharmacy, with distinction of being demolished in the bombings in both World Wars. Close to it were the house of Lazar Arsenijeviƒá Batalaka and kafana \\"Kod Dva Tigra\\". Disreputable at the time, it was later replaced with the building and the famous 1970s and 1980s \\"Atina\\" restaurant. A bit away was the Krsmanoviƒá House, or later known as the Protocol Building. Purchased by the Krsmanoviƒá brothers, it was the location of the 1918 unification proclamation of the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. On the other side of the square was a Renaissance-style administrative building which hosted the offices of the Terazije Quarter. At the corner, there was the \\"Todoroviƒá\\" delicatessen, later replaced with the . One of the oldest kafanas in Belgrade, \\"≈†i≈°kova Kafana\\", was also on this side of Terazije. Gathering place of the Liberas, the one-storey building had a garden, offered newspapers and was known for political debates. It was later demolished and replaced with cinema \\"Beograd\\". Close to it was a string of other kafanas: \\"Takovo\\", considered quite a distinguished venue, \\"Pariz\\" and \\"Uro≈°eva Pivnica\\". The \\"Pariz\\" was a gathering place for the People's Radical Party members, while the \\"Uro≈°eva Pivnica\\" was a typical inn for the travelers from the interior. At the corner of the Skopljanska (today Nu≈°iƒáeva) Street and Terazije, there was the \\"Zunane\\" glass shop. It was later purchased by Toma≈° Rosulek who turned it into the delicatessen. One of the former Robne kuƒáe Beograd departments stores occupies the lot today. Down from the Rosulek store was a well known \\"Panteliƒá\\" pastry shop, famous for its confectionery. There was a narrow extension of the square in this area, in the direction of the goldsmith Mihailo P. Petkoviƒá's store, where the row of fiakers was usually parked. The Old Konak was demolished in 1904, while the Palace with Towers was teared down in 1911. It's demolition it made space for the planned Novi Dvor. The foundation stone was laid in 1911. However, due to the ensuing strings of wars, it was completed only in 1922. Today, Stari Dvor serves as the Belgrade City Hall, while Novi Dvor hosts the Presidency of Serbia. Under the mayor Ljubomir Davidoviƒá, the Technical Administration of Belgrade Municipality organized architectural design competition for complete rearrangement of Terazije in March 1911. Stipulations included removal of the fountain. In the summer of 1911, the plan was developed, headed by the special commission constituted specifically for this purpose and headed by architect √âdouard L√©ger. Most of the provisions envisioned by the project were built: new wide paved sidewalks, formation of the square, a fountain, change in tram tracks for better and faster traffic and removal of the public pissoirs. A monument to Dositej Obradoviƒá, which was projected, was erected in a different neighborhood. The changes in 1911-1913 were significant and the square was completely re-arranged. With L√©ger, major work was done by the architects Veselin Luƒçiƒá, who designed the project, and Jelisaveta Naƒçiƒá. Along the central part of the square regular flower beds were placed,surrounded by a low iron fence. Refurbishment included artistic candelabra, public three-faced clock, a special kiosk in the Serbian-Byzantine style, circle bars for the protection of the trees in the avenue and granite curbs. On the side towards today's Nu≈°iƒáeva street a large Terazije fountain was built in 1927. At the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, Terazije was the centre of social life of Belgrade. In 1913, Davidoviƒá's city administration decided to change the name of the square into the Prestolonaslednikov trg (\\"Heir's apparent square\\"), referring to prince Alexander, future king Alexander I of Yugoslavia. Another decision was to build the fountain on the square which would include the monument to victory. The ideas came after the Balkan Wars and were triggered by the ceremonial entry of the Serbian army in Belgrade after the war ended, and the construction of the Karaƒëorƒëe monument in Kalemegdan. Due to the World War I which ensued shortly after, the decisions weren't fully implemented: the name wasn't changed, the monument was relocated to the Belgrade Fortress, while the short-lived fountain was ultimately built. Naƒçiƒá designed the triumphal arch which was placed in Terazije in order to celebrate Serbian soldiers from the Balkan Wars 1912‚Äì1913. She placed an inscription \\"Not all Serbs are liberated\\" on the arch, pointing to the position of the Serbs in Austria-Hungary. During the occupation in World War I, Austro-Hungarian authorities arrested Naƒçiƒá and expelled her to the internment camp at Neusiedl am See. The neighborhood was damaged during the World War I, especially during the heavy Austro-Hungarian bombardment in 1914‚Äì1915, prior to occupation. Terazije was described as desolate, empty and destroyed by the grenades. The ground cracked, underground canals collapsed and the surrounding buildings were demolished. Serbian army had no proper ammunition to fight the Austrian gunboats, so they freely fired at the city from the Sava river. = Interbellum = Despite complete urbanization, local farmers, up to the 1920s, were illegally selling goods of the ox carts on and around Terazije. It was one of the reasons for city administration to build a large Zeleni Venac farmers market, on Zeleni Venac, below Terazije. Also despite being the sole center of the city, some areas evaded urbanization until the late 1930s, like the Kuzmanoviƒá Yard. This was period of building various highrise buildings (\\"palaces\\"). At No. 10, a Modernist building was constructed in the mid-1930s. It was designed by ƒêorƒëe ƒêorƒëeviƒá in pure style, with the typical geometry of Modernism represented by the step-like risalit. Modern Hotel Balkan was built in 1935, in 1938, while Palace Albania was finished in 1939. = World War II = 1941 hanging in Terazije Monument to the 1941 victims In order to \\"effectively intimidate the population\\" and discourage the people from fighting the occupiers, a military commander of Serbia Heinrich Danckelmann and the head of the Belgrade Gestapo Carl Krauss ordered a killing of five Serbs on Terazije. The executed victims were Velimir Jovanoviƒá (b.1893) and Ratko Jeviƒá (b. 1913), farmers, Svetislav Milin (b. 1915), a shoemaker, Jovan Jankoviƒá (b.1920), a tailor, and Milorad Pokrajac (b. 1924), a high school student, only 17 years old. They were arrested, accused of alleged terrorist activities and brutally tortured before being shot in the yard of the Gestapo headquarters. The entire ordeal happened on 17 August 1941. Their corpses were then hanged on the light poles on Terazije, where they remained for days. A monument to commemorate the crime was erected in 1981 by the city. Titled \\"Monument to the hanged patriots\\" and sculptured by Nikola Jankoviƒá, the obelisk shaped monument is tall with a diameter of . It is posted on the marble pedestal and has carvings representing the scenes of the hanging and a commemorative lyrics by the poet Vasko Popa. In 1983 a memorial bronze plaque, work of Slave Ajtoski, was added. It contains names of the victims and an epitaph: \\"To freedom fighters who were hanged by the Fascist occupiers in Terazije on 17 August 1941\\", signed by \\"citizens of Belgrade\\". The plaque got damaged in time and was removed in 2008, during the reconstruction of Terazije, for restoration. It was returned on 28 May 2011. Terazije, as the central city square, was also used as the hanging location by the previous occupiers, too. During World War I, the Austrians hanged at Terazije citizens who didn't obey the curfew. However, this resulted in incidents, where drunk Austrian soldiers would pull or drag the bodies of the hanged ones, so the bodies and the gallows were removed. Due to the history of this type of executions, the phrase \\"hanging at Terazije\\" entered the Serbian language. It can be variously used in different context: as a threat, offering self-sacrifice or protesting one's innocence. The square and the Palace Albania were hit during the heavy \\"Easter bombing\\" of Belgrade by the Allies on 16 April 1944. = After 1945 = Modern appearance of Terazije is mostly set after 1947. City's main urbanist, Nikola Dobroviƒá, in order to adapt to square for the May 1st military parade, demolished almost everything on the ground level, including all of the flower beds and the other urban ornaments, so as the fountain. The wooden cobbles were removed and two separate traffic lanes were molded into connected carriageways and the adjoining Nu≈°iƒáeva Street was closed for traffic from the Terazije direction. After 1948 the main square in Belgrade was narrowed, double tram tracks from both sides were removed and a number of modernist buildings were constructed, forming a Square of Marx and Engels (present Square of Nikola Pa≈°iƒá) in the 1950s to the north. Terazije became a \\"lifeless\\" ground for the parade and, in the future, for the automobile traffic. An 8-storey building, later known as the Hempro Building, was constructed by Aleksej Brkiƒá at No. 8 in 1951 and finished in 1956. The black and white fa√ßade covering is made of marble, glass and metal, with geometric shapes. It was one of the first public buildings in Belgrade after World War II projected outside of the Socialist realism style, rather being a Modernist edifice. The building also has an imitation of a penthouse with a series of \\"ribbed bachelor apartments\\". Brkiƒá had to follow two rules: the building was not to be higher than 8 storeys, which was the height of the neighboring building, and he had to take in consideration that the Terazije Tunnel will be dug beneath it. Deemed \\"impressive\\" for its period and a \\"bald step towards the international architecture\\", it refreshed the grey urbanity of the socialist city and paved way for the future modernist buildings of the 1950s, like the Hotel Metropol. In 1950, the sculptural group by , which represented merchant Sima Igumanov and two orphans, was removed from the roof of Igumanov's bequest, the Igumanov's Palace. It wasn't just taken down, but was smashed with hammers by the members of the League of Communist Youth of Yugoslavia. This made a way for the first neon commercial signage in 1958. A mobile advertisement for the Zagreb's Chromos Corporation, it was the first neon commercial sign in Belgrade. In February 2020, deputy mayor Goran V–µsiƒá said that the tall sculptural composition is being recreated by the sculptor Zoran Kuzmanoviƒá. Pedestrian underground passage, with commercial facilities, was dug under Terazije in 1967. Terazije Tunnel, for traffic, was opened on 4 December 1970. On 12 December 1975, old Terazije Fountain was relocated from Topƒçider back to the square, and placed at its present location. On 25 January 2020, the square and the surrounding area of was placed under the state protection as the spatial cultural-historical unit.  Administration  Terazije quarter had a population of 6,333 by the 1883 census of population.Belgrade by the 1883 census According to the further censuses, the population of Terazije was 5,273 in 1890, 6,074 in 1895, 6,494 in 1900, 6,260 in 1905, 9,049 in 1910 and 7,038 in 1921. For a short period after the World War II, when Belgrade was administratively reorganized from districts (raions) into the municipalities in 1952, Terazije had its own municipality with the population of 17,858 in 1953. However, already on 1 January 1957 the municipality was dissolved and divided between the municipalities of Vraƒçar and Stari Grad. Population of the modern local community (mesna zajednica) of Terazije was 5,033 in 1981, 4,373 in 1991 and 3,338 in 2002. Municipality of Stari Grad later abolished local communities. Borders of the Terazije local community were streets: Deƒçanska, Nikola Pa≈°iƒá Square, Kneza Milo≈°a, Kraljice Natalije, Sremska, Kolarƒçeva and Makedonska. That way it encompassed Andriƒáev Venac, Pioneers Park, Park Aleksandrov, London, Terazije Terrace and part of historical Savamala. Borders of the Terazije protected area are somewhat reduced: ƒåumiƒáeva, Nu≈°iƒáeva, Deƒçanska, Nikola Pa≈°iƒá Square, Kneza Milo≈°a, Andriƒáev Venac, Dobrinjska, Kraljice Natalije, Sremska. Both definitions excluded the most prominent Terazije feature, Palace Albanija.  Notable buildings  Hotel Moskva Palace Athens Krsmanoviƒá House House of Vuk's Foundation House of Smederevo Bank As the central and one of the most famous squares in Belgrade, it is the location of many famous Belgrade buildings. The most important hotels, restaurants and shops are or were located here. = Former = * Hotel Pariz; it was built in 1870 at the spot where Bezistan passage and shopping area is located today. Hotel was demolished during the reconstruction of the square in 1948; * Kod zlatnog krsta (Serbian for 'By the Golden Cross'); a kafana where the first public cinema show (after the first, private screening in a privately owned house) was held by the Lumi√®re brothers on ; used to be at the spot where Du≈°anov grad is located today; it is not clear whether the brothers showed the movies themselves, or it was their representative, Alexandre Promio; Serbian king Aleksandar Obrenoviƒá was in the audience. The tickets were pricey and the films were screened for the next six months. After Promio left Belgrade, next film was shown only 4 years later, in 1900, but those were mobile cinemas. * Takovo restaurant and cinema; one of the first permanent cinemas in Belgrade, founded in 1909. = Present = * (1902); residential-commercial building built in 1902 for merchant ƒêorƒëe Vuƒço, after design by Dimitrije T. Leko. The edifice in Venetian Renaissance style has two floors and a loft. It hosted restaurant Atina, which was part of the Hospitality Educational Center in 1956‚Äì1958. The restaurant was predated by the kafana \\"Dva Tigra\\". Atina's popularity was especially boosted in the 1970s and the 1980s, when it was adapted into the \\"express restaurant\\" (hot food bar) and became the first pizzeria in Belgrade. * Hotel Moskva (1906); still preserving the original shape with its famous fa√ßade made of ceramic tiles. Often voted as one of the most beautiful buildings in Belgrade; * Putnik Building (1914); at the corner of Terazije and Dragosla Jovanoviƒáa Street, right across the former royal residence of Stari Dvor. It was built in 1914, after the design of Nikola Nestoroviƒá, for the banker Nikola Bo≈°koviƒá. The highrise was considered extremely modern for its time. The fa√ßade was richly decorated in the Vienna Secession style ornaments, while the specificity includes the corner position, with, also very richly ornamented, narrow alcove. The building was purchased by the tourist company \\"Putnik\\" after 1929 and adapted in the 1939-1940 period, when the alcove and all of the fa√ßade ornaments were removed, per ƒêorƒëe ƒêorƒëeviƒá's project. Rajko Tatiƒá designed an additional, indented floor, in 1959. In July 2019 a refurbishment of the building began. Reconstruction project, which includes returning of almost all of the original Secessionist fa√ßade ornaments, is a work of Zoran Ljubiƒçiƒá. After the reconstruction is finished, the building will become a hotel. * Hotel Balkan (1935); right across the Hotel Moskva; originally a one-story building built in 1860 on the location of the Simina Kafana, opened by Sima Mehand≈æija in 1848. It was demolished in 1935 when the present building of the hotel was constructed, work of architect Aleksandar Jankoviƒá; The old building was also known as the Simina mehana (\\"Sima's meyhane\\") and was the gathering point for the volunteers during the Serbian-Turkish wars; Singer Zdravko ƒåoliƒá recorded a song about the hotel in 2000;Zdravko ƒåoliƒá - \\"Okano\\" album * Hotel Kasina (1935); the old hotel was built around 1860, next to Hotel Pariz. The owner of Kasina was Doka Bogdanoviƒá (1860-1914). He allowed for the travelling cinemas to show movies in Kasina in the 1900s and in 1910 Jovanoviƒá opened the permanent cinema. In 1913 he founded the \\"Factory for the making of the cinematography films\\" and purchased the technology for filming movies. He hired Russian photographer Samson Chernov who filmed photo journals from the Second Balkan War which Jovanoviƒá showed in Kasina under the title \\"First Serbian program\\". When the World War I broke out, Jovanoviƒá and Chernov were filming new movies for the cinema in September 1914 on the Syrmian front, when Jovanoviƒá fell off the horse, dying after a while from the aftermaths of the fall. The plays of the National Theatre in Belgrade have been performed here until 1920. The present Hotel Kasina was built at the same place in 1922. Due to the unrepresentative building of the Serbian assembly, and its bad conditions, the deputies occasionally held parliamentary sessions in the \\"Kasina\\" instead. This continued after the creation of the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes in 1918, until the new assembly building was finished in 1936; * Palace Albania (1940), built in 1937, the first high rise in Belgrade and the highest building in the Balkans before World War II; * Theatre on Terazije, in the building of the Retirement Fund of the National Bank of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1941); It is a Serbian equivalent to Broadway staging numerous musical productions and adaptations from around the world. The theatre is one of the most modern in Belgrade being reconstructed in 2005; * The biggest McDonald's restaurant in the Balkans (1989);  Other features  = Bezistan = Bezistan is a shopping area in an indoor passage which connects Terazije and the Square of Nikola Pa≈°iƒá. Originally, it was a location of Hotel \\"Pariz\\", which was built in 1870 and demolished in 1948 during the reconstruction of Terazije. Passage has been protected by the state as a \\"cultural property\\", though still under the \\"preliminary protection\\", and was nicknamed by the architects as the \\"belly button of Belgrade\\". It is part of the wider protected Spatial Cultural-Historical Unit of Stari Grad. Since the 1950s, the covered square was a quiet corner in sole downtown, with mini gardens and coffee shops and a popular destination of many Belgraders, but in the recent decades mainly lost that function. In 1959 a round plateau with the fountain and a bronze sculpture, called ‚ÄúGirl with the seashell‚Äù, sculptured by Aleksandar Zarin, was built. A webbed roof, shaped like a semi-opened dome, made of concrete and projected by Vladeta Maksimoviƒá, was constructed to cover the plateau and the fountain. Because of that feature, and a small shops located in it, it was named \\"Bezistan\\", though it never functioned as the bezistan in its true, oriental sense of the term. Revitalization and reconstruction was projected for the second half of 2008, but the only work that has been done was the reconstruction of the plateau and the fountain in 2011. A popular disco club \\"Bezistan\\" was opened in the 1980s. It was located in the basement of the venue which was later adapted into the McDonald restaurant. It was different from other discos of the era, and was the only \\"dancing club\\" in the city. When the popularity of the Italo disco reached Belgrade, the club organized dance competitions for participant from the entire Yugoslavia. Band Zana was promoted for the first time here, while band Aska practiced its choreography for their performance at the 1982 Eurovision song contest. The venue was closed in 1989. Bezistan covers an area of . The major feature within Bezistan was the \\"Kozara\\" cinema, one of the most popular in Belgrade for decades. It was closed in 2003, purchased by Croatian tycoon Ivica Todoriƒá and allegedly planned as a supermarket for Todoriƒá's Serbian brand \\"Idea\\" before it was destroyed by fire on 25 May 2012 It has been left in that condition ever since. Bezistan had candy and souvenir shops on one side, and modernistic section on other side, with McDonald's restaurant, modern coffee shop and \\"Reiffeisen bank\\", but as of 2018 it looks like nothing more than a neglected, empty passage. New possible reconstruction was announced in April 2017, followed by a series of postponing: for October 2017, January, March and May 2018. The project includes new paving of the area and reintroduction of the greenery. Nothing has been done, though, and in May 2019 part of the concrete ceiling collapsed so the city again promised to renovate the passage, sometime in 2019. = ƒåumiƒá Alley = In the early 20th century, a section behind the main square became a hub of commercial and craft shops. After the owner of the lot, quite big for the central urban zone of the city, ≈Ωivko Kuzmanoviƒá, the area became known as the Kuzmanoviƒá Alley, or Kuzmanoviƒá Yard. Initially quite a successful business area, by the 1930s the shops went bankrupt and were closed. The alley was transformed into an informal settlement. In the reprint of its article from 13 March 1937, daily Politika writes about the city's decision to tear down the Kuzmanoviƒá Yard: It seems that another disgrace will disappear from Belgrade, but much larger and more dangerous for the health and lives of the people than that eyesore that ‚ÄùAlbania‚Äù was. A row of shacks and hovels in ‚ÄùKuzmanoviƒá yard‚Äù, which altogether cover an area of 4.000 m2 between the streets of Deƒçanska, Pa≈°iƒáeva nad Kolarƒçeva, will disappear. Belgrade municipality sent its commission yesterday to check the condition of the ‚ÄùKuzmanoviƒá yard‚Äù. The commission established that the shanties and burrows are prone to collapse any minute and that it will advocate for them to be demolished, in the interest of health and lives of the tenants. The shantytown was demolished by 1940. The alley was later renamed ƒåumiƒáevo Sokaƒçe (\\"ƒåumiƒá Alley\\") after a politician Aƒáim ƒåumiƒá, former mayor of Belgrade and prime minister of Serbia. In 1989, the first modern shopping mall (concurrently with the Staklenac on the Republic Square) in Belgrade was opened in ƒåumiƒá Alley, colloquially shortened only to ƒåumiƒá. It soon became one of the elite shopping locations in Belgrade, with numerous caf√©s, galleries and clubs in addition. It is also the shortest passage between the squares of the Republic and of Nikola Pa≈°iƒá. By the late 1990s, when other shopping malls started to open around the city, the decline of ƒåumiƒá began. By 2010, the district was almost completely abandoned, becoming a ghost town. Then a group of young designers moved into the empty shops and began selling their homemade crafts, forming a Belgrade Design District with over 100 shops. In 2018 city administration stepped in with plans of creating a full artistic quart in the future. The deadline is set for 2020. The shopping mall was built without proper permits as the city urban plans envisioned public garage on that location, so there was always a possibility for the city to demolish it and go with its plan. In May 2020 city reiterated that it will not demolish it, but due to the ownership issues, lack of paperwork, plans and designs, and COVID-19 pandemic, the reconstruction was moved for 2021. = Sremska = Sremska is a short, curved street which connects the section where the Knez Mihailova and Terazije meet and the Mar≈°ala Birjuzova street, making a pedestrian connection between Terazije and Zeleni Venac, and with Varo≈° Kapija, further down the Mar≈°ala Birjuzova. Sremska is known for the shopping mall on its right side. On the left side, the tall building of \\"Agrobanka\\" was built from 1989 to 1994, and as a part of the project, a barren concrete plateau was built right above the Terazije tunnel. Since the 1990s it was used as a location for the small flea market. In 2005 the market was removed and from December 2010 to April 2011 the concrete slab was turned into a mini-square (piazzetta) with small, mobile park, in the form of the roof garden. The urban pocket has lawns, flowers and evergreen shrubs. It is also Belgrade's first public location in the past 100 years that had a mosaic done on the floor. Materials used include the porous concrete, movable metal construction on which the grass turfs are planted and the drip irrigation system was installed. With Terazije, it is part of the \\"Stari Beograd\\" (\\"Old Belgrade\\") cultural unit, which is under protection. In time, due to the poor maintenance, by 2019 the ‚Äò‚Äôpiazetta‚Äô‚Äô deteriorated again. = Terazije Fountain = Drinking fountain in 1876 In history, there were 2 fountains in Terazije: a drinking fountain (1860-1911 & 1976-) and a fountain (1927-1947). Terazije drinking fountain (, ); The fountain replaced the old Turkish water tower, which had only one water pipe. It was envisioned by the first regulatory plan developed for Terazije in 1843. Plan for the fountain was presented to the State Council on 13 March 1846. General design included the monument-like, four-sided fountain with water pipes and troughs on two opposite side, with stone benches on two other sides. The monument would be tall and the entire complex would be made of dressed stone. From start, the fountain would be connected to the city waterworks. On 16 March, the Council accepted the proposal and allocated 2,570 silver forints. The project wasn't executed. Italian sculptor from Novara, Giuseppe Cassano, drafted the new, detailed plan for the fountain. Still, the plan followed all general stipulations from the 1846 design. He presented it on 26 May 1855, but this plan also remained only on paper. By July 1859, the public and the press openly objected the shape of the existing Turkish water tower, as being worn out by the time and having just one pipe which is not nearly enough for the needs of this part of the city. The fountain was disparaging the neighborhood, especially regarding its location in the burgeoning business area and new commercial hub of Belgrade as Terazije was described as one of the most beautiful Belgrade cities by this time. As the area around it also wasn't properly arranged, there were constant crowds and quarrels. This was regular for other fountains n Belgrade at the time, too, and some skirmishes ended up having major political impact, like the 1862 ƒåukur Fountain incident. In the end, the fountain was built to celebrate the return of Prince Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá to Serbia and his second rule, though the historians can't agree whether he supplied the funds for its construction, as often reported. Foundation stone was laid and consecrated on , though it is often erroneously reported as 1859. The old water tower was removed. The fountain provided of water on all four pipes. The fountain had appearance it preserved until today. It has carved \\"MO\\", the initials of Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá, and \\"1860\\", the year of its completion. Italian stone cutter Francesco Franco Lorano sculptured it. When the new, modern Belgrade waterworks system was inaugurated, Metropolitan of Belgrade Mihailo Jovanoviƒá consecrated it on the fountain on , the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul. During the reconstruction of Terazije, the fountain was planned for relocation in March 1911. City administration decided so, because they were sure it will damage the planned, future appearance of Terazije. It was originally to be moved, with \\"the full piety\\", either to the spring of Hajduƒçka ƒåesma in Ko≈°utnjak, or somewhere within the city limits, at some respected location. It was to be relocated in its entirety and to be transformed into the \\"flower vase\\". In the end, it was moved to Topƒçider in 1912. It was situated in the churchyard of the Topƒçider Church. Question remains whether the relocation was indeed influenced by the urbanism or rather by the political reasons as the ruling dynasties switched from the Obrenoviƒá to the Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá in 1903. Relocation helped the preservation of the fountain. Terazije were heavily bombed and damaged in both World wars, including its major landmarks like Palace Albania and Hotel Moskva, but the fountain in the park, on the outskirts of the city, survived unharmed. During the Communist period, it was decided to return the fountain to Terazije. With the participation of structural geologist , the relocation was conducted on 12 December 1975. Nothing was changed on the object itself, so it preserved its original 1860 appearance. The location is not the same, though. It was moved a bit closer to the Hotel Moskva than it used to be, because of the underground passage dug under Terazije in 1967. Terazije fountain (, ); The first proper, decorative fountain (fontana) in Belgrade, as previously only drinking fountains (ƒçesma) were built. A plan for the rearrangement of Terazije in the summer of 1911, among numerous other changes, included the construction of a new fountain. Among many rundelas (round flower beds), on the side towards today's passage to the Nu≈°iƒáeva street one rundela was used as the base for the postament of the monument ‚ÄúVictory Herald‚Äù, a work of Ivan Me≈°troviƒá. Me≈°troviƒá's statue was finished in 1913, immediately after and as a continuation, in concept and style, of the cycle of sculptures intended for his large-scale project for a shrine commemorating the Battle of Kosovo (\\"Temple of Vidovdan\\"), which includes representative sculptures such as Milo≈° Obiliƒá and Marko Kraljeviƒá. Conceived as a colossal athletic male nude set up on a tall column, the monument symbolically represents the iconic figure of victory. In iconographic terms, the personification of the triumph of a victorious nation can be traced back to classical antiquity and its mythic hero Hercules. The outbreak of World War I and the reconstruction of a massively demolished Belgrade delayed the dedication but the idea was revived in the 1920s. However, some puritan and female organizations protested heavily against posting a tall figure of a fully naked man in downtown. It was then opted to erect the monument in the Kalemegdan Park in the Belgrade Fortress. Becoming known as Pobednik (The Victor), the statue is today a symbol and one of the most recognized landmarks of Belgrade. Replica of the former fountain (1927-47). The replica itself was demolished in 2015 The rundela designated as the base of the monument remained empty. Due to the impending marriage of the King Alexander I Karaƒëorƒëeviƒá and Romanian princess Maria, city architect Momir Korunoviƒá was given a task of making something out of it, worthy of the royal wedding which was set for 8 June 1922. The rundela was turned into the several steps elevated podium, with a stone border which was ornamented with the lion heads from the outside and pigeons from the inside. Due to the lack of time and funds, the animal ornaments were made of papier-m√¢ch√©, like a theatrical scenography. After the wedding, the cardboard ornaments survived until the fall of 1922 and were disintegrated by the rains. The rundela again remained empty for several years. In 1927 city administration decided to adapt it into a fountain. It was ceremonially open on 2 April 1927. During winters, in order to prevent the frost damage, the entire fountain was covered with hay, earth and grass on top. It was a constant source of making fun of the city government, which was being accused by the journalists for creating a midden in downtown instead of progressing to the future. The fountain itself though, was considered a beauty: it was made of greenish granite, had sprinklers of different intensity while the bed of the pond was made from Murano glass. In 1947, Dobroviƒá demolished almost everything to the ground level, including the fountain His explanation for the destruction was that the fountain \\"choked\\" the traffic. When the original plans were made, the municipality purchased the marble in 1911 which was to be used not only for the fountain, but for the entire reconstruction the square. When Belgrade was conquered by the German army during World War I, in October 1915, German commander, Generalfeldmarschall August von Mackensen, order for the dead soldiers to be buried on the hill above Banovo Brdo, where an extension of Ko≈°utnjak forest is today. He also ordered for three monuments to be built (two for German and one for Serbian soldiers), and the marble for Terazije was used. Same marble was used in 1916 when German emperor Wilhelm II arrived in Belgrade for the large stone bench, built for him by the German soldiers next to the cemetery. Though in various states of bad shape, all four object made from Terazije marble still survive in the 21st century. = Terazije Terrace = Upper section of the terrace, across the Hotel Moskva Terazije Terrace ( is a sloping park coming down from the Statistical Yearbook of Belgrade 2007 - Topography, climate and environment high Terazije Ridge (on top of which Terazije is built) to the right bank of the Sava river, but more specifically coming down to the Zeleni Venac market. Geographically, it is a part of the larger, long Sava Ridge. The top of the area is an excellent natural lookout point to the Sava river valley, Novi Beograd and further into the Syrmia region. The future of the terrace is a subject of public and academic debate ever since the 19th century. The urban arrangement of the area \\"behind the Prince Milo≈° fountain\\" was tackled for the first time in 1867, by the city's first urbanist Emilijan Josimoviƒá. Architect Andra Stevanoviƒá in 1897 suggested the transformation of the area into the scenic viewpoint, which would \\"open view on the Sava river and the Podrinje mountains\\". His colleague, Dimitrije T. Leko suggested Terazije Terrace as the location of the new National Assembly of Serbia building. Engineer Jevta Stevanoviƒá proposed in 1910 for the Belgrade Municipal Hall to be built here. First general plan for it is from 1912 by the French architect Alban Chamond which envisioned it as the cascades of trapezoid piazzetas with flowers and fountains, leaving the panoramic view intact. Austrian architects Emil Hoppe and Otto Sch√∂nthal proposed their solution for the slope in 1919. They envisioned it as an esplanade, surrounded by the new buildings and the monument to Unification. The monumental, grandiose project was rejected for being too expensive. International design competition for Belgrade's general plan (GP) was announced in 1921 and none of the subjected works, dealing with 58 proposed public buildings, dealt with the terrace, leaving an empty space in downtown. Head of the commission for GP ƒêorƒëe Kovaljevski noticed this and in 1922 ordered new plan just for this area. In 1923 a project for constructing a terrace-observation point was made, as the \\"central city lookout\\". City began to buy out the lots along the Balkanska and Prizrenska streets and to demolish objects. For the first time, this opened view from Terazije to the Sava. The 1924 GP also tackled the issue of the slope. In 1929, Serbian architect Nikola Dobroviƒá's plan was accepted. He projected two tall, tower-like business buildings on the both ends of the ridge and a plateau between with several small business and leisure objects, while the slope itself would be a succession of horizontal gardens, pools and fountains. Dobroviƒá envisioned it as part of the closest connection of downtown and the Sava river: Terazije- Terazije Terrace-Kraljice Natalije Street-Karaƒëoƒëreva Street. Due to the Great Depression, in 1930 city decided that the temporary solution will be park on three step levels, until it becomes possible to construct the \\"future monumental terrace\\". At that time, only the upper section was adapted as a park, while the lower section was occupied by the houses in the Kraljice Natalije Street and their backyards. In order to hide that \\"eyesore\\" from the view of the people in downtown, a front-type wooden wall made of slats was constructed in the 1930s. It was made like a grid, and the ivy was planted in order to grow around it and to obstruct the view on the lower neighborhood. The houses were demolished after World War II, so the park today extends all the way to the Kraljice Natalije Street. Downhill view, on Zeleni Venac and New Belgrade, across the Sava river In 1937, Romanian architects won the competition on arrangement of the entire downtown from Theatre Square to Terazije. They envisioned demolition of both the Balkan and the Moskva hotels and formation of the monumental park. However, new city's GP from 1939 retained the project of Dobroviƒá. There was another project, by Stanko Mandiƒá, in 1951. In the 1990s Dobroviƒá's plan was reactivated, but the temporary park remained and a competition from 1991 (won by Slobodan Rajeviƒá and Zoran Nikeziƒá) resulted only in the large building at the beginning of the Balkanska street. Bulky residential-business complex, built by the \\"Mali Kolektiv\\" company, met with disapproval of the public. General consensus was that the building rather defaced Terazije instead to beautify it. Another competition followed in 1998. In 2006 a new tender for architectural solution for Terazije Terrace was organized which resulted in 2007 project by Jovan Mitroviƒá and Dejan Miljkoviƒá, and 2008 project by Branislav Red≈æiƒá (shared with a different project by Grozdana ≈†i≈°oviƒá and Dejan Milanoviƒá), but they all remained only on paper. City architect at the time, ƒêorƒëe Bobiƒá, favored the ≈†i≈°oviƒá- Milanoviƒá project, which was met with criticism. In 2015, city urbanist Milutin Foliƒá announced plans to reactivate and adapt Red≈æiƒá's project and asked for the donations of ‚Ç¨3 million. After that failed, city claimed it spared enough money in 2016 and announced reconstruction for 2017, but nothing happened. City again announced it will arrange the slope in 2019 but without specifying by which project. In January 2020 city official stated they will combine two designs, the 2008 one by Red≈æiƒá and the second awarded work from 1998 by Branislav Mitroviƒá and Miljkoviƒá. A month later, city urbanist Marko Stojƒçiƒá included the ≈†i≈°oviƒá-Milanoviƒá in this group, as this project has now been deemed unjustly pushed aside. Stojƒçiƒá said that at the new bidding will not be a proper bidding, instead the jury will cherry-pick from each project and adjust it to the modern guidelines (pedestrian zone, more green areas, etc.). He also said that the jury, unlike now, won't be made only of architects, but the clerks from the city administration will be members, too. Public protested, considering a circus the constant change of projects and prolonged start of the reconstruction. All three invited teams refused to participate in the proposed bidding, so the city decided to return to the 2008 project by Red≈æiƒá in May 2020, announcing the reconstruction is not ready anyway due to technical problems, moving it for 2021. By this time, urbanists and other architects began to criticize all the projects as wrong, starting with the Dobroviƒá's design and all the other which all followed his basic idea which includes, in different variants, concreting of some , construction of the pointless monumental stairways under which the \\"tunnel\\" will host just another shopping mall. Instead, some proposed ditching of all those projects and construction of a proper, modern park, which would descent down to the Sava bank and help conduct fresh river air directly into the overheated city downtown. = Terazije Tunnel = Terazije Tunnel () is a traffic tunnel which passes right beneath Terazije in the east‚Äìwest direction. Eastern entry point is at the intersection of the Deƒçanska and Nu≈°iƒáeva streets, while western is the extension of the Brankova street. It is a direct and the closest link between downtown Belgrade and the Branko's Bridge and further to the New Belgrade and Zemun. In one of his projects, architect Dimitrije T. Leko envisioned the tunnel in 1955. In 1957-60 a building was constructed by Zagorka Me≈°ulam which is located at the future entry point from the Nu≈°iƒáeva street. An elevated empty space in the base of the building was built to keep and area for the future descent into the tunnel. The space was hidden behind the wall before the tunnel was built. The tunnel was projected by the Ljubomir Porfiroviƒá and Milosav Vidakoviƒá and was officially opened on 4 December 1970 by the President of Yugoslavia Josip Broz Tito and the first lady Jovanka Broz. It was part of the four major official openings on the same day, which also included the Mostar interchange, the highway through Belgrade and the Gazela bridge. Today Terazije tunnel is known as one of the busiest traffic routes in Belgrade and even a short stoppage in it causes widespread traffic jams all over the downtown. On the same day, the pedestrian underground passage in Nu≈°iƒáeva street, at the entrance into the tunnel, was also opened. First 24/7 supermarket in Belgrade, (in Serbian: dragstor), was opened in the passage. Since then, it deteriorated quite a bit, with only few shops working, despite a partial reconstruction in 2009. During the planning, it was envisioned that two old buildings at the Zeleni Venac entrance will be demolished. One is located at the corner of the Prizrenska and Sremska, and another at the corner of the Sremska and Mar≈°ala Birjuzova. The latter had a distinction of surviving World War II, though damaged, even though the surrounding area was so badly ruined that it had to be leveled to the ground after the war. Post-war urbanists planned to demolish it, too, but it survived. In the end, one wing of the building in the Prizrenska had to be demolished, while the building in the Mar≈°ala Birjuzova survived again. Earning a moniker of \\"tunnel sentinel\\", its fa√ßade was fully renovated in 2019. Already in the 1970s it was evident that the tunnel is not adequate for the amount of traffic. A \\"twin tunnel\\" for the traffic from the opposite direction was planned. It was to connect the Bulevar kralja Aleksandra and the Branko's Bridge. According to the proposed plans, the traffic would descend underground between the bridge and the Republic Square. In time, several other routes were proposed, like the Branko's Bridge-Bulevar Despota Stefana (Palilula neighborhood), from the Pop Lukina Street at the bridge to the First school of economics at the corner of the Cetinjska and Bulevar Despota Stefana streets. Ultimately, the tunnel wasn't built. In the 2010s the idea of a tunnel resurfaced, but though the exit point at Palilula remained in the new plans, the entry point was moved to the west, near the Old Sava Bridge area.

It was one of the more successful cyclecars and was based on a design bought from Carden and built in the factory that they had previously used. At the peak they had 80 employees. The first model was a single-seater, the Monocar, only wide with bodies built by the Thames Valley Pattern Works out of wood, plywood or even compressed paper. The complete car only weighed about . Engines were rear mounted, air-cooled and rated from 5 to 8hp. There was a choice of JAP (most commonly), Blackburne or rarely MAG units. Gearboxes were either a two-speed epicyclic unit with foot-operated change or three-speed Sturmey-Archer with chain drive to the rear axle. Steering was by a wire and bobbin system with the entire front axle being pivoted on early cars. Several hundred were made. The Monocar was described by Ixion of The Motor Cycle as \\"a low, coffin-shape projectile, moderately attractive in dense fog. In 1920 a two-seater, the Bi- car, was added with the passenger behind the driver. The width of the car increased to 36 inches. About 50 were made. A more conventional side by side model was added in 1921 called the Runabout with a body long. The original Monocar and Bi-car were dropped in 1922 but production of the Runabout continued until 1924 and later to special order. The company changed its name in 1923 to A.V.

In principle, it is relevant also for gases or liquids, but on earth their mass distribution is almost homogeneous. Astronomy In astronomy mass distribution has decisive influence on the development e.g. of nebulae, stars and planets. The mass distribution of a solid defines its center of gravity and influences its dynamical behaviour - e.g. the oscillations and eventual rotation. Mathematical modelling A mass distribution can be modeled as a measure. This allows point masses, line masses, surface masses, as well as masses given by a volume density function. Alternatively the latter can be generalized to a distribution. For example, a point mass is represented by a delta function defined in 3-dimensional space. A surface mass on a surface given by the equation f(x,y,z) = 0 may be represented by a density distribution g(x,y,z) Œ¥ (f(x,y,z)), where g/\\\\mid abla f \\\\mid is the mass per unit area.

History and profile The magazine was published by Ray Gun Publishing, Inc. based in Santa Monica, California and owned by the Warner Music Enterprises, a subsidiary of Time Warner. It was launched in September 1994 as a new business venture concept in a mixed music sample marketing/publishing format. huH was edited by Ray Gun Publishing Editorial Director Mark Blackwell and was designed by Vaughan Oliver and Jerome Curchod. The magazine's editorial staff also included writer Dean Kuipers. huH was published on a monthly basis. Initially, the magazine came packaged in a prototype sent by mail that included the square-ish magazine and a VHS tape with videos by artists mentioned in the magazine, all boxed up in styrofoam and sealed in plastic wrap. After marketing stabilization and a format change, the magazine included sampler CDs released on a monthly basis by genre while reviews were contained within the magazine. The format then changed to a numbered sequence with all sample songs on one CD per month. huH mostly featured articles on rock, rap and alternative music. The magazine also included a letters section with a mostly youth audience, news briefs, and cartoons. Its large, almost square design distinguished it among other publications. huH stopped circulating in 1996.

More than 3,000 prehistoric standing stones were hewn from local granite and erected by the pre-Celtic people of Brittany, and form the largest such collection in the world. Most of the stones are within the Breton village of Carnac, but some to the east are within La Trinit√©-sur-Mer. The stones were erected at some stage during the Neolithic period, probably around 3300 BCE, but some may date to as early as 4500 BCE. Although the stones date from 4500 BCE, modern myths were formed which resulted from 1st century AD Roman and later Christian occupations. A Christian myth associated with the stones held that they were pagan soldiers in pursuit of Pope Cornelius when he turned them to stone. Brittany has its own local versions of the Arthurian cycle. Local tradition claims that the reason they stand in such perfectly straight lines is that they are a Roman legion turned to stone by Merlin. In recent centuries, many of the sites have been neglected, with reports of dolmens being used as sheep shelters, chicken sheds or even ovens. Even more commonly, stones have been removed to make way for roads, or as building materials. The continuing management of the sites remains a controversial topic. Alignments Menec alignment, at the western end There are three major groups of stone rowsM√©nec, Kermario and Kerlescanwhich may have once formed a single group, but have been split up as stones were removed for other purposes. The standing stones are made of weathered granite from local outcroppings that once extensively covered the area. =M√©nec alignments= Model of the M√©nec alignment Stones in the M√©nec alignment Eleven converging rows of menhirs stretching for . There are what Alexander Thom considered to be the remains of stone circles at either end. According to the tourist office there is a \\"cromlech containing 71 stone blocks\\" at the western end and a very ruined cromlech at the eastern end. The largest stones, around high, are at the wider, western end; the stones then become as small as high along the length of the alignment before growing in height again toward the extreme eastern end. =Kermario alignment= Model of the Kermario alignment Stones in the Kermario alignment This fan-like layout recurs a little further along to the east in the Kermario (House of the Dead) alignment. It consists of 1029 stonesHolidays in Brittany in ten columns, about in length. A stone circle to the east end, where the stones are shorter, was revealed by aerial photography. =Kerlescan alignments= Model of the Kerlescan alignment A smaller group of 555 stones, further to the east of the other two sites. It is composed of 13 lines with a total length of about , ranging in height from to . At the extreme west, where the stones are tallest, there is a stone circle which has 39 stones. There may also be another stone circle to the north. =Petit-M√©nec alignments= A much smaller group, further east again of Kerlescan, falling within the commune of La Trinit√©-sur-Mer. These are now set in woods, and most are covered with moss and ivy. Tumuli Tumulus of Saint-Michel There are several tumuli, mounds of earth built up over a grave. In this area, they generally feature a passage leading to a central chamber which once held neolithic artifacts. =Saint- Michel= The tumulus of Saint-Michel was constructed between 5000 BC and 3400 BC. At its base it is , and is high. It required of stone and earth. Its function was a tomb for the members of the ruling class. It contained various funerary objects, such as 15 stone chests, pottery, jewellery, most of which are currently held by the Museum of Prehistory of Carnac. It was excavated in 1862 by Ren√© Galles with a series of vertical pits, digging down . Le Rouzic also excavated it between 1900 and 1907, discovering the tomb and the stone chests. A chapel was built on top in 1663 and was rebuilt in 1813, before being destroyed in 1923. The current building is an identical reconstruction of the 1663 chapel, built in 1926. =Moustoir= Also known as Er Man√©, it is a chamber tomb long, wide, and high. It has a dolmen at the west end, and two tombs at the east end. A small menhir, approximately high, is nearby. Dolmens The dolmen Er-Roc'h-Feutet. An inscription next to every standing stone formation proclaims ownership by the state of France. There are several dolmens scattered around the area. These dolmens are generally considered to have been tombs; however, the acidic soil of Brittany has eroded away the bones. They were constructed with several large stones supporting a capstone, then buried under a mound of earth. In many cases, the mound is no longer present, sometimes due to archeological excavation, and only the large stones remain, in various states of ruin. =Er-Roc'h-Feutet= North, near the Chapelle de La Madeleine. Has a completely covered roof. =La Madeleine= A large dolmen measuring , with a long broken capstone. It is named after the nearby Chapelle de La Madeleine, which is still used. =Kercado= Dolmen of Kercado. Though smaller than St. Michel, older by many centuries before 4800 BC A rare dolmen still covered by its original cairn. South of the Kermario alignments, it is wide, high, and has a small menhir on top. Previously surrounded by a circle of small menhirs out, the main passage is long and leads to a large chamber where numerous artifacts were found, including axes, arrowheads, some animal and human teeth, some pearls and sherds, and 26 beads of a unique bluish Nephrite gem. It has some Megalithic art carved on its inner surfaces in the form of serpentines and a human-sized double-axe symbol carved in the underside of its main roof slab. In ancient cultures, the axe and more precisely the bi-pennis used to represent the lightning powers of divinity. It was constructed around 4600 BC and used for approximately 3,000 years. =Man√© Brizil= =Kerlescan= A roughly rectangular mound, with only one capstone remaining. It is aligned east-to-west, with a passage entrance to the south. =Kermarquer= On a small hill, has two separate chambers. =Man√©-Kerioned= (Pixies' mound or Grotte de Grionnec):A group of three dolmens with layout unique in Brittany, once covered by a tumulus. Whereas most groups of dolmens are parallel, these are arranged in a horseshoe. The largest of the three is at the east, . =Crucuno= The Crucuno dolmen A \\"classic\\" dolmen, with a , tablestone resting on pillars roughly high. Prior to 1900, it was connected by a passage making it long. =Crucuno stone rectangle= : A classic 3, 4, 5 rectangle of 21 menhirs varying in height from to that is aligned along its diagonal to the midsummer sunrise. Alexander Thom suggested it measured forty by thirty of his megalithic yards. Other formations The Manio quadrilateral arrangement. The Manio \\"Giant\\". There are some individual menhirs and at least one other formation which do not fit into the above categories. =Manio quadrilateral= An arrangement of stones to form the perimeter of a large rectangle. Originally a \\"tertre tumulus\\" with a central mound, it is long, and aligned to east of northeast. The quadrilateral is wide to the east, but only wide at the west. =Manio giant= Near the quadrilateral is a single massive menhir, now known as the \\"Giant\\". Over tall, it was re-erected around 1900 by Zacharie Le Rouzic, and overlooks the nearby Kerlescan alignment. Excavation and analysis Large upright in the M√©nec alignment From the 1720s increasing interest was shown in these features.Astonishing Heaps of Stones In 1796, for example, La Tour d'Auvergne attributed them to druidic gatherings. In 1805, A. Maudet de Penho√´t claimed they represented stars in the sky. Englishmen Francis Ronalds and Alexander Blair made a detailed survey of the stones in 1834. Ronalds created the first accurate drawings of many of them with his patented perspective tracing instrument, which were printed in a book Sketches at Carnac (Brittany) in 1834. =Miln and Le Rouzic= The first extensive excavation was performed in the 1860s by Scottish antiquary James Miln (1819‚Äì1881), who reported that by then fewer than 700 of the 3,000 stones were still standing.The Independent: Bretons fight for Carnac to stay in the Stone Age Towards 1875, Miln engaged a local boy, (1864‚Äì1939), as his assistant, and Zacharie learnt archaeology on the job. After Miln's death, he left the results of his excavations to the town of Carnac, and the James Miln Museum was established there by his brother Robert to house the artifacts. Zacharie became the director of the Museum and, although self-taught, became an internationally recognised expert on megaliths in the region. He too left the results of his work to the town, and the museum is now named Le Mus√©e de Pr√©histoire James Miln ‚Äì Zacharie le Rouzic.Carnac ‚Äî Megalithic alignments of standing stones.Mus√©e de Pr√©histoire James Miln ‚Äì Zacharie le Rouzic =Other theories= The M√©nec alignments of some 1,100 stones in 11 columns. In 1887, H. de Cleuziou argued for a connection between the rows of stones and the directions of sunsets at the solstices. Among more recent studies, Alexander Thom worked with his son Archie from 1970 to 1974 to carry out a detailed survey of the Carnac alignments, and produced a series of papers on the astronomical alignments of the stones as well as statistical analysis supporting his concept of the megalithic yard. Thom's megalithic yard has been challenged. There are also general theories on the use of the stones as astronomical observatories, as has been claimed for Stonehenge. According to one such theory, the massive menhir at nearby Locmariaquer was linked to the alignments for such a purpose. http://www.dinosoria.com/dolmen_menhir.htm Management Sheep grazing around the Kerlescan alignment, part of a new management strategy. The Mus√©e de Pr√©histoire James Miln ‚Äì Zacharie le Rouzic is at the centre of conserving and displaying the artefacts from the area. It also contains the \\"world's largest collection [of] prehistoric[al] exhibits\\" with over 6,600 prehistoric objects from 136 different sites. The monuments themselves were listed and purchased by the State at the start of the 20th century to protect them against quarrymen, and while this was successful at the time, in the middle of the century, redevelopment, changes to agricultural practices and increasing tourism bringing visitors to the stones led to rapid deterioration. The Minist√®re de la Culture et de la Communication (Heritage Ministry) re-examined the issue starting in 1984, and subsequently set up the ‚ÄòMission Carnac‚Äô in 1991 with the aim of rehabilitating and developing the alignments. This involved restricting public access, launching a series of scientific and technical studies, and producing a plan for conservation and development in the area.The Carnac Project As with the megalithic structure of Stonehenge in England, management of the stones can be controversial. Since 1991, the main groups of stone rows have been protected from the public by fences \\"to help vegetation growth\\", preventing visits except by organised tours. They are open during winter, however. When James Miln studied the stones in the 1860s, he reported that fewer than 700 of the 3,000 stones were still standing, and subsequent work during the 1930s and 1980s (using bulldozers) rearranged the stones, re-erecting some, to make way for roads or other structures. In 2002, protesters invaded the site, opening the padlocks and allowing tourists free entry. In particular, the group Collectif Holl a gevred (French and Breton for \\"the everyone-together collective\\") occupied the visitor centre for the Kermario alignment, demanding an immediate stop to current management plans and local input into further plans. In recent years, management of the site has also experimented with allowing sheep to graze among the stones, in order to keep gorse and other weeds under control.
