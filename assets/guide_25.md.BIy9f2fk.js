Prior to boxing, Khan played football for his local club before the club was eventually shut down. Khan supports his local football team Bolton Wanderers and he also enjoys Indian Premier League cricket. His all-time favorite boxer is Oscar De La Hoya. In 2016, Khan married Arifa Janjua in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Khan and Janjua then flew back to Bolton where their Walima took place.

He was one of the founding players of rugby league in Australia at the time of the rebel code's breakaway from rugby union. He played for New South Wales in the very first rugby match run by the newly created 'New South Wales Rugby Football League' which had just split away from the established New South Wales Rugby Football Union.  Rugby union career  Fry 3rd from L, 2nd row with NSW team who met the All Golds in Sydney 1907 Fry was one of the New South Wales rugby union players who matched up against the first professional New Zealand team, Albert Baskiville's 'All Golds' in three matches in Sydney in August 1907. The New South Wales rugby union side had defeated the All Blacks 14–0 in their second of two matches in 1907 and so were expected to be tough opponents. The first professional game was played on the Royal Agricultural Society Ground to a sell-out crowd of 20,000. Played under rugby union rules, the All Blacks led 6–0 at halftime and closed out the match, winning 12–8. The game was deemed to be a great success, as the organisers had not expected more than 12,000 people. The second game, a mid- week game, was held in front of a crowd of 3,000. The All Golds, who had made several changes, defeated the \\"All Blues\\" 19–5. They then won the third match of the series 5–3 in front of a crowd of 8,000. Ed Fry played in all three matches and along with the other Australian rebel players was promptly blacklisted by the New South Wales Rugby Union for breaching its fundamental principle of amateurism.  Rugby league career  Along with Billy Cann, Arthur Hennessy, S. G. \\"George\\" Ball and John J McGrath, Fry was one of five founders of the South Sydney District Rugby League Football Club, attending meetings in October 1907. In 1908 Fry played for the Rabbitohs in the inaugural NSWRFL season,W 'Son' Fry at rabbitohs.com.au and was a member of the run-on side in South's first-ever game on 20 April 1908 (Easter Monday) at Birchgrove Oval against North Sydney.Whiticker/Collis p12 He played nine games at centre that season, scoring two tries and was a member of the club's first premiership winning team, playing in the August 1908 final against Eastern Suburbs.

It inhabits mixed and deciduous forests. The population of Callipogon relictus is decreasing due to deforestation and uncontrolled collection, and therefore the species are listed in the Russian Red Book (category II). The larvae of Callipogon relictus develop in the drying deciduous trees. The process takes 4 to 6 years, and the same tree can be populated by larvae several times a year. Larvae bring along spores of the fungus Pleurotus citrinopileatus, that contributes to degradation of the tree. With the length reaching up to , Callipogon relictus is the largest beetle of Russia. Larvae of different longhorn beetles can coexist in the same tree, such as Callipogon relictus, Rosalia coelestis, Leptura thoracica, Rhabdoclytus acutivittis, Anoplodera cyanea and several other species. Systematics The beetle is a relict and the sole representative of the tropical genus Callipogon in the fauna of the Old World – other species of this genus inhabit Central and South Americas. The divergence between Callipogon relictus and other species in the genus is estimated to have occurred around 34 million years ago, around the Eocene/Oligocene boundary, during the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum. Callipogon relictus was described in 1898 by the Russian entomologist Andrey Semyonov-Tyan-Shansky (who wrote his last name as Semyonov until 1906). He distinguished the new species from the other species of the genus by the following features: * Extended rear part, that makes antennae shorter relative to the body size, * Shorter and almost hairless upper jaws * Edges of the prothorax are not jagged but bear spines, * Eyes are closer together. These features were later interpreted as a sign of higher evolutionary development of Callipogon relictus compared to other species of its genus, but a more recent phylogenetic study found that the species is nested within the phylogeny of the genus, being closely related to species found from Colombia to Mexico. Distribution In Russia Callipogon relictus inhabits Amur Oblast, to the south and south-east of the town Raychikhinsk. It is also common in the Khingan and Norsk reserves, in the south of Khabarovsk Krai (south from Khabarovsk city), Jewish Autonomous Oblast and Primorsky Krai. The northernmost observation was reported near the village of Ekimchan in Amur Oblast. Outside Russia the beetle occurs in Northeast China, North Korea and South Korea.Byun, BK et al. (2006). Research Report on a Natural Monument, Callipogon relictus Semenov in the Gwangneung Forest, Korea. Korea National Arboretum. p. 46 It is expected that its distribution will increase to the north with climate change. Description =Adults= Jacobson \\"Beetles of Russia, Western Europe and adjacent countries\\", 1905–1916. Developed body (imago) is black, with brown elytra and brown-black feet; there are two pairs of bright spots of hair on pronotum. The size and shape of jaws and antennae varies among individuals. Antennae are dotted and rather long. Their first segment is short and thickened. The third segment is extended and is longer than the fourth and fifth segments combined. The fourth segment is equal or slightly longer than the fifth, and the 11th segment is longer than the first. The lower parts of third to tenth segments have spines. Mandibles are two- toothed and are very large in males, longer than the head; they are much shorter in females. The upper side of the jaw is covered with coarse, wrinkled punctation, and the lower jaw and lower lip have thick shaggy orange felt. Pronotum is convex, with narrow spines on its sides; the spines are longer in females than males. Scutellum is densely covered with yellowish hairs. Elytra are very long, spotted and rounded at their top; they are more shining in males than in females. =Larvae, egg and pupa= Larvae are white, with black mandibles; the front half of pronotum has a transverse red stripe, which can have four narrow grooves. Larval body is massive, yellowish-white and covered with sparse, fine yellowish hairs. The head is strongly retracted into prothorax, epistoma is well delimited. Frontal sutures are distinct, longitudinal edges are sharply defined. Hypostome consists of two longitudinal sclerites, which are moved apart by the protruding regularly plate. Clypeus is small, transverse, whitish. Pronotum covers much of the head. The shield of pronotum is smooth at its front, and its back is densely covered with wrinkles. Thoracic legs are short, with long claws, covered with thick bristles. The egg has an oval shape and is long. It is pink in the early stage, then darkens and turns black. The chorion of the egg has deep, thick, slightly faceted cells. The gaps between the cells are smaller than the cells themselves. Pupa has a sturdy body, antennae are pressed to the sides. A narrow longitudinal groove runs in the middle of pronotum. Abdomen is broad, strongly narrowed to the top. Abdominal tergites are protruding and covered in short thick spines. Lifestyle Callipogon relictus inhabits mixed and deciduous forests. It is unknown whether it inhabits temperate coniferous forests, but the beetles were sometimes found in coniferous plantations. Larva feeds on rotten wood, and the adults drink juice, which protrudes from the trunks of linden, elm and other trees. In captivity, one female could drink up to of sugar syrup at once. Adults are active during the day; in the night they fly to the light sources. During the day, females fly more than males and therefore are encountered more frequently. Larvae develop in such trees as Japanese elm, Manchurian Ash, Tilia amurensis and Populus maximowiczii; they rarely occupy Mongolian oak, sawtooth oak, Siberian elm, Japanese elm, Betula costata, Carpinus laxiflora and Manchurian maple. Entomopathogenic fungus of the form Metarhizium anisopliae (Clavicipitaceae family) is deadly for a variety of insects, including the adult Callipogon relictus. Reproduction Females reach a length of , and the males are long. Females emit a special secretion to attract a partner. Mating occurs on the tree which serves as a feeding ground for larvae, below the place where the female will lay eggs; copulation lasts up to an hour. After mating the male does not leave female. Instead, he places front legs on the elytra of the female and they together climb the tree up to where the female will lay eggs. Eggs are laid by one or in groups on the bark of trees with a trunk diameter of . Over a lifetime (adult beetles live up to a month), a female can produce up to 28 eggs. After the female has laid eggs, the couple crawls down tree and dies on the ground. Newborn larvae dig under the bark making corridors up to long and wide. They then delve into wood to a depth of creating a network of tunnels there. One tree is re-populated several times and therefore usually contains larvae of different ages; only completely dried out trees are suitable for larva development. If a dry tree branch breaks from the tree with the larvae inside, the larvae stays inside the branch, but produces smaller adults than usual. Larvae live through 4–6 winters. After the last overwintering, they make large cradles () oriented perpendicular to the trunk, separated from the tree surface by about . Then the larva turns in the cradle with its head toward the trunk surface and pupates. Pupation occurs in June–July during 20–35 days and the pupa growth up to long. Females exit cradles a few days before males. In popular culture In 1911–1913, the Russian entomologist O. I. Ion wrote a satirical poem \\"Importunate insects\\" (), dedicated to Andrey Semyonov-Tyan- Shansky and Callipogon relictus, the longhorn beetle he described . Callipogon relictus is also depicted on the badge of the Ussuri Reserve.

Life The brother of Francesco Bonsignori, he was born at Verona. At an early period in his life he became a monk of the order of the Dominicans, and in the church of his monastery he executed some altar-pieces. He at first studied the works of Mantegna, but in his later productions he followed the style of Fiesole. He produced some excellent copies of some of the paintings of Leonardo da Vinci, notably, one of the Last Supper, pronounced by Lanzi the best copy ever made of it. It was originally in the library of San Benedetto at Mantua. At the end of the 17th century on in the early 18th century it was bought by Count d'Espagnac and led to the Abbey of Santa Maria della Vangadizza in Badia Polesine, Veneto, where it remained until 1982 when the last heir of the D'Espagnac, Michel de Rostolan, sold it to the town of Badia Polesine, now restored and in excellent condition is preserved in the museum civic Barufaldi, Badia Polesine. In the style of Leonardo he also painted a St. John, which is now in the Zecca at Milan. Among his early paintings there is, besides the altar-piece, a Last Supper in the Dominican monastery, and a Madonna in fresco in Santa Anastasia at Verona. He died of the plague at Mantua. Another brother of Francesco, Fra Cherubino Bonsignori, excelled in miniature painting.

Other than that, little is known about his early days in Constantinople, the Ottoman capital. During the reign of Murat IV, he was a member of palace staff. The shah of Iran had sent Murat IV a prestigious gift, a bow which was reputed as being undrawable. Hüseyin attracted attention when he easily drew the bow. After winning sultan's appreciation, he was promoted to various posts: chief stable man, governor of Silistria in (now in modern Bulgaria), beylerbey (high governor) of Egypt, beylerbey of Anatolia, Kapudan Pasha, etc. He participated in campaigns around Baghdad in modern Iraq and Yerevan (now in modern Armenia). During the reign of Ibrahim I, he served in various European provinces as a governor, and in 1646, he became the governor of Chania, Crete (now in Greece).

He was reportedly a cruel and violent governor who murdered for sport. From the very first day of his arrival in Egypt, when he confiscated his finance minister and advisors' temporary tents for his own, Hüseyin Pasha began a series of actions that made him widely disliked by the local populace. He brought with him to Egypt a large number of Druzes, who committed robberies in Cairo, the capital, and his men extorted money from the locals for an upcoming feast celebrating his arrival. Hüseyin Pasha was also involved in stealing wealthy locals' inheritances, so much so that it became a reliable way to exact revenge on an enemy by reporting to the Pasha that he or she had received an inheritance from a relative. He also often reportedly rode a horse through crowds of people and animals, swinging a sword, for recreation. Each month, he forced locals to trade in their bullion coin for adulterated metal and sent bureaucrats and officials to remote locations for sport. During his rule, he had over 1,200 people executed, not including those that he killed by his own hand. Despite his cruelty, Hüseyin Pasha was an able commander and leader of the local troops, which was a particularly difficult task in Egypt. He was attentive to government details in the divan and successfully decreased robbery and burglary in Egypt. After his dismissal from office in 1637, sultan Murad IV demanded of him an audit of the Egyptian provincial treasury and public revenues, and for him to pay what he owed to the treasury. When he refused, the kaymakam (acting governor) who replaced him until the arrival of his successor jailed Hüseyin, and he was freed only when he paid a large sum.  Cretan War  Conquest of the Aegean island Crete from Venice was uncharacteristically trying for Ottoman Empire. While the Ottoman Empire was in stagnation, the military and naval technology of the Europeans was on the rise. Although Chania, a major Cretan city, had been captured in 1645, the rest of the island, especially Heraklion, was able to resist the Ottomans. The Ottoman Empire was unable to send reinforcements to Crete because the strait of Dardanelles (Çanakkale) was blocked by the Venetian navy. (see Cretan War (1645–1669)) Thus, the Ottoman army in Crete was deadlocked. Even under these circumstances, Hüseyin captured several forts including RethymnoJoseph von Hammer: Osmanlı Tarihi cilt II (condensation: Abdülkadir Karahan), Milliyet yayınları, İstanbul. p 238 and laid a siege to Heraklion. He also reconstructed many buildings and the fort of Chania. Sultan Mehmet IV promoted him to be the grand vizier on 28 February 1656.Prof. Yaşar Yüce-Prof. Ali Sevim: Türkiye tarihi Cilt III, AKDTYKTTK Yayınları, İstanbul, 1991 p 139-145 However he never exercised the post. Long before Huseyin's return to Constantinople, the sultan changed his mind and appointed Hüseyin's rival Zurnazen Mustafa Pasha as grand vizier on 6 March 1656 (although Zurnazen's term was even shorter than that of Hüseyin).  Later years  Hüseyin was assigned to be the beylerbey (governor) of Rumeli, a post inferior to that of grand vizier, but superior to those of the beylerbeys of other provinces. Nevertheless, the new grand vizier Köprülü Mehmet Pasha was afraid of Hüseyin's prestige.Mevlüt Uluğtekin Yılmaz: Osmanlı'nın Arka Bahçesi, MUY Yayınları, Ankara, pp 162-164 He called Hüseyin to Constantinople and persuaded the sultan to jail and later to execute Hüseyin in 1659.

He painted genre pictures in the style of the latter, representing subjects by candlelight, but met with such encouragement in portrait painting that he devoted himself almost wholly to that branch of art. His style was well adapted to succeed in it. An excellent oolourist, a faithful designer of his model, and highly skilled, he was soon distinguished as one of the ablest artists of his day. He painted a great number of portraits of the most distinguished people of his time, among whom were Peter the Great, the Elector of Mentz, the Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt, the Prince and Princess of Orange, the great Duke of Marlborough, and several others. He painted some large pictures for the halls of the different companies at Amsterdam and Dordrecht. He died in 1729.

It is a late Neoclassical style red brick and cast stone structure. It stands tall, and its exterior dimensions are deep and wide. Its interior dimensions are approximately by , or approximately . Steep, narrow, internal stairways leading to the upper floors occupy roughly 25 percent of the interior area. Reportedly the result of a fraudulent investment scheme by a confidence man, the Newby–McMahon Building was a source of great embarrassment to the city and its residents after its completion in 1919. During the 1920s, the Newby–McMahon Building was featured in Robert Ripley's Ripley's Believe It or Not! syndicated column as \\"the world's littlest skyscraper,\\" a nickname that has stuck with it ever since. The Newby–McMahon Building is now part of the Depot Square Historic District of Wichita Falls, a Texas Historic Landmark. Background A large petroleum reservoir was discovered just west of the city of Burkburnett, a small town in Wichita County, Texas in 1912. Burkburnett and its surrounding communities became boomtowns, experiencing explosive growth of their populations and economies. By 1918, an estimated 20,000 new settlers had taken up residence around the lucrative oil field, and many Wichita County residents became wealthy virtually overnight. As people streamed into the local communities in search of high-paying jobs, the nearby city of Wichita Falls began to grow in importance. Though it initially lacked the necessary infrastructure for this sudden increase in economic and industrial activity, Wichita Falls was a natural choice to serve as the local logistical hub, being the seat of Wichita County. Because office space was lacking, major stock transactions and mineral rights deals were conducted on street corners and in tents that served as makeshift headquarters for the new oil companies. Proposal and blueprints The Newby–McMahon Building is a four-story brick building located near the railroad depot in downtown Wichita Falls, built in 1906 by Augustus Newby (1855–1909), a director of the Wichita Falls and Oklahoma City Railway Company. The oil-rig construction firm of J.D. McMahon, a petroleum landman and structural engineer from Philadelphia, was one of seven tenants whose offices were based in the original Newby Building. According to local legend, when McMahon announced in 1919 that he would build a high-rise annex to the Newby Building as a solution to the newly wealthy city's urgent need for office space, investors were eager to invest in the project. McMahon collected US$200,000 (equivalent to $2,927,876.16 in 2020) in investment capital from this group of naïve investors, promising to construct a high-rise office building across the street from the St. James Hotel. The key to McMahon's swindle, and his successful defense in the ensuing lawsuit was that legal documents listed the height as 480\\" as opposed to 480'. Investors didn't seem to notice, and McMahon never verbally stated that the actual height of the building would be . The proposed skyscraper depicted in the blueprints that he distributed (and which were approved by the investors) was clearly labeled as consisting of four floors and . Construction and ensuing legal battle McMahon used his own construction crews to build the McMahon Building on the small, unused piece of property next to the Newby Building, without obtaining prior consent from the owner of the property, who lived in Oklahoma. Investors brought a lawsuit against McMahon over the size of the building, but to their dismay, the real estate and construction deal was declared legally binding by a local judge. They did recover a small portion of their investment from the elevator company, which refused to honor the contract after learning how small the building was. No stairway was installed in the building upon its initial completion, as none was included in the original blueprints. Rather, a ladder was employed to gain access to the upper three floors. By the time construction was complete, McMahon had left Wichita Falls and perhaps even Texas, taking with him the balance of the investors' money. Early occupancy and subsequent abandonment Upon its completion and opening in 1919, the Newby–McMahon Building was an immediate source of great embarrassment to the city and its residents. The ground floor had six desks representing the six different companies that occupied the building as its original tenants. Throughout most of the 1920s, the building housed only two firms. During the 1920s, the Newby–McMahon Building was featured in Robert Ripley's Ripley's Believe It or Not! syndicated column as \\"the world's littlest skyscraper\\", which is a name that has stuck with it ever since. The oil industry would ultimately prove to be a resource curse to Wichita Falls, and the Texas Oil Boom ended only a few years later. The building was vacated, boarded up, and virtually forgotten in 1929 as the Great Depression struck North Texas and office space became relatively inexpensive to lease or purchase. A fire gutted the building in 1931, rendering it unusable for a number of years. After the Great Depression, the building housed a succession of tenants, including barber shops and cafés. The building changed hands many times and was scheduled for demolition on several occasions, but escaped this fate apparently because a sufficient number of local residents came to its defense. It was eventually deeded to the city of Wichita Falls. As the building continued to deteriorate, in 1986 the city gave the building to the Wichita County Heritage Society (WCHS), with the hope that it would eventually be restored, making it a viable part of the Depot Square Historic District. Purchase and renovation By 1999, the Newby–McMahon Building had proved to be an excessive burden on the limited capital reserves of the WCHS. The following year, the city council hired the local architectural firm of Bundy, Young, Sims & Potter to stabilize the crumbling structure, amid steadily growing talk of demolishing the building. Dick Bundy and his partners became fascinated with the history and legacy of the building; they arranged a partnership with Marvin Groves Electric, another local business, to purchase the building. In December 2000, the city council voted to allow the WCHS to sell the building to Marvin Groves for . On June 11, 2003, a storm swept through Wichita Falls, bringing gusts of wind as strong as . A section of brick wall from the McMahon Building complex was knocked down. The damage from this storm was repaired, but full restoration of the building and the adjacent Newby Building was delayed until late 2005. In June of that year, the City Council granted $25,000 (equivalent to $33,041.59 in 2020) in funds from the city's tax increment financing fund, to be invested in the restoration of the McMahon Building. Restoration of the building is estimated to have cost more than $254,000 (equivalent to $336,200.95 in 2020), the remainder of which was paid by the owners (Bundy, Young, Sims & Potter, Inc., and Marvin Groves Electric). Current status The Newby–McMahon Building and the Hello Again! storefront in October 2015 Plaque attached to the Newby–McMahon Building, also known as the \\"world's littlest skyscraper\\". This plaque refers to the building adjacent to the \\"skyscraper\\" which was completed in 1906, the \\"skyscraper\\" building was completed in 1919. The Newby–McMahon Building has survived tornadoes, a fire, and decades of neglect. The building is currently part of the Depot Square Historic District of Wichita Falls, which has been declared a Texas Historic Landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The building has never met the criteria for the definition of a skyscraper, nor even that of a \\"high-rise\\" building. After its renovation, the building was home to an antiques dealership, the Antique Wood, which opened in 2006 on the ground floor. Since 2013, besides being a local tourist attraction, a furniture and home décor consignment boutique, Hello Again has occupied the entire building.

August Stauch (15 January 1878 – 6 May 1947) was a German prospector who discovered a diamond deposits near Lüderitz, in German South West Africa (now Namibia). August Stauch was the third of seven children of a railway worker's family in Ettenhausen, Thuringia. He was a railway employee in Thuringia. Stauch arrived in Lüderitz in 1907. He suffered from asthma and received medical advice that the drier desert climate may be suitable for his health. He took up mineralogy as a hobby in his spare time but later worked as a Bahnmeister (chief railway foreman) on the Lüderitzbucht-Aus railway line. August developed a fascination for diamonds, after listening to the tales about Adolf Lüderitz, who believed there lay diamonds in the desert and obtained a prospecting license from Deutsche Kolonialgesellschaft fur Südwest Afrika. He consequently informed his workers, who had been brought in from South Africa because of their experience in railroad workings, to look out for unusually shiny stones. On 10 April 1908 Zacharias Lewala, one of his aides who had previously worked at a diamond mine in Kimberley, picked up a diamond near Grasplatz and dutifully took brought it to him.Namibia 1-on-1 Lüderitz diamond rush Stauch quietly resigned from his job after confirming his suspicion that this may be a diamond, by scratching his glass watch with the stone. He found more pretty stones after a systematic search of the area and took them to his friend, mining engineer Sönke Nissen who lived in Lüderitz, where they were confirmed to be diamonds in June 1908. These diamonds had flushed through the Orange River into the sea millions of years ago where the wind and waves washed it back in the sand of the Namib. The South West African diamonds are usually not very large, but clear like water and thus very popular on the market. Stauch and Nissen initially kept the knowledge of the find to themselves, and only announced it after securing a 75-acre claim at Kolmanskop in order to continue to do diamond searching. Both were declared very wealthy men at the time. A diamond rush set in, and the German government took immediate interest in the activities at Lüderitz, and dispatched the Secretary For The Colonies to investigate the situation and bring order and control to the industry. A diamond taxation system was introduced and the issuing of licenses was limited which brought about some order to the industry. The town of Lüderitz observed an economic boom between 1908 and 1914 and was temporarily known as Africa’s richest town. Stauch tried to increase his wealth further and invested in many companies - both in the colony and in Germany. However in 1931, he lost most of his wealth through various misfortunes and the Great Depression. He returned to Eisenach and died on 6 May 1947 of stomach cancer.

The coup ultimately failed, with senior military officers opposed to the programme installing the elected Vice President as President, and imprisoning coup leaders.Zamosc, Leon (2007), \\"The Indian Movement and Political Democracy in Ecuador\\", Latin American Politics and Society, 49.3. pp1-34 Background There was a severe economic crisis in Ecuador (including the 1998–99 Ecuador banking crisis), which had led to a 60% cut in the armed forces budget. There were also concerns about corruption. Mahuad's popularity rating had fallen from 60% in October 1998 to 6% in January 2000. In the early days of 2000, Mahuad announced the dollarization of the economy of Ecuador, along with a number of International Monetary Fund measures.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8edqKD1qUEhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VrjrrL9e1y8 Coup In response to the economic plans \\"Indian crowds flocked to Quito demanding Mahuad's dismissal and occupying Congress and the Supreme Court.\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPCbBt1TYR0https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQi2KAeW__s On 21 January 2000 Lucio Gutiérrez and CONAIE President Antonio Vargas declared a \\"government of national salvation\\". This led to \\"frantic consultations among generals, politicians, and US diplomats\\", and ultimately saw senior military officers install Vice President Gustavo Noboa as President and arrest the coup leaders. During the coup, there was little mobilisation against it, and a survey showed widespread popular support for CONAIE's occupation of Congress, which had allowed the military to call for Mahuad's resignation. However, there was little public support for military rule, a fact senior military officers conducting the negotiations during the coup were aware of. The military's senior officers opposed the coalition's plans, and had close ties with the country political and economic elite, who also opposed them (such as influential former president and then-Mayor of Guayaquil León Febres Cordero).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnXJk3vrC0c They were also influenced by threats of US economic sanctions. In addition, the role of junior officers in the coup was seen as a subversion of the military hierarchy, and Chief of the Military High Command, General Carlos Mendoza, said that the generals could not accept Lieutenant Colonel Lucio Gutiérrez as a ruling junta's military representative. There were negotiations about replacing Gutiérrez with Mendoza, but shortly after the junta accepted this, \\"Mendoza hijacked the coup and put an end to it by handing power over to the vice president of the country.\\" Aftermath Gutiérrez was imprisoned for four months, and then expelled from the army. He ran for President in the 2002 general elections and was elected, taking office in January 2003, but his support collapsed after introducing various neoliberal economic measures in order to satisfy international lenders, being himself ousted after a popular revolt in April 2005, which saw the third and final overthrow (to date) of a democratically elected government.Associated Press, 20 April 2005, Ousted President Was Behind 2000 Coup This recently turbulent period of Ecuadorian history ended with the 2006 election of Rafael Correa, an academic outsider who opposed and condemned the practices of traditional parties, political and economical elites, while moving a leftist, anti-neoliberal and populist agenda which since 2007 has seen an increase in public spending, a new Constitution, social programs and an anti-imperialist foreign policy aligned with the socialism of the 21st century, despite accusations of curtailing freedoms, particularly speech and press.BBC News, 28 May 2013, Ecuador: Stability but at what price?

It was also called the Grand Rand Show, when it was held a few weeks outside of Easter in the late 1980s . History The show was first held at the Old Wanderers cricket ground in November 1894 by the Witwatersrand Agricultural Society, a society that had formed in March of the same year. The second show was opened by Paul Kruger on 13 March 1895, at a venue called Milner Park, which is today the site of the University of the Witwatersrand's West Campus. It was held again in 1896 and reestablished subsequent to the end of the Anglo Boer War, in 1907. In 1936, the Rand Show was called the Empire Exhibition. The eleven-day show was historically an agricultural exhibition for all South Africans where livestock, poultry, yearlings, farm products and equipment were shown and judged with prizes awarded in the form of Gold and Silver medals. In later years it also featured industrial and commercial exhibitions and would eventually attract foreign participants who would exhibit country pavilions. Other annual exhibitors included Military Tattoos, the South African Defence Force,the South African Police as well as show-jumping competitions.

It attempts to map real-world structures in a geographically accurate way. Mirror worlds offer a utilitarian software model of real human environments and their workings.Roush, W. Second Earth, Technology Review, Juli/ August 2007: p. 10 The term differs from virtual worlds in that these have no direct connections to real models and thus are described as fictions, while mirror worlds are connected to real models and lie nearer to non-fiction. It's closely related to Augmented Reality but a mirror world can be seen as an autonomous manifestation of digitized reality including virtual elements or other forms in which information is embedded. The term in relation to digital media is coined by Yale University computer scientist David Gelernter. He first speaks of a hypothetical mirror world in 1991.Gelernter, D. Mirror Worlds: The Day Software Puts the Universe In a Shoebox... How it Will Happen and What It Will Mean?, 1991. Open geo-coding standards allow users to contribute to mirror worlds. Thus it's possible to make one's own geographical data appear as a new \\"layer\\" on one's computer's copy of a mirror world. Examples Programs such as Google Earth and Microsoft Virtual Earth are examples of 3D mirror worlds.

Maarten, Baron van der Goes van Dirxland (3 January 1751, The Hague - 10 July 1826, The Hague) was a Dutch politician who served as government minister. He was a moderate within the Patriots faction that came to govern the Batavian Republic. His son Louis Napoleon van der Goes van Dirxland was also active as a minister. Life Van der Goes came from a family of regenten in The Hague and his father, Adriaan van der Goes, was the town's mayor. Maarten van der Goes entered the diplomatic service in 1785, in which he was sent to Copenhagen, then Madrid from 1793 to 1796. He was then secretary to the second national assembly of the Batavian Republic and became its foreign minister on 8 October 1798. At the end of July 1803, Van der Goes, Gerard Brantsen and Jan Bernd Bicker formed a Batavian deputation sent to Napoleon Bonaparte at Brussels, where Bonaparte was visiting the French departments in what is now Belgium. Van der Goes remained foreign minister until 19 June 1808. During May 1807, he was also the interim minister for justice and the police. After France's annexation of Holland in 1810, Van der Goes entered the First French Empire's Corps législatif as the representative of the department of Bouches-de-la-Meuse. He was made Grand Treasurer of the Order of the Reunion on 22 February 1813 and a baron de l'Empire on 27 January 1813. Maarten van der Goes returned to the Netherlands on Napoleon's fall and became a faithful supporter of the new king William I of the Netherlands, who ennobled him in 1814 and made him a baron in 1821. Van der Goes entered the Senate on 21 September 1815, remaining in it until his death in 1826.

Evasions are typically used to counter network-based intrusion detection and prevention systems (IPS, IDS) but can also be used to by-pass firewalls and defeat malware analysis. A further target of evasions can be to crash a network security device, rendering it in- effective to subsequent targeted attacks. Description Evasions can be particularly nasty because a well-planned and implemented evasion can enable full sessions to be carried forth in packets that evade an IDS. Attacks carried in such sessions will happen right under the nose of the network and service administrators. The security systems are rendered ineffective against well-designed evasion techniques, in the same way a stealth fighter can attack without detection by radar and other defensive systems. A good analogy to evasions is a system designed to recognize keywords in speech patterns on a phone system, such as “break into system X”. A simple evasion would be to use a language other than English, but which both parties can still understand, and wishfully a language that as few people as possible can talk. Evasion attacks Various advanced and targeted evasion attacks have been known since the mid-1990s: * A seminal text describing the attacks against IDS systems appeared in 1997.50 Ways to Defeat Your Intrusion Detection System * One of the first comprehensive description of attacks was reported by Ptacek and Newsham in a technical report in 1998.Ptacek, Newsham: Insertion, Evasion, and Denial of Service: Eluding Network Intrusion Detection, Technical report, 1998. * In 1998, also an article in the Phrack Magazine describes ways to by- pass network intrusion detection.Defeating Sniffers and Intrusion Detection Systems Reports The 1997 article mostly discusses various shell-scripting and character-based tricks to fool an IDS. The Phrack Magazine article and the technical report from Ptacek et al. discusses TCP/IP protocol exploits, evasions and others. More recent discussions on evasions include the report by Kevin Timm.IDS Evasion Techniques and Tactics Protecting against evasions The challenge in protecting servers from evasions is to model the end-host operation at the network security device, i.e., the device should be able to know how the target host would interpret the traffic, and if it would be harmful, or not. A key solution in protecting against evasions is traffic normalization at the IDS/IPS device.M. Handley, V. Paxson, C. Kreibich, Network intrusion detection: evasion, traffic normalization, and end-to-end protocol semantics, Usenix Security Symposium, 2001. Lately there has been discussions on putting more effort on research in evasion techniques. A presentation at Hack.lu discussed some potentially new evasion techniques and how to apply multiple evasion techniques to by-pass network security devices.

Jan Bernd Bicker (27 August 1746, Amsterdam – 16 December 1812, Wassenaar) was a Dutch merchant, politician and a very powerful member of the Bicker family. After studying law and philosophy at the University of Amsterdam, he settled in Amsterdam and became a successful merchant. He served as an alderman of Amsterdam and as an administrator of the Amsterdam branch of the Dutch West India Company (W.I.C.). Bicker was opposed to the House of Orange and supported the Patriots, a liberal group that wanted to curtail the power of the Stadtholder. A political conservative, he disliked the democrats within the Patriotic movement. Because of his opposition to the Stadtholder, he was forced to leave the country when the latter, with the help of the Prussian Army, removed the Patriots from power. Bicker settled in Brussels and later in France. In France he contacted other leading members of the Patriotic movement who left the Dutch Republic in 1787. Together they formed a Revolutionary Committee. Bicker and the other Patriots returned to the Dutch Republic after the French had occupied the country in 1795. The Dutch Republic was renamed Bataafse Republiek (Batavian Republic). Bicker was elected a member of the National Assembly and belonged to more conservative Moderaten, or moderates. Despite his conservative leanings he opposed slavery and supported some reforms. He was a member of the Batavian Republic's executive organ, the Staatsbewind, from 1803 to 1805. He played no role during the Kingdom of Holland (1806–1811). He retired from the public scene and lived at his estate Oosterbeek at Wassenaar. He kept ornamental birds and grew pineapples. He died at Wassenaar on 16 December 1812, age 66. Family Physionotrace of Catharina Six (1752–1793) who married Bicker on 23 May 1769 in Amsterdam.

Its name can perhaps be translated as \\"the field (cae) of the smith\\". The village lies in the parish of Berse, whose name has the same origin as the nearby village of Bersham.Berse, GENUKI The name, still sometimes applied to the area of Caego, was originally that of a common and later came to apply to the whole township of Berse or Bersham; it may be based on an Old English personal name or on the Middle English word \\"berse\\", meaning a hedge of osiers.Palmer, A.

Many of the pre-World War II houses were built by the brothers, Evan and Robert Thomas Williams. The village's main landmark is the small eighteenth-century Berse (or Berse Drelincourt) Parish Church, which is now Grade II listed.

One important figure in recent times was John Carter (1889-1962), editor of The Christadelphian from 1937 to 1962. By his speaking and writing he was able to bring together many of these diversified groups and draw them into a more cohesive movement. \\" Carter was the third editor of the Christadelphian after the founding editor Robert Roberts and his successor Charles Curwen Walker. He was the first editor of the magazine to be an employee of the Christadelphian Magazine and Publishing Association (CMPA), which Walker had established before his death to ensure a stable continuation. For most of the period 1937 to 1962 Carter worked to promote a broader range of content in the magazine, more outreach publications, and set in motion a series of New Testament Commentaries of which he himself wrote several volumes. In 1938 he was the representative of the church in front of military tribunals.Bryan R. Wilson Sects and Society 1961 p236 \\"In 1936 the possibility of a re-introduction of conscription induced the Christadelphians to set up a Military Service Committee, which compiled a register and collected literature for the use of the authorities, principally to establish the fact that conscientious objection was no new doctrine within the movement. In 1938 steps were taken to inform the government of the Christadelphian position, and, on the introduction of compulsory service, Carter, as editor of the magazine, represented the sect before the military service tribunals. There was this time no prominent brother, such as Jannaway in the Great War, to expend time and money on these matters. It was now a subject for official action, and the acknowledged leading brother was thus expected to state the Christadelphian case. Once again the movement evolved agencies contrary to its own organisational tenets to meet the exigencies of an external situation. Exemption was fairly easily obtained in most cases, but, as before, virtually identical cases received very differing treatment from different tribunals. But, this time at least, less than a score of brethren were made to suffer prison for their consciences, as against ‘scores’ in the First World War.\\" The Reunions On its establishment by Walker the magazine's Association (CMPA) had initially been viewed with some suspicion by many Christadelphians who traditionally had been opposed to any body other than the independent local congregations.this pertains also to the Auxiliary Lecturing Society and CYCs see Wilson Sects and society 1961 p257 261 However, after the Second World War, and with the backing of the managing committee Carter increasingly put his energies into trying to heal the succession of divisions which had hampered the Christadelphian body since 1885, 1898 and 1923. Although Birmingham had in many ways been the heartland of the Christadelphian church's development in the 19th Century, when Carter took over from Walker in 1937 the \\"Central\\" grouping, or Temperance Hall Fellowship accounted for only half of Christadelphians worldwide. In Birmingham itself many Christadelphians adhered to the \\"Suffolk Street\\" grouping of which Thomas Turner was editor of the Fraternal Visitor magazine. Although the position of editor carried no formal authority Carter was frequently invited to speak at Bible Schools in North America and Australia.Charles H.

Described by Frederick Charles Lincoln in 1930, it is also sometimes known as the Lincoln-Petersen method after C.G. Johannes Petersen who was the first to use the related mark and recapture method.Southwood, T.R.E. & Henderson, P. (2000) Ecological Methods, 3rd edn. Blackwell Science, Oxford. Applications Consider two observers who separately count the different species of plants or animals in a given area. If they each come back having found 100 species but only 5 particular species are found by both observers, then each observer clearly missed at least 95 species (that is, the 95 that only the other observer found). Thus, we know that both observers miss a lot. On the other hand, if 99 of the 100 species each observer found had been found by both, it is fair to expect that they have found a far higher percentage of the total species that are there to find. The same reasoning applies to mark and recapture. If some animals in a given area are caught and marked, and later a second round of captures is done: the number of marked animals found in the second round can be used to generate an estimate of the total population. Another example arises in computational linguistics for estimating the total vocabulary of a language. Given two independent samples, the overlap between their vocabularies enables a useful estimate of how many more vocabulary items exist but did not happen to show up in either sample. A similar example involves estimating the number of typographical errors remaining in a text, from two proofreaders' counts. Formulation The Lincoln Index formalizes this phenomenon. If E1 and E2 are the number of species (or words, or other phenomena) observed by two independent methods, and S is the number of observations in common, then the Lincoln Index is simply L={E_1 E_2 \\\\over S}. For values of S < 10, this estimate is rough, and becomes extremely rough for values of S < 5\\\\. In the case where S = 0 (that is, there is no overlap at all) the Lincoln Index is formally undefined. This can arise if the observers only find a small percentage of the actual species (perhaps by not looking hard enough or long enough), if the observers are using methods that are not statistically independent (for example if one looks only for large creatures and the other only for small), or in other circumstances. Limitations The Lincoln Index is merely an estimate. For example, the species in a given area could tend to be either very common or very rare, or tend to be either very hard or very easy to see. Then it would be likely that both observers would find a large share of the common species, and that both observers would miss a large share of the rare ones. Such distributions would throw off the consequent estimate. However, such distributions are unusual for natural phenomena, as suggested by Zipf's Law). T. J. Gaskell and B. J. George propose an enhancement of the Lincoln Index that claims to reduce bias.Gaskell and George (1972) See also * Sampling Theory * Drake equation * German tank problem * Inter-rater reliability Further reading Petersen, C.

It was established in 1811 and abolished in 1815. There were similar orders in the other states annexed by France, such as the Palatinate, Papal States, Tuscany and Piedmont, including the Order of the Lion of the Palatinate, the Order of the Golden Spur, the Cross of St John Lateran, the Cross of St Stephen, the Order of the Most Holy Annunciation and the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus. History It was set up on 11 or 18 October 1811 by Napoleon I, on his first visit to the Paleis op de Dam in Amsterdam after his 1810 annexation of the Kingdom of Holland to France. It was set up as an order of merit to replace Louis Bonaparte's Order of the Union. It had three ranks and Napoleon himself was its Grand Master. The knights of the order were authorised to bear their old decorations until 1 April or exchange them for ones of the new order. Within the First French Empire's hierarchy of orders it was second only to the Légion d'honneur, with the Order of the Iron Crown being the third in rank. Napoleon disliked the idea of a poor nobility and so assigned 500,000 francs annually to provide pensions to the order's members. In a letter to Jean Jacques Régis de Cambacérès, Napoleon wrote that an order with the motto \\"Bien faire et laisser dire\\" (\\"Do well and let say\\"), the motto of the Order of the Union, was not suited to a great empire, saying \\"We must look for a motto which gives a sense of the advantages of the union of the Baltic, Mediterranean, Adriatic and the [Atlantic] Ocean. This great event that truly characterises the Empire, could be called the Order of the Union.\\". Napoleon eventually occupied large territories in north-west Germany and the Illyrian provinces on the Dalmatian coast - the name of the order he founded referred to the fact that (for the first time since the Roman Empire) all access points to the sea were under the same authority. Napoleon reserved himself the exclusive right to exclude someone from the order or nominate them to it - Napoleon felt his brother Louis had been too generous in giving out medals. The order was headed by the Frenchman Jean-Baptiste de Nompère de Champagny as Grand Chancellor and the Dutchman Maarten van der Goes van Dirxland as Grand Treasurer and they and the order had a joint base in the Hôtel du Châtelet at Paris. The knights of the Order of the Reunion had the right to bear the title \\"Knight\\" and, when they enjoyed an annual income of 3,000 francs, could also receive letters of nobility making them and their descendants Knights of the Empire. Charles-François Lebrun, duc de Plaisance and Napoleon's representative in Amsterdam as 'Prins-stadhouder', oversaw the order and its membership numbers. Louis continued to wear ‘his’ Order of the Union throughout his life and old-established nobles did not receive the Order of the Reunion. The Dutch statesmen Godert van der Capellen, Anton Reinhard Falck and Vischer did not accept the Order of the Reunion, thinking it humiliating to the Netherlands. Van Capellen noted that “the [Order’s] oath was of such a nature to me that I forever refused it, with better opportunities to cooperate in restoring our independence. All the other Grand Crosses, Commanders and Knights of the Dutch Order of the Union thought the new Order was just [the Order of the Union] under a different name and signed up to it.”. Knights of the new Order were appointed right up to the end of the First Empire in 1814. On their initial restoration in 1814 the Bourbons neither abolished nor awarded the Order of the Reunion and Napoleon awarded it during the Hundred Days. On 28 July 1815 Louis XVIII of France abolished it, asking its knights to return their gold and silver badges to the chancellory of the Legion d’Honneur. Those returned included few from the Netherlands since the cross was the replacement for the Order of the Union and the Dutch – having seen their country looted and drained of manpower for so long by the French – were unwilling to send their gold and silver awards back to Paris. Numbers The target number of members for the order was at least 10,000 knights, 2,000 commanders and 500 grand cross members, though in the end it only reached 527 (59 from Holland), 90 (21 from Holland) and 64 (29 from Holland) respectively. According to a statement by Van der Goes Dirxland, 11 great crosses, 36 commanders’ crosses and 59 knights’ crosses were handed in and melted down. The French state replaced them, though it was usually paid for by the recipient himself, honouring the awards of the Order of the Reunion. An official statement said that by its end the order had been awarded 1,622 times, with 1,364 knights, 127 commanders and 131 Grand Crosses. 614 of these cases involved a foreigner, that is those who were not subjects of Napoleon. Since the order began as a replacement for the Order of the Union, 681 recipients had previously borne the Order of the Union, one third to one half of whom were Dutch. Decorations The medal of the Order of the Reunion was a gold enamelled twelve-pointed star with a ball on each point. Between each point was a bundle of golden spears. At its centre was a circle surrounded in gold and blue, encircled by a gold laurel wreath and bearing a gold ‘N’ on a gold ground. On the blue circle was written ‘A JAMAIS’ (forever). The reverse is similar to the obverse but bears an empty throne instead of the imperial monogram. In front of the throne is the Capitoline Wolf suckly Romulus and Remus. The throne is also surrounded by symbols of the lands annexed by France – a Florentine lily, a Dutch lion with a sheaf of nine arrows (symbol of the old Dutch Republic) supporting the throne, a Piedmontese coat of arms and two tridents symbolizing the ports of Hamburg and Genoa. On the surrounding circlet is ‘TOUT POUR L’EMPIRE’ (all for the Empire). On the front the medal was suspended from a closed crown and on the back by a diadem and blue ring bearing the words ‘FONDATEUR’ (founder) and ‘NAPOLEON’. These were both attached to a moiré-effect blue ribbon. There were two models of the Grand Cross star – a star bearing an embroidered Napoleonic crowned eagle on an oval with a shield and the empty throne, and a massive sterling silver plaque in the shape of the medal. The Second French Empire saw high demand for souvenirs from the First Empire and so new medals of the Orders of the Union and Reunion were produced. These are hard to distinguish from the originals, though the silver star is probably a mid-19th-century invention, since in 1811 the star was almost always worn in an embroidered form. * 1811 establishments in France Reunion Awards established in 1811 ","title":"Order of the Reunion"},{"id":"29068575","text":"Ludvig Andreas Lindström (born 22 September 1975 in Huskvarna, Sweden) is a Swedish animal rights activist, and the founder and President of Global Happiness Organization.

After the duke was guillotined in 1793, the house was inscribed on the list of civil buildings, and it served from 1796 to 1807 as the headquarters of the École nationale des ponts et chaussées. From 1807 to 1830, it was attached to the Imperial, and later Royal, Household. Between 1830 and 1849, it served as the Turkish embassy, and then the Austrian embassy. In 1849, Napoleon III's government paid for renovations and gave the building to the Archbishop of Paris whose palace had burned down in 1831. From 1849 to 1905, the building's main body served as the archiepiscopal residence. Upon the 1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State, the state took the building back, granting it in 1907 to what was then called the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare. Following restoration in 1908, it became the headquarters of the ministry. In 1968, it was the site of the signature of the Grenelle agreements.

Biography Mathurin Cherpitel was the son of a master carpenter who helped to build the Rue de Bourgogne in Paris. Cherpitel followed the teachings of Jacques Francois Blondel, and spent three years working as a draftsman for Ange-Jacques Gabriel, before winning the Prix de Rome in 1758. When he returned to Paris, he had difficulty finding work, but his father, who was employed in several projects in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, managed to find him employment. Around 1765, he was employed by François Dominique Barreau de Chefdeville, working on the Palais Bourbon. During this time, he also drafted plans for a reconstruction of the Hotel Locmaria on the Rue de l'Université for the Duke of Harcourt. In 1766, he participated in the competition for the reconstruction of the Hotel d'Uzes, on the Rue Montmartre, which was won by Claude Nicolas Ledoux. In 1768, he received his first commission: the Lieutenant General of Police, Antoine de Sartine, instructed him to build a nurses' bureau, on the Rue de Gramont. By 1770, he had become a famous architect. He built the Hotel du Chatelet on the Rue de Grenelle, and his most notable hôtels, the Hotel de Damas d'Antigny and the Hotel de Rochechouart. His most important public building was the , built in 1775, but destroyed in 1798 and later replaced with a new design.Cleary 1996.

The tree is not mentioned in either Elwes and Henry's or Bean'sBean, W. J. (1981). Trees and shrubs hardy in Great Britain, 7th edition. Murray, England. classic works on British trees. The earliest known references are Dutch and German, the first by de Vos in Handboek tot de praktische kennis der voornaamste boomen (1890). At about the same time, the tree was offered for sale by the Späth nursery of Berlin as Ulmus Wentworthi pendula Hort.Späth, L., Catalogue 79 (1890-91; Berlin), p.115Späth nursery, Catalogue 143, p. 135, 1910-11\\\\. Berlin, Germany. (see Etymology). The 'Hort.' in Späth's 1890 catalogue, without his customary label \\"new\\", confirms that the tree was by then in nurseries as a horticultural elm.John Frederick Wood, F.H.S., in The Midland Florist and Suburban Horticulturist (1851), 6:365, had described an U. Pendula Superba, 'The Superb Weeping Elm', \\"a really beautiful pendulous tree, with very large foliage, and weeping in the same style as the Weeping Ash\\". Wood's list distinguishes the tree from weeping wych; the very large leaves and Weeping Ash habit accord with those of 'Wentworthii Pendula'. De Vos, writing in 1889, states that the Supplement to Volume 1 includes entries announced since the main volume in 1887, putting the date of introduction between 1887 and 1889. De Vos suggested that the tree was a form of Ulmus × hollandica, a view accepted in the Ulmus names lists of Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew and Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh. At Kew, the cultivar was labelled Ulmus × hollandica 'Wentworthii'.Gerald Wilkinson, Epitaph for the Elm, Hutchinson, London 1978 ( / 0-09-921280-3) Melville dismissed the Kew specimen as Ulmus × hollandica 'Vegeta' (the lower branches of open-grown Huntingdon elms can also be pendulousJobling & Mitchell, 'Field Recognition of British Elms', Forestry Commission Booklet (HMSO 1974)), though Wentworth Elm differs strikingly in form, leaf and bark from Huntingdon. Richens and Rackham noted that examples of pendulous Ulmus × hollandica occur in the East Anglian hybridization zone.R. H. Richens, Elm (Cambridge 1983)Oliver Rackham, A History of the Countryside (London, 1986) At RBGE, Wentworth Elm (RBGE ref. no. 32931) was identified as a hybrid of the Huntingdon Elm and Plot's Elm. A Wageningen Arboretum herbarium leaf-specimen that appears identical to 'Wentworthii' (see 'External links') was labelled U. × hollandica 'Pendula'. Description A tall, conspicuously pendulous tree, bell-shaped when young, domed when older. The outer branchlets hang in long 'curtains', showing the 'bones' above the foliage rather like Ulmus glabra 'Horizontalis', with large deeply toothed hybrid leaves, some up to long.Photograph of 'Wentworth' leaves in Kew in Gerald Wilkinson, Epitaph for the Elm, Hutchinson, London 1978 ( / 0-09-921280-3) The upper leaf surface is glossy and very sparsely hairy.

As ornamentals, U. pitteurs pendula [:Zelkova × verschaffeltii ] and U. suberosa pendula [:U. 'Lombartsii' ] are far prettier, and as a (weeping) arbor U. montana pendula [:U. glabra 'Horizontalis' ] is by far the most beautiful\\". Späth, though he used Ulmus montana for both Wych Elm cultivars and, more rarely, for those of U. × hollandica, listed the tree from 1890 to 1902 simply as Ulmus Wentworthi pendula, then from 1903 to 1910 as a Field Elm cultivar, Ulmus campestris Wentworthi pendula or Ulmus campestris wentworthiensis, despite its hybrid leaf and samara. The tree is absent from his post-war catalogues.Späth cat. 230, Berlin 1927-28, p.78, 92, 94 The specimens held at Kew Gardens and the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh succumbed to DED towards the end of the 20th century. The latter was one of the very few RBGE elms to keep its old cultivar name in Melville's wholesale \\"scientific\\" revision of elm nomenclature and taxonomy there in 1958.Melville's 1958 handwritten annotations to the RBGE Cultivated Herbarium accessions book. In 2016 two old plantings were discovered elsewhere in Edinburgh (see Notable Trees below), and are the only survivors known worldwide. Exported to North America, one specimen, probably sourced from Späth, was planted at the Dominion Arboretum, Ottawa, in 1897, while the tree featured in the early 20th-century catalogues of the Bobbink and Atkins nursery, Rutherford, New Jersey.Bobbink and Atkins, Rutherford.

Two of the three specimens supplied to the RBGE by Späth in 1902, the taller is about in height; the shorter was lightly pruned c.2015. A third tree at Holyrood Palace was felled in 2008 due to Dutch Elm Disease and a ring count indicated an origin of approximately 1905. Despite the dearth of textbook descriptions, the trees were confidently identified as 'Wentworthii Pendula' in a RBGE survey (2016),'Survey of the elms of Holyrood Palace', Dr Max Coleman, Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, 22/07/2016 (updated 11/08/16) because their leaves and branchlets match old photographs of the type and because no other large- leaved weeping hybrid elm appears in the cultivar lists of the time. Their lower branchlets 'routinely touch the ground' and are kept trimmed, as was the case with the 'Wentworthii Pendula' at the RBGE. The origin of this specimen, a much younger tree acquired in 1974 but killed by DED in 1996, is recorded only as 'Wiseman', possibly the Wiseman Nursery at Elgin, Moray.RBG Edinburgh, Basement Archives.

However, there is no recorded association of the tree with the estate and it may, in view of its predominant German association, have been named for Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford (1672-1739), Queen Anne's ambassador to the Prussian court, a much esteemed figure in Berlin during the wars with Louis XIV of France. There is also a rare weeping ash cultivar called Wentworth, Fraxinus excelsior 'Pendula Wentworthii',Cook, E. T., Trees and Shrubs for English Gardens (New York, 1902), p.82Bean, W.

Cassells, London. though it is not known whether the name is related. Regarding the ash, Koch suggested in 1872 that 'Wentworth' may have been a corruption of 'Hepworth', the name of the vicar in Gamlingay on whose land the original 'Pendula Wentworthii' ash tree grew in the middle of the eighteenth century. The fact that the Wentworth ash appeared in print before the Wentworth elm may suggest a marketing decision of late 19th century nurseries to apply the same name to a not dissimilar tree.

Mega-Tech Records, was active in 1992, specialized in house music with breakbeat. Megatone brought several high energy disco singles to the U.S. Dance Charts in the early 1980s. All cuts from Sylvester's \\"All I Need\\" LP peaked at number 2 on the club charts in 1982, Paul Parker made number 1 with his single \\"Right On Target\\" that same year, and Sarah Dash took her single \\"Lucky Tonight\\" to the Top 20 with Sylvester and Patti Labelle on backing vocals. Musical project Modern Rocketry was also a notable act on the label, combining the flavors of high energy and rock music, they became an underground club success in San Francisco but never charted. Patrick Cowley's Jo-Lo singers did vocal work for this group frequently, but the two women also had a success with the single \\"Last Call\\". Jo-Lo member Jo Carol performed in San Francisco past the Megatone records craze, even doing a few shows where she performed several rock classics. After Cowley's death in 1982, Blecman was head of the label until he died of AIDS in 1991. In 1992, John Hedges and Terrence Brown took over Megatone.

A jump server is a hardened and monitored device that spans two dissimilar security zones and provides a controlled means of access between them. The most common example is managing a host in a DMZ from trusted networks or computers. Background In the 1990s when co-location facilities became more common there was a need to provide access between dissimilar security zones. The jump server concept emerged to meet this need. The jump server would span the two networks and typically be used in conjunction with a proxy service such as SOCKS to provide access from an administrative desktop to the managed device. As SSH tunneling became common, jump servers became the de facto method of access. Implementation Jump servers are typically placed between a secure zone and a DMZ to provide transparent management of devices on the DMZ once a management session has been established. The jump server acts as a single audit point for traffic and also a single place where user accounts can be managed. A prospective administrator must log into the jump server in order to gain access to the DMZ assets and all access can be logged for later audit. = Unix = A typical configuration is a hardened Unix (or Unix-like) machine configured with SSH and a local firewall. An administrator connects to a target machine in the DMZ by making an SSH connection from the administrator's personal computer to the jump server and then using SSH forwarding to access the target machine. Using an SSH tunnel to the target host allows the use of insecure protocols to manage servers without creating special firewall rules or exposing the traffic on the inside network. = Windows = A typical configuration is a Windows server running Remote Desktop Services that administrators connect to, this isolates the secure infrastructure from the configuration of the administrator's workstation. Security risks A jump server is a potential risk in a network's design. There are several ways of improving the security of the jump server, including: * Reducing the subnet size (increasing the number of subnets), and securing those VLANs using a firewall or router. * Using higher security authentication, such as multi-factor authentication. * Keeping the operating system and software on the jump server up to date. * Using ACLs to restrict access to only the people that require it. * Not allowing outbound access to the rest of the internet from the jump server. * Restricting which programs can be run on the jump server. * Enabling strong logging. With the high level of risk that a jump server can represent, a VPN may be a suitable and higher security replacement. In 2015, a compromised jump server allowed attackers access to over 21.5 million records in one of the largest breaches of government data in the history of the United States.

In response, Lord Panmure suspended the collection of rent from his tenant farmers. The monument was paid for in full by the tenant farmers.

Bowers and his wife were the Nevada Territory's first millionaires. Their home, the Bowers Mansion, was the first of the stately homes built in Nevada with the wealth from the Comstock Lode. Biography Bowers was born in Madison County, Illinois. After coming west in 1856 and spending some time in Sacramento, he soon traveled to Gold Hill. A new mining community located south of where Virginia City, Nevada is today. Sandy quickly began investing in mining claims. Once his claims were set, he bought, sold and traded his investments.Sacramento Daily Union. April 24, 1868 (3:3) Obituary of Sandy Bowers Bowers and James Rogers registered their holdings for a 20-foot mining claim in Gold Canyon on January 28, 1859. In 1859, Eilley purchased Rogers' half of the claim for $1,000 (approximately $ today). Though she was married at the time to someone else, Eilley married Bowers on August 9, 1859,Rast, p. 197 and ten months later, she divorced Alexander Cowan on grounds of desertion. Their first two children, a son, John Jasper Bowers (June 28, 1860 – August 27, 1860), and a daughter, Theresa Fortunatas Bowers (June 16, 1861 – September 17, 1861) died as infants. Shortly thereafter, the Bowers decided to build a home and they travelled to Europe between 1861 and 1863 to purchase furnishings for their mansion and had a desire to meet Queen Victoria, who not give them an audience. The couple returned to Nevada in April 1863, accompanied by an adopted baby girl, Margaret Persia Bowers. With furnishings, they spent $407,000 (approximately $ today). Though Bowers could only read and write a little,Ingersoll, p. 413. every book in the Bowers Mansion library had his name on it. The Bowers Mansion in Carson City, Nevada, completed in 1864, is an example of fine homes built in Nevada by those who became rich as a result of the Comstock Lode mining boom. By 1865, the Nevada mines were reaching the end of their heyday. Rich and miserable, Bowers preferred living in a shack while his wife preferred spending their millions of dollars. He moved back to Gold Hill, attempting to save their mine, with poor results. In early 1868, he tried to sell a portion of the mine but died on April 21 at the age of 35 from silicosis, a common lung disease amongst miners. Bowers is buried in back of the mansion at the top of a rise. His estate was appraised to be worth $638,000 at the time of his death. The \\"Sandy Bowers Claim\\" still exists, though it became a part of the \\"Consolidated Imperial\\" before control was taken over by Sutro Tunnel Coalition, Inc. The actor Morgan Jones played Bowers in the 1955 episode, \\"The Crystal Gazer,\\" of the syndicated television anthology series, Death Valley Days, hosted by Stanley Andrews. Natalie Norwick (1923-2007) was cast as Mrs. Bowers, the former Eilley Orrum, who consults a crystal ball to guide her decisions. She helped Bowers to locate a gold strike. The two marry, spend recklessly on a world tour, and build the still-standing Bowers Mansion between Reno and Carson City. Bowers dies of a lung disease, and Eilley is left with many unpaid bills for which she was responsible. She had not foreseen that their fortune would run dry so quickly.

It aired on Comedy Central in the United States on October 6, 2010. In the episode, Cartman wants to become a NASCAR racer, but he feels that he cannot because he is not \\"poor and stupid enough\\" to fulfill his dream. After some experiments, his dream comes true, and he receives his own race car after his consumption of Vagisil brings massive attention to the product, much to the dismay of his friend Kenny, who tries to stop Cartman from giving his favorite event a bad reputation. \\"Poor and Stupid\\" received a mixed reception. 3.139 million viewers watched the episode, according to Nielsen Media Research, making it the second most watched cable television show of its airdate, losing the number one spot to the baseball game between the New York Yankees and the Minnesota Twins during the 2010 American League Division Series. Plot When Stan and Kyle find Cartman crying in front of his locker at school, he explains that he's upset about the essay Mr. Garrison assigned, \\"What I Want to Be When I Grow Up.\\" He wails that he dreams of being a NASCAR driver, but \\"a person like him\\" could never be that–he's nowhere near poor and stupid enough to be a NASCAR driver or fan. Immediately he turns to Kenny, who innocently confirms that he is a huge NASCAR fan. Dismayed at Cartman's views of NASCAR, Kenny, and himself, Stan and Kyle effectively convince him that he's actually very poor and very stupid. Cartman immediately turns to Butters for help in becoming as poor and stupid as possible: he gives Butters all his money and orders him to spend it all and never give it back. Then, while watching what he hopes is brain-cell- killing TV programming, he sees a commercial for Vagisil that lists short-term memory loss as a possible side effect, so he shoplifts some and consumes it (quite literally, as he eats the cream meant for topical use). On race day, Butters convinces a driver to abandon his car because his wife has been raped, and Cartman hops into his car, but his total lack of knowledge causes an accident that lands him in the hospital. The doctor comments to Cartman, who's disappointed that he is not more seriously injured than he is, that his accident was the stupidest he has ever seen, which restores Cartman's hope. His antics cause the news media to wonder if all NASCAR fans are as stupid as he seems to be. This infuriates Kenny, and begins to take serious matters into his own hands. Kenny, incensed and furious, storms to Cartman's house just in time for a visit from Vagisil founder Geoff Hamill and his wife Patty. Since Cartman's determination has brought considerable attention to Vagisil, Hamill rewards him with his own Vagisil-sponsored racecar, further galling Kenny. Before his first race, Cartman posts bigoted and ignorant statements on his podcast and the media concludes that \\"NASCAR really is just for the poor and stupid\\". Kenny decides that he must put a stop to Cartman. He tries to smuggle a hunting rifle into the racetrack, but it gets confiscated. He is however reassured that he can buy another in the gift shop. At Cartman's first race in his Vagisil car, he drives badly, crashing into other drivers, pulling Danica Patrick under the wheel, and mowing down spectators. When Kenny tries to interrupt, he's knocked onto the track; 2 cars crash to avoid him, leaving Cartman's the only car remaining in the race. Suddenly, Patty Hamill, fed up of her husband's disrespectful and condescending remarks toward her, gets onto the track and takes Jimmie Johnson's damaged car. She beats Cartman and wins the race, much to Hamill's sheer disappointment, now that his company is ruined. Cartman apologizes to Kenny (who, surprisingly is still alive) for trying to become a NASCAR driver, and gives his future up, still believing that he is too smart for NASCAR. He demands that Butters give back his money, then yells at him for having done what he was told and gotten rid of it. Kenny watches in disbelief and confusion.  Production and theme  Series co- creator alt=A brown-haired man wearing a lime shirt and grown jacket smiles and looks at something off-screen. \\"Poor and Stupid\\" was written and directed by series co-founder Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA LV in the United States. It first aired on October 6, 2010 in the United States on Comedy Central. The episode satirizes stereotypes associated with the NASCAR community. In the episode, Cartman claims that all NASCAR drivers and fans are poor and stupid, and that he too must become so in order to become a NASCAR driver. The NASCAR drivers are portrayed as well-spoken and the NASCAR fans are depicted as being fairly smart; it is only Cartman's stereotypical impersonation of the NASCAR community that casts them in a negative light. Reception = Ratings = In its original American broadcast on October 6, 2010, \\"Poor and Stupid\\" was watched by 3.139 million viewers, according to Nielsen Media Research, making it the second most watched cable television show of the night, losing the number one spot to the baseball match between the New York Yankees and the Minnesota Twins during the 2010 American League Division Series. The episode received a 2.0 rating/4 share, meaning it was seen by 2 percent of the population and 4 percent of the people watching television at the time of its broadcast. Among adult viewers between ages 18 and 49, the episode scored a 1.8 rating/5 share and among male viewers between ages 18 and 34, the episode received a 3.8 rating/12 share. = Critical response = \\"Poor and Stupid\\" received mixed reviews. The A.V. Club gave the episode a B− rating. IGN gave the episode a score of 7 out of 10. Reviewer Ramsey Isler described the episode as \\"docile\\" by South Park standards and asserted that the episode lacks the show's \\"signature style of biting ridicule\\". Despite some winning one-liners and sight gags he considered the episode among the weaker episodes of the season so far and hoped for more in future episodes. Brad Trechak of TV Squad said that, while the episode had some humorous moments, the episode \\"doesn't feel like Matt [Stone] and Trey [Parker] at their best\\", and criticized the satire as \\"not [being] the sort of sharp social satire we would expect from South Park.\\" Writing for The Yorker, Simon Cocks wrote that the episode turned out to be \\"reliable yet ultimately disappointing\\". Merrill Barr of Film School Rejects was more positive, calling \\"Poor and Stupid\\" a \\"fine episode of South Park\\". None of the NASCAR drivers lampooned in \\"Poor and Stupid\\" were reported to be offended by their depiction in the episode. Driver Jeff Gordon said that he thought, although the episode was making fun of NASCAR, it was still good publicity for the sport. Jeff Gorden In January 2018, Danica Patrick appeared on the Joe Rogan Experience and said she felt \\"honored\\" to be parodied in the episode, and that it was one of the first instances when she felt she \\"made it.\\" Home release \\"Poor and Stupid\\", along with the thirteen other episodes from South Park's fourteenth season, were released on a three-disc DVD set and two-disc Blu-ray set in the United States on April 26, 2011.

Recording several demo recordings in the early 1980s and being directly influenced by rap music, while spending two years living in the United States during the late 1980s, Bojović decided to present his own interpretation of the genre. The band recorded their debut album, Ljubavna likvefakcija (Love Assassifaction), released through Jugodisk, combining rap and hardcore punk with sexually overt lyrics, being thus distanced from the mainstream media but nevertheless gaining a loyal fan base.

During the same year, on late 1998, the band released the album Neću da se predam (I Will Not Surrender), featuring Deca Loših Muzičara members, trumpet player Borislav Veljković and saxophone player Vlada Miljković and EQV member Margita Stefanović, as guests. As the previous releases, the album was produced by Atman Active. The new material featured the same macho erotic lyrical style, reaching its climax in the track \\"Kurva\\" (\\"Whore\\"), becoming one of the most vulgar and morose song in the history of popular music in Serbia. Other songs on the album, \\"Krug\\" (\\"Circle\\"), \\"Iza horizonta\\" (\\"Beyond the Horizon\\"), \\"New Era\\", featuring sampled music form the hippie musical Hair, and \\"Bongo Budda\\", written by Nemanja Kojić, left a much better impression on both the audience and critics. = 2000s = The recordings from the performances at the Belgrade SKC on February 18 and 19 were released by Metropolis Records in 2001 on the live album Live!, produced by Goran Milisavljević.

After the album release, the band went on hiatus which turned out to be the band disbandment. Guitarist Stanimir Lukić \\"Staća\\" formed the band X-Centar in 2001, releasing the album Restart in 2003, and Đorđe Radivojević \\"Ramirez\\" formed the band Avanti, backed with younger musicians.

Life and career Born in Dresden, Germany, Petkov was the son of a famous violin pedagogue, whose students were leading musicians in Bulgaria and abroad. His mother, Tsvetana Zografova, studied singing in Vienna, Austria. She was a soloist of the Bulgarian Operetta Theatre, singing teacher and performer of chamber music. Since his earliest childhood Dobrin Petkov demonstrated indisputable musical talents. He was only 5 years old when he started lessons with his father. He studied the violin with a persistence and interest that were unusual for a child, and at the age of 8 he played a sonata by Mozart before an audience. At 9 he had his first real concert in Sofia. At 11, he played Édouard Lalo's Symphonie espagnole with an orchestra. At 12, he conducted two musical works of a Children's Theatrical School in Belgrade and in Bulgaria, he also gave 20 violin concerts and one with Pancho Vladigerov in Belgrade. In 1937 on the insistence of the British Ambassador in Sofia, H.E. Mr. Charles Bentinck, a scholarship was granted for the first time to a Bulgarian to study violin and conducting at the Royal College of Music in London. The war brought him back to Bulgaria in 1939, where one after another followed high school, university, mobilisation, war, wounding... In 1946, after graduating the Musical Academy in Sofia with honours, he started working in the Sofia Philharmonic Orchestra as a violinist and conductor-trainee. In September 1950 he was appointed in Ruse. He had extremely intensive activity there, both as opera and symphony orchestra conductor. As a pedagogue he constantly worked with each member of the orchestra and with each singer. He was first violin in the then newly formed quartet and was several times soloist in the regular concerts. There were young and fervent years, during which his remarkable personality was built with incredible work, precision and love of art. During the 5 years in Rousse he conducted 143 opera performances and more than 100 concerts. In 1956, he was appointed Chief Conductor in Plovdiv. In 1962, he was invited to become Chief Conductor of the Sofia National Opera. He made Mozart's Don Giovanni - a performance that is spoken about to this day. He was with the Sofia Philharmonic Orchestra from 1963 till 1969, and together they had tours in Beirut and Damascus, in Greece, Italy, France, the USSR, Germany etc. For personal and ethical reasons, he resigned and remained only part-time professor of conducting at the Musical Academy for four years. He had guest tours in Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Cuba, USSR, the DDR etc. In Plovdiv he staged The Magic Flute in 1971. Maestro Petkov returned to Plovdiv for a second time as Chief Conductor, and remained there until his last days in 1987. In addition to the orchestra's very busy regular schedule, they had tours in the German Democratic Republic, Czechoslovakia, Spain, Italy, USSR and elsewhere, always with great enthusiasm and superlative critic reviews (Venezuela, Romania, Greece, Cuba etc.). In France they were invited in 1981 in the Théâtre du Châtelet together with the Chicago, Lyon, Berlin and Boston philharmonic orchestras. In 1986 he made another opera in Plovdiv - Verdi's Otello - whose premiere won the admiration of music critics. He has also conducted numerous educational concerts before schoolchildren, university students, soldiers and ordinary people, as well as many concerts with young musicians-beginners. He also conducted many works by Bulgarian and foreign composers for the first time, devoting special attention to the Bulgarian authors: \\"There is always someone to take care about foreign authors.

It is the only monastery in the larger area of Friesland and Groningen that survived the Reformation in a decent condition, and the only remaining rural monastery from the Middle Ages in the Netherlands. The convent buildings house a museum for monastery and church history and for religious art, as well as two contemporary art galleries. The former lay church of the monastery still functions as a reformed church. The monastery is located in the extreme southeast of the province of Groningen on a forested sand ridge along the ancient trade route from Münster to Groningen. For passing travelers and pilgrims, the monastery was a place of hospitality and dedication. Ter Apel is the last monastery founded in Groningen, and of 34 monasteries in the province it is the only one still recognizable as a convent. Foundation Detail of the sedilia In 1464, Jacobus Wiltingh, pastor of Garrelsweer and vicar in Loppersum, bequeathed Apell, a settlement among his possessions in the area called Westerwolde, to the Order of the Holy Cross on the condition that a monastery be built there, on the remains of a thirteenth-century Premonstratensian monastery. In May 1465, the General Chapter of the Holy Cross convened in Huy, on the Meuse, and accepted Apell as a gift from God. The monastery dedicated to Saint Gertrude of Nivelles in Bentlage, near Rheine, was to supervise the new monastery, and it sent four priests and several lay brothers to Apell, who founded the monastery and named it Novae Domus Lucis, the \\"House of New Light.\\" Construction, between 1465 and 1561, followed the medieval plan of the mother in Bentlage, and included, besides the convent building, a gatehouse, water mills, a parchment facility, a bakery, a brewery, and a guesthouse. The monastery was bequeathed a number of gifts, including a stained glass window in 1561 by Lieutenant Johan de Mepsche and his wife Agnes, depicting Moses and the tablets containing the Ten Commandments. It also derived income from other sources. The grounds surrounding the monastery were rich in loam, which was used in construction; in 1492, an agreement was signed with the adjoining municipality of Roswinkel for the digging of loam, on land leased by the monastery from the hamlet of Weerdinge. After the Reformation The monastery painted by Arnold Hendrik Koning in 1834 When the area was conquered in 1593 by William Louis, Count of Nassau-Dillenburg, Catholicism was renounced and the convent, with the entire Westerwolde area, became the property of the city of Groningen; the monastery was saved, unlike hundreds of others in the Netherlands, because the abbot converted to Protestantism. Storms, fire, and high maintenance costs caused major problems in the centuries after 1600. The monastery underwent many changes until 1930. The west facade was demolished sometime after 1755, and so were the upper floor with the brothers' cells (1834) and the dilapidated vaults in the church (1837). Unlike all the other monasteries in Groningen, a large part of the original buildings remained. Restoration Herb garden in 2006 The west wing was finished in 2001 Between 1930 and 1933, on the initiative of the city of Groningen, the remaining buildings were carefully preserved and restored, under the direction of city engineer De Vos Nederveen Cappel. On the ground floor, three of the original four wings were retained: the church for secular canons and lay people in the south wing; the chapter house and sacristy in the east wing; and the refectory (now a cafe), the vaulted supplies cellar, the sub-prior and prior's chambers, and the guest accommodations in the north wing. These wings are connected by an ambulatory, surrounding the cloister. The original medieval cloister garden has been replaced with a herb garden; the location of this garden is the only remaining detail in the Netherlands of such a medieval garden. Since 1992 Ter Apel Monastery is listed on UNESCO's Top 100 of immovable properties in the Netherlands. In 2000, the construction of a new west wing was begun, designed by Danish architect Johannes Exner; in September 2001 the work was completed. More renovations took place in 2007 and 2008, with a subsidy from the European Union. The newly renovated scriptorium features an exhibition of books and manuscripts. Also newly added was a workshop for stained glass. The monastery used to hold an annual chess tournament, the Klooster Internationaal Tournament, and continues to organize an annual medieval festival, which in 2010 attracted some 8000 visitors. In 2009, the monastery began publishing books; the first publication was a history of medieval Dutch monasteries, De Middeleeuwse kloostergeschiedenis van de Nederlanden.

This species also occurs in a different form: Haliotis clathrata f. tomricei (Patamakanthin, 2002). Description The size of the shell varies between 10 mm and 60 mm. The large, solid but not thick shell has a rounded-oval shape and is much depressed. The distance of the apex measures from the margin one- fifth the length of the shell. The shell is sculptured with fine spiral cords cut by close minute striae of increment, and has radiating waves or folds above. A slight angle at the row of perforations, below it is broadly excavated and then carinated. The about six perforations are elevated and circular. The outline is suborbicular and much depressed. The color pattern of the surface is either dark red with few radiating angular white patches, or dull red and green, streaked and mottled. The spiral cords of the outer surface are either nearly equal, or have slightly larger ones at wide intervals. They are decussated by close growth-striae. The whorls number a trifle over three. The inner surface is corrugated like the outer surface, silvery, very brilliantly iridescent. The reflections are chiefly sea-green and red. The columellar plate is broad, flat, and obliquely truncated at its base. The cavity of the spire is wide, open, but shallow. This is a variable form, in color varying from dark coral red to dull red streaked with pale green.H.A. Pilsbry (1890) Manual of Conchology XII; Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia, 1890 (described as Haliotis naevosa Martyn) Distribution This marine species occurs in the Red Sea and in the Indo- Pacific and Central Pacific region: Aldabra, Chagos, Comores, Kenya, Madagascar, Mauritius, and the Seychelles; also off Australia (New South Wales, Northern Territory, Queensland, and Western Australia).

Background The party was established in 1871, after the division of the Progressive Party following the death of General Juan Prim, 1st Marquis of los Castillejos. The left wing of the party, along with the cimbrios, monarchist faction of the Democratic Party led by Cristino Martos, organised themselves as a party under the leadership of Manuel Ruiz Zorrilla. The party disintegrated after the 1874 restoration of the monarchy, fleeing its members to left-wing monarchist parties or to republican parties. Ruiz Zorrilla and his supporters established the Progressive Republican Party, while the faction of Martos joined the Liberal Party of Práxedes Mateo Sagasta. In 1876, the party remnants were reorganized as the Republican Reformist Party by Nicolás Salmerón.

The show was created by Marc Terjung, who also created the legal dramedy Edel & Starck, and Benedikt Gollhardt. On May 19, 2010, Sat.1 renewed the show for a second season,DWDL.de: \\"Danni Lowinski\\" gets second season! which premiered on March 14, 2011. A third season was ordered in April 2011,DWDL.de: Third season for \\"Danni\\" set to premiere on February 6, 2012. All seasons are consisting of thirteen episodes each. The fourth season aired from 21 January to 22 April 2013. On 9 April 2013 it was announced that Danni Lowinski was renewed for a fifth season. Plot Daniela \\"Danni\\" Lowinski (Annette Frier) is a trained hairdresser who received her qualification for college (in Germany called Abitur) doing evening classes and then managed to major in law successfully. After graduating, she wants to work as lawyer but no lawyer's office is willing to employ her. In sheer desperation she has the idea to lease space in a mall where a simple table and two chairs form a small helpdesk. The helpdesk offers people the opportunity to have Danni deal with their legal matters for just one Euro per minute. Of course this leads to Danni attracting rather unusual clients, whose problems she solves in an equally unusual manner. In each season she is assisted by her best friend and barista Bea Flohe (Nadja Becker) as well as people from adjacent stores in the mall. In her private life, Danni has to deal with her father Kurt (Axel Siefer), whom she lives with. In the first season her friends from the adjacent stores are Persian locksmith Rasoul (Elyas M’Barek) and Nils (Oliver Fleischer), a massage therapist, as well as Dr. Oliver Schmidt (Jan Sosniok), a fellow attorney who works in a lawyer's office located in the mall. She starts a relationship with Oliver with whom she breaks up in the final episode about a professional problem. In the second season Hannes Stüsser takes over the locksmith business and the mall has a new security guard Sven Nowak. She starts a relationship with Sven and she finds out that there is a homicide case against him from his former job in the police where she asks access to records at the state attorney. She has mixed feelings about Oliver and Sven and both of them press her to make a choice in the final episode. In the third season it is revealed that Sven had quit, now being on a job in Leverkusen. He is replaced by Svenja Müller. Nils runs a junk shop now and it is later revealed that Hannes has begun law studies. One thread follows Bea's relationship - in the beginning a loose triangle with Nils and Hannes and later Dustin which however turns out to be a drug dealer facing a jail sentence. The other thread is about Oliver who initiates a formal contract sending down a couple of cases - that includes a big lawsuit against a pharmaceutical that makes for key scenes in the final episode.

S. definition of the Monroe Doctrine and its hegemony in the hemisphere.\\" Herring, George C., From Colony to Superpower: U.S. Foreign Relations Since 1776, (2008) pp. 307–308 Leading British historian Robert Arthur Humphreys later called the crisis \\"one of the most momentous episodes in the history of Anglo-American relations in general and of Anglo-American rivalries in Latin America in particular.\\" Background By 1895, the dispute between Britain and Venezuela over the territory of Guayana Esequiba, which Britain claimed as part of British Guiana and Venezuela saw as Venezuelan territory, had lasted for half a century. The territorial claims were originally those of the Spanish Empire, inherited by Venezuela after its independence in 1830, and of the Dutch Empire, inherited by the United Kingdom with the acquisition of the Dutch territories of Essequibo, Demerara and Berbice in 1814, had remained unsettled over previous centuries.Joseph, Cedric L. (1970), \\"The Venezuela-Guyana Boundary Arbitration of 1899: An Appraisal: Part I\\", Caribbean Studies, Vol. 10, No. 2 (Jul., 1970), pp. 56–89 Over the course of the 19th century, Britain and Venezuela had proved no more able to reach an agreement until matters came to a head in 1895, after seven years of severed diplomatic relations. Venezuela map (1810) showing the border with the Essequibo river. The basis of the discussions between Venezuela and the United Kingdom lay in Britain's advocacy of a particular division of the territory deriving from a mid-19th-century survey that it had commissioned. That survey originated with German naturalist Robert Schomburgk's four-year expedition for the Royal Geographical Society in 1835 to 1839, which resulted in a sketch of the territory with a line marking what he believed to be the western boundary claimed by the Dutch. He was thus commissioned by the British government to carry out a survey of Guiana's boundaries.R. A. Humphreys (1967), \\"Anglo-American Rivalries and the Venezuela Crisis of 1895\\", Presidential Address to the Royal Historical Society 10 December 1966, Transactions of the Royal Historical Society, 17: pp131-164 The result was the \\"Schomburgk Line\\", which he established partly to follow natural divisions and partly to distinguish territory of Spanish or Venezuelan occupation from that which had been occupied by the Dutch. The line went well beyond the area of British occupation and gave British Guiana control of the mouth of the Orinoco River. In 1844, Venezuela declared the Essequibo River the dividing line; a British offer the same year to make major alterations to the line and cede the mouth of the Orinoco and much associated territory was ignored.Humphreys (1967:138) No treaty between Britain and Venezuela was reached, and after an 1850 agreement not to encroach on disputed territory, the matter largely rested until 1876, when diplomatic exchanges resumed. Schomburgk's initial sketch, which had been published in 1840, was the only version of the \\"Schomburgk Line\\" published until 1886. That led to accusations by US President Grover Cleveland that the line had been extended \\"in some mysterious way\\". In October 1886, Britain declared the line to be the provisional frontier of British Guiana, and in February 1887 Venezuela severed diplomatic relations. Proposals for a renewal of relations and settlement of the dispute failed repeatedly, and by summer 1894, diplomatic relations had been severed for seven years, the dispute having dragged on for half a century. In addition, both sides had established police or military stations at key points in the area, partly to defend claims to the Caratal goldfield of the region's Yuruari basin, which was within Venezuelan territory but claimed by the British. The mine at El Callao, started in 1871, was once one of the richest in the world, and the goldfields as a whole saw over a million ounces exported between 1860 and 1883. The gold mining was dominated by immigrants from the British Isles and the British West Indies, giving an appearance of almost creating a British colony on Venezuelan territory.Humphreys (1967:139)  History  Map of Gran Colombia (1819) including the Essequibo border. Cartoon in El Diablo, 1894, depicting England, Venezuela and President Joaquín Crespo, satirizing Britain's ambition General Domingo A. Sifontes Its first settlers were Guayan Indians and Kamaracotos, coming from the savanna of the Divina Pastora and Tupuquen located to the left margin of the river Yuruari. They fed on hunting, fishing, and agriculture. Tumeremo was founded on January 26, 1788 under the name of \\"Mission of Our Lady of Bethlehem of Tumeremo\\" by the Capuchin monks of Catalonia, among them: Fray Mariano de Perafita, Fray Bonaventura de Carrocera, Fray Joaquín María de Martorell, Fray Ramón Pruna and Fray Tomas de Santa Eugenia. Tumeremo means \\"Painted Snake\\", in the dialect of the first Indians who inhabited those lands. The friars establish several missions and an agricultural emporium based on livestock and cotton cultivation. On 24 February 1781 a group of British privateers captured Essequibo and Demerara in Dutch Guyana, but did not stay. In March, two sloops of a Royal Navy squadron under Admiral Lord Rodney accepted the surrender of \\"Colony of Demarary and the River Essequebo\\". From 27 February 1782 to February 1783 the French occupied the colony after compelling Governor Robert Kinston to surrender. The peace of Paris, which occurred in 1783 restored these territories to the Dutch. In 1796 it was permanently occupied by the British and by 1800, Essequibo and Demerara collectively held around 380 sugarcane plantations. At the Peace of Amiens (1802), the Netherlands received the Essequibo colony for a short time, from 1802 to 1803, but after that the British again occupied it during the Napoleonic Wars. In 1812 Stabroek was renamed by the British as Georgetown. Essequibo became official British territory on 13 August 1814 as part of the Treaty of London and was merged with the colony of Demerara. But it also became involved in one of Latin America's most persistent border disputes because the new colony had the Essequibo river as its west border with the Spanish Captaincy General of Venezuela. Although Spain still claimed the region, the Spanish did not contest the treaty because they were preoccupied with their own colonies' struggles for independence war. During the Campaign of Guayana, in 1817 General Manuel Piar fought against the realists to seize the missions of Spanish Guyana. After releasing Tumeremo, the Spanish survivors were imprisoned and sentenced to death. From there, the city was a strategic site and barracks for the patriot soldiers commanded by Simón Bolívar. From 1830 many indigenous and other populations began to emerge around Tumeremo. On 21 July 1831, Demerara-Essequibo was united with Berbice to create British Guiana with the Essequibo River as its west border, although many British settlers lived west of the Essequibo. In 1894, a group of British settlers who came from the British Guyana tried to establish themselves near Tumeremo in what is now Sifontes Municipality. General Domingo Antonio Sifontes claimed the area in 2 March 1894 near El Dorado, where Venezuela established a military position. After expelling the settlers from the area, Sifontes became a local hero in recognition of his defense of Venezuelan sovereignty. Venezuela had in the course of the dispute repeatedly appealed to the US and to the Monroe Doctrine, but the US government had declined to involve itself. That changed after Venezuela obtained the services of William Lindsay Scruggs. Scruggs, a former US ambassador to Colombia and Venezuela, was recruited in 1893 by the Venezuelan government to operate on its behalf in Washington D.C. as a lobbyist and legal attache. Scruggs had apparently resigned his ambassadorship to Venezuela in December 1892 but had been dismissed by the US for bribing the President of Venezuela. As a lobbyist, Scruggs published an October 1894 pamphlet, British Aggressions in Venezuela:, or the Monroe Doctrine on Trial in which he attacked \\"British aggression\\" and claimed that Venezuela was anxious to arbitrate over the Venezuela-British Guiana border dispute. Scruggs also claimed that British policies in the disputed territory violated the Monroe Doctrine of 1823. For much of the 19th century, it had only rarely been invoked by the United States, but a \\"paradigm shift in U.S. foreign relations in the late nineteenth century\\" saw Americans more actively support their increasingly-significant economic interests in Central and South America. The \\"'new diplomacy' thrust the United States more emphatically into the imperial struggle\\".Gilderhus, Mark T. (2006), \\"The Monroe Doctrine: Meanings and Implications\\", Presidential Studies Quarterly, Volume 36, Issue 1, pages 5–16 It was in that context that Scruggs sought to draw on the Doctrine in Venezuela's interests. Crisis President Cleveland twist the tail of the British Lion; cartoon in Puck by J.S. Pughe, 1895 House Resolution 252 Scruggs collaborated with Georgian compatriot Representative Leonidas Livingston to propose House of Representatives Resolution 252 to the third session of the 53rd United States Congress. The bill recommended Venezuela and the United Kingdom settle the dispute by arbitration. President Grover Cleveland signed it into law on February 22, 1895, after passing both houses of the United States Congress. The vote had been unanimous.Richard F. Hamilton (2010), America's New Empire: The 1890s and Beyond, Transaction Publishers, p. 131 On April 27, 1895, the Royal Navy occupied the Nicaraguan port of Corinto, after a number of British subjects, including the vice-consul, had been seized during disturbances, shortly after the former protectorate of the Mosquito Coast had been incorporated into Nicaragua. The British demanded an indemnity of £15,000. US Secretary of State Walter Q. Gresham thought the demands harsh, but also that they should be met. US public opinion, however, was outraged at the British military activity in the US sphere of influence. In July 1895, new Secretary of State Richard Olney (succeeding Gresham, who died in office at the end of May) sent a document to London which became known as \\"Olney's twenty-inch gun\\" (the draft was 12,000 words long).Thomas Paterson, J. Garry Clifford, Shane J. Maddock (2009), American foreign relations: A history, to 1920. Cengage Learning. p. 205 The note reviewed the history of the Anglo-Venezuelan dispute and of the Monroe Doctrine, and it firmly insisted on the application of the Doctrine to the case, declaring that \\"today the United States is practically sovereign on this continent, and its fiat is law upon the subjects to which it confines its interposition.\\"Humphreys (1967:150) The President, the Secretary of State, and the US public \\"had been brought to believe that Britain was in the wrong, that the vital interests of the United States were involved, and the United States must intervene.\\" The note had little impact on the British government, partly because Joseph Chamberlain, at the Colonial Office, thought it possible that the colony had a major gold-bearing region around the Schomburgk line and partly because the British rejected the idea that the Monroe Doctrine had any relevance for the boundary dispute. A reply to Olney's note directly challenged his interpretation of the Monroe Doctrine: > The Government of the United States is not entitled to affirm as a universal > proposition, with reference to a number of independent States for whose > conduct it assumes no responsibility, that its interests are necessarily > concerned in whatever may befall those States, simply because they are > situated in the Western Hemisphere.\\" By 17 December 1895, Cleveland delivered an address to the United States Congress reaffirming the Monroe Doctrine and its relevance to the dispute. The address asked Congress to fund a commission to study the boundaries between Venezuela and British Guiana, and declared it the duty of the United States \\"to resist by every means in its power as a willful aggression upon its rights and interests\\" any British attempt to exercise jurisdiction over territory the United States judged Venezuelan. The address was perceived as direct threat of war with the United Kingdom if the British did not comply, but Cleveland had not committed himself to accepting the commission's report or specified any details on how the commission would act. Despite the public belligerence, neither the British nor the American governments had any interest in war. On December 18, 1895, Congress approved $100,000 for the United States Commission on the Boundary Between Venezuela and British Guiana. It was formally established on 1 January 1896.The Boundary Commission consisted of: # David J. Brewer, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States; # Richard H. Alvey, Chief Justice of the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, skilled Spanish scholar; # F.R. Coudert, Founder of Coudert Brothers, polyglot, president of New York bar (1890–91), United States liaison during the Bering Sea Dispute in 1892; # Dr. D.C. Gilman, Noted Geographer, President of the Johns Hopkins University # Andrew D. White, Historian, diplomat, founder of Cornell University The Commission selected Judge Brewer as Chairman, and appointed as secretary Severo Mallet-Prevost, trained lawyer and scholar. Historian George Lincoln Burr, who contributed to the Commission's historical research, argued shortly after the Commission concluded its work that it made a major contribution to clarifying issues of historical fact in the dispute. The Commission's work, he wrote, helped the disputing parties to focus on issues of fact supportable by evidence (as opposed to mere assertions), and by the time the Arbitration process was under way, the Commission's own view of historical facts was largely accepted by the parties \\"so that their main issue [was] now in the main one of law, not of fact.\\"George Lincoln Burr (1899), \\"The Search for the Venezuela-Guiana Boundary\\", The American Historical Review, Vol. 4, No. 3 (Apr., 1899), pp. 470–477. p476 Arbitration Venezuela supported its claim by printing an 1896 postage stamp with a map showing the Guianas up to the east bank of the Essequibo River as \\"Guayana Venezolana\\".Russell W. Stern, The Politics of Printing in Stamp Design and Production, \\"NSW Philatelist\\", 15 October 2008 An 1896 cartoon from an American newspaper, following Britain's agreement to go to arbitration. In January 1896, the British government decided in effect to recognise the US right to intervene in the boundary dispute and accepted arbitration in principle without insisting on the Schomburgk line as a basis for negotiation. Negotiations between the US and Britain over the details of the arbitration followed, and Britain was able to persuade the US of many of its views, even as it became clear that the eventual report of the Boundary Commission would likely be negative towards the British claims.King (2007:251) An agreement between the US and the UK was signed on 12 November 1896. Cleveland's Boundary Commission suspended its work in November 1896, but it still went on to produce a large report. The agreement provided for a tribunal with two members representing Venezuela (but chosen by the US Supreme Court), two members chosen by the British government, and fifth member chosen by those four, who would preside. Venezuelan President Joaquín Crespo referred to a sense of \\"national humiliation\\", and the treaty was modified so that the Venezuelan President would nominate a tribunal member. However it was understood that his choice would not be a Venezuelan, and in fact, he nominated the Chief Justice of the United States. Ultimately, on 2 February 1897, the Treaty of Washington between Venezuela and the United Kingdom was signed, and ratified several months later. After the US and Britain had nominated their arbitrators, Britain proposed that the disputing parties agree on the presiding fifth arbitrator.King (2007:252-4) There were delays in discussingthat and in the interim, Martens was among the names of international jurists suggested by the US. Martens was then chosen by Venezuela from a shortlist of names submitted by Britain. The Panel of Arbitration thus consisted of: # Melville Weston Fuller (Chief Justice of the United States) # David Josiah Brewer (Member of the US Supreme Court) # Sir Richard Henn Collins (Lord Justice of Appeal) # Lord Herschell (former Lord Chancellor), replaced upon his death by Charles Russell (Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales) # Friedrich Martens (diplomat of Russia and jurist) Venezuela's senior counsel was former US President Benjamin Harrison, assisted by Severo Mallet-Prevost, Benjamin F. Tracy, James R. Soley, and José María Rojas.Willard L. King (2007), Melville Weston Fuller – Chief Justice of the United States 1888–1910, Macmillan. p257 Britain was represented by its Attorney General, Richard Webster, assisted by Robert Reid, George Askwith and Sidney Rowlatt, with Sir Frederick Pollock preparing the original outline of Britain's argument.King (2007:258) The parties had eight months to prepare their case, another four months to reply to the other party's case, and another three months for the final printed case. The final arguments were submitted in December 1898, with the total evidence and testimony amounting to 23 volumes.King (2007:254) Britain's key argument was that prior to Venezuela's independence, Spain had not taken effective possession of the disputed territory and said that the local Indians had had alliances with the Dutch, which gave them a sphere of influence that the British acquired in 1814.King (2007:256) After fifty-five days of hearings,King (2007:257) the arbitrators retired for six days. The American arbitratorsFormer US President Benjamin Harrison served as an attorney for the Republic of Venezuela filed an 800-page brief and traveled to Paris, where he spent more than 25 hours in court on Venezuela's behalf. Although he lost the case, his legal arguments won him international renown. found the British argument preposterous since American Indians had never been considered to have any sovereignty.King (2007:259) However, the British had the advantage that Martens wanted a unanimous decision, and the British threatened to ignore the award if it did not suit them. They were also able to argue a loss of equity since under the terms of the treaty lands occupied for 50 years would receive title, and a number of British gold mines would be narrowly lost to that cutoff if their lands were awarded to Venezuela. Outcome Punch cartoon after the conclusion of the Tribunal of Arbitration. PEACE AND PLENTY. Lord Salisbury (chuckling). \\"I like arbitration — In the PROPER PLACE!\\" Sitting in Paris, the Tribunal of Arbitration finalized its decision on 3 October 1899. The award was unanimous but gave no reasons for the decision, merely describing the resulting boundary, which gave Britain almost 90% of the disputed territory.Schoenrich (1949:526) The Schomburgk Line was, with small deviations, re-established as the border between British Guiana and Venezuela. The first deviation from the Schomburgk line was that Venezuela's territory included Barima Point at the mouth of the Orinoco, giving it undisputed control of the river and thus the ability to levy duties on Venezuelan commerce. The second was drawing the border at the Wenamu River rather than the Cuyuni River, giving Venezuela a substantial territory east of the line that Britain had originally refused to include in the arbitration. However, Britain received most of the disputed territory and all of the gold mines.King (2007:260) The reaction to the award was surprise, the award's lack of reasoning being a particular concern. Though the Venezuelans were keenly disappointed with the outcome, they honoured their counsel for their efforts (their delegation's Secretary, Severo Mallet-Prevost, received the Order of the Liberator in 1944), and abided by the award. The Anglo-Venezuelan boundary dispute asserted for the first time a more outward-looking American foreign policy, particularly in the Americas, marking the United States as a world power. That was the earliest example of modern interventionism under the Monroe Doctrine in which the USA exercised its claimed prerogatives in the Americas. Aftermath The Olney–Pauncefote Treaty of 1897 was a proposed treaty between the United States and Britain in 1897 that would have required arbitration of major disputes. The treaty was rejected by the US Senate and never went into effect. The 1895 dispute between the US and Britain over Venezuela was peacefully resolved through arbitration. Both nations realized that a mechanism was desirable to avoid possible future conflicts. US Secretary of State Richard Olney in January 1897 negotiated an arbitration treaty with the British diplomat Julian Pauncefote. President William McKinley supported the treaty, as did most opinion leaders, academics, and leading newspapers. The main opposition came from Irish-Americans, who held a very negative view of Britain because of its treatment of Ireland. In the US Senate, however, a series of amendments exempted important issues from any sort of arbitration. Any issue that was not exempted would need two thirds of the Senate before arbitration could begin. Virtually nothing was left of the original proposal, and the Senate in May 1897 voted 43 in favor to 26 opposed, three votes short of what was needed. The Senate was jealous of its control over treaties and was susceptible to a certain deep-rooted Anglophobia. Despite its disappointment with the award of Paris Tribunal of Arbitration, Venezuela abided by it. However, half a century later, the publication of an alleged political deal between Russia and Britain led Venezuela to reassert its claims. In 1949, the US jurist Otto Schoenrich gave the Venezuelan government the Memorandum of Severo Mallet-Prevost (Official Secretary of the U.S./Venezuela delegation in the Tribunal of Arbitration), written in 1944 to be published only after Mallet-Prevost's death. That reopened the issues, with Mallet-Prevost surmising a political deal between Russia and Britain from the subsequent private behaviour of the judges.Otto Schoenrich, \\"The Venezuela- British Guiana Boundary Dispute\\", July 1949, American Journal of International Law. Vol. 43, No. 3. p. 523. Washington, DC. (USA). Mallet-Prevost said that Martens had visited England with the two British arbitrators in the summer of 1899 and had offered the two American judges a choice between accepting a unanimous award along the lines ultimately agreed or a 3-2 majority opinion even more favourable to the British. The alternative would have followed the Schomburgk Line entirely and given the mouth of the Orinoco to the British. Mallet-Prevost said that the American judges and Venezuelan counsel were disgusted at the situation and considered the 3-2 option with a strongly- worded minority opinion but ultimately went along with Martens to avoid depriving Venezuela of valuable territory to which it was entitled. As a result of Mallet-Prevost's claims, Venezuela revived its claim to the disputed territory in 1962.Isidro Morales Paúl, Análisis Crítico del Problema Fronterizo \\"Venezuela-Gran Bretaña\\", in La Reclamación Venezolana sobre la Guayana Esequiba, Biblioteca de la Academia de Ciencias Económicas y Sociales. Caracas, 2000, p. 200. In 2018, Guyana has applied to the International Court of Justice to get a declaration that the 1899 Award is valid and binding upon Guyana and Venezuela and that the boundary established by that Award and the 1905 Agreement is valid.Press Release 2018/17 See also *The Monroe Doctrine (1896 film) – US propaganda film Notes References Further reading * Blake, Nelson M. \\"Background of Cleveland's Venezuelan Policy.\\" American Historical Review 47.2 (1942): 259-277. in JSTOR * Boyle, T. \\"The Venezuela Crisis and the Liberal Opposition, 1895-96.\\" Journal of Modern History Vol. 50, No. 3, (1978): D1185-D1212. in JSTOR * Campbell, Alexander Elmslie.

In 1994 he went to Sri Lanka, looking to meet Nyanaponika Thera after having read his book The Heart of Buddhist Meditation. Nyanaponika Thera died just days before Analayo's arrival but he stayed on and studied with Bhikkhu Bodhi. In 1995 he took pabbajja again under Balangoda Ananda Maitreya Thero. He received his upasampada in 2007 in the Sri Lankan Shwegyin Nikaya (belonging to the main Amarapura Nikaya), with Pemasiri Thera of Sumathipala Aranya as his ordination acariya. Bhikkhu Bodhi has been Bhikkhu Anālayo's main teacher. The late Bhikkhu Kaṭukurunde Ñāṇananda has also been an important influence in his understanding of the Dhamma.  Scholarly career and activity Bhikkhu Anālayo completed a PhD thesis on the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta at the University of Peradeniya in 2000, which was later published as Satipaṭṭhāna, the Direct Path to Realization. During the course of that study, he had come to notice the interesting differences between the Pāli and Chinese Buddhist canon versions of this early Buddhist discourse. This led to his undertaking a habilitation research at the University of Marburg, completed in 2007, in which he compared the Majjhima Nikāya discourses with their Chinese, Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit and Tibetan Buddhist canon counterparts.Published as A Comparative Study of the Majjhima-nikāya, (Dharma Drum Buddhist College Special Series), Taiwan: Dharma Drum Academic Publisher, 2011. In 2013 Anālayo then published Perspectives on Satipaṭṭhāna,Perspectives on Satipaṭṭhāna, Birmingham: Windhorse Publications, 2014. where he builds on his earlier work by comparing the parallel versions of the Satipaṭṭhāna-sutta and exploring the meditative perspective that emerges when emphasis is given to those instructions that are common ground among the extant canonical versions and thus can reasonably well be expected to be early. Bhikkhu Anālayo has published extensively on early Buddhism.

Central to Anālayo's academic activity remain theoretical and practical aspects of meditation. He has published several articles on insight and absorption meditation and related contemporary meditation traditions to their textual sources. His comparative studies of early Buddhist texts have also led Anālayo to focus on historical developments of Buddhist thought, and to research the early roots and genesis of the bodhisattva ideal and the beginning of Abhidharma thought.The Dawn of Abhidharma, Hamburg, Hamburg University Press, 2014.

After her parents separated, she moved to New York City with her fashion designer mother, who counted Dinah Shore and Loretta Young among her customers. She grew up in the Bronx and attended Catholic schools before entering Jamaica High School from which she graduated. She received classical voice training in NYC with William Hermann and also studied piano, ballet, and tap dancing during her youth. At the age of 16 she began singing on American radio; and her talents were noticed and supported by then General Manager of the Metropolitan Opera Edward Johnson and Met soprano Lucrezia Bori. She traveled to Italy to pursue training in opera in Venice with the famed soprano Toti Dal Monte; partially because her maternal grandparents hailed from that country. She found that the Italian language she had learned through her opera training prepared her poorly for communicating with natives in the language, saying \\"the Italian I'd learned by studying operas enabled me to talk intelligently only about poisons and suicide and tragic love affairs\\". Opera career In November 1948 Wilson made her professional opera debut at the Teatro Grande in Brescia under the name Dolores Vilsoni as Rosina in Gioachino Rossini's The Barber of Seville with Cesare Siepi as her Basilio. She spent her early career performing with major opera houses in Italy; with important house debuts including the Teatro Massimo in Palermo (1950 as Gilda in Giuseppe Verdi's Rigoletto), the Teatro dell'Opera di Roma (1951 as Gilda), and La Fenice (1951 as Gilda). She made her South American debut at the Teatro Municipal in Rio de Janeiro in 1952 singing both Gilda and Rosina. She returned to the Teatro Grande in Brescia as Rosina in 1952. She sang that role at several other theatres, including in 1953 for her first performance in France at the Aix-en-Provence Festival and for her debut at the Opéra de Monte-Carlo. She was soon engaged as a guest artist with other important European theatres during the 1950s; including the Grand Théâtre de Bordeaux, the Liceu in Barcelona, the Opéra de Nice, the Teatro Lirico Giuseppe Verdi in Trieste, the Teatro Massimo Bellini in Catania, and the Teatro Nacional de São Carlos in Lisbon. Wilson made her United States operatic debut at the Metropolitan Opera in February 1954 in the title role in Gaetano Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor, performing together with tenor Jan Peerce. Under the headline \\"Dolores Wilson Scores as Lucia\\", critic Howard Taubman of The New York Times said \\"Her voice is fresh in quality, large in size and flexible in production\\" and credited her with having \\" sung \\"a Lucia of uncommon merit\\".Taubman, Howard. \\"DOLORES WILSON SCORES AS LUCIA; Philadelphia-Born Coloratura Is Hailed at Metropolitan in Her U. S. Opera Debut\\", The New York Times, February 9, 1954. Accessed October 5, 2010. In a December 1954 performance of Susanna in Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's The Marriage of Figaro, Wilson was a last minute replacement for the scheduled performer Nadine Conner, and despite the last minute notice was said to have \\"essayed a difficult new role with great success\\".J.B. \\"MISS WILSON STEPS INTO 'FIGARO' ROLE; Soprano Sings First Susanna at Met on Half-Day's Notice, Replacing Nadine Conner\\", The New York Times, December 21, 1954. Accessed October 5, 2010. Her replacement of another singer, however, was less enthusiastically received; being called on to step in for Maria Callas in the role of Lucia on December 11, 1956. Even before the curtain rose, police were dispersing irate claimants for refunds on that occasion. She performed at the Met as Gilda, Oscar in Verdi's Un ballo in maschera, Rosina, and Zerlina in Mozart's Don Giovanni. On July 7, 1956 Wilson entered the annals of opera history when she created the title role in the world premiere of Douglas Moore's seminal work The Ballad of Baby Doe at the Central City Opera in Central City, Colorado, with Lenya Gabriele alternating in the role during the rest of its initial run. In November 1956 she made her debut at the Lyric Opera of Chicago as Musetta in Giacomo Puccini's La bohème. In 1957 she toured to 23 cities in the United States with the NBC Opera Theatre performing the role of Violetta in Verdi's La traviata. At the Metropolitan Opera in March 1959, Wilson removed a neck brace she was wearing and filled in for Lily Pons in the title role of Lucia di Lammermoor, completing the performance but collapsing in her dressing room afterward and being taken to the hospital.via Associated Press. \\"Soprano Collapses After Opera Role\\", TimesDaily, March 10, 1959; accessed October 5, 2010. She ultimately left the Met under circumstances which were termed \\"creative differences\\" with the company's general manager Rudolf Bing. Wilson continued to perform internationally in operas in the early 1960s; appearing in theatres in the United States, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, Germany and South America. Other roles she performed on stage included Amina in Vincenzo Bellini's La Sonnambula, Hanna Glawari in Franz Lehár's The Merry Widow, Marie in Donizetti's La fille du régiment, Norina in Donizetti's Don Pasquale, Philine in Ambroise Thomas’s Mignon, and the title role in Donizetti's Linda di Chamounix. In 1959 she recorded excerpts of the role of Norina for RCA Records. Musical theatre career and later life Turning to Broadway, Wilson debuted in the 1965 production of The Yearling with David Wayne. Later that year she took over the role of Golde in the original Broadway production of Fiddler on the Roof from actress Maria Karnilova; and was again seen in that part in 1968-69. She performed in the original casts of two more musicals: portraying Maria Haggerty in Cry for Us All (1970) and Aunt Jenny in I Remember Mama (1979). In August 1979 she took over the role of Miss Hannigan in the original production of Charles Strouse and Martin Charnin's Annie. Her last appearance on Broadway was in 1983 as Vivian Proclo in the revival of Terrence McNally's The Ritz. She also appeared in productions with numerous regional theaters in the United States. Death A resident of the Lillian Booth Actors Fund Home in Englewood, New Jersey, Wilson died there at the age of 82 on September 28, 2010, due to natural causes. Both of her marriages had ended in divorce and she left no immediate survivors.

The RDI has the following specific goals: # To be an independent repository of HIV resistance and treatment outcome data # To use bioinformatics to explore the relationships between resistance, other clinical and laboratory factors and HIV treatment outcome # To develop and make freely available a system to predict treatment response, as an aid to optimising and individualising the clinical management of HIV infection The RDI consists of a small executive group based in the UK, an international advisory group of leading HIV/AIDS scientists and clinicians, and an extensive global network of collaborators and data contributors. Background Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a condition in which the immune system begins to fail, leading to life-threatening opportunistic infections. There are approximately 25 HIV ‘antiretroviral’ drugs that have been approved for the treatment of HIV infection, from six different classes, based on the point in the HIV life-cycle at which they act. They are used in combination; typically 3 or more drugs from 2 or more different classes, a form of therapy known as highly active antiretroviral therapy or HAART. The aim of therapy is suppression of the virus to very low, ideally undetectable, levels in the blood this prevents the virus from depleting the immune cells that it preferentially attacks (CD4 cells) and prevents or delays illness and death. Despite the expanding availability of these drugs and the impact of their use, treatments continue to fail, often involving to the development of resistance. During drug therapy, low-level virus replication still occurs, particularly when a patient misses a dose. HIV makes errors in copying its genetic material and, if a mutation makes the virus resistant to one or more of the drugs, it may begin to replicate more successfully in the presence of that drug and undermine the effect of the treatment. If this happens then the treatment needs to be changed to re-establish control over the virus. In well-resourced healthcare settings, when treatment fails a resistance test may be run to predict to which drugs the patient's virus is resistant. The type of test in most common use is the genotype test, which detects mutations in the viral genetic code. This information is then typically interpreted using rules equating individual mutations with resistance against individual drugs. However, there are many different interpretation systems available that do not always agree, the systems only provide categorical results (resistant, sensitive or intermediate) and they do not necessarily relate well to how a patient will respond to a combination of drugs in the clinic. RDI Overview The RDI was established in 2002 to pioneer a new approach: to develop computational models using a wide range of laboratory and clinical data collected from thousands of patients treated with HAART all over the world and to use these models to predict how an individual patient will respond to different combinations of drugs. Key to the success of this approach is the collection of large amounts of data with which to train the models and the use of data from as wide and heterogeneous range of sources as possible to maximise the generalisability of the models’ predictions. In order to achieve this, the RDI set out to involve as many clinics worldwide as possible and to be the single repository for the data required, in an attempt to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort and competition. As of January 2019, the RDI has collected data from approximately 250,000 patients from dozens of clinics in more than 30 countries. It is probably the largest database of its kind in the world. The data includes demographic information for the patient, and multiple determinations of the amount of virus in the patient's bloodstream, CD4 cells counts (a white blood cell critical to the function of the immune system that HIV targets and destroys), genetic code of the patients virus, and details of the drugs that have been used to treat the patient. The RDI has used these data to conduct extensive research in order to develop the most accurate system possible for the prediction of treatment response. This research involved the development and comparison of different computational modelling methods including artificial neural networks, support vector machines, random forests and logistical regression. The predictions of the RDI's models have historically correlated well with the actual changes in virus load of patients in the clinic, typically achieving a correlation co- efficient of 0.7 or more. Recent models have predicted whether a combination treatment will reduce the level of virus in the patient's bloodstream to undetectable levels with an accuracy of approximately 80%, significantly better than just using a genotype with rules-based interpretation. HIV- TRePS In October 2010, following clinical testing in two multinational studies, the RDI made its experimental HIV Treatment Response Prediction System, HIV-TRePS available over the Internet. In January 2011, two clinical studies were published indicating that use of the HIV-TRePS system could lead to clinical and economic benefits. The studies, conducted by expert HIV physicians in the US, Canada and Italy, showed that use of the system was associated with changes of treatment decision to combinations involving fewer drugs overall, which were predicted to result in better virological responses, suggesting that use of the system could potentially improve patient outcomes and reduce the overall number and cost of drugs used. As clinics in resource- limited settings are often unable to afford genotyping, the RDI has developed models that predict treatment response without the need for a genotype, with only a small loss of accuracy. In July 2011, the RDI made these models available as part of the HIV-TRePS system. This version is aimed particularly at resource-limited settings where genotyping is often not routinely available. The most recent of these models, trained with the largest dataset so far, achieved 80% accuracy, which is comparable to models that use a genotype in their predictions and significantly more accurate than genotyping with rules-based interpretation itself. HIV-TRePS is now in use in approximately 90 countries as a tool to predict virological response to therapy and avoid treatment failure. The system has been expanded to enable physicians to include their local drug costs in the modelling. A recent study of data from an Indian cohort demonstrated that the system was able to identify combinations of three locally available drugs with a higher probability of success than the regimen prescribed in the clinic, including those cases where the treatment used in the clinic failed. Moreover, in all these cases some of the alternatives were less costly than the regimen used in the clinic, suggesting that the system could be not only help avoid treatment failure but also reduce costs.

In the first 2 years of being together the band had played over 200 shows across the United States, mainly focused in the states of Michigan, Ohio, Alabama, Florida and Georgia. Syren's rising popularity in the U.S. underground music scene and the demand for copies of their singles, 'Dehumanized' and 'Seasons' called for them to record their debut album at Song Garden Studios in Detroit, Michigan. It was at Song Garden Studios that the trio had the opportunity to sit in as session players for various artists from around the world including the likes of Michael Quatro, brother of renowned bass player/singer, Suzi. After the completion of the album, Syren were quickly booked up and toured across the mid-west and southern, U.S. to promote its release.

Second studio album, 'Something Has To Separate'  After moving to The Netherlands in 2010 Syren set to work on their 2nd studio album at Nemesis Studios in Den Helder. The new album, titled 'Something Has To Separate' would include 10 original songs written and produced by Syren and would take listeners on a journey through the pendulous emotions of love unrequited. The title track, 'Something Has To Separate' is one of many songs on the album featuring a new electric guitar sound by Bennett which takes Syren in a new direction from their debut album which featured only acoustic guitars. After all of the instruments had been recorded and the tracks produced by Jo and Erin, Syren once again relocated back to the United Kingdom where they set up 'Sapphic Studios'http://www.sapphicrecords.com in Scotland. There Erin laid down the album's vocals takes and recorded and arranged the strings played by Australian singer/songwriter and cellist Rebecca Wright for the song 'Special.' By August 2011, the album was being mixed by Erin and 'The Beast' at Bitch Studios, Scotland.  Cancer diagnosis and death of drummer Jo  In August 2011 Jo was diagnosed with metastatic Inflammatory Breast Cancer and received treatment by Doctors from the Beatson Oncology Centre in Glasgow. As Jo's wife, Erin put mixing Syren's 'Something Has To Separate' album on hold in order to support Jo. On January 11, 2012, Joanne Heeley died after her short but intense battle with the Inflammatory Breast Cancer. In April 2012, Erin released a solo track entitled, Never Give Up The Fighthttps://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/never-give-up-the-fight- single/id516070099 which was recorded, produced and mixed by her at Sapphic Studios and features cello by Rebecca Wright.

It is responsible for marketing and managing savings and retirement products issued and guaranteed by the Quebec government. The function of Épargne Placements Québec is to foster the financial security of Quebecers by offering them a range of savings and retirement products guaranteed by the Quebec government.  History  In the spring of 1996, Placements Québec was established by the Quebec government to achieve its funding objectives on the Quebec savings market and to offer a range of savings products better adapted to Quebecers' investment needs. Since 1963, the Quebec government had offered Quebec Savings Bonds. Before the creation of Placements Québec, the holder was issued a physical certificate as evidence that he held the purchased product. To redeem his bond, the holder had to present the certificate they had received at the time of purchase. With the creation of Placements Québec, the offering of savings and retirement products issued by the Quebec government was diversified to reflect Quebecers' savings need. In addition, with this new entity, physical certificates were replaced with the registration of savings products in a book-based system, i.e. the registration of a security in the holder's account.

Boultbee lived with his niece Charlotte in a thatched cottage known as The Cottage, which before the 19th century had been an inn, The Running Horse. After Charlotte's death in 1896, The Cottage became the vicarage, and is now a private home. Boultbee was also the benefactor for the village school, opened in 1865 and extended in 1885. The school operated until 1950. Boultbee also paid for the five alms houses, known as Boultbee Cottages, opposite the school. Designed by William Butterfield, they were built in 1871 and occupied by elderly people of the parish.

It lies on the western edge of the Southern Heath Nature Park, on the Lüneburg Heath, about 2 km south of the main village of Hermannsburg and currently has about 640 inhabitants. In 1973 Oldendorf was incorporated into Hermannsburg as part of the Lower Saxony regional and administrative reforms.  History  From the knapped flints that have been unearthed here, it can be concluded that the area around Oldendorf was settled as early as the Stone Age (8000 to 2000 BC). Oldendorf was first mentioned in the records in a document dating to AD 968 by the Saxon duke, Hermann Billung. At that time, a protective castle was built in Oldendorf, which was razed by the Wends in 959 and finally demolished in 1345. In 1620 the first school was established in Oldendorf. On 28 May 1785 a large fire broke out. As the houses of the time had thatched roofs and were built of wood, the fire spread very quickly. Within half an hour a total of 14 buildings fell victim to the blaze. On 20 April 1820 a second major fire broke out in Oldendorf. Nine farms and all their outbuildings burned down. The character of the village changed significantly as a result. On 10 August 1975 the largest forest fire in the Federal Republic of Germany broke out between Oldendorf and Eschede. Not until a whole week later, on 17 August 1975, was the fire extinguished. The River Örtze flows through the town in a north-south direction. The original village lies on the west bank of river. This is where the first three free farms in Oldendorf are supposed to have been. In the 1960s, a gravel works was built. First, only gravel from the old fish ponds on Schlüpker Weg was extracted, but later the operation was continually expanded towards Eschede. By autumn 2007, large-scale gravel extraction was under way. In 1986 a holiday home development of 32 small houses was established on the site of the first gravel pits to be exploited and subsequently abandoned. 400 houses had initially been planned, but were not approved. The gravel mines created large areas of water (the flooded gravel pits) which after a very short time provided a haven for many, sometimes rare, birds. The great crested grebe, coot and greylag goose breed here. Woodlark, goldeneye, little ringed plover, redwing, marsh harrier, reed bunting, reed warbler, teal, shoveler, pintail, wigeon and tufted duck can all be observed here; on rare occasions, osprey may be seen. Sand martins have created nesting holes in the banks. Today Oldendorf is dominated by agriculture and tourism.

In 1788 Field Marshal Johann Wilhelm von RedenLebenslauf von Johann Wilhelm von Reden was given the fief of Hermannsburg-Oldendorf by George III, prince-elector of Hanover and King of England, for his service as a soldier. He secured the field marshal's services particularly during the Seven Years' War (1756 to 1763) during which he was promoted from lieutenant colonel to lieutenant general. Johann Wilhelm von Reden died childless. He had, however, willed the fief during his lifetime to his two nephews, Friedrich Otto and Franz. On 5 November 1840 his heirs divided the fiefdom of Hermannsburg and Oldendorf between them. Each property was then about 500 ha in size.Jobst v. Reden im Dorfbuch von Oldendorf, 2007 The estate is still owned by the von Redens today.  Beutzen Farm (Hof Beutzen)  The parish of Oldendorf also includes the farmstead of Beutz. It is 1.5 miles south and was once owned by Julius Kothe and his wife, née Hartung. This Kothe family also owned the corn mill in Scharnebeck, where they also lived. Scharnebeck Mill lies to the north halfway between Oldendorf and Hermannsburg, on the Örtze. When the son and heir Traugott Kothe fell in the First World War, his father sold Beutz Farm in 1917 for 440,000 marks to a judge, Wilhelm Meyer, from Hanover. Judge Meyer was head of the Ilsede Ironworks (Ilseder Hütte) and Peine Mills (Peiner Walzwerke). He designated his wife, Anna Meyer, née Glenck, an actress, as the owner. In 1926, a turbine house was built on her premises which produced electricity for her own use from a water-driven turbine until the 1950s. The mill, that had previously been working, was closed. In 1933, Judge Meyer died and his wife sold the farm to Mr. Bertram, the Director of Hannover-Döhren Wool Washing, for 350,000 marks. In 1945 a children's home was established in the manor house of the farm by the Lobetal Institute, in which children, mainly orphans, of school and pre-school age, some seriously handicapped, were taught. In 1954 the orphanage closed in Beutz and moved to Stübeckshorn.Lobetalarbeit Stübeckshorn On 1 October 2007 the St. Paul Academy (ASP) rented the former manor house. Chairman of the Beutz Farm board of trustees (Johanneshaus Beutzen) is Prof. Dr. Paul Imhoff, who is also director of the ASP. The academy has since given the building up and it is now a spa house (Kurhaus). In the immediate vicinity of the farm is the Bornrieth Moor nature reserve. Part of this moor also belongs to the farm.

The name comes from Peter Heinrich Dehning (1781–1832), a carter (Fuhrmann) from Oldendorf, who had been looking for a place to set up a staging inn at this spot as early as 1804. After twice being rejected by the farmers from Oldendorf who had wood grazing rights there, he was granted a site, four morgens in area, on 11 May 1816, subject to various constraints. Dehning saw this place as suitable for a carter's tavern, because the Old Celle Military Road, from Hanover to Celle ran past here. They called the plot Sandschellen. This was a spot that was unsuitable for farming because it was covered with sandy soil. This name is still in common use by the villagers of Oldendorf today. Later, when new roads were built that no longer passed by here, the inn was closed. Around 1950 its then owner, Gustav Stucke, built another restaurant, which he called Zur Alten Fuhrmannsschänke (\\"The Old Carter's Tavern\\") The property was not connected to mains electricity. In the public rooms and guest rooms the tavern only had gas lights until the 1960s. Later, electricity was produced using a diesel generator set. In 1984 the tavern changed owners. Next a power cable was laid to the Dehningshof and a hotel with a guest house for riders was established. The tavern is still run in this form today, even though the owner has changed again. The E1 European long distance path runs right past the property.

Based on the novel Der Koenig der Bernina by , the film is about two lovers living in the Swiss Alps who struggle to be together and escape their loveless marriages. Eternal Love was the last silent film of both Lubitsch and Barrymore.The American Film Institute Catalog Feature Films: 1921–30. The American Film Institute, 1971.The AFI Catalog of Feature Films:Eternal Love The story was remade as a 1957 Austrian film The King of Bernina. Plot In 1806 in the village of Pontresina, Switzerland, a mountain man named Marcus (John Barrymore) is in love with Ciglia (Camilla Horn), a young village woman who has been rejecting the advances of Lorenz (Victor Varconi). The mischievous Pia (Mona Rico) throws herself at Marcus, but she is also rejected. Marcus and Ciglia profess their love, while the jealous and vindictive Pia looks on. Following the end of the French Army occupation, the people of Pontresina celebrate their liberation with a boisterous masked dance. At the party Ciglia becomes frightened of a drunken Marcus and she asks to be taken home. Marcus goes home confused. When Pia boldly attempts to seduce Marcus, he accepts her advances. The next day Ciglia receives permission from her uncle Tass (Hobart Bosworth) to marry Marcus. Pia and her mother approach Tass, and then confront Marcus. With Ciglia overhearing, they demand that Marcus marry Pia, who plays the cowering innocent. Ciglia leaves Marcus, and Marcus and Pia get married. Lorenz soon takes advantage of Ciglia and eventually they also get married. During a heavy snowstorm, Pia is worried about Marcus and tries to form a rescue party to find him. With no one willing to join, she turns to Lorenz and Ciglia. Ciglia overreacts to the news, making Lorenz suspicious about her affections. Ciglia soon discovers Marcus safely arriving in the village. Consumed in jealously and sorrow, Lorenz confronts Marcus, urging him to leave the village, even offering him money, but Marcus refuses. Later in the mountains, Lorenz ambushes Marcus and the two exchange gunfire. Marcus returns to the village, followed by the accusing and dying Lorenz. The villagers turn against Marcus despite Ciglia's cries of his innocence. Pia falsely accuses Ciglia of putting Marcus up to the murder of Lorenz. Soon the villagers turn into a mob and pursue Marcus and Ciglia into the mountains. With no other recourse, Marcus and Ciglia walk hand in hand into the path of an avalanche.

Behind them lies a wooded rise Potato field in Sweden. Pigs at a farm in Scania. Agriculture in Sweden differs by region. This is due to different soils and different climate zones, with many parts of the country being more suitable to forestry. It makes more economic sense to dedicate land to forestry than agriculture in the northern and mountainous parts of the country. The southern tip of Sweden is the most agriculturally productive. Sweden has quite short growing seasons in most parts of the country that limits the species and productivity of agriculture, but the south has the longest growing season, in some parts of the south in excess of 240 days. Wheat, rapeseed and other oil plants, and sugar beet are common in southern Sweden, while barley and oat are more important further north. Barley and oat are grown mostly for animal feed especially for pigs and poultry. The Central Swedish lowland is the traditional centre of agriculture in Sweden.  Swedish agriculture in figures  The Swedish agricultural sector (forestry and food industry not included) employs 177,600 people, which is 1.5 percent of the Swedish workforce. There are 72,000 farms and other agricultural business, which is half the number of 1970. The average farm has of fields. Dairy farming is the largest sector in economical terms, and is responsible for 20 per cent of the value of the Swedish agricultural production. Pork and poultry production is also relatively large, while sheep and lamb production is quite small. Sheep and lamb production and the production of wool cannot compete with Australian and New Zealand production as these countries have green pastures year-round. History Sugar beet plantation at Säbyholm estate in the late 19th century. Swedish Red cattle are the most common dairy cattle in Sweden. Agriculture and animal husbandry took place in the area (today's Sweden) already during the Stone Age. Barley was the most important crop, but wheat, millet and flax were also cultivated. The christianization of Sweden, around the year 1000, led to improvements in agriculture due to the influx of knowledge of more advanced cultivation methods from southern countries. During the entire medieval period, monasterial gardens served to spread foreign plants suitable for cultivation, and agricultural knowledge. During the time of Gustaf Vasa in the 16th century, who took a personal interest in the improvement of the royal properties, a period of agricultural flourishing started, and Sweden was regularly a cereal-exporting country. This lasted until the wars of Charles XII in the early 18th century, which took a heavy toll on the countryside population and meant that the cereal-producing Baltic provinces were lost. By the mid-18th century land reforms were initiated (storskiftet) which meant that scattered land plots around villages were progressively redistributed into coherent holdings, which gave the possibility for more rational farming. Swedish scientists also gave attention to the improvement of agriculture, with botanist Carl Linnaeus and agricultural chemist Johan Gottschalk Wallerius as the foremost representatives. However, the mercantilist views of the era guided most governmental activities. In the wake of the Finnish War of 1808-1809, agricultural improvements received significant interest from the Swedish government and private actors. An important role was played by the Royal Swedish Academy of Agriculture, which was founded in 1811, as well as by the Rural Economy and Agricultural Societies, which were founded in most Swedish counties around this time. The production of distilled beverages, brännvin, was regulated and the land reforms were continued. New areas, especially wetlands, were used for cultivation, and cultivation methods were improved. This was especially true for the production of fodder, which benefited from the cultivation of nitrogen-fixating plants such as clover and alfalfa. Many meadows were converted to farmed land with fodder crops, which significantly improved the amount of fodder available. Improved crop cultivation received most attention in the first half of the 19th century, while improvement of animal husbandry progressively came more in focus later in the century. Selected foreign breeds were purchased and made available in breeding stations. (1702-1864) All farms in Sweden were taxed based on their production capacity, so manorialism hit Sweden like a wave. Manorialism is a social and economic system that allows the wealthy to control the poor whilst providing for the needs of the poor. “About one-third of the land, in terms of mantal, was owned by the nobility in the early eighteenth century”(Olsson, Svenson, Agricultural Growth and Institution: Sweden). Due to two different enclosure movements, manorialism fell just as quickly as it came. In the 19th grain quickly became Sweden’s number one export (instead of being an import). =Growth of dairy sector and industrialization (1860–1960)= From the late 1860s, dairy production, and in particular production of butter, became more and more central to the Swedish agricultural economy. A progressively larger portion of the farmland was devoted to fodder production, and the farmed area increased until the 1920s. Milk- and dairy-related income was the most important source income for Swedish agricultural business around the turn of the century. This meant that the earlier Swedish cereal exports mostly vanished, and were replaced by imports of cereals for bread making. On the other hand, significant exports of butter started to take place, and later also of pork and live pigs. In the first years of the 20th century, Sweden exported 16,000-20,000 tons of butter per year. In the late 1940s, milking machines replaced hand milking and tractors started to replace the use of horses. Alfa Laval became a well-known manufacturer and brand of milking machines. In the 1950s, a large-scale mechanisation took place, using cheap supplies of petrol fuels. The Swedish agricultural workforce was reduced by 60 percent from 1945 to 1970, and labour was freed up for employment in the industrial sector. =Deregulation and re- regulation (1989–2000)= In 1989, Sweden deregulated its agricultural policy and finally scrapped many subsidies and price controls which originally had been introduced in the 1930s, when the agricultural sector experienced an economic crisis. In 1995, when Sweden joined the European Union, the Swedish agricultural sector again became subject to various regulations, via the Common Agricultural Policy.

Mama grizzly is a term that former U.S. vice presidential candidate and Alaska governor Sarah Palin coined to refer to herself that has since been applied to female candidates she supported or endorsed in the 2010 U.S. midterm elections (collectively called mama grizzlies). Palin first used the term in a May 2010 speech at a fundraiser for the Susan B. Anthony List, a pro-life women's group, and used it in a July 2010 YouTube video produced by SarahPAC, Palin's political action committee, for the 2010 elections. The persona largely served as a device by which Palin could \\"blend [her] feminine and masculine qualities and capabilities.\\" By September 2010, mama grizzly was deemed to be \\"part of the lexicon\\" of the election by Newsweek magazine. It has never been made clear if the term is meant to refer to all women candidates supported by the former governor, or if it is just a general concept about real-life moms entering politics because they fear for their children's future.Atal, Maha. Who Are The 'Mama Grizzlies'? Forbes. 2010-10-27. Background Alaska's state quarter, which was minted in 2008. The grizzly bear (Ursus arctos horribilis), a subspecies of the brown bear (Ursus arctos), is known for its aggressiveness; females are especially protective of their young. The state of Alaska is home to more than 70 percent of the grizzly population in the world. During her tenure as Governor, Palin chose a design showing a grizzly bear grasping a salmon in its mouth as Alaska's contribution to the 50 State Quarters series of commemorative coins. At the April 2007 unveiling of the design, Palin said, \\"I like to think this is a mama grizzly doing what she does best: taking care of her young.\\" Usage =Palin as a mama grizzly= Nearly one year later, while promoting the Alaska natural gas pipeline project to federal officials in Washington D.C., Palin said, \\"Don't tell me that we should ever be on our knees to any dictator because of our desperation for energy, not when we have supplies here at home.\\" Referring to her son's imminent deployment to the Iraq War zone, she added, \\"This mama grizzly ... has more reason than ever to protect our young.\\" By October 2008, Palin's usage of the bear metaphor to describe herself was reported in a New York Times article, \\"Provoking Palin's Inner Bear,\\" which quotes her as saying that negative media coverage about her children makes, \\"the mama grizzly bear in me [come] out, makes me want to rear up on my hind legs and say, 'Wait a minute.'\\" Soon, other media outlets began picking up on Palin's self-description. In January 2009, Margery Eagan of the Boston Herald penned a column, \\"Unbearable Mama Grizzly clawing way to Oval Office\\" in which she noted that a YouTube interview of Palin had nearly three quarters of a million views, proving \\"that mama 'grizzly,' as she called herself, remains irresistible.\\" The Vancouver, Washington newspaper, The Columbian, commented in January 2009 that, \\"Sarah Palin is on the prowl, snorting that when the media poke fun at her family, it brings out the mama grizzly in her.\\" The connection between Palin and mama grizzly was made internationally in July 2009 when the New Delhi, India-based Hindustan Times reported on a Palin tweet describing mama grizzly bears in Alaska. In August 2009, an opinion piece in The Columbian suggested that Sarah Palin could serve as a Mama Grizzly head of a third or a fourth U.S. political party. =Palin endorsed candidates as mama grizzlies= Palin addressing the 2008 Republican National Convention. During her speech, she called herself a \\"pit bull\\". Speaking before the pro-life Susan B. Anthony List organization in May 2010, Palin called certain novice female political candidates running in the 2010 election \\"momma grizzlies\\". Referring to her earlier self-description as a \\"pit-bull\\" in the 2008 U.S. Presidential election, she said, Later that day, Shannon Bream of the Fox News Channel reported that, \\"Palin says, women who she calls Mama Grizzlies will lead a national Republican wave in November.\\" In July 2010, Palin's political action committee, SarahPAC, released a video pushing the mama grizzly meme as representing herself and \\"her fiercely independent, common sense conservative\\" candidates. The day after the 2010 midterm elections, Palin released a video showing a montage of her winning grizzly candidates, a roaring grizzly bear, and narration in which she says \\"this is our morning in America\\". Publications such as Newsweek explored the impact of \\"Mama Grizzlies\\" on the 2010 election cycle, prominently featuring Palin-endorsed women candidates such as Michele Bachmann, Nikki Haley, Sharron Angle and Christine O'Donnell in cover art and photos accompanying the story.Krakauer, Steve. \\"\\"Newsweek cover story explores the mama grizzly phenomenon.\\" Mediaite. 2010-09-28. Retrieved 2015-07-29. The 2010 general elections placed a historic amount of Republican women in Congress and \\"many were also ... heralded by Sarah Palin as being 'Mama Grizzlies. However, these women did not affiliate themselves with the term or discussions about gendered identities at all. Criticism Emily's List, a political action committee that supports pro-choice female candidates, launched a website and a video ad called \\"Sarah Doesn't Speak for Me,\\" to oppose Palin, her \\"radical agenda,\\" and the candidates she had endorsed. In the video, women dressed as bears say they are \\"mama grizzlies\\" who fight for their cubs' right to choose, and that is why they oppose Palin and her candidates. Politico reporter Andy Barr described the ad as an attempt \\"to raise money off of Sarah Palin and the vitriol that she inspires\\". New York Times columnist Gail Collins said the use of the term made it seem as if there were more female Republican candidates running for high office than there actually were, and remarked that their Democratic counterparts \\"suffer from the lack of a cool name\\". In September 2010, Newsweek reported that mama grizzly was now \\"a familiar part of the lexicon\\" but questioned whether the grizzly candidates stood for policies that were good for women and children. Other uses On August 23, 2010, The Washington Post published an article titled \\"In South Dakota, Democrats' own 'mama grizzly' vs. 'the next Sarah Palin which uses the term to refer to South Dakota's Democratic party nominee for U.S. Representative, Stephanie Herseth Sandlin, as well as its Republican nominee, Kristi Noem, though at the time the article was written, neither candidate had been endorsed by Palin. In Slate, Noreen Malone used the term to describe conservative women at the Smart Girl Summit, and their effective use of social networking in 2010 political campaigns.

His father and his grandfather, who was also named Georg Rosen, were both noted Orientalists. His paternal grandmother Serena Anna Moscheles (1830-1902) and maternal grandmother Emily Moscheles (1827–1889) were sisters, and were of baptised Jewish parents, Ignaz Moscheles and his wife Charlotte Embden.Cf. . In 1917, the youngest Rosen served as a volunteer on the Western Front during the First World War. After the war he completed his studies in 1921 and joined the German diplomatic service, carrying the academic designation of a Ph.D.  Republic of China  From 1933 to 1938 Rosen was assigned to the German Embassy in China, acting as the Secretary of the Legation, and in 1937 worked in Nanking, the then-capital of the Republic of China. During this period he worked together with German businessman John Rabe after the Japanese invasion of China, and during the Massacre of Nanking. Along with other Westerners in the Nanking emergency committee, they established the Nanking Safety Zone in order to offer protection to the Chinese population of the region from Japanese atrocities carried out by their soldiers during the Nanking Massacre. The Massacre lasted more than six weeks spanning the end of 1937 through early 1938. Together, the committee members helped to save more than 200,000 Chinese lives. In 1938 he was forced to leave the diplomatic service due to his Jewish heritage and to avoid damaging the Nazi government's relations with the Japanese Imperial Army. Rosen then emigrated to London in 1938, and later to the United States where he taught at several universities. Rosen's role in the rescue of civilians was described in detail in the 2009 Sino-Franco-German movie John Rabe.  Post-war service  After the war, Rosen returned to the Federal Republic of Germany and again joined the foreign diplomatic service. He served at the German embassy in London, and in Montevideo, where he was an Ambassador. Rosen retired in 1960.John Rabe. \\"The Good German of Nanking\\", Hrsg. E.

It was launched as a freely available TV series on all IPTV platforms Limited edition DVDs were distributed to children's hospices around the UK on a NFP basis to raise funds for the excellent work and much needed resources these homes need. Main characters Jack (voiced by Cillian Martin Wright, the son of the producer) and Holly (voiced by Emilia Shuardson-Hipkin and later by Julianne Martin) are two best friends. Holly is the big sister that Jack never had. As 'Jack' actor Cillian Martin Wright puts it, \\"Holly is always there to take Jack and viewers by the hand and lead them through life's moral maze with advice and guidance.\\" Series philosophy The series is educational as well as entertaining. It includes a lot of factual material aimed at pre-school and primary school children, as well as stories. \\"I think it counters a lot of the very brash, bright colours, fast cut aggressive programming that is aimed at children,\\" said Director Jezz Wright in a 2010 interview with the BBC. \\"When we had our son five years ago we bought quite a few educational DVDs and we were quite horrified just how little educative content there was. It was a conversation you have one evening with the other half - 'come on we can do better than this' - and so the seed was planted.\\" \\"With the release of their second feature film (Cosmic Stories) this ethos caught the imagination of the British press with headlines around the world.\\" \\"We're a tiny team with a tiny fraction of Disney's budget\\" said producer Julianne Wright in a 2011 press release. \\"We hope we're delivering the sort of original content parents are looking for. Children's screen time has never been more contentious - that's why we believe all children's media should aspire to the highest educative standards.\\" The series was developed with the assistance of teachers and educationalists as well as parents in order to ensure that it would fit in well with British educational standards. The series also promotes inclusiveness and multi-culturalism. Jack is from ethnic origin whilst Holly is a typical 'English Rose' Caucasian- race|Caucasian character. This approach led them to set out to create a multimedia product that would encourage children to spend time away from the screen and enjoy reading, and would also give parents topics to discuss with their children. In their second animated series, Cosmic Stories, they include an on-screen timer that helps parents see how much time their child is spending in front of the television. Animation style The animation is created in a mixed media style derived from machinima, mixed in with live action footage. It uses a variety of software including Moviestorm, which allowed the animators to create the series quickly and on a low budget. Some of the live footage is blended with animation to create a unique look. Although the characters share some visual similarities with Japanese Anime characters and cartoons they have a distinctive design. They do not have legs, but instead they float, fly and hover. The color palette was designed specifically to appeal to younger children. The character design of both Jack and Holly were originally visualised by graphic artist Bonnie Scott & Jezz Wright, though it was modified extensively for the animated series before production began. Broadcast In November 2012 'Jack & Holly'launched their own Roku & IPTV channels. In November 2013 IPTV NewCo Toon Goggles & The Cartoon Club Network acquired broadcasting rights. The last broadcast was on 26 August 2015. Episodes of Jack and Holly are now available through various Apple and Android apps. Future There are no more episodes planned.

Director of the Taganka Theater (since March 2015). Biography Apeksimova was the child of classical musicians, Victor Nikolaevich Apeksimov and Svetlana Yakivna Apeksimova (passed away in August 2015). Irina was the second child in the family; her older brother Valery later became a jazz composer and pianist in the United States. Because her parents worked in the theater and music (her father taught at a music school and later taught piano at a conservatory, and her mother was choirmaster at the municipal Theater of Musical Comedy and later a choir conductor at a conservatory), Apeksimova was surrounded by talented and creative people. She often stayed backstage at the musical theater, where the child actors did their homework and played. Apeksimova's parents divorced when she was in the eighth grade, and she moved with her mother to Odessa, where she studied acting. After high school Apeksimova went to Moscow to enter the Moscow Art Theater School, but was rejected because of her Odessa accent. Back in Odessa, she joined the Odessa Opera Theater and danced for a year in the corps de ballet. She then applied again to the Moscow Art Theater School but was again rejected. After this setback, Irina returned to Volgograd and joined the Theater of Musical Comedy, in the corps de ballet. After living in Volgograd for a year, Apeksimova had shed much of her Odessa accent, and applied for a third time to the Moscow Art Theater School. She was accepted and admitted in 1986 into Oleg Tabakov's class. At the school, Apeksimova became friends with fellow student Valery Nikolaev, and later married him. Her class, which also included Vladimir Mashkov and Yevgeny Mironov, was considered especially brilliant. Apeksimova was graduated in 1990 and joined the studio at the Moscow Art Theatre, where she stayed until 2000. In 1994, she won the Best Actress Award at the Paris Film Festival for her role in the film October (Октябрь). Apeksimova is divorced and has a daughter, Dasha.

James M. Jasper, who originally coined the term, used it to help explain why people might join a social movement in the absence of pre- existing social ties with members. It denotes a kind of visceral unease, triggered by personal or public events, that captures people’s attention. Moral shocks often force people to articulate their moral intuitions. It is an appealing concept because it brings together emotional, moral, and cognitive dynamics.James M. Jasper, The Art of Moral Protest (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1997). According to David A. Snow and Sarah A. Soule, authors of “A Primer on Social Movements”, the moral shock argument says that some events may be so emotionally moving or morally reprehensible that individuals will feel that they must join the cause regardless of their connection or ties to members of that organization.Snow, David A., and Sarah Anne Soule. A Primer on Social Movements. New York, NY: W. W. Norton, 2010. Print. Moral shock is similar in many ways to shock advertising which uses analogous techniques to help increase brand success and awareness. Moral shocks have been shown to help recruit people to the animal rights movement,James M. Jasper and Jane Poulsen, \\"Recruiting Strangers and Friends: Moral Shocks and Social Networks in Animal Rights and Antinuclear Protest,\\" Social Problems 42 (1995), pp. 493-512. the movement for peace in Central America,Sharon Erikson Nepstad, Convictions of the Soul (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 2004). anti-abortion campaigns and anti-racist movements.Mark R. Warren, Fire in the Heart: How White Activists Embrace Racial Justice (New York: Oxford University Press, 2010). Deborah Gould has suggested another role for moral shocks: radicalizing or reinforcing the commitment of those already active in a protest movement. She says that the 1986 Bowers v. Hardwick decision by the U.S. Supreme Court had this effect on the U.S. gay and lesbian rights movements. Hardwick told the lesbian and gay community that their own government supported their oppression.Deborah Gould, Moving Politics (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2009). Indignation at one’s own government can be especially moving, as it involves a sense of betrayal. Furthermore, violent repression of peaceful protest is thus a frequent source of moral shock. The impact of moral shock is illustrated in the film Unborn in the USA in which the ProLife on Campus organization is highlighted in its travels to college campuses across the country. Using a set of extremely large and graphic images of abortion and abortion procedures the group attempts to portray their anti-abortion messages on college campuses—targeting young people who they believe are particularly prone to getting involved. They believe the images are very effective ways to shine light on the truth of what abortion does to innocent children. Unless the public is made aware of this perceived injustice, it will never be able to end, according to statements on their website. The group’s slogan is “Winning Hearts…Changing Minds…and Saving Lives…” ProLife on Campus.\\" Pro Life On Campus - Pro Life on Campus. 2009. Web. 04 Dec. 2011. http://www.prolifeoncampus.com/home. Brian Lowe suggests that moral shocks are especially likely when someone holds a sweeping movement ideology that takes the form of a “quasi-religion.”Brian M. Lowe, Emerging Moral Vocabularies (Lanham, MD.: Rowman and Littlefield, 2006). Jasper on Moral Shocks In Chapter 5 of The Art of Moral Protest, Jasper defines a moral shock as \\"an unexpected event or piece of information [which] raises such a sense of outrage in a person that she becomes inclined toward political action, with or without the network of personal contacts emphasized in mobilization and process theories.\\"The Art of Moral Protest, 106. For example, seeing a documentary about illicit banking practices may motivate an individual to participate in financial reform efforts. The motivation generated by a moral shock is, as the conceptual label makes plain, moral in nature; it operates at a level of normative force beyond just the purely cognitive or emotional. However, it is important to note that \\"for a moral shock to lead to protest, it must have an explicit cognitive dimension as well as moral and emotional ones.\\"The Art of Moral Protest, 180. Moral shocks are moral insofar as they create a sense of outrage or indignation, emotional insofar as anger or frustration accompanies this outrage, and cognitive insofar as the shock is delivered via words and symbols. For instance, the aforementioned documentary uses such cognitive devices to get its message across, but it also relies on emotional appeal and the resulting, normatively stronger, sense of moral outrage. Moral shock as a concept is especially important because it pinpoints a factor that motivates individuals to protest that is not reducible to factors highlighted by resource mobilization and political opportunity theories (e.g., social networks, preexisting beliefs). The Art of Moral Protest shows that would-be protestors do not always know other protestors and often formulate their beliefs on the fly, so to speak. Hence, Jasper’s concept is able to account for an additional path into protest, a path emphasizing the relative importance of events and their initial consciousness-raising effects on individuals.

'Subway Wars' was nominated for Outstanding Directing for a Comedy Series at the 63rd Primetime Emmy Awards. It originally aired on October 11, 2010.  Plot  While the gang hangs out at MacLaren's and after Barney disgusts the group with his plan to seduce a heartbroken woman, Marshall learns that his friend Max from law school has just spotted Woody Allen at a restaurant downtown. While Robin is interested in seeing him, the rest of the gang are not as they have seen him plenty of times. As they tease Robin about not being a \\"real\\" New Yorker, as she is from Canada, she tries to impress them by saying she has seen Maury Povich, but the gang is again unimpressed, as they have all seen him many times as well. The group debates what it takes to become a real New Yorker; Ted states it is stealing a cab from someone who really needs one, Lily argues it is crying on the subway and not caring what others think, while Marshall states it is killing a cockroach with one's bare hands. Robin admits that she has not done any of those things, but Future Ted states that by the end of the day, she would have done all three. The group then debate on the fastest way to get to the restaurant, and quickly decide to race each other there: Ted rides the bus, Lily takes the subway, Robin opts to hail a cab, Marshall decides to run there on foot, and Barney claims to have the fastest method of all while even enjoying a steak first at a nearby restaurant: he fakes a heart attack after eating the steak, then uses the ambulance ride to a hospital right next to the downtown restaurant as his quick transportation. His plan backfires, however, when the ambulance takes him to a hospital uptown, and he is forced to contact Ranjit for a ride. Meanwhile, Lily misinterprets the subway conductor's announcement that the subway is undergoing maintenance, and soon after exiting the train, it departs. Marshall is at first enthusiastic and confident that he can outrun everyone, though he soon begins to lose energy while on foot. Ted, having been stunned after receiving a negative review on a teacher rating website despite having received many positive ones, attempts to impress others riding with his knowledge of New York architecture, though he mainly bores and annoys them. Robin hails a cab, stealing it from a woman carrying bags who then angrily leaps on top of the windshield. Robin and the cab driver are freaked out, so Robin abandons the ride, and later rides along with Barney in Ranjit's car. During the ride, Robin angrily reveals to Barney that she had tried to talk to him about how low she was feeling recently due to her break-up with Don and feeling shunned and forgotten due to her overly-enthusiastic new co-anchor, yet Barney ignored her and tried to use her as a decoy while he eyed up a woman at the bar. Barney apologises to Robin, but she is not interested and leaves the car. Halfway through the race, the group all coincidentally meet up, and though Ted proposes they declare a tie, they immediately continue the race. Robin takes the subway, where she sees a poster up for her news show, with her co-anchor's face taking up much more space then hers. Enraged, Robin rips it down, only to see an older poster behind it with one of her and Don. Robin breaks down crying, snapping at the other passengers when they look in her direction. Lily spots her and comforts her, though she quickly abandons her and calls Ranjit in favor of the race. Barney rides a pedicab, though he quickly changes places with the driver to bike there himself. Lily has Ranjit pick up Marshall on the way, and the two discuss their concerns: Lily had been feeling dejected after having been unable to conceive a baby with Marshall for two months, and Marshall was feeling the same, believing it to be his fault. They then agree there is really no rush to become parents, and promptly decide to head to Coney Island to have fun. Ted, Barney, and Robin race for the finish; however, Barney trips, taking Ted down with him and allowing Robin to win the race. Future Ted tells his kids that, while Barney constantly denied it, he knew that Barney had spotted that Robin had been crying earlier, and purposefully tripped Ted and himself so Robin could win. Robin enjoys a meal with Max while Ted thanks Barney for letting Robin win. Max points out Woody Allen to Robin, who in fact turns out to be Maury Povich, although Future Ted states that Robin did see the real Woody Allen a couple of months later. Robin then kills a cockroach on the table with her hand, thus fulfilling all three tasks to become a real New Yorker.  Critical response  Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+ rating.

Britain Can Make It was an exhibition of industrial and product design held at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London in 1946. It was organised by the Council of Industrial Design, later to become the Design Council. Background Even before the end of World War II, it was recognised that post-war reconstruction of manufacturing and international trade of exported goods would require the widespread acceptance of industrial design as part of future British manufacturing. Accordingly, the Council of Industrial Design was founded in 1944 by the Board of Trade, as one of the first quangos. The exhibition In September 1945, only a month after the end of the war, the Council announced a national exhibition of design \\"in all the main range of consumer goods\\" to be held the following year. This was the 1946 Britain Can Make It exhibition, organized largely at the instigation of the Council's director, S.C. Leslie. The design of the exhibition itself was co-ordinated by Chief Display Designer, James Gardner. The exhibition was held from September to November at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London. Part of the reason for choosing this venue was that many of the museum's main exhibits were still in their wartime evacuation storage, outside London. The venue was undamaged by bombing, empty and available, and itself in need of an attraction to restore its pre-war visitors.  \\"What Industrial Design Means\\"  A major theme of the exhibition was didactic, in particular the display \\"What Industrial Design Means\\" which had been the first major commission for Misha Black and the Design Research Unit. Through Black's display, \\"The Birth of an Egg Cup\\" the role of the designer was presented as the crucial interchange between all the various aspects of design and production. Rather than merely show-casing goods on offer, the exhibition, and this display in particular, were a propagandist attempt to highlight the need to update British approaches to product design if manufacturing was to be successful in post-war competition. The audience was two-fold: the general public who were as yet unused to the notion of design as a distinct process, and also the existing manufacturers who clung to pre-war, if not Victorian, notions of how to run manufacturing industry. Black's design for the display was deliberately eye-catching, from a 13 feet high plaster egg at its entrance, to the continually-operating plastics moulding press making three thousand egg cups per day during the exhibition. This use of a working model in particular was commented on in surveys of exhibition visitors carried out by Mass Observation. Another Design Research Unit exhibit was their design and scale model for a railway coach, a double-decked third class sleeper. This represented two innovations for Britain, indicative of this egalitarian age: the first sleeper for third class rather than first, and also the technical development of fitting two levels into the restricted British loading gauge by the use of a well car.  Reactions to the exhibition  A popular reaction in the press was to term it, \\"Britain Can't Have It\\" as the country was still in the grip of wartime Austerity measures and the goods on display were intended for export. Reactions of those attending the exhibition were varied between the general public, the design intelligentsia and the manufacturers. Critics', such as John Gloag's, reactions were highly positive, congratulating the exhibition organisers both on the intellectual quality of their exhibition and also for the achievement of producing it during such a time of austerity. The public's reaction was less sophisticated, but still positive. Their view was generally that of simply wanting products in the shops that they could actually buy. The only real criticisms came from established manufacturers who largely failed to appreciate the exhibition's attempt to emphasise design and who still judged it as a simple shop-window display, of their same pre-war products.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map, accessed October 3, 2011 creek in New York's Capital District located in Schenectady and Albany counties. It flows southeasterly from its source in the town of Duanesburg near Delanson to its mouth at the Hudson River in the town of Bethlehem. In the town of Guilderland, the stream is dammed to create the Watervliet Reservoir, a drinking water source for the city of Watervliet and the Town of Guilderland. A one megawatt hydrolectric plant at the dam provides power to pump water to the filtration plant. The Normans Kill has a drainage area of over ,New York State Coastal Fish & Wildlife Habitat Rating and includes portions of Schoharie County along with the counties in which the Normans Kill itself flows through. The Normans Kill has been used historically as a source of water power during colonial times, during which many mills sprung up along its banks. Prior to the Industrial Revolution, blocks of ice were cut out of the creek for shipment to the city of New York as a form of early refrigeration. Its name is derived from the Dutch word for a Norwegian, who the Dutch called \\"North Men or Normans\\", hence North Man's Stream/Creek\\" the ethnicity of Albert Andriessen Bradt( originally spelled \\"Bratt\\"), an early settler who owned sawmills near the first waterfall of the creek in the early 17th century, and the word kill, Dutch for creek.

Locals call and spell it Normanskill (one word) Creek Geography The Normans Kill is over long with a basin that is over . The last is tidal. History Originally called \\"Tawasentha\\" (a place of the many dead), the Normans Kill is named for Albert Andriessen Bradt, a Norwegian immigrant to Rensselaerswyck. The creek is named for his Norwegian (Norman) heritage. He was one of the first Scandinavians to the Dutch colony of New Netherland. He was a tobacco planter and as such came to the area of the Normans Kill for that purpose. The tobacco which he planted of several years was never of any great quality, and he proceeded to construct two sawmills along the Normans Kill.

She first became known for her post- impressionistic style and incorporation of Fauvism. Her artwork is distinctive for its dry brush painting technique, gentle distortion of linear perspective, and use of thick line and brush strokes. She became widely known for her curated exhibition, View From Under the Microscope, which uses phytoplankton to garner awareness about climate change and ocean acidification.  Early life  Leeke was born in Columbia, South Carolina. She began her education at Columbia College, an all-girls, private liberal arts school, to study biology in hopes of becoming a veterinarian. During her second year she vacationed in Paris and visited the Louvre, where she fell in love with the French Impressionists and solidified her passion for painting. She also visited her most inspiring spot in France, Montmartre. She later transferred to the University of South Carolina where she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Journalism. Upon graduation, she worked in computer graphics and went on to work for six years at the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control as the Art Director. Leeke then worked at General Binding Corporation (GBC) in outside sales. Just a year after her employment at GBC, she began taking art classes again at the Columbia Museum of Art and used her spare time off work to attend art shows and sell work in Atlanta and Chicago. She also studied under Virginia Anderson and Ginger Munnerlin. Inspired by the French Impressionist masters, she further developed her own loose, abstract style. She was named by Charlotte's Red Sky Gallery as an Emerging Artist in 2006.. In the summer of 2008, she experimented with her palette by using a technique known as Color Field painting and began painting city and landscapes in bright, vibrant colors. She developed a brushstroke style, using acrylics in a way to give the appearance of oils and included \\"intense black lines.\\" Her company underwent a merger in 2008 and she took the opportunity to embark on her dream of becoming a full-time, self-supporting artist.  Art career  Leeke compares a series of art in a body of work to that of multiple product lines in sales. She has paintings produced in a series over time including: abstracts, landscapes, cityscapes, and the most recent conceptual works in digital media. Her travels to paint landscapes during plein air painting sessions led her to produce a body of beautiful abstract paintings inspired by nature's ever-changing scenery. Although some paintings may take up to a year, she generally prefers to make a painting alla prima, all in one sitting. More recently, she is inspired by photographers Susan Kae Grant of Texas and John E. Powell of Columbia, SC to produce a body of work combining conceptual art, photography and digital mixed media. Leeke has also painted and marketed silk scarves and other consumer products, such as mouse pads, coloring books, and greeting cards. Leeke has been invited to exhibit her art in New York, Chicago, Atlanta and has art collectors around the globe. = Subject, themes, and methods = While the majority of her art involves abstract cityscapes and landscapes, she also focuses on conceptual and science-based work.  Conceptual work  In 2014, she worked on a series of digital mixed media works that address the issues of consumerism and manufacturing excess by society's overconsumption. Leeke's concept for the show was to encourage consumers to choose more wisely and spend more for quality merchandise versus throwing it away.  Science-based work  Other themes explored in her work are based on science and biology. Leeke was awarded a grant by the Charleston Scientific and Cultural Education Fund to produce a traveling exhibition in 2015 entitled: View from Under the Microscope: Science-based Learning Through Art. The exhibition consists of 18 vibrant, digitally created paintings that educate the non-scientific community about the importance phytoplankton play in relation to all living things on the planet and the need to maintain healthy, sustainable oceans and water bodies. = Influence = Leeke’s work is inspired by South Carolina's coastal landscape as well as Columbia landmarks, New York, Paris and Venice. The quaint street scenes and sprawling landscapes found in her paintings strive to capture the essence of common events and convert them into lively images of color and movement. During her second trip to Montmartre, France in 2009, Leeke developed an interest in Fauvism and began to incorporate intense black lines into her work. Leeke's visits to Europe served as inspiration for many of her works. Her Columbia cityscapes often have the charming appeal of street scenes in Paris, like the painting, Nonnah's, in which she captures Columbia's vista and Paris' personality. She has been influenced by the works of French Impressionist masters, such as Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Maurice Utrillo, Georges Rouault, Edgar Degas, Édouard Manet, Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and Piet Mondrian. She was inspired by the way they conveyed social conscience, history and architecture. = Exhibitions = Selected exhibitions * 2008 – Piccolo Spoleto Vanishing Landscapes Exhibition * 2008 – McKissick Museum's \\"Spring for Art\\" exhibition. * 2008 – Florence Art Museum * 2009 – \\"Parallel 32, 47, 79, 56,\\" a selection of Leeke's landscapes of the South Carolina shore at the Courtyard Art Gallery in Charleston, South Carolina * 2009 – Showing of her work landscape and cityscape paintings, \\"Frame of Mind,\\" Columbia Museum of Art * 2009 – \\"One-of-a-Kind\\" show, New York * 2009 – \\"One- of-a-Kind\\" show, Chicago * 2010 – \\"Let It Snow,\\" works of 36 artists at The Newark School of the Arts Gallery * 2013 – Frame of Mind's monthly art shows * 2013 – Center for Contemporary Studies exhibition in Columbia. * 2010–2016 – Piccolo Spoleto USA  References   Further reading     External links  * American women painters Living people Columbia College (South Carolina) alumni University of South Carolina alumni Painters from South Carolina Artists from South Carolina 21st-century American painters American digital artists Women digital artists American abstract artists American art People from Columbia, South Carolina 20th-century American women artists 21st-century American women artists Year of birth missing (living people) ","title":"Alicia Leeke"},{"id":"29070448","text":"Tetrabromoauric acid is an inorganic compound with the formula HAuBr4.

Script Ancient History, Dramatists Play Service, Inc., 1996, , pp2-3 Plot The play opens with the ominous ringing of an off-stage telephone. As the lights come up Ruth and Jack, a couple in their mid- thirties, are dancing in their apartment. The telephone rings again, the couple stops, the music backs up a few measures and they begin to dance. Ruth and Jack dance on and converse about what a good time they are having; after a few lines the telephone rings, the music backs up a few measures and the conversation also goes back a few lines and this time changes direction. A few lines go by and the phone rings again, and the conversation once more rewinds and restarts, yet again changing focus. This pattern of rewinding and restarting the conversation in a different vein continues throughout the play whenever the unseen telephone rings. This convention is similar to the bell ringing in Ives's previous work Sure Thing (one of six plays in the collection All in the Timing). As the play progresses the audience learns that the couple is in a tenuous state in their relationship and the happiness seen as the play opens is not the prevalent mood. Ruth is Jewish; Jack is a former Catholic. Ruth believes in hard work and success; Jack is lazy and has no goals. Ruth desperately wants to be married; Jack hates the idea of marriage. With each ring of the phone, the love affair dissolves into a more intense argument about religion, the future or marriage; however, this does not prevent a build-up of hope with each ring that perhaps the couple may work out their differences and come to an agreement. At one point Ruth and Jack even switch positions: Jack argues for marriage, Ruth argues against it, and it is this final argument that leads to the dissolution of their relationship. After a slew of “fuck you’s” from Jack and “leave’s” from Ruth, the two realize they can no longer be together, but they also do not know how to function without one another. The play ends with a final phone ring and the couple beginning to dance as they did in the start of the play.

His younger brother was John Thomas Quekett, whose contributions to the same fields of research have a greater renown. Their eldest brother, William Quekett, was a rector and author. He received his medical training at University College Hospital, and practised as a surgeon in Wellclose Square, Whitechapel. In 1835 he became lecturer on botany at the London Hospital; he was elected a fellow of the Linnean Society in 1836. It was at his house in 1839 that the meetings were held in which the Royal Microscopical Society originated. He died on 28 June 1847 of diphtheria, and was buried at Sea Salter, Kent, near the grave of Elizabeth Hyder, to whom he had been engaged, but who had died of consumption on the day arranged for their marriage in September 1841. His name was commemorated by John Lindley in the Brazilian genus of orchids, Quekettia, which contains numerous microscopic crystals. Fifteen papers stand to Edwin Quekett's name in the Royal Society's Catalogue of Scientific Papers (v. 53), mostly dealing with vegetable histology, and contributed to the Transactions of the Linnean and Microscopical Societies, The Phytologist, the Annals and Magazine of Natural History and the London Physiological Journal between 1838 and the date of his death.

He is currently living with his wife Anicka daughter Emily and son Jeremiah in Libčice nad Vltavou, Czech Republic. Life He was born in 1958 in Huntsville, Alabama and moved to West Springfield, Virginia. At 13 he started rock climbing at Seneca Rocks, West Virginia. In the spring of 1975 Jesse Guthrie placed the first bolt at Seneca Rocks, causing a controversy and subsequent critique of climbings future. After graduating high school in 1975 he climbed throughout North America in places like Boulder Colorado, Yosemite California and the Shawangunk Ridge, before becoming a professional bareback rodeo rider in 1978. In 1979 he won the Virginia state champion bareback riding belt buckle and award. In the following years he became one of the No. 1 ranked riders of the American Rodeo Association. In 1984 he went to Germany where he met Wolfgang Güllich, Kurt Albert and Jerry Moffatt (\\"This was the beginning of my true climbing career.\\")Jesse Guthrie: Life of a Nomad Climber; Published by lulu to climb in the Frankenjura and in the Verdon Canyon in the South of France.

It is 345 miles (556 km) north of Windhoek. It is located in Ondonga-Omulonga Constituency. It is situated just south of Oshigambo village. Onamukulo village is divided into two parts and is separated by the main road running through from Ondangwa to Oshigambo. The two parts of the village are known as Omiye (the cooker shops side, on the right side of the road) and the true village (on the left side of the road) but run and administered by one headman, Tom Nakathingo. It has 80 homesteads with an average of 5 people per homestead. The inhabitants in this village have homesteads made of tree poles cut in the forest found in Okaonde area. But due to the high growth rate, suitable trees are now becoming scarce, and the forest is slowly but surely being destroyed, which has led the new generation planning to build houses to use alternative materials, such as bricks, mud, thatch, mesh-wires, etc. Onamukulo is rich in fertile soils, thus they depend on farming for survival. Their farming activities include mahangu cultivation, herding cattle, goats and donkeys, but the village usually receives poor rainfall, and thus they have difficulties in keeping sheep and horses, although they are found in very low quantities. These community has numerous kindergartens, no primary school, one combined school (Onamukulo combined school) and no high school. They have numerous soccer fields, one volleyball field, one netball court and thus soccer, netball and volleyball are the only recognised sports in the village. Currently, the power supply reaches the combined school and cucashops, but plans to extend it to each homestead are in progress, and more development is to be started after this. There is a school in Onamukulo Village that has semi-state of the art equipment that range from computer equipment to science equipment. There is a very good man that is a principal Mr. Naftal Haimene. There education at the school is very hash hash, teachers are friendly and helpful.

For five years he was moderator of the Consolidated Baptist Educational Association, and he promoted the establishment of what is now the Simmons College of Kentucky. Green suffered from racial intolerance all his life. In 1883, when he was an elderly and respected minister, he was assaulted and beaten for failing to comply with a demand to give up his seat on a train. Early years Elisha Green was born in Bourbon County, Kentucky. At the age of ten he was taken from his mother and became the slave of the Dobbyns family in Mason County, Kentucky. He married Susan Young in 1835. In 1838 his wife was sold to a Mrs. Sissen, who in turn sold her to a slave trader. His master purchased Susan from the trader and reunited the two but later was forced to sell them both when his business failed. He bought them back in 1845. Baptist leader In the early 1840s, Green became a sexton at the white Baptist church in his town, and began to worship regularly among the white men. Some of the deacons saw his promise and asked his master to give them permission to license him as a preacher. On 10 May 1845 Green was given a licence to preach at the First African Baptist Church in Paris, Kentucky. Later he became a pastor in Maysville, Kentucky, as well, and was allowed to travel freely between the two towns. In November 1848, a group of white men from the Baptist church in Mason County loaned Green $850 to purchase his and his family's freedom from Dobbyns, a loan that he was able to repay from his earnings as a preacher. After being freed he started a whitewashing business to earn income for his family. Green also practiced other trades including chair caning, shoe repair and carpentry. At the same time, Green began to work with other \\"colored\\" Baptist leaders such as George Washington Dupee to organize and expand the church. Green thought that freedmen needed to own land. He and a white landowner founded the African American community near Paris. After the end of the American Civil War (1861–1865) Green became politically active, and was chosen as vice president of the Kentucky Negro Republican Party at the party's 1867 convention in Lexington. Soon after the State Convention of Colored Baptists in Kentucky had been formed in 1865, Green proposed it should set up a school. First called the Kentucky Normal and Theological Institute, it is now known as the Simmons College of Kentucky. He was the moderator of the Mount Zion Baptist Association for eleven years, and for five years was moderator of the Consolidated Baptist Educational Association. Racial persecution Green suffered from racial bigotry throughout his life. After he had purchased his freedom, he was often accosted while he was travelling between his churches, and asked whose slave he was. Since an explanation that he was free would arouse suspicion, he would answer \\"Mr. Green\\". In the mid-1850s, on his way to Paris with his wife, Green found his son John, with his hands bound, on his way to being sold \\"down the river\\". Despite frantic efforts, he was unable to persuade the owner to at least look for a local buyer. He was helpless to protect his son. In 1855, when he was preaching at George Dupee's church in Georgetown, a white man carrying a stick entered the church and asked if there was a white man present. When he was told there was not he demanded that Green leave the pulpit. In 1883 Green, by then an elderly and respected church leader, was traveling by train between Paris and Mayfield. A white minister, who was head of a girls' school, boarded the train with a party of pupils and staff. He rudely demanded that Green give up his seat. When Green refused he was attacked and beaten, suffering injuries to his head and hand. Green sued and won damages of $24 for the assault. Reports of the incident and its outcome did nothing to delay disenfranchisement of African Americans and the growing movement among whites for segregation.

The origins of the design go back to 1987, and the first train was built in 1990–1991. Production of \\"Yauza\\" was discontinued in 2002 due to ongoing reliability issues.  History  The 81-720/721 \\"Jauza\\" subway cars. The automated train control system \\"Vityaz-1\\" was developed by JSC \\"Research Institute of Instrument them. Tikhomirov \\". [1] In 1993, at the Polezhaevskaya subway station, Russian President Boris Yeltsin, Prime Minister V.S. Chernomyrdin, and Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov attended the ceremony marking the debut of the new trains, consisting of 81-720 (lead) and 81-721 (intermediate) cars numbered 001-002-003-004-005. The new cars deviated significantly from the traditional design. The body is made of stainless steel, painted in a yellow-gray color scheme as opposed to the traditional blue color scheme used on previous models. The lead cars had a distinctive modern design at the cab end. Other improvements included the addition of ceiling fans (as opposed to air ducts used on the older series cars), cab air conditioning and heating systems, more standee room (increasing the capacity of each car by 30 - 40 people), bigger cab, and a new design of the trucks. The original design featured padded bench seats matching the contours of the human back, however this design was soon dropped and subsequent models were built with the standard anti-vandal plastic seats. The cars had DC-120 type traction motors (4 per car) and a thyristor-pulse control system developed by AEC \\"Dynamo\\", as well as regenerative breaking, recycling energy back into the third rail, allowing the cars to operate smoother, quieter, and more efficiently. The maximum design speed was increased to 100 km/h vs 90 km/h for the 81-717/714 and earlier classes of cars due. The cars featured an automatic sprinkler system that would instantly form a water cloud inside the car in the event of a fire, however there are also fire extinguishers in each car. In late 1992, a new experimental version of Yauza came out, equipped with Dinamo-made AC traction motors. Tests were carried out in the suburban ring VNIIZhT Sherbinka. Since there is no third rail at the test site, the train was temporarily fitted with a pantograph to collect power from overhead wires, which were set to provide 850 V of current. Unfortunately, the cars have not been completely trouble-free. Often numerous mechanical or structural difficulties were encountered. The Yauza trains operated regularly on the Kakhovskaya until 2019 and Lublin-Dmitrov lines: 6 81-720/721 trains built between 1991 and 2002 on Kakhovskaya Line and 3 81-720.1/721.1 trains built in 2004 on Lyublinsko-Dmitrovskaya Line. No further production runs were made and the Moscow Metro chose instead to purchase more 81-717/714.5M and brand new 81-740/741 models. The rest of the service on the Lublin-Dmitrov line is provided by 81-717/714.5M and 81-717/714.6K trains. It is planned to eventually transfer all 81-720/721.1 cars to the Kakhovskaya line. Several surplus 81-720/721 cars remained on JSC \\"Metrovagonmash\\" property until 2010, before being scrapped to give space for the ongoing production of the future 81-760/761 cars, and one 81-721 car remained stored in the \\"Krasnaya Presnya\\" depot prior to disposal in August 2013. The remaining cars would later be scrapped due to reliability issues, with the final train being withdrawn in August 2019. Gallery File:Metro wagon 81-720 \\"Jauza\\".jpg Metro wagon.

Supertree algorithms can highlight areas where additional data would most usefully resolve any ambiguities. The input trees of a supertree should behave as samples from the larger tree.  Construction methods  The construction of a supertree scales exponentially with the number of taxa included; therefore for a tree of any reasonable size, it is not possible to examine every possible supertree and weigh its success at combining the input information. Heuristic methods are thus essential, although these methods may be unreliable; the result extracted is often biased or affected by irrelevant characteristics of the input data. The most well known method for supertree construction is Matrix Representation with Parsimony (MRP), in which the input source trees are represented by matrices with 0s, 1s, and ?s (i.e., each edge in each source tree defines a bipartition of the leafset into two disjoint parts, and the leaves on one side get 0, the leaves on the other side get 1, and the missing leaves get ?), and the matrices are concatenated and then analyzed using heuristics for maximum parsimony. Another approach for supertree construction include a maximum likelihood version of MRP called \\"MRL\\" (matrix representation with likelihood), which analyzes the same MRP matrix but uses heuristics for maximum likelihood instead of for maximum parsimony to construct the supertree. The Robinson-Foulds distance is the most popular of many ways of measuring how similar a supertree is to the input trees. It is a metric for the number of clades from the input trees that are retained in the supertree. Robinson-Foulds optimization methods search for a supertree that minimizes the total (summed) Robinson-Foulds differences between the (binary) supertree and each input tree. A recent innovation has been the construction of Maximum Likelihood supertrees and the use of \\"input- tree-wise\\" likelihood scores to perform tests of two supertrees. Additional methods include the Min Cut Supertree approach, Most Similar Supertree Analysis (MSSA), Distance Fit (DFIT) and Quartet Fit (QFIT), implemented in the software CLANN.  Application  Supertrees have been applied to produce phylogenies of many groups, notably the angiosperms, eukaryotes and mammals. They have also been applied to larger-scale problems such as the origins of diversity, vulnerability to extinction, and evolutionary models of ecological structure.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building, and is under the care of the Churches Conservation Trust. History Although it is situated away from the present city centre, at the time the church was built it was at the heart of the city. In the Domesday Book it is recorded that Leicester had six churches, and it is assumed that All Saints was one of these. In 1143 it was given to Leicester Abbey. The church was enlarged in about 1300 when aisles were added. During the following century the tower and the nave were raised and new aisle roofs were built. The church was used for secular as well as sacred purposes. In 1418 Margery Kempe was tried for Lollardy (for being a follower of John Wycliffe) in the church. In 1583, during outbreaks of the plague, the assizes were held in the church. Later the local population and businesses in the city moved elsewhere in the city, and All Saints parish combined with other local parishes. In the early 19th century the fabric of the church was deteriorating, and in 1829 the chancel was demolished and rebuilt. The local architect Henry Goddard added new seating and extended the gallery in 1843, and in 1855–56 he restored the roofs. In 1874–76 Joseph Goddard and Alfred Paget undertook a restoration involving the addition of new windows, building a new nave roof, and removing the gallery. The tower was restored by William Basset-Smith in 1894–95. A new road system was built in the city in the 1960s which isolated the church. The chancel was divided from the rest of the church to form a meeting room, but numbers attending the church continued to decline. It closed in 1982 and was then used as a store. In 2020 the church had a fire. The church was declared redundant on 1 January 1983, and was vested in the Churches Conservation Trust on 8 July 1986. Architecture =Exterior= The chancel of All Saints is constructed in brick, while the rest of the church in stone; the roofs are in slate. Its plan consists of a six-bay nave with a clerestory and north and south aisles, a four-bay chancel with a roof at a lower level, and a northeast tower. There are three parallel roofs, the roof over the nave being higher than those over the aisles. The west doorway is Norman in style, and the rest of the church is in geometrical and Decorated styles. The west front contains a round-arched doorway, decorated with chevrons, a five-light window at the end of the nave, and four-light windows at the ends of the aisles. Along the walls of the aisles are buttresses, and along their tops are plain parapets. There are three-light windows along the aisles and the clerestories. In the westernmost bay of both the south and north aisles are doorways. There is a clock and a gabled wooden bellcote above the south doorway, and a quatrefoil window over the north doorway. The east window has three lights, and is in Perpendicular style. The tower is in three stages. The lowest stage has 12th-century angle pilasters with an unusual semicircular cross-section, and a west doorway with a pointed arch dating from the 13th century. In the upper stages are diagonal buttresses. The top stage has two-light transomed bell openings with louvres. On the summit of the tower is an embattled parapet. =Interior= In the nave are six-bay arcades carried by octagonal piers. The chancel arch is blocked. The nave is floored with a mixture of medieval tiles, grave slabs, parquet flooring under the pews, and 20th-century concrete elsewhere. In the south aisle is a tomb recess and two piscinae. The font dates from the 13th century, and is richly carved. The polygonal pulpit dates from the 15th century, and stands on a 19th-century base. The clock over the south doorway dates from about 1620, and has faces on both the interior and the exterior of the church. Around the church are wall monuments. The west window of the tower contains medieval stained glass. The other stained glass dates from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and includes work by Heaton, Butler and Bayne, and by Clayton and Bell. There is also a war memorial window by Morris & Co. Exterior features In the churchyard is the table tomb of Gabriel Newton, a local politician and founder of the local Bluecoat School, who died in 1762.

History Heraldic shields of the Delft Water Board members in 1645, the year that the Water Board bought this house for board meetings, on the facade of the Gemeenlandshuis in Delft. Heraldic shields of the Halfweg Water Board members in 1646, the year that the Water Board built this house for board meetings, on the facade of the Gemeenlandshuis Zwanenburg in Halfweg. Keystone on the Waterschapshuis in Onderdendam; \\"Dei nait wil diek'n mout wiek'n\\", which loosely translated means \\"Whoever doesn't like dike-building will need to travel for a living\\" Early flood control in the Netherlands is often called the Teerschouw, which loosely translated means \\"consumption during observation\\".Dutch dictionary definition of the word Teerschouw This technique was a periodic check of the local dike system by the Dike-reeve and his men. If they found a problem, they would simply go to the nearest house or inn, and stay there for free until the problem was fixed. This was a fairly direct and simple form of water management. These measures were rarely necessary, since the local people took water management very seriously. The Dike-reeve and his men (themselves local representatives of smaller water board agencies) mostly met to discuss major issues and water improvements, and though they met at each other's homes until the 16th century, as the country grew and the water management issues became more complex, halls were purchased to meet each other regularly. The Water Boards became governing bodies much like a town hall became a meeting place for the city council. In most Dutch cities, especially those on a river or located at a seaside port, the Gemeenlandshuis was the same size as the Town Hall. Examples can be seen today in Leiden, home to the Gemeenlandshuis van Rijnland, and Delft, home to the Hoogheemraadschap van Delfland. The Gemeenlandshuis in Delft houses the main office of the Delfland Water Board. The Late-Gothic building, situated on the Oude Delft 167, was built in 1505. The first owner was Jan de Huyter, bailiff of Delft and steward of Delfland. Later occupants were Philips, Count of Hohenlohe who was married to Maria of Nassau, a daughter of Willem of Orange. The Delfland Water Board has been established here since 1645. The building contains a large collection of old maps of Delfland. A large number of Coats of Arms (or heraldic shields) cover the sandstone façade . Fortunately the façade was spared during the fire of 1536 which burned through the city of Delft. The main entrance to the Delfland Water Board is now situated on the Phoenixstraat where more recently buildings been added on. Borders of jurisdiction Cornelis Springer's The Gemeenlandshuis and the Old Church, Delft, Summer (1877) The Water Boards governed territories that spanned several municipalities. Because of the complications this extra dimension gave to local governance, city planning was done as much as possible in accordance with water management plans. To save time, the meetings were done as much as possible near to the areas in question. This meant that the Dike-Reeve and his men needed to travel a lot. Since the Water Boards received their own income from taxes, they had enough money to spend on meeting halls, and they built meeting halls for convenience in out-of-the-way places. For this reason many meeting halls were unusually large that were located in very small towns, such as the Gemeenlandshuis Zwanenburg in Halfweg, or the Waterschapshuis in Onderdendam. These were locations that were strategically suited for meetings when the waterworks were being inspected.

Lasart began working as a coach in 1996, and managed several clubs over the next decades including Nacional where he also had played. Playing career Lasarte was born in Montevideo to a Spanish father and an Uruguayan mother, with the former having immigrated from the Basque Country and the latter also having Basque descent. In his country, he represented C.A.

Abroad, Lasarte played four seasons for Deportivo de La Coruña in Spain. In 1990–91, he helped the Galicians return to La Liga, appearing in 35 complete matches the following campaign as the side finally avoided relegation; he also acted as team captain in several games. Coaching career Lasarte's career as manager began at the age of 35 with Rampla Juniors, which he led to the second position in the Primera División in the 1996 Clausura.

However, Roeloff Jansz was not an uncommon name. According to popular belief Roeloff Jansen (1602-1637) was born on the island of Marstrand in Bohuslän, Norway. In 1623, Jansen married Anneke Jans (1605-1663) who was from Flekkeroy, in Vest Agder, Norway. Following the birth of their first three children, they emigrated to New Netherland in 1630. The couple settled in first Rensselaerwyck near what is now Albany, New York, where Jansen had an engagement as a tenant farmer for Kiliaen Van Rensselaer. About 1634, he moved his family to New Amsterdam where he acquired a 62-acre farm on Manhattan Island, today in the Tribeca area of lower Manhattan. After his death, his widow married Domine Everardus Bogardus. Willem Frijhoff suggests it more likely refers to Roelof Jansz Haes , an alderman in Manor of Rensselaerswyck who was a trader in Beverwyck about 1634. By one account, he and some others were returning from New Amsterdam one winter when their boat became icebound for several days. They crossed the ice to shore and exploring the area, discovered the stream. They named it after the highest ranking member of the party, who was the alderman. This story is sometimes conflated with that of Roeliff Jansen of Marstrand.Frijhoff, Willem.

The three refuges were the Chacabuco, the Yapeyú and the Maipo. The work requested 63 days, travelling about using sled pulled by dogs. For the construction of the Chacabuco refuge, the army team made 17 trips from the Yapeyú refuge. Trips were hampered by the slopes of the area, the presence of ice and wind storms that exceeded 200 kilometres per hour.

The film deals with a young man who has sent news of his upcoming nuptials and his plans to get married in his hometown to his parents and the people of hometown he speaks of. However, the woman they think he is going to bring with him is actually a man. Plot In an Alpine village in Bavaria, divorcee Katharina Remminger lives alone. Her husband had long ago left her for another woman, and her only son Hans lives in Berlin where he studies architecture. She receives a letter from her son Hans one day, informing her that he is engaged and wants to get married in his home town, and that he and his fiancé Nicki will be visiting in the upcoming week. Having never heard or even seen a picture of Nicki, Katharina assumes that it's a female name and becomes elated at the thought of her son getting married and that she should one day become a grandmother, and in her excitement tells the whole town of Hans' news, and soon the town is abuzz about the upcoming nuptials. When Hans and Nicki arrive at Katharina's doorstep however, Katharina is shocked to say the least. She has never had to deal with homosexuality before and isn't quite sure how to. She lets them in, but after a neighbor who sees Hans comes in asking where the bride to be is, Katharina tells her that Nicki is the best man, and that the bride is sick and stayed in Berlin. When the neighbor leaves, Hans argues with his mother which leads to Katharina kicking them out of her house. It's Hans' dream to get married in his hometown however, so with Nicki's support they decide to stay and check into a hotel until they can come up with a plan to bring Hans' mother to her senses and still get married in Han's hometown. In the meantime, Hans shows Nicki around town, which leads to a local spotting the couple kissing while out on the lake. Soon news of Hans being gay becomes the talk of the town, and the prejudices of the citizens begins to show. When Hanz runs into his estranged father, Christian who is an auto dealer, he informs him of his homosexuality to which Christian doesn't react well and simply walks away. Christian tells his second wife Vera about Hans' news, and she is shocked and then worried because Hans is about to open a second car dealership, and she is worried that his having a gay son will keep customers away. More obstacles come and go, Katharina's friends avoid her and she has been kicked off the church choir, and Christian's friends constantly make gay jokes behind his back and in front of him, and when Hans shows Nicki the place he wants to get married at, an old friend gets into a fight with him which leads to a large brawl in which almost everyone comes out bruised. This drives NIcki to give up and go back to Berlin. Things begin to look all right for Hans and his relationship with his parents however. Slowly they are beginning to accept him and his orientation. However they eventually get into another argument because they said that Hans was being unfair to them by never telling them about his homosexuality and then just showing up and expecting them to be 100% ok with everything. Soon after this, Hans also returns to Berlin, and they believe that it was because of that argument. However it soon comes out that Christian's second wife Vera, had been spreading a rumor that Hans was not Christian's biological son, and that he only ever said that he was to protect Katharina's honor. Hans had heard this rumor and this is what had driven him to leave. It is only sometime afterward at the opening of Christian's second auto dealership that he hears of the rumor, and makes an announcement telling everyone that despite what he had heard he is Hans' birth father. He then goes to Katharina (who had also just learned of the rumor and went to confront him about it) and apologizes, telling her it was Vera who started the lie. Vera then begins arguing with them both. Furious, Kathrina punches Vera, and Katharina and Christian drive to Berlin together to talk to Christian. They meet and apologize for everything, and tell the couple that they have their support and that they would host a wedding for them. And they do indeed, getting everyone who previously were against them (except Vera) to show up and give Hans the wedding he always wanted. The events of the film also brought Christian and Katharina back together again, so the ending is especially happy for Hans. The movie then ends with the very same church choir that temporarily kicked off Kathrina, giving a surprise performance of \\"All You Need Is Love\\" by The Beatles.

Its name derives from the Nahuatl words ome (two) and tepetl (mountain), meaning two mountains, given that it is formed and practically the whole island is formed by two volcanoes: Concepción and Maderas. The Island Ometepe has an area of 276 km². It is the largest volcanic island located within a lake. The population is estimated at 42,000. The island has two larger cities, Moyogalpa and Altagracia that also are the main access ports to the island. There are an enormous amount of prehispanic statues, petroglyphs and pottery found on the island, and the area is believed to be an important ceremonial center for its ancient inhabitants. =History= There is evidence that the island was inhabited at least since 1500 BC. Apparently this population would be part of a migration movement originated in South America with final destination in Mexico. On the island found ceramic and large sculptures carved basalt rock have been found, that are exhibited today in the Park of Altagracia Church and the Managua National Museum. These sculptures are attributable to the same style as those found in the Zapatera Island by the Chorotega culture. Some petroglyphs were also found in the island made from 300 AD. The conquistadores found the country occupied by numerous towns dedicated to the practice of the arts and peaceful industries. Dr. Berendt, great explorer and scholar of Aboriginal people of Central America, in the light of philological results obtained by himself and American diplomat Ephraim George Squier (1849), and traditions preserved mainly from Oviedo, Torquemada and Herrera, believed that the chorotegan, Cholutecas, Dirianes and Orotinas were descendants of people that migrated from Cholula, Mexico. These people occupied the greater part of the country from the Gulf of Fonseca to Nicoya, its territorial continuity was interrupted in the vicinity of current Leon by the Marabios and again by an Aztec colony that occupied the narrowest part of the strip of land between the Pacific and the Nicaragua Lake and the lake islands. The King and the capital of this nation was named Nicarao (Conference read before the American geographical society, July 10, 1876, by Dr. C. H. Berendt). The former inhabitants of this region left abundant relics of their civilization in mounds, cemeteries, etc. (Bransford, J.F. 1881. Introduction, p. 4) The first archaeological report on the Ometepe material came to light with the 1852 publication \\"Nicaragua, its people and landscapes\\" by American diplomat E. G. Squier, who explored the area in 1849. In December, 1872, the Navy Department sent an expedition under the command of Commander E.P. Lull, USN, to Nicaragua, to complete the studies initiated in the spring of that year for an inter-oceanic canal. (For valuable information on the country, see the report published by the Navy Department, 1874 on studies for a canal through Nicaragua.) J.F Bransford, was a medical officer assigned to expeditions, with instructions to perform general scientific research on natural history, etc., of the country. He visited the Ometepe Island and while searching for antiquities, he managed by chance to see a ditch which had been recently excavated, in which were exposed funerary urns. This was an estate that belonged to don José Angel Luna, near Moyogalpa. (Bransford, J.F. 1881. Preliminary Note, p. 1) In 1876, he was sent to Nicaragua in particular service related to the study, and was instructed to perform archaeological research in the Ometepe Island. He was in the country from January to mid-May, more than half the time exploring and digging in the island, having carried out the main portion of the work at the Luna Hacienda, Los Angeles and San Francisco. He was again in the island from February, 1877 and remained until the first of July. As before, most of the time was spent on the island, focusing in Santa Helena and Chilaite, north from Moyogalpa. Then some investigations were made in firm land near San Jorge, followed by a trip south to Nicoya in Costa Rica. (Bransford, J.F. 1881. Preliminary Note, p. 1) For his part, Professor Carl Bovallius, arrived at Ometepe from Granada, on 1882–1883 New Year's Eve and stayed in the Moyogalpa village, on the northwest tip of the island. From there he took several trips in different directions, and although his zoological research occupied a lot of his time, he had numerous opportunities to perform archaeological excavations.

For journalism, it is a branch that deals with news either sent by foreign correspondents or news agencies, or – more recently – information that is gathered or researched through distance communication technologies, such as telephone, satellite TV or the internet. Although in most of the English- speaking world this field is not usually regarded as a specific specialization for journalists, it is so in nearly all the world. Particularly in the United States, there is a blurred distinction between world news and \\"national\\" news when they include directly the national government or national institutions, such as wars in which the US are involved or summits of multilateral organizations in which the US are a member. At the birth of modern journalism, most news were foreign, as registered by the courants of the 17th century in West and Central Europe, such as the Daily Courant (England), the Nieuwe Tijudinger (Antwerp), the Relation (Strasbourg), the Avisa Relation oder Zeitung (Wolfenbüttel) and the Courante Uyt Italien, Duytsland & C. (Amsterdam). Since these papers were aimed at bankers and merchants, they brought mostly news from other markets, which usually meant other nations. In any case, it is worthy to remark that nation-states were still incipient in 17th-century Europe. From the 19th century on, with newspapers already established in Europe, the United States and a few other countries, innovations in telecommunications such as the telegraph made news from abroad easier to be spread. The first news agencies were then founded, like AFP (France), Reuters (UK), Wolff (currently DPA, Germany) and the AP (US). War journalism is one of the best known subfields of world news (although war coverage can be national for the media of belligerent countries themselves).  Foreign correspondents  There are essentially two types of reporters who do foreign reporting: the foreign correspondent (full-time reporter employed by a news source) and the special envoy (sent abroad to cover a specific subject, temporarily stationed in a location). The correspondent is a reporter based in a foreign city (often the capital of a country) covering a region, a country or sometimes even an entire continent. He or she regularly files stories to the news editor. He/she gathers materials for these stories from local officials, members of the community, and the local media, as well as from events he/she directly witnesses. Correspondents typically stay in touch with the local community and maintain contacts with other journalists and correspondents in order to identify strategic sources in the government, among diplomats, members of the military and other organizations on the ground who may provide important information. The number of foreign correspondents has dropped significantly over the past 20 years or more. Often, a media company is either uninterested or unable to afford to support a single correspondent, such as in many developing countries. In some places, they cannot obtain visas due to political constraints, or otherwise dangerous conditions prohibit a media company from stationing a reporter there. In recent years, the drop in foreign correspondents has been due to cutbacks within media companies (often, but not always, a result of economics alone). Among English language newspapers, only eight daily newspapers have full-time correspondents in more than ten foreign stations, four from the US, three from the UK and one from India: 35 – Wall Street Journal (US): Baghdad, Bangkok, Beijing, Beirut, Berlin, Brussels, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Istanbul, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, Kuala Lumpur, Lagos, London, Manila, Mexico City, Moscow, Mumbai, New Delhi, Paris, Prague, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, São Paulo, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, Taipei, Tokyo, Toronto, Zurich 24 – New York Times (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Beirut, Berlin, Cairo, Caracas, Dakar, Hong Kong, Islamabad, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Mumbai, Nairobi, New Delhi, Paris, Rome, São Paulo, Shanghai, Tokyo 19 – Financial Times (UK): Beijing, Berlin, Bombay, Brussels, Dubai, Frankfurt, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Jerusalem, Moscow, Mumbai, New Delhi, New York, Paris, Taipei, Tokyo, Shanghai, Sydney, Washington 17 – Washington Post (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Berlin, Bogotá, Cairo, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, Paris, Shanghai, Tehran, Tokyo 15 – The Guardian (UK): Accra, Bangkok, Beijing, Berlin, Brussels, Kabul, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Los Angeles, Madrid, New York, Paris, Rome, Tehran, Tokyo 13 – The Daily Telegraph (UK): Beijing, Brussels, Jerusalem, Kabul, Los Angeles, Moscow, Nairobi, New Delhi, New York, Paris, Shanghai, Sydney, Washington 13 – Los Angeles Times (US): Baghdad, Beijing, Beirut, Cairo, Islamabad, Jerusalem, Johannesburg, Kabul, London, Mexico City, Moscow, New Delhi, Seoul 12 – The Hindu (India): Addis Ababa, Beijing, Colombo, Dhaka, Dubai, Islamabad, Kathmandu, London, Moscow, Paris, Singapore, Washington When reporters working abroad have no permanent labor contract with media outlets, they are called stringers.

News agencies  A news agency is an organization of journalists established to supply news reports to news organizations: newspapers, magazines, and radio and television broadcasters. Such an agency may also be referred to as a wire service, newswire or news service. The bulk of major news agency services contains foreign news. The major news agencies generally prepare hard news stories and feature articles that can be used by other news organizations with little or no modification, and then sell them to other news organizations. They provide these articles in bulk electronically through wire services (originally they used telegraphy; today they frequently use the Internet). Corporations, individuals, analysts and intelligence agencies may also subscribe. See also *World News (disambiguation) *Global news flow  Further reading  *Clausen, L. (2003) Global news production.

The Mount Diablo Fault is the green quadrilateral near the center of the map. The Mount Diablo Thrust Fault, also known as the Mount Diablo Blind Thrust, is a thrust fault in the vicinity of Mount Diablo in Contra Costa County, California. The fault lies between the Calaveras Fault, the Greenville Fault, and the Concord Fault, all right-lateral strike-slip faults, and appears to transfer movement from the Calaveras and Greenville Faults to the Concord Fault, while continuing to uplift Mount Diablo. Tectonic forces The Pacific Plate is a major section of the Earth's crust, gradually expanding by the eruption of magma along the East Pacific Rise to the southeast. It is also being subducted far to the northwest into the Aleutian Trench under the North American Plate well north of San Francisco. In California, the plate borders the North American Plate along a transform boundary, the San Andreas Fault. The westward component of the North American Plate's motion and the irregularity of the San Andreas Fault results in some compressive force along the San Andreas and its associated faults, thus helping lift the Coast Ranges. The Mount Diablo Thrust Fault and the Great Valley Blind Thrust faults are consequences of this compression. Movement along the Mount Diablo Thrust Fault includes crustal shortening of about 2.6 mm and uplift of about 1 mm per year. Seismic parameters The Mount Diablo Thrust Fault is approximately 25 km long, and dips at an angle of 38 degrees to the northeast. The Mount Diablo Thrust Fault is capable of generating an earthquake of magnitude MW=6.7. The predicted rupture surface begins 8 km below the surface, and there is thus no surface expression of the fault, and a low likelihood of surface rupture in the event of a large earthquake on the fault. No large historic earthquakes are known to have occurred on the Mount Diablo Thrust Fault. The recurrence interval for large earthquakes along the fault is predicted to be about 400 years. Related faults Compressive stresses are produced by offset and converging slip-strike motions between the Calaveras Fault and the Clayton-Marsh Creek- Greenville Fault which manifest in the Mount Diablo Thrust Fault. Nearby cities The Mount Diablo Thrust Fault underlays several cities and unincorporated communities in Contra Costa County: Alamo, Antioch, Blackhawk, Clayton, Concord, Danville, Diablo, San Ramon, and Walnut Creek.

By 1905, he was working as a dining car waiter for the Chicago and Northern Railway when he married eighteen-year-old Adaline Harrison in Chicago; they would have two children, a son and a daughter. The marriage was not successful, and in 1918, he married native Chicagoan Cora K. Bowman (1893–1960), who survived him. Career Around 1910, Young contacted J. Hockley Smiley, managing editor of the Chicago Defender newspaper as to the possibilities of a job as a reporter. Smiley told him that there were no jobs available, but anything Young could contribute on a free-lance basis would be greatly appreciated. Young started contributing pieces to both the Chicago Defender and the Indianapolis Recorder, another black-owned newspaper and, by 1912, was taken on as a sportswriter (again free-lance) by the Chicago Defender. In 1914, Young joined the staff of the Defender and the next year became managing editor until 1918. He developed the first weekly black sports section, serving as sports editor from 1918 to 1929. Young was also the first sportswriter to regularly cover sports at historically black colleges. He also served as managing editor of the Defender from 1929 to 1934, followed by a stint as managing editor of the Kansas City Call from 1934 to 1937. Young then returned to the Defender where he continued to write until his retirement in 1949, although he continued to produce his weekly column, \\"Fay Says\\" until his death. He helped organize the Negro National League in 1920, and served as statistician until the league disbanded in 1933. He also served as an official for the Illinois Athletic Commission, serving as a timekeeper at prizefights; he was also a former secretary of the Negro American League. =Death= Young died in 1957 of an intestinal obstruction at his home in Chicago shortly after receiving news that his sister Belva Overton had died in New York. Funeral services were held at Everybody's Church, a nondenominational church that he had helped establish at 60th Street and Wabash Avenue on the south side of Chicago. His pallbearers included Jesse Owens, Ralph Metcalfe, and John Sengstacke, owner and publisher of the Defender.

The ceramics found on the site indicate that the local community must have had some contact with other Iroquoian groups living in present-day upstate New York and in the St. Lawrence Valley.

In most countries the function of educational accreditation is conducted by a government organization, such as a Ministry of Education. The United States government instead delegates the quality assurance process to private non-profit organizations.Dr. Marjorie Peace Lenn, Global Trends in Quality Assurance in Higher Education , World Education News & Reviews, v. 5, no. 2, Spring 1992, pages 1 and 21 Those organizations are formally called accreditors. In order to receive federal funding and any other type of federal recognition, all accreditors in the US must in turn be recognized by the National Advisory Committee on Institutional Quality and Integrity (NACIQI), which is an advisory body to the U.S. Secretary of Education.

Higher education accreditation in the United States has long been established as a peer review process coordinated by accreditation commissions and member institutions. The federal government began to play a limited role in higher education accreditation in 1952 with the reauthorization of the GI Bill for Korean War veterans. With the creation of the U.S. Department of Education and under the terms of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, the U.S. Secretary of Education is required by law to publish a list of nationally recognized accrediting agencies for higher education. Accreditation of primary and secondary education In the United States, there is no federal government list of recognized accreditation agencies for primary and secondary schools like there is for higher education. Public schools must adhere to criteria set by the state governments, and there is wide variation among the individual states in the requirements applied to non-public primary and secondary schools.U.S. Department of Education, State Regulation of Private Schools, June 2000.

On April 3, 1993, Rejón Aguilar entered the Mexican Army in his home state of Campeche and in 1996 was assigned to Special Forces Airmobile Group (GAFE). In 1997, he was assigned to the Mexico's Federal Attorney General's Office (PGR) in the cities of Reynosa and Miguel Alemán in Tamaulipas. In 1998 he was assigned to Saltillo, Coahuila. He deserted the army in February 1999 and in March the same year, at the invitation of Arturo Guzmán Decena, known as \\"The Z1\\" was integrated into the group of 14 former soldiers who founded Los Zetas as the armed wing of the Gulf Cartel. Rejón Aguilar oversaw the paramilitary training of new recruits and then oversaw Gulf Cartel trafficking activities in the state of Coahuila along with Alejandro Treviño Morales. Rejón Aguilar is responsible for multi-ton shipments of marijuana and multi-kilogram shipments of cocaine from Mexico to the United States. In 2004, Rejón Aguilar coordinated a failed raid on the maximum security prison 'El Altiplano', as he attempted to liberate his boss Osiel Cárdenas Guillén. According to government documents, his plan consisted of using 3 helicopters and over 50 Zeta members to liberate Cárdenas Guillén.

The church is located in the Kolusha neighbourhood, which was historically separate from the city. The church was constructed in the 10th–11th century and its frescoes are somewhat later, as the earliest layers were painted in the 11th–12th century. History The Church of St George is dated to the late 10th or early 11th century based on its architectural appearance and mural paintings, which makes it the oldest preserved church in the city. It is located in Kyustendil's southwestern part, in the former village of Kolusha, which in 1939 was merged into the city. There is a theory that Bulgarian emperor Michael Shishman was buried in the Church of St George after he perished in the Battle of Velbazhd in 1330. The battle was a Serbian victory over the Second Bulgarian Empire which paved the way for the short-lived Serbian dominance over the Balkans in the mid-14th century. However, scholar Bistra Nikolova entirely dismisses this theory as an \\"erroneous reference in [Bulgarian history] literature\\". Despite being located outside Kyustendil at the time, up until the construction of the city's main Bulgarian National Revival-style church in 1816, the Church of St George served as Kyustendil's cathedral. The church suffered some severe damage during the 19th century, the time of the Ottoman rule of Bulgaria; it was mostly destroyed, leaving only the foundations of the arches. It was reconstructed in 1878–1880, just after the establishment of the Principality of Bulgaria, with further restoration in the 2000s. Architecture and decoration The church follows the Byzantine cross-in-square design and measures . The dome is octagonal and features eight bays, four of which contain windows. There is no narthex and the cella appears square. A total of six pillars support the church from the inside. Two frame the entrance of the altar, while the remaining four stand below the dome. The church has three apses, all of a semicircular design. Materials used for the church's construction were bricks and mortar, resulting in interchanging rows of red and white. The church's interior has preserved a number of medieval frescoes, particularly in the lower reaches of the walls and pillars. The paintings in the altar were done in the 11th–12th century, while the decoration of the pillars dates to the 12th century. All inscriptions that accompany the murals are in Medieval Greek. The altar features the images of four deacons bearing a censer and monstrances as well as two bishops who could possibly be identified as Basil of Caesarea and John Chrysostom. A number of saints are also depicted inside the church, including Saint Elijah, Saints Cosmas and Damian, Saint Hermolaus, Saint Pantaleon, and four unidentified female saints. There are also later works of art in the church. It boasts icons or murals by painter Ivan Dospevski from 1881 as well as works by Mihail Belstoynev. Due to its architectural and artistic value, the Church of St George has been part of the list of Bulgaria's monuments of cultural of national importance since 1927. With the reorganization of the list in the 1960s, it was included on it both as an architectural and as an artistic monument, in 1968 and 1969 respectively. Together with the native house of Dimitar Peshev and the city art gallery, since 2010 it has been listed as number 26 among the 100 Tourist Sites of Bulgaria.

NRRI is a non-profit applied research organization with a mission to improve the economy of Minnesota by helping its industries compete in the global marketplace with improved or new products and more efficient processes. The institute helps launch promising small businesses and provides ongoing research and development assistance. Because Minnesota’s economy relies heavily on natural resource-based industries (forest products, taconite ore mining) the institute also focuses research on understanding problems, and developing tools to solve problems, that impede the environmentally sound development of the economy. Environmental program areas include: water resources, land resources, land- water interactions, and environmental chemistry. History The mid- to late-1970s and early-1980s were particularly difficult times for Minnesota's natural resource-based industries, especially for the taconite mining industry. In the face of a domestic steel crisis, shipments of iron ore from Northeastern Minnesota's eight taconite plants plummeted. Growth in the taconite industry, which had begun in the 1950s, ended and employment in this critical base industry dropped from about 16,000 to 3,000.Saint Paul Pioneer Press, by Tom Webb, Pioneer Press, St. Paul, Minn. Mar. 1, 2009. About 2,000 supply companies on the Iron Range, in Duluth and elsewhere in the state were also critically impacted. Perhaps not as dramatically as the taconite industry, the forest products industry was similarly impacted by the difficult economy. Northeastern Minnesota's logging and pulp and paper companies, in particular, were affected. At that time, the overall impact on Duluth and the Iron Range economy was verging on catastrophic.The Will and the Way, published by Manley Goldfine and Donn Larson, 2004, chapter 30 by Mike Lalich. In the face of these challenging times, civic, business, government, higher education and labor leaders began to focus on initiatives to help the economy. With a strong belief in its long-term value, U.S. Eighth District Court of Appeals Judge Gerald Heaney advocated for applied research. Then, in his 1982 gubernatorial campaign, Rudy Perpich proposed that a center be established to do research on such resources as peat, biomass, forest products, water and minerals. A Proposal to Establish A Natural Resources Research Institute at the University of Minnesota Duluth was submitted to the Minnesota State Legislature under the seal of the Regents of the University of Minnesota. The proposal affirmed the applied nature of research at the new institute, noting that its work would be separate and distinct from the University’s Minerals Resources Research Center, and recommended the SAGE building in Duluth as an adaptable site. UMD Chancellor Robert Heller worked with Governor Perpich and Judge Heaney to gain political support throughout the state.UMD Comes of Age: The First 100 Years, by Ken Moran and Neil Storch, 1996 The institute also had strong federal support which included that of Minnesota's 8th district congressman, Jim Oberstar. The proposal called for the institute to be divided into four major divisions: # Minerals # Biomass # Water # Energy The Regents proposal listed the members of the Minerals Development Commission, the Duluth High Tech Task Force and Duluth Future Task Force as endorsees of the Institute. The simple notation of first-year funding of $1,650,000 and second- year funding of $2,250,000 for the Natural Resources Research Institute in Chapter 258, page 1051 of the LAWS of MINNESOTA for 1983, marks the establishment of the Institute. Starting to operate UMD Economics Professor Dr. Jerrold Peterson was named acting coordinator of the Institute and he began to hire temporary employees to begin the work of the Institute. An Advisory Board was established, with UMD Dean of the College of Science and Engineering George (Rip) Rapp as chair. In August 1983, UMD Provost Robert Heller envisioned NRRI doing between $5 and $10 million per year in research and employing up to 150 staff members in five years. Dr. Michael Lalich, with a background in industrial research and development, was hired in 1984 as the first permanent director of the Institute and began the task of development by conducting national searches for Associate Directors for each of the four divisions. Successful candidates included: Dr. Thys Johnson, a native Duluthian and Department Head of Mining at the Colorado School of Mines; Dr. Robert Naiman, a scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and Director of a Research Station in Quebec; Dr. Eugene Shull, Associate Director of the Pennsylvania State University Combustion Laboratory; and Dr. Roy Adams, a senior research scientist at the Michigan Technological University Institute of Wood Research. Because of Minnesota's economic dependence on its natural resources, NRRI adopted the mission to foster economic development of Minnesota’s natural resources in an environmentally sensitive manner to promote private sector employment. The institute's goals are: # Assisting entrepreneurs and businesses with near term economic development. # Conducting applied research to develop products, processes and services that will be of future benefit to Minnesota's industries and resource managers. # Improving the knowledge base of Minnesota's natural resources to assist resource managers to make sound economic and environmental decisions. The NRRI is not a teaching institution, however, it fulfills its academic goals with research conducted by faculty and students at the institute and several NRRI employees hold faculty or adjunct faculty positions. NRRI assists students by providing scholarships and research assistantships. Moreover, the applied research skills learned at NRRI are invaluable in securing employment after graduation. University faculty and students interact with NRRI researchers to conduct collaborative research on a wide range of topics. Institute evolution Many of the early research directions for the institute proved to be very productive and defined NRRI’s ongoing research agenda. For example, applied research to assist the taconite industry with more efficient processing and to improve pellet quality has been a mainstay of the NRRI’s minerals research since its inception. Likewise, helping the forest products industry develop value-added products and improve silvicultural practices have been primary objectives. A resurgent interest in renewable energy production has refocused research on biomass as a source of energy. An early focus on ecological research to understand the role of humans and natural disturbances in regulating aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems also continued through the decades. In 1989, the institute was reorganized from the four original divisions to its current structure based on three research centers: The Center for Water and the Environment with biologists, ecologists and limnologists to study development impacts and provide tools and data for informed decision- making by environment managers. The Center for Applied Research and Technology Development includes elements of the original minerals and biomass divisions. The UMD Center for Economic Development is a joint program of NRRI, the School of Business and Economics, and the College of Science and Engineering. NRRI expansion In 1986, NRRI began a long-term relationship with United States Steel Corporation to manage its Coleraine, Minnesota, laboratory. The laboratory was transferred to University ownership in 1989. As part of NRRI's CARTD, the minerals lab has a three-pronged strategy for improving taconite ore products from the Iron Range: flowsheet improvement, use of by-product rock for construction and highway purposes, and the development of value-added iron nodules from the iron ore concentrate. Serving all Minnesota taconite plants, the research projects regularly reach the stage of commercial implementation after testing and demonstration in the lab's large pilot plants. The lab is currently developing a focus on extraction of non-ferrous minerals from Northeast Minnesota's Duluth Complex of copper, nickel and precious metals-bearing ore. The Coleraine lab is also delving extensively into research to characterize and identify alternative energy and fuel sources from Minnesota resources. NRRI received a National Science Foundation grant in 1990 to establish a geographic information system (GIS) laboratory within the Center for Water and the Environment. The visualization and spatial modeling techniques, along with state-of-the-art procedures developed in the GIS lab, give NRRI an advantage in the very competitive environment of procuring federally sponsored research grants and contracts. The Center's scientists are recognized around the world for their expertise in landscape ecology and the application of GIS technology for addressing natural resource questions.Johnson, L.B. and G. E. Host. 2010. Recent developments in landscape approaches for the study of aquatic ecosystems, Journal of the North American Benthological Society 29(1): 41-66 (25th Anniversary Issue). A field station was established in Ely, Minnesota, in 1999 to study microscopic algae (diatoms) as indicators of water quality and for paleolimnology research to understand environmental trends through analysis of sediment profiles. This site was closed in 2006 and incorporated into NRRI Duluth. NRRI acquired of drained peatland in Zim, Minnesota, in 1986. The Fens Research Site serves as an area for peatland restoration research and provides wetland mitigation credits for area road construction projects. The institute today After the retirement of long-time Director Michael Lalich in 2015, NRRI welcomed new Executive Director Rolf Weberg. Under his leadership, NRRI reorganized into six Research Groups that work together to inform integrated research solutions. The Research Groups are: Forestry & Land, Minerals & Metallurgy, Water, Business Support, Materials & Bioeconomy, Energy Management.

Early life Perreaux was born in the village of Almenêches, in Normandy, France, on 19 February 1816. After attending elementary school in Almenêches he showed an early interest in engineering, inventing a cane gun (a type of walking stick with a gun concealed inside) at the age of 12. Perreaux was then sent to the Minor Seminary of Sees where he formed the ideas that were later published in his first book in 1877, the two- volume Lois de l'univers principe de la création (Laws of the Universe), which is now in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris. He secured a scholarship to the School of Arts and Crafts at Châlons-sur-Marne in 1836. Inventions Perreaux's multi-charge gun Perreaux moved to Paris, where he began working on and patenting a range of inventions including a multi-chambered gun, a lock mechanism in 1841, a circular power saw in 1843 and scientific instruments such as the Perreaux Dividing Machine, invented in 1846, which could precisely calibrate the divisions on a glass thermometer using a screw driven micrometer with a chisel attachment or accurately measure the distance between two points to within a micron (one thousandth of a millimeter). Steam velocipede Perreaux experimented with a small steam engine in a bicycle frame, contributing to the invention of the first motorcycle. Perreaux patented this design under number 83,691 on 16 March 1869 (and continued to improve his invention until 1885). The design featured a brass-plated single-cylinder steam engine with an alcohol fuel burner under the saddle of a French-made Michaux velocipede bicycle. Drive was by twin belts, and it was capable of about . The original machine is on display in the Musée de l’Île-de-France at the Château de Sceaux. Military tent One of Perreaux's last inventions was in 1879 when he submitted Patent No. 128,656 for a \\"system of military tent poles without external cables and without pickets\\". As well as being much more rigid than conventional tents, Perreaux's design claimed to be simpler, lighter and therefore transportable for military use. He also proposed that several of his square-tent designs could be erected together to form a gallery.

The B'nai Jeshurun congregation was established in 1858, making it the fourth oldest Jewish congregation in Alabama. It was active throughout the latter half of the 19th century and most of the 20th. The original temple was built in 1893. It was torn down after a new smaller building was built inside the older structure in 1958. The temple was inactive by the 1980s, with the title being transferred to a local church in 1989. History The first Jewish settler to arrive in Demopolis was Isaac Marx in circa 1844. Originally from Bavaria, the businessman established what eventually became the Marx Banking Company. He encouraged other Jewish families living further east to relocate to the city. By the 1850s, the Jewish community ran many of the commercial enterprises in the city. In 1858 they formed the B'nai Jeshurun (children of righteousness) congregation. Initially the congregation met in homes and businesses. The congregation bought land for a cemetery on East Jefferson Street in 1878. By the 1890s the congregation was able to build a temple on the corner of Main and Monroe streets. It was dedicated on November 30, 1893 with Rabbi Edward Levy of Selma officiating. Isaac Marx, the oldest congregant in 1893, lit the eternal light. The new wooden-frame temple was built in a Moorish Revival style with a domed roof. The congregation never had its own rabbi; the services were led by lay readers instead. The lay readers included Jacob Bley, George Bley, Jerome Levy, and Louis Mayer. The Jewish community played an active role in civic affairs, with three congregation members serving as mayors of Demopolis: Morris Ely (1903-1906), Isidore Bley (1910), and Bony Fields (1949-1952). The progenitor of the Rosenbush family, Julius Rosenbush, arrived in the city in 1894. He founded the Rosenbush Furniture Company, a locally prominent business for 108 years, until its closing in 2002. The congregation joined the Union of American Hebrew Congregations in 1907. By 1905, Demopolis had a population of around 124 Jews. In 1929 it had increased to 150. By the late 1930s, as was happening in other small Southern towns, the Jewish population had started an exodus to larger cities, with only 90 people remaining. A new, smaller masonry temple was built inside the shell of the 1893 building in 1958. The old temple was demolished after the new one was completed. The Jewish population continued to decline, with only a handful of people remaining by the late 1980s. The deed to Temple B’nai Jeshurun was signed over to Trinity Episcopal Church for $10 in 1989. The church continues to care for the property in 2010, having donated the sanctuary artifacts to the Museum of the Southern Jewish Experience in 2007. As of 2010, the last remaining former B’nai Jeshurun congregant was Bert Rosenbush, Jr, grandson of Julius Rosenbush. Bert Rosenbush, Jr. died on January 10, 2019 at the age of 89.

He was born in Leipzig, Germany, and died in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Life Friedrich Wilhelm Heine spent the first forty years of his life in Germany. At the age of fourteen he was a copper and steel engraver's apprentice and later attended the Leipzig and Weimar Academies in Germany, working as a book illustrator and designer from 1861 to 1866. He was a war correspondent and sketch artist with the Prussian Army in Austria and a field artist in the Franco-Prussian War of 1871. Because of his reputation as a war artist in Germany, Heine was invited to come to Milwaukee in 1885 to supervise the compositions of the paintings of the American Panorama Company at 628 Wells Street. He was one of about twenty German artists commissioned to paint Storming of Missionary Ridge / Battle of Chattanooga and Battle of Atlanta. \\"Altmarkt Dresden\\" in the Museum of Wisconsin Art Collection In 1887, Heine and August Lohr purchased the Wells Street studio from the American Panorama Company and formed the Lohr and Heine panorama company. Subsequently, they created the panorama Jerusalem on the Day of the Crucifixion. In 1888 Lohr, Heine, Imre Boos and Paul Zabel formed the Milwaukee Panorama Co and produced Christ’s Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem. At least eight panorama paintings were produced at the Wells street studio. In 1888, he opened the Heine School of Art, a watercolor and etching studio, which featured costumed models for the students. The school was located in Milwaukee's Iron Block Building, a favorite spot of local artists. After the Spanish–American War (1895–1898) Heine, Lohr, Peter, Rohrbeck and Biberstein went to San Francisco in 1898 to paint the panorama Battle of Manila Bay. In 1900, he and another artist, George Peter, went to Jerusalem to sketch church interiors for a series of murals to be shown at the 1904 World’s Fair, St. Louis Exposition. Balder und Nanna by F. W. Heine Throughout 1908 Heine traveled to Door County, Wisconsin and Muir Woods California, and many watercolor paintings were the result of these trips. Heine was one of the founding members of the Society of Milwaukee Artists, now known as Wisconsin Painters and Sculptors. His early works demonstrated a well-defined brush stroke and a meticulous concern for detail. His later works involved a broader and less defined form and tonalist qualities.

The goods would be taken to Blake Hall Station (1.6 miles away) and then taken to the city. The agricultural history and nature of the hamlet made it ideal for this purpose.  Geography  Some farmlands near Coleman's Farm in Clatterford End. The land in the hamlet varies in elevation from approximately 74 ft. above sea-level to 81 ft. The River Roding runs near and forms the eastern and southern boundaries of the parish. A stream flows east across the north of the parish to join the Roding at Wash Bridge. Several smaller streams join the river farther south. Clatterford End is surrounded by large open fields and arable farms.

The label played a major role in developing a funk-oriented blend of disco, R&B; and soul music during the 1970s and 1980s. As a concert promoter, Griffey arranged bookings for artists such as James Brown, Aretha Franklin, Jon Gibson, Stevie Wonder, and the Jacksons. Life and career Richard Gilbert Griffey was born on November 16, 1938. He was raised by his mother, Juanita Hines, and stepfather in the housing projects of Nashville, Tennessee, where he was a drummer in local clubs in his teens. After briefly attending Tennessee State University, he enlisted in the United States Navy at age 17.

Eventually he branched into concert promotion, earning the moniker \\"Kingpin of Soul Promoters\\". Griffey toured with the girl group Honey Cone and handled their finances. He was engaged to Carolyn Willis of the group in 1971. Griffey worked as talent coordinator on Soul Train, the musical variety show created by Don Cornelius, and together they established Soul Train Records in 1975. Griffey formed his own label, SOLAR Records (an acronym for Sound of Los Angeles Records) in 1977.

Gibson's debut came as a guest vocalist for three songs on Bill Wolfer's album, Wolf. It was during the process of making that album that Gibson met his musical idol, Stevie Wonder, and worked with a crew of other musicians, including Michael Jackson. Wolfer returned the favor the next year by producing Gibson's debut album, Standing on the One (1983).

Central LA Pioneer,\\" North Louisiana History, Vol. 2, No. 3 (Spring 1971), pp. 85-94 Early life The son of Robert Russ and the former Sarah Gillam Hodges, Russ was born in Holmes Valley in Washington County, in the Florida Panhandle. He attended school in Maury County (Columbia), Tennessee. He migrated with his mother and stepfather, Sion D. Smith, to Henry County (Dothan), Alabama, Hinds County (Jackson), Mississippi, and in 1852 to Jackson Parish (Jonesboro) south of Ruston. In 1855, he married the former Mary Elizabeth Randle, and the couple had thirteen children. Landowner In 1873, Russ purchased land in Lincoln Parish, which was established after the American Civil War. With the news that the Vicksburg, Shreveport & Pacific Railroad would be built in the vicinity, Russ was persuaded to donate more than 600 acres of his land for a town to be built around the depot. \\"Russ Town\\" opened in 1883, with lots selling for $375 each. So many people flocked to the new town that a year later, in 1884, it became the site for the Lincoln Parish seat of government. Russ was active in the Democratic Party and served as sheriff of Lincoln Parish from 1877-1880. He was a trustee of Ruston College, which in 1894 became the future Louisiana Tech University. He was a lay organizer of First Baptist Church in downtown Ruston. He is interred at the historic Greenwood Cemetery in Ruston.A Dictionary of Louisiana Biography (la.history.org) uses information for its article on Robert Russ from William Wayne \\"Bill\\" Wilson, \\"Robert E. Russ: A Study of His Influence on North-Central Louisiana as Reflected in His Writings\\" (Master of Arts thesis, Louisiana Tech University, 1969).

Buildings and location Whitmore station was located off Whitmore road in Baldwins Gate Village. The site of the station can still be seen when the tracks part, showing a grassy area were platforms could have been. A more likely location of the platform is where a siding of road comes down near the track, this could have led to a platform. One station building can still be seen: a building, next to a bridge spanning the track, is in the definite style of ticket office. This means that passengers could buy tickets, then wait or read information before heading down a side road to the platform. =Impact of the station= The station itself was one of the key factors affecting how Baldwins Gate village was laid out. Only two shops are in the village, and they are both situated next to the line. The line led to land being sold on each side, so the village expanded, and its appearance today is because of the impact of the railway and Station. Closure  However Whitmore station slowly began to get less and less business and in 1952 the station was closed.

WRDD operated at the federally assigned frequency of 1580 kHz, with a maximum power of 1,000 watts. The station ceased operations in 2010, and as of January 2012, has had its license cancelled. History =Beginnings as WEND= WRDD first went on the air in 1961 under the ownership of the Allegheny Mountain Network under the call letters WEND, and operated from studios and offices along North Center Avenue in downtown Ebensburg. For most of its early years, the station operated as the simulcast sister station of WEND-FM (now WRKW). =First sale= In April 1972, WEND was spun off to new owners Francis Krug and Robert Civis, the former being WEND's general manager under previous ownership. However, the station was sold again on January 1, 1977, to Great American Wireless Signal Company, Incorporated. On August 10, 1982, WEND was spun off to Camcom Corporation, a company owned by Pittsburgh-based broadcasting engineer Roy J. Humphrey, and adopted the call letters WAJE. The station also moved from its longtime location on Center Avenue into the Cambria Savings Building, known today as the First United Federal Building. In August 1985, the station was bought out of bankruptcy by Pittsburgh broadcast engineer Phillip Lenz who formed \\"Ebensburg Broadcast Group\\", and given the call letters WEBG. The station's studio and offices were moved to the Ebensburg Mini Mall. By 1990, the station was sold another owner, Eagle Radio, and became WRDD. Headed by J. Richard Lee and his daughter Jane, Eagle operated WRDD (and co-owned WNCC in Barnesboro) as simulcast outlets of WCRO, as that was the only station of the three left that had an existing studio building. The three stations identified themselves as \\"Eagle Radio\\" and broadcast a series of time-brokered religious programs throughout the day. In 1996, Eagle Broadcasting put all three stations up for sale, after a series of competing religious-formatted FM stations and translators signed on the air. Both WRDD and WNCC were sold to Vernal Enterprises that year, with WCRO being spun off to the Greater Johnstown School District. The company, headed by Indiana County businessman Larry Schrecongost, moved the operations of WNCC back to Barnesboro, where it was joined by WRDD, and set up operations in a new studio. Both WNCC and WRDD simulcast a full-service format of oldies, news, and local sports, which Schrecongost had demonstrated success with on a station that he had acquired four years earlier, AM 1380 WTYM in Kittanning. Both WNCC and WRDD were joined four years later by a co-owned FM sister station. Vernal Enterprises was able to secure another construction permit after the window to put WRHB-FM had already come and long gone. Taking call letters from a former oldies station licensed to suburban Altoona, the station signed on as WHPA-FM, billing themselves as broadcasting from the \\"Heart of PennsylvaniA\\". WHPA did not simulcast its two AM stations, but rather focused on a music-intensive Classic Hits blend of both oldies and classic rock. In 2004 WRDD split from its simulcast with WNCC and changed their format to business news/talk. On September 1, 2010 WRDD went silent. WRDD today WRDD was listed with the FCC as being silent on Friday, September 3, 2010, with reasons being technical in nature. The tower of WRDD was found in need of repair and was slated to be dismantled due to safety issues. The tower was slated to be demolished around Thanksgiving, with a replacement tower to be purchased with a return to the air in the Summer of 2011. However, the FCC notified Vernal Enterprises in January 2012 that its license was being canceled after the station failed to return to the air by its ordered deadline of October 16, 2011, and no subsequent paperwork was filed by Vernal seeking an extension to its Special Temporary Authority application to remain silent. The tower along Tanner Road in Cambria Township was later demolished.

It has been reported from Curaçao, but that is probably a case of mistaken identity. It is absent from the Gulf of Mexico and from the coasts of Florida and Brazil. Its depth range is down to about and it tends not to be found on patch reefs, preferring limestone slopes. Ecology Acanthemblemaria maria lives in a burrow, a hollow in the rock, a crevice, a hole in a colonial coral, an empty mollusc shell or an empty serpulid worm tube. It is often associated with small brain corals, sea fans, sea whips and sea urchins. It is an ambush predator, remaining concealed in its lair with only its head projecting, until a copepod or other small invertebrate prey approaches. At this stage, it darts out, grabs the prey and retreats into its home. The eggs are laid in the lair and are tended by the male, the female taking no part in their care. Status This is a common species with a wide distribution. No particular threats have been identified and there are no special conservation measures in place. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the fish's conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\".

History The initial focus of education accreditation was on secondary schools. For example, the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools was organized in 1895 with the objective of \\"the establishment of close relations between the colleges and secondary schools.\\"History of the North Central Association Better articulation between the two levels of education was a particular focus. In pursuit of that objective, the association undertook a thorough examination of education quality at both the secondary and college level. That examination process led to the establishment of an accreditation process for secondary schools. Accreditation of colleges and universities followed later. The North Central Commission carried out the functions of post-secondary accreditation and accreditation of pre-college education through a unified organization until 2000, when its Commission on Schools (later NAC CASI and now merged into AdvancED) and its Commission on Institutions of Higher Education (now the Higher Learning Commission) were formed as independent corporations that began independent operation on January 1, 2001.SEPARATE INCORPORATION OF THE COMMISSIONS OF THE NORTH CENTRAL ASSOCIATION, NCA Higher Learning Commission website; archived October 15, 2001 and Initiating the New Corporation: The Higher Learning Commission, NCA Exchanges Newsletter, November 2000; archived June 12, 2004 Federal context In the United States, educational accreditation has long been established as a peer review process coordinated by accreditation commissions and member institutions. With the creation of the U.S. Department of Education and under the terms of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended, the U.S. Secretary of Education is required by law to publish a list of nationally recognized accrediting agencies for higher education. There is no similar federal government list of recognised accreditation agencies for primary and secondary schools. Public schools must adhere to criteria set by the state governments, and there is wide variation among the individual states in the requirements applied to non-public primary and secondary schools.State Regulation of Private Schools , June 2000. U.S. Department of Education. There are six regional accreditors in the United States that have historically accredited (and therefore include among their membership) most elementary schools, junior high schools, middle schools, high schools, as well as nearly all public and private institutions of higher education that are academic in nature. Some states, including Missouri and North Dakota, accredit public secondary schools within their borders.

Whitaker asks why the number of Americans who receive government disability for mental illness approximately doubled since 1987.Whitaker, p. 7 In the book, Whitaker tries to answer that question and examines the long-term outcomes for the mentally ill in the U.S. Synopsis =Magic bullets= SSDI and SSI for mental disability in 1987 (blue) when Eli Lilly and Company introduced the antidepressive drug Prozac, compared to 2003 (red). Whitaker begins by reviewing the discovery of antipsychotics, benzodiazepines and antidepressants. These were discovered as side effects during research for antihistamines (specifically promethazine), gram negative antibiotics (specifically mephenesin) and the anti-tuberculosis agents isoniazid and iproniazid respectively. The psychiatric mechanisms of action of these drugs were not known at the time and these were initially called major tranquilizers (now typical antipsychotics) due to their induction of \\"euphoric quietude\\"; minor tranquilizers (now benzodiazepines) and psychic energizers (now antidepressants) due to patients \\"dancing in the wards.\\" These compounds were developed during a period of growth for the pharmaceutical industry bolstered by the 1951 Durham-Humphrey Amendment, giving physicians monopolistic prescribing rights thus aligning the interests of physicians and pharmaceutical companies. This also followed the industry's development of \\"magic bullets\\" that treat people with, for example, diabetes, which according to Whitaker provided an analogy to sell the idea of these drugs to the public. It was not until many years later, after the mechanisms of these drugs were determined, that the serotonergic hypothesis of depression and dopaminergic hypothesis of schizophrenia were developed to fall in line with the drug's mechanisms. According to Whitaker's analysis of the primary literature, lower levels of serotonin and higher levels of dopamine \\"have proved to be true in patients WITH prior exposure to antidepressants or antipsychotics (ie as homeostatic mechanisms) but NOT in patients without prior exposure.\\" Whitaker further criticizes the magic bullet theory by attacking the historical notion that the \\"invention of the antipsychotic Thorazine\\" emptied the asylums. His case begins by showing that during the late 1940s and 1950s ~75% of cases admitted for first episode schizophrenia recovered to the community by approximately 3 years (Thorazine was not released until 1955). He then notes that the arrival of Thorazine did not improve discharge rates in the 1950s for people newly diagnosed with schizophrenia. In fact, based on the only large scale first episode schizophrenia study of this era, 88% of those who were not treated were discharged within eighteen months compared to 74% of neuroleptic treated. This is additionally evidenced by the fact that when Thorazine was introduced in 1955 there were 267 thousand schizophrenia patients in state and county mental hospitals, and eight years later, there were 253 thousand, thus indicating that the advent of neuroleptics barely budged the number of hospitalized patients. What he argues actually cleared the asylums was the beginning of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. These programs provided federal subsidies for nursing home care but no such subsidy for care in state mental hospitals, and so the states, seeking to save money, began shipping their chronic patients to nursing homes. =Psychiatric drugs= Whitaker acknowledges that psychiatric medications do sometimes work but believes that they must be used in a \\"selective, cautious manner. It should be understood that they’re not fixing any chemical imbalances. And honestly, they should be used on a short-term basis.\\" Whitaker traces the effects of what looks like an iatrogenic epidemic:Whitaker, p. 208 the drugs that patients receive can perturb their normal brain function.Whitaker, p. 210A symbolic graphic of the brains dopamine function before and after antipsychotics. Whitaker suggests that the \\"wonder drug\\" glow around the second generation psychotropics has long since disappeared. He views the \\"hyping\\" of the top-selling atypical antipsychotics as \\"one of the more embarrassing episodes in psychiatry's history, as one government study after another failed to find that they were any better than the first-generation anti-psychotics.\\" One of Whitaker's solutions is the style of care documented by professor Jaakko Seikkula at Keropudas Hospital in Tornio in Lapland where drugs are given to patients only on a limited basis, with good outcomes. According to Whitaker, the district has the lowest per capita spending on mental health of all health districts in Finland.Whitaker, p. 343 He also advocates that those with depression engage in exercise. =Children= Whitaker sees that children are vulnerable to being prescribed a lifetime of drugs. As the author says, a psychiatrist and parents may give a child a \\"cocktail\\" to force him or her to behave. Then when this child reaches the age of eighteen, Whitaker says the child often becomes a disabled adult.Whitaker, chapters 11 and 12 Review of data and statistics Whitaker spent a year and a half researching for this book, and maintains a website listing some relevant studies. Reception and media coverage Whitaker did interviews with Salon and The Boston Globe during the release of this book. He also did a book tour, and he spoke for an hour and a half on C-SPAN where there is an archived video. Still, in his book he says that this story was never told in mainstream newspapers.Whitaker, pp. 309–310 For example, Whitaker says a study of long-term outcomes for people with schizophrenia done by Martin Harrow in 2007 (which Whitaker thinks is the best work ever done on the subject in the U.S) was never in a National Institute of Mental Health press release and thus never reached reporters at U.S. newspapers.Whitaker, p. 310 A review by sleep researcher Dennis Rosen for The Boston Globe concludes that \\"although extensively researched and drawing upon hundreds of sources, the gaps in his theory remain too large for him to succeed in making a convincing argument\\", and compares Whitaker to Thabo Mbeki and AIDS denialism. Other reviews were in New Scientist, The Record, Time magazine, and Salon. Over a year after the book was published, Marcia Angell, former editor of The New England Journal of Medicine, published a two-part review of Whitaker's and other books in The New York Review of Books and which received a great deal of publicity. Daniel Carlat criticized the book as \\"confusing causation with correlation\\". While Whitaker notes that the number of persons on federal disability in the U.S. has risen in synchrony with increased psychiatric drug use, Carlat argues that other factors have caused the rise in disability. Among these is a larger number of disorders recognized by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual; that the greater number of treatments available incentivizes physicians to look for symptoms of disease; and that changes in federal disability regulations have encouraged more people to seek disability benefits. Whitaker responded to this on his website, saying that if the drugs actually worked, the disability numbers should go down regardless. |url=https://www.madinamerica.com/2011/11/%EF%BB%BFanswering- carlat/} Whitaker, who had been an invited keynote speaker, was \\"uninvited\\" from the Alternatives 2010 conference. The event has been funded since 1985 by the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. MindFreedom International started an online campaign. Whitaker was reinvited and delivered his address. However a psychiatrist, Dr. Mark Ragins, was added to the program to rebut Whitaker. Whitaker presented his views at a psychiatric Grand Rounds at Massachusetts General Hospital on January 13, 2011, where his data and approach were critiqued by psychiatrist Andrew Nierenberg. Additional criticism has come from psychiatrist and author Daniel Carlat. Whitaker has responded to critics on his website. In April 2011, Investigative Reporters and Editors (IRE) announced that the book had won its award as the best investigative journalism book of 2010 stating, \\"this book provides an in-depth exploration of medical studies and science and intersperses compelling anecdotal examples. In the end, Whitaker rejects the conventional wisdom of treatment of mental illness with drugs.\\" See also * Mad in America (2002) by Robert Whitaker * Side Effects (2008) by Alison Bass * Rethinking Madness book by Paris Williams * Evidence-based medicine References Bibliography * External links * Book home page at author's site, Mad in America * Author keynote at Alternatives 2010 (funded by the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services) ** Part One ** Part Two ** Part Three ** Part Four 2010 non-fiction books American history books Books about the politics of science Books about mental health History books about medicine ","title":"Anatomy of an Epidemic"},{"id":"29072361","text":"Rick Leach and Andrei Olhovskiy were the defending champions, but Olhovskiy did not participate this year.

Life Dhimitër S. Shuteriqi was born in Elbasan in a patriotic and intellectual family. His father was Simon Shuteriqi, participant in the Literary Congress of Monastir (1908) and Congress of Elbasan (1909), as well as one of the founders of the Shkolla Normale e Elbasanit. Shuteriqi attended the secondary school in Korça. He studied at the University of Grenoble and Lyon in France and taught school in Elbasan in 1942–1943. Shuteriqi began writing in the 1930s and was to become an influential literary historian during the socialist period. He was a member of parliament for many years, president of the Albanian League of Writers and Artists (ALWA) from 1950 to 1973, and a member of the Academy of Sciences from 1973. As chairman of the ALWA, he participated in the Albanian Congress of Orthography of 1972 and was one of the signatories. Dhimitër Shuteriqi is remembered for his research in the fields of literature, history, and folklore, in particular for his standard histories and anthologies of Albanian literature. Among his many works are Shkrimet shqipe në vitet 1332–1850 (Albanian Writing in the Years 1332–1850), Tirana 1976, Autorë dhe tekste (Authors and Texts), Tirana 1977, and Historia e letërsisë shqiptare (History of Albanian Literature), Tirana 1983. Shuteriqi was also author of prose and poetry. His first poetry was named Kosova and was published in the Kosova newspaper of Albanian community of Constanța, Romania, in 1933. He was inspired by Romanticism (Victor Hugo, Lamartine, De Vigny, Byron, etc.) until 1943 when he switched to Realism, and later Socialist Realism. His two-volume Çlirimtarët (The Liberators), Tirana 1952 and 1955, the first post-World War II Albanian novel, painted a picture not only of the squalor and sufferings of the peasants before the \\"liberation\\" but also of the rise of class consciousness among them. It helped set the rather sluggish pace of socialist realism in the 1950s.
