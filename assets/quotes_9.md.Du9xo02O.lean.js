The term Indrajala was used instead of maya in the ancient days. Since Indra represents God and God's creation of this universe can be considered a magical act, this whole world is Indrajala (a net of Indra), an illusion. In a similar fashion, the human magician applies the magic called Indrajala in imitation of his divine forerunners, and thus spreads his net of maya over those he chooses as the object of his manipulations. He creates something before the eyes of the spectators that does not really exist, or only exist in the spectators‚Äô minds as a result of his skill. If one confines Indrajala to its stricter sense of illusory appearances created for the public, it is understandable that this activity was apt to become an image for the great illusion to hold ignorant mankind in its grasp. According to the Advaita philosophers there is no difference between avidya (ignorance) and moha (\\"delusion\\") as factors that lead to human bondage. Magic and Religion sometimes go together. The most important source for the knowledge of Vedic magic is Atharvaveda. Those mantras of the Vedas that are meant for shanti, for allaying fears and evils, for greater welfare and for extension of life, etc., are called pratyangiramantrah or atharvanah, but those meant for harming others, i.e., abhichara, are called angiramantrah or angirasah. Hindu belief contends that the fundamental power of Brahman‚Äîwhich penetrates existence and is neutral by itself‚Äîcan be used by qualified specialists for good or evil ends. To scare the enemy is the aim of Indrajala. Kamandaka and the Puranas include Upeksha, Maya and Indrajala as sub-methods of diplomacy. Indrajala is the use of stratagems for victory over the enemy and according to Kautilya it comes under Bheda.

The Hadley Hills surround the village of Hadley; The highest points and most prominent outcroppings are: Pinnacle Point, at 1,262 feet (385 m), Kerr (Cemetery) Hill, at 1,258 feet (383 m), both located in Hadley Township, Mt. Christie, at 1,251 feet (381 m), in Metamora Township, and a point near Mayville, reaching up to 1,050 feet (320 m) above sea level. Located predominately in Hadley Township, in Lapeer County, the Hadley Hills are actually an extension of a much larger collection of hills which are attributed to other geologically related moraines, that run in a southwesterly direction from northern Lapeer County and stretch as far south as northern Indiana, and Ohio. The southern portion of this moraine system is known collectively as the Irish Hills. This glacial ridge, and plateau system, creates some of the highest points in southern lower Michigan, is dotted by numerous lakes, and provides the Detroit Metropolitan Area with many of its recreational areas, parks, ski resorts, and beaches, including the Ortonville Recreation Area, Metamora-Hadley Recreation Area, the Holly State Recreation Area, and the Mt. Holly, and Pine Knob ski areas. The Hadley Hills, specifically however, were created in a slightly different geologic process from the rest of the moraines in this system. The Hadley Hills themselves are instead considered to be a veiki moraine, which is produced by the melting of leftover (or \\"dead\\") glacial ice, which created a plateau of glacial debris, instead of the typical glacial ridges associated with the rest of the system which were produced by the advancement and retreat of the glaciers. This accounts for the numerous basin lakes, sinkholes, and the unusual shape, and rugged terrain associated with these hills in particular. The hills provide habitat for wildlife, and are popular with hunters\\"Hadley Hills Coon Hunters Association tradition continues\\". The Citizen and fishermen.

The cartoon takes place during the space race of the time. The cartoon was directed by Paul J. Smith and was one of eight Woody Woodpecker cartoons released to theaters in 1966. Grace Stafford provided Woody's voice while Dallas McKennon guessed starred as a military colonel. Summary The cartoon begins in Woody's tree, which he has \\"just about all pecked to pieces\\". Woody decides that it is time to move out, and comes across a launchpad with a rocket on it destined for the Moon. Mistaking it for a high- rise apartment building, Woody enters the rocket and starts to make himself at home. One of the things he discovers is the astronaut's food, which is concealed in tubes. Meanwhile, in the rocket's control room, the colonel in charge of the launch discovers Woody in the rocket and heads up to the top to try to eject him. Mistaking him for the landlord Woody offers him some ice water, but the colonel orders him to leave. Woody does, but not before hitting the colonel in the face with a pie and being forcefully thrown out of the rocket. The colonel then heads back into the control room to prepare for blast off, while Woody immediately sneaks back into the rocket. Suddenly realizing where he is once the colonel starts counting down, Woody tears apart some of the rocket's electronics to stop the blast off, once again bringing the colonel outside to try and stop him. Woody first throws a motor at the colonel, then cuts the elevator so it drops on him. As the colonel climbs up to the top of the rocket (his only means of getting up there now), Woody climbs down, then goes into the control room and launches the rocket. Only the top of the rocket, where Woody had been making home, blasts off and crashes down to the ground with the colonel in it. Looking at the wreck, the colonel shrugs and says \\"well, back to the drawing board\\". The colonel tries a second time to launch the rocket after a while, but Woody again interrupts. This time, he is disguised as the rocket's head electrician, needing to make adjustments. The adjustments cause the colonel's chair to launch into the air instead of the rocket, and since the chair is not intended for flight he does not get very far before crashing back to earth. He lands on the floor of the control room and again decides it is time to go \\"back to the drawing board\\". The second time, Woody interrupts dressed as an astronaut and dispatches the colonel to the rocket, claiming someone wants to talk to him in there. Woody then launches the rocket again, but this time it only gets a few feet off the ground before crashing through the launchpad. The colonel makes one more attempt to launch, but Woody again interrupts dressed as the head electrician to make adjustments. This time, the entire building housing the control room lifts off the ground as the colonel protests in frustration. Woody then decides it is time for lunch and finds a food tube marked \\"instant banquet\\", which when squeezed creates a banquet table. He then squeezes a tube labeled \\"table companion\\" and a woman comes out. The cartoon ends with Woody's laugh. References *The Walter Lantz Cartune Encyclopedia - 1966.

History =Early years= Gatsinzi was born in 1987 to father Etienne Rukwavu and mother Peruth Kantetere. He was the first of five children born into the devout Christian family. His mother and sister both were gospel singers and Gatsinzi would commonly join them in singing gospel and praying before sleeping. He enjoyed music and poetry writing from an early age, and after attending a Lucky Dube concert at Amahoro Stadium in Kigali he was inspired to combine these talents to begin performing as a hip-hop artist and actually he is Rwanda's best hip hop artist based on what he has done over the years. =Musical career= Gatsinzi formed his first group, UTP, in 2006. Afterward he formed a band called Soldier with two other teenage boys, performing as the group's lead singer before embarking on an independent career and releasing his first solo album on 28 December 2009. In late 2018, Gatsinzi released \\"Ikinyarwanda\\" which featured Bruce Melody Diverse artists inspired Riderman's style and musical taste.

Other activities Gatsinzi has been a prominent advocate for development of the music industry and the professionalization of musicianship as a profession in Rwanda. Remarking the lack of sponsorship to support new musical acts, in 2012 he offered free use of his recording studio to ten underground hip-hop acts and invited them to perform with him on his tour of Rwanda that year. Alongside his musical career, Gatsinzi is also working toward completion of a degree in Tourism Management at Rwanda Tourism University College.

It stars the principal cast of the show, Kevin Connolly, Adrian Grenier, Kevin Dillon, Jerry Ferrara and Jeremy Piven, and follows actor Vincent Chase who goes overbudget on his directorial debut and must ask newly- appointed studio head Ari Gold for more money. After it was confirmed the series would end in 2011 with season 8, Ellin and the cast expressed their interest in doing a feature film. After script and production issues, the project was officially announced in 2013, and filming began around Los Angeles in February 2014. Entourage was theatrically released in the United States on June 3, 2015. It received generally negative reviews from critics and grossed $49 million worldwide.  Plot  Vincent Chase, who separated from his wife after nine days of marriage, wants to do something new in his career. He calls his former agent-turned-studio head Ari Gold, who offers Vince a leading role in his first studio production. Vince says he will only star in it if he directs. Eight months later, Hyde, the directorial debut by Vince, is in the middle of post-production and is over budget by $15 million. Needing more money, Vince asks Ari if they can get an additional $10 million to complete the movie. Reluctant, but wanting to please him, Ari flies to Texas to meet the co-financiers of the movie, Larsen McCredle and his son Travis, to get them to give the money. Hesitant, Larsen sends Travis with Ari back to Los Angeles to see a cut of the film at Vince's private screening. Vince has second thoughts on the rough cut and cancels the screening out of fear no one will enjoy it. He later gives Ari and Travis a copy of the movie for their viewing. Ari and Travis enjoy the movie but Travis requests that Ari cut the scenes with Vince's brother, Johnny \\"Drama\\" Chase, out of the movie or he will not give the film the extra money. With Ari giving him no answer, Travis puts the post-production on hold. Vince and Eric \\"E\\" Murphy visit Travis to come up with a solution, but this results in Travis saying he did not like Vince's performance either and wants the entire movie to be redone with a new lead and director. In addition, studio CEO John Ellis removes Ari from the production. The boys soon realize the reason Travis is angry over the movie is because Vince is spending time with Emily Ratajkowski, with whom Travis is infatuated. Learning of this, Ari interrupts Ellis in a boardroom meeting with Larsen and Travis with this information. Surprised, Larsen says he will stay behind the movie but mandates the condition that Ari is no longer working for the studio because, although he agreed his son was being juvenile, Ari had disrespected his son. During this time, the boys are in the hospital as E's ex-fianc√©e Sloan goes into labor. Sloan gives birth to a girl, Ryan Murphy, and the boys celebrate. Ari arrives at the hospital and also announces that he resigned and invested his severance to complete the movie. Hyde becomes a box office hit, grossing over $450 million worldwide. At the Golden Globe Awards, Drama ends up winning the award for Best Supporting Actor. Stunned, Drama goes to accept the award and is silent for a moment before yelling his trademark Viking Quest phrase, \\"VICTORY!!!\\" In a mid-credits scene, Ari's former assistant Lloyd has his wedding and Ari gives him away. When the group gets together for a picture, Billy Walsh suggests that they should make a film (or TV show) about the lives of Vince and the gang.

In September 2011, Adrian Grenier confirmed that there would be a film, and a script just needed to be written first. The series' executive producer Mark Wahlberg also confirmed that a film is in the works and said, \\"I will do everything to get this film made\\". The film was officially green-lit in 2013, with Ellin directing and Warner Bros. distributing. However, by September 2013, amid reports that there had been significant delays in production and contract issues with the film's cast, Ellin stated the film was \\"less and less likely every day.\\" However, by October 2013, the cast had reached a deal, allowing the film to move forward. Principal photography officially began on February 19, 2014, in Los Angeles, with additional filming in Miami. While filming in California, the production spent $39 million and received the California Film & Television Tax Credit. Filming was disrupted when Kevin Connolly broke his leg filming a football scene with Russell Wilson, which resulted in a number of script changes to accommodate it. In March 2014, it was reported that adult film actresses Lilly Banks, Maia Davis, Spencer Scott, and Anna Morna had shot scenes for the film. Several cast members shot a scene for the film on the red carpet at the 72nd Golden Globe Awards on January 11, 2015. Release The film was previously set for a June 12, 2015 release, but on October 24, 2014, Warner Bros. moved it up a week to June 5, 2015. In April 2015, the release date was moved up two days to June 3, 2015. Reception =Box office= Entourage grossed $32.4 million in the United States and Canada and $16.9 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $49.3 million, against a production budget of $39 million. In North America, the film grossed $2 million from its early Tuesday night showings and $5.4 million on its opening day (Wednesday), including Tuesday previews, from 3,058 theaters. The film earned $2 million and $3.7 million on Thursday and Friday, respectively. For its opening weekend (Friday‚ÄìSunday), it grossed $10.4 million (a five-day total of $17.8 million), finishing at fourth place at the box office behind Spy ($29.1 million), San Andreas ($25.8 million), and Insidious: Chapter 3 ($22.7 million). Given the film's $39 million production budget, as well as an additional $40.7 million spent on advertisement, Warner Bros. and HBO Films were hoping for an opening of at least $20 million, and the film was considered a financial disappointment. The film dropped 59% in its sophomore weekend to $4.2 million, finishing 5th. In Australia, the film opened at number one, earning $2.6 million. =Critical reception= On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 33% based on 201 reviews, with an average rating of 4.7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \\"Entourage retains many elements of the HBO series, but feels less like a film than a particularly shallow, cameo-studded extended episode of the show.\\" On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating, the film has a weighted average score of 38 out of 100, based on 40 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". In CinemaScore polls, audiences gave the film an average grade of \\"A‚àí\\" on an A+ to F scale. Brian Tallerico, writing for RogerEbert.com, awarded the film one and a half out of four stars, saying \\"Instead of challenging his characters or giving them something new to do, Ellin just high fives them on the way to the winner's circle.\\" Mark Kermode, writing for The Guardian, gave the film one out of five stars, and wrote that \\"The Human Centipede was more sensitively attuned to issues of gender politics. And it had better jokes. Even producer/inspiration Marky Mark [Mark Wahlberg] looks embarrassed by his cameo.\\" Ultimately, Kermode would rank Entourage as the worst film of 2015 and later, in 2018, the worst film of the decade to that point.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEzrUp091cI IGN awarded Entourage a 7.5 out of 10, saying \\"When it sticks to what it has always been best at, the relationship of these four friends, it is as good as the series ever was\\".

It is one of the last Woody cartoons that Walter Lantz Productions released into theaters. In addition to Grace Stafford, who provides Woody's voice, Daws Butler guest stars. Summary In this cartoon, Woody extols his love for pecking utility poles to the point where they are destroyed. At various times in this cartoon he sings a song about his hobby. One group of people who are not pleased with Woody's habit is the local telephone company, which has had to pay thousands to dollars to replace the poles Woody has ruined. Phone company employee Floyd Farkle comes across a set of twelve poles Woody has destroyed and radios into headquarters that Woody has struck again. His boss is not amused and orders Farkle to find the woodpecker or he will lose his job. Hearing Woody pecking nearby, Farkle exits his truck. Meanwhile, Woody pecks the top of a pole so much that it falls off. Farkle then tries to hook Woody with a lasso, only to pull the pole too hard so it crashes on his head. Woody decides to help Farkle by fixing his hard hat, using a stick of dynamite. Woody lights it and tells Farkle to hold his hat over it, and amazingly it works and restores Farkle's hard hat to like new. Of course, since Woody used dynamite to do this the explosion knocks the senses out of Farkle. Farkle's next attempt uses a hot air balloon to fly up to where Woody is so he can shoot him. However, it backfires on him when Woody is able to spin the balloon around, grab Farkle's shotgun, and shoot the balloon causing it to crash to earth. Woody then throws the gun back to Farkle, only to have it go off when it hits the ground and nearly shoot off Woody's tail feathers. Farkle then tries using a rocket and a club, but shoots past Woody into the sky and then crashes to the ground once the rocket burns off. Woody then mocks a frustrated Farkle by saying he should join the circus with that performance. Farkle then goes back into the truck, and Woody sees his next plan: to dress up as a woodpecker himself. Woody plays along and pretends to sleep as Farkle climbs the pole, then pecks him in the rear end as he tries to shoot. Woody then makes small talk with Farkle and allows him to peck the pole with him, but instead pecks the part where Farkle is standing causing him to fall. As Farkle cannot fly, Woody tells him to go practice and pushes him off the pole. As Farkle climbs the pole again after grabbing his shotgun, Woody goes into the truck and radios to the boss imitating Farkle claiming that he has seen the biggest woodpecker ever. The boss dispatches the telephone company's helicopter to take care of it, and the pilot of the helicopter knocks Farkle unconscious with a hammer and then hooks him, dragging him away. A triumphant Woody finishes his song and pecks one last time.

He was one of the three judges, who tried the members of the Brotherhood after their attempted assassination attack against then president Gamal Abdel Nasser in 1954. The other three judges were Anwar Sadat and Abdel Latif Boghdadi. The same year he was among the officers who arrested Mohammed Naguib. Ibrahim was also appointed minister for presidential affairs in 1954. Two years later, in 1956, Ibrahim became the head of the Egyptian economy agency. After dealing with business for a while, in February 1964, he was appointed as one of seven vice presidents of Nasser. Ibrahim resigned from office in 1966 due to Nasser's request to end his relationship with a woman, and continued business activities. Free Officers Movement Ibrahim was among five military officers who formed the first cell of the Free Officers movement in July or September 1949. Although it is argued that Ibrahim along with other officers was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood's special unit from 1944 to 1945, there is another report, stating that Ibrahim was part of the group called Young Egypt. In addition, Ibrahim was one of the nine-member leadership group of the Free Officers movement. The movement led the 1952 Revolution.

All strategic plans should be built upon a grounded, validated and accepted set of strategic assumptions. Any strategic plan or decision is only as good as the strategic assumptions upon which it is based. Strategic assumptions surface and are usually identified when scenario planning is undertaken during a strategic planning process. The strategic assumptions surfacing and testing method (SAST) is one rigorous method of identifying strategic assumptions. Like other types of assumptions, strategic assumptions are the assumptions held by decision-makers about different types of factors and drivers of change that have influenced their thinking, decision-making or planning. Strategic assumptions may be assumptions about events that happened in the past, what is currently happening or what may happen in the future. There are nine categories of strategic assumptions. These nine types are the assumptions being made about: : # macro-environmental forces (from a STEP or PEST analysis), # the market dynamics (e.g. from an analysis of the Porter's Five Forces model), # the needs of customers, # the expectations and behaviours of other stakeholders, # the availability and allocation of money, # the organization's internal processes, # the strengths and weaknesses of its assets, # its workforce, and # the \\"Background of Shared Obviousness\\", that is, the groupthink that exists within the organization around what the company is, what it is able to do and not able to do.

The principal commanders were Union Maj. Gen. Hugh Judson Kilpatrick and Confederate Maj. Gen. Joseph Wheeler. Wheeler was able to score a minor victory over Kilpatrick. Today an annual re-enactment is held the final full weekend in February.  Battle  = Fighting = Before the battle, on February 1 began to invade general Sherman invaded South Carolina. During the invasion he ordered Hugh Judson Kilpatrick and his cavalry corps from the Fifth U.S Cavalry to march through South Carolina. By February 5, he crossed into Aiken County where he would engage in battle with Joseph Wheeler's cavalry corps. Kilpatrick didn't expect that there would be any resistance to his army. Wheeler moved to defend the city of Augusta from the Union army. His army was stationed between Benjamin Franklin Cheatham and James Argle Smith's forces. Specifically 204 Park Avenue. at Under Wheeler's command was the Aiken Home Guard and Wheeler's cavalry. Wheeler planned to defeat Kilpatrick by forming his cavalry into a \\"V\\" shaped formation. With some skirmishers deployed above the formation. When Kilpatrick charged attacked the skirmishers, they would retreat into the center of the \\"V.\\" Once Kilpatrick entered the formation the tips of the \\"V\\" would collapse, thus encircling Kilpatrick. On February 11, the battle started. Wheeler's plan would have worked if had not been for a single Confederate solider who fired his gun prematurely.This resulted in Wheeler ordering all of his soldiers to attack the Union forces. The armies engaged in hand to hand combat all across the town. During the fighting, it was reported tat a Confederate soldier ran up to Kilpatrick and attacked the general with his pistol. However the pistol did not go off. Kilpatrick had still lost the battle, so he retreated back to his defenses at Montmorenci. For the rest of the day Confederate and Union soldiers skirmished. This was until the two commanders signed a truce and agreed to collect the bodies. Later, on February 13 Kilpatrick retreated and rejoined Sherman. Despite all of this, Kilpatrick declared himself victorious. = Casualties = According to the general Kilpatrick, he had killed 31 Confederate soldiers, wounded 160, and captured 60. This would result in the Confederates taking 251 Casualties. However general Wheeler states that he had suffered 50 casualties and that he had killed 53 Union soldiers, wounded 270, and captured 172. This totals to 495 Union Casualties.  In popular culture  In 2005 Christopher Forbes directed and co-wrote a film, along with Michael G Hennessy about The Battle of Aiken.

According to Venator, Tishem was a remarkably erudite woman, fluent in Latin, Greek, French, Italian, and English and able to read Galen's original text. In 1558 in Antwerp, Tishem married a widowed and wealthy merchant and juror, Wouter Gruter (also \\"Walterus\\", \\"de Gruytere\\", etc.), originally from Breda. They had four children, Jan being born in December 1560. Her husband co-signed the Compromise of Nobles in 1566, and to flee prosecution in the Spanish Netherlands, they moved to the Dutch Calvinist exile community of Norwich. Some biographies of Jan Gruter claim that Tishem was originally from Norwich herself,Fuchs, Peter, Gruter, Jan in Neue Deutsche Biographie 7 (1966), pages. 238-240 [Online-Version]Jan Gruter at Early Modern Letters Online though Thijsmans/Thysmans was a regular Flemish patronymic. When their son enrolled at the new Leiden University in Holland in 1578/1579, Catherine and Wouter returned to Antwerp, but the Siege of Antwerp in 1584 made them flee again, this time to L√ºbeck and then Gda≈Ñsk. Wouter Gruter died in Gda≈Ñsk in 1588, and, according to Peter Fuchs, Catherine died in 1595.

In the early months of 980, Nguy·ªÖn B·∫∑c and two other men attempted to organize resistance to Ho√†n.\\" According to Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c t·ªôc th·∫ø ph·∫£(Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c clan Family tree book), Nguy·ªÖn B·∫∑c is the ancestor of Nguy·ªÖn clan,followed by founding of Nguy·ªÖn lords by Nguy·ªÖn Ho√†ng in 1569 and Nguy·ªÖn dynasty in 1802 under the emperor Gia Long.Moreover,he was considered as one of the seven heroes of Giao Ch√¢u(Giao province) according to Vi·ªát S·ª≠ t√¢n bi√™n including :ƒêinh B·ªô Lƒ©nh, ƒêinh Li·ªÖn, L√™ Ho√†n, ƒêinh ƒêi·ªÅn, Ph·∫°m H·∫°p and Ph·∫°m C·ª± L∆∞·ª£ng. Early life According to Kh√¢m ƒë·ªãnh Vi·ªát s·ª≠ Th√¥ng gi√°m c∆∞∆°ng m·ª•c, Nguy·ªÖn B·∫∑c was born in Hoa L∆∞ Cave, ƒê·∫°i Ho√†ng province, ƒê·∫°i C·ªì Vi·ªát. As a youngster growing up in Hoa-L∆∞ Nguy·ªÖn B·∫∑c befriended ƒêinh B·ªô Lƒ©nh, and eventually they and another village kid named ƒêinh ƒêi·ªÅn, Tr·ªãnh T√∫ and L∆∞u C∆°.In their early teenage years the three sworn-brothers and children of neighboring villages achieved notoriety for constantly playing war-games. As time passed, the power of the ƒêinh B·ªô Lƒ©nh's gang in Hoa-l∆∞ became legendary. In the early 960s Vietnam was thrust into chaos due to the petty wars of the Twelve Feudal- Warlords (Th·∫≠p-nh·ªã S·ª©-qu√¢n). Naturally, ƒêinh B·ªô Lƒ©nh and his peasant-warriors were compelled to involve themselves in the struggle. Because of their weaknesses ƒêinh B·ªô Lƒ©nh decided to lead his followers into an alliance with an ethnic Chinese named Tr·∫ßn L√£m, the feudal warlord who had control of B·ªë-h·∫£i Port, the commercial center of the kingdom. The alliance, formed in 963 A.D., turned out to be ƒêinh B·ªô Lƒ©nh's wisest move. ƒêinh B·ªô Lƒ©nh soon transformed his Hoa-L∆∞ warriors and Tr·∫ßn L√£m's mercenaries into a force to be reckon. With his sworn-brothers, Nguy·ªÖn B·∫∑c and ƒêinh ƒêi·ªÅn, as his most trusted commanders and advisers, ƒêinh B·ªô Lƒ©nh began setting out conquering the other eleven feudal warlords to unite the kingdom. Tr·∫ßn L√£m, who was more concerned with the commercial prospects of the conquest than with the unification of Vietnam, gladly and financial supported ƒêinh B·ªô Lƒ©nh's ambitious plan. As ƒêinh B·ªô Lƒ©nh's highly disciplined army crushed one warlord after another, people began referring to the three sworn-brothers and four other of ƒêinh Bo Lƒ©nh's assistants as the Seven Heroes of Giao-ch√¢u (Giao-ch√¢u Th·∫•t H√πng). Chancellor of ƒê·∫°i C·ªì Vi·ªát In historical records,he had 2 brothers Nguy·ªÖn B·ªì and Nguy·ªÖn Ph·ª•c who all three joined in the ƒêinh B·ªô Lƒ©nh's army to suppress the uprising of 12 Warlords.After gaining victory,ƒêinh B·ªô Lƒ©nh establish the new empire and positioned as the chancellor of dynasty. After conquering ten of the eleven warlords ƒêinh B·ªô Lƒ©nh then proclaimed himself emperor in 968 A.D. To deal with the last warlord Emperor ƒêinh B·ªô Lƒ©nh assigned Nguy·ªÖn B·∫∑c the task, for it was this obstinate warlord, Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªß-Ti·ªáp, that had killed Nguy·ªán B·∫∑c's older and only brother, Nguy·ªÖn B·ªì. After three or four battles Nguy·ªÖn B·∫∑c rooted Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªß-Ti·ªáp out of his stronghold at Ti√™n-Du, the old provincial heartland of the kingdom. Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªß-Ti·ªáp fled south to Di·ªÖn Province near the Cham frontier and died there a few months later. Nguy·ªÖn B·∫∑c then returned in triumph to the newly established capital at Hoa-L∆∞. As emperor, ƒêinh B·ªô Lƒ©nh quickly rewarded his long time followers. He placed Nguy·ªÖn B·∫∑c at the head of the nobility with the title Nation-Establishing Duke (ƒê·ªãnh-Qu·ªëc C√¥ng) and officially adopted Nguy·ªÖn B·∫∑c into the newly established royal family. Like Emperor ƒêinh B·ªô Lƒ©nh, Nguy·ªÖn B·∫∑c had risen from the peasantry class to become one of the most powerful figures in the kingdom of Great Vi·ªát (ƒê·∫°i-C·ªì-Vi·ªát), as Vietnam was named under the ƒêinh. When Emperor ƒêinh B·ªô Lƒ©nh and his heir apparent fell victims to an imperial attendant's sword in 979 A.D., the shocked and furious Nguy·ªÖn B·∫∑c beheaded ƒê·ªó Th√≠ch, the assassin, then had the corpse ground up for consumption by the people of Hoa- L∆∞. The people of Hoa-L∆∞, enraged at the assassin for killing their greatest local hero, did not decline the bizarre offering. Nguy·ªÖn B·∫∑c and his only surviving sworn-brother, ƒêinh ƒêi·ªÅn, installed the dead emperor's last son, who was only five-years-old, as emperor. Be that as it may, the discovery of a secret affair between the child-emperor's mother and the ambitious L√™ Ho√†n, whom the late Emperor ƒêinh B·ªô Lƒ©nh had made the General of the Ten Circuits (Th·∫≠p-ƒê·∫°o T∆∞·ªõng-Qu√¢n), marked the end of the ƒêinh dynasty. With the Queen- Mother's support L√™ Ho√†n quickly declared himself Viceroy (Nhi·∫øp-Ch√≠nh), and began plotting a coup d'√©tat. Upon receiving news of the plot, Nguy·ªÖn B·∫∑c and ƒêinh ƒêi·ªÅn, both were in √Åi Province (Thanh-H√≥a) at the time, promptly returned to court with their forces. L√™ Ho√†n sent out messengers to convince Nguy·ªÖn B·∫∑c to cooperate in the establishment of a new dynasty. Naturally, the disgusted Nguy·ªÖn B·∫∑c and his sworn-brother, ƒêinh ƒêi·ªÅn, declined and civil war once again erupted. The ensuing civil war did not last long. L√™ Ho√†n, as commander-in- chief of the main imperial army, easily crushed the ƒêinh loyalists headed by Nguy·ªÖn B·∫∑c. Nguy·ªÖn B·∫∑c was captured and executed on the bank of the Chanh River outside the citadel of Hoa-l∆∞ on 8 November 979 A.D. (October 15 of the lunar calendar). ƒêinh ƒêi·ªÅn and his wife escaped capture and then died mysteriously a month later. In a period of three months the three sworn- brothers died treacherously at the hands of individuals whom they had employed and trusted most. After the death of Nguy·ªÖn B·∫∑c L√™ Ho√†n declared himself emperor and founded a new dynasty in 980 A.D. The Sung dynasty of China refused to recognize L√™ Ho√†n and launched an invasion of Vietnam the following year. However, L√™ Ho√†n refused to submit and rallied the great army that ƒêinh B·ªô Lƒ©nh had built to face the Chinese expeditionary forces. The Vietnamese fought and won another decisive war against the intruding Chinese. The trap laid out by the defending Vietnamese not only killed the Chinese commander-in- chief but also captured his two top commanders. News of the routing of the land forces compelled the Chinese invading fleet to flee back to China. The successes of L√™ Ho√†n's campaign were due largely to the great military machine that ƒêinh B·ªô Lƒ©nh, Nguy·ªÖn B·∫∑c and ƒêinh ƒêi·ªÖn had wholehearted nurtured and formed since the days they played innocent war-games in the village of Hoa-L∆∞. People throughout the kingdom of ƒê·∫°i C·ªì Vi·ªát, especially the villagers around the Hoa-L∆∞ region who knew Emperor ƒêinh B·ªô Lƒ©nh, Nguy·ªÖn B·∫∑c and ƒêinh ƒêi·ªÅn best, grieved at their tragic deaths. To remember their virtues and loyalty, the Vietnamese villagers deified the three sworn-brothers like Liu Bei (L∆∞u B·ªã), Guan Yu (Quan V≈©) and Zhang Fei (Tr∆∞∆°ng Phi) of China and had temples built in their names. In ƒê·∫°i H·ªØu village near Hoa-L∆∞ a temple for the three local heroes still stands today. A statue of Nguy·ªÖn B·∫∑c still exists at his temple in Ng√¥-H·∫° hamlet, Hoa-L∆∞ District. Nguy·ªÖn B·∫∑c's descendants, including the Nguy·ªÖn-Ph√∫c Clan, still pay their respects annually at the tomb built for him by the ƒê·∫°i-H·ªØu villagers in 979 A.D. Nguy·ªÖn B·∫∑c's son Nguy·ªÖn ƒê√™ survived the tragedy of 979 A.D. and later became a battle-buddy of a commander of the Imperial Guards (ƒêi·ªán Ti·ªÅn Ch·ªã Huy S·ª©) named L√Ω C√¥ng U·∫£n. With Nguy·ªÖn ƒê√™'s support L√Ω C√¥ng U·∫©n deposed the unpopular Emperor L√™ Ng·ªça Tri·ªÅu, and ascended the throne as the first emperor of the Later L√Ω dynasty. Following their forebearer's footsteps Nguy·ªÖn ƒê√™ and his sons remained loyal servants of the L√Ω dynasty. Furthermore, many of Nguy·ªÖn B·∫∑c's successors also gave their lives trying to protect or serve their emperors. Nguy·ªÖn Ph·ª•ng, Nguy·ªÖn B·∫∑c's great- grandson, was killed in 1150 for attempting to destroy the usurper ƒê·ªó Anh V≈©. General Nguy·ªÖn N·∫°p H√≤a, a descendant of Nguy·ªÖn B·∫∑c and Nguy·ªÖn Ph·ª•ng, was killed along with Emperor Tr·∫ßn Du·ªá T√¥ng in 1377 while engaging in battle with the famous Cham king, Ch·∫ø B·ªìng Nga. Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Lu·∫≠t, General Nguy·ªÖn N·∫°p H√≤a's son, also died with Emperor Tr·∫ßn Ph·∫ø ƒê·∫ø under the hands of the usurper H·ªì Q√∫y Ly in 1388. Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Du·∫´n, Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Lu·∫≠t's great-grandson, became L√™ L·ª£i's commander of the T·ªëng S∆°n region (Thanh H√≥a) during the war of liberation. After forcing the Ming Chinese to withdraw from Vietnam L√™ L·ª£i proclaimed himself emperor and adopted Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Du·∫´n into the L√™ royal family. Nguy·ªÖn B·∫∑c's descendants through Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Du·∫´n's line continued their family's tradition of excellent national service. When the capital ƒê√¥ng ƒê√¥ fell into the hands of Tr·∫ßn Cao, it was Nguy·ªÖn VƒÉn L·ª±u, Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Du·∫´n's grandson, who recaptured the capital and restored Emperor L√™ T∆∞∆°ng D·ª±c to the throne. Likewise, when M·∫∑c ƒêƒÉng Dung killed Emperor L√™ Cung Ho√†ng in 1527 and proclaimed himself emperor, it was Nguy·ªÖn Cam (or Kim) who took refuge in Laos and campaigned to restore the L√™ dynasty. Emperor L√™ Cung Ho√†ng's son was finally discovered and was then made emperor by Nguy·ªÖn Cam. L√™'s forces under Nguy·ªÖn Cam was beginning to gain momentum when D∆∞∆°ng Ch·∫•p Nh·∫•t, a general for the Mac's, fatally poisoned Nguy·ªÖn Cam. Ancestor of Nguy·ªÖn clan The history of the Nguy·ªÖn family began to change drastically after the death of Nguy·ªÖn Kim in 1545. After the death of Nguy·ªÖn Kim his two sons, Nguy·ªÖn U√¥ng and Nguy·ªÖn Ho√†ng, continued to fight the M·∫°c for the L√™ dynasty. However, it was Nguy·ªÖn Kim's son-in-law, Tr·ªãnh Ki·ªÉm, that triggered the event that changed the whole history of Vietnam. Besides these great male descendants of Nguy·ªÖn B·∫∑c, there were also other royal descendants of his through the female lines. Nguy·ªÖn C√¥ng Du·∫´n's granddaughter, Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã Ng·ªçc H·∫±ng (daughter of Nguy·ªÖn ƒê·ª©c Trung), married Emperor L√™ Th√°nh T√¥ng and then gave birth to a prince who later became Emperor L√™ Hi·ªÉn T√¥ng (1497-1504). Hence, Emperor L√™ Hi·ªÉn T√¥ng and his subsequent royal descendants all had Nguy·ªÖn B·∫∑c's blood in them. Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã Ng·ªçc B·∫£o, the older sister of Lord Nguy·ªÖn Ho√†ng, was married to Tr·ªãnh Ki·ªÉm and later gave birth to Tr·ªãnh Ki·ªÉm's immediate successor, Lord Tr·ªãnh T√πng. Hence, Tr·ªãnh's royal family from Tr·ªãnh T√πng down all carried Nguy·ªÖn B·∫∑c's blood. Nguy·ªÖn princesses were also married to non-Vietnamese rulers as well. In 1620 Princess Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã Ng·ªçc V·∫°n, daughter Lord Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c Nguy√™n, became the wife of Chey-Chetta II of the Khmer Empire. King Chey Chetta II granted Princess Nguy·ªÖn Th·ªã Ng·ªçc V·∫°n's wish and allowed Vietnamese natives to settle in M√¥ Xo√†i (Ba R√Æa). Finally, prior to the complete conquest of Champa, Lord Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c Nguy√™n also betrothed his daughter, Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫c Ng·ªçc Khoa, to King of Champa in 1631.

The thousands of boats that used to work the Black Country canals all needed constant maintenance. In this area there were many working boat yards, or docks, like this one, where boats were built and repaired. They were busy, cluttered places not unlike a modern scrap yard as it was common practice to break wooden boats, salvaging the ironwork. Castlefields boat dock is typical of the many on the Black Country canal system of the period and is equipped to build new working craft and to repair those of iron or composite construction. The dock can accommodate three boats, drawn sideways out of the water by winches onto the slip. There are a number of different buildings on the boat dock each serving a specific purpose. Structures Bridge at the dock Based on an 1880s design the blacksmith shop would have wrought all the supplies needed for boat repair such as specialist nails and bolts and the L shaped boat 'knees' used to reinforce the boat structure. Some blacksmiths may have made horseshoes for the canals working horses. Next to the blacksmiths shop is a series of sheds, the first is made out of the bottom of a recycled boat (see picture). The sheds consist of a nail store and a rivet store which includes a carpenters bench and cast iron stove. At the end of the row is a paint store which would have held all the essentials used in boat painting like red lead, pigments and varnishes. There is also a tackle store with a corrugated roof which would have housed lifting tackle and other boat handling equipment. The boat dock also featured a toilet (earth closet) and a stable to house the working horses. Horses provided \\"hosmuck an' tar\\" (manure and tar) that was used to seal the wooden boats.

Notable early French artists and composers in electronic music include Maurice Martenot, the inventor of the Ondes Martenot in 1928, and Pierre Schaeffer, the developer of the musique concr√®te in 1948. Among the famous contemporary artists include Jean-Michel Jarre, Air, Daft Punk, Justice and M83. History =Phonautograph (1857)= The earliest known sound recording device was the phonautograph, patented in 1857 by √âdouard-L√©on Scott de Martinville.. =Ondes Martenot (1928)= In 1928, the Ondes Martenot was invented by Maurice Martenot, who debuted it in Paris.Composers using the instrument ultimately include Boulez, Honegger, Cannibal Corpse, Jolivet, Koechlin, Messiaen, Milhaud, Tremblay, and Var√®se. In 1937, Messiaen wrote F√™te des belles eaux for 6 ondes Martenot, and wrote solo parts for it in Trois petites Liturgies de la Pr√©sence Divine (1943-44) and the Turangal√Æla Symphonie (1946-48/90). This electronic musical instrument was most famously used in the Turangal√Æla-Symphonie by Olivier Messiaen as well as other works by him. The Ondes Martenot was also used by other composers such as Andre Jolivet, Pierre Boulez, Arthur Honegger, Charles Koechlin, Darius Milhaud, Gilles Tremblay and Edgard Var√®se. =Musique concr√®te (1948)= In 1942, the French composer and theoretician Pierre Schaeffer, began his exploration of radiophony when he joined Jacques Copeau and his pupils in the foundation of the Studio d'Essai de la Radiodiffusion Nationale. His work laid the foundations of the Musique concr√®te. This technique involved editing together recorded fragments of natural and industrial sounds.\\"Musique Concrete was created in Paris in 1948 from edited collages of everyday noise\\" (). The first pieces of musique concr√®te in Paris were assembled by him, who went on to collaborate with Pierre Henry. On 5 October 1948, Radiodiffusion Fran√ßaise (RDF) broadcast composer Pierre Schaeffer's Etude aux chemins de fer. This was the first \\"movement\\" of Cinq √©tudes de bruits, and marked the beginning of studio realizations and musique concr√®te (or acousmatic art). Schaeffer employed a disk-cutting lathe, four turntables, a four-channel mixer, filters, an echo chamber, and a mobile recording unit. Not long after this, Henry began collaborating with Schaeffer, a partnership that would have profound and lasting effects on the direction of electronic music. Another associate of Schaeffer, Edgard Var√®se, began work on D√©serts, a work for chamber orchestra and tape. The tape parts were created at Pierre Schaeffer's studio, and were later revised at Columbia University. In 1950, Schaeffer gave the first public (non-broadcast) concert of musique concr√®te at the Ecole Normale de Musique de Paris. \\"Schaeffer used a PA system, several turntables, and mixers. Later that same year, Pierre Henry collaborated with Schaeffer on Symphonie pour un homme seul (1950) the first major work of musique concrete. In Paris in 1951, in what was to become an important worldwide trend, RTF established the first studio for the production of electronic music. Also in 1951, Schaeffer and Henry produced an opera, Orpheus, for concrete sounds and voices. Jean-Michel Jarre playing a laser harp in Helsinki (2009). =I.R.C.A.M. (1975)= In 1970, the President of France Georges Pompidou asked the composer Pierre Boulez to found an institution for research in new forms of music. The Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique was created under his direction. Since then, IRCAM has been an avant-garde institute for science about music, sound and electro-acoustical art music in France. =Early electronic and space music (1970s)= In 1969, La Cage/Erosmachine was a very early electronic music work by Jean-Michel Jarre who became famous worldwide with the album Oxygene in 1976. Among other experimental electronic music we can cite Igor Wakhevitch with Hathor (1973) and Fran√ßois de Roubaix for the soundtrack of the Jacques-Yves Cousteau film Antartique (1974). \\"Space music\\" and \\"space disco\\" became popular with Space, Magic Fly (1977); Cerrone, Supernature (1977); Dro√Øds, The Force (1977) and Bernard Fevre aka Black Devil Disco Club (1975-1978). Following those and in the late 70s and early 80s other notable French electronic music acts were Philippe Laurent aka Hot Bip (Industrieuse, 1979) and Ren√© Roussel with Caramel (1980). =French Touch (1990)= Following precursors Jean-Michel Jarre and Cerrone, many French electronic artists have gained worldwide recognition under the name of \\"French Touch\\", especially Daft Punk, David Guetta, M83, Justice and Air.

Before becoming an artist, he was previously Chief Investment Officer of Saiers Capital, LLC (formerly Alphabet Management, LLC). Earlier in his career he was a Managing Director at Deutsche Bank AG. Education In 1998, Nelson Saiers earned his Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Virginia at the age of 23, only one year after completing his undergraduate studies. He studied algebraic topology. At Deutsche Bank Saiers was known for his mental math abilities, particularly, squaring large numbers. On one such occasion in 2008, he squared a 20-digit number in his head on a flight back to New York from a business meeting in London. In 2009 Saiers experienced a crippling headache amid his attempt to square a 43-digit number (a calculation he had just begun working on over the prior several days). In addition to the severe headache, he had a reduced capacity to form sentences and brain fog. While these symptoms dissipated within a couple of days, this episode led him to give up on his ultimate goal squaring of a 50-digit number. He would often work on these calculations while sitting and walking in Central Park. Financial career Nelson began his trading career at Susquehanna Investment Group. He also later worked at UBS and Deutsche Bank. At Deutsche Bank, Nelson was a Managing Director and ran a proprietary trading business focused on derivatives. In July 2010, Nelson left Deutsche Bank to join Alphabet Management, a New York hedge fund specializing in options. He was promoted to Chief Investment Officer in March 2011, just eight months after joining the firm. Saiers' younger brother Scott also joined Alphabet in February 2012 as Head Trader. In 2011, Alphabet Management won the HFMWeek award for the top Relative Value Hedge Fund. In December 2012 Alphabet announced that the firm would be changing its name to Saiers Capital, LLC. Barron's described Saiers as a star quantitative investor. Art career Nelson is currently a professional artist based in New York City. Mathematics, finance, physics, history, and braille play a significant role in his art. His art has been featured in solo shows at Harvard University's Leverett House, Alcatraz, the Plaza Hotel's Edwardian Room, and several NY galleries.. Saiers also installed a 9-foot inflatable rat covered with bitcoin references and code in front of the Federal Reserve as a homage to Satoshi Nakamoto and NYC union street protests. The New York Observer referred to Saiers as \\"The Warhol of Wall Street\\", and Artnet asked if he is a modern-day Kandinsky. While math dominates much of his art, its role, and how it is utilized vary (metaphor, analogy, play on words, etc). The topics incorporated are also diverse ranging from famous classic results to fundamental 20th-century concepts and theorems. Life and personality Saiers was born in Denver, Colorado but raised in Ethiopia, Afghanistan, Swaziland, Ghana and Virginia while his father, Larry, worked for the USAID. As a child Saiers lived through several violent conflicts overseas. During his time in Afghanistan, the events (Saur Revolution and others) that led to the full-blown Soviet invasion were underway and included the assassinations of the Afghan President Daud Khan and US ambassador Adolph Dubs. Saiers' experiences included hiding in his family's closet and under their stairs as tanks fired on the road in front of his house and having Su-7 or MiG fighter planes fly near his home as they bombed Kabul. His family moved to Swaziland in late April 1979 (as aid to Afghanistan was cut in response to Dubs' assassination). In Ethiopia, the infant Saiers and his mother were held up at gunpoint during the ongoing coups post the death of Haile Selassie. Press quotes Nelson has been quoted in Bloomberg, The Wall Street Journal, Barron's, and The Financial Post on topics such as China, India, European Sovereign Debt, Facebook, Dell, and the price of gold as well as overall market trends.  Philanthropy  Nelson has an affiliation with charity: water, which attempts to provide clean water to those in developing countries. Nelson is a Founding Member of The Well, a core group of donors who support charity: water. In October 2013, during the graffiti artist Banksy's month-long New York project \\"Better Out Than In,\\" Nelson made a public offer to donate $100,000 to the Hurricane Sandy rebuilding effort if Banksy created a legal mural in New York to raise awareness for people still affected by the storm. An anonymous donor \\"RD\\" has also joined this effort, and has pledged an additional $100,000. Nelson has created a website for the effort: http://www.heybanksy.com. Whether the piece was created or not is unknown, but on October 28, Nelson decided to go forward with the $100,000 donation regardless.

It was prepared by the Division on Investment and Enterprise (DIAE) of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). IPFSD is not a negotiated text or undertaking between States; but rather an initiative by the UNCTAD Secretariat that represents expert guidance while leaving domestic policy makers free to adapt and adopt. IPFSD is the result of numerous consultations with experts and is intended as a platform to provide for further consultation and discussion with all investment stakeholders. The main objective of the IPFSD is to create a balance between the rights and obligations of States and investors while maintaining attractive investment environments. In the face of persistent global economic and social challenges, UNCTAD's IPFSD intends to: *Promote a new generation of investment agreements by pursuing a broader development agenda; and *Offer guidance to policymakers when formulating their national and international investment policies. To that end, IPFSD defines eleven critical Core Principles. Flowing from these Core Principles IPFSD provides States guidelines and advice on formulating good investment policy including clause-by-clause options for negotiators to enhance the sustainable development value of domestic investment policies.  Background to the IPFSD  IPFSD has grown out of a long precedent of UN Member States calling for sustainable economic development, an understanding that investment is a critical aspect of sustainable development, and UNCTAD's three-and-a-half decades of experience in research and policy analysis. The UN Charter promotes, inter alia, the goal of economic and social progress. The UN Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) call for a Global Partnership for Development. In particular, Goal 8 encourages the further development of an open, rule-based, predictable, non-discriminatory trading and financial system, which includes a commitment to good governance, development, and poverty reduction, both nationally and internationally- concepts that apply equally to the investment system. The ‚ÄúMonterrey Consensus‚Äù of the UN Conference on Financing for Development 2002, acknowledges that countries need to continue their efforts to achieve a transparent, stable and predictable investment climate. The UN Johannesburg Plan of Implementation of September 2002, following up on the Rio Declaration, calls for the formulation and elaboration of national strategies for sustainable development, which integrate economic, social and environmental aspects. The 4th UN Conference on Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in May 2011 adopted the Istanbul Programme of Action with a strong focus on productive capacity building and structural transformation as core elements to achieve more robust, balanced, equitable, and inclusive sustainable development. Finally, the 2012 UNCTAD XIII Conference recognized the role of FDI in sustainable development and inclusive growth. Several other international instruments inspired the Core Principles that make up the IPFSD. They comprise, in particular, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the Convention on the Establishment of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, the World Bank Guidelines, the UN Global Compact and the ILO Tripartite Declaration of Principles concerning Multinational Enterprises and social policy and several WTO-related agreements, including the General Agreement on Trade in Services, the TRIMs Agreement and the Agreement on Government Procurement.  Structure and components of the IPFSD  right The IPFSD consists of eleven core principles which aim to guide the investment policy underlying IIAs. Flowing from these core principles, the IPFSD provides States guidelines and advice on formulating good investment policies. The IPFSD proposes clause-by-clause options for negotiators to strengthen the sustainable development aspects of IIAs. IPFSD also offers an interactive online platform giving stakeholders the opportunity to critically assess policy guidelines and recommend any appropriate changes. = The Core Principles = The eleven core principles of the IPFSD are: # Investment for sustainable development # # Policy coherence # # Public governance and institutions # # Dynamic Policymaking # # Balanced rights and obligations # # Right to regulate # # Openness to investment # # Investment protection and treatment # # Investment promotion and facilitation # # Corporate governance and responsibility # # International cooperation = National Investment Policy: Guidelines = The national investment policy guidelines translate the core principles for investment policy making into concrete guidelines at the national level, with a view to addressing specific policy changes. These guidelines are designed to ensure that investment policy is coherent with the overarching development strategy of countries, enhance the sustainable development impact of investment and promote responsible investment. The guidelines further aim to balance maximizing sustainable development outcomes while maintaining an attractive investment climate. The national investment policy guidelines targets policy action at three levels: *Strategic ‚Äì policymakers should ground investment policy in a broad roadmap for economic growth and sustainable development, such as those set out in formal economic or industrial development strategies in many countries. *Normative ‚Äì by setting rules and regulations on investment and in a range of other policy areas, policymakers can promote and regulate investment that is geared towards sustainable development goals. *Administrative ‚Äì through appropriate implementation and institutional mechanisms, policymakers can ensure continued relevance and effectiveness of investment policies. = International Investment Agreements (IIAs): Policy Options = The IPFSD aims to translate the Core Principles into concrete options for policymakers with a view to addressing today‚Äôs investment challenges by providing examples of how to draft IIAs that address sustainable development by strengthening development dimensions of IIAs, balancing the rights and obligations of States and investors, and managing the systematic complexity of the IIA regime. International investment policy must be addressed at three levels. *Strategic ‚Äì this involves managing the interaction between IIAs and national policies, and those between IIAs and other international agreements e.g. human rights obligations. The overall objective is to ensure coherence between IIAs and sustainable development goals. *Designing provisions for sustainable development‚Äì this concerns addressing the policy space and balancing rights and obligations between States and investors, and effective investment promotion. *Building multilateral consensus on investment policy ‚Äì this goes toward helping address the systemic challenges that emerge from overlaps and inconsistencies in the IIA regime. The IPFSD suggests, clause-by-clause, how the IPFSD's Core Principles can be converted into concrete provisions in an IIA. Governments can choose from these explicit policy options those that best suit their countries‚Äô levels of development and respective policy objectives. Among others these include: adjustments of existing IIA provisions(e.g. making them more sustainable development-friendly through formulations that safeguard policy space and limit State liability); new provisions in IIAs (e.g. to balance investor rights and responsibilities and to promote responsible investment); and the introduction of Special and Differential Treatment (SDT) (e.g. clauses for less-developed Parties to calibrate the level of obligations to the country‚Äôs level of development). Some specific clause-level recommendations include: *Narrowing the scope-and-definition clause to exclude portfolio, short-term or speculative investments from treaty coverage; *Formulating the fair and equitable treatment (FET) clause as an exhaustive list of State obligations (e.g. not to (i) deny justice; (ii) treat investors in a manifestly arbitrary manner; (iii) flagrantly violate due process); *Clarifying the distinction between legitimate regulatory activity and regulatory takings giving rise to compensation (i.e. indirect expropriations); *Limiting the Full Protection and Security (FPS) clause to establish that \\"physical\\" security and protection will only commensurate with the country's level of development; *Limiting the scope of the transfer-of-funds clause by providing an exhaustive list of covered payments/transfers, including exceptions triggered by serious balance-of-payment difficulties, and stipulating that the investor's transfer rights are contingent on its compliance with the host State's fiscal and other transfer-related obligations; *Including exceptions to protect human rights, health, core labour standards and the environment, along with a check-and-balance system that ensures there is enough policy space while avoiding abuse; and *Including clauses designed to eliminate or make investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) the last resort (e.g. after the investor's exhaustion of local remedies and use of Alternative Dispute Resolution mechanisms).  The New Generation of Investment Policies  The IPFSD embodies the new generation of investment policies that seeks to create a more intricate development strategy that maintains a favorable investment climate. New generation investment policies seek to give investment policy a more prominent place in development strategies. The continuous need to respond to newly emerging challenges and trends make it necessary to review and modify these guidelines.  Dynamic Nature of IPFSD and The Investment Policy Hub  IPFSD has been designed with the intention of providing immediate technical assistance for the negotiation of investment agreements, while maintaining a dialog between investment policy stakeholders including the international development community, investors, business associations, labor unions, relevant NGOs and interest groups. The result of these ongoing multi-stakeholder consultations will be a dynamic document. To that end, in concert with IPFSD, UNCTAD has provided a platform for further consultation and discussion with all investment stakeholders‚Äîthe Investment Policy Hub which allows investment stakeholders to post comments regarding the content of the IPFSD. The combination then, of IPFSD and the Investment Policy Hub will enable IPFSD to remain a valuable resource for investment policy makers into the future.

He is best known for his work on the fortifications of Menorca and Gibraltar although he considered his work on Fort George to be his \\"monument\\". Life Skinner was born in St. Kitts in 1700; his parents Thomas and Elizabeth died when he was young and he was adopted by his aunt, Mrs Lambert. She remarried Captain Talbot Edwards, chief engineer in Barbados and the Leeward Islands, who was later appointed Deputy Chief Engineer of Great Britain. He was educated in Paris and Vienna. Career Skinner was accepted as a practitioner engineer on 11 May 1719.William Skinner, DNB, accessed 31 January 2013 The next few years were spent working on defences in Devonport, Menorca and Gibraltar; his survey of the peninsula proved of great value during the 1727 Thirteenth Siege of Gibraltar where he was rewarded with additional pay for his achievements. He was promoted steadily serving eventually as Director of engineering in Gibraltar. In 1746 he was sent to Scotland where the government intended to increase the fortifications now that the Jacobite Rebellion had been ended. In 1751, he began work on Fort George which cost over 100,000 pounds and was made to Skinner's design. Skinner was to refer to the fort as his \\"monument\\" and would manage every detail which John Adam oversaw as the main contractor. James O'Hara, 2nd Baron Tyrawley became Governor of Gibraltar in 1756 and set about improving the fortifications. These changes came under the notice and criticism of Lord George Sackville and Skinner wrote a report describing their inefficiency and arbitrariness.

The film premiered at the San Diego Black Film Festival in January 2013 and in 2015, Zuberi published a companion book through Rowman & Littlefield.  Synopsis  The film focuses on the African Independence Movements and the problems confronted by these movements to win independence. The film tells the story through interviews with independence activists and leaders who helped achieve independence for the African people. By focusing on four watershed events-World War Two, the end of colonialism, the Cold War, and the era of African Republics, African Independence tells the story of African history, past and present. Tukufu Zuberi is also the host of the film.African Independence Film  African Independence: How Africa Shapes the World  In 2015 Zuberi released a companion book to the film, African Independence: How Africa Shapes the World, through Rowman & Littlefield. The book was reviewed by Paul Chiudza Banda for African Studies Quarterly. In his review Banda notes that Zuberi \\"overlooks the fact that African decolonization was not just achieved because of the role of nationalism alone\\" and that he failed to add that colonial policy changes towards Africa post World War II contributed to the decolonization. He further advised readers to note that Zuberi used two approaches in the film, the postcolonial approach and transnational approach when discussing the decolonization, and that Zuberi had a noticeable bias towards African nationalism when talking about the Decolonization of Africa.

They date back to the Lower Mississippian, about 345 million years ago. Fossil beds One of the locations from which Agaricocrinus americanus is known is the Edwardsville Formation, in the vicinity of Crawfordsville, Montgomery County, Indiana, in the United States. In this fossil-rich bed have been found the fossils of sixty species of crinoid, distributed among more than forty genera. It is thought that the various species had different length stalks so that they could capture plankton drifting past at various heights above the substrate. The fossil beds were formed at a time when the seabed was much higher than it is today. It is believed that the crinoids were buried in sediment from nearby deltas during storms. The resulting siltstone deposits are soft enough for the fossils to be extracted in three-dimensional relief. Stalk and detached arms Other fossils of this species have been found in similar sedimentary rocks in Whites Creek in Davidson County, Tennessee, from Osagean rocks in Kentucky, and more recently from the Fort Payne Formation near the boundary between Tennessee and Kentucky. Certain morphological differences have been found between various specimens from these different locations and new finds have often been claimed as new species. David Meyer and William Ausich studied the genus Agaricocrinus in 1997 and proposed that A. arcula, A. dissimilis, A. elegans, A. podagricus, A. ponderosus, A. profundus and A. tugurium should be brought into synonymy with Agaricocrinus americanus. A closely related but less common species is Agaricocrinus crassus. Description Like extant crinoids, Agaricocrinus americanus was anchored to a hard surface by a holdfast out of which grew an articulated stalk. On top of this was a calyx with a number of feather-like arms. Each arm bore short branches known as pinnules and from these cirri were extended which sifted plankton from the water flowing past.

It was produced by the National Film Board of Canada (NFB) and Parks Canada. The film documents human-bear interactions in Canada's National Parks. It was narrated by Chief Dan George and Patricia Best, and was co-written and edited by Adbusters founder Kalle Lasn. Background Canada's mountain national parks, particularly Banff and Jasper, had become popular international destinations by the 1930s. Parks Canada allowed the development of new paved roads, resulting in an influx of automobile tourism. Interacting with the many black and grizzly bears in the parks became a popular activity, with many tourists feeding the animals and posing for pictures. By the 1960s, Parks Canada noted the existence of \\"problem\\" or \\"bum\\" bears; these were animals who had become dependent on human food and habituated to human contact, making them a threat to both visitors and themselves. Tourists were mauled and killed, and hundreds of bears were destroyed. By the late 1960s, the agency decided that it needed more educational materials to help inform tourists of good practices regarding bears. It had published pamphlets since the 1940s, but saw the need for a film exploring the troubled relationship between bears and humans. Production Schmalz, who had recently finished a film on Dall sheep, contacted the NFB about making an educational film about bears in the Parks. The filmmaker had become interested in the topic after learning of the shooting of two grizzly cubs in Banff by park wardens. Parks Canada agreed to help produce the film, and Schmalz began work in 1974. He consulted with park wardens in Kootenay, Waterton, Banff, and Jasper national parks. Storyboards were developed with the consultation of the Parks agency. Schmalz attended bear conferences and worked with biologists, including Stephen Herrero from the University of Calgary. The film was shot in 16 mm over three years and adhered to a strict script. He witnessed some horrific events during the filming; a wildlife biologist technician was mauled to death when a drugged grizzly woke up during transport. Wardens also enticed bears into good filming locations with elk carcasses. Scenes of wardens shooting bears were cut from the final film by Parks Canada. After filming was completed, the NFB brought in Kalle Lasn, an Estonian-Canadian editor. Lasn had just returned from Japan, and brought \\"avant-garde\\" editing styles. They worked together on writing the narration, which would be spoken by Chief Dan George and Patricia Best. The musical score was written by Craig Tomlinson who also had suggested the use of Chief Dan George for narration and singers Anne Mortifee and Jane Mortifee to be used in the film's score. Tomlinson had worked during production on second camera and sound recording as well as in post production with Lasn, as an assistant editor. The film was released in 1978. Synopsis The film is roughly separated into five sequences. The first sequence features George's narration, where the relationship between the two species is introduced. As Best's narration takes over, the film relates the problem of the \\"bum\\" bear and how bears become habituated to human contact and food. A third sequence uses actors to portray a couple camping in Banff. They notice grizzly tracks and subsequently use the Parks' suggested practices when setting up their camp. The film documents tourists interacting with bears, often feeding them from cars. It captures dramatic scenes of \\"bear traffic jams\\", where dozens of vehicles stop to feed and cajole groups of bears. Parks officials relate bear problems within the parks; Schmalz filmed one official describing a tourist attempting to push a black bear into the driver's seat of his car for a photo opportunity. Through the Park wardens, the film illustrates the measures humans should take to keep bears wild and unspoiled. Awards The film won the 1980 Wildlife Society Conservation Education Award, as well as an award at the International Wildlife Film Festival. Schmalz's camerawork was recognized by the Alberta Cinematographers Association. It also received the Certificate of Excellence from the 1981 Audubon International Environmental Film Festival.

West of the store a grain and sugar beet transferring station was built on a siding off the main line, and remained until the late 1940s.Michigan Central Railroad Time Tables The passenger train scheduled stops lasted until 1950 when demand for passenger service dropped sharply due to automobile use. In 1960 Glen Rae succumbed to the fate of many small community centers when rail was no longer important for travel or the shipping of farm goods. The closing of the train station in the early 1950s was followed by the closing of the post office in 1960. In 1962 the railroad tracks were lifted, and finally in the early 1970s the store closed and the buildings and acreage was sold off. Today, all that remains is a driveway culvert in the drainage ditch on the East side of Oakdale Road, and the faint footprint of old foundations in a farm field. The old rail bed is now the right of way for a high voltage power line.

Hunting World, 537 F.2d 4 (2nd Cir. 1976) established the spectrum of trademark distinctiveness in the US, breaking trademarks into classes which are accorded differing degrees of protection. Courts often speak of marks falling along the following \\"spectrum of distinctiveness,\\" also known within the US as the \\"Abercrombie classification\\" or \\"Abercrombie factors\\". The lawsuit was brought by Abercrombie & Fitch Co. against Hunting World, Inc. regarding Abercrombie's trademark on the word \\"Safari\\", and resulting in Abercrombie's loss of the trademark.  The spectrum of distinctiveness  The Abercrombie court determined that descriptive words can get trademark protection if they develop a secondary meaning. The protection only exists for source-designating uses of the word, not descriptive or generic uses of the word. =Fanciful marks= A fanciful / inherently distinctive trademark is prima facie registrable, and comprises an entirely invented or \\"fanciful\\" sign. For example, \\"Kodak\\" had no meaning before it was adopted and used as a trademark in relation to goods, whether photographic goods or otherwise. Invented marks are neologisms which will not previously have been found in any dictionary. =Arbitrary marks= An arbitrary trademark is usually a common word which is used in a meaningless context (e.g. \\"Apple\\" for computers). Such marks consist of words or images which have some dictionary meaning before being adopted as trademarks, but which are used in connection with products or services unrelated to that dictionary meaning. Arbitrary marks are also immediately eligible for registration. Salty would be an arbitrary mark if it used in connection with e.g. telephones such as in Salty Telephones, as the term \\"salt\\" has no particular connection with such products. =Suggestive marks= A suggestive trademark tends to indicate the nature, quality, or a characteristic of the products or services in relation to which it is used, but does not describe this characteristic, and requires imagination on the part of the consumer to identify the characteristic. Suggestive marks invoke the consumer‚Äôs perceptive imagination. An example of a suggestive mark is Blu-ray, a new technology of high-capacity data storage. =Descriptive marks= A descriptive mark is a term with a dictionary meaning which is used in connection with products or services directly related to that meaning. An example might be Salty used in connection with saltine crackers or anchovies. Such terms are not registrable unless it can be shown that distinctive character has been established in the term through extensive use in the marketplace (see further below). Lektronic was famously refused protection by the USPTO on ground of being descriptive for electronic goods. =Generic terms= A generic term is the common name for the products or services in connection with which it is used, such as \\"salt\\" when used in connection with sodium chloride. A generic term is not capable of serving the essential trademark function of distinguishing the products or services of a business from the products or services of other businesses, and therefore cannot be afforded any legal protection. This is because there has to be some term which may generally be used by anyone‚Äîincluding other manufacturers‚Äîto refer to a product without using some organization's proprietary trademark. Marks which become generic after losing distinctive character are known as genericized trademarks.

The core of Higashikuni-Kyo was mastery of Buddhism and a shared message of world peace through benevolence, service, devotion, and eternal peace in human society. Religious practices would include pilgrimages consoling the spirits of the dead from World War II and offering respectful and mourning prayers at tombs of unknown soldiers in various countries around the world.

Obara intended to appeal to those accustomed to Emperor Worship by utilizing the name of former Prince Higashikuni. On June 1, 1950, the Higashikuni-Kyo religious organization was registered in accordance with Article 2 of the Religious Corporations Ordinance and listed Ryukai Obara as its superintendent. The Special Investigation Bureau advised the organization that Higashikuni should retire from his position of founder and the organization should be renamed immediately. The Organizations Control Ordinance did not allow former General Higashikuni to assume a leading position within the organization. For this reason, the organization asked for Higashikuni's retirement from office and decided not to use his name on documents related to the organization. The faith was also renamed Hoo-kyo and appointed Obara to the position of founder.

Violation of these laws can lead to fines and jail time. Criminal copyright laws have been a part of U.S. laws since 1897, which added a misdemeanor penalty for unlawful performances if \\"willful and for profit\\". Criminal penalties were greatly expanded in the latter half of the twentieth century, and those found guilty of criminal copyright infringement may now be imprisoned for decades, and fined hundreds of thousands of dollars. Criminal penalties, in general, require that the offender knew that he or she was committing a crime, while civil copyright infringement is a strict liability offense, and offenders can be \\"innocent\\" (of intent to infringe), as well as an \\"ordinary\\" infringer or a \\"willful\\" infringer.  History  In 1787, the Founding Fathers of the United States wrote the Copyright Clause into the U.S. Constitution, which granted the United States Congress the power, ‚Äú[t]o promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries.‚ÄùU.S. Constitution, Article I, ¬ß 8, Cl. 8. Copyright grants a limited monopoly to authors over the production and dissemination of their creative expression to incentivize further creative production. Protection is constitutionally limited in duration and scope to prevent detrimental monopolies on culture.Charles Von Simson, Feist or Famine American Database Copyright As an Economic Model for the European Union, 20 Brook. J. Int'l L. 729, 733-35 (1995). The copyright protection written into the Constitution was first enacted in the Copyright Act of 1790, which granted national protection to American authors for 14 years, with one optional 14-year renewal. Copyright remained comparatively limited for around a hundred years, and infringement remained a civil infraction. The Supreme Court has, in the past, interpreted this as establishing that copyright was not a natural law property right, but rather a limited statutory monopoly granted by Congress.Dowling v. United States, 473 U.S. 207, 216 (1985). The first criminal provision in U.S. copyright law was added in 1897, which established a misdemeanor penalty for ‚Äúunlawful performances and representations of copyrighted dramatic and musical compositions‚Äù if the violation had been ‚Äúwillful and for profit.‚ÄùAct of Jan. 6, 1897, ch. 4, . The length of protection has been increasing since the Copyright Act of 1909, which extended the term of copyright to 28 years with an optional 28-year extension.Copyright Act of 1909, , , ¬ß 28. At present, copyright protection lasts for the author's life plus 70 years or, in the case of anonymous works and works-for-hire, for 95 years from the date of publication or 120 from the year of creation, whichever expires first..  Theoretical underpinnings  Assigning criminal liability to copyright violations is troubling in light of the general justifications of criminal sanction to punish harms to individuals or national policies, or to foster moral behavior that implicates societal interests.Geraldine Szott Moohr, The Crime of Copyright Infringement: An Inquiry Based on Morality, Harm, and Criminal Theory, 83 B.U. L. Rev. 731, 753 (2003). In many cases what counts as criminal infringement or \\"theft\\" under the criminal copyright statues may not be considered irregular behavior by the society at large, and the harm done to the rightsholder differs from standard notions of larceny in that there has been no \\"trespassory taking and carrying away of the personal property of another with intent to steal the same.\\"Rollin M. Perkins, Criminal Law 234 (2d ed. 1969); cited in Loren, supra note 3, at 858. Using criminal penalties in order to shape behavior is likely to fail where the rules and regulations are difficult to interpret, and may only result in a widespread chilling effect when citizens understand the threat but not the law.  Legal definition  Criminal copyright infringement requires that the infringer acted \\"for the purpose of commercial advantage or private financial gain.\\" 17 U.S.C. ¬ß 506(a).United States v. Wise, 550 F.2d 1180, 1186 (9th Cir. 1977)(\\"Any act which is inconsistent with the exclusive rights of the copyright holder... constitutes infringement\\"). To establish criminal liability, the prosecutor must first show the basic elements of copyright infringement: ownership of a valid copyright, and the violation of one or more of the copyright holder's exclusive rights. The government must then establish that defendant willfully infringed or, in other words, possessed the necessary mens rea. Misdemeanor infringement has a very low threshold in terms of number of copies and the value of the infringed works. An individual may be liable if the infringement was committed: (B) by the reproduction or distribution, including by electronic means, during any 180-day period, of 1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or more copyrighted works, which have a total retail value of more than $1,000; or (C) by the distribution of a work being prepared for commercial distribution, by making it available on a computer network accessible to members of the public, if such person knew or should have known that the work was intended for commercial distribution. 17 U.S.C. ¬ß 506(a)(1). Felony copyright infringement has a slightly higher threshold and possibly serious penalties. 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 2319(b). (1) shall be imprisoned not more than 5 years, or fined in the amount set forth in this title, or both, if the offense consists of the reproduction or distribution, including by electronic means, during any 180-day period, of at least 10 copies or phonorecords, of 1 or more copyrighted works, which have a total retail value of more than $2,500; (2) shall be imprisoned not more than 10 years, or fined in the amount set forth in this title, or both, if the offense is a felony and is a second or subsequent offense. Without establishing the threshold value, legitimate infringement, or the requisite state of mind, there can be no criminal liability. If the defendant can show they had a legitimate copy or use ‚Äì such as through the first-sale doctrine ‚Äì then the burden of proof falls on the government.  Civil vs. criminal copyright infringement  Violation of the copyright holder's exclusive rights can trigger civil, or possibly criminal, penalties. Statutory interpretations of criminal liability provisions have historically been more narrowly construed than those assigning civil penalties. Modern copyright provisions address both criminal and civil liability, as well as addressing the interests of both copyright holders and the public, though the reconceptualization of infringement as theft has led to a gradual worsening of criminal penalties.Geraldine Szott Moohr, Defining Overcriminalization Through Cost-Benefit Analysis: The Example of Criminal Copyright Laws, 54 AM. U. L. REV. 783, 802 (2005). While the legislative history states that ‚Äú[i]n cases where civil liability is unclear ‚Äì whether because the law is unsettled, or because a legitimate business dispute exists ‚Äì the Committee does not intend to establish criminal liability‚Äù there remains a high degree of uncertainty in these cases.Legislative History ‚Äì Copyright Felony Act. H.R. REP. NO. 997. There are three levels of civil copyright infringement: civil infringers may be ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù, ‚Äúordinary‚Äù, or ‚Äúwillful‚Äù. There is a range of penalties which can be imposed on criminal infringers depending on the egregiousness of the offense and in deference to prosecutorial discretion. Innocent infringers are those who are ‚Äúnot aware and had no reason to believe that his or her acts constituted infringement of copyright,‚Äù which implies that some degree of negligence or knowledge is required for ordinary civil infringement. Willful infringement, by extension, requires a higher degree of culpability. The degree of knowledge or ‚Äúwillfulness‚Äù required for civil liability for copyright infringement is rather low and undefined. No knowledge or intent is strictly necessary for a finding of civil infringement, insofar as it is a strict liability offense. While in certain cases there are indications that willful infringement in a civil suit requires some knowledge that the defendant knew that, ‚Äú[h]is actions constituted copyright infringement or acted with a reckless disregard for the copyright holder‚Äôs rights,‚Äù this position is disputed and some Circuits merely require the infringement is ‚Äúknowing‚Äù to warrant an aggravated penalty for the defendant.  Policy  The regulatory proclivity to restrict access to copyrighted material has built up over time. There has been a continual increase in number of cases pursued and the seriousness of the penalties imposed by the U.S. government, which has recently announced its intention to prioritize criminal prosecution of copyright infringers. This is problematic in that the thresholds are so low, the values of works tend to be liberally interpreted, and the potential penalties are so high. The civil statute imposes strict liability for infringement and high statutory damages while a wide range of behaviors could fall under the criminal statutes. The conflation of the lower civil thresholds with criminal penalties is more likely where there is no clear guidance, as with legislators trusting the courts to interpret ‚Äúwillfulness‚Äù in criminal copyright infringement proceedings, and in instances where the government has explicitly designated resources toward prosecuting a given crime. Statutory inflation is common where courts are given uncertain or differing standards for violation of a statute which is both remedial and penal, where courts defer to legislators, and legislators write broad laws trusting to judicial restraint to restrict them from being applied to small actors.Lawrence M. Solan, Statutory Inflation and Institutional Choice, 44 WM. & MARY L. REV. 2209, 2215 (2003). While under other circumstances prosecutorial discretion might have proven a reliable protection against spurious prosecutions, the expansive writing the criminal copyright statute has allowed for the inclusion of small actors within the purview of criminal copyright law. When prosecutors within the Department of Justice are charged with bringing criminal infringement cases, they are more likely to pursue otherwise marginal cases and look for the courts to interpret the law as expansively as it is written.

Afterwards, Sexton operated an import business, traveling frequently to Mexico. The Sextons divorced, and Fred later remarried and lived briefly in Palos Verdes. In 1950, he moved with his wife to Mexico. There, he divorced and remarried once more, and had another daughter.  The Maltese Falcon movie prop  Fred Sexton and The Maltese Falcon director John Huston (ca. 1960) In August 2013, Michele Fortier, the daughter of Fred Sexton, was interviewed on camera by UCLA Professor Vivian Sobchack, Ph.D. Fortier recounted her father‚Äôs creation of the Maltese Falcon prop model for the Warner Bros. production of ‚ÄúThe Maltese Falcon‚Äù in 1941, as well as visits to the film set where she interacted with actors Humphrey Bogart and Sydney Greenstreet, and director John Huston. Fortier recalled that her father made ‚Äúpreliminary sketches‚Äù for the Maltese Falcon prop on a ‚Äúmanila envelope,‚Äù and then sculpted the model for the prop in clay. During visits to the film set, she remembered seeing a prop that was ‚Äúshiny and black,‚Äù but ‚Äúnot like patent leather shoes.‚Äù Fortier also identified initials inscribed in the right rear tail feather of a plaster Maltese Falcon prop owned by Hank Risan as her father‚Äôs. Fortier explained that she owns many of her father‚Äôs paintings and commented that many of the signatures feature the same idiosyncratic characteristics.

His works primarily deal with Stalinism, anti-Semitism, and the philosophical-religious view of a peaceful coexistence between Jews and Christians.  Biography  Gorenstein was born into a Jewish family, his father, Naum Isaevich Gorenstein (1902‚Äî1937), was a professor of political economy. His mother, Enna Abramovna Prilutskaya, was an educator. During the Stalinist repressions, his father was arrested in 1935 and sent to GULAG. He was shot in 1937 after trying to escape. After the arrest of his father, Friedrich bore the name of the mother (Felix Prilutsky). He later regained his original name. His mother was the director of a home for juvenile offenders in Berdichev, Ukraine. During the Nazi invasion of 1941, he and his mother were evacuated to Orenburg in the Urals. His mother died of tuberculosis in 1943 in Orenburg. Frederick was placed in an orphanage. After the war, he was raised by his aunts, Zloty and Rachel, in Berdichev. Following World War II, Gorenstein struggled as an unskilled worker, until Nikita Khrushchev's De- Stalinization allowed him to return to Kiev. He studied mining in Dnipropetrovsk in the 1950s and worked as a miner and mining engineer in the Ural Mountains and Ukraine. Gorenstein moved to Moscow in 1962 to complete his scenarist course at the State Film University. He began writing screenplays to support himself. Most of his adaptions were censored, but he managed to finish his works, including writing the script for the 1972 science fiction film Solaris, directed by Andrei Tarkovsky. He also wrote books, but none were published except \\"–î–æ–º —Å –±–∞—à–µ–Ω–∫–æ–π\\" (The House with the Tower) (1964). In 1977 Gorenstein released his works through foreign emigration presses to bypass censorship. That and his membership in the forbidden writers union and Almanach Metropol by Vasily Aksyonov got him in trouble with the Soviet government. He received a scholarship from the German Academic Exchange Service and emigrated to Berlin in 1979, working there as a writer until his death in 2002. His novel Place was nominated for the 1992 Russian Booker Prize. In 1995 he was a member of the jury at the 19th Moscow International Film Festival. Themes Gorenstein's themes reflect the repressive political life he witnessed in Communist Russia. He expressed his belief in a united, peaceful nation with conformity and without totalitarism and anti-Semitism. His work The House with the Tower has existentialist themes in the style of Franz Kafka, Albert Camus, and Jean-Paul Sartre. Other works move away from existentialism and incorporate religious themes, particularly Judaism. One example is Berdychev, which recounts the life of a Jew in the pre-WWII Ukraine.

The system that was to become Gavin was first identified during March 2, as a weak tropical depression that had developed within the monsoon trough of low pressure. Over the next two days the depression gradually developed further, before it was named Gavin by RSMC Nadi early on March 4 as it had developed into a tropical cyclone. Meteorological history During March 2, 1997, the Fiji Meteorological Service reported that a slow moving tropical depression had developed within the monsoon trough to the northwest of the Fijian dependency of Rotuma. Over the next two days, the depression gradually developed further as it moved slowly towards the east ‚Äî southeast, before the JTWC reported at 0600 UTC on March 3, that the system had become equivalent to a tropical storm and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 31P. Throughout that day Gavin intensified further before RSMC Nadi reported early on March 4, that the depression had become a category one tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and named it Gavin. After being named Gavin moved eastwards towards the southern Tuvaluan Islands and intensified quickly, with the JTWC reporting later that day that the system had become equivalent to a category 1 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale (SSHS). Early on March 5, RSMC Nadi reported that Gavin had become a category 3 severe tropical cyclone after the system had developed an eye. During that day two troughs of low pressure combined to steer the system to the southeast as it passed about to the southwest of Niulakita, Tuvalu with estimated 10-minute sustained wind speeds of about 155 km/h (100 mph). After Gavin had intensified throughout that day, RSMC Nadi reported at 1800 UTC, that the system had become a category 4 severe tropical cyclone, while the JTWC reported that the cyclone had reached its initial peak intensity with 1-minute sustained winds of 215 km/h (130 mph), which made it equivalent to a category 4 hurricane on the SSHWS. Early on March 6, RSMC Nadi reported that Gavin was moving towards Fiji and had reached its peak intensity as a category 4 severe tropical cyclone, with 10-minute sustained winds of 185 km/h (115 mph). Later that day the system passed about to the west of the French territory of Futuna, before it started to weaken as it passed about to the northwest of Labasa on the Fijian Island of Vanua Levu. Preparations and impact Severe Tropical Cyclone Gavin was responsible for at least 18 deaths as it affected Fiji and parts of Polynesia, before it was retired from the tropical cyclone naming lists. =Tuvalu= Gavin was the first of three tropical cyclones to affect Tuvalu during the 1996-97 cyclone season, with Cyclones Hina and Keli affecting the islands later in the season. Ahead of the system affecting the Polynesian island nation, hurricane warnings were issued for Niulakita and Nukulaelae, while gale or storm warnings were issued for the rest of Tuvalu. During the next day these warnings were gradually revised once it became clearer that Gavin was moving towards the southeast and away from the island nation, before all warnings were cancelled by 0600 UTC on March 6. After both Gavin and Hina had affected the island nation within a week off each other, a damage assessment team noted that it was difficult to assess damage done by Gavin alone and estimated the total damage from both cyclones at , (). Both cyclones caused severe coastal erosion and destruction to food crops, on the southern islands of Niulakita and Nukulaelae, while damage in northern and central islands was confined mostly to houses. The cyclones waves, storm surge and strong winds both caused a severe amount of coastal erosion on all of the country's nine atolls, with about 6.7% of the land washed into the sea. It was later estimated after Keli had affected the islands between June 12‚Äì16, 1996, that collectively the three cyclones had been responsible for about of land disappearing into the sea. =Wallis and Futuna= Early on March 5, the FMS issued a tropical cyclone alert for the French Overseas Territory, as Gavin was moving slowly towards the east ‚Äî southeast and heading towards the islands. Later that day as Gavin turned and started to move southwards the FMSupgraded the alert to a gale warning for Futuna, but due to the turn to the south it was felt that a warning for Wallis Island wasn't needed. The alert for Wallis was subsequently cancelled early the next day while the Gale Warning was maintained for Futuna, as that island was still expected to be within the extent of gale-force winds during that day. The gale warning for Futuna was cancelled later that day, after Gavin had moved well to the southwest of the island and moving further away. Most of the damage on the French territory was confined to the exposed northeast coastal parts of Futuna, where a heavy swell caused sea flooding at high tide and several food crops were damaged by the wind. This heavy swell resulted in some roads and public networks, being partially destroyed and some traditional houses being damaged. On Wallis Island, only a small amount of damage was reported, with some traditional houses and food crops flooded on the north coast by seawater at high tide. =Fiji= During March 4, the FMSissued a tropical cyclone alert for Rotuma, as it was possible that Gavin could produce gale-force winds or pass over the island within 48 hours. However the alert was cancelled during the next day, after the cyclone had passed about to the northeast of the island and was no longer expected to produce any damage or gale-force winds on the island. As they cancelled the alert for Rotuma, the FMSissued an alert for Fiji as it was apparent that Gavin was moving southwards towards the archipelago, before they started to issue various gale and storm warnings for Fiji during March 6. Over the next two days, the FMSissued various gale, storm and hurricane warnings for Fiji, as the system passed through the archipelago, before all warnings for Fiji were cancelled during March 8, after it had become apparent that gales were no longer affecting any part of Fiji. Cyclone Gavin was the most destructive cyclone to affect Fiji since Cyclone Kina and became the most intense tropical cyclone on record to affect Fiji, after the meteorological station on Yasawa recorded a minimum pressure of . Heavy rain associated with Gavin caused serious flooding in Labasa and western parts of Viti Levu and caused serious flooding of the Nadi and Ba rivers. Major destruction of sugar cane and other food crops also occurred while at least 18 deaths were attributed to Gavin. This included 10 people lost at sea when a fishing vessel, the Wasawasa I, sank, and another 8 deaths caused by landslides, electrocution, and drowning. The total damage bill was estimated at (, ). However, despite devastating several parts of Fiji, Gavins turn to the southwest just before it moved through the island nation spared Fijis two main populated islands of Vanua Levu and Viti Levu the full brunt of the cyclone. =New Zealand= After it moved out of the tropics, Gavin moved southwards and affected New Zealand between March 11‚Äì13 with high seas, heavy rain gale-force winds and wind gusts of up to 130 km/h (80 mph). As a result of the heavy rain, some flooding was reported in parts of the Northland, Waikato, Bay of Plenty and Gisborne, which led to road closures.

The recipients must have distinguished themselves at the risk of their own life above and beyond the call of duty in action against an enemy of the United States. Since the April 1975 end of American presence in Vietnam, the United States military has been involved in a number of conflicts and peacekeeping activities, including actions in the invasion of Grenada, Lebanese Civil War, invasion of Panama, the Yugoslav Wars, the Somali Civil War and elsewhere. Following the September 11 attacks, the United States entered into a War on Terror against militant Islamists, the War in Afghanistan and the Iraq War. The Medal of Honor has been awarded to 27 U.S. servicemen for actions since Vietnam, sixteen to living recipients. The first post-Vietnam Medal of Honor recipients were two Delta Force snipers, MSG Gary Gordon and SFC Randy Shughart, who volunteered to defend a downed helicopter pilot in the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu in Somalia; the medals were awarded posthumously. Recipients =Somali Civil War= The Battle of Mogadishu or for Somalis Ma-alinti Rangers (\\"The Day of the Rangers\\") was a battle that was part of Operation Gothic Serpent that was fought on October 3 and 4, 1993, in Mogadishu, Somalia, by forces of the United States supported by UNOSOM II against Somali militia fighters loyal to warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid. The battle is also referred to as the First Battle of Mogadishu to distinguish it from the Second Battle of Mogadishu in 2006. The Medals were awarded to two Delta Force operators, both snipers, who volunteered to attempt to save the pilot of one of the downed UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters, despite facing hundreds, possibly thousands of rebels around the crash site. {class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" width=\\"98%\\" !class=\\"unsortable\\"Image !

Some of his theories are no longer accepted today. Birth and education George Johnson was born on 29 November 1818 at Goudhurst, Kent, England. His father was a farmer and his mother was the daughter of an Edenbridge, Kent, timber merchant. He attended the local grammar school. In 1837 he was apprenticed to his uncle, a general practitioner at Cranbrook in Kent. In October 1839 he entered the medical school of King's College London. He was an outstanding scholar, winning many prizes and a senior medical scholarship. He won a Warneford prize in 1842 and graduated in 1843. Career After leaving college, Johnson served in King's College Hospital as house physician and then house surgeon. In 1850 he was made an honorary fellow of King's College. He became an assistant physician at the hospital in 1847 and physician in 1856. From 1857 to 1863 he was Professor of Materia medica (pharmacology) and from 1863 to 1876 he was Professor of Medicine. In 1862 Johnson was elected a member of the senate of the University of London. In 1865 he was appointed a consulting physician to the British Home and Hospital for Incurables, replacing Benjamin Guy Babington, who had resigned. In 1872 he was made a fellow of the Royal Society. In 1876 Johnson attempted to treat Charles Bravo, a British lawyer who was fatally poisoned with antimony in what became known as \\"the Murder at the Priory\\". The Lancet of August 1876 published his detailed account of the symptoms, treatment and progress of the illness. From 1876 to 1886 Johnson was Professor of Clinical Medicine at Kings. In 1883 he was appointed consulting physician to the Royal College of Music. He was a Censor at the Royal College of Physicians, and in 1887 was appointed Vice President of this institution. In 1889 Queen Victoria made him a Physician-Extraordinary. He was knighted in 1892. In 1850 Johnson married Charlotte Elizabeth, daughter of Lieutenant William White of Addington, Surrey. They had five children. Frank Holl painted his portrait in 1888. This picture is now held by the Royal College of Physicians of London. He died from cerebral hemorrhage at his home in Savile Row, London, on 3 June 1896. A memorial to him lies in St James's Church, Piccadilly. A memorial to George Johnson in St James's Church, Piccadilly. Work Johnson became recognized as an authority on cholera and on kidney diseases, and published several works on these subjects. He was one of the first physicians to use the laryngoscope and the ophthalmoscope. He reintroduced the picric acid test for albumen and the picric acid and potash test for sugar. He was a strong supporter of the views of Richard Bright on kidney disease, and discovered hypertrophy of the small arteries in Bright's disease. His \\"stop-cock\\" theory to explain this finding led to a controversy with Sir William Gull over the \\"hyaline-fibroid degeneration\\". Johnson was opposed to the astringent treatment of cholera. Instead he advocated the \\"evacuation treatment\\", to get rid of as many cholera bacteria as possible by purging the bowels. In 1832 William Brooke O'Shaughnessy had proposed saline injections as a way of restoring salts lost through the bowels, which today is considered a rational therapy. However, when Johnson reviewed results of this approach applied to 156 patients in 1832 he noted that only 25 had recovered. By 1848 the saline injection treatment was out of favor. Johnson thought that cholera was caused by a poison in the blood producing right-sided heart congestion. He saw the vomiting and diarrhea of cholera as the body's attempt to expel the poison. He agreed that the blood of cholera victims differed in appearance from normal blood, but did not accept that this could be caused by dehydration. He felt that death occurred because the poison prevented blood from circulating through the right side of the heart, thus cutting off blood from the lungs and causing a death similar to that caused by asphyxiation. He considered that bleeding could help in the cure.

Background At the onset of the Great Depression, the Parliament of Canada passed the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act, 1933 (\\"CCAA\\") in order to provide an alternative procedure other than liquidation that could be used by insolvent companies. Charles Cahan, Secretary of State of Canada, said at the bill's first reading, it was necessary ‚Äúbecause of the prevailing commercial and industrial depression.‚Äù The provinces of Quebec and Ontario disputed the constitutionality of the Act, as they believed it intruded into provincial jurisdiction with respect to property and civil rights. Accordingly, the federal government posed the following reference question to the Supreme Court of Canada: At the Supreme Court of Canada The Court unanimously ruled that the Act was intra vires the Parliament of Canada, as it dealt with matters falling within \\"bankruptcy and insolvency\\" under s. 91(21) of the British North America Act, 1867. =Majority ruling by Duff CJ= Legislation in respect of compositions and arrangements is a natural and ordinary component of a system of bankruptcy and insolvency law, and provisions similar to the CCAA had already been passed before and after Confederation. However, the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act, 1919 apply only when an assignment or receiving order has been issued, and the Winding-Up Act applies only in the case of a company which is in course of being wound up. The CCAA, on the other hand, creates powers which can be exercised in case, and only in case, of insolvency. Therefore, the Act enables arrangements to be made with respect to an insolvent company, under judicial authority which, otherwise, might not be valid prior to the initiation of proceedings in bankruptcy. As Lord Cave stated in Royal Bank of Canada v. Larue, ‚Äúthe exclusive legislative authority to deal with all matters within the domain of bankruptcy and insolvency is vested in Parliament.‚Äù =Concurring ruling by Cannon J= Before and since Confederation, arrangements with the creditors have always been of the very essence of any system of bankruptcy or insolvency legislation. Under current Canadian law and under the British Bankruptcy Act 1914, where a person is subject to bankruptcy proceedings, and if no composition or scheme of arrangement is approved, he will be declared bankrupt, and his property becomes divisible among his creditors and vests in a trustee. While CCAA proceedings are not bankruptcy proceedings, they are insolvency proceedings. As such, they are intended to prevent a declaration of bankruptcy, where it would be in the best interest of the creditors. Such an intent has been expressed in Canadian law since the pre-Confederation Insolvent Act of 1864. Cushing v. Dupuy and Royal Bank of Canada v Larue were stated as authority under which Parliament could pass the Act. Impact Many Canadian legal commentators at the time expected that the CCAA, together with 1934's Farmers' Creditors Arrangement Act, would be declared unconstitutional as encroaching upon the provincial power over property and civil rights in relation to the rights of secured creditors, and they were astonished when both were upheld. The Parliament of Canada would not further extend its reach over secured creditors until 1992's amendments to the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act. After being employed in the 1930s, the CCAA did not see significant usage again until the 1980s. The Supreme Court of Canada did not hear any appeals relating to the CCAA until Century Services Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General) in 2010.

This grouping was suggested by morphological synapomorphies, and confirmed by phylogenomic analyses of molecular data. Xenacoelomorphs emerged with the Nephrozoa as their sister clade.  Phylogenetics  The clade Xenacoelomorpha, grouping Acoelomorpha and the genus Xenoturbella, was revealed by molecular studies. Initially it was considered to be a member of the deuterostomes, but a more recent transcriptome analysis concluded that it is the sister group to the Nephrozoa, which includes the protostomes and the deuterostomes, being therefore the basalmost bilaterian clade.  Characteristics  All xenacoelomorphs lack a typical stomatogastric system, i.e., they do not have a true gut. In acoels, the mouth opens directly into a large endodermal syncytium, while in nemertodermatids and xenoturbellids there is a sack-like gut lined by unciliated cells. The nervous system is basiepidermal, i.e., located right under the epidermis, and a brain is absent. In xenoturbellids it is constituted by a simple nerve net without any special concentration of neurons, while in acoelomorphs it is arranged in a series of longitudinal bundles united in the anterior region by a ring comissure of variable complexity. The sensory organs include a statocyst and, in some groups, two unicellular ocelli. The epidermis of all xenacoelomorphans is ciliated. The cilia are composed of a set of 9 pairs of peripheral microtubules and one or two central microtubules (patterns 9+1 and 9+2, respectively). The pairs 4‚Äì7 terminate before the tip, creating a structure called a \\"shelf\\".

During his X Games career, Moore claimed four medals. His younger brother Colten Moore is also a competitive snowmobiler and quad freestyle motocross rider. Personal life Caleb Moore was born in 1987 in Ft. Worth, Texas. His parents are Wade and Michele Moore. Caleb is described as having been an adrenaline junkie, someone who was not afraid to take risks, and someone that truly loved what he did. He was family oriented, outgoing, personable, and made friends everywhere he went. He graduated from high school early so that he could continue ATV racing on the national circuit. The number 31 was his personal riding number that he chose for himself as a kid when he first got into ATV racing. Career Caleb Moore began his career as an ATV racer. During an event in Minnesota, B. C. Vaught spotted Moore and signed him up to star in some action sports movies. Vaught eventually became Caleb's agent. Caleb appeared in several Huevos freestyle movies by H-Bomb Films, he also toured with the Crusty Demons of the Dirt tour, as well as performed in XKnights FMX shows. He traveled around the world performing freestyle motocross tricks on his quad and was one of the very few people in the world who could consistently backflip a quad. When Caleb decided to switch from ATV's to snowmobiles, he asked his mom and dad to back him as he learned how to do a backflip. Caleb mastered the maneuver in two weeks. Despite being raised in Krum, Texas, Moore practiced by landing his sled in a foam pit built by his father. Moore's first professional competition as a freestyle snowmobile racer was at the 2010 Winter X Games in Aspen, Colorado. With just one month of practice, Caleb earned a bronze medal in the Freestyle division, while finishing sixth in Best Trick. The next year, Moore earned bronze (Freestyle) and silver (Best Trick) at the 2011 Winter X Games. In 2012, Caleb repeated the bronze at the Winter X Games Freestyle Snowmobile, while his brother, Colten, took the gold. His performance led ESPN to write on his profile that he had \\"gone from beginner's luck to serious threat\\".https://www.denverpost.com/2013/01/31/winter-x-games-snowmobiler-dies- after-colo-crash-2/ =Injury and death= Caleb was injured on January 24, 2013, during the Snowmobile Freestyle part of Winter X Games XVII, which was held in Aspen, Colorado. He was attempting a backflip (a trick he had done several times before) when the skis on his snowmobile were snagged on the ground as he was about to land. As a result, Caleb was flipped over the handlebars and upon landing, was hit by the snowmobile. His brother Colten was also injured on the same day, sustaining a separated pelvis. Caleb was able to leave the scene under his own strength and he was taken to Aspen Valley Hospital to be treated for concussion. Doctors there discovered bleeding around the heart, and he was diagnosed with a heart contusion. He was airlifted to St. Mary's Hospital in Grand Junction, Colorado, to undergo heart surgery. While he was being transported, Caleb suffered a period of cardiopulmonary arrest due to presumed unrelieved pericardial tamponade. The lack of oxygen to his brain during this time of hypotension caused anoxic encephalopathy. The fact that a brain complication had occurred was announced by a family spokesman in the days after the accident. Caleb remained unconscious after arrival at St. Mary's Hospital, and his condition did not improve over the next several days. He was pronounced dead at 9:30 AM on January 31. His family invited the public to observe a moment of silence on February 7, 2013, one week after Moore's death. ESPN presented Caleb's family with an X-Games gold medal at his funeral to go along with the medals that he had previously won. Friends, family, and fans of Caleb continue his legacy and show support for him and his family by using the hashtags #RideforCaleb and #31Style on their posts in social media as well as put \\"In Memory of Caleb Moore\\" decals on their ATVs, dirt bikes, snowmobiles, or personal vehicles. Caleb's younger brother Colten Moore and author Keith O'Brien wrote a book called Catching the Sky which was released January 19, 2016. The book talks about Caleb's life, the road to X-Games, and ultimately his death. It gives insight into the world of extreme sports and was at one time listed as the number one best selling book in the extreme sports category on Amazon.

More than seventy were built. Design The Spijker V.2 was a conventionally laid out single engine tractor biplane. Its wings had constant chord and no sweep or stagger. It was a two bay biplane, with two pairs of parallel interplane struts on each side and two further pairs acting as a cabane between fuselage and the upper wing. Ailerons were fitted to both upper and lower wings. Over the fuselage was a semicircular cut out in the trailing edge of the upper wing to enhance the upward view from the rear seat. The tandem open cockpits were fitted with dual controls. The V.2 was powered by a 60 kW (80 hp) Thulin (Gn√¥me type) rotary engine, driving a two blade propeller and enclosed by a full 360¬∞ or 270¬∞ cowling. Its fuselage was built with wooden longerons and T-pieces. The conventional undercarriage was fixed, with mainwheels on a single axle supported at each end on V-form struts, cross braced. A tail skid completed the landing gear. Operational history Because of the war, in which the Netherlands remained neutral the European public did not see the V.2 until one of the first post-war air shows, the Eerste Luchtverkeer Tentoonstelling (First Air Traffic Exhibition) held in Amsterdam in August 1919. The V.2's ability to loop on a small engine was noted. Seventy-eight V.2s were built for the Dutch government. Fifty-eight of these were for the Army Aviation Group (LVA), eighteen for the Dutch Naval Aviation Service (MLD) and two for the KNIL. There were a significant number of fatal losses in both the LVA and MLD but the V.2s were flown by both services until 1924, when the MLD replaced their V.2s with Fokker S.3s; nine of their V.2s went to the LVA.

After opening his first architectural practice in Tampere with August Krook, he later partnered in Helsinki with Karl Lindahl (1900-05), the Udd brothers (1909-12) and finally with his own brother Ivar (born 1882); the two of them were among the most successful architects in Finland in the early 20th century, designing numerous public buildings, business and industrial buildings and private villas. In addition, Valter Thom√© collaborated with Bertel Jung and Sonck on what became an influential plan for the T√∂√∂l√∂- Hietaniemi section of Helsinki; he later drew up city plans for Kotka, Savonlinna, Lappeenranta, Kristinestad, Naantali and Jyv√§skyl√§.

The Four Gospels each record an account of the sign of the dove. (; ; ) And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon him. In Hebrew, Jonah (◊ô◊ï÷π◊†÷∏◊î) means dove. The \\"sign of Jonas\\" in is related to the \\"sign of the dove\\".  Symbolism of the dove  The Christian symbol of a dove with an olive branch in its beak represents love and peace and comes from Genesis 8:6-12 which reads: \\"And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made:...Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground; But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark. And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark; And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth. And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove; which returned not again unto him any more.\\" Doves were also used in ancient Israel as Korban, or religious sacrifice within the tabernacle and temples. \\"And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the Lord be of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young pigeons.\\" In the Ancient Near East and Mediterranean, doves were used as symbols for the Canaanite mother goddess Asherah, the Phoenician goddess Tanit, and the Roman goddesses Venus and Fortune. Additional biblical uses *: And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away, and be at rest. *: yet shall ye be as the wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold. *: O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock *: Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night. *: I did mourn as a dove: mine eyes fail with looking upward: O LORD, I am oppressed; undertake for me. *: O ye that dwell in Moab, leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, and be like the dove that maketh her nest in the sides of the hole's mouth. *: Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart In Mormonism The sign of the dove is recorded in the Book of Mormon: * : abide upon him in the form of a dove. * (): Holy Ghost descended upon him in the form of a dove. * Book of Abraham, Facsimile 2, Fig. 7 is a sign of the Holy Ghost in the form of a dove. Joseph Smith taught, \\"[t]he sign of the dove was instituted before the creation of the world, a witness for the Holy Ghost, and the devil cannot come in the sign of a dove. The Holy Ghost is a personage, and is in the form of a personage. It does not confine itself to the form of the dove, but in sign of the dove. The Holy Ghost cannot be transformed into a dove; but the sign of a dove was given to John who had baptized Jesus to signify the truth of the deed, as the dove is an emblem or token of truth and innocence.\\" See also *Christian symbolism: Dove References Category:Symbols of Abrahamic religions ","title":"Sign of the Dove"},{"id":"38386458","text":"Tyler John Anderson (born December 30, 1989) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the San Francisco Giants of Major League Baseball (MLB).

During the season, he suffered a stress fracture in his elbow, and the Rockies had him on a strict pitch limit in 2014. Pitching for the Tulsa Drillers in 2014, Anderson had a 7-4 record with a 2.08 ERA and 100 strikeouts in innings pitched (23 starts), and was named the Texas League Pitcher of the Year. He was added to the Rockies' 40-man roster on November 20, 2014. The stress fracture in Anderson's elbow prevented him from participating in spring training in 2015, and he also missed the rest of the season. He began 2016 with the Hartford Yard Goats and was promoted to the Albuquerque Isotopes in late May. On June 11, 2016, the Rockies called up Anderson and placed Jake McGee on the disabled list. Anderson made his MLB debut the following day. He spent the remainder of the season with the Rockies, going 5-6 with a 3.54 ERA in 19 starts. In 2017, Anderson's first full season in the major leagues, he was 6-6 with a 4.81 ERA in 17 games (15 starts). He missed the last three months of the season due to left knee inflammation that required arthroscopic surgery.Rockies injuries: Tyler Anderson headed for surgery, DJ LeMahieu departs game with groin injury - Purple Row In 2018 he was 7-9 with a 4.55 ERA in 32 starts in which he pitched 176 innings. He led the major leagues in stolen bases of third base allowed, with seven, while also leading the NL in home runs allowed, with 30. He began the 2019 season in the Rockies rotation but was quickly placed on the disabled list with knee inflammation. He came off the disabled list a week later and made five starts before being demoted to AAA. He was placed on the disabled list after the demotion due to continued knee discomfort. On June 11 he underwent major season-ending surgery for to correct a chondral defect (an area of damage to the cartilage that lines the end of the bones in the knee) in his left knee, which was expected to require a lengthy recovery time. In 2019 with the Rockies he was 0-3 with an 11.76 ERA in five starts covering innings in which he struck out 23 batters. =San Francisco Giants= On October 30, 2019, Anderson was claimed off waivers by the San Francisco Giants. On December 2, Anderson was non-tendered and became a free agent. The following day, on December 3, Anderson re-signed with the Giants on a one-year major league contract. The contract calls for a $1,775,000 salary plus $500,000 in possible roster bonuses and $350,000 in possible performance bonuses based on number of innings pitched.\\"Tyler Anderson's deal with San Francisco Giants laden with incentives\\" Anderson threw the first complete game of his career on August 22, 2020, in a 5‚Äì1 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks.

The League spurred the creation of college branches around the country and influenced the actions of other prominent groups such as National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). History The beginning of the CESL dates to the 1900 NAWSA convention in Washington, D.C. Maud Wood Park, a 29-year-old attendee and recent Radcliffe College alum, realized that she was the youngest delegate.Cooney, Robert P.J., Jr., ed. (2005) Winning the Vote: The Triumph of the American Woman Suffrage Movement. Santa Cruz, CA: American Graphic Press, p. 88-89. Concerned by the absence of younger members in NAWSA and the general lack of interest in suffrage among college women, Park decided to work toward recruiting a new generation to the campaign. She later commented in regard to this decision: > After hearing Miss Anthony speak I came to realize what her life had been, > the heroism of her service not for herself but for the sex, and so for the > whole human race. When I felt that, clearly I felt the obligation of service > for the cause for which Miss Anthony and her noble associates had sacrificed > so much and I promised myself then that I would try to make more women see > these things as I have seen them. College women should realize their debt to > the pioneers who have made our education and competence possible. They > should be made to feel the obligation of their opportunities and to > understand that one of the ways to pay that debt is to fight the battle for > suffrage now in the quarter of the field in which it is still unwon.College > Equal Suffrage League nationalize their organization, become part of > National American Woman Suffrage Association (1908) Retrieved January 24, > 2013 Together with Inez Haynes Irwin, another Radcliffe graduate and suffrage supporter, Park formed the Massachusetts CESL in Boston. Park toured colleges around the United States, talking to recent alumnae in hopes that they would then encourage younger university and high school students to join the movement. Park's tours eventually sparked the formation of new chapters in 30 states.Maud Wood Park Retrieved January 24, 2013 In 1906, inspired by the CESL's efforts and as a way to increase their public presence, NAWSA began actively recruiting college students by sponsoring \\"College Evenings\\" at their larger suffrage events.Documents Project: The Impact of the College Equal Suffrage League on the Oregon Votes for Women Victory in 1912 Retrieved January 24, 2013 In 1908, the various state chapters of the CESL joined to form the National College Equal Suffrage League and became an official branch of NAWSA. Bryn Mawr College President M. Carey Thomas served as the first president and Maud Wood Park as vice president. The NCESL continued to recruit people to the suffrage cause until 1917 when the organization disbanded. Many of the League's members continued to play major roles in helping to push the Nineteenth Amendment through Congress, campaigning on the federal level and later serving in organizations like the League of Women Voters, which formed in 1920.

Scheme for the Narasaka‚ÄìPrasad reduction The reaction proceeds through the 6-membered transition state shown below. Chelation by the boron agent favors hydride delivery from the top face because it leads directly to the more stable chair-like conformation of the product (F√ºrst-Plattner Rule). The intermolecular hydride delivery from NaBH4 therefore proceeds via an axial attack from the opposite face with respect to the existing alcohol. Transition state for the Narasaka‚ÄìPrasad reduction showing the reasons for the observed diastereoselectivity This reaction can be contrasted with the similar Evans‚ÄìSaksena reduction that employs a different boron reagent in order to achieve intramolecular hydride delivery from the same face of the alcohol, thus producing the anti-diol.

He debuted in the company-wide relaunch of Action Comics as part of The New 52.Action Comics (vol. 2) #1 (November 2011) Fictional characters biography =Origin= Vyndktvx was originally the court magician for the King-thing Brpxz, of the fifth dimension world of Zrfff, until Mxyzptlk came along. Mxy outshone the other in the king's eyes because Mxy could make the king laugh, which Vyndktvx was unable to do. When Mxy declared his love for the king's daughter, Vyndktvx was outraged and took three weapons - the nothingcoat, the imaginator and the multispear. Planning on killing Mxyzptlk, he instead killed the king, who was at the time trying on Mxy's hat. Mistaking the king's shadow for Mxy's, he struck, and in the process killed 331 worlds across time and space, as well as almost killing Earth and Krypton. That feedback hurt Vyndktvx enough to where he wanted revenge on Superman for this and then began to target Superman's life, hoping to just as well clear his name and blame the entire massacre on Mxy and take Zrfff as his own.Action Comics (vol. 2) #15 (February 2013) =Menacing Superman= Vyndktvx made a deal with Glen Glenmorgan, shortly before Superman shows up to crash Glenmorgan's party.

Once again Vyndktvx would appear while Superman is being tortured by Lex Luthor, posing as a scientist before Superman breaks free. Following this Vyndktvx is not seen for some time until the comic shifts to the adventures of the Superman of Earth-23, where he is shown to be the boss of Overcorp, a corporation in another parallel Earth. Here, Vyndktvx is responsible for the creation of the Beast of Superman, a terrible beast that hunts down its versions of Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen, and Clark Kent. The Superman of Earth-23 stops it, and nothing is seen from it again. Once again Vyndktvx pops up, this time as a bartender inside a hotel during The Collector of All Worlds attack, harassing Glenmorgan until he has a mental breakdown.Action Comics (vol. 2) #8 (June 2012) Vyndktvx then appears through a meeting with Nimrod, hiring him to hunt down Superman and subsequently making him a member of The Anti-Superman Army after he visits him in the hospital (Nimrod suffering injuries following his battle with Superman).

She explains that Vyndktvx was once a prisoner of the multicornered prison Zrfff, of which he escaped after Superman's parents died in Smallville. She says that he killed \\"The King-Thing Brpxz\\" and then says that he hates Superman, more than he could understand, which is why everything he's done was to hurt him. After this, Nyxly shows Superman several future visions of his encounters with Vyndktvx, including Superman traveling to Mars to save a group of astronauts from Metalek and The Multitude, a tool of Vyndktvx, and his encounter with Dr. Xa-Du. After this Nyxly is shot dead by Nimrod before she can save Superman with a wish given to her by Mxyzptlk.Action Comics (vol. 2) #14 (January 2013) At a time in the future, Vyndktvx is shown to be responsible for the creation of Kryptonite, having his army collect the engine of Superman's space ship.

Before he disappears, he shouts, \\"Give in!

Finally, he fights Superman and his allies in modern Metropolis, with every resource at his disposal. He invites humanity to share in a paradise, on the condition that they say 'no' when Superman begs them for help. In the havoc that ensues, he links Superman's mind to every being on earth, so that he can feel their suffering. Ultimately, however, Superman uses this connection, along with every person on earth, to force Vyndktvx into saying his name backwards. Vyndktvx is banished to the Fifth Dimension and locked in a prison for all eternity. Powers and abilities Vyndktvx has the inherent godlike reality-warping powers of all five-dimension imps.

High Top was one of the leading British two-year-olds of 1971 when his successes included a defeat of a strong field tin the Observer Gold Cup. After winning a trial race on his first appearance of 1972 he led from the start to beat the future Epsom Derby winner Roberto in the 2000 Guineas. His classic win was the first of seventeen British classic winners ridden by Willie Carson. High Top never won again but finished a close second in both the Sussex Stakes and the Prix Jacques Le Marois. At the end of the year he was retired to stud and became an extremely successful breeding stallion. Background High Top, described as \\"a most commanding individual\\", was a brown horse with a white star four white socks bred by Bob McCreery at the Moreton Paddox Stud in Warwickshire, England. He was from the third crop of foals sired by Derring-Do, a horse whose wins included the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes in 1965 and whose other offspring included the St Leger winner Peleid and the 2000 Guineas winner Roland Gardens. High Top's dam Camenae, won one minor race, but was a successful broodmare, producing several other winners including the Jersey Stakes winner Camden Town. As a descendant of the broodmare Gentlemen's Relish, Camenae came from the same branch of Thoroughbred family 11-a which also produced the German champion Acatenango and the Prix du Jockey Club and Irish Derby winner Old Vic. As a yearling, High Top was sent to the sales but failed to reach his reserve price. Shortly afterwards he was bought for 9,000 guineas by the Vienna-born industrialist Sir Jules Thorn. The colt was sent into training with Bernard Van Cutsem at his Stanley House stable at Newmarket, Suffolk. At the time, Van Cutsem was one of the most successful trainers in Britain, handling major winners including Park Top (King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes) and Karabas (Washington, D.C. International Stakes). Racing career =1971:two-year-old season= Racing as a two-year-old in 1972, High Top won three times from four races. After winning his debut, High Top ran in the Washington Singer Stakes at Newbury, where finished second to Yarsolav, a colt to whom he was conceding three pounds. On his final appearance of the season, the colt was sent to Doncaster Racecourse for the Group One Observer Gold Cup and started at odds of 11/2. Ridden by the Scottish jockey Willie Carson he won by three quarters of a length from Steel Pulse, a colt which went on to win the following year's Irish Derby. The unplaced horses included Boucher and Rheingold. High Top's win at Doncaster was the culmination of an outstanding season for Van Cutsem's two-year-old colts: he had won the Dewhurst Stakes with Crowned Prince and the Middle Park Stakes with Sharpen Up. In the Free Handicap, a rating of the year's best British two-year-olds, Crowned Prince was given top weight of 133 pounds, with High Top level with Yaroslav in second place with 131. =1972:three-year-old season= On his three-year-old debut, High Top was sent to Yorkshire to contest the Classic Trial at Thirsk Racecourse. he led from the start and won by five lengths from My Brief, with the leading filly Waterloo two lengths further back in third. With both Crowned Prince and Sharpen Up failing in their respective trials, High Top was Van Cutsem's sole representative in the 2000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket on 29 April. With Carson again in the saddle, he started the 85/40 favourite against eleven opponents, his form having been boosted by the success of Waterloo in the 1000 Guineas two days earlier. High Top led from the start and went well clear approaching the final furlong. In the closing stages the Irish-trained colt Roberto emerged as a challenger, but the favourite was driven out by Carson to win by half a length, with a gap of six lengths back to Sun Prince in third. The colt's success was a first classic win for both Carson and Van Cutsem. High Top was strongly fancied to follow up in the Irish 2,000 Guineas but finished unplaced behind Ballymore and returned to Newmarket a sick horse. It was more than two months before he ran again. When High Top returned in the summer he showed good form without winning. At Goodwood in July he was beaten a head by Sallust, who set a new course record, in the Sussex Stakes. He was then sent to France for the Prix Jacques Le Marois at Deauville in August. He led in the closing stages but was caught on the line by the French colt Lyphard. On his final appearance he finished fourth behind Sallust, Lyphard and Daring Display in the Prix du Moulin at Longchamp. Assessment The independent Timeform awarded High Top a peak rating of 131 in 1971. In their book A Century of Champions, based on a modified version of the Timeform system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated High Top an \\"average\\" winner of the 2000 Guineas. Stud record High Top was retired to stud where he proved to be a highly successful sire of winners. Despite the fact that High Top never raced beyond a mile, many of his best offspring excelled over long distances: they included the British Classic winners Cut Above and Circus Plume as well as the Irish Oaks winner Colorspin, the Derby Italiano winner My Top and the Prix du Jockey Club winner Top Ville. He was also the damsire of Opera House, Kayf Tara, Roseate Tern, In the Groove and Classic Cliche. In 1993, largely thanks to the successes of Opera House, High Top was the Leading broodmare sire in Great Britain and Ireland. In early 1988 High Top was standing at the Woodland Stud at Newmarket when he began to suffer from thrombosis in his hind legs. After showing signs of recovery he had a relapse and was euthanised on veterinary advice on 9 March.

In zoology, this commonly refers to the killing and in some cases consumption of newborn animals by either a parent or an unrelated adult of the species. In carnivores, it is not uncommon for an unrelated male to commit infanticide to make females sexually receptive. Parental infanticide is sometimes a result of extreme stress by human intrusion.  Parental infanticide  The giant otter becomes extremely sensitive to human activity when rearing its young. Giant otters in captivity must be given privacy when raising their litters as cases of parental infanticide have been reported in the species, potentially caused by human visual and acoustic interference. Though not confirmed, it has been suspected that similar occurrences happen in the wild due to tourists. In the wild, polar bear mothers will sometimes kill their young because they lack adequate food, but in captivity the main reason is stress.  Nonparental infanticide  Lion cubs are frequent victims of nonparental infanticide by usurping males. In many instances of nonparental infanticide in carnivores, the male of a species kills the young of a female to make her sexually receptive, e.g. brown bears. When one or two new male lions defeat and exile the previous males of a pride, the conqueror(s) will often kill any existing young cubs fathered by the losers. As many as 80% of lion cubs die before they reach the age of two. Often a lioness tries to defend her cubs against this kind of behavior from the usurping male(s), but success is more common when a group of females join together to defend their offspring. Within five months of a tigress giving birth, she may become receptive again if her first litter is lost, and for this reason wandering males may commit infanticide.Novak, R. M. 1999. Walker's Mammals of the World. 6th edition. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore. In fear of infanticide, female jaguars will not tolerate the presence of any male, even the father of the litter, once she gives birth to her cubs. If the father of a leopard's litter is present for the rearing of the cubs, there are fewer instances of infanticide as foreign males stay farther away from the cubs. Groups of banded mongooses have been observed kidnapping and/or killing the members of other groups for no confirmed reason, though many theories have been suggested.  Species known to commit infanticide  * African wild dogCreel, Scott, and Nancy Marusha Creel. \\"Six ecological factors that may limit African wild dogs, Lycaon pictus.\\" Animal Conservation 1.1 (1998): 1-9. * Banded mongoose * Brown bear * Brown hyena * Dwarf mongoose * Domestic cat * Eurasian otter * Giant otter * Gray wolf * Golden jackal * Jaguar * Leopard * Lion * Meerkat * Orca (killer whale) * Polar bear * Spotted hyena * Tiger  Exceptions  reproductive behavior of female cheetahs, males are unlikely to commit infanticide. Unlike other African felids, no infanticidal behavior has been observed in the cheetah. Scientists hypothesize that this is because many cheetah litters have cubs from different fathers and males would not want to kill any cubs in case they killed their own. The promiscuity of female cheetahs helps to protect the threatened species not only by preventing infanticide but also by bringing greater genetic diversity. This genetic diversity averts inbreeding from occurring and widens the genetic pool of the species. Nevertheless, cheetah cubs have a remarkably high mortality rate.

(Dick) Clark, A History of Buckingham High School, Gatineau: Western Qu√©bec School Board Archives, 2013. The monograph is also available from the Ottawa Public Library (Ottawa Room). BHS was built in 1947 on nine acres of land donated by the Albert MacLaren Estate. The school would officially open on November 7, 1947 and enrolled 230 students its first year. BHS was administered by the Papineau Protestant Central School Board. The school would graduate more than 300 students over its 21-year history. When BHS opened, it was considered to be as modern as any school in Quebec. It boasted spacious classrooms, administrative offices, a nurse's room, an auditorium, a library, a music room, a laboratory for chemistry and physics classes, an industrial arts workshop, a home economics room, and separate girls' and boys' play rooms. The school auditorium was unusually well appointed. It included a balcony and a professionally equipped stage, complete with drop curtains, overhead lighting, and sunken footlights. The school's colors were blue and white and the school team was named \\"The Larks\\". To accommodate growth in the student population, BHS underwent two expansions. In 1962, three classrooms and lunchroom were added. In 1964, three more classrooms were added. Buckingham High School offered Grades 1 to Grade 11 (junior matriculation) and drew its students from a wide area. Originally, students came from Buckingham and Masson (Masson-Angers, Quebec) as well as from farms and rural homes east and west of the Li√®vre (Du Li√®vre River) River (The Inlet, Long Lake, Mayo, (Mayo, Quebec), Silver Creek, Glen Almond, Donaldson Lake, etc.). Over the years the school would grow into a regional education center. By the early 1960s students from Thurso, Quebec and Montebello, Quebec were being bussed to BHS for Grades 10 and 11. The school also included students from small communities like Poltimore, Namur, Quebec, Val-des-Bois, Quebec, and Notre-Dame-du-Laus, Quebec. Enrollment would peak at about 400 students. Typically there were about 120 high school students at BHS, including 10 to 20 students in the graduating class. Buckingham High School had three long term Principals ‚Äì J.C. (Clifford) Moore, the school's founding Principal (1947 ‚Äì 1957), K.J. (Keith) Dowd (1958 ‚Äì 1962), and C.A. (Clyde) MacTavish (1964 ‚Äì 1967). Moore is credited with creating an educational culture that made BHS a well rounded and enjoyable school to attend. Dowd's achievements include the coining of the school's motto (No Reward Without Work) and establishing an academic regime that let the school cope successfully with the prevailing departmental examinations. (As someone who attended the school when the school's motto was coined, my clear recollection is that we had a competition to decide what the motto would be and Mr. Dowd made the choice. The motto was coined by James Belisle.) MacTavish is remembered for solving the discipline challenge that BHS faced in a manner that let the school become a civil place to teach and learn. In the late 1940s and early 1950s Buckingham High School established a modus operandi that would prove surprisingly constant during its 21-year history. School days at BHS were bracketed by school bus arrivals and departures. Buses arrived at 8:45 and classes began at 9:00 (the line up bell sounded at 8:50). School was dismissed at 3:45 and buses left the school at 4:00. In the winter it was not unusual for rural students to have to ski to bus stops. No matter what the weather might be, school buses almost always ran. The school had very few \\"snow days\\". The curriculum at Buckingham High School was collegiate in nature. Course offerings were limited ‚Äì mathematics (algebra, geometry & trigonometry), English, French, science (physics & chemistry), as well as history and geography. Latin was offered in the 1950s but this course was dropped due to insufficient enrolment. There were no optional courses beyond high school industrial arts for the boys and home economics for the girls. In the early sixties two additional courses were added to the school program for graduating Grade 11 students ‚Äì North American Literature and a Grade 12 mathematics course, Intermediate Algebra. Students at BHS faced standardized provincial Departmental examinations in Grade 7 and in Grades 10 and 11. The Grade 7 and Grade 10 exams were set provincially but were marked by the high school's teachers using provincially supplied marking keys. The Grade 11 exams were set and marked in Quebec City. In 1968, Buckingham High School was closed and students attending the high school were transferred to Philemon Wright High School in the Hull section of Gatineau, Quebec. Today the old Buckingham High School building is still in use. The school is now called Buckingham Elementary School. It serves English elementary school students from Pre- Kindergarten (4 year olds) to Cycle 3, Year 2 students (formerly known as Grade 6) and is administered by the Western Qu√©bec School Board.

The book is made up of the experiences of over 100 feminists in Canada from the 1960s through the 1990s.Judy Rebick, Ten Thousand Roses, Penguin Books, 2005, accessed 31 January 2013. Book analysis Ten Thousand Roses is structured chronically along the latest four decades of intense feminist activity in Canada, from the 1960s through the 1990s. For each decade in Rebick's book, she begins by contextualizing the movement within the broader social, political and economic climate of the time, looking particularly at the North American Context. Rebick also includes brief references to other social justice movements of the time (such as the anti-Vietnam war movement in the 1960s and 70s) and how feminism interacted with them. Each chapter focuses on a specific sector (such as the Quebec women's movement or Aboriginal women's struggles), issue (such as male violence against women or childcare) or mass action (such as the Abortion Caravan). Out of the twenty chapters, a third of the book is dedicated to issues such as violence against women, abortion, childcare, equality in the workplace, wages, and so on. These issues are discussed to show how major material issues that are still problematic affect women. Many chapters are devoted to single issues, such as the chapter by Kara Gillies about \\"trafficking\\". Others have multiple issues that are confronted from political standpoints to disabilities and physical characteristics that women possess. Reception Critical reception for Ten Thousand Roses has been generally positive. Sherrill Cheda of the journal Canadian Woman Studies praised the novel for perfectly describing the feminist movement in Canada while paralleling other major social changes occurring during the time period. Cheda stated ‚ÄúThis book belongs in every Canadian library, whether high school, college or university, as an important part of our history, witnessed by those who lived it.‚Äù Another reviewer praised the book for its easy-to-read format, and its impact on the feminist movement, stating ‚ÄúTen Thousand Roses shows the scars as well as the stars‚Äîand both are the embodiment of our movement.‚Äù Some critics do offer negative criticism. For instance, although one reviewer praises the book for its impact on tracing Canadian feminism, there is a clear bias towards the National Action Committee on the Status of Women, failing to mention other feminist organizations. As the review states, ‚ÄúRebick‚Äôs book may be faulted for being too ‚ÄòNACcentric.‚Äô Many women in Canada ‚Äî the underrated silent majority ‚Äî support feminist goals without necessarily joining organizations. Many activists who were members of women's organizations, including NAC, nonetheless chose not to participate in NAC conferences.‚Äù References ;Sources * Category:2005 non-fiction books Category:Books about feminism Category:Feminist books ","title":"Ten Thousand Roses"},{"id":"38386933","text":"Diana Saqeb is a documentary film maker and women rights activist.

The 2nd Georgia General Assembly followed two years later. It took place sometime in January, in Savannah, which was the capital of Georgia at the time. The capital was moved to its present location, Atlanta, in 1868. The Assembly has been held once every two years starting in 1777. The Assembly elected the Georgia House of Representatives and Georgia Senate.  Overview  = House of Representatives = The House of Representatives is the larger of the two chambers. Its 180 members represent districts from across the state, and it is presided over by the Speaker of the House, who is elected by the entire membership.  Speaker of the House  The Speaker has always been a member of the majority political party and has the power to schedule debates, to vote, and to assign members to committees. = Senators = The state senate is very similar to the house, but the senate is a smaller body, with fifty-six members who represent districts from around the state.  Lieutenant Governor  The chief officer of the senate is the lieutenant governor. Unlike the Speaker, who is elected by the members of the house, the lieutenant governor is elected by all the voters of the state. The first Lieutenant Governor was Melvin E. Thompson, elected in 1947. Before that, the position never existed in Georgia. = Governor = Archibald Bulloch, elected on April 15, 1776, was the first official Governor of Georgia. Technically, William Ewen, George Walton, and William Ewen were governor before, but Bulloch was the first after the signing of the United States Declaration of Independence. His term ended on March 4, 1777.  Terms  At that time terms were uncertain and the governors picked how long their terms would be. It wasn't until May, 1777 where the people finally decided to make governor terms one year. This was because The people were afraid of too much government control based on past governors' loyalty to Great Britain, and gave the legislature the most power, severely limiting the governor's power and time. Also at this time the governors could only have one term, they could not go for reelection. In 1789 it was changed to two year terms. Eventually the terms became four years and that stuck, because now every Governor and President have four year terms.  Consecutive terms  Consecutive terms were not allowed for 10 years. In 1789 terms were one year. Not exactly though. Before 1789 term lengths were picked by the governor, mostly they were two, three months long. Terms after 1789 were one year long but weren't classified as \\"terms\\". The first actual term was in 1857 when Joseph E. Brown served terms from November 6, 1857, to June 17, 1865. That was the first consecutive term, but consecutive terms were allowed since 1789, it's just no one wanted to do it! From 1941 to 1977 consecutive were not allowed, after 1977 consecutive terms were re-allowed.

Together, they are co-founders of the Invencia Piano Duo.Jean-Pierre Thiollet, 88 notes pour piano solo, ¬´ Solo de duo ¬ª, Neva Editions, 2015, p.98. = Work on B√©la Bart√≥k = Beginning in 1994 and in conjunction with Peter Bart√≥k and Nelson Dellamaggiore, Kasparov began research into editing projects concerning B√©la Bart√≥k's Piano Concerto No. 3 and his Viola Concerto. Bart√≥k's health grew steadily worse as he worked to complete his Third Piano Concerto, and his rapid decline eventually forced him to concede admittance to a hospital. Consequently, the last seventeen measures of the score were left in rough sketch. Before entering the hospital, however, he gave explicit instructions to his son, Peter, to insert seventeen bar-lines and a double-bar at the end; in his haste to finish the work, B√©la had noted the precise ending in his native Hungarian. Bart√≥k never returned to oversee the Piano Concerto's completion, having succumbed to leukemia on 26 September 1945. Final orchestration was eventually executed from the composer's notes by his friend, Tibor Serly. The Third Piano Concerto was later published in an edition by Serly and Erwin Stein, an editor for Boosey & Hawkes. The original manuscript, along with numerous others, then became the subject of a protracted legal dispute between a trustee of Bart√≥k's estate, Peter, and B√©la's second wife, Ditta P√°sztory-Bart√≥k. The trustee asserted the composer had lost title to his own work in his lifetime, a claim disputed by Peter Bart√≥k. The same trustee also denied Ditta's right to any income from music sales, so long as ownership remained in contest. Throughout the forty subsequent years of legal battles, all of the original manuscripts remained inaccessible. Only with the deaths of both the trustee and Ditta was Peter able to regain full possession of his father's documents and begin the long-overdue process of editing them. It was at this time the Viola Concerto, presumed lost, was rediscovered, amongst the possessions of the deceased trustee.Somfai, L√°szl√≥. B√©la Bart√≥k: Composition, Concepts, and Autograph Sources. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1996.Kasparov, Andrey. ‚ÄúThird Piano Concerto in the Revised 1994 Edition: Newly Discovered Corrections by the Composer.‚Äù Hungarian Music Quarterly 11, Nos. 3-4 (2000): 2-11. Peter Bart√≥k's intent, in association with Nelson Dellamaggiore, was to reprint and revise past editions of both scores, as well as to eradicate the many printed errors identified but never corrected by his father. Although few in actual number, changes made to the Piano Concerto affected the pitch content, pedalling, and tempos of several key passages. Overall, the revisions included including pencil markings by the composer in the final manuscript, not reproduced in the final photo- reproduction; adding revisions based on initial sketches by B√©la Bart√≥k; incorporating suggestions by editors and musicians involved in past performances of the Concerto; correcting typographical errors; and correcting errors in the printed piano part, appearing only in the two-piano reduction of the score. In 1994, Kasparov was soloist with the Columbus Indiana Philharmonic (formerly Columbus Pro Musica) in the world premiere of the revised edition of B√©la Bart√≥k's Piano Concerto No. 3. According to conductor David Bowden, and Peter Bart√≥k, who was in attendance: ::\\"These changes generally make the piano part more accessible or clarify questions of chordal structure....\\"Sluder, Claude K. \\"Revised Bartok composition highlights Pro Musica concert.\\" The Republic 16 February 1994. The revised editions of both the two-piano reduction and the orchestral score of the Piano Concerto No. 3 are available from Boosey & Hawkes. = Hommages Musicaux = In 1920, in tribute to the late Claude Debussy, the French music journal La Revue musicale commissioned works by contemporary composers and concert artists. The collection was published under the title Tombeau de Claude Debussy, with contributions from Paul Dukas, Albert Roussel, Gian Francesco Malipiero, Eugene Goossens, B√©la Bart√≥k, Florent Schmitt, Igor Stravinsky, Maurice Ravel, Manuel de Falla, and Erik Satie. Encouraged by the success of this premiere collaboration, editor Henry Pruni√®res proposed a second dedicatory work. Published in 1922, seven of Gabriel Faur√©'s students laboured to produce Hommage √† Gabriel Faur√©. Ravel offered a work for solo violin; Charles Koechlin and Jean Roger-Ducasse composed four hands pieces for the piano; George Enescu, Louis Aubert, Florent Schmitt, and Paul Ladmirault each contributed pieces for solo piano.Harrington, James. \\"Hommages Musicaux.\\" American Record Guide 71.1 (2008): 200. Released in 2007 by Albany Records, with violinists Desiree Ruhstrat and Pavel Ilyashov, cellist David Cunliffe, guitarist Timothy Olbrych, and mezzo-soprano Lisa Relaford Coston, the Invencia Piano Duo (Andrey Kasparov and Oksana Lutsyshyn) produced Hommages Musicaux, which contained both Tombeau de Claude Debussy and Hommage √† Gabriel Faur√©. = Work on Florent Schmitt = In the mid 1990s, during production of Hommages Musicaux, the Invencia Piano Duo was introduced to the catalogue of composer Florent Schmitt. Intended as a tribute to Claude Debussy and Gabriel Faur√©, the recording featured Tombeau de Claude Debussy and Hommage √† Gabriel Faur√©. Within each of these cycles was contained one of Schmitt's works for piano. Kasparov and Lutsyshyn were: ::‚Äú...captivated by the richness of Schmitt‚Äôs multi-layered harmonies and textures, as well as the vitality of the rhythmic structures in the music.‚Äù Kasparov's dedication to Florent Schmitt's duo-piano music, in collaboration with Oksana Lutsyshyn, culminated in the release of four CDs by Naxos Records as part of its Grand Piano series.Harrington, James. \\"Schmitt: Crepuscules; Ombres; Enfants; Et Pan, au Fond des Bles Lunaires s'accouda.\\" American Record Guide 77.5 (2014): 156. Issued in 2012, Volume 1 contained Schmitt's Trois rapsodies, Op. 53, and the first-ever recording of Schmitt's Sept pi√®ces, Op. 15, composed in 1899. The album concluded with a previously unpublished work, Rhapsodie parisienne. Composed in 1900, it is one of two unpublished duets by Schmitt. According to Kasparov, pencil notations in the score indicated the composer intended it for later orchestration. Special permission to record Rhapsodie parisienne was granted by Mme. Annie Schmitt, granddaughter of Florent. The first volume was voted \\"Recording of the Month\\" and \\"Critics' Choice\\" by MusicWeb International and Naxos Records, respectively, in May 2013. It is unclear whether many of Schmitt's works for piano duet had ever received formal public performances in Europe, prior to the Invencia Piano Duo's revival of his compositions. A number appear to have been composed by Schmitt as piano √©tudes, particularly the two premiere recordings, Sur cinq notes, Op. 34 and Eight Easy Pieces, Op. 41, which were included on Volume 2. Kasparov has asserted that Schmitt experimented with a method of composition based on the first five notes of the diatonic scale, an approach later adopted by the likes of Igor Stravinsky in both his Five Easy Pieces for piano duet, published in 1917, and his Les cinq doigts for solo piano, published in 1921. Volume 3 heralded the debut recordings of a six-movement work composed between 1895 and 1902, Musiques foraines, Op. 22, and the Marche du 163 R.I., Op. 48. Volume 4 featured yet another of Schmitt's compositions derived from the five set notes of the primo part, Trois pi√®ces r√©cr√©atives, Op. 37. The same album contained the first- ever issue of the Lied et Scherzo, Op. 54, in Schmitt's version for piano four-hands, played on two pianos; composed in 1910 for double woodwind quintet; alternate editions of this piece were also prepared by the composer for horn and piano, as well as cello and piano. As of November 2016, it was announced all four volumes would be made available in a box set on the Grand Piano label of Naxos Records, with a scheduled release in January 2017. = Work on Paul Bowles = Paul Bowles was an American expatriate composer, author, and translator. His musical studies began with Aaron Copland. Subsequently, he pursued further instruction with Virgil Thomson.Thomson, Virgil. Virgil Thomson. New York: Alfred A.

Only in the decade before his death was there a revival of interest in Bowles' music. In 2016 the Invencia Piano Duo, once more in partnership with Naxos Records, released two CDs of Bowles' complete works for piano. Volume one begins with works influenced by Latin American themes, grounded in the composer's affinity for the culture and his fluency in the Spanish language.Bowles, Paul. \\"On Mexico's Popular Music.\\" Modern Music 18.4 (1941): 225-230.Lerner, Bennett.

Elected to the Colorado Senate in 2012, he currently represents Senate District 35 which encompasses parts of Pueblo County, and all of Alamosa County, Baca County, Bent County, Conejos County, Costilla County, Crowley County, Custer County, Huerfano County, Kiowa County, Las Animas County, Mineral County, Otero County, Prowers County, Rio Grande County, and Saguache County. Biography and early career Crowder was raised in Manzanola near La Junta, Colorado. When he was 15 years old, his father was killed in an auto accident. His mother Fern, a housewife, was left to raise seven children on her own. Crowder graduated from Manzanola High School in 1966. He enlisted in the United States Army in 1968. He served his country in Vietnam and was honorably discharged in 1971 as a disabled American veteran. After discharge from the Army, Crowder married Cheri and the couple lived in Denver. The couple had two children: Patrick in 1974 and Dave in 1976. In 1976, the family moved to Alamosa, Colorado where Crowder bought a small farm and started a trenching and excavating company. The business contracted with the phone company to bury telephone lines in Southern Colorado. The advent of fiber optic technology in the late 1990s made the excavating company's services obsolete. In need of income, Crowder began working for the postal service. In 2008, he retired from the postal service and began working as the Veterans Service Officer for Rio Grande County in Colorado. In 2000 Crowder was elected as the Chairman of the South Central Workforce Board, a position that he held through 2010. Beginning in 2004, he was also elected to serve as the Alamosa County Land Use Board Chair, a position that he continues to serve.

He also worked to create jobs and preserve historic structures by sponsoring the Job Creation & Main Street Revitalization Act that brought $15 million in economic development to Southern Colorado. = 2015 Legislative Session = During the 2015 legislative session, Crowder sponsored legislation to expedite the licensing process to become an advanced practice nurse, to offer tax incentives to providers who bring broadband services to rural areas and to protect Colorado's drinking water, watersheds and ecologically sensitive areas. He was also named the 2015 Rural Health Champion by the Colorado Rural Health Center. = 2016 Legislative Session = In 2016, Crowder sponsored SB 74 aimed at expanding voting options for rural voters. =2018 Legislative Session= During the 2018 Legislative Session Senator Crowder focused attention of health care matters and veterans‚Äô issues.

He also ran Senate Bill 54 to put a cap on fee increases for assisted living facilities and Senate Bill 71 that allowed a task force to continue studying substance abuse issues. Senator Crowder also ran a bill that would have exempted used vehicles from the state sales and use tax.

We ask those who feel they have been victims of harassment or inappropriate behavior at the General Assembly to file an official complaint, in confidence that their anonymity and rights will be protected. Going forward, Senate Republican leaders cannot and will not be responding to unsubstantiated or anonymous allegations against members appearing in the press, which the existing complaint process is designed to handle. This process exists to protect confidentiality, respect the rights of both accuser and accused, rigorously review the facts, give a fair hearing to all sides, and impose penalties proportionate to any confirmed offense.\\"Colorado Senators Baumgardner And Tate Named In Allegations Of Sexual Harassment, KUNC, Bente Birkeland, November 16, 2017.

The company is renowned for its production of sujuk and pastirma. Apikoƒülu is the first company to mass-produce meat products in Turkey and serve the demand of its entire national market. Early years Krikor Apikoƒülu. Founder of the Apikoƒülu Company.(circa 1923) Apikoƒülu was founded in Kayseri in 1910 by ethnic Armenian Krikor Apikoƒülu (1878‚Äì1945). Apikoƒülu moved its base of operations to Istanbul in 1920, opening its production facility in a neighborhood of the Maltepe suburb called ƒ∞dealtepe. The company's headquarters occupied the lower level of the family's home, limiting their domicile to the upper levels. The brothers take charge As business expanded, the company eventually outgrew the Maltepe facility, subsequently moving its manufacturing operations to Alibeyk√∂y. The factory in Alibeyk√∂y was managed by brothers, Agop and Hayk Apikoƒülu. This is when the company began doing business as (dba) Apikoƒülu Brothers. Apikoƒülu Brothers was soon selling its products throughout Turkey. =Innovations= Efforts to meet the increasing national demand spawned an innovation Apikoƒülu Brothers was able to incorporate from the 1960s. Their patented system made it possible to produce marketable halal meats directly from the slaughterhouse. The technique had the cow dangling upside down so that when the cow was slaughtered, the blood could easily flow out of its body. The technique had never been practiced in the manufacturing of foodstuffs and the precedent quickly became standard practice throughout Turkey, and eventually the entire meat packing industry. In order to supply the increasing needs of national demand, Apikoƒülu Brothers increased its workforce to 200 people in 1987. They also purchased a modern facility in Tuzla. As of 2013, Apikoƒülu Brothers are continuing their manufacturing operations from the Tuzla facilities, with no indications that Tuzla operations will discontinue at any time in the near future. Legacy In the 2009 book: Markalarƒ±n √ñyk√ºs√º, (English translation: The History of Brands) Apikoƒülu is described as one of \\"the 304 most famous brands in the world\\". This designation preceded the Apikoƒülu Brothers celebration of 100 continuous years in operation on its 2010 anniversary. The Apikoglu Brothers were mentioned in Nobel Prize winning author Orhan Pamuk's book Istanbul: Memories of a City.

During the power outages many residents used propane and kerosene powered generators and heaters to combat the cold, with some resorting to moving charcoal grills indoors to heat their households. The increased usage of these heating methods, particularly grills led to a substantial number of cases of carbon monoxide poisoning. Varying reports allege 48 to 200 cases of poisoning.

Background  The siege occurred while the Mongols were pursuing Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu, the last ruler of the Khwarezmian Empire, and his newly raised forces in Afghanistan.Dictionary of Wars, by George C. Kohn, p.55.  Siege  Mutukan (M√∂'et√ºken), son of Chagatai Khan and favourite grandson of Genghis Khan, was killed in battle by an arrow from the besieged walls.Anwarul Haque Haqqi, Chingiz Khan: The Life and Legacy of an Empire Builder, (Primus Books, 2010), 152. This death, compounded by the heavy casualties sustained by his forces during the siege and the realization of his own mortality, angered Genghis to the extent that once he captured Bamyan he completely destroyed it and massacred the population of the city and its surrounding region. The destruction was so complete that even the Mongols referred to Bamyan as \\"the City of Sorrows\\" (i.e. \\"City of Woe\\"). Another title was \\"City of Noise (or Screams),\\" in reference to the cries of its murdered victims.  Aftermath  Following the siege, Genghis continued his pursuit of Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu into India. A common belief, also held among many Hazara, is that after the local Afghan population was wiped out, Genghis repopulated the area with some of his Mongol troops and their slave women, in order to guard the region while he continued his campaign. These settlers would become the ancestors of the Hazara people - with the word ‚ÄúHazara‚Äù most likely derived from the Persian word ‚Äúyak hazar‚Äù (‚Äúone thousand‚Äù), for the Mongol military unit of 1000 soldiers.Ratchnevsky, Paul.

Career Ahn was educated at the University of Southern California, graduating with a degree in art history in 2006, followed by two years of postgraduate study of photography at the Pratt Institute. While at the Pratt she began work on the Self-Portrait project. In 2009 and in 2010 she was awarded the Dean's Scholarship at Parsons The New School for Design, and in 2011 received both the Dean's and a departmental scholarship.

Self-Portrait depicts Ahn on or near the top of skyscrapers, often leaning from a window or seated on a ledge.

The project stemmed from a photograph of her feet she took while sitting on the edge of an apartment building while a student at Pratt, and has continued since. The bulk of the photographs are from New York and Seoul, with some from Hong Kong. For these photographs, Ahn works by gaining access to the building legitimately - it can take several months for the owners to give permission for the project - and setting a digital camera to take a large volume of high- speed images while she poses. These are then sifted to find a picture depicting Ahn looking unconcerned or distracted, captured in what she describes as \\"...a certain moment of time that did exist, but which we couldn't perceive with the naked eye because it happened too fast.\\" The Guardian reported that \\"In the most dangerous shots, such as when she is using her whole body to lean dangerously over the edge, a harness is sometimes used.

Robinson (1866-1942), a retired medical instrument merchant. Rosecroft is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The 15,000-square-foot, Italian Renaissance style mansion, located on Silvergate Avenue in the Wooded Area of Point Loma, sits on 2.5 acres and is considered the largest parcel in the area.

The Robinsons bought the property in 1903 after becoming interested in the ideas of Theosophist Katherine Tingley, who was developing a utopian community \\"Lomaland\\" in the Point Loma area. They developed the fields into half a city block of gardens, where they cultivated various ornamental plants, particularly begonias. Marion named the property \\"Rosecroft\\" in recognition of her Scottish Highland ancestry. Marion and Alfred were co-founders,California Garden Vol. 10, No. 6, December 1918 along with Kate Sessions, of the San Diego Floral Association, and Alfred was the association's first president, as well as the editor of its magazine, California Garden. Alfred, a self-taught horticulturist, began by experimenting with roses and dahlias, but eventually came to focus on begonias. He became \\"the pre-eminent begonia expert\\", developing more than 100 new varieties at the Rosecroft estate. Alfred's were judged \\"the finest begonias to be grown anywhere in the world\\" by plant explorer and botanist David Fairchild. After his death in 1942, a new owner opened the garden to the public as Rosecroft Begonia Gardens; the gardens were a popular tourist attraction through the 1960s. In the 1970s the property was sold and the garden area subdivided for residential use. Today the home is a private residence, marked by a National Register plaque. Several private residences occupy the former site of the Rosecroft Begonia Gardens; a stone wall along Silvergate Avenue is the only reminder of that attraction.

Ron Hubbard in 1950, three or four years after reportedly writing the \\"Affirmations\\" The \\"Affirmations\\", also referred to as the \\"Admissions\\", is a document written around 1946 or 1947. It does not list an author, but it is widely believed to have been written by L. Ron Hubbard, a few years before he established Dianetics (1950), which formed the basis for Scientology (1952). The document consists of a series of statements by and addressed to Hubbard, relating to various physical, sexual, psychological and social issues that he was encountering in his life. After the Affirmations became public knowledge in 1984, the Church of Scientology initially disputed their authenticity. However, they later effectively admitted the document's authorship, describing the work in legal papers as having been \\"written by\\" Hubbard and seeking to retain ownership of it. The Affirmations were intended to be used as a form of self-hypnosis with the intention of resolving Hubbard's psychological problems and instilling a positive mental attitude. They are closely linked to the occult philosophy of Thelema, devised by Aleister Crowley in the early 20th century, in which Hubbard participated for a while during 1945‚Äì46. In her book Inside Scientology: The Story of America's Most Secretive Religion, Janet Reitman calls the Affirmations \\"the most revealing psychological self- assessment, complete with exhortations to himself, that [Hubbard] had ever made\\". Background L. Ron Hubbard had become a well-known writer of pulp fiction stories in the 1930s before he joined the United States Navy in 1941, a few months before the US entered World War II.Streeter, pp. 206‚Äì7 His military career was not a success; he was removed from both of the vessels that he commanded after disagreements with his superiors and an incident in which he inadvertently shelled neutral Mexico. He spent a lengthy spell in hospital with chronic stomach ulcers in the last year of the war.Streeter, pp. 207‚Äì8 After the war ended in 1945 he moved in with Jack Parsons, a rocket scientist and occultist who shared a large house in Pasadena, California with various like-minded individuals.Streeter, p. 209 Hubbard was an enthusiastic participant in the sex magic rituals which Parsons, a member of Aleister Crowley's Ordo Templi Orientis (OTO), performed with the aid of his girlfriend and muse, Sara \\"Betty\\" Northrup, who was 20‚Äì21 years old in 1945. Hubbard subsequently eloped with Sara to Florida and eventually married her bigamously, without divorcing his first wife Polly, whom he had abandoned in Washington state along with their young son L. Ron Jr.Streeter, p. 210 At some point around 1946 or 1947, Hubbard is said to have composed what have become known as the \\"Affirmations\\" or \\"Admissions\\". They were written with the intention of reading them into a recording device and playing them back to himself as a form of self-hypnosis.Urban, pp. 345‚Äì6 The document came to light in the 1984 court case Church of Scientology v. Gerald Armstrong when the Church of Scientology's former archivist, Gerry Armstrong, read sections of them into the record against the strong objections of the church's lawyers. Other sections of the document were subsequently posted on the Internet by Armstrong after someone anonymously emailed a copy of the Affirmations to him in 2000.Reitman, p. 379 The name \\"Affirmations\\" was given to the document by Omar V. Garrison, a British writer hired by the Church of Scientology to write an official biography of Hubbard.Church of Scientology of California v. Gerald Armstrong. Reporter's Transcript, p. 3652. May 30, 1984 In the Armstrong case in 1984, Hubbard's wife's lawyer acknowledged that the document, written in Hubbard's own handwriting, was by Hubbard himself and claimed that it was part of his \\"research\\". It was, he said, \\"far and away the most private and personal document probably that I have ever read by anybody\\". Armstrong's lawyer agreed, commenting that \\"most Scientologists ... if they read these documents would leave the organization five minutes after they read them.\\"Atack, p. 100 The church argued that they constituted \\"a kind of self- therapy\\". It later backtracked, claiming that Hubbard had not written the document. However, as part of the agreement with the Church of Scientology that settled the 1984 case, Armstrong was required to return \\"all originals and copies of the documents commonly known as the 'Affirmations' written by L. Ron Hubbard\\". As religious studies scholar Hugh Urban comments, \\"here the church clearly indicates that the text was written by L. Ron Hubbard, and it seems difficult to understand why the church would file suit to retain ownership of the text were it not an authentic document.\\" Contents of the Affirmations The Affirmations is a semi-autobiographical text in which Hubbard confronts several problems in his life, from his failures in his naval career to his health and sexual problems. Hubbard intends to overcome them by self-hypnosis, affirming his ambitions and personal well-being. The document is divided into three sections: Course I, Course II and The Book.Wright, p. 51 =Course I= Sara \\"Betty\\" Northrup, Hubbard's \\"young, beautiful, desirable\\" second wife The first section sets out Hubbard's aim in writing the Affirmations. He describes it as an \\"experiment\\" whose purpose \\"is to re- establish the ambition, willpower, desire to survive, the talent and confidence of myself\\".Reitman, p. 20 He refers to his anxieties and insecurities, particularly relating to his writing and naval careers: \\"I was always anxious about people‚Äôs opinion of me and was afraid I would bore them. This injected anxiety and careless speed into my work. I must be convinced that I can write skilfully and well . . . I must be convinced I have succeeded in writing and with ease will regain my popularity, which actually was not small.\\" His naval career was a source of angst (a theme to which he returned in the other sections of the Affirmations); he wrote, accurately enough, that \\"my service record was none too glorious\\". Sex and relationships are a major theme in Course I. Hubbard writes that he is ashamed of his frequent affairs and his determination to succeed with the \\"young, beautiful, desirable\\" Sara, though he admits that he is hindered by impotence: \\"I want her always. But I am 13 years older than she. She is heavily sexed. My libido is so low I hardly admire her naked.\\" He had suffered sexually transmitted diseases and was treating his impotence with testosterone supplements. He wrote: \\"By eliminating certain fears of hypnosis, curing my rheumatism and laying off hormones, I hope to restore my former libido. I must!\\"Wright, p. 52 Hubbard appears to have believed that he could overcome his insecurities and physical weaknesses by focusing on a series of positive statements. Thus: * \\"I can write.\\" * \\"My mind is still brilliant.\\" * \\"That masturbation was no sin or crime.\\" * \\"That I do not need to have ulcers any more.\\" * \\"That I am fortunate in losing Polly and my parents, for they never meant well by me.\\" * \\"That I believe in my gods and spiritual things.\\" * \\"That my magical work is powerful and effective.\\" * \\"That the numbers 7, 25, and 16 are not unlucky or evil for me.\\" * \\"That I am not bad to look upon.\\" * \\"That I am not susceptible to colds.\\" * \\"That Sara is always beautiful to me.\\" * \\"That these words and commands are like fire and will sear themselves into every corner of my being, making me happy and well and confident forever!\\" =Course II= Hubbard (left) as a US Navy officer, 1943. His unsuccessful naval career was a major preoccupation of the Affirmations. The second section comprises the statements that have been referred to as the Affirmations. Hubbard appears to have intended them to be self-hypnotic, as they start with the command \\"You are asleep.\\" He was well known to his peers as an accomplished hypnotist and liked to give demonstrations of his abilities. In one demonstration to the Los Angeles science fiction society in April 1948, he hypnotised almost everyone in the society's clubroom. One member was convinced he was holding a pair of miniature kangaroos in the palm of his hand; another was persuaded that the floor was becoming so hot that he took off his shoes; and a third had a ten- minute conversation on an imaginary telephone with an equally imaginary car salesman.Miller, p. 140 Many of the Affirmations relate to Hubbard's health problems, which were recorded at length in his Veterans Administration files; for instance: * \\"Your eyes are getting progressively better. They became bad when you used them as an excuse to escape the naval academy. You have no reason to keep them bad.\\" * \\"Your stomach trouble you used as an excuse to keep the Navy from punishing you. You are free of the Navy.\\" * \\"Your hip is a pose. You have a sound hip. It never hurts. Your shoulder never hurts.\\" * \\"Your foot was an alibi. The injury is no longer needed.\\"Wright, p. 53 Others concern Hubbard's views towards women and sex, a significant issue in his life (he was to have three wives and seven children, with numerous other affairs on the side): * \\"Testosterone blends easily with your own hormones . . . You have no fear of what any woman may think of your bed conduct. You know you are a master. You know they will be thrilled. You can come many times without weariness . . . Many women are not capable of pleasure in sex and anything adverse they say or do has no effect whatever upon your pleasure.\\" * \\"You have no fear if they conceive. What if they do? You do not care. Pour it into them and let fate decide.\\" * \\"You can tell all the romantic tales you wish.‚Ä¶ But you know which ones were lies . . . You have enough real experience to make anecdotes forever. Stick to your true adventures.\\" * \\"Masturbation does not injure or make insane. Your parents were in error. Everyone masturbates.\\"Wright, p. 53-4 Some of the Affirmations relate to Hubbard's views on how he related with others: * \\"You have no urge to talk about your navy life. You do not like to talk of it. You never illustrate your point with bogus stories. It is not necessary for you to lie to be amusing and witty.\\" * \\"You like to have your intimate friends approve of and love you for what you are. This desire to be loved does not amount to a psychosis.\\" * \\"Your psychology is advanced and true and wonderful. It hypnotizes people. It predicts their emotions, for you are their ruler.\\"Wright, p. 52-3 Hubbard also expressed his ambitions for the future: * \\"Material things are yours for the asking. Men are your slaves.\\" * \\"You will make fortunes writing.\\" * \\"You will live to be 200 years old.\\" * \\"You will always look young.\\" * \\"Money will flood in upon you.\\" Finally, a significant number of the Affirmations relate to Hubbard's \\"Guardian\\". In 1945, Parsons had written to Aleister Crowley to inform him that Hubbard had become his \\"magical partner\\" and described Hubbard's beliefs: \\"From some of his experiences I deduced that he is in direct touch with some higher intelligence, possibly his Guardian Angel. He describes his Angel as a beautiful winged woman with red hair whom he calls the Empress and who has guided him through his life and saved him many times.\\"Miller, p. 118 Hubbard appears to have continued to believe in his Guardian Angel well after leaving Parsons's circle and wrote in his Affirmations: * \\"Nothing can intervene between you and your Guardian. She cannot be displaced because she is too powerful. She does not control you. She advises you.\\" * \\"The most thrilling thing in your life is your love and consciousness of your Guardian.\\" * \\"She has copper red hair, long braids, a lovely Venusian face, a white gown belted with jade squares. She wears gold slippers.\\" * \\"You can talk with her and audibly hear her voice above all others.\\" * \\"You can do automatic writing whenever you wish. You do not care what comes out on the paper when your Guardian dictates.\\" =The Book= The last part of the document is titled \\"The Book\\", which appears to allude to his authorship in mid-1938 of a still-unpublished manuscript called Excalibur, which he refers to as The One Commandment in the Affirmations.Wright, p. 54 He wrote that it had \\"freed you forever from the fears of the material world and gave you material control over people.\\"Wright, p. 55 The document lists Hubbard's personal goals, self-compliments and statements of what he believed (or wanted to believe) were his extraordinary qualities. For instance: * \\"You are radiant like sunlight.\\" * \\"You can read music.\\" * \\"You are a magnificent writer who has thrilled millions.\\" * \\"Ability to drop into a trance state at will.\\" * \\"Lack of necessity of following a pulp pattern.\\" * \\"You did a fine job in the Navy. No one there is now 'out to get you.'\\" * \\"You are psychic.\\" * \\"You do not masturbate.\\" * \\"You do not know anger. Your patience is infinite.\\" * \\"Snakes are not dangerous to you. There are no snakes in the bottom of your bed.\\" * \\"You believe implicitly in God. You have no doubts of the All Powerful. You believe your Guardian perfectly.\\" Analysis and interpretations Lawrence Wright suggests in his book Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief that in the Affimations \\"Hubbard is using techniques on himself that he would later develop into Dianetics.\\" He draws parallels with the practice of \\"auditing\\" used in Dianetics and Scientology, noting that the Affimations and Dianetics both involve tackling difficult memories that hold back mental and spiritual progress. The Affirmations themselves are intended to overcome the psychological effects of these memories. Wright calls the Affirmations \\"certainly be the most revealing and intimate disclosures Hubbard ever made about himself\\" and comments that they reveal \\"a man who is ashamed of his tendency to fabricate personal stories, who is conflicted about his sexual needs, and who worries about his mortality. He has a predatory view of women but at the same time fears their power to humiliate him.\\" Hugh Urban links the Affirmations with the magical practices that Hubbard participated in while a member of the OTO. He notes that Hubbard refers to the Affirmations as \\"incantations\\", which suggests that he intended them to be a magical ritual. Indeed, one of the Affirmations is \\"that my magical work is powerful and effective\\". During his stay with Parsons, Hubbard had come to regard himself as an adept or \\"magus\\", an enlightened spiritual being existing on a higher spiritual plane than the rest of the human race.Reitman, p. 21 Urban highlights Hubbard's repeated invocations of the Guardian, his spiritual adviser. This concept is drawn directly from Aleister Crowley's book Magick in Theory and Practice, which advocates that \\"adepts\\" should make it a priority to get in touch with their Guardian. Like Crowley's Magick, Hubbard's Affirmations assert that he was all-powerful and invulnerable because of his contact with the Guardian: Janet Reitman and Urban both note that the Affirmations contain themes that reappeared later in Scientology. Reitman points to one Affirmation that foreshadows Hubbard's future interest in mental healing: \\"You understand all the workings of the minds of humans around you, for you are a doctor of minds, bodies and influences.\\" Len Oakes writes that Hubbard appears to have been so convinced of the power of his words that he used them \\"to make love to an image of himself.\\" He characterises Hubbard's belief as a symptom of \\"an infantile, magical view of the world wherein one only need wish to make it so\\" and comments that beneath Hubbard's \\"freewheeling, lying exterior was a rigid, driven, superstitious mind-set desperate to win every time.\\"Oakes, p. 171 See also * Scientology and the occult References    * External links * Original text of the \\"Affirmations\\" on the website of Gerry Armstrong (PDF version) Category:Non- fiction works by L.

Robinson (1866-1942) and his wife Marion James Robinson (1873-1919) were wealthy residents of San Diego, California known for their impact on gardening and the cultivation of flowers, particularly begonias. Their extensive home garden was used to propagate and develop more than 100 new varieties of ornamental flowers and was later opened to the public as Rosecroft Begonia Gardens. Rosecroft was the name of their estate in the Point Loma neighborhood of San Diego. The residence, built for them in 1912, is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.San Diego Floral Association, California Garden. Vols. 98-99. 2007. p. 6. Early life Marion J. Duncan was born in San Francisco in October 1873. Marion was the only grandchild and her father Hilarion was the only child of the wealthy Scottish merchant James Duncan (1796 or 1798 - 1874). James Duncan had made his fortune in copper during three decades as a merchant in Valparaiso, Chile, before retiring to Britain in 1864. He was born and is buried on the Scottish Highland Isle of Bute, where he is known as \\"The Copperman\\". The name of her estate, Rosecroft, was Marion's nod to her Highland Scottish heritage. Alfred D. Robinson was born in Watton, Norfolk, England, and emigrated to the US in 1887 at the age of 21. After a brief stint as a cattle rancher he became a medical instruments merchant with the firm Hoppe and Robinson in Santa Ana in Orange County, California. In 1897 he married Marion J. Duncan; the couple had two children, Larona (born 1901) and Charlotte (born 1908). For the first six years of their marriage the couple lived in her widowed father Hilarion's large home at 1823 Turk St in San Francisco. With the death of her father on November 17, 1901, Marion inherited the bulk of her grandfather's fortune, giving the couple independent means. San Diego right In San Francisco they heard a lecture by Theosophist Katherine Tingley, describing the utopian community \\"Lomaland\\" which she was developing in the Point Loma area of San Diego. In 1903, they purchased 10 acres of barley fields in Point Loma near Lomaland and enrolled their daughter Larona in the Lomaland school. However, Larona was frail and did not thrive at Lomaland; she died of a heart ailment in 1909. The couple broke off all ties with Tingley and the Theosophists. After making a trip to Britain in 1904, the Robinsons settled permanently in San Diego in 1905. They developed the fields into half a city block of gardens, where they cultivated various ornamental plants, particularly begonias. In 1912, they moved into their new 15,000-square-foot, Italian Renaissance style mansion, Rosecroft, designed by architect Emmor Brooke Weaver. Alfred, a self-taught horticulturist, began experimenting with roses and dahlias, but eventually came to focus on begonias. He became \\"the pre- eminent begonia expert\\", developing more than 100 new varieties at the Rosecroft estate. Alfred's were judged \\"the finest begonias to be grown anywhere in the world\\" by plant explorer and botanist David Fairchild.Carter, Nancy Carol. When Dr. Fairchild Visited Miss Sessions: San Diego 1919. Journal of San Diego History. v. 50, nos. 3&4\\\\. p. 80. 2004. Alfred originated the idea of using lath houses to grow tropical plants in temperate climates. In 1912 he proposed, in an article in Sunset magazine, that the Panama-California Exposition then being planned for San Diego should include a \\"Palace of Lath\\"; this inspired the Botanical Building in Balboa Park. Both Robinsons were enthusiastic promoters of home gardening in San Diego. In 1907 they were co- founders,California Garden Vol. 10, No. 6, December 1918 along with Kate Sessions, of the San Diego Floral Association. Alfred was the Floral Association's first president and also served as the editor of its magazine, California Garden. Marion died in 1919. In 1922, Alfred married Annie Louisa Colby Robinson (1891-1981), the governess to his daughter Charlotte; they had five children. After Alfred's death in 1942, Annie sold the property. A new owner opened the garden and lath house to the public as Rosecroft Begonia Gardens. The gardens were a popular tourist attraction through the 1960s. In the 1970s, the property was sold and the garden area subdivided for residential use. The original main residence is privately owned and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Recognition *The American Begonia Society gives an annual Alfred D. Robinson Medal of Honor for creating new varieties of begonia. *In 2005 the San Diego Floral Association dedicated a bronze plaque to Alfred D.

Life and career  Pickett's talents provided him with the ability to host 3 different television shows and a radio show at the same time. All while consulting other television producers and aspiring musicians. Larry also developed and produced the double disc CD \\"One Hot Minute: North Carolina Hip-Hop Compilation\\" Pickett was a key contributor to helping Chapel Hill, North Carolina based entertainment company Zoom Culture attract national and international attention by helping their flagship television show titled \\"Hip Hop Nation: Notes from the Underground\\" gain nationwide airplay and worldwide DVD distribution. Hip Hop Nation: Notes from the underground, created by Kevin Thomas and Sue Herzog and sponsored by Universal Records aired in over 25 million homes in the United States on various stations across the country. Hip Hop Nation also aired overseas on MTV Base which is available in the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Switzerland, the Republic of Ireland, Kenya and South Africa. The channel was previously available in the Netherlands, Germany and other European countries but was replaced by MTV Dance in some territories from March 2008. All though Hip Hop Nation: Notes from the underground no longer airs on television it can still be found in DVD format worldwide (with a concentration in the USA, Italy and France) through a distribution deal with Xenon Pictures/Universal Music & Video Distribution/Lionsgate Pickett also created, produced and hosted \\"LP17\\" on WNCN (NBC-17) which was the #1 TV music show in the Southeast region of the United States. Lastly, \\"The Larry Pickett Show\\" was the highest rated show on Raleigh's Time Warner Cable Access. Larry was also an on-air radio talent on WQOK-FM (K97.5) in Raleigh, NC. The shows he produced/hosted consistently dominated the ratings* in their time slots over shows like the legendary Apollo TV show and other shows including Blind Date, Hot Ticket and Elimidate. (* Nielsen Media Research, DMA 29) more than doubling the ratings of their closest competitors. The shows retained more than 65% of its Saturday Night Live lead-in, ranking highest among women in the highly coveted 18-34 demographic. Pickett is known for his \\"LP Exclusives\\", because he gets exclusive interviews with the stars. All of the major record labels relied on Pickett to help them break their new artists in the Carolinas. Pickett has interviewed many celebrities in his career, ranging from WWE superstars, actors, comedians and literally hundreds of musicians, from Melissa Etheridge and P!nk to Babyface, DMX and Ludacris. On top of all that, Pickett was an entertainment producer/reporter for NBC covering entertainment stories, concerts and events. His entertainment stories occasionally aired on 13 other NBC owned and operated stations across the country via the FeedRoom platform that allowed NBC stations to share each other's content. Pickett has been seen on MTV, BET and Fox News Channel. He has also been featured in many national publications including Billboard Magazine, The Source Magazine, Vibe Magazine, Broadcasting & Cable Magazine and XXL Magazine as well as the cover story for Praxis Magazine. Pickett is originally from Queens, New York but moved to Raleigh, North Carolina after living in Long Beach, California for five years. Pickett started in television production at an early age. He first learned about TV production when he was in the 6th grade at Buffum Elementary in Long Beach, California. When he was just ten years old, he developed a love for videography. He had a video camera with him everywhere he went in school, and videotaped everything from recess to the school plays. When he first moved to North Carolina, he attended Ligon Middle School, and then went on to Athens Drive High School in Raleigh. Larry played wide receiver and free safety for the school football team and ran track, but his main concentration was on Television Production for ADTV, the school's closed circuit television station. Pickett was the first freshman in the school's history to be accepted into \\"TV3\\", Athens Drive High School's highest-level television production class, which put on two live broadcasts per day. Larry stayed in TV3 for four straight years and took on the role of Executive Producer his junior and senior year. By the time his senior year rolled around, there was so much talk of him around town that WRAL-TV5 did a series on him called \\"College Bound\\". WRAL followed Pickett through his senior year and did an update on him around every three months. WRAL's education reporter Yvonne Simmons followed Pickett's story from the first month of school during his senior year all the way to graduation day. After he graduated from Athens Drive High School in 1996, he continued to work in the TV production field. He did some work for WRAL-TV on a teen show called \\"Central Xpress\\" and worked as one of the official cameramen for the Raleigh Flyers soccer team. Pickett also filmed the annual North Carolina State gymnastics championships, worked with the News and Observer's annual Holiday Invitational basketball championships as a camera operator, and worked on a TV show that dealt with school issues called \\"School Talk.\\" Pickett started his quest to be a television personality at the studios of Community Television in Raleigh. Pickett was working as a cameraman on a live call in TV show on Time Warner Cable, when one day the host didn't show up. Pickett's good friend Ian Yack was the producer of the show and knew that Pickett had experience as a host, so he asked him to fill in. The phone lines lit up, and Pickett was an instant hit. He was invited to be a co-host on the show, and the show was a success, but the crew parted ways a year and a half after later. That is when Larry started his own show called \\"The Larry Pickett Show\\" which allowed local musicians in North Carolina to be interviewed by Pickett, perform live and be rated by the live call in audience.

It is a fable about a monstrous cat in a noble court who protects and ultimately avenges a young maid who had been kind to it. The title of the play was originally prefaced with ‚ÄòArimatsuzome Sum≈ç Yukata' ÊúâÊùæÊüìÁõ∏Êí≤Êµ¥Ë°£ („ÅÇ„Çä„Åæ„Å§„Åû„ÇÅ„Åô„ÇÇ„ÅÜ„ÇÜ„Åã„Åü), Arimatsu Dyed S≈´mo Yukata. Arimatsu tie dyed yukata are popular with Japanese Sum≈ç wrestlers. The title of the play suggests that it was used to advertise this fact. Another explanation is that the play had originally been sponsored by the tie-dying industry of Arimatsu. The play is set in Kurume Domain in Ky≈´shu's Chikugo Province (now Fukuoka Prefecture).  Story  The eighth Lord of the 21 mangoku(1) Kurume Domain is Matsudaira Dewa no Kami. His daughter, Princess Chiyo, lives in a mansion in an 18 mangoku neighbourhood in the Unsh≈ç District of Matsue. Sekiya, one of the ladies in waiting at the Lord's Palace, has a maid called Otaki who is a niece of Takao J≈´zaemon. It is hoped by Otaki's family that she will be able to find a dependable husband to marry. It is the private quarters of the Matsudaira's Palace where a banquet is taking place. A dog runs in chasing a kitten. The kitten tries to hide behind the Lord. As the frenzied dog tries to reach the kitten it snaps at the Lord. Sekiya, who is nearby, picks up an iron ladle from a ch≈çzubachi wash basin and strikes the dog on the forehead, killing it. The dog's corpse is quickly taken away. Sekiya is told by the Matsudaira that he is impressed with her speed and agility and that he would like to reward her with a gift of some sort, something that she desires perhaps. He thanks her for her compassion towards the kitten which, its life having been saved runs away. He is attracted to her cleverness, selflessness and the tender compassion which she showed to the kitten that she saved. He lavishes affection on her and shows appreciation towards her maid Otaki. The other ladies in waiting at the Palace and other members of the Kurume Clan burn with jealousy and bully Otaki. She is particularly badly bullied by the most senior lady in waiting Iwanami. As the bullying becomes more severe Otaki turns to her mother for support. Rumours abound that Otaki is disillusioned about finding a husband and that as a result of the bulling she has set off for Edo. It is also rumoured that as a kind and gentle hearted person she is feeling like committing suicide to end the pain and anguish she is suffering. Otaki has in fact found new employment as a samurai's maid called Onaka. When her master mysteriously dies she is furious and pursues the senior lady in waiting Iwanami. Otaki is determined to murder Iwanami and attacks her. However, Iwanami is an expert with the naginata halberd and in the twinkling of an eye she kills Otaki, the would-be avenger. After Otaki is killed a monster called Asuka appears and launches at attack on Iwanami, seizes her by the throat, tears out her windpipe and eats her. The monster is, in fact, the cat that Otaki had helped and shown affection to. Because she had slain Otaki the cat had violently killed Iwanami. Inside the Arima Clan's Edo style house there is uproar and all the people who had caused trouble are systematically slain. At Otaki's parents house there is 30 ryo which Otaki had left there along with another 50 ryo in a small box. In total 80 ryo which she had secretly entrusted for safekeeping to her brother Yokichi, the birth son of their mother. Blocking out the death of his sister and unable to mourn Yokichi leaves and at the Palace gates accidentally drops the money but picks it up and puts it in his breast pocket. Narusawa Osuke, an ashigaru foot soldier sees this, and follows Yokichi towards Edo. On the way he tricks Yokichi and kills him betraying Yokichi's mother and takes the 80 ryo and puts it in his neck wallet. Narusawa's comrade suspects him and is murdered and the crime is concealed. The monster cat that Otaki had loved appears again, attacks Narusawa and tries to retrieve the neck wallet which he has put in his breast pocket. The first attack fails and the cat dashes around running amok. It attacks Narusawa again and tears out his throat. Kills and eats him. The it climbs the fire observation tower where it kills and eats two more people. A blood rage sets in and it begins to wreak revenge on the Arima Clan. There is complete chaos as the people of the Arima Clan are killed by the cat. Matsudaira is out in his beloved garden with Yamamura Tenzen when a strange animal appears. Yamamura Tenzen, without telegraphing his actions, strikes at the beast with his sword several times. Later the cat, intent on avenging Otaki, hurls itself at Matsudaira and his favourite mistress who is pregnant and kills and eats them. In the meantime, unbeknownst to Yamamura Tenzen, the cat kills and eats his ailing mother and transforms itself into her image. When he returns home his aged mother has a wound on her forehead. Yamamura Tenzen considers this very strange and he starts to notice the inappropriate behaviour of his mother and the strange way she speaks. He realizes that the mysterious magical cat that escaped from him and which he had failed to catch and kill is disguised as his mother. At the same time the okakae(2) retainer the riskishi Sum≈ç wrestler Onogawa Kisabur≈ç is at the Arima Clan house. He has been defeated by another Sum≈ç wrestler, Raiden Tameemon. The defeated Onogawa is due to meet Raiden on Kudanzaka Hill so that they can settle their differences and end their grudge. At Kudanzaka Hill they meet and just as they are both about to draw their swords and let loose a tide of blood the Kurume warrior and jujitsu master, Inukami Gunbei, who has been appointed to control the situation and arbitrate between the two wrestlers, arrives. As a result of his failure, Onogawa, who had hoped to distinguish himself, intends to request that he be dismissed by his Lord and apologises. They all join swords with Yamamura Tenzen. Stealthily climbing the fire observation tower at the Akabane Daimy≈ç residence they kill the monster cat and then the okakae forces return to the Arima Clan house.

Following university education he established a legal practice, and later ran for, and won, election on Town of Malvern council. In this position he advocated for the establishment of a local tramway system, and became the inaugural chairman of the Prahran & Malvern Tramways Trust. In 1919 he was appointed as the inaugural chairman of the newly established Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board and presided in that capacity until 1935, creating a unified tram network from the disparate systems that were hitherto operating in Melbourne. He was recognised as a transport expert from his years of experience managing and expanding tramways of Melbourne. Early life Alexander Cameron was born on 5 August 1864, along with a twin brother, on a sheep station near Hamilton, Victoria to John Cameron and his wife Barbara Winifred (n√©e Taylor). He attended Hamilton College and then studied law at the University of Melbourne. In 1881 he was articled to Charles James Cresswell in Hamilton, and from 1885 to David Houston Herald in Melbourne, being admitted as a barrister and solicitor on 1 September 1886. Following overseas travel, Cameron established a legal practice with Samuel Crisp in Melbourne in 1889. Cameron married Mary Wright on 29 June 1892 in the Toorak Presbyterian Church, with the two subsequently living in Malvern. The two had a son who died in infancy. Town of Malvern Cameron's candidature for Town of Malvern's South Ward was announced on 5 July 1902, a position he subsequently won on 28 August 1902. Following election, he was appointed Malvern's delegate to the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works; an appointment which was consistent with his interests in building regulations. He also advocated for public transport, as Malvern had poor public transport access and the Melbourne Tramway & Omnibus Company's cable tram system did not serve the municipality. He advocated for electric trams, but was opposed by the Victorian Railways which feared the tramways would reduce their patronage. This fight was won when the Prahran & Malvern Tramways Trust Act 1907 (no. 2130) was passed, authorising the establishment of the Prahran & Malvern Tramways Trust (PMTT), and the construction of an electric tramway to connect Malvern and Prahran. This was a feat largely due to Cameron's legal acumen, and followed a recent precedent of suburban tramways in Melbourne, with the privately operated North Melbourne Electric Tramway and Lighting Company commencing operation in 1906. Prahran and Malvern Tramways Trust Cameron was selected to be the inaugural chairman of the PMTT in March 1908 when meetings of Prahran Council and Malvern Council, on the recommendation of Malvern Council, carried a motion supporting his appointment. To become chairman he resigned his seat on Malvern council. Cameron's tenure was extended by unanimous vote of the PMTT's municipalities in February 1914. Construction was authorised in July 1908, and began on the first two routes on 20 October 1909, with both lines opening to the public on 30 May 1910, operated by 13 trams. Under Cameron the PMTT grew rapidly, with lines extended, new lines opened, and many new trams purchased or constructed by the PMTT. Ultimately the PTMM became the largest electric tramway system in Melbourne, eclipsing the Victorian Railways' trams, North Melbourne Electric Tramway and Lighting Company, Hawthorn Tramway Trust, and Melbourne, Brunswick & Coburg Tramways Trust. By 1920, when the PMTT was absorbed into the Melbourne & Metropolitan Tramways Board (MMTB) the PMTT had sixteen lines; 94 operational trams; and served passengers in multiple suburbs beyond Prahran and Malvern, including Camberwell, Caulfield, Caulfield South, Point Ormond, Glen Huntly, Hawthorn, Kew, Kew East, Mont Albert, St Kilda, and Victoria Bridge (Richmond). Much of the growth and success of the PMTT is attributed to Cameron, who became a \\"recognized (sic) authority on the subject of passenger transport\\". Melbourne and Metropolitan Tramways Board In 1919 the Victorian Government formed the MMTB to take control of the Cable Tramway Board and the Royal Park Horse Tramway, with the intention of amalgamating Melbourne's tram systems (except the Victorian Railways' trams) into a single entity. Cameron was appointed the inaugural Chairman of the MMTB in July 1919, resigning his position on the PMTT on 31 October 1919 for the appointment. He was thanked for his service with the gift of a leather smokeroom chair, and HS Dix was selected to serve the remainder of Cameron's term. The MMTB was enlarged on 2 February 1920 when it absorbed the PMTT, Hawthorn Tramway Trust, Melbourne, Brunswick and Coburg Tramways Trust, Northcote Municipality Cable Tramways, and the Fitzroy, Northcote & Preston Tramways Trust and Footscray Tramway Trust which were both under construction, but not yet operational. The North Melbourne Electric Tramway and Lighting Company was later acquired by the Victorian Government, with the tramway component transferred to the MMTB on 21 December 1922, bringing all Melbourne's tram systems, except the Victorian Railways' trams, under the control of the MMTB. These disparate systems had all been constructed with varying standards and were not interconnected, under Cameron, the MMTB began uniting the system. Cameron travelled to continental Europe, the United Kingdom, and the United States in March 1923, investigating foreign operating procedures and innovations. He returned the next year, steadfast in his belief that trams were superior to buses and that overhead wires were more cost effective than conduit electric collection systems; confirming the view regarding conduit collection he held before his travels. Under Cameron's direction, the MMTB also created a General Scheme for the future development of Melbourne's trams, including new lines, extensions to existing lines, and the abandonment or conversion to electric traction of the cable tram system. Cameron's plan for electrification of the cable system saw resistance from City of Melbourne, Collins Street churches, and town planning groups, who complained that electric trams were noisy, would hold up traffic, and that the electric wires and poles were an eyesore. Under Cameron, the MMTB soon opened the Fitzroy, Northcote & Preston Tramways Trust and Footscray Tramway Trust lines, constructed a new link connecting the northern electric lines, built the Preston Workshops, and commenced construction of the now iconic W class trams. Conversion of the cable tram system was started in 1924, with most converted by the 1930s, although the depression slowed the rate of conversions, and last lines were finally closed in 1940. Administratively, the entire tram system was running as a single entity by 1925. Cameron also fostered development of Wattle Park, which had been inherited from Hawthorn Tramways Trust, expanding the park's facilities. Cameron's tenacity and leadership capabilities saw the MMTB massively expand, while remaining financially profitable. Twenty routes were either opened or extended under Cameron, and he is credited with building tram lines in largely unpopulated areas where future development was anticipated, creating a network that \\"thickly populated\\" Melbourne's suburbs. He vertically integrated the MMTB, bringing tramcar construction and maintenance, and tramway construction in-house. This astute management saw the MMTB have balanced books, with the exception of the first four years, with large amounts made available for infrastructure investment. He was sometimes, however, somewhat risky with financial decisions, opting to rely heavily on debt spending. Notwithstanding Cameron's preference for trams over buses, impassioned defence of trams' economic advantage over buses, and feelings that buses could not provide the same level of service as trams, he still saw them as useful for cross city routes and connecting to existing tram termini and the MMTB commenced operation of bus services on 3 January 1925. The first route competed with a private operator, with Cameron stating it would match price and travel time of the existing operator. Buses were also used as replacements for cable trams while they were being converted to electric traction, with the fleet quickly growing to 56 buses by mid-1926. However, by 1931 the MMTB ran almost no bus services, operating solely a tourist bus from 1932 to 1934, with the MMTB recommencing major bus operations in 1935/36 with the conversion of Elizabeth Street's cable trams and permits for new services being issued. Cameron's five-year term as chairman of the MMTB was repeatedly extended, postponing a review of the boards structure. On 18 December 1935 the Victorian Government announced Cameron's retirement, with Cameron not being notified, instead reading of the decision in the newspaper. This move was objected to by other members of the board, who \\"protested at the grave discourtesy shown to him\\" and \\"paid tribute to him when he chaired his last meeting on 19 December.\\" He was succeeded by Hector Hercules Bell who had been on the MMTB board since inception in 1919, and deputy chairman since July 1935. Legacy Cameron has been praised for his involvement in both the PMTT and MMTB, and in tramway development in Melbourne more generally. Following his appointment to the chair of the MMTB, he was reported in 1920 to have had \\"special knowledge and great abilities\\" which made him \\"the only one man in sight\\" for appointment as chair of the PTMM, and that for the position of MMTB Chair \\"there was no hesitation in appointing Mr Cameron. It was his right by the qualities of administration he had shown.\\" Cameron has been referred to as \\"the Board's first chairman who was regarded as the father of the electric tramways in Melbourne\\" and the \\"one person who should be awarded the credit for the creation and development of Melbourne's electric tramway system\\". Brunswick tram depot, which was built in 1935, has an adjacent street named Cameron Street in his honour. Personal life Cameron was a member of multiple organisations, including the Institute of Transport, London, the Clan Cameron Association of Victoria (of which he was president), the Melbourne Scots, the Rotary Club, and the Yorick Club. His associates knew him as \\"a golfer, fisherman, 'bridge-maestro', raconteur and philosopher.\\" He was also \\"known for his friendliness, and his enthusiastic dedication to his work\\" and was \\"well read in the works of Virgil, Horace, Washington Irving, Emerson and others.\\" Cameron died in South Yarra on 23 February 1940 from cancer and was survived by his wife, Mary Wright.

It contains a single species, Concavispina biseridens. It is known only from the holotype ZMNH M8804, a nearly complete 364 cm long skeleton. Concavispina can be differentiated from other thalattosaurs by possessing two rows of blunt teeth on the anterior part of the maxilla (upper jaw bone) and a V-shaped notch on the dorsal margin of each neural spine in the dorsal (back) vertebrae. Both its generic and specific names refer to these autapomorphies (unique characteristics), as Concavispina means \\"concave spine\\" and biseridens means \\"two rows of teeth\\". It is thought to be most closely related to Xinpusaurus, as both taxa share three derived characters: a maxilla that is curved upward at its anterior end, a humerus (upper arm bone) that is wider near the shoulder than near the elbow, and the presence of less than five cervicals (neck vertebrae). Description Concavispina has a large skull, short neck, short limbs, and long tail. ZMNH M8804 is long, making Concavispina biseridens the second longest thalattosaur after Miodentosaurus brevis. It has the largest skull of any thalattosaur. The skull is long and about half the length of the torso. Concavispina has less than five cervical vertebrae and its pectoral girdle is very close to its skull. 114 caudal or tail vertebrae are present, although the tip of the tail is not preserved. The tail makes up most of the length of the body. It is laterally compressed due to the long neural spines and chevrons that extend from each vertebra. The radius, ulna, fibula and tibia (the bones which make up the lower forelimb and lower hindlimb, respectively) are very short and very wide compared to the humerus and femur (which make up the upper forelimb and upper hindlimb). The carpal (wrist) and tarsal (ankle) bones are weakly developed. Paleobiology Like all thalattosaurs, Concavispina was a marine reptile that probably swam by lateral undulation or side-to-side movement of its elongated body. The limbs are too short to have provided much propulsive power. Concavispina was probably not as strong a swimmer as its closest relative Xinpusaurus because it has shorter neural spines with V-shaped notches, which would have reduced the surface area over which the M. semispinalis muscle (the main muscle along the top of the tail in most reptiles) could anchor. The tail is also less tall in Concavispina than in Xinpusaurus. Although Concavispina and Xinpusaurus both had pointed teeth at the front of the jaw and blunter teeth towards the front, Xinpusaurus's teeth were larger and more robust in general. This may support the hypothesis that Concavispina fed on relatively soft-bodied animals such as fish and jellyfish, while Xinpusaurus may have fed on harder prey with shells. However, Concavispina's maxillary teeth are wider than they are tall, proportionally similar to teeth of marine predators in the \\"crushing\\" guild (such as Globidens and modern walruses), which specialize in thick-shelled animals like molluscs. Xinpusaurus's teeth are generally taller than wide, similar to \\"crunching\\" guild marine predators (such as thalattosuchians and some large ichthyosaurs) which preferred armored crustaceans and fish but were not too specialized to avoid softer prey. The Xiaowa Formation is a Lagerst√§tte from which hundreds of fossils of thalattosaurs and crinoid invertebrates. Concavispina biseridens lived alongside many other species of thalattosaurs, including Anshunsaurus huangguoshuensis, Miodentosaurus brevis, Xinpusaurus suni, Xinpusaurus bamaolinensis, and Xinpusaurus kohi, making the thalattosaur fauna of the Xiaowa Formation the most diverse in the world.

Becker has also served as a Republican State Central Committee and Clermont County Republican Central Committee member and is a tax accountant and utility consultant. He is married with two children. Becker claims to be the most conservative politician in the Ohio legislature. He introduced bills in 2013 to allow state employees to carry guns on the job in most state buildings and to prohibit law enforcement agencies from destroying firearms confiscated by the police. In 2003, before his election to the legislature, Becker wrote a letter to the editor of the Cincinnati Enquirer pointing out that as Massachusetts had recently allowed same-sex marriage, the federal government was required to amend the Constitution to prohibit such unions, or failing that expel Massachusetts from the Union. The previous year, in another such letter, he proposed allowing Alaska to leave the Union so that it would be free to produce more oil.text of letter at http://www.beckergop.com/Other/Letters/Alaska.htm =HB 182= In April 2019, John Becker sponsored Ohio HB 182, drafted with assistance of Barry Sheets (a lobbyist for the Right to Life Action Coalition of Ohio), which prevents insurance from covering birth control and pregnancy termination (unless maternal life is at risk). However, he drew widespread condemnation for including a clause stipulating that insurance should cover implantation of an ectopic pregnancy into the uterus. This is not an existing procedure, and it is believed by the medical community to be impossible. In August of 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic, Becker drew up impeachment papers against Mike DeWine, Ohio's Republican governor; Nino Vitale and Paul Zeltwanger co- sponsored and were later joined by Candice Keller. The move was widely and immediately panned on both sides of the aisle and by legal scholars and commentators. Ohio Republican Party Chair Jane Timken \\"issued a scathing condemnation of the trio of conservatives\\", calling the move ‚Äúa baseless, feeble attempt at creating attention for themselves.‚Äù Ohio House Speaker, Republican Bob Cupp, called it an \\"imprudent attempt\\" to cause \\"a state constitutional crisis\\".

Although released in Japan and Europe during 1995 and 1996, it was never released in North America. The gameplay is reminiscent to video game titles like Dr. Mario and Puyo Puyo. Hebereke's Popoitto received mixed to positive reviews, and was mostly recommended for fans of the puzzle genre. In Japan, Hebereke Station Popoitto was re-released in 1999 under the SunKore Best label. It was later re-released again in 2001 under the Value 1500 label. Gameplay Screenshot of Stage 1 Similar to other falling block tile-matching video games, the core gameplay element consists of player-controlled blocks falling from the top of the playing field. In Hebereke's Popoitto, pairs of blocks, where each block in the pair can be any available color, appear from the top of the playing field and continue to fall until they fall on top of the ground or another block. The pair of blocks are, as long as they're still falling, controlled by the player and can be rotated. When a pair of blocks is suspended, a new pair of player-controlled blocks will fall from playing field ceiling. By lining up four or more blocks with the same color in certain formations the whole formation disappears. The available formations can be straight horizontal or vertical lines or simply just any adjoining formation, depending on the set difficulty level. What sets Hebereke's Popoitto apart from other similar games is that moving creatures, named Poro-porous, will float suspended in mid-air on the playing field. Sporadically, Poro-porous will move one space right, left, up or down. Touching a Poro-poro with a pair of blocks will as always suspend the blocks, and consequently the erratic behaviour of Poro-porous makes it more difficult for the player to plan ahead. Each Poro-poro has its own color and can be, just as with any other block, destroyed by making a formation with the same color. A game is won when every Poro-poro on the playing field is eliminated. A game can also be lost when the blocks fill up to the top of the playing field. The difficulty level controls, as stated earlier, the possible formations to build. An easier difficulty level will accept any adjoining formation of same-colored blocks, while a harder difficulty level will only accept straight horizontal or vertical lines. A higher difficulty level will also control the number of different available colors for blocks and the number of Poro-porous that are on the playing field at start. Modes In a single-player game, there is a story mode feature. It allows the player to travel to different worlds with an on-screen map and meet other characters. If a battle against another character is won, which is accomplished by winning two rounds, the defeated character becomes playable. Additionally, a multiplayer mode is available, where two players battle each other simultaneously. Specific for the two-player mode is a kind of special attack, which can be activated by eliminating more than one formation of blocks with one pair of blocks. A handicap level can be set individually for each player. Reception Hebereke's Popoitto was featured in several European video game magazines, and received mixed to positive reviews. The addicting gameplay and two-player mode were especially noted as highlights of the game. Still, the game, which was heavily compared to other puzzle video games, was mostly recommended for fans of the said genre. In Super Play, the reviewer liked the core gameplay, but did not like the game as much as Super Puyo Puyo, another SNES puzzle video game. A critic from Sega Saturn Magazine disliked that the special moves in the two-player mode were too difficult to obtain. In addition, the critic thought that the erratic movement of the Poro- porous made it too hard to plan ahead. A reviewer from the French video-gaming magazine Super Power considered the Poro-poro addition to be charming, but noted that Hebereke's Popoitto wasn't that strong graphically. Notably, Hebereke's Popoitto was ranked as the 98th best SNES game of all time in Super Play's top 100 best SNES games list.

Simmonds, 566 U.S. 221 (2012), is a United States Supreme Court decision regarding the limitation period for insider trading claims.. The court ruled in an 8-0 unanimous opinion that the limitation period was subject to traditional equitable tolling. Chief Justice John Roberts recused himself from the case.  Background  In 2007, Vanessa Simmonds, a recent college graduate, simultaneously filed lawsuits against fifty five financial institutions accusing them of abuses during the internet firm IPOs from 1999-2001 that eventually led to the dot com bust. Amongst her lawyers was her father David Simmonds who had earlier successfully argued a similar case against an internet start-up. The plaintiffs argued that the financial institutions violated section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by not disclosing so-called \\"short-swing\\" profits, that is profits from trades occurring over a period of less than six months. A federal district court consolidated the nearly identical cases and granted a motion to dismiss, stating that the two year limitation on the period on Section 16(b) had expired. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed the decision, stating that the two-year period was tolled until the \\"insider\\" or party benefitting from the profit had disclosed the transaction. Supreme Court The Supreme Court, in a majority opinion written by Justice Scalia remanded and vacated the lower court's decision, ruling that the limitations period for Section 16(b) was subject to traditional equitable tolling.

Schools  * Hoxie High School‚Äîgrades 8 through 12. * Hoxie Elementary School‚Äîprekindergarten through grade 5.  History of school integration  On June 25, 1955, largely the result of the recent Brown v. Board of Education ruling, Hoxie's superintendent, Kunkel Edward Vance, spearheaded plans to integrate the schools, and he received the unanimous support of Hoxie's school board. On July 11, 1955, Hoxie schools recommenced and allowed African American students to attend. Vance insisted that all facilities, including restrooms and cafeterias, be integrated, the third district in the state to do so.Jerry Vervack, Road to Armageddon: Arkansas and Brown v. Board of Education, May 17, 1954, to September 2, 1957. (Fayetteville, Arkansas: MA Thesis, University of Arkansas, 1978) Segregationists from outside the area converged on Hoxie in an unsuccessful attempt to reverse the school board decision. Approximately half of the white students boycotted the schools beginning on August 4, 1955. The Hoxie School Board filed suit against the segregationist leaders from Hoxie and elsewhere in the state and charged them with trespassing on school property, threatening picket lines, organizing boycotts, and intimidating school officials. In November, 1955, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas Thomas C. Trimble ruled that pro-segregationists had \\"planned and conspired\\" to prevent integration in Hoxie. In December 1955, he issued a permanent injunction and restraining order against the segregationists. Their appeal in the Eight Circuit Court of Appeals was opposed by United States Attorney General Herbert Brownell and the U.S. Department of Justice. This marked the first intervention by the attorney general in support of any school district attempting to comply with the Brown decision. On October 25, 1956, the court ruled in favor of the Hoxie School Board. U.S. Attorney Osro Cobb recalls that the situation at Hoxie > had reached the point of possible bloodshed. Guns were being carried; > threats were being made, and violence could have erupted at any moment. > Notwithstanding, a conference exploring the situation and its possible > effects on the community with the individuals at the core of the problem had > worked a minor miracle.

From April to June 2006, Shibutani took part in the first ever League Princess tournament, but was eliminated from her round-robin, following a loss to Fuka in her final match on June 18. She was however recognized as having the best match of the tournament with Ayumi Kurihara. By late 2006, Shibutani had established herself as one of JDStar's top wrestlers, starting a storyline rivalry with the villainous Caribbean Gundan stable of Caribbean Kim, Caribbean Moon and Caribbean Rum.

She was trained in not only professional wrestling, but also kickboxing, by Ikuto Hidaka and Satoshi Kobayashi at the Pro Wrestling Zero1 Norainu Dojo and made her debut on April 24, 2012, against Yuzuki Aikawa. She remained affiliated with Zero1 for her entire career, but, due to the low number of women's matches held by the promotion, spent most of her time working with the World Wonder Ring Stardom promotion, where she won the Rookie of Stardom tournament in December 2012 and her first professional wrestling title, the Artist of Stardom Championship, in June 2013. Yuhi retired from professional wrestling in March 2014, coinciding with her high school graduation. Professional wrestling career With a six- year sports background in dancing and two years in acrobatics, Yuhi enrolled in the Bukuro Gym in 2009 to begin training kickboxing under Satoshi Kobayashi. While there, she met professional wrestler Ikuto Hidaka, who was impressed by her, but did not have his own dojo at the time. In February 2011, Kobayashi left Bukuro Gym to form the Norainu Dojo in collaboration with professional wrestling promotion Pro Wrestling Zero1. Yuhi followed Kobayashi to Norainu Dojo, where she continued her kickboxing training, but also began training professional wrestling mainly under Hidaka, but also guest trainers like Nanae Takahashi and Natsuki‚òÜTaiyo, while also continuing her high school studies at Senior High School at Sakado, University of Tsukuba. On January 21, 2012, Zero1 presented Yuhi to the public and announced she was almost ready to make her professional wrestling debut. It was announced that she would be performing under her real given name Yuhi, which is Japanese for \\"sunset\\"; by coincidence Hidaka had previously run a women's wrestling promotion named Pro Wrestling Sun. On April 14, Zero1 revealed that the promotion had recruited World Wonder Ring Stardom representative and Tokyo Sports' 2011 joshi wrestler of the year, Yuzuki Aikawa, to serve as Yuhi's debut opponent. Ten days later, Yuhi made her debut at a Pro Wrestling Zero1 event in Tokyo's Korakuen Hall, losing to Aikawa. On April 28, Yuhi was defeated by freelancer Hiroyo Matsumoto at a small outdoor event in her hometown of Asaka, Saitama. On May 3, Yuhi made her first appearance outside of Zero1, when she made debut for women's wrestling promotion World Wonder Ring Stardom, losing to Io Shirai in a singles match. Yuhi and Hiroyo Matsumoto had a rematch at a larger Zero1 event in Korakuen Hall on May 16, where Matsumoto once again was victorious. On May 20, Yuhi returned to Stardom, wrestling Arisa Hoshiki to a fifteen- minute time limit draw in a main event \\"draft match\\". After the match, all of Stardom's stables; Io Shirai's Planet, Nanae Takahashi's Nanae Gundan, Natsuki‚òÜTaiyo's Kawasaki Katsushika Saikyou Densetsu Plus One, and Yuzuki Aikawa's Zenryoku Joshi, entered the ring in an attempt to convince Yuhi to join them. Eventually, Yuhi chose to join Zenryoku Joshi, which also included Kairi Hojo, Saki Kashima and Yoko Bito, and was two weeks later also joined by old associate Hiroyo Matsumoto. Due to the complete lack of other female wrestlers in Zero1, this effectively made Stardom Yuhi's new home promotion, though she was still billed as a Zero1 Norainu Dojo representative. On June 10, 2012, Yuhi won her first match, when she and Kairi Hojo defeated Eri Susa and Yuuri Haruka, though she did not score the deciding pinfall. On July 8, Yuhi faced World of Stardom Champion Nanae Takahashi in a losing effort in a non-title match. She finally picked up her first direct win on July 22 by pinning Yuuri Haruka in a Stardom Rumble to earn a spot in the upcoming 5‚òÖStar GP2012 tournament.

She then continued the tournament, defeating Act Yasukawa on August 26, losing to Nanae Takahashi on September 2, wrestling Io Shirai to a fifteen-minute time limit draw on September 17, and losing to eventual tournament winner Yuzuki Aikawa on September 30, as a result, failing to advance from her block.

In their first round-robin match, the team, billed as \\"Y Dash\\", defeated Eri Susa and Nozomi. On November 6, Yuhi returned to Zero1 taking part in an all Stardom tag team match, where she and Kairi Hojo defeated Mayu Iwatani and Natsumi Showzuki. Y Dash continued their Goddesses of Stardom Tag League on November 11 with a win over Thunder Rock (Io Shirai and Mayu Iwatani), but a loss to Kawasaki Katsushika Saikyou Densetsu (Natsuki‚òÜTaiyo and Yoshiko) on November 25 meant that they narrowly failed to qualify for the finals of the tournament. On December 9, Yuhi entered the second annual Rookie of Stardom tournament. After defeating Zenryoku Joshi stablemate Kairi Hojo in her first round match, she won the tournament by defeating Act Yasukawa in the finals. In a post-match victory speech, Yuhi made a challenge for the Goddess of Stardom Championship on December 24, but as Yuzuki Aikawa was already booked for the event, she chose Hiroyo Matsumoto, whom she referred to as her \\"older sister\\" and Zero1 training partner, as her new partner. On December 24, Yuhi and Matsumoto were defeated in their title match by the defending champions, Natsuki‚òÜTaiyo and Yoshiko.

Yuhi received her title shot on June 2, but was defeated by Dark Angel. On June 23, Yuhi teamed with Kairi Hojo and Kaori Yoneyama to defeat the Kimura Monster-gun (Christina Von Eerie, Hailey Hatred and Kyoko Kimura) in a decision match to win the vacant Artist of Stardom Championship, her first professional wrestling title.

This suite of measures can be administered to study participants in two hours or less, in a variety of settings, with a particular emphasis on measuring outcomes in longitudinal epidemiologic studies and prevention or intervention trials. The battery has been normed and validated across the lifespan in subjects age 3-85 and its use ensures that assessment methods and results can be used for comparisons across existing and future studies. The NIH Toolbox is capable of monitoring neurological and behavioral function over time, and measuring key constructs across developmental stages.Gershon RC, Cella D, Fox NA, Havlik RJ, Hendrie HC, Wagster MV. Assessment of neurological and behavioural function: the NIH Toolbox. Lancet Neurol. 2010;9(2):138-139.Neurology, March 2013; 80(11 Supplement 3)  History  In 2004, the 15 Institutes, Centers and Offices at the National Institutes of Health which support neuroscience research formed a coalition called the NIH Blueprint for Neuroscience Research. The NIH Blueprint goal is to develop new tools, resources, and training opportunities to accelerate the pace of discovery in neuroscience research. Because the research community had long sought the development of standard instruments to measure cognitive and emotional health, in 2006 the NIH Blueprint awarded a contract to develop an innovative approach to meet this need. Under the leadership of principal investigator Richard C. Gershon, a team of more than 300 scientists from nearly 100 academic institutions were charged with developing a set of tools to enhance data collection in large cohort studies and to advance the neurobehavioral research enterprise.National Institutes of Health.NIH Toolbox is open. A new set of tools to help scientists measure the ways we think, move, feel and sense the world is ready for use in studies.... NIH Record newsletter, October 26th 2012Talan, Jamie. New NIH Toolbox Rolled Out for Standardized Behavioral and Clinical Assessment Measures.Neurology Today. 2012; 12(21):7  Test batteries  The NIH Toolbox divides tests into four aspects of neural function, called \\"domain batteries\\": * Cognition * Sensation * Motor * Emotion  Impact on neurological research  Prior to the NIH Toolbox, there were many studies that collected information on aspects of neural function with little uniformity among the measures used to capture these constructs.Pilkonis PA, Choi SW, Salsman JM, et al. Assessment of self- reported negative affect in the NIH Toolbox. Psychiatry Res. 2012 Epub ahead of print. Moreover, capturing information on all four domains within a study would be costly in terms of time and subject burden. Custom measures could not easily be compared across studies, and assessments were typically limited to looking at cognitive variables. Expensive equipment and per-subject royalty fees were often required. Time-consuming measures usually required highly trained administrators. With the NIH Toolbox, researchers can assess function using a common metric and can ‚Äúcrosswalk‚Äù among measures, supporting the pooling and sharing of large data sets. The NIH Toolbox will support scientific discovery by bringing a common language to research questions ‚Äì both with respect to the primary study aims and to those arising from secondary data analyses. The four batteries provide researchers with measures that have minimal subject burden and cost. The NIH Toolbox battery of measures will be used by The Human Connectome Project (HCP) to understand the relationship between brain connectivity and behavior,http://humanconnectome.org/about/project/behavioral-testing.html, Retrieved 2013-03-08 Standardized measures are easily compared across studies. Measures are validated against ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù instruments and easily incorporate multiple areas of neurological functioning. NIH Toolbox requires inexpensive equipment, no royalties, low per-subject costs (per-subject costs limited to taste and olfaction assessments). NIH Toolbox offers brief, psychometrically sound measures that can be administered with minimal expertise.  Selection of domains and sub-domains  Initial literature and database reviews and a Request for Information of NIH-funded researchers identified the sub-domains for inclusion in the NIH Toolbox, existing measures relevant to the project goals, and criteria for instrument selection. NIH Project Team members, external content experts, and contract scientists met at a follow-up consensus meeting to discuss potential sub-domains along with the criteria affecting instrument selection, creation, and norming. Additional expert interviews were undertaken to gather more detailed information from clinical and scientific experts to help further refine the list of possible sub-domains. A second consensus group meeting was held and results directed the selection of the sub-domains within each core domain area to be measured in the final NIH Toolbox.  Selection of measures  More than 1,400 existing measures were identified and evaluated for inclusion in the NIH Toolbox. The selection criteria included a measure‚Äôs applicability across the life span, psychometric soundness, brevity, ease of use, applicability in diverse settings and with different groups, and lack of intellectual property constraints. There was also a preference for instruments that were already validated and normed for use with individuals between 3 and 85 years old. Results of the instrument selection process greatly facilitated the drafting of plans to develop the NIH Toolbox measures.  Validation  Validation studies were conducted for all NIH Toolbox measures, to assure that these important tools for research met rigorous scientific standards. Studies were conducted across the entire age range, typically included 450-500 subjects, and were statistically compared against ‚Äúgold standard‚Äù measures wherever available. For tests using item response theory approaches to scoring, calibration samples generally included several thousand participants, ensuring robust models. In total, data was collected from more than 16,000 subjects as part of field-test, calibration and validation activities.Rine R, Roberts D, Corbin BA, et al. A new portable tool to screen vestibular and visual function in children and adults: NIH Toolbox. J. Rehabil. Res. Dev. 2012;49(2):209-220.  Norming  NIH Toolbox conducted a national standardization study in both English and Spanish languages to allow for normative comparisons on each assessment. A sample of 4,859 participants, ages 3‚Äì85 ‚Äì representative of the U.S. population based on gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status ‚Äì was administered all of the NIH Toolbox measures at sites around the country. NIH Toolbox normative scores are now available for each year of age from 3 through 17, as well as for ages 18‚Äì29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-69, 70-79, and 80-85, allowing for targeted, accurate comparisons for any research study participant groups against the U.S. population.  Advanced measurement techniques  The NIH Toolbox measures utilize several advanced approaches in item development, test construction, and scoring. Two of these are item response theory and computer adaptive testing (CAT).Gershon R. Understanding Rasch Measurement: Computer Adaptive Testing. J. Appl. Meas. 2005;6(1):109-127.Gershon RC, Cook K. Use of Computer Adaptive Testing in the Development of Machine Learning Algorithms. Pain Med. 2011;12(10):1450-1452. Item Response Theory allows tests to be brief, yet still precise and valid.Cella D, Chang CH, Heinemann AW. Item Response Theory (IRT): Applications in quality of life measurement, analysis, and interpretation. In: Mesbah M, Cole B, Lee MLT, eds. Statistical Methods for Quality of Life Studies: Design, Measurements, and Analysis. Boston, MA: Kluwer Academic Publishers; 2002:169-186. Using IRT methodology, sets of items are calibrated along a continuum that covers the full range of the construct to be measured. This calibrated set of items enables the creation of CAT, a specialized type of computer-based testing that enables frequent assessments and immediate feedback with minimal burden on participants and precise evaluation at the individual level.  Early childhood use  NIH Toolbox measure development focused special attention on assessing young children,Dalton P, Mennella JA, Cowart BJ, Maute C, Pribitkin EA, Reilly JS. Evaluating the Prevalence of Olfactory Dysfunction in a Pediatric Population. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2009;1170(1):537-542. to ensure that all tests given are developmentally appropriate for ages 3‚Äì7. A special team of early childhood assessment consultants was engaged to provide testing guidelines for the very young, to offer input on measure development, and to review all NIH Toolbox measures to ensure they fit the needs of young children.Bauer P, Leventon J, Varga N. Neuropsychological Assessment of Memory in Preschoolers. Neuropsychol. Rev. 2012;Epub ahead of printMcClelland MM, Cameron CE. Self-regulation and academic achievement in elementary school children. New Dir. Child Adolesc. Dev. 2011;2011(133):29-44.  Assessment Center  NIH Toolbox measures are administered using Assessment Center, a free, browser-based research management software application where users can access, practice, and then administer NIH Toolbox measures. Assessment Center enables researchers to create study-specific websites for capturing participant data securely. Studies can include measures within the Assessment Center library as well as custom measures created or entered by the researcher.Gershon R, Rothrock NE, Hanrahan RT, Jansky LJ, Harniss M, Riley W.

Professional career =Minor leagues (2009‚Äì2014)= Polanco competed in showcases, and played as a pitcher due to his being left-handed. He was asked to rotate to the outfield due to a shortage of players, and found that he preferred the position. Polanco signed as an international free agent with the Pirates on April 11, 2009. In 2009, he played for the Dominican Pirates of the Rookie-level Dominican Summer League. In 2010, he played for the Gulf Coast Pirates of the Rookie-level Gulf Coast League (GCL), where he had a .202 batting average. In 2011, he played for the GCL Pirates and the State College Spikes, batting .237. He spent the 2012 season with the West Virginia Power of the Class A South Atlantic League. He enjoyed his best season to date, batting .325 with 16 home runs and 40 stolen bases. He was named the South Atlantic League player of the year, and the Pirates' minor league player of the year. Prior to the 2013 season, Polanco was ranked as the 65th best prospect in baseball by MLB.com, and as the 51st best prospect in baseball by Baseball America. Polanco began the 2013 season with the Bradenton Marauders of the Class A-Advanced Florida State League. With Bradenton, Polanco batted .312 with 24 stolen bases and 30 runs batted in in 57 games, before receiving a promotion to the Altoona Curve of the Class AA Eastern League. In June 2013, Baseball Prospectus ranked Polanco as the 12th best prospect in baseball. Polanco, along with Dilson Herrera, represented the Pirates at the 2013 All-Star Futures Game. The Pirates promoted Polanco to the Indianapolis Indians of the Class AAA International League at the end of the season. He received nine at-bats with Indianapolis. The Pirates added Polanco to their 40-man roster on November 20, 2013, to protect him from being selected by another team in the Rule 5 Draft. On March 14, 2014, the Pirates optioned Polanco to Indianapolis. =Pittsburgh Pirates (2014‚Äìpresent)= Polanco was called up to MLB on June 9, 2014 due to an appendix injury to second baseman Neil Walker and made his MLB debut on June 10 playing right field. In that game, he recorded his first career MLB hit against Chicago Cubs pitcher Travis Wood, later scoring his first career MLB run. The following day, June 11, Polanco recorded his first career MLB RBI. On June 13, as part of a five-hit game, Polanco hit his first career MLB home run, a two-run shot, against the Miami Marlins in the 13th inning that would turn out to be the game winner in an 8‚Äì6 victory for the Pirates. On June 17, he became the third Pirates player‚Äîthe first since Roberto Clemente in 1955‚Äîto record a hit in each of his first seven MLB appearances. The following day, he became the first Pirate to hit in his first eight games. Polanco struggled for a month after a good start to his career, and was optioned to Triple-A Indianapolis on August 25 before returning a week later as part of the expanded roster at the beginning of September. On April 5, 2016 the Pittsburgh Pirates announced they had reached an agreement with Polanco and his agent Rafa Nieves on a $35 million contract extension. On May 17, 2017, Polanco was placed on the 10-day disabled list due to a strained left hamstring. The transaction was retroactive two days prior to the announcement. On September 12, 2018, Polanco underwent surgery on his dislocated shoulder. On July 17, 2020, it was announced that Polanco had tested positive for COVID-19.

At least 37 people died and another 126 were injured when an explosion occurred in a building adjacent to the main tower. Earlier in the day, Pemex sent out a tweet saying that the building was being evacuated due to a \\"problem with the electrical system\\" in the complex that includes the skyscraper. Incident At about local time, an explosion occurred in the basement of a parking garage adjacent to the main office building. The blast caused the first two stories of the fourteen-floor Building B-2 to partially collapse. The cause of the blast was a gas leak that was ignited by an electrical fault. Aftermath Site after explosion An evacuation of the area had been begun in the minutes following the explosion. In the hours after the blast, about 30 people were reported to be trapped in debris, and searches continued into the next day, as Pemex CEO Emilio Lozoya said there were indications that some people remained under the rubble. An initial estimate of casualties, given by a Mexico City government official about two hours after the explosion, was of about five dead and 75 injured. By evening, the Mexican interior minister said that the death toll had risen to fourteen, with 80 injuries. , the death toll stood at 33 and was expected to rise, according to a paramedic at the site. There were 12 men and 20 women who were confirmed to have died, along with 121 people injured, 52 of which remained in the hospital the day after the explosion. By 4 February, the death toll had risen to 37, with three more bodies uncovered and the death of an injured woman. An estimated 500 rescuers were working at the site through the day on 1 February 2013, including firefighters, military personnel, and Red Cross workers, aided by dogs and a crane. Four helicopters were used to evacuate those injured, in addition to ambulances. While rescue operations were underway, police cordoned off the area around the office complex. On 4 February 2013, it was announced by Attorney-General Jesus Murillo Karam that the explosion was caused when a buildup of gas in the basement was ignited by a spark, from what was believed to be an electrical fault. According to Murillo, the explosion had expanded outwards, consistent with a gas explosion, rather than remaining focused in one spot, as a bomb would have done, and none of the victims had injuries of the types associated with bombings. Reactions Through Twitter, President of Mexico Enrique Pe√±a Nieto wrote: \\"I have ordered the relevant authorities to implement rescue protocols and the investigation of the facts. The priority right now is to attend to the injured and to safeguard the physical integrity of those who work there\\". He also sent his condolences to relatives: \\"I deeply regret the death of fellow PEMEX workers. My condolences to their families\\". Pe√±a Nieto also established three days of national mourning. The Director General of Pemex, Emilio Lozoya Austin, tweeted: \\"My condolences to all the families of workers at Pemex who have lost loved ones in the explosion of today\\". Former National Action Party presidential candidate Gustavo Madero Mu√±oz, the governors of Guerrero, Zacatecas, Veracruz, Morelos, Tabasco, and Oaxaca, and the Finance Minister, Luis Videgaray Caso, and several senators also sent their condolences and expressed solidarity with the families of the victims.

He has conducted archaeological research throughout the circumpolar region investigating cultural responses to climate and environmental change and European contact. He has published numerous books and more than 150 journal articles, and has produced large international exhibitions and popular films. Of particular note are the many exhibition catalogues he has had edited, which make syntheses of scholarly research on these subjects available to visitors to public exhibitions. Career Fitzhugh attended Deerfield Academy and Dartmouth College, where Professor Elmer Harp introduced him to archaeological fieldwork and Inuit studies in the Hudson Bay region of northern Canada. After two years in the U.S. Navy Fitzhugh entered the graduate program at Harvard University, where he received his PhD in anthropology in 1970 focusing on the environmental archaeology and cultural systems of coastal Labrador. Upon graduating, he took a position at the Smithsonian‚Äôs National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) as Curator of North American Anthropology. In this capacity, and as founder and director of the Arctic Studies Center, he has spent more than forty years studying and publishing on arctic peoples and cultures of northern Canada, Alaska, Siberia, Scandinavia, and Mongolia. At the beginning of his career, Fitzhugh focused especially on questions of human adaptations to arctic and sub-arctic environmental change. This research focused primarily on the coastal regions of central and northern Labrador, where successive field expeditions documented the full sequence of culture history and settlement and which involved collaborations with other archaeologists, ethnographers, paleoecologists, and geologists. Early on he developed expertise as well in circumpolar archaeology, pursuing and encouraging comparative research from Scandinavia to Alaska. His field research took him from Labrador to Baffin Island and, more recently, the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, in search of evidence of early Inuit-European contacts. Fitzhugh's interest in the ethnohistoric sources of northern communities inspired many of the major traveling exhibitions he co/initiated at the Smithsonian Institution, including \\"Inua: Spirit World of the Bering Sea Eskimo\\" (1980), \\"Crossroads of Continents: Cultures of Siberia and Alaska\\" (1988), \\"Ainu: Spritis of a Northern People\\" (1999) and \\"Vikings: The North Atlantic Saga\\" (2000). The Viking exhibit was featured in a cover story in Time magazine. Since 2000, Fitzhugh‚Äôs research efforts have been directed at investigations of prehistoric Indian and Inuit cultures and European Basque whalers along the Lower North Shore of Quebec near the Labrador border. His interests in the origins of Bering Sea Eskimo culture have also led him to conduct research in northern Russia and Mongolia, where for the past several years he has been investigating reindeer herding along the forest-steppe border between Tuva and Mongolia. His studies of Mongolia‚Äôs Bronze Age deer stones have suggested possible connections with Scythian art of Western Asia, and to the east, with East Asian and the early art of the Bering Sea Eskimos. =Arctic Studies Center= In 1988, Dr. Fitzhugh established the Arctic Studies Center (ASC), the only U.S. government program with a special focus on northern cultural research and education. In keeping with this mandate, the ASC specifically studies northern peoples, exploring history, archaeology, social change and human lifeways across the circumpolar world. ASC is part of the Department of Anthropology in the National Museum of History, a section of the Smithsonian Institution. The Arctic Studies Center curates extensive arctic and sub-arctic ethnology collections, the majority of which were acquired between 1858 and 1890 by naturalists from the Mackenzie District, Ungava, Baffin Island, Coppermine, Alaska and Siberia. Research at the Arctic Studies Center both in Washington, DC, and at its division in Anchorage, AK, seeks to bring ASC researchers together with community scholars in the collaborative exploration of the cultural heritage represented in these collections. Honors Dr. Fitzhugh served as Chairman of the Smithsonian's Department of Anthropology from 1975‚Äì80 and again in 2002-2005, is an Advisor to the Arctic Research Commission, represents the Smithsonian and arctic social science in various inter-agency councils, served on the Smithsonian Science Commission and holds various other administrative and advisory posts.

It depicts four naked youths in and around a boat, bathing in the sea. Tuke started the painting in 1893, probably en plein air on a boat in the harbour at Falmouth, Cornwall. The finished painting was exhibited at the Royal Academy summer exhibition in 1894, and immediately purchased for the Tate Gallery, where it remains. Unlike his earlier paintings, it has an Impressionistic style, influenced by his travels to Italy, Corfu and Albania in 1892. Background Tuke was born in York in 1858, but his family moved to Falmouth the following year, where it was hoped the milder climate would ameliorate the tuberculosis suffered by his father, the doctor Daniel Hack Tuke. He showed early talent for art, and studied at the Slade School of Art in London in 1874-79 and in Paris from 1881-83, and also travelled to Italy. He returned to Cornwall to live in Falmouth 1883, and is usually identified as a member of the Newlyn school. Many of his works involve boys or young men, often in or beside the sea, and usually naked, although generally in a position where their genitals are hidden from view. Painting The painting depicts four young men bathing in Falmouth harbour: one in the sea holding on to the side of a rowing boat, one standing up in the boat holding a cloth or towel, and two sitting in the boat, one leaning back at the stern sunbathing, and one leaning forward by the oars. The first three are apparently naked, while the fourth wears a blue shirt and brown waistcoat. The dominant colour, reflected in the title, is blue: the sky is blue above, with a golden sunlight creating glowing colours; there are clear blue waters below, with a greenish shadow of the boat. Boats with their square-rigged sails furled ride at anchor in the background. The careful composition shows the youths' healthy bodies in a fresh and modern style, which may be contrasted with the lifeless classical models depicted in contemporary academy paintings, and Tuke's earlier work. The painting is ambiguous, and can be read in several ways: as a celebration of athletic masculinity; or as a representation of the innocence and purity of youth, unselfconscious in a natural setting, reminiscent of a lost rural idyll; but many discern a homoerotic charge. The painting measures by . A discoloured varnish was removed in 2000, but the painting shows grey stains to the lower left and upper right corners, perhaps indicating mould in the underlying paint structure. The title is taken from the last verse of \\"The Sundew\\", a poem by Algernon Swinburne published in 1866, describing a lovers' tryst in marshland, witnessed by a sundew, which ends \\"Thou wert not worth green midsummer // Nor fit to live to August blue, // O Sundew, not remembering her.\\" Tuke's paintings of naked boys bathing inspired several works by Uranian poets in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, including \\"The Dawn Nocturne (August Blue)\\" by Alan Stanley (1894), and the earlier poems \\"Sonnet on a Picture by Tuke\\" by Charles Kains Jackson (1889) and \\"Ballade of Boys Bathing\\" (1890) by Frederick Rolfe, the self-proclaimed \\"Baron Corvo\\". File:Henry Scott Tuke - Study for ‚ÄûAugust Blue‚Äú, 1911.jpgStudy for August Blue File:Henry Scott Tuke - Preliminary Sketch for ‚ÄûAugust Blue‚Äú.jpgPreliminary Sketch for August Blue Reception The painting was a critical success when it was exhibited at the Royal Academy summer exhibition in 1894, although some critics complained that its informal Impressionistic style made it closer to a sketch than a finished work. It was bought from the artist by the Tate Gallery the same year for 500 guineas (or ¬£525), using funds from the Chantrey Bequest Fund, established from the estate of sculptor Francis Chantrey and charged with encouraging British art by buying paintings and sculpture of the \\"highest merit\\" executed entirely within Great Britain. It was the second of Tuke's works to be purchased by Chantrey Bequest Fund for the Tate, following All Hands to the Pumps in 1889, an uncommon compliment to the artist. It was followed by many other works by Tuke on similar themes, including Ruby, Gold and Malachite, exhibited at the RA in 1902. Pictures of naked youths outside of a classical context were not generally acceptable in this period, with a notable exception for depictions of bathing: another prominent example is Thomas Eakins' The Swimming Hole (1884-85). Tuke was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1900 and a full member of the Royal Academy of Arts in 1914. His work remained popular until the First World War ended the gilded age of late Victorian and Edwardian England. It is difficult to identify Tuke's models, due to his habit of interchanging heads and bodies in his paintings, but one was Maurice Clift, a nephew of a family friend, who was killed in France in the First World War. Another was the artist Lindsay Symington, who modelled for the boy holding onto the boat in the water. Tuke's work fell out of favour after the war, and Tuke died in 1929. His work regained popularity after it was discovered by a generation of openly gay art enthusiasts in the 1970s.

In 1868 Purcell joined the cast of the Rochester Opera House then under the management of John C. Meyers. Not long afterwards he married Meyer‚Äôs daughter, Flora, the company‚Äôs lead actress. In subsequent years Purcell and his father-in-law would manage tours starring Edwin Adams, Edwin Forrest and Charles Barron.

History Fresh Paint originated from a Microsoft Research project known as Project Gustav, an endeavor to reproduce the behavior of physical oil paint on a digital medium. To push the boundaries of simulating oil on a digital medium the research team created a physics model that precisely replicated on a screen what would happen in the real world if you combined oil, a surface and a tool such as a paint brush. Two publications, Detail-Preserving Paint Modeling for 3D Brushes and Simple Data- Driven Modeling of Brushes, were released as a result of the team‚Äôs findings. After a variety of internal testing Project Gustav was codenamed Digital Art. Partnering with The Museum of Modern Art, Digital Art was tested for a year by 60,000 people. With feedback culled from MoMA, developers expanded the existing physics model, experimenting with how real oil paint blended and reacted to the texture of a canvas. After final adjustments were made Digital Art was rebranded as Fresh Paint and released to the public with Windows 8 in October 2012. In 2016, the app was remade for Windows 10 computers.

Forming as a tropical depression on November 11 between Yap and Guam, the system moved westward and slowly intensified. It received the name Nepartak midday on November 12 from the Japan Meteorological Agency, becoming the 20th named storm of the 2003 Pacific typhoon season. On November 13, Napartak struck Samar in the Philippines and bisected the island chain. Up to four million people lost power, and transportation ground to a halt; over 5,000 individuals became stranded on ships forced to stay in port during the tropical storm. It was reported that 13 individuals lost their lives to the storm in the Philippines. After entering the open waters of the South China Sea, Nepartak continued to intensify and turned more toward the northwest. It attained its peak intensity on November 16, with maximum 10‚Äëminute sustained winds of 120 km/h (75 mph) and 1-minute winds of 140 km/h (85 mph). After weakening slightly, the storm found a weakness in the easterly steering currents and bore north, reintensifying slightly and directly striking southwestern Hainan. There, heavy rainfall and strong winds destroyed crops, livestock, and hundreds of homes, leaving $197 million (2003 USD) in damage. The storm rapidly deteriorated in the Gulf of Tonkin and dissipated as it neared mainland China. Meteorological history Nepartak originated in a region of strong thunderstorm activity, associated with a broad trough of low surface pressure, which was situated around 640 km (400 mi) southeast of Guam by 0000 UTC on November 11. With weak wind shear and modest divergence of air over the system, it began to mature, although initially the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) downplayed the potential for tropical cyclogenesis. Over the next several hours, a low-level circulation center became evident and convection organized around it, prompting the JTWC to issue an updated outlook. At 1800 UTC, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the storm as a tropical depression while it was located northeast of Yap in the Caroline Islands. The JTWC issued a tropical cyclone formation alert for the system at 2030 UTC, and designated it Tropical Depression 25W at 1200 UTC on November 12. The system intensified gradually as it began to track quickly westward toward the Philippines. The depression had found its way to the southwestern quadrant of a large anticyclone aloft, allowing for continued strengthening. Both the JMA and the JTWC upgraded the system to a tropical storm midday on November 12, when it gained the name Nepartak from the JMA. Simultaneously, the cyclone entered the area of responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration, which named it Tropical Storm Weng. Meteorologically, the storm began to exhibit improved outflow and deepening convection as it neared the central Philippines. At around 1600 UTC on November 13, Nepartak made landfall on northern Samar Island in the Philippines before traversing the remainder of the archipelago from east to west. The cyclone emerged into the South China Sea briefly weakened and with reduced forward motion, but quickly resumed its intensification trend as it turned more toward the northwest. Shortly thereafterat 0000 UTC on November 15the JTWC further upgraded 25W to a typhoon. Continuing generally toward the west-northwest under steering currents from a mid-level ridge to its north, Nepartak maintained its windspeeds throughout the day. With an improving appearance on satellite imagery, however, the storm gained some additional strength, and the JTWC estimated 25W to have attained its first peak intensity with maximum 1‚Äëminute sustained winds of 140 km/h (85 mph) at 0000 UTC on November 16. Later that day, the JMA determined Nepartak to have reached maximum 10-minute winds of 120 km/h (75 mph), placing it at typhoon status. The cyclonic envelope began to ingest dry air from its surroundings, and convection began to wane, leading to slight weakening as the storm approached the island of Hainan. A shortwave trough soon cut a weakness in the mid-level ridge which had previously suppressed Nepartak to the south, allowing the cyclone to curve north and enhancing outflow over the storm. By late on November 17, a small eye feature about 19 km (12 mi) in diameter had formed, and at 0000 UTC the next day it was situated just offshore southwestern Hainan. The cyclone's 1-minute winds increased once again to 140 km/h, marking its second and final peak at 0000 UTC on November 18. The JMA, however, maintained Nepartak as a severe tropical storm. The JTWC indicated that 25W made a second landfall on the coast of Hainan, although the JMA did not make such mention, implying Nepartak's center remained over the Gulf of Tonkin. Regardless, the cyclone's circulation had obscured most of Hainan and the Gulf of Tonkin and reached into adjacent Vietnam, and its forward speed slowed to a crawl. Extended interaction with land proved detrimental to the storm, and it began to rapidly disintegrate. Just 18 hours after its final bout of strengthening, Nepartak had been reduced to an exposed circulation center with no associated thunderstorms. Turning toward the northeast, the system had been concurrently downgraded to a tropical depression by the JTWC and JMA early on November 19. The weak remnant low of Nepartak limped ashore over Beihai, China at 1900 UTC and dissipated shortly thereafter. Impact On its first landfall, the tropical storm buffeted the eastern-central Philippines with damaging winds gusting up to 160 km/h (100 mph), heavy rainfall, and rough seas. At least 20 provinces experienced adverse or dangerous weather, with the worst conditions concentrated over the islands of Samar and Masbate. While structural and crop damages were limited, local infrastructure and transportation suffered the greatest. Nepartak's winds caused complete power outages on Samar, Masbate, and nearby Marinduque, affecting their entire collective population of nearly four million individuals. Many schools were closed. The storm forced the cancellation of nearly two dozen domestic flights to and from the region, and at least 120 ferries and other vessels sought shelter in ports around the Manila, Bicol, and Visayas regions. On those ships were more than 5,000 people who became stranded until safe passage could be made. By November 15, five deaths had been confirmed in the Philippines, four the result of electrocutions from downed powerlines. Immediately following the disaster, then-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo made assisting the stranded passengers in coastal ports a priority. According to the PAGASA in its post-storm report, a total of 13 people lost their lives, 5 others remained unaccounted for, and 11 sustained injuries. One newspaper reported that a motorized craft in the Ta√±on Strait capsized at the height of the storm, forcing the rescue of 11 people. Another source also describes the sinking of a boat with at least 13 survivors and one fatality. It is not clear whether these accounts cover the same incident. Nepartak inflicted widespread destruction on Hainan, including damage to farms and buildings. Most of the island was subject to strong winds and torrential rains, but the storm helped to relieve one of the worst summer droughts in almost 65 years. Due to the danger, shipping was halted in the Qiongzhou Strait between November 16 and 19. Nepartak impacted at least 1.72 million people on Hainan, compromised infrastructure, and impeded industry. The storm halted the operation of mines and rendered 72 highways temporarily unusable. Crops suffered extensively; of fields were damaged, reducing grain production by as much as 3,200 tons. In addition, 400 head of livestock were lost to the typhoon. With about 800 homes destroyed, damage on Hainan amounted to $197 million (2003 USD), and no fatalities were reported. Following the storm, a young male sperm whale weighing over 500 kg (1100 lb) washed ashore near Dongfang City on the island's southern shore, and died shortly after. Biologists speculated that the whale's demise may have been related to typhoon, although this was not confirmed. By the time the storm had begun to abate over Hainan, it was already nearly dissipated, and as a result produced few, if any, noticeable effects in mainland China. Across the Gulf of Tonkin, Vietnam had experienced deadly flooding in the week before Nepartak's approach, and the typhoon initially raised concerns about worsening the situation. Officials made preparations to minimize potentially exacerbating factors, and the cyclone remained far enough east to avoid seriously impacting the country.

The office was established on January 1, 1892, only 5 years after the city of Amarillo was founded. The office operates a WSR-88D (NEXRAD) radar and a number of ASOS sensor suites in order to monitor the latest weather conditions. An AWIPS system is used by the office to produce forecasts, warnings, and advisories. History The first Amarillo weather office was established by moving the Army Signal office from Fort Sill, Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). Mr. Wayland Bailey, Observer in Charge, relocated the office furnishings and instrumentation into the Amarillo Opera House which was located at the northwest corner of Polk and 5th streets. The instrumentation was located on the roof of this building. In this age of rapid weather dissemination of severe weather watches and warnings, Mr. Bailey did not have much foresight. In 1894, Mr. Bailey wrote in the local station log: \\"I respectfully recommend that cold wave signals and rain warnings be discontinued, as they are of little benefit to this community.\\" At that time, cold wave signals were generally issued after cold air had already arrived. The signals were disseminated in the form of a six by eight foot flag, which was raised at the weather office. Also, as is today, the Weather Bureau depended on local media such as the \\"Amarillo Champion\\" and the \\"Northwesterner\\" to relay this information to the public. By 1895, Mr. Bailey began to appreciate just how important forecasts and warnings were to the people of this region. Again he wrote in the station log: \\"The citizens of the town take considerable interest in the forecasts, but are more interested in the probable force and direction of the wind, which is the most important feature of the weather here.\\" More than one hundred years later, the same can be said today. Three more men held the title of Observer in Charge, until April 1902 when Mr. Peter Wood became the first Official in Charge. Mr. Wood opened Amarillo's first Weather Bureau building in June 1903 on the southeast corner of Taylor and Seventh Streets. This two-story building housed the weather office on its first floor, with quarters for the Official in Charge on the second floor. In November 1906, Mr. T.J. Considine took the reins of the Amarillo Weather Bureau and held them until he died in January 1925. Mr. Considine may have been Amarillo's first true weatherman because during his tenure, he recorded a wide variety of weather conditions. Mr. Considine wrote of winters that created snow drifts of four to five feet that suspended local street car service. He endured record breaking snowfalls that still stand in current record books. In 1908, perhaps the first Weather Bureau account of an Amarillo tornado was recorded on June 6. Mr. Considine wrote: \\"several funnel shaped clouds were quite noticeable, their distance from the station being between 2 to 3 miles. One of these tornadic conditions descended about two miles outside of town, damaging a dwelling house and a wind mill.\\" Through the early part of this century, the Weather Bureau in Amarillo continued to grow from a one-man station to one that employed several employees. By the early 1930s, the Bureau's focus began to shift to a rapidly growing aviation industry. A separate Weather Bureau Airport Station was established at English Field in 1932. The Weather Bureau later closed the station in 1935 and transferred airport observing responsibilities to the Civil Aeronautics Administration. The focus on aviation prompted the move of the Weather Bureau into the Department of Commerce in June 1940. In April 1941, the Weather Bureau closed its downtown office and consolidated all weather observing activities at the Amarillo Air Terminal. Mr. Henry Winburn became Amarillo's first Meteorologist in Charge and continued in that position until his death in 1962. Like Mr. Considine, Winburn dealt with a great many changes and problems. Amarillo Weather Bureau, June 1, 1903 With the outbreak of World War II, Mr. Winburn had to manage with a rapid change in personnel. The war created a shortage of personnel in an organization that was predominately staffed with male employees. A manpower shortage resulted in a large influx of women employees into the Bureau. The Amarillo office employed eleven female observers from the period of 1943 through 1946. However, the first female employee was Miss Angela Considine who was employed by her father as an assistant observer in 1920. Throughout the early history of the Weather Bureau, severe weather or tornado warnings were not issued. The Bureau felt that these warnings would do nothing more than panic the local populations. In fact, the word \\"tornado\\" was considered taboo until warnings were first issued in 1950. This policy did not deter Winburn who, in May 1949, pioneered broadcast warnings. Winburn went on the radio airwaves to warn Amarilloans of an impending tornado. Six persons died in the tornado, and a local newspaper was highly critical of Weather Bureau actions. An investigation revealed that the local office responded quite appropriately, especially considering the Weather Bureau policy on warnings. In fact, the local office received letters of commendation from the Chief of the Bureau and the Secretary of Commerce. Winburn was also involved in the implementation of the first operational weather radars. In 1952, a Radar Storm Detection Unit, which was a modified World War II Navy radar, was installed in Amarillo. Then, in 1961, one of the Weather Bureau's first network weather radars (WSR-57) was commissioned in Amarillo. Other rapid changes in technology were ushered in by Winburn, such as the installation of warning teletype communications in 1955, and the transfer of Upper Atmospheric (Radiosonde) observations to the local office in 1956. The Amarillo Weather Bureau office remained in the Amarillo Terminal until 1975. At that time, a new facility was constructed at 1920 English Road to house the ever expanding technology and usher in the computer age. By this time, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration had been created by the Department of Commerce, and the Weather Bureau became the National Weather Service. The office was moved to its present location of 1900 English Road in 1989. The new office was constructed to accommodate not only the latest advances in technology, but also a larger staff. Meteorologists were added to the staff, which resulted in forecasting responsibilities for the Texas and Oklahoma Panhandles. In 1992, an Automated Surface Observing System was commissioned, one of the first of its kind in the nation. A WSR-88D Doppler Weather Radar was commissioned in March 1994. This radar was the second commissioned in the country and the first in the state of Texas.

The Commander LANDCOM is the prime land warfare advisor to the Alliance. When directed by the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, it provides the core of the headquarters responsible for the conduct of land operations. The command is based at ≈ûirinyer (Buca), ƒ∞zmir in Turkey. History NATO has had a headquarters at Izmir for decades. Initially, the organization there was Allied Land Forces South-Eastern Europe (LANDSOUTHEAST), responsible to Allied Forces Southern Europe at Naples. Under this command, with its headquarters in Izmir assisted by the subordinate Thessaloniki Advanced Command Post, were to be most of the Greek and Turkish armies in case of war. LANDSOUTHEAST was commanded by a United States Army lieutenant general: *Lieutenant General Willard G. Wyman (1952‚Äì54) *Lieutenant General Paul W. Kendall (1954‚Äì55) *Lieutenant General George Windle Read, Jr. (1955‚Äì57) *Lieutenant General Paul D. Harkins (1957‚Äì60) In 1966 the first major change occurred when French military personnel were withdrawn from LANDSOUTHEAST, followed by the Greek withdrawal in 1974. On 30 December 1977, SHAPE and Turkish military authorities announced another change in the command structure of LANDSOUTHEAST, to be effective 1 July 1978. The command billet was to be filled by a Turkish Army four star general with a U.S. Major General as his deputy. U.S. General Sam S. Walker took command in 1977, and On 30 June 1978, General Walker handed over the command to General :tr:Vecihi Akƒ±n, the first Turkish commander. General Akƒ±n held command until 30 August 1979. Construction of a new headquarters facility in Sirinyer, Izmir was completed in March 1994 and LANDSOUTHEAST moved into the facility in April 1994. In July 1994, two German Army officers were assigned to the command for the first time. The headquarters garrison at Sirinyer was named General Vecihi Akin Garrison in March 1996, after the first Turkish LANDSOUTHEAST Commander. Turkish Land Forces General H√ºseyin Kƒ±vrƒ±koƒülu commanded LANDSOUTHEAST from c.1993‚Äì1996, followed by Hilmi √ñzk√∂k from 1996‚Äì1998. After the end of the Cold War, for a period the NATO command in Izmir became Joint Command Southeast. Between 11 August 2004 and 1 June 2013 the headquarters of NATO's Allied Air Component Command in the south, formerly known as AIRSOUTH, was located in ƒ∞zmir.

Only marginally slower than the Broadway Limited, it had no extra fare and for a time before World War II, carried more passengers than the Broadway Limited or the New York Central Railroad's 20th Century Limited. The General was inaugurated in 1937, and carried coaches and Pullmans. It received some new lightweight equipment in 1938 as part of the fleet of modernism, but it was mostly heavyweight until 1940. It was the only \\"Fleet of Modernism\\" train to be streamlined without an observation car. It lost its coaches when the Advance General was inaugurated in 1940. It was re-equipped with lightweight sleeping cars from both the pre- war Broadway, and new cars from post-war orders. At this time, it also carried the Broadway's pre-war View series observation cars. In 1951 the General lost its all-Pullman status when it was combined with the all-coach Trail Blazer for non-peak travel periods only. In 1952 this consolidation became permanent, and by 1960, the Trail Blazer name was dropped. In the late 1950s, the General also carried coaches and sleepers from Washington, DC, to Chicago via Harrisburg, when the PRR discontinued its Washington-Chicago Liberty Limited train.

She was modified for naval use and is now being operated by the Eastern Naval Command of the Indian Navy. Jyoti was the largest ship in the navy until INS Vikramaditya (R33) was commissioned in November 2013. Its primary role is fleet replenishment and sustaining blue- water operations. It was later fitted with close-in weapon systems for self- defence. It is a major force multiplier in sustaining the navy's blue water operations. It can increase the range of a naval task force without tanker support from seven days and 2400 nautical miles to 50 days and 16,800 nautical miles. Design and description = General characteristics and propulsion = INS Jyoti has a length of overall, a beam of and a draft of . The ships displaces about at full load. The complement is about 208, including 23 officers. The ship is powered by a steam turbine providing a power of . This allows the ship to reach a maximum speed of and an endurance of =Capacity= Displacing 39,900 tons at full load, Jyoti is the second largest ship of the navy, even larger than the decommissioned 28,500 tons aircraft carrier INS Viraat. The ship can carry 28,000 tons at full load, consisting of fuel diesel, aviation fuels, oils, and water of different grades. The fresh water carried for use in steam turbines is of much higher grade than drinking water. Jyoti has two replenishment positions on each side, with the option of stern refueling and can replenish three ships simultaneously. It can refuel at the rate of 300 tonnes per hour. It has a range of 12,000 nautical miles at the top speed of 15 knots. It has a double- skin hull, which prevents sea pollution in case of damage to any fuel tank, and carries eco-friendly equipment on board to prevent marine and environmental pollution. The space between the double-hull is used for ballast tanks. The fuel and water levels in the cargo tanks are checked to maintain the ship's stability during loading and discharging of supplies. =Armament= It was initially armed with light and medium machine guns. In 2000, self-defence capability was added by installing new close-in weapons like anti-aircraft and anti-missile guns and missiles. This was done to enhance the survivability of the ship during surface warfare operations on India's western seaboard. It also has a helicopter deck. Procurement and service INS Jyoti was constructed by the Admiralty Shipyard of St. Petersburg, Russia. It was built to be a Project 15966M merchant tanker, but was modified and purchased by the Indian Navy, and was commissioned on 20 July 1996. = Service history = INS Jyoti 1998 Growth in the India- Philippines relations broadened ways for the cooperation between navies.

On 28 March 1998, four civilian workmen were killed in a gas explosion on-board Jyoti at the naval dockyard. 2001 INS Jyoti and were deployed to South East Asia and South West Pacific. The ships made port calls at Fremantle, Sydney, Wellington and Ho Chi Minh City. 2003 INS Jyoti visited the Shanghai naval base in 2003 as part of a three-vessel fleet, for a five-day official visit. The fleet was commanded by flag officer Rear Admiral R. P. Suthan of India's Eastern Naval Command. It comprised a guided missile destroyer , a guided missile corvette and Jyoti. The fleet held airborne and surface search and rescue exercises with China's East Sea Fleet, which were code-named Dolphin 0311. Before the joint exercise, the Chinese and Indian ships also conducted maritime communication and formation maneuvers. These were the first joint naval exercises between China and India. The fleet left Shanghai on 14 November 2003. 2007 In early 2007, a fleet of ships from the navy's Eastern command conducted a two-month-long deployment in the South-East and East Asia. The ships, guided-missile destroyers , INS Rana and INS Ranjit, the guided-missile corvette, INS Kuthar and the fleet tanker INS Jyoti, were under the command of Flag Officer Commanding Eastern Fleet, Rear Admiral R K Dhowan. From 18 March to 23 May, the fleet made port-calls at a number of ports, including Singapore, Yokosuka in Japan, Qingdao located on the southern coast of the Shandong peninsula of China, Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam, and Vladivostok in Russia. The fleet left Qingdao on 16 April 2007, and then conducted joint anti-terror exercises with the Russian Navy. During September 2007, the navy deployed three ships - , INS Beas and INS Jyoti on a four-day goodwill mission to Oman, to strengthen maritime relations and develop maritime cooperation. The deployment was led by Rear Admiral Shekhar Sinha, Flag Officer Commanding of Western Naval Command. 2009 INS Jyoti in 2009 In 2009, Jyoti, along with INS Mumbai, INS Ranvir and INS Khanjar took part in an international fleet review at Qingdao, conducted by the China's People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) on its 60th anniversary. Twenty one naval vessels from 14 nations and delegations from 29 countries took part in the review, which lasted from 20 to 24 April. The fleet then proceeded to Okinawa in Japan, and took part in Malabar 2010 with the US Navy's Seventh fleet and the Japanese Maritime Self-Defense Force. The other ships were , guided missile destroyers and , fast-attack submarine of the US Navy, and two guided-missile destroyers, including of the JMSDF, along with various P-3C and SH-60 aircraft. The exercise involved air defence, anti- submarine and surface warfare. 2010 By 2010, the ship had completed thirteen years in the navy, during which it had undertaken 2504 underway replenishment runs and travelled 375,282 nautical miles. It had operated in the Indian Ocean, South China Sea, Red Sea, Persian Gulf and the Pacific Ocean and has participated in numerous multinational exercises with the navies of United States of America, South Korea, Philippines, Japan and Singapore etc. In April 2010, it took part in the 17th Singapore-Indian Maritime Bilateral Exercise (SIMBEX) with the Singapore Navy. SIMBEX-2010 was held in the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal. Five platforms of the Indian Navy took part, , a fast-attack craft and , a landing ship tank from the Andaman & Nicobar Command, destroyer , the tanker INS Jyoti and a submarine from the Eastern Naval Command. Singapore Navy was represented by two ships, , a Formidable- class frigate and , a Victory-class corvette. During the exercise, Jyoti simultaneously refueled INS Ranvir and RSS Intrepid. The fleet later called at Port Blair and Visakhapatnam. In May 2010, the navy‚Äôs Eastern Fleet deployed INS Jyoti, along with guided-missile destroyers INS Rana and INS Ranjit and missile corvette INS Kulish from Port Blair to South East Asia, where the fleet undertook passage exercises with the navies of Indonesia, Singapore and Australia. Jyoti was under the command of Captain A Venugopal NM and carried a complement of 19 officers and 170 sailors. The fleet sailed under the command of Flag Officer Commanding, Eastern Fleet, Rear Admiral P N Murugesan and made port calls at Jakarta (Indonesia), Hai Phong (Vietnam), Manila (Philippines), Muara (Brunei), Bangkok (Thailand), Fremantle (Australia), Singapore and Port Kelang (Malaysia). At Port Kelang, the fleet conducted anti-piracy exercises with the Malaysian Navy from 20 to 23 June, and left port on 23 June. 2011 Corvette INS Kirch (P62) and fleet tanker INS Jyoti (A58) of the Indian Navy with a frigate of the Singaporean Navy during SIMBEX 2011 in the South China Sea. In early 2011, the ship was part of a fleet of warships from the Eastern Fleet which went on an operational deployment in South East Asia and Western Pacific. The flotilla was composed of , INS Ranvijay, INS Ranvir, INS Jyoti and INS Kirch, and carried 1,400 naval personnel on board. They were commanded by Rear Admiral Harish Chandra Singh Bisht. The flotilla, along with an Indian Navy maritime reconnaissance aircraft took part in a five-day exercise SIMBEX 2011 with the Singapore navy in the South China Sea. Four naval ships including a submarine of the Singapore Navy were commanded by Rear Admiral Joseph Leong, Fleet Commander of the Republic of Singapore Navy. The Indian fleet then proceeded on its forward deployment, and made port calls at Alava pier in Subic Bay (Philippines), Vlapostok (Russia), Manila (Philippines), Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam), Bandar Sera Begawan (Brunei), Kota Kina Balu (Malaysia) and Jakarta (Indonesia). The ships also visited China, Japan and South Korea. After exercising with the U.S. Navy, the fleet conducted drills at Vladivostok, with the Russian Navy's Pacific Fleet. This was the second time the Indian Navy had made a port call at Vladivostok. From 2‚Äì10 April, the ship, as part of the flotilla took part in the Malabar 2011 exercise with the U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet. In May 2011, Jyoti and Ranvir, led by Captain Sunil Balakrishnan, were deployed to Brunei, and docked at Muara port. The purpose of the visit was to build on cultural and diplomatic relations between the two countries.

Although the train was considered all-Pullman, it frequently carried coaches on the end for day travelers going to Pittsburgh and back. In 1944, the Pittsburgher was discontinued as part of a government order that prohibited the use of sleeping cars between points less than apart so the government could free up sleeping cars for the war effort. The next day, it was reinstated as a day train between the two points. By late 1945, it was back to running as an overnight, all-Pullman train between New York and Pittsburgh.

Its primary service operated from the Braintree MBTA station to Hyannis on Cape Cod; branches to Attleboro and Falmouth also operated in some years. The service ended after the 1988 summer season amid early-1989 state budget cuts in Massachusetts; much of the same trackage is being used for the seasonal CapeFLYER service.  History upright=0.6 The Cape Cod & Hyannis Railroad began running Hyannis - East Sandwich excursion service in 1981. Excursion service to Falmouth was added in 1982 and 1983. In 1984, the state provided $148,000 in funding to allow the railroad to provide an otherwise-unsubsidized demonstration of regional service connecting to the newly completed Red Line rapid transit line at Braintree. Service between Braintree and the Cape Cod destinations of Hyannis and Falmouth began on June 30, 1984. Trains ran from Braintree to Hyannis and Falmouth. (Service directly to Boston was not possible because the Neponset River bridge had been destroyed by a 1960 fire; a new Neponset River bridge was not opened until Old Colony Lines commuter service began in 1997. Intermediate stops initially included Holbrook, Brockton, Bridgewater, Middleboro, Wareham, and Buzzards Bay, plus Sandwich and West Barnstable on Hyannis trains. The two daily round trips - one to each Cape Cod terminal - were the first regular service between the Boston area and the Cape in 25 years. Braintree-Hyannis trips took three hours. Falmouth service (which ended quickly in 1984) and mid-week runs were dropped due to low ridership. During mid-1985, the railroad operated two round trips on Saturdays and Sundays, with two round trips on Fridays and Mondays for parts of the summer. Running time was reduced to 2 hours; ridership rose from 8,000 passengers in 1984 to 19,000 in 1985. In 1986, the state approved a $5.5 million multi-year subsidy for seven-day-a-week seasonal service. The railroad's insurance premiums skyrocketed, causing service to be delayed until mid-July. Despite the delay, ridership still increased. The state continued to subsidize weekday service for the next two years. Branch line service to Falmouth via a new stop at Cataumet resumed in 1988, along with a new branch to Attleboro via Taunton. Subsidies were cut from the state budget in 1989, and the CC&HR; did not resume service in 1989. In its final year of operation, the CC&HR; carried 53,000 passengers between Braintree and Cape Cod, with an additional 6,700 riders on the Attleboro branch. State audits in 1989 and 1990 showed that the family owners of the CC&HR; had substantially profited from the subsidies, partially due to a lack of state oversight. Seasonal Amtrak Cape Codder service, which had begun in 1986, continued until 1996. The Bay Colony Railroad begin operating excursion Service between Hyannis and Sagamore until the Cape Cod Railroad brand in 1989; the Cape Cod Central Railroad took over excursion service between Hyannis and Buzzards Bay in 1999. Commuter service between Boston and Middleborough resumed in 1997 when the MBTA Commuter Rail Old Colony Lines were restored.

The annual Guerra del Golfo main event consists of three matches in total, with two \\"qualifying matches\\", multi-man steel cage matches where the last person left in the cage advances to the main event of the night. The two losers is forced to wrestle inside the steel cage, with the loser being forced to either take off their wrestling mask or have their hair shaved off under Lucha de Apuesta, or \\"Bet match\\" rules. Production =Background= Starting as far back as at least 2000, the Mexican wrestling promotion International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG; Sometimes referred to as Grupo Internacional Revoluci√≥n in Spanish) has held several annual events where the main event was a multi-man steel cage match where the last wrestler left in the cage would be forced to either remove their wrestling mask or have their hair shaved off under Lucha de Apuestas, or \\"bet match\\", rules. From 2005 IWRG has promoted a spring time show promoting the steel cage match concept under the name Guerra del Golfo, or \\"Gulf War\\", referring to the Gulf of Mexico, not the Gulf War in the middle east. The Gurerra del Golfo shows featured two \\"qualifying\\" steel cage matches where the loser would later be forced to face off against each other in the main event of the show, a final cage match where the loser would be forced to either unmask or have his/her hair shaved off. The use of the steel cage in three matches distinguishes the Guerra del Golfo event from other Steel cage matches held throughout the year such as the IWRG El Castillo del Terror (\\"The Tower of Terror\\"), IWRG Guerra de Sexos (\\"War of the Sexes\\") or IWRG Prison Fatal (\\"Deadly Prison\\") shows. The Guerra del Golfo shows, as well as the majority of the IWRG shows in general, are held in \\"Arena Naucalpan\\", owned by the promoters of IWRG and their main arena. The 2012 Castillo del Terror show was the sixth year IWRG promoted a show under that name and the fifth year in a row since becoming an annual event from 2008 forward. =Storylines= The event featured five professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. The Main Event was a 12-Man Steel Cage Match. The last two wrestlers who remained in the ring fought one on one in a Lucha de Apuestas Match (\\"Bet match\\"), wagering their mask on the outcome of the match. The event included wrestlers from International Wrestling Revolution Group (IWRG) as well as a number of Mexican freelance wrestlers. In the summer of 2011 the group Los Oficiales introduced a new member called Oficial Spartan, replacing Oficial AK-47, who was unable to wrestle due to an arm injury, in his first match to team up with Oficial 911 and Oficial Fierro. In the fall of 2011 the original Oficiales kicked Spartan out of the group he cost their team a number of matches due to disqualifications. Spartan would return with back up in the form of Oficial Rayan, forming a group called Los Oficiales Elite to start a rival faction to Los Oficiales. In early 2012 Los Oficiales Elite became a trio with the introduction of Oficial Factor to the team. Event The opening match, a tag team match between the team of Guerrero Mixtico, Jr. and Matrix, Jr. and the team of Galaxy and Star Boy, Jr., ended after Galaxy dislocated his shoulder and his opponents quickly pinned him to end the match. The second match was originally scheduled to have Trit√≥n team up with Chicano, but due to injuries IWRG decided to replace him with Star Boy, Jr. and have the team of Star Boy, Jr. and Chicano defeat Pacto Negro and The Mummy. The third match of the night was a continuation of the Oficiales vs. Oficiales Elite storyline as two members from each team faced off, Los Oficiales (Oficial 911 and Oficial Fierro) teamed up with Toxico while Oficial Rayan and Oficial Spartan teamed up with veteran wrestler Negro Navarro. Los Oficials Elite won the third and deciding fall when 911 intentionally unmasked Spartan, which is against the rules of Lucha Libre. The first of the \\"qualifying\\" steel cage matches featured nine wrestlers, eight male (Comando Negro, Damian 666, El Hijo del Diablo, Hijo de Pirata Morgan, Oficial Factor, Tony Rivera, Trauma I and X-Fly) and a single female competitor (Ludark Shaitan). The match saw Oficial Factor as the last remaining wrestler in the ring, which meant he was forced to put his mask on the line later on in the show's main event. The second match started out with nine competitors just like the other steel cage match, and again included eight male (Oficial AK-47, Alan Extreme, Bestia 666, Bombero Infernal, Carta Brava, Jr., Halloween, Sexy Lady, Trauma I and Zumbi) and one female (Sexy Lady) competitor. In the latter parts of the match AK-47's partners 911 and Fierro came to the ring and entered the cage, trying to help AK-47 defeat Trauma I. Moments later Trauma I's brother Trauma II came to the ring and also entered the cage. In the end Oficial 911 ended up losing the match instead of one of the scheduled competitors. Like Oficial Factor he was forced to put his mask on the line in the main event steel cage match. The main event looked to conclude with either Oficial Factor or Oficial 911 unmasking, but as the match was about to begin Factor was joined by his Los Oficiales Elite partners Spartan and Rayan while 911 was joined by AK-47 and Fierro to make it a six- man match where everyone but AK-47 risked their mask and AK-47, since he was already unmasked, risked his hair on the outcome of the match. After a long and brutal match it came down to Factor and AK-47 with Oficial Factor escaping the cage. As a result, Oficial AK-47 was shaved bald afterwards even if he was not the announced participant at the beginning of the match. =Results= Aftermath The feud between the two Oficiales factions continued throughout 2012 with several highlights, including Oficial AK-47 winning the vacant IWRG Intercontinental Middleweight Championship in a tournament, which saw him defeat Oficial Spartan in the quarter final. Oficial Factor won the 2012 Rey del Ring tournament, defeating 29 other wrestlers including members of Los Oficiales. On July 26, 2012 Los Oficiales ended Oficiales Elite's reign as Distrito Federal Trios Champions after 129 days. In the fall of 2012 Oficiales Elite changed their name to Los Comandos √âlite, but the feud with Los Oficiales remained as intense as ever and led to both Oficial 911 and Factor being part of the main event Prison Fatal match on the 2012 IWRG show called Prison Fatal, where Factor would lose to Hijo de Pirata Morgan.

Most of these early immigrants moved to the islands as laborers to work on the pineapple, coconut, and sugarcane plantations. These early migrants have tended to stay, although a handful returned to their home countries. There has also been recent immigration to Hawaii from more ethnic Asian groups, including the Thai, Indonesian, and the Vietnamese. Filipinos Filipinos, like most other Southeast Asian immigrants to Hawaii, worked on the sugar plantations. In 2010, Filipinos surpassed Japanese as the largest ethnic group. At the time of the 2000 census, they were the third largest ethnic group in the islands. 85% of Filipinos in Hawaii trace their ancestry to the Ilocos Region of northern Luzon. Japanese Until 2010, people of Japanese ancestry made up the plurality of Hawaii's population. After the breakout of World War II, more than 110,000 Japanese Americans in the mainland U.S., who mostly lived on the West Coast, were forced into internment camps. However, in Hawai'i, where 150,000-plus Japanese Americans composed over one-third of the population, only 1,200 to 1,800 were also interned.Ogawa, Dennis M. and Fox, Jr., Evarts C. Japanese Americans, from Relocation to Redress. 1991, page 135. Korean Koreans mainly came to the islands to work on the pineapple and sugar plantations, but a few, including the family of Mary Paik Lee, came to the mainland (usually California) after experiencing extreme discrimination. Chinese The Chinese discovered the Hawaiian islands in 1778; the same year as English explorer James Cook. Few also came to the islands among the crew of James Cook. Today, some Chinese born on the islands can claim to be seventh generation. 75% of Hawaii‚Äôs Chinese community are Cantonese with ancestry from Zhongshan, Guangdong. Indians People of Indian origin did not come to Hawaii in sizable numbers, and those who did did not stay for long. Many early Indian immigrants stopped in Hawaii only to make enough money to sail on to the mainland anywhere from the mid to late 1800s to the 1900s. A notable Indian in Hawaii was Dalip Singh Saund, who on September 13, 1910, arrived in Honolulu from his home village in Punjab, India at the age of 14. He labored in the sugarcane fields for about two months to earn enough money to continue on to California. On November 18, 1910, he arrived on Angel Island. At one point, Saund was the nation's largest celery grower.  Okinawans  When Japan annexed Okinawa (formerly known as the Ryukyu Kingdom), the Okinawan economy started to decline. As a result, there was a growing demand for the Japanese government to allow Okinawans to migrate elsewhere. The first of these Okinawans came to Hawaii in 1899 under the supervision of Kyuzo Toyama, who is known as the ‚Äúfather of Okinawan emigration‚Äù. Okinawans in Hawaii tend to view themselves as a distinct group from the Japanese in Hawaii. The Center for Okinawan Studies at the University of Hawai ªi (MƒÅnoa) estimates that the Okinawan community numbers anywhere between 45,000-50,000 people, or 3% of Hawaii‚Äôs population.

Formed in 1995, they were signed to Mind Horizon Recordings, a subsidiary of London Records, on which they released their first and only album, Cycles (2000), which saw radio success from its singles \\"Flatspin\\" and \\"Long Way to Climb\\".  History  Lisp was formed in East London in 1995, with the lineup including former Disco Inferno bassist Paul Willmott on keyboard, vocalist Johnnie Gordon, guitarist Brad Rubinstein, bassist Jason Hall, and drummer Adam Rich. The band was signed to the London Records subsidiary Mind Horizon Recordings in 1999 by Pete Tong, through which they released their first single, \\"Flatspin\\", in September of that year. Their second single, \\"Long Way to Climb\\", was even more popular, getting airplay on XFM. In November, the band played a show at the club Scala in King's Cross, London. The full album, Cycles, was released on 17 April 2000. The group disbanded in 2001, in part because Rubinstein's then-nascent return to Orthodox Jewish faith made it difficult for him to attend shows that fell on religious holidays. Following the breakup, Rubinstein moved to Israel, where he co-founded with rapper Ori Murray the Jewish hip hop/rock group Shtar.  Musical style  Lisp's music combined a rock sound with such additional touches as a string quartet and Paul Willmott's electronic musical instruments. The singles \\"Flatspin\\" and \\"Long Way to Climb\\" were compared to what AllMusic's Andy Kellman called \\"completely unrelated bands\\", such as Massive Attack and Portishead. Another Allmusic writer, Dean Carlson, compared Cycles to \\"a trip-hop Depeche Mode, or British baggy after a lecture marathon on Schwarzschild geometry\\" and described the band's musical structures as \\"ambitious\\".

Background  Bundang was developed to tackle soaring housing prices and excessive concentration in Seoul in the late 1980s. The political and social factors of the middle class also played an important role. Therefore, the development of the new city in Bundang started with the dual purpose of expanding housing supply and fostering the middle class.  Tancheon  Tancheon is a stream flowing through the central part of Seongnam in Gyeonggi-do. It is a tributary of the Han River and their confluence is near Seoul. Tancheon is a fast-moving river with an area of and a total length of . There are also multiple projects underway to support the Tancheon River. The Tancheon Project, Night Workshop, is a collection of city projects to bolster the popularity of the Tancheon through sponsoring local arts. In the late 1990s, development projects in Yongin caused the water quality of Tancheon to sharply deteriorate due to a large amount of domestic sewage and soil from the construction site. Recently, Seongnam City and Yongin City in Gyeonggi Province have been carrying out ecological river restoration projects, and the surrounding landscape and water quality of Tancheon are gradually improving.  Traffic development  In the future, it will be possible to use the new district rail service at the Munggum Station (Seongnam, Gyeonggi-do), where only the existing Bundang Line has operated. The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport announced on that it completed the construction of the Shinbun-dong Subway Station, which commenced in December 2012. The Munjem Station is located between Sinbun Dynasty and Jeongja Station and Dongcheon Station. Currently, it is used only as a stopping station for Bundang Line, but in the future can be used for Shinbang Dynasty and Bundang Line.

Modern Wales no longer employs these units even for customary purposes but instead follows the custom as elsewhere in Britain of using a mixture of metric and Imperial units. Length In the Venedotian Code used in Gwynedd, the units of length were said to have been codified by Dyfnwal Moelmud but retained unchanged by Hywel Dda. The code provided for computing the units variously, as well as deriving them from grains of barley. In measuring milk and its legal worth ('), disputes over the length of the inch used in the container were to be resolved by the width of the judge's thumb. The code notes that in some areas of Wales, the rod used to compute the Welsh acre (') was not reckoned from feet but taken to be \\"as long as the tallest man in the [tref], with his hand above his head\\". * 3 barleycorns ( ', ') = 1 inch * 3 inches ( ', ') = 1 palm * 3 palms ( ', ') = 1 foot * 3 feet ( ', ', \\"footlength\\") = 1 pace * 4 feet = 1 short yoke ( ' or ', ') * 3 paces (') = 1 leap * 8 feet = 1 field yoke ( ') or second yoke ( ') * 12 feet = 4 paces = 1 lateral yoke ( ' or ') * 3 leaps ( ', ') = 1 land * 16 feet = 1 long yoke ( ', ') = rod ( ', ') * 1000 lands ( ', ') = 1 mile ( ', ') Area In the Venedotian Code used in Gwynedd, the basic field unit was the Welsh acre or erw, whose legal description‚Äîits breadth as far as a man can reach in either direction with an ox-goad as long as the long yoke (16 Welsh feet) and its length \\"thirty times that measure\\"‚Äîis noted by Owen as ambiguous. He finds it more likely, however, that the \\"measure\\" to be multiplied thirty times is the width of the acre (that is, two long yokes) rather than a single long yoke. Thus, at least in theory, * 2 rods √ó 30 rods = 1 acre ‚âà 1,440 square imperial yards, or 2 rods √ó 60 rods = 1 acre ‚âà 4,320 square imperial yards * 4 acres ( ', ', \\"tilled [land]\\"; ) = 1 homestead * 4 homesteads ( ', ') = 1 shareland * 4 sharelands ( ', ') = 1 holding * 4 holdings ( ', ') = 1 township * 4 townships ( ', ') = 1 manor * manors ( ', ') = 1 commote * 2 commotes ( ', ') = 1 cantref = 25,600 acres although in fact the commutes and cantrefs were fixed political entities with quite various sizes. The 11th-century Bleddyn ap Cynfyn is also described as having changed the legal composition of the homestead for purposes of inheritance and so on, varying its size depending on the social status of the owner. The homestead of a nobleman (') was 12 Welsh acres, that of a serf ( ', ') had 8, and that of a bondsman or slave ( ') had 4. The text, however, notes the uncommonness of this division and says it was generally understood as 4 acres regardless of status. In the Dimetian Code used in southern Wales, the same divisions were reckoned differently: * 2 rods √ó 18 rods = 1 acre * 312 acres = 1 shareland * 3 sharelands held by serfs = 1 serf-town * 4 sharelands held in freehold = 1 free town * 7 serf-towns (') = 1 lowland manor ( ', ') = 936 acres * 12 free towns ( ', ') = 1 upland manor ( ', ') = 1248 acres Volume * 1 Hestawr = 2 Winchester bushels Time The Welsh seem to have used an eight- or nine-day week, rather than a seven-day one, long after their conversion to Christianity.

In ≈Ωabja Vas there are two ponds in pits that were dug for the former brickworks at Cegelnica. Name The name Zadvor is a fused prepositional phrase that has lost its case inflection, from za 'behind' + dvor 'manor'. The name thus literally means 'behind the manor'. The word dvor is a relatively common toponym element in Slovenia and, in addition to 'manor', may also refer to a farm with outbuildings, an estate, a (fenced-in) courtyard, or a barnyard, as well as a medieval agricultural estate comprising up to 40 farms. In this case, the name refers to a property owned by lesser nobility in the 11th and 12th centuries. The estate was later divided among the family members, who pursued farming. The settlement was known as Saduor in German. Annexation Zadvor was annexed by the city of Ljubljana in 1982, ending its existence as an independent settlement.Spremembe naselij 1948‚Äì95. 1996.

These forests consist of thick stands of evergreen oaks on shallow depressions or slight hills. They are distinct from their surrounding habitats, which are often woodlands dominated by longleaf pine. Mesic hammocks Mesic hammocks, also known as oak hammock, or cabbage palm hammock, grow on moist soils that are rarely flooded. There is typically a dense layer of leaf litter, and the sandy soils are relatively rich. Mesic hammocks in the central part of the Florida peninsula have a lower diversity of tree species than do those to the north and south, as the ranges of most deciduous hardwoods found in northern Florida do not extend south of about Orlando, and the ranges of the tropical hardwoods found in southern Florida do not extend as far north as Lake Okeechobee. Common species are southern live oak (Quercus virginiana), Pignut Hickory (Carya glabra), American Sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua), sand laurel oak (Quercus hemisphaerica), and American persimmon (Diospyros virginiana). The understory is sparse, with trumpet creeper (Campsis radicans) and greenbrier (Smilax spp). =Cabbage palm-live oak hammocks= Cabbage palm-live oak hammocks, also known as prairie hammocks, are a sub-type of mesic hammocks composed principally of live oak and cabbage palm trees. They also occur in central and southern Florida in prairies and floodplains, on river levees, and on slopes between dry uplands and wetlands, and are the transition between subtropical and tropical forests releves. Xeric hammocks Xeric hammocks, also known as xeric forests, sand hammocks, live oak forests, oak woodlands, or oak hammocks, grow on old sand dunes that are very well drained. The most common canopy tree in xeric hammocks is the sand live oak, (Quercus geminata). Other species of scrub oak and pine are also found in xeric hammocks. Plants that are typical of scrub or sandhill communities, particularly palmetto, are found under the canopy. Xeric hammocks are somewhat resistant to fire, but a fire that becomes established in a hammock will destroy it. Related communities The southern coastal plain upland hardwood forest has more diverse upland hardwood trees and tends to be found farther north.

The northwestern quadrant of the city lies mainly in the Appalachian Piedmont region, marked by moderate to steep hills underlain by metamorphic rocks of Ordovician through Devonian age, similar to the adjacent Piedmont regions of Montgomery County, Maryland. The National Mall, northeastern and southeastern quadrants of Washington lie in the mid-Atlantic Coastal Plain region, consisting of sedimentary deposits laid down during the much more recent Tertiary and Quaternary periods, like the bordering areas of southern Maryland. Some areas in Northeast and Southeast Washington also feature hilly terrain, especially east of the Anacostia River; this however stems from rivers and creeks down-cutting into the relatively soft soil. City founders George Washington and Pierre L'Enfant chose to locate the District of Columbia on the fall line of the Potomac River, the point furthest inland reachable by ships coming up the river. (See also Atlantic Seaboard fall line.) Below Roosevelt Island, the Potomac spills out onto the Coastal Plain, leaving the rock formations of Great Falls and the rocky cliffs of the Arlington, Virginia shore behind as it slows and widens. The Tidal Basin and the Washington Channel are part of this wider section of the river. Much of the National Mall was marsh in the early Nineteenth century; as the capital city grew, the marsh was filled in and reclaimed. References Washington, D.C.

It is best known for its breeding colony of several thousand pairs of emperor penguins on sea ice at the south-west corner of the bay. Description The bay is positioned south- west of the Brattstrand Bluffs, between the Vestfold Hills about 75 km to the north-east and the Larsemann Hills 22 km to the south-west. It is about 6 km long and 3 km wide, and opens north-west into the much larger Prydz Bay. The south-west side of the bay is flanked by the Flatnes Ice Tongue with Cowell Island at its western corner. The eastern and southern sides are bounded by the ice cliffs of the Hovde Glacier, with Hovde Island in the north-east. There are small islets within the bay and several unnamed islands a few kilometres offshore. The bay is generally filled with fast ice, even during summer. History The coastline in the vicinity of the bay was first seen and named the Ingrid Christensen Coast by Captain Mikkelsen of the Norwegian ship Thorshavn on 20 February 1935. Oblique aerial photographs of the coastline were taken on a Lars Christensen financed expedition in 1937 as well as by the US Navy's Operation Highjump in 1947 for reconnaissance purposes. In the 1954-55 summer, the Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition (ANARE) explored the waters of Prydz Bay on the Kista Dan. The first recorded landing in the area was made on 5 February 1955 on Lichen Island by a sledging party led by Phillip Law. Further aerial photography was undertaken by ANARE from 1957 to 1960, with the first recorded visit to the bay taking place in August 1957 by a surveying party from Davis Station. During the return flight the area was photographed and named Amanda Bay after the newly-born daughter of the pilot, RAAF Squadron Leader Peter Clemence.

He exhibited at Kunsthal Charlottenborg and Den Frie Udstilling with individual portraits, such as that of Georg Brandes (Georg Brandes at the University in Copenhagen, 1889), and landscapes, which often featured a prominent spot. A change in style occurred in the early 1890s as can be seen in his portrait of the sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen, in which her fair hair is covered with gold, as are the cornfields in one of his landscapes. Then followed a series of painting which ensured him a place as one of the principal participants in 1890 painting: Tre kvinder (Three Women), Foraaret (Spring), and his strikingly symbolic work Primavera (1901). Slott-M√∏ller is remembered for his portraits of well-known figures from Southern Jutland and South Schleswig, often characterized with customized backgrounds such as a landscape or appropriate buildings.\\"Flensborghus\\" , Gr√¶nseforeningen.

Although he continued to paint, opinions about his work became ever less supportive, partly on artistic grounds but also as a result of his attitude towards the public. In 1919, he became a Knight of the Dannebrog. He was a founding member of Den Frie Udstilling (The Free Exhibition). He is buried at Holmens Cemetery.

This issue is recognised and addressed by Article 11 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities which states: > \\"States Parties shall take, in accordance with their obligations under > international law, including international humanitarian law and > international human rights law, all necessary measures to ensure the > protection and safety of persons with disabilities in situations of risk, > including situations of armed conflict, humanitarian emergencies and the > occurrence of natural disasters.\\" Research There is limited research knowledge, but many anecdotal reports, on what happens when disasters impact people with disabilities. Individuals with disabilities may be greatly affected by natural disasters. Those with physical disabilities can be at risk when evacuating if assistance is not available. Individuals with cognitive impairments may struggle with understanding instructions that must be followed in the event a disaster occurs. Those who are blind, hearing impaired, etc. may have difficulty communicating during the emergency. All of these factors can increase the degree of variation of risk in disaster situations with disabled individuals. Discrimination Some research studies have found discrimination against individuals with disabilities during all phases of the disaster cycle. The most common limitation is that people cannot physically access buildings or transport, as well as access disaster-related services. The exclusion of these individuals is caused in part by the lack of disability-related training provided to emergency planners and disaster relief personnel. Disability in disaster management planning Disability as a factor in disaster planning is an issue that is receiving attention from some disaster management jurisdictions while various disability rights organizations are active in lobbying and education efforts for authorities to include the needs of disabled members of the public in their planning.Project REDD at Texas A&M; University http://redd.tamu.edu/project-redd-research-and-education-on- disability-and-disaster The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) has influenced initiatives like The Sphere Project to include more disability related guidelines and recognise the different approaches required for different disabilities. In rural and lower income countries and areas, there is a gap between those who need financial and human resources and those who get it, thus those with disability do not receive the services that they need.

The rocket lifted off from Odyssey at 06:56 UTC on February 1, 2013, however shortly afterwards Sea Launch issued a statement that the launch failed \\"approximately 40 seconds after liftoff\\", during first stage flight. Initial indications are that the rocket's first stage engine was intentionally shut down after the vehicle went out of control. Intelsat stated that they were \\"clearly disappointed with the outcome of the launch\\". Sea Launch's Failure Review Oversight Board (FROB) found that the problem was in the hydraulic power supply unit in the Zenit-3SL's first stage.

Upeksha does not mean indifference. It is the fourth element of true love and has as its seed the wisdom of equality that removes all boundaries, discrimination and prejudices while leading to the sublime unity where there is no self and no other; without Upeksha, love becomes possessive. Equanimity or Upeksha grows out of mindfulness, then one becomes master of every situation no matter what the situation is without it one cannot take anything in one‚Äôs stride; its significance is that one really lives unconditionally. The understanding that our happiness and that of others is inseparable moves us directly into the fourth Brahmavihara, Upeksha. Equanimity of Upeksha carries the ability to take a large view and to look over the whole situation not bound by one side or the other, its near-enemy is in-difference which is difficult to recognise because it masquerades on the surface as even-mindedness; indifference causes retreat to a form of denial like repression, don‚Äôt care-can‚Äôt be bothered attitude. In Yoga, ma√Ætri, karuna, mudita and upeksha are only different aspects of universal sympathy, which remove all perversities in our nature and unite us with our fellow-men. This is the positive aspect of the mind with reference to abstinence from injuring (ahimsa) which will cleanse the mind and make it fit for ≈öraddhƒÅ etc., prepare it to become steady with a view to attaining true discriminative knowledge. It is a karmasthana that holds a very high place in sadhana. Like equality in Bhagavad Gita, upeksha of the Buddhists operates on many levels, and ten kinds of upeksha are enumerated; it is the equality called the six- limbed upeksha which renounces all the creaturely reactions of the six senses when anything agreeable or disagreeable presents itself. Samadhi may also involve the cultivation of the four states called Brahmaviharas which four states are - \\"goodwill\\" (ma√Ætri), \\"compassion\\" (karuna), \\"sympathetic joy\\" (mudita) and \\"equanimity\\" (upeksha). Practised to perfection these states take one to pure the mind-states on the plane of formlessness that are proximate to the apex of existence. Upeksha as a power includes freedom from all kinds of desires and birth because it has no preference for one thing more than the other. It is opposed to individuality. This power manifests as ten kinds which are ‚Äì * Sadangopeksha (when there is neither pleasure nor displeasure) * Brahma-wiharopeksha (when the mind is equally affected towards all beings) * Bowdyangopeksha (when the mind is equally affected towards all thoughts) * Wiryopeksha (when the mind is equally affected by the same force of determination) * Sankharopeksha (when the mind is equally affected towards all kinds of wisdom) * Wedanopeksha (when the mind is sensible to neither pleasure nor pain) * Widarsanopeksha (when the mind is not affected by what is seen) * Tatramadyastopeksha (when all modes of upeksha are applied together) * Dhyanopeksha (when the impermanency of sensible-objects is regarded with an even mind) * Parisudi-upeksha (when the mind is equally affected towards all that is necessary to secure freedom from the cleaving to existence). All upekshas may be possessed by one and the same person but the second cannot be possessed without the first. According to the Theosophists, maitri, karuna, mudita and upeksha are the four qualities of a Jivanmukta who favours Sishya (\\"disciple\\") who attains mukti, Bhakta (\\"devotee\\") who gains his noble ends, Udasina (\\"indifferent person\\") who begins to cherish love for virtuous deeds and Pathaka (a \\"sinner\\") whose sins are purged, and whose lakshanas are akkrodha (\\"absence of hatred\\"), arogya (\\"sound health\\"), jitendriyathawam (\\"conquest of passions\\"), daya (kindness), kshama (forbearance), janapriyathawa (popularity), alobha (\\"absence of avarice\\"), dathruthawa (generosity), abhaya (courage) and nairmalaya (cleanliness). Along with the four upayas (sama, dana, bheda and danda) that were then the recognised expedients for application of foreign policy Kamandaka and others had recommended application of Upeksha, Maya and Indrajala in diplomacy; the enemy could be warded off or neutralised by a policy of Upeksha and absolute indifference to even movements of enemy troops.

The railway was the longest in Venezuela. It proved difficult to recoup the initial investment and the railway became a notable cause of the Venezuelan crisis of 1902‚Äì1903. It fell into disrepair through the early 20th century and the last train ran in 1966. Origin Friedrich Krupp AG contracted with the Venezuelan government in 1888 to build the railway in exchange for ¬£12,800 per kilometer to be repaid at 7 percent interest. Disconto-Gesellschaft financed the project; and terms were renegotiated at ¬£11,000 per kilometer in 1891. The railway was completed in February 1894.The Railway News volume 84 (26 August 1905) p.402 Description The railway replaced a difficult carriage road through mountainous terrain. Contemporary accounts expressed great praise for the construction, which used Krupp steel railroad ties.Moore, Joseph Hampton (1907) With Speaker Cannon through the Tropics p.192 The Caracas station was adjacent to the gauge railway to the coast at La Guaira (closed 1951). The railway west entered the Calvario tunnel for level grade to Ant√≠mano where a 2 percent climb began to a summit in Corozal tunnel from Caracas. From Corozal tunnel the railway required 212 Krupp steel viaducts and 84 tunnels to cover of gently descending grade across steep canyons to reach the fertile valley of Lake Valencia. The viaduct over Agua Amarillo was the longest on the line and stood above the water.United States Department of Commerce and Labor Consular Reports issues 196-199 (1897) Railroads of Venezuela pp.470-472 The Valencia terminus was at San Blas, but the line was eventually connected to the Puerto Cabello and Valencia railway which had its own terminus at Camoruco. By 1922 the railway had 18 locomotives, 30 passenger cars, 68 flatcars, and 20 stock cars.Purl Lord Bell Venezuela, a Commercial and Industrial Handbook (1922) United States Government Printing Office p.127 Although the 4-4-4T locos could reach , trains took 7 hours for the 179 km. Financial difficulty Early in the line's history it was adversely affected by political instability in Venezuela. Krupp computed Venezuela's debt (including damages arising from the revolution against Venezuelan president Raimundo Andueza Palacio) as ¬£1,900,000. Suspension of debt payments by Cipriano Castro in 1901 was followed by the Venezuelan crisis of 1902‚Äì1903, a naval blockade involving gunboat diplomacy.Tomz, Michael Enforcement by Gunboats Stanford University (2006) p.189  Museum  The summit section of the railway forms part of a recreation park called Parque El Encanto (El Encanto is also the name of one of the stations). Work began in 2015 on a 350 million bolivar plan to restore of track as a heritage railway, with 7 tunnels and 5 bridges, providing for a 25-minute journey from Los Lagos to El Encanto.

Its members had all immigrated to Britain from Commonwealth countries. The band's name means \\"devil's children or bad policemen\\". The band's music has generally been described as progressive rock, soul, jazz rock and funk. Their album, Afreaka!, has become a popular source for sampling. Since 2008, they have received sporadic airplay by the BBC radio presenters Huey Morgan and Gideon Coe. Performances The band was promoted The Red Bus Company agency in London, which also handled Mungo Jerry, Mike Cooper, Titus Groan and Wildmouth which arranged for them to appear at a concert incongruously named the \\"Hollywood Music Festival\\", in May 1970 at a Leycett farm near Newcastle- under-Lyme. They played at the Phun City Festival, \\"a major concert event in Worthing\\". In November 1970, the band played a series of ten concerts called \\"A Penny Concert\\" along with Titus Groan, Heron and Comus. Among performances was one at the Marquee Club. They appeared on the BBC television show Disco 2 produced by Stephen Clive Turner had been offered (but did not take) 25 pounds for having them on the program. After he told BBC management about the incident, he was fired. Subsequently, the News of the World ran a story about the event. Musical style The band's music was influenced by West African music, calypso, soul, jazz, and ska, and saxophonist/founder Paddy Corea had a background in playing ska music. The music they heard during a trip to Morocco lead to a change in their style. The band's music has predominantly been described as progressive rock, soul, jazz rock and funk. It has also been described as acid rock, psychedelic soul, jazz fusion, and world music. The band also played reggae. Discography They signed with the Dawn Records division of Pye Records, for whom they released two recordings: the studio album Afreaka!

Julian Johnson Ewell (November 5, 1915 ‚Äì July 27, 2009) was a career United States Army officer who served in World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. He commanded the 9th Infantry Division and II Field Force in Vietnam, and attained the rank of lieutenant general. The son of a career Army officer, Ewell graduated from the New Mexico Military Institute and the United States Military Academy. Commissioned as a second lieutenant of infantry in 1939, he volunteered for paratrooper training at the start of World War II. During the war, he commanded 3rd Battalion, 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment, part of the 101st Airborne Division. He took part in a parachute jump into Normandy during the D-Day invasion, and continued to take part in combat against the Nazis in Europe. Ewell later commanded the 501st Regiment, which included participation in Operation Market Garden and the defense of Bastogne in the Battle of the Bulge. He received the Distinguished Service Cross for his heroism at Bastogne. After the war, Ewell continued his Army career, and his command assignments included the 9th Infantry Regiment in South Korea during the Korean War, Assistant Commandant of Cadets at West Point, Assistant Division Commander of the 8th Infantry Division, and Deputy Commander and Chief of Staff for the Combat Developments Command. During the Vietnam War, Ewell commanded the 9th Infantry Division (1968-1969) and II Field Force (1969-1970). He later served as military advisor to the U.S.-South Vietnamese delegation at the negotiations for the Paris Peace Accords and Chief of Staff of the NATO Southern Command. Ewell's Vietnam service generated controversy, especially over concerns that his focus on \\"body counts\\" as a measure of success caused his subordinates to inflate their numbers by counting civilian dead as enemy combatants and by committing atrocities. Among the most well-known operations he took part in was Operation Speedy Express, which was estimated by internal Department of Defense documents to have killed as many as 5,000 to 7,000 civilians. David Hackworth alleges that among those in the 9th Division he had commanded, this earned him the nickname the \\"Butcher of the Delta\\". According to Geoffrey Ward and Ken Burns in The Vietnam War: An Intimate History, Ewell was apparently proud of this nickname, and saw nothing wrong with what the soldiers under his command had done. Ewell died in Virginia in 2009, and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery. Early life and start of career Julian Johnson Ewell was the son of Jammie Morrison (Offutt) Ewell and Colonel George W. Ewell (1879-1972), a career Army officer.

In June 1944, Ewell parachuted into Normandy and led his men into combat for the first time. Despite being unable to immediately account for a majority of his battalion because so many paratroopers had missed their landing zones, Ewell was still able to regroup and engage the German defenses.George Koskimaki, D-Day with the Screaming Eagles, 2006, pages 153 to 154Joseph Balkoski, Utah Beach: The Amphibious Landing and Airborne Operations on D-Day, June 6, 1944, 2006, page 46John C.

Hackworth, who served in the 9th Division during the Vietnam War, wrote that in 1968 and 1969 the division was credited with killing 20,000 enemy, yet recovered only 2,000 weapons, suggesting that the numbers of enemy dead were vastly inflated.David H. Hackworth, The Horror That Will Never go Away, King Features Syndicate, May 1, 2001 According to Hackworth, Ewell's focus on body counts earned him the nickname the \\"Butcher of the Delta\\" from members of the 9th Division A 1972 Inspector General report concluded that there may have been as many as 5,000 to 7,000 civilian deaths during Speedy Express out of a total of 11,000 enemy combatants reported killed by troops.William M. Hammond, Center for Military History, Public Affairs: The Military and the Media, 1968-1973, 1996, page 238 In 1995, General Ewell and Ira Hunt, a retired major general who had served as Ewell's Chief of Staff in the 9th Division, published Sharpening the Combat Edge. In their book, Ewell and Hunt argued that the allegations of obsession with the body count were unfounded, and that their effort to inflict maximum damage had \\"unbrutalized\\" the war for civilians in South Vietnam. The version of events presented by Ewell and Hunt‚Äîan \\"unbrutalized' civilian population‚Äîis countered in Nick Turse's book, Kill Anything That Moves: The Real American War in Vietnam.John Tirman, Washington Post, 'Kill Anything that Moves: The Real American War in Vietnam' By Nick Turse, January 25, 2013 Turse presents detailed documentation of war crimes, including those he argues are Ewell's, and argues that the coverup of Speedy Express went to the top of American decision-making in Vietnam.Alfred W.

He was also a recipient of several foreign decorations, including the Legion of Honor (Chevalier) from France.Patricia Sullivan, Washington Post, Julian J. Ewell, 93, Dies; Decorated General Led Forces in Vietnam, August 5, 2009 =Citation for Distinguished Service Cross= The President of the United States takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Service Cross to Julian J. Ewell (0-21791), Lieutenant Colonel (Infantry), U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy while serving as Commanding Officer, 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, in action against enemy forces on the night of 18‚Äì19 December 1944, at Bastogne, Belgium. In the darkness of 18‚Äì19 December 1944, Colonel Ewell's regiment was the first unit of the 101st Airborne Division to reach the vicinity of Bastogne, Belgium, then under attack by strong enemy forces. While his regiment assembled, Lieutenant Colonel Ewell went forward alone to Bastogne to obtain first hand enemy information. During the night of 18‚Äì19 December 1944, Lieutenant Colonel Ewell made a personal reconnaissance amid intermingled friendly and hostile troops and on 19 December, by his heroic and fearless leadership of his troops, contributed materially to the defeat of enemy efforts to prostrate Bastogne. On 3 January 1945, when an enemy attack threatened to blunt the impetus of the regimental offensive, Lieutenant Colonel Ewell personally lead a counterattack which stopped the enemy and made possible the continued offensive action of his regiment. Throughout the action at Bastogne, the heroic and fearless personal leadership of Lieutenant Colonel Ewell were a source of inspiration to the troops he commanded. His intrepid actions, personal bravery and zealous devotion to duty exemplify the highest traditions of the military forces of the United States and reflect great credit upon himself, the 101st Airborne Division, and the United States Army.

Family and education  Mascarene was born in 6 June 1902 in Trivandrum into a Latin Catholic family. Her father, Gabriel Mascarene, was a government official of the Travancore State. She attended the Maharaja's College Travancore earning double MA in history and economics in 1925. She went on to earn a degree in law at the Maharaja's Colleges for Arts and Law, Trivandrum, following her return from a teaching stint in Ceylon.  Freedom fighter and early politics  Along with Akkamma Cherian and Pattom Thanu Pillai, Mascarene was one of the leaders of the movements for independence and integration of the Princely States within the Indian nation. In February 1938, when the political party Travancore State Congress was formed, she became one of the first women to join. The party goal was to establish a responsible government for Travancore and it was led by Pattom Thanu Pillai as president under whom served K. T. Thomas and P. S. Nataraja Pillai, secretaries, and M. R. Madhava Warrier, treasurer. Macsarene was appointed to the working committee and also served on the party's publicity committee. One of the first acts of the working committee was to send a memorandum to the Maharaja Sree Chithira Thirunal to demand the termination of the appointment of Sir C. P. Ramaswami Iyer and establish an enquiry into his administration, appointments, and financial affairs in his role as dewan. Iyer and his supporters retaliated for the attack on his administration. In a statewide propaganda tour undertaken with party president Pillai, Mascarene was outspoken in her criticism of the level of participation allowed in the legislature, of the dewan, and the government. Her statements led to assault by a police officer as well as her home being broken into and her property being stolen. She published an account of the incident, angering the police. Iyer spoke to the Maharaja against her, alleging that Mascarene was making speeches defaming the government and encouraging non-payment of taxes. The police commissioner also reported that she was dangerous and fomenting discontent. Her activism led to numerous arrests and imprisonments for various periods from 1939-1947. In 1938 and 1939, Mascarene served on the Economic Development Board of the Travancore government. During her time in the state legislature, she became a powerful speaker and enjoyed policymaking. In 1942, Mascarene joined the Quit India Movement and two years later was elected as secretary of the Travancore State Congress. On 21 February 1946 Mahatma Gandhi wrote to Mascarene regarding a speech she had delivered in Bombay, \\"Even otherwise, I know that you have no control over your tongue and when you stand up to speak, you blab anything that comes to your mind. This speech also is quite a specimen, if the newspaper report is correct. I have sent the report to Bhai Thanu Pillai. You can read it. Such indiscreet talk can do good neither to you nor to the poor people of Travancore. Besides, by your act you put the whole fair sex to shame\\". Gandhi also wrote to a colleague in the state congress, Pillai hoping to relieve Mascarene of her ministerial role in the government.  Parliamentary career  In 1946, Mascarene became one of the 15 women who were elected to the 299-member Constituent Assembly of India, tasked with drafting the Constitution of India. She served on the Assembly's select committee that looked into the Hindu Code Bill. When the Indian Independence Act 1947 was passed by the British Parliament, the Constitutional Assembly became, on 15 August, the parliament of the Dominion of India. In 1948 she was reelected to the Travancore-Cochin Legislative Assembly and served until 1952. In 1949, she became the first woman post-independence to serve as a Minister in the state, when she was appointed as Minister in Charge of Health and Power in the Parur T K Narayana Pillai Ministry. Mascarene was elected to the First Lok Sabha as an independent candidate from the Thiruvananthapuram Lok Sabha constituency in the 1951 Indian general election. She was the first woman MP from Kerala and one of only 10 elected to Parliament in those elections. In the second General Elections of 1957, she was defeated in Thiruvananthapuram by S Easwaran, coming fourth in a contest that also featured her erstwhile colleague in the Travancore Congress, Pattom Thanu Pillai.  Death  Annie Mascarene died in 1963 and her grave lies at the Pattoor cemetery in Thiruvananthapuram.  Commemoration  A bronze statue of Annie Mascarene was built at the Annie Mascarene Square at Vazhuthacaud in Thiruvananthapuram and it was unveiled by Vice President Hamid Ansari in September 2013.

Niels Glostrup was born in a small town named Glostrup near Copenhagen, where his father, Simon Jensen, was a priest. At the University of Copenhagen, he appears in 1604 as a student and in 1608 as a responder in a disputation, which was held by Professor Hans Jensen Alanus at the University. Then he went aboard. In 1609 he was in Wittenberg. In 1612 he took his Master's Degree in Copenhagen and, in the same year, became a parish pastor in K√∏ge, Denmark. The next year, he was engaged to marry Karen Andersdatter but she left him for King Christian IV of Denmark. Niels married her sister Anna instead. In 1616 he was transferred to Helsing√∏r to be its parish pastor. But he stayed for only a short time. On 6 June 1617 he was appointed as the Bishop of Oslo. Here he performed his duties well, was eager for education of the youth and for moral order, and made himself so popular in his diocese, that, unlike his predecessor \\"The Evil Bishop\\" Niels Clauss√∏n Senning, he was called ‚Äúden gode Bisp [The Good Bishop]‚Äù. In 1636 he consecrated a gymnasium [high school] in Christiania, and sought to obtain talented teachers for it. He was the brother-in-law of Oluf Boesen. When Glostrup became ill in 1638, Boesen assisted him in the execution of the official duties and, in the following year, succeeded him as the eighth Bishop when Glostrup died.

Davis House or the Arden H. Ballard House, was built as a private home, and is currently used as the meeting place for the Ladies' Literary Club. It is located at 218 North Washington Street Ypsilanti, Michigan. It was designated a Michigan State Historic Site in 1965 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. Early history The Ladies' Literary Club Building was built in approximately 1843 as a home for William M. Davis. It was likely designed by Arden H. Ballard and built by his firm of Norris, Cross, and Ballard. At some point, it was sold to Elijah Grant, who operated a local dry goods store. When Grant died in 1851, his wife Mary and son Edward continued to live in the house. Mary died in 1883, and Edward continued to live in the house, his fortune slowly diminishing through a series of bad investments. He eventually began selling the furnishings, and in 1913 sold the house itself. The Ladies' Literary Club purchased the property to use as their meeting hall. Ladies' Literary Club The Ladies' Literary Club of Ypsilanti was founded in 1878 by Sarah Smith Putnam, with 17 members. The club functioned as a learning society. Since learning opportunities for women remained few clubwomen developed courses of study in various historical topics from the French Revolution to early Greek and Roman societies. The club membership quickly expanded, and they held bi-monthly meetings at the homes of members or in the library. However, by 1910, the club had grown large enough that they needed to rent rooms in the Masonic temple. When the Davis House was put up for sale in 1913, the Club purchased it for $3000. The first meeting in the house was in October 1914. The interior of the building was later refurbished under the oversight of architect Emil Lorch. In the 1930s, Lorch helped the structure become a part of the Historic American Buildings Survey \\"because of its age and architectural interest as being worthy of most careful preservation for future generations.\\" More remodeling was done in 1955, and an addition was built to the rear of the building in 1971-72. Description The Ladies' Literary Club Building is a 1-1/2 story rectangular brick Greek Revival house. The temple front boasts a wooden tetrastyle Doric portico with a triangular pediment above.

She served on the China Station, then the Australia Station between December 1903 and February 1905 and later became a survey ship, surviving until 1932 as a Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve drill ship, the last of her class to be sold.Bastock p.123 Design Mutine was constructed of steel to a design by William White, the Royal Navy Director of Naval Construction.

Service Mutine was launched at Birkenhead on 1 March 1900, and commissioned later the same year. She was re- commissioned at Sheerness 28 November 1901 by Commander Claude William Manners Plenderleath, with a complement of 105 officers and men, for service on the China Station. After successful steam trials in the North Sea, she left Sheerness for China in mid December, arriving at Singapore 4 February, and at Hong Kong 27 March 1902. She served in the Far East between December 1903 and February 1905 and was converted to a survey ship in May 1907. After a year operating off the west coast of Africa, Mutine returned to Devonport for a refit in July 1908. She was a depot ship in Bermuda from December 1917 and an RNVR drill ship from 1925.

He is involved with the San Francisco arts community as well as the Burning Man community. In what he referred to as \\"an experiment\\", he ran for Mayor in the 2007 San Francisco mayoral election, during which he wore fake mustaches, debated a puppet, and arranged costumed flash mobs to occur at campaign events, in an effort to be as flippant a candidate as possible.  Musician  Rinaldi was a one-time member of The Murder Junkies, an American punk rock band fronted by GG Allin. Rinaldi left the band in 1991, and voiced negative opinions about the experience in Todd Phillips's documentary Hated: GG Allin And The Murder Junkies. He was replaced by William Weber.  Showman  In 1994 Rinaldi conceived, organized, and became the ringmaster of Circus Redickuless, a nationally touring \\"punk rock circus\\". The circus was the subject of a 1997 documentary of the same name by Phillip Glau. This film later won Best Documentary at the 1998 New York Underground Film Festival. = Boating = In the summer of 2006, Rinaldi was recruited by noted street artist Swoon to build the propulsion system for a raft made of salvaged scrap that was to travel down the Mississippi River for Swoon's project Miss Rockaway Armada. Rinaldi was the engineer and builder for the central communal floating platform for the Seasteading Institute's 2009 Ephemerisle event.Reason Magazine article on Ephemerisle = San Francisco mayor joke candidacy = As an elaborate joke, Rinaldi ran as one of several colorfully-nicknamed candidates in the 2007 San Francisco mayoral election, ostensibly challenging incumbent Gavin Newsom. Rinaldi referred to himself an \\"experimental candidate\\". He made an effort to be as flippant a candidate as possible, wearing seven different fake mustaches over the course of the campaign, publicly debating a puppet, and organizing a zombie flash mob to occur outside one of the Mayoral debates. He finished with 2,508 votes, or 1.75 percent of the official vote tally, coming in 6th place.  Activism  = Campaign financing = After submitting the required official declaration of candidacy on August 8, 2007, Rinaldi claimed to have raised $25,000 in campaign donations from San Francisco residents by August 28, thus qualifying him for public matching funds. On September 13 he was denied public financing by the San Francisco Ethics Commission on the basis that around $20,000 was donated through e-commerce site PayPal. As it was PayPal's official policy to keep billing information confidential and provide only a shipping address, the commission ruled such donations were insufficient proof of donor residency as required by law. Rinaldi's campaign contacted PayPal and obtained special internal verification that the addresses did indeed match, which was submitted September 19. By October 2 the Ethics Commission had approved many more contributions, but their qualified still fell several hundred dollars short. The following day the campaign's lawyer submitted a request asking the commission to clarify which donations were ineligible, and for which reason, and a date by which to appeal them. Executive Director John St. Croix responded that by requesting an appeal, the campaign had lost its right to do so. On October 15, a meeting of the full commission unanimously overturned St. Croix's decision. The Ethics Commission invited Rinaldi's campaign to resubmit documents. The application was subsequently denied on review and Rinaldi's campaign did not receive the requested public funds. =Ballot initiatives= Renaming a sewage plant after George W.
