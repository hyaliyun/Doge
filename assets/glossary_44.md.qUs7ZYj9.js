In his early adulthood he started abusing his parents and sisters, and sold illegal moonshine. Sotnikov was accused of raping two women, but paid the women to drop their accusations.–í–æ—Å—Å—Ç–∞–≤—à–∏–π –∏–∑ –ì—Ä—è–∑–µ–π  Murders  On 30 September 2000, Sotnikov committed his first murder when he killed a 19-year-old girl, who he offered to give a ride. According to Sotnikov, she voluntarily agreed to go to his house and have a drink, where a quarrel started between them, where she ended up being beaten to death. Later the mother of the victim denied this version of events, stating that she believed Sotnikov dragged her daughter into the house by force. Sotnikov is not known to have committed another murder until 2002, when together with a partner, Alexander Lenshin, they spotted a 25-year-old woman walking alongside the road they were driving along. The woman was offered a ride which she accepted, but after rejecting advances by Sotnikov he attacked her, beating her to death. Lenshin then stabbed the woman in the chest to make sure she was dead. The two attempted to dump the body in the Matyra River, however they could not stop the body floating in the water, instead hiding the body in rubble at an abandoned limestone crushing plant. On the day of New Year 2003, Sotnikov and Lenshin kidnapped a 31-year-old woman who was drunk because of New Years celebrations, loading her into the car and taking her to a deserted area, where the two dumped her. The drunken woman died when she could not reach shelter over that winter night, and subsequently froze to death. In March 2003, in the Petrovsky District of Tambov Oblast, Sotnikov and Lenshin killed a 46-year-old man who had asked them to take him to Tambov. The body was thrown on the side of the road and covered with snow. A few days later the two killed a 66-year-old pensioner, who had asked for a ride to the Dobrinsky District of Lipetsk Oblast. In December 2005, Sotnikov drank alcohol with a 32-year-old woman who he had promised to take to Lipetsk. On the way to the city he instead drove to Matyrskomu reservoir, where he abandoned the drunken woman in the snow and left, where she died from hypothermia. Sotnikov did not commit another known murder until April 2010, when he then put the girl and his wife in the car and took them to the Matyra River, where he killed the girl and burned the body. His last known murder was committed in November 2011, when Sotnikov asked to help a homeless man gather firewood, and then invited him to go with him to the village. Sotnikov killed the man in the forest and abandoned the body there. After the discovery of the body, witnesses came forward saying they had seen Sotnikov with the homeless man offering to help cut firewood.–õ–∏–ø–µ—Ü–∫–∏–π –º–∞–Ω—å—è–∫ —Ä–∞—Å—Å–∫–∞–∑–∞–ª –∫–∞–∫ –ø–æ–ª—É—á–∞–ª —É–¥–æ–≤–æ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ  Arrest and conviction  Sotnikov was arrested after being identified by the witnesses during the investigation of the homeless man's murder. He attempted to claim he was insane, but he was proven to be sane during the killings. On 22 October 2013, Sotnikov was found guilty of 8 murders in Lipetsk Oblast and Tambov Oblast, and was sentenced to life imprisonment. In his final statement, he apologized to the victims, his wife and said that he repents committing the crimes. His accomplice, Alexander Lenshin, was sentenced to 19-years imprisonment for his involvement in some of the murders.

The event is noted to have raised enough money to provide operating expenses for the entire organization for two years. Programs Since its conception, The CITY had provided students in South Central Los Angeles with a unique \\"Micro-Entrepreneurship\\" program that lasts 46 weeks. This program encourages students not \\"enter the field or trade\\" but to start their own business. They offer specific technical training in several different categories including jewelry design, photography, graphic arts & design, and interior & exterior painting. In these programs, inner city youth develop a product or service, and obtain mentor-ship from a notable leader in that particular field or an industry professional. CITY Gala Since the Fame and Philanthropy gala, The CITY has hosted an annual awards ceremony and speaker summit known as the CITY Gala. This annual gala features speeches from top leaders in the entertainment industry, musical performance from A-list celebrities, and worldwide media coverage.

It was written by Christopher Monfette. It premiered at the Los Angeles Film Festival on June 7, 2016. Premise A real estate reporter investigates Jebediah Crone (Dayton Callie), a mysterious old man who is assembling a haunted house constructed from rooms where deaths have occurred. Production Production for the film began in 2014. It was announced in October 2014 that Joe Anderson, Dayton Callie, Jessica Lowndes and Lin Shaye had been cast. Reception Abattoir has received negative reviews. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a 38% approval rating with 21 reviews counted, with an average score of 4.69/10. Metacritic gave the film a 40 which illustrates \\"mixed or average\\". Brian Tallerico writing for RogerEbert.com gave the film a half star calling it \\"one of the most baffling and ineffective horror films of the year.\\" Dennis Harvey, writing for Variety, found the film lacking in focus saying \\"In the end, Abattoir feels like a confused rehash of ideas from the variable likes of The Shining, House on Haunted Hill, Thirteen Ghosts and other haunted-house movies, albeit one so misjudged that it doesn‚Äôt even get to the house itself until the last 20 minutes or so. If there were potential here, it‚Äôs been garbled in translation.\\" On the other hand, John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter called it \\"A pulpy supernatural tale dripping with atmosphere.\\" John Squires of Bloody Disgusting called the film \\"one of the most original horror movies to come out in the last several years.\\" Comic book prequel In 2010, Darren Bousman developed a comicbook prequel to the film from Radical Studios. The six-issue miniseries was written by Rob Levin and Troy Peteri, with art by Bing Cansino. Bousman outlined his plans with, \\"I want to create a universe, and this is the beginning of a universe. I don‚Äôt foresee using the comic book to be what the movie is. But it‚Äôs part of the world of what the movie will exist in, and everything will stand on its own. For example, the comic book will be its own world, its own movie, its own book, its own story. The movie will be its own world, its own story, but they will all connect. All pieces of this thing connect and tell a much bigger tale... think it‚Äôs important to lead into the movie. We came up with this as a script, as a feature film idea, but what we wanted to accomplish in the feature film was way, way, way too ambitious for a 90-minute movie. So we had to backtrack and set the world up that way.\\" Sequel A sequel to Abattoir titled The Dwelling was announced in May 2016, with Bousman set to write and direct and Callie to reprise his role as Jebediah Crone.

Its main components are a focal plane containing 5,000 fiber- positioning robots, and a bank of spectrographs which are fed by the fibers. The new instrument will enable an experiment to probe the expansion history of the Universe and the mysterious physics of dark energy. The instrument is operated by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory under funding from the US Department of Energy's Office of Science. Construction of the new instrument, now completed, was principally funded by the US Department of Energy's Office of Science, and by other numerous sources including the US National Science Foundation, the UK Science and Technology Facilities Council, France's Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission, Mexico's National Council of Science and Technology, Spain's Ministry of Science and Innovation, by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, by the Heising-Simons Foundation, and by collaborating institutions worldwide. DESI sits at an elevation of , where it has been retrofitted onto the Mayall Telescope on top of Kitt Peak in the Sonoran Desert, which is located from Tucson, Arizona, US. Telescope tracks 35 million galaxies in Dark Energy hunt, BBC Science report, 28 October 2019  Science goals  The expansion history and large-scale structure of the Universe is a key prediction of cosmological models, and DESI observations will permit scientists to probe diverse aspects of cosmology, from dark energy to alternatives to General Relativity to neutrino masses to the early Universe. The data from DESI will be used to create three-dimensional maps of the distribution of matter covering an unprecedented volume of the Universe with unparalleled detail. This will provide insight into the nature of dark energy and establish whether cosmic acceleration is due to a cosmic-scale modification of General Relativity. DESI will be transformative in the understanding of dark energy and the expansion rate of the Universe at early times, one of the greatest mysteries in the understanding of the physical laws. DESI will measure the expansion history of the Universe using the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) imprinted in the clustering of galaxies, quasars, and the intergalactic medium. The BAO technique is a robust way to extract cosmological distance information from the clustering of matter and galaxies. It relies only on very large-scale structure and it does so in a manner that enables scientists to separate the acoustic peak of the BAO signature from uncertainties in most systematic errors in the data. BAO was identified in the 2006 Dark Energy Task Force report as one of the key methods for studying dark energy. In May 2014, the High-Energy Physics Advisory Panel, a federal advisory committee, commissioned by the US Department of Energy (DOE) and the National Science Foundation (NSF) endorsed DESI.  3D map of the Universe  The baryon acoustic oscillations method requires a three-dimensional map of distant galaxies and quasars created from the angular and redshift information of a large statistical sample of cosmologically distant objects. By obtaining spectra of distant galaxies it is possible to determine their distance, via the measurement of their spectroscopic redshift, and thus create a 3-D map of the Universe. The 3-D map of the large-scale structure of the Universe also contains more information about dark energy than just the BAO and is sensitive to the mass of the neutrino and parameters that governed the primordial Universe. During its five-year survey beginning in the second half of 2020, the DESI experiment will observe 35 million galaxies and quasars.  Development  The DESI instrument implements a new highly multiplexed optical spectrograph on the Mayall Telescope. The new optical corrector design creates a very large, 8.0 square degree field of view on the sky, which combined with the new focal plane instrumentation weighs approximately 10 tonnes. The focal plane accommodates 5,000 small computer controlled fiber positioners on a 10.4 millimeter pitch. The entire focal plane can be reconfigured for the next exposure in less than two minutes while the telescope slews to the next field. The DESI instrument is capable of taking 5,000 simultaneous spectra over a wavelength range from 360 nm to 980 nm. The DESI project scope included construction, installation, and commissioning of the new wide-field corrector and corrector support structure for the telescope, the focal plane assembly with 5,000 robotic fiber positioners and ten guide/focus/alignment sensors, a 40-meter optical fiber cabling system that brings light from the focal plane to the spectrographs, ten 3-arm spectrographs, an instrument control system, and a data analysis pipeline. The instrument fabrication was managed by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and oversees operation of the experiment including a 600 person international scientific collaboration. Cost of construction was $56M from the US Department of Energy's Office of Science plus an additional $19M from other non-federal sources including contributions in-kind. The leadership of DESI currently consists of the director, Dr. Michael Levi, collaboration co-spokespersons Prof. Daniel Eisenstein and Dr. Nathalie Palanque-Delabrouille, project scientists Dr. David J. Schlegel and Dr. Julien Guy, project manager Robert Besuner, instrument scientist Prof. Paul Martini, and commissioning scientist Prof. Constance Rockosi. Construction on the new instrument started in 2015 and was completed in 2019 with commissioning finishing in March 2020.  DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys  To provide targets for the DESI survey three telescopes surveyed the northern and part of the southern sky in the g, r and z-band. Those surveys were the Beijing-Arizona Sky Survey (BASS), using the Bok 2.3-m telescope, the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS), using the Blanco 4m telescope and the Mayall z-band Legacy Survey (MzLS), using the 4-meter Mayall telescope. The area of the surveys is 14,000 square degrees (about one third of the sky) and avoids the Milky Way. These surveys were combined into the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys, or Legacy Surveys. Colored images of the survey can be viewed in the Legacy Survey Sky Browser. The legacy survey covers 16,000 square degrees of the night sky containing 1.6 billion objects including galaxies and quasars out to 11 billion years ago.  History  DESI received a go ahead to start R&D; for the project in December 2012 with the assignment of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory as the managing laboratory. Dr. Michael Levi, a senior scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory was appointed by the laboratory to be DESI's project director who served in that role starting in 2012 and throughout construction. Henry Heetderks was project manager from 2013 until 2016, Robert Besuner was project manager from 2016 until 2020. Congressional authorization was provided in 2015, and the US Department of Energy's Office of Science approved the start of physical construction in June 2016. First light of the new corrector system was obtained on the night of April 1, 2019, and first-light of the entire instrument was achieved on the night of October 22, 2019. Commissioning ensued after first light and was completed in March, 2020. Commissioning was completed in March 2020, and is targeting full operations by the end of 2020.

In the United States itself, the Anti-Imperialist Department of the well- funded Workers (Communist) Party of America was Charles Shipman (1895-1989), a draft-resisting American expatriate to Mexico who as \\"Jes√∫s Ram√≠rez\\" had been a delegate representing that country at the 2nd World Congress of the Comintern.See Shipman's memoir, It Had to Be Revolution, pp. 92-127. In addition to Latin American concerns, Shipman's department had also propagandized against American commercial and military involvement in other parts of the globe, including particularly the Philippines and China. =Establishment= In April 1925 Shipman was dispatched to Mexico as the representative of the Workers Party to the 3rd Congress of the Communist Party of Mexico. It was at this time that a new international organization was launched, the All-America Anti-Imperialist League ‚Äî an organization which would eventually include national sections throughout Latin America.Shipman, It Had to Be Revolution, pg. 155. The term \\"All-America\\" in the organizational moniker was not intended to relate specifically to the United States, but rather to the fact that the organization included sections from throughout the Americas.Similarly, the Russian Communist Party was in this period referred to as the \\"All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks).\\" The official Spanish name of the League captures the essence better, \\"Liga Antiimperialista de las Americas\\" (Anti-Imperialist League of the Americas). Although itself an international group, the All-American Anti-Imperialist League was in turn attached to another Comintern-sponsored international organization, the League Against Imperialism.J. B. Matthews (ed.), \\"All-America Anti-Imperialist League,\\" in Special Committee on Un-American Activities, Investigation of Un- American Propaganda Activities in the United States: Appendix ‚Äî Part IX: Communist Front Organizations with Special Reference to the National Citizens Political Action Committee. First Section, Second Section, and Third Section. Washington, DC: US Government Printing Office, 1944; pp. 310-311. This federation included other similar regional organizations to the All-American Anti-Imperialist League, groups engaged in parallel activity in other parts of the world. =Development= In the United States Charles Shipman was named as Secretary of the American Section of the All-American Anti-Imperialist League and given the task of formally organizing units of the new group.Shipman, It Had to Be Revolution, pp. 156-157. Speakers were sent to trade union locals in an effort to stir up interest but the effort was largely futile, with these representatives generally denied admission.Shipman, It Had to Be Revolution, pg. 157. The cause was more successfully promoted in the labor press, however, with the Communist-controlled Federated Press news service providing substantial coverage of the organizing effort. The organizing effort benefited from a sizable donation by wealthy Chicago liberal William H. Holly, and a number of prominent public figures allowed their names to be used on the group's letterhead to bolster fundraising, including NAACP executive William Pickens, civil liberties activist Roger Baldwin, literary critic Lewis Gannett, and public intellectuals Robert Morss Lovett and Arthur Garfield Hays. These friendly non-communist figures were joined in the public spotlight by a number of well-known public figures who maintained Workers Party membership, including writer Scott Nearing and trade union official William Z. Foster. In later years the All-America Anti-Imperialist League was known simply as the \\"Anti-Imperialist League.\\" The organization maintained its headquarters in a single room located at 32 Union Square, New York City, part of a suite occupied by the Communist-sponsored literary magazine, The New Masses.Shipman, It Had to Be Revolution, pp. 165-166. Membership in the American Section of the league was through payment of annual dues of $1 ‚Äî although donations of $10 from those with the means to pay were actively solicited.All-America Anti-Imperialist League (US Section), Defeat the War Against Nicaragua. New York: All-America Anti-Imperialist League (US Section), n.d. [1928]; pg. 4. =Kellogg Statement= On January 13, 1927, Secretary of State Frank B. Kellogg garnered front page headlines across America when he presented an extensive statement to the Foreign Affairs Committee of the United States Senate.\\"Mexico is Base for Communist Plot Against United States, Kellogg Tells Senate Foreign Affairs Committee,\\" Reading [PA] Times, vol. 68, no. 274, whole no. 21,342 (Jan. 13, 1927), pp. 1, 10. Kellogg depicted the All-American Anti-Imperialist League as the bulwark of Soviet revolutionism in the Western Hemisphere. Kellogg told the assembled Senators: \\"The Bolshevik leaders have very definite ideas with respect to the role which Mexico and Latin America are to play in their general program of world revolution. Thus, Latin America and Mexico are conceived as a base for activities against the United States.\\" He pointedly noted the Mexican focus of operations of the All- American Anti-Imperialist League, publishing center of the international organization. =1927 Brussels Congress= In February 1927, Secretary of the American Section Charles Shipman other national leaders of the Anti- Imperialist League were made a delegate to an international convention in Brussels sponsored by the Communist International, called the Congress Against Colonial Oppression and Imperialism.Shipman, It Had to Be Revolution, pp. 162-163. =Termination= In 1933 the All-America Anti-Imperialist League was formally terminated and a new organization launched in its stead, the American League Against War and Fascism. The new organization focused instead on the developing political situation in Europe, attempting to build a Popular Front in opposition to fascist Germany and Italy.

It has rough, flaky bark on the lower part of the trunk, smooth light grey bark above, lance- shaped adult leaves, flower buds mostly in groups of between seven and eleven, creamy white flowers and conical to cylindrical fruit. Description Eucalyptus gypsophila is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and has persistent rough bark toward the base of the trunk, smooth light grey over pinkish grey to coppery cream coloured bark above. Young plants and coppice regrowth have slightly glaucous, egg-shaped to more or less round leaves that are long and wide. Adult leaves are arranged alternately, the same dull blue- grey to grey-green on both sides, lance-shaped, long and ) wide with the base tapering to a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils, usually in groups of seven, nine or eleven on a peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with a conical to rounded operculum that has radiating striations. Flowering occurs between July and December and the flowers are creamy white. The fruit is a woody, conical to cylindrical capsule long and wide with the valves near rim level. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus gypsophila was first formally described in 1997 by the botanist Dean Nicolle in the journal Nuytsia. The specific epithet (gypsophila) is from the Greek gypsos meaning 'gypsum' and philos , 'loving', referring to this species commonly occurring on gypsum sand dunes around dry lakes. This species was previously included in E. striaticalyx but that species is a tree. This mallee belongs in subgenus Symphyomyrtus section Dumaria, to a large sub-group, series Rufispermae, composed of 37 described species and subspecies including E. kondininensis, E. striaticalyx and E. repullulans. Distribution Kopi mallee is widespread in the Great Victoria Desert, from east of Laverton in Western Australia to the western edge of the Gawler Ranges in South Australia. Over most of its range it grows on red sand over limestone, often near salt lakes or dry lakes.

He was forced to resign due to clerical opposition to his tenure and rumors spread against him forced this resignation. He was noted for his concern towards the poor as well as for his preaching abilities; he was known to have preached in various Italian cities and had support from Pope Eugene IV who was a benefactor. (in Latin) Matteo also preached across Spain on several occasions being close to the monarch (he is alleged to have Spanish origins) before returning to the Italian peninsula to preach and assume his episcopal duties. He was honored for his saintliness in life and death and it later led to Pope Clement XIII approving his equipollent beatification on 22 February 1767. Life Matteo Guimer√† was born in Agrigento sometime in 1376 and is said to be descended from a Spanish line. It has been debated that his name is Matteo de Zizilia due to an entrance record into the Order of Friars Minor at Bologna dated 30 July 1394 while other hagiographers have suggested that he was named after his grandfather with the surname Sciascia; others suggest Limbeni is his surname. He was sent to Bologna for his theological studies and later to Barcelona in Spain where he was ordained as a priest in 1400. He joined the Order of Friars Minor either in 1391 or 1392 at the San Francesco d'Assisi convent before making his religious profession in 1394. It was after his ordination that he was tasked with preaching in Tarragona and then served as a novice master from 1405 until 1416 (he returned home in 1417). Per King Alfonso V he returned home in the hopes of meeting Saint Bernardino da Siena; the two were said to have met at the order's General Chapter in Mantua in 1418 to which Matteo encouraged and began aiding Bernardino in his Franciscan Observance movement. He also served as the order's provincial vicar from 1425 until 1427 and then as the order's commissioner general for the Sicilian Province from 1432 until 1440. Pope Martin V allowed him in 1425 to establish three convents for the Franciscans and he and Saint Giovanni da Capistrano defended their friend Bernardino before the pope when Bernardino was accused of being a heretic in relation to his devotion to the Sacred Name; Bernardino was acquitted of all the charges leveled against him. This accusation was voiced at the end of Lent in Viterbo in 1426 which prompted Matteo and Giovanni to rush to Rome to plead their case before the pope. Matteo also founded convents in Valencia and Barcelona during the time he spent in Spain from 1427 until 1428 but returned back to his homeland where he founded a convent in Siracusa in 1429 and another at Caltagirone later in 1432. He returned to Spain in 1430 when Queen Maria of Aragon asked him to help make peace between her husband John II (the King of Castile) and his brother. King Alfonso V of Aragon held him in such high esteem that he helped to secure Matteo for a nomination to an Italian bishopric; Pope Eugene IV appointed him in a papal bull on 17 September 1442 as the Bishop of Agrigento. This came after he preached for Lent in 1428 in Valencia and left for the Italian peninsula in April 1430 after concluding his preaching in Tarragona. Matteo was consecrated to the episcopate on 30 June 1443 and set to work to reform clerical standards and to aid the poor in his diocese. His consecration was postponed for several months due to his own opposition to the appointment; he accepted at the pope's insistence and in obedience to him. His care for the poor led some disgruntled clerics to claim that he squandered ecclesial goods for his own benefit. He in fact renounced all ecclesial proceeds to the poor but kept what was needed for him and for the well-being of the diocesan staff. But the disgruntled clerics who opposed him sought to remove him from the diocese and claimed he was engaging in carnal relations with a woman in order to force the pope to take action. He was tried in a papal court but was found innocent; Eugene IV restored his bishopric to him (the pope was a consistent benefactor for Matteo) but the bishop resigned his see even though the allegations were disproved. It is said that Bernardino's counsel also helped him in his decision to resign. The pope provided him with a pension following his resignation as a consolation. Matteo died following a brief illness in Palermo on 7 January 1455 and was interred in the Santa Maria di Ges√π church. Beatification Pope Clement XIII beatified Matteo on 22 February 1767.

With over 8,000 km2 of land area and over 500 km2 of marine area, it is the largest of the six nature reserves in Khabarovsk Krai. It supports spawning streams into the Okhotsk Sea for chum, pink salmon and coho salmon. Topography Geographically, Dzhugdzur is in the region known as the \\"Priokhot'e\\" (\\"Against the Okhotsk\\"), the area on the immediate west and northwest coast of the Okhotsk Sea. The Dzhugdzursky Mountains run from the southwest to the northeast, up the northern coast of the Okhotsk Sea and continuing for some 1,500 km to the northeast. The area is remote, with few settlements or town; the reserve is 1,447 km from the capital city of Khabarovsk. The reserve itself is broken into three sections - the \\"Dzhugdzhur\\", the \\"Coastal\\", and the \\"Islands of Malmo\\". The northern section (Dzhugdzur) is bisected by the Dzhugdzur Ridge, which reaches 1,400 to 1,800 meters in height. The southeastern part of the Dzhugdzurksy section is a series of mountain spurs to the coastal strip and is very hard to access. The highest point in the northern section is Mt. Topko (1,906 meters). The southern section of the reserve (\\"Coastal\\") is a ridge of 600‚Äì800 meters that drops precipitously to the Okhotsk Sea coast. Along the entire ridge there is only one river cut (the Lantar River valley), and the rocky sea cliffs make this section also very hard to access. Climate and Ecoregion Dzhugdzursky is located at the far eastern extreme of the East Siberian taiga ecoregion, a large region stretching from the Yenisei River to the Lena River system and southeast to the Okhotsk Sea. The region's northern border reaches the Arctic Circle, and its southern border reaches 52¬∞N latitude. The dominant vegetation is light coniferous taiga with Dahurian larch (Larix gmelinii forming the canopy in areas with low snow cover. The ecoregion is rich in minerals. The climate of Dzhugdzursky is Cold semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen climate classification (ET)). This is a local climate in which at least one month has an average temperature high enough to melt snow (0 ¬∞C (32 ¬∞F)), but no month with an average temperature in excess of 10 ¬∞C (50 ¬∞F). Ice in the Sea of Okhotsk can remain well into June or even July. Thus, the surface water temperature rises slowly and may only reach 10-12 C degrees in the summer. As a result, the coastal region of Dzhugdzursky has a summer that is short, cold, and wet. There are on average 50 days of fog per year on the coast, with frequent rain and drizzle. Flora and fauna The northernmost zone, Dzhugzhur, is mostly larch forest, representative of the ecoregion, with some Scots pine. The coastal regions of the reserve have flora characteristic of the Okhotsk-Kamchatka region. The harsh climate (cold, wet, and with strong northwesterly winds in winter) is nevertheless supportive of a wide range of bird species: 185 species of birds have been recorded in the reserve, with 126 nesting in the territory. Spotted seal. Dzhugdzursky Reserve coastal region supports a wide range of seals The animals of the reserve are those found in the meeting of the East Siberian taiga (sable, brown bear, wolverine, moose), the Arctic (ptarmigan, Rough- legged Buzzard), and the Asian (including bighorn sheep). On the Okhotsk Sea coast are a variety of pinnipeds (that is, seals): Ringed seal (Akiba), Spotted seal (Larga), and Bearded seal. Ecotourism As a strict nature reserve, the Dzhugdzursky Reserve is mostly closed to the general public, although scientists and those with 'environmental education' purposes can make arrangements with park management for visits. The reserve does allow for limited public 'ecotourist' excursions on certain routes accompanied by reserve rangers, but requires application for permits to be submitted in advance for approval.

Born in Craiova, his parents were Colonel Romulus G. Magheru, the son of General Gheorghe Magheru; and his wife Ana, the daughter of Ion Ghica. After his father's death when he was four, he was raised at the Ghica family's estate in Ghergani, where he received a rich musical and literary education. Alexandrina Ghica, his grandmother, was an accomplished pianist who had studied with Franz Liszt and Clara Schumann; his mother had studied fine arts in London. He attended Saint George primary school in Bucharest, followed by Gheorghe LazƒÉr High School, from which he graduated in 1911. The same year, he entered the medical faculty of Bucharest University, from which he would graduate in 1920. Meanwhile, Romania's entry into World War I found him a sixth-year student, and Magheru left for the front as a second lieutenant combat medic. He contracted a recurring fever and epidemic typhus, but refused to take leave and remained in the war-torn Moldavia region until demobilization. After obtaining his degree, he began to conduct research at the Cantacuzino Institute, where he would spend his entire career. Together with his wife Alice, a microbiologist, he wrote numerous specialized texts. Although he began writing poetry at age fourteen, Magheru's published debut took place much later. He devoted himself to writing after 1923, when an illness forced him to Sinaia for a time. His first book was the play Tudor Ardeleanu (1926), followed by O legendƒÉ (1927); together, they formed the cycle Latinii la DunƒÉre. His first poetry book was the 1929 Capricii; according to Adrian Maniu, it contained \\"interesting and anti-poetic texts\\". As a result, Magheru polemically titled his next collection Poezii antipoetice (\\"Anti-poetic Poems\\"; 1933). There followed Poeme √Æn limba pƒÉsƒÉreascƒÉ (1936), Coarde vechi »ôi noi (1936), Poeme balcanice (1936), and the plays Piele de cerb (1937), Domnul Decan (1939), Egoistul (a dramatization of George Meredith's The Egoist, 1939), Oglinda fermecatƒÉ sau Divina re-crea»õiune (1944). Magheru never sought for his plays to be staged, even though they are hardly lacking in well-crafted scenes, a modern dramaturgical vision and debates about moral and philosophical issues. He lived a withdrawn existence and did not participate in the literary life of the interwar period. Isolated between his laboratory and a circle of friends drawn from the contemporary artistic elite (including George Enescu, Jean Alexandru Steriadi, Theodor Pallady, Henri Catargi, Dumitru Ghia»õƒÉ and Iosif Iser), he continued to write after the King Michael Coup of 1944, but stopped publishing. Much of his late work has yet to be studied and published.

An example of the food/drink offered. The main idea is tea, but coffee, cookies, pastries with jam, etc. are also offered. A gufujo, plural gufujoj (guf, eagle owl; ujo, country, container, den, nest), in Esperanto slang, is a non-alcoholic, non-smoking makeshift European caf√©-type situation (extremely similar to a fika) that takes place in the evening or at night. Esperanto speakers meet at a location, either a rented space or someone's house, and enjoy live music or reading aloud while having tea, coffee, pastries etc. There may be payment with real money expected, as in a real caf√©. It's supposed to be a calm affair, in direct contrast to the wild parties that other Esperanto speakers might be having elsewhere at the same time. The lighting is usually dim and candles are usually lit, which is the custom in European caf√©s in the evening. Gufujoj were originally intended for people who dislike crowd noise and partying. General customs There may be plastic Esperanto coins used that have owls on them in order to \\"pay\\" for the food and drink, or the purchaser may have bought a \\"tasopaso\\" (tas: cup, paso: pass) which is a piece of paper showing that they've paid for a certain amount of tea beforehand. People who often frequent gufujoj like to use these, and it makes the cashier's job easier if they're used because instead of counting coins in the dim lighting they can simply mark the piece of paper to show how many cups of tea have been used.  History and cultural significance  The gufujo custom arose in the 1990s, when smoking began to be seen as \\"not always acceptable\\" in many places in the world. People who had made friends at an Esperanto convention would split up because one of them would go to the afterparty while the other wouldn‚Äôt, and this created a divide between the two groups ‚Äî the one had nothing to do, while the other went off to visit a real bar in town. Otherwise, there was no possible way to separate the smoke from the smoker once they came back to the main group after a smoking break, which irritated people. The first ever gufujo took place in 1995 in Germany. Uli Rau and Rolfo Ernesto wanted a different, quieter place to drink tea. A year later, Natalie and Rolfo organized it. The name gufujo was not chosen far in advance, but it won over \\"fringejo\\" (fring, finch; ejo, place-for) because it sounded better, and because the word \\"ujo\\" (container, country, den, nest, etc.) has a wider meaning. It was a huge success, mostly due to the fact that smoking wasn't allowed. Vanessa Ferrato liked the idea and created gufujoj in G√ºntersberge and Freiburg, Germany in 1996 and 1997, as well as when visiting Esperanto- speakers in Italy. They also started appearing in Copenhagen in 1996 or 1997, and Traben-Trarbach in 1997 or 1998. Since then, gufujoj have been essentially required at every convention meant for younger Esperanto speakers, and it has become a cultural habit in the Esperanto-speaking world in general. When the gufujo is in a rented room or building, passers-by who don‚Äôt speak Esperanto will even come in just to see what is going on. As the Esperanto culture puts a strong focus on educating others and helping people learn, and as the community is generally seen as small and marginalized compared to that of other countries and languages (for example, that of English-speakers), even random strangers wandering in in order to ask about the event is seen as a good thing.

Apart from small-scale dams intended to divert water for municipal use in the District of Columbia and into the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, no version of any scheme was ever built. In most cases the proposed reservoir would have extended upriver to Harpers Ferry, West Virginia. The project was part of a program of as many as sixteen major dams in the Potomac watershed, most of which were never built. The earliest proposals for exploitation of hydropower on the Potomac were made in the 1880s. By the 1920s the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers reviewed the possibilities for hydroelectric power. After a new study mandated by Congress in 1936-37, the Corps of Engineers in 1938 proposed a dam for flood control, power generation and water quality improvement, to be located above Great Falls at Riverbend. The scheme was revived following World War II. Opposition to the flooding of the entire river to Cumberland by a chain of dams, and to the inundation of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal doomed the Riverbend proposal. However, in 1963 the Corps proposed a new plan to improve water quality on the Potomac, which moved water storage off the main stem of the Potomac to its upper tributaries and scaled the Riverbend dam back to a lower dam at Blockhouse Point, near the mouth of Little Seneca Creek, to be called Seneca Dam. This proposal was debated through the 1960s until it was finally abandoned in 1969. Great Falls dam proposals Beginning in the 1880s a series of proposals were made to use the Potomac River's hydropower potential, which arises from the steep drop of the river at Great Falls as it crosses the Atlantic Seaboard fall line, dropping to sea level over about . Frequent flooding and a desire to secure a reliable water supply for Washington, D.C. increased the attractiveness of a major dam on the Potomac. A detailed plan for a major dam on the Potomac at Great Falls was first advanced by the Corps of Engineers in a 1921 report, which proposed a concrete gravity dam which would include a hydroelectric powerplant. Reservoir capacity was projected at for a reservoir with a reservoir at 215 feet above sea level. Power generation capacity was planned at 105 MWCorps of Engineers 1921, p. 49 and total cost was projected at $18,616,000 in 1921.Corps of Engineers 1921, p. 50 =Potomac Basin development= By direction of Congress in 1936 and 1937 the Army Corps of Engineers, which manages Washington D.C.'s water supply system, examined possibilities for flood control along the Potomac. The Corps returned with an ambitious agenda for 14 dams on the main stem of the Potomac, its branches and its major tributaries. Beginning at tidewater, a dam at Chain Bridge would extend to Bear Island, where another dam would back a reservoir up to Great Falls. Just above Great Falls the Riverbend Dam would create a reservoir up to Sandy Hook, just below Harpers Ferry. Dams at Sandy Hook, Rocky Marsh Run, Pinesburg and Little Orleans would convert the main stem of the river to a series of slackwater reservoirs. More dams on the North and South Forks of the Potomac, the North River and the Shenandoah River would complete the scheme. The Corps suggested that the discharge from the Riverbend Dam could enhance flow over Great Falls during daylight hours. Locks were to be provided to allow small craft to reach Harpers Ferry.The cost of this program was estimated at $235 million in 1945. The Corps plan, which would have inundated nearly all of the defunct Chesapeake and Ohio Canal was opposed by the National Park Service, which had acquired the canal property in 1938. A 1954 hearing at the Department of the Interior was attended by more than 1000 people, only three of whom spoke in favor of the Corps plan. In the meantime the Park Service had proposed its own plan for a parkway on the canal right- of-way from Cumberland to Washington. Opposition to this plan gained force during the 1950s and culminated in a 1954 letter to the Washington Post by U.S. Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas blasting the plan and urging the canal's preservation as a wild park, and challenging Post editors to walk the length of the canal towpath. Joined by conservation leaders and supported by the Park Service, the hike was accomplished in seven days and brought the preservationist cause extensive publicity. In 1958 the Corps again was directed by Congress to study dams, this time to improve water quality in addition to flood control. Tension between legislation for park use and water management use increased, until President Dwight D. Eisenhower proclaimed Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Monument under the authority of the Antiquities Act on January 18, 1961. The proclamation earned the enmity of House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee Chairman Wayne Aspinall. Later in 1961 a park authorization bill was proposed with Aspinall's support that would allow dam construction on the Potomac. In May 1962 the Corps proposed a new scheme for 16 dams on the Potomac and its tributaries. This version scrapped most of the mainstem dams in favor of more tributary dams, and moved the Riverbend Dam to a site at Seneca, upstream. The Seneca Dam was to be lower than Riverbend. Douglas immediately attacked the proposal, as did Maryland Representative Charles Mathias. A task force review in 1966 opposed the Seneca Dam. In 1968 draft legislation proposed the Potomac National River, eliminating the possibility of a Seneca Dam in favor of more tributary dams. However, this proposal was opposed by landowners and other interests in the areas earmarked for dams on the Monocacy, Cacapon and upper Potomac rivers. In 1968 Congress converted the national monument into Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park, effectively precluding dam construction anywhere along the length of the park. By 1969 the Seneca Dam proposal had been publicly abandoned by the Corps of Engineers. Water quality and supply concerns that had previously been cited as reasons for dam building were addressed by new Federal requirements for stringent sewage treatment, which greatly improved water quality on the lower Potomac, eliminating the need to dilute effluent in reservoirs. Mine waste discharge was also regulated, with dilution provided by the eventual construction of Jennings Randolph Lake on the North Branch of the Potomac by the Corps of Engineers. Riverbend Dam Dams proposed in the Potomac River basin in 1945 The Riverbend Dam was to be a dam at the westward bend of the Potomac just above Great Falls. Its reservoir was to extend nearly to Harpers Ferry, with branches extending up the Monocacy River past Frederick and major branches on streams in Loudoun County, Virginia. The dam was to incorporate small locks to allow pleasure boats to reach Harpers Ferry. After intense public opposition the Riverbend project was shelved in favor of less ambitious proposals Seneca Dam The final proposal for a lower Potomac dam was Seneca Dam. The concept developed in the 1950s and was proposed by the Corps of Engineers in its final form in the 1963 Potomac River Basin Report. Answering objections to the visual intrusion of the Riverbend Dam at Great Falls, Seneca Dam was placed at Blockhouse Point, about downstream from the mouth of Seneca Creek, about upstream from the Riverbend site and just downstream from the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal's Dam Number 2. No immediate hydroelectric development was planned, the dam was meant to provide a water source, to control floods, and to provide recreation. The Corps of Engineers assumed that water quality would continue to decline under the effects of upstream sewage discharge, especially during periods of low river flow, and opined that unless sewage was diverted by pipeline to the Chesapeake Bay, a dam would be necessary to dilute the effluent to an acceptable level. However, the Corps projected that the Seneca reservoir would not be able to assure sufficient water flow and quality without support from upstream dams on tributaries.Corps of Engineers 1963, p. 28 The dam was planned as a straight- crested concrete gravity dam with a central overflow spillway regulated by 27 gates. Provision for future power generation was to be included in the south abutment, with water supply provisions on either end of the dam. No lock was to be provided for small craft.Corps of Engineers 1963, Plate 17 For flood control the project was designed to pass of a flood to minimize damage downstream. Drawdown from May to September was expected to be about , with another for the rest of the year. The pool would have varied from at maximum flood pool to at full conservation pool, and at minimum pool. Construction was expected to take six years. The reservoir was planned to store , of which were allocated for sedimentation. An additional were available for flood storage. The reservoir was projected to cost more than $100 million in 1962 dollars. The project was opposed by Maryland and Virginia, as well as by conservation organizations and fell out of favor with the Corps of Engineers in 1969. As with the Riverbend proposal, the reservoir was to spread along tributary creeks and reservoirs, in some cases considerable distances. On the Virginia side, Sugarland Run would have been flooded to Herndon, Broad Run to Sterling, Goose Creek to Evergreen Mill and Catoctin Creek to Taylorstown. On the Maryland side, Seneca Creek would have been flooded past Dawsonville, and the Monocacy River would have been flooded past Frederick to Ceresville. The main river pool would have extended to Sandy Hook, Maryland. Maps of the reservoir show that portions of Point of Rocks and Buckeystown, Maryland would have been flooded by the full flood pool, and most or all of Lilypons and Seneca in Maryland, Limestone School and Fairview in Virginia and White's Ferry in Maryland and Virginia. The lower portion of the Ball's Bluff battlefield would have been submerged, as well as the Monocacy Aqueduct.Corps of Engineers 1963, Plates 18, 19 Roads and railroads were expected to be flooded by the reservoir and would have had to be replaced. The 1963 report described the relocations as \\"extensive.\\" Road relocations were budgeted at $8,500,000 and railroads at $10,040,000. About of wildlife habitat was expected to be inundated, including the McKee-Beshers and Dierssen wildlife management areas. of replacement habitat was expected to be required to mitigate habitat loss. The project was judged to have little effect on agriculture and forestry. 460 families were expected to be displaced.

Research  Huhtamo was born in Helsinki, Finland and has a PhD in cultural history from the University of Turku. Before moving to Los Angeles in 1999 to teach at UCLA, Huhtamo had been a professor of media studies at the University of Lapland, Rovaniemi, Finland (1994-1996) and worked as an adjunct professor at the University of Art and Design (UIAH, Helsinki, now part of Aalto University). Huhtamo published extensively in Finnish, most notably Virtuaalisuuden arkeologia (‚ÄúThe Archaeology of Virtuality,‚Äù The University of Lapland Press, 1995) and El√§v√§n kuvan arkeologia (‚ÄúThe Archaeology of the Moving Image,‚Äù YLE, Finnish Broadcasting Company Publishing, 1996). These books signaled Huhtamo‚Äôs entry into the field of media archaeology, which was only beginning to define its identity and which has characterized his research ever since. Since the mid-1990s, Huhtamo has written his research in English. It has covered a wide range of issues related with media culture and the technological arts, including interactive media, simulator entertainments, the genealogy of the screen, \\"peep media\\" (a notion he has coined), stereoscopic art and media in public spaces. His work has often been aimed to excavate, resurrect and analyze neglected and forgotten media. One of its guiding lines is the combination of topos theory with media archaeology. Influenced by the pioneering work of Ernst Robert Curtius (1886-1956), Huhtamo considers ‚Äútopoi‚Äù as formulas that traverse media culture, giving form to changing experiences and interpretations. Things that seem unprecedented, and are promoted as such by cultural agents, may in fact be topoi in disguise. Huhtamo has published in academic journals like Iconics, Cinema Journal, Early Popular Visual Culture, and The Journal of Visual Culture. To date his main research achievement is the large monograph Illusions in Motion: Media Archaeology of the Moving Panorama and Related Spectacles (MIT Press, 2013). With Jussi Parikka, Huhtamo is also the editor of the anthology Media Archaeology: Approaches, Applications, and Implications (University of California Press, 2011), which helped to define the field of media archaeology. The premise of media archaeology, according to Huhtamo, is ‚Äúto bring the present media culture and the culture of the past into a fruitful interaction.‚Äù Beside media archaeology, Huhtamo has published on the topic of curation and museums in various anthologies, including Museum Media and Museums in a Digital Age.  Work as exhibition curator Huhtamo worked as the programmer of the Muu Media Festival, Helsinki, between 1991-1993. Under its auspices he curated or co- curated several international exhibitions of interactive media art for the Otso Gallery, Espoo, Finland. They featured many first rank media artists, including Jeffrey Shaw, David Rokeby, Lynn Hershman, Ken Feingold, Luc Courchesne, and Christa Sommerer and Laurent Mignonneau, among others. Huhtamo was also the co-curator of the large ISEA ¬¥94 (Fifth International Symposium of Electronic Arts) Exhibition, The Museum of Contemporary Art, Atheneum, Helsinki. For ISEA ¬¥94, Huhtamo co-curated the first international exhibition of the work of the Japanese media artist Toshio Iwai (b. 1962). It was seen at the Otso Gallery, Espoo, and traveled to the ZKM, Karlsruhe, and the Dutch Design Institute, Amsterdam. In the same year, Huhtamo was the visiting artistic director of the Australian International Video Festival (Sydney, June 3‚Äì5, 1994). In 1995, he co-curated Digital Mediations for Alyce de Roulet Williamson Gallery, Art Center College of Design, Pasadena, and was a member of the International Organizing Committee of The Interactive Media Festival, Los Angeles. Huhtamo has co-curated a series of retrospective exhibitions dedicated to first rank media artists of international renown. These include Unexpected Obstacles. The Work of Perry Hoberman 1982-1997, shown at the Otso Gallery, Espoo, Finland (1997) and the ZKM, Karlsruhe (1998), Excavated Sounds: Paul DeMarinis (Otso Gallery, Espoo, 2000), Resonant Messages: Media Installations by Paul DeMarinis (Alyce de Roulet Williamson Gallery, Art Center College of Design, Pasadena, 2000-2001), and Sufficient Latitude: Interactive Wood Machines by Bernie Lubell (Alyce de Roulet Williamson Gallery, Art Center College of Design, Pasadena, 2008). Huhtamo‚Äôs largest curatorial effort to date has been the major exhibition Outo√§ly /Alien Intelligence (2000), which he created for the recently opened Kiasma Museum of Contemporary Art in Helsinki. Several new interactive media art installations were produced with the museum‚Äôs support for this exhibition, including The Giver of Names by David Rokeby, Head (now in Kiasma‚Äôs permanent collection) by Ken Feingold, and Autopoiesis by Kenneth Rinaldo.  Appearances and experiments Huhtamo appeared as an expert on the magic lantern in an episode of Storage Wars, in which a part of his personal collection of media archaeological objects can be seen. He is one of the featured specialists in Alice Arnold‚Äôs documentary feature Electric Signs (Icarus Films, USA, 2012). Beside writings and academic lectures, Huhtamo has disseminated his ideas in experimental ways. In 1998 he worked at the Institute for Visual Media at the ZKM, Karlsruhe, creating a high tech ‚Äúmedia archaeological installation‚Äù titled The Ride of Your Life, which utilized a professional motion simulation platform. The imagery consisted of a large number of ‚Äúride films‚Äù from the early silent cinema to contemporary theme parks, edited down into a four- minute super-ride. According to Huhtamo, the installation was ‚Äúan experiment in film historical discourse, a model for ‚Äòexperiential film history‚Äô.‚Äù The work was produced in co-operation with the Institute for Robotics at Karlsruhe University and exhibited at the SurroGate1 exhibition at the ZKM (1998). At the Ars Electronica festival 2006, Huhtamo performed on stage in a production titled Musings on Hands, which he created together with the American media artists Golan Levin and Zachary Lieberman (Tmema). An earlier version, Media Magic: Ghost in the Hand, had already been performed by Huhtamo, Levin and Lieberman in Tokyo at Waseda University‚Äôs Ono Memorial Hall as part of an event titled Media Art Meets Media Archaeology: an Evening of Lectures & Performances (2005). Huhtamo has given magic lantern shows using nineteenth- century magic lanterns and slides from his own collection. In August 2012 he performed a full length show titled From Dole to the Pole, or Professor Huhtamo‚Äôs Daring Adventures at the Velaslavasay Panorama, Los Angeles, assisted by the artists Amy-Claire Huestis (visual effects) and Michael Rabbitt (music and sound effects). In another stage production, Mareorama Resurrected (2011), Huhtamo impersonates, performing with a pianist and projected images, a nineteenth-century moving panorama showman lost in the twenty-first century. The production has been shown in Los Angeles, Chicago and Pittsburgh. Huhtamo presented a related ‚Äúshow and tell lecture‚Äù at the 60th International Short Film Festival in Oberhausen (2014).  Collection  Huhtamo owns a large collection of devices and documents related to early visual culture from the eighteenth to the early twentieth century. He first exhibited his collection at the Museum of Cultures, Helsinki, as an exhibition titled Phantasmagoria: Time Travelling in the Moving Image (2000-2001). Most of the objects included in the exhibition, and documented in an accompanying book he wrote, Fantasmagoria: el√§v√§n kuvan arkeologiaa (BTJ Kirjastopalvelu, 2000), now belong to the Museum of the Moving Image, Helsinki, where they have been exhibited. The museum closed its doors in June 2015. Objects and documents from Huhtamo‚Äôs current, more extensive collection have been used to illustrate his book Illusions in Motion and various articles. Some examples can be seen on Huhtamo‚Äôs website and in a YouTube video produced by UCLA‚Äôs Daily Bruin. Huhtamo has exhibited parts of his collection at UCLA‚Äôs Arts Library and Young Research Library, as well as at the Hammer Museum of Art, Los Angeles.  Japan connection In 1993 Huhtamo traveled to Tokyo to shoot a television series for YLE, the Finnish Broadcasting Company. It became The Empire of Monitors: Media Culture in Japan (1994), which he wrote and directed. Huhtamo has frequently lectured at major academic institutions like Waseda University (Tokyo), Kyoto University, and the Institute of Advanced Media Arts and Sciences (IAMAS, Ogaki City). Ever since the project was launched in the early 1990s, he has collaborated with the NTT InterCommunication Center (Tokyo Opera City, 1997-), a major institution exhibiting technological art, by giving talks and contributing texts to its publications. Huhtamo‚Äôs texts have been translated into Japanese more than any other language. A bibliography can be found from Huhtamo's first Japanese language book Media Kokogaku - Kako Genzai Mirai no Taiwa no Tameni (2015). One of his first publications in Japanese was ‚ÄúAn Archaeology of Moving Image Media,‚Äù a special issue of the Intercommunication Quarterly (No. 14, Autumn 1995, Tokyo: NTT ICC), which he edited.

Biography  Anna Johnson Dupree in 1913. Anna and Clarence Dupree in 1949 Dupree was born in Carthage and grew up in a family where they picked cotton to make a living. She was the \\"great-grandchild of a slaveholder and the grandchild of former slaves,\\" and stories she heard about life in slavery had a deep effect on her. Dupree grew up poor, living in a two-room house with her five siblings, her parents, and her grandmother. Dupree's mother \\"never permitted her to complain\\" of their poverty and \\"reminded her there were other children 'worse off' than she.\\" As a young woman in 1904, she moved to Galveston where she earned a living as a domestic worker. She was noticed for her sewing skills by a Mrs. Zula Kyle, who hired Dupree to work for her in Houston in 1911. Dupree would return home to Galveston often to visit her family. She met her husband, Clarence Dupree, who was from Louisiana, in Galveston. Anna Dupree would call Clarence a \\"very unusual person.\\" They were married in 1914, and moved to Houston in 1916. The Duprees saved money by \\"living simply\\" and they began to invest what they could into real estate. During World War I, Clarence was sent overseas to fight and during the conflict, he saved his money, returning to the United States with $1,000. During World War I, Anna Dupree continued to work and save money. She worked as a beautician and manicurist, and later, worked on her own, making beauty \\"house calls\\" which were so successful, white beauticians in Houston banded together to stop her. Dupree was stopped from making house calls, but she vowed to create her own shop. Dupree built her own beauty salon which also had a Turkish bath, a sweatbox and massage parlor in 1936. Together, the couple invested in other businesses and opened the Eldorado Ballroom in the Third Ward. The Eldorado was built in 1939 and was one of the first black clubs and entertainment venues in Houston. Previously, they had also opened the Pastime Theater in 1929. Other businesses that they opened included a pharmacy, men's apparel store, paint store and a nightclub. Dupree \\"startled not only the community, but the whole United States with a gift of $20,000 (equivalent to $283,000 in 2018) for the construction of a building for underprivileged Negro children\\" in March 1944. This was considered one of the largest gifts ever given by a Southern black person at the time. The place was named the Anna Dupree Cottage of the Negro Child Center and was located in the Fifth Ward. In 1952, the Duprees opened the Eliza Johnson Home for Aged Negros. The home was named in memory of Dupree's mother. Anna Dupree donated property in Highland Heights for the Eliza Johnson Home. Dupree would make fruit cobblers and fruit and boiled dumplings for the \\"old timers.\\" Dupree and her husband gave money to the Houston College of Negroes (Now Texas Southern University) and the United Negro College Fund. The couple gave $11,000 in 1946 to the Houston College of Negroes so that the college could construct its first permanent building. They also raised money for Camp Robinhood, the first black Girl Scout camp, and sponsored the first Little League baseball team for blacks in Houston. When her husband died in 1959, Dupree's health declined and eventually she moved into the Eliza Johnson Home. She died there on February 19, 1977, and her body was donated to medical research.

She married Wilfred Russell, a Canadian businessman, in 1925, and he soon moved to Springfield to work in the tobacco business. About the same time, her sister Mary married Wilfred's former business partner, William Stephenson. Julia bought 71.2 acres of land that the house stands on in April 1933 from E. S. Moore and the house was built c. 1935. Though the house is now within the Springfield city limits, the area was agricultural at the time and the Russells had tobacco fields near the house. The Russell House was purchased in December 2011 by Greg and Stephanie Lee who rent it for weddings and special events. In 2018, a Holiday Inn opened up in the front lot of the house.

Early life Colbert was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, on 31 December 1883. After primary and secondary education in Boston, Massachusetts, he attended Tufts University, from which he graduated with a degree in civil engineering in 1907.history.noaa.gov Profiles in Time: C&GS; Biographies: Leo Otis Colbert Career =Early career= On 1 July 1907, Colbert began his career with the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, which at the time was an entirely civilian organization. He served in coastal waters of the United States, Philippines, and Territory of Alaska as an civilian officer aboard ships of the Coast and Geodetic Survey's fleet of survey ships, serving as navigator and executive officer, and in 1912 he became a commanding officer for the first time, taking command of a survey ship in Alaskan waters.NOAA History: World War I Military Records of Coast & Geodetic Survey Personnel: Leo Otis Colbert =World War I= After the United States entered World War I on the side of the Allies on 6 April 1917, Colbert became one of the original 119 commissioned officers of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps upon its creation as a new uniformed service of the United States on 22 May 1917, serving as a commissioned hydrographic and geodetic engineer. In accordance with Executive Order 2707, Colbert was among Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps officers transferred to the jurisdiction of the United States Department of the Navy for wartime service with the United States Navy. His first assignment was to the Seattle Field Station of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, and during this tour he also served as a navigation instructor at the Naval Camp at the University of Washington in Seattle, Washington. On 23 February 1918, Colbert reported aboard the U.S. Navy troopship at Puget Sound Navy Yard in Bremerton, Washington, for her voyage to New York City and assumed duties as assistant navigator and watch officer. Originally, he was supposed to detach from the ship in New York, but the ship's commanding officer retained him on board due a shortage of qualified watch officers and Colbert remained with Northern Pacific as she made her first transatlantic voyage as a troop transport to France, where she arrived at Brest in April 1918. After the ship's arrival in France, Colbert's assignment to her became permanent, with duties as a watch officer and division officer. On 4 August 1918, he was appointed a lieutenant commander in the United States Naval Reserve Force and became the ship's first lieutenant In all, Colbert made nine voyages aboard Northern Pacific carrying troops from New York to Brest and returning to New York through Atlantic Ocean waters in which German submarines were conducting an antishipping campaign against Allied ships. After the conclusion of the war on 11 November 1918, Colbert made two more New York-to-Brest-and-return voyages. During one of these, Northern Pacific ran aground off Fire Island, New York, on 1 January 1919 while carrying many wounded troops back to the United States from France, necessitating transfers of the wounded to other vessels over the next four days as weather permitted. Northern Pacific was not refloated for 19 days. Colbert's assignment to U.S. Navy duty came to an end on 29 March 1919. =Later career= On 30 March 1919, Colbert returned to duty in the Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps. In April 1920, the U.S. Steamboat Inspection Service issued him a certificate as Master of Steam Vessels, Unlimited Tonnage, Any Ocean. He had a tour of duty at Coast and Geodetic Survey headquarters in Washington, D.C., then served as Director of Coast Surveys in the Philippines from 1928 to 1930. From 1933 to 1938, he was the Chief of the Division of Charts at the Coast and Geodetic Survey's Washington, D.C., office, and during his tour the Division of Charts completed 87 aeronautical charts and began work on other series of special charts for long-distance flying. In 1938, Colbert became the third Director, Coast and Geodetic Survey, reaching the rank of rear admiral. During his 12 years as director, he oversaw the expanded activities of the Coast and Geodetic Survey as it supported the U.S. war effort during the U.S. participation in World War II from December 1941 to August 1945. He later guided the Coast and Geodetic Survey through the earliest years of the Cold War. =Retirement= Colbert retired as director of the Coast and Geodetic Survey on 7 April 1950 after a career of nearly 43 years, nearly 33 of them as an officer in the Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps. Professional life Colbert was a member of the American Society of Civil Engineers, the American Geophysical Union, the American Society of Photogrammetry, the Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers, the Institute of Navigation, the American Shore and Beach Preservation Association, and the advisory council of the department of civil engineering at Princeton University. He was a director of the Society of American Military Engineers, a fellow of the Arctic Institute of North America, a life trustee of the National Geographic Society, and an honorary trustee of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Tufts University awarded Colbert an honorary doctor of science degree in 1938 or 1939 (sources differ).

All Saints Church falls within the Diocese of Amritsar and along with Holy Family Catholic Church, is one of the two Christian churches in the city. The church is dedicated to All Saints.  History  All Saints church dates from the 1890s - at the time when the opening of the Jhelum Valley road, and the establishment of a British Residency in Kashmir, prompted an increasing number of Brits to come to Srinagar. It was a hill station - a place to escape the heat of the plains. And for a few hundred among the British, it became their home. There was a club, a posh hotel (Nedou's), a social scene, many houseboats - and also, in time, a church.  Architecture  All Saints has changed hugely over the past 120 years. Only the base of the tower remains from the original construction. The church had been burnt down during protests in the 1960s and again in the 1970s. It was rebuilt using a Russian design, and making less use of wood to make it less vulnerable to fire. It was badly hit - along with so much of riverside Srinagar - in the 2014 floods.

Thompson was a conservative Republican who represented a large rural district. He served as President of the Oregon Senate during the 1915 legislative session. Thompson was one of Oregon's most prominent trial attorneys, handling a number of high- profile cases including one, Bunting v. Oregon, that required him to present arguments before the United States Supreme Court.  Early life  Thompson was born on January 1, 1880 in Linn County, Oregon, the son of Rufus and Adaline (Hill) Thompson. His father was a successful rancher, and for a time, a postmaster.

Later that year, Thompson was elected Lakeview's city attorney. Over the next few years, he built a successful private law practice, bought ranch property in south central Oregon, and joined several civic and fraternal groups.

After he was elected, Thompson announced he would run for Speaker of the House, one of three legislators seeking that post. In the House, Republicans outnumbered Democrats 58 to 2, so the struggle for speaker was between various factions of the Republican Party. As the leader of the conservative Republican bloc in the House (a group Oregon newspapers called the Old Guard), Thompson made a very strong run for the speaker position.\\"Thompson Looms for Speakership\\", Oregon Daily Journal, Portland, Oregon, January 1, 1911, p. 3.\\"Speakership May Be Free-For-All\\", Oregon Daily Journal, Portland, Oregon, January 3, 1911, p. 3.

During the 1915 legislative session, Thompson proposed a major revision of Oregon's judicial system. The bill would have increased the number of circuit court judges and transferred trial work from county judges (local political leaders) to circuit judges (members of the Oregon Bar). It would also have created a circuit court of appeals.\\"Thompson Bill Seeks To Create Circuit Judges\\", Evening Herold, Klamath Falls, Oregon, January 20, 1915, p. 1.

Despite the session's political give-and- take, Thompson was recognized by his senate colleagues for his evenhanded leadership. At the close of the session, all of his colleagues, including the senate's two Democrats and both of the Republican senators who did not vote for him at the beginning of the session, lauded his leadership.\\"Thompson is Given Token of Esteem by Other Senators\\", Oregon Daily Journal, Portland, Oregon, February 20, 1915, p. 3.

Trial attorney  While he was running for his second term in the senate, Thompson continued his trial work. This included a very important case, Bunting v. Oregon, that eventually was heard by the United States Supreme Court. In that case, Thompson's client was Frank Bunting, a sawmill employee, who was challenging Oregon's ten-hour workday law. Thompson presented Bunting's case to the Supreme Court in April 1916. Despite his arguments, the court ruled in favor of the State of Oregon.\\"Court Tries Oregon Case\\", Eugene Register, Eugene, Oregon, April 19, 1916, p. 3.\\"Interest in Oregon 10 Hour Law Case Shown by Justices\\", Oregon Daily Journal, Portland, Oregon, April 24, 1916, p. 11. Another important case dealt with water rights in the Summer Lake valley and along the Chewaucan River near Paisley, Oregon. Thompson defended the water rights claim of the Chewaucan Land and Livestock Company against development companies and the settlers who bought land from those companies. Initially, the state water board ruled in favor of the developers. The cattle company appealed in state court, and the district judge, Bernard Daly, reversed the water board's decision. The developers then asked the legislature to overrule the district court, but Thompson successfully lobbied his former colleagues to prevent their intervention. This allowed the district court decision to stand.\\"W.

In April 1917, Thompson decided to leave Lakeview to join a private law firm in Portland. He became a partner in the legal firm of Snow, McCamant, and Bronaugh, replacing Wallace McCamant who had just been appointed to the Oregon Supreme Court. When Thompson arrived in Portland, the firm was renamed Snow, Bronaugh, and Thompson.\\"W. Lair Thompson Moves to Portland\\", Oregon Daily Journal, Portland, Oregon, April 11, 1917, p. 10. Later, when McCamant left the Supreme Court and returned to the practice, the firm was renamed McCamant, Bronaugh, and Thompson.\\"Justice McCamant Resigns His Seat\\", Oregon Daily Journal, Portland, Oregon, May 30, 1918, p. 5. Eventually, the firm became McCamant and Thompson (now Miller Nash Graham & Dunn LLP).\\"Wallace McCamant Biography\\", State of Oregon Law Library, www.Oregon.gov, Salem, Oregon, accessed February 6, 2016. Over the years in Portland, Thompson handled many high-profile cases, becoming one of Oregon's most prominent trial attorneys. While many of his clients were big corporations, including Portland shipyards and steel companies and large lumber and natural resources companies throughout the Pacific Northwest,Fifield, James Clark, \\"McCamant and Thompson\\", American Bar 1922, Jame Clark Company, Minneapolis, Minnesota, 1921pp. 858-859.\\"Big Mortgage is Issue\\", Bend Bulletin, Bend, Oregon, February 3, 1920, p. 1.\\"Moore is Here for Inquiry into Yard\\", Oregon Daily Journal, Portland, Oregon, April 23, 1920, p. 1 & 3.\\"Chiselers Free to Slash Rates\\", Daily Capital Journal, Salem, Oregon, October 31, 1934, p. 1. he also defended individuals facing criminal charges. For example, he defended a wealthy individual for violating Oregon's Prohibition law in 1918.\\"F.J. Cobbs Pays $150 Fine\\", Oregon Daily Journal, Portland, Oregon, April 17, 1918, p. 3. A year later, he defended an individual against cattle rustling charges in eastern Oregon.\\"Famous Cattle Stealing Case is Heard in Court\\", Oregon Statesman, Salem, Oregon, April 5, 1919, p. 5. On the civil side of the law, Thompson sued six residents of Toledo, Oregon, on behalf of Japanese labors employed by the Pacific Spruce Company, who were driven out of town by a mob of white residents.\\"Final Argument Heard in Toledo Case in Portland\\", Oregon Daily Journal, Portland, Oregon, July 22, 1926, p. 2.

In 1926, he was elected president of the Oregon State Bar Association. In 1930, the Oregon Supreme Court appointed Thompson to prosecute George W. Joseph in a disbarment case. This was an extremely high-profile case because Joseph became a candidate for governor just prior to the case going to trail. The trial began on April 15. Joseph won the Republican primary against four other candidates on May 16. On May 27, the Supreme Court announced Joseph's disbarment. Joseph decided to continue his campaign, but died of a heart attack a few weeks later.\\"Political Drama of 25 Years Ago Recalled on Anniversary Date of G.W. Joseph's Death\\", Daily Capital Journal, Salem, Oregon, June 16, 1955, p. 24. Thompson's highest profile case was probably the Bowles-Loucks murder case. In 1931, a young millionaire from Portland named Nelson C. Bowles and his secretary Irma Loucks were accused of murdering Bowles' wife, Leone. Thompson led the defense team. The theory he offered the jury was that Leone had committed suicide. The trial became even more sensational when a key prosecution witness was stabbed and beaten at her home during the course of the trial. The witness recovered, but her testimony was not as useful as the prosecution had hoped. In fact, Thompson used her testimony to back up several important defense points. At the close of the trial, the jury took just an hour to acquit both Bowles and Louck.\\"Bowles and Loucks have Joint Trial\\", Daily Capital Journal, Salem, Oregon, January 17, 1931, p. 1 & 10.'\\"Defense in Bowles Murder Case Offers $1000 Reward\\", Spokane Daily News, Spokane, Washington, January 15, 1931, p. 1.\\"Jury Frees Bowles, Loucks, Parleying Little Over Hour\\", Oregon Statesman, Salem, Oregon, March 29, 1931, p. 1.\\"Tense Moment Ends Happily\\", Oregon Statesman, Salem, Oregon, March 29, 1931, p. 2.

It is probably the most fully illustrated manuscript of the text ever produced. When created, the manuscript contained 759 pages, 258 of which were miniatures. These miniatures were hand painted by the artists of the royal workshop in Tabriz under rulers Shah Ismail I and Shah Tahmasp I. Upon its completion, the Shahnameh was gifted to Ottoman Sultan Selim II in 1568. The page size is about 48 x 32 cm, and the text written in Nasta ølƒ´q script of the highest quality. The manuscript was broken up in the 1970s and pages are now in a number of different collections around the world. History It was created in Tabriz at the order of Shah Ismail I who had recently taken control of the city. Shah Ismail I was a charismatic and militarily aggressive leader, which allowed him to conquer large swaths of territory with cosmopolitan populations. Because of this, he had access to a wide variety of artists with many specialties and training in different styles, which allowed for the collaboration of artists and resulted in a new style of illumination later named the Tabriz Style. He commissioned the most prominent artists of Safavid Persia, to illustrate this manuscript as a demonstration of the shift in political landscape and as an assertion of his dominance as the Shah. A commission of the Shahnameh was a common way to assert legitimacy as a ruler because the text portrays the shah as a strong, stable individual who was to be unquestionably obeyed and respected. Such an expensive and lavishly decorated manuscript would have presented Ismail I as a successful and powerful leader tied to the strength and notoriety of the Persians. Most likely, the manuscript was either intended to ultimately be given as a gift to Suleiman the Magnificent, sultan of the Ottoman Empire, or perhaps to celebrate the return of his son Tahmasp from a period as governor of Herat.Piotrovsky and Rogers, 112 The Shahnameh has been described as a mixture of a mythology and a history of the Iranian people. This makes it comparable to works with similar themes from other regions of the world, such as the Old Testament's Book of Kings or the Iliad. Although the exact dates are still debated, most scholars believe the work began in the 1520s. It would have taken multiple generations of artists to complete, and many great artists took the position of director, including Sultan Mohammad, Mir Musavvir, and Aqa Mirak. Shah Ismail I died in 1524 shortly after the work on the manuscript had begun. Tahmasp I then succeeded the throne, but at 11 years old was certainly not old enough to recognize the importance of promoting great art and culture in society. Presumably, his advisers pushed for completion of the manuscript and it was likely close to completion by the mid-1530sWalther & Wolf, 424 during his reign. The Shahnameh was finally given to the Ottoman Sultan, Selim II, in 1568. Ottoman sources reveal that it arrived at the Iranian Embassy in February 1568, accompanied by 34 camels and other lavish gifts intended for the sultan. Both the sultan and his palace members were impressed with the manuscript, which was estimated to be 30,000 couplets long when it was first presented. It long remained in the Topkapƒ± Palace library in Istanbul, and commentaries added in the margins around 1800 prove that the remarkably decorated manuscript fascinated many rulers and scholars long after its completion. When the Ottoman empire fell apart in the early 1900s, the manuscript appeared in the collection of Edmond James de Rothschild.Walther & Wolf, 420 It stayed in the Rothschild family and then was acquired by Arthur Houghton II. The manuscript once contained 258 miniatures, but were sold individually by Houghton to avoid taxes. Houghton kept 118 miniatures for himself, donated 78 paintings to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1972 and sold the rest to other privately and publicly owned collections around the world. Following the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran, efforts were made to reclaim miniatures from this manuscript but never succeeded. The Metropolitan's miniatures have been the subject of a 15 million dollar exchange agreement with the National Museum of Iran. The dispersed miniatures are in several collections, including the Khalil Collections, which holds 10 folios.Piotrovsky and Rogers, 112-117; Walther & Wolf, 420 On 6 April 2011, a page from this manuscript from the collection of the leading scholar of the manuscript, Stuart Cary Welch, was sold for 7.4 million pounds ($12 million). Miniatures IRAN Miniatur by UNESCO 1957- 12Rox battle The huge scale of the work, which consisted of 759 pages total including 258 miniatures, would have required help from all the leading artists of the royal workshop. Some of the artists identified are Mir Sayyid Ali, Sultan Mohammad, Mizra-Ali (son of Sultan Mohammad) Aqa Mirak, Mir Musavvir, Dust Muhammad, and likely Abd al- Samad.Walther and Wolf, 420; for Abd al-Samad, see his biography; there is some controversy over his contributions A number of artists have been identified from their style by scholars, but are not known by name.Piotrovsky and Rogers, 112-117 Each page size is about 48 x 32 cm with text written in quality Nasta ølƒ´q script. The style of the miniatures varies considerably, though the quality is consistently high. Although many of the miniatures have mythical motifs, they also depict everyday objects that would have been common in the Safavid period in Iran. This makes the miniatures unique to a specific time and place. The manuscript shows the fusion of the styles of the schools of Herat, where the Timurid royal workshops had developed a style of classical restraint and elegance, and the painters of Tabriz, whose style was more expressive and imaginative. Tabriz was the former capital of the Turkmen rulers, successively of the Kara Koyunlu and Aƒü Qoyunlu, who had ruled much of Persia before Ismail I defeated them and began the Safavid dynasty in 1501.Titley, 80; Walther & Wolf, 420-424 Dust Muhammad wrote an account of Persian painting which mentions the manuscript. It is the first of many accounts to single out the Court of Guyumars (illustrated here), which he says is by Sultan Mohammad, whom he refers to as a ‚Äúzenith of the age.\\" Later scholars have called this miniature \\"matchless\\" and \\"probably the greatest picture in Iranian art.\\"Titley, 83; Welch, 17, both quoted Dust Muhammad's account also emphasizes the astonishing talents of portrait artists Aqa Mirak and Mir Musavvir, who also illustrated the Khamsa of Nizami. A famous unfinished miniature showing Rustam asleep, while his horse Rakhsh fights off a lion, was probably made for the manuscript, but was never finished and bound in, perhaps because its vigorous Tabriz style did not please Tahmasp. It appears to be by Sultan Mohammad, whose later works in the manuscript show a style adapted to the court style of KamƒÅl ud-Dƒ´n BehzƒÅd. It is now in the British Museum.Canby (1993), 79-80 One of the more prominent miniatures, He Kills the White Div, features Rustam killing a White Div (or demon) as part of his journey in rescuing King Kay Kavus. The colorful foliage surrounding Rustam and the Div is meant to counter to the black void, which symbolizes the Div‚Äôs expansive cave, in the hostile region of Mazandaran, around the two figures.

The castle is peculiar and unique for it turtle-like layout. Southeast point of castle Northwest point of castle History The present structure was commissioned by Federico da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino from his architect Francesco di Giorgio Martini (1439‚Äì1502), and the castle was built as a compact brick and stone building with tall sloping walls. The fort passed on to Ottaviano degli Ubaldini della Carda, brother of Duke Federico. The heraldic symbols in the castle belong to Ottaviano. The castle then passed to the Doria family of Genoa, who after 1511, became counts of Sassocorvaro. Interior courtyard The Counts of Sassocorvo died out in 1626, and the territory entered the Papal states. In 1706 the property was granted to Giovanni Cristoforo Battelli, Archbishop of Amasia, librarian and counselor to Pope Clement XI Albani. Monsignor Battelli restored the castle, rebuilding a chapel and created a library. To the latter have been added papers and volumes from the Archbishopric. In the late 19th- century, the interiors were refurbished, creating a large hall, theater, and the interiors were decorated in 1895 by Enrico Mancini in a neoclassical style.Rocca Ubaldinesca history. During the Second World War, the castle was used by Pasquale Rotondi to hide many works being targeted for looting by the Fascist armies. The castle now serves as the museum of the commune and includes an early 16th-century altarpiece depicting the Madonna and Child with Saints Sebastian, Roch and Nicol√≤ by Evangelista da Pian di Meleto as well as Baroque paintings. It contains designs and works by Enrico Mancini (1867-1913), who also decorated the 19th-century Teatrino built into what was once the main hall of the fort.Museo in Montefeltro.Rocca Ubaldinesca official site.

The phone was marketed as \\"Cloud-first\\" where it utilized cloud storage to store data which wouldn't be used for a long period of time, thus saving space in the device's local storage. The product and crowdfunding campaign was launched on Kickstarter on September 1, 2015. Twelve hours after it was launched, the phone reached its funding goal of US$500,000, much earlier than the expected goal of 30 days, and completed its US$1 million goal within two weeks. It was launched on 16 February 2016 where 1000 units of the GSM variant was shipped to its backers on Kickstarter, and an additional 2300 units were sold through its official website. In January 2017, Nextbit was bought by Singaporean-American videogame hardware manufacturer Razer Inc.. Sales of the phone were halted almost immediately after the announcement. On March 1, 2018, the cloud storage feature was shut down by Nextbit. 10 months after the acquisition, in November 2017, Razer released the Razer Phone, their first game-centric smartphone, with the overall design based on the Robin. Specifications =Hardware= The Robin was mostly made of polycarbonate with a matte finish and a Gorilla Glass 4 front panel. The device weighs approximately and is tall, wide, and thick. The display of the device is a IPS LCD with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels and pixel density of 424 ppi. It is powered by a hexa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 (MSM8992), with a 2 + 4 custom processor configuration (2x 1.82 GHz Cortex-A57 + 4x 1.44 GHz Cortex-A53) and 3 GB of LPDDR3 RAM. =Storage= The Robin comes with a built-in 32 GB of internal storage, but does not feature microSD card expansion. Instead, the smartphone utilized cloud storage. It had 100 GB of usable cloud storage offered by Nextbit out of the box, which is integrated within the phone's software as an additional \\"external\\" storage. Shortly after being purchased by Razer, Nextbit shut down the cloud storage feature on March 1, 2018, with data accessible until April 1, 2018. When installed applications, for example, were not used by the user for a long period, the smartphone automatically detected them and archived them into the cloud to reduce internal storage usage. It also adapted to the usage patterns of the user and performed the backup process whenever applicable. The smartphone also stored the user's photos in the cloud in the default resolution appropriate for upload, until the user specified the resolution. Reception =Sales= Pre-orders after the Kickstarter campaign began in October 2015, with shipping set to start in February 2016. =Known issues= The Robin had suffered performance issues upon launch, including lag and slow performance of the camera.Nextbit Robin review: serious performance issues (Wired UK) These issues were marked as resolved by Nextbit by releasing software updates in March and April.

It is traversed by the Carrieton-Barata Road, the Carrieton-Belton Road and the Weira Creek. The locality was established on 26 April 2013 in respect to ‚Äúthe long established local name.‚Äù History The European settlement of the area which now forms the modern locality of Belton was first formalised as three cadastral hundreds when the area was opened up for pastoral purposes: the Hundred of Eurilpa, the Hundred of McCulloch, and the Hundred of Bendleby. The Hundred of Eurilpa and the Hundred of Bendleby were proclaimed in January 1877 by Governor Anthony Musgrave, followed by the Hundred of McCulloch in February 1886 by Governor William C. F. Robinson, named for state MP Alexander McCulloch. The latter two hundreds remained almost entirely pastoral, although a Bendleby Post Office opened on 17 February 1891 and closed on 22 May 1919. A former unbounded locality in the Hundred of Eurilpa, Uroonda, also now lies within the boundaries of Belton. Uroonda Post Office opened on 1 April 1883 and closed around 1908. The government town of Belton was proclaimed in 1882 by Governor William Jervois in the Hundred of Eurilpa. A school opened in 1886, but closed a short time after; a provisional school opened again in 1889; it too later closed. The town had a branch of the South Australian Farmers Association from 1885 to 1887. Drought was a perennial problem, as the town lies north of Goyder's Line. Belton Post Office opened on 1 April 1883, provisionally closed on 31 December 1968, and closed permanently on 31 March 1969. The town also possessed a store for a number of years. The locality of Belton includes the site of the government town of Cobham which was proclaimed on 1 February 1883 and which was cancelled on 8 July 1915.

La condizione manicomiale fotografata da Carla Cerati e Gianni Berengo Gardin, first published in 1969, is a polemical work about the conditions in Italian mental hospitals of the time, edited by Franco Basaglia and Franca Ongaro Basaglia and with black and white photographs by Carla Cerati and Gianni Berengo Gardin, an introduction by the Basaglias, and various other texts. Background In the 1960s, the psychiatrist Franco Basaglia was the director of a mental hospital in Gorizia. Although expected to run it along traditional, prisonlike lines, Basaglia, his wife and their team instead reduced the constraints on the patients, so that by 1967 the locks were removed from all of the wards, in line with the ideals of democratic psychiatry. Basaglia wrote about this in a popular book published in 1968, L'istituzione negata. Rapporto da un ospedale psichiatrico (The institution denied: Report from a psychiatric hospital); and the changes he was making became more widely known via a television documentary, I giardini di Abele (The gardens of Abel), made by Sergio Zavoli in 1968 and first transmitted in 1969. Photography In the account of the photographer Gianni Berengo Gardin, in 1968, Franco Basaglia asked the photographer to document the conditions in Italian mental asylums for a magazine. Nervous about this, Cerati asked Berengo Gardin to accompany her; he agreed on condition that he too would take photographs, and he later persuaded Basaglia to turn the work into a book. In the account of the historian John Foot, there is no mention of a magazine, and an early plan for the book called for photographs by both Cerati and Berengo Gardin, both of whom were already known to Basaglia. In the latter account the institutions shown in the book were not to be limited to mental hospitals. Cerati and Berengo Gardin photographed in four hospitals: at Gorizia (Basaglia's own mental hospital), Colorno (near Parma), Florence and Ferrara. The photographers' degree of freedom varied considerably: they were only once able to enter the Florence asylum (where they were not welcomed by the management), but were very free to work in Gorizia. Their photography was under other constraints. Although Berengo Gardin photographed meetings among patients at Gorizia, and scenes where Basaglia was present, these were omitted from the book: Basaglia wanted to avoid the impression of paternalism, and Foot charges that the photographs of Gorizia avoid its current state (unusually liberated for the time) and merely depict its repressive past, as a plank in an overtly polemical work. Before publication of the book, and with the encouragement of the politician Mario Tommasini, an exhibition titled La violenza istituzionalizzata was arranged in Parma (later moving to Florence); this was the first public showing of many of the photographs that would later appear in Morire di classe. Photographs that would later appear in the book were also used within the film I giardini di Abele, for other books, and leaflets. Text The book has an introduction by the Basaglias, and also texts by Erving Goffman, Michel Foucault, Paul Nizan, Luigi Pirandello, Primo Levi, Louis Le Guillant and , Jonathan Swift, Rainer Maria Rilke, Frantz Fanon, Peter Weiss and others. Foot points out how both the introduction and the text reproduced employ the notion, whether created by Goffman or popularized by him, of the total institution, important in Goffman's 1961 book Asylums, whose Italian translation had been published in 1968. An asylum was totalitarian (Goffman and Foucault), it \\"colonized\\" the inmates (Fanon), or it reduced them to the \\"hollow\\" people of concentration camps (Levi). Book design The photobook Morire di classe. La condizione manicomiale fotografata da Carla Cerati e Gianni Berengo Gardin (Dying because of your class: The condition of asylums photographed by Carla Cerati and Gianni Berengo Gardin) was published by Einaudi in May 1969. Largely edited by Franco Basaglia and the staff of the its publisher, Einaudi, the book has a lilac cover and a design that owes much to advertising practice of the time: > Here, the images and photos themselves took centre stage. This was a design > object, a political and sociological photobook, a book to be looked at (or > looked away from) as much as read. As well as attempting to revolutionize > mental health care, the Basaglias (along with Giulio Bollati, who worked for > the Turinese publisher Einaudi) were also attempting to transform the world > of books and political campaigning. The appearance of Morire di Classe was a > memorable moment in the history of the movement, and also in the history of > publishing. Although the photographers are named on the title page, individual photographs are unattributed. Likewise, the book does not say which images are from which asylum. None of those taken in Ferrara are used in this book. Certain photographs, or minor variations of them, are repeated, for a somewhat cinematic effect. For rhetorical effect, there are also photographs not taken in mental hospitals: Foot cites a photograph of a policeman seemingly about to hit a demonstrator or the photographer, and: > [a] shot of rich young people lounging around in a party, with a marble > table and expensive paintings on the walls above them, [that] is placed > opposite a series of bodies/patients from an asylum, sprawled on the ground > and all in uniform. One is in a strait jacket. Photographic significance The historian David Forgacs has identified Morire di classe as one of three major artistic works to come out of the Italian movement in the late 1960s to reform psychiatric care, the other two being the 1969 book edited by Basaglia, L'istituzione negata and the 1969 television documentary I giardini di Abele; Morire di classe was \\"in effect the photographic supplement to [these two].\\" Although psychiatric patients had long been the subject of photography for classificatory or other purposes, Morire di classe has been called \\"the first book ever published worldwide to show the cruelties perpetrated against psychiatric patients\\". Certainly it was a very early one, though Luciano D'Alessandro's Gli esclusi, made in southern Italy with the cooperation of , was also published in 1969. Morire di classe was published after I giardini di Abele was first shown. The latter was one of a series of documentaries titled TV7 whose average viewing figure for 1969 was 11 million. It was an early example of an Italian documentary about a total institution, but not the earliest. Martin Parr and Gerry Badger describe Morire di classe as a \\"harrowing portrayal of the conditions in an Italian mental asylum\\", and in the tradition of earlier \\"polemical photo-documentary books\\" combining photography and text such as An American Exodus (1939) by Dorothea Lange and Paul S. Taylor and Kan vi v√¶re dette Bekendt? (1946) by Karl Roos. The book raises an issue of photojournalistic ethics. Parr and Badger comment: > [O]ne must be wary of bodies of work featuring mental patients. In cases > where those photographed do not know or care what is happening to them, > there is a fine line between revelation and exploitation, between compassion > and prurient excitement. That line is not crossed here. > [T]he book was an important plank in the eventually successful campaign > waged by Franco Basaglia to have the kind of institution shown in Carla > Cerati and Gianni Berengo Gardin's photographs closed down. Asked for a career retrospective to pick the one book among the many he had produced that he would like to be known two hundred years into the future, Berengo Gardin was unable to decide among Italiani, a book on rice cultivation, and Morire di classe. Social impact The book has been widely cited as a factor toward the reform of mental hospitals in Italy (and subsequently in other countries) via law 180 (the \\"Basaglia law\\") of 1978. Foot quotes both photographers saying as much, and quotes or cites a number of Italian sources agreeing. Here are two examples from the literature about Berengo Gardin: > Morire di classe [...] was perhaps the most effective means by which [the > Basaglias] led their campaign against the hypocrisy of the institutions, and > prejudices and platitudes that separated the mentally ill from the rest of > society. Once again, a few images proved to be more eloquent and effective > than thousands of words. > Morire di classe was to prove fundamental in the process that would lead to > the passing, in 1978, of Law 180 (or the Basaglia Reform) and the consequent > closure of the country's lunatic asylums. However, Foot points out that although the book and the timing of its publication would be compatible with the claim for it as being a major factor, the claim that it caused change would be much harder to support. Foot says that \\"there is no evidence at all for many of the claims that are made about Morire di Classe\\". But whatever its influence, > Morire di Classe became a manifesto for Basaglia and the doctors who > rejected institutional psychiatry: in that photographic book, photography > acted as an interpretation of a social and scientific event but, most of > all, it acted as a testimony, as communicative evidence of the horrifying > conditions of mental hospitals and the need to abolish them. Subsequent editions First published in 1969, the book was reprinted in the 1970s. In 2008 it was given a new edition, identical but for the addition of texts by the sociologist of politics Maria Grazia Giannichedda and the journalist and photographer Claudio Ern√®, as well as an editorial note. The photographs also appear in Per non dimenticare: 1968. La realt√† manicomiale di \\"Morire di classe\\" (1998). A larger selection of the photographs by Berengo Gardin (although not those by Cerati) appear in Manicomi: psichiatria e antipsichiatria nelle immagini degli anni settanta (2015).

It has smooth grey and brownish bark with loose ribbons of bark near the base, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of up to thirteen, creamy white flowers and conical to barrel-shaped fruit. Description Eucalyptus hebetifolia is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and has loose, rough bark on the lower half of the trunk, smooth grey and brownish bark above. Young plants and coppice regrowth have broadly lance-shaped leaves long and wide. Adult leaves are lance-shaped, the same dull bluish green on both sides, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of up to thirteen on an unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds on pedicels long. Mature buds are spindle-shaped, long and wide with a conical operculum about twice as long as the floral cup. Flowering occurs between December and March and the flowers are creamy white or very pale yellow. The fruit is a woody barrel-shaped to conical capsule long and wide with the valves near rim level. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus hebetifolia was first formally described in 1991 by Ian Brooker and Stephen Hopper from a specimen collected near Tincurrin. The description was published in the journal Nuytsia. The specific epithet hebetifolia is derived from the Latin hebes, 'dull' and folium, 'leaf', referring to the dull leaves that contrast with those of E. phaenophylla.

Consisting of the songs \\"Hello\\" (; \\"Ipgim\\"; lit. \\"Breath\\") and \\"Fireworks\\" (; \\"Bulkkonnori\\"), they were released on January 15, 2016, under FNC Entertainment and MagicStrawberry Sound, respectively. After the two independently wrote incomplete lyrics to separate songs with each other in mind, Jung reached out to Sunwoo for a collaboration. Deemed as \\"fate\\", Sunwoo accepted and the two agreed upon a \\"double collaboration\\". An acoustic ballad and dance-pop number, respectively, \\"Hello\\" and \\"Fireworks\\" both revolve around the theme of love. The songs received generally favorable reviews from music critics, who commended the vocal performance by Jung and Sunwoo. \\"Hello\\" peaked at number 45 on the Gaon Digital Chart; \\"Fireworks\\" failed to rank on that chart, but peaked at number 86 on the Download Chart. Background and recording Jung revealed his desire to work with Sunwoo shortly after releasing of his first solo album One Fine Day (2015). Collaborating only with men for the album, he expressed his desire to work with female musicians. He felt that the two could collaborate on a song in the tempo of allegretto. Initially, Sunwoo believed that Jung was just a \\"vocalist of an idol band\\". After listening to his album, she became aware of his abilities as a singer-songwriter. \\"Empathy\\" was conceived as a result of the inspiration Jung and Sunwoo invoked between each other. Prior to meeting her, he wrote incomplete lyrics to \\"Hello\\" with her in mind. Also conveying the sentiment of wanting to participate in a song with Jung, Sunwoo wrote incomplete lyrics for \\"Fireworks\\". Within a month, she was called upon to collaborate with Jung, in which she deemed as \\"fate\\". The two agreed on a \\"double collaboration\\". Jung and Sunwoo met in Hongdae, Seoul, at Sunwoo's record company MagicStrawberry Sound. They exchanged the lyrics they had written and proceeded in finalizing the songs. On writing \\"Hello\\", the two determined that it must be a \\"warm\\" track. Once agreeing on the theme and word choice for the song, the two first completed writing and recording the song. \\"Fireworks\\" was completed after Jung finished the composition and recording the bridge of the track on an electronic keyboard. He also provided guitar for both songs. Composition \\"Hello\\" is an acoustic ballad that \\"calmly portrays a moment in past love\\". The song was written by Jung and Sunwoo, and composed by the former. The song is set in the keys of G‚ÄìD using compound time with a tempo of 42 beats per minute. The lyrics showcase the separate experiences of two people which share no direction relation between each other. \\"Fireworks\\", a metaphor for \\"passion and beautiful love\\", is a dance- pop song. Release and promotion The release of \\"Empathy\\" was first announced on January 11, 2016. On the following day, a video teaser for the collaboration was released. This was followed by the release of the dual cover art for each song. Music video teasers for \\"Hello\\" and \\"Fireworks\\" were released on January 14, followed by the simultaneous release of the full videos the day after. Jung and Sunwoo were guests on KBS2's talk show You Hee- yeol's Sketchbook, where they performed the songs. Critical reception \\"Empathy\\" received generally favorable reviews from music critics. Writing for 10asia, Lee Eun-ho praised Sunwoo's vocal delivery in \\"Hello\\". He felt that she \\"compacts the entire emotion of the song and immerses the listeners\\", which is sustained by Jung's \\"solid melody\\". Lee expressed his desire for the song's peak to have a \\"less obscure flow\\", but settled that \\"it's definitely a melody that readily clings to your ears\\". Rating the songs three out of five stars, Kim Ban-ya of online magazine IZM felt that \\"Hello\\" did not \\"dramatically deviate\\" from a \\"typical\\" ballad, but commended Jung's \\"masterful and captivating\\" vocals in \\"Fireworks\\". Han Dong-yun of online music store Melon felt that Sunwoo's \\"wistful tone\\" and Jung's \\"lucid and straight\\" singing in \\"Fireworks\\" allowed them to \\"gently harmonize\\", which contributed to \\"appropriate levels of moisture and warmth to the song\\". Commercial performance From the chart dated January 10‚Äì16, 2016, \\"Hello\\" debuted at number 61 on the Gaon Digital Chart, selling 32,636 downloads in its first week. \\"Fireworks\\" charted at number 86 on the Gaon Download Chart, selling 16,283 downloads in its first week.

On the request of King Charles II, Guillaume de Ferri√®res was created cardinal-priest by Pope Celestine V at a Consistory held at L'Aquila on 18 September 1294; Guillaume was assigned the titular Church of San Clemente in Rome.Conradus Eubel, Hierarchia catholica medii aevi, I editio altera (Monasterii 1913), p. 12. He participated in the Conclave of 1294, following the resignation of Pope Celestine V on 13 December 1294. On 24 December, the cardinals elected Benedetto Caetani, Cardinal Priest of SS. Silvestro e Martino, who took the name Boniface VIII.John P. Adams, Sede Vacante December 1294. retrieved 02/14/2016. Cardinal Guillaume was appointed Legate of Boniface VIII on 30 June 1295, and sent to France to de-fuse a quarrel which was beginning between Philip IV of France, Charles II of Sicily, and Charles of Alen√ßon and Valois.Augustus Potthast, Regesta pontificum Romanorum II (Berlin 1875), 24118. He was then sent on to Spain to confirm the peace between Charles II of Sicily and King James II of Aragon, and to carry out the investiture for the Kingdom of Valencia and the Kingdom of Aragon. Useful details of the mission are provided by the Register of Guillaume de Mandagot, Archbishop of Embrun.Bourchenu, pp. 75-76. Mandagot had just been consecrated a bishop by Boniface VIII himself on Easter Day, 1295, and he headed north very soon thereafter. He was in Embrun in the third week of June, where he was received, installed, and offered homage. He then immediately held a synod. But he received a special order from the Pope to proceed to Catalonia, with Cardinal Guillaume de Ferrieres and King Charles II of Naples. He wound up his affairs and on 30 July set off to meet the party travelling north from Rome. The party proceeded to Catalonia, joined by the Archbishop of Arles, Rostagne de Capre.Albert, pp. 153-157. Eubel, p. 103. The party met with King James, and the negotiations were concluded. The agreement was later sealed by the marriage of King James II with the daughter of King Charles II, Blanche of Anjou, on 29 October or 1 November 1295, in the Catalan town of Vilabertran.Albert, p. 155. Business concluded, the party began its return journey. Cardinal Guillaume only got as far as Perpignan where he fell ill, and died on 7 September 1295. He was buried in the Franciscan church in that city.Lorenzo Cardella, Memorie storiche de' cardinali della Santa Romana chiesa II (Rome 1792), p. 44 Unaware as yet of his death, Pope Boniface wrote a letter to Cardinal Guillaume on 19 September, in which he remarks on Guillaume's illness and his frustration that the negotiations with King James of Aragon were being delayed.Gallia Christiana novissima p. 777 On 25 November 1295, the Treasury of the College of Cardinals paid out to the estate of Cardinal Guilelmus de Fornariis his share of a donation made by the Abbot of the Monastery of S. Giorgio in Venice. The estate did not, however, share in the distribution of money from the Rector of the Comtat Venaissin because Cardinal Guillaume had died before Michaelmas.Johann Peter Kirsch, Die Finanzverwaltung des Kardinalkollegiums im XIII. und XIV. Jahrhundert (M√ºnster 1895), pp. 97-98. The estate was still receiving distributions from money owed during Cardinal Guillaume's lifetime but not paid until well after his death; on 12 March 1296, he received money given by the Abbot of Cluny, and at Eastertide money given by the Archbishop of Tours.Johann Peter Kirsch, Die Finanzverwaltung des Kardinalkollegiums im XIII. und XIV.

History As part of the Leonese invasion, in June 1212, the first reference to the castle between Freixo de Espada √† Cinta and Urros. By 1236 it was occupied by Leonese forces with the consent of its inhabitants. Shortly after, King D. Sancho II donated the place to the municipality of Freixo \\"como sua aldeia\\" (with its village), ordering the expulsion of the residents who lived there during the Leonese occupation. At the time of the 1258 Inquiri√ß√µes (Inquiries) indicated that King Sancho had transferred the title to Freixo. During the reign of King D. Dinis, the municipality of Alva requested that King expand its settlement of 400 residents. But, by 1311, in a letter, the King refused the request, owing to opposition from the municipality of Freixo. Between 1527 and 1532, the village of Alva was not listed in the Numeramento, suggesting that the settlement no longer existed by the end of the 16th century. During the 17th century, Ant√≥nio Coelho Gasco, external judge and captain-major of the town of Freixo, described the state of abandonment that the structure, which he referred to as the \\"Antiquario\\" (antiquary), during a presentation on his visit to the Archbishop of Braga, D. Rodrigo da Cunha. By the end of the same century, Father Carvalho da Costa, referring to the limits of Poiares in the Corografia Portuguesa, included a small list of landmarks; this included the Hermitage of Nossa Senhora de Alva and \\"alongside it the ruined Castle with its walls, where in the past, was founded the Town of Alva\\", remembering that D. Sancho II had deprived the village of its residents. Continuing, that he: :\\"gave the village to Freixo and later, depopulated and ruined it, remaining only the boat, that navigated the river, with the name of Alva, and the referred Hermitage of Santa Maria, where is annexed a simple benefit of the Royal Patronage\\". Architecture The castle is situated in an area of abundant archaeological vestiges; the parish of Poiares is located between the Serra do Mar√£o and Serra de Av√µes, along the Couro and Douro Rivers in a rural area, situated on a hilltop dominating the Douro valley.

It originated as a bill written by Democratic Senator Darrell Steinberg and was enacted on November 10, 2009. The key purpose of the law is to encourage both urban and agricultural water providers to implement conservation strategies, monitor water usage, and report data to the Department of Water Resources (DWR). The law sets goals and deadlines regarding when the implementations must occur and, in an attempt to encourage participation, makes water suppliers ineligible for state water grants or loans unless certain terms have been met. Details =Formula for implementation= Hydrologic regions of California Water providers were first required to submit assessments of their baseline urban water use, which was measured in gallons per capita per day (GPCD), to the California Department of Water Resources (DWR). From this it was possible to calculate the reductions in use that would be required for each watershed, taking account of different factors such as population, hydrology and land use, in order to meet the required 20% reduction. All providers were then required to submit conservation plans to DWR by July 1, 2011 outlining exactly how the provider will ensure the conservation targets are met. To aide the suppliers the DWR formulated several water conversation methods/measurement criteria that suppliers could adopt, allowing them to choose the one that was best suited to their specific users. These included: * Setting a conservation target of 80 percent of their baseline daily per capita water use (i.e. a direct 20% reduction in all water use). * Differentiate between specific land uses (indoor, landscape, commercial and industrial) and set different performance standards. * Meet the per-capita water use goal for their specific hydrologic region as identified by DWR and other state agencies. * Use an alternate method that was developed by DWR before December 31, 2010. Agricultural Water providers are also bound by the legislation and will be required to: * Measure the volume of water delivered to customers * Adopt a pricing structure that is based on quantity delivered.

An important note is that the RISE program has been built upon heavy research. Thus, clinical strategies utilized in this program are backed by strong data from the literature.  Litigation  On May 16, 2017, Texas Democratic state Senator Carlos Uresti was indicted by a federal grand jury in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas for conspiracy to commit bribery and conspiracy to commit money laundering. Uersti is alleged to have originally taken money from Physicians Network Associates (PNA), which was awarded a contract for medical services at the GEO Group operated, Reeves County Detention Complex, near Pecos, Texas and that the scheme continued through PNA's successor company. The indictment claims acting Reeves County administrator, Judge Jimmy Galindo, conspired With Uresti to approve the medical contract through the county commissioners court in exchange for kickbacks and \\"promises of future payments.\\" PNA hired Uresti, ostensibly as a \\"consultant\\" for \\"marketing services\\" but the prosecution claims in fact Uresti became the middleman for bribe money destined for Galindo. PNA was subsequently absorbed by Correctional Healthcare Companies in 2010, which then merged with Correct Care Solutions, in 2014. PNA and its successor corporations continued to pay Uresti $10,000 monthly, starting in September 2006, for the next ten years. Uresti is alleged to have split those bribes with Galindo.Indictment Links State Sen.

It is classified by IGESPAR as a Site of Public Interest. Just north of the village, the castle was erected on a vegetation-heavy small hill called the Promenade de Mos, an ancient road axis in the region. There is also another Mos Castle in Mos, Vigo, Galicia. History =Ancient Times= Some evidence indicate that early human occupation of the region come from the Early Iron Age. =The medieval castle= Although there is little to no information on the founding or early history, the village secured a royal charter from Afonso I o Portugal (1112-1185) in 1162. Under the reign of Sancho II of Portugal (1248-1279), inquiries in 1258 reported that the county held a third of the tithes from the Church of Santa Maria de Mos for the repair and maintenance of the town's castle. The source of the funds was explained in a letter Alfonso IV of Portugal (1325-1357) states that the sovereign granted the \\"people of the Church are giving money\\". Near the end of the Middle Ages, fighting had depopulated the village and swung favor to the nearby village of Carvi√ßais. During the reign of Fernando, he ended the power of the village and transferred it to Moncorvo Tower. In the late seventeenth century, Father Carvalho da Costa recorded a similar position, stating that this villa one sees almost hum aruinado Castello delle with his cistern inside, which turns out to be the old village villa of more account. At this stage, the castle had only 90 fires, while in Carvi√ßais neighbor, the only place term 250 were counted. =Nineteeth Century to the Modern Day= In the nineteenth century, the Municipality of Mos was abolished and integrated in the municipality of Torre de Moncorvo. The castle remains are classified as Public Interest Property by decree published on 20 October 1955. In the 1960s part of the medieval wall collapsed, registering a particular construction on a walled section. At the time, it was felt the intervention of the government by the action of DGEMN, through the reconstruction of a section of the wall and work in the surrounding area (1963). Currently there remain only traces of some sections of wall with addorsed dwelling houses. Outside the walls stand out the Church of Santa Maria and the pillory. Characteristics The small castle has site design with oval format in the Romanesque style. The wall in shale rock girl is torn south through the door, communicating with the outskirts of the medieval village and the paths towards Freixo de Espada a Cinta, Alva, Moncorvo and Miranda Tower. Internally, the village is structured around the Straight Street, which defined a north-south axis. Extra walls were erected the Church of Santa Maria and on the opposite side, opposite to the castle gate, the square with the Town Hall and the pillory. The type of Mos village organization reveals a similar pattern to the Freixo de Espada a Cinta, and the Castle of Alva. Respect to Castle of Freixo de Espada a Cinta, roars and Alva, with which it has affinities, the Mos is the only one with the Church of Santa Maria located on the opposite side off developed opposite the main gate of the fence.

In construction grammar this pattern is considered a construction because the pattern is not predictable from any other fact of English grammar already established about 'the'. 'The normally occurs with a head noun but in this construction it requires a comparative phrase. The two major phrases resist classification as either noun phrases or clauses. The requirement that two phrases of this type be juxtaposed is another non- predictable aspect of the pattern.

The offensive On the morning of 11 February 2016, the Syrian Arab Army's 555th Brigade of the 4th Mechanized Division, along with the National Defense Forces (NDF), Liwaa Suqour Al-Sahra (Desert Hawks Brigade), Kataebat Al-Ba'ath (Al- Ba'ath Battalions), and Fouj Al-Joulan (Golani Regiment), launched an offensive eastward to recapture the Ithriyah-Raqqa Road that leads to the Tabqa Military Airport. They began their assault by storming Hill 5 along the Ithriyah-Raqqa Road, and after nearly 3 hours of fierce battle with ISIS, they were able to establish full control over three points in the eastern Hama desert: Hill 5, Tal Abu Zayn and a water well at the village of Tal Zakiyah. At this point, the Syrian Army was 45 kilometers from the Al-Tabqa air base. The next day, Syrian government forces advanced from Tal Abu Zayn, capturing Tal Madakhah hill. They had also reached Tal Zakiyah in the afternoon, thus entering the southern Raqqa countryside, and coming within 35 kilometers of the airbase. Meanwhile, west of Ithriyah, the military seized two villages along the Ithriya-Salamiyah Road, near Sheikh Hilal. On 13 February, government troops seized the Zakiyah crossroad, in southern Raqqa, while also further advancing in the Sheikh Hilal area. On 14 February, the Syrian Army seized Tal Masbah hill, 15 kilometers east of Ithriyah. ISIS fighters retreated towards the desert village of Jubb Al-Qutna. On 15 February, several hills around Zakiyah were also captured. On 17 February, the Army approached Marina, positioning themselves five kilometers west of the village, while fighting continued at Zakiyah. The next day, after an 8-hour battle that started in the early morning hours, government troops captured Tal Al-'Alam hill, four kilometers from Marina. Between 20 and 21 February, government forces captured two hills (\\"Point 4\\" and \\"Point 5\\"), near Zakiyah, and the village of Al-Massabah. On the evening of 21 February, ISIL launched two offensives with the aim of cutting the government's supply line that runs through Ithriyah. One of these was a large assault against the road running from Ithriyah towards Aleppo city, to the north, more specifically against the Khanasir-Aleppo Road. During this operation, ISIL cut the road for seven days and captured the strategic town of Khanasir, before the Army managed to retake all areas they had lost along the highway. The second attack was aimed at the Sheikh Hilal-Ithriyah Road, west of Ithriyah, which was also cut. By 28 February, all points lost were recaptured by the military in the Sheikh Hilal area, except the Al-'Azeeb Checkpoint. The simultaneous ISIL assault on the two roads had left Syrian Army units along the Salamiyah-Raqqa Highway trapped during this time. Later on the same day, the Syrian Army captured the last point on the Sheikh Hilal-Ithriya Road that was held by ISIL, thus reopening the supply route. On 3 March, the Syrian Army recaptured all points they had to abandon at the Zakiyah crossroad days earlier, due to the cutting of the supply route. Two days later, ISIL once again cut the Sheikh Hilal-Ithriyah Road, killing 15‚Äì20 soldiers, before the military repelled the attack and re- secured the road. Following this, the Syrian Army shifted their focus from the Al-Tabqa Military Airport to the Jirah Military Airport and Deir Hafir, further north in Aleppo Province. This came in the aftermath of the failed ISIL offensive at Khanasir, during which government forces captured 13 villages previously held by ISIL.  Aftermath  On 2 June, the military announced the start of a new offensive from Ithriyah, with the aim of liberating Raqqa city.

C. Christensen and starring Jasen Wade, Sarah Kent and Kimball Stinger. The film was based on the Cokeville Elementary School hostage crisis in 1986 and the book The Cokeville Miracle: When Angels Intervene by Hartt Wixom and Judene Wixom. The faith-based film was released in select theaters across the United States in the summer of 2015, and was distributed by Deseret Book Company and affiliated retailers. Plot In May 1986, cop Ron Hartley (Jasen Wade) is at a crime scene, during which two people were murdered. He is traumatized from the experience and begins to question the beliefs of his religion. In Tucson, Arizona, David Young (Nathan Stevens), former town marshal of Cokeville, Wyoming, tests a homemade bomb on an old bus, which succeeds. He then expresses his triumph with his second wife, Doris (Kymberly Mellen). In Cokeville, Ron is playing with his two children; Cindy (Alexa Rae) and Jason (Kimball Stinger). When the family's nightly prayer comes, Ron refuses to say it, as he is questioning his faith due to all the horrible things he's seen. His wife, Claudia (Sarah Kent), is worried for him. On a Sunday, Ron does not attend his church with his family. Meanwhile, David is travelling with Doris, buying groceries as materials. He has his two friends Gerald Deppe and Doyle Mendenhall (Channon Voyce and Paul Hunt) meet him in Cokeville. David and Doris demonstrate igniting gunpowder while it is in the air, making it seem as if the air is on fire. Deppe and Mendenhall take the plot as launching illegal fireworks. The next day, the five set out for Cokeville Elementary School, where David reveals their real plan is to take the school hostage and blow it up with his bomb, which will then lead to David being the leader of a \\"brave new world\\". Deppe and Mendenhall refuse to cooperate, and David handcuffs them in the back of his van. Ron, on the same day, travels to help his brother with some issues, while Cindy and Jason go to the school. During the past few days at the school, the fire alarms have been going off without any smoke or any other trigger, baffling the staff. David, Doris and Penny (Caitlin EJ Meyer), one of David's two daughters from his previous marriage, bring the bomb into the school, with Doris and Penny carrying firearms. Penny is reluctant to follow the plan. The three walk into the school undetected, and announce to their secretary, Christina Cook (Jillette Dayton), their plan. They take her hostage, and when David starts harshly yelling at a student, Penny confronts him. Instead of shooting her like he had earlier threatened, he gets his car keys and throws them at her, commanding her to leave, saying she is no daughter of his. After Penny leaves, David and Doris take three people (two staff, one student) into Room 4, where David takes control of a class being held in the room. Doris then manipulates the rest of the school to go into Room 4, telling them \\"a surprise\\" waits for them. Once all 136 students and 18 teachers are in the room, David establishes control by explaining his rules, then sitting next to the bomb; if he pulls the trigger, it will detonate. He shows off his firearms and explains he‚Äôll kill children with a .22 because they‚Äôre innocent, while his .45 is reserved for teachers. After a few minutes, Max Excell (Alan Peterson), the school principal who had been away, walks in and discovers the situation. David tells him to call the local authorities and tell them he demands $2,000,000 for each child, and if he doesn't return in 15 minutes, he will begin shooting students one by one. Penny speeds to the local police station where she informs them of her father's plan, proving it by showing them Deppe and Mendenhall, still handcuffed. The police take the three for questioning, while they start informing the families. Ron begins to return to Cokeville, when he is informed of the hostage situation. He is still far out, but starts to rush towards Cokeville, as he is the nearest officer and every other one is out of town. In the school, gas from the bomb begins to leak and children are getting sick. One of the teachers convinces David to let them open the doors and windows. After the principal returns, David demands him to call the White House. During the next few hours, the teachers create a \\"magic square\\" of masking tape on the floor where only David is allowed to go. The square serves as a boundary between the bomb and the children. Around this time, David is getting more and more agitated especially when Jason Hartley taunts him. When Jason puts his foot inside the magic square, David loses control and yells at Jason, who doesn‚Äôt flinch. Shortly after that, David leaves for the restroom, telling Doris to take his place at the bomb. While chatting with one of the teachers, Doris accidentally triggers the bomb by gesturing with her hand. It explodes and Doris is ignited in flames. The children are quickly evacuated as firefighters and paramedics are stationed right outside the doors and windows. David comes out of the bathroom to see Doris‚Äô body completely engulfed in flames; he shoots her to put her out of her misery. He also shoots a teacher, John Miller (Joshua Cooper), in the back as the man leaves the classroom to help children escape. Despite the fire from the blast, David shooting his gun, and his remaining ammo exploding in the heat of the fire, everyone but Doris still manages to evacuate safely. David returns to the bathroom where he kills himself, making him and Doris the only two to be killed during this event. Ron is informed of the bombing and he expresses that God isn't real. He arrives in town, rushing towards the school. A few days later, Jason and Cindy are recovering well from burns and other minor injuries. Jason, however, seems traumatized and Ron takes him to see a psychologist. After the doctor meets privately with Jason for a while, he simply tells Ron that, \\"You and Jason need to sit down and have a nice, long talk.\\" Ron and Claudia both talk to Jason, who then tells him \\"there were other people in the room.\\" He confides in them that he saw people dressed all in white ‚Äî angels. Ron doubts this but Claudia believes him after Jason points out a picture of his great-grandmother, who had passed away years earlier, saying she was his angel in the classroom. Ron questions this so Claudia convinces him to gather evidence just as he would for any other investigation. He visits multiple families who inform him of similar stories from their children. He visits the investigating certified bomb expert, Rich Haskell (Rick Macy), from Sherrif's office in Rock Springs, who tells him that three of the five wires in the bomb were mysteriously cut; not broken, but cut clean. Haskell also mentions that the open windows and doors provided ventilation for the explosion. He is baffled that the shrapnel David put in the explosive was thrown around the room but no one was injured by it. Ron later tells Claudia that he found out every one of the hostages prayed some time during the crisis, and that some ran back into the room to help others. Despite all this information, Ron is reluctant to believe it. On Sunday, Jason refuses to attend church unless his dad does so as well. Motivated to attend for Jason, Ron tries to make it through the meetings. But after the main meeting, Ron's doubts start to control him again and he tells Claudia that he can't do it. She tells him that he needs to control it or he could lose her and their children. Ron then overhears some words the bishop, John Teichart (Shawn Stevens), is saying in a class. He says that hatred will not be the answer but prayer will. Ron then goes to the youth room where they are singing \\"A Child's Prayer\\". He notices that almost all of the kids in the room have some injuries of some kind, and he becomes humble and asks God for forgiveness for doubting Him. Cindy and Jason notice him and run to him, and he asks for their forgiveness as well. That night, at the family prayer, Ron is saying it for the first time in a long time.

Background  The film was inspired by the activities of the group Pamyat, which emerged at the end of the 1970s and became widely known in the late 1980s as an ultra patriotic movement and a prominent champion of newly-revived Russian nationalism. The group organised protest rallies against what they called the \\"Ziono-Masonic plot\\" to weaken Russia and distributed pamphlets listing the names and addresses of people, mostly prominent writers and musicians, who were to be lynched as public enemies. One of these pamphlets came to the attention of Mamin, who showed it to his friend, writer Vyacheslav Leykin.  Synopsis  A small town in post-perestroika Russia is plagued by groups of ideologically minded young people. The Capella group preaches breaking taboos: open relationships, sex orgies, homosexuality, vandalism and punk music. They terrorise the town daily. To the older residents of the town Capella is the devil made flesh. The only ones fighting Capella are a group of violent bullies who call themselves \\"the Tusks\\". A student, Alexander, has come to town with a university friend to visit his aunt and uncle. The young men arrive dressed as early 19th century gentlemen in top hats and capes, both sporting sideburns and walking canes. They are the Pushkin club whose sacred aim is the salvation of Russia. Finding out that his young cousin has run away from home to join Capella, Alexander goes to find their haunt in an attempt to bring her to reason and return her to her family. Having failed in his errand and led on by Viktor, his mysterious friend and mentor, Alexander makes a new attempt to save the town and Russia. The young men arrive at the basement quarters of the Tusks to speak to the gang. Finding the men somewhat aggressive, the young followers of Pushkin display prodigious cane-fighting skills. Beaten into submission and overwhelmed by the intellect and excellent manners of the two Pushkinists, the Tusks recognise their new leaders. They must now grow sideburns and learn to fight with a cane... It seems nothing can stop the two young Pushkin fans from bringing morality, education and order back to the town. But the game will soon spiral out of control.

Place and date Jimmy Carter, 39th President of the United States, traveled to Iran in late December 1977. On New Year's Eve, in the Niavaran Complex, he made a speech during which he said, \\"Iran is an island of stability in one of the most troubled areas of the world.\\" Also, in this speech he called Mohammad Reza Pahlavi a popular king among Iranians. Consequences After this speech, Mohammad Reza felt encouraged to proceed to further suppression of his opponents. One week later, on Saturday, January 7, 1978, the article \\"Iran and Red and Black Colonization\\" was published in Ettela'at under a pseudonym, targeting Ayatollah Khomeini. Following the article's publication, several protests occurred in Mashhad, Qom, and Tehran. Also, Khomeini condemned Carter's speaking and declared the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, to be a tyrant and a traitor. Analysis of the support Ahmad Zeidabadi believes Carter was aware of the sporadic protests against Mohammad Reza in Iran and knew that Iranian society was unstable, so it seems he described Iran as an Island of Stability to strengthen Pahlavi and to reassure him of the U.S. government support for him. Sadegh Zibakalam says the speech was based on Carter's false impression of Iran's circumstances and believes Americans were unable to see the coming Iranian Revolution.

It is an unauthorised biography of the Leader of the British Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn. Background Jeremy Corbyn, the left-wing Member of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom for Islington North since 1983 announced his candidacy for the 2015 Labour Party leadership election. He struggled to obtain the required nominations from fellow MPs and was initially seen as a fringe candidate and an outsider. However, he was subsequently elected as leader in a landslide, with nearly 60% of the vote. The book was published by Biteback Publishing, a publisher jointly owned by Conservative Party activist and blogger Iain Dale and Conservative Party Member of the House of Lords Michael Ashcroft. It was authored by Rosa Prince, a journalist with the Conservative newspaper The Daily Telegraph. Synopsis Comrade Corbyn is a biography of the political career of Corbyn, including his unexpected and successful run for the Labour leadership. The book also examines his early life in rural Shropshire, his support for contentious causes such as Palestinian freedom and a peace process in Northern Ireland. Reception Critical reception was mixed. In The Guardian, Zoe Williams broadly criticised Comrade Corbyn. She suggested that much of the \\"revelations\\" were sourced from the Daily Mail. Williams was critical of the gossip and lack of serious political analysis, noting that instead a former \\"remote associate\\" was quoted claiming Corbyn's flat was \\"an absolute tip\\". Williams did praise the more objective analysis of Corbyn's support for causes in Northern Ireland and Palestine. Williams described some elements of the book as \\"meticulously uninterested, slightly spiteful analysis\\". In The Independent, Andy McSmith defended the book. He wrote that \\"with all due respect to Corbyn-loving acolytes ‚Äì this is not a hatchet job. It is an affectionate portrait of a man she (the author) obviously thinks has landed himself in the wrong job\\". Pointing to criticism of Prince's book from Corbyn's followers, McSmith said that \\"when the Corbyn era is over ... I doubt if its author will be accused of being 'spiteful'. I think the verdict will be that she was rather kind\\". Jeremy Corbyn told his local newspaper, the Islington Tribune that \\"I‚Äôve seen the book. It‚Äôs riddled with inaccuracies. I found 14 in the first eight pages I read. Dates, places, names, people, all things that could have been checked if the research had been done properly\\". He noted that \\"I think it generally lacks an analysis of the politics of Britain at the time. It‚Äôs a disappointing book. She had no approval from me, for the writing of it or approaching people to undertake interviews\\". Corbyn also suggested Prince had been impolite in the way she dealt with Corbyn and his family, stating \\"I‚Äôm pleased she notes my politeness. I wish she had shown the same politeness to me. She might care to adopt that characteristic herself\\".

It is one of the 31 Upanishads attached to the Atharvaveda, and is classified as one of the Vaishnava Upanishad. The text is in two parts, the early part called Rama purva tapaniya Upanishad and the later part called Rama uttara tapaniya Upanishad, which together with Ramarahasya Upanishad are Vaishnava Upanishads devoted to the Hindu god Rama. The text presents Rama as equivalent to the Atman (soul, self) and the Brahman (ultimate reality). The Upanishad is modeled after the Nrisimha Tapaniya Upanishad. It heavily borrows from the Vedic texts and the Principal Upanishads, praises the characters in the epic story of Rama, then presents Om, Rama yantra and Rama mantra. History Jaydipsinh Dodiya, writer and Dean, Faculty of Arts, Saurashtra University, dates the Rama-tapaniya Upanishad to 11th century CE. In contrast, the text has been dated to the 16th century by Catherine Ludvik ‚Äì a professor at the Stanford University and an author of books on Hindu deities. The Rama tapaniya Upanishad is composed in the style of the older pre-7th century Vaishnava text, the Nrisimha Tapaniya Upanishad. According to Farquhar, a colonial era Christian missionary and an Orientalist, \\"Ramaite sect\\" is not evidenced in the Valmiki Ramayana. Instead, according to Farquhar, it is the Rama purva tapaniya Upanishad where this sect is implied, and wherein Rama is the ultimate unchanging reality of Hindu philosophy called Brahman, as enunciated in the mantra of Rama Ramaya namah and a \\"mystic diagram\\". Farquhar adds that Rama uttara tapaniya portion of the Upanishad is based on texts borrowed from many older Upanishads and may be of later origin. According to Ramdas Lamb and other scholars such as Paul Deussen, the Rama tapaniya Upanishad, like other sectarian texts, has layers of material which were likely composed over time. It probably went through a process of writing where Brahmanical value system was added. Further, states Lamb, the text was modeled after the popular Nrisimha Tapaniya Upanishad, both in structure (Purva and Uttara sections), as well as the core message that deity Rama is identical to Atman and Brahman. In the Telugu language anthology of 108 Upanishads of the Muktika canon, narrated by Rama to Hanuman, it is listed by Paul Deussen ‚Äì a German Indologist and professor of Philosophy, at number 55 and in the compilation of Upanishads by Narayana ‚Äì an Indian scholar who lived sometime after the 14th-century CE, and republished in the modern era as the Bibliothica Indica edition at number 36. Contents The text of the Upanishad is presented in two sections ‚Äì Rama purva tapaniya Upanishad and Rama uttara tapaniya Upanishad. The Purva position of the Rama tapaniya Upanishad, says Ramdas Lamb ‚Äì a professor of Religion, the folk-etymology of the word Rama is presented. Rama, asserts the text, means \\"he who rules\\" (ra jate) over the kingdom of \\"earth\\" (ma-hi). He is also known as Rama, states the text, because the Yogins delight in him as ra-mante. In verses 7‚Äì10, the text states that Rama is manifest ultimate reality, that is Brahman. The Upanishad's major emphasis is on the Rama mantra Ram Ramaya namaha. Here, states Lamb, the beej mantra (seed) is asserted to contain the whole animate world, and all that exists is sourced in Rama and Sita. The Yogi who realizes the identity of Rama with Brahman and Atman (Soul) reaches liberation, states the Upanishad. The initial verses of the Rama purva tapaniya, says Lamb, extolls Rama and Sita with other major characters in the Ramkatha (the epic story of Rama). The Upanishad then defines the formula for erecting the Ram Yantra, the mystical mantra, with directions to inscribe beej mantra and other mantras. In the concluding section the text asserts that Rama worship leads one to the highest place and the attainment of liberation. The Uttara portion of the Rama tapaniya text, states Lamb, asserts that Shiva repeated the Rama mantra for thousands of ages, and Rama then gave him the boon whereby if Shiva would whisper the Rama taraka mantra in a dying man's ear, he would be liberated. The Uttara tapaniya discusses the Om mantra but without predominance over the Ramamantra. The Upanishad also prescribes mantras to worship goddess Sita, Rama's three siblings (Bharata, Lakshmana and Shatrughna), and also Hanuman. The Rama uttara tapaniya sections borrow from ancient Upanishads such as the Jabala Upanishad and the Mandukya Upanishad. The Om mantra, asserts the text in section 2 of Uttara, is identical to Brahman called satcitananda. In section 3, the text describes the four states of consciousness, asserting that the fourth and the highest inner state is one of \\"certitude of one own self, the calm, the one without a second, that which is the Atman which should be known\\" and which is same as Brahman and Rama. The one who realizes that \\"I am Atman\\", \\"I am Rama\\" and \\"I am Brahman\\" has realized the supreme light, the Ramabhadra, the bliss of liberation, states the Upanishad.

Founded by Eric Osman to release Modern Baseball's Sports, the label has been hailed as one of Philadelphia's best indie labels. History Lame-O Records was founded in 2012 by Eric Osman, manager of the band Modern Baseball, to release the band's debut LP Sports. Osman funded the 300-copy pressing with savings earned working at coffee shops. Though Sports earned the label no profit, it quickly sold out and has subsequently been repressed four times. The label was not originally supposed to continue beyond Sports, but Osman decided to take advantage of the opportunities afforded by the success of the first album. Lame-O began signing Philadelphia-area acts including Ma Jolie, Steady Hands, the Hundred Acre Woods, the Superweaks, and Three Man Cannon. Osman enlisted fellow Drexel University student Emily Hakes during the planning stages of The Hundred Acre Woods' Cold in the Morning 7\\" single, shortly before the label expanded beyond Philly in 2014, signing the London- based group Johnny Foreigner. The label earned acclaim in 2015 for their successful Strength in Weakness compilation. The six-way split (featuring Lame-O's Modern Baseball and The Superweaks as well as Spraynard, Marietta, Hurry, and Beach Slang) was sold to raise money for United Cerebral Palsy in honor of Modern Vinyl managing editor James Cassar.

The EP also served as Hakes' senior project for her music industry degree, while the accompanying shows at First Unitarian and Saint Vitus was Osman's for his entertainment & artist management degree.

Skarkos () is an early Bronze Age settlement on the island of Ios in Greece. Owing to its well preserved state, Skarkos is one of the most important prehistoric sites in the Aegean and especially the Cyclades.Eric H. Cline (ed.), The Oxford Handbook of the Bronze Age Aegean, , Jan. 2012.M. Marthari, Aspects of Potery Circulation in the Cyclades during the Early EB II Period: Fine and Semi-fine Imported Ceramic Wares at Skarkos, Ios, Horizon 71-84, 2008. Geography Ios, with one of the most sheltered natural harbours in the Cyclades, is located at the crossroads of Cycladic maritime routes. The settlement of Skarkos is situated on a hill in the middle of the west side of Ios, in proximity to the island‚Äôs most fertile plains and to its harbour. Excavations Skarkos was systematically excavated during the years 1984-1997. The excavations have been carried out in the north and east sides of the hill. They have brought to light an important early Cycladic settlement (mid-3rd millennium BC) in an exceptionally good state of preservation (two-storey buildings, four-metre-high walls), and an overlying late middle/early late Bronze Age cemetery (mid-2nd millennium BC). The settlement covers an area of 1.1 hectares and is the largest and best preserved site of the Keros-Syros culture, estimated to have been home to between 200 and 300 people.ŒúŒ±œÅŒØŒ∂Œ± ŒúŒ±œÅŒ∏Œ¨œÅŒ∑, Œ£Œ∫Œ¨œÅŒ∫ŒøœÇ ŒäŒøœÖ, Hellenic Ministry of Culture. Architecture Skarkos map. Skarkos is built on terraces that follow the natural relief of the hill. Its rectangular, stone-built residential buildings consist of a ground floor, a first floor and an enclosed courtyard. Their varying sizes reveal a social differentiation in the community. Streets between one and two meters wide and public spaces were uncovered. Walls are preserved to a height of three to four meters. The urban planning system of Skarkos is comparable to that of Poliochne on Lemnos from the beginning of the 3rd millennium BC. Archaeological evidence suggests that the ground floor was used for food preparation whereas the first floor served as living room, storage area for pottery and other goods and occasionally as workshop. Findings Excavations have unearthed several small artifacts such as marble figurines, obsidian ware, seals, ceramics, marble and stone vessels, tools, animal bones and seashells. Numerous pithoi from 1 to 1.30 in height were used for the storage of agricultural goods. Smaller amphorae were used to transport liquids. Clay seals on pottery indicate the control of agricultural production and the organization of the distribution of goods. Several of these findings are now on display at the archaeological museum in Chora. Conservation The site of Skarkos became publicly accessible after extensive conservation works between 2002 ‚Äì 2007. The project was awarded the 2008 EU Prize for Cultural Heritage / Europa Nostra Top Prize for Conservation, for the outstanding quality of conservation work and above all the minimal and extremely sensitive character of the interventions, having no detrimental impact on a unique landscape.

The statewide results were: Algebra 1 38% on grade level, Biology 35% on grade level and English Lit - 49% on grade level. Individual student, school or district reports were not made public, although they were reported to district officials by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Students identified as having special needs and qualifying for an Individual Educational Program (IEP) may graduate by meeting the requirements of their IEP. In 2017, the Pennsylvania General Assembly passed House Bill 202, which makes modifications of the Keystone Exam mandates for students who attend VoTech and Career Tech schools. These pupils will be allowed to use alternate assessments or industry-based certifications. Northern Tioga School District does not offer vocational technical education to its pupils.

The exams were administered in the Spring of each school year. The goal was for 100% of students to be on grade level or better in reading and mathematics, by the Spring of 2014. The tests focused on the state's Academic Standards for reading, writing, mathematics and science. The Science exam included content in science, technology, ecology and the environmental studies. The mathematics exam included: algebra I, algebra II, geometry and trigonometry. The standards were first published in 1998 and are mandated by the Pennsylvania State Board of Education. In 2013, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania changed its high school assessments to the Keystone Exams in Algebra 1, Reading/literature and Biology1. The exams are given at the end of the applicable course, rather than all in the spring of the student's 11th grade year. ;11th Grade Reading: *2012 - 53% on grade level, (19% below basic).

It is an erect shrub with broad, grey leaves and cream- coloured or pink flowers with red or purple spots on the outside. Description Eremophila macmillaniana is a shrub or small tree growing to a height of up to . The leaves and branches are covered with a layer of matted grey hairs that gradually become saturated with resin and are then difficult to see. The leaves are arranged alternately along the branches and are clustered near the ends of them. They are oblong to lance-shaped, tapering towards the ends and are mostly long, wide and often rough or wrinkled. The flowers are borne singly in leaf axils on a grey, hairy stalk which is long. There are 5 overlapping, pale reddish-purple, lance-shaped sepals which are long. The petals are long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is pink or cream-coloured with red to purple spots on the outside. The inside and outside surfaces of the tube and petal lobes are mostly glabrous, except that the middle of the lower lobe and the inside of the petal tube are covered with hairs. The 4 stamens extend slightly beyond the end of the petal tube. Flowering occurs from June to September and the fruits which follow are dry, woody, oval-shaped with a tapering end and are long. Taxonomy and naming Eremophila macmillaniana was first formally described in 1864 by Charles Gardner in Journal of the Royal Society of Western Australia. The specific epithet (macmillaniana) honours Sir Robert Furse McMillan, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Western Australia from 1913 to 1931. Distribution and habitat Grey turpentine bush is widespread and common in the area between Meekatharra, Yalgoo and the Kennedy Range in the Carnarvon, Gascoyne and Murchison biogeographic regions. It grows in sandy or rocky soil on stony plains and hills. Conservation status Eremophila macmillaniana is classified as \\"not threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

Oxford Journal of Archaeology 24(4):339-361, p.352 This trade network went through the whole of Anatolia, as well as Thrace, and towards the Mesopotamia. Kastri was a small town surrounded by a fortification system with horseshoe-shaped bastions, quite similar to the much bigger fortifications of the same time period at Liman Tepe, on Turkey's western coast near Izmir. Kastri has produced many metal artefacts, so it was probably associated with their production and distribution.Vasif Sahoglu (2005), THE ANATOLIAN TRADE NETWORK AND THE IZMIR REGION DURING THE EARLY BRONZE AGE. Oxford Journal of Archaeology 24(4):339-361, p.352 The pottery assemblage from Kastri is also very similar to that of Anatolia. The depas vessels, the bell-shaped cups, and incised pyxides \\"are entirely Anatolian in character'. The tin bronzes are also quite similar.Vasif Sahoglu (2005), THE ANATOLIAN TRADE NETWORK AND THE IZMIR REGION DURING THE EARLY BRONZE AGE.

It is situated on the waterfront on Mariane Thomsens Gade and was finished in 2013 after three years of development. The building was designed by four architectural firms, the Danish CEBRA and JDS Architects, French Louis Paillard and Dutch SeARCH, and was funded by the Danish pension fund PensionDanmark. Isbjerget was the first project to be completed on the former industrial port area, which is being developed into a new residential and commercial neighborhood after the Port of Aarhus was moved to new facilities to the south of the city center. The building complex consists of four buildings with 208 apartments between and both rented and owned. The apartments are either in two stories, double in height or with shifted floor plans, catering to different needs. The buildings are up to ten floors tall but vary in height, with the shortest building closest to the waterfront and the tallest further back. The complex is designed and modeled after floating icebergs in the north Atlantic, both in shape and color. The buildings are divided and crisscrossed into smaller units with steep crooked roofs, to ensure that all inhabitants have ideal views of the sea. Visually, the buildings display sharp triangular edges and shifting, irregular facades. The buildings are clad in white terrazzo and have balconies made of blue glass.  Awards  * In 2013, Isbjerget was awarded the Best Residential Development award at the French architects conference MIPIM. * In 2015 it was given the Best Housing award by the ArchDaily website, which caters to architects and designers.

Classical music and the arrival in Poland  He is a graduate of the prestigious Tchaikovsky Music Conservatory in Kiev in violin class of prominent professor A. I. Bazhenov. Although he began doctoral studies in Kiev in the early 90s, he decided to go to Poland. On the invitation of the then director of the Czƒôstochowa Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra, Jerzy Kosek, he takes a position as violinist and he's rather quickly promoted to first violins of the orchestra. Associated with Czestochowa professionally and privately he finds in Poland his second homeland.  Fascination with jazz and the inception of Siergei Wowkotrub Trio  Simultaneously with a symphony career Siergiei Wowkotrub effectively develops his passion for syncopated music. His fascination with traditional jazz started already in the conservatory. He listened to Leonid Utiosow then discovered Stephane Grappelli and the whole universe of violin gypsy swing. As a jazzman he developed his skills at Maciej Strzelczyk and Wojtek Kaminski then at Tim Kliphuis. Siergiei founds in Czƒôstochowa his first band named Siergiej Wowkotrub Trio. Three musicians (besides Siergiej Andrzej Nowicki and Daniel Pomorski) played actively and in 2007 recorded their first CD ‚ÄûHappy Times‚Äù with swing music from the twenties and thirties of the twentieth century. In his interpretations of standards and his own compositions Siergiei Wowkotrub tries to combine natural beauty, similar to the human voice, the pure sound of the violin with a unique atmosphere of the Golden Age of Swing. The twenties and thirties of the twentieth century are the constant references of his music fascination as well as the performance technique.  Period of Siergei Wowkotrub Gypsy Swing Quartet  In 2011 starts its activity Siergiej Wowkotrub Gypsy Swing Quartet (SWGSQ). With guitarists Sebastian Ruci≈Ñski, Tomasz W√≥jcik and contrabassist Piotr G√≥rka, young and extremely talented graduates of the Department of Jazz and Popular Music at the Music Academy in Katowice, Siergiej Wowkotrub creates another record. ‚ÄúJoseph, Joseph‚Äù is an example of virtuoso interpretations of the swing standards. The CD material is dominated by the mood of Stephane Grappelli and Django Reinhardt, there are echoes of the Gypsy camp and in solo performances of the leader is heard eastslavic tune and the discipline of academic education.  Concerts, cooperation, solo recordings  Siergiej Wowkotrub as a classical and jazz virtuoso violinist shows himself on the biggest festivals of gypsy swing in all Europe. In 2001-2015 he gave concerts in: Poland, Germany, France, Belgium, Slovakia and Hungary. = Guest participation in CD recordings = * \\"Bix & Henryk\\" (2006) * \\"New Orleans Suite\\" (2007) * \\"Jubilee\\"  Five O'Clock Orchestra (2015) = Collaborations = * \\"Jazz Band Ball Orchestra\\" (Cracow) * \\"Swing Workshop of Wojtek Kami≈Ñski\\" (Warsaw) * \\"Five O'Clock Orchestra\\" (Czestochowa) * \\"Hot D'Jazz Trio\\" (Cracow) * Joscho Stephan (M√∂nchengladbach) * ‚Äì Lora Szafran (Warsaw) * Tim Kliphuis (Hilversum) * Vano Bamberger (Frankfurt) = As a leader he has recorded CDs = * Siergiej Wowkotrub Trio \\"Happy Times\\" (2007) * SWGSQ \\"Joseph, Joseph\\" (2013)  Achievements and awards  * first place in a competition \\"Debut in Traditional Jazz\\" organized by the Foundation Debut as an Author and the Ministry of Culture, Warsaw 10.11.2005 * ‚ÄúGolden Washboard\\" main prize at the traditional jazz competition Old Jazz Meeting, I≈Çawa 11-13.08.2006 * The Bronze Medal for Long Service awarded by the President of Poland, Warsaw 30.08.2010 * Honorary Badge for Service to Polish Culture by Polish Minister of Culture and Heritage, Warsaw 24.09.2014  References  Category:Jazz violinists Category:Ukrainian classical musicians Category:Ukrainian classical violinists ","title":"Siergiej Wowkotrub"},{"id":"49414190","title":"G√ºliz Ayla"},{"id":"49414215","text":"Violeta Ivanov (; born 15 September 1967 in GrinƒÉu»õi-Moldova) is a Moldovan politician who currently serves as Member of the Parliament of Moldova (since 2009).

It is situated between the 2,692 m high Ilmspitze to the southwest and the 2,528 m high Hammerspitze to the northeast.  Ascent  The Kirchdach may be ascended from the west from the alpine pasture of the Pinnisalm (1,560 m) in the Pinnis valley along the Jubil√§umssteig path in ca. 4 hours. From the Issenangeralm (1,366 m), also in the Pinnis valley, the Rohrauersteig path takes ca. 4 hours to the top approaching the summit from the north. From the Gschnitztal valley the Padasterjochhaus (2,232 m) northeast of the Kirchdach acts as a base; from there it takes 2 hours to reach the top. All the routes run from the saddle of Silbersattel (2,750 m) along the north ar√™te, which is exposed in places and secured, for the final 90 metres in height to the summit.  Climbing  A number of climbing routes have been opened up the wild north and northeast faces, all of which have rarely been repeated.

Rafael was of Afro-Cuban descent and was one of the earliest successful black entertainers in modern France. He was the first black clown to play a lead role in a circus pantomime act, and with his longtime partner George Foottit they revolutionized the art of clowning by pairing the sophisticated white clown with the foolish auguste clown. Early life Rafael Padilla was born in Cuba sometime between 1865 and 1869. He was likely born a slave, which would explain why his birth was not registered. If so, he was probably born before September 17, 1869, because in 1870 the Spanish government emancipated all slaves born from that date onwards (see the Moret Law). He was born without a surname; \\"Padilla\\" was but one of several he would adopt later in life. Rafael had no memory of his biological parents.: \\"Ses parents? il ne les a jamais connus; il ne conna√Æt m√™me pas son √¢ge exact.\\" (\\"His parents? He never knew them. He didn't even know his exact age.\\") He was raised by a poor black woman in the slums of Havana. When Rafael was still a boy, she sold him to a Spanish businessman named Patricio Casta√±o Capetillo notes that a previous biographer, Franc- Nohain, erroneously identified Rafael's buyer as a Portuguese named \\"Castanio\\" from the village of \\"Castrosupuelta\\", which has to be an error because \\"Castanio\\" is not a Portuguese name and \\"Castrosopuelta\\" never existed. Noiriel did, however, find records of a wealthy Spanish family named Casta√±o from the village of Sopuerta. for 18 ounces of gold.: \\"Elle finit pourtant par l'appr√©cier, au prix de dix-huit onces, sur lequel on tomba d'accord.\\" (\\"She wound up appraising him at a price of 18 ounces, which they agreed upon.\\"): \\"...elle s'√©tait empress√©e de le vendre pour quelques pi√®ces d‚Äôor.\\" (\\"...she eagerly sold him for a few gold coins.\\") Casta√±o brought Rafael to his family's household in the village of Sopuerta in northern Spain. Cuba had banned the slave trade in 1862, and under international law Rafael technically ceased to be a slave at all the moment he set foot on European soil, but nonetheless the Casta√±os treated him like one. The Casta√±os, like many Spaniards with colonial connections, were anti-abolitionists and flouted the law by declaring Rafael a \\"servant\\". Rafael was the only black person in the village, and was mistreated both by the Casta√±os and the villagers. They made him sleep in the stables, and gave him no education. At around the age of 14 or 15, Rafael fled the Casta√±os. He worked in the quarries of the Basque Country, then moved to Bilbao where he worked odd jobs, such as dockworker, then as a porter at the train station. In Bilbao he met Tony Grice, a travelling English clown, who hired him as an assistant and domestic servant. Grice would occasionally incorporate Rafael into his acts, such as in his parodies of American minstrel shows, but didn't make Rafael an apprentice. Rafael did not enjoy this life: on several occasions he deserted Grice, then returned when he could not find employment elsewhere. Debut The famous Auguste Tony Grice discovered Rafael working the docks of Bilbao, impressed by both his physical strength and his dancing. He hired him as his manservant and handyman and then made him his partner in some of his numbers, in which Rafael would act as a stuntman. The new duo would go on to public notoriety when they began performing with the New Circus of Joseph Oller in Paris during October 1886. Rafael's stage name of Chocolat was given to him at this time by Grice. In 1888, their partnership was ended when Henri Agoust, the manager of the New Circus, hired Chocolat as the star of a nautical pantomime. He saw Chocolat as an potential star dancer and mime, and was proven correct when his first show, \\"The Wedding of Chocolat\\" was a huge success. The show grew over the next five years, including teaming up with the clowns Pierantoni, Kestern and Geronimo Medrano. During this period he met the love of his life, Marie Hecquet; she was married with two children, but divorced her husband in 1895 to start a new life with Rafael. He raised her children Eugene and Suzanne as their own and the family became circus performers. Foottit and Chocolat The duo of Footit and Chocolat performing in the skit \\"Spider\\". A colour illustration by Ren√© Vincent, c. 1900. In 1895, Raoul Donval, director of the New Circus, formed a new duo, teaming Chocolat with a British clown, George Foottit. The two performed together for twenty years, popularizing clown comedy, especially with the burlesque sketch William Tell. This comedy relied heavily on \\"comedic slaps\\", making Chocolat a character consistent with the imagery and prejudices of that time; a character that gradually becomes the stereotype of the Negro scapegoat: silly, childish and friendly. Chocolat, however, fought the stereotype by constantly diversifying his skills and careful observation of the skits shows a character not confined to the roles of the subject. The phrase \\"je suis Chocolat\\", meaning \\"I am deceived\\", was popularized by the dialogues in their sketches, introduced by the duo in 1901.¬´ L'amer destin du clown Chocolat ¬ª, L'Express, Boris Thiolay, 6 juillet 2009. In 1905, their New Circus contract was not renewed. Some blamed the Dreyfus affair and politicization of racial issues. There were also questions at the time of black and Mestizo politicians representing the old colonies of the French empire. Their joint career reached its peak with the Folies Berg√®re until they were considered old fashioned with the arrival of a generation of American black artists bringing the cake walk to the stages of Europe.¬´ Le clown noir enterr√© √† Bordeaux ¬ª, Sud Ouest, 5 juillet 2010. In 1909, they returned to the New Circus with Chocolat, aviateur d'Henry Moreau. The first performance on October 30 was well received by the public. On November 19, in an article by writer and journalist Pierre Mille, the Times erroneously announced the death of Chocolat. The next day, the Times retracted the error and published a letter from Rafael, curiously dated November 17: > Sir, The director read in your newspaper that Mr. Mille, the intelligent > journalist wrote that I am dead like Augustus. > I pray you, say that I am alive, and that I am playing every night in > Chocolat aviateur at the New Circus. > You can judge that I did not even turn white. > Please accept my respect, > Chocolat > Please correct it, because it hurts me. Foottit and Chocolat split up in 1910, when Andre Antoine, director of the Odeon, hired Foottit to play the role of the Clown in Romeo and Juliet. They announced their separation on stage: > Foottit: \\"I go to play Romeo at the Odeon!\\" > Chocolat: \\"So? I'm playing Othello at the Com√©die-Fran√ßaise!\\" See also *Chocolat (2016 film) References =Bibliography= Category:1860s births Category:1917 deaths Category:19th-century Cuban people Category:Cuban slaves Category:French clowns ","title":"Chocolat (clown)"},{"id":"49414546","text":"Athrypsiastis phaeoleuca is a moth in the family Xyloryctidae.

Career Cardwell is probably best known for his debut as George Sullivan in 1944's Oscar-nominated The Fighting Sullivans, based on the true story of five navy brothers who died in action together when their ship was torpedoed in the Pacific Theater during World War II. His other significant roles included the Benny Goodman musical Sweet and Low-Down (1944), the World War II drama A Walk in the Sun (1945), and the police drama He Walked by Night (1948). Reviewing the 1945 Charlie Chan mystery The Shanghai Cobra, the Kentucky New Era remarked that \\"James Cardwell, a newcomer to the screen, shows himself to be a fine actor as the romantic lead opposite beautiful Joan Barclay.\\" However, he found himself consigned to B-movies; 1949's Daughter of the Jungle, in which Cardwell played the male lead opposite Lois Hall, earned the dubious distinction of a listing in the 1978 book The Fifty Worst Films of All Time. In 1950, Cardwell toured Australia with comedian Joe E. Brown in a production of the play Harvey. He then joined the Colleano Troupe, a variety act, with whom he toured Australia, the UK, and the U.S. After returning to the U.S., he made two guest appearances in the Rod Cameron television series City Detective. However, his movie career had stalled. He made only one additional appearance before his death: a small unbilled role in the 1954 monster film Them! Personal life Cardwell was born Albert Paine Cardwell in Camden, New Jersey, the son of Raymond Cardwell and Bessie McCarroll. He graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School in 1940. In 1942, he married Esther Borton. They divorced two years later. In 1951, he became engaged to Australian model June Crocker, but she ended their relationship after she suffered serious burns in a stage accident. According to author Jeffery P. Dennis, Cardwell subsequently \\"came out\\" as gay. Death Apparently disheartened by his faltering career and financial difficulties, Cardwell fatally shot himself at the age of 32 in Los Angeles, California on January 31, 1954.

Martinengo devoted her life as a professed religious to the performance of small but humble chores in her time as a Poor Clare nun and was noted for her life of spiritual discernment and devotion to God above all else. Pope Leo XIII beatified Martinengo on 3 June 1900. Life Margherita Martinengo was born on 5 October 1687 in Brescia into a noble household in the Martinengo Ducal Palace to Francesco Leopoldo Martinengo and Margherita Secchi d'Aragona; her brothers were Nestore and Gianfrancesco. Her paternal uncle was Giambattista. Her mother died five months after her birth in 1688. She was baptized straight after her birth since there was fear that she might die. The baptism ceremonies for her were celebrated on 21 August 1691 at the baptism of her half-sister Cecilia born to the second marriage of her father to Elena Palazzi. As a child she was perceived to be an intelligent girl and received a structured and comprehensive education based on the civic and religious studies. At the age of six she was entrusted to the Ursulines for additional education. Her teacher Isabella Marazzi instructed her in proper devotional practices to God and Marazzi was a formative role in Martinengo's religious education. Martinengo was an avid reader and made full use of the Latin literature that her father owned. On one occasion during her childhood she was in a carriage that six horses ran and she fell out. She would have been crushed and run over from other carriages had there not been what she described as an invisible touch that seemed to save her life. On 11 October 1689 she entered the convent boarding school of the Augustinian nuns of Santa Maria degli Angeli - two nuns there were her maternal aunts and she continued her education there. She had her First Communion towards the end of her childhood in which ‚Äì in the heat and emotion of the moment ‚Äì she dropped the Host which forced her to pick it up from the floor with her tongue. In August 1699 she asked her father for permission to go the Spirito Santo boarding school of the Benedictines. Before she could go there she had a vacation with her father and siblings for a few months in the mountains around Lago d'Iseo where she realized what her true religious calling was. Sometime around this point at the age of thirteen she took a vow to God in which she promised to remain a virgin. But at the age of sixteen several suitors approached her and her father had even promised her to the son of a prominent Venetian senator. It even grew to the point where her two brothers Nestore and Gianfrancesco prompted her to accept one of the offers. Her suitors bought her books and love stories and she did in fact like them ‚Äì but she brooded over the fact that such stories given to her were \\"books from Hell\\". Martinengo returned from the Spirito Santo convent after the conclusion of her studies in 1704 and announced to her father and brothers her intention of becoming a Capuchin Poor Clare nun on 21 December 1704. Her confessor and house servants as well as her father and siblings opposed this move when she made it public. Despite this on Christmas 1704 she went to the Capuchin Poor Clare convent of Santa Maria della Neve and presented herself to them with the words: \\"I want to become holy\\". However she was required to undergo a period of probation which was conducted in the Ursuline-run Maggi College. Once she entered the convent at the age of eighteen she was described to be \\"like wax\\" for her delicate appearance. On 8 September 1705 she was clothed in the habit and assumed the religious name of \\"Maria Maddalena\\" and parted with her father and brothers and of the event said: \\"O God! How upset I was\\". Martinengo was later deemed to be unfit for the Capuchin life but with a change in mistress she received unanimous support in a later ballot. She made her solemn profession on 8 September 1706. In 1708 a Jesuit priest gave a series of spiritual exercises that were Jansenistic in nature. She feared divine judgment so much that she contracted a grave fever that left her confined to her bed for a brief period of time. Her confessor instructed her to compile notes of her life and experiences and she decided to do so in the spirit of obedience. She was appointed as the Mistress of Novices at the age of 36 and made abbess in 1732; she was re-elected in that post on 12 July 1736. Martinengo died of tuberculosis in 1737 and when news of her death spread across Brescia people across the entire area mourned her. Her remains are located in the church of the convent of the Capuchin Poor Clare nuns in Via Arimanno 17 in Brescia. Beatification The process for her beatification commenced under Pope Clement XIII on 1 September 1762 and allowed for the commencement of two diocesan processes to be held in the Diocese of Brescia for the evaluation of her time as a professed religious and to investigate the manner in which she conducted her life. On 5 May 1778 she was proclaimed to be Venerable after Pope Pius VI recognized the fact that Martinengo had lived a model life of heroic virtue which he deemed she had exemplified to a favorable degree. The recognition of two miracles attributed to her direct intercession allowed for Pope Leo XIII to preside over her beatification on 3 June 1900. The miracles in question concerned the healings of Isabella Groppelli Gromi and of the future priest Giuseppe Tosi.

Minute Maid quick frozen concentrated orange juice was promoted on the shows. Background Frozen orange juice was developed by necessity for troops during the war by National Research Corporation. In the late 1940s, Vacuum Foods Corporation, who were marketing the Minute Maid brand, wanted to educate the public and stimulate sales. An original investor in Vacuum Foods was Jock Whitney, a wealthy sportsman who had met Bing Crosby in horse racing circles. During a round of golf in spring 1948, Whitney told Crosby about the frozen orange juice concentrate and a deal was made.Crosby became a director of Vacuum Foods, and he bought 20,000 shares of stock at the advantageous price of 10 cents a share. He agreed, at an undisclosed salary, to plug the juice on a transcribed song and chat program five days a week and Philco Corporation, which had Crosby under exclusive contract, agreed on the basis that the singer would slip in mentions of Philco products during the shows. This arrangement enabled Vacuum Foods to obtain Crosby's services at a reasonable cost and for Crosby it offered the chance of a substantial long-term capital gain on the shares. The program The first show was broadcast on November 22, 1948, initially in the 9:45‚Äì10:00 a.m. slot, and a number of different stations took the show with a variety of sponsors as well as Vacuum Foods. Between records, which were mostly Crosby recordings, the singer and Ken Carpenter talked of frozen orange juice, as an acceptable alternate, and Minute Maid became a household word with sales in excess of $100 million within a few years. Crosby's financial adviser, Basil Grillo, set up Bing Crosby Entertainment as producer and had Crosby work for union scale, again a matter of taxation. Writer Norman Wolfe opined, ‚ÄúThe program for Minute Maid occasioned some amusement in the press because of his long standing feud with disk jockeys over saturating the airwaves with his music. Suddenly he was one of them, playing three or four of his own records, in a 15‚Äìminute format, each morning Monday through Friday.‚Äù Variety magazine did not normally review disc-jockey programs but on this occasion, because of Crosby's involvement, they commented: ‚ÄúThe opening program on Monday (22nd) had Crosby singing a new song and playing one of his old disks and to show his generosity, as well as good showmanship, playing an Ella Fitzgerald recording too. Crosby also did his own commercials, valiantly plugging frozen orange juice and doing a better job of it than announcer, Ken Carpenter. Met soprano, Dorothy Kirsten, wandered into the program to exchange a couple of words with Bing but didn‚Äôt sing anything, making the whole bit a bit silly. Otherwise, this is a pleasant ayemer.\\" A few months later, Billboard magazine looked at the program too. \\"Whether Bing Crosby is as good a salesman as he is a performer may well be determined via his new platter disk jockey show for Minute Maid quick frozen orange juice, for in addition to doing the deejay assignment, Ole Wart-Larynx is also rendering a mighty pitch for Minute Maid. They‚Äôre done in his customary off- the-sleeve style of verbiage, directly at the hausfrauen calculated to be listening to his daytime effort. In one sense, this may be almost mandatory, since the program needs every angle possible to differentiate it from the Crosby-less Crosby platter sessions aired by so many stations. Irrespective of the sales palaver, tho, the Crosby introductions to the records, the tunes chosen (he doesn‚Äôt limit them to his own) and the inimitable Groaner style should emerge as a potent daytime session. Ken Carpenter is on hand with his usual nifty assist and the two combine to do an easy-to-take selling job on the juice as its edge over the competish.\\" Crosby taped the shows well in advance with help from engineer Jack Mullin and writer Bill Morrow. When he went to Europe in 1950, he described some of the places he visited, leading to columnist John Crosby to comment: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how many of you have been catching ‚ÄúThis Is Bing Crosby‚Äù, a 15-minute transcribed daytime show, dedicated to the proposition that every man, woman and child ought to drink more Minute Maid Orange Juice. Anyhow, Mr. Crosby has been devoting much of the quarter-hour to a recital of his adventures in Europe with wit, charm and a surprising perceptiveness. If you can't fit Europe into your schedule this summer, the Crosby travel diary is about the best vicarious trip around.‚Äù The last show was broadcast on October 27, 1950. Related matters The Minute Maid Corporation was the first new stock to be floated on the New York Stock Exchange in 1956 and Crosby bought the first 100 shares for a total of $1,900 and then donated them to his alma mater Gonzaga University for its library appeal. He was described in press publicity as president of the Bing Crosby‚ÄìMinute Maid Corporation which acts as distributor of Minute Maid products on the West Coast. Starting in 1967, Crosby began to act as a product spokesman for Minute Maid and he and his family were seen in many televised commercials in subsequent years.

It has smooth bark, dull, light green, egg-shaped to broadly lance-shaped leaves, flower buds arranged singly in leaf axils, pink flowers and relatively large, flattened hemispherical fruit. Description Eucalyptus impensa is a straggly mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth grey and brownish bark. Young plants and coppice regrowth have leaves arranged more or less in opposite pairs, broadly egg-shaped, long and wide. Adult leaves are also arranged more or less in opposite pairs, broadly lance-shaped to egg-shaped, long and wide on a thick petiole up to long. The flower buds are arranged singly in leaf axils on a thick peduncle long. The mature bud is oval to more or less spherical, long and wide with a beaked operculum about long. Flowering has been recorded in May, June and July and the flowers are pink. The fruit is a woody, flattened hemispherical capsule, long and wide with the valves protruding above the rim. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus impensa was first formally described in 1993 by Ian Brooker and Stephen Hopper from a specimen collected from near Warradarge in 1987. The description was published in the journal Nuytsia. The specific epithet is from the Latin impensus, meaning 'ample', 'great', 'large' or 'strong', referring to the leaves and fruit of this species. Distribution and habitat The Eneabba mallee is restricted to six populations that occur over a range of about near Eneabba. It grows in open shrub mallee over low heath on undulating plains and breakaways. Conservation status This mallee is listed as \\"Endangered\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and as \\"Threatened Flora (Declared Rare Flora ‚Äî Extant)\\" by the Department of Environment and Conservation (Western Australia). An \\"interim recovery plan\\" has been prepared. In 2009, eight populations of this mallee were known and counts suggested that the total number of mature plants was about 114. The main threats to the species are insect damage, inappropriate fire regimes, firebreak maintenance and disease. The species as a whole is threatened by its narrow range and lack of recruitment.

It is sometimes said that the term \\"Merikins\\" derived from the local patois, but as many Americans have long been in the habit of dropping the initial \\"A\\" it seems more likely that the new settlers brought that pronunciation with them from the United States. Some of the Company villages and land grants established back then still exist in Trinidad today.

During the War of 1812, there was a policy that was somewhat similar except that freedmen were treated as free as soon as they came into British hands and there were no conditions nor bargains attached to recruitment. Six companies of freedmen were recruited into a Corps of Colonial Marines along the Atlantic coast, from Chesapeake Bay to Georgia.After that war, the British settled these Colonial Marines in British Empire colonies including Canada, Jamaica, and the Bahamas. Vice Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane, on taking over the command of British forces on the North America station on 2 April 1814, issued a proclamation offering a choice of enlistment or resettlement: Cochrane's recruitment of the Colonial Marines, mostly in the Chesapeake, went doubly against his orders from the British government, who had instructed him to accept volunteers for military service only from Georgia and South Carolina and to send all such volunteers away immediately for training overseas for the Army.UK National Archives ADM 1/4228 After the end of the War, the Colonial Marines were first stationed at the Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda. Although they had signed on for a military life, they rejected government orders to be transferred to the West India Regiments, and finally agreed to be settled in Trinidad and Tobago. The Governor of Trinidad, Sir Ralph Woodford, wanted to increase the number of small farmers in that colony and arranged for the creation of a village for each company on the Naparima Plain in the south of the island. Local planter Robert Mitchell managed the establishment and maintenance of the settlements, petitioning the governor for supplies when needed. Company villages Unlike the American refugees who were brought to Trinidad in 1815 in ships of the Royal Navy, and , the Veteran Marines were brought there in 1816, with their families, in the hired transports Mary & Dorothy and .John McNish Weiss, \\"‚ÄòAverse to any kind of controul‚Äô: American refugees from slavery building the new Royal Naval Dockyard at Bermuda\\", June 2012.UK National Archives ADM 1/3319, Field Officers' letters to Admy, 1815-1819. There were 574 former soldiers plus about 200 women and children. To balance the sexes, more black women were subsequently recruited ‚Äì women who had been freed from other places such as captured French slave ships. The six companies were each settled in a separate village under the command of a corporal or sergeant, who maintained a military style of discipline. Some of the villages were named after the companies and the Fifth and Sixth Company villages still retain those names. The villages were in a forested area of the Naparima Plain near a former Spanish mission, La Misi√≥n de Savana Grande. Each of the Veteran Marines were granted 16 acres of land and some of these plots are still farmed today by descendants of original settlers. The land was fertile but the conditions were primitive initially as the land had to be cleared and the lack of roads was an especial problem. It is sometimes said that some of the settlers were craftsmen more used to an urban environment and, as they had been expecting better, they were disgruntled and some returned to America, but this comment applies to later free Black American settlers, who came from towns, and not to the Veteran Colonial Marines, who were all refugees from the rural areas of the Chesapeake and Georgia. The settlers built houses from the timber they felled, and planting crops of bananas, cassava, maize and potatoes. Rice was introduced from America and was especially useful because it could be stored for long periods without spoiling. Twenty years after the initial establishment, the then governor Lord Harris supported improvements to the infrastructure of the settlements and arranged for the settlers to get deeds to their lands, so confirming their property rights as originally stated on arrival, though it is not clear that the initiative was carried through universally. As they prospered, they became a significant element in Trinidad's economy. Their agriculture advanced from subsistence farming to include cash crops of cocoa and sugar cane. Later, oil was discovered and then some descendants were able to lease their lands for the mineral rights. Others continued as independent market traders. Religion Many of the original settlers were Baptists from evangelical sects common in places such as Georgia and Virginia. The settlers kept this religion, which was reinforced by missionary work by Baptists from London who helped organise the construction of churches in the 1840s. The villages had pastors and other religious elders as authority figures and there was a rigorous moral code of abstinence and the puritan work ethic. African traditions were influential too and these included the ' system of communal help, herbal medicine and Obeah ‚Äì African tribal science. A prominent elder in the 20th century was \\"Papa Neezer\\" ‚Äì Samuel Ebenezer Elliot (1901‚Äì1969)Margarite Fern√°ndez Olmos, Lizabeth Paravisini- Gebert, \\"Obeah, Myal, and Quimbois\\", Creole Religions of the Caribbean: An Introduction from Vodou and Santer√≠a to Obeah and Espiritismo, NYU Press, 2011 (2nd edn), p. 164. ‚Äì who was a descendant of an original settler, George Elliot, and renowned for his ability to heal and cast out evil spirits.

Currently based in Newcastle upon Tyne, UK, she is the founder and director of the international and interdisciplinary digital art practice Attaya Projects. Early life Lalya Gaye was born in Geneva, Switzerland in 1978, the daughter of a Senegalese- Malian father and a Swedish mother (both International Labour Office officials), and the youngest of 8 children on her father's side. Her father was trade unionist Abdou Salam Gaye - a key figure in the African Trade Union Movement  and her mother is a feminist human rights activist. She was classically trained as a dancer in her youth and has been DJing since her teens. Education and career Mostly active as a digital media artist, Lalya also has a background in engineering, physics and interaction design, and extensive experience in interdisciplinary collaborations, academic and practical teaching, as well as project management. She received a B.Sc. in Physics at the University of Geneva, Switzerland in 1999, and a M.Sc.Eng. in Electroacoustics at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm, Sweden in 2002. She first started an art and design research career at the research group Future Applications Lab, Viktoria Institute, in Gothenburg, in Gothenburg, Sweden - a world-class innovation-focused research lab in Interaction Design, Ubiquitous Computing, Mobile Technology and Human-Computer Interaction. While in Gothenburg, she also worked on a PhD in Applied Information Technology at the University of Gothenburg, taught at the Interaction Design programme at Chalmers University of Technology, was a founding member of the Swedish art group D√•nk! Collective and freelanced for organisations including Medialab-Prado. Work Lalya Gaye's work lies at the intersection of art, technology, research and design. It explores the poetic and creative space between the physical and the digital. Her love for all things mundane, urban, sci fi and hip hop / drum-n-bass have had a significant impact on her art practice, prompting her to use digital technology as a malleable and experimental material that weaves into the physical world and everyday life. Related to her ethnic and family background, her work is socially-engaged, with reoccurring themes of creative appropriation of public space, migration, distance and longing. She works primarily with light, sound, steel, everyday objects, urban space and interactive electronics as medium. While a researcher at the Future Applications Lab (2002-2006), Lalya was at the forefront of locative media arts and interactive music research. Notable projects include the pioneering locative media arts project Sonic City, Tejp, and Context Photography. She was also active in the field as a steering committee member of the International Mobile Music Workshops series (one of the main locative media arts festivals and conferences of the time), as a member of the 'metareviewer' (editorial) program committee of the 2006 NIME conference, the leading conference on alternative musical interfaces, and through co-running dorkbot-gbg, the Gothenburg branch of the international dorkbot movement. While at Culture Lab (2010-2012), her research focused on designing for creative uses of digital technology for social inclusion and community work, and resulted in an AHRC-funded conference, an exhibition as co-curator and a book as co-editor about Connected Communities. Lalya Gaye has exhibited, lectured and performed internationally. Her work - as well as the work produced by her digital media arts practice Attaya Projects - has been featured at the NIME conference, Dokufest, Ulster Bank Belfast International Arts Festival, the DLI Museum & Art Gallery, Brass International Festival and Northern Design Festival among other places. Her work has received grants from among others the AHRC and Arts Council England, has been commissioned by international festivals such as Festival of Lights (Lyon), and has received extensive press coverage through the years. Attaya Projects was featured in both 2014 and 2015 in the Hannah Directory of \\"people doing great things in the North of England\\" as one of the best creative practices in the North of England. Notable projects =Sonic City= Sonic City (2002‚Äì2004) was a locative media art project that explored mobile interaction and wearable technology for generating music in everyday life. The project was led by Lalya Gaye (while at the Viktoria Institute) and Ramia Maz√© (while at The Interactive Institute), and included wearable artist Margot Jacobs (also at The Interactive Institute) as well as sound-artist Daniel Skoglund from 8Tunnel2. Turning the urban environment into a digital music interface while walking through it, Sonic City was one of the pioneer projects of the mobile music field and contributed to establishing it. The project has been well- published and well-cited in academia, received a lot of attention in the new media arts scene, and has received extensive media and blog coverage. Among other places, Sonic City was presented at e.g. NIME and Cybersonica, and was demoed EU's IST 2004 event in The Hague as an example of innovative European research. It was featured in the Leonardo Electronic Almanac special issue on locative media, and discussed in a number of books and leading publications about sound, technology and urban space as a \\"classic\\" in terms of digital technology and sound creatively redefining public space. =Locative media projects= * Tejp (2003-2004): Tejp was a series of low-tech design experiments that explored various means of overlaying and revealing personal digital traces in public spaces. Borrowing from notions of media parasiting and situationist d√©tournement, physical urban infrastructures were used as intrinsic parts of the technology. Experiments included \\"audio tags\\" placed on walls, which whispered messages to by-passers as they leaned towards it, and radio antennas extended by metallic urban infrastructures that amplified and revealed layers of mobile phone communications in urban space. This project was co-produced with Margot Jacobs from The Interactive Institute. * Context Photography (2004): A collaboration with researchers Maria H√•kansson and Sara Ljungblad, this design research project produced a series of augmented digital cameras, in which sensor data impacted on the visual of photographs as they were being taken. =Art installations= * Yellooooow Splitch* (2008): Yellow Splitch was a touring light and sound installation by architecture resp. art collectives Metipolis and D√•nk! Collective, first commissioned by the Festival of Lights (Lyon) 2008. Its first incarnation consisted of 5000 transparent cups that hanged over a dark alley in the centre of Lyon, France. These were filled with a fluorescent solution that glowed in the night in sync with the rhythm and spatiality of a generative soundscape. The installation was re- created in August 2009 for the Flow Festival in Helsinki, Finland and in November 2011 for the Julstaden light festival in Gothenburg, Sweden, and the Luci (Lighting Urban Community International) meeting. It was the first light- based art installation to ever use dynamic UV light or ‚Äúblack‚Äù light. * Arbre √† Palabre (2009): A temporary 3D street-art installation dedicated to local immigrant communities in Providence, RI, USA. By referencing the widespread tradition of painted white tree trunks, the piece ‚Äúteleported‚Äù a simple detail of foreign everyday life ‚Äì which happens to be shared by all of the local immigrants' countries of origin ‚Äì into their current reality. Made of steel yet disjointed as if prone to radio interferences, it reflected the anchored yet stretched nature of migration. Augmented with an audio transducer that turned its metallic structure into a large scale street-speaker that vibrated to the sound of foreign music, it also acted as an audio link to distant soundscapes. This piece ‚Äì the first of a series on the theme of ‚Äòdiaspora‚Äô and ‚Äòhome‚Äô was realised as part of Lalya's artist residency at Rhode Island School of Design, in collaboration with The Steel Yard and with the support of the local neighbourhood association. In 2012, this piece awarded Lalya Gaye a feature in Stigmart/10 Annual Review of Contemporary Arts as one of the 10 most promising contemporary artists under the age of 34. * Cycles of Brass (2014): A visual and sound installation co-produced with Swedish artists Alexander Berman and Filip Strebeyko, in which two brass instruments suspended in separate transparent water tanks are exposed to opposite transformative chemical reactions; one progressively decaying, and the other being progressively restored throughout a period of three months. These processes are translated into an abstract brass soundscape that changes in parallel with the instruments using sensor and sound processing technology. This installation was commissioned by Brass:Pitch, the digital media art programme at the Durham Brass International Festival, and co-funded by the Arts Council England and the Swedish Arts Grants Committee. It was on view at the DLI Art Gallery in Durham, UK, for 3 months, during which the piece was gradually changing, both visually and sonically. It was also featured on the popular blog about creative digital technologies, Creative Applications * Oh My Home - Lost & Found (2015): A public space installation, series of workshops and set of performances realised with artists Saadia Hussain and Ixone Ormaetxe and touring across Europe between 2015 and 2017. This piece address the notion of ‚Äúhome‚Äù from a broad perspective: the domestic, the migrant and the contested, as part of the European experience, through the use of a large number of activated \\"immigrant bags\\" taking over public spaces. This piece is part of the EU's Creative Europe programme Corners. It has been presented at Kosovo's Dokufest festival, Ulster Bank Belfast International Arts Festival, as well as featured in Swedish, Kosovar and Northern Irish media (national television and local press). Other work Alongside her art practice, Lalya is currently a member of all-female North East England DJ collective Montoya. She is an executive member on the board of the Artists' Union England  the first and only union representing visual artists in England.

Her father, the writer Joseph Claude McNish, was descended from the Merikin settlers in Trinidad.Bullard, Mary R., Cumberland Island: A History, University of Georgia Press, 2005, pp. 140, 320. She painted as a child, helped with her mother's dressmaking business by doing sketches, was a junior member of the Trinidad Arts Society and had her first exhibition at the age of 16.\\"Bringing the tropics to post-war Britain\\" Good At Looking, 3 August 2018. Her influences included local artists Sybil Atteck, Amy Leong Pang and Boscoe Holder, and European modernists such as Vincent Van Gogh. In 1951 McNish moved with her mother to London, England, to join her father there.Anne Walmsley (1992), The Caribbean Artists Movement 1966‚Äì1972: A Literary and Cultural Study, London/Port of Spain: New Beacon Books, p. 18. She already had a place to study at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in Bedford Square but instead took courses at the London School of Printing and Graphic Arts, the Central School of Arts and Crafts and the Royal College of Art. In her final year at the London School of Printing and Graphic Arts, she became interested in textiles with the encouragement of Eduardo Paolozzi, and chose printed textiles as her subject of study on progressing to the Royal College of Art, where her talent was recognised by Hugh Casson. On graduating, she immediately won a commission from Arthur Stewart-Liberty, head of the Liberty department store, sending her the same day by taxi to Zika Ascher, who commissioned her to design a collection for Dior.Angela Cobbinah, \\"Obituary: Althea, textile revolutionary, brought splash of tropical colour to Britain\\", Islington Tribune, 24 April 2020. Successfully designing for such prestigious clients, McNish was the first Caribbean woman to achieve prominence in this field. In 1966, McNish designed fabrics for the official wardrobe of Elizabeth II's during the Queen's visit to Trinidad. She took part in the art exhibitions of the Caribbean Artists Movement (CAM) held in 1967, May 1968 and January 1971, exhibiting textiles as well as \\"plastic panels in laminate\\".Walmsley (1992), pp. 87, 135, 150, 228, 285. For the Caribbean edition of the BBC TV magazine programme Full House, produced by John La Rose and transmitted on 3 February 1973, she brought together the work of CAM visual artists as a studio setting for CAM writers, musicians and film- makers.\\"Full House  BBC Two England, 3 February 1973 21.00\\", Radio Times, Issue 2569, 1 February 1973, p. 15.

In 1969 she married John Weiss, architect, jeweller and historian, and worked in partnership with him from 1971. They were in conversation with John La Rose on 2 February 1999 as part of the \\"Life Experience With Britain\\" series held at New Beacon Books (other participants included Dennis Bovell, Gus John, Rev.

At the time of Weiss's death in 2018, Jake Leith, former president of the Chartered Society of Designers, said: \\"John and Althea were great ambassadors for the UK Fashion and Textile Design Sector.\\" Notable designs Most of McNish's designs are based on nature though some use abstract themes, occasionally geometric. One of her first designs to go into production, Golden Harvest in 1957, was a screen print on cotton satin, later manufactured by Hull Traders (for whom she also created eight other patterns),\\"Althea McNish Revolutionary Fabrics & Furniture - Hull\\", RCA Society. the design being based on an Essex wheatfield but using tropical colours. A number of her early designs including Tropic,\\"Tropic\\" at V&A.; a dress fabric printed on silk and produced by Zika Ascher in 1959, and Gilia, a cotton furnishing fabric featuring tropical foliage in green and gold, produced by Hull Traders in 1961, are in the textile collection at the Victoria & Albert Museum. Also in 1959, for a commission by the Design Research Unit for the new SS Oriana, which was launched in November 1959 and was the last of the Orient Steam Navigation Company's ocean liners, she produced murals for two restaurants, Rayflower\\"SS Oriana: 'Rayflower' mural in Warerite by Althea McNish in the Tourist Restaurant\\", RIBApix. and Pineapples and pomegranates,Photograph of Oriana restaurant.\\"'Oriana' - Tourist Restaurant\\". A postcard from the P&O-Orient; liner \\"Oriana\\" of 1960: \\"Friendly and picturesque, this restaurant combines gaiety with unobtrusive surroundings.\\" Designed by Brian O'Rourke. laminated into Warerite plastic panels, a line later pursued by Perstorp Group. The 1960 modernisation of the interior of the Port of Spain General Hospital, Trinidad, by the architects Devereux and Davies, included murals by McNish. In 1997, reviewing the exhibition Transforming the Crown: African, Asian and Caribbean Artists in Britain, 1966‚Äì1996, in which McNish participated at the Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, with other CAM artists, The New York Times reported that she \\"produces abstract, geometric fabric designs inspired by African motifs\\".Cotter, Holland, \\"ART REVIEW; This Realm of Newcomers, This England\\", The New York Times, 24 October 1997.

Cosmic rays from outer space generate muons in the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere as a result of nuclear reactions between primary cosmic rays and atmospheric nuclei. They are highly penetrative and millions of muons pass through our bodies every day. Muography utilizes muons by tracking the number of muons that pass through the target volume to determine the density of the inaccessible internal structure. Muography is a technique similar in principle to radiography (imaging with X-rays) but capable of surveying much larger objects. Since muons are less likely to interact, stop and decay in low density matter than high density matter, a larger number of muons will travel through the low density regions of target objects in comparison to higher density regions. The apparatuses record the trajectory of each event to produce a muogram that displays the matrix of the resulting numbers of transmitted muons after they have passed through hectometer to kilometer-sized objects. The internal structure of the object, imaged in terms of density, is displayed by converting muograms to muographs. Etymology There are two explanations for the origin of the word ‚Äúmuography‚Äù: (A) a combination of the elementary particle ‚Äúmuon‚Äù and Greek Œ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒÆ (graph√©), ‚Äúdrawing‚Äù Œ≥œÅŒ±œÜŒÆ, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek- English Lexicon, on Perseus together suggesting the meaning ‚Äúdrawing with muons‚Äù; and (B) a shortened combination of ‚Äúmuon‚Äù and ‚Äúradiography‚Äù. Although these techniques are related, they differ in that radiography uses x-rays to image the inside of objects in the scale of meters and muography uses muons to image the inside of objects in the scale of hectometers to kilometers. Invention of muography =Precursor technologies= 20 years after Carl David Anderson and Seth Neddermeyer discovered that muons were generated from cosmic rays in 1936, the Australian physicist E.P. George made the first known attempt to measure the areal density of the rock overburden of the Guthega- Munyang tunnel (part of the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme) with cosmic ray muons. He used a Geiger counter. Although he succeeded in measuring the areal density of rock overburden placed above the detector, and even successfully matched the result from core samples, due to the lack of directional sensitivity in the Geiger counter, imaging was impossible. =First muogram= The first muogram was a matrix of the number of muon events produced in 1970 by the American physicist Luis Walter Alvarez. Alvarez installed his apparatus in the Belzoni Chamber to search for hidden chambers of the Pyramid of Chephren. He recorded the number of muons after they had passed through the Pyramid. With an invention of this particle tracking technique, he worked out the methods to generate the muogram as a function of muon's arriving angles. The generated muogram was compared with the results of the computer simulations, and he concluded that there were no hidden chambers in the Pyramid of Chephren after the apparatus was exposed to the Pyramid for several months. =Film muography= Tanaka and Niwa‚Äôs pioneering work created film muography, which utilizes nuclear emulsion. Exposures of nuclear emulsions were taken in the direction of the volcano and then analyzed with a newly invented scanning microscope, custom built for the purpose of identifying particle tracks more efficiently. Film muography enabled them to obtain the first interior imaging of an active volcano in 2007, revealing the structure of the magma pathway of Asama volcano. =Real-time muography= In 1968, the group of Alvarez used spark chambers with a digital read out for their Pyramid experiment. Tracking data from the apparatus was onto magnetic tape in the Belzoni Chamber, then the data were analyzed by the IBM 1130 computer, and later by the CDC 6600 computer located at Ein Shams University and Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, respectively. Strictly speaking these were not real time measurements. Real-time muography requires muon sensors to convert the muon's kinetic energy into a number of electrons in order to process muon events as electronic data rather than as chemical changes on film. Electronic tracking data can be processed almost instantly with an adequate computer processor; in contrast, film muography data have to be developed before the muon tracks can be observed. Real-time tracking of muon trajectories produce real-time muograms that would be difficult or impossible to obtain with film muography. =High-resolution muography= The MicroMegas detector has a positioning resolution of 0.3 mm, an order of magnitude higher than that of the scintillator-based apparatus (10 mm), and thus has a capability to create better angular resolution for muograms. Fields of study =Geology= Vesuvius The Mu-Ray project has been using muography to image Vesuvious, famous for its eruption of 79 AD, which destroyed local settlements including Pompeii and Herculaneum. Etna The ASTRI SST-2M Project is using muography to generate the internal images of the magma pathways of Etna volcano. The last major eruption of 1669 caused widespread damage and the death of approximately 20,000 people. Monitoring the magma flows with muography may help to predict the direction from which lava from future eruptions may emit. Stromboli The apparatuses use nuclear emulsions to collect data near Stromboli volcano. Recent emulsion scanning improvements developed during the course of the Oscillation Project with Emulsion tRaking Apparatus (OPERA experiment) led to film muography. Unlike other muography particle trackers, nuclear emulsion can acquire high angular resolution without electricity. An emulsion-based tracker has been collecting data at Stromboli since December 2011. Puy de D√¥me Since 2010, a muographic imaging survey has been conducted at the dormant volcano, Puy de D√¥me, in France. It has been utilizing the existing closed building structures located directly underneath the southern and eastern sides of the volcano for equipment testing and experiments. Preliminary muographs have revealed previously unknown density features at the top of Puy de D√¥me that have been confirmed with gravimetric imaging. Underground water monitoring Muography has been applied to groundwater and saturation level monitoring for bedrock in a landslide area as a response to major rainfall events. The measurement results were compared with borehole groundwater level measurements and rock resistivity. Glacier tomography Muography allowed to determine the bedrock geometry beneath active glaciers in the steep alpine environment of the Jungfrau region in Switzerland. The methodology provided important information on subglacial mechanisms of bedrock erosion. =Archeology= Egyptian Pyramids In 2015, 35 years after Alvarez‚Äôs experiment, the ScanPyramids Project, which is composed of an international team of scientists from Egypt, France, Canada, and Japan, has started utilizing muography and thermography imaging to survey the Giza pyramid complex. In 2017, scientists involved in the project discovered a large cavity, named ScanPyramids Big Void, above the Grand Gallery of the Great Pyramid of Giza. Mexican Pyramids The 3rd largest pyramid in the world, the Pyramid of the Sun, situated near Mexico City in the ancient city of Teotihuacan was surveyed with muography. One of the motivations of the team was to discover if inaccessible chambers inside the Pyramid might hold the tomb of a Teotihuacan ruler. The apparatus was transported in components and then reassembled inside a small tunnel leading to an underground chamber directly underneath the pyramid. A low density region approximately 60 meters wide was reported as a preliminary result, which has led some researchers to suggest that the structure of the pyramid might have been weakened and it is in danger of collapse. =Planetary Science= Mars Muography may potentially be implemented to image extraterrestrial objects such as the geology of Mars. Cosmic rays are numerous and omnipresent in outer space. Therefore, it is predicted that the interaction of the cosmic rays in the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere to generate pions/mesons and subsequently to decay into muons also occurs in the atmosphere of other planets. It has been calculated that the atmosphere of Mars is sufficient to produce a horizontal muon flux for practical muography, roughly equivalent to the Earth‚Äôs muon flux. In the future, it may be viable to include a high-resolution muography apparatus in a future space mission to Mars, for instance inside a Mars rover. Getting accurate images of the density of Martian structures could be used for surveying sources of ice or water. Small Solar System Bodies The ‚ÄúNASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) program‚Äù is now in the process of assessing whether muography may be used for imaging the density structures of small solar system bodies (SSBs). While the SSBs tend to generate lower muon flux than the Earth's atmosphere, some are sufficient to allow for muography of objects ranging from 1 km or less in diameter. The program includes calculating the muon flux for each potential target, creating imaging simulations and considering the engineering challenges of building a more lightweight, compact apparatus appropriate for such a mission. Industry use Industrial muography is a technique that produces muograms/muographs of industrial objects in order to internally inspect these objects. Recently, industrial muography has found an application in reactor inspection. It was used to locate the nuclear fuel in the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, which was damaged by the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami. Advantages There are several advantages that muography has over traditional geophysical surveys. First, muons are naturally abundant and travel from the atmosphere towards the Earth‚Äôs surface. This abundant muon flux is nearly constant, therefore muography can be utilized worldwide. Second, because of the high- contrast resolution of muography, a small void of less than 0.001% of the entire volume can be distinguished. Finally, the apparatus has much lower power requirements than other imaging techniques since they use natural probes, rather than relying on artificially generated signals. Process In the field of muography, the transmission coefficient is defined as the ratio of the transmission through the object over the incident muon flux. By applying the muon's range through matter to the open-sky muon energy spectrum, the value of the fraction of incident muon flux that is transmitted through the object can be analytically derived. A muon with a different energy has a different range, which is defined as a distance that the incident muon can traverse in matter before it stops. For example, 1 TeV energy muons have a continuous slowing down approximation range (CSDA range) of 2500 m water equivalent (m.w.e.) in silica dioxide whereas the range is reduced to 400 m.w.e. for 100 GeV muons. This range varies if the material is different, e.g., 1 TeV muons have a CSDA range of 1500 m.w.e. in lead. The numbers (or later represented by color) comprising a muogram are displayed in terms of the transmitted number of muon events. Each pixel in the muogram is a two dimensional unit based on the angular resolution of the apparatus. The phenomenon that muography cannot differentiate density variations is called the \\"Volume Effects.\\" Volume Effects happen when a large amount of low density materials and a thin layer of high density materials cause the same attenuation in muon flux. Therefore, in order to avoid false data arising from Volume Effects, the exterior shape of the volume has to be accurately determined and used for analyzing the data. Technical aspects The apparatus is a muon-tracking device that consists of muon sensors and recording media. There are several different kinds of muon sensors used in muography apparatuses: plastic scintillators, nuclear emulsions, or gaseous ionization detectors. The recording medium is the film itself, digital magnetic or electronic memory. The apparatus is directed towards the target volume, exposing the muon sensor until the muon events required in order to form a statistically sufficient muogram are recorded, after which, (post processing) a muograph displaying the average density along each muon path is created.

It describes her early childhood in Africa, her schooling in Germany and Switzerland and her university studies in the United States. Background Massaquoi first embarked on the story of her life in 1939 while studying social psychology at Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee. The Chinese scholar Bingham Dai had given her the assignment as a class project. Her professor, Mark Hanna Watkins, with whom she was working on linguistic studies in 1943, encouraged her to continue the work. In a letter dated 22 February 1944, her professor Mark Hanna Watkins wrote that he had encouraged her to write the \\"story of her life as a tribal child, in contact with and reaction to European culture as represented in Monrovia and the mission school, life and education in Germany and Switzerland; life in America\\". Massaquoi had also collaborated with Watkins on a dictionary of the Vai language which he tried to publish as his own work. In 1945, she won a permanent injunction against Watkins, Dr. Thomas E. Jones, president of the university, and Fisk University prohibiting them from publishing or receiving any financial rewards from any publication of her work. Massaquoi felt that she had been \\"conspired against\\" because she was foreign and did not have the strength to fight for her rights. In 1946 while at Boston University, Massaquoi completed her autobiography (which was originally titled Bush to Boulevard: The Autobiography of a Vai Noblewoman). In 1968, while living in Monrovia, Liberia, with her daughter Vivian Seton and her grandchildren, Massaquoi suffered a stroke. This pressed Seton into having the 700 pages of her mother's unpublished autobiography microfilmed, calling on the assistance of colleagues at the University of Liberia. Massaquoi died in 1978. Her microfilmed manuscripts were discovered much later by German researcher Konrad Tuchscherer, while conducting other research. \\"I just thought it was the most amazing piece I had ever seen,\\" he commented. \\"I was very interested in the history of the Massaquoi family because they had such an important role in spreading the Vai script.\\" Arthur Abraham, a historian at Virginia State University, Massaquoi's daughter, Vivian Seton, and Tuchscherer, edited Massaquoi's accounts of her early experiences in Germany and the United States.

It is the site of deposits of many rare-earth minerals - 16 minerals were first discovered here, including Ilmenite (named for the site), Monazite, Cancrinite, and Samarskite-(Y). There have been over 400 mines in the area over the years. The Reserve's geological museum is one of the largest in Russia. The forest cover is pine and larch forest on low hills of the Ilmensky Mountains and foothill ridges on east side of the south Ural Mountains. The reserve is situated just north and east of the city of Miass, in the Chebarkulsky District of Chelyabinsk Oblast. It is also 20 kkm east of Taganay National Park and 75 km west of Chelyabinsk. Topography The Ilmensky Reserve is located on the east slope of the southern Urals, where the terrain flattens from low mountains (400 meters altitude) to a district of lakes and rolling hills. The reserve is rectangular in shape, 70 km from north to south, and 10 km from west to east. The Miass River runs north-south along the west border of the reserve. The highest point, Ilmen Tau, is 750 meters above sea level. Ilmenite, the most important Titanium ore, was first discovered on the site of the Ilmen Reserve The geology is a complex assortment of igneous and metamorphic rock. The granitic formations contain many pegmatite veins with associated minerals. The reserve has recorded 278 species of minerals, and 70 kinds of rock. Climate and Ecoregion Ilmen is located in the Kazakh forest steppe ecoregion. Steppe with long \\"\\"ribbon forests\\"\\" of pine; about 300‚Äì500 miles more northerly than the European Russian forest. This ecoregion has more wetlands and more continental climate than the European forest steppe. The climate of Ilmen is Humid continental climate, warm summer (K√∂ppen climate classification (Dfb)). This climate is characterized by large swings in temperature, both diurnally and seasonally, with mild summers and cold, snowy winters. Rainfall varies from 500 to 800 mm per year, peaking in the summer. Snow reaches a depth of 1 meter, with snow cover averaging 195 days. The frost-free period lasts 80‚Äì90 days. Flora and fauna The dark taiga is to the west, on the mountain ridges; Ilmen is more in a pine and birch forest subzone. Forests cover 85% of the Reserve - of which 55% is pine (Pinus sylvestris), and about 40% birch. The remaining 5% is mostly meadow, and steppe. Because 9% of the reserve is lake and river, the surrounding floodplains and dead birch trees provide a good habitat for mushrooms which are an object of study at the site. Throughout the reserves history, the mammals and birds of the region have been the subject of frequent scientific publication. Ecotourism As a strict nature reserve, the Ilmen Reserve is mostly closed to the general public, although scientists and those with 'environmental education' purposes can make arrangements with park management for visits. Other members of the public seeking access must apply to the main office in the city of Miass. Ilmen Reserve (left distance) is on the west shore of Lake Bolshoy Kisegach Mineralogical Museum The Reserve's Natural Science Museum in the city of Miass, created in 1925, is one of the five largest Russian geological-mineralogical museums. It is housed in a three-story building, with six rooms and a total area of 2,050 m2. The Museum Foundation has 30 thousand units of storage, with 9000 on exhibit. The museum is a major regional center of education in the natural sciences, receiving 50 thousand visitors per year.

The Hollywood Reporter, 20 February 2016. The film stars Naomi Nero as Felipe/Pierre, a teenager whose life and sense of self is turned upside down when he learns that the woman who raised him is not his real mother, having instead stolen him from a hospital shortly after he was born. Plot Pierre is for the most part a typical middle class Brazilian teenager. He is constantly exploring his gender identity and sexual orientation without much thought or consequence. Felipe lives in a suburb of S√£o Paulo with his adoptive mother and sister in a modest but apparently happy home. His carefree teenage existence is destroyed when he is found by detectives that reveal to him that his real name is Felipe, and that he was stolen from the hospital by the woman he calls his mother. After DNA testing reveals his true parentage, Felipe/Pierre's custody is given to his birth family, while his \\"adoptive\\" mother is sent to prison for stealing not only Pierre but also his sister from another family. Having no alternative and completely in shock, Felipe/Pierre is forced to move in with the upper class, conservative family. Soon after the teenager moves in and the initial excitement wears off, Pierre's parents start trying to change him to make him fit better in their own lifestyle. Felipe/Pierre's gender-bending ways in specific cause a lot of distress to the father, who is mostly unwilling to accept Felipe/Pierre the way he is. A series of increasingly serious conflicts emerges as their expectations of their missing son seem totally alien to the person Pierre believes he is. In the end, his biological brother, ironically ignored and seemingly invisible to their parents, is the only person that seems to understand him.

The History of Reynolds and Branson Ltd Co 1816 ‚Äì 1972 The original company can be traced back to 1816( See Grace's Guide which is the leading source of historical information on industry and manufacturing in Britain, The Company was established in 1816) Edward Matterson druggist who was running the firm at 12, Briggate, Leeds in 1822, Matterson was educated at Leeds Grammar School, the company had moved to 13 Briggate, Leeds by 1829 ( 1822 Baines's Directory and Gazette Edward Matterson is a druggist, and dealer in paint and colours, Location 12, Briggate, Leeds ) (Edward Matterson in Pigot's Directory of 1829 he is still druggist but now located 13 Briggate & 4 Blundel place)( also Noted Baines's Directory 1822 John Cudworth Hop Merchants was located at 13, Briggate Leeds ) ( Noted William West is a druggist, located at 14, Briggate in 1822. ) Edward Matterson had been employed by Allen and Hanburys, in 1833 William West F.R.S. took over the company after Matterson went bankrupt, ( see The bankrupt directory: being a complete register of all the bankrupts, with their residences, trades, and dates when they appeared in the London gazette, from December 1820 to April 1843 ), In 1839 Thomas Harvey joined the business, when William West left the company to pursue analytical chemistry. The firm was then called Thomas Harvey. Harvey was born at Barnsley into a Quaker family, his father was a linen manufacturer. The second of five children, he was educated at Barnsley Grammar, in Yorkshire in 1812. From 1822 to 1825 Harvey studied at Ackworth and afterwards became a chemist apprentice for David Doncaster of Sheffield. Upon Doncasters death he trained at Thomas Southalls in Birmingham for eight years. In 1837 Harvey settled in Leeds as a chemist becoming an Anti-slavery campaigner and philanthropist. In 1844 Richard Reynolds joined the company an apprentice, he was born in 1829 and was the eldest son of an apothecary who died when the boy was only four years old. 1850 to 1851 he attended the school of Pharmacy in London where he took first prizes in chemistry, materia and botany in a contest held by the pharmaceutical society. He then went to Mr. Henry Deane at Chapman for two years, then returned to the Leeds business. In 1854 Richard Reynolds joined Thomas Harvey as a partner, the company then became Harvey & Reynolds. In 1861, the firm was joined by a Mr. Fowler and became Harvey, Reynolds & Fowler. By 1864, Thomas Harvey had retired, ( in 1884 Thomas Harvey at the age of 72 undertook arduous journey to Canada on a Quaker mission, but it exhausted him. He died On 25 December, at his home at ‚ÄòAshwood‚Äô, Headingley Lane, on Christmas Day.) Mr. Haw joined the business and the company became Haw & Reynolds. In 1867, the business was listed as Haw, Reynolds, & Co. In 1883, Fredrick W Branson joined the business. with Richard Reynolds at Leeds, England. Richard Reynolds took on Fredrick W Branson as a partner in the established company. An 1884 advertisement listed the partnership between Reynolds & Branson ( late Harvey, Reynolds & co.) The firm of Reynolds & Branson was registered in July 1898 as a limited corporation with a capital of ¬£34,000 in shares of ¬£10 each by Messrs. R. Reynolds, F. W. Branson and R. F. Reynolds being the first. No remuneration was given to Mr. R. Reynolds, but a ¬£700 each per annum to the others. The business was located at 14 Commercial Street and 13 Briggate, Leeds. In 1890 Richard Reynolds son, Richard Freshfield (Fred) Reynolds was made a partner. The firm was in the business of wholesale and retail chemists and surgical instrument makers. FRS. Fredrick W Branson now focused on the development of scientific apparatus and chemical glassware for the business. ( His partner Richard Reynolds was a Fellow of the Chemical Society. He was elected member in 1864 and served as council member since 1870. In 1894, he was elected vice-president. In 1900, he died at home at Cliff Road, Hyde Park in Leeds.[3][4]) In 1901 During the outbreak of lead poisoning at Morley he was called in and his recommendations freed Morley from this scourge. In collaboration with A. F. Dimmock, M.D., he contributed to the British Medical Association meeting in 1903 a paper \\" A new method for the determination of uric acid in urine \\" (Br. Med. J., 1903, 2, 585). For this process he devised a correction scale which was contributed to the British Pharmaceutical Conference in 1904. At the 1905 meeting of the British Medical Association a further paper by these two authors was read, \\" A rapid and simple process for the estimation of uric acid \\" (ibid., 1905, 2, 1104), in which uric acid was precipitated and the precipitate measured in a specially graduated tube, In 1914, in collaboration with Dr. Gordon Sharp, he contributed a paper to the British Pharmaceutical Conference on the activity of digitalis leaves and the stability and standardisation of tinctures of digitalis. He was an expert glassblower. During World War I, he actively pursued efforts to standardise the size and shape of chemical glassware. In 1916, he was elected as an inaugural member of the Society of Glass Technology. He organised research and published works on these topics. Branson sought to secure in Great Britain the manufacturing process for the glass required for the equipment of munition factories.Branson, F. W. (1915).

Branson contributed a paper on the composition of some types of chemical glassware to the Society of Chemical Industry (J. SOC. Chem. Ind., 1915, 34, 471) in collaboration with his son Frederick Hartridge, a paper to the Transactions of the Society of Glass Technology (1919, 3, 249)\\" A proposed standard formula for a glass for lamp workers. Branson was chairman until retirement in 1932. His son, Frederick Hartridge, Associate of the Royal Institute of Chemistry AIC, became chairman and managing director of the company. until his untimely death on 10 February 1952, he had appointed his 3 Sons and Daughter as directors of The company. Frederick Norman the eldest son who attended Ilkley Grammar an all-boys school, Eileen his only daughter, Peter Orchard who as Director of Phospherade, which was the mineral water company, He attended Roundhay all- boys grammar school. World War II he was in the RAF with 54 Spitfire squadron, in 1942 married Rita Blackburn, he went to Australia with 54 Spitfire squadron at the end of 1942, he met Patricia A Grant his second wife, He married Patricia in Leeds 1948, Peter emigrated to Australia 1953, when his father died leaving the bulk of the business to his eldest brother Frederick Norman, He set up his own pharmacy in Blackburn South in 1955. He later become a Podiatrist retiring at the age of 90, Richard Orchard who attended Roundhay all-boys grammar school, World War II Richard was also in RAF as a pilot he died on active service 1945. His eldest son Frederick Norman Branson became chairman & managing director of Reynolds & Branson in 1953, at this point the company had a workforce of 150 people, In 1972 Frederick Norman sold the business to Barclay, later selling to the asset strippers Slater & Walker. Noted that it was a sad end to a company which had been based in Leeds, in some form or another for 156 years.

Glasser referred to the work of R√∂ntgen and the attempt to measure the photographic quality of the R√∂ntgen rays: \\"R√∂ntgen had studied carefully the penetration of the roentgen rays through a series of substances and had used for such measurements small ladders of metal of a type which in later years was used generally. This idea was made practical by an English firm [Reynolds and Branson], who arranged aluminium in gradations or steps in the shape of a circle so that an aluminium ladder was formed with steps of from 1 to 10 mm. in thickness. With this arrangement the hardness of the rays could be determined on a fluorescent screen as that thickness which could just be penetrated by the rays.\\"Glasser, Otto. (1934).

Marie Curie had discovered radium. In June 1903, the Curie couple were invited to present a talk on radioactivity at the Royal Institution in London. Pierre Curie made the presentation, as women were prohibited from speaking engagements at the Royal Institution. In July 1904, Branson gave a presentation titled Radium and its Properties and made a demonstration with radium before members of the Leeds Geological Society and the Leeds Naturalist Club.Greenwood, H.

He led his forces against Montenegrins and Ottomans throughout his life, and his deeds were heard of in \\"The New York Times\\" in 1911. His daughter, the famous Tringe Smajli, replaced him during the Battle of Vranje in 1911 and the Albanian forces were victorious. Already as an 18 year old Martini fought the Ottoman occupiers and participated in many battles around the Malesia Highlands. He came from an patriotic family, together with Prec and Bace Vuksani, known for battles during the 1780s. In 1835, Ivezaj fought at the castle and church of Shkodra against the Ottomans. During the Battle of Vranje, Smajl Martini was kidnapped and never seen again.  Life  At the age of 17, he lost his parents and grew up constantly fighting occupiers. He led many victorious forces all around Northern Albania against the Ottomans. The Ottomans, being unable to defeat his forces, followed his activities and captured him in 1883 where he was temporarily isolated. In 1886 the military court of the Sultan sentenced him, together with his men Ded Ula, Ujk Dushi, Shabe Smaku, Gic Gila, Prek Gjetja, Lulash Deda and Lucew Preka to eternal banishment. However, escaping Ottoman custody, he returned to fight with Baca Kurti with the League of Prizren, and later with Ded Gjo Luli in 1878. Much of the history about the Gruda and Hoti tribes were documented by the author Toni Assagazino, who in 1780 wrote of the Malsia Highlands struggle. In 1856, he wrote about the roles of the bajraktars had to protect Albanian lands. According to Andrija Jovicecic, Smajl Martini continued to fight the Montenegrin occupiers with the same force as he did when fighting the Turks. His struggle was heard of in America, and \\"The New York Times\\" wrote of his bravery on 21 May 1911. Despite that he lost his parents at the age of 17, he continued to struggle and he lost two sons, Gjon and Pjeter, fighting Montenegro and he also lost his daughter fighting the Ottomans. Small Martini is today a venerated figure amongst Albanians.  Death  Smajl Martini was kidnapped during the battle of Vranje in 1911 by Ottomans and was never heard of again.

The building is registered on the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship Heritage List. History =Early times= On the initiative of two merchants, Herman Kraus and Karl Wenzl, the Board of the Volunteer Fire Department in Bydgoszcz has been established on March 20, 1864 and began its duty on June 2, 1864. In addition to the Volunteer Brigade, a professional Fire Brigade was created established in 1872, having its headquarters in Poor Clares' Church which had been secularized. To fit fire activity, a gate was created on the wall of the ex-church giving onto Jagiello≈Ñska street: doing so allowed horse carts to enter and exit. Likewise, stables and forage storage were located in an adjoining building (now located at the place of Drukarnia shopping mall). The Chief fireman officer, known as Brandmeister, received a professional training in Berlin. In 1893 the Guard received its first steam- powered fire engine. In 1894, 14 fire signaling systems were set up in the city and between 1898 and 1900, the first fire hydrants appeared in the streets. Firefighter equipment was modern for those times, and the increasing need for storage resulted in the brigade leaving their tight premises of Poor Clares' former church. The new fire station designed by Theodore Patzwald and located at Pomorska N¬∞16 (then RinkauerStra√üe 63), was declared operational on December 23, 1911. At that time, firefighters were equipped among others, with: * Horse-drawn carts; * Hand pumping machines; * Water barrels; * Pike poles * Anchors; * Adzes; * Fire flappers. Pomorska street with the firestation ca 1915 In the early 20 century, Bydgoszcz had almost 400 Fire hydrants ( among which 136 underground ones): they were supplied with water from 20 deep wells. Location of the fire station on a 1914 city map =Interwar period= Polish municipal authorities, took over German professional fire department: they increased personnel by 52 firefighters and modernized the equipment with horses drawn fire sprinklers and two horse-drawn vehicles equipped with a pump steam. In 1927, new investment provided the department with two French produced \\"Lafli\\" fire engines, one mechanical ladder, one tanker and one car. As a consequence of a bill voted at the parliament on March 13, 1934, on protection against fires, fire protection was considered as an competence under the responsibility of the government. Thus, the fire brigade became subordinated to the city mayor of Bydgoszcz. =World War II= Acts of war fully mobilized firefighters during the conflict. The professional fire brigade was divided into five sub-units, which were deployed in various parts of the city. After a full day of fire fight started by military skirmishes on the September 2, 1939, Bydgoszcz fire brigade was ordered to evacuate the city the following day. The leaving party comprised 17 cars, 5 carriages with 62 professional firefighters and 75 personnel to the reserve. Part of the team fled to the eastern territories: after arriving to Kaunas area, the equipment fell into the hands of soviet authorities. Several firefighters returned to Bydgoszcz, and some emigrated abroad. With Bydgoszcz re-incorporated to German Reich, German forces organized the fire Brigade by their standards, as a Police Fire department (), subordinated to Gda≈Ñsk authority. 36 Polish firefighters were forced to work in this new unit and cars were painted green since the brigade belonged to the police. Personnel increased to 200 people and equipments were augmented by a large number of cars: in 1944, Bydgoszcz Fire Department owned a total of 38 cars and was divided into three sub-units, covering outside areas like Bielawka and the Chemical Plant () in ≈Åƒôgnowo. Polish firefighters were persecuted by Nazi authorities, some arrested and deported to concentration camps, where three of them died. At the end of World War II, the Professional Fire Brigade has been evacuated to Wismar on January 21, 1945 in accordance with a decree of German authorities. Out of the 42 cars, only 2 vehicles and a mechanical l adder were returned to Bydgoszcz city. They soon have been stored back to the station at Pomorska street 16. =Post-war era= The Polish professional Fire Brigade of Bydgoszcz resumed its activity on January 25, 1945 under the command of Lieutenant Leo Piechocki. Initially, the situation was very unfavorable, with almost no equipment and manpower. Pomorska street having been partly devastated, the fire station has been temporally located in the Hotel Ratuszowy at D≈Çuga street 37. Part of reinforcement came from Nak≈Ço nad NoteciƒÖ personnel, who donated one of their fire trucks, which proved to be extremely useful: in 1945 alone, firefighters extinguished 118 fires in Bydgoszcz city. Another part of the equipment were coming from vehicles abandoned by Germans, partially submerged on Vistula banks. Firefighters took the oversight of fire hydrants and public fire signaling network. Firefighters worked on the rebuilt of the damaged fire station at Pomorska street, to set up training for new volunteers. A law passed on February 1950 regarding fire protection established national professional bodies for fire protection under the command of a Fire Brigades Headquarters - . In the 1970s, Professional firefighters started to protect the city with three shifts (24/48 hours) from both their headquarters in Pomorska street and in the district of Fordon. The duty was performed by 181 officers and 25 employees of the Headquarters of the Regional Fire Service, overlooking the neighboring municipalities of Bydgoszcz. An August 1991 Law on Fire Protection created the Rescue Unit No. 1 (). The first commander of JRG No. 1 on January 1, 1992, Cpt Peter Kempka. In 1995, has been established in JRG1 a Special Water and Rescue Unit ). Current situation Currently JRG1 in Bydgoszcz employs 67 firefighters and command officers. In 2014, the unit had recorded 1169 operational events: 346 fires, 706 local threats and 117 false alarms. In addition it carried out 132 interventions to the benefit of JRG.

Built of many parts between about 1865 and 1925, it is one of the largest and most architecturally distinctive 19th- century mill complexes in the state, and was a major regional employer for many years. Now redeveloped into a variety of commercial and industrial uses, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The Holden‚ÄìLeonard Mill is located northwest of downtown Bennington, on the eastern bank of the Walloomsac River, bounded by Holden and Leonard Streets to the north and south, and Benmont Avenue to the east. The complex includes 28 buildings, many of them connected into a single large structure. The dominant feature of the complex is the so-called \\"Big Mill\\", also known as Building 5, which was the main structure built when the mill was founded in 1865. It is a large 4-1/2 story brick structure, wide and deep, with a six-stage tower projecting from its center. It is topped by an octagonal louvered belfry and concave flared roof. The building's basement houses a part of the original penstock that was used to regulate the water that powered the mill's machinery. Textile development began in Bennington on an industrial scale after the railroad arrived in the early 1850s, with the production of knitwear. The Big Mill was built in 1865 by Seth Hunt and Philip Tillinghast. They produced paisley women's shawls, a product that turned out to not be popular. In 1875, the building was taken over by the Bennington Woolen Company, which produced material for overcoats. Under its aegis and that of successive owners, the plant was significantly enlarged. Its greatest period of growth followed the First World War, during which the facility produced large amounts of cloth for the war effort. By 1920 the Holden‚ÄìLeonard Company was the largest employer in the region, with about 800 workers. The mill closed due to the effects of the Great Depression, and was operated for about 10 years for knit goods manufacturing. It has since seen a variety of smaller-scale uses.

Surf Life Saving Australia describes Sheringa Beach as \\"a relatively popular spot for sightseers, while the local surfers and fishers use the beach\\". History In 1820, Joseph Cummings aged 16 and born in England, and Samuel Harris aged 14 and born in the United States, became only the second westerners to trek through the Eyre Peninsula, following in explorer Edward John Eyre's footsteps, and using a coastal map prepared by Matthew Flinders from his circumnavigation of Australia in 1802. They had left the Fowlers Bay whaling station to walk to civilisation, because of the torrid conditions in which they found themselves. They walked to Point Drummond where a ship was seen, and took them to Port Lincoln. A local magistrate heard their story, and freed them on the condition that they guided a survey party to the region of good farming land they described, at what became Sheringa. He also granted them parcels of land there, that they farmed. In 2019, Steve Woore, a solo trekker, walked their route in 20 days.Solo trekker Steve Woore follows runaway teen whalers' 500km pioneering trek across Eyre Peninsula, Jodie Hamilton and Emma Pedler, ABC News Online, 2019-09-25 The town of Sheringa was surveyed in October 1882. It was initially proclaimed as Holsworthy on 19 April 1883, then revoked and proclaimed as Sheringa on 23 August 1883. Its name is derived from Tjeiringa, a local Aboriginal name for a yam-like root that grew in the area. The former Sheringa Post Office opened on 1 September 1891 and closed on 28 September 1984. The Wesleyan Methodist church granted permission to construct a church building at Sheringa at its district meeting in 1886. In 1898, the town consisted \\"...of a temperance hotel, a general store, and blacksmith's shop under one roof, and a public building, which is used as a Church, a school, and a dancing-room.\\" St. John's Anglican Church opened in 1910. The historic Washing Pool, a former sheep wash located near Sheringa, is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register. Washing pools were used before 1870 to wash sheep prior to shearing. This wash pond was built in the 1840s and used by several adjacent sheep runs to clean the sheep before shearing. After about 1870, fleece did not need to be cleaned by the farmers before sale, as manufacturers could produce lanolin as a by-product of cleaning the fleece themselves. \\"Nowhere Else\\", a former pastoral property that has attracted attention for its unusual name, and which remains on local road signs, lies within the modern locality of Sheringa. 10 most ridiculous Australian place names .

The absolute disparity is the angle between visual lines that intersect at a given point. The relative disparity is the difference between the absolute disparity of 2 points. The Vieth‚ÄìM√ºller circle, or horizontal geometrical horopter, is the set of points that have 0-relative disparity to fixation (thus the same absolute disparity as fixation). Geometrically this is a circle passing through the nodal point of the 2 eyes and through fixation. The empirical horopter, measured according to a given criterion such as identical visual directions in the 2 eyes, does not fall on the geometrical horopter. It is concave as short fixation distances, flat at the abathic distance and then convex. The Hering‚ÄìHillebrand deviation describes the mismatch between the theoretical and empirical horopter. The horopter is the set of points that projects at the same location in the two retinae (i.e. that have the same visual direction). Geometrically the horopter is a circle passing through the nodal point of the two eyes and through the fixation point. This is known as the horizontal geometrical horopter, or as the Vieth‚ÄìM√ºller circle. This is the set of points that correspond geometrically to the intersection between visual lines at identical eccentricities. There is also a vertical horopter which the a straight line on the sagittal plane and passing through the intersection between the sagittal plane and the Vieth‚ÄìM√ºller circle (typically fixation if the observer fixates straight ahead, but not necessarily). An empirical horopter can be defined following different criteria. Following Hering, it is usually meant by empirical horopter the equal visual direction horopter. That is the set of points that appear to have the same visual direction in both eyes. But the horopter can also be defined as the center of the Panum's fusional area, the apparent fronto-parallel plane or the equal distance from fixation. All these empirical horopters are in fact corresponding, empirically, to the equal visual direction horopter. The Hering‚ÄìHillebrand deviation describes the fact that the empirical horopter does not fall on the geometrical horopter. This was observed by Hering and Hillebrand at the same time, as well as Helmholtz for the vertical horopter. At short fixation distances, the empirical horopter is a concave parabola flatter that a circle. At some given distance, called the abathic distance, the empirical horopter becomes a straight line, thus matching the apparent fronto-parallel plane. Finally for fixation distances farther than the abathic distance the empirical horopter is a convex parabola. The origin of the Hering‚ÄìHilebrand deviation is still unclear. It was originally thought to reflect a compromise between the Vieth‚ÄìM√ºller circle and fronto-parallel plane. But this is true only for short fixation distances where the empirical horopter is intermediate between these two set of points. More recently natural images analyses suggested that the shape of the empirical horopter might match natural images statistics.

It is the town's oldest brick residence, built in 1807 for a pair of prominent local merchants. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The Auld-McCobb House is set on a rise overlooking downtown Boothbay Harbor, near the center of a triangular block formed by Oak Street, McClintock Street, and Townsend Avenue. It is a large double-pile two story brick structure, with a hip roof and a rubblestone foundation. Its front facade faces roughly west, and is six bays wide. The bays are symmetrically arranged, with two entrances in the center bays, with simple surrounds. Ground-floor windows are twelve-over-twelve sash, and second-floor windows are twelve-over-eight sash, all set in rectangular openings with similar simple trim. The house was built in 1807 for Jacob Auld and Joseph McCobb, two prominent local merchants. The two were engaged in a business partnership that included fishing, shipbuilding, and general mercantile pursuits, and were a dominant force in the local economy in the first quarter of the 19th century. McCobb married Auld's sister in 1807, and it is thought that this is what occasioned the house's construction. The builder is traditionally identified as John Leishman, Jr., although there is no significant documentation to substantiate this. The house is out of scale for other surviving construction of the period in the town, and the use of brick was also quite unusual.

It is now being restored Qadad (, qad√¢d, k â√∞a√∞) or qudad is a waterproof plaster surface, made of a lime plaster treated with slaked lime and oils and fats. The technique is over a thousand years old, see Great Mosque of Sana'a with the remains of this early plaster still seen on the standing sluices of the ancient Marib Dam. Volcanic ash, pumice, scoria (), in the Yemeni dialect, or other crushed volcanic aggregate are often used as pozzolanic agents, reminiscent of ancient Roman lime plaster which incorporated pozzolanic volcanic ash. Due to the slowness of some of the chemical reactions, qadad mortar can take over a hundred days to prepare, from quarrying of raw materials to the beginning of application to the building. It can also take over a year to set fully. In 2004, a documentary film Qudad, Re-inventing a Tradition was made by the filmmaker Caterina Borelli. It documents the restoration of the Amiriya Complex, which was awarded the Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 2007. Old method of preparation After collecting blocks of lime stone, they were fired in a kiln for 4 days, after which the fire and baked lime were extinguished with water, and allowed to cool for 2-3 days more. The baked lime (Arabic: n≈´reh) was then crushed and mixed with soft, black volcanic cinders known as scoria (Arabic: shƒÅsh), a pumice having the consistency of gravel. The scoria and lime were pounded with a stone to break them down into finer particles and thoroughly mixed together without water (the two ingredients being mixed together in a ratio of two parts of aggregate to one part of lime),Selma Al- Radi, \\"Qud√¢d The Traditional Yemeni Plaster,\\" Yemen Update, Bulletin of the American Institute for Yemeni Studies (AIYS), no. 34 (1994):6-13 and then allowed to rest 3-4 days until settled. Afterwards, the two elements were mixed together with water (usually 1 volume of water to 3 volumes of lime/aggregate), during which time the batch is continuously agitated in a tedious process known as slaking and which required many long hours of manual labour (as much as 4-5 weeks), before a finer lime water solution was added thereto for 1-2 months so as to convert it to a paste. The more that it was pounded with a long shovel or wooden paddle, the more the qadad became adhesive. With the now ready mixture of lime and volcanic cinders, they would apply three-layers of qadad-plaster to the walls of cisterns to make them impermeable; the first layer having the largest particles of volcanic cinders (scoria) and the least amount of lime was applied to rough stone, the plaster being added to a thickness of about two inches. They took a sharp-edged stone and, for several days, pounded and rubbed the first layer of qadad firmly onto the wall, all the while sprinkling it with lime-water to keep it wet. The second layer was applied after fully working the first layer by beating. The first process was repeated, this time the wall being plastered with a mixture of qadad containing smaller particles of volcanic cinders and more lime. A sharp-edged stone was again used to pound the qadad firmly onto the wall, all the while sprinkling it with lime-water to keep it wet. Finally, the third layer was applied containing the smallest particles of volcanic cinders and the largest quantity of lime and worked with a sharp-edged stone (one part aggregate to two parts lime, and pounded to a fine paste), and lime-water spattered on the wall to maintain its wetness. After the final application, the wall was treated with a very finely-ground consistency of qadad which was allowed to dry, and when dried, an application of animal fat (suet) was then smeared on the wall for smoothing and burnishing. The end result is that of a wall that is as hard as smooth-marble with beating. (Hypertraditions: Tenth International Conference, December 15-18, 2006 - Bangkok, Thailand). Dr. Selma Al-Radi relates that in her restoration of the Amiriya Madrasa in Rada'a, the nearly 500-year old existing qadad was so strong that they had to use a sledgehammer to break it apart. According to archaeologist Selma Al- Radi, qadad can only be used as a plaster on buildings constructed of stone and baked brick, but it will not adhere to mudbrick, cement blocks or concrete. In Yemen, where it was traditionally made with two basic ingredients, baked lime and volcanic scoria, other countries have traditionally made-use of fine riverbed sand or pebbles instead of scoria, and which were mixed together with lime for use as a common mortar, or to be used as an impervious wall plaster. Usage In Sana'a of the early 20th-century, qadad-plaster was used to line pools, reservoirs, and cesspits, and to make them impermeable. Often its use extended unto the main kitchen room and to gutters and sinks, wherever water was likely to be used extensively (see also tadelakt). The walls of store-rooms where grain was kept and which required being impervious to water were also frequently painted-over with qadad, and which gave to the rooms an appearance of being painted with oil-paint. Carl Rathjens who visited Yemen in the first-half of the 20th-century mentions seeing in Sana'a \\"the houses of well-to-do people\\" where the entrance halls were often painted with qadad up to a certain height. The interior walls of public baths were sometimes brick, sometimes stone. If brick, they were protected with a thick layer of hard gypsum plaster which were then oil- painted. In Islamic architecture, different consistencies of qadad were made for different usages: domes, flat ceilings, vertical walls and decorations in the geometric interlace.Caterina Borelli, Qudad - Reinventing a Tradition (documentary) See also * Limepit (old technique used in calcining limestone) * Lime plaster * Plasterwork * Pozzolan * Tadelakt References External links * Caterina Borelli, , 2012, A Documentary on the renovation of the ‚ÄòAmiryia Madrasa and Mosque in Rada, Yemen, using the ancient waterproofing technique with qudad.

It is a -story wood-frame structure, with a side-gable roof, central chimney, clapboard siding, and a granite block foundation. A long single-story ell extends to the rear. The main facade is five bays wide, with a central entrance that is framed by sidelight windows and pilasters, with an elliptical fanlight above. The southeast side has a secondary entrance which features sidelight windows and a Federal period entablature. The interior follows a typical early Federal period central chimney plan, with the main stairway in front of the chimney, with the parlor to the left, dining room to the right, and a now-modernized kitchen extending across the rear. A second staircase is located next to the side entrance. Woodwork on the interior is a mix of Greek Revival and Federal styles, with a particularly fine fireplace mantel surround in the parlor. The house is presumed to have been built about 1785, when Cushing Prince (1745‚Äì1827) acquired more than of land here from his father. He lived in this house with his wife, Hannah (1752‚Äì1843).

Later that year, the court ruled in favor of ACS, fining Sci- Hub $4,800,000 in damages.United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Alexandria Division, American Chemical Society vs. Sci- Hub d/b/a www.Sci-Hub.cc, John Does 1‚Äì99, Civil Action No, 1:17cv0726 (LMB/JFA), Document 22, Filed Sept. 28, 2017, pp. 1‚Äì16. In December 2019, the Washington Post reported that Elbakyan was under investigation by the US Justice Department. Views and controversies Elbakyan has stated that she is inspired by communist ideals, although she does not consider herself a strict Marxist. She has stated that she supports a strong state which can stand up to the Western world, and that she does not want \\"the scientists of Russia and of my native Kazakhstan to share the fates of the scientists of Iraq, Libya, and Syria, that were 'helped' by the USA to become more democratic.\\" In particular, Elbakyan is strongly critical of the former Dynasty Foundation and its associated figures, believing that the foundation was politicized, tied to Russia's liberal opposition, and fit the legal definition of a \\"foreign agent\\"; Dynasty's founder, in her opinion, financed those researchers whose political views agreed with its own. Elbakyan states that after she began to investigate the foundation's activities and published her findings online, she became the target of a cyberharassment campaign by Dynasty's supporters. In 2017, a species of parasitoid wasps discovered by Russian and Mexican entomologists was named after Elbakyan (Idiogramma elbakyanae). Elbakyan was offended by this, writing, \\"If you analyse the situation with scientific publications, the real parasites are scientific publishers, and Sci-Hub, on the contrary, fights for equal access to scientific information.\\" Following this event, and in the context of her long- running tense relations with the liberal, pro-Western wing of the Russian scientific community, she blocked access to Sci-Hub for users from the Russian Federation. Sci-Hub access was later restored to Russia and Elbakyan said in an interview that many fans contacted her and convinced her \\"that the opinion of the so-called 'science popularizers' who attacked me on the Internet cannot be considered the opinion of the scientific community.\\" The Russian entomologist responsible for naming the wasp stated that he supports Sci-Hub, and that in any event, the naming was not an insult, in particular because parasitoids are closer to predators than to parasites. Elbakyan is a strong supporter of the Open Access movement and claims that Sci-Hub's mission falls perfectly in line with the movement. She argues that websites like Sci-Hub are part of the goal Open Access proponents are striving towards. Elbakyan believes that via this Open Access movement, citizens can become more informed. In 2018, Elbakyan asked supporters of Sci-Hub to join their local Pirate Party in order to fight for copyright laws to be changed. In December 2019, it was reported that the United States Department of Justice is investigating Elbakyan for suspected ties to Russia's military intelligence arm, the GRU, to steal U.S. military secrets from defense contractors. Elbakyan has denied this, saying that Sci-Hub \\"is not in any way directly affiliated with Russian or some other country's intelligence,\\" but noting that \\"of course, there could be some indirect help. The same as with donations, anyone can send them; they are completely anonymous, so I do not know who exactly is donating to Sci-Hub.\\"  Works   See also * Peter Sunde * Library Genesis * Open Access * ICanHazPDF References Further reading *  External links   Engineuring ‚Äì Elbakyan's blog Category:1988 births Category:21st-century women scientists Category:Copyright activists Category:Internet activists Category:Kazakhstani computer programmers Category:Kazakhstani transhumanists Category:Living people Category:Open content activists Category:Kazakhstani women computer scientists Category:Kazakhstani neuroscientists Category:Kazakhstani women neuroscientists Category:Kazakhstani people of Armenian descent Category:Computer security specialists Category:Kazakhstani activists ","title":"Alexandra Elbakyan"},{"id":"49416369","text":"Frozen Synapse 2 is a turn-based tactics video game developed by Mode 7 Games. It is a sequel to the 2011 video game Frozen Synapse. The game was announced in February 2016 for Linux, macOS, and Windows. The developers were initially targeting a late 2016 release, but the game eventually shipped on September 13, 2018 for Windows only.  Gameplay  = Single player modes =  City Game  This is the main story mode. The city map and buildings are randomly generated, and for story purposes some buildings include the same features in every playthrough, with the only difference being unit placement and the position of additional props, such as trees. The player can make alliances with other factions and take contracts from them. For example, some factions may ask you to help them in battle or deliver something. The player can buy additional units in the mercenary market and put them into customizable squads. The main objective of story is to stop the terrorist organization Sonata.  Tutorials  The tutorials section teaches the game basics, and includes tutorial videos for each aspect of the game mechanics.  Story missions  This game mode only includes the story missions, and does not focus on the factions or resource management in the strategic layer.  Skirmish  Skirmishes are matches against the computer on randomly generated city-themed maps. = Multiplayer modes = Extermination: A randomized match in which the players gain points by eliminating the other team's units. The game ends when one team is entirely defeated or when a round limit is reached. Generation includes the same unit setup for both teams. Bomb defusal: New to Frozen Synapse 2, in this game mode one team has a unit carrying a bomb. The bombing team must plant the bomb at one of two locations before time runs out (by default 16 turns). After the bomb is planted, the defusing team attempts to defuse the bomb within 5 turns while the bombing team protects it. Typical scenario generation gives the bombing team more support units, while the defusing team is given more offensive units. Charge: Two teams each choose a vertically oriented zone on the map, which the attacker must then advance across in 6 turns and hold for 3 seconds. The player who chose the farthest zone becomes the attacking team, while the other player defends. Dispute: Two teams compete to gather packages and deliver them to a dropoff zone in the corner of the map. The winner is the either the last team standing or the team that gathered the most packages when the turn timer ran out. Hostage: In this mode, one player has civilians located in the middle of map, standing in green and yellow zones. In the green zone the player can control their civilians, while in yellow, they become controlled by the computer. To win, the civilian-controlling player must bring at least one civilian to a safe zone before the end of the 12th turn, while the hostage-taking player must kill all civilians to win, but cannot attack civilians that are standing in the green and yellow zones. Secure: Each player chooses a zone that they believe they can defend. The player that chose the bigger zone becomes the defending team and must protect their zone for 6 turns. The defender can choose where their units start in their zone, while the attacker starts at the far edge of the map. If defender holds their zone for 6 turns or defeats all of the attacking units, the defender wins. If the attacker either holds the defender's zone for 3 seconds or defeats all the defenders, then the attacker wins. Upload: Each player has a civilian hacker and attempts to eliminate the opponent's hacker. Every game generates with the same units (a hacker, 2 assault rifles, and 2 shields) for both teams. One turn matches In this challenge category, the player has only one turn (10 realtime seconds) to complete an objective. The opposing team is always controlled by the computer via a premade plan (created by the user that made the map), and other players may compete to earn the most points for a given one-turn map. The objective choices are as follows: Sitting ducks: The attacking team must eliminate civilians that cannot move. Bonus points are awarded for defeating enemy units and protecting the player's own units. Secure: The defending team has one V.I.P. unit that they must protect from the attacking team. Bonus points are awarded for each defeated enemy unit.. Exterminate: The two teams simply compete to defeat as many opposing units as possible.  Sub-options for matches  Dark mode: In this mode, enemy units are only visible when the player's own units have line-of-sight to them. Light mode: In contrast to dark mode, enemy units are always visible in light mode. Timed turns: The players can be given a time limit on how long they have to complete their turn. There is also an option to use a chess clock. Normal generation: In this generation setting, the game creates a map with multiplayer in mind that is suitable for competitive play. City generation: This type of generation creates a large, detailed map like those in city mode. Old school: This generation type creates a map in the same way as the original Frozen Synapse.  Development  In February 2016, Mode 7 games announced a sequel to Frozen Synapse. On the March 10th, 2016, a trailer for the pre-alpha version of the game was released on Mode 7‚Äôs official YouTube channel. On June 3, the developers started releasing a series of development update videos, where the developers showed their progress and answered questions. On December 21, 2017, Mode 7 announced that the game would be delayed to 2018. On September 5, 2018, Mode 7's Youtube channel announced that game would be released on September 13.  Reception  Frozen Synapse 2 received ‚ÄúGenerally favorable reviews‚Äù according to Metacritic, with critics favoring it more than users. Some critics stated that the A.I. is predictable, but still challenging. Ian Boudreau from IGN claimed that the game shines in multiplayer. PC Gamer also praised the game for focusing on player strategy over the randomness-based mechanics that many other strategy games use. Some critics disliked the single-player city mode, stating that as an idea it is interesting, but may be too heavily scripted.

All sites are far away from each other, have different climates, topography, flora and fauna, and no settlements or transportation routes. On the streams of the territory are some of the largest undisturbed spawning sites of the chum and coho salmon. One sector, Yamskogo Island, is home to colonies of sea birds, with a total of up to 6 million individual birds. These include Auklets- crumbs, guillemot, spectacled guillemots, lund, and the horned puffin. The reserve is situated in the Olsky District of Magadan Oblast. Recently, the reserve has experimented with very limited cruise ship visits (under 200 passengers) to one of the islands, and plans are being studied for ways to increase educational eco-tourism in the highly inaccessible area. Topography The largest sector, Cava Chelomdzhinskogo (624,456 hectares), is in the southwest corner of Magadan. It is separated from the Okhotsk Sea by two regional nature reserves (the Kava and Kavinskaya). The second largest sector is Seymchansky Land (117,839 ha) inland along the Colima River, 520 km from the city of Magadan. The third largest sector is the Ola area (103,434 ha) on the Koni Peninsula that extends into the Okhotsk Sea. The fourth sector is Yamskogo plot (38,809 ha), in the southwest of the region, and itself is divided into coastal, floodplain, and island subsections. Climate and ecoregion Magadan is located in the Cherskii-Kolyma mountain tundra ecoregion. This ecoregion covers the mountainous areas of northeast Siberia. It is an ecoregion of extreme cold and extreme aridity. The climate of Magadan is Subarctic climate, without dry season (K√∂ppen climate classification Subartic climate (Dfc)). This climate is characterized by mild summers (only 1-3 months above ) and cold, snowy winters (coldest month below ). Flora and fauna More than half of the reserve territory is coniferous forest, mostly larch (Larix gmelinii). The second most common tree species is the Creeping cedar. Among mammals, the common species are the bank voles, chipmunks, pika, hare, brown bear, fox, sable, ermine, and mink. Ecotourism As a strict nature reserve, the Magadan Reserve is mostly closed to the general public, although scientists and those with 'environmental education' purposes can make arrangements with park management for visits. The reserve does, however, make available to the public the ability to go on eco-tourist excursions on the site, but public visitors must join a group led by a reserve ranger, and must obtain written permits in advance. There is a public visitor's center with nature exhibits at the reserves main office in the city of Magadan.

The facility was originally built in the late 1960s for both surface and waste water, and included a storage lagoon and sewage works ‚Äì the sewage works was replaced by a large waste water treatment facility near Saltend near the banks of the Humber Estuary. The current (2015) facility pumps and stores surface water, discharging into the River Hull. Waste water is pumped to a sewage works near Saltend. Description Waste water treatment in the Bransholme and Kingswood areas of Hull is separated from that of the rest of Hull. Separate surface water and foul water systems drain to the facility at Bransholme. Surface water is discharged into the River Hull, with an intermediate storage lagoon used to store water when river levels are high. Foul water is pumped to the 'Humbercare' sewage works near Saltend. History A sewage works was built adjacent to the east bank of the River Hull in the late 1960s, an ancillary to the construction of the large Bransholme Estate to the east and south. The works was located to the south of the Wawne drain at Roe Bank. A linear mound was constructed to the east, shielding views from the estate. The estate required a new drainage system to be built ‚Äì effluent at the new plant was to discharge into the river. The works also included a water storage lagoon, built to hold water when the level of the river was high.Ordnance Survey 1:10560 1956‚Äì7, 1969 1:2500 1954‚Äì65, 1965‚Äì72 By 1972 the new works was discharging of treated sewage effluent into the river. After the sewage works at Bransholme was closed, with effluent to be pumped to a new large waste water treatment works (Hull WwTW) near the Humber Estuary; the works was part of the ¬£200 million 'Humbercare' sewage scheme built to comply with European standards on sewage disposal. The Humbercare system excluded surface water at Bransholme. In 2007 (see 2007 United Kingdom floods) a surface water pump failed at the pumping station, the failure led to a delay in the Bransholme area being cleared of water after the flood event. The area south-east of the storage lagoon, once in part containing the sewage works was developed as housing after 2007 (Selset Way).Hull City Council, planning applications, Ref.

He is best known for his research into the black history of Western Europe and his 1972 seminal book Black Britannia: A History of Blacks in Britain. Early life and career Scobie was born Vivian Edward George Dalrymple in Roseau, Dominica. He was educated at the Dominica Grammar School. At school, he displayed an aptitude for athletics, eventually representing the national teams in cricket and football. He first went to England during World War II to join the Royal Air Force, where he served as a pilot in Bomber Command, holding the rank of flight lieutenant. After the war Scobie became a correspondent for the Chicago Defender and other Johnson Publishing Company titles with a largely African- American readership. In 1948, Scobie published Checkers, calling itself \\"Britain‚Äôs Premier Negro Magazine\\"; the magazine only lasted five issues, folding in January 1949. By 1960 he joined with Charles I. Ross and Patrick Williams to produce monthly magazine Tropic. Published in London, the magazine announced that it intended to be \\"the voice of 250,000 coloured people in Britain\\", aligning itself with \\"coloured people everywhere in their struggle for Independence. In their fight to live with dignity and freedom\\". In addition to covering politics and current affairs in Britain, Africa and the Caribbean the magazine published short stories by the likes of Samuel Selvon, Jan Carew and included among its contributors George Lamming and Donald Hinds. Tropic ceased publication at the end of 1960. In September 1961 Scobie launched Flamingo as editor, a monthly London-based magazine aimed at Black people in Britain and internationally, focusing on glamour, culture, sex advice and international politics, it was one of the first magazines to target Britain's African-Caribbean community. Flamingo was part-funded by the British Secret Intelligence Service (MI6), through founder Peter Hornsby and publisher Chalton Publishing, who along with the CIA wanted to support left-leaning writers and politicians who would oppose communism. It is unclear if Scobie was aware of this funding. The second issue claimed to have sold 20,000 copies in Britain and 15,000 in America. By 1964 Flamingo political articles had become more serious, and were similar to media releases from the British Foreign Office's semi-secret Information Research Department. Flamingo closed in May 1965. His first book Black Britannia: The History of Blacks in Britain published in 1972, bought him \\"international acclaim\\". Black Britannia: The History of Blacks in Britain is the first book-length history of African presence in Britain. At the time of his death in 1996, Scobie was Professor Emeritus of History in the Black Studies Department at City College of New York. In 1998, Scobie was featured on a commemorative postage stamp, which featured portraits of five notable Dominicans who served in the RAF during World War II, to mark the 80th anniversary of the Royal Air Force.

The work on this manuscript was started in 1426 at the order of Baysonghor Mirza, the Timurid prince, and was completed on 1430, four years later. It is now in the museum of Golestan Palace, Iran, and regarded as a key masterpiece of the Persian miniature. According to the preface, apparently written by Baysonghor himself for this volume, and usually copied in later manuscripts,Titley, 54 it is not a copy of a previous manuscript, it is prepared by comparing several older manuscripts. But the purpose of this comparison was not to achieve greater fidelity to Ferdowsi's original Shahnameh, it was to modernize the language of the text and to add verses to it. Because of this, the Baysonghor Shahnameh is one of the most voluminous manuscripts of Shahnameh, consisting of some 58,000 verses (today's version of Shahnameh consists of about 50,000 verses). The value of this manuscript is not because of its text, but on its artistry. Written in Nasta ølƒ´q script, it has 346 pages and 21 miniatures of the Herat School and is one of the most important works in this school. Beside the Demotte Shahnameh and the Shahnameh of Shah Tahmasp, the Baysonghor Shahnameh is one of the most important and famous manuscripts of the Shahnameh. It is included in UNESCO's Memory of the World Register of cultural heritage items. Miniatures It is likely that Baysonghor chose the 21 subjects for the miniatures himself; several are unusual choices for illustrations, and on subjects relevant to a prince impatient to inherit (which he never did). The frontispiece shows a prince who was probably a portrait of Baysonghor. At about 38 x 26 cm, the page size was unusually large for the period, and several miniatures fill the whole page, with the frontispiece across two pages; in both these respects, the manuscript shows the direction later royal commissions would take.

He began producing at the age of twelve, making psychedelic trance music, which heavily influenced his sonic palette. His production as a part of Sad Boys has been well received. Outside of his role in Sad Boys, he has released an extended play Beautiful, Wonderful, and has acted as a producer for several acts including Halsey and Deniro Farrar. He has also remixed several songs for other artists such as Jacques Greene, Kacy Hill, and Tinashe. These remixes have also garnered a positive critical response from publications including Pigeons & Planes and The Fader. Personal life Berlander is part of a mixed race family, since his Nigerian grandfather met his grandmother, who was a Swede, in London. He said that his identity of his mixed race made him feel like he was \\"on this little island\\". Following his parents' divorce when he was ten, his dad and his older sister moved to a Stockholm suburb different to where he was living at the time. Berlander, as well as the other members of the Sad Boys group, have described living in Stockholm as \\"boring\\" and \\"miserable\\". While he has resided in the city for most of his life, Berlander had once lived in a small urban area called Gnesta, which he opined to be a Swedish equivalent to Kentucky: \\"Stupid people and alcohol problems, I don't know. It sucks of over there. It's so boring.\\" He said that his mother \\"liked to spoil me.\\" He did not do well in school, dropping out to pursue a career in music, and his father has always been mixed on this decision; he had always encouraged him to \\"just go to school and be a good person\\", saying that ‚ÄúYou can't make music without a guitar.‚Äù However, Berlander said in a 2014 interview that his dad had been getting a little more supportive and into what he had been doing so far. He also claimed in that same interview that he is sober, although, he said that he was wanting to try promethazine \\"because it's medicine. But the weeds and the speeds ‚Äì no, not that.\\" Sad Boys Yung Lean in Stockholm in 2013. As Yung Gud described in how he first met Yung Lean, \\"My friend was fucking his friend at the moment. And she introduced him to my friend and me and basically that's how I met him. We'd drank some beer in a park and were like, ‚ÄúWe like the same music, we should do something sometime.‚Äù\\" The two had always thought of creating material together, but the two didn't start doing so until around October 2012 with the track ‚ÄúOreomilkshake\\": \\"I think we were drunk in his basement and we made ‚ÄúOreomilkshake.‚Äù Then I just made some beats when I had the time.\\" He explained how the name of Sad Boys came about: \\"I was going to buy some clothes at a store with Yung Sherman, and it was closed, and I got sad, and basically that's that.\\" As for the stage name Yung Gud, Berlander came up with simply the word Gud, then decided to change it into Yung Gud to make it funnier, which he described as \\"a stupid decision.\\" While he does hope to collaborate with other artists, he said in 2014 that he has been very much focused with his work for Sad Boys and his solo material. Yung Gud's production for Yung Lean's works has garnered favorable responses from critics, with some spotlighting how it complements Lean's rapping, and according to a journalist, his \\"lush\\" and \\"melodic\\" beats were a major part of the listeners' appeal towards Lean. Yung Gud has admitted to liking Yung Lean, and that he has gotten more \\"secure\\" as a rapper as time goes on. He thinks that \\"He makes people feel some type of way\\". He disagrees with Lean's common comparison to Lil B, although he does comprehend why this comparison is made. However, he has also said that \\"there is always something wrong about him. It's like something wrong about the whole Sad Boys thing. People get really, really angry or really happy when they hear it. That's his main attraction. He's going to make people feel some type of way.\\" While touring with the Sad Boys during the popularity of Yung Lean's album Unknown Memory, Berlander began suffering from abuse from using stimulants like cocaine, as well as the benzodiazepine anxiety medication xanax as other members of the group did. This led to him not able to \\"recognize [himself] anymore\\".Millard, Drew (2 August 2016). \\"Gud Wants to Make Music More Real And Less Internet\\". Thump. Vice Media. Retrieved 4 September 2016. As a result, he decided to return to Sweden to spend time with his family. Solo career A Complex magazine critic made note of the lack of popularity of Yung Gud's career outside of Sad Boys, writing that \\"There‚Äôs no reason this should be on the low, though, because the works are fire.\\" Yung Gud made a track called \\"Crushed\\", a song that's part of a genre he made up called \\"crushcore\\". This was \\"So people won‚Äôt call it post-witchhouse-chill-step or dub-core with emo influences. Or they won‚Äôt say, ‚ÄúThis track is cool, but can you make it more based?‚Äù It's like, ‚ÄúThis is crushcore. Fuck off.‚Äù\\" On 5 June 2014, Yung Gud announced that he had finished his debut extended play the past week, and had been looking for a label to release it: \\"I don't want to keep people waiting anymore. I don't want to keep myself waiting.\\" He had also stated he was thinking of naming the record either Wonderful or Beautiful. The now-titled four-track Wonderful, Beautiful was available for streaming worldwide via The Fader on 24 November 2014. The Sky Team label released it in European stores that same day, and to markets in the United States on 25 November. As Yung Gud described, \\"I've always wanted to make a product of some sort. So with this EP, I'm finally selling a specific sound and look to the people that have been supporting my music for the past year and a half.\\" Beautiful, Wonderful received a positive review from Andrew Ryce of Resident Advisor, who scored the release a 3.5 out of five: \\"His solo tracks have a stargazing majesty to them, but the melodies are nailed down with grandiose percussion that makes it feel almost symphonic.\\" The EP was promoted with a ten-day European tour lasting from 12‚Äì22 November. On 22 June 2016, Vice Media's electronic music channel Thump premiered \\"Body Horror,\\" Yung Gud's first original track in two years. It, according to Thump, is an \\"obfuscated, hazy R&B; through a grab bag of blemishing distortion techniques, decorating it with light discordance and snippets of ravey synth patches for texture.

Yung Gud collaborated with S-Type of the LuckyMe record label for the song \\"Fire\\", which was released on The Fader on 9 February 2015 as a single off S-Type's EP SV8. \\"Fire\\" was also the opener for Astrid Anderson's FW15 show, which S-Type soundtracked for. The two talked about making a track together when they first met each other at one of the Sad Boys concerts, and Gud made some drum parts and sent them to S-Type for him to \\"do my thing with\\" two weeks later. Production credits have included rapper Deniro Farrar's single \\"World On My Shoulders 3.0\\", which premiered on 27 April 2015, \\"Blue Prada\\" by Prada Mane and additional production on \\"Strange Love\\", a track by singer Halsey off the deluxe edition of her debut album Badlands. Remixes Gud has done remix work for songs by artists including Tinashe. In 2014, Yung Gud released two remixes of \\"No Excuse\\", a track by Canadian producer Jacques Greene. On 30 May 2014, The Fader premiered the recut that was a part of a remix extended play for Greene's three-track record Phantom Vibrate. The magazine described it as a \\"ecstatically pattering\\" rework of the song that alleviates \\"the jagged turns and gun shot sounds of the original to reveal its lushest sonic innards.\\" Joe Price, writing for Complex magazine's website Pigeons & Planes, said that with this remix, Yung Gud had \\"proven once again that he has legs beyond what many coin as ‚Äúmeme rap.‚Äù\\" Later on, Yung Gud did a much more harsh-sounding \\"VIP\\" remix of the track, which starts off alike to Yung Gud's first remix, and then it dives \\"into a deep chasm of rumbling bass complete with a hammering rhythm that rarely lets up\\", Price wrote. It was issued on 20 December, garnering 800,000 plays in eighteen days on SoundCloud. Yung Gud's \\"spacey and dreamy\\" re-edit for \\"2 On\\" by Tinashe, which came out on 6 September 2014, was reviewed by a Complex magazine critic who highlighted its \\"interesting drum work\\" and Tinashe's vocal performance fitting with the beat. In 2015, Yung Gud released two remixes. On 28 June, Yung Gud did a remix of rapper Meek Mill's track \\"Monster\\". Constant Gardner of Pigeons & Planes made note of the re-cut's \\"chest-shaking\\" bass, a layer of \\"icy\\" synth lines and \\"twinkling\\" glockenspiel-style sounds, and also said that \\"This is Meek Mill taken from the streets of Philly to his throne in a sparkling Arctic ice palace, and it‚Äôs awesome.\\" Yung Gud remixed Kacy Hill's \\"Foreign Fields\\", which the re-edit was released on 30 September as a promotional single of her debut EP Bloo. A Pigeons & Planes journalist wrote that Yung Gud's reworking turns the original song \\"into a grand experience\\", opining that it takes it into \\"new heights with heavier basslines and haunting production.\\" A Stuff.co.nz critic compared it to Katy Perry's track \\"Dark Horse\\" due to its nature sound effects and a \\"marching band drum beat\\". Artistry and influences Berlander has described his influences of music as generally \\"left-field\\". He and his sister first listened to nu metal bands like Slipknot and Korn since he was eight or nine years old. He then got into electronic music and was producing psychedelic trance since he was twelve, which the genre has always been an influence for his works along with other styles of music involving ambient. However, he said in a 2014 interview that he didn't start listening to hip hop until a couple of years before. He first used a Sony Ericsson music application, and once he was bought an expensive computer by his mother, he started \\"really making shit\\" with the program GarageBand before moving on to Fruity Loops and other programs, and now uses Ableton Live.

He also served for several years as head of the Tuskegee Institute's Department of Photography. Early life Prentice Herman Polk was born on November 25, 1898, in Bessemer, Alabama,Washington, Anthony, \\"Polk, Prentice Herman (1898-1985)\\", The Black Past. one of four children of Jacob Prentice Polk and Christine Romelia Ward. Originally named Herman Polk, he adopted his father's given name after his death and was known as P. H. In 1916, he enrolled at the Tuskegee Institute intending to become a painter. His plans changed when he heard photographer C. M. Battey‚Äîwho headed Tuskegee's Photography Department from 1916 to 1927‚Äîtalk about the potential of that field and encourage interested students to come see him. After speaking with Battey, Polk went on to study photography with him by correspondence. In 1924, Polk moved to Chicago, Illinois, where he furthered his studies with a white photographer, Fred A. Jensen. Polk married Margaret Blanche Thompson in Chicago in 1926; they had a son. Photography career Polk returned to Tuskegee in 1927 to open his own studio in his home in the town. His mentor Battey died that same year, and the following year Polk joined the school's faculty. In 1933, he took over as head of the Photography Department, remaining in that capacity until 1938. He left for a year in an attempt to open a branch of his photography studio in Atlanta, GA, before returning to Tuskegee to serve as the college's official photographer for four decades. He documented famous visitors such as Paul Robeson and Langston Hughes and events such as the Civil Rights Movement on campus. At the same time, he continued to run his own studio in town. Shot in black and white, Polk's subjects ranged from famous African Americans such as George Washington Carver to working-class and poor Alabamians. One series, \\"Old Characters\\", focused on documenting ex-slaves from Macon County. Like Battey, Polk strove to portray his sitters with dignity and sensitivity. Unlike Battey‚Äîwho preferred soft-focus shots and idealizing poses‚ÄîPolk developed a style in which sharp details and strong lighting showcased his subjects' individuality. His approach is evident in a comment he made about a 1932 photograph from the \\"Old Characters\\" series entitled The Boss: :\\"Portrayed in her own matter-of-factness: confident, hard working, adventuresome, assertive and stern. The pose, at an angle, and her expression, authoritative and firm, are not the result of my usual tactics to encourage a response. She wears her own clothes. She is not cloaked in victimization. She is not pitiful; therefore, she is not portrayed in pitiful surroundings. She is not helpless, and she is not cute.\\" In his early work, Polk used a Kodak box camera with a Graphex lens. Critics have commented on his technical mastery of the medium despite not always having the best equipment. One of Polk's most influential images was a 1941 photograph of First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt in a plane with pilot Charles Anderson, who was the Tuskegee Institute's chief flight instructor. The photograph was used to promote the newly established Tuskegee Airmen \\"experiment\\" that would ultimately train some 450 black pilots for deployment in World War II as the Tuskegee Airmen. Polk's photographs have been exhibited at the Corcoran Gallery (Washington, DC), the Museum of Natural History (New York, NY), the Studio Museum in Harlem (NY), and a range of galleries and other institutions. In 1980 he was awarded the Black Photographer‚Äôs Annual Testimonial Award, and the following year he won a National Endowment for the Arts fellowship. Polk retired from Tuskegee in the early 1980s and died in Tallassee, AL, on December 29, 1984. Publications on Polk's work *Polk, P.H. P.H. Polk‚ÄîA Portfolio of Eleven Original Photographs.

He was the last presbyterian minister at Annetwell Street, his successors being from England and identified as \\"Independents\\" or, as the nineteenth century wore on, \\"Congregationalists\\". Beyond Carlisle he became noteworthy as an eminent theologian and as a Hebrew scholar. Life George Bennet was born at Dysart, a trading port across the Firth of Forth from Edinburgh. Sources give his birth year variously as 1750 or 1751 (or, less plausibly,His age at ordination in 1791 is given as 41 and his age at death is given in several sources cited herein as 84. 1760). He received his university education at the University of St Andrews, and was licensed by the presbytery at Dunkeld on 3 September 1782. He was ordained as minister of Lady Glenorchy's Chapel in Annetwell Street at Carlisle on 1 June 1791. In 1800, Bennet established a school at Fisher Street in Carlisle, advertising a wide curriculum that incorporated English (grammar and composition), Arithmetic, Book-keeping, Geography, Greek and Latin. Another source states that during his time in Carlisle he \\"passed a great portion of his life\\" studying Hebrew, becoming deeply familiar with rabbinical scholarship which, he believed, was sometimes better able than Christian sources to \\"catch the rays of light\\" emanating from the Bible. He was also a prodigious letter writer, engaging in scholarly exchanges with contemporary theologians including Isaac Milner, the eccentric and endlessly curious Dean of Carlisle and his brother, the church historian Joseph Milner. Other correspondents included Archdeacon William Paley, Archdeacon Robert Markham, Archdeacon Robert Nares, Bishop Beilby Porteus and Bishop Samuel Horsley. The scholarly content of Bennet's letters must have been substantive, since the analyses and critiques that he expressed found their way across the Atlantic, and in 1802 George Bennet was the recipient of an honorary Doctorate of Divinity from Harvard College in Massachusetts. Copious letter writing may or may not have kept Bennet from his pastoral duties at the Annetwell Street chapel. Sources are not entirely consistent on the point. One (anonymous) source asserts that he was \\"in the truest sense a pastor among his flock: the business of ministry was his pleasure and delight . . . His sermons were conceived in a simple mould, and expressed with characteristic plainness of language\\". Less sympathetic was the commentator who opined that \\"had his spirituality of character borne any proportion to his literary attainments, his ministry might have been extensively successful; but the chapel became almost deserted, and the things which remained were indeed ready to die\\". Baptismal records indicate at least ten baptisms for every year between 1805 and 1809 which is not consistent with the idea of a congregation deserting in droves. On the other hand, when his successor took over in 1809, only ten names were listed on the congregational membership roll. Then again, by 1807, Bennet had been gone for two years, and it is not unreasonable to expect a two-year interregnum to coincide with a decline in congregation size. Politics across Europe during the 1790s were dominated by the unfolding French Revolution and its aftermath. An insight into Bennet's political stance comes from the lengthy but expressive title of a book he wrote and had published in 1796: \\"A Display of the Spirit and Designs of those who, under pretence of a Reform, aim at the Subversion of the Constitution and Government of this Kingdom. With a Defence of Ecclesiastical Establishments\\". Another substantial book, published at Carlisle in 1800, was entitled, \\"Olam Hanashamoth, or a View of the Intermediate State as it appears in the Records of the Old and New Testaments\\". Living in England at a time of heightened nationalism, Bennet came under pressure from friends to switch his ecclesiastical allegiance to Anglicanism, but he preferred to spend his final decades back in Scotland. His friend Archdeacon Robert Markham had a brother-in-law who was the Earl of Mansfield with an inheritance that included the right to appoint the Minister in charge at the parish of Strathmiglo near Auchtermuchty: Bennet was inducted to the living at Strathmiglo on 24 September 1807. Personal George Bennet married Ann Hutton on 26 October 1791. The marriage produced six or seven recorded children. Six of the children were still alive in 1832.

Bandi was born in 1950 in China to Korean parents who had moved there fleeing the Korean War. Bandi grew up in China before the family moved back to North Korea. In the 1970s, Bandi managed to publish some of his early writing in North Korean publications. After the death of Kim Il-sung in 1994 and the hardship that followed, Bandi lost several people close to him to famine and defections. These developments made Bandi disillusioned with the North Korean system and he started to write dissident literature. The opportunity to publish his dissident writing presented itself when Bandi's friend from Hamhung defected to China. Although the friend could not risk taking the manuscripts with her, she promised that she would find a way to bring them abroad. Several months later, a man previously unknown to Bandi came to see him and passed him a note from the friend, asking Bandi to give the man his manuscripts. With the help of this messenger, Bandi's work made its way to South Korea, where it was published. In North Korea, Bandi is a member of the country's Korean Writers' Alliance and writes for its publications. Bandi still lives in North Korea. Although he has expressed willingness to defect, he could not do so because he has family in the country. Bandi's collection of political poems, The Red Years (), was published in South Korea in January 2018. The English version, translated by Heinz Insu Fenkl, was published by Zed Books in August 2019.https://www.zedbooks.net/shop/book/the-red-years/ The Accusation Bandi's short story collection, The Accusation (), was smuggled out of the country and published in Seoul in May 2014. When a close relative told Bandi that she planned to leave North Korea, Bandi asked her to take along the 750-page manuscript. The relative promised to send it out once she‚Äôd escaped. When she was arrested by Chinese border troops, she was helped by Do Hee-yun, a human rights worker from South Korea. Through her, Do learned about Bandi and the manuscript. In 2013, a Chinese friend recruited by Do eventually smuggled out Bandi‚Äôs manuscript while visiting North Korean relatives. The manuscript was hidden between works on former leaders Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. The poems by Bandi were also smuggled out at the same time that deal with the Kim Jong Il era. The luggage was x-rayed but not hand-searched at the border. Do Hee-youn said: \\"It doesn't deal with political prison camps, or public executions, human rights issues. It shows normal life of North Korea citizens and it is very frightening. This book shows that they live like slaves.\\" South Korean publishers seek to keep Bandi's identity a secret. To protect his identity, they have deliberately added biographical misinformation into his stories and altered names of people and places. All international publishers agree that behind the pseudonym \\"Bandi\\", there is a real author living in North Korea. If this is true, The Accusation is the first North Korean literary work by an author that still lives in North Korea that has been published outside the country. To Hui-un, the leader of a North Korean defectors' NGO, compares him to Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn who smuggled his manuscripts out of the Soviet Union. Heinz Insu Fenkl, a Korean translator and a professor of English and Asian Studies at SUNY New Paltz, commented on the book, \\"His stories reminded me of the Soviet era‚Äîa lot of satirical fiction that was published by samizdat, the underground publishing venues there. The tone of those stories‚Äîthere‚Äôs a kind of pessimism. It‚Äôs like a world view.\\" American journalist Barbara Demick, who has reported on the country for many years, said, \\"I find it hard to believe that this was written by somebody in North Korea\\". She speculated that these stories could be written by a defector. According to her experience, it is hard to recognize the regime‚Äôs internal contradictions for most North Koreans until they have spent a large amount of time outside the country. Lydia Lim, a student of Korean literature at Princeton University, concluded that the stories had indeed been written by an official state writer living in North Korea, based on the assessments of the ‚Äúsomewhat obscure locations‚Äù referenced in the work by several North Korean defectors, and the idiosyncrasies of Bandi‚Äôs word choices. The copyright of the book is owned jointly by Bandi and Happy Unification Road, Do's organization. The latter controls 50% of the royalties. The Accusation, comprising seven stories set in the 1990s around the time of death of Kim Il- sung, is set for publication in English and in many other languages beginning in 2017; rights have been secured by Grove Press in the USA and by Serpent's Tail in the UK and Commonwealth (excluding Canada). In Canada, the book was published by House of Anansi Press. The English edition was translated by British translator Deborah Smith, the co-winner of the Man Booker International Prize in 2016. The original manuscript of The Accusation contains around 200 words that the average South Korean is not familiar with, and Smith's translation was based on the version edited for publication in South Korea. The English version of The Accusation was listed among 75 Notable Translations of 2017 by World Literature Today. According to Do Hee-yun, Bandi knows that the book has been published internationally through listening South Korean radio. Do had also sent someone to meet Bandi, showing him a picture of the book on a mobile. The book has been published in 20 countries. The book has been very well received in the US, according to Morgan Entrekin, the editor of American edition. Do reported in January 2018 that he lost contact with Bandi, but that there was no evidence that Bandi is in danger. The work has been a bestseller in France and South Korea.

History A view of the castle and the sculpture of Abu-l-Qasim Ahmad ibn al-Husayn ibn Qasi, ally of Afonso Henriques A drawing of the castle from the Book of Fortresses by Duarte das Armas The castle and surrounding buildings at the end of the 20th century In 318 B.C., during the sequence of the invasion and sack of Tyre, by Alexander the Great, the Phoenicians founded the Myrtilis or New Tyre.Almeida (1943/1949) The region became an important trading center frequented by Phoenicians and Carthaginians, thanks to the abundance of river and land routes connecting it to the southern portion of the peninsula. Before the invasion of the Iberian Peninsula, it held commercial importance among these civilizations. During the Roman epoch, the settlement was developed, becoming the centre of the mineral extract and agriculture in the Baixo Alentejo region. M√©rtola was encircled by a wall system that paralleled what remains today, but much grander. The Beja road crossed the walls in the north,Torres (1990) and by 44 B.C. Julius Caesar had renamed the town Myrtilis Julia. The first historical reference to this settlement existed in the chronicles of the Swabian bishop, Id√°cio, who narrated an episode dating to 440 AD, and inferred the existence of this fortified site occupied by Swabians and Visigoths. It was destroyed and sacked by barbarian hordes, then Muslim Umayyad Africans, who reconstructed the centre for their own necessities, where the name Myrtilis was shortened to Martula. Ibn Qasi was governor of the Taifa of M√©rtola it is likely that defensive works during his rule (1144-1151) were carried out to the castle. In the middle of the 12th century, the ribat was constructed on the south tower of the dungeon.Gon√ßalves (1981) During the last third of the 12th century, during the Almohad dynasty, the site was repaired and the walls were constructed to encircle the settlement. During that time, the group of castle buildings were constructed, or reconstructed, that includes the semi-cylindrical tower. In 1171, Abu H√°fece, brother of the Emir, ordered the repair and improvements to the fortress tower.Torres (1991) In 1238, during the context of the Reconquista, M√©rtola was conquered by Sancho II, putting an end to centuries of Islamic occupation. Between 1240/1245 and 1316, the settlement became the seat of the Military Order of Santiago. In 1254, D. Paio Peres Correia issued the regions first foral (charter). The master of the Order, Jo√£o Fernandes (from the inscription over the entranceway) that ordered the construction of the keep tower in 1292. In the final decade of the 13th century, or beginning of the 14th century, the dungeons were reconstructed, taking advantage of the older gate and tower of Carocha. This work was supplemented in 1373, by improvements to the dungeons and walls. Following the signing of the Treaty of Mon√ßao in 1386, the military territories of M√©rtola, Noudar, Castelo Mendo and Castelo Melhor returned to the possessions of the Portuguese Crown, in exchange for Oliven√ßa and Tui. This resulted in further improvements in 1404 to the fortifications. In the final of the 15th century, the alcalde's residence was constructed, addorsed to the Keep Tower, resulting in much of the demolition of the northwestern battlements. Yet, work persisted in improving the dungeons and walls, although in a diminished capacity. On 25 February 1510, Nuno Velho authored to the King on the state of the fortifications. In 1512, King D. Manuel issued a regal foral., and the castle was recorded by Duarte de Armas (Book of Fortresses in 1509) On 15 October 1513, there is record of a royal letter to pay Francisco de Anzinho 94,260 reis for furnishing lime for the work on the castle. Until the 18th century, the castle of M√©rtola continued to function as part of the first defensive line along the frontier with Spain, but began to diminish its military-strategic importance over time, before it was ultimately abandoned. Although important in southern Portugal, the village and castle lost most of its importance during the era of Portuguese maritime expeditions and colonization. Most of the sites decline was reflected in general neglect and lack of conservation, so much that by 1758, the location was in semi-ruin and un-garrisoned. Between the 19th and 20th century, M√©rtola's economy was dependent on the exploitation of the mines of Santo Domingo, a major center for cupric pyrite extraction. On 18 August 1943, by decree 32/973 (Di√°rio do Governo, S√©rie 1, 175), the heritage site was classified as a Im√≥vel de Interesse P√∫blico (Property of Public Interest). On 2 February 1969, an earthquake caused damage to the old fortress. On 1 June 1992, the property fell into the administration of the Instituto Portugu√™s do Patrim√≥nio Arquitet√≥nico (Portuguese Institute for Architectural Patrimony), under decree-law 106F/92 (Di√°rio da Rep√∫blica, S√©rie 1A, 126). A revitalization project began in the 20th century saw the site transformed into a village museum with different areas specializing in different areas related to the castle's history: the keep tower was transformed into an observation deck as well as an interpretative centre presenting Roman, Visigothic Nucleus, Christian and Islamic collections that include one of the best collections Portuguese Islamic art (such as pottery, coins, and jewelry). Architecture The main accessway and walls, with the keep tower on the right The remnants of the larger walls that encircled the settlement The Castle of M√©rtola is situated in an urban area on the hilltop, implanted in the rocky landscape bisected by the Guadiana River and the Ribeira de Oeiras. Situated nearby is the former Islamic mosque, transformed into the Church of Nossa Senhora da Assun√ß√£o. The irregular, rectangular fortress includes four towers: the rectangular keep tower at an angle oriented to the north, two square towers to the south; two rectangular towers to the south; two towers aligned to the principal gate in the east; and a rectangular tower, with circular affect. The \\"traitors gate\\" is situated in the northwest wall of the fortifications, following the Keep Tower, protected by barbican. The wall is part of a circuit of battlements, vertical and reinforced by a southwestern tower with large buttress supporting various battlements. The Keep Tower is tall, with soft base and two floors, marked by doorway that opens to staircase addorsed to the southeast walls, consisting of varias friezes along the northwest and marked by machialottans, surmounted by parapets and prismatic merlons and decorated in pyramids. The weapons hall is situated on the first floor, covered with cross-vaulted ceiling. A staircase along the southern wall provides access to the second floor. Alongside the keep tower is a sculpted white marble, relief coat-of-arms of Ant√≥nio Rodrigues Bravo, High-Courier (postal official) of the town. The Carouche Tower, in the southwest, is a cubic wide, with access from the battlements and covered by terrace, broken by door and window. Its interior, is a covered space with hemispheric cupola over pedestals. The towers in the corners flank the main gate, with different volumes (the left is prismatic and the right, semi-circular), that do not extend beyond the height of the battlements. In the courtyard is a covered cistern with vaulted ceiling over three arches. The walls encircling the settlement can still be identifiable, defined as a sub rectangular space along the north-to-south axis, with reinforced walls by rectangular towers: a large segment along the north, while a majority of the walls extend along the south flowing from the Carocha Tower, with a part oriented along the Guadiana. To ancient gates, survived by the Miseric√≥rdia Gate provides access to the river.

It first aired on the FX channel in the United States on June 29, 2010, and was written and directed by the show's creator and star, Louis C.K. Plot Louie, and comedians Nick DiPaolo, Hannibal Buress, Jim Norton, Eddie Brill, and Rick Crom exchange jokes whilst playing a game of poker. Norton tells Brill to stick his seven-card up his mother's anus, but DiPaolo says her anus would be too crammed with penises. Brill says it makes no sense. However, Louie disagrees, saying that she uses a coffee tamper to get them in there. DiPaolo asks Crom, who is a homosexual, what sex is like for him. The conversation leads to Crom telling them about a club called City Jerks, where several homosexual men perform masturbation on each other, which the comedians question him about. Crom tells them he doesn't care what they do in their sexual life and that they are obsessed with his. Louie asks whether he should use the word \\"faggot\\" onstage, Crom says he doesn't care if it is said onstage and tells them that the origin of the word comes from the Middle Ages, when homosexuals where thrown into the kindling and burned alive, thus originating the phrase \\"flaming faggot\\" (although this is disputed). Crom tells them that by using the word, he is reminded of times when he was abused for being homosexual. DiPaolo jokingly calls him a \\"faggot\\" and the men laugh together. In his stand-up set, Louie says he was married from the age of 28 until 42. He says that getting divorced is like leaving a bad time machine that takes 14 years to go forward 14 years. Louie and his wife sign the divorce forms. He tells his brother over dinner he views it positively, because he's now single and gets to find a new partner, but his brother just finds it \\"weird\\" and says he is likely to die alone. Back performing stand-up, Louie says his life is on an exponential decline. In his apartment, he looks at his body in the mirror and extends his middle finger to himself. He looks at old school yearbook photos and finds a girl named he knew named Tammy. In a flashback sequence, a young Louie stares at Tammy. She asks him if he wants her deceased father's watch. Later she offers him alcohol, which he declines, then tells him to \\"whip it out\\". In the present day, Louie realizes he still has the watch and sends her a message on Facebook. He visits her at her home, and she looks noticeably different to what she used to. He tells her about their brief moment together, which she doesn't remember, before they have sex passionately on the floor. Louie says in his stand-up set that the only reasoning he has for not having sex with animals is because he's told not to. He then says it would possibly be rape, but if the animal is aroused, then it is morally acceptable. He claims he would wait only two minutes before having sex with a monkey if he was the last person on the planet. Reception =Ratings= The episode aired immediately after the pilot episode on June 29, 2010 and was watched by 1.11 million people in the United States. =Critical reception= The episode received positive reviews.

The official founding of the group came in the spring of 1981 during the summer tour by Lucio Dalla, when Stadio offered their first two songs, \\"Grande figlio di puttana\\" (big motherfucker) and the energetic \\"Chi te l'ha detto\\" (Who told you that?), respectively on the B and A side of their first single, which came out at the end of that year. The two songs are included in the soundtrack of Carlo Verdone's film Borotalco, along with the song \\"Un fiore per Hal\\" (A flower for Hal), also published on the band's first LP, Stadio, which came out in the spring of 1982 for RCA Records, with the participation of Lucio Dalla, Ron and Jimmy Villotti as guests. \\"Un fiore per Hal\\" is a long suite, sung by Ricky Portera with Lucio Dalla. It was repeated in the song \\"La mattina\\" (included on Q-disc Chiedi chi erano i Beatles ‚Äì Ask who were the Beatles ). They often appeared on backing vocals for Stadio, under the pseudonym of Domenico Sputi. = Development in the 1980s = 1983 saw the release of the band's career-defining single, \\"Acqua e sapone\\" (Soap and water), recorded for the eponymous film by Carlo Verdone. That same year, Stadio was accompanied by Ron, who also recorded the live album Tutti i cuori viaggianti (All traveling hearts) which resulted in the recruitment of rhythm guitarist Marco Bonino, and bassist Claudio Golinelli (a regular contributor to Vasco Rossi) in the place of Marco Nanni who played saxophone and percussion. In 1984, they featured at the Festival di Sanremo with \\"Allo stadio\\" (at the stadium) as the final song. The song was included on the album La faccia delle donne (The face of women), which was released soon after the festival. A few weeks before the festival, during the 1983 album tour, Pezzoli was badly injured in one eye while assembling his drum kit. Massimo Cappa, a young drummer, was asked to replace him. Cappa participated in the Festival and the subsequent television output of the band and toured with Lucio Dalla, who also appeared in the music video \\"Dentro le scarpe\\" (Inside the shoes). \\"Dentro le scarpe\\" became the theme song of the television program L'Orecchiocchio (The Ear-Eye). In 1984, they contributed to the soundtrack of the Luciano Salce film Vediamoci chiaro, featuring the song \\"Ti senti sola\\" (You feel lonely) and Liberatori's original music. They also performed the song \\"Porno in TV\\" written for them by Lucio Dalla. At the end of the same year, thanks to the opportunity offered by the Q-disc support, they released the mini-album Chiedi chi erano i Beatles (Ask who were the Beatles), which includes the title song, one of Stadio's biggest hits. Meanwhile, the band had reinstated Giovanni Pezzoli to play percussion after recovering from his eye injury. The other lyrics were written by Luca Carboni. The song \\"Vorrei\\" (I would) became part of the soundtrack of the Carlo Verdone film I due carabinieri (The two carabinieri ), along with \\"Ba... ba... ballando\\" (Da... da... dancing) and \\"La mattina\\" (The morning), both appearing on the Q-disc. In the song \\"Vedovo Armando e signora\\" (Widowed Armando and Mrs), Lucio Dalla features as a backing vocalist. This mini-album was the last with the original lineup. In December 1985, after several live television appearances with Lucio Dalla to present the album Bugie (Lies), Fabio Liberatori, tired of his life on the road, decided to leave the group to pursue a career as a music producer. He went on to work with Paola Turci, Ivan Graziani and Mario Castelnuovo, and especially with his friend, movie soundtrack composer Carlo Verdone. He was replaced in concerts by Neapolitan keyboardist Aldo Fedele. Liberatori later returned to work with the group on two albums in the 1990s: Di volpi, di vizi e di virt√π (About foxes, about vices, about virtues) and Dammi 5 minuti (Give me 5 minutes). In 1985 (and until 1990), the band added multi-instrumentalist Roberto Costa as a producer and member. Costa would arrange and perform nearly all the bass and keyboards instead of Liberatori and Nanni, who were increasingly relegated to participation in live shows. In the book dedicated to the band, Chiedi chi sono gli Stadio (Ask who are the Stadio) by Melisanda Massei Autunnali, Marco Nanni emphasizes precisely his discomfort in being virtually ousted from work by the band (in favor of Costa) despite being present in pictures and television appearances. In February 1986, Stadio performed at the Festival di Sanremo, where their performance of \\"Canzoni alla radio\\" (Songs on the radio) ranked last in the competition, suffering from the absence of Liberatori who had left the band on the eve of the event. In the album of the same name that follows are included \\"Luned√¨ Cinema\\" (Monday Cinema), for some years the opening theme of the Lunedifilm movie showcase on Rai Uno; \\"Incubo assoluto\\" (Absolute nightmare) written for them by Roberto \\"Freak\\" Antoni; and generational \\"Giacche senza vento\\" (Coats without wind) with lyrics by director Ambrogio Lo Giudice. The same year Stadio took part in the American tour of Lucio Dalla, on which was recorded the live album DallAmeriCaruso, which included a performance of Stadio's own song \\"Grande figlio di puttana\\". Immediately after the tour, Ricky Portera left the group. In 1987, keyboardist Beppe D'Onghia began working to replace Fedele (who took D'Onghia's position as keyboardist for Luca Carboni), and early next year Stadio released the collection Canzoni allo Stadio (Songs at Stadio style). It notably contains the songs \\"Bella pi√π che mai\\" (Beautiful more than ever) with Saverio Grandi, a song destined to become a classic of the band, and rhythmic \\"Tu vuoi qualcosa\\" (You want something), presented at Festivalbar, and which would also be a theme song of soccer talk show Il Processo del Luned√¨. In 1988, Stadio participated in the Dalla/Morandi album and its tour. In addition to her repertoire, they played two unpublished songs that did not make it onto Canzoni allo Stadio. In 1989, Stadio released their fourth album, Puoi fidarti di me (You can trust me), driven by the success of the single of the same name written by Luca Carboni. = The 1990s = In 1989 or 1990, Stadio dissolved their relationship as the tour band for Lucio Dalla, Curreri desiring Stadio to have more freedom to focus on and promote their own work. The last official collaboration was on an album by Robert & Cara (Robert Sidoli and Carolina Balboni, chorists of Dalla) for which Curreri and D'Onghia wrote the song \\"I segreti dell'amore\\" (The secrets of love). As the band began a new life without its long-time mentor, it faced many internal problems caused by the absolute instability of the private project of its main sponsor. In early 1990, Marco Nanni, after a last TV appearance singing \\"Nel profondo del cuore\\" (In the deep of the heart), controversially left the group and joined Skiantos. He was replaced by Massimo Sutera. In the late summer of 1990, after the long involvement of the band at Cantagiro, Beppe D'Onghia decided to return to work with Lucio Dalla. Shortly thereafter, Sutera also decided to join the Dalla team and was replaced by Roberto Drovandi (former bass guitarist of Luca Carboni). This left Gaetano Curreri and Giovanni Pezzoli as the only original members of Stadio. A few months later they added guitarist Andrea Fornili, who had worked for Loredana Bert√®, Eros Ramazzotti and Miguel Bos√©, and who had worked with Curreri on several TV commercials and the soundtrack for Stasera a casa di Alice (Tonight at Alice's) with the supervision of Vasco Rossi). Producer Luca Orioli, who played keyboards in the studio, took care of the arrangements and returns to his old friend Aldo Fedele as keyboard player in concerts with Alessandro Magri, also on keyboards and computer programming. Pezzoli was tempted away by Dalla to take part in the Change tour, which Curreri accepted on the condition it would be temporary and not affect Stadio's studio work. From about the middle of the tour, Pezzoli abandoned work with Dalla to promote Stadio's new single. (Pezzoli would briefly reunite with Dalla to help record his 1996 studio album, Canzoni.) In 1991, BMG released a second volume of Canzoni alla Stadio. It was viewed by the group as interference by their old record label, exploiting the upcoming release of their new album for EMI. The collection found little success, while the new album became Stadio's first gold record. The single \\"Generazione di fenomeni\\" (Generating of phenomena) became the theme of RAI television show I Ragazzi del muretto. It was released in advance of the album Siamo tutti elefanti inventati (We are all invented elephants), considered by critics as Stadio's most successful (along with La faccia delle donne), and which marked the beginning of the group's collaboration with Saverio Grandi. The album, conceived with actor Alessandro Bergonzoni, has several collaborations, including \\"Ci sar√† (vita controvento)\\" (life upwind) written by Ivano Fossati, \\"Segreteria telefonica\\" (Voicemail) by Claudio Lolli, and \\"Pelle a pelle\\" (Skin to skin) by Luca Carboni and Bruno Mariani. In 1992, Stabiliamo un contatto (Let's establish a contact) was released, including the songs: \\"Per la bandiera\\" (For the flag) written by Francesco Guccini in memory of the dead bodyguards of Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino; the Emilian artist signature, \\"Swatch\\"; \\"Libero di cambiare\\" (Free to change) with lyrics by Jovanotti; and \\"L'appostamento\\" and \\"Lo scatolone\\" (The big box) with lyrics by Bergonzoni. StadioMobileLive is the first work on stage published in the fall of 1993 with the song \\"Un disperato bisogno d'amore\\" (A desperate need of love) (also published as a disco remix on \\"U Got 2 Let the Music\\" by Cappella). Di volpi, di vizi e di virt√π, published in 1995 includes among others the work of Roberto Vecchioni for \\"Canzone d'amore sprecato\\" (Wasted love song), Edoardo Bennato playing harmonica, Roberto Roversi's songs \\"Maledettamericatiamo\\" and \\"Ma se guido una Ferrari\\" (But if I drive a Ferrari), and one of their biggest hits, \\"Ballando al buio\\". In the spring of 1997 they released Dammi 5 minuti, which included \\"Un volo d'amore\\" (A love flying), the story of two young lovers killed in the Bosnian conflict. In 1998, Stadio released Ballate fra il cielo e il mare (Ballads between the sky and the sea), a thematic collection that included new versions of their love songs. The disc was reissued in February 1999 with the addition of the song \\"Lo zaino\\" (The backpack), written by Vasco Rossi. In the 2000 album Donne & colori (Women and colours), Stadio attempted, with the production help of Guido Elmi and Frank Nemola, an ethnic approach, resulting in the song \\"In paradiso con te\\" (In paradise with you) with Israeli singer Amal Murkus. The album also features two songs with lyrics by Roberto Roversi. The album met a lukewarm reception and is one of the less successful in their careers. = The 2000s = Occhi negli occhi After reflecting on their previous album and ballad collection, Stadio refocused and released the 2002 album Occhi negli occhi (Eyes in eyes) with the singles \\"Sorprendimi\\" (Surprise) and \\"Il segreto\\" (The secret). In 2003, during a stop on the tour in Acireale, Curreri suffered a stroke, and was saved by a physician in the audience. The same year, after years of controversy, in a televised broadcast, Stadio performed a duet with Lucio Dalla, \\"Grande figlio di puttana\\". In the same period there was also a collaboration between Curreri and Portera (former Stadio guitarist and front-man). These two, along with Pezzoli and Roberto Costa on bass, recorded Portera's second album, Ci sono cose. This collaboration also led to a new arrangement of Stadio's \\"Canzoni alla radio\\". L'amore volubile and Canzoni per parrucchiere With the release in 2005 of their album L'amore volubile (The fickle love), Stadio seemed to change trajectory with writer and producer Figure Saverio Grandi. In 2006, they released Canzoni per parrucchiere Live Tour (Songs for hairdressers Live Tour) as an album and their first concert DVD, recorded during a stop of the theatrical tour. Parole nel vento In 2007, Gaetano Curreri and Saverio Grandi, together with Marco Falagiani and Giancarlo Bigazzi, wrote \\"E mi alzo sui pedali\\" (And I get up on the pedals) for the RAI production Marco Pantani, also filming a video clip. The song is also included on the album Parole nel vento (Words in the wind) released after their participation at Sanremo with the song \\"Look at me\\" (thirteenth place). The album was followed by a tour of theaters, sports arenas, and squares. In 2007, they won the award for best Italian group at the Venice Music Awards. On 9 November 2007 the triple-disc Platinum Collection of Stadio's greatest hits was released and a new tour launched on 17 November 2007. Diluvio universale and Diamanti e caramelle On 20 March 2009, Stadio released the album Diluvio universale with a title song written with Vasco Rossi and Alessandro Magri, and arranged by Alessandro Magri. The album also includes \\"Resta come sei\\" (Stay as you are), composed and sung by Fabrizio Moro. On March 23 they began the Diluvio tour in Bologna; in some stages there was the participation of Noemi and Fabrizio Moro. On 6 March 2009, they released the single \\"Gioia e dolore\\" (Joy and sorrow). On 26 August 2011, they released \\"Gaetano e Giacinto\\", a song dedicated to Gaetano Scirea and Giacinto Facchetti, and single of the album Diamanti e caramelle (Diamonds and candy), which was in stores 27 September 2011. The album includes \\"La promessa\\" (The promise) as a duet with Noemi. On 3 February 2012, a third single was released, \\"Poi ti lascer√≤ dormire\\" (Then let you sleep), which was used in the soundtrack for Carlo Verdone's Posti in piedi in paradiso (Places standing in heaven). 30 I nostri anni and Immagini del vostro amore On 30 October 2012, Stadio released their third live album, 30 I nostri anni (Our 30 years), to celebrate the group's thirty-year career. The anthology included three unpublished songs: \\"I nostri anni\\" (Our years) written by Fabrizio Moro, \\"Bella\\" by Luca Carboni, and \\"Dall'altra parte dell'et√†\\" (across age) by Poplars and Fornili. (The first two were singles for the album.) Additional songs are performed with the Sanremo Festival Orchestra, under the direction of Maestro Bruno Santori. On 24 October 2013, Stadio released the single \\"Immagini del nostro amore\\" (Pictures of our love) and on 19 November the album Immagini del vostro amore (Pictures of your love). It includes duets with Noemi in \\"La promessa\\", with Saverio Grandi in \\"Cortili lontani\\" (In courtyards away) and a collaboration with Solis String Quartet in \\"La mia canzone per te\\" (In my song for you). = The return: winning Sanremo Music Festival 2016 = On 13 December 2015, the group's participation in the 66th Sanremo Music Festival was announced, in the Campioni (big artists) section, with the song \\"Un giorno mi dirai\\" (One day you will tell me), to promote Stadio's album Miss Nostalgia, released 12 February 2016. On 13 February 2016, Stadio won the Campioni section, and also the right to represent Italy at the Eurovision Song Contest 2016. However, Italian broadcaster RAI confirmed after the competition that Stadio decided not to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest. The artist who represented Italy was the runner-up, Francesca Michielin. Stadio also won the Sanremo Music Festival award for Best Cover, with the song \\"La Sera Dei Miracoli\\" by Lucio Dalla. They won the Festival with a standing ovation from the Ariston Theatre.

His career long exploration of new subject matter, novel techniques and materials made his art dealer, James Mayor, describe him as Europe's equivalent of Robert Rauschenberg. Early life Ivor Abrahams was born 10 January 1935 in Wigan, Lancashire to a Jewish family, the eldest of 2 children. Both parents were born in Manchester area - Ray (Rachael) n√©e Kalisky / Kay and Harry (Hyman) Abrahams - but all four grandparents came from eastern Europe. He studied sculpture at Saint Martin's School of Art under Frank Martin and Anthony Caro 1952‚Äì54, and Camberwell School of Art under Karel Vogel and Martin Bloch 1954‚Äì57. In 1957, he became apprentice to the Fiorini Bronze Foundry,Fiorini Bronze Foundry and went on to work as a display artist for Adel Rootstein. Work His first show, in 1960, was at the Portal Gallery with Peter Blake. Through Eduardo Paolozzi, he was included in the landmark 1961 ICA exhibition 26 Young Sculptors, together with Phillip King and Maurice Agis, friends from the St Martin's days. By the late 1960s Abrahams had found inspiration in the imagery of domestic gardens. As well as bronze, he started using new material for his work, nylon flocking, pre-vulcanized latex, styrene and plastics. After a solo show at the Richard Feigen Gallery in New York in 1970, he established his international reputation with a major museum show at the Kolnisher Kunstverein Cologne in 1973. In 1975, he met James Mayor who invited him to show the following year at the Mayor Gallery, thus beginning an association which continued till his death. Abrahams' print output includes his garden series and suites celebrating Edmund Burke and Edgar Allan Poe showcased in a Royal Academy exhibition in 2010. His body of prints was published by Bernard Jacobson who regularly exhibited his work in London and the US. In 1982, Bryan Robertson organised an exhibition of the sculptures at the Warwick Arts Trust and in 1984 he was invited to mount his first sculpture retrospective at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park. Abrahams' post-Cubist architectural structures of the 90s resulted in a commission by the Goodwood Sculpture Park and the purchase of the bronze Head of the Stairs by the Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea. In the 2000s a series of owls and cockerels, using various media, including enamel on steel epoxy resin and decal, culminated in the 2005 Mayor Gallery exhibition 'A Parliament of Owls'. 2007 saw a mini retrospective entitled The Four Seasons of Ivor Abrahams at One Canada Square in Canary Wharf. In 2008 the Henry Moore Institute mounted an exhibition of early work untitled By Leafy Ways showing the 1972 film of the same name, which prompted a reintroduction of the Garden image. In 2012, a retrospective at the Royal West of England Academy was accompanied by an Andrew Lambirth monograph: Eden and Other Suburbs, the Life and Work of Ivor Abrahams.

Its mission is to \\"support open technologies and communities that increase free expression, circumvent censorship, and obstruct repressive surveillance as a way to promote human rights and open societies.\\" As of November 2019, the Open Technology Fund became an independent nonprofit corporation and a grantee of the U.S. Agency for Global Media. Until its formation as an independent entity, it had operated as a program of Radio Free Asia. History The Open Technology Fund was created in 2012 as a pilot program within Radio Free Asia. Under U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, the State Department adopted a policy of supporting global internet freedom initiatives. At this time, RFA began looking into technologies that helped their audiences avoid censorship and surveillance. Journalist Eli Lake argued that Clinton's policy was \\"heavily influenced by the Internet activism that helped organize the green revolution in Iran in 2009 and other revolutions in the Arab world in 2010 and 2011\\". Note: The author uses \\"Open Whisper\\" when referring to Open Whisper Systems. In September 2014, the OTF worked with Google and Dropbox to create an organization called Simply Secure to help improve the usability of privacy tools. In March 2017, the OTF's future was reported as under question due to the Trump administration's unclear positions on Internet freedom issues. Since then, the OTF has continued to receive Congressional funding under the Trump administration. In November 2019, OTF announced that they became an independent non-profit corporation. In June 2020, Libby Liu resigned as CEO of OTF. Organization and funding The Open Technology Fund operated for seven years as a program of Radio Free Asia, a U.S. government-funded, nonprofit international corporation that provides news, information and commentary in East Asia. Since 2019, the OTF has had its own Board of Directors and receives its funding directly from the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM), an independent agency of the U.S. government. The OTF is sustained by annual grants from the USAGM, which originate from yearly U.S. Congressional appropriations for State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs. According to the OTF, it works together with other publicly funded programs to fulfill a U.S. Congressional mandate to sustain and increase global freedom of information on the Internet with public funds. Projects The OTF funds third party audits for all of the code related projects that it supports. It has also offered to fund audits of \\"non-OTF supported projects that are in use by individuals and organizations under threat of censorship/surveillance\\". Notable projects whose audits the OTF has sponsored include Cryptocat, Commotion Wireless, TextSecure, GlobaLeaks, MediaWiki, OpenPGP.js, Nitrokey, and Ricochet. The OTF also matched donations that were made toward the auditing of TrueCrypt. In December 2014, the OTF reported that it had funded more than 30 technology code audits over the past three years, identifying 185 privacy and security vulnerabilities in both OTF and non-OTF-funded projects. In December 2015, The Tor Project announced that the OTF will be sponsoring a bug bounty program that will be coordinated by HackerOne. The program will initially be invite-only and will focus on finding vulnerabilities that are specific to The Tor Project's applications. In October 2019, Sarah Aoun, the OTF's Technology Director, discussed the findings of OTF-funded research into a Chinese government mobile application, telling ABC News that the app essentially amounts to a \\"surveillance device in your pocket.\\" \\"The access itself is significant,\\" Adam Lynn, the OTF's Research Director, told The Washington Post. \\"The fact that they've gone to these lengths [to hide it] only further heightens the scrutiny around this.\\" According to its funding agency, the U.S. Agency for Global Media, OTF's impact by 2019 was global, with over 2 billion people using OTF-supported technology daily, and more than two-thirds of all mobile users having OTF-incubated technology on their devices. \\"As authoritarian states worldwide increasingly attempt to control what their citizens read, write, and even share online,\\" said OTF CEO Libby Liu, \\"this next stage in OTF's growth could not come at a more crucial time.\\" OTF had $2 million of funding from the USAGM to assist with the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests, however this funding was frozen by USAGM CEO Michael Pack in June 2020 as China was preparing to introduce a new national security law for Hong Kong.  Dispute Over Board  On June 17, 2020 the newly appointed head of USAGM, Michael Pack fired the board of OTF and CEO Libbey Liu. Libbey Liu had had already tendered her resignation on June 13, 2020, effective July 13, 2020 on a separate issue regarding the usage of closed-source software. The new board was named, consisting of Jonathan Alexandre (Senior Counsel, Liberty Counsel Action), Robert Bowes (Senior Advisor to the Secretary, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development), Bethany Kozma (Deputy Chief of Staff, United States Agency for International Development), Rachel Semmel (Communications Director, Office of Management and Budget), Emily Newman (Chief of Staff, USAGM), and Michael Pack as Chairman. The following day, president Laura Cunningham was fired by the new board. A lawsuit was filed on June 23, 2020 by the office of the District of Columbia's attorney general contesting the changes under the District of Columbia's Nonprofit Corporations Act. The lawsuit alleged that the actions violated the \\"firewall\\" clause in federal communications regulations that shield government news agencies from political interference. On July 21, 2020 the firings were blocked by US Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia in an emergency stay. In a two-page order, the court warned that these actions could endanger the work of activists against Internet censorship in countries with repressive government. On October 16, 2020, in a separate case the DC Superior Court ruled that the changes were unlawful, reinstated the previous board and ruled that any changes made by the new board were invalid.

After finishing third on his racecourse debut he won his remaining four races as a two-year-old in 1995, including victories in the Autumn Stakes and the Racing Post Trophy to establish himself as one of the best staying juveniles of his generation in Britain. He upset Alhaarth in the Craven Stakes on his three-year-old debut and went on to finish fifth in the 2000 Guineas and third in the Irish 2,000 Guineas. He won one minor race in 1997 and the Spring Trophy in 1998 before being retired from racing at the end of the 1999 season. He made no impact as a sire of winners. Background Beauchamp King was a grey horse bred in England by his owner Erik Penser a Swedish financier based at Compton Beauchamp in the Vale of the White Horse. He was sired by Nishapour, a French stallion whose biggest win came in the 1978 Poule d'Essai des Poulains. As a breeding stallion, the best of his other progeny included the Prix de Diane winner Shemaka and the leading National Hunt performers Calapaez (Cleeve Hurdle) and First Bout (Triumph Hurdle). Beauchamp King's dam Afariya was bred by the Aga Khan and won two minor races in France. She was a descendant of the French broodmare Minnewaska, who was the ancestor of many major winners including Tom Rolfe, Sham and Ack Ack. Penser sent his colt into training with John Dunlop at his stable in Arundel, West Sussex. Beauchamp King's successes in 1995 helped Dunlop win his first and only trainers' championship. Racing career =1995: two-year-old season= Beauchamp King began his racing career by finishing third of the eight runners in a maiden race over seven furlongs at Kempton Park Racecourse on 28 June. On 8 August at Ayr Racecourse he started 8/13 for a similar event and recorded his first success, accelerating away from his four opponents in the closing stages to win by four lengths. On his next appearance the colt started 7/2 second favourite for a minor stakes race at Haydock Park on 2 September and won by three and a half lengths from Matiya, a filly who went on to finish third in the Fillies' Mile. He was then stepped up in class and distance for the Listed Autumn Stakes over one mile at Ascot Racecourse on 7 October and started third choice in the betting behind Storm Trooper and Ramooz. Ridden for the first time by John Reid he was restrained in the early stages before taking the lead a furlong and a half from the finish and winning by one and a quarter lengths from Storm Trooper. Reid was again in the saddle two weeks later when Beauchamp King was stepped up to Group One level for the Racing Post Trophy at Doncaster Racecourse and started the 11/4 second favourite behind the Luca Cumani-trained Mons, a five length winner of the Royal Lodge Stakes. The other two runners were the Somerville Tattersall Stakes winner Even Top, and the Peter Walwyn-trained outsider Iamus. Penser had to pay a supplementary fee of ¬£15,000 as the colt had not been among the original entries for the race. Reid settled the colt in third place as Mons set the pace from Even Top. Beauchamp King moved forward from half way, took the lead approaching the final furlong and won \\"readily\\" by one and a quarter lengths from Even Top and Mons. After the race Reid commented; \\"Perhaps I should have waited a bit longer, but he was always going well and from three down I knew he would win... He travels well in his races, and has a real turn of foot. And he goes on any ground. They're the signs of a good horse\\". =1996: three-year-old season= On his first appearance as a three-year-old Beauchamp King contested the Craven Stakes (a major trial race for the 2000 Guineas) over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket Racecourse on 18 April. He started the 9/2 second favourite behind Alhaarth (the Cartier Champion Two-year-old Colt of 1995), whilst the other three runners included Polaris Flight, the winner of the Richmond Stakes and the Crit√©rium de Saint-Cloud. After being held up by Reid at the rear of the field he overtook Alhaarth inside the final furlong and won by a neck, with Polaris Flight three and a half lengths back in third. Robin Oakley, writing in The Spectator, described the winner as \\"a gutsy horse who seems to go on improving with every run\\". After winning five consecutive races, Beauchamp King started 9/2 second favourite behind Alhaarth in the 2000 Guineas on 4 May. He pulled hard against Reid's attempts to restrain him and was never able to reach the leaders before finishing fifth behind Mark of Esteem, Even Top, Bijou d'Inde and Alhaarth. In the Irish 2,000 Guineas three weeks later at the Curragh he stayed on well in the closing stages to finish third behind Spinning World and Rainbow Blues. In his two remaining races of 1996 Beauchamp King was matched against older horses but failed to reproduce his best form. He finished last of seven in both the Eclipse Stakes over ten furlongs at Sandown Park Racecourse on 6 July and the Celebration Mile at Goodwood Racecourse on 24 August. =1997 - 1999: later career= As a four-year old Beauchamp King finished unplaced in the Sandown Mile, the Lockinge Stakes and the Queen Anne Stakes before winning a minor race over a mile at Doncaster on 31 July. On his only other start of the year he finished last of eight in the Desmond Stakes. In 1998 Beauchamp King was transferred to the stable of Dunlop's former assistant Gerard Butler. On his first appearance for his new trainer, the horse started a 16/1 outsider for the Listed Spring Trophy over seven furlongs at Haydock on 2 May. Ridden by Chris Rutter, he overcame an obstructed run in the straight to take the lead in the final strides and won by a neck from Ramooz. He failed to build on his success and finished unplaced in his four subsequent races that year. Beauchamp King remained in training as a six-year-old but made no impact in two races, finishing last in the Lincoln Handicap and ninth in the Spring Trophy. Stud record At the end of his racing career, Beauchamp King was retired to become a breeding stallion. He stood in France, Italy and Ireland but had very little success as a sire of winners. His last foals were born in 2008.

It was created in part to serve as a \\"reference plot\\" for the study of the ecological impact of the Zeya Dam and the Zeya Reservoir which were built in the 1960s and 1970s. The ground cover in the reserve is primarily taiga, of mostly larch and Mongolian oak. The reserve is situated 13 km north of the city of Zeya, in the Zeysky District of Amur Oblast. Topography The Zeya Reserve about 150 km north of the border with China, on the northwest bank of the Zeya river, which is a left tributary of the Amur River, which is flowing east at this point. The reserve is rectangular in shape, running in a northwesterly direction for about 60 km up the Tukuringra Ridge with a width of about 20 km. the Tukuringra Ridge is part of a system of ridges (\\"Janka-Tukuringra-Soktahan-Dzhagdy\\"). The altitudes above sea level in the territory are 40% below 700 m, 35% from 700-000, 18% from 1,000-1,300 m, and 7% greater than 1,300 meters. There are over 200 streams and small rivers spread evenly over the territory. They have the character of mountain waterways: steep narrow valleys, sharp drops and rapids. In the winter they freeze to the bottom. The main rocks are gneisses, and the soils the product of weatherized gneisses. Climate and Ecoregion Zeya is located in the Da Hinggan-Dzhagdy Mountains conifer forests ecoregion. This is a region of inland plains surrounded by low hills and the Greater Khingan mountain range, a forested area connecting China (Manchuria) and Russia (Amur River basin). Trees are southern taiga in the Russian sections, and Mongolian larch forests with mixed pine and fir in the Chinese forests. The climate of Zeya is Subarctic climate, dry winters (K√∂ppen climate classification (Dwc)). This climate is characterized by long, very cold winters, and cool summers. but with little snow in winters. Average temperatures in the reserve are -28.8 C in January, and +19.7 in July. Average rainfall is 515 mm per year. Winds are from the north-northeast in autumn and winter, and from the south- southwest in spring and summer. Flora and fauna Over 90% of the reserve is forested, with trees characteristic of the transition zone from southern to northern taiga. Altitude zoning determines the predominate trees at different heights. From 350 to 500 meters the dominant trees are oak and black birch. From 500 to 1,000 meters the dominant trees are larch, with stands of birch, spruce and aspen. The under-story of this larch forest is mostly cranberries, wild rosemary marsh, Dahurian rhododendron and mosses. From 1,000 to 1,300 is a belt of dark taiga, mostly spruce and fir. Above the dark taiga, the ridgetops are covered with cedar, and accompanying Siberian juniper and rhododendron. For animals, the ridges of the region act as meeting zones and highways for representative species of many faunal complexes - East Siberian (Angara) fauna, Manchu, Daur, Mongolian, Okhotsk-Kamchatka and fauna of the Far Eastern highlands. Ecotourism As a strict nature reserve, the Zeya Reserve is mostly closed to the general public, although scientists and those with 'environmental education' purposes can make arrangements with park management for visits. There are three 'ecotourist' routes in the reserve, however, that are open to the public, but require permits to be obtained in advance. The three are: * \\"Twentieth\\" EcoTrail. A 3 km educational hike, suitable for schoolchildren and the elderly. Instruction on the plants and animals of the territory, and the scientific work of the reserve. * \\"Tourist Route Kamenshua-Loaches\\". 16 km hike (2 days). Closed during winter and bear mating season. Certain vaccinations required against tick-borne diseases. Hike to the top of the ridge, with viewpoints. * \\"Tourist Route Erikingra-Loaches\\". 20 km hike (3 days). Hike and climb through variety of terrain. For more active visitors with a more scientific focus. The main office is in the city of Zeya.

Measuring 5.8 on the moment magnitude scale, it is the strongest in state history. At 5.8 magnitude, this ties it with the 2011 Virginia earthquake, which was determined after it struck to be the most powerful quake in the eastern United States in the preceding 70 years. Events The initial quake was followed by nine local aftershocks between magnitudes 2.6 and 3.6 within three and one-half hours. Some news reports indicated that the earthquake was felt as far south as San Antonio, Texas, as far north as Fargo, North Dakota, as far east as Memphis, Tennessee, and as far west as Gilbert, Arizona. The earthquake was the largest ever recorded in the state, substantially exceeding a 5.1 magnitude earthquake which struck near Fairview in February 2016 and slightly more powerful than the 5.7 magnitude 2011 Oklahoma earthquake in Prague, Oklahoma. It occurred amid a significant increase in induced earthquakes in the central and eastern United States over the seven preceding years. Oklahoma in particular saw earthquake rates increase by over two hundred times between 2009 and 2016, from a background average of one to three a year, between 1975 and 2008. It experienced 585 quakes of magnitude 3 and larger, in 2014, compared with only 100 in 2013. This was over three times the number experienced by seismically active California in 2014. Following the earthquake, Pawnee Nation declared a state of emergency and closed off several of its buildings until such time as the damage could be examined. Regulators in Oklahoma ordered 37 wastewater disposal wells in the vicinity of the earthquake (see map in citation) to be rapidly closed. Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin declared a state of emergency for Pawnee County where the worst of the damage was located. Thirty-two additional wells were shut down by the Environmental Protection Agency because they were determined to be located too close to the newly discovered fault on which the earthquake occurred. Several months after the earthquake, in March 2017, Pawnee Nation filed a lawsuit in its own tribal court alleging that a selection of oil companies injecting wastewater underground were responsible for causing the earthquake. One of the lawyers working on the side of the tribe stated that the case was being taken to its own court as a way of stressing its sovereignty.  Geology  The earthquake occurred along a previously unmapped buried strike-slip fault, and the epicenter is located near the junction of the two previously mapped faults, Watchorn fault and Labette fault.  Damage  The earthquake caused moderate to severe damage around the epicenter, especially in Pawnee, where various buildings were damaged. Damage was recorded 300 miles from Pawnee in the Kansas City area at the Wyandotte County, Kansas courthouse, which sustained a crack from the roof to the ground.Oklahoma earthquake causes damage to Wyandotte County Courthouse, KSHB, Ali Hoxie, September 8, 2016. Retrieved 10 September 2016. One person was injured as a result of the earthquake: in Pawnee, a man was hit by a falling chimney. There were also liquefaction-related ground damage during the earthquake. The locations of liquefaction damage do not align with the fault that ruptured, but coincide with areas dominated by Quaternary alluvial deposits.

The New York Times lauded The Sylvan Path (1997), saying, \\"Ostensibly chasing the ghost of Joe Knowles, a self-proclaimed wild man who won fame in 1913 for claiming to have survived two months buck naked and provisionless in the Maine woods, Mr. Ferguson actually has a broader, equally romantic goal - to 'roam the last wild places . . . looking for the people who still had pieces of the old American imagination in their pockets.' The Sylvan Path is a book of leisurely evenings spent with loggers, fishermen, storytellers, herbalists and moonshiners - people who not only make their living in the woods but disconnect themselves as much as possible from mass production. A former forest ranger, Mr. Ferguson is a resourceful guide. Whether he's lying down to watch a sundew plant entrap an insect or paddling out into the middle of a lake to exchange yodeling calls with a pair of loons, he exudes a delighted, boyish enthusiasm. Without being preachy, his book makes an argument for slowing down and focusing more closely on wherever you happen to be.\\" School Library Journal characterized Spirits of the Wild (1996) as \\"A simple and diverse collection of stories that explain how things found in nature came to be.\\"Kraft, Dottie, and Trevelyn E.

The church was built, with the adjacent cloister, between 1454 and 1472 in honor of St Bernardino of Siena. The corpse of the saint is guarded inside the church in a mausoleum and it was declared a Basilica Minor in May 1946 by Pope Pius XII. The earthquake in April 2009 seriously ruined the apse and the campanile. In May 2015, the basilica was reopened to the community.  History  The events about foundation of the church are connected to the figure of Saint Bernardino, who, although he was seriously sick, in 1444 went to Aquila to try to reconcile two adversarial groups. When he died, on the 20th May exactly on the Abruzzo's county seat, the citizens asked for and attained by Pope Eugene IVthe authorization to guard the corpse of the saint. Inside partial view The first period of works, frequently interrupted, began on 1454 and closed on 1472 with the realization of the cupola, which allowed the relocation of the corpse inside the basilica. Just later began the building of the facade under the direction of Silvestro dall'Aquila. When he died in 1504, the works stopped and the facade remained incomplete for over twenty years. In 1524, the job was taken by Nicola Filotesio, better known as Cola dell'Amatrice, and the church was completed in 1542. After the earthquake in 1703, the inside of the church was completely rebuilt in Baroque style by three great architects of that period: Cipriani, Contini and Biarigioni. In 1724 Ferdinando Mosca made the magnificent wooden ceiling which was painted by Girolamo Cenatiempo, who was also the painter of frescos in the chapel hosting the saint's mausoleum. In 1773 Donato Rocco completed the principal altar. In April 2009, another violent earthquake hit L'Aquila, which damaged the apsis of the cathedral, destroying part of the bell tower, and the cupola, the longitudinal walls and adjacent cloister were subjected to problems. The day of the earthquake, the president of group Montepaschi Siena, Giuseppe Mussari, guaranteed live on TV a huge loan to permit the restoration work of the basilica. The cost was evaluated at over 40 million euros and the work was projected to last more than 10 years. In May 2015 the church reopened to the community after six years of work, restoring the cupola and the bell tower damaged by the earthquake of 2009.  Description  The basilica is placed in the old town center, across Via San Bernardino, near Corso Vittorio Emanuele. The church is located over a monumental staircase which originates from Piazza Bariscianello to the basilica, establishing a fantastic point of view for the people arriving from via Fortebraccio. Another smaller staircase raises up the church from the street constituting the parvis. Monumental pipe organ = The facade = The facade is made in stone and was built on the project by Cola dell'Amatrice between 1524 and 1542. In some researchers' opinion, the facade was inspired by Michelangelo's project for the Basilica of San Lorenzo in Florence. It is subdivided in three different architectural orders: the first in doric order, the second ionic and the third corinthian. On the trabeation of the first order there are illustrated metops, on the second order there is a refined triple lancet window, which was added during the restoration work in the 18th century, and on the third order there are three big oculuses. Four sequences of double columns vertically divide the church, establishing a suggestive and harmonic diagram of nine squares on three lines. The principal gate is embedded by spiral columns. The lunette includes a Silvestro dell'Aquila's high relief illustrating Madonna with child between Francesco d'Assisi and Bernardino da Siena. Saint Bernardin's mausoleum = Inside = The map of the inside is a Latin cross with three naves long about 26 feet. His aspect is sumptuously baroque due to restoration work following the earthquake in the 1703 which demolished the central nave, the cupola and the tambour. Today the central nave has an exquisite wooden lacunar ceiling carving, painting and gilding by Ferdinando Mosca da Pescocostanzo (1723-1727]), who also made the magnificent pipe organ. The ceiling was later painted by Girolamo Cenatiempo, pupil of Luca Giordano. The lateral naves include many chapels formed in octagonal cupolas. The last chapel to the left contains the Mausoleum Camponeschi, made by Silvestro dell'Aquila. The second from the right has an altarpiece in terracotta white-glazed on blue bottom, by Andrea della Robbia. On the fourth chapel to the right there is the painting Adorazione dei Magi, work by Pompeo Cesura, pupil of Raffaello. The fifth chapel to the right, which is much bigger than the others one, features the Mausoleum of St Bernardino of Siena. The commission was given to Silvestro dell'Aquila in 1489 by Jacopo di Notar Nanni and it was completed by his grandchild Angelo, batter known as L'Ariscola, in 1505. The mausoleum in considered the masterpiece of Renaissance art in L'Aquila. The mausoleum has quadrilateral form on two lines of pilasters decorated by recesses with sacred sculptures. The remains of the saint are held in a modern silver urn which substitutes for the original one smuggled by French. The vault of the chapel and the apse have frescos made by Girolamo Cenatiempo.

It began in 1960 and lasted about two years. Origins In 1960, fourteen hundred Black Americans registered to vote in deeply segregated Fayette County. As retaliation, white landowners evicted 257 black sharecroppers from their homes. Shepard Towles, a local Black landowner, let the displaced farmers camp on his land. Towles stated, \\"These people had nowhere to go. I decided to let them come in free, let them use the water from my deep well‚Äîas long as it lasts.\\" This became known as Tent City. Previously, John McFerren and Harpman Jameson founded the Fayette County Civic and Welfare League to 'promote civil and political and economic' community progress. McFerren, Jameson, and J.F. Estes, a Memphis lawyer, travelled to Washington, D.C. to lobby the Justice Department to intervene on behalf of the sharecroppers. The Civil Rights Act of 1957 prohibits \\"against intimidating, coercing or otherwise interfering with the rights of persons to vote for the President and members of Congress.\\" The white community then retaliated further by refusing to sell groceries and other amenities to black registered voters. National attention McFerren appealed to national newspapers to draw attention to the plight of residents in Tent City.Viola McFerren. Oral history interview. Civil Rights Oral History Project. Special Collection Division, Nashville Public Library. Gulf, Texaco, and Esso refused deliver gasoline to McFerren's store. The NAACP called for a national boycott of these chains. Attorney General Robert Kennedy ordered the Justice Department to investigate civil rights violations in Fayette County. The AFL- CIO published a pamphlet, Tent City... \\"Home of the Brave\\" calling for donations. In 1961, trucks arrived with 150 tons of donated food and clothes. National attention drew white civil rights advocates from Cornell University, the University of Wisconsin, and the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers). The national attention intensified voter registration drives and this eventually led to black majority voter registration, though elections were still fixed in favor of whites. Dissolution The largest impromptu settlement on Towles' farm lasted approximately two years. Residents moved with other black families or relocated to other parts of Tennessee.

The Avonmore name continues to be used in a wide variety of branded products such as milk, cheese, soup and butter, and is the most purchased grocery brand in Ireland. In 2014 Avonmore expanded its operations to China, and is one of the country's largest suppliers of UHT milk and infant formula. History The Village Creameries amalgamation started when the Avonmore Creameries food brand was first created in 1966, by founder Mr. Redmond Brennan. Their Co-op entity was registered as a public company in 1988, as Avonmore Food plc and later merged with Waterford Food plc in 1997. It is today known as Glanbia, a nutrition company with wholly owned revenues of over ‚Ç¨2.3 billion and 6,900 employees in 2018. Their ambition as set out in 2018, is to be a ‚Ç¨6bn total revenue group in 2022. The Village Creamery became a success story that emerged from the dedication and cooperation among farmers, management, workers and the community at large. They were run by Committee. Each Creamery became a branch of Avonmore Foods plc. The Irish Co- operative Organisation Society (ICOS) played a central role in that success by unifying all the Creameries from their foundation in 1894 through advising management and committees on all aspects of Dairy Society. It was ICOS who brought farming people together in Kilkenny and surrounding counties. Despite that, many Creameries would not have survived but for far-seeing farmers who were willing to invest in the society. Some went into liquidation. Apart from milk collection, Creameries provided invaluable services to the farming communities -including butter making with on site shops but also grain drying and agricultural contract work. Avonmore in 1966 aimed to derive benefits from increased scale and greater diversification in the 1960s. Both Avonmore and Glanbia have their origins in the Irish agricultural co-operative movement that evolved over the last century, ever since first Irish Co-operative in 1889 was founded by Horace Plunkett. Between 2001 and 2004 Glanbia implemented a significant reorganisation aimed at reshaping its portfolio and providing the foundation for future growth. In 2008 they decided to vertically integrate with the acquisition of a customer, Optimum Nutrition. Glanbia went on to become a leader in the branded sports nutrition sector both in the US and internationally. Glanbia Plc now have operations in 34 countries and are exporting from Ireland to more than 100 countries worldwide. Their combined operations were ranked by revenues (in 2010 figures) in the top 100 Cooperatives, at No 98 Co-op in the world and at No 1 Co-op in Ireland, by the International Co-operative Alliance (ICA), an international organisation of co-operatives. The year 2012 was an important turning point in the history of Glanbia Plc with its separation from its cooperative origins, Avonmore. On 29 August 2012, a proposal was announced whereby the Society would buy 60% of Glanbia's Irish dairy processing business, Glanbia Ingredients Ireland, reducing its shareholding in Glanbia from 54% to 41%. Both Glanbia shareholders and Society members approved the proposal and on 25 November 2012, Glanbia Ingredients Ireland became a 40% associate of Glanbia. As of 2018, Glanbia Ireland, the unit spun off in 2017 from Glanbia PLC, today owns brands Avonmore and Kilmeaden, has launched a new consumer brand in the United States, Truly Grass Fed, focusing initially on the sale of cheese. Glanbia PLC owns about 40pc of Glanbia Ireland, with the original Glanbia Co-op owning the remainder of their subsidiary. =The Glanbia Collection= According to Glanbia Collections in Kilkenny Archives at St Kieran's College, Kilkenny, the Avonmore Coop brand was created through the merger of the following Village Creameries that are included among their archives for: Ballingarry Co- Operative Creamery Ltd., Ballyhale Co-Operative Creamery Dairy Society Ltd.,Ballypatrick Co-Operative Creamery Ltd., Avonmore Creameries Ltd., Ballyragget Co-Operative Creamery Ltd., Bennettsbridge Co-Operative Creamery Ltd., Callan Co-op Creamery and Dairy Society Ltd., Castlehale Co-Operative Dairy Society Ltd., Castlecomer Co-Operative Creamery Ltd., Donaghmore Co- Operative Creamery Ltd., Dungarvan Co Waterford Co-Operative Creamery Ltd., Freshford Co-Operative Creamery Ltd., Glenmore, County Kilkenny Co-Operative Creamery Ltd., Graiguecullen, County Carlow Corn & Coal Co.

Heritage Glanbia has its origins in the Irish co-operative movement that evolved as it grew exponentially throughout the 20th century. Glanbia plc was formed in 1997 out of the merger of Avonmore Foods plc and Waterford Foods plc. The Avonmore cooperative philosophy was that by bringing people together, great things can often happen. =1960-1983 ‚Äì Formation of Avonmore and Waterford= Cooperatives of that time had major downsides in that they lacked significant capital raising instruments for expansion and development and also the legal and financial protection afforded by corporate structures. To realise the benefits of scale and diversification, the 1960s thus witnessed the amalgamation of many small, locally focused co- operative Creameries across Ireland. Accordingly, Waterford Co-op Society was formed in 1964, followed by Avonmore Creameries in Kilkenny two years later, in 1966. Increased farm collection and processing capacity were urgently required. That led to the super milk trucks and construction of a multi- purpose Avonmore dairy plant facility in Ballyragget, County Kilkenny, close to the Avon River from which Avonmore took its name. It was believed to be the biggest food processing facility in Europe at that time and probably the fourth largest in the world. =1984-1996 ‚Äì Flotation and expansion= After the introduction of European milk quotas in 1984, the domestic growth opportunities for Irish co-operatives and their members were very limited. Waterford Co-op Society and Avonmore Creameries both realised that to expand they would have to seek out new markets from outside of Ireland. The best way to fund such an expansion they recognised was through a stock market flotation. Accordingly, Avonmore Foods plc was floated on the Irish Stock Exchange on 6 September 1988 and Waterford Foods plc were floated a month later on 6 October 1988. This provided the funding to expand their product offerings while also expanding their geographic footprint. They acquired a number of small cheese plants in the US to form a platform for their market- leading US Cheese business that they retain today. =1997-2000 ‚Äì The merger= After their flotations in 1988, Avonmore Foods and Waterford Foods pursued similar growth strategies. It made commercial sense for both to merge. On 4 September 1997 Avonmore Foods plc and Waterford Foods plc merged to form Avonmore Waterford Group (AWG) plc. After agreement was reached in a special general meeting in Waterford attended by almost 3,200 of the Waterford Co-op's 5,000 shareholders, a joint statement of the Chairmen read: \\"It would lead to an Irish, farmer-controlled food company with the scale and resources to successfully compete in a highly competitive international marketplace\\".It was then the fourth biggest dairy processor in Europe and the fourth biggest cheese producer in the world. In 1999, the business was rebranded Glanbia plc.

The National Ex-Slave Mutual Relief, Bounty and Pension Association (MRB&PA;) was an organization founded for the purpose of obtaining pensions for former slaves from the Federal government as compensation and reparations for their unpaid labor and suffering. Founded in 1896 and chartered in 1898 in Nashville, Tennessee, the organization was founded by former slaves Callie House and Isaiah H. Dickerson. According to historian Mary Frances Berry, the organization was \\"the first mass reparations movement led by African Americans.\\" Early history One early effort to obtain pensions for ex-slaves was led by white newspaper editor, Walter R. Vaughan of Omaha, Nebraska. He modeled his plan off of pensions provided by the Federal government to former Union soldiers, and he persuaded his congressman, William James Connell (R-NE) to introduce the measure to the House of Representatives in 1890. A native of Selma, Alabama, Vaughan believed that pensions to former slaves would provide increased economic vitality and stability to the New South. In 1891 he published a pamphlet entitled \\"Freedmen's Pension Bill: A Plea for American Freedmen,\\" and sold copies at a dollar a piece. A black man who worked as a distributor of Vaughan's pamphlet was Isaiah Dickerson of Rutherford County, Tennessee. A few years later, Dickerson and Callie House would launch their own pension and reparations movement by forming an organization led by and composed of African Americans. The 1900 Nashville City Directory lists the address of the National Ex-Slave Mutual Relief, Bounty and Pension Application as being located at 903 Church Street in Nashville. Conventions The first annual convention of the National Ex-Slave Mutual Relief, Bounty and Pension Association was held November 28 through December 1, 1898 in Nashville, Tennessee at Gay Street Christian Church. Among those in attendance were James C. Napier and Rev. R. H. Boyd. One primary focus of this first meeting was to take stands to support or oppose federal legislation on matters affecting former slaves. Legislative efforts The organization supported a bill introduced by Jeremiah D. Botkin (D-KS)in March 1898 to obtain homesteads for former slaves and their families. Relief efforts The organization also sought to provide various forms of relief and support to its members. This included burial benefits and aid to its members in times of sickness or crisis. Federal investigations The organization was subject to investigation and prosecution by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Post Office for supposedly using the mails to defraud its members. Decline Callie House was imprisoned in 1918, and this effectively ended the legislative efforts of the National Ex-Slave Mutual Relief, Bounty and Pension Association.

It is the opening track and second single from her ninth studio album, The Hope Six Demolition Project, and was released digitally on 11 March 2016 and physically on 16 April 2016 on Island Records. The song was premiered on Shaun Keaveny's show on BBC Radio 6 Music on 10 March 2016, the day before its release. Inspiration The song developed from PJ Harvey's poem \\"Sight-Seeing, South of the River\\",https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CdWp9gOXEAAjlJq.jpg:large published in her 2015 poetry book The Hollow of the Hand.http://www.lizziebdesign.com/The-Hollow-of-the-Hand In the \\"Acknowledgements\\" section of the book she thanks The Washington Post reporter Paul Schwartzman for this poem. Paul Schwartzman described his experience in article \\"I gave a famous rock star a windshield tour of D.C. ‚Äî and didn't know who she was\\". Some of the lines in the song are direct transcriptions of Schwartzman's comments; video sections of his tour are featured in the music video. The song's repeating line \\"they're gonna put a Walmart here\\" refers to a notorious initiative in which Wal-Mart was permitted for the first time to open outlets in the city proper in exchange for constructing some in particularly deprived parts of the city, which it was hoped would reduce a food desert problem. Walmart only opened stores in affluent parts of the city before cancelling plans to open any in poorer areas. The locations in the poem are listed in no clear order, but trace a clean linear path beginning at the Skyland Mall on Alabama Avenue, the planned location for the Southeast Walmart, following Alabama Avenue past the only IHOP in Southeast DC at Alabama and 15th. Alabama merges with Martin Luther King boulevard just past the Ward 7/8 border, by St Elizabeth's Hospital (the former institution referenced in the song), then continues past the junction of MLK and South Capitol Street and one block south past the Community of Hope], a community clinic which provides medical and social services to under-served populations in DC, which is referenced in the poem by the statement \\"Here's the Community of Hope\\". Criticism Upon its release, \\"The Community of Hope\\" drew criticism directly from politicians running for the council seat in Ward 7 in the District of Columbia, with former DC Mayor Vincent C. Gray saying, \\"I will not dignify this inane composition with a response,\\" and his campaign treasurer Chuck Thies insulting Harvey with, \\"PJ Harvey is to music what Piers Morgan is to cable news.\\" Grant Thompson, a pastor and former Congressional staffer running for the Ward 7 council seat, stated that Harvey \\"needs to see more of the city.\\" The circumstances under which music video was produced were also criticized by Joshua Alston, writing for The A.V. Club. Much of his criticism focused on both the use of a black gospel choir \\"to evoke earthiness, spirituality, and rapturous emotion\\" as cultural appropriation, as well as Harvey's failure to \\"treat the natives of that community [she is writing about] with dignity and respect,\\" citing her refusal to be interviewed by a member of the community who guided her on a tour of the city.

Lehrer (16 May 1930 - 6 February 2014) was a Romanian entomologist. From 1996 until his death, he worked as a research associate in the laboratory of Zoology at the University of Tel Aviv in Tel Aviv, Israel. For several years, he studied flesh flies and blow flies from all over the world. Lehrer was born in Ia≈üi, Romania. He died in February 2014, aged 83. For many years he self-published the journal Fragmenta Dipterologica, for which he was almost the sole contributing author.http://siris- libraries.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?uri=full=3100001~!782951!0#focus Toponymy dispute In 2005, Lehrer reclassified the genus Bengalia into 11 new genera in 4 subfamiliesLehrer, A.Z. (2005) Bengaliidae du Monde (Insecta, Diptera). Pensoft Series Faunistica No. 50, Sofia, Moscow. ISSN 1312-0174 within a newly designated family, Bengaliidae. The family designation was disputed by Rognes (2006) who noted that it was equivalent to the already established tribe Bengaliini, and that treating it as a family renders the Calliphoridae paraphyletic.Rognes, K. 2006. Bengalomania ‚Äì A review of Andy Z. Lehrer's book on Bengalia Robineau-Desvoidy, 1830 and related works (Diptera, Calliphoridae). Studia dipterologica 12: 443‚Äì471 Further Rognes considers all the new genera created as junior names for Bengalia. Lehrer's work added 49 species to the already described 41 species and 18 of these new species were treated as invalid by Rognes. At present, major sources of Dipteran taxonomy do not recognize Lehrer's 10 new genera as valid, nor the 18 new species treated as invalid by Rognes (e.g.Thompson, F. C. (editor). 2006. Biosystematic Database of World Diptera. , accessed on 9 Nov. 2007). This dispute reflects that at present, there is no consensus as to the best way to subdivide the Calliphoridae, which many authorities acknowledge is not a natural group (in this case, polyphyletic); the BioSystematic Database of World Diptera, for example, states \\"The Calliphoridae are marked as a polyphyletic group of convenience as at the present we are unwilling to reduce the Oestridae to a subordinated group within a monophyletic Calliphoridae nor to elevate a number of other groups (Polleniidae, Helicoboscidae, and Bengaliidae) so as to properly delimit both Calliphoridae and Oestridae.\\" Similarly, the dispute at the generic level is that some of Lehrer's genera are paraphyletic, and, additionally, that they are based largely or exclusively upon features of the male genitalia, and it is therefore impossible to identify most female specimens to subfamily, let alone genus (the rejection of Lehrer's subdivisions therefore being both taxonomic and a matter of practicality). The dispute at the species level centers on the fact that Lehrer did not include or examine 24 of the 41 known species in his revision, so of the 31 species he validly described that were not immediately synonymized, many could still potentially be synonyms of these 24 excluded species.

He was lord of the manor of Chewton Mendip, South Petherton, Bampton, Waltham and Ingleby and Keeper of the Channel Islands.  Life and career  Following his father's death, Philip's elder brother, Ralph, inherited estates at Belvoir, Ingleby, Saxilby and Broadholme. Ralph, however, later defected to the French in 1205. Philip and at least two of his brothers entered the service of Robert de Breteuil, earl of Leicester, and he was granted the manor of Waltham. Philip was present at the signing of Magna Carta as a member of the king's party, and was mentioned within the document. He participated in First Barons War and was leader of the royalist forces in Kent and Sussex. He participated in the Battle of Lincoln in 1217, and commanded a ship during the Battle of Sandwich later that same year. Following the Pro-Angevin victory in the war he was made the tutor of the young Henry III. For his role in the king's education, d'Aubigny was granted the manors of Chewton Mendip and South Petherton in Somerset, and Bampton in Oxfordshire. Death and burial In 1235, d'Aubigny set out on crusade with his brother Oliver. However, Philip died in the Holy Land a year later, and was subsequently buried in front of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem. His inscribed ledger stone displaying his arms was discovered in 1925, in excellent condition, and was lowered slightly below floor-level to protect it from future foot-fall wear and covered by an iron grille.T. Bolen and T. Powers, 2009 and Raymond Cohen, Saving the Holy Sepulchre, 2008, p. 25 The official record states: :Thanks to the fact that for a long period it was protected by a stone divan built over it for the use of the Moslem guards, the tombstone is in a tolerably good state of preservation. In 1925, during the British Mandate over Palestine, an excavation of the grave for purposes of restoration uncovered Sir Philip‚Äôs bones as well as tablets inscribed in Latin describing his family tree. Based on these explorations, Sir Ronald Storrs, the military governor of Jerusalem, authenticated the tomb and Philip‚Äôs lineage in a 1925 article published in The Times of London. The restoration of the grave was carried out by the British Pro-Jerusalem Society headed by Storrs. At that time the tombstone was re-set slightly below the level of the courtyard pavement but left visible through a protective metal grating. Today the slab lies in exactly the same spot, but hidden from view by a well-worn wooden hatch. Succession As Philip left no legitimate children, his estate in South Petherton and a majority of his Lincolnshire lands were granted to his nephew, Ralph d'Aubigny, the brother of Philip the younger.  Family  Philip d'Aubigny was the son of Ralph d'Aubigny and Sybil Valoignes, and grandson of William d'Aubigny. He was of brother of Oliver d'Aubigny, Alice d'Aubigny, John d'Aubigny, Gunnora de Gaunt, William De Stuteville, Matilda d'Aubigney, Ralph d'Aubigny and Elias d'Aubeny Oliver d'Aubigny married the widow of the leading royalist Philip of Oldcoates in 1221, and later bequeathed land at Enderby in Leicestershire upon his death to the canons of Croxton Abbey, where he was buried. Philip d'Aubigny was the cousin of William d'Albigny, one of the twenty-five executors of Magna Carta in 1215. The d'Aubigny lands of Ingleby and South Petherton remained under their families possession until 1554, when they were granted to John Bourchier, earl of Bath.

However, this didn't bother king Khosrow I (r. 531-579), who in 534 appointed Gregory as the commander of the Sasanian army in the Caucasus. This resulted in discontent amongst members of the court, who pressured Khosrow to deal with an apostate from such a powerful and influential family, stating that \\"It is a great dishonor for the religion of the Magians that such a great man from the lineage of the house of Mihran, who have always been servants of Ohrmazd, now becomes a servant of Christ.\\" Khosrow was thus forced to have Gregory relieved and incarcerated, yet the Mihranids demeed Khosrow's choice insufficient. A son of Gregory's paternal uncle, Mihran, asked Khosrow to execute Gregory for \\"bringing dishonor to our lineage.\\" The latter was in a good position to make such request, due to recently having defeated the Hephthalites in the east; Gregory was eventually executed.

III, c. 30), formally titled An Act for supplying some Defects in the Laws for the Relief of the Poor of this Kingdom, was a 1697 welfare statute, operating within the framework of the Act for the Relief of the Poor 1601, also called the Elizabethan Poor Act. This Act is perhaps best remembered for its expansion of the requirement that welfare recipients be marked to indicate their status, in this case by wearing a prominent badge. Badging the poor This Act required that all welfare recipients, including the wife and children of the head of a household receiving welfare, wear badges prominently on their right shoulders. These badges would contain the first letter of their parish name, followed by the letter \\"P\\". Thus, a recipient from Ampthill parish would wear a badge reading \\"AP\\". In her Curious Punishments of Bygone Days, Alice Morse Earle noted that this practice was also seen in Colonial America, though the badge format might be different. For instance, a badge for a New York pauper would read \\"N.Y.\\", while in Virginia, the badge might contain the parish name rather than an abbreviation, and in other cases might simply read \\"P.P.\\" for \\"public pauper\\". A similar law also existed in Pennsylvania. This badging practice was distinct from the earlier practice of issuing beggars' badges, which predated the Elizabethan Poor Act. One Act which authorized this was the 1555 Poor Act, 2 & 3 Ph. & M., c. 5. An earlier statute, 3 Will. & Mary, c. 11, required the overseers of the poor to record the names of all those receiving welfare in their parishes. This statute was intended to limit abuse of funds by overseers. The 1697 Act added the badging requirement for the same reason. The penalty to paupers who did not wear badges was whipping and imprisonment, and overseers providing relief to such paupers were to be fined 20 shillings. One change to the badge requirement came with the Relief of the Poor Act 1782 (also called Gilbert's Act), which allowed \\"paupers of good character\\" to leave off the badge. Badging continued to be practiced until 1810, when it was repealed by 50 Geo. III, c. 52, though by the end of the 18th century it was noted as \\"almost universally neglected\\". The badge continued to be thought of as a means of checking what is now called a welfare trap or poverty trap, wherein people prefer receiving benefits than working. One report ordered by the House of Commons of England suggested that temporarily restoring the badge would serve to dissuade such individuals from seeking out relief. The report further argued that \\"the Poor ought to know and feel that the eye of the public is upon them ready to check fraud and restrain importunity\\", and that the badge was one such means. Charles Jerram, an evangelical priest of the Church of England, did not go so far as to call for the revival of the badge, but did call for some means by which to distinguish \\"the profligate pauper from the unfortunate and virtuous sufferer\\". Joseph Townsend, on the other hand, harshly criticized the badging practice as applying a badge of shame on the poor in exchange for relief. He further noted that many overseers disregarded the badge requirement, risking the fine. Townsend also argued that the badge had no real effect on those who it was truly seeking to dissuade from seeking out relief, for they would have no qualms about wearing the badge, while the more modest poor \\"would sooner die than wear it\\". Year's service rule Part of the system involved the determination of what parish to which a recipient belonged, and was thereby responsible to provide relief to that recipient. Under the earlier Poor Relief Act 1662, also known as the Settlement Act, a parish could banish those poor unable to rent lodgings of at least ¬£10 per year within forty days of their arrival in the parish. Those banished this way would be sent back to their parish of birth, or where they had resided in the prior three years. The 1697 Act provided that a worker remaining \\"in the same service\\" for one year was given the right to settle in the parish, and thereafter would not be subject to expulsion when beginning to draw relief. The specifics required to gain settlement under this provision were explored in a number of cases. For instance, in R v Ulverstone, a woman servant was discharged from her contract to serve from Whitsuntide one year until the next year‚Äîa period of greater than 365 days that year‚Äîbefore its end, but after 365 days had elapsed. The Court held that despite being discharged before the end of the contract, she had served for one full year and was entitled to settle in the parish. Another aspect of this rule is how \\"same service\\" is determined. It was possible for the circumstances, such as the contract of hiring, the master, or even the location to change to some degree without resetting the one year requirement. For example, in R v Overton, a servant was engaged from March until Michaelmas, and then hired for a full year. Said servant left in April‚Äîless than one year into the contract, but more than one year since he was first engaged. The court held that the two periods of service could be connected, and the servant was entitled settlement rights under the Poor Law.

He is several times quoted and mentioned by Pliny the Elder, who considered him the greatest authority on his subjects. Life and identity By Pliny's account Castor lived more than a hundred years, in perfect health both of body and mind,Pliny the Elder, Natural History 25.5 though he was apparently deceased at the time of Pliny's writing. Some scholars have suggested that the longevity attributed to ancient physicians is merely a literary trope, and that Castor may not have actually lived as long as Pliny says. Castor is possibly the same man as the Antonius who was called by Galen \\"the herbalist\\", though is unlikely to be the same as Antonius Musa. He may have been a freedman of the triumvir Mark Antony. Botanical garden Castor possessed a vast botanical garden, which is probably the earliest on record, though there is some debate whether an earlier garden cultivated by Aristotle, and afterwards Theophrastus, at the Lyceum was ordered and scientific enough to be considered \\"botanical\\". However it is believed that Antonius Castor remains the earliest known example of the intentional cultivation of plants for medical purposes in Europe (as opposed to the collection of wild plants for this purpose). This garden was significant in that it allowed Castor and fellow scientists like Pliny to encounter up close what they might have only read about in rare scientific texts, which might be vague in their botanical descriptions, and largely lacked illustration. In the 16th century, German botanist Hieronymus Bock cited Castor as an example of why illustrations in botanical texts were of low value: the pioneers in the field would simply grow their own examples, and only needed illustrations of the very rarest specimens. (Other scholars have suggested that Bock was simply trying to justify omitting illustrations in order to keep the cost of his books down.) Remedies Several of Castor's recommendations for herbal remedies are known. He suggested fennel root (ferula) to improve vision, the root of potamogiton (possibly Hippuris vulgaris) to fight goitre, and one of the two varieties of horehound (Ballota spp. and Marrubium vulgare) for abscesses and dog bites.
