It is the case of authors as Xos√© Gil (Miss Ledyia, 1916) or Jos√© Signo (La tragedia de Xirobio, 1930).

The design is consistently based around gules, a fess humette, surrounded by three trestles argent (sometimes or). Variants include colour of fess and trestles, and number of trestles. In heraldry the trestle (also tressle, tressel and threstle) as a charge is extremely rare, and known for symbolising hospitality (as historically the trestle was a tripod used both as a stool and a table support). The fess humette is apparently intended to represent a banqueting table, with the trestles gathered around.Guillim, John. \\"A Display of Heraldry\\" 1724 Roundel File:Stratford type A Rondel 1.jpegOr, a fess gules, between three torteaux File:Stratford type A Rondel 2.jpegArgent, a fess gules, between three bezants File:Stratford type A Rondel 3.jpegIrish Argent, a fess between three hawks heads erased, gules File:Stratford type A Rondel 4.jpegGules, a fess argent, between three plates File:Stratford type A Rondel 5.jpegSable, a fess argent, between three plates File:Stratford type A Rondel 6.jpegPer fess gules and sable, three plates The Roundel type is associated solely with the medieval Bishops, and appears to be an archaic, simplified or corrupted version of the Trestle type.

The exact relationship to the arms of Luxembourg and of Lusignan are unknown, if indeed any exists at all. Both bear (with some variation in number) a barruly of ten Argent and Azure, and both have a lion rampant gules - though often on these royal arms it is granted a crown (or), and the lion of Luxembourg bears a forked tail as difference. The similarity is too close to be dismissed satisfactorily as independent coincidence, and historians have generated various theories as to the connection between the houses and the arms, none conclusive.P√©port√©, Pit. \\"Constructing the Middle Ages: Historiography, Collective Memory and Nation- Building in Luxembourg\\" pp 80-93.

The block's setting is based on a mix of cultures of Central and East Asia.  Storyline  =Khans of Tarkir= The plane of Tarkir was once dominated by dragons, but in a massive war over a thousand years ago, humans succeeded at wiping them out. Today Tarkir is a battle-torn realm where five clans feud for supremacy. As presented in Khans of Tarkir, the five clans focus on \\"wedges\\", or sets of three colors that are rooted in two colors and one \\"enemy\\" color across from it. Each wedge is the colors of a clan of warriors that venerate a certain quality of the dragon, and an anatomical feature that represents it. The clans also make use of the \\"Morph\\" mechanic, returning from the Onslaught block, which allows creatures to be cast face- down as 2/2 creatures and turned right-side up for additional cost, and occasionally additional benefit; this magic is described as being an invention of the extinct dragons, now adapted to human needs. The clans, and their khans, are as follows: *The Abzan Houses (White, Black, Green) see endurance as the most important quality of the dragon, and use the scale to show that. Their mechanic is \\"Outlast,\\" which allows them to permanently strengthen themselves by tapping. The clan is led by Anafenza, called \\"The Foremost,\\" known for leading from the front. *The Jeskai Way (Blue, Red, White) prefer the cunning nature of the dragon, and represent themselves with the eye. In Khans of Tarkir, the clan is led by Narset, the Enlightened Master who speaks of other worlds than Tarkir alone. Their mechanic is \\"Prowess,\\" which gives creatures temporary bonuses every time the player casts a non-creature spell. *The Sultai Brood (Black, Green, Blue) make themselves ruthless like the dragon, and see the fang as its most ruthless part. Their mechanic is \\"Delve,\\" which allows the player to lessen the mana costs of spells by exiling cards from the graveyard. They are led by Sidisi, Brood Tyrant, a powerful naga necromancer who considers herself queen of the clan. *The Mardu Horde (Red, White, Black) views speed as the greatest aspect, and use the wings to represent that. Their mechanic is \\"Raid,\\" which provides bonuses if the player attacked this turn. In Khans of Tarkir, the clan is led by Zurgo Helmsmasher, a savage orc who has a vendetta against Sarkhan Vol. *The Temur Frontier (Green, Blue, Red) believe in the dragon's savagery, and use the claw as their symbol. Their mechanic is \\"Ferocious,\\" which provides bonuses if the player controls at least one creature with 4 power or greater. In Khans of Tarkir, the clan is led by Surrak Dragonclaw, a mighty man renowned for punching a bear. =Fate Reforged= Tarkir is the birthplace of the dragon-worshipping planeswalker Sarkhan Vol, first introduced in Shards of Alara. At the beginning of the Khans set, Sarkhan returns to Tarkir and learns that the extinction of Tarkir's dragons was linked to one specific event. Some thousand years ago, there was an epic battle between two dragon planeswalkers: Nicol Bolas, one of the greatest manipulators in the multiverse, and Ugin the Spirit Dragon, who helped trap the Eldrazi on Zendikar. Now that the Eldrazi have arisen again, both Sarkhan and Sorin Markov have arrived on Tarkir, the last known location of Ugin, in search of his help. Discovering that Ugin is dead, Sarkhan resolves to travel back in time and save him. His travels in the Tarkir of 1,280 years ago are chronicled in the set Fate Reforged. He finds a world where the five human clans do not fight each other, instead fending off constant attacks from Tarkir's many dragons; the clans still model themselves on a particular quality, which is epitomized by a Legendary Dragon creature whom each clan reveres and strives to emulate. The set focuses more on the color at the center of each wedge and its ally, with the enemy color given very little presence. The dragons who serve as the inspiration for each clan have their own watermarks, which are modified versions of the clan sigil. Additionally, Morph is missing; instead, a mechanic which is described as being Morph's precursor, \\"Manifest,\\" allows players to put any card face-down as a 2/2 creature, and flip them again only if their obverse was a creature to begin with. * The Abzan Houses (White, Black, Green) are led by Daghatar the Adamant, an aloof and analytical leader. They revere Dromoka, the Eternal. In the past, their mechanic is \\"Bolster,\\" which lets players strengthen the weakest of their creatures. * The Jeskai Way (Blue, White, Red) are led by Shu Yun, the Silent Tempest, who seeks to preserve knowledge. They revere Ojutai, Soul of Winter. They retain the Prowess mechanic. * The Sultai Brood (Black, Green, Blue) are led by Tasigur, the Golden Fang, an indolent and spoiled prince. They revere Silumgar, the Drifting Death. They retain the Delve mechanic. * The Mardu Horde (Red, White, Black) are led by Alesha, Who Smiles At Death, a transgender warrior who managed to negotiate a position as equals for her clan. They revere Kolaghan, the Storm's Fury. In the past, their mechanic is \\"Dash,\\" which allows players to cast creatures at reduced mana cost, but with the added corollary that the creature must return to hand at the end of the turn. * The Temur Frontier (Green, Blue, Red) are led by Yasova Dragonclaw (all Temur khans take the title \\"Dragonclaw\\"), Sarkhan Vol's first friend in the past, who dreams of a world where the humans of Tarkir are no longer prey to dragons. They revere Atarka, World Render. They retain the Ferocious mechanic. =Dragons of Tarkir= Sarkhan Vol is successful at preventing Ugin's death, though Ugin is forced to retreat into a hibernative state to recuperate. Satisfied, Sarkhan travels back into the \\"present day.\\" But the Tarkir he finds, as chronicled in Dragons of Tarkir, is drastically changed. The eponymous dragons, no longer extinct, have proliferated, and are now on the verge of wiping out all other life; in particular, the five god- dragons worshiped by the clans are now the leaders of those clans, with the human (or humanoid) characters who led them in the original timeline serving in other roles. In this new future, each of the clans focuses on allied pairs, with the enemy colors of the original wedges abandoned entirely; likewise, each clan retains the modified watermark of their dragonlords, first introduced in the previous set. Morph returns as \\"Megamorph\\"; the two mechanics are identical except that creatures with Megamorph gain a +1/+1 counter when flipped. Dragons also creates the peculiar structure of Tarkir Block drafts: Fate Reforged is designed to be drafted with either Dragons or Khans, but the two large sets, representing alternate timelines, are not intended to be drafted together. To that end, Dragons retains the two altered clan mechanics from FRF and replaces the three that remained. * The Dromoka Brood (Green, White) is what the Abzan Houses have become. Dragonlord Dromoka leads and they retain the Bolster mechanic from Fate Reforged. Anafenza, no longer their leader, was martyred for apostatic religious beliefs, but lives on as a ghost associated with a spirit tree. * The Ojutai Brood (Blue, White) is what the Jeskai Way have become. Dragonlord Ojutai leads and their mechanic, new to the Tarkir block but returning from Rise of the Eldrazi, is \\"Rebound,\\" which lets spells re-occur at the beginning of the player's next turn. Narset, their former leader, has ignited her planeswalker spark, and is one of the two planeswalkers in the set (the other being an alternate version of Sarkhan Vol). * The Silumgar Brood (Blue, Black) is what the Sultai Brood have become. Dragonlord Silumgar leads and their mechanic is \\"Exploit.\\" When a creature with Exploit enters the battlefield, the player may sacrifice a pre- existing creature to gain extra benefits from the Exploiting creature. Their former leader, Sidisi, exists as an undead thrall to Silumgar. * The Kolaghan Brood (Red, Black) is what the Mardu Horde have become. Dragonlord Kolaghan leads and they retain the Dash mechanic from Fate Reforged. Their former leader, Zurgo, has been reduced to a mere ceremonial bellringer, and is often bullied by his clan. * The Atarka Brood (Green, Red) is what the Temur Frontier have become. Dragonlord Atarka leads and their mechanic is \\"Formidable,\\" which provides bonuses if the controlling player controls with total power 8 or higher. Surrak, their former leader, serves as the brood's Hunt Caller, in charge of feeding Atarka and renowned for punching a dragon. Sorin Markov, arriving at the altered version of Tarkir, awakens Ugin from his hibernation. Ugin agrees to help fend off the Eldrazi, though he insists that first he and Sorin seek out Nahiri, the Lithomancer, a planeswalker who helped him seal the Eldrazi away the first time. Sarkhan, meanwhile, learns that he is the only person who remembers the version of Tarkir where he himself was born, and consultation with both Ugin and Narset reveals that, in this continuity, no Sarkhan Vol ever was born. Though both he and Narset are capable of planeswalking anywhere else in the multiverse, both decide to remain on Tarkir.  Mechanics  Khans of Tarkir features a number of new mechanics as well as two returning mechanics (Morph and Delve): *Prowess: An ability that gives the creature +1/+1 until end of turn when non-creature spells are cast by their controller. This is the Jeskai mechanic. It later became an evergreen mechanic. *Raid: An ability that activates if a creature is summoned after creatures attack in a player's second main phase. This is the Mardu mechanic. *Outlast: Allows players to place counters on creatures as a sorcery. This is the Abzan mechanic. *Ferocious: Allows players to do different effects when they control a creature with power 4 or greater. This is the Temur mechanic. *Delve: Allows players to exile cards from the graveyard to reduce casting cost, similar to how the Convoke ability uses tapped creatures.

Although the crowned eagle's long tail imparts an overall length up to , it is somewhat less massive and has a considerably shorter wingspan than Africa's largest eagle, the martial eagle (Polemaetus bellicosus). It is nevertheless considered Africa's most powerful eagle when measured in terms of the weight of its prey items. It often preys on mammals such as bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus), exceptionally weighing up to albeit usually much less.Ferguson-Lees & Christie (2001). Raptors of the World. The crowned eagle possesses unusually large talons and strong legs, and may kill by crushing the skull. The eagle is also ferocious; some records from beneath a nest show the remains of a large, male Sooty mangabey weighing . Due to their ecological similarities, the crowned eagle is Africa's best analogue of the harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja). Thanks to its bold and highly conspicuous behavior, it is exceptionally well-studied for a large, forest-dwelling eagle. Due to a relatively high level of habitat adaptability, it was until recently considered to be faring well by the standards of large, forest-dependent raptors.Dowsett-Lemaire, F. & Dowsett, R.J. The Birds of Malawi: An Atlas and Handbook. 2006, Tauraco Press and Aves, Li√®ge, Belgium. 556 pages However, today it is generally thought that it is decreasing far more than was previously perceived due to the almost epidemic destruction of native tropical African forest. It is now listed by the IUCN as Near Threatened.  Taxonomy and systematics  An adult crowned eagle in flight. This species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in the 12th edition of Systema Naturae, published in 1766, as Falco coronatus. Since birds were grouped largely on superficial characteristics at that time, many unrelated species were grouped by Linnaeus in the genus Falco. The actual taxonomic alignment of the crowned eagle is apparent due to its feathering over its tarsus, which is generally rare in unrelated accipitrids. The crowned eagle is actually part of the diverse \\"booted eagle\\" group, which has sometimes been considered a distinct subfamily (Aquilinae). Included in this grouping are the genus Aquila and all species described as \\"hawk eagles\\" including the genera Spizaetus and Nisaetus. Other assorted monotypical genera included amongst \\"booted eagles\\" are Lophaetus, Polemaetus, Lophotriorchis and Ictinaetus. At one time, the genus Stephanoaetus was considered a \\"specialized offshoot\\" of the Spizaetus hawk- eagles based on morphological attributes.Eagles, Hawks and Falcons of the World by Leslie Brown & Dean Amadon. The Wellfleet Press (1986), . DNA sequences utilizing one mitochondrial and three nuclear genes indicated the crowned eagle is a sister species to the Asian hawk-eagles, which are now considered a separate genus, Nisaetus, that are not closely related to the neotropical hawk-eagles, which are retained in Spizaetus. Pdf However, another recent study, this time of sequences of two mitochondrial and one nuclear genes, did not reveal a close relationship of this eagle to any other accipitrid, including the Nisaetus species, and the genus was found to be genetically highly divergent from other \\"booted\\" eagles\\". In a case of convergent evolution, the much heavier harpy eagle, which is outside of the \\"booted eagle\\" group, has a similar skeletal morphology to the crowned eagle. Two less well-known, probably distantly related species, the mountain hawk- eagle (Nisaetus nipalensis) and the black-and-chestnut eagle (Spizaetus isidori), have also been found comparable to the crowned eagle. While both are slimmer and smaller, these eagles are also large-bodied, strong-footed offshoots of the evolutionary radiation of forest-dwelling booted eagles, respectively distributed in East Asia and South America. The adult crowned eagle even has somewhat intermediate appearance between these birds, sharing the variable patterning of the mountain hawk-eagle and some of the colouring of the black-and-chestnut. Until possibly up to 1500, another crowned eagle species, the Malagasy crowned eagle (S. mahery) existed. Similar in size and form to the extant crowned eagle, the Malagasy crowned eagle probably filled a similar niche in Madagascar, but was likely to have preyed on lemurs in place of monkeys. Apparently, the Malagasy crowned eagle became extinct due mainly to the loss of prey and habitat change, attributable to early humans on the island.Goodman, S. M., Rasoloarison, R. M., & Ganzhorn, J. U. (2004). On the specific identification of subfossil Cryptoprocta (Mammalia, Carnivora) from Madagascar. Zoosystema 26(1), 129‚Äì143.Bustamante, J. S24. 3: Ecological factors affecting hunting behaviour during the post-fledging dependence period of raptors. To date, the living crowned eagle has no recognized subspecies. However, Simon Thomsett noted from field experience possible racial differences between crowned eagles in limited woodland habitats in East and South Africa (called by him the \\"bush eagles\\"), which have historically been the main populations studied, and those that live in denser West African rainforest, in the central part of the species distribution. The latter population, he noted, appeared smaller but relatively larger footed, seemed chestier in build and appeared to have deeper eyebrows than the bush eagle; behaviorally the rainforest eagles seemed bolder and louder, which is reinforced in other accounts of the species.

Robert's Birds of Southern Africa, 6th Edition. Cape Town: John Voelecker Bird Book Fund. with a claim of wingspans of up to needing confirmation. This eagle's wingspan is quite short for the bird's size, being around the same mean width as that of a tawny eagle (Aquila rapax) or a short-toed snake eagle (Circaetus gallicus), species that weigh about half as much as a crowned eagle. However, the somewhat boxy and rounded wings are quite broad, being broader than, for example, the much longer-winged golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos).Brown, L. 1976. Eagles of the World. David and Charles, . The wing morphology of the species gives it maneuverability in its densely wooded environment. The wing chord measures , with a median of in males and in females. While it, on average, is less heavy and has a smaller wingspan than the often sympatric martial eagle, its average total length exceeds that of the martial eagle thanks to its much longer tail. The crowned eagle's tail is from long, with a median of in males and in females. The bill is of a medium size relative to its body size, with one large museum specimen's bill measuring in length from the gape, in culmen length and in bill depth. A zoo-kept adult crowned eagle in Hungary illustrates its formidable talons. The tarsus is of a modest length for a raptor of its size, at , and is clearly shorter than that of martial eagle. However, the feet and legs are visibly thicker and heavier than those of the martial eagle and the talons are apparently quite massive in both length and width. While no comprehensive measurements of the talon size of wild crowned eagles are known, one female museum specimen reportedly had a hallux-claw (or hind claw, which is the largest talon on accipitrids) of , while another female was measured at 5 years of age, the age of sexual maturity, in the hallux-claw and an adult male measured .Prout-Jones, D. V., & Kemp, A. G. (1997). Moult, plumage sequence and maintenance behaviour of a captive male and female crowned eagle, Stephanoaetus coronatus (Aves: Accipitridae). Annals of the Transvaal Museum, 36(Part 19). These figures put their talon size as around the same size as the largest golden eagles and close to those of a mid-sized harpy eagle. Some captive crowned eagles have been credited with a hallux-claw length of up to , although, much like a single report of captive harpy eagles with a hallux-claw, no such outsized talons are known to have been confirmed. In a small sampling of large, forest- dwelling raptors, the front-left talon of the crowned eagle, at , was around one cm less than that of a harpy eagle or the huge, recently extinct Haast's eagle (Harpagornis moorei) and slightly smaller than those of the Philippine eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi).Worthy, T.H. & Holdaway, R.N. 2002. The Lost World of the Moa: Prehistoric Life of New Zealand. Indiana University Press, . Considering a big female of these species can weigh up to twice as much as an average crowned eagle may illustrate the relative largeness of the crowned eagle's talons. The adult crowned eagle is quite strikingly plumaged. Its crown is dark to rufous-tinged brown with a prominent, oft-raised black-tipped double crest, which can give the head a somewhat triangular appearance. The upperparts of an adult are a blackish brown-grey color, with a variable tinge of blue. The throat is brown while the belly and breast are white overlaid densely with blackish bars and blotches, variably marked with cream or rich buff-rufous coloration. The wing primaries are white at the base, broadly tipped with black and crossed by two black bars. The tail is black with brownish-grey bands. The thighs and legs are barred and closely spotted with black and white. The underwing coverts of adults have a bold chestnut coloration, spotted lightly with black. The adult crowned eagle has eyes that can range from yellow to almost white, a cere and feet of an ochre-yellow color and black talons. In the wild, misidentification of an adult is improbable thanks to the species' bearing and voice. The strongly barred outer wings and tail are all diagnostic in flight. Further simplifying identification, details such as the crest, the bird's upright perching posture and large size are unique to this animal. While they do differ somewhat in size, the genders' sexual dimorphism by size is relatively modest and eagles are unlikely to be sexed by this alone. However, the male may be distinguished by his more rapid wing beats (4 or 5 per second) from the more sluggish female (3 or 4 per second). As seen in about half of the \\"booted eagle\\" group, the juvenile crowned eagle has strikingly different looking plumage compared to the adults. Much variation occurs as the maturation process occurs. A great majority of juveniles have a white head and underside, which contrast with the thighs and legs, which are heavily spotted with black. The juvenile eagle's back is light brown or grayish-brown, with pale feather edgings that often give the back a scaled appearance, especially on the upper-wing coverts. There is often a pinkish red wash on the upper chest.Brown, L. H., & Pommery, D. E. (1984). The age structure of populations of wild birds in tropical Africa as demonstrated by plumage characters and marking techniques. In Proceedings of the V Pan-African Ornithological Congress (pp. 97‚Äì119). Just-fledged chicks tend have dark patched faces, freckled bibs and slightly barred chests and spotted legs. Less common juvenile crowned eagle plumages, possible even when they are under a year of age and still under parental care, may include eagles so stripy that they which one could easily have aged as two- to three-year- olds. The tail of the juvenile is black with three pale bars and a narrow black tip. The juvenile eagle's cere is grey and the feet are dull yellow. By 4 months post-fledgling, the inner thighs, previously poorly covered with downy type feathers, are covered with small feathers. While the pale 'morph' young just prior to leaving the nest usually have unmarked tarsus, they soon get spots on the front part of the tibio tarsal joint. The tibio tarsal pad is still bare and obvious up until it is a year old, whereupon it vanishes only to return to incubating females. Eye color is variable too with some having khaki light brown just prior to fledging and others with adult-like yellow ochre eyes. Up to 15 months after leaving the nest, the immature eagles more closely resemble the plumage they have at first independence than the adult's plumage. The juvenile may be confused with the similarly colored juvenile martial eagle, especially in flight. It is distinguished from the martial species in having a much longer, more heavily barred tail, much shorter wings and spotted thighs. Distribution and habitat Humid Congolian forests along the Dja River, typical habitat near the center of the crowned eagle's range The crowned eagle is found only on the continent of Africa. In East Africa, the crowned eagle's range extends from central Ethiopia, to Uganda, forested parts of Kenya and Tanzania to as far south as eastern South Africa, with a southern distribution limit around Knysna. In western and central Africa, the crowned eagle's range extends through much of the (once) vast African rainforest. They may be found from Senegal, The Gambia, Sierra Leone and Cameroon, where they inhabit the Guinean forests, to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where they live in the Congolian forests, and down south to as far Angola. Despite its large distribution there, the crowned eagle is now rare in many parts of West Africa. The crowned eagle inhabits mainly dense woodlands, including those deep within rainforest, but will sometimes also be found in relict patches, wooded escarpments, riparian strips of Acacia, heavily wooded hillsides, and rocky outcrops throughout its range. The crowned eagle may be found from an altitude of sea-level to at least . Owing to lack of current suitable habitat, the eagle's range is often somewhat discontinuous. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the crowned eagle has been confirmed to survive at relatively high densities in protected areas that maintain dense, old-growth rainforests. In Kenya, 84% of the crowned eagles range is within rainforest with an annual rainfall amount of more than .Lewis, A. & Pomeroy, D. A Bird Atlas of Kenya. CRC Press (1989), . Around stretches of East Africa where protected areas mostly consist of fairly open habitat, crowned eagles usually live in wooded areas of rocky hills and narrow riverine strips, only rarely ranging into savanna surrounding the hills. Southern Africa has been subject to the most comprehensive study of crowned eagle habitat, largely since many areas there would seem inhospitable to a large raptor often associated with old-growth forest.Oatley, T.B., Oschadleus, H.D., Navarro, R.A. and Underhill, L.G. 1998. Review of ring recoveries of birds of prey in southern Africa: 1948‚Äì1998. Johannesburg: Endangered Wildlife Trust. In southern Africa, its distribution south of the Limpopo River coincides largely with montane forest, although it is not restricted to that habitat and may range secondarily into plantations, usually of eucalyptus. In South Africa, it occurs in both lowland and montane evergreen forest, dense woodland, and forested ravines and gorges in open savannas and thornveld.Boshoff, A.F. 1997. Crowned Eagle. Pp. 194‚Äì195 in J.A. Harrison et al. (eds.), The atlas of South African birds. Volume 1: Non-passerines. BirdLife South Africa and Avian Demography Unit, Johannesburg, South Africa. In Zimbabwe, the crowned eagle can be found in quite open woods with Adansonia trees and may occasionally forage in savanna and secondary growth. In Malawi, highland birds forage in lower miombo woodland, and lower altitudes, breeding occurs in deciduous forest, more locally in dense miombo, tall riparian woodlands, and in remnants close to cultivation. Crowned eagles in Zambezi, occurs in evergreen forest in the eastern highlands, in rugged, hilly terrain over the central plateau, in hills and escarpments in the southeastern portions of the central watershed, and in riparian habitat along the larger rivers.Irwin, M. P. S. 1981. The birds of Zimbabwe. Quest Publishing, Salisbury, Zimbabwe. Behavior A crowned eagle flying over its territory in Budongo, western Uganda Typical of most raptors that breed in Africa, the crowned eagle is non-migratory and is largely sedentary. This species usually inhabits a fixed territory throughout the year during its adult life. There is evidence that the birds move about to some degree when circumstances require it, for example when they need to change mates in isolated breeding areas. The greatest movement of any notable distance is usually associated with juvenile birds, which wander relatively widely before maturation.Bildstein, K.L. 2006. Migrating raptors of the world: their ecology and conservation. Cornell University Press, Ithaca, NY. Forty-four birds of various ages that were ringed in southern Africa and recovered were all found near the ringing localities. Small movements by crowned eagles has resulted in them being sighted in improbable habitats, such as on an open savanna hill in Kenya, an open river bed in Lewa Wildlife Conservancy and even a golf course in Nairobi. The crowned eagle is highly vocal and has a noisy, undulating display flight. In Equatorial Africa, they often call year-around, while elsewhere they may vocalize mainly in the context of breeding and nesting activities. The call is a series of loud whistles that rise and fall in pitch. The male performs an elaborate rise-and-fall display over the forest canopy both during the breeding season and outside it as a territorial proposition. Usually, territorial displays, which outnumber breeding displays, occur around the periphery of the bird's home range while breeding displays are likely to be over or at least near the nest. Displays consists of a series of steep dives and ascents, with a few wing-flaps at the top of each climb and descending circles and figures of eight. During descents, eagles can drop as much as at a time before circling back up. During this display, the male is noisy, uttering a shrill kewee-kewee-kewee while throwing his head back, often calling for a spell of approximately 30 seconds. The displaying male may reach heights exceeding , sometimes even near cloud level at over above the ground. The adult female may also perform independent display flights, uttering a lower kooee-kooee-kooee. The female seems to display less often and tends to have a mellower voice. Pairs also perform visually striking mutual displays, sometimes arising from the first type or when the pairs come together after a brief absence. Spectacular tandems, interlocking talons and falling some distance from the sky are typical of mutual displays. Despite the spectacular and conspicuous nature of their display flights, the crowned eagle is sometimes considered a \\"clumsy\\" flier out in the open, lacking the grace and speed attributed to other eagles in a high-flying context, such as large Aquila species. While awaiting food at the nest, both the female and the young call out a penetrating, high kwee-kwee-kwee, that can border on incessant. In disposition, the crowned eagle is considered nervous, constantly alert and on edge. They are quite different from the oft-stately open country eagles such as the Aquila species. In their training and management, crowned eagles are perhaps more reminiscent of northern goshawks (Accipiter gentilis) than Aquila eagles. Some linkage has been made between forest-dwelling habits and having a curious and edgy disposition amongst various raptorial birds. Ironically considering their otherwise hyperactive behavior, the main hunting techniques of crowned eagle require long periods of inactivity, spent sitting on a perch. Mature crowned eagles are reportedly nearly fearless towards humans and, unless shy from prior interactions, unusually prone to treat humans aggressively. Crowned eagles can nest around developed areas, including in the vicinity of quite suburban, developed areas (such as in view of apartment or office buildings), so long as prey is abundant and accessible and the habitat provides enough mature vegetation to facilitate nest building and hunting activities. Some biologists consider this species highly intelligent, cautious, independent and inquisitive when compared to other accipitrids. In falconry, crowned eagles cannot be induced to direct their hunting instinct towards large prey by increasing their hunger, as is done with Aquila eagles, for example. In the context of human interaction, wild, adult crowned eagles are quite the opposite of the martial eagle, which are typically very wary and tends to shun any variety of human activity. However, young crowned eagles in their post-fledging stage differ greatly in behavior from independent or adult eagles. Amongst post-fledging eagles in a semi-captive state, it has been noted that they border on helpless in terms of feeding and defending themselves compared to other accipitrids and are even described as \\"cowardly\\", unwilling to even simulate attacking prey until many months after fledging. This implies a learning element occurs in wild crowned eagles during their exceptionally long post-fledging period. Crowned eagles are reportedly variable in temperament as individuals to a degree greater than that found in most other raptors. =Breeding= Crowned eagles have one of the most prolonged breeding cycles of any bird. It is common for raptors that live around the tropics to have a relatively elongated breeding period. Crowned eagle pairs breed once every two years; a single breeding cycle is approximately 500 days in duration. Most other eagle species complete a breeding cycle in under six months, or in about 35% of the time it takes the crowned eagle. While the incubation and nestling stages are about average for a tropical eagle (for example the black-breasted snake-eagle (Circaetus pectoralis), about half the weight of this species, has an incubation/nestling cycle of a similar length), it is the extraordinary post-fledging period of 9‚Äì11 months that makes the crowned eagles' breeding cycle so long. In harpy and Philippine eagle, although these are less extensively studied, it may take a similar or even longer amount of time for the young to attain full independence.Rettig, N. 1978. Breeding behavior of the Harpy Eagle (Harpia harpyja). Auk 95: 629‚Äì643.Delacour, J., E. Mayr. 1946. Birds of the Philippines. New York: The MacMillan Company. A case of crowned eagle pairs that reportedly bred every year in South Africa are unsubstantiated but may be due to an apparently high population loss rate among juvenile eagles near areas that are heavily populated by humans.Brown, L. H., Gargett, V., & Steyn, P. (1977). Breeding success in some African eagles related to theories about sibling aggression and its effects. Ostrich, 48(3‚Äì4), 65‚Äì71. Breeding can occur almost year-around throughout the range, though egg laying seems to peak roughly around the end of the African wet season or the early dry season, from July to November. Territories or home ranges are maintained vigorously. In Zimbabwe, individual home ranges can vary from in size. Near the city of Nelspruit in South Africa, home ranges averaged in size. In southern Africa, the mean distance between active nest sites can range from . After engaging in the breeding display described above, the pair collaborate in building a massive nest in a fork of a large forest tree, typically from above the ground. While the female fetches more nesting material, the male tends to be more active in nest construction. In East Africa, many nests appear to be close to a forest river.Maisels, F. G., Gautier, J. P., Cruickshank, A., & Bosefe, J. P. (1993). Attacks by crowned hawk eagles (Stephanoaetus coronatus) on monkeys in Zaire. Folia Primatologica, 61(3), 157‚Äì159. Generally, crowned eagles seem to be attracted to the taller trees in the forest. On the Nyika Plateau in Malawi, the favorite nesting trees are the large emergent Aningeria adolfi-friedericii and Chrysophyllum gorungosanum, and a pair in the Lower Shire used a Sterculia appendiculata tree. In Zimbabwe, Newtonia buchananii are reportedly one of the most used tree species for nesting. Exceptional crowned eagle nests have been observed on sheer cliff faces. In southern Africa, the species nest in drier and denuded terrain than expected such as Adansonia stands on semi-arid hillsides. Despite the relative sparseness of this habitat, these sites have a varied and convoluted terrain, with nooks and crannies, valleys, overhangs and hideaways that allow a crowned eagle to exercise its particular hunting skills. In Kenya, similar fractured landscapes can also be utilized by crowned eagles, such as the black gigantic volcanic rubble fields of Tsavo West National Park, the lower Chyulu Hills, Kibwezi and Soysambu Conservancy. These are jungles of boulders covered with low growth interspersed (in the past) with high trees. A nest built from scratch may take up to 5 months to construct, however existing nests are often repaired and re- used during successive breeding seasons, a process that can take as much as 3 months. It is typical for an eagle pair to use a nest for more than five years and, unlike several other booted eagles, crowned eagle pairs rarely build more than one nest for alternative use. Most large eagles build a very large nest and the crowned eagle is no exception, as it builds one of the largest nests of any eagle. In the first year they build a nest, it may measure across and deep. However, a larger nest, usually after several years of usage, may measure up to across and up to deep. The nest consists of both dead and greener branches and has a light coverage of leaves and animal matter. Copulation takes place in the nest, several times a day. Reportedly copulation can occur up to a year before laying, although these may be exceptional cases of mating for non-fertilization purposes (which, in other eagles, has been thought to be related mainly to strengthening pair bonds). A pre-copulation display typically occurs, wherein the male runs repeatedly around the crouching female with wings upraised, which displays the chestnut of the under-wing coverts and beautiful barring. In South Africa the crowned eagle lays its eggs from September to October; in Zimbabwe, it lays from May to October; mainly nearer to October around the Congo River; anywhere from June to November in Kenya, with a peak in August through October; in Uganda from December to July; and in West Africa, laying peaks in October. The clutch of the crowned eagle either contains 1 or 2 eggs. Often in East Africa, just one egg is laid. Eggs are usually just white, though may sometimes be overlaid with sparse red-brown markings. The eggs are moderate in size, averaging , with ranges of in length and in width. When a natural disaster befalls a nest, a replacement may be made in 2 months time. Incubation lasts for approximately 49 days. 80‚Äì90% of egg incubation is done by the female during the day. Food is mainly brought to the nest by the male in the early stages of breeding, though sometimes both sexes may deliver food. The male brings food to the incubating female every 3 to 5 days. When they initially hatch, the young tend to be quite quiet. If two eggs are laid, the younger one dies by starvation after being outcompeted for food by the older one or even directly killed by its older sibling. No nest of wild crowned eagles has been known to successfully produce more than one fledgling, though in captivity two have been known to survive with human assistance (supplementally feeding the younger chick or taking it out of the nest). In cases where the older nestling dies, the younger one may be fed more regularly and survive. After hatching, the male kill rate rises to one kill every 1.5 days. Pair behavior while raising chicks is very variable, some males are very attentive to their young, while others leave virtually all brooding to the female. After 40 days of age, the young is capable of feeding itself, though is often still fed. The first feathers through the white down emerge when the crowned eagle chick is 40 days old, with the feathers ultimately covering the down in 76 days. After 76 days, the main feather development is in the tail or the wings. Wing flapping begins at 45 to 50 days, increasing after around 75 days. The young fledge at 90 to 115 days, with an average 110.6 days and any period of time less than 100 days is considered unusually soon. On average, male chicks tend to be more active wing-flappers and usually will first fly around 10 days earlier than female chicks. After fledging, females are attentive 95% of the day and brood 50‚Äì75% of the day, the amount decreasing slightly with each day. The female does much of the prey capture and a majority of the nest defense after the young fledge. After fledging, the young remain in the neighborhood of the parent's nest and are fed every 3 to 5 days by either parent for their first 270‚Äì350 days of life. The rate of food-delivery varies from several times a day to every 3 days on average during the post-fledging period. The fledged juvenile will solicit adults (apparently even unrelated adults) for food but does not actually take the prey unless this occurs around the nest site. The first recorded kill for a young crowned occurred 61 days after fledging, although this is considered exceptionally early by the standards of this species. Flights increase incrementally through the post-fledging period, although the young do not engage in rising flights until they are fully independent. Independence appears to be triggered by the increased indifference of parents to bringing food. Due to the loud vocal interplay between the parents and the fledging eagle, the adults seem to take it as a sign that their offspring has sought independence if they return to the nesting area and hear no begging auditory response. The young eagle usually remains in the care of its parents for a total of up to 11 months after it fledges, longer than is known in almost any other raptor. The advantage of this prolonged stretch to independence is that it may make for a stronger young eagle when compared to other accipitrids which have almost no post-fledging dependency period. In 34 possible cases, 18 resulted in eggs being laid. Fledging success is approximately 83% and almost all young that leave the nest also reach independence. It is estimated that most crowned eagles will reach breeding maturity at around five years old, as is typical for other large eagle species. Dietary biology The crowned eagle is a powerful predator of monkeys. The crowned eagle is often described as the most powerful raptor in Africa, even more so than the two slightly heavier species endemic to Africa, the martial eagle and the Verreaux's eagle (Aquila verreauxii).Steyn, P. 1982. Birds of prey of southern Africa: their identification and life histories. David Phillip, Cape Town, South Africa. One listing included the crowned eagle as the only bird in a ranking of the 10 strongest living land creatures (pound for pound). Elsewhere, the harpy eagle is listed as the overall most powerful living eagle and bird of prey.Schulenberg, T.S. (2009) Harpy eagle (Harpia harpyja). In: Schulenberg, T.S. (Ed.) Neotropical Birds Online. Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Ithaca. Since there are no known actual tests in any African raptor of the pressure per square inch (PSI) exerted via their grip, as has been done with some other large eagles, their power has extrapolated from the size of the feet and talons and from the prey they typically select. In deep forest, an adult eagle may cover a hunting range of up to , with the home ranges being smaller for those that inhabit rocky hills and cliffs abounding in hyraxes. Eagles start hunting soon after dawn and mainly kill early in the morning and in the evening prior to sundown. Being a forest-dwelling species, the crowned eagle has no need to travel great distances to hunt, nor employ a great deal of active hunting flight (such as soaring seen in savannah-dwelling species). Rather, it tends to hunt passively. Crowned eagles may locate a suitable hunting spot by listening (such as via the call of the noisy vervet monkey) or watching for prey activity, though may also use habitual hunting perches where they've previously had hunting successes. Although this behavior is unconfirmed, some crowned eagles have been reported to let out a soft whistle unlike their other vocalizations which, for some reason, is attractive to monkeys and will then attack the first monkey to enter their line of sight. These eagles often still-hunt, wherein they drop or stoop onto prey from a branch perch. Following the sighting of suitable prey, the eagle quickly and stealthily maneuvers itself through the forest towards its prey, a certain element of surprise inherent in its final approach. A majority of the crowned eagles kills are made on the forest floor. Arboreal prey may be forced to the ground during an attack. The sharp, powerful talons may produce sufficient force to kill the prey on impact; if not, death from trauma or asphyxiation soon follows. Several prey items have been killed by ramming the talons into the skull and penetrating the brain.Wieczkowski, J., McGraw, W. S., & Butynski, T. M. (2012). Inferred African Crowned Eagle (Stephanoaetus coronatus) Predation on a Tana River Mangabey (Cercocebus galeritus). African Primates, 7(2), Pp 218. Having killed on the ground, it has the ability to fly almost vertically upwards to a branch while carrying its prey before feeding, though it will tear up prey into manageable pieces on the ground when it is exceedingly heavy. While they both attack somewhat similar prey in often similar habitat, the considerable difference in body weight and wing-loading between crowned and harpy eagles has been attributed to load-carrying while hunting, as harpies tend to capture and carry off most prey in active flight rather than attack on the ground and dismember if necessary. On rare occasions, crowned eagles may also hunt on the wing, flying slightly over the canopy and causing a cacophony amongst monkey groups until they detect and capture their prey, often a monkey or tree hyrax. Crowned eagles are believed to take uneaten portions of prey up into the trees to cache around the nest or habitual perches, so that the pieces can be consumed over the course of the next several days. If the prey is too heavy for taking flight with, even after dismemberment, for example a bushbuck, crowned eagles have been known to cache food at the thickly vegetated base of a tree and only carry limbs to the nest. Pairs may collaborate in capturing prey, with one bird flushing the prey so the other can glide in unseen and ambush it. Female eagles may target male monkeys more often than males, which are more likely to hunt female or young monkeys. In one case, a female crowned eagle stalked a bushbuck calf over the course of two days but was repeatedly foiled when it went in for the attack, either by the mother bushbuck or an associating troop of yellow baboons (Papio cyanocephalus). However, the crowned eagle one day assaulted the bushbuck calf quickly, leaving it with a gaping wound on its flank and flew off to observe from a distance. Within a few more days, the bleeding, wounded calf was unable to keep pace with its mother and was tracked and killed by the assaulting eagle. Another assault, this one on an adult male vervet monkey (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) apparently had a similar outcome as the bushbuck attack. This type of strike-and-wait hunting technique may be used by diverse predators, from Komodo dragons (Varanus komodoensis) to great white sharks (Carcharodon carcharias), which tend to track their victims by scent after biting them rather than sight and sound, but is virtually unprecedented in birds. Crowned eagles have been recorded to consume carrion but this behavior has only rarely been observed. =Prey= A Diana monkey (Cercopithecus diana), a typical and located favored monkey in the crowned eagle's diet The crowned eagle's staple diet is mostly mammalian. One estimate of the typical prey range posited that the weight range is from , which is, based on the species ecology in Kenyan hillside woodland. This prey weight range is roughly the same weight range that's typically attributed to martial or Verreaux's eagles. Perhaps unsurprisingly, that is the weight range of the rock hyrax, which all three large eagles are known to hunt regularly in East Africa. In a large collection of bones in the South African Museum, it was found that 51.2% of the bones collected from Nature's Valley in South Africa were from smallish species which weigh under in adulthood, 26.3% from \\"medium-sized\\" species with an adult weight of and 22.5% were from larger species with an adult weight of over .Tarboton, W.R. & Allan, D.G. 1984. The Status and conservation of Birds of Prey in the Transvaal. Pretoria: Transvaal Museum Monograph, No. 3. However, about 91% of 87 bones that were from the relatively large antelope species, amongst those that could be accurately sized, were from juvenile specimens. On the other hand, in the rainforest community of Ta√Ø National Park in the Ivory Coast, the estimated average weight of prey for crowned eagles was clearly higher at . Of all other living eagles, only the female harpy eagle has been credited with an average prey weight range that is comparably high and, at the species level, the crowned eagle's prey size from the latter study is the largest of any known for all extant accipitrids. The crowned eagle is perhaps the only living accipitrid to routinely attack prey weighing in excess of . According to some authorities typical prey sizes for crowned eagle may be considered to range to at least in body mass.Shultz, S. (2002). Population density, breeding chronology and diet of crowned eagles Stephanoaetus coronatus in Tai National Park, Ivory Coast. Ibis, 144(1), 135-138.McPherson, S. C., Brown, M., & Downs, C. T. (2016). Diet of the crowned eagle (Stephanoaetus coronatus) in an urban landscape: potential for human-wildlife conflict? Urban ecosystems, 19(1), 383-396. Reportedly, the crowned eagle can lift more than its own body weight in flight, though verified accounts of this are sparse.Ginn, P.J., McIlleorn, W.G. & le S Milstein, P. 1989. The Complete Book of Southern African Birds. Johnnesburg: Strake Winchester. Crowned eagle with a smallish prey item. The crowned eagle occupies a unique niche, as it is the only bird in which primates are the most commonly taken prey at the species level. While at least a dozen other accipitrids opportunistically hunt small or young monkeys, only the harpy eagle and, possibly, crested eagle of the neotropics have diets where primates may locally outnumber other prey. However, New World monkeys are generally smaller and less formidable than Old World monkeys. Also, both other eagles may prefer different prey where available: harpy eagles primarily take sloths, which can be as heavy as a colobus or mangabey but are much slower and less able to defend themselves, while crested eagles take a variety of tropical birds and arboreal mammals. Other large eagles have been confirmed to hunt adult Old World monkeys, including martial eagles,Baldellou, M., & Peter Henzi, S. (1992). \\"Vigilance, predator detection and the presence of supernumerary males in vervet monkey troops'\\". Animal Behaviour, 43(3), 451‚Äì461. Verreaux's eagles, mountain hawk-eaglesFam, S. D., & Nijman, V. (2011). \\"Spizaetus hawk-eagles as predators of arboreal colobines\\". Primates, 52(2), 105‚Äì110. and Philippine eagles, whose generic scientific name and old common was even the monkey-eating eagle, but all are believed to rely on non- primate prey for the majority of their diet. The favored group in the crowned eagles diet is certainly the genus Cercopithecus. In Kibale National Park, Uganda, the red-tailed monkey (Cercopithecus ascanius) was the most represented prey species, making up 40% of the remains. Slightly larger monkeys, such as western red colobus (Piliocolobus badius), mantled guereza (Colobus guereza) and grey-cheeked mangabey (Lophocebus albigena) were secondary in the prior study and, altogether, primates made up 82.2% of the remains from two nests there. A total of 88% of the remains found around crowned eagle nests in the Ituri Rainforest in the Democratic Republic of the Congo were from primates: blue monkey (Cercopithecus mitis), red-tailed monkey, Wolf's mona monkey (C. wolfi), western red colobus and a mixture of mangabeys and black-and-white colobus. In 16 nests in the Ivory Coast's Ta√Ø Forest, more than 60% of remains around the eyries were monkeys and more than 45% of remains were from Cercopithecus monkeys. About half of the Cercopithecus remains were from Diana monkey (C. diana; 44 items from 28 adults and 16 immatures), with the other half from Campbell's mona monkey (C. campbelli) and lesser spot-nosed monkey (C. petaurista), which were indistinguishable as remains. Other represented monkeys in the Ta√Ø Forest included the Western red colobus, the olive colobus (Procolobus verus) and the king colobus (Colobus polykomos). The diet is, by necessity, more diverse in Kiwengwa/Pongwe Forest Reserve in the Matumbi Hills of Tanzania but the blue monkey was still the most represented prey species, making up 20% of the remains. In one nest in the prior study, the Blue monkey made up more than 90% of the remains.Msuya, C. A. (1993). \\"FEEDING HABITS OF CROWNED EAGLES Stephanoaetus coronatus IN KIWENGOMA FOREST RESERVE, MATUMBI HILLS, TANZANIA\\". In Annales Musee Royal de l'Afrique Centrale. Sciences Zoologiques (Vol. 268). Where they overlap in range, the vervet monkey can be quite prominent as prey for crowned eagles, as their relatively small size, diurnal and terrestrial habits may make them more vulnerable.Hall, K. R. L., & Gartlan, J. S. (1965, May). \\"ECOLOGY AND BEHAVIOUR OF THE VERVET MONKEY, CERCOPITHECUS AETHIOPS, LOLUI ISLAND, LAKE VICTORIA\\". In Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London (Vol. 145, No. 1, pp. 37‚Äì56). Blackwell Publishing Ltd. All diurnal African monkeys weigh in excess of in adulthood. Cercopithecine monkeys are on the small side. Full-grown female Cercopithecus can range in average weight from and males from depending on species.Novak, R. M. 1999. Walker's Mammals of the World. 6th edition. Johns Hopkins University Press, Baltimore. All mangabeys and most colobus monkeys weigh considerably in excess of at maturity. Any monkey of a weight of up to may reportedly be hunted.Daneel, A. (1979) Prey size and hunting methods of the crowned eagle. Ostrich 50: 120‚Äì121. As a comparison, the heaviest primate known to be successfully killed by harpy eagles was a Bolivian red howler (Alouatta sara). The crowned eagle's diet may extend to the young or even (rarely) adult females of baboons and similar species, such as adult female yellow baboons, olive baboons (Papio anubis), chacma baboons (P. ursinus), drills (Mandrillus leucophaeus) and mandrills (M. sphinx), all falling into the above maximum primate weight bracket and all have been successfully hunted. In some cases baboons and drills may be actively avoided, as the adult males of these species, at up to twice as heavy as the female, are probably invulnerable to hunting and tend to be notoriously violent-tempered. In one case, olive baboons destroyed the nest of a crowned eagle pair after one of the eagles killed a baby in the baboon group. When experimentally exposed to an image of a crowned eagle, a dominant male mandrill reacted aggressively towards it, implying that they will keep eagles at bay to protect the more vulnerable members of their troop. The crowned eagle is considered a potential predator of infant chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and bonobos (P. paniscus), although this is unconfirmed.Badrian, N., & Malenky, R. K. (1984). Feeding ecology of Pan paniscus in the Lomako Forest, Zaire. In The Pygmy chimpanzee (pp. 275‚Äì299). Springer US. Although rarely observed, some monkeys will \\"bait\\" crowned eagles, that is harass and provoke them. Leslie Brown described Sykes' monkeys (Cercopithecus albogularis) as rarely baiting eagles \\"with the insolent impunity of an expert tolero with a bull\\". Struhsaker and Leakey found that adult male monkeys were often better represented in the diet than adult females. This may be a result of the behavior of male primates. In some species, only adult males often travel separately from social groups, only adult males take aggressive action against eagles, and only adult males have loud calls that may attract the attention of eagles. The variation in behavior of primates is illustrated so that in red colobus species, in which adult males patrol in mixed groups, the males are rarely attacked; meanwhile in the black-and-white colobus, in which adult males often patrol alone, male are regularly attacked and killed by crowned eagles. However, adult monkeys (52%) were found in almost equal measure as juvenile monkeys (at 48%) in Uganda. African primates weighing under , are almost entirely arboreal and nocturnal. However, such primates, actually allies of lemurs rather than monkeys, may occasionally also be hunted by crowned eagles. Potto (Perodicticus potto) are notable secondary prey in the Tai Forest and various galagos have been found across the range, such as in the Kiwengwa/Pongwe Forest Reserve where they made up 7.5% of the remains. Although no one has seen the eagles catch these primates, it is thought pottos and galagos are likely to be taken if discovered by an eagle while sleeping in dense foliage during the day. A full-grown female bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus) is the largest animal known to be hunted by crowned eagles, here in Haller Park in Kenya. Outside of the rainforest, the crowned eagle's diet tends to be somewhat more diverse. While they may take monkeys on a relatively small scale, other families, largely the antelopes and the hyraxes, are the leading prey. In some wooded hillside nests in Kenya, about half of the remains were from small antelope. The predominant prey species there is the Suni (Neotragus moschatus).Brown, L. H. (1971). THE RELATIONS OF THE CROWNED EAGLE STEPHANOAETUS CORONATUS AND SOME OF ITS PREY ANIMALS. Ibis, 113(2), 240‚Äì243. In the Matumbi Hills of Tanzania, antelope make up about 30% of the dietary intake at nests, much of this being the Suni again. Adults antelope of a similarly small size to the Suni, around or slightly less, are readily hunted, such as Kirk's dik-dik (Madoqua kirkii) and the blue duiker (Philantomba monticola). Larger antelopes, often weighing around as adults, may be attacked (mainly calves but also an occasional adult), including klipspringer (Oreotragus oreotragus), steenbok (Raphicerus campestris), Sharpe's grysbok (R. sharpei) and about a half dozen smallish duikers (especially the red forest duiker (Cephalophus natalensis)). Amongst even bigger antelope species that may be hunted, such as bushbuck, Thomson's gazelle (Eudorcas thomsonii), grey rhebok (Pelea capreolus) and impala (Aepyceros melampus), calves are usually taken but sometimes small adult females may be hunted. The biggest duikers to have been killed weighed an estimated . The heaviest accurately weighed bushbuck to be killed by a crowned eagle scaled , but other ones killed by eagles that have been larger include one around and another estimated at , or about eight times the eagle's own weight.Grambo, Rebecca L. Eagles. Voyageur Press, 1999. Furthermore, the remains of another adult-sized bushbuck estimated to weigh were found as the prey of crowned eagles in South Africa.Malan, G., Strydom, E., Shultz, S., & Avery, G. (2016). Diet of nesting African Crowned Eagles Stephanoaetus coronatus in emerging and forest‚Äìsavanna habitats in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Ostrich, 87(2), 145-153. National Geographic recorded video depicting a crowned eagle stalking a water chevrotain (Hyemoschus aquaticus) (the only African representative of a small-bodied, deer-like family) along a rainforest river but show the chevrotain evading the eagle by submerging and swimming away from it. The taking of ungulates on a large scale, unlike primates, is not unique to the crowned eagle. The martial eagle was reported in Tsavo East National Park to hunt mainly dik-diks and elsewhere has exceptionally killed large duiker weighing up to .Smeenk, C. 1974. Comparative ecological studies of some East African birds of prey. Ardea 62:1‚Äì97. Even more impressive feats of ungulate-hunting have been credited to the wedge-tailed eagle (Aquila audax) and especially the golden eagle, despite these being considered less powerful than the crowned eagle. Both Aquila take mainly neonatal lambs and deer fawns but can attack adult sheep and other large prey (i.e. full-grown kangaroos, emus, pronghorns, reindeer, etc.).Olsen, P. 2005. Wedge-tailed Eagle. CSIRO Publishing, . The largest prey attacked by any living raptor is probably the up to calves killed by golden eagles. All four currently recognized species of hyrax have been hunted by crowned eagles. The greatest level of predation for this family has been directed at Southern tree hyrax (Dendrohyrax arboreus), but when they become locally abundant, rock hyrax (Procavia capensis) can become the species' preferred prey. Other mammals have been recorded as opportunistic prey, including bats, hares (Lepus sp.), springhares (Pedetes sp.), cane rats (Thryonomys sp.), sun squirrels (Heliosciurus sp.) and four-toed elephant shrew (Petrodromus tetradactylus). Despite their obvious defenses and nocturnal habits, small Cape porcupines (Hystrix africaeaustralis) have reportedly been taken in South Africa. These assorted mammals, generally smaller than primates and ungulates, are typically taken when preferred prey species are locally scarce. Mammalian carnivores are sometimes also hunted ranging from smaller types such as banded mongoose (Mungos mungo), cusimanses, African palm civet (Nandinia binotata) or genets to larger varieties such as black-backed jackal (Canis mesomelas) or African civet (Civettictis civetta). Adult eagles will only resort to hunting large birds when mammals are scarce, but in southern Africa they can be a fairly common component of the diet. Bird prey can include guineafowl, francolins, ibis, pigeons, ostrich chicks (Struthio camelus) and the fledglings of herons and storks. One nest even had the remains of a marabou stork (Leptoptilos crumeniferus), which is a formidable species not usually susceptible to avian predators. Hornbills may be the most widely represented bird in the diet and the black-casqued wattled hornbill (Ceratogymna atrata) reacts strongly to both the call of crowned eagles and the alarm calls of monkeys specified to the eagles (which are separately identifiable from the monkey's leopard- related alarm calls to both humans and, apparently, hornbills).Rainey, H. J., Zuberb√ºhler, K., & Slater, P. J. (2004). \\"The responses of black-casqued hornbills to predator vocalisations and primate alarm calls\\". Behaviour, 1263‚Äì1277. In Kenya, snakes, including venomous varieties, may regularly supplement the diet. Monitor lizards may also be hunted and, as in the martial eagle, the crowned eagle may attack even the largest African monitors, the Nile monitor (Varanus niloticus) and the rock monitor (V. albigularis). Domestic animals, including chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus), turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo), cats (Felis catus), small to medium-sized dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), small pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus), lambs (Ovis aries), and goats (Capra aegagrus hircus), are taken only when wild prey is greatly depleted. Juveniles and subadults, may take unconventional prey more frequently than adults. =Interspecies conflicts and mortality= In the rainforest interior, the crowned eagle occupies a unique niche and it is, by far, the largest and most dominant raptorial bird in such areas. Other large predators that may exploit similar prey in the same forested habitats include leopard (Panthera pardus), African golden cat (Profelis aurata), Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus), dwarf crocodile (Osteolaemus tetraspis), African rock python (Python sebae), chimpanzee and larger monkeys, like mandrill and baboons. All of these competitors are much heavier bodied than a crowned eagle, ranging in size from the golden cat to the Nile crocodile.Carnivores of the World by Dr. Luke Hunter. Princeton University Press (2011), While the reptiles usually hunt on the ground or near water, felids, large monitor lizards and baboons can be assured thieves who will climb trees and take crowned eagle kills. In a comparison of the monkey-based diets of rainforest crowned eagles with leopards and chimpanzees, the big cat was estimated to take prey averaging , about twice the average estimated prey weight for crowned eagles in the same ecosystem, and the great ape , about a kilogram more than that of the crowned eagle. In South Africa, it is reported that Cape porcupines and bushpigs (Potamochoerus larvatus) are attracted to trees used for prey consumption by crowned eagles, in order to scavenge the sinew and bone that's discarded to the ground. In more mixed eastern and southern habitats, the diversity of large predators is higher and the crowned eagle, despite its great power, is not assured at the top of the avian food chain. Amongst the more formidable raptors, the martial, the Verreaux's and the crowned eagles, may live on the same hillside and all hunt hyraxes. While the Verreaux's eagle is something of a rock hyrax specialist, the martial eagle, even more so than the crowned eagle, has an extremely broad prey base. All these eagles will readily steal the prey caught by the other raptors.Interview with Alan Kemp about the Martial Eagle in Southern Africa. Africanraptors.org (29 August 2011). Retrieved on 2012-08-22. However, the great eagles are segregated by both their habitat preferences and main hunting techniques, which make it possible for the species to successfully nest within a few kilometers of one another. While the crowned eagle lives in denser woods and hunts from a perch, the martial eagle tends to live in more open wooded savanna habitats and tends to hunt on the wing at a high flying height (thanks to its superb vision) and the Verreaux's eagle lives in precipitous mountain habitats and tends to contour-hunt, hugging the uneven contours of the rocks while flying, only a few meters high. Like the martial eagle, the crowned eagle has been known to prey on smaller raptorial birds. Crowned eagles may be killed as prey by large carnivores. Two eagle reintroduced into the wild were killed by predators, one by a leopard that surprised a male on a monkey kill in the rain, and the other by a crocodile that took a female as she ate a young bushbuck kill near the water's edge. In Kenya, cases of predation on nestlings and fledglings have reportedly involved honey badgers (Mellivora capensis) and cobras. In one extraordinary case, an adult male Sanje mangabey (Cercocebus sanjei), estimated to weigh , attacked an adult female crowned eagle that was trying to hunt his troop, jumping onto her back when she was in mid-flight and killing her with a strong bite. This is the first confirmed instance of a monkey killing an adult crowned eagle. In one case, a female who tried to hunt an adult female baboon was found seriously wounded after a male baboon interceded, though the eagle was captured, medically treated and lived on in captivity. In another case involving potential prey turning the tables, an eagle that was trying to hunt an incubating female Egyptian goose (Alopochen aegyptiacus) was quickly attacked by her mate, who flew at the eagle and bit repeatedly at it, causing the eagle to quickly withdraw. The average life expectancy for crowned eagles is 14 years. Relationship with humans Early illustration of a young female crowned eagle =Attacks on humans= While several smaller raptorial birds will attack humans if they come too close to the nesting site, usually these have minor consequences for the human victim. Mother crowned eagles, in the post-fledging stage, readily attack any human who comes close to the nest. Adult males may also attack humans before fledging but only do so rarely. Despite the size and power of the eagle, attacks by the eagles may have minor consequences as well since the attacks are meant only to displace and not kill or seriously maim the intruding animal. However, nest-defense attacks may nonetheless possibly result in deep, painful, open wounds, which can lead to risk of infection or the need for stitches. The crowned eagle is perhaps the only extant raptorial bird which has been believed to attack human children as prey. In one case, a 7-year-old boy, of a weight of approximately , was ambushed by a crowned eagle, who gouged its talons through the boy's throat and chest. The attack was ended by a woman who came upon them and rescued the child by bludgeoning the eagle to death with a hoe. In another case, the skull of a human child was found in the nest of a crowned eagle pair. In yet another instance, when assisting in the investigation of the disappearance of a four-year-old girl, Simon Thomsett came to believe she was the victim of a crowned eagle after the severed arm of a child was found in a tall tree that was inaccessible to leopards and known to be used as a crowned eagle cache. One other living eagle, the white-tailed eagle (Haliaeetus albicilla), has been confirmed to take a human child in an isolated, possible predation attempt, a four-year-old girl in Norway. Unlike in crowned eagle attacks, the white-tailed eagle actually carried off the little girl in flight to its eyrie but the child escaped unharmed after having been dropped by the eagle to a ledge below the nest. In the famed Taung deposit in South Africa, a skull from a child Australopithecus africanus, a possible ancestor of human beings, led to considerable speculation. Ultimately referred to as the Taung Child and estimated to weigh , the child became the type specimen for its species. The child appeared to have died from a clean row of piercing to its skull. Scholarly examination of the piercings has led scientists to believe that the specimen was seemingly killed by an eagle, of which the crowned eagle is the most likely candidate.Gilbert, C. C., McGraw, W. S., & Delson, E. (2009). Brief communication: Plio‚ÄêPleistocene eagle predation on fossil cercopithecids from the Humpata Plateau, southern Angola. American journal of physical anthropology, 139(3), 421‚Äì429. This predatory relationship has led to much hypothesizing as to whether Stephanoaetus eagles may have partially shaped human evolution, with small early primate ancestors having evolved towards larger body sizes and larger brains due to the reduced probability of eagle predation with these features. =Conservation status= native Makere in the DRC holds a dead adult crowned eagle. The crowned eagle is fairly common in suitable habitat, though at the population level, its numbers have shown a decline in sync with deforestation. Declines appear to be widespread and may be increasing due to the often fevered pace of clear-cutting. This species main habitat is rich, high-canopy forest, which is a major target of timber companies, agriculturists, palm oil and biofuel plantations and miners as well as slash and burn farmers. A charcoal-based economy outdoes mineral-based economics in Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zaire, both fuel wars and makes inroads deep into previously virgin forests. As two of central Africa's largest businesses, this has a devastating effect on forests and wildlife. Charcoal taken from Kenya and Ethiopia is often thought to finance Somali warlords. Tanzania, which is more heavily developed for agriculture (largely today for biofuel) than adjacent Kenya, has even more reduced forest habitat. The crowned eagle is far more common in protected areas and reserves than elsewhere in its range, though is still recorded consistently outside of these areas. Biologists in Africa now suspect that the crowned eagles adaptability to small, fragmented tracts of woodland has been exaggerated in the past. Some habitat losses have been offset by the establishment of exotic tree plantations, where this species can nest, but which generally lack a sufficient prey base. The crowned eagle in Ethiopia is certainly at very low density and restricted to protected areas. It may be obliged to utilize exotics stands, but it is unlikely to ever be capable of surviving in the complete absence of indigenous (and thus prey productive) forests. Certain southern African countries, such as Zambezi, Zimbabwe and Malawi, have almost no extensive stands of native forest today, while other countries such as Namibia were never heavily forested. In 2012 the species status was changed to Near Threatened by the IUCN. Like the martial eagle, the crowned has throughout modern history been persecuted by farmers, who maintain that the bird is a threat to their livestock. In fact, both the crowned and martial eagles only rarely attack livestock. In some cases, however, crowned eagles have actually been killed while attempting to hunt domestic animals. Another cause for persecution of the species is that crowned eagles are considered competitors in the illegal bushmeat and poaching trades. Within the forest land-locked countries of Africa, the bushmeat trade is the largest source of animal protein for humans.Topp-J√∏rgensen, E., Nielsen, M. R., Marshall, A. R., & Pedersen, U. (2009). Relative densities of mammals in response to different levels of bushmeat hunting in the Udzungwa Mountains, Tanzania. Tropical Conservation Science, 2(1), 70‚Äì87. It is a multibillion-dollar business with some 5 million tons (mostly small antelopes and monkeys, the crowned eagle's staple diet) being killed each year. In just 500 million acres of the Congo Basin owned by 8 countries the weight equivalent to 40.7 million humans is removed each year (or 740,000 bull elephants).Wilkie, D. S., & Carpenter, J. F. (1999). Bushmeat hunting in the Congo Basin: an assessment of impacts and options for mitigation. Biodiversity & Conservation, 8(7), 927‚Äì955. The effect of this unsustainable culling is to severely depress or remove the large, medium and small wildlife species of the forests. Crowned eagles require some of \\"bush meat\\" a year and thus directly compete with the industry. The red colobus, a monkey that typifies the optimal forest quality and is a main food species for crowned eagles, has been singled out as one of the fastest declining and most endangered monkeys in the world due primarily to the bushmeat trade. In some cases, crowned eagles have reportedly even been shot by primate conservationists in a misguided attempt to mitigate their predation of declining primate species. It is estimated that 90% of the global distribution of the crowned eagle may be subject to habitual persecution or is even killed and eaten itself as bushmeat. On the other hand, some educated foresters and fruit-growers actually encourage protection of populations, due to the controlling effect crowned eagles have on populations of potentially harmful mammals. In April 1996 the world's first captive-born crowned eagle hatched at the San Diego Zoo. Among ISIS registered zoos, only San Diego Zoo, San Francisco Zoo, Los Angeles Zoo, Fort Worth Zoo and Lowry Park Zoo house this species.ISIS (2010). Stephanoaetus coronatus. Version 27 October 2010 Several wildlife rehabilitation centers in Africa house crowned eagles. Due to their high-strung dispositions, tendency for aggression towards humans and resistance to hunting prey via coercion and hunger, the crowned eagle is often considered to be poorly suited for falconry. However, there are several eagles of this species used as such in England and sometimes in Africa, where they have been reportedly used to cull locally overpopulated feral dogs.

He entered sumo in January 2011, and took the second division j≈´ry≈ç championship in his debut as a sekitori in September 2013. He took the top makuuchi division championship in May 2015, only 25 tournaments after his professional debut, which is third behind the renowned Asash≈çry≈´ and Takanohana's 23 tournaments. This earned him promotion to sumo's second highest rank of ≈çzeki. He has been runner-up in four other tournaments, and has four special prizes for Fighting Spirit and Outstanding Performance. He has suffered from knee injuries and having survived being kadoban or in danger of demotion from the rank of ≈çzeki on three previous occasions he was finally demoted after the September 2017 tournament. After a long injury layoff he fell to the second lowest jonidan division in 2019 but staged a successful comeback and returned to the makuuchi division after the March 2020 tournament, the first wrestler to do so from such a low rank. Due to the May 2020 Natsu tournament being cancelled as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Terunofuji's first tournament back in makuuchi ended up being the July 2020 Nagoya tournament. Terunofuji won the basho with a 13-2 record, thus claiming his second top division championship. He wrestles for Isegahama stable. Early life and sumo background In childhood, Gan-Erdene was coached in judo by the father of yokozuna Hakuh≈ç, but, his coach saw in him a predisposition for sumo and helped arrange for him to move to Japan as a student at Tottori Johoku High School to join its well- known sumo program. Future top division wrestler Ichinoj≈ç travelled with him and joined the same school. (He continued his rivalry with Ichinoj≈ç into the professional ranks, remarking in 2015, \\"What matters is who will make it to the ozeki rank first.\\" As a third year student, Gan-Erdene's team took the championship at a national inter-high school sumo tournament. Career =Early career= Upon graduating, he chose to turn professional and joined Magaki stable. He entered the ring in the same tournament as soon to be well- known Chiyotairy≈´ and J≈çk≈çry≈´. Upon entering he was given the shikona surname of . From his first pro tournament in July 2011 he excelled, posting only three losses in three tournaments and spending only one tournament in each of the lower divisions of jonokuchi, jonidan and sandanme. In his sandanme tournament in November 2011, he had a perfect 7‚Äì0 record and participated in a playoff for the championship, which he lost to the aforementioned J≈çk≈çry≈´, then still known as Sakumayama. From his third division makushita debut in January 2012, he had three consecutive 5‚Äì2 records before posting two consecutive losing tournaments in July and September 2012, the only two of his career up to that point. He bounced back from this in the following November tournament, garnering a 4‚Äì3 record. For the next four tournaments his success continued and he never had more than two losses in any tournament. During the period, his stable closed, and he transferred to Isegahama stable. He had become frustrated with a lack of training opportunities at the small Magaki stable, as with the ill health of his stablemaster and various scandals there were sometimes no other coaches or wrestlers present. At Isegahama by contrast he was able to practice with many higher ranked wrestlers to improve his technique. His 6‚Äì1 record at makushita 4 in July 2013 was enough to earn him promotion to the salaried ranks of j≈´ry≈ç in September 2013. Upon entering j≈´ry≈ç he changed his shikona surname to Terunofuji, a combination of two former yokozuna, Terukuni and Asahifuji (his own stablemaster), and a reflection of the high expectations placed on him. He took the j≈´ry≈ç championship in his debut tournament, beating future maegashira Kagami≈ç on the last day to even their records and forcing a playoff bout against Kagami≈ç, which he also won. This success followed in the footsteps of the popular End≈ç who in the previous tournament also took the j≈´ry≈ç championship in his debut in said division. An 8‚Äì7 record in the following November tournament and an even more impressive 12‚Äì3 record against a host of wrestlers with makuuchi experience in the January 2014 tournament earned him promotion to the top makuuchi division in March 2014. =Makuuchi division= His debut in the makuuchi division looked to be a disaster, and he had only a 2‚Äì7 record on the 9th day. However, from then on he won 6 straight bouts in 6 days to pull out a kachi-koshi or winning tournament. Then in the following May tournament he started out with an unpromising 4‚Äì6 record, but then won 5 straight to finish with a strong showing of 9‚Äì6. Two tournaments later in the September 2014 tournament at maegashira 1 he was up against top notch competition, including several san'yaku or titled wrestlers, and he only managed to eke out a 6‚Äì9 record. This was only his third make-koshi or losing record in a tournament in his career and his first in the salaried rank. He only fell to maegashira 2 though, being helped by bad showings from several other wrestlers. It was in this tournament in November 2014 that he truly began to show his mettle in the top division; after going only 4‚Äì6, he beat an ≈çzeki and two sekiwake in the last 5 days to pull off an 8‚Äì7. In the January 2015, he defeated the ≈çzeki G≈çeid≈ç and Kisenosato, the sekiwake Aoiyama and both active komusubi on the way to an 8‚Äì7 record. He was awarded the Fighting Spirit Prize, his first special prize. He was promoted to the rank of sekiwake for the next tournament. In the March Grand Tournament of 2015, he defeated yokozuna Hakuh≈ç (unbeaten in his last 36 matches) for the first time in four meetings, and finished runner-up with a 13‚Äì2 record, having also defeated both komusubi as well as the ≈çzeki G≈çeid≈ç and Kotosh≈çgiku. He received his second Fighting Spirit Prize and was also awarded the prize for Outstanding Performance. After his final contest he said \\"I‚Äôll shoot for double-digit wins at the next tournament and hopefully that will lead to victory. Now I just want to take a long rest\\". In May Terunofuji was beaten on the opening day of the Natsu basho by Sadanoumi, but won his next seven including victories over both komusubi and the ≈çzeki Kotosh≈çgiku. After defeats by Tokush≈çry≈´ on day nine and Hakuh≈ç on day eleven he recovered to win his next three matches including victories over Kisenosato and the sekiwake My≈çgiry≈´ to enter the final day in a tie for first place with Hakuh≈ç. In his final match he defeated the Bulgarian maegashira Aoiyama by yori-kiri or force-out, and then saw Hakuh≈ç lose to Harumafuji. The result was that Terunofuji, in his eighth top-division tournament, was handed his first championship with a 12‚Äì3 record and was awarded the Fighting Spirit Prize for the third time. Terunofuji admitted that he had been \\"almost in tears\\" at the conclusion of the tournament and said, \\"When I was 15 years old I watched sumo and wanted to become a sumo wrestler and so came to Japan. It was a dream of mine to win the championship. To actually win it is like a dream.\\" A few days after the tournament, Terunofuj's official promotion to ≈çzeki was announced in a press conference. He was the first to be promoted to ≈çzeki having previously spent only two tournaments in sanyaku since Yoshibayama 64 years earlier. As Yoshibayama's promotion came before the six-tournaments per year system, Terunofuji was the first to be promoted after only four months in sanyaku. =≈åzeki= On his first appearance at his new rank Terunofuji won nine of his first ten matches to reach a tie for the lead, but losses to Hakuh≈ç, Kakury≈´ and Kotosh≈çgiku saw him end the tournament with an 11‚Äì4 record. In September he won his first eleven matches to establish a clear lead over the opposition, but then lost to Tochi≈çzan and Kisenosato, sustaining a knee injury in the latter match. Another loss to G≈çeid≈ç saw him enter the final day with eleven wins, one behind the yokozuna Kakury≈´. In the final scheduled match on day 15 Terunofuji defeated Kakury≈´ to level their scores but lost the ensuing play-off. Terunofuji's knee injury continued to trouble him in November but he posted nine wins including victories over the yokozuna Kakury≈´ and Hakuh≈ç. In January 2016 Terunofuji won three of his first five bouts before withdrawing from the tournament with a broken right collar bone and damaged meniscus in his left knee, after a bout with Kyokush≈´h≈ç. This was the first withdrawal of his career. He underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left knee shortly afterwards. Despite his injury problems he announced that he would contest the next tournament in March, where he was kadoban, or in danger of demotion from ≈çzeki rank. In March 2016, Terunofuji still seemed well below his best, but maintained his rank with eight wins. In May however his form slumped as he lost his last thirteen matches to end with a career-worst record of 2‚Äì13. He just managed to preserve his rank on the final day of the following Nagoya tournament by defeating Kaisei for an 8‚Äì7 record, but was kadoban yet again after recording only four wins in September. In November 2016 things didn't look good as he was kadoban and under danger of demotion if he failed to secure at least eight wins in the tournament. Things didn't start off on the right foot as he lost his first two matches, however things took a turn as he proceeded to win the next seven in a row including a win over fellow ≈çzeki Kotosh≈çgiku. Terunofuji then had two losses against Kakury≈´ and G≈çeid≈ç, but was able to get his winning record on day 12 against Hakuh≈ç which erased his kadoban status and secured his rank. Terunofuji did however go on to lose the remaining three days of the tournament ending with an 8‚Äì7 record. 2016 was a hard year for Terunofuji, with the lack of strength and flexibility in his knees affecting his performances. He was kadoban three times, but was able to hold on to his rank each time by getting a winning record in the following tournament. The January 2017 tournament didn't bode well for Terunofuji as he managed only four wins, making him kadoban for the fourth time. The Osaka tournament in March saw a dramatic return to form as he won his first five matches before losing to Takayasu, and then won his next seven to take a share of the lead with a win over Kakury≈´ on Day 13. On Day 14 he became the sole leader after he defeated Kotosh≈çgiku and the injured Kisenosato lost to Kakury≈´, but he was booed by the crowd for sidestepping his opponent at the initial charge. He missed out on his second championship on the final day as he was defeated twice by Kisenosato, once in their regulation match and again in the resulting playoff. The Japan Sumo Association was questioned by the government after the tournament when media reports suggested that Terunofuji was subjected to hate speech taunts from the crowd after his controversial win over Kotosh≈çgiku, with the expression \\"Go back to Mongolia\\" reportedly used. Terunofuji underwent endoscopic surgery on his left knee after the May 2017 tournament, but did not recover as well as expected. He entered the Nayoga tournament in July but withdrew after four losses in the first five days, citing a meniscal injury to the knee. The September tournament saw a repeat of Nagoya, with Terunofuji winning only one of his first five matches before he was forced to withdraw because of the knee injury, which he aggravated in a loss to Sh≈çh≈çzan on Day 5. Having failed to record a winning score in two consecutive tournaments he lost his ≈çzeki status after 14 tournaments at the rank. =Later career= Terunofuji could have made an immediate return to ≈çzeki with at least ten wins in the November 2017 tournament, but he withdrew on Day 5 after losing his first four matches, citing a meniscus tear in his left knee. He withdrew from the January 2018 tournament on Day 3 after losing his first two bouts, due to a viscera disorder, and was demoted to j≈´ry≈ç as a result. He is the fourth former ≈çzeki to fall to j≈´ry≈ç and the first since Baruto in 2013. In March 2018 he completed a tournament for the first time since May of the previous year but could only score six wins against nine losses from j≈´ry≈ç 5. He withdrew from the May 2018 tournament on Day 4, but returned from Day 11 in an attempt to stave off demotion to makushita. His stablemaster reported that in addition to diabetes and knee problems he was also suffering from kidney stones. However he failed to win any matches on his return and was demoted to makushita. He was the first ≈çzeki and first top division tournament winner to fall to that division. He had surgery on both knees on June 25 and withdrew from the July 2018 tournament, with his stablemaster indicating he wanted Terunofuji to have his knees healed properly before competing again. He was also absent for the next three tournaments, which caused him to fall to the second-lowest jonidan division. He returned to competition in March 2019 and won all seven of his matches, although he lost a playoff for the jonidan championship to fellow Mongolian Roga. This was his first appearance since May 2018, and his first winning record since May 2017. In his next three tournaments he lost just one bout in each, progressing to makushita 10 by November 2019. In the Kyushu tournament he won the makushita championship with a perfect 7‚Äì0 record, ensuring his return to the sekitori ranks. In his first tournament as a sekitori since May 2018, Terunofuji won his second consecutive y≈´sh≈ç by clinching the j≈´ry≈ç championship on Day 13 of the January tournament with 13 straight wins. He lost his final two matches to Nishikigi and Daiamami, ending any outside hopes of immediate promotion back to makuuchi, and was ranked at j≈´ry≈ç 3 for the March 2020 tournament. In the March tournament, Terunofuji finished with a 10-5 record and earned promotion back to makuuchi, after 14 tournaments outside the top division. He is the first top division wrestler to fall to jonidan and successfully return to makuuchi. In the July tournament, Terunofuji continued his comeback by winning his second top-division y≈´sh≈ç with a 13-2 record. He secured the championship by defeating sekiwake Mitakeumi on the final day and also won the Technique and Outstanding Performance prizes as well. The 30 tournaments between this victory and his previous y≈´sh≈ç in May 2015 is the second longest gap between top division championships after Kotonishiki's 43. Speaking to reporters online following his victory, Terunofuji thanked his stablemaster, who convinced him to keep working on healing himself when Terunofuji had asked for permission to retire. In the September 2020 tournament from maegashira 1 Terunofuji secured a winning record with eight wins, before withdrawing on Day 13 with a left knee injury. Fighting style Terunofuji is a yotsu-sumo wrestler who favours grappling techniques as opposed to pushing and thrusting (oshi-sumo). His preferred grip on his opponent's mawashi or belt is migi- yotsu, a left hand outside, right hand inside position. His favourite winning kimarite or technique is a straightforward yori-kiri, or force out, which has accounted for over 40 percent of his career victories. His style of wrestling has been criticized as being reckless as he likes to grab an opponent with both arms and swing them around, relying on his power, which increases the burden on his knees.

History =German East Africa= Also known as Amani Institute, the research institute was founded in 1902 by German colonists in German East Africa (Deutsch-Ostafrika). It was established under the leadership of Dr Frantz Stuhlmann, who was in charge of the Department of Surveying and Agriculture (est. 1893) of German East Africa. The Amani Institute started out as a biological-agricultural research centre, and came to be known as the Amani Biological-Agricultural Institute.Henderson, W.O.; \\"German East Africa 1884 ‚Äì 1918,\\" in Vincent Harlow, E.M. Chilver, Alison Smith, eds., History of East Africa, II, London: Oxford University Press, 1965Ref. note #1: Henderson, 1965, p. 134. But it quickly expanded into other areas of research in the following years. \\"The Amani Institute soon became a 'tropical scientific institute superior to anything in the British colonies and protectorates and comparable with Pusa in India or the Dutch establishment at Buitenzorg in Java.\\" Report of the East Africa Commission, Cmd. 2387 (1925), p. 86.Ref. note #2: Henderson, 1965, p. 144. During their reign, the Germans had other research centres in the colony, especially in the northern region. \\"Although Amani was the most famous of Germany's colonial research stations, representing a 2-million-mark investment, it was only one of several German agricultural stations in the northern region. Another, named Kwai farm and located in the nearby West Usambaras, preceded Amani as the colony's chief center for agricultural and livestock experiments. Kwai lacked Amani's international reputation, but it nonetheless held a prominent place in the minds of the Africans who lived in its shadow.\\" Conte, Christopher-Allan; \\"Imperial Science, Tropical Ecology, and Indigenous History: Tropical Research Stations in Northeastern German East Africa, 1896 to Present,\\" in Gregory Blue, Martin Bunton and Ralph Croizier, eds., Colonialism and the Modern World: Selected Studies, New York: M.

The Germans built other facilities, including schools and hospitals, in different parts of the country while ruling the colony (1891‚Äì1918). One of their biggest colonial achievements was in scientific research at the institutes they established in German East Africa, especially at Amani. =British Tanganyika= The German East Africa colony was renamed Tanganyika Territory in 1920 when the British took over, by a League of Nations Mandate, after the German Empire lost World War I. Other areas of research were added to the institute in 1960. Although the Amani Research Institute became world-famous during German colonial rule as a scientific research centre,Ref. note #6: Conte, 2002, p. 246; Conte, 2004, p. 13. it retained its international reputation after the British received control of the colony they renamed Tanganyika.Mwakikagile, Godfrey Life in Tanganyika in The Fifties; Dar es Salaam, Tanzania: New Africa Press, 2010, p. 164: \\"The Amani Research Institute....was established by the German colonial rulers and became world-famous as a tropical research institute.\\" =Post- independence= In 1964, liberated Tanganyika united with Zanzibar to form the independent nation of Tanzania. After British colonial rule ended, the institute continued to play an important role as a research centre in Tanzania. In 1977, it was renamed Amani Medical Research Centre of the National Institute for Medical Research, covering a wide range of areas in medical research. Achievements During World War I, the Amani Research Institute reinforced its international reputation in research when scientists at the centre developed various products. They included medicine and chemical products, from local material to meet war needs and those of the German settlers at a time when the colony was cut off from the rest of the world and could not import anything: \\"Considerable ingenuity was shown in producing in the colony manufactured goods and medical supplies normally imported from Europe. Quinine was made at the Amani Institute and at Mpwapwa....Dye-stuffs were made from native barks. In the first eighteen months of the war the Amani Agricultural Research Institute 'prepared for use from its own products 16 varieties of foodstuffs and liquors, 11 varieties of spices, 12 varieties of medicines and medicaments, 5 varieties of rubber products, 2 of soap, oils and candles, 3 of materials used in making boats, and 10 miscellaneous substances. Many of these were prepared in comparatively large quantities, e.g.15,200 bottles of whisky and other alcoholic liquors, 10,252 lb. of chocolate and cocoa, 2,652 parcels of toothpowder, 10,000 pieces of soap, 300 bottles of castor oil etc.' Report of the East Africa Commission, Cmd. 2387 (1925), p. 86....Owing to the blockade, overseas trade came to an end....The long drawn- out conflict inflicted serious damage on the colony.\\"W.O.

After the British took over, they were \\"impressed both with Amani's international reputation and the quality of research conducted there...and continued operating it as a research institute under the British postwar government. Amani therefore continued to function as an important center of botanical research and became a flash point for arguments over the value of pure versus applied research in Britain's East African colonies.\\" Ref. note #6: Conte, 2002, p. 246; Conte, 2004, p. 13. The institute also became famous for its research in malaria during British colonial rule and was transformed in 1949 into the East African Malaria Unit. The research centre served not only Tanganyika but also Kenya, Uganda, Zanzibar and British Somaliland in the prevention and control of malaria and other vector-borne diseases. It became the East African Malaria Institute in 1951 and was renamed the East African Institute of Malaria and Vector Borne Diseases in 1954. In the present day it maintains a high reputation in research, as the Amani Medical Research Centre, in the Tanga Region of Tanzania.

It forms a cut out from the eastern coast of Prince of Wales Island on the south, and by Tolstoi Bay and Thome Bay on the north. A low mountain range forms the backbone of the peninsula, with altitudes ranging from . The southern and western shore line is abrupt and almost unbroken, and has practically no shelter from southeasterly storms which sweep up Kasaan Bay. The northeastern coast of the peninsula also rises abruptly from the water, but is broken by a number of indentations, some of which form small harbors. The first discovery of copper deposits in the Ketchikan district was made by the Russians on the southern side of Kasaan Peninsula. Kasaan is the largest settlement on the peninsula. Topography Kasaan Peninsula is a promontory on the east side of Prince of Wales Island that includes about square miles. From Clarence Strait, it appears to be an island whose summits are highest near its central part and diminish in height toward the north and south. A neck of low land between the head of Kasaan Bay and the south end of Thorne Bay connects the peninsula with Prince of Wales Island. This low pass appears to represent the continuation of a valley, from wide, which is tributary to the north branch of Thorne Bay and extends northwestward through the center of Prince of Wales Island. Kasaan Bay occupies the south end of this valley. In the northward extension of this valley and on the low pass south of Thorne Bay, there are many small lakes and morainal deposits. The highest point on the peninsula is the top of Kasaan Mountain, which has an altitude of . The other mountains average about in height and their slopes are deeply dissected by small valleys and by narrow steep-sided gulches. Erosion On Kasaan Peninsula, there are many flat areas, some of them containing small lakes, and the mountain slopes themselves are interrupted by benches or terraces, which occur at different elevations and at rather regular intervals above sea level. These benches represent levels of erosion. The lowest bench level is indicated by a series of flats or forelands at a height of about above sea level. Forelands at this height are especially prominent at the head of Kasaan Bay and on the adjacent islands. Along the northern shore of the peninsula and in Tolstoi Bay, a higher level of erosion, which seems persistent at on many parts of the peninsula, is marked by wide flats in the valleys, some of which are occupied by small lakes. Such flats occur just north of Grindall Point; on the hills just north of Kasaan; northeast of the Haida mine, where the flat is covered by a lake; on both the east and west slopes of Tolstoi Bay; and southwest of Thorne Bay, where there are two large lakes. Still higher, at an elevation of , a level of erosion is represented by a flat, occupied by a lake, at the head of Poor Mans Creek, on the divide toward Tolstoi Bay; by flats north of the Alarm claim, on which there are several lakes; and by several areas occupied by lakes northeast of the Haida mine. The surface of the lake just east of Lake Three, at the head of Kasaan Bay, and that of the lake below the Goodro mine are also at this elevation.Wright (1915), p. 66 The next or fourth series of benches and flats are prominent at an elevation of about above sea level. At this level also there are lakes, from which small streams flow down through gulch- like valleys to lower levels. At this altitude, there are terraces along the north slope of the southwest half of the peninsula, flats south of Hadley, a low pass across the peninsula southwest of Lyman Anchorage, and the lakes and flats on the divide from Windfall Harbor to Tolstoi Bay and east of the It mine. Most of the summits of the hills north of the It mine and adjacent to the Salt chucks at the head of Kasaan Bay are at an elevation of about . Higher levels of erosion are indicated at elevations of by lakes and flats in the central portion of the southeast half of the peninsula, by flats that are in part occupied by lakes on Mount Andrew and on the mountain just west of Lyman Anchorage, and at the head of a branch of Tolstoi River. Other lakes at an altitude of about north of Grindall Point Mountains and north of Kasaan Mountain may mark a higher erosion level. The highest relatively level areas stand at an altitude of about , on the Grindall Point Mountains, where there are also small lakes, and also on the ridge southeast of Kasaan Mountain and on Tolstoi Mountain. Glaciation The mountain mass of Kasaan Peninsula exhibits characteristic glaciated topography. That the entire peninsula was at one time overridden by ice streams is evident from the glacial erratics which lie on the highest summits, the moraine deposits which occur on the lower levels, and the many basins which stand at various elevations on the mountain slopes and are now occupied by lakes. During the period in which this area lay beneath the ice many of the minor topographic features, such as the earlier erosion level, were partly destroyed. Some of the valleys were more deeply eroded, lake basins were formed, and wide areas of glacial silt and debris were laid down. This section of the ice stream is well represented in the northern extension of the valley of Kasaan Bay, which is occupied by a chain of connecting lakes, on the sides of which thick beds of glacial clay and debris have been exposed by subsequent stream erosion. This valley probably represents a preglacial river floor, and only the lake basins and minor physiographic features can be attributed to ice erosion. Erosive action subsequent to the ice period has formed the gulches and ravines which are everywhere prominent on the mountain slopes. Another noteworthy feature of Kasaan Peninsula is its precipitous southwest slope, which is much steeper than that on the northeast. This difference may be due to the fact that the ice stream remained longer in the valley of Kasaan Bay than in that of Clarence Strait, the action of the ice tending to deepen the valley and at the same time to protect the mountain slopes from surface erosion.Wright (1915), pp. 66-67 Flora Kasaan Peninsula is densely forested with spruce and hemlock, principally hemlock, which extends to elevations of The timber, especially that on the southwest side, toward Grindall Point, is large and straight. The mountain side is steep down to salt water. The mountain summits and ridges above timber line are fairly open and bear relatively little vegetation as compared with that of the densely forested lower levels, groups of scrubby pine and juniper and a low berry bush being the principal plants found.Wright (1915), p. 67 Conservation Prince of Wales Island was included in the Tongass National Forest, but in 1908 that portion of Kasaan Peninsula which lies south of the Hole in the Wall was taken out of the national forest.

Recording and music The album was recorded at Manhattan Center Studios, New York, on November 13 and December 9, 2000. Pianist Taylor's trio for the recording contained bassist Chip Jackson and drummer Winard Harper. The ten pieces were written as pedagogical material for the Wharton Center for Performing Arts at Michigan State University. Some have melodies that use fourths; others are based on rhythms that would be familiar to students. \\"Local Color / Can You Dig It?\\" uses rhythms similar to those found in hip hop; \\"Reclamation\\" is a waltz; and \\"Gracias Chucho\\" contains Latin rhythms. One track, \\"Spoken\\", is a spoken-word dedication to a dead child.

It was released on November 4, 2014. Plot Worst Friends has been described as a dark Indie comedy. The film is set in an unnamed New Jersey suburb and focuses around a number of key characters. The film opens explaining the close but troubled friendship of two young boys. It explores the role of friendships when a traumatic incident takes place and how there can be a fine line between help and dependence. Jake (Richard Tanne) is a young man suffering traumatic injuries after he is hit by a car. He turns to his childhood friend Sam (Noah Barrow) for support and to help him recover. A physical therapist (Cody Horn) is enlisted and begins to help Sam with Jake's recovery. Sam and Jake's friendship takes a turn for the worse when Sam's childhood sweetheart, Zoe (Kristen Connolly), returns to town. Her presence becomes a true test of Sam and Jake's friendship. Cast Richard Tanne as Jake, the lead character who suffers traumatic injuries * Noah Barrow as Sam, Jake's best friend who comes to aid him after the injury * Kristen Connolly as Zoe, Sam's childhood sweetheart, who moves back to town following Jake's injury Production The concept of the plot was taken from Richard Tanne's own experiences in 2010. While recovering from an injury in his home state of New Jersey, Tanne reconnected with filmmakers Ralph Arend and Noah Barrow and the idea generated traction over the coming weeks. On July 28, 2010, the producers launched a Kickstarter campaign aiming to make $11,000 to fund the film. By August 11, 2010, the campaign had raised over $17,000. Following the online premiere of the trailer, it was announced by Deadline that Level 33 Entertainment would be distributing the film across North America.[1] The film was then released on November 4, 2014 through video on-demand and DVD. Reception The film received mainly positive reviews following its launch in 2014. In its review, Yes! Weekly described the film as a ‚Äúloose, likeable comedy‚Äù with a ‚Äúfun cast.‚Äù Actor Larry Fessenden was singled out for ‚Äúamusingly channeling Jack Nicholson.‚Äù Videoviews.org awarded the film 3 1/2 out of 5 stars and wrote, \\"Worst Friends is a simple story but the acting and well-written dialogue take it up a notch.\\" Spectrum Culture reviewed the film in 2014, stating the film covered the harsh realities of some friendships and praised the film‚Äôs opening for its effective storytelling, but ultimately only awarded the film 2 out of 5 stars.

Early life  Robertson was born in Montreal on June 16, 1891, the daughter of John Armour Robertson and Jessie Anne Christie, and the oldest of four siblings. Her parents were originally from Scotland. She was educated in Montreal. During her childhood, the family lived comfortably, but later faced financial struggles. She began art studies at the age of nineteen with a Wood Scholarship to the Art Association of Montreal under William Brymner and Maurice Cullen. World War I interrupted her studies, after which she continued them from 1921 to 1924 under Randolph Hewton, a founding member of the Canadian Group of Painters, and Wood Scholarship winner.  Artistic career  Le Repos, c. 1926. Oil on canvas. In the permanent collection of the National Gallery of Canada.During her last few years at the Art Association, Robertson joined former and current students, and fellow artists, along with her teacher Randolph Hewton, in the Beaver Hall Group. A. Y. Jackson was the president of the group named after the Montreal street, Beaver Hall Hill. Robertson became close friends with Prudence Heward. Both painters were dedicated to their art and often painted together. Robertson's work was shown in a solo exhibition at the National Gallery of Canada in 1951. Robertson also exhibited in the United States, in group exhibitions at the Yale University Art Gallery in 1944, the Museu Nacional de Belas Artes in Rio de Janeiro, and the Riverside Museum in New York.Alan Klinkhoff Gallery: Sarah Robertson (By Barbara Meadowcroft)- Retrieved 2017-11-26  Later life  Joseph and Marie-Louise, c. 1930. Oil on canvas. In the permanent collection of the National Gallery of Canada. Robertson's later work was freer in composition and bolder in colors. It reflected her love of nature, and her unique style. She died on 6 December 1948 in Montreal.  Associations with other artists and groups  The Beaver Hall Group was a Montreal-based group of Canadian painters who met in late 1910 while studying art at a school run by the Art Association of Montreal. Nora Collyer, Emily Coonan, Prudence Heward, Mabel Lockerby, Mabel May, Kathleen Morris, Lilias Torrance Newton, Sarah Robertson, Anne Savage and Ethel Seath were part of this group, sometimes known the Beaver Hall Hill Group or Beaver Hall Women. This association of nineteen Montreal artists, eight of whom were women, had been committed to developing distinctive artistic visions while acknowledging the influence of the Group of Seven, and French modernism. The Beaver Hall artists held their annual exhibition at their studios on Beaver Hall Hill. By the end of 1921, the Beaver Hall group ran into serious financial difficulties which necessitated relinquishing their studios. The men went their own way, but most of the women remained in close touch with each other. In the summers, Robertson would also visit Prudence Heward at her family's summer home near Brockville on the St. Lawrence River. At the same time, Robertson also maintained a long correspondence with A.Y. Jackson, who offered vital critical judgment. Jackson was a close friend of both Robertson and Heward. Some of Robertson‚Äôs paintings were inspired by her visits to the Hewards' summer home. Robertson was a founding member of the Canadian Group of Painters, exhibiting with them for many years. The group was made up of 28 different English-speaking painters from across Canada. This group was instrumental in establishing a new direction for Canadian art, expressing the diversity of the Canadian experience of landscapes and buildings based on the vision of the Group of Seven. Exhibitions and collections Robertson's paintings appeared in exhibitions of Canadian art at Wembley, England, in 1924 and 1925 and she was invited to participate in shows by the Group of Seven in 1928, 1930 and 1931. Robertson's works are included in the collections of the National Gallery of Canada, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, the University of Alberta, and the Art Gallery of Ontario. Although she mainly painted landscapes in oil, she also painted still lifes and portraits, as well as murals for private homes.

It was first isolated from Ochna squarrosa Linn, a member of Ochnaceae family, in 1973. Synthesis Synthesis of Ochnalfavone The first total synthesis of ochnaflavone derivatives was achieved by Kawano group in 1973, followed by the Heerden group for the first time reporting the total synthesis the ochnaflavone by constructing a diaryl ether intermediate and assemble the two flavone nuclei through ring cyclization.Ndoile, M. M.; van Heerden, F. R., Total synthesis of ochnaflavone. Beilstein Journal of Organic Chemistry 2013, 9, 1346‚Äì1351. To date, the field of biochemistry of biflavonoids is still wide open. Little is known about Ochnaflavone of its natural occurrence and biosynthesis.Dey, P. M., METHODS IN PLANT BIOCHEMISTRY VOL 1 APL. Elsevier Science: 2012. Activity Although Ochnaflavone has not been fully studied in the past decades, its protective role in plants and human body already attract scientists‚Äô much attention, such as anti- atherogenic activity and anti-inflammatory activity. Anti-atherogenic activity: Atherogenesis refers to the formation of atheromas on arteries‚Äô walls. It is believed that atherogenesis may be caused by an infection of the vascular smooth muscle cells. Find molecules that possess anti-proliferation activity of vascular smooth muscle cells seems a good strategy to treat Atherogenesis. In 2006, a research group from Korea found Ochnaflavone could inhibit tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a-induced human vascular smooth muscle cells proliferation. It was achieved by the ability of Ochnaflavone to regulate the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, matrix metalloproteinase-9 and cell cycle.Suh, S.-J.; Jin, U.-H.; Kim, S.-H.; Chang, H.-W.; Son, J.-K.; Ho Lee, S.; Son, K.-H.; Kim, C.-H., Ochnaflavone inhibits TNF-Œ±-induced human VSMC proliferation via regulation of cell cycle, ERK1/2, and MMP-9. Journal of Cellular Biochemistry 2006, 99, 1298‚Äì1307. Anti- inflammatory activity: Inflammation is a biological response to certain harmful stimuli. Phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is important in many inflammatory processes as it catalyses the release of arachidonic acid, which could generate lipid mediators of inflammation. Ochnaflavone is found to inhibit PLA2 by directly binding this enzyme irreversibly.Chang, H. W.; Baek, S. H.; Chung, K. W.; Son, K. H.; Kim, H. P.; Kang, S.

The hospital is currently managed by Metro Pacific Investments Corporation after the OLLHI agreed on a 20-year lease starting on November 2010. History Dr. Carlos Casas conceptualized the birth of the Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital on July 15, 1948 and was co-managed by Dr. Basilio Valdes as medical director. Nuns of the Missionary Sisters Servants of the Holy Spirit were asked to join its nursing staff during post-war Manila. It was then an unnamed hospital.

Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital (OLLH) was founded in 1958 by the Missionary Sisters Servants of the Holy Spirit through the Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital Inc. (OLLHI), a non-stock, non-profit organization. The hospital provides quality healthcare but by that time lacks some of the most needed equipment. Still, the hospital managed to perform better throughout the years. After several challenging years, OLLH became one of the premier hospital in Manila, known for being the birthplace of several notable personalities. The hospital is known for its affordability and good services. OLLHI agreed to a 20-lease to East Manila Hospital Managers Corporation (EMHMC), a subsidiary of Metro Pacific Investments Corporation (MPIC). Under the lease, the new management was committed to spend P350 million (US $8.13 million) over the first five years to upgrade hospital facilities and equipment. After the Missionary Sisters Servants of the Holy Spirit left, Manuel V. Pangilinan took over the management, being the Chairman of the MPIC.

History Raggs was originally created in 1990 by U.S. advertising executive Toni Steedman for her then six- year-old daughter, Alison, as a series of carpool stories. Steedman later used the Raggs character for a regional mall promotion and advertising campaign. By 2001, the successful mall programs encouraged Steedman, along with former HBO producer Carole Rosen, to create a one-hour music video-inspired pilot called \\"Pawsuuup,\\" which was shot in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and New York City in August 2001. While Steedman shopped the pilot for a production or broadcast partner, The Raggs Band (also known as the Raggs Kids' Club Band because of the regional mall kids' clubs for which Raggs served as mascot) began playing concerts at fairs, festivals and performing arts venues. In 2005, Steedman and her company, Raggs LLC, entered into a co-production relationship with Southern Star International (now Endemol Australia) to produce the Raggs series for the Seven Network in Sydney, Australia. Production began in 2005 using Alias Maya at the ABC Studios in Sydney, and the first episode of Series 1 began airing daily at 9 am on Seven in January 2006. Series 1 consisted of 65 half hours episodes. Raggs quickly garnered strong ratings and, within a few months of airing, Seven ordered Series 2, an additional 65 episodes. In 2007, Seven ordered Series 3, also 65 episodes, bringing the total to 195 original half hours by 2009. Each episode featured original Raggs‚Äô music, written and produced in the U.S. by Concentrix Music and Sound Design, requiring over 200 original songs for the 195 half hours of shows. Southern Star distributed Raggs to several countries including Singapore, Bulgaria, South Africa and India. In the U.S., Steedman worked to establish Raggs on public television. KQED San Francisco signed on as the presenting station in association with American Public Television, and Raggs began airing on public TV stations in 2007. In January 2010, Steedman reacquired Southern Star‚Äôs distribution and licensing rights under Blue Socks Media LLC.

These concepts are discussed in ancient and medieval texts of Hinduism, and other Indian religions, using synonymous terms.

Causality All schools of Vedanta subscribe to the theory of SatkƒÅryavƒÅda, which means that the effect is pre-existent in the cause. But there are different views on the causal relationship and the nature of the empirical world from the perspective of metaphysical Brahman. The Brahma Sutras, the ancient Vedantins, most sub-schools of Vedanta, as well as Samkhya school of Hindu philosophy, support Parinamavada, the idea that the world is a real transformation (parinama) of Brahman. Scholars disagree on the whether Adi Shankara and his Advaita Vedanta explained causality through vivarta. According to Andrew Nicholson, instead of parinama-vada, the competing causality theory is Vivartavada, which says \\"the world, is merely an unreal manifestation (vivarta) of Brahman. Vivartavada states that although Brahman appears to undergo a transformation, in fact no real change takes place. The myriad of beings are unreal manifestation, as the only real being is Brahman, that ultimate reality which is unborn, unchanging, and entirely without parts\\". The advocates of this illusive, unreal transformation based causality theory, states Nicholson, have been the Advaitins, the followers of Shankara. \\"Although the world can be described as conventionally real\\", adds Nicholson, \\"the Advaitins claim that all of Brahman‚Äôs effects must ultimately be acknowledged as unreal before the individual self can be liberated\\". However, other scholars such as Hajime Nakamura and Paul Hacker disagree. Hacker and others state that Adi Shankara did not advocate Vivartavada, and his explanations are \\"remote from any connotation of illusion\\". According to these scholars, it was the 13th century scholar Prakasatman who gave a definition to Vivarta, and it is Prakasatman's theory that is sometimes misunderstood as Adi Shankara's position. To Shankara, the word maya has hardly any terminological weight. Andrew Nicholson concurs with Hacker and other scholars, adding that the vivarta-vada isn't Shankara's theory, that Shankara's ideas appear closer to parinama-vada, and the vivarta explanation likely emerged gradually in Advaita subschool later. According to Eliot Deutsch, Advaita Vedanta states that from \\"the standpoint of Brahman-experience and Brahman itself, there is no creation\\" in the absolute sense, all empirically observed creation is relative and mere transformation of one state into another, all states are provisional and a cause-effect driven modification. Nimitta kƒÅra·πáa and UpƒÅdƒÅna kƒÅra·πáa Two sorts of causes are recognised: # , the efficient cause. # , the material cause.  Advaita states that effect () is non-different from cause (), but the cause is different from the effect: : is not different from ; however is different from This principle is called . =Effect is not different from cause= When the cause is destroyed, the effect will no longer exist. For example, cotton cloth is the effect of the cotton threads, which is the material cause. Without threads there will be no cotton cloth. Without cotton there will be no thread.

The movie had its world premiere on July 5, 2013 at the Neuch√¢tel International Fantastic Film Festival, where it won a special mention for best feature film. It stars Yannick Rosset as a young man that ends up contracting vampirism after receiving a blood transfusion. Synopsis Alex (Yannick Rosset) and Livia (Jasna Kohoutova) are a young couple on vacation in Romania. Their trip is uneventful until Alex severely injures himself while drunk and requires a trip to the hospital. His injuries necessitates a blood transfusion and Alex initially seems like he will be fine. However, when he and Livia return home, Alex begins to develop strange new symptoms. He has an all new aversion to light, he is unable to eat anything, and develops insomnia. Alex and Livia initially believe this to be brain damage, but they soon discover the reality of the situation: that Alex is turning into a vampire. CastJasna Kohoutova as Livia *Yannick Rosset as Alex *Catriona MacColl as Michelle *Ruggero Deodato as Butcher *Paulo Dos Santos as Fred *Derek Robin as Doctor Production Beguin had initially planned for his first feature film to be a \\"mix of thriller and road-movie\\" but found that the concept would be more expensive than he'd expected. He chose to instead direct a monster movie that centered around vampirism, as it would fit both his budget and the type of story he wanted to tell. The movie's plot was originally plotted out as a horror comedy, but Beguin soon found that it worked well as a love story. Rosset was intrigued by how his character was written, as Alex sees himself as violent and beastly when he looks in the mirror \\"but in reality he's just sick, he's simply tired, injured\\". Reception Fangoria and Twitch Film both gave Chim√®res positive reviews, and Twitch Film praised it for \\"really [knowing] how to play to its audience. Especially if said audience is seeing it at the late show, beer in hand and thirsty for blood.\\" In contrast, Dread Central rated the film at two and a half blades, stating that it was a \\"respectable effort at doing something different with the genre, but those looking for a much more well-rounded and confident approach would be better served checking out Scott Leberecht's excellent Midnight Son instead.\\" =Awards=Special Mention for Best Feature Film at the Neuch√¢tel International Fantastic Film Festival (2013, won) *Narcisse Award for Best Feature Film at the Neuch√¢tel International Fantastic Film Festival (2013, nominated) *Grand Prize of European Fantasy Film in Silver at the Sitges - Catalan International Film Festival (2013, nominated) *Festival Trophy for Best Editing at the Screamfest Horror Film Festival (2013, won) *International Fantasy Film Special Jury Award for Features at Fantasporto (2014, won) *International Fantasy Film Award for Best Film at Fantasporto (2014, nominated) *Best Director Award at Horrorant Film Festival (2014, won) *Best Actress Award at Horrorant Film Festival (2014, won) References External links 2013 films 2013 horror films French-language films Vampires in film 2013 directorial debut films ","title":"Chim√®res (film)"},{"id":"42917115","text":"Ralph Pappier ( 16 January 1914 in Shanghai ‚Äì 29 August 1998 in Buenos Aires) was an Argentine production designer, set decorator and film director.

The Bank came into operation as a commercial bank on 3 August 1999 as per rules and regulations of Bangladesh Bank. From its establishment the bank was known as BEXIM Bank Limited. But due to legal constraints, the bank was renamed as EXIM Bank, which stood for Export Import Bank of Bangladesh Limited. As of May 2015 the bank has operations across the country with 88 branches and 45 ATM booths. By July 2004 the bank has migrated all of its conventional banking operation into Shariah based Islamic banking. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is one of the most concerned areas of the Bank. Historical background EXIM Bank Limited was established in 1999 by Shahjahan Kabir, founder chairman. Nazrul Islam Mazumder became the new chairman after the founding chairman died. The bank started functioning from 3 August 1999 with Alamgir Kabir, as the adviser and Mohammad Lakiotullah as the managing director. On 2009, the bank made history for being the first privately owned bank in Bangladesh to open an exchange house in the UK. The bank started its operation with an initial authorised capital of Taka 1 billion ($12.87 million USD) and paid up capital of Taka 225 million (2.9 million USD). Since then the authorised and paid up capital remained unchanged till December 2000. Later, both were increased from time to time and their amounts stood at Tk.16.12 billion ($207.31 million USD) and Tk.9.22 billion ($118.7 million USD) respectively on 31 December 2011. EXIM bank is the first bank in Bangladesh to have converted all of its operations of conventional banking into shariah-based banking, since July/2004. Prime operational area As a full-fledged Islamic bank in Bangladesh, EXIM Bank extended all Islamic banking services including wide range of saving and investment products, foreign exchange and ancillary services with the support of sophisticated IT and professional management. The investment portfolio of the bank comprises diversified areas of business and industry sectors. The sectors include textiles, edible oil, ready-made garments, chemicals, cement, telecommunication, steel, real estate and other service industry including general trade finance. =Foreign exchange department= Foreign exchange is an important department of EXIM Bank Limited, which deals with import, export and foreign remittances. This department is playing an important role in enhancing export earning, which aids economic growth and in turn it helps for the economic development. On the other hand, it also helps to meet those goods and service, which are most demandable and not adequate in the country. Corporate social responsibilities In past recent years the bank has supported the poor and meritorious student's education. In 2007 about 80 students of different institutions like (DU, BUET, DMC, VNCS, and NDC) have taken scholarship. The bank sponsored the \\"Beautification Project\\" of Dhaka mega city conducted by Dhaka City Corporation. EXIM Bank Foundation =EXIM Bank Scholarship Program= EXIM Bank Scholarship Program was launched in the year 2006 with 61 poor meritorious students selected from different reputed educational institutions of Dhaka City including Government Laboratory High School, Viqarunnisa Noon School and College, Dhaka University, BUET, Dhaka Medical College, etc. Till 30 April 2013, they have enrolled as many as 2100 students from around 350 reputed educational institutions across the country. =Exim Bank Agricultural University Bangladesh= The vulnerable features of Northern Bangladesh characterised by frequent river erosion, flood and drought, social inequalities in education & health, and migration affecting livelihoods of its poor inhabitants inspired the Bank for undertaking some initiatives for their assistance in advancement. Till then, there has been no existence of any private agricultural university in North Bengal, even though northern part of the country is densely populated and has enormous potential for agricultural development. A large portion of quality students having good results in SSC and HSC cannot get admission into public agricultural university every year. In essence, availability of admission would enable them to pursue higher education in agriculture. EXIM Bank Supports export import initiatives throughout the country. Thus, they have set up EXIM Bank Agricultural University Bangladesh (EBAUB), a private agricultural university at Chapainawabgang, Rajshahi. =EXIM Bank Hospital= A 5-storied building having 10,000 square feet of floor space at 840 Kazi Para, RokeyaSarani, Mirpur, Dhaka-1216 has been hired to set up Exim Bank Hospital.

Critics charged that patients at the VHA hospitals had not met the target of getting an appointment within 14 days. In some hospitals, the staff falsified appointment records to appear to meet the 14-day target. Some patients died while they were on the waiting list; reports differ about whether they died because of the delay. Defenders agreed that it was unacceptable to falsify data, but the 14-day target was unrealistic in understaffed facilities like Phoenix, and most private insurers did not meet a 14-day target either. By most measures, the VHA system provides \\"excellent care at low cost,\\" wrote Paul Krugman, who believes that the attacks on the VHA system are motivated by conservatives who want to discredit a government program that works well. Conservative legislators have proposed privatizing the VHA, and legislative reforms will make it easier for veterans to go to private doctors. CNN reported on April 30, 2014 that at least 40 United States Armed Forces veterans died while waiting for care at the Phoenix, Arizona, Veterans Health Administration facilities. By June 5, 2014, Veterans Affairs internal investigations had identified 35 veterans who had died while waiting for care in the Phoenix VHA system. An investigation of delays in treatment throughout the Veterans Health Administration system is being conducted by the Veterans Affairs Office of the Inspector General, and the House has passed legislation to fund a $1 million criminal investigation by the Justice Department. On May 16, 2014, the Veterans Health Administration's top health official, Dr. Robert Petzel, retired early at the request of Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki. On May 30, 2014, Secretary Shinseki resigned from office amid the fallout from the controversy. As of early June 2014, several other VA medical centers around the nation have been identified with the same problems as the Phoenix facility, and the investigations by the VA Inspector General, the Congress and others are widening. An internal VA audit released June 9, 2014 found that more than 120,000 veterans were left waiting or never got care and that schedulers were pressured to use unofficial lists or engage in inappropriate practices to make waiting times appear more favorable. On June 11, 2014, the Federal Bureau of Investigation opened a criminal investigation of the VA. President Barack Obama ordered a White House investigation. On June 27, 2014, Obama's Deputy Chief of Staff, Rob Nabors, reported \\"significant and chronic system failures\\" and a \\"corrosive culture\\" inside the Veterans Health Administration. In August 2014, Obama signed Congressional legislation regarding funding and reform of the Veterans Health Administration. Background The Veterans Health Administration, a division of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, is responsible for providing health care to U.S. military veterans, and is one of the largest healthcare operations in the United States, with dozens of hospitals and medical facilities across the nation. It has had a long and troubled history. =Goals for patient wait times= Timeliness of care was an important goal to the VHA. In 1995, VHA established a goal of scheduling primary and specialty care medical appointments within 30 days to ensure veterans‚Äô timely access to care. VHA began collecting patients wait time data in 2000 for which the then-General Accounting Office (GAO) reported inaccuracies. By July 2002, VA reported to Congress that over 300,000 veterans nationwide were either forced onto waiting lists or forced to wait over six months for a medical appointment. Despite questions raised by GAO and the VA Office of Inspector General as to the validity of VA's performance in providing timely care to veterans, VHA shortened the wait time goal to 14 days for both primary and specialty care medical appointments in fiscal year 2011. In fiscal year 2012, VHA added a goal of completing primary care medical appointments within 7 days of the desired date. A .ZIP file containing both the full report and a set of partitioned sections. =VA caseload= Healthcare workload on VA increased substantially from 2007 to 2013. VA experienced an increase of 46% in outpatient visits from 63 million in 2007 to 92 million in 2013. Also, inpatients treated increased 11% from over 811,000 to nearly 902,000. A .ZIP file containing both a four volume report and a PowerPoint slide show. There are fundamental problems at the Veterans Health Administration of staffing being inadequate for aging Vietnam veterans and for more recent veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan who may have complex health challenges such as traumatic brain injury, multiple limb amputations and prosthetics, diabetes and post- traumatic stress disorder. Testimony Before the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Committee on Veterans' Affairs, House of Representatives, U.S. Congress =VA funding= In 2013 the VA spent $41.5 billion on Veterans‚Äô healthcare, an increase of 16% from 2007 ($36.2), while the number of individual patients increased by 18% from 5.5 million in 2007 to 6.5 million in 2013. Recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan increased demands on VA resources with the number of veterans of these wars who went to VA for care increasing 200% from 2007 to 2013, The Veterans Benefits Administration also received an additional $1.2 billion as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. In early June 2014, soon after the scandal became public, the U.S. Senate passed a $500 million aid bill for the VA. =Merit pay bonuses & previous reports of preventable deaths= As of April 2014, the VA had paid approximately \\"$200 million for nearly 1,000 veterans‚Äô wrongful deaths\\". Agency spokesperson Victoria Dillon said that ‚Äúany adverse incident for a veteran within our care is one too many,‚Äù but the deaths were a small fraction of the 6 million veterans which receive VA care each year. The House Committee on Veterans‚Äô Affairs held a hearing on preventable patient deaths in VA facilities in September 2013 during which representatives accused the VA of failing to discipline the officials responsible for patient deaths and instead providing performance bonuses. For example, VA regional director Michael Moreland received a bonus of approximately $63,000 and a five-page performance evaluation that made no mention of an outbreak of Legionnaires‚Äô disease that led to the deaths of six veterans and illness for 21 others at a Pittsburgh VHA hospital for which Moreland was responsible. =Previous reports of inaccurate data and subsequent manipulation= The then-General Accounting Office (GAO) has issued reports since VA started gathering data in 2000 on veterans' wait times to be scheduled for an appointment and these GAO reports have called into question the reliability, and validity, of VA's wait time data. The VA Office of Inspector General (OIG) reports in 2005, 2007, and 2008 found the reported outpatient waiting times to be unreliable because of data integrity concerns associated with VHA‚Äôs scheduling system., The discrepancies found by the OIG between requested appointment times documented in medical records and in the databases, and incomplete waiting lists are attributed to patient preference or the scheduler‚Äôs use of inappropriate scheduling procedures. (rescinded VHA Directive 2009-070, VHA Directive 2006-055) Veterans Affairs officials warned the Obama-Biden transition team in the weeks after the 2008 presidential election that the department should not trust the wait times that its facilities were reporting. According to a 2010 VA memo, the problem of \\"gaming strategies\\" inside the VA to meet performance goals dates to at least 2008. VA Deputy Undersecretary for Health Administrative Operations William Schoenhard wrote, \\"It has come to my attention that in order to improve scores on assorted access measures, certain facilities have adopted use of inappropriate scheduling practices...\\" Schoenhard listed 24 tactics identified in a 2008 study as inappropriately reducing the official measures of patient wait times. Examples =Phoenix Veterans Health Administration system= In one example, 71-year-old U.S. Navy veteran Thomas Breen was rushed to the Phoenix VA on September 28, 2013, with \\"blood in his urine and a history of cancer.\\" His family said that he was sent home with instructions that he was to be seen within \\"one week\\" by a primary care doctor or urologist, and a note on his patient chart said the situation was urgent. After being sent home, his family said that they were told that there was a seven-month waiting list and that there were other critical patients. Thomas Breen died on November 30, 2013. His death certificate shows that he died from bladder cancer. His family said that the VA called on December 6, 2013, to make an appointment after Breen had died. Dr. Sam Foote, who retired after 24 years of service with the Phoenix VA system, went public with allegations against the VHA in comments to CNN in April 2014. He said that there was an \\"official\\" list at the Phoenix VA that was sent to Washington officials and showed that appointments were timely, and an unofficial list where veterans may wait for care for more than a year. Foote said, \\"The scheme was deliberately put in place to avoid the VA's own internal rules\\". He said that workers at the Phoenix VA were intimidated into complying with the deception. \\"They have families, they have mortgages and if they speak out or say anything to anybody about it, they will be fired and they know that.\\" =Austin Veterans Health Administration system= A scheduler at an Austin, Texas, VHA care clinic said that the practice of \\"zeroing out\\" delays in appointments \\"wasn't a secret at all\\" at the clinic, and he was instructed by a supervisor in how the process worked. The Austin scheduler said that said \\"zeroing out\\" was a practice of falsifying information in the VA‚Äôs records system that Washington officials used to monitor patient wait times. =Ft. Collins, Colorado and Cheyenne, Wyoming= VA Deputy Undersecretary for Health Administrative Operations William Schoenhard wrote a memo on March 15, 2013 indicating that the VA was changing its performance measure for appointment wait times. The new goal involved measuring the number of days between a veteran's desired appointment date and the actual date of the appointment. A VA Office of the Medical Inspector report from December 2013 showed a dramatic change in March 2013 of the number of appointments booked within the 14-day window for the Ft. Collins, Colorado outpatient clinic. When investigators asked VA employees to explain \\"what occurred in March 2013\\" the employees said that \\"they were instructed by Business office staff to access the appointment schedule, review it for capacity, inform the Veteran of schedule availability, and then enter the Desired Date as the patient appointment date\\" and \\"By entering the Desired Date as the appointment date, the wait time ‚Ä¶ appears to be zero days.\\" The Ft. Collins clinic is overseen by the Cheyenne, Wyoming, Veterans Affairs office. A coordinator at the Cheyenne office sent an email on June 19, 2013 with instructions on how to manipulate the appointment dates. The coordinator wrote, \\"Yes, it is gaming the system a bit, but you have to know the rules of the game you are playing.‚Äù As of June 23, 2013, the United States Office of Special Counsel is investigating reports that two schedulers at the Ft. Collins facility were reassigned to Wyoming after they refused to comply with instructions to falsify information about patient wait times. The VA Office of Medical Inspector has substantiated a report that punitive action was taken against employees who scheduled appointments in a way that honestly showed that appointments would take place outside of the 14-day window, and the OMI also substantiated reports of other problems at the facility such as a shortage of medical providers and attempts to hide evidence of cancelled appointments. =Columbia, South Carolina= A VA inspector's September 2013 report noted that due to mismanagement, thousands of patients at the VA Medical center in Columbia had their appointments for colon cancer screenings delayed. This resulted in over 50 patients having a delayed diagnosis for colon cancer and some later died from the disease. Additionally, a 2008 report indicated that documents that were critical in the processing of veterans' disability claims had been shredded. Although this had occurred at at least 40 locations nationwide, the Columbia location had the most cases.(1/5 of the overall cases) Also, between 2009 and 2013, the backlog of disability claims in Columbia more than doubled from 33% to 71%. Investigations and findings =Internal VA investigations= An audit from the Secretary of Veterans Affairs said, \\"some front-line, middle, and senior managers felt compelled to manipulate\\" records to meet performance goals. The manipulation of records was done with the knowledge of senior managers in the Phoenix VA system and possibly those of other VA facilities. Investigations are ongoing as of May 31, 2014. However, a VA Inspector General's report issued on August 26, 2014, reported that six, not forty, veterans had died experiencing ‚Äúclinically significant delays‚Äù while on waiting lists to see a VA doctor, and in each of these six cases, ‚Äúwe are unable to conclusively assert that the absence of timely quality care caused the deaths of these veterans.‚ÄùThe VA Isn‚Äôt Broken, Yet; Inside the Koch brothers‚Äô campaign to invent a scandal and dismantle the country‚Äôs most successful health care system. by Alicia Mundy, Washington Monthly, March/April/May 2016.]Review of Alleged Patient Deaths, Patient Wait Times, and Scheduling Practices at the Phoenix VA Health Care System VA Office of Inspector General, Veterans Health Administration. August 26, 2014. Pub. No. 14-02603-267 An official report from the VA Inspector General \\"found that about 1,700 veterans in need of care were 'at risk of being lost or forgotten' after being kept off an official waiting list.\\" Schedulers for the Veterans Health Administration were instructed to change the dates for which veterans had requested an appointment in order to hide delays. At the Phoenix VA, \\"official data showed (veterans) waited an average of 24 days for an appointment. In reality, the average wait was 115 days.\\" Shinseki called the situation \\"reprehensible\\". Former VHA doctors were not surprised by the findings. At least 1700 veterans at the Phoenix VA who wanted an appointment were never placed on an official wait list. The VA's Office of Inspector General called the manipulation of appointments at the Phoenix VA a \\"systemic\\" problem and called for a nationwide audit. As of May 30, 2014, 42 VA medical centers were under investigation for their scheduling practices. The VA OIG reported in May 2014 that 17 veteran deaths had occurred while waiting for VHA treatment in the Phoenix VA system, and on June 5, 2014 the Acting Secretary of Veterans Affairs, Sloan Gibson, reported that the VA had identified 18 additional deaths. The 18 deaths were among the group of 1700 identified as \\"at risk of being lost or forgotten\\". Griffin said that autopsy reports would need to be investigated to determine if the deaths were caused by the delays in treatment. An internal Veterans Affairs audit released June 9, 2014 found that: * More than 120,000 veterans were left waiting or never got care * Pressures were placed on schedulers to use unofficial lists or engage in inappropriate practices to make waiting times appear more favorable An updated audit released June 19 found: * Tens of thousands more veterans that previously reported wait more than a month for an appointment * Disparities between reported wait times and actual wait times Senator Tom Coburn, (R) Oklahoma, released a year-long investigative report that suggests the number of veterans who died while awaiting delayed care or treatment over the past decade may number as high as one thousand. =FBI investigation= On June 11, 2014, the Federal Bureau of Investigation opened a criminal investigation of the VA. =Congressional investigation= On June 20, 2014, the U.S. House Veterans Affairs Committee learned that every one of the 470 senior executives in the VA received performance evaluations that indicated they were at least \\"fully successful\\" in each of the past four years. Congressional representatives argued that the data shows that senior management in the VA is out of touch with the problems in the department. Republican Representative Phil Roe said, \\"Do you think that‚Äôs normal in business, that nearly every executive is successful? That means you put the bar down here, so anybody can step over it.\\" Democratic Representative Ann McLane Kuster compared the situation to grade inflation. Senior executives were paid a total of $2.4 million in bonus compensation in the most recent year. Gina S. Farrisee, VA assistant secretary for human resources and administration, admitted in her written comments that the department needed to do better at holding executives accountable. =Obama Administration investigation= President Obama's Deputy Chief of Staff, Rob Nabors, reported to Obama on June 27, 2014 that he found \\"significant and chronic system failures\\", a \\"corrosive culture\\", damaged morale, and a need for additional staff. He reported that the goals for wait times for appointments of no more than 14 days are unrealistic, that data about patient wait times had been falsified by VHA employees, that there are a variety of problems with safety and integrity within the VHA, and that transparency and accountability are lacking. In response to the report, the Republican chair of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, Representative Jeff Miller, said, \\"It appears the White House has finally come to terms with the serious and systemic VA health care problems we've been investigating and documenting for years\\" and that he would work with the White House to fix the problems. The independent chair of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, Bernie Sanders, said, \\"No organization the size of VA can operate effectively without a high level of transparency and accountability. Clearly that is not the case now at the VA.\\" =Office of Special Counsel investigations= The United States Office of Special Counsel sent a letter to President Obama indicating that the VA Office of Medical Inspector used a \\"harmless error\\" defense against allegations of unsafe practices at the VA including unsanitary conditions and delays in treatment. Investigations by the Office of Special Counsel supported claims such as high levels of bacteria at a clinic and an 8-year wait for a VA psychiatric inpatient to receive an initial evaluation. OSC said it is currently reviewing more than 50 allegations of unsafe practices at the VA and has referred 29 cases for further investigation. U.S. Special Counsel Carolyn Lerner wrote in the letter that \\"These cases are part of a troubling pattern of deficient patient care at VA facilities nationwide, and the continued resistance by the VA, and [Office of Medical Inspector] in most cases, to recognize and address the impact on the health and safety of veterans\\" and that \\"veterans‚Äô health and safety has been unnecessarily put at risk\\" by the \\"harmless error\\" defense. OSC substantiated numerous claims of unsafe practices at Jackson, Mississippi VA facilities including improper credentialing and illegal prescribing of narcotics. Lerner said that \\"Despite confirming the problems in each of these (and other) patient-care areas, the VA refused to acknowledge any impact on the health and safety of veterans seeking care.\\" Acting VA Secretary Sloan Gibson said that he accepted the OSC's recommendations and had directed a review of the Office of Medical Inspector that was to be completed in two weeks. Gibson said \\"I am deeply disappointed not only in the substantiation of allegations raised by whistleblowers, but also in the failures within VA to take whistleblower complaints seriously.\\" =RAND Corporation investigation= The Congress commissioned a study of VA by the RAND Corporation, which was published early in 2016. Among the study's findings were: that the care provided by the VA was generally as good as, or better than, other health-care providers (according to most criteria used in the study), and, that there was no widespread evidence of long waiting times generally in the VA (although in a few places some veterans did experience long wait times) and, that most veterans get their appointments within a few days of their preferred date for care. Specifically, more than 90 percent of appointments for already-enrolled patients, and 80 percent of appointments for new patients, occur within two weeks of the desired date. Responses =May and June 2014= Politicians from both Republican and Democratic parties have commented on the scandal. Democratic Representative Steve Israel said that \\"It's a shame that when Republicans had a chance to help vets get their benefits from the V.A., they blocked a solution\\", referring to Republican opposition to the 2013 Veterans Backlog Reduction Act. Democrats, led by Senator Patty Murray, have aggressively sought more money for veterans' services since the second term of President George W. Bush. Many Republicans have countered that the problems in the VA are ones of management rather than funding and that Obama Administration officials are responsible for not discovering the patient backlog. Republican Representative Jackie Walorski said that the VA had \\"bureaucracy run amok\\" and noted a case in Atlanta where \\"two top officials were able to retire early and three were reprimanded\\" over three preventable deaths. At the end of May 2014, bipartisan agreement emerged among Democratic Senator Barbara A. Mikulski and Republican Senator Richard C. Shelby on the Senate Appropriations Committee to include funding for civil and criminal investigations into Veterans Affairs in a veterans spending bill. Democratic President Barack Obama's chief of staff, Denis McDonough, said on May 18, 2014 that Obama was \\"madder than hell\\" about the reports of delays in treatment. McDonough said that \\"At the same time that we're looking at accountability we want to continue to perform to provide our veterans the services that they have earned.\\" On May 21, 2014, in a vote of 390‚Äì33, the House of Representatives passed the Department of Veterans Affairs Management Accountability Act of 2014 (H.R. 4031; 113th Congress). The bill would give the Secretary of Veterans Affairs the authority to remove or demote any individual from the Senior Executive Service upon determining that such individual's performance warrants removal or demotion. The House members who sponsored the bill argued that, although federal workers can be fired, the process is extremely lengthy, sometimes taking years, and that the officials who are \\"under scrutiny for neglecting veterans actually received tens of thousands of dollars in bonuses and positive performance reviews.\\" Florida Republican Representative Jeff Miller, who sponsored the bill, said that \\"this bill would simply give the VA Secretary the authority to fire or demote VA Senior Executive Service employees based on performance, similar to the authority the Secretary of Defense already has to remove military general officers from command or how I am able to fire someone who works for me on my staff.\\" The United States House of Representatives was also scheduled to consider the bill \\"Demanding Accountability for Veterans Act of 2013\\", related to the scandal. Eric Shinseki, Secretary of Veterans Affairs, resigned on May 30 because of the scandal. On May 30, 2014, Shinseki apologized and accepted responsibility for the scandal. Later that day he formally resigned as Secretary of Veterans Affairs. On May 30, 2014, The Hill reported that the Senate was expected to consider legislation related to the VA scandal during the week of June 2, 2014. Their legislation was expected to address both the need to improve the healthcare that was being provided to veterans and the poor management of the Department of Veterans Affairs. Also on May 30, 2014 the House passed by a 321‚Äì87 vote the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015 (H.R. 4660; 113th Congress) which authorized a $1-million appropriation for a criminal investigation by the Justice Department. On June 5, 2014, Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, and Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, announced a bill that would allow veterans who wait for health care for more than 30 days or who live more than 40 miles from a VA facility to instead see private doctors who already provide services through other government programs. On June 10, 2014, the House voted 426‚Äì0 to pass the Veteran Access to Care Act of 2014 (H.R. 4810; 113th Congress), a bill that would allow United States veterans to receive their healthcare from non-VA facilities under certain conditions. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the bill would cost about $620 million over the 2014‚Äì2016 period. Rep. Jeff Miller, who sponsored the bill, said that the wait times veterans were forced to face was \\"a national disgrace.\\" On June 11, 2014, the Senate voted 93‚Äì3 to pass the Veterans' Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act of 2014, the bill written by Senators McCain and Sanders to reform the VA. Chairman of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs Jeff Miller said that \\"many of the provisions included in today's Senate-passed bill are based on ideas that have already cleared the House, so I'm hopeful both chambers of Congress can soon agree on a final package to send to the president's desk.\\" Miller was referring to the House's Veteran Access to Care Act of 2014 (H.R. 4810; 113th Congress) which contained similar provisions and passed the House on June 10, 2014. Acting VA Secretary Gibson said he plans to fire some VA executives under an expedited process as soon as he is given the authority by Congress to do so. In late June 2014, VA General Counsel Will Gunn and VA Acting Undersecretary for Health Robert Jesse stepped down from their positions. Other changes in June 2014 included: * Moving more than $390 million inside the VA budget to fund care for veterans outside the VA system; * Deploying mobile VA medical units; * Ending the goal of providing appointments within the 14-day window that Nabors criticized as unrealistic and said may have \\"incentivized inappropriate actions\\"; * Posting twice-monthly public updates of VA wait times; * Banning performance bonuses; * Removing some senior managers from the Phoenix VA system; * Leadership emphasis on protecting whistleblowers from retaliation. =July 2014= Appointment of Robert A. McDonald Robert A. McDonald replaced Shinseki as Secretary of Veterans Affairs. President Obama nominated former Procter and Gamble CEO and US Army veteran Robert A. McDonald as the permanent replacement for Shinseki as Secretary of Veterans Affairs. Paul Rieckhoff, CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said that \\"If the president doesn't make VA a priority, Superman can't do this job.\\" House Speaker John Boehner and American Legion national commander Daniel Dellinger also commented that new VA secretary would need Obama's support to make changes in the VA. McDonald was sworn into office on July 30, 2014. His first message to VA employees stressed the importance of integrity. Legislation passed in Congress The Veterans' Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act of 2014 was passed by the House and Senate before their August recess to add $16 billion in supplemental funding for the VA, with $10 billion for allowing some Veterans to receive private medical care at taxpayer expense, and $6 billion for increasing the number of VA staff. The Act also gives the VA Secretary expanded authority to fire managers who perform poorly, and authorized the VA to lease additional facilities. =August 2014= Sloan Gibson, who had been Acting Secretary between the time of Shinseki's resignation and McDonald's taking office, is now Deputy Secretary. He said on August 6, 2014 that more punishments were planned for VA officials for their roles in the scandal. The VA announced the week prior to Gibson's statement that two supervisors would be fired and four other employees would be disciplined for their roles in falsifying data in Colorado and Wyoming. The VA previously announced plans to fire three executives at the Phoenix VA. ‚ÄúThese were the first in what I expect will be a long series of announcements of personnel actions,‚Äù said Gibson. On August 7, Obama signed the VA funding and reform legislation in a ceremony at Fort Belvoir, an Army installation in the State of Virginia. \\"This bill covers a lot of ground, from expanding survivor benefits and educational opportunities, to improving care for veterans struggling with traumatic brain injury and for victims of sexual assault,\\" said Obama, and gives the VA Secretary \\"more authority to hold people accountable... so that he can move quickly to remove senior executives who fail to meet the standards of conduct and competence that the American people demand.\\" As of August 15, VA data showed that the number of veterans who were waiting more than three months for an appointment has declined by half since Spring 2014, but the number who wait at least 30 days remains similar. Reported wait times for repeat patients have increased from 3.5 days to nearly 6 days. The VA paid for nearly 200,000 veterans to see private doctors, and average wait time to see a primary care doctor decreased from 51 to 43 days. August 26, 2014, Obama announces 19 sweeping executive actions aimed at improving access to quality VA healthcare, increasing mental health services, eliminating veteran homelessness and ensuring service members have the employment and education resources necessary to assist with their transition out of the military. =September 2014= At a Senate hearing on September 9, 2014, Acting VA Inspector General Richard J. Griffin reported that investigations are continuing into the Phoenix VA, including a review of \\"possible criminal misconduct by VA senior hospital leadership\\". Griffin also reported that \\"Since July 2005, OIG published 20 oversight reports on VA patient wait times and access to care yet VHA did not effectively address its access to care issues or stop the use of inappropriate scheduling procedures. When VHA concurred with our recommendations and submitted an action plan, VA medical facility directors did not take the necessary actions to comply with VHA‚Äôs program directives and policy changes.\\" In his spoken testimony, Griffin said that in \\"three-fourths (of the VA facilities investigated for falsification of wait time data), we're pretty confident that it was knowingly and willingly happening, and we're pursuing those.\\" He also said he hopes to complete his office's investigations into possible criminal misconduct by the end of 2014. If his office finds criminal misconduct, it will then refer cases to U.S. attorneys for possible prosecution. Senator Richard Burr said that the \\"culture that has developed at VA and the lack of management and accountability is simply reprehensible.\\" In his testimony, Secretary Bob McDonald apologized \\"to all Veterans who experienced unacceptable delays in receiving care at the Phoenix facility, and across the country. We at VA are committed to fixing the problems and consistently providing the high quality care our Veterans have earned and deserve in order to improve their health and well-being.\\" He discussed actions taken at the Phoenix VA facility in response to Inspector General findings, and he discussed national initiatives to change VA's culture, measure patient satisfaction, improve access to care, and improve accountability (including a restructuring of the Office of Medical Inspector). On September 18, 2014, VA published the Federal Register its intention to increase the annual salaries of new physicians and dentists by up to $35,000 as part of a nationwide recruitment effort to hire more doctors and improve veterans‚Äô access to care. The notice will take effect on Nov. 30. VA Secretary Bob McDonald said the department needs new doctors, nurses and clinicians for 28,000 jobs authorized by Congress in the 2014 Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act. At a House Veterans Affairs Committee hearing on September 18, Griffin said that delays at the Phoenix VA \\"contributed to\\" but did not \\"cause\\" the deaths of veterans, an assertion that was challenged by Committee members. Another witness at the hearing, Dr. Sam Foote, said that \\"This report is at best a whitewash and at worst a feeble attempt at a cover- up\\", and alleged that the report omitted information about 293 veterans who died waiting for healthcare. Foote also faulted McDonald for allegedly not increasing VA's transparency as he had promised. =October 2014= On October 7, the VA announced that it is firing four additional employees, subject to the results of appeals. Deputy Secretary Gibson said that \\"VA will actively and aggressively pursue disciplinary action on those who violates our values. There should be no doubt that when we discover evidence of wrongdoing, we will hold employees accountable.\\" *The director of the Pittsburgh VA is being fired for \\"conduct unbecoming a Senior Executive\\" after an outbreak of Legionnaire's Disease in 2012 and a subsequent investigation. \\"VA officials knew about problems and dangers with the medical center's water system, but did not disclose that information for almost a year.\\" *The director of the Dublin, Georgia VA is being fired after \\"the hospital's staff closed out more than 1,500 patient appointments to hide long wait times.\\" *The director of the central Alabama VA system is being fired after a variety of problems were found by the VA Inspector General, including long wait times that some schedulers were instructed to conceal. *The Deputy Chief Procurement Officer is being fired. According to the Inspector General, she \\"improperly disclosed non-public VA information to unauthorized persons, misused her position and VA resources for private gain, and engaged in a prohibited personnel practice.\\" Rep. Jeff Miller. Republican of Florida, chairs the House Veterans Affairs Committee. He said that the new VA law gives agency officials five days to respond to notices of intent to fire them. The director of the Georgia VA retired four days in advance of VA's announcement that he would be fired, and the procurement official also retired in advance of her firing. The procurement official was nearly hired by the U.S. Department of Energy before that department learned of the findings against her at the VA. Miller said that \\"If any current laws or regulations are impeding the (VA)‚Äôs ability to swiftly hold employees accountable, VA leaders must work with Congress so those laws and regulations can be changed\\", and ‚ÄúVA appears to be giving failing executives an opportunity to quit, retire or find new jobs without consequence.\\" He said he opposed allowing officials who had committed misconduct being allowed to ‚Äúslip out the back door with a pension.\\" =November 2014= The official in charge of the Phoenix VA facility, who had been on administrative leave for almost seven months, was fired. While on administrative leave, she was paid over $90,000. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz, said that the payments were \\"a completely unacceptable use of taxpayer dollars that should instead go to providing care for veterans.\\" Dr. Sam Foote said that the firing was \\"a good first step\\" and that \\"I think there are a lot of others who need to follow her out the door.\\" The VA temporarily appointed a new manager for the southwest region of the United States. The southwest region includes the Phoenix VA facility. The new manager was previously involved in clandestinely placing a camera inside the hospital room of a patient in Florida. She later said that the manner of the camera's placement was \\"wrong\\". The Republic reported that \\"(she) at first said she authorized the videotaping because nurses were upset and wanted to prove family members were committing medical sabotage. Moments later, she said there was no intention to keep the filming secret from the Carnegies, and the camera was really approved for patient safety.\\" She said that she has previously been assigned to problematic hospitals during her career, including those with ethics violations or financial problems, and has been successful at fixing the problems. = February 2015 = Secretary McDonald made two controversial statements in February. On a February 15, 2015 airing of Meet the Press, McDonald claimed that 60 U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs employees had been fired due to the VA's wait time scandal. Later, he backtracked and clarified it was only 8 employees that lost their jobs. On February 23, 2015, McDonald admitted he misspoke to a homeless veteran on January 30, 2015 about his serving in the U.S. Army special forces, a conversation that was recorded by a CBS television news crew accompanying him during a nationwide count of homeless veterans. \\"I have no excuse, I was not in the special forces\\" he told The Huffington Post, which first broke the story. The Huffington Post reported that \\"special operations forces\\" includes the Army Rangers and that McDonald \\"...completed Army Ranger training and took courses in jungle, arctic and desert warfare\\" and \\"...While he earned a Ranger Tab designating him as a graduate of Ranger School, he never served in a Ranger battalion or any other special operations unit.\\" = April 2015 = The New York Times reported that in contrast to previous statements about the number of firings related to the scandal \\"new internal documents show that the real number of people removed from their jobs is much smaller still: at most, three\\". The Department of Veterans Affairs did not dispute this number, but said that disciplinary action is being taken against over 100 other employees. Congressional Republicans were outraged. Representative Jeff Miller said. \\"‚ÄúRather than disciplining bad employees, V.A. often just transfers them to other V.A. facilities or puts them on paid leave for months on end,\\" and \\"‚ÄúEveryone knows accountability is a major problem at the department.\\" Miller said that he would introduce new legislation to hasten the firing process. Raymond Kelley, legislative director for Veterans of Foreign Wars, said that ‚ÄúThe government firing system is so cumbersome bad employees can continue to be paid for years,‚Äù and ‚ÄúWe need to show them you can no longer hide just because you have a government job, unclog the middle management that appears to be part of the problem and get the right people in those positions.‚Äù = April 2017 = On April 27, 2017 President Trump signed Executive Order 13793, titled \\"Improving Accountability and Whistleblower Protection at the Department of Veterans Affairs.\\" Comments from management experts, health care experts, and economists Management experts said that the source of the problem was setting an unrealistic goal of a 14-day wait. This was compounded by not including provisions for measuring how well the system was working. Experts said that having high-stakes goals, especially without checks and balances, encouraged \\"gaming the numbers\\" and cheating, in the private and public sector. Managers at the Federal level should have had data about times and costs for basic services throughout the VA system. That would have identified the Phoenix facility as anomalous. Dr. Robert Roswell, a previous VA Undersecretary of Health and now Professor of Medicine at the University of Oklahoma, said that an appropriate measure of VHA performance was not patient wait times, which were largely outside the control of the staff, because VHA employees do not control the number of patients seeking care. A better measure of performance, would for example, measure the efficient use of VHA resources, such as the number of no-show appointments. Phillip Longman, author of \\"Best Care Anywhere: Why VA Care Would Work Better for Everyone,\\" said after visiting VA hospitals nationwide that, as the result of veterans in New England, the Mid-Atlantic and the industrial midwest either dying or retiring to Sunbelt states, there is an imbalance of capacity, with empty beds in some VHA hospitals and waiting lists in others. Compounding this problem, more liberal eligibility standards allow veterans to get treatment for chronic conditions of aging like heart disease and Parkinson's.VA Care: Still the Best Care Anywhere? by Phillip Longman, Washington Monthly, June 3, 2014 \\"Setting a benchmark of 14 days to see a new primary care doc at a VA hospital or clinic in Boston or Northern California may be completely reasonable,\\" wrote Longman. \\"But trying to do the same in Phoenix and in a handful of other sunbelt retirement meccas is not workable without Congress ponying up for building more capacity there.\\" Economics Nobel laureate Paul Krugman said that the scandal came about because conservatives did not like the fact that the VHA system, which is \\"an island of socialized medicine,\\" is working well, so they seized on wait times as ‚Äúa gift from God‚Äù to discredit the VHA.... \\"It‚Äôs still true that Veterans Affairs provides excellent care, at low cost,\\" ... \\"Those waiting lists arise partly because so many veterans want care, but Congress has provided neither clear guidelines on who is entitled to coverage, nor sufficient resources to cover all applicants. And, yes, some officials appear to have responded to incentives to reduce waiting times by falsifying data.\\"...\\"Yet, on average, veterans don‚Äôt appear to wait longer for care than other Americans,\\" ... \\"And does anyone doubt that many Americans have died while waiting for approval from private insurers?Veterans and Zombies: The Hype Behind the Health Care Scandal, Paul Krugman, New York Times, June 19, 2014 See alsoWalter Reed Army Medical Center neglect scandal *Merit Pay ¬ß Federal Government Merit Pay *Pay-for-Performance (Federal Government) References External links Senator Dick Durbin's Press Conference on the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act 2014 in American politics 2014 in Arizona 2014 in the United States History of veterans' affairs in the United States Medical scandals in the United States Obama administration controversies United States Department of Veterans Affairs ","title":"Veterans Health Administration scandal of 2014"},{"id":"42917637","text":"John Gyles (died c. 1406) of Dover, Kent, was an English politician.

The cave lies under the Drachenfels, a hill in the borough of Bad D√ºrkheim, which is linked to the legend of the Nibelung. Other renovations and the enclosure of spaces and natural monuments took place the following year. A short time later, probably around 1875, the new club was given the Laura Hut (Laurah√ºtte) in Leistadt, which it had not built itself, but was able to use the legacy of the Retzer family from Freinsheim. From 1896 the club built its most expensive structure: the Bismarck Tower on the Peterskopf. Innumerable new refuge huts were built and countless renovations of buildings and natural sites followed.

Gameplay For a second time, the player has to take up control of the Thunder Ceptor (which has undergone a colour change); there are also two more commands in this sequel than there were in the original game, and two different types of powerups have been introduced. The colour of the enemies has been changed from gray to green, and most of the older ones have been renamed - several new ones have also been introduced as well, and the obstacles (there are also three new types of them as well here) can now be killed by firing a bomb at them (which means the player will no longer have to fly into them all to remove them from the game at the expense of having the Thunder Ceptor's power decrease by one once it is resurrected).

It was this second play, following The Square Ring. It is a comedy set in Adelaide just after the Crimean War about the locals fearing a Russian invasion. It is based on a real incident. Plot In 19th century Adelaide, after the Crimean War, Colonial Administrator Colonel Beauchamp, trains a volunteer defence corps at the weekends, and worries about a Russian invasion. Idealistic schoolteacher Higsen, who is in love with Beauchamp's daughter, is more concerned with free education. Higsen asks Beauchamp to marry the latter's daughter but is turned down because education must give way to defence. When a Russian gunboat is rumoured to be near Adelaide, Beauchamp sets about whipping up the public into a frenzy in order to fund a standing army. Background Peterson said he was told the story about a rumoured Russian invasion by his grandmother when he was a child. He came across the story years later when researching another project and decided to write it. \\"It was amazing how Adelaide was completely swept away by the invasion scare,\\" said Peterson. \\"Why, I don't know.

With his company, Dessim Ltd, he earned millions for the Soviet Union. His most important scientific invention was the building material silikaltsiit (Laprex), which was developed through the execution of the disintegrator system. His inventions are still widely used in Germany, Austria, the United States, Japan and Russia. Over 200 scientific publications, 62 inventions and 28 patents are accredited to his name. Early life and education Johannes Rudolph Hint was born in Kuusn√µmme, a small fishing village in the west of Saaremaa island, Estonia, on 20 September 1914. His father, Alexander Hint, was a sailor and a member of the government in the Estonian Republic. His mother, Mare Hint, was a housewife. In 1933, Hint graduated from Saaremaa Gymnasium with a concentration in science. From 1933 to 1934, he undertook an undergraduate degree in mathematics at Tartu √úlikool (Tartu University), and from 1935 to 1936, he continued his studies in the same technology department, majoring in building technology. In 1941, he graduated as a building engineer from Tallinn's Polytechnic Institute. Career From 1961‚Äì1966, Hint was the head of operations of The Soviet Union Institute of technological research and projects of Silikatsiit (Silicalcite/Laprex) and between 1974‚Äì1981, the head of the construction and technological limited company Desintegraator (Disintegrator), which he established. Desintegraator (Disintegrator) joined forces with Austrian company Simmering-Graz-Paucker in 1977 and together they established an international company \\"Dessim\\", which was the first and possibly, the only successfully run business collaboration between the Soviet Union and the Western World. Scientific activity Hint experimented with Rotary Impact Mill or Contra Rotating Mill ‚Äì Disintegrator for decades. The Disintegrator processed the mixture by fine grinding and mechanical activation of material components with water, which further strengthened autoclave effects. Silicatsite (Laprex) factories were opened initially in Estonia but then all over the Soviet Union as well as in Japan and Italy. His company did not only concentrate on building materials but also manufactured and distributed universal disintegrator-activator and UDA technology. From 1978‚Äì1981, the Disintegrator began trial production of biotechnological products. Especially, popular were food preparations that contained bio-active substances, which although sometimes regarded as \\"quack remedies\\" were distributed, not only across the Soviet Union, but also to the western world. The medical qualities and effects of two of the preparations, AU-8 (for internal use) and L-1 (for external application), were identified, after, Johannes Hint had been rehabilitated and production had been stopped. At a later date, these preparations were widely acknowledged as food preservatives, as journalist Siim Kallas confirmed in his 1988 article published in \\"Rahva H√§√§l\\", since similar biological samples, heralded the nutrition therapy boom in the west, a few years later. Political activity Hint became a member of the Estonian Communist Party between 1941 and 1943. He was persuaded by his brother Aadu Hint, who later became a famous author in the Soviet Union. In 1943, he was arrested by the Nazis, who were occupying Estonia, as Hint was blacklisted as a communist. He was put to Nazi concentration camp in Estonia to await his execution. He managed to escape from the camp and flee to nearby Helsinki, Finland on a little fishing boat, crossing the Gulf of Finland in the middle of the night. His plan was to flee to nearby neutral Sweden, as Finland was allied with Nazi Germany, at the time. But, Hint failed, and was arrested in Helsinki, and placed in a war prisoners‚Äô camp. He was returned to his native Estonia after the end of Second World War. Estonia, then was occupied by the Soviet Union. By the end of the 1960s, Johannes had become deeply disappointed in the Soviet political system, and became what can be described as a \\"free mind\\", keeping a unique individualism and distance from the political and social ideologies of the communist regime. He was openly vocal to his friends and co-workers about his feelings against Soviet Rule. Johannes Hint, also had connections with members of the underground resistance, the Estonian Democratic Movement. Death On 13 November 1981, Hint was arrested by the government officials under fabricated charges of embezzlement and forgery against him. The court case was finalized in December 1983.

It is a crossover of 8 Out of 10 Cats and game show Countdown. The show follows the format of Countdown, but with hosts and contestants from 8 Out of 10 Cats, and an emphasis on the humour seen on 8 Out of 10 Cats. History The formation of the crossover began as a series of specials, the first of which was conceived on 2 January 2012, when Channel 4 orchestrated a special \\"mash-up night\\", merging two shows to form a special edition of the pair, as part of its 30th-anniversary celebrations. Amongst the programmes that were chosen to be merged for the evening of specials, production teams on Countdown and 8 Out of 10 Cats agreed to combine the two formats of their respective programmes ‚Äì the crossover between the two formats meant that Countdowns arrangement of games would be interspersed with 8 Out of 10 Cats- style banter. As part of the merger, both Rachel Riley and Susie Dent assumed their roles from the programme, while Jimmy Carr took on the mantle of host, with both Sean Lock and Jon Richardson competing as contestants, and Joe Wilkinson joining Dent during the crossover's recording. Following the first special, Channel 4 ordered another crossover special for 24 August 2012 as part of Channel 4's \\"Funny Fortnight\\", featuring the same cast as before, along with the appearances of David O'Doherty and former Countdown contestant Clarke Carlisle. In April 2013, a further two specials were ordered by the network, expanding on the merged formats but featuring the same cast, albeit with Lock unable to attend due to ill health and leading to Lee Mack standing in for him. As part of the expanded format, both Mack and Richardson were joined by an additional contestant each, for each special ‚Äì Rhod Gilbert, Rob Beckett, Stephen Mangan and Richard Osman ‚Äì with Dent joined by Tim Key and Henning Wehn respectively during recordings. On 9 July 2013, owing to favourable ratings from the specials, Channel 4 announced its decision to commission a full series of six episodes of the crossover, which was aired from July to September. Following the first series, the network ordered additional series for 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017. On 13 July 2018, Channel 4 aired a special edition of the crossover series as part of commemorations towards 100 years of women's suffrage in the United Kingdom. As part of the special, all male members of the cast and crew were replaced, leaving the episode to feature an all-female cast ‚Äì Katherine Ryan acted as host, while Roisin Conaty, Sara Pascoe, Jessica Hynes and Lolly Adefope participated as the contestants, with an appearance by Morgana Robinson as Natalie Cassidy. Format Each episode lasts one hour, including advertising breaks, although the January 2012 special lasted only 30 minutes. Since the first one-third of the programme is occupied in introducing the panel, and due to the comedy interspersed between and during rounds, the game does not consist of the standard 15 rounds. Carr asks each panelist if they have a 'mascot', and the panelist will then indulge in some prop comedy, usually showing off a ludicrous or impractical object and telling a humorous story. The first few specials had different numbers of rounds ranging from 7 to 10. In the first two full series of the show, there were either 8 or 9 rounds. The first three- quarters of the show contained a letters round and a numbers round; the last section had a letters round, a numbers round (if there was time) and a conundrum. More recent series featured rounds involving two contestants participating in humorous activities, such as being blindfolded and identifying props that were spelt with nine letters. The letters and numbers rounds are the same as in Countdown, and there are also \\"Teatime teasers\\". The conundrums and teatime teasers typically contain sexual words or innuendos but with usually innocent answers, such as \\"GONADTIP\\" (clue: \\"One way to become a parent\\", answer: \\"ADOPTING\\"). Whilst the clock is ticking, as the contestants attempt to find a word within 30 seconds, Carr often takes part in some form of unusual or non-sequitur activity such as trying to get a dog through an obstacle course, stacking a house of cards or enticing a bird of prey to fly onto his arm. Either Riley or Dent (the latter to a lesser extent) are occasionally involved in these segments. These segments do not take place in the numbers rounds. Apart from during the first two specials, there are two contestants on each team, with Richardson and Lock as permanent guests. During some rounds, contestants all offer an answer, but only the best answer from each team counts. During some rounds, one player per team is nominated to answer. A celebrity appears in Dictionary Corner, and, after each numbers round, they present a poem, song or another comedic segment. Susie Dent's \\"Origin of Words\\" section does not appear but is instead replaced with an additional segment from the guest. In earlier episodes, Joe Wilkinson appeared as Riley's assistant in the second half of the show, often dressed in costume whilst using props. The humour continued throughout the series, such as Wilkinson offered special prizes, replacing letter tiles with symbols, or turning up despite having been \\"fired\\".

The building underwent renovation in 2012 and was meant to be named as the Juan Luna e-Services Building. The facade of the building was preserved However lack of investors hindered Araneta's plan and the Juan Luna Building was purposed as a mixed-used building that also serves as a living museum =2018 fire= Past midnight of May 28, 2018, a fire broke out at the nearby Land Management Bureau Building. By 8am (PST +8:00), the fire has reached the Juan Luna Building. The third floor and portions of the fourth floor of the Juan Luna Building were affected by the fire. The 150 Plaza Cervantes building and the Moraga Mansion were also affected by the fire which was put out around 4pm The incident is suspected to be caused by arson due to the timing of the start of the fire. The National Archives of the Philippines office hosted in the Juan Luna Building was affected by the fire although the agency stated that no historical documents were burnt since it keeps these in their offices in Paco and Ermita.  Architecture and design The five-storey Juan Luna Building was designed by American architects Murphy, McGill and Hamlin of New York City and Shanghai, and was completed at a cost of two million pesos. Occupying about of an irregularly shaped corner lot adjacent to El Hogar, it has a frontage of on General Luna Street and on Muelle de la Industria, along the Pasig River. The building derived its design from the trademark architectural features set by the International Banking Corporation of New York for its overseas branches. The bank‚Äôs prototype was made up of a row of colossal columns in antis, which was faithfully reproduced for its Manila headquarters. The ground floor was fully rusticated to effect a textured finish. This floor had arched openings with fanlights emphasized by stones forming the arch. The main doors were adorned with lintels resting on consoles. Above the ground floor were six three-storey high, engaged Ionic columns, ending in an entablature topped by a cornice. These six columns dominating the south and west facades were, in turn, flanked by a pair of pilasters on both fronts. The fifth floor was slightly indented and also topped by an entablature crowned by strip of anthemion.

The team was one of the first teams to compete in women's football. Astrio won the first competition, 1971/72, they won from Anderlecht and gained the first National Championship. The following year Astio was again the best and claimed the second National Championship. In 1975 they won again and claimed so their third National Championship in first 4 years time. The first unofficial Belgian women's Cup was organised in 1975/75. Astrio faced Saint-Nicolas FC Li√®ge in the final, but lost their final. Since 1977 an official Cup was organized. Saint-Nicolas FC Li√®ge was beaten in 1977 after penalties, and so claimed their first Cup. Also in 1978 en 1979 the Cup went to Astrio. In the early-1980s it became more difficult for Astrio. The club played the first years sub top but after a while they dropped further down the table. in 1984 they played another Cup final but lost from Brussel D71. The 1990s were the darkest times for the club. In 1994/95 they have to forfeit and demote to Second Division in 1995/96. They also had to forfeit that year and had to demote to the Provincial Division. And so the team had to leave the National football after 24 years. In 1999 Astrio re- erected again and became champion and returned again to the Second Division. Due a reformation of the Women's League Astrio had to play in the newly formed Third Division. In 2007 the club name was changed to Ladies Heist-op-den-Berg or Ladies Heist for short. Ladies Heist became second that year but because there was a free spot they got also a Promotion to the Second Division. In 2008 there was a fusion with K.S.K. Heist, who already played several years in the Men's National Division. In 2011/12 KSK Heist returned after 16 seasons back to First Division and finished 11th place. The next year BeNe Liga was created and became the highest division. KSK Heist stayed in First Division and won 2nd place and in 2013/2014 they finished 3rd. As for season 2014/2015 KSK Heist finished 6th also the previous formed BeNe League ceased to exist and the Super League Vrouwenvoetbal was formed. KSK Heist got the final ticket for the league and climbed back to the highest division.

It is situated in the Toodyay valley, north east of Perth. The Toodyay valley, discovered by Ensign Robert Dale in 1831, was opened up for settlement in 1836. The original site for the town of Toodyay was determined in 1836 and its boundaries were finalized 1838. The first survey of the town was carried out in 1849. After several serious floods, the decision was made to move the town of Toodyay to higher ground. In 1860, the new town of Newcastle was established further upstream. Newcastle was renamed in 1910 to Toodyay, and the original site became known as West Toodyay. Map of West Toodyay, 1910, Cons 3868 item 395 Old Toodyay The town of Toodyay was established on the banks of the Avon River where the valley gave way to gentle slopes of fertile soils with hills on all sides. The original site for the town of Toodyay was determined by Governor James Stirling in 1836. The survey of its boundaries was finalised in December 1838 after the necessary adjustments had been made to the boundaries of two neighbouring land grants. Apart from the erection of the Military Barracks on the left bank of the Avon River, little development of the town could take place until after the first official survey had been carried out. Assistant Surveyor Arthur Hillman carried out this survey in September 1849 at a time when the Avon River was in flood. Most of the subsequent development took place along the right bank of the Avon River. River Terrace was aligned to the curve of the river's course and was crossed by six streets. Town lots along River Terrace were numbered R1 to R42, \\"R\\" indicating the right bank of the river. Along the ridge behind, North St and Fitzgerald Terrace paralleled the curve of River Terrace. Town development quickened after the arrival of the convict era and the setting up of the Toodyay Convict Hiring Depot at the townsite in 1851. A total of three inns were established: The Royal Oak, The Highland Laddie and The Queen's Head. A number of homes, stores, schools and a church were built. Governor Malcolm McCusker continuing the tradition of attendance, and opening the 160th Toodyay Show in 2013 A second Royal Oak, owned by John Herbert, became the centre of social activity for the town. In November 1853, the Toodyay, Northam, and Victoria Plains Agricultural Society was formed at a meeting held at the Royal Oak. Thereafter the Society's annual events, which included an Annual Show, were held at the Royal Oak in either October or November of each year. Some forty years later, and after several name changes, the Society became known as the Toodyay Agricultural Society. For many years it has been customary for the Governor of Western Australia and other dignitaries to attend the Toodyay Agricultural Show, which is held each year in October. In 1852, the Toodyay Convict Hiring Depot was moved to a new and larger site approximately upstream from the original townsite of Toodyay. Following severe flooding in 1857 and 1859, a new town was established in 1860 on that land which was excess to the requirements of the convict hiring depot; it was named Newcastle, after the Duke of Newcastle. The town of Newcastle was gazetted on 1 October 1860. West Toodyay Over the following years, Newcastle's name became confused with that of Newcastle in New South Wales. On 6 May 1910, the Western Australian town of Newcastle was renamed to Toodyay and the original town of Toodyay became known as West Toodyay. In 1920 the West Toodyay School was closed and its 24 students were transferred to the Toodyay school as part of the \\"consolidated schools\\" plan, an experiment based on practices in the US and Canada where larger schools were considered more advantageous to children's education. In 1928 the West Toodyay school building was sold by tender and removed. Railway The location \\"West Toodyay\\" on the Western Australian Government Railways narrow gauge railway system was the point where the Clackline-Miling railway headed north, and crossed the Avon River. With the development of the standard gauge railway line through the Avon Valley in 1966, West Toodyay was a junction where the narrow gauge Miling railway connected with the newer standard gauge system, and a marshalling yard existed. In the deregulated railway system, West Toodyay yard is now a shire depot, a crossing loop location, and a junction where the Miling railway proceeds north over the Avon River. During the era of the Spirit of the West railway service, the location was also known as the Avon Siding, due to the lack of any crossing or shunting facility at the Toodyay railway station site. Historic significance The precinct is listed on the Shire of Toodyay's Municipal Inventory as having a \\"considerable\\" level of significance, with historic aesthetic and social value. The area includes: * Church of Sancta Maria * Everett's Cottage * Ford crossing * James Forbes' store * Reserve and well * Samuel Ferguson's cottage * The Highland Laddie * The Queen's Head * The Royal Oak (1849‚Äì1851) * The Royal Oak (1853‚Äì1860) * Toodyay Barracks * Toodyay Convict Hiring Depot (1851) * Toodyay Gaol * Toodyay Valley School * West Toodyay Bridge * West Toodyay School See also Toodyay pioneer heritage trail Notes References ","title":"West Toodyay"},{"id":"42918563","text":"Okoyemovka () is a rural locality (a selo) in Kurbusakhsky Rural Okrug of Ust- Aldansky District in the Sakha Republic, Russia, located from Borogontsy, the administrative center of the district and from Us-Kyuyol, the administrative center of the rural okrug.Registry of the Administrative-Territorial Divisions of the Sakha Republic Its population as of the 2002 Census was 221.

She graduated from Srishti School of Art Design and Technology in fine arts. She is a former Ashoka Fellow and works towards gender sensitization. She has been bringing attention to sexism and harassment in forms such as eve teasing, a form of sexual harassment which is very common in India. She established Blank Noise for the same purpose. Career She started the Blank Noise as a student project at Srishti in Bangalore in 2003 which has since spread out to other cities in India and globally. The purpose of Blank Noise was to create gender sensitisation regarding street harassment and eve teasing. The project exclusively works towards tackling gender-based violence. It intends to shift the blame of eve teasing from victims to the perpetrators. It also provides legal counselling in case women want legal redressal for sexual harassment. It works on ground with victims and is trying to suggest tougher laws against street harassment while improving on the existing ones. The project addresses the issue with innovative ways such as street performances and confrontational protests. Initially, Jasmeen started with going to Colleges but later came to the conclusion street activism would be more effective. Jasmeen also uses new and mainstream media to spread awareness around the topic. She has created a blog which brings together diverse groups of people through discussions, questionnaires, testimonials, and photographs. People often volunteer to participate in Blank Noise's public performances and campaigns. Jasmeen has consciously sought new communities with which to collaborate, including youth groups, volunteers from slums, women bus conductors, police, and men. Jasmine plans to expand Blank Noise to Pakistan along with more towns and cities in India. She has been a TED and an Ashoka Fellow.  Personal life  Born in Kolkata, her family migrated to India from Burma in the 1960s. Her grandmother has been a strong influence in her life. As a child she used to put up posters around the city, trying to create awareness around cleanliness. She started engaging in activism from her time in college as an undergraduate student when she realized that street harassment was a systemic problem.

The film was shot at the temple town of Kukke Subramanya, Sakleshpur, Kuduremukha and Yadiyur, all in Karnataka state.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack totally consists of 6 songs out of which 4 are composed by Manikanth Kadri and remaining two are by E. S. Murthy. The audio launch was held on 14 March 2009 at a hotel in Bangalore. The first print of audio CDs and Cassettes created a controversy by wrongly crediting the song \\"Marali Mareyagi\\" to Bollywood singer Shreya Ghoshal in the place of Anuradha Bhat. Music composer Manikanth Kadri blamed the Anand Audio company for this error while the company owner put the error on the producer of the film. Upon release, the soundtrack was immensely popular and was on top of the charts for many weeks. \\"Marali Mareyagi\\" and \\"Ale Aleyo\\" songs were very well received.

Serving as the gateway to Manila's Chinatown of Binondo, the plaza is located at the foot of Jones Bridge in the west end of Escolta Street. It was named after a Franciscan friar, Fr. Fernando de Moraga and it is by the opinion of many, that were it not for him, the history of the Philippines would turn out differently from what it is now.  History  Plaza Moraga came to develop during the American colonization period. It was the place where you can find superb restaurants, commercial establishments and foreign embassies. One of the familiar places- to-visit here was the Clarke's Cafe which opened in 1899. They were known for selling ice cream. = Fernando de Moraga = The Venerable Fernando de Moraga was born in one of the towns in the province of Salamanca, Spain. In 1597, he visited the Philippines and stayed for a short period near Plaza Dilao in Paco and some of the towns in Bulacan and Laguna. In 1607, he was appointed as the parish priest of Santa Ana. In Intramuros, he also became the local Superior of the San Francisco Convent some years after his duty in Santa Ana. He was elected as the Chapter president before being delegated to the General Chapter in Spain in 1616. He reached Spain in 1619 while traveling barefooted through the Middle East while begging, evangelizing and baptizing along the way. Fr. Moraga has convinced the King, through his persuasion and knowledge on the colony to revoke the decree and keep the Philippines during that time when King Philip III of Spain had issued a decree that included surrendering the Philippines.  In Recent Years  Binondo Chinatown Arch on Plaza Moraga Plaza Moraga has now become a plaza occupied mostly by cars and a big parking space is designated on one of the corners. There are still commercial buildings surrounding the plaza including the Savory Restaurant, only one of the surviving establishment from its glory years and also known for their chicken but the famous ice cream parlor is already closed. In June 2015, the world's largest Chinatown arch was built on the south side of Plaza Moraga at the entrance to Binondo from Jones Bridge in celebration of the city's 444th founding anniversary as well as the 40th anniversary of Philippines-China diplomatic ties. Funded as a gift from the city government of Guangzhou, it measures 63.8 feet high and 74 feet wide, higher than Washington, D.C. Chinatown's Friendship Archway.

David uncharacteristically wore a suit to his vocal session, as well as a pair of clear glass black horn-rims. He looked so small as he sat at a large office desk (bureau, in French), with a tiny desk lamp shining down on some lyric- less blank paper (presumably there some squiggly lines in a strange shorthand notation to indicate what and where he would sing). His hands lay palms down, fingers splayed to either side of the paper, and he never moved them except during the instrumental section, to reach for a glass of water that stood in the shadows to one side. The entire vocal was written improvisationally with those in the control room making suggestions as to which parts worked and David memorizing them on the spot. The only lyric that came from that improvisation was the chorus, in which he sang 'Blahnd, blahnd, blahnd'. His head moved like a muppet and we all watched, fascinated, as if he were a bug on a pin under a microscope. Jonathan Demme, you shoulda been there with your camera! [referring to Demme's direction of Stop Making Sense, Talking Heads' 1984 concert film]\\" Music Video Directed by Annabel Jankel and Rocky Morton, the music video for \\"Blind\\" is unusual among Talking Heads' videography in that it portrays an elaborate narrative over the course of the song. Apparently lampooning the 1988 United States presidential election, the video portrays a group of Americans (among them a literal Bible thumper) electing a sentient, malevolent monkey wrench into public office. At its victory rally, the wrench, shown bearing human teeth, continuously shouts and spits into a jubilant crowd as his aides smugly watch on. However, as the video progresses, the crowd becomes more aware of the wrench's malevolence, with their joy turning into confusion, fear, and eventually distress.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ut5tHfbaJA Midway through the video, a group of people at the front of the crowd investigate a dragon's-head faucet at the face of the wrench's podium; an aide then fires his gun into the faucet, only to be blown back into the crowd behind him.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ut5tHfbaJA Eventually, the wrench is overthrown by both the crowd and his own lackeys, being uprooted from his podium and thrust into the distance. The wrench shrinks in size as this goes on, eventually reaching the size of a toy before being caught by a smiling infant. The video ends with a freeze-frame shot of the infant's fist clutching the once-malevolent tool.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ut5tHfbaJA At various points, the video intercuts to footage of a shirtless David Byrne against a solid black background, singing and gesticulating at the camera.

Biography  Cour √† Clichy (etching, 1910) Les bless√©s - Parc de Saint-Cloud (etching, 1915) Auguste Brouet was born and raised in a poor family in the popular north-east quarters of Paris and in Les Lilas, in the near suburbs. While apprenticed to a lithographer, he struggled for artistic education through the evening drawing classes of Eug√®ne Quignolot (Dijon, 1847- Jouarre, 1921), also briefly attending Gustave Moreau's atelier. Starting from around 1895 he would make a living by doing hack work for fashionable artists and also crafting reproductive etchings in color, in the workshop of . Around 1902 he started to devise original etchings, sometimes larger pieces in color, more often smaller works in black and white, as was the growing trend at the time. In the 1920s, his etchings came under strong demand both in France and in the United States, in the wake of the Print Revival. At that time, he also produced a significant body of book illustrations, most notably for Devambez, under the direction of Edouard Chimot. This period of prosperity ends with the Great Depression, from which the print market never quite recovered. Brouet died in 1941 in poverty.  Style  The art of Auguste Brouet belongs to the classical tradition. Brouet remained almost completely impervious to the modernist trends developing at the time. There are two characteristics which make a Brouet etching unmistakable: * a certain expressive looseness of the drawing, which in his best work blends magnificently with his use of light and shades * a very keen and sympathetic eye for all the lower social categories, their daily activities and shabby surroundings. Even his war subjects display this inner restraint and brooding mood which are so distinctive of his work. As to books, he devised illustrations for a dozen volumes. Not surprisingly he came out at his best with texts inspired by Naturalism, such as Edmond de Goncourt's novel Les Fr√®res Zemganno or Joris-Karl Huysmans's collection of short stories Le Drageoir aux Epices.

A right-handed batsman, Armitstead was a member of a cricketing family: his brother Henry played first-class cricket, while brothers John and Robert, and nephew William, all played school cricket. Armitstead played fourteen first-class matches between 1853 and 1862, the majority for Oxford University with solitary appearances for the Gentlemen of the North, Manchester Cricket Club, and the Marylebone Cricket Club. Armitstead was also a founding member of the Free Foresters Cricket Club, along with his brother Henry. It was during a match between a United England XI and the Free Foresters in 1861 that he is credited with the introduction of the white coat for cricket umpires. Armitstead requested that the umpires wear something white, as their existing garments were causing him to lose sight of the ball and the bowler's hand during delivery. Armitstead had a modest batting record, scoring only 293 runs in twenty-five innings at a batting average of 12.20. 249 of these runs were made for Oxford, for whom he made eleven appearances. His best was a score of 38, made opening the batting against the Marylebone Cricket Club on 3 June 1853. He took six catches, and is noted as having bowled however his bowling style or statistics are not recorded. He also played non-first-class at county level for Oxfordshire, Cheshire (while also playing at club level for Sandbach), and one match in 1863 for Shropshire.Published under Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians. Armitstead was educated at Westminster School and Christ Church, Oxford. After graduating at Oxford he was ordained as a Church of England priest and was vicar of Goostrey, Cheshire, from 1862 until his death there in 1907.

The new organization retains the granting programs of the two former organizations as well as two media programs originally created at the American Music Center: NewMusicBox and Counterstream Radio. American Music Center The American Music Center (AMC) was a non-profit organization which aimed to promote the creating, performing, and enjoying new American music. It was founded in 1939 as a membership organization by composers Marion Bauer, Aaron Copland, Howard Hanson, Harrison Kerr, Otto Luening, and Quincy Porter. For many years the main activity of the Center was the accumulation of a library of American music which accepted score submissions from all composers who joined as members. The Center's library, which eventually contained over 60,000 individual scores, featured published materials as well as unpublished manuscripts, many of which were unavailable elsewhere. (On June 29, 2001, the entire collection was transferred to The New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center.\\"AMC Library Moves to NYPL at Lincoln Center\\", NewMusicBox.org (2001).) In the 1950s, the Center created a program to commission, perform, and record new American orchestral works, which resulted in 18 commissioned orchestral works, 72 performances, 12 recordings, and a Pulitzer Prize for John La Montaine's Concerto for Piano and Orchestra. In the early 1960s, the Center initiated its Copying Assistance Program, later renamed the Composer Assistance Program, which gave grants directly to composers to assist in the preparation of performance materials. In subsequent decades, the Center established additional grant programs including one which funded the live performance of music at dance presentations. In 1999, the American Music Center launched the web magazine NewMusicBox, and, in 2007, Counterstream Radio, a 24-hour online station broadcasting music by United States composers. It had grants for composers and ensembles, and offered professional development resources for new music professionals. Meet The Composer Meet The Composer was a United States organization founded in 1974 by the composer John Duffy as a project of the New York State Council on the Arts and the American Music Center. It sought to assist composers in making a living through writing music by sponsoring commissioning, residency, education, and audience interaction programs. Meet The Composer's mission was, \\"to increase opportunities for composers by fostering the creation, performance, dissemination, and appreciation of their music.\\"\\"NPO Spotlight: Meet The Composer\\", PhilanthropyNewsDigest.org.\\"Opportunities: New Music USA / Grants / Call for Musicians\\", ArtistTrust.org.\\"EarShot Partners \\", EarShotNetwork.org.

The museum is housed in the old Concepcion Mansion, owned by the former mayor of Pasig, Don Fortunato Cabrera Concepcion who served from 1918 to 1921. This magnificent structure was built as a gift to his wife, Victoria Concepcion. A native of Pasig, architect Felizardo M. Dimanlig, designed this Spanish-Baroque mansion and completed it in 1937. Today, the museum showcases the timeline of the history of Pasig, as well as collections of objects corresponding to periods of historical development of Pasig. It is in the poblacion area, at one end of Plaza Rizal, in Barangay San Jose. Architecture The three-storey mansion's design was inspired by the Neo- Castillian style of architecture. It has a terra-cotta roof which makes the mansion one of the three remaining structures in Pasig that uses the material. Its interior was designed in an ornate revivalist style fashionable during the pre-war era. Fifteenth-century wooden flooring, which originally came from the old Pasig Cathedral were used in the mansion and remained intact until now. There were marble flooring and stairs as well. It has an azotea, where one can see the Pasig Cathedral, facing the mansion. History =Family history= Photo of the Mansion during the 1950s Before the mansion was completed, the former mayor's wife died. The couple had three children: Cristino, who had two children; Cristina, who died at an early age; and Jose who married \\"Naning\\" but had no children. Cristino's children were Cristino II and Vina Concepcion who married Luis Gonzales. When siblings Cristino II and Vina died, the childless couple Dr. Jose Concepcion and \\"Naning\\" were the last heirs of the mansion. The mansion was bought in the 1980s by the municipal government of Pasig under the administration of Mayor Emiliano Caruncho. It was transformed into the Pasig Library and Museum. =Significant events= Commonwealth era During the early Commonwealth period, President Manuel L. Quezon visited the Concepcion mansion to drink pure carabao milk and had some non- political conversations with Don Concepcion. Later that evening, the former mayor and his men became President Quezon's followers. World War II The place where the American flag was hoisted During World War II, the mansion was used by the Japanese as their headquarters and detention center. On February 19, 1945 the American flag was raised at the veranda below the tower of the mansion to signify the liberation of Pasig from the Japanese forces. Renovations The Concepcion Mansion was renovated and inaugurated as the Pasig City Museum in 2001 and has been a venue for exhibits, presentations, musical performances, art workshops and book launchings. In 2008, another renovation was done on the interiors to transform it into a full-blown museum. Some of the antique furniture still remains. The garden was transformed to a hall where presentations and workshops are held.

Biography He was born in Istanbul (1908). He graduated from the Academy of Fine Arts (department of Architecture). Between 1931 and 1932 he travelled to France, England and Germany with a scholarship of the academy. In 1932 he opened his own office, also started teaching at the Academy of Fine Arts and continued until retirement in 1978. In 1934 he worked for the National Architecture Seminar in Turkey which was a complete disaster for him because of the discussions between modern architecture and traditional architecture. In 1938 he designed the Turkish Pavilion in New York Exhibition. Sedad Hakkƒ± Eldem represented Turkish Republic at International Union of Architects in Lozan (1948) after Second World War. Also in the same year Sedad Hakkƒ± worked with his colleague Emin Onat on the project of ƒ∞stanbul Palace of Justice. He worked on proportions and architectural organizations of Ottoman domestic houses, 18th and 19th century palaces and mansions. He was known as a role model and pioneer to reinterpret the Classical Ottoman Patterns in modern architecture. He was a part of Former Artifacts Maintain Council (Eski Eserleri Muhafaza Enc√ºmeni) between 1941 and 1945 and also a part of Supreme Council of Antiquities and Monument Real Estate (Gayrimenkul Eski Eserler ve Anƒ±tlar Y√ºksek Kurulu) between 1962 and 1978. His thought was about nationalizing the Modern Architecture. He basically thought that International Style in architecture should not applied everywhere. Some things should be changed in the design by considering the national and domestic texture. He has won the international Aga Khan Award for Architecture in 1986 with the project of Zeyrek Social Security Facilities. He died on 7 September 1988 in ƒ∞stanbul. Architecture Sedad Hakkƒ± Eldem's architecture has basically 4 main periods. The first of them, between 1928 and 1934, is known by the instability of his work. After that, the second period is popular with modern trials on Ottoman architectural organization. The time frame of this period spans from 1934 until 1952. The third period of his architecture has lost its Ottoman influence, it looks more modernized between 1952 and 1962. The last part of Eldem's Architecture known for his double approach on projects. This final period started in 1962, and lasted until his death in 1988. * The years between 1928 and 1934 are defined as preparation years for Sedad Hakkƒ± Eldem. During these years the architect worked in ƒ∞stanbul, Paris and Berlin but there is no remaining architecture. The only structure that has been built in that period is a temporary Turkish pavilion in Budapest Exhibition in 1931. This structure gives us few clues about his searching in architecture. While Sedad Hakki had tried almost every approach popular in these years, he also tried to combine them even if they all contradicted. He even give parts to different architectural elements in one design. For example, one of his trials in Paris, embassy project has Auguste Perret impressions in details, its planimetry has traditional middle \\"sofa\\" and \\"Eyvan\\" types of components that usually belong to Turkish Architecture. Also the architect inspired by a sheme that peculiar to Iran-Middle East, named \\"Cihar-baƒü\\". At the same time he examined the style of Art Deco, Le Corbusier, Hoffmann, Olbrich, Tessenow and Webb. Despite all of these and his instability of style, he never abandon his researches about traditional and domestic Ottoman civil architecture. He made use of all styles as much as they compromise with traditional architecture. The styles that do not overlap with domestic architecture, are disappeared.  Returning from Europe to ƒ∞stanbul does not affect the situation of Sedad Hakkƒ± Eldem's instability about architectural style. First examples in ƒ∞stanbul show different impacts. Ceylan Apartment (1933) has the signs of Art Deco, S.A.T.ƒ∞.E. Store and Administration Building (1934) has the features of International Style, in the other hands Firdevs Hanƒ±m House (1934) has Le Corbusier's elements. However all of the imaginary projects in Europe give their places to realistic projects in ƒ∞stanbul even if they are not built. Instead of huge and fancy mansions, at that time there were modest houses and buildings that published in the journal of Arkitekt comes up. * The instability period of the architect ends with Yalova Thermal Hotel (1934-1937) and Aƒüaoƒülu House (1936-1937) projects. Also these projects starts a new era for Sedad Hakkƒ± Eldem's architecture. He started to well known in Turkey with his architecture and approach to Modern Architecture. Yalova Thermal Hotel was the first nationalized modern work of Turkey. At these years, there was that discussion about interpreting in Modern Architecture. Sedad Hakkƒ± was one of the pioneers of defending the idea of nationalized modern architecture.  From 1934 to 1952 Sedad Hakkƒ± worked on some trials on traditional Ottoman houses' plan organizations and exterior elements in more modernized ways. These works are connected with his historiyografic researches. Eventually he tried to \\"invent the tradition\\" in modern aspects of his time. For example, Aƒüaoƒülu House designed with elliptical type of \\"sofa\\", Safyurtlu House (1942) with middle type of \\"sofa\\" and Aya≈ülƒ± Mansion (1938) designed with \\"karnƒ±yarƒ±k\\" type of \\"sofa\\" (that means split out from middle.). Some of his projects had have strong connections between international style and domestic tradition, in the other hand, traditional Turkish elements stay in the background just for being a little touches. For example, Ta≈ülƒ±k Coffee House (1947 - 1948) designed with T type of plan which is a traditional scheme, and international view kept in minimum. However, Admiral Bristol Hospital and Nursing House (1943) is just looks national from outside. Whereas the faculty buildings of Ankara University (1943-1945) and ƒ∞stanbul University (1942-1947) inspired from Nazi Germany. The Turkish part in these mass buildings just hiding in the details. * Between 1952 and 1962 Eldem's architecture keeps Ottoman civil architectural characteristic at minimum. Florya Facilities (1955-1959) and RIza Dervi≈ü House (1956-1957) built with more likely rationalized modernist style. Also that impact known by the name of \\"california modern\\". Hilton Hotel's (1952-1955) design shows us almost nothing about Sedad Hakkƒ± Eldem's architecture. In that process the hotel owes its standard American view to SOM despite of Eldem. Second Safyurtlu House (1952) is a successful example of American flort. * The years after 1960 known as being Eldem's and Republic of Turkey's leapig and changing years. The architect has two different approaches in these years. First of them is heroic and monumental, away from traditional and domestic perspective, like Akbank Administration Building and Ayazaƒüa Office Buildings. Other approach looks more like Sedad Hakkƒ± Eldem's. Eclectic and different trials on Ottoman civil architecture give their places to a vocabulary that Eldem's own. For Example horizontal roof line, wide canopies, well proportioned windows and cantilevers. These features used in the designs of Zeyrek Social Security Facilities (1962-1964), India Embassy Residence (1965-1968), Kƒ±ra√ß Mansion (1965), Sirer Mansion (1966-1967) etc. List of significant works First Period of His Architecture (1928 - 1934)  1931: Turkish Pavilion in Budapest Exhibition, Budapest  1932: Ceylan Apartment in Taksim, ƒ∞stanbul  1932: S.A.T.ƒ∞.E.

Named after its location across from Luneta (Rizal Park) on Kalaw Avenue in Ermita, it is one of the remaining structures that survived the Liberation of Manila in 1945. The hotel was completed in 1919. According to the study by Dean Joseph Fernandez of the University of Santo Tomas, the hotel was designed by the Spanish architect-engineer Salvador Farre. The structure is the only remaining example of French Renaissance architecture with Filipino stylized beaux arts in the Philippines to date. After being closed down and abandoned in 1987, the hotel was relaunched in May 2014 with the installation of a historical marker by the National Historical Commission of the Philippines. History Aerial photo of the Luneta hotel in 1930, to the left of the no-longer existing University Apartments During World War II, the Luneta Hotel became a brothel of American G.I.s who were off to Corregidor after Manila had been declared an open city. Surviving veterans of the war still recall how the hotel served as a hope when it survived the bombardment and how it was turned into a comfort area for soldiers facing imminent death. In its early years, the hotel became the site of European imports that were distributed to Manila. It was a time of beauty, innovation and peace. The hotel has been known to serve well-prepared breakfast and lunch, exotic among foreigners of the time. But the operations of the Luneta Hotel demanded high-maintenance and so it was neglected even by its owners.  Architecture  Designed by Spanish architect Salvador Farre, the Luneta Hotel on Kalaw Avenue was built in 1919. The six-storey building towered at an undefined T.M. Kalaw street upon its completion. It faced an unfenced Bermuda plane of the Luneta. Its neighbors were blocks of \\"stone houses\\" (bahay na bato) and \\"storerooms\\" (bodegas). It stood out because of its distinct architectural style. It symbolized the new influence that the Americans brought to the country. As once described by cultural writer and conservationist Bambi Harper, its \\"Mansard roof, French windows, carved details, attractive grilles and studied proportions\\" are reminiscent of French Renaissance architecture.

Serb community constitute slightly over one third of the entire population of Vukovar according to 2011 Census. Other significant communities include Croat majority, as well as Hungarians, Slovaks, Rusyns, Ukrainians and historically Yugoslavs, Germans, Jews, Vlachs and Turks. Town is seat of numerous ethnic organizations and institutions including the headquarters of the Joint Council of Municipalities and the Independent Democratic Serb Party. Surrounding rural region is ethnically heterogeneous with Serb rural communities constituting majority in physically adjacent Borovo and municipalities of Trpinja and Negoslavci.

Prominent Serbs from Croatia include Zaharije Orfelin and Sini≈°a Mihajloviƒá During the Croatian War of Independence Vukovar became one of the major hotspots of Serb-Croat ethnic conflicts, especially at the time of the Battle of Vukovar after which the town became de facto seat of the self proclaimed Serb Autonomous Oblast Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Syrmia. After the Operation Storm, signing of the Erdut Agreement and the end of the UNTAES mission of the United Nations gradual process of reconciliation started aimed at the establishment of sustainable peace. Despite absence of physical borders, Vukovar is often described as an ethnically divided town.

In 2013, this has re-ignited a political discussion on the matter, continuing on the 2009 local promulgation of Serbian Cyrillic as available for public use. Demographics The Croats were in the majority in most villages and in the region's eastern part, whereas the Serbs dominated in northwest. Vukovar's population was ethnically mixed and had 28 ethnic groups before the war. According to 2011 Croatian census, Serbian population of the town account 34.87% of Vukovar total population.

In 2011 95% of students in Serbian language classes were ethnic Serbs, while 86% of students in Croatian language classes were ethnic Croats. This model is developed in accordance with the Constitutional Act on the Rights of National Minorities in the Republic of Croatia and is used by Serb communities in Borovo, Marku≈°ica, Br≈°adin and other settlements in eastern Slavonia as well as by Hungarian minority in the region and Czech and Italian minority in Croatia. Long duration research established that among Serb parents in Vukovar support for the separated system of education was 73% in 2001, 66% in 2007 and 75% in 2011. Support among Serb students was 82% in 2001, 70% in 2007 and 68% in 2011. Among Croat students approval rate was decreasing from 80% in 2001, 72% in 2007 to 71% in 2011, and among parents from 66% in 2001, to 68% in 2007 to 55% in 2011. In 2011 an integrated curriculum in which only additional elective classes in Serbian language and culture will be provided was supported by 65% of parents and 49% of students in Serb community and 78% of students and 92% of parents in Croat community. Some authors argue that for successful integration of the two school systems in Vukovar multicultural and intercultural model needs to be develop which will result in compromise and change in both communities. Ethnic distance among students in Vukovar is larger than among their parents. ƒêorƒëe Ne≈°iƒá, director of the Cultural and Scientific Center \\"Milutin Milankoviƒá\\" expressed concerns that integrated education may lead to assimilation of Serb community while Milica Stojanoviƒá, Chairperson of the Education Board of the Joint Council of Municipalities expressed her opinion that the existing model is the best one for Serb community as it is preparing students for higher education both in Croatia and Serbia. Higher education at the local public Polytechnic Lavoslav Ru≈æiƒçka Vukovar is not provided in Serbian language. =Integrated School in Vukovar= In 2004 Zoran Milanoviƒá signed an international agreement on financial assistance with the Kingdom of Norway (with the minor contribution of Liechtenstein and Iceland) for the establishment of the so-called Integrated School in Vukovar. The agreement provided 1,3 million euros or 98% of the entire costs needed for the establishment of the school while Croatian Government enacted special curriculum for the school. As of 2017 there was not a singe student enrolled in the school resulting in Norwegian request for return of funding.

Political influence SDSS' 2019 European Parliament election jumbo poster in Vukovar. Serbs are playing prominent role in a political life of the town. Constitutional Act on the Rights of National Minorities in the Republic of Croatia is providing legal guaranties for the proportional representation of Serbs in all institutions of the town including proportional representation in the local Council. Since the end of the Croatian War of Independence member of the Serb community is guaranteed right to hold the post of town's vice-major. On October 2, 1997 Secretary-General of the United Nations Kofi Annan expressed concern that power sharing agreement between Croat and Serb political parties is not working well due to demonstrable lack of commitment by Croatian officials. As of December 2018 Serb vice-major of Vukovar was Srƒëan Milakoviƒá of the Independent Democratic Serb Party. The party was established in 1997 and its headquarters are located in Vukovar. It is dominant party controlling all mandates guaranteed to Serb community in Croatian Parliament. There is also non-parliamentary nationalist Party of Danube Serbs. Significant number of Serbs in Vukovar and eastern Slavonia traditionally vote for parties without ethnic name. The most popular among them is the Social Democratic Party of Croatia (SDP), successor of the League of Communists of Croatia, Croatian branch of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. Serbs in Vukovar may vote for SDP as a part of tactical voting against local Croatian nationalism. In 2015 Croatian political party Most accused the SDP of fictive votes by voters from Serbia. Most's statements were denied by the Ministry of Public Administration Arsen Bauk. In 2013 introduction of Serbian language in official use triggered Anti-Cyrillic protests in Croatia with situation remaining open political controversy. In January 2019 Mayor of Vukovar Ivan Penava of the Croatian Democratic Union said that Vukovar was the \\"epicenter of continued, creeping Greater Serbian aggression.\\" Some of the media reported that major will leave his party what he denied. Subsequently, he meet with the Prime Minister of Croatia Andrej Plenkoviƒá who stated that \\"HDZ policy was defined by the party leadership, while mayor Penava should deal with issues pertaining to the town of Vukovar\\". Prime Minister also stated that it is his party strategic interest to cooperate with the Independent Democratic Serb Party and the Serb community, policy which was based on the policy of the first Croatian President Franjo Tuƒëman and that major Penava should understand it even better as fellow citizens from Serb minority have supported him at the Vukovar elections. The town was criticized by Serbian right-wing nationalist Dveri movement for the exclusion of its Serb history as there is not a single street named after notable Vukovar Serb, Serb historical monuments are not promoted by the local tourism office and cultural events are not even mentioned in the town's annual almanac. =2010 Presidents Josipoviƒá-Tadiƒá Meeting= 2010 presidential meeting was characterized by a very performative daily agenda. President of Serbia Boris Tadiƒá and his delegation which included Ambassador of Netherlands in Serbia arrived to Vukovar on a Danube ferryboat Golubica (). Delegation started its visit by meeting the Major of Vukovar where they submitted documentation from the central hospital which was taken by Serb forces once they left the Republic of Serbian Krajina. President of Serbia then visited Ovƒçara camp where he issued apology for the Vukovar massacre and laid wreaths in respect to the victims. Flowing the visit both Croatian and Serbian presidents continued to Paulin Dvor where they both laid wreaths for the victims of the Paulin Dvor massacre. =Joint Council of Municipalities= Headquarters of the Joint Council of Municipalities, sui generis inter- municipal body formed on the basis of Erdut agreement, is located in Vukovar as well. Joint Council of Municipalities coordinates initiatives and proposals to the institutions of government, international organisations and NGOs. =Consulate General of the Republic of Serbia= The Consulate-General of the Republic of Serbia in Vukovar was established on 5 February 1998. The Consulate General is the only foreign representation in the town. On February 15, 2014, Statehood Day of the Republic of Serbia, Consulate General moved to its new building which was acquired from the Vojislav Stanimiroviƒá family who change it for an apartment in Belgrade. Consulate is a polling place during the elections in Serbia for Serbian citizens in the region. Before 2014 the Consulate General was located in a building without building permit completed in 1993 after the end of the Battle of Vukovar. The old building was purchased by the Town of Vukovar with an intention to open the Music School in it. Media In addition to national and regional media of Croatia other media houses are popular among the Serbs of Vukovar. Local Radio Dunav station broadcasting in Serbian language is located in Vukovar, while Radio Borovo is major Serbian language media in the region. As the town is located on the state border radio and television stations from Serbia are easily accessible in Vukovar with Radio Television of Serbia and Radio Television of Vojvodina broadcasting program for Serbs in eastern Croatia produced by Joint Council of Municipalities. Serbian language printed media include Novosti (published by Serb National Council), Bijela Pƒçela and Prosvjeta (published by Prosvjeta), Izvor (published by Joint Council of Municipalities) and Identitet (published by Serb Democratic Forum) as well as newspapers from Serbia. Serbian language media from Bosnia and Herzegovina are accessible and popular as well, especially RTV BN and Radio Television of Republika Srpska which have occasional programs about or targeted at local audience.

It is a 2¬Ω-story wood frame structure, with a broad gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. Its front is spanned by a single-story hip-roofed porch, supported by round columns with Doric heads. Its facade is spatially four bays wide, although the center-left bay is blank on both levels. There are two entrances, one each in the leftmost and center-right bays, and a large multi-pane window in the rightmost bay on the ground floor. Nine-over-six sash windows fill the same three bays on the second level. William Parker, descendant of one of the area's early settlers, is known to have operated a tavern and hostelry from his home, located near a crossing of the Piscataquog River built to accommodate the ship masts being transported on the road. It was used by members of the Parker family as a retail space until 1872. In the 20th century it was used a space for community groups, and was donated by the Parkers to the Goffstown Historical Society in 1973. The store was the nucleus of a village that was important enough in the 19th century to merit a station when the railroad was built into the area.

It is derived from cellulose and water, transforming lignocellulosic fibres from industrial biomass into a structural material suitable for various applications in the industrial sector. It is claimed to be non toxic, biodegradable and could be used as a replacement for many forms of hard plastics, as well as synthetic and chemical composites. History The original discovery of its basis occurred in 1897 by a German company M.M.Rotten in Berlin, patenting a method to produce a natural material utilizing cellulose. Almost 100 years later, three material researchers made advancements on the process that is the basis for Zeoform. This led to the creation, in 2005, of an Australian company which manufactured artisan products from the material. In 2008 Alf Wheeler, an Australian entrepreneur and businessman, joined the company as CEO and changed the focus from a ‚Äúproduct‚Äù company to a ‚Äúraw materials‚Äù company. Zeo IP Pty Ltd was then established in 2009 to protect and proliferate the material and the brand worldwide. Production Zeoform is derived from lignocellulosic biomass, such as hemp, cotton, bamboo, sisal, jute, palm, coconut and other cellulose feedstock. It is made without any glues, binders, chemicals or synthetics. The fundamental chemistry (and patented formula) causes a fibrillation (feathering) of cellulose micro-fibres (in water), then physical ‚Äòentanglement‚Äô and hydroxyl bonding through evaporation. The result is a super-strong, highly durable, consistent material that emulates wood & wood composites, resin composites, fibreglass and many hard plastics. Zeoform can be produced with various qualities ‚Äì from light styrofoam to dense ebony. The material is sustainable, compostable and sequesters carbon. Applications Zeoform can be used as a replacement for conventional materials in hundreds of industries, including construction grade flat sheets and curved panels to replace MDF, Masonite, Formica, Corian and other synthetic composites. Zeoform can be sprayed, moulded, pressed, laminated or formed using manual and mechanical processes. It can be produced in quantities ranging from small cottage industry to fully automated and robotic mass production. 3D Printing Zeoform intends to produce a 3D Printing ‚Äòfeedstock‚Äô, combining bio-polymers (natural resins) and other elements for an almost unlimited product range. Given the unique qualities of Zeoform, potential exists to develop a customized 3D printer in collaboration with industry leaders. Additionally, 3D printing provides sustainable mould-making capacity for mass- producing Zeoform products at reduced cost and environmental impact.

Built in 1895, it was the town's first dedicated library building, and also serves as a memorial to its military members. It served as a library until 2003, and is now home to the Pelham Historical Society. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2011. Description and history The former Pelham Library and Memorial Building is located on the north side of the town's village center, on the north side of Main Street adjacent to the 1846 Greek Revival First Congregational Church. It is a single-story masonry structure, built out of brick with wooden trim. It is covered by a hip roof and rests on a cut granite foundation. Its main facade is three bays wide, the center bay projecting and topped by a pedimented gable. The main entrance is recessed in this bay, under a rounded archway. The outside of the arch is decorated with projecting brickwork, and the building corners have brick quoining. Front- facing windows have large fixed panes topped by smaller transom windows. The building was designed by Frederick W. Stickney, and built in 1895-96. Its construction was funded by the town, in part to mark the 150th anniversary of its incorporation, and to provided a dedicated space for its public library, which had been housed in a variety of locations since its founding in 1797. It served as the town's sole library building until 2003, when that function was moved to a new building nearby.

He is thought to have been a follower of Caravaggio. Rodriguez' career was first recorded by Francesco Susinno in his Le vite de' pittori messinessi, dated 1724. Susinno writes that he had a humanistic education; he studied history and could read Latin. Alonzo was born in Messina, the son of a Spanish Captain of Cavalry, who had three sons who were painters. His brothers Antonio and Luigi went to Palermo and Rome (or Naples) respectively, while Alonzo went to Venice. He studied Veronese, Tintoretto and Titian. He became a proficient imitator of Titian, so much so that he was accused of forgery and removed himself to Rome. From Rome he went to Naples. By 1614 he was back in Messina, where he enjoyed success, turning out paintings in the style of the Venetian School and of Caravaggio. Alonzo's style of painting eventually went out of fashion and he fell on hard times. His lack of success and embittered old age earned him few followers, and these were of small importance. Susinno mentions only Jacopo Imperatrice (ca. 1592-1680), Placido Saltamacchia and Pietro Sollima. Rodriguez died in Messina of fever on 22 April 1648.

It links Eglwyswrw in the north of the county to Haverfordwest, the county town in the south, in an approximately southwesterly direction, crossing the Preseli Mountains. Before the 20th century, it was the main road linking Cardigan and Haverfordwest, and featured a number of inns to sustain travellers. The road is long and varies in elevation from above sea level. Much of the route is through farmland with scattered settlements, while the central section is through high moorland grazing with extensive views. History The road was the main link between Cardigan and Haverfordwest in mediaeval times; the future Henry VII of England would have used it to march from Haverfordwest to Cardigan between 2 and 4 August 1485 on his way to the Battle of Bosworth. In the 18th century, on the grounds that the road was badly in need of repair, it was turnpiked with a toll of six pence per cart by the 1790 Haverfordwest Roads Bill, though not without protests from parishes from Stephen's Ford, near Haverfordwest, to Cornel Fach (a.k.a \\"Morris the Bailiffs\\") in Castlebythe parish, on account of the hardship tolls would bring to local people. In Samuel Lewis's 1833 A Topographical Dictionary of Wales it is described as the \\"great road\\" from Cardigan to Haverfordwest. While the A487 (Cardigan to Fishguard) and the A40 (Fishguard to Haverfordwest) sections were later upgraded to trunk routes, the direct route was not, and was designated in the early 20th century road classification scheme as the B4329. From the 1920s to 1935, the B4329 was a multiplex with the A487 and an unclassified road from Boncath but reverted to the original start point in Eglwyswrw. The unclassified road became the B4332. Before that, when most journeys were made on foot, horseback or horse-drawn vehicle, travellers were provided for by inns along the route, such as those at Crosswell, Tufton, Greenway and Crundale. Extensive views From the high moorland, there are extensive views across much of Pembrokeshire with the Bristol Channel, St George's Channel and the Irish Sea beyond. On clear days there are views as far as the Gower Peninsula in the southeast, much of mid- Wales to the north as far as Snowdonia and the Ll≈∑n Peninsula as well as across much of the Preseli range. It is also possible, atmospheric conditions permitting, to see the tops of mountains in Ireland over 100 miles away. The Preselis are noted for their many prehistoric sites, some of which are close to the B4329. Because of the steep inclines in the mountains, few heavy goods vehicles use the route, which is popular with tourists and bikers. In winter, the highest parts of the road can occasionally be closed when ice or snow make driving conditions dangerous. Route =Northern section= From its northern end, branching from the A487, southwest of Eglwyswrw, the road drops down to cross the River Nevern by a single-lane stone bridge (Pont Gynon) just north of the hamlet of Crosswell, where a former inn, now Crosswell House, still stands. The road enters the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, crossing another narrow bridge, Pont Saeson, then climbs steadily through farmland, passing a Grade II-listed 19th century circular stone structure for impounding livestock that had strayed from the mountains. Crossing a 400-year-old bridge (mentioned as Pont llin birian in c.1600) crossing Afon Brynberian, the road passes close by the hamlet of Brynberian. =Mountain section= From Brynberian, the gradient increases until the road reaches at Tafarn-y-Bwlch (approximate English: Tavern at the Pass), an inn which existed at least as early as 1729, and still sustaining travellers as late as 1895. On an 1888 map, the inn was called Salutation Inn. The road crosses a cattle grid marking a boundary between enclosed agricultural land and unenclosed moorland and continues to climb to between Cerrig Lladron and Mynydd-du Commin. Landsker Line, 1901 After the summit, Bwlch-Gwynt (translation: windy gap), the road drops steeply to another cattle grid and the intersection with the B4313 at Greenway, also known as New Inn, which, according to Richard Fenton in the 19th century, sustained northbound travellers before \\"the arduous task of winding up the painful ascent of Bwlch Gwynt\\". In this locale the route crosses the imaginary Landsker Line marking the change from the largely Welsh place names of north Pembrokeshire to the largely English place names in the south of the county.Awbery, Gwenllian M, The Term 'Landsker' in Pembrokeshire in Journal of the Pembrokeshire Historical Society, 4, 1990-91, pp 32-41. =Southern section= After the Greenway crossroads, the road slopes more gently downwards past Rosebush reservoir and Henry's Moat, leaving the National Park just before passing through the hamlet of Tufton, where the Tufton Arms, now a pub, stands. In the 19th century, this was the only inn in the parish, but a much older hostelry (possibly dating back to the 13th century), known as Poll-tax Inn or Paltockes Inne still stands, now a private house bypassed by road-straightening (the old road forded a stream, shown on modern maps as Portrux Ford). The road passes close by Llys y Fran Country Park, through the village of WoodstockOrdnance Survey Landranger Map 145: Cardigan & Mynydd Preseli, 2007 and past Scolton Manor, bridges the Carmarthen to Fishguard railway line, then passes through the hamlets of Bethlehem and Poyston Cross and Crundale in Rudbaxton parish. The inn in Crundale was the Boot and Shoe Inn. The section between Greenway and Woodstock is on the 345 bus route. South of Crundale, the road crosses the bridge at Stephen's Ford, then crosses the A40 Haverfordwest bypass on a roundabout at Withybush, and ends at another roundabout at Prendergast in the centre of Haverfordwest, connecting with the A40 spur (Cartlet Road) and the A487.Ordnance Survey Explorer Map OL36: South Pembrokeshire, 2009 See also Preseli Hills * Pembrokeshire Coast National Park References External links Transport in Pembrokeshire Roads in Pembrokeshire ","title":"B4329 road"},{"id":"42920739","text":"A vegetable and fruit market, 1652 Sybrand van Beest (c.1610 - 1674), was a Dutch Golden Age painter.

It represented production workers in the printing industry, including compositing, typesetting, letterpress printing, lithographic plate-making, electrotyping, stereotyping and bookbinding, and the manufacture of paper and cardboard products, such as paper bags, envelopes, cardboard boxes and cartons. Approximately half of all members were qualified tradespeople, with the remainder semi-skilled or unskilled workers. As in many other printing trade unions, the union members in each workplace were known as the 'Chapel', and the senior union delegate as the 'Father of the Chapel', while other elected officials were referred to as 'brothers'. History Members of the Victorian Printers Operative Union, circa 1900 The PKIU was formed on 6 July 1966 through the amalgamation of the Printing Industries Employees Union of Australia (PIEU) and the Australian Printing Trades Employees' Union (APTEU). At its formation the PKIU represented 50,000 members, out of a total of 53,000 unionists in the Australian printing industry, making it the sixth largest union in Australia and the eighth largest printing union in the English-speaking world. Membership of the union increased to a peak of 60,000 in 1970. After this, membership entered a gradual decline as technological change in the printing industry reduced the number of jobs, with membership falling back to 50,000 by the end of the decade. In 1976 the union held an eight-and-a-half-week strike against John Fairfax and Sons over the introduction of computerised typesetting equipment. By the 1970s the union had established 100 percent membership in the newspaper section of the industry, and approximately 75 percent membership in the paper products sections. In 1986 the PKIU absorbed the Federated Photo Engravers, Photo-Lithographers and Photogravure Employees' Association of Australia, which had been active since 1910 as a small union of skilled workers in South Australian and Victorian newspaper offices. First registered federally in 1942 as the Federated Process Engravers, Photo-Lithographers and Photogravure Employees' Association of Australia, it changed its name to the Federated Photo Engravers, Photo-Lithographers and Photogravure Employees' Association of Australia in 1952. In 1992 the PKIU also absorbed the Victorian Printers Operatives' Union (VPOU). The VPOU had been registered in 1987, but existed well before this date as the Printing Trades General Workers' Union. By 1992 membership had declined to 43,000 and three years later the PKIU amalgamated with the Automotive, Food, Metals and Engineering Union to become the printing division of the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union.

The port meets the port condition because the current I entering one terminal of the port is equal to the current exiting the other. In electrical circuit theory, a port is a pair of terminals connecting an electrical network or circuit to an external circuit, as a point of entry or exit for electrical energy. A port consists of two nodes (terminals) connected to an outside circuit which meets the port condition - the currents flowing into the two nodes must be equal and opposite. The use of ports helps to reduce the complexity of circuit analysis. Many common electronic devices and circuit blocks, such as transistors, transformers, electronic filters, and amplifiers, are analyzed in terms of ports. In multiport network analysis, the circuit is regarded as a \\"black box\\" connected to the outside world through its ports. The ports are points where input signals are applied or output signals taken. Its behavior is completely specified by a matrix of parameters relating the voltage and current at its ports, so the internal makeup or design of the circuit need not be considered, or even known, in determining the circuit's response to applied signals. The concept of ports can be extended to waveguides, but the definition in terms of current is not appropriate and the possible existence of multiple waveguide modes must be accounted for. Port condition Simple resistive network with three possible port arrangements: (a) Pole pairs and are ports; (b) pole pairs and are ports; (c) no pair of poles are ports Any node of a circuit that is available for connection to an external circuit is called a pole (or terminal if it is a physical object). The port condition is that a pair of poles of a circuit is considered a port if and only if the current flowing into one pole from outside the circuit is equal to the current flowing out of the other pole into the external circuit. Equivalently, the algebraic sum of the currents flowing into the two poles from the external circuit must be zero.Yang & Lee, p. 401 It cannot be determined if a pair of nodes meets the port condition by analysing the internal properties of the circuit itself. The port condition is dependent entirely on the external connections of the circuit. What are ports under one set of external circumstances may well not be ports under another. Consider the circuit of four resistors in the figure for example. If generators are connected to the pole pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) then those two pairs are ports and the circuit is a box attenuator. On the other hand, if generators are connected to pole pairs (1, 4) and (2, 3) then those pairs are ports, the pairs (1, 2) and (3, 4) are no longer ports, and the circuit is a bridge circuit. It is even possible to arrange the inputs so that no pair of poles meets the port condition. However, it is possible to deal with such a circuit by splitting one or more poles into a number of separate poles joined to the same node. If only one external generator terminal is connected to each pole (whether a split pole or otherwise) then the circuit can again be analysed in terms of ports. The most common arrangement of this type is to designate one pole of an n-pole circuit as the common and split it into n‚àí1 poles. This latter form is especially useful for unbalanced circuit topologies and the resulting circuit has n‚àí1 ports. In the most general case, it is possible to have a generator connected to every pair of poles, that is, nC2 generators, then every pole must be split into n‚àí1 poles. For instance, in the figure example (c), if the poles 2 and 4 are each split into two poles each then the circuit can be described as a 3-port. However, it is also possible to connect generators to pole pairs , , and making generators in all and the circuit has to be treated as a 6-port. One-ports Any two-pole circuit is guaranteed to meet the port condition by virtue of Kirchhoff's current law and they are therefore one-ports unconditionally. All of the basic electrical elements (inductance, resistance, capacitance, voltage source, current source) are one-ports, as is a general impedance. Study of one-ports is an important part of the foundation of network synthesis, most especially in filter design. Two-element one-ports (that is RC, RL and LC circuits) are easier to synthesise than the general case. For a two-element one-port Foster's canonical form or Cauer's canonical form can be used. In particular, LC circuits are studied since these are lossless and are commonly used in filter design.Carlin & Civalleri, pp. 213-216 Two-ports Linear two port networks have been widely studied and a large number of ways of representing them have been developed. One of these representations is the z-parameters which can be described in matrix form by; : \\\\begin{bmatrix} V_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ V_2 \\\\end{bmatrix} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} z_{11} & z_{12} \\\\\\\\\\\\ z_{21} & z_{22} \\\\end{bmatrix} \\\\begin{bmatrix} I_1 \\\\\\\\\\\\ I_2 \\\\end{bmatrix} where Vn and In are the voltages and currents respectively at port n. Most of the other descriptions of two- ports can likewise be described with a similar matrix but with a different arrangement of the voltage and current column vectors. Common circuit blocks which are two-ports include amplifiers, attenuators and filters. Multiports Coaxial circulators. Circulators have at least three ports In general, a circuit can consist of any number of ports‚Äîa multiport. Some, but not all, of the two-port parameter representations can be extended to arbitrary multiports. Of the voltage and current based matrices, the ones that can be extended are z-parameters and y-parameters. Neither of these are suitable for use at microwave frequencies because voltages and currents are not convenient to measure in formats using conductors and are not relevant at all in waveguide formats. Instead, s-parameters are used at these frequencies and these too can be extended to an arbitrary number of ports.Russer, Chapter 10, \\"Microwave circuits: Linear multiports\\" Circuit blocks which have more than two ports include directional couplers, power splitters, circulators, diplexers, duplexers, multiplexers, hybrids and directional filters. RF and microwave RF and microwave circuit topologies are commonly unbalanced circuit topologies such as coaxial or microstrip. In these formats, one pole of each port in a circuit is connected to a common node such as a ground plane. It is assumed in the circuit analysis that all these commoned poles are at the same potential and that current is sourced to or sunk into the ground plane that is equal and opposite to that going into the other pole of any port. In this topology a port is treated as being just a single pole. The corresponding balancing pole is imagined to be incorporated into the ground plane.Gustrau, p. 162 The one-pole representation of a port will start to fail if there are significant ground plane loop currents. The assumption in the model is that the ground plane is perfectly conducting and that there is no potential difference between two locations on the ground plane. In reality, the ground plane is not perfectly conducting and loop currents in it will cause potential differences. If there is a potential difference between the commoned poles of two ports then the port condition is broken and the model is invalid. Waveguide A Moreno coupler, a type of waveguide directional coupler. Directional couplers have four ports. This one has one port permanently terminated internally with a matched load, so only three ports are visible. The ports are the openings in the centres of the waveguide flanges The idea of ports can be (and is) extended to waveguide devices, but a port can no longer be defined in terms of circuit poles because in waveguides the electromagnetic waves are not guided by electrical conductors. They are, instead guided by the walls of the waveguide. Thus, the concept of a circuit conductor pole does not exist in this format. Ports in waveguides consist of an aperture or break in the waveguide through which the electromagnetic waves can pass. The bounded plane through which the wave passes is the definition of the port. Waveguides have an additional complication in port analysis in that it is possible (and sometimes desirable) for more than one waveguide mode to exist at the same time. In such cases, for each physical port, a separate port must be added to the analysis model for each of the modes present at that physical port.Russer, pp. 237-238  Other energy domains  The concept of ports can be extended into other energy domains. The generalised definition of a port is a place where energy can flow from one element or subsystem to another element or subsystem.Karnopp et al., p. 14 This generalised view of the port concept helps to explain why the port condition is so defined in electrical analysis. If the algebraic sum of the currents is not zero, such as in example diagram (c), then the energy delivered from an external generator is not equal to the energy entering the pair of circuit poles. The energy transfer at that place is thus more complex than a simple flow from one subsystem to another and does not meet the generalised definition of a port. The port concept is particularly useful where multiple energy domains are involved in the same system and a unified, coherent analysis is required such as with mechanical-electrical analogies or bond graph analysis.Borutzsky, p. 20 Connection between energy domains is by means of transducers. A transducer may be a one-port as viewed by the electrical domain, but with the more generalised definition of port it is a two-port. For instance, a mechanical actuator has one port in the electrical domain and one port in the mechanical domain. Transducers can be analysed as two-port networks in the same way as electrical two-ports. That is, by means of a pair of linear algebraic equations or a 2√ó2 transfer function matrix. However, the variables at the two ports will be different and the two-port parameters will be a mixture of two energy domains. For instance, in the actuator example, the z-parameters will include one electrical impedance, one mechanical impedance, and two transimpedances that are ratios of one electrical and one mechanical variable.Beranek & Mellow, pp. 96-100 References BibliographyWon Y.

It represented white collar and technical-grade employees in both the private sector and the public service. In private industry its members were concentrated primarily in the vehicle, metal and aircraft industries. History =Foundation= The union was founded in Brisbane in August 1915 with a membership of 108. The union initially represented white collar employees in the Queensland Railways workshops, but soon expanded to cover engineers employed in the Queensland Public Service and local government engineering offices, as well as architects in the Public Works Department and Department of Public Lands. After unsuccessfully seeking federal registration, the union was registered with the Industrial Court of Queensland on 11 April 1917 as the Australian Union of Architects, Engineers and Surveyors, Union of Employees, Queensland. During this period the union's membership was concentrated mainly in Brisbane and Ipswich. The union grew slowly over the following decades, reaching 243 members by 1933 and 528 by 1939. =Growth= The union grew rapidly during WWII, due to the increased demand for employees with technical expertise, many of them promoted from trades positions, and by 1941 the union's membership had reached 1,793. In 1943 the union extended its industrial remit to provide for coverage of draughtsmen. In 1944, with branches in Victoria and New South Wales, the union achieved federal registration as the Association of Architects, Engineers, Surveyors and Draughtsmen of Australia (AAESDA). The first annual meeting of the new Federal Council of the AAESDA was held in December 1945 and it was decided to move the union's head office from Queensland to Melbourne, where it would remain for the rest of the union's history ‚Äì mainly due to the fact that the Victorian state branch had the largest membership in the union. In the same year the AAESDA merged with the Commonwealth Temporary Technical Officers' Association, formed two years earlier by government technicians in war-time service, based in Sydney. In September 1947 the AAESDA merged with the Australian Association of Draughtsmen (AAD), after almost three years of negotiations. The AAD had been formed in Sydney in June 1942 by draughtsmen at several major engineering firms, including Cockatoo Dockyard, Babcock & Wilcox and Clyde Engineering, who were frustrated at the low wages in draughting, resulting from its status as a reserved occupation. Like the AAESDA, the AAD had benefited from war-time industrial activity through a growing membership, quickly expanding to other states and achieving federal registration in October 1943. The AAD had initially opposed the federal registration of the AAESDA, on the grounds that the two organisations would compete for coverage of the same employees. The AAESDA continued to grow in the post-war years, as a result of rapid economic expansion and industrialisation. Between 1959 and 1964 it averaged over 13% annual growth in membership, and by 1965 had reached 12,738 members, of whom 7322 were employed in the private sector. Membership peaked ten years later, with a total of 24,296 members. =Affiliation and Change= During the early 1950s a plebiscite of the association's members was held to decide whether to affiliate to the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), but the proposal was strongly rejected by the membership. The AAESDA later played a key role in the 1956 establishment of the Australian Council of Salaried and Professional Associations (ACSPA), the peak body for unions and professional associations representing white-collar or salaried employees. The AAESDA's federal president, Paul Allsop, became the first president of ACSPA. Despite being a founding member, the AAESDA was regarded as unusual within ACSPA due to its industrial militancy, relative to the other affiliates, including being prepared to use strike action as a bargaining tool with management. The union remained affiliated with ACSPA until 1977, when, having become disillusioned with the slow progress of negotiations to merge ACSPA with the ACTU, it transferred its affiliation to the ACTU. This move was met with opposition from some sections of the union's membership, unhappy with the AAESDA being affiliated with a body traditionally associated with blue-collar workers. Shortly after, ACSPA merged into the ACTU in 1979. In 1970 the AAESDA affiliated to the Council of Commonwealth Public Service Organisations (CCPSO), the representative body for unions representing workers employed by the Commonwealth Government, later renamed the Council of Australian Government Employee Organisations (CAGEO) in 1974. Earlier attempts to affiliate with the CCPSO had been rejected, due to the AAESDA's sizeable private sector membership. The union would remain affiliated until 1981, when CAGEO merged into the ACTU. During the 1950s and 60s the AAESDA was heavily involved in the design and development of technical education courses to train and qualify employees in the expanding technical fields, which fell outside the traditional apprenticeship or university systems. Unlike many of the traditional craft unions, the AAESDA did not attempt to restrict or regulate entry into the occupations it covered, but rather encouraged its members to gain recognised qualifications to help formalise the position of technical workers in the structure of the award system. In 1978 the AAESDA applied to the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to include coverage of foremen and supervisors in the Metal Industry Award. This application was opposed by employers, who argued that it would create \\"divided loyalties\\" among staff employees, and undermine their \\"management ethic\\". The application was granted by the Commission, with the proviso that supervisors should be represented by a different organisation to the workers they supervised. In the 1970s the AAESDA, like many other Australian unions, became more industrially militant, including being more prepared to undertake strikes and other industrial action. The union's membership was also undergoing a change as fields such as architecture and engineering became increasingly professionalised, requiring university-level qualifications, and many employees in these occupations chose to be represented by occupation-specific professional associations such as the newly formed Australian Professional Engineers Association (APEA). By 1979 technicians accounted for 48 per cent of the AAESDA's membership; draughtsmen, 31 per cent; and supervisors, 18 per cent ‚Äì architects, engineers and surveyors collectively made up less than 3 per cent of the union. To better reflect this new membership profile the union changed its name in 1981 to the Association of Draughting Supervisory and Technical Employees (ADSTE). =Amalgamation= In the late 1970s and 80s technological change (such as the introduction of Computer-aided design in draughting), outsourcing in the public service and the decline of the Australian manufacturing industry began to put pressure on the AAESDA and between 1975 and 1980 it lost over 17 percent of its membership nationally, falling to 20,049. To offset these losses the union sought to amalgamate with other unions. In 1971 it had taken over members from the deregistered Federation of Scientific and Technical Workers, and in 1986 it amalgamated with the Australian Public Service Artisans' Association, which represented approximately 2200 permanent trades employees of the Federal Government. Unsuccessful attempts were also made to amalgamate with the CSIRO Technical Association and the Supervisory Technicians' Association. In 1970 the AAESDA began talks with the Amalgamated Engineering Union (AEU), which had a broad membership among blue-collar workers in manufacturing, however there was a strong backlash from the membership, who resisted the loss of their union's distinct identity. Driven by the union's financial difficulties, these talks were restarted in 1984 with the successor to the AEU, the Amalgamated Metal Workers' Union (AMWU). The two unions shared a number of industrial awards in common and approximately 90 percent of ADSTE members were employed in workplaces that also had AMWU members. The amalgamation proposal was initially opposed by ADSTE's West Australian, Tasmanian and Australian Capital Territory (ACT) branches. While the West Australian and Tasmanian branches were eventually persuaded to change their position, the ACT branch led a campaign to oppose the merger. The amalgamation was finally completed on 1 April 1991, after a referendum in which 60% of participating ADSTE members voted to support the amalgamation proposal. The merged organisation was named the Metals and Engineering Workers' Union (MEWU) and had a total of 167,500 members. The membership previously represented by ADSTE became the 'Technical and Supervisory Division' of the MEWU. Immediately following the merger the Division lost a significant proportion of its members, with approximately 40 percent of former ADSTE members choosing not to continue membership in the amalgamated body. Organisation =Membership= Unlike many other white collar unions in Australia ADSTE did not include managerial-level or administrative employees and many of its members were former tradespeople (60% in 1991) who had been promoted to more highly skilled positions. Typical occupations included draughtsmen, engineering technicians, technical officers, production planners, laboratory technicians, supervisors and foremen. Due to the makeup of the occupations it covered the union was almost exclusively male ‚Äì for example, female members made up only 1.6 percent of the South Australian state branch in 1981. The union's membership was widely dispersed throughout a variety of industries and occupations, and it was rare to have more than five members employed in a single workplace ‚Äì often making union organisation a challenging task. =Structure= The union was organised into eight state and territory branches, which each paid 32 percent of their income to the federal office. Each state branch was governed by a branch council, consisting of workplace and sub-branch delegates, a president, two vice-presidents, treasurer, secretary and delegates to the union's federal conference. All state branch officials were elected annually by the union's rank-and-file membership, except for the state secretary, who served for four years. The union held an annual Federal Conference, made up of elected delegates from each state branch, and a Federal Secretary and Assistant Federal Secretary (elected every four years by the national membership of the union), which decided policy and direction for the union nationally. The union was politically-unaligned, and the membership actively resisted the attempts of some officials to encourage affiliation with the Australian Labor Party (a common practice among Australian unions) during the early 1970s. This was again the case when in 1984 the ADSTE Federal Conference rejected a motion, supported by the union's officials, to allow the union to financially or publicly support political parties. The union published a monthly journal known as the AAESDA Bulletin (first appearing in June 1948) and later simply as Blueprint.

History The CCMA was founded in 1992 by Gene Higgins and a business partner. The purpose of the company was to bring exposure to the genre that would become known as Christian country music. Christian country was a form of music that was similar to country but it had positive lyrics and an inspirational and sometimes spiritual content. The organization hosts an annual awards show known as the ICM Awards. The ICM Awards bestows awards upon individuals who perform or promote Christian county music. Higgins announced that on October 4, 2013 he officially retired as the president of the ICM organization. It was further announced that he would remain with the company and participate with running the Power Source Magazine. Magazine The ICM has a monthly publication known as \\"Powersource Magazine\\" which is a company in itself. The magazine showcases Christian county music artists as well as a playlist music chart. In addition to industry news and the charts, artists may purchase advertisements or be featured as a lead story or an article of interest. These editions are then distributed to industry minded individuals. ICM awards The ICM holds an annual awards show to honor artists who participate or promote the genre of Christian country music throughout their careers. Though the awards show does not have a set date for its yearly event, it is usually set between October and November of each year. Lawsuit In 2002, the Christian Country Music Association was sued by the Country Music Association for infringement. The CMA contended the CCMA was an infringement upon its brand and that it was in direct competition with the annual Country Music Awards. Ed Benson, the director of the CMA commented that the CCMA was using and benefiting unfairly from the use of the acronym CCMA and it caused confusion for fans and artists alike. The courts finally ruled that the CCMA could use the name \\"Christian Country Music Association\\" but would not be permitted to use the acronym CCMA. After the ruling it was decided to rename the CCMA to the Ispirational Country Music Association or the acronym, ICM. In July 2003 the company was reincorporated under its new name. In 2003 the CCMA was once again in violation of the court order banning them from using the CCMA acronym by changing it to CCA. The CMA filed for and was awarded an injunction which prohibited them from using CCA and any of their propaganda.

It was built by the Parliamentarian admiral, Sir Robert Blake, after he invaded Tresco in April 1651 during the years of the interregnum. It was used to bombard the neighbouring island of St Mary's, which was still held by an opposing Royalist army, and forced its surrender several weeks later. The battery comprised a triangle of ramparts, constructed using earth and rubble, which, combined with the natural stone features on the site, produced a substantial, if crude, fortification. It is now ruined, and owned by the Duchy of Cornwall. History =17th century= Oliver's Battery was built in the interregnum following the English Civil War. The Isles of Scilly had supported Charles I during the conflict between 1642 and 1646, and, after a short period in Parliamentary control, the islands rebelled in favour of Charles in 1648.; The islands became a base for Royalist privateers, and Parliament became concerned that the Dutch, then hostile to England, might counter the piracy by occupying the islands, gaining a foothold that they could then use against England. In 1651 Parliament sent Sir Robert Blake in charge of a naval task force to retake the islands. The waters controlled by Oliver's Battery; looking from the northern edge of St Mary's towards St Martin's (right) and Tresco and the battery (left) Blake arrived in April 1651 and set about invading the island of Tresco.; Taking the harbour of Old Grimsby in an amphibious assault on 18 April, he then bypassed the northern fortress of King Charles's Castle and marched south, intending to use Tresco as a base for taking the neighbouring island of St Mary's, approximately away.; ; ; When Blake reached Carn Near on the south end of Tresco, he constructed an artillery position for a battery of three guns overlooking the channel between the island and St Mary's, as well as the harbour of St Mary's Pool, hoping to pressure the Royalists into surrender. The work was carried out rapidly between 19 April and 4 May, possibly reusing the site of a Bronze Age burial cairn. When the battery began firing on 4 May, one of the guns exploded causing two deaths, but the bombardment soon recommenced and St Mary's agreed to surrender several weeks later on 23 May. =18th ‚Äì 21st centuries= The antiquarian William Borlase visited the site in 1752, which he thought was a breastwork defence named after the Parliamentary leader Oliver Cromwell. He remarked on how its construction was \\"irregular and uneven\\", and suspected that it was very old, pre-dating the civil war. He also noted how its position would have allowed it to protect the location he believed the Parliamentary forces had used as their camp, and commented as to how the winds and tides would have forced Royalist ships entering or leaving St Mary's harbour to sail into close range of its guns. The blockhouse is owned by the Duchy of Cornwall and it is protected as a scheduled monument under UK law.; The site was surveyed in 1990 by the Cornwall Archaeology Unit, and in 2009 by English Heritage. Design Plan of the battery; A ‚Äì entrance; B ‚Äì small building; C ‚Äì gun platform Oliver's Battery is on a hill overlooking the island of St Mary's to the south-east.; It is triangular in shape, the sides of which are roughly 25 metres by 30 metres by 30 metres (82 ft by 98 ft by 98 ft) in length. The battery was entered from its north-western side, and in the north-east corner there was a small building, approximately 6 metres by 3.5 metres (20 ft by 11 ft), which may have been a store or a temporary gun magazine. The artillery pieces were located in the south-eastern corner of the battery, where a gun platform, in diameter, occupied the highest part of the fortification. The battery is surrounded by an earth and rubble bank, incorporating natural outcrops of stone, between 4.5 metres and 8 metres (15 ft and 26 ft) wide, and 2 metres (6 ft 7 in) high externally. On the west and south sides the ramparts are protected by a ditch, typically m wide and deep. The historian Mark Bowden considers the fortification to be \\"substantial but relatively crude\\", probably a result of the speed with which the building work was carried out. At the bottom of the hill beside the battery are two rectangular earthworks, 16 metres by 8 metres (52 ft and 26 ft), and 26 metres and 12 metres (85 ft and 39 ft). Traditionally these have been thought to be Royalist gun batteries pre-dating the construction of Oliver's Battery, but recent scholarship casts doubt on this, suggesting that they are instead the remains of hollow ways and sand pits.; Notes References Bibliography   * 17th-century forts in England Ruins in the Isles of Scilly Artillery batteries 1651 establishments in England ","title":"Oliver's Battery, Tresco"},{"id":"42922109","text":"The HEMPAS-CCIAS radar is a passive radar developed by five Greek scientists.

Simply put this was a network of \\"passive\\" radars. Later in 2006 the Ministry of Defense, Chief of General Staff and Chief of Army Staff took part in the project. The Aristotle University of Thessaloniki team makes the first presentation of the system to 60 Staff Officers. Immediately after the presentation without any doubt and hesitation, the political and military leadership excited calls for scientists to move quickly. More presentations are following to all sectors. On February 13, 2009 the Council of Defence Planning meet and with 7-0 vote in favor of the operational necessity of the system recommends the urgent consideration of the issue by the Council of Chiefs. The then Chief of Defence General Dimitrios Grapsas, who was a great proponent of the development of the Greek system. Until his retirement in August 2009, the Chief failed to put this issue on the agenda. The scientific team from the University of Thessaloniki, was not put off by the retirement of General Grapsas and continued its investigations. The last technical problems are resolved. Everything looks ready to build the prototype system. Almost a year later, the new Chief of General Staff General Ioannis Yiagkos, informs the scientists that the matter will be reconsidered. On April 4, 2010, with the new Defence Minister E. Venizelos, the Council of Chiefs meets and with a 4-0 vote adopts the proposed system as extremely necessary and urgent. On May 29, 2010, the then vice Defence Minister Panagiotis Beglitis receives the complete feasibility study. The folder containing the top secret program contains 1050 pages. To date an average person could have read it two and three times. The time elapsed is considerable. However, the team of five scientists has received no answer. In June 2010 they sent letters to the Prime Minister and to the leader of the Opposition, to be aware of the situation. Meanwhile, three foreign countries are interested to finance the program. The scientists do not want to sell it. The status of the project is unknown.

It is long and is entirely in Mifflin Township. The stream's watershed has an area of 8.24 square miles. The first settlers in the area arrived in the late 1700s and a number of mills have been built on the stream. It is designated as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and as Class A Wild Trout Waters. Course Tenmile Run in its lower reaches looking downstream Tenmile Run begins in southern Mifflin Township, just north of Nescopeck Mountain. The stream flows west-southwest for several miles in a fairly shallow and narrow valley. It then turns north and enters a much broader valley. Over the next few miles, the stream moves from the eastern edge of the valley to the western edge of the valley, where it crosses Pennsylvania Route 339 and turns west, skirting a hill. After a short distance, it turns north and shortly afterwards enters the Susquehanna River. Tenmile Run joins the Susquehanna River upstream of its mouth. Watershed, geography, and hydrology The watershed of Tenmile Run has an area of 8.24 square miles. The elevation of Tenmile Run at its mouth is above sea level. The census-designated place of Mifflinville is located near Tenmile Run. The stream is in the United States Geological Survey topographic quadrangles of Mifflinville and Shumans. There is a small and asymmetrical divide separating the valley of Tenmile Run from another valley that runs westward along the foot of Nescopeck Mountain. It resembles a kame fan or a head-of-outwash and contains a layer of sand and gravel that is thick. Along with the watershed of Catawissa Creek and the watershed of Roaring Creek, the watershed of Tenmile Run is one of the three main watersheds draining Columbia County south of the Susquehanna River. 50 percent of the length of Tenmile Run is private land that is closed for fishing and 45 percent is private land that is open for fishing. 5 percent of the stream's length is public land that is open for fishing. The concentration of alkalinity in Tenmile Run is 8 milligrams per liter. History Tenmile Run's name derives from the fact that it was historically situated at the ten mile marker on a hill road running to Catawissa. Nicholas Angle, one of the first settlers of Mifflin Township, settled on Tenmile Run. In the late 1700s, John Brown, David Brown, the Creasy family, and the Kirkendall family inhabited a ridge overlooking the stream. In 1793, John Brown moved to a 400-acre tract in the stream's valley. The first mill in Mifflin Township was built on a tributary of Tenmile Run by Jacob Swepenheiser. In 1869, George Nungesser constructed a buckwheat mill on the stream and operated it until 1881, when his son William J. Nungesser took over the operation of it. Another buckwheat mill was located a mile northwards on the stream. Historically, some logging has been done in the watershed of Tenmile Run. Biology The Columbia County Natural Heritage Inventory designated Tenmile Run as a \\"locally significant site\\" in 2004. Brown trout inhabit Tenmile Run. The stream is designated as a high-quality coldwater fishery by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. The stream is also designated as Class A Wild Trout Waters for a stretch from its headwaters downstream as far as the road T409. Tenmile Run flows through a palustrine forest consisting of hardwood trees and hemlock. The stream's watershed is also home to shrub swamps. Mostly, forests are found in the stream's upper reaches, with swamps and marshes in the lower reaches. The forests in the watershed consist of chestnut oak, red maple, red oak, and white ash. The forest's understory consists of Japanese barberry, low-bush blueberry, witch hazel, may-apple, white baneberry, Virginia creeper, viburnum, striped maple, partridgeberry, dogwood, and spotted wintergreen. There is a fairly high level of bird biodiversity in the watershed of Tenmile Run. Birds living in the stream's watershed include worm-eating warblers, wood thrushes, ovenbirds, Eastern tufted titmouses, Eastern towhees, veeries, pileated woodpeckers, nuthatches, common yellowthroats, and American redstarts. Other bird species found in the watershed include scarlet tanagers, black-capped chickadees, and black-throated green warblers. Numerous species inhabit the forested swamp in the Tenmile Run watershed. These include skunk cabbage, ferns, prickly sedge, sphagnum moss, and others. The watershed's marshland is home to poison sumac, winterberry holly, multiflora rose, and other plants.

Early years Born in Girona in 1892, she was the daughter of the modernist writer, Prudenci Bertrana. After finishing school in Girona, she wanted to be a writer, but her father opposed the decision and sent her to study the cello under Tom√°s Sobrequ√©s, Girona's best cello teacher, then in Barcelona where she made a living playing the cello with a women's trio in the city's night clubs. She continued her music studies in Geneva in 1923 where she earned a living playing in the Jazz Women ensemble at the Hotel Chamonix, the first jazz band made up entirely of women. Bertrana began a friendship with the exile Llu√≠s Nicolau d'Olwer, who later encouraged her to write. During a performance, she met Denys Choffat, an electrical engineer, whom she married in 1925. Career In 1926, after reading Le Mariage de Loti by Pierre Loti, she decided to live in Tahiti. As a result of that experience, she wrote her first book Paradisos Oceanics. As a woman who wrote about mythical Polynesian women, she made a strong impression. Returning to Catalonia in 1930, Bertrana continued to write novels, lecturing and collaborating on various publications. Although her father had opposed Bertrana's writing career, they later collaborated by writing a novel together, dividing the chapters between them. L'illa perduda (The Lost Island) combined the elements of adventure and romance characteristic of the literature of the South Seas. In 1933, she stood as a candidate for Republican Left of Catalonia, but was defeated and left politics. In 1935, she moved alone to Morocco to study Muslim women, visiting harems, brothels and prisons, after which she wrote Sensual Marroc i Fanatic. When the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936, she returned to Barcelona where she served as the editor of \\"Companya\\", the women's magazine of the Catalan party. Choffat went to the Francoist zone and since then, they were separated. In 1938, alone, she became an exile. In Switzerland, she was a contributor to publications in Geneva and Lausanne. She wrote in French and Catalan, and translated into Castilian Spanish. Her experiences of World War II were captured in a collection of works, Camins de somni (Dream Roads), Tres presoners (Three Prisoners) and Entre dos silencis (Between Two Silences). For a time, she lived in Prada while visiting her mother in Andorra. Here, she had a relationship with Pablo Casals and Pompeu Fabra. Her novel Vent de grop (1967) was one of the first to be centred on the phenomenon of tourism. In the 1970s, the book became a film starring Joan Manuel Serrat titled La larga agon√≠a de los peces fuera del agua. Bertrana's recently republished memoires combining Mem√≤ries fins al 1935 (1973) and Mem√≤ries del 1935 al retorn a Catalunya (1975) provides a detailed account of her life.

He was mortally wounded at the siege of Bayonne on 14 April 1814. Early career Andrew Hay enlisted as an ensign in the 1st regiment of foot, on 6 December 1779. He served in the American Revolutionary War and was promoted to lieutenant on 21 July 1781.Heathcote (p.61) He transferred to the 88th Foot as captain on 24 January 1783 but when the regiment was disbanded after the war, Hay returned to the 1st Foot, maintaining the rank of captain, and inheriting seniority on 17 April 1784. From 1787 to December 1795, a period which included the beginning of the French Revolutionary War, Hay was on half-pay, listed as a captain. He was promoted to major on 1 September 1794 but remained without a regiment until the 93rd Foot was raised, which he joined on 9 December 1795 and served with in the West Indies, until it was disbanded in 1797. Service in the British Isles Hay became a colonel in the Banffshire Fencibles on 29 December 1798, a regiment mainly drawn from Hay's family estate in Banffshire, Scotland. Fencibles were British Army units raised for defence against the threat of invasion during times of war. They were usually temporary units, composed of local volunteers but commanded by regular army officers, and their role was usually, but not always, confined to home defence and patrol duties. While his regiment was serving in the Channel Islands, in 1801, Hay sold his home in Banffshire and moved to Fordingbridge in Hampshire. The Banffshire Fencibles were broken up in 1802 when a short- lived peace was brought about by the Treaty of Amiens. When war with France broke out again, in May 1803, Hay was given command of the 16th Battalion of the Army of Reserve. Hay's unit transferred to the regular army on 1 December 1804 as 2nd Battalion in the Highland regiment, the 72nd Foot, when he was promoted to lieutenant-colonel. Just over 4 years later, on 19 March 1807, Hay was given command of the 3rd Battalion, 1st Foot regiment serving in Ireland, but once the British Government had made the decision to support the Spanish and Portuguese rebels against the French, Hay and his regiment were shipped out to the Peninsula. Peninsular War Hay's battalion arrived in Corunna on 14 October 1808 and served under Sir David Baird. Sent in support of Sir John Moore's troops, Hay was subsequently in action during the retreat to Corunna and the battle that followed.Heathcote (pp.61-62) The surviving troops were evacuated to Britain, from where Hay was sent to the Netherlands, where he took part in the unsuccessful Walcheren Campaign.Heathcote (p.62) In July 1810, Hay was sent back to the Peninsula with the 3rd battalion, 1st Foot of which he again obtained command on 4 August. Hay fought at the Battle of Bussaco on 27 September, where Wellington's army drove off a superior French force under Marshal Andr√© Mass√©na. Promoted to major-general on 4 June 1811, Hay went on to fight in the important victories at the Salamanca on 22 July 1812 and Vitoria on 21 June 1813, in which his son, Captain George Hay received a mortal wound. Hay served at the Siege of San Sebasti√°n, where Leith and Oswald, the senior officers of the 5th Division were wounded, thus giving Hay command once more. Hay therefore, on 7 October 1813, led the 5th Division at the Battle of the Bidasoa when Wellington's army overran the French lines and gained a foothold in France. Hay's troops were the first to cross the river, wading across at first light and surprising the French who did not realise the water was only chest deep at low tide.Heathcote (p.168) The Battle of Nivelle, where Hay led the 5th division in a diversion along the river bank =Battle of the Nivelle= After fleeing from the Bidasoa, the French, under Marshal Soult took up a position along the Nivelle between the mountains near Ainhoa, and St Jean-de-Luz. On 10 November 1813, the 5th Division under Hay and the 1st Division under the Earl of Effingham, made a feint along the shore, allowing Wellington's Light Division to fall on the French centre while his 3rd, 4th and 7th Divisions overran the French redoubts.Heathcote (pp.168‚Äì169) With the loss of the bridge at Amotz, the threat of Soult's army being cut in two forced him to fall back once more, with the loss of 4,400 men.Heathcote (p.169) =Battle of the Nive= Soult's army entrenched itself at Bayonne, between the Nive and the Adour. Wellington, restricted in his position between the two rivers and the Pyrenees, crossed the Nive in order to gain some space.Heathcote (p.169) Three divisions under Sir John Hope, including the 5th under Hay, advanced towards the Adour on 9 December, whilst generals Beresford and Hill, with five divisions and three further divisions of Spanish and Portuguese soldiers, crossed upstream of Bayonne. With Wellington's army divided, Soult concentrated his army and made several attempts to overcome Hope's now outnumbered troops. The counter-attacks occurred over a three-day period starting on 10 December. After the failure of his initial assault, Soult attacked again on both the 12 and 13 December, and on each occasion he succeeded in pushing Hope back. Wellington was thus obliged each time to send reinforcements to drive the French back to Bayonne. On the night of the 12th, the river flooded due to heavy rain, and destroyed the British pontoon bridge at Villefranque, leaving Hill stranded on the north side of the river. Despite being attacked by six of Soult's divisions, Hill's line held until Wellington's 6th Division arrived four hours later, having crossed the river at Ustaritz. Beresford meanwhile had sent three divisions across the river at Villefranque, forcing the French to retreat to Bayonne. When command of the 5th Division passed to Sir Charles Colville, at the end of the year, Hay returned to his brigade. =Battle of Bayonne= The sortie from the besieged city of Bayonne, on 14 April 1814, in which Hay was killed Wellington was unable to lay siege to the city of Bayonne with Soult's army still active in the field and was thus required to divide his forces.Lipscombe (p.66) Wellington was to use the main bulk of his army to draw Soult away, while Hope was left with the 1st and 5th divisions and a few independent brigades with which to complete the investment. Surrounding the city meant that Hope‚Äôs troops had to cross the Adour, and to this end, a pontoon bridge was constructed from locally available boats. After delays caused by adverse weather, Hope's army, which included Hay, completed its crossing on 25 February and had surrounded Bayonne by 27 February. Hope was slow to start and even by 10 April, Hope had not completed his preparations.Glover (p. 335) Humphrey Hopper. Memorial to Andrew Hay in St Paul's Cathedral, London (1814) On 13 April 1814, news of Napoleon's abdication reached Bayonne. Hay, who was duty officer, spread the news amongst the troops; it was thought that the war would soon be at an end and the soldiers would be returning home. Early the next morning the governor of Bayonne, General Pierre Thouvenot, who had also heard the news, made a sortie, which would later be condemned by both sides as a needless waste of lives, and which proved to be the last action of the war. Hay, who was defending the church of St Etienne, died as he encouraged his men to fight to the last. A memorial to Hay was raised at the church where he died by the officers of the 3rd battalion, 1st Foot; a government-funded memorial was later placed in St Paul's Cathedral. Hay's widow also honoured his memory with a monument in the Church of St Mary the Virgin, near the family home in Fordingbrid\\"Memorials of St Paul's Cathedral\\" Sinclair, W. pp. 457/8: London; Chapman & Hall, Ltd; 1909ge.

It was created with the privatization of the ground handling services of airline TAP Air Portugal in October 2005.  History  In 1982 the DOT (Department of Land Operations) was the one who took care of handling in Portugal. Seven years later (in 1989), that entity underwent a process of organizational restructuring and has changed its name to General Directorate of Operations on Land (DGOT). In 1992, an expansion and provision of services to third strategy, TAP Handling emerged. In April 2003, due to the separation of TAP SGPS and TAP SA responsible for the new company arose handling in Portugal called SPdH (Servi√ßos Portugueses de Handling, SA). SPdH This proved to be an undertaking of great importance in relation to civil aviation in Portugal due to the quality of its ground handling services in major national airports. Yet, in 2003, Portugalia Airlines assured 6% of the capital of SPdH. Meanwhile, SPdH began a process of privatization by selling 50.1% of its capital to the Group GLOBALIA, which by itself is the biggest tourist company in Spain. Groundforce was born in October 2005 through the unification of the companies GLOBALIA Handling - Division of airport ground handling services of Globalia Group. The companies were: Iberhandling, Eurohandling, MarHandling Globalia Handling and Mexico. There currently exists Groundforce in Portugal, Mexico, Morocco and Spain. In March 2008, a partnership of three national banks (BIG, Banif and Invest) acquired the position held by GLOBALIA Group, i.e., bought the 50.1% of the capital of Groundforce Portugal. According to the statement of Groundforce, BIG got 19.94% (for 12 million euros), Banif with 15.1% (9 million) and Banco Invest with the other 15.1% (9 million). Therefore, Groundforce Portugal became a 100% national entity. Groundforce Portugal ceased activity at Faro airport in Faro on 10 November 2010, ending the scale at the airport and firing 336 staff employees. Annual losses in the order of ‚Ç¨8 million on this scale were the reasons given by the company management.

History  James Warren York was a former army musician and played professionally in the Grand Rapids, Michigan theaters. He eventually decided to open his own instrument repair business and set up on the ground floor of a Monroe Avenue building in Grand Rapids, Michigan in 1882. The early company originally started from a merger of two partnerships between \\"Smith and York\\" in 1883 and \\"York and Holton\\" in 1885. Together they were eventually reformed into the \\"J.W.York and Company\\". In 1887, Frank York, J.W. York's eldest son joined the business and it was named \\"York & Son\\". In 1898, Charles York, the youngest son joined the company which prompted him to again rename the business \\"York & Sons\\". The business went through various name changes (\\"J.W. York\\", \\"J.W. York and Sons\\", \\"J.W. York Band Instrument Co\\", \\"J.W. York Instrument Co.\\") before finally settling on \\"York Band Instrument Co\\". James Warren York By 1890, York was operating a successful instrument plant on Canal St. by importing instruments and producing a few original cornets and trombones. Newly designed instruments were added each year and in 1898, the company was manufacturing a complete line of cupped mouthpiece brass instruments. Frank Holton, Henry Martin Jr., Henry Martin Sr., and F.A. Reynolds, pioneers of band instrument manufacturing, were all once employed at the early York factories at 3,5, and 7 North Ionia Avenue in Grand Rapids. The factories were later relocated to the old Raniville Power building at the corner of Campau Ave and Lyon St. In 1908, a plant at 1600 South Division Avenue was built and lasted until it was closed in 1971. In 1913, rights were sold to original partners James and John Duffy and a stock company was formed. In 1916 J.W. York retired from the company. The company was officially changed to York Band Instrument Company in 1926 when the York family relinquished all control, although the \\"York Band Instrument Company\\" name was used in promotional publications starting in the early 1920s after J.W. had retired. The company had various subsidiaries and used the proprietary name \\"Grand Rapids Band Instrument Company\\" and \\"USA Line\\" for their mass-produced and lower priced student quality horns. Additionally, York produced various stencil horns under the names of \\"Hallmark\\", \\"Acme\\", \\"Wolverine\\", and \\"Pioneer\\".  The \\"York\\" Sound  The York Band Instrument Co manufactured a full line of woodwind, string, percussion, and brass instruments which included trumpets, cornets, horns, trombones, helicons, baritone horns, sousaphones, and tubas. The brass instruments made before 1940 were known to have superior craftsmanship, ease of enunciation, intonation, and timbre, and were widely sought after by concert, brass, and military bands. The United States Army's Quarter Master Corps and the United States Navy historically used York instruments and still maintain them in their possession. Two legendary York CC tubas were originally commissioned by the Philadelphia Orchestra in the 1930s. The tubas were later sold to Arnold Jacobs and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra at different times and used by subsequent tubists in their orchestra. These tubas have become the arch- prototypes for as many as six modern tuba designs because of their excellent intonation, tone, timbre, and craftsmanship. These tubas are also the basis for the legendary \\"York tuba sound\\" that many tubists try to emulate.  Decline  A vintage 1980's photo of the abandoned York Grand Rapids factory site as well as the site today.After experiencing unparalleled growth through innovation in much of the early 20th century, the York company fell victim to the Great Depression of the 1930s and was purchased by Carl Fischer for $300,000 in December 1940. This purchase relegated York Band Instruments to being a subsidiary of Carl Fischer. During World War II the company switched to the manufacturing of munitions. After the war, York produced student instruments at the Grand Rapids factories. The name York sometimes became a stamp on stencil horns from other manufacturers as Carl Fischer's ownership outsourced work. Higher quality instruments were transferred to the West German company Boehm Meinl as the \\"York Master\\" line. By 1964 the York company was out of business. In 1970, Carl Fischer sold the York brand to the New York-based Tolchin Instruments, Incorporated. Tolchin Instruments closed the original Grand Rapids factory in 1971. After years of mismanagement Tolchin accumulated an unmanageable $24 million debt. The York brand was eventually sold to Boosey & Hawkes in 1976.  See also C.G.

On her father's side, she was related to the engineer and intellectual Narcis Monturiol; on her mother's side, she was related to writer and politician Josep Puig Pujades. She grew up in an intellectual and artistic environment, and received the typical women's education of the liberal bourgeoisie of the time. Since childhood, she felt a special fascination for the theater. She also studied music, and at the age of 20, began a career as a concert pianist. Montoriol was also interested in writing, and wrote her first poems around 1920, some of which were published in magazines. Reading her poetry in public sparked an interest in languages, prompting her to teach the first Catalan courses taught at the Pompeu Fabra Institute of Catalan Studies. In addition to Catalan and Castilian, she learned French, English, German, and Italian. Knowledge of these languages, led her to appreciate the great European thinkers and writers, and many times to translate, for the sheer pleasure of it. In 1928, she published the Catalan translation of the sonnets of Shakespeare, in verse, respecting the original structure. A translation of the works of Pompeu Fabra appeared in 1928 and caused a stir among the Catalan intellectual world because of the difficulty project. Being one of the first women who wrote plays in Catalonia, she quickly became renowned among critics and the public. Having feminist convictions, she participated in cultural revitalization as a lecturer and head of the Lyceum Club of Barcelona. Musical career She studied music with maestro Vidiella and after perfecting the instrument with Frank Marshall, she began her career as a concert pianist over the years, as a soloist and with a trio together with her sister Lina Montoriol -or Jacinta Torner- on the violin, Montserrat Cassad√≥ on the violoncel, and herself on the piano. She performs - alone or with this trio - in various venues in Catalonia, including the Palau de la M√∫sica Catalana with critical aclaim. She also performs with Aurora Bertrana in violoncel and piano sonatas.

His career began with the design of Elton John's piano jacket in 1980, and is best known for his \\"Fear No Art\\" button, album covers, the Miripolsky Barbie, and Absolut Vodka illustrations. He also painted the backdrops for the Tonight Show hosted by Jay Leno.  Early life  Miripolsky was born in Paris, France in 1951. His father was Bert Miripolsky, also an artist and the cultural advisor for the American Foreign Service. He attended the California Institute of the Arts where he honed his style. However, he left the institution after two years and briefly pursued an acting career before dedicating himself to visual art full-time.  Career  After his acting stint, Miripolsky became a full-time artist through the creative work he did for Elton John, most notably the \\"piano jacket\\" which the musician wore at his 1980 Central Park Concert. This ultimately led to working with other musicians including Cheap Trick, Bette Midler, Quincy Jones, Rolling Stones and Tatsuro Yamashita. He created brand imagery for Bud Light, Mattel, Spago, Superior grocers, and other global markets. =\\"Fear No Art\\" series= Miripolsky got his inspiration for the \\"Fear No Art\\" series when he was in the hospital recovering from major injuries he incurred in a car accident. He tired at the wheel of his car driving home from the wedding of Wolfgang Puck and Barbara Lazaroff. In the ensuing accident, he broke both legs and hips, and his face was badly disfigured. \\"I was like Quasimodo... wrapped up like the Invisible Man,\\" Miripolsky told a Hamilton Spectator reporter. While he was confined to bed at the UCLA Medical Center, an anonymous well wisher sent Miripolsky several hand-made cards, encouraging him to take hope and overcome his injuries. Miripolsky grabbed some cardboard which he happened to have on hand and painted a design to reciprocate the gesture. Eventually, he painted fifty of these cards which were autobiographical and chronicled his injury and recovery. Bert Miripolsky, the artist's father, encouraged him to publish the series which became a book titled Fear No Art: A Crash Course in Reality. The \\"Fear No Art\\" series reverberated through the art world. The phrase was picked up by defenders of controversial artist Robert Mapplethorpe. United States President Bill Clinton cited the phrase as characterizing culture during the Clinton era. Both Clinton and Aerosmith's Steven Tyler wore the \\"Fear No Art\\" button as a statement that artistic differences should be respected. According to an article in the Advocate, actor Vincent Price, in his declining years, attached the button to his robe and never took it off. \\"He died with it on,\\" Miripolsky told the Advocate. =Japan commissions= In 1988, Miripolsky was approached by a Japanese art patron, Osamu Horiba, who admired his work and invited him to exhibit his work in Japan. The resulting major shows were backed by Horiba at the cost of half a million dollars, according to the New York Times. Miripolsky thinks his work resonates so strongly with the Japanese because of its wildness and freedom. \\"They want to grasp that, to grab it,\\" he said. Miripolsky departed from his usual pop art theme to design a blood collection bag for a Japanese blood products company, Terumo Medical corporation. He returned to album covers for Tatsuro Yamashita's albums Joy: Tatsuro Yamashita Live (1989) and Artisan (1991). The latter debuted at #1 on the Oricon charts and spent 20 weeks on the charts. Miripolsky later went to design the set for the Japan Gold Disc Awards for four consecutive years. = Commercial work = In 1991, Absolut Vodka commissioned Miripolsky for his first illustration, which led to several other advertising campaigns organized around Miripolsky's original work. In 1996, the artist was recorded painting on an Absolut webcast which broadcast for a week and was titled the \\"Human Ant Farm.\\" In 1997, San Francisco's landmark billboard featured a painting titled \\"Absolut Miripolsky.\\" In 1992, Miripolsky painted a mural on the floor of University of California at Los Angeles' center basketball court at Pauley Pavilion on behalf of the 1992-1993 season of the MTV show, Rock and Jock B-Ball Jam. From 1997 to 2004, Miripolsky illustrated the sets of NBC's The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. These works were huge scenic paintings and floor art that accompanied the guest bands' segments of the show. It was the first and only time in NBC's history that the network commissioned an independent artist to create such large-format work. In 2011, Miripolsky was asked to create a mural for the fence of the newly reopening Museum of Monterey. The artist was assisted by a team of art students in creating a mural that represents the sky and ocean using four different shades of blue. Through an optical illusion, the mural gives the visual impression that the museum is sitting on undulating waves of water. Miripolsky sketched out the design on the fence first and, using a sort of paint-by-numbers system, the students colored in the mural. Museum President Todd Hood described the mural as \\"fundamentally important to the museum and to Monterey.\\" Miripolsky created a fifteen by fifty foot mural on vinyl in conjunction with Downtown Art Walk, a Los Angeles arts organization. The installation, painted on vinyl, is displayed on the wall on Olive Street between Fifth and Sixth, across from the Millennium Biltmore Hotel. It portrays a panorama of Los Angeles' most recognizable landmarks. Nearby, Miripolsky's \\"Urban Artscape\\" is a permanent installation at Seventh and Figueroa. Also painted on vinyl, the 8‚Äìfoot- by-20-foot mural was supported by Arts Brookfield and the DTLA Art Walk. Miripolsky designed the visual art for a Star Line Tours double-decker bus that makes a six-hour citywide tour, covering Hollywood, Beverly Hills and Downtown Los Angeles. Activism Miripolsky has advocated and donated his creative talent to a number of social and political causes. He has also been frequently commissioned to create artwork on behalf of various causes.

Symbolic Regression (SR) is a type of regression analysis that searches the space of mathematical expressions to find the model that best fits a given dataset, both in terms of accuracy and simplicity. No particular model is provided as a starting point to the algorithm. Instead, initial expressions are formed by randomly combining mathematical building blocks such as mathematical operators, analytic functions, constants, and state variables. Usually, a subset of these primitives will be specified by the person operating it, but that's not a requirement of the technique. The symbolic regression problem for mathematical functions has been tackled with a variety of methods, including recombining equations most commonly using genetic programming, as well as more recently methods utilizing Bayesian methods and physics inspired AI. The other non-classical alternative method to SR is called Universal Functions Originator (UFO), which has a different mechanism, search-space, and building strategy. By not requiring a specific model to be specified, symbolic regression isn't affected by human bias, or unknown gaps in domain knowledge. It attempts to uncover the intrinsic relationships of the dataset, by letting the patterns in the data itself reveal the appropriate models, rather than imposing a model structure that is deemed mathematically tractable from a human perspective. The fitness function that drives the evolution of the models takes into account not only error metrics (to ensure the models accurately predict the data), but also special complexity measures, thus ensuring that the resulting models reveal the data's underlying structure in a way that's understandable from a human perspective. This facilitates reasoning and favors the odds of getting insights about the data-generating system.  Difference from classical regression  While conventional regression techniques seek to optimize the parameters for a pre-specified model structure, symbolic regression avoids imposing prior assumptions, and instead infers the model from the data. In other words, it attempts to discover both model structures and model parameters. This approach has the disadvantage of having a much larger space to search, because not only the search space in symbolic regression is infinite, but there are an infinite number of models which will perfectly fit a finite data set (provided that the model complexity isn't artificially limited). This means that it will possibly take a symbolic regression algorithm longer to find an appropriate model and parametrization, than traditional regression techniques. This can be attenuated by limiting the set of building blocks provided to the algorithm, based on existing knowledge of the system that produced the data; but in the end, using symbolic regression is a decision that has to be balanced with how much is known about the underlying system. Nevertheless, this characteristic of symbolic regression also has advantages: because the evolutionary algorithm requires diversity in order to effectively explore the search space, the end result is likely to be a selection of high-scoring models (and their corresponding set of parameters). Examining this collection could provide better insight into the underlying process, and allows the user to identify an approximation that better fits their needs in terms of accuracy and simplicity.

It is located on /. Opened in 1952, it served as a train station for 50 years. In 2002, the ticket offices closed and it was downgraded to a train stop. With only few passengers a day using Brussels Congress, plans were being made to close it completely. However, up to now, none has been executed.  History  = 1952‚Äì2002 = Brussels Congress opened as a station in 1952, as part of the subterranean North‚ÄìSouth connection. It served as a ventilation shaft for the connection, which was then still used by steam trains. In 1958, the construction works of the State Administrative City (French: or CAE, Dutch: or RAC) started a building which was to accommodate all of the country's administrative services. The construction took 27 years and the building, at its peak, could accommodate 14,000 civil servants. Consequently, the Congress station became of significant importance for the commuting workers. However, with the rise of workers commuting by car, and later on the abandonment of the CAE/RAC building, the station got more and more out of use. = 2002‚Äìpresent = Since April 2002, when the ticket offices closed, it has only been in use as a train stop. In 2009, the Belgian Railways (SNCB/NMBS) counted 1187 people boarding at Brussels Congress every weekday. In 2010, this number was said to be 1499. Even though the number of passengers increased, it remains very low. Because of this and the fact that several other transportation facilities are available in the vicinity, SNCB/NMBS are thinking of closing the Brussels Congress train stop completely, this mainly to improve the accuracy of the trains on the North‚ÄìSouth connection. However, no final decision has been communicated yet.  Architecture  The station building was designed by modernist architect Maxime Brunfaut at the end of the 1940s. It exists mainly of an above-ground ventilation shaft for the underground North‚ÄìSouth connection, which Brunfaut smartly used as the basis for his monumental design. The main design features are the stumpy tower and the large cantilevering shed over the entrance. The tower is five floors high and exists of a central bay sticking out of the front facade, housing the service stairs, and six bays to each side of this central one. The facade of the central bay is closed. The front facade of the other bays forms a rhombic net made from terracotta. This net is continued on the highest floor of the side facades. The lower floors of the side facades are closed. On both side facades bas- reliefs have been applied. The closed front facade of the central bay is also decorated with a bas-relief, made by Jozef Cantr√©. The underground entrance is accentuated by the large cantilevering shed with the station's name written on its edge.  Non-profit organisation Bruxelles-Congr√®s  In 2007, the non- profit organisation Bruxelles-Congr√®s was established by a group of eight enthusiastic volunteers. Their goal was to let the public become familiar again with the building by opening up rooms that were previously closed to the public and using them as exhibition spaces for different art forms. They organised different projects in the station building ranging from exhibitions to music concerts. Their last event was dated March 2012.  Train services  Brussels Congress has four platforms with numbers ranging from 3 to 6. Trains only stop at platform 5 and platform 6; the other two platforms being used by passing trains. Brussels Congress is only used as a stop on weekdays during the day. The first train departs at 06:22 am and the last train leaves the train stop at 06:49 pm. During morning rush hour, a maximum of four trains per hour stop in the direction of Brussels Central Station and five trains in the direction of Brussels North. During evening rush hour, five trains stop per hour in the direction of Brussels Central Station and only three in the direction of Brussels North. During the rest of the day, only two trains in each direction stop there per hour.

He was in ill health for most of his period as Commander, and left most of the administration to his subordinates. Borghorst and his family returned to the Dutch Republic in 1670.  Background  Borghort's family came from North Holland. He entered service with the Dutch East India Company (VOC) as an assistant in India and was promoted to onderkoopman (junior merchant) in 1646. In 1653, he left to become a merchant in Ceylon, leaving in March 1663 as a second-in-command. He served briefly as administrator in Colombo, and several briefings to Jan van Riebeeck in 1655 bear his signature. On December 24, 1664, after a successful career in the service of the VOC, he left Batavia for the Netherlands on the , serving as vice-commander on one of the ships in Pieter de Bitter's return fleet. The fleet stayed in Cape Town from March 11 to April 22 of 1665 to resupply. During their return voyage, the Second Anglo-Dutch War broke out, and the valuable merchant fleet sought shelter in the neutral harbor of Bergen, Norway, but the Royal Navy did not respect the neutrality treaty and blockaded the port. In the resulting Battle of V√•gen, De Bitter defeated the English but the latter captured the Phoenix on September 13, 1665. Borghorst was plundered of eight bags of gemstones, which he had purchased in Europe to carry all the fortune he had built up over the year. This likely required him to start over with the VOC, who appointed him to the Cape as Commander in 1667.  Tenure as Commander  Borghorst left Texel, Netherlands, for the Cape on December 27, 1667 aboard the transport ship , commissioned by the full Lords Seventeen of the VOC in Amsterdam. The ship carried 268 on a difficult journey: poor weather forced two stays in English harbors (only 6 months after the end of the war) as well as in Cape Verde, at the time a Portuguese colony. Most of the crew got sick and 25 of them died during the voyage. Borghorst arrived at the Cape of Good Hope on 16 June 1668, feeling weak and sick. On Sunday the 17th, Commander Cornelis van Quaelberg, not yet aware of his dismissal, came aboard to greet Borghorst, who came to the fort later that day. On the 18th, Van Quaelberg summoned the entire Political Council of the Colony to a meeting there to discuss the Lords Seventeen's letter replacing him. Due to delays in transferring financial records and inventory, the post (and with it the keys to the gates and stores) were not fully transferred to Borghorst until August 2. Given his illness, most of his duties were handled by bureaucrats such as the fiscal Cornelis de Cretzer, who would later fulfill the same function for equally frail Commander Pieter Hackius and die tragically in slavery in Algeria. Borghorst found the task unbearable and petitioned for dismissal immediately after arrival. The VOC appointed Jan van Aelmonden, a Batavia merchant, as his successor, but he could not arrive in time. Therefore, Hackius was appointed as such and Borghorst continued to serve as commander. During his tenure as Commander, expeditions were launched inland and down the coast: a small village was founded near Saldanha. Borghorst encouraged grain cultivation and raised cattle himself, but was accused of taking the side of the Khoikhoi in disputes with settlers. He finished the canal from Zacharias Wagenaer's reservoir to the harbor, part of which was rediscovered during the building of the Golden Acre shopping center.  Departure  Hackius and his family arrived on board the ship on March 18, 1670, and formally took office on the 25th of that month. On April 17, Borghorst formally resigned and left for the Netherlands on the . Borghorst apparently was a bachelor in the Cape, and it is unknown if he ever married.  Sources  B√∂eseken, Dr. A.J.

The beach itself spans 3,450 feet on a peninsula that divides Mount Sinai Harbor from the Long Island Sound. Cedar Beach is located in the hamlet of Mount Sinai, while the peninsula on which it sits is accessed most directly from the adjacent hamlet of Miller Place. Geography Cedar Beach is located on a peninsula that stretches for over a mile westward, with the Long Island Sound to its north and Mount Sinai Harbor to its south. The peninsula contains two popular sections of recreational beach, Cedar Beach Main and Cedar Beach West, united along a continuous beachfront and adjacent nature preserve. At sunset, by Joe Maddalone Boats in Mount Sinai Harbor Cedar Beach Main is typically the most lively section of Cedar Beach and is located near its eastern entrance and the main parking areas. It includes a restaurant, bar, snack stand, restrooms, lifeguard stations, and volleyball courts. Live music performances take place in near the restaurant during the summer months. Cedar Beach West is located at the peninsula's western end, overlooking the Mount Misery Point section of Port Jefferson. This sections contains a popular fishing pier. Nearer to Cedar Beach's western end is a boat launch ramp and marina, with the Mount Sinai Yacht Club located on the peninsula. =Nature preserve= Connecting these sections behind the continuous beachfront is a nature preserve, which includes a paved walkway and a wooden pavilion overlooking the beach. Within the preserve is the Cedar Beach Nature Center, an educational center focused on the local marine biome with hands-on exhibits and local wildlife. History =Origins= View toward Cedar Beach from the adjacent beaches in Miller Place Prior in the mid-19th century, the mouth of Mount Sinai Harbor was on at its eastern side, with the peninsula on which Cedar Beach now sits being accessible from Port Jefferson. When tides and winds closed the harbor's opening, a new mouth was opened on its west side, switching the peninsula's connection from Port Jefferson to Miller Place. Dredging projects were active in Mount Sinai Harbor until the 1960s. During the Revolutionary War, Cedar Beach was the landing site of Major Benjamin Tallmadge and his detachment of Continental Army dragoons during a successful raid on British forces. Tallmadge and his men journeyed southbound from Cedar Beach along Pipestave Hollow and went on to capture and burn Manor St. George, a British stronghold located in what is currently Mastic Beach. The route of Tallmadge's march from Cedar Beach to Manor St. George is commemorated as the Benjamin Tallmadge Historic Trail. =Modern recreational use= Cedar Beach has been a popular recreational area since the expansion of the Long Island Rail Road to neighboring Port Jefferson in 1873 (and temporarily to Mount Sinai from 1895-1939). Marilyn Monroe and Arthur Miller spent time at Cedar Beach during the 1950s. In the latter half of the 20th century with the rise of suburbia, many of the summer homes near Cedar Beach were converted to full-time use. Occasionally, traveling carnivals use the parking lot. Suffolk County Department of Public Works once planned to build a spur from Patchogue-Mount Sinai Road to the beach.

The online media typically takes the form of a video, video series, or some other creative work that is outside the funding abilities of an individual business. The media elevates or otherwise promotes the core mission of the businesses in the shared industry in a manner that benefits the members of the cooperative individually. The platform aspect of the cooperative allows for the unique, individual identification of each member in the cooperative based on some type of geographic location mechanism. This mechanism could be based on physical address, IP address, or proximity/attachment to short-range wireless communication systems such as Apple's iBeacon using mobile telecommunications devices such as cell phones, tablet computers or traditional computer equipment. The intent of an online media cooperative is to improve the business environment of local stores and organizations. The disintermediation that the Internet brought about has benefitted consumers and businesses typically at the expense of small local businesses. The cooperative allows hundreds or thousands of these small businesses to join together in an economically affordable way to produce entertaining media that serves as a regional or national outreach program. This online media attracts an audience around the topic/mission and, when it and the overall online media platform is produced properly, creates a concerned and engaged \\"viewer\\" who is significantly more likely to conduct business with the local cooperative member.

Retrieved on July 5, 2010. It was operated by the Wisconsin Department of Corrections. The school campus was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988 as the Statesan Historic District, notable for being the first state-sponsored tuberculosis sanitorium in Wisconsin, and the largest. History Human tuberculosis has been around since antiquity. Early treatments for the disease included patent medicines and tapeworms. TB sanitoriums were established in the US starting in 1875, usually focusing on fresh air, good diet, and bed rest. When the German Dr. Robert Koch identified the tuberculosis bacterium in 1882, doctors began to understand how it was transmitted, understanding that it was infectious. Yet with urbanization deaths from TB increased, and by 1900 it was the leading cause of death in Wisconsin, taking about 2,500 people each year. With In 1905 the Wisconsin legislature approved building a sanitorium to treat pulmonary tuberculosis. The state purchased 200 acres on the south side of Government Hill, a sunny site with fresh air, and protection from north and east winds. By 1907 the Wisconsin State Sanitarium Hospital (Statesan) admitted its first 40 patients. An administration building had been built, a dining hall, a power plant, and several cottages for patients. The health of a patient determined the cottage, so as a patient improved, he/she moved to more healthy cottages. The initial complex in 1907 consisted of a 1.5-story Craftsman-styled dining hall, with a corner pavilion with large windows, the laundry building, the 2.5-story administration building, and men's and women's cottages - long hip-roofed buildings with full-length porches on their south sides so patients could enjoy the sun and fresh air. Most of these buildings had walls of hollow clay tile, clad in stucco. The facility immediately filled up, so the next year the state added two more patient cottages. There were 87 patients in 1910, 175 by 1912. More cottages were added, and tents. In 1913 an assembly hall/chapel was added, two stories in a style similar to the other buildings. In 1918 an infirmary was added. By 1929 the thinking on treating tuberculosis was changing. The previous approach had been largely passive: good food, good rest, and fresh air. By this time, surgical treatments were known, including pumping air between the lung and chest cavity to partially collapse the lung, and removing ribs to reduce lung activity. Coinciding with these new ideas, the facility built a large three-story 105-bed hospital. No longer needed, the cottages were probably torn down at this time. The Statesan facility was the first in the state, but other state TB sanitariums soon followed. Lake Tomahawk Camp opened in Oneida County in 1915, as a destination for male patients who had completed treatment at Statesan. Other smaller county sanatoria began to open starting in 1913. Antibiotics like streptomycin were a powerful treatment for TB, reducing average length of stay at Statesan and increasing vacancies. By 1957 occupancy was about 50% and the state legislature decided to close the facility. In 1959 it reopened as a state reformatory for delinquent boys, the Ethan Allen School for Boys.

Unhappy at Eton College (1893‚Äì1900), it was at King's College, Cambridge where he really developed, matriculating in 1900. This was followed by a research studentship at the London School of Economics. His work at the LSE on what became the first volume of his History of British Patriotism (1913) led to his election in 1907 to a fellowship at King's College, Cambridge, which he retained until 1913. In the same year he was awarded the degree of DScEcon by the University of London. In 1915 he married Barbara Elizabeth, daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel H. L. Errington and the Hon. Mrs Errington. After war service in India, Wingfield-Stratford sought no further academic advancement, instead settling down (thanks to an independent income) to a very productive life as historian and author, dividing his time between his rural home at Berkhamsted and London, where he could follow his many interests in the theatre, music and the arts. He also developed a taste for foreign travel. He married Barbara Elizabeth Errington on 30 December 1915, and on 9 Nov 1916 had a daughter, Roshnara Barbara Wingfield-Stratford (who married and later divorced Richard John Wrottesley, 5th Baron Wrottesley)The Peerage entry for Esme Cecil Wingfield-Stratford Work Wingfield-Stratford's first substantial work was The History of English Patriotism (2 vols., 1913), a theme to which he several times returned. The most lasting of his books remains The History of British Civilization (2 vols., 1928) which stands comparison with the better-known one-volume histories of England by G. M. Trevelyan and Keith Feiling. Trevelyan (thanked in the preface along with Eileen Power) was one of a number of professional historians, which also included R. H. Tawney and John and Barbara Hammond, who were his neighbours in the country and provided companions for long walks during which historical issues provided the staple of conversation. Whether writing of the seventeenth or the nineteenth centuries or the Middle Ages, Wingfield-Stratford treated figures of the past as though he had known them individually. His particular approach to history treated the real-world, physical evidence of landscape and buildings as no less significant than archives and literature. When he published his last book, Beyond Empire, in 1964 he could point to about forty volumes bearing his name, including‚Äîbesides histories‚Äîpolemical works, fiction, and poetry. Routledge was his chief publisher.Max Beloff, 'Stratford, Esm√© Cecil Wingfield- (1882‚Äì1971)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 31 May 2014 Character \\"he was all of a piece, his physical build which was wonderfully large and expansive, his high ambitions and boisterous enthusiasms which were on the same gargantuan scale, even his fierce prejudices which lay scattered like rolled-up hedgehogs along the paths of his conversation.\\"  Peter Quennell, letter to The Times, 27 Feb 1971The Times (23 Feb 1971) ¬∑ Record [King's College, Cambridge] (1971) An especially passionate country walker, outdoorsman and amateur cricketer, his unconventional dress and lilting upper-class voice made him something of an oddity. Though he embraced innovation and modernism in the arts, his great love was for the rural England and London of his youth, forever destroyed by the first world war. The political and social consequences of progress and technology were realities that made him uneasy, and he was a man of tender nostalgia for his own Merry England. In spite of the \\"aggressiveness of temper and the somewhat rhetorical extravagance of mind\\" mentioned in his obituary from The Times, he was loved and respected by all who knew him, as was his larger-than-life, eccentric personality.Max Beloff, 'Stratford, Esm√© Cecil Wingfield- (1882‚Äì1971)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 31 May 2014 Death Wingfield-Stratford died of heart failure on 20 February 1971 at his home in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire at the age of 89.

She participated in the assault on Moncada Barracks in Santiago de Cuba on July 26, 1953, an action for which she was imprisoned along with Melba Hern√°ndez. She was a founding member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba. and one of the first women to join the PCC. She maintained a high position in its leadership throughout her life. Having participated in the attack on the Moncada Barracks, Hayd√©e Santamar√≠a is among a relatively small group of people who were involved in every phase of the Cuban Revolution, from its inception to its fruition. Early life Hayd√©e Santamar√≠a was born to Spanish immigrants Joaquina Cuadrado and Abel Benigno Santamar√≠a on December 30, 1922, in Encrucijada, Cuba, on the Constancia sugar refinery. The eldest among five children, she and her siblings Aida, Abel, Aldo, and Ada were raised in a petite bourgeois family that emigrated from Galicia, Spain to Cuba in the area formerly known as Las Villas Province. She only attended school until the sixth grade, which was not uncommon due to poverty and customs regarding gender; however she repeated the sixth grade 3-4 times before leaving school, exhibiting an appreciation of reading and learning.Randall, Margaret. Hayd√©e Santamar√≠a, Cuban Revolutionary: She Led by Transgression. Duke University Press Books, 2015. In school, she was introduced to important writers, among them Jose Mart√≠‚Äîan important figure of Cuban literature and a national symbol of independence. After trying to become a nurse and working as a teacher for a short time, Hayd√©e Santamar√≠a was able to leave the trappings of her conservative family behind, joining her brother, Abel Santamar√≠a, in Havana, Cuba in the early 1950s.Randall, Margaret. Hayd√©e Santamar√≠a, Cuban Revolutionary: She Led by Transgression. Duke University Press Books, 2015. It was in Havana at this time that she started meeting Abel‚Äôs comrades, chief among them Fidel Castro. Hayd√©e Santamar√≠a and Melba Hernandez were the only two women to directly participate in the assault on the Moncada Barracks of July 26, 1953. Her roles during, leading up to, and following July 26, 1953 included acquiring and transporting weapons, being involved in the organization of the revolutionary organization of the July 26th Movement, as well as helping to assemble the urban uprising of November 30, 1956 in Santiago de Cuba alongside Frank Pa√≠s and Celia S√°nchez.Maclean, Betsy. Hayd√©e Santamar√≠a. Melbourne: Ocean Press, 2003. Print. Revolutionary and post-revolutionary activity During her imprisonment after the Moncada assault, the guards allegedly brought her the bleeding eye of her brother, Abel Santamar√≠a and threatened to tear out the other. They also brought her the mangled testicle of her then fianc√©, Boris Luis Santa Coloma. Her response was: ‚ÄúIf you did that to them and they didn't talk, much less will I.‚Äù Both Abel and Boris died after the assault of the Moncada Barracks. After her release she helped to found the 26th of July Movement, joining the guerrilla forces led by Fidel Castro and Che Guevara in the Sierra Maestra mountains. Santamar√≠a was in Miami, Florida for the planning of the 26th of July Movement. The speech History Will Absolve Me was converted into a written manifesto by Fidel Castro using lemon juice to write between the lines of letters during his imprisonment after the assault on the Moncada Barracks. The manifesto was disseminated by Hayd√©e Santamar√≠a and Melba Hernandez after their release from prison. They assumed responsibility for smuggling out the speech in sections, raising money to print them, and distributing ten thousand copies throughout Cuba with the help of Natalia Revuelta and Lidia Castro, building the mythic reputation and de facto leadership of Fidel Castro.Shayne, Julie D. The Revolution Question: Feminisms in El Salvador, Chile, and Cuba. Rutgers University Press, 2004. On September 4, 1958, Fidel Castro established the Mariana Grajales Platoon, an all-women‚Äôs battalion for the rebel army, and Fidel Castro‚Äôs personal security detail.Puebla, Tet√©, and Mary-Alice Waters. Marianas in Combat: Tet√© Puebla & the Mariana Grajales Women's Platoon in Cuba's Revolutionary War, 1956-58. New York: Pathfinder, 2003. Hayd√©e Santamar√≠a was a member of the Marianas during the war, fighting in the mountains of the Sierra Maestra. After the Cuban Revolution in 1959, she founded the cultural institution Casa de las Am√©ricas, and remained its director for two decades. This was a bold institution that gave voice to the work of Latin American dissidents, and it continues today. As well as literature, the institution brought innovative music, painting and theatre to the Cuban people. Hayd√©e Santamar√≠a‚Äôs unique role within the Casa de las Americas allowed her to practice internationalism in the face of the United States embargo against Cuba, creating a space for artists and intellectuals from around the world to meet and collaborate in Cuba.Randall, Margaret. Hayd√©e Santamar√≠a, Cuban Revolutionary: She Led by Transgression. Duke University Press Books, 2015. Her support of artistry and her dedication to the spirit of revolution helped her foster many intimate relationships with different artists. It was with the exposure at the Casa de las Americas, and support from Santamar√≠a, that Silvio Rodriguez was able to start the Nueva Trova \\"New Song Movement\\" (Nueva canci√≥n) in post-revolutionary Cuba. In an earlier letter written by Ernesto ‚ÄúChe‚Äù Guevara to Hayd√©e Santamar√≠a, he alludes to her cultural achievements, and then chooses to recall a specific incident in the mountains of the Sierra Maestra: \\"I see that you have become a literati with the power of creation, but I will confess that how I most like you is on that day in the New Year, with all your fuses blown and firing cannons on all sides.‚ÄùMaclean, Betsy. Hayd√©e Santamar√≠a. Melbourne: Ocean Press, 2003. Print. Her commitment to the cultural development of Cuba allowed her to meet many new and interesting people, but she was to be plagued by the tragic losses of her loved ones to the end of her life. Personal life and death Depression ran in her family and it severely affected her to the end of her life. Often she spent days in bed while in depressive episodes. She eventually married Armando Hart and had two children with him, Cuban writer Celia Hart and her brother Abel Hart. They also took in many children and managed their own type of orphanage. After two decades of marriage, Armando and Hayd√©e ended up separated. Hayd√©e Santamar√≠a committed suicide at the age of fifty-seven in the home she and her children shared on July 28, 1980, two days after the 27th anniversary of the attack on the Moncada Barracks. The fact of her suicide was problematic within Cuba and, some have speculated, the reason she was not mourned in the Plaza de la Revoluci√≥n, but rather was given the burial of an ordinary citizen in Havana, Cuba. Hayd√©e Santamar√≠a‚Äôs death followed six months after the death of her close friend Celia Sanchez from lung cancer, and several months after a car accident left her in chronic pain.Randall, Margaret. Hayd√©e Santamar√≠a, Cuban Revolutionary: She Led by Transgression. Duke University Press Books, 2015. The events of the Cuban Revolution left an indelible mark on her, causing her to lose many people to whom she was close, and ultimately contributing to the lifelong depression from which she suffered. In a letter published by Casa de las Americas in 1968, she wrote to Che Guevara after his death: \\"Fourteen years ago I saw the most intensely beloved human beings die‚ÄîI think that I have already lived too much. The sun is not as beautiful, I don‚Äôt feel pleasure in seeing the palm trees. Sometimes, like now, in spite of enjoying life so much, knowing that it is worth opening one‚Äôs eyes every morning if only for those two things, I have the desire to keep them closed, like you.\\"Maclean, Betsy.

Initially set in the countries of South Africa and England, and ending in Paris, France, the play is a response to some of the known historical events that occurred to a Khoisan woman known as Saartjie Baartman/ Sarah Baartman/ The Venus Hottentot. Beginning with her migration from Southern Africa to England as a dancing attraction for early 19th-century British audiences who called her the Hottentot Venus, her character remains a central figure of loving and being loved, until her untimely death in Paris in 1815. Her dead body was the subject of a pseudo-scientific autopsy that pertained to steatopygia‚Äì a condition which French naturalist, Georges Cuvier (who appears as the Baron Docteur in Venus), uses to his academic advantage. Parks' work is not intended to be historically accurate, but rather uses the concept of Baartman's career to explore colonization, racial objectification, and historical sexualization black female bodies; as Parks explains, \\"most of it's fabricated... It's questioning the history of history... It embraces the unrecorded truth.\\" Venus won 2 OBIE Awards in 1995-1996.

Here, all of the leading characters and choruses in Venus take turns shouting each other's names, and the roles they will later characterize in the play, to their audience. The Negro Resurrectionist proceeds to foreshadow to two audiences‚Äìthe Venus characters and the live audience‚Äìabout the death of The Venus Hottentot; and which the Brother and the Venus continue to address, \\"I regret to inform you that thuh Venus Hottentot iz dead. There wont b inny show tuhnite.\\". The chorus becomes an enraged audience in response to the show's cancellation, meanwhile its members talk about paying their way to look at, feel inside (the cage), and comment on sexual aspects of the naked prize they call the Venus Hottentot. The overture concludes after the Negro Resurrectionist uses a rhyme scheme (i.e., AABBCCDD) while summarizing (what he has come to know about) the course of Venus's life and death in Europe. = The Girl (scenes 31-26) = Saartjie Baartman's story in Venus begins in South Africa in the early 1800s, where she is introduced as a servant called 'the Girl'. The Brother is currently trying to persuade the Man (his brother) to financially invest in a two-year performance act in London, England. While the Girl scrubs a floor on her hands and knees in the presence of the Man's Brother and the Man, she becomes an object of their interest to create a Freak Act that will exhibit the Girl's unique genitalia and buttocks‚Äì also referred to as steatopygia. The Girl agrees to travel with the Brother to England under false pretence that they will split the profit of her African Dancing act, believing that in two-years' time she will return to South Africa with fame and wealth. However, before the Girl reaches the end of her supposed contract, the Brother sells her to a new boss called the Mother- Showman. The Mother-Showman runs a freak show in England, consisting of 8 Human Wonders, and she intends for the Girl to be the 9th Wonder. It is during scene 27‚Äìwhen the Mother-Showman forces the Girl to bathe herself‚Äìthat the Girl begins her life as the Venus Hottentot. = The Venus (scenes 25-17) = The year is 1810, and the Venus Hottentot's exhibition of her nudity and dancing has become a lucrative business for the Mother-Showman. However, a large sum of the riches gained from Hottentot's act comes from spectators who pay the Mother-Showman for private exhibitions so that they can feel her genitalia and buttocks. After a year of travelling in a cage from English town to town, Venus becomes the subject of a riot caused by her public indecency, whereupon she appears before the law in front of a court and is eventually released under the Court's pretence that \\"her show is part of God's great plan\\". Shortly before Venus's trial in front of the Court, the Baron Docteur's fascination in her was revealed, whereafter, he approaches the Mother-Showman to buy The Venus so as to study her Steatopygia and genitalia before and after her death. Upon the characters first introduction, the Baron Docteur treats The Venus kindly‚Äìoffering her chocolates, money, new clothes‚Äìso long as she agrees (which she does) to move to his home in Paris, France. = Intermission (scene 16) = During this rest period, the Baron Docteur reemerges as himself, but several years in the future, and proceeds to read aloud a detailed anatomy of the deceased Venus Hottentot. In-between the Baron Docteur's speech, The Bride-to-be reads her love letters aloud; foreshadowing a near-identical poem recited by the Baron Docteur to Venus in the past (i.e., the future, within the course of Venus). The Bride-to-be's poem: \\"My love for you, My Love, is artificial // Fabricated much like this epistle // Constructed with mans finest powrs // Will last through the days and the weeks and the hours.\\". The Baron Docteur's poem: \\"My love for you is artificial // Fabricated much like this epistle // Its crafted with my finest powers // To last through the days and the weeks and the hours.\\". After the Baron Docteur finishes his speech on the Venus's anatomy, he exits the stage, and the 7th Wonder enters to sing a song about The Venus Hottentot until the end of Intermission = The Venus (scenes 15-1) = While living in Pairs, Venus and The Baron Docteur become engaged in a love affair, which takes place amid her continuous physical examinations that the Chorus of the 8 Anatomists perform at the medical academy. During this period, the Baron Docteur is unexpectedly visited by the Grade-School Chum, whom, on multiple encounters tries to convince the Baron Docteur to eradicate Venus from his personal life and from his work. When The Venus falls ill to the clap (a term for gonorrhea)‚Äìsuspected to be from the Docteur‚ÄìThe Grade-School Chum persuades The Baron Docteur to imprison The Venus in chains for indecency. While The Negro Resurrectionist stands as Watchman over the Venus, the Grade-School Chum appears and forcefully bribes the Negro Resurrectionist to exhume the Venus' corpse upon her demise. Soon after, the Venus dies while in mid-conversation with the Negro Resurrectionist‚Äì five years after she first set foot in Paris. the Baron Docteur was able to complete his full anatomy on the Hottentot Venus, and her body parts and skeleton were eventually displayed in the Mus√©e de l'Homme. Venus concludes in the same way it began, with the Negro Resurrectionist announcing to the audience, \\"I regret to inform you that thuh Venus Hottentot iz dead. [...] There wont b inny show tuhnite.\\". The Baron Docteur and the Negro Resurrectionist each offer their own speculations for the Venus' death, only to be reminded by Venus herself that, \\"Thuh Venus Hottentot iz dead. There wont b inny show tuhnite.\\". The Grade-School Chum joins in with breaking the upsetting news to the audience (perhaps both the audience of Venus characters and the audience of Venus spectators). Venus nears the finale with a short summary of the Venus' encounter with, and embodiment of Love and Death. Which leads into the Negro Resurrectionist's final narration, \\"A Scene of Love:\\", whereafter Venus ends the play by saying, \\"Kiss me Kiss me Kiss me Kiss\\".  Plot in \\"For the love of the Venus.\\"  Written within Parks' Venus is another play called, \\"For the Love of the Venus\\". This is an adaptation of a French vaudeville called The Hottentot Venus, or The Hatred of French Women, written in 1814. = Act I, scene 3 (scene 29 in Venus) = [The Baron Docteur is the audience, and the Venus watches him] The Bride-to-Be waits on the Young Man, who appears uninterested in her offerings and bored by her presence. He begins reading from a notebook about his fathers reflections on travelling to Africa. The Bride-to-Be cries out in sorrow of being unloved. = Act II, scene 10 (scene 23 in Venus) = [The Baron Docteur is the audience, and the Venus watches him] The Father, the Uncle, and the Young Man discuss the Young Man's desire to love \\"something Wild\\" before he marries the Bride-to-Be. The three men conspire to obtain The Hottentot Venus for the Young Man when her show arrives in their town. The Uncle promises to present his nephew with a Thing to love in two weeks time. = Act II, scene 12 (scene 11 in Venus) = [The Baron Docteur and Venus are absent, so the Negro Resurrectionist becomes the audience, but appears inattentive] The Bride-to-Be is in dismay over the Young Man's love for The Hottentot Venus. She discloses this information to the Mother (of the Young Man), who makes a plan to work with the Uncle on dressing up the Bride-to-Be in the guise of The Hottentot Venus. = Act III, scene 9 (scene 8 in Venus) = [The Negro Resurrectionist is the audience] The Uncle presents the Young Man to The Hottentot Venus, who is actually an impersonation by the Bride-to- Be. The Hottentot Venus tells the Uncle‚Äìthrough a series of clucking‚Äìthat she is Wild, and the Young Man proceeds to stare at her. The two share a silent moment. While the characters stand motionless, the Negro Resurrectionist reads an excerpt from the Baron Docteur's autopsy notes on the Venus. = Conclusion (scene 4 in Venus) = [The Baron Docteur and the Venus watch the play separately] The Young Man and The Hottentot Venus continue to stare at each another, and the Young Man has fallen in love. The Hottentot Venus is assured by the Young Man that her core self is what he loves, so the Bride-to-Be removes her disguise, and is offered a box of chocolates from the Young Man. The two lovers stand motionless until the curtain are drawn closed.  Order of scenes  The plot of Venus moves forward chronologically while the scenes are ordered backwards from thirty-one to one. Parks' utility of scene reversal is a device she uses to remind the audience of the countdown to Saartjie's/ The Venus's death, whereupon her life begins again with scene one. Knowledge of The Venus Hottentot's death is a critical part of the prologue as Parks purposefully relocates the audience to a period of time where Saartjie Baartman‚Äìnow The Venus Hottentot‚Äìis dead, but then becomes resurrected on stage to tell a version of her story that once again returns to her death.  Literary devices  = Repetition and revision = A signature feature in Parks' plays is her use of Joseph Roach's repetition with revision, or 'rep and rev'. This is a literary style in theatrical performance which forces historical moments to be remade in the present through repetition of dialogues and actions, while being slightly revised with each re-occurrence. In Venus, Parks replays historical events on stage as a response to the ways that black bodies have been historically subjected to abusive and unlawful power dynamics. Beyond the character's dialogues and actions, the entire Venus play is a performance of repetition and revision in the way it retells a story of Saartjie Baartman. 'Rep and Rev' begins immediately in the Overture with dialogue like, \\"I regret to inform you that thuh Venus Hottentot iz dead... There wont b inny show tuhnite.\\", \\"Exposure iz what killed her\\", and \\"Thus doctor says she drank too much.\\". Parks repeats these lines in the final chorus, \\"There wont b inny show tuhnite.\\", \\"I say she died of drink.\\", and \\"Miss me, Miss me, Miss me\\". Parks' use of 'rep and rev' also appears in Venus's questions about her choice. When Baartman's character is the Girl, she asks the Brother whether she has a choice to move to England, and later, when her character is the Venus, she asks the Baron Docteur whether she has a choice to move to Paris. Baartman's question is the same in both scenarios, however, Venus repeats this question with new experiences from performing in England, while being geographically situated in a new location.  Analysis and criticism  = Historical accuracy of Venus and Venus = Venus is based on some of the life events that have been recorded about a Khoikhoi woman, native to Southern Africa, called as Saartjie Baartman. What is known about the life of Baartman/ Venus Hottentot does not originate from primary sources in Baartman's perspective, rather, Baartman's life is known through secondary sources from spectators who watched her acts, from her owners in England, and from the French naturalist Georges Cuvier's team of scientists and his autopsy notes. The voice of Baartman is seldom known, as is how her personality reacted to Europe's colonial dehumanization and objectification of Khoisan women. Cuvier's notes and detailed autopsy report provides among the most detail of Baartman, but none of which provides insight of her first-hand encounters as a human freak act in the English provinces, or during her final years spent in Paris under the observation of Cuvier and his research team. Baartman's story has been repeated through other people's historical accounts on her, and Parks responds to their secondary accounts and pseudo-scientific research when she writes Venus in a style that is \\"...questioning the history of history.\\". A description from a French scientist named Henri de Blainville, who studied Baartman when she was alive, provides the only account on Baartman's resistance when he highlight the \\"great difficulty convincing Sarah... to let herself be seen nude.\\", and how, despite their efforts to bribe her with money, no scientist ever saw Baartman's genitalia in detail until after her demise in 1815. Without any known primary sources from Baartman's narrative of her experiences in the years before her death, few certainties can be confirmed on the historical accuracy of the life events of Saartjie Baartman. Parks also toys with Baartman's character by creating a diva within Venus. While living with the Baron Docteur in Paris, Venus enters a monologue which reveals internalized fantasies of directing her servants, and of mingling in with upper-class members while be waited upon. Venus enjoys lifestyles of high-society, and gains pleasure in situating herself on the privileged side of a servant-master power dynamic, but unknown is whether the real Saartjie Baartman could, or wanted to participate in this lifestyle. Parks' retelling of Baartman's story and personality‚Äìas a woman with agency, and the taste of a diva‚Äìcould be as far fabricated or as realistic as \\"the unrecorded truth\\" on Baartman's history. = Dynamic structure: Love =  Historical relations  Love is the foremost represented genre in Parks' Venus. The Hottentot Venus' name takes after Venus, the goddess of love, beauty, sex and fertility in ancient Roman mythology, and prior to that, Aphrodite in ancient Greek mythology. Both goddesses represent a Western- European profile of erotic beauty, and procreation, however, an assignation of goddess-like attributes to Black women in the early-19th century treads on historically racist and oppressive grounds. On several occasions in Venus, the Negro Resurrectionist announces that \\"The year was 1810, three years after the Bill for the Abolition of Slave-Trade had been passed in Parliament, and among the protests and denials, the horror and fascination, The Venus show went on.\\". Slave-trade across the Atlantic occurred in the same breath of time as some pseudo-scientifically racist approaches to research, which Parks' personifies in the Baron Docteur. While slave-trade took effect before its abolition in the United Kingdom in 1807, enslaved women in America often received the label 'Venus'‚Äì a portrayal of objectified beauty and desire by their owners. Moments after Parks' Girl transforms into The Hottentot Venus, after being sold by the Brother to the Mother-Showman, the Negro Resurrectionist alludes to an illegal and historically inhumane reality attached to Venus's character. Elements of slave-ownership enmeshed with lustful desire towards Black women appear in Venus between the Venus and the Baron Docteur. This \\"Black Venus master narrative\\" is replayed by Parks in the Baron Docteurs' characterization as a lover of Venus‚Äìwhom he impregnates twice‚Äìand as an owner of Venus from the time he bought her from the Mother- Showman.  Personification  Love is a repeated theme in nearly every scene in Venus, and in every characters' interaction with Venus. Parks accomplishes this repetition by personifying love in three forms; the \\"love- object\\" is Venus, the unloved is the Bride-To-Be, and the lover emerges in both the Baron Docteur as the dis-rememberer, and the Negro Resurrectionist as the rememberer. Venus is an object of love from the moment the Overture begins. As characters announce her death and the cancellation of the show, Venus' body‚Äìonce a performative object‚Äìis now absent, causing outrage among the Chorus of Spectators who 'love' her. When time rewinds to the Girl's life in Southern Africa, the Brother promises the Girl (in an effort to persuade her to move to England) that people will love her if she dances for them‚Äìanother use of Parks' love-objectification of Venus' body. When the Girl later emerges from the Mother-Showman's forced-upon bath, the Negro Resurrectionist discloses his admiration of the Girl, saying, \\"Yr lovely.\\", shortly before she transforms into the Venus Hottentot. The Negro Resurrectionist sees and loves Venus' as Saartjie Baartman from Southern Africa, much unlike the Spectators, the Anatomists, the Brother, and the Mother-Showman who love the spectacle, research, and wealth which was produced through her racialized and sexualized body. The Baron Docteur is another lover of Venus, whose affection intertwines with scientific fame that he aspires to achieve after Venus' autopsy. = \\"For the Love of the Venus.\\" = Parks maintains the plays' original plot from The Hottentot Venus/ The Hatred of French Women, while repeating a dominant narrative of white, Western-European hierarchy and superiority over non-white, indigenous peoples of Africa. Parks' play-within-a-play parallels with themes in Venus in the way fetishization of The Hottentot Venus (and other black women of her time) is a \\"literal fabric- ation\\" made by Western-European peoples to help them attain other goals for themselves. In Venus, the Baron Docteur engages in a love affair with Venus‚Äìsweet-talking and feeding her chocolates‚Äìuntil her death allows him to complete her autopsy, and justify his purpose for admiring her. In \\"For the Love of the Venus.\\", the Young Man decides that before he agrees to marry the Bride-to-Be, he must experience love with The Hottentot Venus. His goal is fulfilled, and so is the Bride-to-Be's goal (to marry the Young Man) when the Bride-to-Be disguises herself as The Hottentot Venus through a no-longer socially acceptable form of performative make-up called blackface. In every instance where Parks' white character's achieve their goals, The Hottentot Venus becomes an object of love for each of their grand schemes. Through Parks' retelling of blackface history, past and present misrepresentations and mockeries of black female performers by non-black persons are made vulnerable for critique. = Feminism = Venus has been examined by a number of scholars, including Lisa Anderson who analyzed it as a commentary on the femininity and sexuality of women of African descent. Theatre and cinema scholar Jean Young states that the ahistorical portrayal \\"reifies the perverse imperialist mind set, and [Parks'] mythic historical reconstruction subverts the voice of Saartjie Baartman;\\" she further points out the ironic re- objectification of Baartman in its attempt to portray her story. However, other critiques argue that the portrayal actually objectifies the colonizers instead of the heroine. New York Times critic Ben Brantley stated that Parks \\"doesn't present Baartman as just an uncomprehending victim\\", implying that Parks had written Baartman in way that suggested that Baartman prolonged her own imprisonment for the sake of fame. Conversely, Jennifer Larson writes that Baartman's character \\"certainly engages the imperial/hegemonic/white power with innovative and creative tactics, but these tactics are not historically unique.\\".  Production history  Venus was produced by George C. Wolfe in conjunction with The Joseph Papp Public Theater, The New York Shakespeare Festival, and the Yale Repertory Theatre.

Hackett, Beatrice Beckley and David Torrence. In 1913, Adolph Zukor lured Hackett from the stage to star in a role which Hackett had played in the theater numerous times. Since feature films were in their infancy, Hackett was at first reluctant to take the part, so Zukor tried to convince Hackett in person; as Neal Gabler writes, \\"When Hackett came to visit Zukor, he was the very picture of the faded matinee idol. He wore a fur-collared coat with frayed sleeves and carried a gold-headed cane\\".

Known for her great beauty, the princess was also a noted poet, and the subject of some of the \\"most beautiful poems in Burmese literature\\" by Natshinnaung. Early life The princess was born on 12 November 1559 to Queen Yaza Dewi and King Bayinnaung of Toungoo in Pegu (Bago).Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 330 She was named Yaza Datu Kalaya because she was born on the day when the relic chamber of the Mahazedi Pagoda in Bago was dedicated for the first time.The donated materials to a Buddhist stupa's relic chamber, often gold, silver, jewelry, precious stones, and Buddha statues, were called Dat-taw (·Äì·Ä¨·Äê·Ä∫·Äê·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∫) of which dat is derived from DhƒÅtu in Pali, which means physical elements per (Rhys Davids, Stede 1993: 340). Kalaya (·ÄÄ·Äú·Äª·Ä¨) is a Burmese form of Pali KalyƒÅna, which means \\"beautiful, charming, auspicious, morally good\\" per (Rhys Davids, Stede 1993: 199). From her mother's side, she was descended from the Ava royal line. She had two full siblings: an elder brother Nawrahta Minsaw and younger brother Thiri Thudhamma Yaza.Hmannan Vol. 3 2003: 68 The three children grew up at the Kanbawzathadi Palace in Pegu, and they officially became part of the most senior royalty in March 1563 when their mother was elevated to the king's third (and last) principal queen.Hmannan Vol. 2 2003: 344 The princess was educated at the palace. She was interested in poetry, (and later became a noted poet).Ohn Shwe 1966: xvi At 15, she had her ear-piercing ceremony on 27 February 1574.(Maha Yazawin Vol. 3 2006: 37): Wednesday, 7th waxing of Tabaung 935 ME = Saturday, 27 February 1574 Crown Princess of Burma (1586‚Äì1593) According to the chronicles, the princess grew up to be a great beauty. The princess nonetheless remained unmarried into her twenties although she was pursued by many senior princes, including Mingyi Swa, her already married half-nephew and the heir-apparent of the kingdom.Ohn Shwe 1966: xxviii In 1583, Mingyi Swa's wife, Natshin Medaw, complained to her parents that Mingyi Swa spent much time pursuing Yaza Datu Kalaya.Maha Yazawin Vol. 3 2006: 78 Her complaints contributed to a fallout between her parents Viceroy Thado Minsaw of Ava and Inwa Mibaya and Mingyi Swa's father King Nanda, which led to a rebellion by Thado Minsaw in 1584.Maha Yazawin Vol. 3 2006: 79 Protected by her half- brother Nanda, Yaza Datu Kalaya continued to spurn Mingyi Swa's advances. But in October 1586, Nanda left Pegu with the army for his regime's third invasion of Siam. Mingyi Swa was left to guard the capital. With Nanda gone, Mingyi Swa raised the princess to be his queen, and formally divorced Natshin Medaw in the process. Nanda arrived back to Pegu in June 1587 from a failed campaign, and the king was extremely unhappy to learn of the news what had happened while he was away.Maha Yazawin Vol. 3 2006: 88 In all, she was Mingyi Swa's chief queen for about six years. She became a widow on when Mingyi Swa died in action in Siam.(Hmannan Vol. 3 2003: 93‚Äì94): 8th waxing of Tabodwe 954 ME = 8 February 1593 She learned of the news a month later when the defeated army brought back the body of the fallen crown-prince to Pegu.Hmannan Vol. 3 2003: 95 Princess dowager (1593‚Äì1603) Yaza Datu Kalaya would lead the next ten years of her life as the princess dowager although she was never far from advances by other men. Her most famous suitor was one Natshinnaung who first met her at the cremation ceremony of Mingyi Swa in front of the Kanbawzathadi Palace.Htin Aung 1967: 137 The 14-year-old prince from Toungoo (Taungoo) had gone to the front with Mingyi Swa, and was on one of the men who personally brought back the body. As the budding poet sang the praises of the dead hero, he watched \\"her eyes growing dim with sadness, and then sparkling with pride at the glorious death of her husband.\\" From then on, the princess became the young prince's object of obsession. She was 19 years his senior, and his aunt‚Äîhalf cousin, once removed. (Both his parents were her half-cousins.) For the next three years, he wrote poem after poem, declaring his love for her until she, a poet herself, finally returned his love. King Nanda, however, refused to permit the marriage because of the disparity in ages. The marriage became totally out of the question in 1597 when Natshinnaung's father Minye Thihathu II of Toungoo declared independence.Hmannan Vol. 3 2003: 99 Natshinnaung, now 18, was deeply hurt, and became \\"obsessed with one idea only\\": marrying his love and making the lady queen of Burma. He continued writing love and philosophical poems, which are \\"generally considered to be the most beautiful poems in Burmese literature.\\"Htin Aung 1967: 138 On , King Nanda surrendered to the combined forces of Toungoo and Arakan.(Maha Yazawin Vol. 3 2006: 100): Sunday, 4th waxing of Pyatho 961 ME = 19 December 1599 NS. Yaza Datu Kalaya, along with other Pegu royalty, was brought back to the Toungoo Palace. At Toungoo, Minye Thihathu II himself was resistant to the idea of his son marrying his half-cousin. For Natshinnaung, it was too much to take. Convinced that Nanda was still behind his father's refusal, Natshinnaung assassinated the fallen king on . Minye Thihathu was extremely displeased with his son's action, and ordered a respectful cremation ceremony for his cousin.Maha Yazawin Vol. 3 2006: 102 Crown princess of Toungoo (1603) At any rate, Minye Thihathu finally relented, and Natshinnaung finally got his wish in 1603. At Natshinnaung's coronation ceremony as the crown prince of Toungoo on , Natshinnaung and Yaza Datu Kalaya were married.(Maha Yazawin Vol. 3 2006: 105): Friday, 10th waxing of Late Tagu 964 ME = 21 March 1603 NS.

In this monograph, Freud describes psychological mechanisms at work within mass movements. A mass, according to Freud, is a \\"temporary entity, consisting of heterogeneous elements that have joined together for a moment.\\" He refers heavily to the writings of sociologist and psychologist Gustave Le Bon (1841-1931), summarizing his work at the beginning of the book in the chapter Le Bons Schilderung der Massenseele (\\"Le Bon's description of the group mind\\"). Like Le Bon, Freud says that as part of the mass, the individual acquires a sense of infinite power which allows him to act on impulses that he would otherwise have to curb as an isolated individual. These feelings of power and security allow the individual not only to act as part of the mass, but also to feel safety in numbers. This is accompanied, however, by a loss of conscious personality and a tendency of the individual to be infected by any emotion within the mass, and to amplify the emotion, in turn, by \\"mutual induction\\". Overall, the mass is \\"impulsive, changeable, and irritable. It is controlled almost exclusively by the unconscious.\\" Freud distinguishes between two types of masses. One is the short-lived kind, characterized by a rapidly transient interest, such as trends. The other kind consists of more permanent and enduring masses, which are highly organized, such as the Church or the military. \\"The masses of the former type, so to speak, ride on the latter, like the short but high waves on the long swell of the sea.\\" However, the same basic mental processes operate in both kinds of masses. Freud refers back to his theory of instincts and believes that masses are held together by libidinal bonds. Each individual in the mass acts on impulses of love that are diverted from their original objectives. They pursue no direct sexual goal, but \\"do not therefore work less vigorously\\". Freud initially called the (largely unconscious) identification with the other individuals of the mass, all of whom are drawn in the same way to the leader, a binding element. The ego perceives a significant similarity with others in the group and identifies with them. In addition, admiration and idealization of the leader of the group takes place through the process of idealization. The narcissistic libido is displaced to the object which is \\"loved because of its perfection which the individual has sought for his own ego\\". Also, a process of identification with the aggressor can take place, for example, as happens in regression. Thus, Freud came to the conclusion: \\"A primary mass is a number of individuals who have put one and the same object in place of their ego ideal and consequently identify with each other.\\"  Notes   References   External links  Digitized version of the first edition of the book at archive.org * Gustave Le Bon.

Biography Lynn Randolph grew up in Port Arthur, Texas, an oil refinery town on the Gulf Coast. She earned a BFA from the University of Texas in Austin. Shortly thereafter she moved to Houston where she has lived and painted ever since. Her paintings have been exhibited and reproduced widely in the US and internationally. In 1989‚Äì1990 she won a fellowship to the Bunting Institute at Radcliffe/Harvard where she lived and worked at the center in Cambridge, Ma. In the summer of 1987 she was awarded a fellowship at Yaddo in Saratoga Springs, NY. Lynn Randolph's paintings have been exhibited and collected in permanent museum collections and other public and private institutions including: The Bunting Institute at Radcliffe/Harvard; The National Museum of Women in the Arts, Washington, D.C.; Arizona State University Art Museum, Tempe, Arizona; The San Antonio Museum of Art; The Museum of Fine Arts Houston; the Menil Collection, Houston; M.D. Anderson Hospital Palliative Care Houston, and the Blanton Museum of Art , the University of Texas at Austin. From 1990 to 1996 Randolph participated in a collaborative exchange with the eminent feminist theorist Donna Haraway. Their engagement with specific ideas relating to feminism, techno-science, political consciousness and other social issues, formed the images and narrative of Haraway's book, ModestWitness@Second- Millennium:FeMaleMan-Meets-OncoMouse‚Ñ¢. Her paintings have appeared in many other texts, not as collaborations, but as they inform topics such as feminism, religion, cultural studies and contemporary art. Randolph‚Äôs paintings appeared in Deborah J. Haynes book The Vocation of the Artist in a chapter entitled ‚ÄúVisionary Imagination‚Äù. Her paintings opened each new part and chapter in a text book entitled Comparing Religions by Jeffrey J. Kripal. For most of her professional life Lynn Randolph has been involved with civil and human rights issues. She was a charter member and chapter president of the Houston Women‚Äôs Caucus for Art, and a member of the WCA‚Äôs national board. In 1988 she co-chaired the national meetings in Houston. In 1984 she was the co- organizer for Artists Call against US intervention in Central America. In 1992 she joined a woman‚Äôs drum corps and performed as an activist until 1997. In 1993 Randolph went to El Salvador with curator Marilyn Zeitlin to help organize an exhibition of Salvadorean artists called Art Under Duress, El Salvador 1980 to the present. The show was seen at Lawndale Art Center where Randolph also served as a board member. Randolph‚Äôs painting entitled The Coronation of Saint George was the cover image for The Nation magazine during the Republican convention in NY in 2004. In 2008 Lynn Randolph became an artist in residence at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center where she works on the palliative care unit. Here she considers herself a translator helping patients realize their memories, dreams and reflections on their lives through art.
