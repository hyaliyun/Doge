These spiders are commonly referred to as peacock spiders due to the males' colorful and usually iridescent patterns on the upper surface of the abdomen often enhanced with lateral flaps or bristles, which they display during courtship. Females lack these bright colors, being cryptic in appearance. In at least one species, Maratus vespertilio, the expansion of the flaps also occurs during ritualised contests between males. The male display and courtship dance are complex, involving visual and vibratory signals. Several species in this genus were earlier classified in the genus Saitis, containing the Mediterranean Saitis barbipes, which is superficially similar to Maratus (colorful males with an enlarged third pair of legs). Saitis in Australia have enlarged and fringed third legs which they use for display but do not raise their abdomens like Maratus. All species of Maratus are found in Australia, with the exception of Maratus furvus from China. M. furvus was first described in 1992 in the genus Lycidas, becoming part of Maratus when Lycidas was synonymized in 2012. Otto and Hill consider this species cannot be linked to any genus with certainty.  Description  Maratus species are small spiders, with a total body length mostly around 4‚Äì5 mm (0.2 in), sometimes smaller, with a high degree of sexual dimorphism. They are known as Peacock Spiders, based on the peacock-like display of the dorsal (upper) surface of the abdomen (opisthosoma) of the males, on which there is a \\"plate\\" or \\"fan\\" of usually brightly colored and highly iridescent scales and hairs, often forming patterns in which the foreground colors contrast with the iridescent background. There may in addition be \\"flaps\\" or dense fringes of hairs at the sides of the abdomen, sometimes brightly colored. In both sexes, the abdomen is joined to the cephalothorax by a long and very flexible pedicel. This allows males to raise their abdomens, which may also be capable of being flattened and waved from side to side,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-05-27/sydney-scientists-adorable- peacock-spider-discovery/7443800 thus emphasizing the appearance of the dorsal pattern. Not all species have colors that appear bright to human vision; Maratus vespertilio is relatively cryptically colored, with most iridescence on the lateral flaps. The abdominal display is used in courtship and, in at least one species, also in aggressive interactions with rival males. In almost all species, males have relatively long third legs, often brightly patterned, that are also used in courtship displays. Salticid spiders have excellent vision, with the ability to see in at least two colors: green and ultraviolet (UV). The male display includes vibratory signals in addition to visual ones. At least one species (Maratus fimbriatus) displays with its first pair of legs rather than its third pair. Some Maratus including Maratus calcitrans, Maratus digitatus and Maratus jactatus display with greatly enlarged and decorated spinnerets when their abdomen is elevated.Otto, J. C. & Hill, D. E.

Peckhamia 121.1: 1-34 http://www.wsc.nmbe.ch/species/53988 One species from Cape Riche, Western Australia, in a region which is something of a hot-spot for Maratus species, does not use its abdomen in its display at all, instead using a combination of decorated third legs and its bright blue face and fluffy white pedipalps.References Otto, J. C. & Hill, D. E. (2015c). Maratus personatus, a masked peacock spider from Cape Riche, Western Australia (Araneae: Salticidae: Euophryinae). Peckhamia 127.1: 1-30. http://www.wsc.nmbe.ch/species/54336/Maratus_personatus Male palpal bulbs are relatively simple in appearance, with a circular embolus, and are rather similar in different species. The palp usually has a simple retrolateral tibial apophysis with a blunt tip. In contrast to the brightly coloured and distinctive males, females are cryptic or camouflaged in appearance, with mottled patterns of whitish and brownish scales. The epigyne is simple, with a pair of circular \\"windows\\" (fossae) to the front and a pair of oval spermathecae to the rear. The long and flexible pedicel allows females to rotate their abdomens by more than 180¬∞ during mating.  Mechanisms used in colour production  Male Maratus species mostly display the brilliantly coloured upper surface of their abdomen, often with extensions and fringes, to the females in courtship dances. Colours are produced by two main methods using scales (or modified hairs).VIDEO: Science has uncovered the colour secret of the amazing Australian peacock spider http://www.businessinsider.com.au/video-science-has-uncovered-the-colour- secret-of-the-amazing-australian-peacock-spider-2016-8 One mechanism uses pigments to produce reds, whites, and creams in barbed scales that help scatter light. To produce blues the spiders use arrays of nanostructures reflecting light of particular wavelengths, in the case of Maratus splendens a shiny, sometimes violety blue. The nanostructures are embedded in flat, convex, sac-like scales, amplifying reflected light, according to University of Groningen‚Äôs Doekele Stavenga. This is the only animal where this kind of reflection has been shown.Splendid coloration of the peacock spider Maratus splendens Doekele G. Stavenga, J√ºrgen C. Otto, Bodo D.

The blues produced by nanostructures in Maratus do not fade over time, unlike the normal pigmenting method. Other blue animals, like beetles, are rare but also use nanostructures. Nathan Morehouse of the University of Pittsburgh found Maratus volans have four different photoreceptors (tetrachromats) allowing them to see red, blue, green, and ultraviolet and also resolve the intricacies of the male‚Äôs display designs.WEIRD & WILD How Peacock Spiders Get Their Bright Blue 'Butts' http://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/08/peacock-spiders-animals- science-colors/Blue spider scales aren‚Äôt what they seem http://bioinspired- materials.ch/research/research-stories/blue-spider-scales-arent-what-they- seemAustralian peacock spiders: New form of colour in male peacock spiders baffles scientists http://www.trans66.com/australian-peacock-spiders-new-form- of-colour-in-male-peacock-spiders-baffles-scientists/34017/  Taxonomy  The genus Maratus was first described by Ferdinand Karsch in 1878. Karsch was a curator at the Museum f√ºr Naturkunde, Berlin, and named spiders and other animals from preserved specimens collected by others. He described the species Maratus amabilis, the type of his new genus, on the basis of a single male specimen, whose origin was only recorded as \\"Australia\\". His short description mentioned the abdomen being flattened and quadrangular in shape, but otherwise did not refer to the characteristic abdominal \\"flaps\\". In a footnote, he also named Maratus amoenus (now M. volans). in 1987 was the first to restore Karsch's two species of Maratus, and moving more previously described species to the genus in 1991. Maratus was greatly expanded in the 21st century, both by known species being moved to Maratus and by the description of new species. Most of the new species have been described by J√ºrgen C. Otto and David E. Hill. Otto and Hill suggest that Maratus is closely related to the genus Saitis. Both are found in Australia, and in both genera the males have elongated third legs and unmodified first legs.  Phylogeny  The relationships among Maratus and related genera are unclear, and many species await description. Otto and Hill synonymized Lycidas with Maratus) in 2012 recognising the type species for Lycidas, Lycidas anomalus was actually a Maratus, thus causing all then named Lycidas to be subsumed by Maratus. They hypothesize that the remaining genera may be related as shown below: One molecular phylogenetic study, by Junxia Zhang in 2012, concluded that the seven Australian genera Hypoblemum, Jotus, Lycidas, Maileus, Maratus, Saitis and Prostheclina were so closely related that they could all be accommodated in Saitis but this suggestion has not been carried through to any taxonomic publication. In the Saitis group, the third leg is longer and the first leg unspecialized. In the Jotus group the first leg is longer and specialized. In both Maratus and some Hypoblemum in the Maratus group, the abdomen is raised during courtship, but only Maratus has a colorful dorsal plate.

Maratus volans (1874) means the flying Maratus, reflecting the mistaken belief this species (and indeed the genus) could fly by means of its extended abdominal flap. We now know they cannot fly and the flap is used in courtship or (in at least one case) ritualised combat. Maratus chrysomelas refers to the golden yellow iridescence of the abdomen when viewed at some angles. In 1947 Dunn used the species name pavonis meaning peacock. Zabka and Waldock continued the tradition of using Latin and Greek in the 1980s and 1990s as did Otto & Hill from 2011 on, also using a patronym for Stuart Harris in the case of Maratus harrisi. As Peacock Spiders became more popular, so did patronyms, with Maratus purcellae for its discoverer Otto & Hill 2013 and Maratus proszynski for Jerzy Pr√≥szy≈Ñski Waldock 2015. Common names featured in news media gained traction, particularly with Sparklemuffin for Maratus jactatus. In July 2016, Barbara Baehr and Robert Whyte from the Queensland Museum announced a newly discovered species to be named Maratus licunxin or Maratus licunxini after the artistic director of the Queensland Ballet, Li Cunxin\\"New dancing spider named for dancing icon\\", Arts Queensland, 11 July 2016 and honoured J√ºrgen Otto with Maratus ottoi, Michael Duncan and Michael Doe with Maratus michaelorum, and Julianne Waldock with Maratus julianneae. Maratus splendens and Maratus rainbowi refer to the same, single species, both listed here. Otto & Hill, when describing the female for the first time chose to continue to use Rainbow's Maratus splendens rather than Roewer's replacement name Maratus rainbowi. While Maratus rainbowi still appears in a number of on-line catalogs, all published descriptions and studies of this spider to date have used the original name Maratus splendens, the replacement name never having gained currency, and no longer preoccupied. In 2017 Jurgen Otto and David Hill published a Catalogue of the Australian peacock spiders (Araneae: Salticidae: Euophryini: Maratus, Saratus) in Peckhamia, (11 MB file) (loads in 39 seconds) having also recently erected a new genus for peacock spiders with significantly different genitalia to Maratus, being Saratus Otto & Hill, 2017. (81 MB file) (loads in 1.5 minutes) In the catalogue a single species of Saratus is listed, adult males are shown in photographs, range maps shows areas that have been identified in prior publications, or by unpublished observations and posted photographs that the authors consider reliable.

The speech constitutes the second of the four philippics the orator is said to have delivered. Historical background In 344 BC, Demosthenes barnstormed Peloponnese,Demosthenes,Second Philippic, 19. in order to detach as many cities as possible from Macedon's influence. Nonetheless, his mission mainly failed, since most of the Peloponnesians saw Philip as the guarantor of their continued freedom and independence.T. Buckley, Aspects of Greek History 750-323 BC, 480. They did not consider that the freedom of Greece was directly linked with the Athenian power, especially as the Athenians were allies of the Spartans. Thereby, Philip and certain Peloponnesian cities, including Argos, Messinia and Arcadia, sent a joint embassy to Athens to express their grievances. Athens' position was tough, since they wanted to keep their friendship with Sparta, but, at the same time, they did not want to accuse Philip of violating the Peace of Philocrates. Content of the speech In response to the complaints of the Peloponnesian cities, Demosthenes delivered the Second Philippic, a vehement attack against Philip and his Athenian supporters. The most serious accusation against the King of Macedon is that he violates the terms of the peace of 346 BC.Demosthenes, Second Philippic, 1. According to Demosthenes, his countrymen were misled by Philip's friends, who convinced them that the King of Macedon would save the Phocians and humiliate Thebes.

The shutdown occurred after the New Jersey Legislature and Governor Jon Corzine failed to agree on a state budget by the constitutional deadline. Furthermore, Corzine and the Legislature clashed on the issue of raising the state sales tax to help balance budget. Exercising his constitutional powers as governor, Corzine ordered the shutdown as a means of pressuring the Legislature to pass a budget. The shutdown began at midnight on July 1, 2006, when Corzine called for an orderly shutdown of non-essential government services, which was followed by a second round of shutdowns three days later on July 4. The shutdown officially concluded after the legislature adopted a budget on July 8, 2006. All government services were restored by 8:30 am on July 10, 2006. New Jersey would not have another shutdown until July 1, 2017, when the government shut down after failing to pass a budget before the midnight deadline. The shutdown ended on July 3, 2017.  Background  During the 2005 gubernatorial election Corzine, a former executive at Goldman Sachs, claimed he was \\"not encumbered by an old culture, historical entanglements and the status quo\\" and had a plan to use his experience to overhaul the budget process and trim spending. When he introduced his first budget as governor, the $30.9 billion plan included $2 billion in spending cuts as well as increases in taxes on tobacco, alcohol, and luxury cars. The most controversial item in the budget was an increase in the state sales tax. The President of the New Jersey Senate, former Governor Richard Codey, had stated his support for Corzine's budget including the tax increase. The stalemate in the negotiations had been with the New Jersey General Assembly, whose Speaker, Joseph J. Roberts, strongly rejected the Governor's plan. At the time Roberts said, \\"Our caucus feels overwhelmingly that there are much more appealing alternatives to balance the budget than a sales tax increase.\\" The New Jersey State Constitution, under Article VIII, Section II, paragraph 2, requires that the state's expenses for \\"as far as can be ascertained or reasonably foreseen\\" (i.e., the fiscal year) be provided for in a single budget act. If this does not occur before the previous budget lapses, the same section also outlaws any expenditure of money. The constitution also includes a provision in the previous paragraph preventing appropriations from going into red ink; the New Jersey Supreme Court had interpreted this to exclude loans made to cover shortfalls, and Corzine claimed that the state had a poor credit rating anyway. In three of the previous five years, the legislature had failed to meet the June 30 deadline. On each of those occasions an agreement had been reached by the morning of July 2. Aides to Corzine claimed that the governor felt he had no choice but to order the shutdown under the state's Constitution.

His head is balding and he has a gray beard with traces of brown hair. A U.S. flag is in the background. Corzine, in attempting to pass his conceptual budget, came into conflict with fellow state Democrats in the New Jersey General Assembly, particularly over their refusal to implement his proposed increase of the state's sales tax from 6% to 7% to fill a $4.5 billion budget gap. Corzine maintained that the gap could not be filled by any other means due to the state's constitution and a ruling of New Jersey's Supreme Court. Long before the deadline date, Corzine had stated that he would not accept a budget that did not include a sales tax increase. Due to Corzine's insistence, the state's General Assembly, which was dominated by Democrats, refused to pass a budget before the deadline.  The shutdown  After the legislature failed to pass a budget by midnight July 1 when the old budget ended, the governor signed executive order number 17 that immediately stopped numerous non-essential government functions, with more to come after the Independence Day holiday on July 4, 2006. State functions that ceased immediately included the New Jersey Lottery (the interstate Mega Millions game continued although players temporarily could not buy tickets in New Jersey), the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission, MVC offices and inspection stations, the New Jersey Department of Education and parts of the New Jersey Judiciary. Approximately 45,000 state employees who were listed as \\"non-essential\\" were told to stay home. Later (post-July 4) shutdowns included state beaches, public parks and historic sites, gambling in New Jersey's casinos in Atlantic City as well as horse racing in the Meadowlands Sports Complex and Monmouth Park Racetrack. Casinos and race tracks were closed because official monitors from the New Jersey Casino Control Commission and the New Jersey Racing Commission, respectively, were categorized as non-essential. At the time, New Jersey law precluded gambling establishments from operating absent state oversight. Originally, the race tracks were scheduled to close with the first wave on July 1, but a State Court order allowed them to close later. The casinos attempted a similar case, arguing that the state monitors overseeing the casinos were not paid by the state but by the casinos themselves, but the appeal was rejected at the New Jersey Supreme Court; therefore they were forced to close. According to The Philadelphia Inquirer, \\"New Jersey Transit, prisons, state police, developmental centers, veterans' homes, mental hospitals, health and disease-prevention offices, child welfare, work on transportation safety, response to environmental contamination, [and] inspectors of amusement parks\\" were not affected by the order to shut down.  Post-shutdown governmental action  To restore government services, on July 3, 2006, Corzine signed an executive order calling for an unprecedented Independence Day session of the General Assembly to work on presenting him with a budget. Immediately after listening to the governor's speech, the legislature voted by voice vote to adjourn the session. The General Assembly met again, without proposing a budget, the following day. Meeting on the third day of the special session, Democratic factions within the General Assembly reached a compromise budget. That tentative budget proposed an increase in the state sales tax from 6% to 7%, which was estimated to generate an additional $1.1 billion in revenue. The plan also included a requirement to use half of that for direct relief toward New Jersey's property tax‚Äîhighest of all states. The plan also called for the same dedicated purpose for all of the money raised by this sales tax increase in subsequent years. The new budget law included a provision for a constitutional amendment which was required, like all such amendments in the state, to be approved in an Election Day referendum. On November 7, 2006, New Jersey voters approved this measure by a two to one margin statewide. Early in the morning of July 8, 2006, both houses of the legislature passed the proposed budget. At 6:00 am that day, Corzine signed executive order number 19 to restore government services. The casinos in Atlantic City opened for business at 7:00 am Remaining government services, including race tracks and the state lottery, also reopened on July 8, 2006. State courts and motor vehicle offices resumed normal operations on July 10, 2006, fully ending the shutdown. Corzine used his line-item veto authority to reduce the budget by over $51.3 million by eliminating or reducing over 50 spending items.  Effects  During the casino shutdown, 36,000 casino workers were given leave. The shutdown of casinos resulted in lost revenue for the state, as an estimated $1.3 million per day was collected in gambling taxes plus an additional $2 million per day due to the closure of the lottery system. However, the sum of revenue not collected during the shutdown from gambling amounted to just a small fraction of the state's annual budget. Atlantic City's 12 casinos suffered losses estimated at $16‚Äì20 million per day during the shutdown. Revenue losses to lottery vendors and casino employees have not been calculated. Legislation signed by Governor Corzine in June 2008 would keep casinos and racetracks open in the event of a future budget showdown, with the Governor noting that the casino industry is vital to the New Jersey economy and that it should not operate under the threat of closure as it did in 2006. All driver's licenses and vehicle registrations that were to expire at the end of July were extended one month. The increase in the rate of the state sales tax from 6% to 7% took effect on July 15, 2006, and also increased the sales tax rate in the state's Urban Enterprise Zones (UEZs) from 3% to 3.5%. A significant change was made in the payment of sales taxes by businesses operating in the UEZs in that they would be required to pay the entire amount of the full tax rate to the state on all appropriate purchases, and wait for the state to rebate them the difference. The budget also included changes to products and services that are subject to the sales tax, effective October 1, 2006. The newly taxable items included downloaded music, ringtones, movies and books; shipping and handling; drapery and carpet dry cleaning; floor installation; contracted landscaping; self-storage; tanning; massages; tattooing; magazines; investigation and security services such as armored cars and alarm systems; limousines, except for those used in funerals; memberships in health, athletic and shopping clubs; and parking, except for employee parking, parking at municipal meters and parking already subject to municipal parking taxes. Other immediate tax increases in the budget included an increase in the cigarette tax by $0.175 per pack; a 0.4% surcharge on automobile purchases of over $45,000.00 and on vehicles with an average combined city highway miles per gallon 19 or less; a new 6% tax on fur clothing; an increase in the rental-car tax from $2 to $5 per day; and increases on several business taxes. These additional revenues were expected, when combined with spending cuts including a reduction of $200 million in higher education spending, to meet the state's balanced-budget requirement. A clause was also inserted into the budget cutting state aid for schools that hold over $1 billion in endowments. The only school in New Jersey that fell into this category was Princeton University, which had an endowment with assets over $11 billion in 2006. The university that had the largest endowment next to Princeton at the time was Drew University which had a $225 million endowment fund. Political influences Corzine's shutdown of state government had some effect on New Jersey and national politics. According to Clay F. Richards, assistant director of a poll by the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, Corzine had a 44% approval rating, his highest since January 2006. The poll also indicated that 71% of respondents disapproved of the legislature's handling of its job. According to Richards, \\"New Jersey voters clearly blame the state legislature for the budget crisis, and say the property-tax relief that the legislature insisted on in the compromise is more politics than real reform.\\" Of those polled, 23% indicated that they would not vote for those representatives who voted for the sales-tax hike in the future. The legislature's next election was in November 2007, but Corzine did not face re-election until 2009. There was also speculation that the U.S. Senate race, already seen as tight, would be affected. Republican candidate Thomas Kean, Jr. said Democratic Senator Bob Menendez did not oppose Corzine's tax hike because Corzine appointed Menendez to serve out the remainder of his own term in the Senate. According to Peter Woolley, director of Fairleigh Dickinson University's PublicMind poll, the situation of the election was similar to the 1990 election, when underdog Senate candidate Christie Whitman, a Republican, nearly defeated well-known Senator Bill Bradley due to Democratic Governor Jim Florio's sales- and income-tax increases. By August, Woolley concluded that the tax increase had had no effect on Menendez's re-election chances.

One of the Gaelic clan of Carrick he became an important figure in the government of the minority of King James III of Scotland as well as founder of St Salvator's College, St Andrews. He was the third and youngest son of Sir James Kennedy of Dunure, Ayrshire, and Princess Mary of Scotland, widow of the 1st Earl of Angus and second daughter of King Robert III of Scotland. His eldest brother was Gilbert Kennedy, 1st Lord Kennedy. James was born about 1408, and was sent to the continent to complete his studies in canon law and theology. He was a canon and sub-deacon of Dunkeld until his provision and election to that see on 1 July 1437, after the death of Domhnall MacNeachdainn, the last elected bishop who died on his way to obtain consecration from the Pope. He received consecration in 1438, the following year. He set himself to reform abuses, and attended the general council of Florence, in order to obtain authority from Pope Eugenius IV for his contemplated reforms. Eugenius did not encourage him in his schemes, but gave him the presentation to the abbacy of Scone in commendam. Bishop James, however, was not Bishop of Dunkeld for long. Bishop of St Andrews The death of Henry Wardlaw left the bishopric of St Andrews, the most prestigious Scottish see, vacant, and it was James who was postulated to the vacancy. This occurred while James was at the court of Pope Eugenius IV, busy at Florence on the historical Council of Florence. However, before royal letters arrived bearing news of James' election, the Pope had already provided his translation to the see. Formal translation took place on 8 June 1440. He was an active and successful bishop. He celebrated his first mass in his St Andrews Cathedral on 30 September 1442, and at once resumed his efforts in reform. During the minority of James III, Kennedy took a leading part in political affairs, and was frequently able to reconcile contending noblemen. He was made Chancellor of Scotland in May 1444 after the expulsion of Sir William Crichton, but resigned the office a few weeks later on finding that his duties interfered with his ecclesiastical work. When the schism in the papacy assumed a very critical character, Kennedy undertook a journey to Rome with the intention of promoting a reconciliation. He obtained a safe-conduct through England from Henry VI, dated 28 May 1446.See Thomas Rymer, F≈ìdera, xi. 128. His efforts were unsuccessful, and he probably soon returned home. Another safe-conduct for himself and others \\"coming to England\\", dated 20 May 1455,ib. p. 365. probably marks the termination of another visit to the continent. 19th-century engraving of Bishop Kennedy's tomb. In 1450 he founded St Salvator's College in St. Andrews, endowing it liberally with the teinds of four parishes that had formerly belonged to the bishopric. His foundation was confirmed by Pope Nicholas V by a bull dated 27 February 1451, and a few years later some alterations made in the foundation-charter received the approval of Pope Pius II by bulls dated 13 September and 21 October 1458. Shortly afterwards Kennedy established the Grey Friars monastery in St Andrews. He also built a large vessel called the \\"Saint Salvator\\", which was frequently used by royal personages, and regarded as a marvel, until it was wrecked near Bamburgh while on a voyage to Flanders in 1472. After the death of James II in 1460, Kennedy was chosen one of the seven regents during the minority of James III, and to him was committed not only the charge of the kingdom, but the pacification of the nobles associated with him in the government. Death and legacy He died on 24 May 1465.Watt, Fasti Ecclesiae, p. 295. The date is usually given as 1466, but a charter belonging to the abbey of Arbroath, dated 13 July 1465, speaks of him as lately deceased, and of his see as vacant.Liber S. Thome de Aberbrothoc‚ÄîRegist. Nigr. 1329‚Äì1536, pp. 144‚Äì5. Kennedy was buried in a magnificent tomb which he had caused to be built in St Salvator's Chapel. He had, it is believed, procured the design and materials from Italy. The ruins are still visible. It is stated by Bishop Lesley that Kennedy's college, ship, and monument each cost an exceptional amount of money. Kennedy was highly esteemed during his lifetime, both as an ecclesiastic and a politician. Even George Buchanan says that he excelled all his predecessors and successors in the see, and praises his zeal for reform. Kennedy is said to have left behind him several treatises. The only titles preserved are Historia sui Temporis and Monita Politica. In fiction Bishop Kennedy is a significant character in Black Douglas by Nigel Tranter, where he is depicted rather unfavourably.

Etymology The genus name is derived from Messua, a female character from Rudyard Kipling's Jungle Book. Other salticid genera with names of Kipling's characters are Akela, Bagheera and Nagaina. Taxonomy The genus was first described in 1896 by American arachnologists George and Elizabeth Peckham based on the type species Messua desidiosa. The genus Messua was synonymized with Zygoballus by Eug√®ne Simon in 1903. After examining the type specimen for Messua desidiosa, Simon commented that it was \\"much less divergent from typical Zygoballus than [the Peckhams'] description would indicate.\\" This was reversed by Wayne Maddison in 1996, and Messua restored as a valid genus. Maddison also transferred several species that had previously been placed in Metaphidippus into Messua. Species * Messua centralis (Peckham & Peckham, 1896) ‚Äì Panama * Messua dentigera (F. O.

Book with florentine paper bookmark. Fabric bookmark with Bedouin embroidery, Lakiya, Israel Metallic Bookmark A bookmark is a thin marking tool, commonly made of card, leather, or fabric, used to keep track of a reader's progress in a book and allow the reader to easily return to where the previous reading session ended. Alternate materials for bookmarks are paper, metals like silver and brass, silk, wood, cord (sewing), and plastic. Some books may have one or more bookmarks made of woven ribbon sewn into the binding. Other bookmarks incorporate a page-flap that enables them to be clipped on a page. History According to new results of the research done on the history of bookmarks, there are indications that bookmarks have accompanied codices since their first emergence in the 1st century AD. The earliest existing bookmark dates from the 6th century AD and it is made of ornamented leather lined with vellum on the back and was attached with a leather strap to the cover of a Coptic codex (Codex A, MS 813 Chester Beatty Library, Dublin). It was found near Sakkara, Egypt, under the ruins of the monastery Apa Jeremiah. Further earliest bookmarks and remnants of them have been found in Coptic codices dating from the 1st to the 11th century and in Carolingian codices from the 8th to the 12th century. Bookmarks were used throughout the medieval period,For a 9th-century Carolingian bookmark see: For a 15th-century bookmark, see Medeltidshandskrift 34, Lund University Library. consisting usually of a small parchment strip attached to the edge of folio (or a piece of cord attached to headband). As the first printed books were quite rare and valuable, it was determined early on that something was needed to mark one's place in a book without causing its pages any harm. Some of the earliest bookmarks were used at the end of the sixteenth century. Modern bookmarks are available in a huge variety of materials in a multitude of designs and styles. Many are made of cardboard or heavy paper, but they are also constructed of paper, ribbon, fabric, felt, steel, wire, tin, beads, wood, plastic, vinyl, silver, gold, and other precious metals, some decorated with gemstones. The first detached, and therefore collectible, bookmarkers began to appear in the 1850s. One of the first references to these is found in Mary Russell Mitford's Recollections of a Literary Life (1852): \\"I had no marker and the richly bound volume closed as if instinctively.\\" Note the abbreviation of 'bookmarker' to 'marker'. The modern abbreviation is usually 'bookmark'. Historical bookmarks can be very valuable, and are sometimes collected along with other paper ephemera. By the 1860s, attractive machine-woven markers were being manufactured, mainly in Coventry, England, the centre of the silk-ribbon industry. One of the earliest was produced by J.&J.; Cash to mark the death of Albert, Prince Consort, in 1861. Thomas Stevens of Coventry soon became pre-eminent in the field and claimed to have nine hundred different designs. Woven pictorial bookmarks produced by Thomas Steven, a 19th-century English silk weaver, starting around 1862, are called Stevengraphs. Woven silk bookmarks were very appreciated gifts in the Victorian Era and Stevens seemed to make one for every occasion and celebration. One Stevengraph read: All of the gifts which heaven bestows, there is one above all measure, and that's a friend midst all our woes, a friend is a found treasure to thee I give that sacred name, for thou art such to me, and ever proudly will I claim to be a friend to thee. Most 19th-century bookmarks were intended for use in Bibles and prayer books and were made of ribbon, woven silk, or leather. By the 1880s the production of woven silk markers was declining and printed markers made of stiff paper or cardboard began to appear in significant numbers. This development paralleled the wider availability of books themselves, and the range of available bookmarkers soon expanded dramatically.

Description Female Mopsus mormon eating a fly At 12 mm (female), this is one of Australia's larger jumping spiders, and very common in Queensland. It also occurs in New Guinea, northern New South Wales, the Northern Territory, northern Tasmania and Western Australia. The males are strikingly colored and decorated with long white \\"side whiskers\\", which rise to a peak surmounted by a topknot of black hairs.Jackson 1983 Females lack the whiskers and topknot, but instead feature a red and white \\"mask\\". Behavior This species shows an amazingly complex display repertoire, in some respects similar to that of several Phidippus species (P. johnsoni, P. femoratus) and Portia fimbriata. However, this is likely to be convergent evolution. Alternative mating tactics have been described, depending on the location of the female. If she is away from her nest, a type of courtship common with many other species is observed. If she is found at a nest, probing and other behaviors similar to Phidippus johnsoni occur. This second courtship seems not to depend on vision. Like many other salticids, the adult lives together with the subadult female in an adjacent nest until it matures, then mates with her inside her nest. Footnotes References * Jackson, R.R.

He was considered a mentor to his comrade Gerald Chapman, who was perhaps the most famous American bandit of the 1920s. Life and career Anderson was born Ivan Dahl von Teler to a wealthy Danish family circa 1880, Anderson graduated from the University of Uppsala and Heidelberg studying music, literature and several languages before emigrating to the United States around the beginning of the 20th century. Although he attended the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison for a time, Anderson eventually dropped out and, by 1907 had begun committing petty thefts. He was in and out of prisons in Illinois, Ohio and Wisconsin until 1914. In 1917, Anderson was arrested by police in Rochester, New York. Sentenced to five years for burglary in Auburn State Prison, Anderson became acquainted with bank robber Gerald Chapman. Influenced by the better-educated Anderson, the young Chapman became a voracious reader and self-styled gentleman, and was later known as the \\"Count of Gramercy Park.\\" Following both men's paroles in 1919, they began bootlegging operations in Toledo, Ohio and Detroit, Michigan. George \\"Dutch\\" Anderson Wanted poster In late 1921, along with former Auburn inmate Charles Loeber, Anderson and Chapman began committing armed robberies. On October 21, the three men forced a U.S. Mail truck to stop at gunpoint on Leonard Street, taking with them $2.4 million in cash, bonds and jewelry. The three men eluded identification for months. They were eventually arrested by United States Postal Inspectors William Doran, Jim Doyle and William Cochraine on July 3, 1922, after Chapman attempted to sell Argentine gold notes (stolen during the Leonard Street mail robbery) to an undercover Postal Inspector posing as a stock broker. Anderson and Chapman were both sentenced to 25 years at the Atlanta Federal Prison. Anderson escaped from the Atlanta prison on December 30, 1923, six months after Chapman's more dramatic escape from the same facility. They were believed to have teamed up again on several robberies. Chapman, wanted in the killing of a Connecticut police officer,ODMP memorial James Skelly was recaptured on January 18, 1925, in Muncie, Indiana, due to local informant Ben Hance. Both Hance and his wife were gunned down eight months later. Authorities saw the double murder as revenge by Anderson and his gang for Chapman's capture. An Anderson associate later served time for the slayings. Through his passing of counterfeit money, Anderson was eventually traced to Muskegon, Michigan. On October 31, 1925, Police Officer Charles HammondODMP memorial for Charles Hammond spotted him there, and the ensuing gunfight left both men dead.

Most nurses who provide private duty care work one-on-one with individual clients. Such care may be provided in the client's home or in an institution, such as a hospital, nursing home or other such facility.Private Practice in Nursing: Development and Management, Private duty may be paid by private pay, private insurance, managed care organizations, or Medicaid. Many private duty nursing cases involve pediatric patients on Supplemental Security Income (SSI) who have long term illnesses such as Cerebral Palsy (CP) and Traumatic Brain Injuries (TBI). Many patients need care for a Gastrostomy Tube (G-Tube), Tracheostomy (Trach) or Ventilator (Vent). Private duty nurses are usually either Registered Nurses (RNs) or Licensed Practical/Vocational Nurses (LPN/LVNs). Medicare does not pay for private duty nurses. Many private duty nurses are self-employed or work as contractors. Others work in the ever- growing field of Home Care. The practice of private duty nursing was in many senses a precursor to a rise (in the 1980s) of wider-scale nurse entrepreneurs. Non-medical care can be provided by the nurse but is most often provided by unlicensed assistive personnel such as nursing assistants, home health aides, personal care attendants, sitters, professional homemakers, or individuals with other titles.

Trzebiat√≥w is located on the Rega River in the north-western part of Poland, roughly 9 kilometers south of the Baltic coast. Trzebiat√≥w obtained town rights in 1277 under Pomeranian rulers and was initially settled by the Swedes. It was part of the Duchy of Pomerania. In 1416 the town became part of the Hanseatic League, then served as an important trade post and developed architecturally, with a typical Brick Gothic-style influence. It had trading connections with larger Hanseatic cities such as Gda≈Ñsk, L√ºbeck and Hamburg. During World War II the town escaped destruction and its preserved Old Town was registered as a protected historical monument of Poland. History Medieval defensive walls of Trzebiat√≥w The lower Rega area around Gryfice and Trzebiat√≥w was the site of a Slavic or Lechitic gr√≥d (fortified settlement) in the 9th century. The region was part of Poland during the reign of the first Polish rulers Mieszko I and Boles≈Çaw I the Brave. The first recorded mention of the town comes from 1170 when the Pomeranian duke Casimir I granted a few villages and oversight of a church in the town to settlers from Lund in Sweden. It was part of the Duchy of Pomerania, which separated itself from Poland as a result of the fragmentation of Poland. In 1504, Johannes Bugenhagen moved to the town and became Rector of the local school.Hamburgische Biografie: Personenlexikon: 5 vols.

On 13 December 1534 a diet was assembled in the town, where the Dukes Barnim XI and Philip I as well as the nobility officially introduced Lutheranism to Pomerania, against the vote of Erasmus von Manteuffel-Arnhausen, Prince-Bishop of Cammin. In the following month Bugenhagen drafted the new church order (Kirchenordnung), founding the Pomeranian Lutheran church (today's Pomeranian Evangelical Church).Pommern (11999), revised, and updated ed., Werner Buchholz (ed.), Berlin: Siedler, 22002, (=Deutsche Geschichte im Osten Europas), pp. 205-220. .Theologische Realenzyklop√§die: 36 vols., Gerhard M√ºller, Horst Balz and Gerhard Krause (eds.), Berlin et al.: de Gruyter, 1977‚Äì2007, vol. 27 (1997): 'Politik, Politologie - Publizistik, Presse', pp. 43ff. .Richard Du Moulin Eckart, Geschichte der deutschen Universit√§ten (11929), reprint: Hildesheim and New York: Olms, 21976, pp. 111f. . As a dowager, Sophia of Schleswig-Holstein- Sonderburg (1579‚Äì1658), widow of Philip II, Duke of Pomerania, lived in Treptow. Sophia's dower was a former nunnery, which she converted into a palace. While in Swedish service and thereafter Duke Francis Henry of Saxe- Lauenburg spent a lot of time with Duchess dowager Sophia in Treptow. Sophia's and Francis Henry's fathers were cousins. On 13 December 1637 Francis Henry and Marie Juliane of Nassau-Siegen (1612‚Äì1665) married in Treptow.N.N., \\"VII.

Francis Henry also served Sophia as administrator of the estates pertaining to her dower. In 1637 Philip II died leaving the Pomeranian ducal house extinct. At this point the duchy came under Swedish occupation with the Brandenburgian electors claiming succession in Pomerania. It was not until 1648 that the electors annexed the central and eastern part of the former duchy, which formed the newly established province of Pomerania. Palace in Trzebiat√≥w, former home of the Polish writer Maria Wirtemberska In 1750 the local palace was refurbished in classicist style for General Frederick Eugene of W√ºrttemberg, who resided there ‚Äì with interruptions ‚Äì until 1763. In the late 18th century, thanks to Polish noblewoman and writer Maria Wirtemberska n√©e Czartoryska, the cultural life of the town was revived. She lived in the Trzebiat√≥w Palace, and her early works and translations were created here. The Polish painter Jan Rustem visited her several times, and his paintings were part of the palace's art collection. The palace now houses a public library, founded in 1946 and named after Maria Wirtemberska n√©e Czartoryska since 1999. With the end of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, Brandenburg-Pomerania, already since 1618 ruled in personal union with Ducal Prussia (Kingdom since 1701), also legally merged into Prussia and the different German confederacies and empires of which it formed part since. Preserved townhouses in the Old Town Near the end of the World War II, in February 1945, despite the approaching front, the German authorities did not allow for the evacuation of the town's population. It was not until March 4 that the order to evacuate was issued, the day after the German army left the town, leaving the defenseless civilian population at the mercy of the approaching Soviet Army.Trzebiat√≥w: przewodnik historyczny, Kubacki, p. 8. After the war the central and eastern part of Western Pomerania, including Trzebiat√≥w, became part of Poland. The town's German population was expelled, and the town was resettled with Poles, many of whom were themselves expelled from pre-war Eastern Poland, annexed by the Soviet Union. Since 1 January 1999, the town has been within West Pomerania Voivodeship, upon its formation from the former Szczecin and Koszalin voivodeships. Culture Trzebiat√≥w Train Station Trzebiat√≥w's Day of the Buckwheat is a celebration during the first week of August. It is held in memory of the day when the town guard mistakenly dropped a hot bowl of buckwheat meal on invaders from the nearby town of Gryfice, alarming the whole town and ultimately saving it. Inhabitants of Trzebiat√≥w celebrate that event with dances, concerts, competitions and by eating cereal with ham and bacon.

Its described species occur mostly in Eurasia, with some species found in North and South America. One species, N. convolutus, is also found in Algeria. Two species are known from Australia, N. australis and N. taylori. N. australis has palp morphology and fringing on its first pair of legs very similar to that seen in N. nojimai Ikeda 1995, from Japan. N. taylori is most similar in morphology to N. sumatranus from Indonesia and N. kovblyuki from the Crimea and elsewhere. The genus is common and widespread in litter throughout Australia, from the highlands of Tasmania through the hot, dry inland to the wet tropics and includes many undescribed species.Richardson, B. J. (2013). New unidentate jumping spider genera (Araneae: Salticidae) from Australia. Zootaxa 3716: 460-474. Spiders in Neon are tiny to small, usually less than 5mm in body length. In the genus definition it says \\"Small unidentate spiders ranging from about 1.4 to 3.0mm in length.\\" A precise definition of the genus was provided by Gertsch & Ivie (1955). Lohmander (1945) first established a subgenus Dicroneon for Neon levis (Simon). Neon reticulatus (Blackwall) and its relatives were assigned by Gertsch & Ivie to another subgenus, Neon.Logunov, D. V. (1998a). The spider genus Neon Simon, 1876 (Araneae, Salticidae) in SE Asia, with notes on the genitalia and skin pore structures. Bulletin of the British Arachnological Society 11: 15-22 The molecular phylogeny of the Salticidae developed by Maddison and co-workers places Neon in the Astioida and most closely related to the Australian-based Astiae radiation. It is possible as a consequence, that Neon is an originally Australian genus that has spread to other regions. However the only species of this genus sequenced (Maddison and Hedin 2003; Bodner and Maddison 2012), N. nelli, belongs within the subgenus Neon, unlike all the presently known Australian species that are more similar to members of the subgenus Dicroneon from the oriental region.

It is the only genus in the subfamily Onomastinae. Description Onomastus species are delicate, translucent spiders, with long legs compared to most other members of the family Salticidae. Males have highly complex palpal bulbs. Two clades have been distinguished: in species from Southeast Asia, the palpal bulb has a broad conductor; in those from South Asia it has a medial branch on the median apophysis. Like species of the subfamilies Lyssomaninae and Asemoneinae, the anterior lateral eyes form a separate row from the anterior median eyes. The genus was originally diagnosed on the basis of the arrangement of the eyes. Taxonomy The genus Onomastus was first described by Eug√®ne Simon in 1900. He placed it in the \\"Attidae\\", the name he then used for the family Salticidae. It was later placed in a broadly defined subfamily Lyssomaninae, although by the 1980s it was agreed that this subfamily consisted of three groups.

Note that the unique spelling of \\"voudon\\" is an innovation of Bertiaux's, (though it is similar to the traditional spelling of vodun). Bertiaux also coined the term vudutronics to refer to his idiosyncratic interpretation of this religion. Early life Bertiaux was born in Seattle, Washington, on January 18, 1935. His father was a captain in the merchant navy and his mother was a prominent Theosophist. Bertiaux served as an Episcopalian minister in the Seattle area before traveling to Haiti in 1964. Voudon and other occult activities In 1964, Bertiaux traveled to Haiti, where he was initiated into the system of Haitian Vodoun. He settled in Chicago in 1966, where he formed (among other bodies) the Neo-Pythagorean Gnostic Church. Bertiaux's interpretation of Vodoun was strongly influenced by Martinism, a Francophone occultist society who pretended to inherit from the teachings of Louis-Claude De Saint Martin, although the regularity and mere existence of such a linkage was questioned, and which became established in Haiti in the 18th century. Bertiaux had long been associated with the Ordo Templi Orientis Antiqua, a initiatic gnostic-magical order supposedly founded in 1921 in Haiti by the gnostic patriarch and Voudon high priest Lucien- Francois Jean-Maine. The O.T.O.A. \\"tradition\\" comes from the gnostic voudon, as practiced in secret societies. There, a synthesis was purportedly developed between European gnostic-hermetic currents, being the heritage of the ancient western initiatic tradition, and Haitian metaphysics. Within the group, the O.T.O.A. works through the Monastery of the Seven Rays system. Both of these organizations cooperate with the gnostic church Ecclesia Gnostica Spiritualis. La Couleuvre Noire (The Black Snake) is an independent order founded in 1922, closely cooperating with the O.T.O.A. It is dedicated to the practice of advanced techniques of Gnostic Voudon, a system of \\"Afro-Atlantean magic\\". Today, Courtney Willis (Tau Ogdoade-Orfeo VIII) is the Hierophant and the Sovereign Grand Master Absolute (SGMA) of the L.C.N. as well as the S.G.M.A. of the O.T.O.A. Michael Bertiaux (Tau Ogdoade-Orfeo IV) is the Grand Conservateur of the L.C.N. and the Hierophant of the O.T.O.A. For a period, Michael Bertiaux was also a secretary of the Theosophical Society until moving to Chicago in 1966, where he trained and qualified as a social worker, a job he remained in for just under forty years. He specialized in working with the Chicago Haitian community, which currently has a population of around 5,000-15,000. Bertiaux's life and occult system are examined in Kenneth Grant's books, Cults of the Shadow (1975), Nightside of Eden (1977), Outside the Circles of Time (1980), and Hecate's Fountain (1993). Grant devotes two entire chapters of Cults of the Shadow to a discussion and analysis of Bertiaux's work in La Couleuvre Noire, as well as a portion of the chapter \\"Afro-Tantric Tarot of the Kalas.\\" Bertiaux was also featured in the 1985 book and documentary by Nevill Drury, The Occult Experience. Bertiaux's magical system is complex, including terms unique to himself, such as the \\"meon\\" and \\"Zoythrian\\" energies but also drawing on magical extensions of the writings of H.P. Lovecraft and the teachings of A. Crowley's Aiwass. Following his retirement, Bertiaux has focused on his art and writing.

It was his fourth solo single, following \\"Burning Car\\" in July that year. The track was not included on any original album, falling roughly midway between the release of Foxx's debut LP Metamatic in January 1980 and his second album The Garden in September 1981. Sonically, as well as chronologically, \\"Miles Away\\" was a transitional song in Foxx‚Äôs catalogue, its instrumentation being heavy with synthesizers, as in previous solo releases, but also featuring the acoustic drum sound that would characterise his remaining 1980s work. No detail on the electronics used in the song appeared on the original single's sleeve, however Foxx's studio equipment at the time included an ARP Odyssey, a Minimoog, an Elka 'String Machine', and an ARP Analog Sequencer. The fanfare- like synthesizer lines of \\"Miles Away\\" were reminiscent of the track \\"Slow Motion\\" which opened the album Systems of Romance, Foxx's last with former band Ultravox. Regarding the song's title and subject matter, Foxx said \\"You know when you're looking out of a window or you're not quite present, you know you're with someone but your mind is on something else, and that is quite often my state of mind I think, so I decided to write a song about it.\\"\\"A Kind of Wave\\" French TV interview The lyrics and cover photograph also appear to reference 'The Quiet Man', an alternate character developed by Foxx in the late 1970s that personified detachment and observation (\\"I'm a new man when I walk away\\"). Foxx has described The Quiet Man as habitually wearing a nondescript grey suit that he (Foxx) found in an Oxfam shop. The picture sleeve of \\"Miles Away\\" depicts just such a \\"grey suit, white shirt and dark tie\\",\\"The Quiet Man\\" extract arranged across a lounge chair. The B-side, \\"A Long Time\\", was written and performed with Shake Shake, a group comprising Duncan Bridgeman and Jo Dworniak,\\"A Secret Life\\" Q&A; along with Philip Roberts, all of whom would appear on Foxx‚Äôs next album, The Garden. The track's psychedelic flavour foreshadowed Foxx's The Golden Section (1983). The single made #51 in the UK charts in 1980. \\"Miles Away\\" appears on the 1993, 2001 reissues of Metamatic and on the 2008 re-issue of The Garden, which also features an \\"alternative version\\" of the song. It also appears on the John Foxx compilations \\"Modern Art\\" (2001), \\"Glimmer\\" (2008) and \\"Metadelic\\" (2013). A live version performed by John Foxx and Louis Gordon is featured on the album \\"Neuro Video\\", recorded at The Luminaire in London, on 24 November 2007. \\"A Long Time\\" appears on the 1993 reissue of Metamatic and 2001 edition of The Garden while an \\"alternative version\\" appears on the 2008 re-issue of \\"The Golden Section\\".

The fossils of Baptornis advenus, the type species, were discovered in Kansas, which at its time was mostly covered by the Western Interior Seaway, a shallow shelf sea. It is now known to have also occurred in today's Sweden, where the Turgai Strait joined the ancient North Sea; possibly, it occurred in the entire Holarctic. Othniel Charles Marsh discovered the first fossils of this bird in the 1870s. This was, alongside the Archaeopteryx, one of the first Mesozoic birds to become known to science. Ecology More material evidence exists for the ecology of B. advenus than for any other member of the Hesperornithes, with the possible exception of Hesperornis regalis, but still much is left to conjecture. The loon-sized bird was of middle size among its relatives and had a markedly elongated neck. Presumably, it thus behaved in a manner similar to today's darters, hunting smaller, more mobile prey than its larger relatives. Unlike a darter however, it could not spear its prey, but instead held it with its beak like today's mergansers. The waters which it inhabited were fairly shallow epicontinental or shelf seas. Remains found far off the prehistoric shore suggest that it either ventured far out and/or that it bred on islands. A considerable number of juvenile specimens are known. These tend to be from the northern part of its range - today's Canada and Alaska - though they have also been found in Kansas. This suggests that the birds were migratory like some penguins are today, moving polewards in summer to breed. The Cretaceous had a much warmer climate than today; the waters inhabited by Baptornis were subtropical to temperate. While it was excellently adapted to swimming and diving, Baptornis is thought to have been clumsy on land, pushing itself along the rocks with its feet rather than actually walking. The natural position of the lower legs was flush against the body, with the feet stretched out sideways and thus it would have been unable to move upright without toppling over. As opposed to Hesperornis which almost certainly had to slide on its belly or galumph like an earless seal, Baptornis's lower leg was not as firmly placed along the body sides. Thus, it would have found it more easy to place its feet under its body with the toes pointing forwards and might have managed small hops or even an awkward waddle, body held low to the ground. The only certain record of Hesperornithes' food found so far comes from Baptornis: Specimen UNSM 20030 was found associated with some coprolites. These are small round lumps - maybe a centimeter in diameter or so - and contain the remains of a small species of the sabre-toothed \\"herring\\" Enchodus, possibly E. parvus. Baptornis had powerful gastric juices and/or regurgitated most indigestible parts of its prey as a pellet like most living fish-eating birds do, because the Enchodus remains make up only a small fraction of the coprolites' mass, most of which was nondescript feces. Systematics Baptornis was related to the bigger, better known Hesperornis. Both belonged to the Hesperornithes, a group of prehistoric birds which were uniquely adapted to diving and swimming, and had teeth. Otherwise, they were fairly similar to living birds rather than to more dinosaur-like forms such as Archaeopteryx or the Enantiornithes. As Baptornis was quite peculiar among the Hesperornithes, the family Baptornithidae has been established for it. Presently this is considered monotypic by most. However, it was recently establishedRees & Lindgren (2005). that the supposed \\"Cretaceous flamingo\\" Parascaniornis stensioi from the Late Cretaceous of Iv√∂ Island in Sweden was not a flamingo and neither, as suggested by others, a gaviiform (loon) nor a procellariiform, but in fact belongs with Baptornis. As there is insufficient material for a proper comparison, it is not known whether it is also a junior synonym of B. advenus or a second species. In 2004, it was announced that material of a second species were being prepared for description. This specimen was about twice as massive as the type of B. advenus. The bones had been found in the lower Pierre Shale of SW South Dakota.Person (2004). James Martin and Amanda Cordes-Person named this species Baptornis varneri in 2007, but it was later reclassified as a species of the genus Brodavis and may not have been closely related to B. advenus.Martin, L.D. et. al (2012) In addition, two other prehistoric diving birds of the Late Cretaceous are sometimes placed in the Baptornithidae: Potamornis is in all probability a member of the Hesperornithes. However, it is unclear with which of these it is most closely allied; some place it in the Baptornithidae. More interesting - or controversial - is the case of Neogaeornis. This bird, whose remains were found in Chile, might be a baptornithid also. Others consider it closely related to certain modern birds, either the Gaviiformes, or the Procellariiformes.

(Since late 2018, live bookmarks are no longer supported.) In the context of the World Wide Web, a bookmark is a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) that is stored for later retrieval in any of various storage formats. All modern web browsers include bookmark features. Bookmarks are called favorites or Internet shortcuts in Internet Explorer, and by virtue of that browser's large market share, these terms have been synonymous with bookmark since the first browser war. Bookmarks are normally accessed through a menu in the user's web browser, and folders are commonly used for organization. In addition to bookmarking methods within most browsers, many external applications offer bookmark management. Bookmarks have been incorporated in browsers since the Mosaic browser in 1993.\\"New X-based information systems browser available.\\", post to comp.infosystems by Marc Andreessen on February 16, 1993 Bookmark lists were called Hotlists in Mosaic\\"May World-Wide Web News\\" in 1993 by Tim Berners-Lee and in previous versions of Opera; this term has faded from common use. Other early web browsers such as ViolaWWW and Cello also had bookmarking features. With the advent of social bookmarking, shared bookmarks have become a means for users sharing similar interests to pool web resources, or to store their bookmarks in such a way that they are not tied to one specific computer or browser. Web- based bookmarking services let users save bookmarks on a remote web server, accessible from anywhere. Newer browsers have expanded the \\"bookmark\\" feature to include variations on the concept of saving links. Mozilla Firefox introduced live bookmarks in 2004,\\"Mozilla Foundation Releases the Highly Anticipated Mozilla Firefox 1.0 Web Browser\\", press release on November 9, 2004 which resemble standard bookmarks but contain a list of links to recent articles supplied by a news site or weblog, which is regularly updated via RSS feeds; however, Mozilla removed this feature in 2018. \\"Bookmarklets\\" are JavaScript programs stored as bookmarks that can be clicked to perform a function. Storage The bookmarks sidebar in Mozilla Firefox 3.0. An alternative to the bookmarks menu, it is similar to sidebars found in Internet Explorer, Opera, and Safari. Each browser has a built-in tool for managing the list of bookmarks. The list storage method varies, depending on the browser, its version, and the operating system on which it runs. Netscape-derived browsers store bookmarks in the single HTML-coded file bookmarks.html. This approach permits publication and printing of a categorized and indented catalog, and works across platforms. Bookmark names need not be unique. Editing this file outside its native browser requires editing HTML. Firefox 3 stores bookmarks, history, cookies, and preferences in a transactionally secure database format (SQLite). Internet Explorer's \\"Favorites\\" (also \\"Internet Shortcuts\\") are stored as individual files named with the original link name, and the filename extension \\".URL\\", for example \\"Home Page.URL\\" collected in a directory named \\"Favorites\\" which may have subdirectories. Bookmark names must be unique within a folder. Each file contains the original URL and Microsoft-specific metadata. Browsers have varying abilities to import and export bookmarks to favorites, and vice versa. Bookmarklets A bookmarklet in action Bookmarklets are JavaScript programs stored as bookmarks. The term is a portmanteau of the words bookmark and applet. Bookmarklets are possible because the JavaScript URI scheme allows JavaScript programs to be stored as URIs, which can be stored in bookmarks. Bookmarklets have access to the current page, which they may inspect and change. As such, they can be simple \\"one-click\\" tools which add functionality to the browser. Bookmarklets are typically installed by navigating to a web page that links to a JavaScript URI, right-clicking the link, and clicking the bookmark option. Web developer Steve Kangas got the idea from the Netscape JavaScript Guide, and coined the term bookmarklets in 1998. Brendan Eich, the inventor of JavaScript, explained bookmarklets as follows: Live bookmarks Live bookmarks are Internet bookmarks powered by RSS, particularly in Mozilla Firefox. They allow users to dynamically monitor changes to their favorite news sources. Instead of treating RSS-feeds as HTML pages like most news aggregators do, they are treated as bookmarks that are updated in real-time with a link to the appropriate source. Live bookmarks are updated automatically; however no browser option exists to prevent or control the automatic Live Bookmark updates. Live bookmarks were available in Firefox from 2004 until December 2018; since then, Firefox no longer supports them.

It possesses a characteristic musk-like odor. Androstenol, or a derivative, is found in truffles. This was offered as an explanation for how pigs locate them deep in the ground: Androstenol is produced in the saliva of male pigs. However, experiments in France using pigs to scent truffles, truffle extract and purified androstenol showed that pigs responded to the first two (actually trying to eat dirt containing the truffle extract), but ignored the androstenol. A positional isomer of androstenol, 3Œ≤-androstenol (5Œ±-androst-16-en-3Œ≤-ol), is also endogenous to humans (as well as to pigs), behaving as a pheromone and contributing to axillary odor. Biosynthesis In humans and boars, androstenol is biosynthesized in the testes. Pregnenolone is metabolized into androstadienol by the 16-ene-synthetase activity of CYP17A1. Androstadienol is then sequentially converted into androstenol by 3Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (androstadienol to androstadienone), 5Œ±-reductase (androstadienone to androstenone), and 3Œ±-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (androstenone to androstenol), in a manner analogous to the biosynthesis of 3Œ±-androstanediol from dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). Androstenol may also be synthesized in the adrenal glands and the ovaries in humans. In addition, androstenol may be synthesized in the human nasal mucosa from androstenone, and likely also from androstadienol and androstadienone in this area. Distribution Considerable amounts of androstenol are present in human urine, and it is also present in the blood plasma and saliva of humans and pigs as well as in the axillary sweat of humans. Due to its ability to cross the blood-brain-barrier, androstenol is likely present in the central nervous system as well. Biological activity Androstenol, similarly to the related endogenous steroids 3Œ±-androstanediol and androsterone, has been found to act as a potent positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA. It has been proposed that this action may mediate the pheromone effects of androstenol. Moreover, as androstadienol, androstadienone, and androstenone are all converted into androstenol, it could mediate their pheromone effects as well. In animals, androstenol has been found to produce anxiolytic-like, antidepressant-like, and anticonvulsant effects. Androstenol has also been found to modify the behavioral and social responses of humans. In addition, androstenol has been found to decrease luteinizing hormone (LH) pulse frequency during the follicular phase of the human menstrual cycle. In accordance, it has been proposed that androstenol may be involved in the menstrual synchrony of women. In contrast to androstenol (3Œ±-androstenol), its 3Œ≤-epimer, 3Œ≤-androstenol, does not potentiate the GABAA receptor, even at high concentrations. This is in accordance with other 3Œ≤-hydroxy steroids, including isopregnanolone, epipregnanolone, 3Œ≤-dihydroprogesterone, and 3Œ≤-androstanediol, which similarly do not act as such, in contrast to their 3Œ±-hydroxy variants. Androstenol, along with several isomers of androstanol, is an antagonist of the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR). Androstenol has minimal or no androgenic activity.

The national side is ranked 36th in the world (as of 29 July 2019).https://www.world.rugby/rankings/mru?lang=en History Rugby was introduced into Lithuania in 1961. However, as the country was a part of USSR a national team could not be formed. The only games played before 1993 were friendlies with Latvia and a representative team from Kaliningrad. After the reestablishment of independence in 1990 Lithuania's rugby authorities worked to gain international recognition and by 1993 the national team was participating in the qualifying for the 1995 Rugby World Cup. It also joined the 1992-1994 FIRA Trophy competition at the bottom of the pyramid but failed to win any of the games. The first official victory was in 1996 over Luxembourg during the qualifying competition for the 1999 World Cup. Overall, the 1990s were a poor decade for the national team. Until 2006 Lithuania was lingering in the middle of the European Nations Cup Third Division. However, a 100 percent record in their 2006-2008 European Nations Cup Third Division campaign earned them promotion from Division 3B to Division 3A. This effort was followed by a perfect record in the 2008-2010 European Nations Cup Third Division and a further promotion to Division 2A. Moreover, victories over Israel and the Netherlands to advance to the semifinal round of European qualification for a spot in the 2011 Rugby World Cup Final Place Play-off. The rise in form of the national has resulted in an increase in the popularity of the sport in Lithuania. During their 2008‚Äì10 European Nations Cup campaign, Lithuania was credited with setting a new record for consecutive Test wins in men's rugby. Their 77‚Äì5 away win over Serbia on April 24, 2010 was listed as their 18th straight, surpassing the previous record set by New Zealand in 1965‚Äì69 and by South Africa in 1997‚Äì98. This undefeated campaign, which could have led to a Lithuanian presence at the 2011 Rugby World Cup, ended in the 27‚Äì16 loss on to Ukraine in the European qualifying semifinal. However, on later review, it was found that the first game in the 18-game sequence was in fact a loss, and as such are now credited with having held an equal record with South Africa and New Zealand (the record was broken by Cyprus in 2013).

The character was originally played by Danny Webb and appeared in a recurring capacity. When Aaron was reintroduced in 2008, he was promoted to the full-time cast and the decision was made to recast the role. Miller successfully auditioned for the part and later admitted that he would have quit acting, if he had not been cast. Aaron made his first appearance during the episode broadcast on 24 December 2003. Aaron is the son of Chas Dingle (Lucy Pargeter) and Gordon Livesy (Gerard Fletcher; Gary Mavers). His storylines have included being involved with the criminal McFarlane family, making a romantic advance towards his best friend Adam Barton (Adam Thomas), coming to terms with his homosexuality, his relationship with Jackson Walsh (Marc Silcock) and Jackson's suicide. Miller chose to leave the show in November 2011 and he made his final appearance on 5 April 2012. Aaron's exit storyline saw him accused of arson and so he left the village with his new partner Ed Roberts (Lloyd Everitt). Two years later, Miller reprised the role and Aaron returned on 14 August 2014, as part of a heist storyline involving Donna Windsor (Verity Rushworth) and Ross Barton (Michael Parr). The character's most notable storylines since his return have been his relationship with Robert Sugden (Ryan Hawley), his role in Katie Sugden's (Sammy Winward) death, self-harming, revealing that he was sexually abused by his father when he was a child, reuniting with his estranged half- sister Liv Flaherty (Isobel Steele) and becoming her guardian, being sent to prison for GBH, and breaking up and reuniting with Robert, playing a part in raising his son, and marrying him.

The two begin to bond, before Aaron returns home to his father. Aaron returns to visit Chas, but she reprimands him after she catches him talking to other people about her behind her back. Louise Appleton (Emily Symons) witnesses Chas slapping Aaron and tells Gordon when he arrives to collect his son. Gordon tells Chas that her relationship with her son is over and that Aaron will not visit her again. Despite this, Aaron returns to Emmerdale several months later, staying longer than expected as he came into contact with a person who had German measles and Sandra was pregnant. Aaron returns home to his father and his stepmother, after telling Chas that while she was in the Army, her partner Carl King (Tom Lister) had a one-night stand with her cousin, Del Dingle (Hayley Tamaddon). 2008‚Äì2012 Aaron (now Danny Miller) returns to the village two years later and is arrested by Ross Kirk (Samuel Anderson) for possession of drugs.

Aaron discovers that Chas has resumed her relationship with Carl and he tells her that he wants nothing more to do with her. He refuses to move in with her and Carl and, after much convincing, gets Paddy to agree to let him stay with him. In anger over his mother's new relationship, he tampers with the brakes on Carl's car, but when he realises that Jimmy and Nicola King are driving it with their infant daughter, he stops them and fixes it. When Chas finds out, she angrily tells him that she does not want anything to do with him anymore. After this, Aaron slowly starts to change into a better person. Despite Paddy's initial annoyance at his presence, the two form a close father-son relationship. Aaron begins dating Holly Barton (Sophie Powles) and makes friends with her brother, Adam (Adam Thomas). After Aaron and Adam are involved in a run-off-road collision, Aaron tries to kiss Adam. Aaron is embarrassed and tells Adam that he misunderstood the situation. Aaron sleeps with Holly and Adam tells his family that he thinks Aaron is gay.

Aaron then tells Jackson that he loves him. Aaron watches Jackson's video diary and is shocked to hear Jackson admit that he wants to die, he tells Hazel and they try to work out how to help Jackson. Aaron confesses to Jackson that both he and Hazel have watched his video diary. Aaron and Hazel then become determined to show Jackson that he has a life worth living. Jackson is admitted to hospital with a chest infection and it strengthens his resolve to end his life. Jackson, Aaron and Hazel go to Whitby and Aaron books Jackson on a tandem skydive. Aaron thinks Jackson has changed his mind about dying, but he has not. Aaron is shocked to learn that Jackson has managed to convince Hazel to help him end his life. Jackson later promises Aaron that nothing is going to happen until Aaron is ready. Jackson breaks up with Aaron to make the process easier and Aaron agrees to help Jackson end his life. Jackson tells his mother and Aaron how grateful he is for their support and ‚Äì when Hazel cannot give Jackson the pills ‚Äì Aaron takes the cup and gives it to Jackson. Jackson then dies and Aaron runs through the village. He then tells Adam about Jackson's death and his part in it. The police investigate Jackson's death and arrest Aaron for murder. Aaron is forced to miss the funeral as he is due in court. He is released on bail and he goes to Jackson's grave to say goodbye. At his trial, Aaron is found not guilty of murder. However, Aaron blames himself for Jackson's death and starts lashing out at people. Aaron breaks into Carl's house with the intention of getting arrested, but Carl does not press charges. Aaron moves into The Woolpack with Chas and begins self-harming. During a drive Aaron starts speeding and crashes the car, Chas suffers minor injuries. When Sean Spencer (Luke Roskell) steals money from the garage Aaron chases after him then collapses. When he recovers Chas tries to get him to open up to her about his problems, later she catches Aaron self-harming and he starts attending counselling sessions. He also takes a break from the village for a while. Aaron meets Ed Roberts (Lloyd Everitt) when he brings a minibus to the garage to be fixed and they slowly begin a relationship. Ed tells Aaron that he has been signed for a French rugby club and is leaving for France in four weeks. He asks Aaron to come with him but he turns him down. Aaron later spots a fire in the garage and helps Adam save Cain, who had become trapped. Aaron then learns Adam deliberately started the fire and, not wanting his friend to be sent to prison, tells the police that he was responsible for the fire. He is released on bail but on the day of his court hearing, Aaron goes to France with Ed. 2014‚Äì Aaron returns to stop Adam participating in a robbery with Ross Barton (Michael Parr) and Donna Windsor (Verity Rushworth). After the robbery and Donna's subsequent death, Adam confesses to the garage arson, so Aaron can come home. However, Aaron is arrested for perverting the course of justice but returns to the village after receiving a suspended sentence. He moves into The Woolpack with Chas, her boyfriend, James Barton (Bill Ward), and Diane Sugden (Elizabeth Estensen). Aaron then has a one-night stand with Finn Barton (Joe Gill), James' son. Aaron resumes working at Debbie's garage where he gets caught up in a car scam with Ross and Charity Dingle (Emma Atkins). A few weeks later Robert Sugden (Ryan Hawley) asks Aaron to fix his car and the pair kiss and they have sex, starting an affair. Katie Sugden (Sammy Winward) suspects that Robert is cheating on his fianc√©e, Chrissie White (Louise Marwood) and sets about trying to prove it. Aaron seduces Robert into a kiss and Katie photographs it. Aaron leaves making Robert alone with Katie. Robert pushes Katie leading to her death. Robert calls Aaron for help, and they get rid of any evidence. Aaron begins self-harming to cope with his guilt. Aaron tells Chrissie the truth about his affair with Robert. Robert is shot, sending him into a coma. Adam and Victoria accidentally film Aaron concealing the gun in a car at the scrapyard. Adam confronts Aaron, who admits hiding it to protect his mother because he believed she was guilty. Rakesh Kotecha (Pasha Bocarie) reports it to the police and Aaron is arrested and charged with possession of a firearm and attempted murder. Already having a suspended sentence, he is immediately remanded in custody. Aaron pleads not guilty and Robert tries to goad Aaron into telling the truth. Aaron angrily shouts that he should have done everyone a favour and died. After discovering Andy's involvement in his shooting, Robert makes a false statement to get Aaron released. Aaron's father, Gordon (Gary Mavers), visits the village. Aaron becomes upset and starts self harming. Aaron admits to Robert that Gordon raped him when he was a child. Aaron confronts Gordon about the past, and Gordon leaves. Aaron later tells Chas about Gordon's abuse. Aaron refuses to report Gordon to the police, so Chas confronts Gordon, who admits he abused Aaron. Chas tells Aaron that Gordon admitted to abusing him. Chas then tells Cain, who goes to Gordon's home to get revenge. When Aaron learns of this he stops Cain by agreeing to go to the police. Gordon is brought in for questioning, maintaining his innocence and branding his son a liar. Gordon also informs the police of Cain's actions against him. Gordon then turns up at the scrapyard to bully Aaron into retracting his statement, he tries to bargain Cain's freedom against Aaron's case. Robert helps Aaron track down his stepmother, Sandra (Joanne Mitchell) and his younger half-sister, Liv Flaherty (Isobel Steele). Aaron pleads for Sandra's help, but she is adamant that she knows nothing. When Sandra says she changed her surname to keep Liv safe, Aaron works out that she knows what happened. He tells Liv what kind of person their father is and returns home. A second person had come forward to say Gordon abused him. The police inform Aaron that, because of the second statement, they are pressing charges against Gordon. Aaron later spots Robert and Ryan Harred (George Sampson) together and learns Robert paid Ryan to give a false statement. Aaron asks Ryan to retract his statement and he agrees. Liv is convinced Aaron is lying about their dad abusing him. Chas convinces Sandra to give a statement to the police and Liv comes to stay with Aaron for a while. Gordon is found guilty and Liv moves into The Woolpack, after she refuses to move to Dublin with Sandra. Gordon is sentenced to 18 years in prison. Aaron changes his surname to Dingle. Gordon later takes his own life in prison. Aaron, Liv, Robert and Chas attend Gordon's funeral. Aaron finally vents his anger at his father and promises to take care of Liv. Aaron meets Chrissie's sister Rebecca White (Emily Head) and learns that Robert had had an affair with her while dating Chrissie in the past. Aaron overhears Chrissie's teenage son, Lachlan White (Thomas Atkinson), threatening to make false allegations of sexual abuse against Robert and warns him to stay away. Robert calms Aaron down and they later meet at a barn, where Aaron shows Robert that he has Lachlan tied up in the boot of his car. Lachlan escapes and they are forced to give chase and stop him falling over the edge of a cliff. Lachlan almost forces Aaron over until Robert pulls him off. Lachlan tells Aaron that Robert is having an affair with Rebecca. With Lachlan back in the boot, Aaron and Robert talk and Robert admits he is bisexual. While driving back to the village, Robert produces a ring and tells Aaron he was going to propose. Aaron takes his eyes off the road, but Robert yells at Aaron to watch out and he loses control of the car trying to avoid a pile-up on the road and they crash into a water-filled quarry. Aaron later accepts Robert's proposal and goes on to recover from his injuries. Robert continues to spend time with Rebecca, to help find evidence against the Whites and help Andy, who is on the run after being framed by Chrissie for attempting to murder Lawrence White (John Bowe), when in actuality Andy was framed by Chrissie in order to protect the true culprit, her son Lachlan. Aaron tries to remain calm about it, but becomes envious over the amount of time the two of them are spending together and is distrustful of Rebecca. After learning that The Mill is up for auction, Liv offers to use some of her inheritance to help buy it, but Aaron refuses to use Gordon's money. Aaron breaks into Home Farm and empties the safe. Rebecca confronts Aaron at the pub, threatening to call the police. When she asks why Aaron would choose to steal from her, Aaron tells her about Gordon's abuse. Aaron returns the money and he purchases The Mill for himself, Robert and Liv. Aaron ( played by Bryan Parry, in Ashley's vision) finds a confused Ashley wandering around the streets of Hotten and offers to bring him back to the village. He takes him to The Woolpack and is saddened to see the former vicar's rapid decline as his dementia takes hold. Aaron then encourages Chas and Paddy to get back together. Aaron struggles to hide his jealousy when Robert spends most of his time working on a business plan for Rebecca. Aaron and Robert decide to have a secret wedding in Vegas. However, they argue over the lack of trust in the relationship and Robert removes his engagement ring. Aaron gets drunk and beats Kasim when he sees a disagreement between him and Finn that Aaron interprets as a homophobic attack against Finn. Aaron is arrested and Robert promises to stand by him. Aaron apologises to Finn for attacking Kasim. Finn tells him he deserves to go to prison, but hopes he does not. Aaron meets his estranged grandmother, Faith Dingle (Sally Dexter), and instantly takes a shine to her, despite Chas' disapproval. Liv is disappointed that no one has remembered her birthday and lashes out at Aaron and Chas. Aaron finds her drowning her sorrows at the bridge and carries her home. Aaron gives Liv some belated birthday presents but she gets upset about the thought of him going to prison, causing Aaron to snap at her. He goes out for a run and Faith finds him suffering from a panic attack. With the help of their families, Robert surprises Aaron with an impromptu wedding ceremony in the Woolpack. Just as the service gets underway, the police turn up looking for Faith. Upset, Robert walks off and Aaron follows him to the garage, where Robert laments that he wanted this day to be perfect, but Aaron assures him it does not matter and produces the rings. They exchange their vows in private before heading back to the pub where they celebrate with their family and friends. Aaron apologises to Robert for having to leave him. Robert assures Aaron that he will wait for him. Aaron is given 12 months in prison. He immediately begins to struggle with the situation. After seeking the advice of one of the guards, Aaron decides to hide his sexuality for his own protection, but instinctively shouts at the prison bully Jason when he sees him abusing a fellow gay inmate. When confronted by his cellmate Ethan, Aaron claims to have a gay brother in order to cover his tracks. Robert visits Aaron in prison where the pair struggle to hide their emotions. Jason spies Robert gently squeezing Aaron's leg under the table and works out Aaron's sexuality, later confronting him in his cell. Aaron squares up to Jason and calls the thug out on his bigotry. Hearing the guards approaching, Jason and his mates leave but not before threatening Aaron. The next day, Chas visits Aaron and she is dismayed to learn that the inmates are aware of his sexuality after he is openly hassled in the visiting room by Jason though he tries to play it down in front of her. Instinctively, Chas lashes out and tries to warn Jason off. Later, Aaron is cornered by Jason and his mates; the guards manage to pull them apart in time but Aaron is left shaken and afraid by the encounter. The following day, Aaron is unsettled when a fellow inmate recognises him and calls him \\"Livesy\\" in front of Jason. Robert visits Aaron again and apologises to him after learning from Chas what happened after the last time he visited. Aaron assures him he's fine but keeps getting more nervous as Jason is watching them. Later, Aaron is shocked when Jason reveals he knew Gordon and confesses that he was the one who got him to kill himself before launching a vicious attack. Battered and bruised, Aaron rings Chas and tells her to see Sarah in Prague, assuring his mum he's ok but after Jason stops by to warn him its only the beginning, he crumples the floor and suffers a severe panic attack. The next morning, Ethan offers Aaron a joint of spice to help with the pain but Aaron refuses, saying his 6 pm phonecall to Liv and Robert will get him through the day. Aaron is soon cornered by Jason and his mates; they bundle him into a cell and he tries to stand up to them but quickly falls apart when Jason tells him it's the cell where Gordon took his own life. Holding him down, Jason continues to taunt Aaron about his past and tells him he will not kill him as he is already dead inside. Aaron is later found in a near-catatonic state by the prison chaplain, Fr Aiden who delivers some tough love, saying Aaron needs to open up to the people he cares about or end up like Jason. Aaron later makes his phonecall to Liv and Robert but is unable to confide in them. That night in his cell, Aaron gives into temptation and asks Ethan for some spice. The next morning, Aaron asks Ethan for more Spice but his cellmate tells him the only person he can get it off is Jason. Aaron goes to see Jason and is told he can have the drugs if he agrees to do some jobs for him. Aaron is later visited by Liv and Paddy. While Paddy gives them some time alone, Liv immediately senses something is amiss and is shocked to discover her brother is on drugs. Aaron is taken aback by her perceptiveness and begs her not to tell Robert. Liv abruptly asks Paddy to take her home, leaving Aaron crushed. Later, Aaron goes to see Jason again and agrees to deliver drugs to other inmates for him; Ethan warns Aaron if he gets caught, he'll risk his appeal. Robert comes to visit Aaron again and tells him he knows about the drugs, having learnt the truth from Liv. Aaron is gutted about being found out and Robert is dismayed by Aaron's indifference, both towards the drugs and Liv's recent expulsion from school, causing Aaron to get defensive and orders Robert to leave him alone. A few days later, Robert and Chas visit to tell Aaron his appeal has been successful and he'll be released in a few weeks. Aaron apologises to Robert for the things he said last time he visited and promises he's off the drugs for good. A few weeks later, Aaron is released and shares an emotional reunion with Robert outside the prison gates. They arrive back at the village where Faith has organised a coming home party. Aaron is soon overwhelmed by it all and after speaking briefly with Rebecca, he rushes outside where he has a panic attack. Robert tries to comfort him but Aaron suddenly turns around and punches him in the face. Horrified by his actions, he quickly apologises before breaking down and admits to Robert what he went through in prison, including being beaten and locked in Gordon's cell. Robert gently assures his Aaron he'll get through this and promises to get him help for his problems. When Aaron stresses about not being able to support Liv, Robert takes him for a picnic in order to take his mind off things. They have a great time together and Robert tells Aaron he's proud of him. On their way back to the village they are shocked to overhear Rebecca is pregnant. The next day, Aaron attends his first counselling session and with Robert's encouragement finds himself finally able to open up about his problems and admitting that he wants to change. Robert suggests to Aaron that they visit Chas and Liv for a few weeks and after getting the all clear from his probation officer, they leave the village. After Robert and Aaron return from their break and move into the Mill, Robert breaks down and confesses that he slept with Rebecca, she got pregnant as a result and he told her to have an abortion. Devastated, Aaron orders Robert to leave and nearly self-harms before seeing his counselor. He tells Robert that he wants to forgive him and move on and Robert eagerly agrees. They are upset to learn the next day that Rebecca is still pregnant. Though Aaron feels that the baby will always be a reminder of Robert's infidelity and Rebecca tries convincing him to leave Robert, Aaron decides to stand with Robert and convinces him to take an active role in the baby's life. Despite his best efforts, Aaron is unable to cope with Rebecca's pregnancy. He self-harms and attempts to buy drugs off of his ex-cellmate, leading to an encounter with Jason. He confesses to Robert that he hates the baby. Robert suggests that he and Aaron leave the village for good but Aaron breaks up with him, realizing that he's become paranoid and needy around Robert, and chooses to focus on his mental and emotional health. He leaves the village to visit Chas and Liv for a short time. Robert tries to reconcile with him upon his return but Aaron is adamant that they stay split up. Zak begins training him in boxing and after a run-in with Jason, stands up to him. When Liv returns after looking after her mother, Aaron tries to hide the details about his breakup with Robert, but eventually tells her. Liv attempts to convince Robert to fight for Aaron, but when he is rude to her in front of Rebecca, she steals his car and a bottle of spiked rum from Home Farm. Liv passes out from the drugged alcohol and is taken to the hospital. After Robert admits what he's done with the bottle to Aaron, Aaron promises to end him if Liv does not survive. Liv recovers and plays matchmaker between Aaron and her doctor Alex Mason. Aaron is interested but decides that he is not ready to move on yet. Liv's friend Gerry moves in with them after being kicked out of the B&B; by Doug. Aaron reluctantly helps drive Rebecca to the hospital when she goes into labor. After his son is born, Robert makes plans to leave the village, believing that the baby is better off without him. He confesses his schemes against the Whites to Aaron, admitting that he blamed them for his and Aaron's breakup. Aaron convinces Robert to stay and be a better man and a decent father. Robert abandons his plotting, but incurs the wrath of the Whites when Rebecca discovers the truth and reveals it all. An angry and humiliated Lawrence beats up Robert, who seeks Aaron for help. Liv fears that Aaron and Robert will get back together, so she continues to push Dr. Alex Mason on Aaron. Aaron and Alex soon start dating. His family reacts positively to Alex but Aaron is hesitant about the relationship. At Christmas, a drunk and depressed Robert makes a public plea to get Aaron to come back to him, but insults Alex and embarrasses himself and Aaron in the process. Later, Robert is hit by the Whites' car and taken to the hospital. Aaron is frightened that Robert will die and admits that he is not ready to lose him. Robert survives and while he recovers, he decides to let Aaron move on and agrees to do the same. Aaron tells Alex that he is committed to them. In early 2018, Aaron, Cain, and Robert work together to help Adam flee the country after he confessed to the murder of Emma Barton in order to protect the culprit, his mother Moira. After the Whites are involved in a car crash, Robert takes over full-time parenting duties while Rebecca is in the hospital. Aaron starts helping Robert with childcare and takes a liking to baby Sebastian. Alex becomes envious of the time that Aaron and Robert are spending together. Aaron tries to cook dinner for him and Alex and calls Robert for help. The two end up having dinner together and nearly kiss, but are stopped by Alex's arrival. Aaron comforts Liv over her sexuality after Gabby humiliates her at her sixteenth birthday party and advises her not to rush to label herself. By now, Aaron has become less invested in his relationship with Alex. He plans to break up with him, but when he learns of Alex's troubles at work and at home, he reluctantly suggests that he move into the Mill. After Valentine's Day, Aaron is at a bar and sees Robert chatting up another man. Heartsick, Aaron breaks up with Alex and leaves the bar. He and Robert find each other that night and, after tearful confessions, are finally reunited. After Rebecca is released from the hospital, she, Robert, and Aaron begin co- parenting baby Seb. Rebecca's memory problems put Seb at risk, so he moves in with Robert and Aaron full-time while she heals. They, along with Cain and Moira, are forced to deal with Syd - the prisoner collaterally involved in Adam's escape - when he invades the Mill and later kidnaps Aaron in exchange for ‚Ç¨10,000. Robert resorts to making a deal with Joe Tate (Ned Porteous) to get the money. At the pub, Chas and Paddy reveal that she is pregnant, and Aaron, though surprised, is happy for them. Liv and Gabby accidentally spike Lisa's drink with ketamine meant for Daz, causing her to go to the hospital. When Aaron discovers Liv's part in it, he advises her to keep quiet, but she confesses when Gabby is questioned by the police. Liv is later arrested and sent to juvenile detention for several months due to Joe Tate's interference. Aaron calls Liv in prison to inform her that Gerry has died. He is distraught to learn about Liv's drinking problem, but does his best to get her help. He also helps support his mother and Paddy when they learn that their unborn baby has bilateral renal agenesis and will not survive birth. Over the summer, Aaron and Robert get engaged again. Rebecca goes missing and when Lachlan's murder spree is revealed, Robert worries about her. Aaron worries that the stress of it is getting to him and tells Robert to take it easy and focus on Sebastian but Robert is determined to find Rebecca because he cannot handle his son growing up without his mother just like he did but the stress becomes to much for Robert and he has a seizure. Over the few months Lachlan has Rebecca kidnapped, Robert and Aaron start to lose hope of her return and Robert then asks Aaron if Rebecca does not come back he could adopt Sebastian which Aaron is more than happy about, but the adoption does not go ahead as Rebecca eventually escapes Lachlan and returns home. Chas goes into labour during Aaron and Robert's bachelor party, and gives birth to a daughter named Grace, who lives for only a short time after birth. During this time Aaron and Robert get married legally in the village. After Lachlan is put in prison, Rebecca gets back together with Ross and they decide to move to Liverpool with their sons for a fresh start. Aaron and Robert try to fight it, leading to a custody battle, which ends with Robert giving Rebecca his blessing to take Seb. Aaron has grown attached to Seb and has trouble letting go, but he and Robert start making plans to have a child of their own. They decide on surrogacy as the best option, though they struggle on how to pay for it. However, in the spring of 2019, the surrogacy is put on hold when Robert's sister Victoria is raped at a party by Lee Posner (Kris Mochrie) and Aaron and Robert put their energy into supporting her. Victoria's case is dismissed due to lack of evidence. Aaron and Robert get revenge on Lee by putting up posters of him with the words \\"RAPIST\\" around his workplace, sparking a feud between them and Lee and his mother, Wendy (Susan Cookson). Lee and Wendy harass Victoria when they learn of her pregnancy and state that they intend to file for custody. Robert becomes more and more fueled by his hatred for Lee, leading him to take drastic measures such as hiring Dawn Taylor to trap Lee. Eventually, Lee admits to Robert that he raped Victoria, and Robert bludgeons him with a shovel, putting him in coma. Robert is charged with GBH with intent facing a life sentence. Aaron is devastated to learn that Robert might spend life in prison. When Lee dies from an internal bleeding on the brain, it becomes a murder case. Liv insists Robert goes on the run and Aaron goes too. They both refuse this but Liv tells them it's their only option as they cannot be without each other. Aaron agrees and tells Robert he is not going anywhere without him. Aaron and Robert pack and say their goodbyes to Liv and Victoria and when Aaron goes to see Paddy and a heavily pregnant Chas, Robert says his goodbyes to Sebastian and tells him he loves him. Robert and Aaron tell Paddy and Chas everything and Chas refuses for him to leave before giving him the ultimatum of choosing between Robert and his family, to which Aaron chooses Robert and says he cannot live without him, and then they go on the run. Aaron and Robert are at a small hotel where they are hiding and planning their escape to France by ferry and are using fake passports which they got from Mandy Dingle who accidentally smuggled Liv into the back of the van and Liv tells them she is coming too, she tells Aaron that they cannot live without each other and she cannot live with out him and then says she cannot live with out either of them as they are a family, Aaron and Robert do not think it's a good idea for a 17-year-old to be living her life on the run and they all have an emotional goodbye and Paddy and Chas then follow the boys to pick up Liv after they got the truth from Mandy about where Liv is, just as Liv arrives back to Paddy and Chas the police stop them after following them from the village they make up a story about where they are going and tells the police they are on the way to the hospital as her waters have broke but the police find the address of where Aaron and Robert are on their GPS and head that way just as Liv arrives to the car. Aaron and Robert hear the sirens and run for it where they hide in a forest nearby they sit against a tree and Aaron rings Chas so they can get some money and just before he goes to see her, Robert asks Aaron to give chas his watch to give to Sebastian and then discuss their future, they talk about how proud Seb will be of Robert for sacrificing so much for the people he loves and they talk about growing old together and make a few jokes before sharing a kiss, saying they are in this together and Robert says to Aaron that he does not care where he is in his life as long as he can live it with Aaron, he says to Aaron that he promised to give Aaron the best life and that's what he's going to get and Aaron says he will wait before sharing another kiss and a long hug, but Aaron does not realise Robert is saying goodbye to him and he is about to make the most ultimate sacrifice for him. Aaron meets Liv, Paddy and Chas who he gives the watch to during their conversation however, the police drive past and Aaron realises they are heading towards where Robert is and Aaron then runs back while Liv, chas and Paddy all chase after him when he comes to the opposite side of the road where the hotel is he sees the police arresting him, Aaron is hysterical and tries to get to him as Paddy and Liv pull him back to stop him from getting hit by an up-and-coming van he is still hysterical and can see Robert looking towards him in devastation, Aaron questions what he's doing and Chas tells him he turned himself in to which Aaron questions again before she says he did it for him, he starts shouting for Robert and screams that they were meant to do this together before questioning what he's going to do without him. The next day, Aaron is struggling to cope without Robert and cannot understand why Robert left him and chas tells him he did it so Aaron can have his freedom and he says he does not know what he will do without him. Aaron goes down to the police station and tells the police that he's not going to leave until he sees Robert, but it does not work but later on he gets a call from Robert after one of the police officers tell Robert his husband was asking for him and allowed Robert to call him even though the police officer was not allowed to, on the phone Robert explains why he did it and tells him he loves him and he always will but his family need him, when Aaron finds out Robert has a trial the week after he arranges with Billy the guy from prison to help break Robert out of prison so they can go ahead with their plan but Billy refuses and leaves. Paddy finds out about Aaron's plan through Billy and Paddy tells Liv to get Aaron to come back to the mill anyway she can, Aaron runs to the mill as Liv tells Aaron that Paddy is having a heart attack but he finds out it's a trap and Paddy locks all three of them in the mill and throws the keys in the plug holes to stop Aaron from going ahead with his plan. Aaron starts to become angry telling paddy to move and let him out and Paddy asks Aaron if he is going to hit him if he does not and Liv finds out about the time Aaron hit Paddy before, he tells Paddy that if he loved him he will let him out and he can be without Robert, Aaron then nearly hits Paddy before Liv pushes him away and asks Aaron if he is going to hit her, when they have all calmed down Liv breaks down in tears and she does not think Aaron cares about her as he was planning on leaving and still is without Liv and reminds Aaron she is his little sister and she needs him, Aaron then promises Liv he will not leave. They all eventually get rescued from the mill with a spare key hidden under a plant pot that Lydia hart opened for them after she went to tell them that Chas has gone into labour and is giving birth in the men's toilet that she is currently trapped in alongside Marlon Dingle, they all run to the pub and eventually Paddy manages to see his son being born, after the birth they discover the baby is actually a girl and Aaron's new little sister, they call her Eve Theodore Dingle and then shortened her name to Eve Teddy Dingle. The trial then approaches and Aaron is worried about it even though he knows Robert is going to plead guilty anyway. To make it worse Wendy turns up along with Lee's brother, Luke, who Victoria happens to know and is shocked to discover Lee's brother is the same guy she was chatting up and thought it was all a plan but He said he had no idea it was her and his mother said she was clueless. Robert then arrives on stand and he takes a glance at Aaron, he pleads guilty to murder and is sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum of 14 years without parole, Aaron, Liv and Victoria are shocked he does not get parole as Robert is being sent down he looks at Aaron who looks back and he whispers to Aaron that he loves him. Outside the courts, Lee's mother is angry that Robert only got 14 years but Liv reminds her it's life but she says it's 14 years and will get out eventually and he deserves to never come out and Aaron gets angry at her over it. After Aaron sees his newborn sister, he sits at home and watches a video Robert recorded for him and the rest of his family saying goodbye, he tells Aaron he might never have to see the video because they have their lives together but if it does not go to plan, he wanted Aaron to know he loves him and he will love him forever and Aaron breaks down in tears. Robert is later transferred to a prison on the Isle of Wight. He removes Aaron from his prisoner contact list and files for divorce, presumably in an attempt to force Aaron to move on with his life. Aaron takes the news very poorly. He tries to focus on being a stepfather to Seb, but Rebecca later asks that he stop seeing him. Wendy insists on moving into the village to be close to her grandchild and Luke joins her. Though Wendy soon endears herself to Paddy and Chas by helping their baby with feeding, Aaron and Victoria are furious at her presence and plot to get her to leave. Aaron and Luke come to blows on several occasions, and he stalks and harasses Wendy to get her to leave. He also starts going on dating apps and having one-night stands with random men. Victoria and Liv catch one of his hookups trying to steal from him and he snaps at them for interfering. He later apologises, admitting how much it hurts after losing Robert, and takes a break from the village. Aaron later returns and is reunited with his half-sister Liv Flaherty, mother Chas Dingle and adoptive father Paddy Kirk. He becomes a godfather to his half-sister \\"Eve Dingle\\". Casting Jake Roche auditioned for the role of Aaron, however, it was actor Danny Webb who was eventually cast. Aaron first appeared in Emmerdale in 2003 as a recurring character. In 2008, Aaron was reintroduced as a full-time cast member and the decision was made to recast the part. Former Grange Hill actor Danny Miller successfully auditioned for the role of Aaron. Miller admitted in an interview with Sue Crawford of The People that he would have quit acting for good if he had not landed the role. On 20 December 2016, Aaron was temporarily played by actor Bryan Parry in a special episode focusing on the viewpoint of dementia patient Ashley Thomas (John Middleton). Development Characterisation Violent, angry and always in trouble, the character quickly established himself as the 'baddest' of bad boys. Describing Aaron, Lucy Pargeter (Chas Dingle) said \\"Aaron's an absolute pain in the arse for Chas. Danny Miller, who plays him, is brilliant. He gives so much and he's only young\\". Sexuality A high-profile storyline for the character was when he began to question his sexual orientation. As the storyline progressed, Aaron was seen struggling to come to terms with his sexuality, before admitting the truth to his friend and guardian Paddy Kirk (Dominic Brunt). Miller admits that he was apprehensive when the Emmerdale writers approached him and told him they were making Aaron gay. Miller said \\"Being a straight actor and having to kiss another lad, I'm not going to lie, I was a bit worried about it, because it's a great test of your acting skills.\\" Miller's co-star, Dominic Brunt has praised the storyline and told Media and Entertainment website, Digital Spy, that \\"It's done more realistically than I've seen in a soap.\\" He went on to describe Aaron as being a homophobic homosexual, who doesn't like what he is. Miller has stated that he is enjoying the challenge presented by the storyline saying \\"It's definitely been a big challenge ‚Äì I feel a big responsibility to get this right and portray it in a way that makes it real, because there are so many lads who are going through what Aaron is going through\\". Miller's co-star James Sutton, who previously played a gay character in Hollyoaks, has said that Miller did not need any advice for the role and said, \\"We've chatted but I've given him no advice ‚Äì he's a great actor, he doesn't need me to give him any pointers\\". Emmerdale producer Gavin Blyth explained the gay plotline to Miller saying, \\"There are hundreds of thousands of teenage lads out there who are struggling with it as we speak ‚Äì they're sexually confused\\". He also added \\"Aaron keeps it in so much because he's worried about what people think of him\\". Miller has admitted that he felt \\"awkward\\" and \\"strange\\" when he filmed an intimate moment with his Emmerdale co-star Adam Thomas, who is his real-life flatmate. He said \\"You'd never think yourself to be in the position that these two are in. Knowing myself and knowing Adam and his long-term girlfriend, he's the last person you'd expect in that position.\\" Departure (2012) On 18 November 2011, Miller announced he would be leaving Emmerdale in 2012. Of his decision to leave, Miller said \\"It has been an incredibly difficult decision but after three years playing Aaron and much soul-searching, I am eager to explore other roles. I am so grateful to Emmerdale for the opportunity that I have been given and have loved every moment. I will miss everyone enormously but this might not be the last we see of Aaron.\\" Series producer Stuart Blackburn said he respected Miller's decision and was grateful for the hard work he had put into the role of Aaron. On 20 January 2012, Miller revealed the Emmerdale team were still discussing how to write out Aaron. The actor said \\"They keep chopping and changing [it] ‚Äì I think because they want to make it quite impactful and dramatic. I hope it's not leaving in the back of a cab, but there's great storyliners and a great team there.\\" In February 2012, Susan Hill of the Daily Star reported Aaron would exit the village in \\"heartbreaking scenes\\" after turning down the chance to leave with his new man, Ed Roberts (Lloyd Everitt). Hill said the show's bosses were desperate to get the character's departure right and spent months coming up with a dramatic storyline. Details of what happens to stop Aaron having a happy ending were being kept under wraps. The following month, Miller and other members of the cast and crew were spotted filming Aaron's final scenes at Robin Hood Airport. Paul Millar of Digital Spy reported that Aaron's final scenes could see him on the run from the police after being accused of setting fire to the garage. Aaron made his last screen appearance on 5 April 2012. In honour of his departure, the cast and crew made a parody video for the song \\"Written in the Stars\\" by Tinie Tempah. Reintroduction (2014) On 4 April 2014, Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy reported that Miller would be returning to Emmerdale. Kilkelly said that while producers had yet to officially announce the news, a show insider had confirmed Miller's return. Aaron will make his on-screen return later in the year. Aaron returned on 14 August 2014 to help Adam out of a scam that he was involved with Ross Barton and Donna Windsor. Child sexual abuse On 21 January 2016, a new story arc for Aaron began when he revealed to his ex-lover Robert Sugden that he was raped by his father, Gordon, when he was a child. Aaron explained to Robert that Gordon repeatedly raped him throughout his childhood from the age of 8 before Gordon kicked him out. Two weeks later on 3 February 2016, Aaron tells his mother Chas what Gordon did to him. After the emotional episode aired, Miller was overwhelmed by the response to his child abuse storyline with fans and co- stars praising his performance on Twitter. On 16 February 2016, it was announced that a new character would become involved in the storyline with Aaron; newcomer Ryan Harred (played by George Sampson), and a second abuse victim, who would later be revealed to be male, would come forward. A week later, it's revealed that Robert paid Ryan to lie about being abused by Gordon in order for the police to charge him. On 15 April 2016, the jury found Gordon guilty of raping Aaron. Car crash stunt In May 2016, new Emmerdale producer Iain Macleod reveals Aaron will be heavily involved in the big October storyline along with Robert. Aaron and Robert will be caught in explosive and heartstopping twists. Iain says, \\"It's a massive, big storyline for Robron. It's funny, romantic and heartstopping in places. People will be on the edge of their seat ‚Äì or possibly falling off the end of it. I think viewers want us to keep them together and they have earned the right to be together for a period. Obviously, there will be challenges, but I‚Äôm really rooting for them, I hope that they can make it through!\\" Reception For his portrayal of Aaron, Miller was nominated for the \\"Best Newcomer Award\\" at the Inside Soap Awards in 2009. Miller won the \\"Best Actor\\" award at the 2011 British Soap Awards, he was also nominated for \\"Sexiest Male\\".

On 6 November 2017, Miller won the accolade for \\"Best Actor\\". Aaron's pairing with Robert won the accolade for \\"Best Soap Couple\\" at the 2018 Digital Spy Reader Awards. A writer for Holy Soap said Aaron's most memorable moment was \\"His realisation about his sexuality and the emotional scenes where he told Paddy the truth.\\" Miller revealed that he had been verbally abused in public for portraying a bad boy and a homosexual. He stated some viewers initially found it difficult to differentiate between character and actor. Miller said, \\"I get the odd bit of trouble here and there but nothing that I can't handle. I get people shouting stuff, names in the street, but nothing serious.\\" He added, \\"There are people who think I'm the character but when they realise you're not they warm to you.\\" Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap said that \\"given the impact he's had on Emmerdale, Aaron's farewell was always going to be an emotional one.\\" The writer said that she and all of her colleagues from the publication will miss him. Ellis added that she would also \\"love\\" to watch Aaron in a spin-off series set in France. A reporter writing for the Inside Soap Yearbook 2017 named Aaron's \\"abuse agony\\" as one of the \\"best bits of February\\", describing viewers as being left \\"stunned\\" when he revealed he was abused by his father. They praised the scenes between Aaron and Chas at the seaside.

Until that time the primary anesthetic in use was cocaine, however its undesirable side effects (including toxicity and addiction) led scientists to seek out newer anesthetic drugs. Novocain was found to be comparatively safe and effective, although its anesthetic effects were weaker than cocaine and some patients proved highly allergic. However, none of the other anesthetics developed during this period proved more effective and Novocain quickly became the standard local anesthesia. Although its use has largely been replaced by lidocaine, it is still in use today, most frequently in dentistry. Life Einhorn was born in Hamburg, and due to the death of his parents his education took place in Leipzig with his relatives. He studied chemistry at the University of Leipzig and later at the University of T√ºbingen where he received his Ph.D. for his work on ketones in 1878. He joined the group of Adolf von Baeyer at the University of Munich in 1882, left two times for his habilitation to the University of Darmstadt and to the University of Aachen, but came back to Munich permanently in 1891. He was professor at the University of Munich until his death in 1917.

It is currently the second largest church building in Georgia, after the Holy Trinity Cathedral.

Sketches of Georgian Church History Throughout the centuries, the cathedral served as the burial place for kings. The present cross-in-square structure was completed between 1010 and 1029 by the medieval Georgian architect Arsukisdze, although the site itself dates back to the early fourth century. The exterior archature of the cathedral is a well-preserved example of typical decorations of the 11th century.

History Early history Iberia (1880s), an icon by Mikhail Sabinin illustrating the legend of Living Pillar. The original church was built in 4th century A.D. during the reign of Mirian III of Kartli (Iberia). St. Nino is said to have chosen the confluence of the Mtkvari (Kura) and Aragvi rivers as the place of the first Georgian Church. According to Georgian hagiography, in the 1st century AD a Georgian Jew from Mtskheta named Elias was in Jerusalem when Jesus was crucified. Elias bought Jesus‚Äô robe from a Roman soldier at Golgotha and brought it back to Georgia. Returning to his native city, he was met by his sister Sidonia who upon touching the robe immediately died from the emotions engendered by the sacred object. The robe could not be removed from her grasp, so she was buried with it.Rosen, Roger. Georgia: A Sovereign Country of the Caucasus. Odyssey Publications: Hong Kong, 1999. The place where Sidonia is buried with Christ's robe is preserved in the Cathedral. Later, from her grave grew an enormous cedar tree. Ordering the cedar chopped down to build the church, St. Nino had seven columns made from it for the church's foundation. The seventh column, however, had supernatural properties and rose by itself into the air. It returned to earth after St. Nino prayed the whole night. It was further said that from the seventh column a sacred liquid flowed that cured people of all diseases. In Georgian sveti means \\"pillar\\" and tskhoveli means \\"life-giving\\" or \\"living\\", hence the name of the cathedral. An icon portraying this event can be seen on the third column on the left-hand from the entrance. Reproduced widely throughout Georgia, it shows Sidonia with an angel lifting the column in heaven. Saint Nino is in the foreground: King Mirian and his wife, Queen Nana, are to the right and left. Georgia officially adopted Christianity as its state religion in 337. ciborium under which the robe of Jesus is said to have been buried Medieval and modern  Svetitskhoveli Cathedral, originally built in the 4th century, has been damaged several times during history, notably by the invasions of Arabs, Persians and Timur, and latterly during Russian subjugation and the Soviet period. The building has also been damaged by earthquakes. The present Svetitskhoveli Cathedral was built between 1010 and 1029 by the architect Arsukidze, at the invitation of the Catholicos Melchizedek I of Georgia. The king of Georgia at that time was Giorgi I (George I). A notable reconstruction was carried out at the end of 14th century after it was destroyed by Tamerlan. The next large renovation came in the beginning of 15th, when the current dome was built, being subsequently renovated again in the middle of 17th century. During the restoration of 1970-71 which was presided over by Vakhtang Tsintsadze, the base of the basilica built in the late 5th century by King Vakhtang Gorgasali after St. Nino's original church was found. During the early years of Georgian church building, the basilica was the dominant type of the Georgian church architecture before the crossed-dome style emerged. The cathedral is surrounded by a defensive wall, built of stone and brick during the reign of King Erekle II (Heraclius) in 1787. In the beginning of 1830s the cathedral was visited by the Russian Emperor. In connection with this, the portal galleries, surrounding the church from the north, west and south, which had been in unsatisfactory condition, were demolished. Archaeological expeditions in 1963 found the 11th century house of the Patriarch at the southern part of the wall. Inside the church yard, the remains of the two-story palace of Patriarch Anton II were found. Architecture The plan of Svetitskhoveli Elevation from the side The cathedral is set on a flat lowland, amidst the old town of Mtskheta as its most significant construction, visible from nearly every spot. Elevation from the entrance The base of the three-storey basilica, supposed to have been built by Vakhtang Gorgasali after St.Nino's original church, was found by archaeologists during the restoration of 1970-71. Its remnants can be seen in the western and southeastern parts, as well as under the pillars below the floor. The remnants of an even older wooden church were found inside in the southern arm of the cross. The architecture of the present Svetitskhoveli Cathedral, which dates from around 1020, is based on the cross- dome style of church architecture, which emerged in Georgia in the early Middle Ages and became the principle style after the political unification of Georgia by Bagrat III (978-1014). The characteristic of this style is that the dome is placed across all four sides of church. There was originally a more harmonic three-step silhouette, with portals from the south, west and north. The northern and southern portals were demolished in the 1830s. The current entrance to the cathedral is from the west. The structure of the church is intended to ensure good acoustics. Large windows on the dome and walls give a significant amount of light. In its plan the church is a cross with shorter transverse and longer longitudinal arms. The east end has an apse. The dome of Svetitskhoveli was reconstructed several times over the centuries to keep the church in good condition. The current dome is from the 15th century with its upper part reconstructed in the 17th century, when it lost its original size and was reduced in height. The basic stone used for the Cathedral is a sandy yellow with trimmings, while around the apse window a red stone is used. The green stone used in the drum of the cupola is from the 17th century. The church facades are richly decorated. The curved blind arcading throughout is unaltered from the 11th century. The arches genuinely ascend or descend according to height of the corresponding part of the facade, creating an impression of constant movement.–ó–∞–∫–∞—Ä–∞—è, –ü.

(In Russian) Two high and deep niches of the eastern facade are in clear contrast with surrounding illuminated walls. Each window is surrounded by ornamental stripe and stylised peacock tail-like decorations. Similar decorations are found in the upper parts of the eastern niches. A writing above the windows of eastern facade tell that the church was built by katolikos Melchisedek. Above it, two low-reliefs, an eagle with open wings and a lion under it, are set to the south from the three more recent accessory windows under the roof. Eastern facade with niches, window and various decorations A large window occupies most of the western top side of the church. The decoration shows the Ascension of Jesus, with Christ sitting on the throne and two angels at the both sides. This triangle-shaped decoration fits harmoniously with triangle of the cornice and an arch below it. The original sculpture on the wall has not survived, but was restored several times, most recently in the 19th century. The architect Arsukidze A legend surrounds a relief sculpture on the external northern wall. This shows a right arm and hand holding a chisel - symbol of the stonemason ‚Äì with an inscription reads: An inscription on the east fa√ßade further attests to the fact that Arsukidze did not live to see his masterpiece finished (in 1029): Konstantine Gamsakhurdia's novel The Hand of the Great Master relates the legend, for which there is no documentary evidence, that a priest who had also been Arsukidze's patron and teacher was so jealous of Arsukidze's success that he used his influence with the king to have the architect's right hand cut off. According to the novel, King George was also jealous of Arsukidze over his lover, the beautiful Shorena. Icons and frescoes One of the frescoes of the Svetitskhoveli Cathedral The cathedral interior walls were once fully adorned with medieval frescoes, but many of them did not survive. In the 1830s, when Emperor Nicholas I was scheduled to visit Mskheta, Russian authorities razed the galleries and whitewashed timeless frescoes as part of an effort to give the cathedral a \\"tidier look\\"; in the end the Czar never even came. Today, after much careful restoration, some frescoes survive, including a 13th-century depiction of the \\"Beast of the Apocalypse\\" and figures of the Zodiac. The walls are decorated with many Christian Orthodox icons, most of which are not original (the originals being in the national museums of Georgia). The decoration of the church stonework also features carved grapes (as in many churches of Georgia), reflecting the country's ancient wine-making traditions. The large figure of Jesus at the altar was painted by Russian artist in the 19th century. The majority of the icons here date to the 20th century. Some are copies of older icons and frescoes from other churches throughout Georgia. Two bulls' heads on the east fa√ßade, remnants of the 5th-century church, attest to the folk influence on Christian iconography in that early period. Baptismal font On the right side from the entrance of the Cathedral is a stone baptismal font dating from the 4th century. It is thought to have been used for the baptism of King Mirian and Queen Nana. Immediately behind the font is a reproduction of the relief of Arsukidze's right hand and bevel found on the north facade. Symbolic copy of the Chapel of Holy Sepulchre A 14th-century copy of the aedicule of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre On the south side there is a small stone church built into the Cathedral. This is a symbolic copy of the Chapel of Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. Built between the end of the 13th and the beginning the 14th centuries, it was erected here to mark Svetitskhoveli as the second most sacred place in the world (after the church of Jerusalem), thanks to Christ's robe. In front of this stone chapel, the most westerly structure aligned with the columns between the aisle and the nave marks Sidonia's grave. Remains of the original life-giving pillar are also here. It was built in the 17th century. Scenes of the lives of King Mirian and Queen Nana, and portraits of the first Christian Byzantine Emperor, Constantine I, and his mother Helena, were painted by G. Gulzhavarashvili at that time. Traces of the foundations of the 4th-century church have been found here. Throne of Catholicos-Patriarch The second structure aligned with the columns of the southern aisle was also built in the 17th century as the throne of Catholicos Diasamidze. It no longer serves this function, as current tradition requires a throne for the Georgian patriarch to be in the centre of the church.

Ten are known to have been buried here, although only six tombs have been found, all before the altar. The tomb of King Vakhtang Gorgasali can be found in the central part of the cathedral and identified by the small candle fortress standing before it. King Erekle II's tomb is identifiable by the sword and shield upon it. His son, George XII was the last king of Georgia and his marble tomb is next to his father's. Also in front of the altar are tombs of David VI, George VIII, Luarsab I and various members of the Bagrationi royal family including Tamar, the first wife of George XI, whose epitaph dating from 1684 is written both in Georgian (Asomtavruli) and Arabic script.  Other burials  *Domentius IV of Georgia Other constructions Tower at the western entrance to the territory Bulls' heads on the west door of the wall surrounding the cathedral The cathedral stands in the middle of the large yard, surrounded by high walls with towers, dating back to 18th century. The top storie was designed for military purposes and has gun emplacements. The entrance to the Cathedral from the wall is located to the west. The wall has eight towers: six cylindrical and two square. The remnants of a palace and the 11th century two-stories tower above the gate are found in the southwestern part of the yard. The tower is faced by stones, with archature and two bull heads on the west facade, and has a passage with volt on the ground floor. A writing tells that the tower was built by katolikos Melchisedek.

(1981). A rhamphorhynchoid pterosaur from the Upper Jurassic of North America. Journal of Paleontology 55:1117‚Äì1122. In 1879 collector William Harlow Reed sent some fossil material he had dug up at Como Bluff in Quarry N¬∞ 9, or the \\"Mammal Quarry\\", to his employer Professor Othniel Charles Marsh at New Haven. Among it was the bone of a pterosaur, that was subsequently filed, stored and forgotten. However, in 1981 Peter Galton named, based on this bone, the genus Comodactylus. The type species is Comodactylus ostromi. The genus name is derived from Como Bluff and Greek daktylos, \\"finger\\", referring to the wing finger typical of pterosaurs. The specific name honours John Ostrom. The holotype is YPM 9150, consisting of an intact fourth metacarpal, . The metacarpal is quite robust with especially the proximal end, that touching the wrist bones, being very expanded. Such proportions are typical for basal pterosaurs, so Comodactylus was not a member of the, advanced, Pterodactyloidea. To what other pterosaur group it did belong has, however, proven difficult to determine, due to a lack of information. The metacarpal is the only known part of the animal. Kevin Padian in 1989 considered it a nomen dubium. David Unwin in 1993 suggested an affinity with Nesodactylus. The wingspan has been estimated at 2.5 meters (8.2 ft), exceptionally large for a pterosaur not belonging to the Pterodactyloidea. Comodactylus was also the first pterosaur outside of that group that was found in the Americas.

It is situated in the northern Black Forest, 15 km east of Baden- Baden, and 22 km southwest of Pforzheim. The town is connected to the city of Karlsruhe by the Albtalbahn, an electric railway that forms part of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn. Bad Herrenalb is the terminus of one of the branches of the Albtalbahn, which operates as line S1. History The town grew up around Alba Dominorum, a Cistercian monastery founded in 1148. The monastery was later dissolved during the Reformation. As early as 1841 Dr. J. Weiss established a cold water sanitarium which was later transformed into a water therapy institute with a sanitarium for nervous disorders. The sanitarium was further developed under the leadership of Councilor Dr. Mermagen. Since 1954 Herrenalb is officially known as a ‚Äúhealth resort.‚Äù In 1971 a 600 meter deep well was drilled into a mineral rich water source.

The spiders is generally dark colored. On the flattened carapace, there is a central whitish band, which is much larger in the female. On the opisthosoma there are four to five transverse, yellowish bands, and a light area near the spinnerets. The long, thin legs are suited for their stealthy, non-jumping movements. The genitals are very similar to those of Cyrba, and P. wanlessi seems to have separated from it mainly due to its lifestyle. Name The genus name is a combination of the Ancient Greek para \\"near to\\" and the name of the related genus Cyrba. The species is named in honor of Fred R.

Positive decalage results in greater lift from the upper wing than the lower wing, the difference increasing with the amount of decalage.NACA technical report No.269 The Distribution of Loads Between the Wings of a Biplane Having Decalage (November 1927), p.18.

A notable exception is the Stearman PT-17, which has 4¬∞ of incidence in the lower wing, and 3¬∞ in the upper wing. Considered from an aerodynamic perspective, it is desirable to have the forward-most wing stall first, which will induce a pitch-down moment, aiding in stall recovery.Appendix C1 to \\"General Aviation Aircraft Design\\" by Snorri Gudmundson; section C1.2, p.9 Biplane designers may use incidence to control stalling behavior, but may also use airfoil selection or other means to accomplish correct behavior.

The prison was managed by the Scottish Prison Service. Known as one of the most overcrowded prisons in Scotland, it had a design capacity of 155 and was contracted to hold up to 230 prisoners. However, on the first day of an inspection in January 2009 it held 264 prisoners. In 2014, it was closed in favour of the new HMP Grampian. In its latter years it saw an increase in inmates from outside the Grampian Sheriffdom, mainly from Wolverhampton and London. The diverse population led to many internal feuds and disputes. It ran exceptional drug rehabilitation programmes and was a pioneer for drug projects such as drug use kits etc. The management also wished to pilot a needle exchange programme. In August 2007 Aberdeen Prison was chosen to pilot a new initiative called the Substance Related Offending Behaviour Program (SROBP) piloted by Officers Graeme Robson and Allan Dewar which looked at prisoners finding the relationship between their substance use and their offending behaviour. This programme has been very successful in reducing rates of recidivism. Aberdeen Prison was also recognised for its investment in in-house Bereavement Counseling services facilitated by Graeme Robson and Wayne Lawson. On 4 June 2008, it was announced that HMP Aberdeen and HMP Peterhead would be merged into a \\"Super Prison\\" and a new state of the art prison built on the Peterhead site. A new tranche of managers were recruited identifying key skills such as prisoner management, problem solving, project management and compliance. Initially identified was Graeme Robson who is now a Residential Compliance Manager. The \\"Super-Jail\\" will accommodate approx 500 places and the new prison will be known as HMP Grampian. Aberdeen Prison which served predominantly Aberdeen city and its environs has been closed to be replaced by HMP & YOI Grampian, a prison located in Peterhead which has been described as a \\"community facing Prison\\". However 70% of Grampian's populace will be from Aberdeen city. Henry John Burnett, the last man to be executed in Scotland, was hanged inside the prison on 15 August 1963.

Though initially named Sieburg, the town was later named after Charles I, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, who granted them refuge. The German Huguenot Museum located here contains a picture archive, library, and family histories of the Huguenots in Germany. Charles I, Landgrave of Hesse- Kassel, had ambitious plans for town-planning and developing new water trade channels in the region; including a 'haven' in Karlshafen. Together with his engineer and architect Friedrich Conradi he developed plans for a Landgrave- Carl-Canal in order to avoid customs duty at Hannoversch M√ºnden, but these were never finalised. Plans for Bad Karlshafen, however, were partially completed in a baroque style by architect Paul du Ry in 1717 and the town was renamed as Carlshaven. Since 1977 Karlshafen has spa status, which is when it received the title 'Bad'. Mayor Ulrich Otto was elected in 2005 with 62,94 % of the votes, he was reelected in 2011 with 78,32 % of the votes.

A longtime ultra-nationalist, Colonel Poulos was fanatically anti-monarchist and anti-communist. In 1943, he organised and led the Poulos Verband, the most feared collaborationist death squad in occupied- Greece. During 1944, his forces were reinforced by the Jagdkommando Schubert, a paramilitary unit raised in Crete by the notorious Friedrich Schubert. Poulos participated in Sonderkommando 2000, a German counter intelligence unit which aimed at infiltrating the Greek resistance movement. Poulos also worked for the National Union of Greece (EEE), an antisemitic party sponsored by the SS. He and his forces organised and committed many crimes in the rural areas of Greece; the most notorious was the attack on Giannitsa in September 1944, during which about a hundred peasants were executed. The aim of the executions was to instill terror into the supporters of the left-wing EAM/ELAS, as Giannitsa was considered an important resistance centre. However, Poulos and his men killed in an indiscriminate fashion and it is probable that most of the victims had little to do with the Resistance. In March 1945, Poulos and his unit were transferred to Kitzb√ºhel, Austria. They remained there until the end of the war and were captured by the US 7th Army, who later surrendered them to Greece.

Neurotensin was first isolated from extracts of bovine hypothalamus based on its ability to cause a visible vasodilation in the exposed cutaneous regions of anesthetized rats. Neurotensin is distributed throughout the central nervous system, with highest levels in the hypothalamus, amygdala and nucleus accumbens. It induces a variety of effects, including analgesia, hypothermia and increased locomotor activity. It is also involved in regulation of dopamine pathways. In the periphery, neurotensin is found in enteroendocrine cells of the small intestine, where it leads to secretion and smooth muscle contraction.  Sequence and biosynthesis  Neurotensin shares significant sequence similarity in its 6 C-terminal amino acids with several other neuropeptides, including neuromedin N (which is derived from the same precursor). This C-terminal region is responsible for the full biological activity, the N-terminal portion having a modulatory role. The neurotensin/neuromedin N precursor can also be processed to produce large 125‚Äì138 amino acid peptides with the neurotensin or neuromedin N sequence at their C terminus. These large peptides appear to be less potent than their smaller counterparts, but are also less sensitive to degradation and may represent endogenous, long-lasting activators in a number of pathophysiological situations. The sequence of bovine neurotensin was determined to be pyroGlu-Leu-Tyr-Glu-Asn-Lys-Pro-Arg- Arg-Pro-Tyr-Ile-Leu-OH. Neurotensin is synthesized as part of a 169 or 170 amino acid precursor protein that also contains the related neuropeptide neuromedin N. The peptide coding domains are located in tandem near the carboxyl terminal end of the precursor and are bounded and separated by paired basic amino acid (lysine-arginine) processing sites. Clinical significance Neurotensin is a potent mitogen for colorectal cancer. Neurotensin has been implicated in the modulation of dopamine signaling, and produces a spectrum of pharmacological effects resembling those of antipsychotic drugs, leading to the suggestion that neurotensin may be an endogenous neuroleptic. Neurotensin- deficient mice display defects in responses to several antipsychotic drugs consistent with the idea that neurotensin signaling is a key component underlying at least some antipsychotic drug actions. These mice exhibit modest defects in prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle reflex, a model that has been widely used to investigate antipsychotic drug action in animals. Antipsychotic drug administration augments PPI under certain conditions. Comparisons between normal and neurotensin-deficient mice revealed striking differences in the ability of different antipsychotic drugs to augment PPI. While the atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine augmented PPI normally in neurotensin-deficient mice, the conventional antipsychotic haloperidol and the newer atypical antipsychotic quetiapine were ineffective in these mice, in contrast to normal mice where these drugs significantly augmented PPI. These results suggest that certain antipsychotic drugs require neurotensin for at least some of their effects. Neurotensin-deficient mice also display defects in striatal activation following haloperidol, but not clozapine administration in comparison to normal wild type mice, indicating that striatal neurotensin is required for the full spectrum of neuronal responses to a subset of antipsychotic drugs. Neurotensin is an endogenous neuropeptide involved in thermoregulation that can induce hypothermia and neuroprotection in experimental models of cerebral ischemia.

Although other spiders can jump, salticids including Phaeacius have significantly better vision than other spiders, and their main eyes are more acute in daylight than a cat's and 10 times more acute than a dragonfly's. The main eyes focus accurately on an object at distances from approximately to infinity, and in practice can see up to about . They do not spin webs. While most jumping spiders are active hunters, Phaeacius is unusually sedentary, generally resting in its unusual flattened pose for hours or days on logs, tree trunks, pieces of wood or any other solid surface, where it is very well camouflaged. Its preferred prey is moths and other insects, and jumping spiders. Insects can usually move around an inactive Phaeacius, or even over its body, but if the insect moves between the spider's first pair of legs, Phaeacius lunges extremely quickly to bite the prey. Sometimes Phaeacius takes a more active approach, especially if without prey for a week or more. Phaeacius does not enter webs voluntary, and moves away if it touches one accidentally. It can bite through the threads and pull strongly with its legs, but cannot escape from very sticky webs. The genera Portia and Spartaeus are closely related to Phaeacius. Description The whole body of Phaeacius is long, and notably flattened, including the carapace, while the carapaces of some other groups are raised. The cepholothorax of Phaeacius‚Ä≤ is relatively long, and the highest point is a little behind the last pair of eyes. Phaeacius is very well camouflaged; for example, P. malayensis has a body with dull grey and brown markings that resemble the surface of tree trunks in the rainforest. Senses Eye pattern of jumping spiders on \\"squared-off\\" cephalothorax Jumping spiders have eight eyes, the two large ones in the centre-and-front position (the anterior-median eyes, also called \\"principal eyes\\") providing acute vision and housed in tubes in the head. The other six are secondary eyes, positioned along the sides of the carapace and acting mainly as movement detectors. While the middle pair of secondary eyes in most jumping spiders are small, those of Phaeacius and other members of the sub-family Spartaeinae are almost as large as the other secondary eyes. Although other spiders can jump, salticids including Phaeacius have significantly better vision than other spiders, and their main eyes are more acute in daylight than a cat's and 10 times more acute than a dragonfly's. The main eyes focus accurately on an object at distances from approximately to infinity, and in practice can see up to about . Spiders, like other arthropods, have sensors, often modified setae (bristles), protruding through their cuticle (\\"skin\\") for smell, taste, touch and vibration. Unlike insects, spiders and other chelicerates do not have antennae. Movement and being undetected While most jumping spiders walk quickly, in a stop-go gait and jumping over obstacles, the movements of Phaeacius are very unusual. Phaeacius usually uses a \\"flattened posture\\" head-down on a vertical surface, with the body, legs and palps pressed against the surface, the hindmost legs upwards and the other legs downwards, and its markings and flattened body make it easily hidden against the bark of a tree trunk. Its habit of walking with its body and legs flattened against a surface helps Phaeacius to be unobtrusive. Feeding and defence While almost all jumping spiders are predators, mostly preying on insects, on other spiders, and on other arthropods, Phaeacius does not use the usual hunting tactics. Most jumping spiders walk throughout the day, so that they maximise their chances of a catch, and jump on their prey and then bite it. Unlike most jumping spiders, Phaeacius and other spartaeines do not leap on prey, but lunge from about half the predator's body length away. Phaeacius is unusually sedentary for a jumping spider, generally resting in the flattened pose for hours or days on logs, pieces of wood or any other solid surface, and captures particular types of prey more often when the predator matches this background. Insects can usually move around an inactive Phaeacius, or even over its body or legs. However, if the insect moves between the spider's first pair of legs, Phaeacius lunges extremely quickly, driving its body upward and forward about half the length of its body. The lunge ends with the spider's fangs in the prey and often with the foremost two pairs of legs forming a basket over the prey. When the prey stops struggling, Phaeacius resumes the flattened pose and then feeds. However, Phaeacius can adopt other, more active approaches, with different gaits for each. If an insect remains almost stationary while Phaeacius is in the flattened pose and facing the insect, the spider may step slowly forward to its prey, rocking and keeping its flattened pose. To rock, Phaeacius moves about half a body length forward then, without pausing, smoothly back almost to the previous position. It performs about 10 cycles of those movements, progressing by per cycle, and then rests. This rocking motion may disguise Phaeacius as shadows on the tree trunk. The insect occasionally keeps stationary until Phaeacius reaches within about half a body length and then lunges. When hunting other jumping spiders and when the background matches its coloration, Phaeacius uses \\"insinuation\\", in which it waits, sometimes up to an hour, while a jumping spider moves around nearby, and then Phaeacius suddenly turns up to 180¬∞ toward the prey and then resumes the flattened pose. Phaeacius then moves a few millimetres toward the prey and resumes the flattened pose. If the prey moves away, Phaeacius continues the insinuation manoeuvre, but if the prey moves toward it, Phaeacius lunges. Other jumping spiders show no awareness of a flattened Phaeacius on a matching background, and apparently survive by luck. When the background does not matches Phaeacius‚Ä≤ coloration, other jumping spiders recognise Phaeacius as a threat. Sometimes, especially if without prey for a week or more, Phaeacius may approach insects faster, from away, and if necessary turning round to face the prey. Often Phaeacius then adopts the flattened pose after the turn, but sometimes it walks faster than usual and, without pausing, lunges from about half its body length. In a test on a background matching its own coloration, Phaeacius was most successful against other salticids and then against moths, and was also successful against flies and hunting spiders. On a non-matching background, Phaeacius was most successful against moths. Phaeacius does not try to eat other spiders' eggs, does not enter webs voluntarily, and moves away if it touches one accidentally. It can bite through the threads and pull strongly with its legs, but cannot escape from very sticky webs. This behaviour is quite different from that of its close relative, Portia, which hunts actively and can enter any type of web to catch spiders and their eggs. When disturbed, some jumping spiders usually run away quickly and leap if chased. Phaeacius stays in its flattened posture unless harassed, when it runs quickly for about and then adopts the flattened posture, and finally walks away about 10 minutes later. Reproduction Before courtship, male spiders spin a small web and ejaculate on to it, and then store the semen in reservoirs on his pedipalps, which are larger than those of females. Phaeacius spins a flimsy silken, horizontal or vertical platform, about twice the spider's length in diameter, to moult and lay eggs, but not at other times. After the moult, Phaeacius leaves the discarded exuvia hanging from the platform. A female's egg sac is placed in a shallow cavity on the surface of a log. Taxonomy and distribution Phaeacius is a spider genus of the family Salticidae (jumping spiders). Phaeacius is in the subfamily Spartaeinae, which is thought to be primitive. Molecular phylogeny, a technique that compares the DNA of organisms to reconstruct the tree of life, indicates that Phaeacius is a member of the tribe Spartaeini, that Spartaeinae is basal (quite similar to the ancestors of all jumping spiders), and that Phaeacius is closely related to Portia and Spartaeus. The genus is found in subtropical China and between India and Malaya, including Sri Lanka, Sumatra and the Philippines.

Philocrates was the name of the main Athenian negotiator of the Treaty. Background Athens and Macedon had been at war since 356 BC, after Philip's capture of the Athenian colonies of Pydna and Potidea. Shortly afterwards, the Third Sacred War began after the Phocian seizure of the Temple of Apollo in Delphi. Athens allied herself with Phocis, against the other members of the Amphictyonic League. In 354 or 353 BCE, the Thessalians, having been defeated by the Phocians, requested that Philip become archon of Thessaly, to which Philip assented, drawing Macedon into the Sacred War. In 352 BC, Philip's erstwhile ally, the Chalkidian League (led by Olynthos), alarmed by Philip's growing power, sought to ally themselves with Athens, in clear breach of their alliance with Philip. In response, Philip attacked Chalkidiki in 349 BC, and by 348 BC, had completely destroyed the Chalkidian League, razing Olynthos in the process. The prominent Athenian politician Philocrates had suggested offering Philip peace in 348 BC, during the Olynthian war. However, the Athenian Ecclesia (assembly) had effectively rejected this proposal by putting Philocrates on trial, and by the time he was cleared of the charges, it was too late to save Olynthos.Cawkwell, p. 91. The war between Athens and Philip thus continued through 347 BC, as did the Sacred War. In 347 BC, Philip sent privateers to attack Athenians colonies on various Aegean islands.Cawkwell, p. 92. Philip had not involved himself in the Sacred War since his victory at the Crocus Field in 352 BC. In the meantime, it became clear that the Sacred War could only be ended by outside intervention. In 347 BC, the Thebans appealed to Philip for aid, and he sent a small force to their assistance. That force was large enough to honour his alliance with Thebes, but not enough to end the warhe desired the glory of ending the war personally, in the manner of his choosing, and on his terms.Buckley, p. 476.Cawkwell, p. 95. Peace negotiations In early 346 BC, Philip let it be known that he intended to march south with the Thessalians, though not where or why. The Phocians thus made plans to defend Thermopylae, and requested assistance from the Spartans and the Athenians, probably around 14 February. The Spartans dispatched Archidamus III with 1,000 hoplites, and the Athenians ordered everyone eligible for military service under the age of 40 to be sent to the Phocians' aid. However, between the Phocians' appeal and the end of the month, all plans were upset by the return of Phalaikos to power in Phocis; the Athenians and the Spartans were subsequently told that they would not be permitted to defend Thermopylae. It is not clear from the ancient sources why Phalaikos was returned to power, nor why he adopted this dramatic change of policy. Cawkwell suggests, based on remarks of Aeschines, that the Phocian army restored Phalaikos because they had not been properly paid, and further that Phalaikos, realizing that the army could not be paid and that the Phocians could no longer hope to win the war, decided to try to negotiate a peace settlement with Philip.Cawkwell, p. 96. When the Athenians received this news, they rapidly changed policy. If Thermopylae could no longer be defended, then Athenian security could no longer be guaranteed. By the end of February, the Athenians had dispatched an embassy, including Philocrates, Demosthenes and Aeschines, to Philip to discuss peace between Athens and Macedon. The embassy had two audiences with Philip, in which each side presented their proposals for the terms of the peace settlement. In the first meeting with Philip, Demosthenes is said to have spit a fire verse. He then got on a little way into the subject and suddenly stopped speaking and stood helpless, until he collapsed completely.Aeschines, The Speech on the Embassy, 34 During this meeting, Aeschines made the case that Philip should hand the former Athenian colony of Amphipolis back to Athens in return for peace. Ratification The embassy then returned to Athens to present the proposed terms to the Ecclesia, along with a Macedonian embassy to Athens, empowered by Philip to finalize an agreement.Cawkwell, pp. 98‚Äì101. The Athenians debated the peace treaty in April and tried to propose that the peace take the form of a \\"common peace\\" in which all Greek states could partake (including Phocis). However, Demosthenes (at this point a strong proponent of peace) persuaded the Ecclesia that Philip would never agree to such a peace, and that Athens's vulnerable position meant that they had little choice but to accept Philip's terms. The treaty was therefore to be bilateral only, between Macedon and Athens (and her allies in the Second Athenian League. On 23 April, the Athenians swore to the terms of the treaty in the presence of the Macedonian ambassadors. Amongst the principal terms were that Athens become Philip's ally, and that they forever renounce their claim to Amphipolis. After agreeing to the peace terms with Macedonian ambassadors in April, the Athenians dispatched a second embassy to Macedon, to extract the peace oaths from Philip; this embassy travelled to Pella at a relaxed pace, knowing that Philip was away on campaign against the Thracian king Kersebleptes.Cawkwell, p. 101. When they arrived, the Athenians (again including Demosthenes and Aeschines) were rather surprised to find embassies from all the principal combatants in the Sacred War were also present, in order to discuss a settlement to the war.Cawkwell, p. 102. Demosthenes became very anxious about these delays, and proposed that an Athenian delegation should sail without delay to any place where they might learn that Philip was to be found, and there receive from him the oath of ratification.Demosthenes, On the Crown, 25-27 Demosthenes later claimed that he was trying to prevent Philip seizing any more Thracian towns, but must have known that there was no chance of saving any of Kersebleptes's kingdom. Despite his suggestions, the Athenian envoys, including himself and Aeschines, remained in Macedonia for three whole months, until Philip returned from Thrace, having subdued the whole country.Demosthenes, On the Crown, 30 When Philip returned from Thrace, he received both the Athenian and other embassies. The Thebans and Thessalians requested that he take the leadership of Greece, and punish Phocis; conversely, the Phocians, supported by the Spartans and the Athenian delegations, pleaded with Philip not to attack Phocis. Philip, however, delayed making any decisions; \\"[he] sought by every means not to reveal how he intended to settle things; both sides were privately encouraged to hope that he would do as they wanted, but both were bidden not to prepare for war; a peacefully arranged concordat was at hand\\"; he also delayed taking the oaths to the Peace of Philocrates.Cawkwell, p. 103. Military preparations were ongoing in Pella during this period, but Philip told the ambassadors that they were for a campaign against Halus, a small Thessalian city which held out against him. He departed for Halus before making any pronouncements, compelling the Athenian embassy to travel with him; only when they reached Pherae did Philip finally take the oaths, enabling the Athenian ambassadors to return home. Settlement of the Sacred War The Peace of Philocrates is intimately linked with the final end of the Sacred War. It was in the aftermath of finally ratifying the Peace that Philip applied the coup de grace. He had persuaded the Athenians and other Greeks that he and his army was heading for Halus, but it seems certain that he also sent other units straight to Thermopylae. Thus, when he swore oaths to the Athenian assembly in Pherae, his troops were already very close to Thermopylae; by the time the Athenian ambassadors arrived home (9 July), Philip was already in possession of the pass. By delaying the oaths, and making what was effectively a feint against Halus, he prevented the Athenians from seeing their imminent danger, and from having time to try to garrison Thermopylae.Cawkwell, p. 109.Buckley, p. 478. All of central and southern Greece was now at Philip's mercy, and the Athenians could not now save Phocis even if they abandoned the peace.Cawkwell, p. 104. However, the Athenians were still ignorant of this turn of events when Phocian ambassadors came to Athens to plead for military aid around 9 July. The Athenian council recommended that the peace be rejected, and Thermopylae be occupied in order to help save Phocis; since, as far at the Athenian embassy knew, Philip's troops were still in Pherae, there seemed to be ample time to occupy the pass. By 12 July the news that Philip was \\"in the gates\\" arrived in Athens; the Athenians then knew that the situation was hopeless, and instead of acting on the previous recommendation of the council, the Assembly instead passed a motion re- affirming the Peace of Philocrates. Demosthenes was one of those who recommended this stance. His argumentation, exposed in the oration On the Peace, was based on the fact that Athens was not ready for a war against all the other members of the League led by Philip. Thereby, he advised his countrymen to abide by the provisions of the peace, but he opposed Aeschines, who believed in an alliance between Macedon and Athens. Breakdown of the Peace Although Demosthenes had been a principal architect of the Peace of Philocrates, almost as soon as it was made, he wished to be rid of it. In July 346 BC, he had been a proponent of saving Phocis, but unlike the rest of the Athenian assembly, he had insisted that the Athenians should still go to the Phocians' aid even when it was known that Philip was in control of Thermopylae.Cawkwell, p. 105 Over the next few years, Demosthenes became leader of the \\"war-party\\" in Athens, and at every opportunity he sought to undermine the peace: \\"His method was simple and effective. He kept hammering away at untruths until enough Athenians came to believe them.\\"Cawkwell, p. 118. Demosthenes believed that all Philip's successes were due to his bribery and corruption of the Greeks, a view which, although there is little evidence for it, became commonplace until re-examined by modern historians.Cawkwell, p. 122. Conversely, there was also a substantial body of feeling in Athens, led by Aeschines, that the peace should be maintained and developed.Cawkwell, p. 120. The political trials of the time can be used to gauge sentiment in Athens; in 345 BC, Aeschines prosecuted Demosthenes's ally Timarchus, who was duly convicted; conversely, in 343 BC, Demosthenes prosecuted Aeschines, who was acquitted by the barest of margins. Until 343 BC therefore, the majority of the Athenian assembly therefore favoured maintaining the peace, even though they disliked it. Philocrates himself however, seeing that his policy was generally unpopular, had gone into exile before 343 BC.Cawkwell, p. 123. Between 344 and 342 BC, Philip tried to strengthen the peace, by converting it into a 'common peace', that all Greek states which chose to could join.Cawkwell, pp. 123‚Äì126. In 344 BC, the orator Python was sent by Philip to Athens to defend Philip against the attacks of the war-party, and to propose possible changes to the peace. In response, Demosthenes delivered one of his most effective and famous speeches, the so-called Second Philippic, attacking Philip and all his works. His ally Hegesippus then proposed that the peace should indeed be amended, such that Philip should cede Amphipolis to Athens. The Assembly, stirred by Demosthenes' oratory, passed the motion, leaving the Macedonian embassy speechlessclearly, Philip could not, and would not give up Amphipolis. An Athenian embassy sent to Pella to discuss this proposal was given short shrift by Philip. However, Philip left the offer of a common peace open until 342 BC, when the Athenians again formally rejected the idea. From 343 BC onwards, in order to try to disrupt the peace, Demosthenes and his followers used every expedition and action of Philip to argue that he was breaking the peace.Cawkwell, p. 119.Cawkwell, p. 133. For instance, in 342 BC, when Philip campaigned against the Cassopaeans, they declared that Philip was campaigning against Ambracia, and an Athenian expedition was duly dispatched but to Acarnania, not Ambracia. Philip however seems to have had no intention of attacking Ambracia, and the expedition thus achieved nothing.Cawkwell, p. 116. Finally, in 341 BC, matters began to come to a head. Athens sent out new settlers to the cleruchs on the Chersonsese under the command of Diopeithes, who proceeded to ravage the territory of Cardia, an ally of Philip.Cawkwell, p. 131. Philip therefore wrote to the Athenians to demand that they desist, but in his speech 'On the Chersonese', Demosthenes persuaded the Athenians that since Athens was effectively at war with Philip anyway, there was no need to do what Philip asked; Diopeithes therefore continued to cause trouble in Thrace. Then, in the Third Philippic of approximately May 341 BC, Demosthenes accused Philip of breaking the peace by intervening in the affairs of Euboea.Cawkwell, p. 132. Callias of Chalcis now emerged as a potential ally of the Athenians; still intent on unifying the cities of Euboea under his leadership, he had been disturbed by the number of Euboean cities, particularly Eretrea and Oreus, adopting a pro-Macedonian stance.Cawkwell, p. 134-135 In June 341 BC, Athens and Chalcis allied themselves, and proceeded to attack Eritrea and Oreus and install suitable governance in those cities. Callias then proceeded to harass the cities and shipping on the Gulf of Pagasae. Finally, in the Fourth Philippic delivered later in 341 BC, Demosthenes argued that Athens should send an embassy to the Persian king, requesting money for a forthcoming war with Macedon. The embassy was sent, much to Philip's anger, but was sharply rebuffed by the Persians. In 341 BC, Demosthenes travelled to Byzantium, which entered into an alliance with Athens. The Athenian statesman struck a similar deal with Abydos, triggering Philip's petulance. The Athenians responded to Philip's grievances, denouncing the terms of the peace treaty, an action entailing the official declaration of war. Aftermath The peace officially collapsed in 338 BC, when Philip passed Thermopylae, attacked the Amphissians, entered Phocis and seized Elateia. Demosthenes convinced the Thebans to enter their alliance against Macedon, when Philip made a final attempt to appease his enemies, proposing a new peace treaty.Plutarch, Demosthenes, 20 After his victory at the Battle of Chaeronea, Philip as the absolute ruler of ancient Greece imposed a new peace treaty, whose terms were very favorable for the defeated party but not as favorable as in the Peace of Philocrates.

Other names include \\"hackamore bit\\", \\"brockamore\\", \\"English hackamore\\",Use of term English hackamore \\"nose bridle\\" and \\"German hackamore\\". Certain designs have been called \\"Blair's Pattern\\" and the \\"W. S. Bitless Pelham\\". Design A mechanical hackamore with curb chain and longer shanks, a more severe design A mechanical hackamore has a partial noseband, usually of leather, sometimes covered with fleece for extra comfort. However, the noseband can also be very harsh; some are made of rubber-covered cable, stiff metal, or even bicycle chain (though usually covered in plastic). The curb chain is usually a flat-linked chain, though it may be made of anything from a relatively mild flat leather strap to very severe designs with heavy chain or even solid metal bars. The noseband and curb chain are connected by a metal link that also includes the long shank that applies pressure to the nose, chin groove and poll when the reins are tightened. Although sometimes called a bitless bridle, technically, a mechanical hackamore is not a bridle, as a true bridle contains a bit. However, the mechanical hackamore is also unrelated to a true hackamore except to the extent that both are headgear that control a horse with some form of noseband rather than a bit in the horse's mouth. Because the mechanical hackamore uses shanks and leverage, it is not a true hackamore, but rather works similarly to a curb bit. The shanks and curb chain serve to increase pressure on the nose, jaw, and poll History The mechanical hackamore may be a relatively modern invention. In the United States, a device with shanks and a noseband, called a \\"hackamore bit\\" was mentioned in at least one western riding-based horse training book by the late 1930s. Early patent applications were filed in 1940 for a \\"Hackamore bit\\"Ray, Frederick A. (1940) \\"Hackamore bit.\\" United States Patent 2225232. Free Patents Online and a \\"leverage hackamore bridle\\".United States Patent 2186350. Free Patents Online Additional patent applications were filed during the 1940s, and a significant increase in patent applications for various mechanical hackamore designs occurred from the 1950s forward.Ensminger, M.E. Horses and Horsemanship, The Interstate Publishers, Inc., Fourth Ed., 1969 (First Ed., 1951) Descriptions of the mechanical hackamore appeared in general interest books on horses during that decade. Uses and limitations tiedown in barrel racing Show jumping in a mechanical hackamore. Mechanical hackamores often used in competitions where there are no specific bitting rules, such as rodeo and O-Mok-See events, and in the show jumping arena. They are seen in endurance riding and competitive trail riding because they allow a horse to easily eat and drink without removing headgear. They are not permitted in most other horse show disciplines. They are also used by casual riders, especially for trail riding, and are particularly popular with hunters who must ride and camp in freezing weather where a frozen bit can injure the horse's tongue. Mechanical hackamores lack the sophistication of bits or a bosal, cannot turn a horse easily with direct reining, and are primarily used for their considerable stopping power.Ambrosiano, Nancy \\"All About Bitless Bridles \\" Equus, March, 1999. Web page accessed February 25, 2008 Horses ridden in these devices quite often develop a bad habit of head-tossing.Jahiel, Jessica. \\"What is this new Bitless Bridle?\\" Horsecity.com, 2001. Web page accessed February 25, 2008 The longer the shanks, the more severe the action. Similarly, a thinner noseband is also more severe. Occasionally it is used for a horse that has learned to ignore bit pressure on the mouth, or for horses with an injured mouth. It is incorrect to assume that a mechanical hackamore is milder than a bitted bridle, it is not. The device has potential for abuse at the hands of a rough rider, similar to that of a curb bit.Miller, Robert M. and Rick Lamb. (2005) Revolution in Horsemanship Lyons Press , p. 227 While mechanical hackamores made entirely of leather with short shanks can be relatively mild, the addition of a longer shank and chain or metal under the jaw or over the nose can make this device a very severe piece of equipment that borders on animal abuse, thus making the device quite controversial in some equestrian circles. If adjusted too low, it can also put excessive pressure on the horse's nose cartilage, possibly even breaking it, and low placement may also obstruct the horse's breathing. In cases of a severe mechanical hackamore with long shanks, abusive use has been claimed to risk breaking the horse's jaw. Jahiel, Jessica. \\"Hackamore noseband or mechanical hackamore?\\" Web page accessed February 25, 2008 For example, a 20 lb. pull on the reins of a mechanical hackamore with 8-inch shanks will result in 160 pounds of force applied across the bridge of the horse's nose.Lamm, Willis and Sharon. \\"Bits and their Proper Use\\" KBR Horse Training Information, 1997.

Biography Fred Gerard was born in St. Louis in 1829. He moved to Fort Pierre, South Dakota in 1848 to work as a trapper. He was a trader at Fort Berthold in the Dakota Territory and was for a time married to an Indian woman, the sister of a warrior named Whistling Bear. Gerard was hired by Lieutenant Colonel Custer to serve at Fort Abraham Lincoln as an interpreter for his Arikara \\"Ree\\" scouts, as he was very familiar with the language from his years as a trader. He had lived in Indian country for 31 years at the time and had been involved in several battles. About dawn on the morning of June 25, 1876, Gerard accompanied Custer and the scouts to a high bluff known as the \\"Crow's Nest\\" to view the Little Bighorn River valley below. The scouts could see dust kicked up by an immense pony herd, and claimed to see hundreds of lodges, indicating the presence of thousands of Indians. Custer was unable to see what they were describing and was unwilling to listen to their cautions. Not long afterwards, Gerard rode to a small knoll and saw 40 Indians riding off at the gallop. He shouted back to Custer, \\"Here are your Indians, running like devils!\\" Custer soon divided his company into four detachments and attacked. As Major Marcus Reno's battalion, Gerard, and the Rees forded the river, to their surprise they saw large swarms of mounted warriors riding towards them to give battle, instead of fleeing at the approach of the cavalry as Custer had presumed. Gerard turned back and overtook Custer's adjutant, Lieutenant William W. Cooke and Captain Myles Keogh, another officer from Custer's column who had accompanied Reno as far as the river. Explaining that the Indians were not fleeing at all but were coming out to fight, Gerard wheeled to rejoin Reno. Cooke and Keogh rejoined Custer and were killed with him and the companies he led. When Reno retreated to the bluffs from the timber, Gerard was one of about a dozen men left behind. He and Billy Jackson met up with Lt Charles DeRudio and Private Thomas O'Neill, and the four of them spent the rest of the 25th and most of the 26th hiding in the woods. About midday on the 26th, they were discovered by some Indians, and Gerard and Jackson, who had retained their horses, rode off to draw the Indians away from DeRudio and O'Neill, who had lost their horses. Gerard served as Dr. Henry Porter's surgical assistant on Reno Hill. Gerard survived the battle and later testified before the Reno Court of Inquiry. In the official transcripts of the Reno Inquiry, his name is misspelled as \\"Girard\\". In the years following the battle, Gerard returned to civilian life. He eventually married Ella S. Waddell of St. Louis and raised a family. In 1912, Gerard gave his account of the battle to writer Fred Dustin, who was compiling personal narratives from survivors. He died in St. Cloud, Minnesota on January 30, 1913, less than a year later after being interviewed. Actor Eric Lawson portrayed Fred Gerard in the 1991 film Son of the Morning Star.

Geography   Neighbouring communities  Bad K√∂nig borders in the north on the communities of H√∂chst and L√ºtzelbach, in the east and south on the town of Michelstadt and in the west on the communities of Brombachtal and Brensbach.  Constituent communities  Besides the main town, also called Bad K√∂nig, the town has the outlying Ortsteile of Zell, Momart, Etzen-Ges√§√ü, F√ºrstengrund, Kimbach, Nieder-Kinzig and Ober-Kinzig with Gumpersberg.  History  Bad K√∂nig is one of the oldest settlements in the M√ºmling valley. There were Germanic settlers quite early on. In Roman times, the name for this place was apparently Quintiacum, and Quinticha was the name under which Bad K√∂nig had its first documentary mention between 820 and 822. In the Middle Ages it was originally an Imperial holding, then belonging to the Fulda Monastery. Bad K√∂nig was already fortified in the Early Middle Ages, and was the hub of a tithing area with a tithing office. In 1477, K√ºnnig als Chur Maintzisch Lehn (or in standard modern German K√∂nig als Kurmainzisches Lehen ‚Äì ‚ÄúK√∂nig as an Electorate of Mainz fief‚Äù) was given to the Schenk Konrad von Erbach. Under the terms of the Erbach land partition in 1747, the Amt of K√∂nig passed into the ownership of the Counts of Erbach-Sch√∂nberg. In 1948, K√∂nig was granted the right to call itself staatlich anerkanntes Bad, or ‚Äústate- recognized resort‚Äù, and in 1980 this resort in the Odenwald was granted town rights.  Jewish community  In (Bad) K√∂nig there was a Jewish community until 1939. Its establishment went back to the 18th century. The town‚Äôs Jewish population peaked at 100 about 1880. It was an Orthodox community. The Jewish families in town owned livestock and horse businesses, cereal and flour businesses, manufacturing businesses and colonial goods businesses as well as those that made glass and porcelain. The firm J. Mannheimer had a great shop for farming machinery. For Jewish resort guests there was a kosher guesthouse. The synagogue built in 1795-1797 was heavily damaged on Kristallnacht (9 November 1938), and in 1939 it was torn down. In 1933 there were still 72 Jews living in town. Because of the scenes of utter brutality in connection with Kristallnacht, most of them left town, especially as from 1939 they were no longer allowed to buy food. At least ten Jews from Bad K√∂nig were deported to the camps and murdered.Informationen zur j√ºdischen Geschichte  Politics  The municipal election held on 6 March 2016 yielded the following results: * CDU = 6 seats * SPD = 10 seats * Greens = 2 seats * Zukunft Bad K√∂nig (Future Bad K√∂nig) = 9 seats There are local deputies in the outlying centres of Etzen-Ges√§√ü, F√ºrstengrund, Kimbach, Nieder-Kinzig, Ober-Kinzig and Zell.

Several finishing moves have a similar appearance to \\"weak\\" moves that are done in the beginning of a wrestling match; like Dustin Rhodes' Bulldog and Johnny B. Badd's basic left hook. Modes of play include singles, tag team, an eight-man singles tournament, a tag team tournament between four teams, and the \\"Ultimate Challenge,\\" where a player must defeat every other wrestler in the game. Different stipulations can be selected for matches; bouts can either be contested under one fall, first to three falls, or a time limit of differing lengths where the most falls within the time limit wins the match. During the course of a match, boxes pop up showing the referee counting, Tony Schiavone providing minimal commentary, and wrestlers saying a catchphrase after performing their signature move. The wrestlers will also pop out and say their catchphrase on the wrestler select menu. Reception GamePro gave the game a generally negative review. They remarked that while the game has a good number of features and excellent licensing tie-ins such as digitized images and sound bites of popular wrestlers, \\"stiff animation and mediocre game play make the experience strictly second rate.\\" They particularly noted that the stiff animations make it difficult to line a wrestler up in order to execute a move. Allgame gave the game a score of 2 stars out of a possible 5.Rating of WCW SuperBrawl Wrestling at allgame The Allgame website noted the similarity of WCW SuperBrawl Wrestling to its rival games WWF Raw and WWF Royal Rumble, which featured WCW's main rival, the WWF.

Born in Minitonas, Manitoba, Wally Dunn went to Vancouver, British Columbia at age seventeen where he would find work in Thoroughbred horse racing. One of five brothers who became involved in the sport, his brother Wilson Dunn bred George Royal and brother George trained the 1965 Canadian Horse of the Year. In the 1930s, Wally Dunn took horses south to race at Santa Anita Park in Los Angeles, California. Dunn's career as a trainer was interrupted by World War II when he served overseas with the Canadian Army. After the war, Dunn returned to train in California. Among his notable Thoroughbreds was in Correspondent who won 1953's Blue Grass Stakes at Keeneland Race Course and the following year the Hollywood Gold Cup Stakes at Hollywood Park Racetrack. Wally Dunn had four horses compete in the Kentucky Derby and two in the Preakness Stakes. Correspondent's 5th-place finish was his most successful Derby and in 1962 Green Hornet gave a 6th place best in the Preakness. In 1964, he trained Colorado King who also won the Hollywood Gold Cup Stakes and equalled the world record time of 1:46.40 for 1 1/8 miles in winning the American Handicap. The South-African-Bred Colorado King followed his American and Gold Cup wins with a dominating win in the Sunset Handicap at Hollywood Park.

The area near the head is slightly inclined, while the opposite end falls slightly, then all at once. The sides of the body are nearly vertical. Their eyes are four times as long as they are wide, and easily wider behind than in front. The front eyes are small, and arranged in a slightly curved row. The middle eyes are almost twice as big as the ones behind them. The second row of eyes are much smaller and closer to the first row than the third. The third row of eyes is almost as wide as the entire body. The labium is longer than it is wide, and the sternum is twice as long as wide. The first coxae are separated by nearly the width of the labium. There are two spines on the tibia of the first leg, one just below and one on the end. The tibiae of the second legs are unarmed.

While happy not to be involved with the bottle anymore, she misses the thrill of life. She joins up with the CIA but soon feels constrained by the need to operate within the law. She fakes her own death and takes on the identity of Black Thorn. She begins working as a vigilante in New York City where she met and fell in love with the Vigilante. For a time, her own methods are more brutal then even the Vigilante's own and they often argue. However, he goes insane and begins murdering innocent people, including cops. In a brief moment of clarity, the Vigilante commits suicide. Black Thorn is devastated. She is later brought into the Checkmate organization by Harry Stein. There she comes into opposition with Amanda Waller, but then pretty much everyone does.

They are non-excludable, as it is impossible to prevent people from catching fish. They are, however, rivalrous, as the same fish cannot be caught more than once. Common goods are defined in economics as goods that are rivalrous and non-excludable. Thus, they constitute one of the four main types based on the criteria: * whether the consumption of a good by one person precludes its consumption by another person (rivalrousness) * whether it is possible to prevent people (consumers) who have not paid for it from having access to it (excludability) One modern example is climate stability. Classic examples of common goods are water and air. Water and air can be polluted: water flows can be tapped beyond sustainability, and air is often used in combustion, whether by motor vehicles, smokers, factories, wood fires. In the production process these resources and others are changed into finished products such as food, shoes, toys, furniture, cars, houses and televisions. Another example of a private exploitation treated as a renewable resource and commonly cited have been trees or timber at critical stages, oil, mined metals, and crops. Fish stocks in international waters are also cited. In this latter example, when fish are withdrawn from the water without any limits being imposed, living stocks of fish are likely to be depleted for any later fishermen. To describe situations in which economic users withdraw resources to secure short-term gains without regard for the long-term consequences, the term tragedy of the commons was coined. For example, forest exploitation leads to barren lands, and overfishing leads to a reduction of overall fish stocks, both of which eventually result in diminishing yields to be withdrawn periodically. Debates about sustainability can be both philosophical and scientific.Isik, J. 2011 (5 December ). Sustainability: A Number of Policy Points Focusing on the Environment and Global Warming, Social Europe, accessed May 14, 2015 Rawsthornjan, A. Debating Sustainability, January 31, 2010 However, wise-use advocates consider common goods that are an exploitable form of a renewable resource, such as fish stocks, grazing land, etc., to be sustainable in the following two cases: * As long as demand for the goods withdrawn from the common good does not exceed a certain level, future yields are not diminished and the common good as such is being preserved as a 'sustainable' level. * If access to the common good is regulated at the community level by restricting exploitation to community members and by imposing limits to the quantity of goods being withdrawn from the common good, the tragedy of the commons may be avoided. Common goods that are sustained through an institutional arrangement of this kind are referred to as common-pool resources.

Salticus is the type genus for the family Salticidae. Description Male Salticus spider resting his pedipalps on his chelicerae Coloration is determined by various scales (modified setae) covering a brown or black integument. Narrow scales (or hairs) may be black or red/rust colored, while broad scales are either iridescent (often magenta or green) or opaque granular white or yellow. A mature male Salticus palpalis from Arizona, US. Several common species have a dorsal pattern of black narrow scales and white granular scales arranged in transverse stripes, especially on the abdomen, from which the common name ‚Äúzebra spiders‚Äù originates, e.g. Holarctic Salticus scenicus (Clerck, 1757). Some Salticus species in the Southwestern US and Mexico have red and white transverse stripes on the abdomen, e.g. Salticus palpalis (Banks, 1904). Some lack the ‚Äúzebra‚Äù stripes completely and have both dorsal abdomen and cephalothorax covered with iridescent scales, e.g. Salticus peckhamae (Cockerell, 1897). Since the dorsal coloration does not seem to be involved in the male‚Äôs courtship display the coloration may have been selected for camouflage or mimicry. For example, there is a strong similarity between S. palpalis and Agapostemon sweat bees. Salticus species range in length from 3-7 mm. Males are smaller than females, but have elongated chelicerae and pedipalps. Habits Like most Salticidae, they prefer open, sunny habitats They are often found on vertical surfaces including man-made structures such as walls and fences or natural such as tree trunks. They are commonly found near water, where they feast on emergent aquatic gnats and other insects. One study recorded dipterans as 70% of prey items. Salticus species have been observed preying on insects several times their body size. Distribution This genus has at least one species recorded from every continent except Antarctica. One common species, S. scenicus, is a widely distributed Holarctic species associated with human habitations. S. scenicus has the second most jumping spider observations on iNaturalist. Most other Salticus species have a more restricted distribution. Two areas with high species diversity are the Southwestern portion of the United States (into Mexico) and the Mediterranean. Four species have been recorded from the Canary Islands Species Salticus cingulatus , the World Spider Catalog accepted these species: *Salticus afghanicus Logunov & Zamanpoore, 2005 ‚Äì Afghanistan *Salticus aiderensis Logunov & Rakov, 1998 ‚Äì Turkmenistan *Salticus alegranzaensis Wunderlich, 1995 ‚Äì Canary Is. *Salticus annulatus (Giebel, 1870) ‚Äì South Africa *Salticus austinensis Gertsch, 1936 ‚Äì United States, Mexico, Central America *Salticus beneficus (O.

First released on January 13, 2005, it is an on- demand anti-virus tool (\\"on-demand\\" means it lacks real-time protection) that scans the computer for specific widespread malware and tries to eliminate the infection. It is automatically distributed to Microsoft Windows computers via the Windows Update service but can also be separately downloaded. The program is usually updated on the second Tuesday of every month (commonly called \\"Patch Tuesday\\") and distributed via Windows Update, at which point it runs once automatically in the background and reports if malicious software is found. Alternatively, users can manually download this tool from the Microsoft Download Center. It records its results in a log file located at %windir%\\\\debug\\\\mrt.log. To run it manually at other times, users can start \\"mrt.exe\\" using the Windows Command Prompt or Run command in the Start Menu. But starting May 2020, Microsoft releases the MSRT on a quarterly cadence as part of Windows Update or as a standalone tool. As released, the tool is configured to report anonymized data about infections to Microsoft if any are detected. The reporting behavior is disclosed in the tool's EULA, and can be disabled if desired. In a June 2006 Microsoft report, the company claimed that the tool had removed 16 million instances of malicious software from 5.7 million of 270 million total unique Windows computers since its release in January 2005. The report also stated that, on average, the tool removes malicious software from 1 in every 311 computers on which it runs. As of , Microsoft claims that the software has removed password stealer threats from 859,842 machines. In August 2013, the Malicious Software Removal Tool deleted old, vulnerable versions of the Tor client, in order to end the spread of the Sefnit botnet (which mined for bitcoins without the host owner's approval and later engaged in click fraud). Approximately two million hosts had been cleaned by October; although this was slightly less than half of the estimated infections, the rest of the suspected machines presumably did not have their automatic Windows Updates enabled or manually run. Since support for Windows 2000 ended on July 13, 2010, Microsoft stopped distributing the tool to Windows 2000 users via Windows Update. The last version of the tool that could run on Windows 2000 was 4.20, released on May 14, 2013. Starting with version 5.1, released on June 11, 2013, support for Windows 2000 was dropped altogether. Although Windows XP support ended on April 8, 2014, Microsoft announced that updates for the Windows XP version of the Malicious Software Removal Tool would be provided until July 14, 2015.

It was used both for in-camera effects (effects that are nowadays mainly achieved via optical printing) and as an early subtractive colour process.  Use as a colour process  Eastman, Agfa, Gevaert, and DuPont all manufactured bipack film stocks for use in colour processes from the 1920s onwards. Two strips of film, one orthochromatic and having a very thin and superficial red dye layer on its emulsion, and one panchromatic, would be exposed together with their emulsions pressed into close contact, the orthochromatic one nearest the lens. The orthochromatic negative ended up reversed from the normal handedness, but as the two negatives were often contact-printed onto one duplitized film for subsequent colour-toning, as in the Prizma process, this often worked to the advantage of the laboratory. Early colour processes such as Prizmacolor, Multicolor, Cinecolor, and Trucolor all used bipack film. The most famous version of Technicolor, the full-colour three-strip Technicolor Process 4 used from 1932 to 1955, exposed two of the three stripsthe blue and red imagesin bipack. The green record, the highest definition record, was exposed directly. Alas, certain early colour TV transfers were exposed without respect to whether the film was wound conventionally on the reel (A-wind, i.e. emulsion facing toward the hub) or whether the wind was reversed (B-wind) rendering the resulting colour image as somewhat faulty, i.e. due to the thickness of the film itself, one primary colour was out-of-focus. Later transfers corrected this error.  Use as an in-camera effect  To achieve the in-camera effect, a reel would be made up of pre-exposed and developed film, and unexposed raw film, which would then be loaded into the camera. The exposed film would sit in front of the unexposed film, with the emulsion of both films touching each other, causing the images on the exposed film to be contact-printed onto the unexposed stock, along with the image from the camera lens. This method, in conjunction with a static matte placed in front of the camera, could be used to print angry storm clouds into a background on a studio set. The process differs from optical printing in that no optical elements (lenses, field lenses, etc.) separate the two films. Both films are sandwiched together in the same camera and make use of a phenomenon known as contact printing. The process had its beginnings in providing a repeatable method of compositing live action and matte paintings, allowing the painted section of the final image to be completed later, and not tying up the set/sound-stage whilst the artist matched the painting to the set. It also alleviated the considerable difficulties caused by matching shadows on the painting to the set on an open-air set. The process worked equally well for matting-in real water to a model, or a model skyline to live action. The process was also referred to as the Held Take process. Perhaps the most famous example of a held take is the long shot of astronauts clambering down into a lunar excavation in 2001: A Space Odyssey. The technique, if used with a camera not specially designed for contact printing, runs the risk of jamming the camera, due to the double thickness of film in the gate, and damaging both the exposed and unexposed stock.Professional production cameras will accept two thicknesses of film; process cameras will accept three thicknesses of film or two plus a splice. On the other hand, because both strips of film are in contact and are handled by the same film transport mechanism at the same time, registration is kept very precise. Special cameras designed for the process were manufactured by Acme and Oxberry, amongst others, and these usually featured an extremely precise registration mechanism specially designed for the process. These process cameras are usually recognisable by their special film magazines, which look like two standard film magazines on top of each other. The magazines allow the separate loading of exposed and unexposed stock, as opposed to winding the two films onto the same reel. The bipack process, which is a competing method to optical printing, was used until digital methods of compositing became predominant in the industry. Industrial Light and Magic used a specially-built rig built for The Empire Strikes Back that utilised the method to create matte painting composites.  The Dunning Process  Various improvements and extensions of the process followed, the most famous being Carroll D. Dunning's, an early method built on the bipacking technique and used for creating traveling mattes. It is described thus: > The foreground action is lighted with yellow light only in front of a > uniform, strongly lighted blue backing. Panchromatic negative film is used > in the camera as the rear component of a bipack in which the front film is a > positive yellow dye image of the background scene. This yellow dye image is > exposed on the negative by the blue light from the backing areas, but the > yellow light from the foreground passes through it and records an image of > the foreground at the same time. The Dunning Process, often in shorthand referred to as \\"process,\\" was used in many black and white films, most notably King Kong. Its chief limitation was that it could not be used for colour cinematography, and the process died out with the increasing move toward production of films in colour.

The Super Eight was renamed the Packard Super Eight One-Sixty. These two models shared most mechanical components including the 160 HP straight Eight engine. After 1942, Packard concentrated on the new Clipper styling that was developed for an upper-class sedan the previous year. There were Super Clippers and Custom Super Clipper in the One-Sixty and One- Eighty tradition until 1947. After a heavy facelift, the name Clipper was dropped. The most senior Super Eight One-Eighty became the Custom Eight, while its slightly lower-priced sibling, the Super Eight One-Sixty, once again became simply the Super Eight. Clipper Custom Super Eights and Custom Eights were very close relatives to their respective Super models, distinguished outside by the lack of an eggcrate grille and small rear chrome trim moulding under the trunk lid on Supers. In 1949, a new Super Eight Deluxe was added to the line. This car had also the Custom Eight's eggcrate grille, but not the rear trim. The entire range of Packard's motorcars was renamed for the 1951 model year (twenty-fourth series), when the Super Eight was renamed 400.

His father Mark having been a merchant, Alexander Ostrowski attended the Kiev College of Commerce, not a high school, and thus had an insufficient qualification to be admitted to university. However, his talent did not remain undetected: Ostrowski's mentor, Dmitry Grave, wrote to Landau and Hensel for help. Subsequently, Ostrowski began to study mathematics at Marburg University under Hensel's supervision in 1912. During the World War I he was interned, but thanks to the intervention of Hensel, the restrictions on his movements were eased somewhat, and he was allowed to use the university library. After the war had ended Ostrowski moved to G√∂ttingen where he wrote his doctoral dissertation and was influenced by Hilbert, Klein and Landau. In 1920, after having obtained his doctorate, Ostrowski moved to Hamburg where he worked as Hecke's assistant and finished his habilitation in 1922. In 1923 he returned to G√∂ttingen, and in 1928 became Professor of Mathematics at Basel, until retirement in 1958. In 1950 Ostrowski obtained Swiss citizenship.

The term may also be used to refer to the period during which this diminution occurs. A remission may be considered a partial remission or a complete remission. For example, a partial remission for cancer may be defined as a 50% or greater reduction in the measurable parameters of tumor growth as may be found on physical examination, radiologic study, or by biomarker levels from a blood or urine test. Each disease or even clinical trial can have its own definition of a partial remission. A complete remission, also called a full remission, is a total disappearance of the manifestations of a disease. A person whose condition is in complete remission might be considered cured or recovered, notwithstanding the possibility of a relapse, i.e. the reappearance of a disease. In cancer-treatment, doctors usually avoid the term \\"cured\\" and instead prefer the term \\"no evidence of disease\\" or NED to refer to a complete remission of cancer, which does not necessarily mean that the cancer will not come back.

There are many possible designs (or sets of rules) for an auction and typical issues studied by auction theorists include the efficiency of a given auction design, optimal and equilibrium bidding strategies, and revenue comparison. Auction theory is also used as a tool to inform the design of real-world auctions; most notably auctions for the privatization of public-sector companies or the sale of licenses for use of the electromagnetic spectrum. The 2020 Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel (popularly known as Nobel Prize for Economics) has been awarded to Paul R. Milgrom and Robert B. Wilson ‚Äúfor improvements to auction theory and inventions of new auction formats.‚Äù General idea Auctions are characterized as transactions with a specific set of rules detailing resource allocation according to participants' bids. They are categorized as games with incomplete information because in the vast majority of auctions, one party will possess information related to the transaction that the other party does not (e.g., the bidders usually know their personal valuation of the item, which is unknown to the other bidders and the seller). Auctions take many forms, but they share the characteristic that they are universal and can be used to sell or buy any item. In many cases, the outcome of the auction does not depend on the identity of the bidders (i.e., auctions are anonymous). Auctions can be in the form of live or online bidding. Most auctions have the feature that participants submit bids, amounts of money they are willing to pay. Standard auctions require that the winner of the auction is the participant with the highest bid. A nonstandard auction does not require this (e.g., a lottery). Types of auction There are traditionally four types of auction that are used for the allocation of a single item: * First-price sealed-bid auction in which bidders place their bid in a sealed envelope and simultaneously hand them to the auctioneer. The envelopes are opened and the individual with the highest bid wins, paying the amount bid. * Second-price sealed-bid auctions (Vickrey auctions) in which bidders place their bid in a sealed envelope and simultaneously hand them to the auctioneer. The envelopes are opened and the individual with the highest bid wins, paying a price equal to the second-highest bid. * Open ascending-bid auctions (English auctions) in which participants make increasingly higher bids, each stopping bidding when they are not prepared to pay more than the current highest bid. This continues until no participant is prepared to make a higher bid; the highest bidder wins the auction at the final amount bid. Sometimes the lot is only actually sold if the bidding reaches a reserve price set by the seller. * Open descending-bid auctions (Dutch auctions) in which the price is set by the auctioneer at a level sufficiently high to deter all bidders, and is progressively lowered until a bidder is prepared to buy at the current price, winning the auction. Most auction theory revolves around these four \\"basic\\" auction types. However, others have also received some academic study (see ).  Benchmark model  The benchmark model for auctions, as defined by McAfee and McMillan (1987), offers a generalization of auction formats, and is based on four assumptions: # All of the bidders are risk- neutral. # Each bidder has a private valuation for the item independently drawn from some probability distribution. # The bidders possess symmetric information. # The payment is represented as a function of only the bids. The benchmark model is often used in tandem with the Revelation Principle, which states that each of the basic auction types is structured such that each bidder has incentive to report their valuation honestly. The two are primarily used by sellers to determine the auction type that maximizes the expected price. This optimal auction format is defined such that the item will be offered to the bidder with the highest valuation at a price equal to their valuation, but the seller will refuse to sell the item if they expect that all of the bidders' valuations of the item are less than their own. Relaxing each of the four main assumptions of the benchmark model yields auction formats with unique characteristics: * Risk-averse bidders incur some kind of cost from participating in risky behaviors, which affects their valuation of a product. In sealed-bid first-price auctions, risk-averse bidders are more willing to bid more to increase their probability of winning, which, in turn, increases their expected utility. This allows sealed-bid first-price auctions to produce higher expected revenue than English and sealed-bid second-price auctions. * In formats with correlated values‚Äîwhere the bidders‚Äô values for the item are not independent‚Äîone of the bidders perceiving their value of the item to be high makes it more likely that the other bidders will perceive their own values to be high. A notable example of this instance is the Winner‚Äôs curse, where the results of the auction convey to the winner that everyone else estimated the value of the item to be less than they did. Additionally, the linkage principle allows revenue comparisons amongst a fairly general class of auctions with interdependence between bidders' values. * The asymmetric model assumes that bidders are separated into two classes that draw valuations from different distributions (e.g., dealers and collectors in an antiques auction). * In formats with royalties or incentive payments, the seller incorporates additional factors, especially those that affect the true value of the item (e.g., supply, production costs, and royalty payments), into the price function. Game-theoretic models A game-theoretic auction model is a mathematical game represented by a set of players, a set of actions (strategies) available to each player, and a payoff vector corresponding to each combination of strategies. Generally, the players are the buyer(s) and the seller(s). The action set of each player is a set of bid functions or reservation prices (reserves). Each bid function maps the player's value (in the case of a buyer) or cost (in the case of a seller) to a bid price. The payoff of each player under a combination of strategies is the expected utility (or expected profit) of that player under that combination of strategies. Game-theoretic models of auctions and strategic bidding generally fall into either of the following two categories. In a private values model, each participant (bidder) assumes that each of the competing bidders obtains a random private value from a probability distribution. In a common value model, the participants have equal valuations of the item, but they do not have perfectly accurate information about this valuation. In lieu of knowing the exact valuation of the item, each participant can assume that any other participant obtains a random signal, which can be used to estimate the true valuation, from a probability distribution common to all bidders. Usually, but not always, a private values model assumes that the values are independent across bidders, whereas a common value model usually assumes that the values are independent up to the common parameters of the probability distribution. A more general category for strategic bidding is the affiliated values model, in which the bidder's total utility depends on both their individual private signal and some unknown common value. Both the private value and common value models can be perceived as extensions of the general affiliated values model. Ex-post equilibrium in a simple auction market.When it is necessary to make explicit assumptions about bidders' value distributions, most of the published research assumes symmetric bidders. This means that the probability distribution from which the bidders obtain their values (or signals) is identical across bidders. In a private values model which assumes independence, symmetry implies that the bidders' values are \\"i.i.d.\\" - independently and identically distributed. An important example (which does not assume independence) is Milgrom and Weber's \\"general symmetric model\\" (1982).Milgrom, P., and R. Weber (1982) \\"A Theory of Auctions and Competitive Bidding,\\" Econometrica Vol. 50 No. 5, pp. 1089‚Äì1122.Because bidders in real- world auctions are rarely symmetric, applied scientists began to research auctions with asymmetric value distributions beginning in the late 1980s. Such applied research often depended on numerical solution algorithms to compute an equilibrium and establish its properties. Preston McAfee and John McMillan (1989) simulated bidding for a government contract in which the cost distribution of domestic firms is different from the cost distribution of the foreign firms (\\"Government Procurement and International Trade,\\" Journal of International Economics, Vol. 26, pp. 291‚Äì308.) One of the publications based on the earliest numerical research is Dalkir, S., J. W. Logan, and R. T. Masson, \\"Mergers in Symmetric and Asymmetric Noncooperative Auction Markets: The Effects on Prices and Efficiency,\\" published in Vol. 18 of The International Journal of Industrial Organization, (2000, pp. 383‚Äì413). Other pioneering research include Tschantz, S., P. Crooke, and L. Froeb, \\"Mergers in Sealed versus Oral Auctions,\\" published in Vol. 7 of The International Journal of the Economics of Business (2000, pp. 201‚Äì213). One of the earlier published theoretical research addressing properties of auctions among asymmetric bidders is Keith Waehrer's 1999 article.K. Waehrer (1999) \\"Asymmetric Auctions With Application to Joint Bidding and Mergers,\\" International Journal of Industrial Organization 17: 437‚Äì452 Later published research include Susan Athey's 2001 Econometrica article,Athey, S. (2001) \\"Single Crossing Properties and the Existence of Pure Strategy Equilibria in Games of Incomplete Information,\\" Econometrica Vol. 69 No. 4, pp. 861‚Äì890. as well as Reny and Zamir (2004).Reny, P., and S. Zamir (2004) \\"On the Existence of Pure Strategy Monotone Equilibria in Asymmetric First-Price Auctions,\\" Econometrica, Vol. 72 No. 4, pp. 1105‚Äì1125. The first formal analysis of auctions was by William Vickrey (1961). Vickrey considers two buyers bidding for a single item. Each buyer's value, v, is an independent draw from a uniform distribution with support [0,1]. Vickrey showed that in the sealed first-price auction it is an equilibrium bidding strategy for each bidder to bid half his valuation. With more bidders, all drawing a value from the same uniform distribution it is easy to show that the symmetric equilibrium bidding strategy is :B(v)=\\\\left(\\\\frac{n-1}{n}\\\\right)v. To check that this is an equilibrium bidding strategy we must show that if it is the strategy adopted by the other n-1 buyers, then it is a best response for buyer 1 to adopt it also. Note that buyer 1 wins with probability 1 with a bid of (n-1)/n so we need only consider bids on the interval [0,(n-1)/n]. Suppose buyer 1 has value v and bids b. If buyer 2's value is x he bids B(x). Therefore, buyer 1 beats buyer 2 if :B(x)=\\\\left(\\\\frac{n-1}{n}\\\\right)x that is x<\\\\left(\\\\frac{n}{n-1}\\\\right)b Since x is uniformly distributed, buyer 1 bids higher than buyer 2 with probability nb/(n-1). To be the winning bidder, buyer 1 must bid higher than all the other bidders (which are bidding independently). Then his win probability is :w(b)=\\\\Pr {{\\\\\\\\{{{b}_{2}} Buyer 1's expected payoff is his win probability times his gain if he wins. That is, :U(b)=w(b)(v-b)={{\\\\left(\\\\frac{n}{n-1}\\\\right)}^{n-1}}{{b}^{n-1}}(v-b)={{\\\\left(\\\\frac{n}{n-1}\\\\right)}^{n-1}}({{b}^{n-1}}v-{{b}^{n}}) It is readily confirmed by differentiation that U(b) takes on its maximum at :B(v)=\\\\left(\\\\frac{n-1}{n}\\\\right)v It is not difficult to show that B(v) is the unique symmetric equilibrium. Lebrun (1996)Lebrun, Bernard (1996) \\"Existence of an equilibrium in first price auctions,\\" Economic Theory, Vol. 7 No. 3, pp. 421‚Äì443. provides a general proof that there are no asymmetric equilibria. Revenue equivalence One of the major findings of auction theory is the revenue equivalence theorem. Early equivalence results focused on a comparison of revenue in the most common auctions. The first such proof, for the case of two buyers and uniformly distributed values was by . In 1979 proved a much more general result. (Quite independently and soon after, this was also derived by ).The revenue equivalence theorem states that any allocation mechanism or auction that satisfies the four main assumptions of the benchmark model will lead to the same expected revenue for the seller (and player i of type v can expect the same surplus across auction types). Relaxing these assumptions can provide valuable insights for auction design. Decision biases can also lead to predictable non-equivalencies. Additionally, if some bidders are known to have a higher valuation for the lot, techniques such as price- discriminating against such bidders will yield higher returns. In other words, if a bidder is known to value the lot at $X more than the next highest bidder, the seller can increase their profits by charging that bidder $X ‚Äì Œî (a sum just slightly inferior to the sum is willing to pay) more than any other bidder (or equivalently a special bidding fee of $X ‚Äì Œî). This bidder will still win the lot, but will pay more than would otherwise be the case. Winner's curse The winner's curse is a phenomenon which can occur in common value settings‚Äîwhen the actual values to the different bidders are unknown but correlated, and the bidders make bidding decisions based on estimated values. In such cases, the winner will tend to be the bidder with the highest estimate, but the results of the auction will show that the remaining bidders' estimates of the item's value are less than that of the winner, giving the winner the impression that they \\"bid too much\\". In an equilibrium of such a game, the winner's curse does not occur because the bidders account for the bias in their bidding strategies. Behaviorally and empirically, however, winner's curse is a common phenomenon, described in detail by Richard Thaler.  Optimal reserve prices  Myerson (1981) has shown that in the case of independent private values, the optimal reserve price does not depend on the number of bidders. For example, suppose there is a single potential buyer whose valuation is uniformly distributed on the interval [0,100]. If the seller can make a take-it-or-leave-it price offer, the optimal price is 50. The reason is that the buyer will buy whenever the buyer‚Äôs valuation v is at least as large as the price p. Since the probability that v is larger than p is given by 100-p percent, the seller‚Äôs expected profit is p¬∑(100-p)/100, which is maximized by p=50. Myerson (1981) proves that the optimal reserve price remains to be 50 in this example, regardless of the number of potential buyers. Bulow and Klemperer (1996) have shown that an auction with n bidders and an optimally chosen reserve price generates a smaller expected profit for the seller than a standard auction with n+1 bidders (and no reserve price).

The show was about two bickering, dimwitted insects, Erky and Perky, who lived at a hot dog stand before they are accidentally taken to a house. The show focuses on Erky and Perky trying to settle into the house, living with fellow housebugs, and the hunt for food in a very clean kitchen. Plot Two bugs, the Scottish-accented Erky, and his friend, the cowardly and impressionable Perky, live an idyllic life on a downtown hot dog stand, a cornucopia of crumbs, relish and wieners. They live the high life until one day they are swept away in a take-out bag and end up in a sterile suburban kitchen with no food in sight. The two bickering, dimwitted and lazy bugs are forced to survive in the new and scary \\"Land of Kitchen\\". Every day, they are obsessed with finding food, and eventually finding their way home to \\"Hot Dog Stand\\". Their quests are almost always befouled by 'Mad' Margaret, the self-appointed ruler of Kitchen, and her 'sidekick' Cecil.  Characters  *Erquhart \\"Erky\\" Windsor (Jason Barr) is a Scottish accented bug who normally takes Perky for granted and makes him try to get food in a dangerous scheme. He is blue with yellow spots. It was revealed in the episode \\"Perky vs. McBuggy Z\\" that he is a natural born rapper and dancer. *Percival \\"Perky\\" Rosendahl (Neil Crone) is Erky's friend and partner. He is very cowardly and very weak. It was made quite obvious that Perky has a crush on Margaret's niece, Sajuica. He is yellow with blue spots. *Cecil (Adrian Truss) appears to be somewhat smitten with the tyrant Margaret, despite being a tenth her size, becoming extremely jealous of her having affairs with newcomer Pablomo, and Erky (when he was under the influence of the Love Crumb). *Mad Margret (Judy Marshak) is the self-appointed ruler of the kitchen, and usually stops Erky and Perky's plans and when they find food, she generally steals it. *Sajuica (Melissa Jane Shaw) is apparently the 'babe' of the kitchen, attracting flies, and being flirty. Even the childish Stinks (named for his flight-inducing farts) thinks she is 'fine'. She fancies Perky. *Frenzel (Ron Rubin): While Stinks may be smart, it's another bug named Frenzel who takes the cake (literally) when it comes to devising food-getting plans. He always has profitable schemes on the go, preying on other bugs' naivet√© or weaknesses to get himself ahead. Often, Perky is the one suffering, being a very gullible and trusting bug. An example of this is when Frenzel was showing young bugs the dangers of Kitchen, and for the final show he tricked Perky into being the German-accented spider, Delilah's 'dinner', not telling the frightened bug that it was all an act, and that there wasn't really any danger (unlike most of Frenzel's plans). *Moldy van Oldy (Keith Knight seasons 1-2, Rob Greenway season 3) is a senile old bug, Moldy van Oldy, who loves to talk and talk for hours, sometimes about actual events, sometimes nothing more than senseless ramblings. One true story he did tell, however, was the tale of Margaret's acquired hydrophobia. When she was about Sajuica's age, and living in an outdoor garden (along with Moldy and presumably other bugs as well), Margaret was sprayed with water from a hose, getting knocked out of the air. *Stinks: (Annick Obonsawin seasons 1-2, Stacey Depass season 3) A running gag is that Stinks would appear whenever anyone said his 'name' (or any other word that sounds similar, such as thinks); often this happens when they are bemoaning some misfortune ('This stinks'). *Delilah (Dana Brooks) is a German-accent spider who tells fortunes. *Boof (Carter Hayden) is Frenzel's assistant; he is a digger bug and was born from an egg that Perky found. *The Grand Armandor (Andrew Pifko) is Margaret's personal wing and purse designer.

Academic career De Grazia was an assistant professor of political science at the University of Minnesota from 1948 to 1950 before joining the political science faculty of Brown University as an associate professor. In 1952, he was appointed director of the Committee for Research in the Social Sciences at Stanford University, supported by a Ford Foundation grant. He wrote the textbook The Elements of Political Science in two volumes: Political Behavior and Political Organization (1952).Ranking 47th of 161 in 2014, Journal Citation Reports (Thomson Reuters, 2015, 62 years after publication One reviewer of it wrote: \\"Mr. De Grazia has undertaken to dissect the whole body of political science...

He left the institution in 1957. From 1959 to 1983, he was a professor of government and social theory at New York University. Reproduced in In 1957 de Grazia founded PROD: Political Research: Organization and Design, which was described as \\"probably...the authentic spokesman for the newest currents among the avant-garde of political behavior\\".Dahl, Robert A.

(1967) Congress and the Presidency: their Role in Modern Times American Enterprise Institute Support for Velikovsky de Grazia (right) and Immanuel Velikovsky in 1964 De Grazia became interested in Immanuel Velikovsky's catastrophist theories. Following considerable criticism of Velikovsky's claims by the scientific community, de Grazia dedicated the entire September 1963 issue of American Behavioral Scientist to the issue.Polanyi, Michael \\"Lecture 4: Myths, ancient and modern\\", Lecture at University of Chicago Spring 1969.

He also self-published two books on it, The Velikovsky Affair: The Warfare of Science and Scientism and Cosmic Heretics: A Personal History of Attempts to Establish and Resist Theories of Quantavolution and Catastrophe in the Natural and Human Sciences. Michael Polanyi stated: In a review of the second book, Henry Bauer suggests that de Grazia's efforts may be responsible for Velikovsky's continuing notability. In both books de Grazia subscribes to the thesis that, in the words of Henry Bauer, \\"the affair revealed something seriously rotten in the state of science\\". The review however suggests that the rejection came about ... The review further suggests that \\"de Grazia does not understand how the content of science is generated\\" and that his \\"understanding of science as a social activity is ambiguous.\\" In the second book, de Grazia upholds Velikovsky's most general claim, that geologically recent (in the last 15,000 years) extraterrestrially-caused catastrophes occurred, and had a significant impact on the Earth and its inhabitants. De Grazia terms this belief \\"Quantavolution\\". Later career In the early 1970s, de Grazia founded the \\"University of the New World\\" in Haute-Nendaz Switzerland, as an unstructured alternative to American universities. He invited Beat author William S. Burroughs to teach at it. In his biography of Burroughs, Ted Morgan described the students that it attracted as \\"drifters and dropouts on the international hippie circuit\\"; he suggested that this resulted in a culture clash with the \\"prim Swiss\\", and that the university lacked adequate facilities or a sound business model. In 2002, de Grazia was appointed visiting professor in the Department of Mathematics, Statistics, Computing and Applications of the University of Bergamo in Italy.unibg.it Staff entry He had previously been a visiting lecturer at the University of Rome, the University of Bombay, the University of Istanbul, and the University of Gothenburg in Sweden.

After working in radio and serving two years in the Australian Army, at age 23 he became host of the children's television series Smalltime. His appearances in this show and his writing for other Australian comedy shows was recognised by visiting Canadian and American producers, and Bearde was contracted by the Canadian commercial network CTV to write a comedy series in the early 1960s, entitled Network. He created two shows for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Front and Centre and Canada's first late night political satire show Nightcap. Move to Hollywood After four years of working in Canadian radio and television, Bearde was signed by the William Morris Agency and moved to Hollywood. There he created formats for several specials for NBC and ABC. Bearde's method of combining slapstick and political satire made him a resident writer on the original Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In. While working with the producer of Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In, George Schlatter, Bearde created the formats for specials, including Dinah Shore's Like Hep! (1969), and The Grammy Awards. In 1968, he formed a partnership with Canadian producer Allan Blye and they created the format for the 1968 TV special Singer Presents Elvis for producer Bob Finkel and director Steve Binder. Bearde and Blye co-produced several specials for Andy Williams and produced two years of The Andy Williams Show from 1969-71. Blye and Bearde also created a summer series, The Who Is Ray Stevens Show, which featured the first appearance of Steve Martin. Blye and Bearde also created and produced one of the first black situation comedies, That's My Mama, for ABC. After splitting with Blye, Bearde created the format of ‚Äî and produced with Chuck Barris ‚Äî The Bobby Vinton Show and the first major breakthrough talent reality television show, The Gong Show. Although Bearde later sold his interest in the 1970s version of the program to Barris, Bearde's company produced a one-season revival of the show in 1988. He also produced The Bob Hope Christmas Show and returned to Australia to produce Texaco Presents Bob Hope in Australia. Bearde formed a partnership with ex-CBS president Robert Wood and created pilots and a children's series, The W.A.C.K.O. Show, for CBS. Bearde directed a comedy film called Hysterical, released in 1983, starring The Hudson Brothers. Bearde formed a long-term partnership with Dick Clark and produced The Half Hour Comedy Hour, which featured the first national appearance of Arsenio Hall as a host. Clark and Bearde co-produced Bearde's lip sync hit series Puttin' on the Hits in 1985. Bearde formed a co-production partnership with Vin Di Bona, the producer of America's Funniest Home Videos. He created and produced HBO's cult series satirizing television news Night Rap and Showtime's comedy hit Sherman Oaks. Di Bona and Bearde also produced several specials for CBS. Move to Las Vegas In 2005, Bearde moved his operation to Las Vegas and created and trademarked \\"Chris Bearde's International Comedy Hall of Fame\\", a entertainment retail restaurant and comedy tribute exhibition complex, currently in the design and planning stages. Each year there are several Comedy Awards and Induction Ceremony TV specials included in the package. Bearde has received an Emmy Award, and a Writers Guild of America Award. The Chris Bearde School of Comedy was founded in Las Vegas in 2007 and moved to Los Angeles in 2008. The school is still in operation.Notice of death of Chris Bearde, deadline.com; accessed 7 May 2017. Death Bearde died at his home in Westlake Village, California of a cardiac arrest on 23 April 2017 at the age of 80. He is survived by his wife Carolyn Stonelcoud, 6 children, 2 step children and 7 grandchildren.

Taxonomy and history The genus was first described in 1885 by American arachnologists George and Elizabeth Peckham based on the type species Zygoballus rufipes. The name derives from a combination of the Ancient Greek word Œ∂œÖŒ≥œåŒΩ (zygon), meaning \\"yoke\\", and the genus name Ballus. The etymology of Ballus is unknown, but may be related to the Greek word Œ≤Œ±ŒªŒªŒØŒ∂œâ (ballizo), meaning \\"dance\\" or \\"jump about\\". The genus Messua, based on the type species Messua desidiosa, was synonymized with Zygoballus by Eug√®ne Simon in 1903. Simon argued that Messua desidiosa was a transitional species which differed \\"much less from typical Zygoballus than would seem to be indicated by [the Peckham's] description.\\" This synonymy was reversed by Wayne Maddison in 1996, and Messua restored as a valid genus. The genus Amerotritte, based on the type species Amerotritte lineata, was synonymized with Zygoballus in 1980 by Mar√≠a Elena Galiano. Galiano stated that the holotype of Amerotritte lineata was actually a very young Zygoballus specimen. Zygoballus is currently classified in the subtribe Dendryphantina of the family Salticidae (jumping spiders). Description Female Zygoballus rufipes jumping spider from Laurens County, South Carolina Spiders of the genus Zygoballus share a strong resemblance in appearance. The cephalothorax is high and roughly square when viewed from above. It is widest at the posterior eyes, with the ocular quadrangle occupying approximately three-fifths of the cephalothorax. The cephalothorax slopes steeply behind the posterior eyes and the sides of the cephalothorax are nearly vertical. The labium is as long or longer than it is wide. The anterior (first) pair of legs are the largest, with three pairs of spines on the ventral surface of the tibia. Males have obliquely oriented chelicerae with long fangs. Many species exhibit wide variation in color, size, and markings. Distribution Zygoballus is a genus from the New World, ranging from Argentina to Canada. Three species from India were originally placed in Zygoballus, but have been reassigned to other genera. Species , the World Spider Catalog accepted the species listed below. One species, Z. quaternus, was previously recognized (prior to 2008), but is now considered a nomen dubium. Several other species are known only from single specimens. In addition to the species listed below, a 2001 phylogenetic analysis suggested that Rhetenor texanus may also belong in Zygoballus, but this has not been accepted by the World Spider Catalog. * Zygoballus amrishi Makhan, 2005 ‚Äî Suriname * Zygoballus aschnae Makhan, 2005 ‚Äî Suriname * Zygoballus concolor Bryant, 1940 ‚Äî Cuba * Zygoballus electus Chickering, 1946 ‚Äî Panama * Zygoballus gracilipes Crane, 1945 ‚Äî Guyana, Argentina * Zygoballus incertus (Banks, 1929) ‚Äî Panama * Zygoballus iridescens Banks, 1895 ‚Äî USA * Zygoballus lineatus (Mello-Leit√£o, 1944) ‚Äî Argentina * Zygoballus maculatipes Petrunkevitch, 1925 ‚Äî Panama * Zygoballus maculatus F.

The agency was founded by the theoretical physicist Professor Yuval Ne'eman in 1983 to replace the National Committee for Space Research which was established in 1960 to set up the infrastructure required for space missions. The agency is currently headed by Professor Isaac Ben Israel as Chairman and Avi Blasberger as Director General. Today, Israel is the smallest country with indigenous launch capabilities, and is the smallest country to have a space program.  History  The Israel Space Agency has history dating back to the late 1950s. NCSR and foreign reliance The Israeli Space Agency originated as a university-based research project from Tel Aviv University in the early 1960s. In 1960, the National Committee for Space Research (NCSR) was formed by the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities. The committee was formed to increase research activities across the academic communities in Israel. While at the time establishing a space program was not particularly one of its goals, during the '60s through the late '70s, the committee developed the infrastructure needed for research and development in space exploration and sciences. One of the NCSR's earliest achievements took place in 1961 with the launch of its first two-stage rocket. Following political tension with Egypt and Syria, reconnaissance flights became evermore difficult. In 1979, a satellite program was proposed followed by a year of feasibility study. The study was completed by late 1980; Saguy requested from prime minister Menachem Begin that the project proceed to its next phase. In 1982, a new recommendation called \\"Ofeq Program\\" was submitted for developing an observation satellite. The program included timelines, planning for a ground station, budget estimates, and personnel requirements. The primary goal was to develop a satellite program without relying on any foreign know-how, to allow flexibility and creativity. The launcher would be developed by Malam, the two engines by the Israel Military Industries (IMI), and the third by Rafael.  Establishment of a space agency  At the end of 1982 it was decided during a closed-door meeting to establish an Israeli space agency. The decision was made by PM Menachem Begin, Defense minister Ariel Sharon, and former director Aharon Beit Halahmi. The initial goal was to pursue the program to develop to Ofeq and the Shavit launchers. In January 1983, the Israeli government authorized the Minister of Science and Technology Prof. Yuval Ne'eman to establish an Israeli Space Agency with the goal of advancing Israel's space program, unlike the NCSR which was primarily used for feasibility and infrastructure studies. In July 1983, the ISA was officially founded in Tel Aviv to coordinate the nation's space program in affiliation to the Ministry of Science, Culture & Sport, and Professor Dror Sadeh was nominated to be its Director-General. In 1982, the Israel Space Agency was created, which is responsible for coordinating the space program of Israel. The following year, the new head of military intelligence, Ehud Barak, suspended all work, and advocated the winding down of all projects, and planned to transfer the released financial resources to fulfill more priority tasks, he said. But his opinion did not become dominant in the defense department, and in 1984, Defense Minister Moshe Arens insisted on resuming the program. In 1984 the National Space Knowledge Center was established in cooperation with Israel Aircraft Industries; a contract was signed between IAI and Ministry of Defence for the development of the needed infrastructure and of Israel's first observation satellite. This came to fruition in 1988 when Israel launched the first in a series of Ofeq satellites and thus became one of only a few nations in the world possessing an indigenous space launching capability (see timeline of first orbital launches by country). The project management at Israel Aircraft Industries was headed for many years by Dr. Moshe Bar-Lev.  Vision  The agency vision as defined by the guiding committee on July 27, 2005 states: \\"Space research and exploration is an essential instrument for the defense of life on Earth; the lever for technological progress; the key to existing in a modern society; essential for developing an economy based on knowledge; and the central attraction for scientific and qualified human resources.\\" The vision is \\"to preserve and broaden the comparative advantage of Israel and to place it among the group of leading countries in the space research and exploration area.\\" The main goals for vision realization are: * To build and to support satellite systems for space research and for Earth research from space. * To develop technologies, knowledge and scientific infrastructure (including laboratories and human resources) required for space research. * To promote international cooperation in space research and exploration, and for strengthening the national interests of Israel. * To promote ties between Israeli society, space research, and exploration. ISA has signed cooperation agreements with the space agencies of: United States (NASA), France (CNES), Canada (CSA), India (ISRO), Italy (ASI), Germany (DLR), Ukraine (NSAU), Russia (RKA), Netherlands (NIVR) and Brazil (AEB).  Budget  In 2010, the budget of the Israel Space Agency was increased to US $80 million to boost the agency's space activities in research and development. The budget does not include launch vehicle development and most satellite programs. Typically such programs get funded on a project-by-project basis. For example, Project Venus, a cooperative program by Israel (ISA) and France (CNES) which is set to launch in 2014 has a $50 million budget. The Spaceborne Hyperspectral Applicative Land and Ocean Mission (SHALOM), a joint mission by Israel (ISA) and the Italy Space Agency (ASI) has a budget of $116 million. The budget allocated annually for the Israeli military program as well as commercial programs are managed on different budgets. Satellite programs The Israel Space Agency has had a long history of satellite programs both for reconnaissance and commercial purposes. Its first satellite, the Ofeq-1 was launched on September 19, 1988, from Palmachim Airbase in Israel. Since the launching of that first satellite, Israel has developed into a significant player in the commercial space arena. Today, the ISA satellite launches include: * Ofeq ‚Äì Series of reconnaissance satellites. The first of these was launched from the Palmachim site on September 19, 1988. * Amos ‚Äì Series of communications satellites * Eros ‚Äì Series of observation satellites * Techsat ‚Äì Researching satellite launched by the Technion * TechSAR ‚Äì a SAR-based observation satellite. Ofeq Satellite Series Ofeq-3 After the successful launch of the Ofeq-1 in 1988, additional satellites were developed. In 1989, the ISA launched the Ofeq-2; in April 1995, it took a leap forward with the launch of Ofeq-3, which carried an advanced electro-optical payload built by Israeli industry for local purposes. Ofeq-3 has been functioning without a hitch. Following a setback with Ofeq-4, Ofeq-5 was successfully launched in May 2002. To date, twelve such satellites in the Ofeq reconnaissance satellites series were developed and launched to Low Earth Orbit. The most recent, Ofek 16, was launched July 6, 2020. Amos Satellite Series The Amos is a series of communications satellites. The Amos satellites are by the Israel Aerospace Industries and are operated by Spacecom once in orbit. The Amos-1, the first satellite in the series, was launched on May 16, 1996 using a French-built vehicle. Since then, 4 more satellites were launched. The most recent Amos satellite is the Amos-5 which was launched on December 11, 2011. The Amos is distinguished for its light weight and sophisticated technology. The Amos-6 was due to be launched in 2016 in order to replace the Amos-2 which was then ceasing operation, but it was destroyed in a launchpad explosion. EROS Satellite Series EROS-B Satellite The Earth Resources Observation Satellite (EROS) is a series of commercial observation satellites. The first satellite, the EROS A, was launched on December 5, 2000 from Svobodny Launch Complex using a Russian Start-1. A second satellite, the EROS B, was launched on April 25, 2006. The EROS series are set to be launched once every 6 to 8 years. The EROS C is set to be launched in late 2014. TechSAR Satellite The TechSAR satellite is a reconnaissance satellite equipped with a synthetic aperture radar. The satellite is designed penetrate thick clouds by being fitted with a large dish-like antenna to transmit and receive radar signals. The satellite was successfully launched on January 21, 2008. Launch capabilities Shavit Rocket Shavit launcher The Israel Space Agency is one of only seven countries that both build their own satellites and launch their own launchers. The Shavit is a space launch vehicle capable of sending payload into low earth orbit. The Shavit launcher has been used to send every Ofeq satellite to date. The development of the Shavit began in 1983 and its operational capabilities were proven on three successful launches of the Ofek satellites on September 19, 1988; April 3, 1990; and April 5, 1995. The Shavit launchers allows low- cost and high-reliability launch of micro/mini satellites to a Low Earth Orbit. The Shavit launcher is developed by Malam factory, one of four factories in the IAI Electronics Group. The factory is very experienced in development, assembling, testing and operating system for use in space. The Shavit is a triple-stage launcher solid propellant booster based on the 2-stage Jericho-II ballistic missile. The first and second stage engines are manufactured by Ta'as, and use solid fuel. The third stage engines are manufactured by Rafael Advanced Defense Systems. The next generation Shavit rockets, now called the Shavit-2 are being developed. The Shavit-2 is said to be made available for commercial launches in the near future. Palmachim Spaceport The Israel Space Agency operates the spaceport located in Palmachim Air Force Base. Due to Israel's geographic location and hostile relations with surrounding countries, launches take off due west, over the Mediterranean Sea. This is done in order to avoid flying over hostile territories. This is also to prevent possible debris from falling above populated areas. This limitation imposes a penalty of roughly 30% on its lifting capabilities. Some of the recent ISA launches include: * June 11, 2007 ‚Äì Ofeq 7 satelliteIsrael Launches New Spy Satellite, www.spacewar.com, accessed 12 June 2007 * June 22, 2010 ‚Äì Ofeq 9 satelliteIsrael Launches Ofeq-9 Satellite * April 10, 2014 ‚Äì Ofeq 10 satellite * September 13, 2016 ‚Äì Ofeq 11 satellite * July 6, 2020 ‚Äì Ofeq 16 satellite Space research The ISA is responsible for funding a large set of university research projects and governmental projects. The goal is to boost space related research and development in the academic arena. The Israel Space Agency strives to promote space research and space technology development as a part of the effort to promote the Israeli scientific research. National Knowledge Center on NEOs The smaller 46cm Telescope in the Wise Observatory dome. The ISA and the Ministry of Science and Technology formed and operated the National Knowledge Center on Near Earth Objects at Tel Aviv University in order to study minor bodies in the Solar System. The goal is to map the objects which pose a threat to earth and to find a solution to eliminate them. This center is headed by Dr. Noah Brosch from Tel Aviv University and operates the three telescopes of the Wise Observatory. For the purpose of NEO studies, a special wide-field 0.46-m telescope was acquired by Tel Aviv University and is operating at the Wise Observatory located near Mitzpe Ramon. The telescope facilitated the discovery of several tens of new asteroids and is now intensely used to study asteroid rotation and asteroid pair properties. Following the cessation of funding from ISA, the asteroid studies are continuing at the Wise Observatory with no specific financial support. Israel Cosmic Ray Center The Israel Cosmic Ray Center (ICRC) was established in November 1997 with support from the Israel Space Agency and with affiliation to Tel Aviv University and the Technion. The center is located on Mount Hermon and headed by Dr. Gideon Bela and Prof. Lev Dorman from the Tel Aviv University. The goal of the center is to monitor and forecast dangerous meteorological and space phenomena. This includes solar radiation storms and shockwaves between very powerful stars creating magnetic storms. These phenomena can endanger electronic systems in satellites and space shuttles, the astronauts' health, electronic and navigational systems in aircraft flying in extremely high altitudes and ground power systems. The Emilio Segre' Observatory (ESOI) is a cosmic radiation observatory prepared via a joint collaboration with Italy. It was transported to Mount Hermon, Israel in June 1998. The observatory was named after the Italian physicist and Nobel laureate Emilio G. Segr√®. EOSDIS ISA-MEIDA The Israel Space Agency - Middle East Interactive Data Archive (ISA-MEIDA) is an Israeli node for NASA's EOSDIS (Earth Observing System Data and Information System). The Node was established in October 1996 as a part of the cooperation agreement between the director of NASA and the director of ISA. It is the only team in the country which focuses on collecting and preserving environmental information in Israel. The ISA-MEIDA was established in order to create and maintain an Earth observing data center available through the Internet to the research community and to the general public free of charge. This research, headed by Prof. Pinhas Alpert, is funded by the ISA as a part of the Space Scientific and Technological Infrastructure Development program. The node is integrated with NASA's global Information System which includes Earth Observing Science Data and Information System. It also contains Remote Sensing Data from NASA and NOAA satellites, and data from other sources such as meteorological RADAR and readings from meteorological stations. Information collected by the system is critical for environmental and water related research, especially in light of the drastic global environmental changes and global warming. Tel Aviv University Ultraviolet Explorer The Tel Aviv University Ultraviolet Explorer (TAUVEX) is a space telescope array conceived by Noah Brosch of Tel Aviv University. It was eventually designed and constructed for the University by El-Op. TAUVEX is a cluster of three bore-sighted 20-cm telescopes for observation in the ultra-violet funded by the Israel Space Agency. It was due to be launched by India on board the ISRO satellite GSAT-4 satellite but due to a mis-match between the capabilities of the launched and the mass of the satellite, ISRO decided unilaterally to remove TAUVEX from GSAT-4. The telescope ended up in a limbo of constant delays. In 2012 ISA decided to terminate the TAUVEX project. TechSat-Gurwin Microsatellite The Gurwin TechSat was one of the world's first Microsatellite to be designed, built and launched by students. The satellite, developed by the Technion, was launched on July 10, 1998. The satellite was a great success, operating for over 11 years - setting a world record for the longest university satellite mission. The mission was completed in April 2010. Sloshsat-FLEVO The Sloshsat- FLEVO was a satellite launched for the study of liquid sloshing phenomena in space. The satellite was developed in collaboration between the Dutch NLR labs, Fokker Space, and Rafael. The satellite is helped by the Israel Space Agency and the European Space Agency (ESA). The Israel Space Agency initiated the project and partly funded it by supplying the sub-propulsion system. The propulsion system, funded by the ISA, is fueled by cold gas and is constructed of four high-pressure canisters with pyrotechnic activation. The system can produce both linear acceleration and torque needed to perform slosh research. It is specifically designed to overcome the severe volume constraints encountered in typical satellites. Ongoing development The Israel Space Agency is currently involved with multiple satellites, space telescopes, and microsatellites. VEN¬µS The Vegetation and Environment monitoring on a New Micro-Satellite (VEN¬µS) is a satellite to be used for Earth observation using a superspectral sensor, dedicated to vegetation monitoring. It is the first cooperation between Israel (ISA) and France (CNES). VEN¬µS scientific objective is \\"the provision of data for scientific studies dealing with the monitoring, analysis, and modeling of land surface functioning under the influences of environmental factors as well as human activities.\\" The Israel Space Agency is responsible for the spacecraft, the launcher interface, and for the satellite control center. The Centre national d'√©tudes spatiales is responsible for supplying the superspectral camera and the science mission center. The satellite is set to launch in mid 2017. OPsat OPsat is a next generation high resolution optical observation satellite for reconnaissance purposes. It is designed to be a satellite capable of detecting objects of about 50 centimeters in diameter. It will be equipped with a camera with CCD/TDI sensors, producing both panchromatic imagery at a very high resolution and multispectral imagery at a medium resolution. The satellite is set to orbit in a sun-synchronous orbit. It is expected to have a lifespan of roughly 10 years. ULTRASAT The ULTRASAT satellite (previously known as LIMSAT-UV) is a wide field (~1000 deg2) transient explorer satellite mission. ULTRASAT is planned to have eight telescopes equipped with CCD cameras and reflective filters. It is set to have a sensitivity 10 times lower than GALEX but a field of view more than 1000 times larger. It is also planned to have a detection rate for transient in the UV of more than 30 times greater than that of GALEX. The ULTRASAT is planned to be developed in just 3‚Äì4 years and at a cost of a few tens of millions of dollars instead of a few hundreds of millions. ULTRASAT will observe a large patch of sky, more than 200 square degrees, alternating every six months between the southern and northern hemisphere. The satellite will orbit the Earth from an altitude of about 300 km above the geosynchronous orbit, getting a ‚Äòride‚Äô as a secondary payload in the fairing of the rocket carrying a communications satellite. A joint American-Israeli proposal for this project was submitted to NASA by a team from Caltech/JPL (Jet Propulsion Laboratory), the Weizmann Institute of Science and Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI). The Israeli contribution will be funded by the Israel Space AgencyIsrael Space Agency, ‚ÄúULTRASAT project‚Äù and launch is expected before 2021. INSAT-1 & INSAT-2 The INSAT-1 and the INSAT-2 are two nano-satellites currently being planned and developed by the Israeli Nano Satellite Association. Their purpose is to test new industrial components under real outer-space conditions before being installed on satellites costing tens and hundreds of millions of dollars. The INSAT-1 is set to carry a miniature atomic clock and a GPS receiver. SHALOM Project The SHALOM Project (Spaceborne Hyperspectral Applicative Land and Ocean Mission) is a joint project with the Italian Space Agency (ASI) announced on November 23, 2010. The project involves the design and development of two hyperspectral Earth observation satellites. They are set to follow the same orbit as the Cosmo SkyMed. It will integrate radar observations with observations in the visible infrared and ultraviolet. In October 2015 a memorandum of understanding was signed, and the system is slated to become fully operational in 2021.http://space.gov.il/en/node/1144 The project is expected to cost over $200 million, with the cost being split evenly between the two countries. SAMSON Space Autonomous Mission of Swarming & geolocating Nano-Satellites (SAMSON) is a project initiated by the Technion's Asher Space Research Institute. SAMSON consists of three nano-satellites in formation flying to demonstrate high precision geo-location of civilian signals from the ground for rescue purposes. SAMSON is planned to implement and demonstrate Technion-developed formation-flying algorithms using the nano- satellite's propulsion system. This is a student project with technical help from multiple partners in the industry such as RAFAEL.  Matroshka AstroRad Radiation Experiment  Configuration of the anthropomorphic phantoms inside the Orion Payload. The Matroshka AstroRad Radiation Experiment (MARE) is a collaboration between the ISA, NASA, and the German Aerospace Center (DLR), in cooperation with Lockheed Martin and StemRad. MARE will take place aboard the Artemis 1 Orion Spacecraft, which is expected to launch from Kennedy Space Center between 2020‚Äì2021. The radiation environment beyond Earth's protective atmosphere is a significant impediment to human space travel. The AstroRad is a protective vest that provides mobile shielding from high energy radiation. MARE offers a unique opportunity to measure tissue dose deposition and test the effectiveness of the AstroRad vest when exposed to the harsh radiation beyond low Earth orbit. The crew compartment of the unmanned Artemis 1 Orion spacecraft will include two female anthropomorphic phantoms that will be exposed to the intense radiation environment during the spacecraft's lunar orbit. One phantom will be shielded by the AstroRad vest and the other will be left unprotected as a control. The phantoms, designed by DLR, precisely measure radiation exposure not only at the surface of the body but also at the locations corresponding to sensitive internal organs and tissues in humans. Manned programs While the ISA has not yet made a human spaceflight of its own, since the mid-1990s there has been a cooperation agreement between the Israel Space Agency and NASA which has resulted in one Israeli astronaut on a NASA mission to date. Ilan Ramon Ilan Ramon - the first Israeli astronaut Ilan Ramon was Israel's first astronaut. Ramon was the space shuttle payload specialist on board the fatal STS-107 mission of Space Shuttle Columbia, in which he and the six other crew members were killed in a re-entry accident over southern Texas. Ramon had been selected as a Payload Specialist in 1997 and trained at the Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, from 1998 until 2003, for a mission with a payload that included a multispectral camera for recording desert aerosol (dust).Payload Specialist Astronaut Bio: Ilan Ramon, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Retrieved 2009-12-05 Ilan Ramon International annual Space Conference The Ilan Ramon annual International Space Conference is a living tribute to Israel's first astronaut, the late Colonel Ilan Ramon. The Fisher Brothers Institute for Air & Space Strategic Studies has been holding the annual conference since 2006. The conference is designed to bring together the Israel's space community and international peers. Over the years, the conference has been drawing distinguished scientists, head of space agencies, and global prominent figures. Experiments via NASA shuttles The ISA has conducted a number of experiments, both manned and unmanned, in collaboration with NASA using the space shuttle. In October 1996, NASA and ISA signed an agreement for joint cooperation in the peaceful use of space - an agreement designed to develop cooperative programs of mutual interest between the two nations. Israeli Space Agency Investigation About Hornets The Israeli Space Agency Investigation About Hornets (ISAIAH) was project form Tel Aviv University that was initiated in the early 1990s to explorer the effects of near-zero gravity on oriental hornets, their physical and physiological development and their nest-building instincts. The flight hardware and measuring instruments were commissioned by the ISA and built by ISI. The hope of the mission was to discover ways to prevent astronauts from suffering headaches, nausea, and vomiting during the missions. In 1992, 230 Oriental hornets, a flight hardware and measuring instruments were packed onto the Space Shuttle Endeavour mission STS-47. The Oriental Hornets used in the experiment were capable of building combs in the direction of the gravitational vector and detecting gravitational force changes in real time. Early development of embryos in microgravity The early development of mice embryos in microgravity was a Hebrew University experiment designed to determine if mice embryo cells could develop normally in microgravity conditions in space. The outcome of the experiment was expected to help the understanding of early embryo cell development which would provide an insight into the possibilities of human reproduction in space. The payload was launched in 1996 on board Space Shuttle Columbia mission STS-80. On the same mission, a second experiment investigating the growth of osteoblast cells in microgravity environment was also conducted. During STS-80 osteoblast cultures were grown in microgravity, using specialized hardware. The space-grown osteoblastic cells were then compared with the Earth-grown osteoblastic cells. The research revealed numerous changes between the two cells. The microgravity cells showed lower proliferation rate, a lower metabolism and an altered cell structure. A continuation from the osteoblast cells experiment was later expanded upon by astronaut John Glenn on board Space Shuttle Discovery, STS-95. The tests included the thinning effect of space on mouse bones. Additionally the process of calcium loss in the mouse bone was later compared to what happened in Glenn's body and effectiveness of a calcium-vitamin D supplement against osteoporosis. MEIDEX MEIDEX Seal The 2003 Mediterranean Israeli Dust Experiment (MEIDEX) was a Dust Experiment initiated by the ISA. The experiment was planned by a team from the Department of Geophysics and Planetary Sciences in Tel Aviv University. The objective was to study the temporal and spatial distribution and physical properties of atmospheric desert dust over North Africa, the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Saharan regions. The aim was achieved by a remote sensing experiment operated by the astronaut Ilan Ramon aboard the Space Shuttle Columbia. Moon mission The Israeli Space Agency has sponsored the first Israeli effort to land a spacecraft on the moon. Additionally the ISA has been collaborating with NASA about future lunar research programs. Israel Network for Lunar Science and Exploration The Israel Network for Lunar Science and Exploration (INLSE) program was established by the Israeli Space Agency part of an international effort to study the moon and the solar system. In January 2010 a joint declaration by NASA and Israel Space Agency was signed making Israel a member of the NASA Center for Moon Research and promote cooperation between the two agencies. The INLSE hopes to bring its technical and engineering expertise for the sake of advancing the broad goals of lunar science at the institute. The agreement offers NASA important research involving lasers, the development of advanced sensors for solar system research tasks and automatic vehicle navigation. SpaceIL The SpaceIL is a Non-governmental organization made up of multidisciplinary team of Israeli scientists and space aficionados. The organization was formed to compete in the international Google Lunar X Prize competition. The SpaceIL team is developing a robotic spacecraft, built as a Microsatellite, weighing around 500 kg. It is designed to be launched and then land on the moon bearing the Israeli flag. To win, they must be the first to launch, fly, and land the spacecraft on the moon then transmit live video feed back to earth. If the team wins, they intend on donating the prize, about $30 million, toward space education. Commercial and industry involvement The Israel Space Agency, Israeli industry, and the academy are all heavily involved in all the different stages of planning, development, construction, launching, and operating of space programs. The main contractors of the Ofeq and Eros space programs is the IAI Mabat factory in Yehud. The Mabat facility is responsible for the experiment and integration center, the ground monitoring, and the control stations and the remote satellites receiving stations. Many of the high-tech companies are involved in the various space programs in Israel, and in manufacturing sub-systems and components. The TAUVEX was spun off as DAVID, a small telescope with a resolution of about five meters. It is currently being developed jointly by an Israeli hi-tech firm and a German firm. Many smaller university related commercial products are being developed across the state. Industrial groups In addition to university research, a number of large industrial groups are heavily involved with the Israel Space Agency. IAI The Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) is Israel's prime aerospace and aviation manufacturer, producing aerial systems for both military and civilian usage. IAI entered the space race in the 1990s and has since been responsible for the development of most Israel's civilian and military satellites, particularly the Amos and Ofeq. Elbit Systems El-Op, which merged with Elbit Systems in 2000, is the country's largest research and development company for space qualified cameras and advanced telescopes that deal with various panchromatic, dual band, multi and super spectral wavelength applications. It is Israel's Center of Excellence for space electro-optics. Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Rafael Advanced Defense Systems is the Israeli authority for development of weapons and military technology. They are responsible for most the ISA's spacecraft propulsion systems.

Originally leasing space from the Highland Presbyterian Church, the church was officially chartered on September 27, 1908, with 80 original members. In 1914, the church absorbed members of the then-defunct Central Baptist Church, soon growing to almost 500 members. In 1916 the church purchased land at the southwest corner of 22nd Street and Guadalupe Street to construct a church building. Philadelphia architect Albert Kelsey designed the structure in the Spanish Colonial Revival style to match the University of Texas buildings across the street. It was built to house 1,100 people and was an immediate cornerstone of the \\"Drag\\" (Guadalupe Street). The church welcomed African Americans as members in 1943, becoming one of the first integrated churches in the Southern Baptist Convention. The church was expelled from the Austin Baptist Association for doing so (though it was later readmitted). The church earned further notoriety in the 1970s when it began ordaining women as deacons. In 1995, the church was again expelled from the Austin Baptist Association for ordaining a gay men as deacon. The church stood by its position, and in 1997, for this and other reasons, the church voted to disaffiliate itself with the Southern Baptist Convention. In recent years the church has become known for its welcoming stance toward homosexuals and has joined several like-minded church organizations.

EpoR is a 52kDa peptide with a single carbohydrate chain resulting in a n approximately 56-57 kDa protein found on the surface of EPO responding cells. It is a member of the cytokine receptor family. EpoR pre- exists as dimers which upon binding of a 30 kDa ligand erythropoietin (Epo), changes its homodimerized state. These conformational changes result in the autophosphorylation of Jak2 kinases that are pre-associated with the receptor (i.e., EpoR does not possess intrinsic kinase activity and depends on Jak2 activity). At present, the most well-established function of EpoR is to promote proliferation and rescue of erythroid (red blood cell) progenitors from apoptosis.  Function and mechanism of action  Murine Epo Receptor truncations and known functions. Erythroid differentiation depends on transcriptional regulator GATA1. EpoR is thought to contribute to differentiation via multiple signaling pathways including the STAT5 pathway. In erythropoiesis, EpoR is best known for inducing survival of progenitors. The cytoplasmic domains of the EpoR contain a number of phosphotyrosines that are phosphorylated by Jak2 and serve as docking sites for a variety of intracellular pathway activators and Stats (such as Stat5). In addition to activating Ras/AKT and ERK/MAP kinase, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathway and STAT transcription factors, phosphotyrosines also serve as docking sites for phosphatases that negatively affect EpoR signaling in order to prevent overactivation that may lead to such disorders as erythrocytosis. In general, the defects in the erythropoietin receptor may produce erythroleukemia and familial erythrocytosis. Mutations in Jak2 kinases associated with EpoR can also lead to polycythemia vera.  Erythroid survival  Primary role of EpoR is to promote proliferation of erythroid progenitor cells and rescue erythroid progenitors from cell death. EpoR induced Jak2-Stat5 signaling, together with transcriptional factor GATA-1, induces the transcription of pro-survival protein Bcl-xL. Additionally, EpoR has been implicated in suppressing expression of death receptors Fas, Trail and TNFa that negatively affect erythropoiesis. Based on current evidence, it is still unknown whether Epo/EpoR directly cause \\"proliferation and differentiation\\" of erythroid progenitors in vivo, although such direct effects have been described based on in vitro work.  Erythroid differentiation  It is thought that erythroid differentiation is primarily dependent on the presence and induction of erythroid transcriptional factors such as GATA-1, FOG-1 and EKLF, as well as the suppression of myeloid/lymphoid transcriptional factors such as PU.1. Direct and significant effects of EpoR signaling specifically upon the induction of erythroid-specific genes such as beta-globin, have been mainly elusive. It is known that GATA-1 can induce EpoR expression. In turn, EpoR's PI3-K/AKT signaling pathway augments GATA-1 activity.  Erythroid cell cycle/proliferation  Induction of proliferation by the EpoR is likely cell type-dependent. It is known that EpoR can activate mitogenic signaling pathways and can lead to cell proliferation in erythroleukemic cell lines in vitro, various non-erythroid cells, and cancer cells. So far, there is no sufficient evidence that in vivo, EpoR signaling can induce erythroid progenitors to undergo cell division, or whether Epo levels can modulate the cell cycle. EpoR signaling may still have a proliferation effect upon BFU-e progenitors, but these progenitors cannot be directly identified, isolated and studied. CFU-e progenitors enter the cell cycle at the time of GATA-1 induction and PU.1 suppression in a developmental manner rather than due to EpoR signaling. Subsequent differentiation stages (proerythroblast to orthochromatic erythroblast) involve a decrease in cell size and eventual expulsion of the nucleus, and are likely dependent upon EpoR signaling only for their survival. In addition, some evidence on macrocytosis in hypoxic stress (when Epo can increase 1000-fold) suggests that mitosis is actually skipped in later erythroid stages, when EpoR expression is low/absent, in order to provide emergency reserve of red blood cells as soon as possible. Such data, though sometimes circumstantial, argue that there is limited capacity to proliferate specifically in response to Epo (and not other factors). Together, these data suggest that EpoR in erythroid differentiation may function primarily as a survival factor, while its effect on the cell cycle (for example, rate of division and corresponding changes in the levels of cyclins and Cdk inhibitors) in vivo awaits further work. In other cell systems, however, EpoR may provide a specific proliferative signal.  Commitment of multipotent progenitors to the erythroid lineage  EpoR's role in lineage commitment is currently unclear. EpoR expression can extend as far back as the hematopoietic stem cell compartment. It is unknown whether EpoR signaling plays a permissive (i.e. induces only survival) or an instructive (i.e. upregulates erythroid markers to lock progenitors to a predetermined differentiation path) role in early, multipotent progenitors in order to produce sufficient erythroblast numbers. Current publications in the field suggest that it is primarily permissive. The generation of BFU-e and CFU-e progenitors was shown to be normal in rodent embryos knocked out for either Epo or EpoR. An argument against such lack of requirement is that in response to Epo or hypoxic stress, the number of early erythroid stages, the BFU-e and CFU-e, increases dramatically. However, it is unclear if it is an instructive signal or, again, a permissive signal. One additional point is that signaling pathways activated by the EpoR are common to many other receptors; replacing EpoR with prolactin receptor supports erythroid survival and differentiation in vitro. Together, these data suggest that commitment to erythroid lineage likely does not happen due to EpoR's as-yet-unknown instructive function, but possibly due to its role in survival at the multipotent progenitor stages.  Animal studies on Epo Receptor mutations Mice with truncated EpoR are viable, which suggests Jak2 activity is sufficient to support basal erythropoiesis by activating the necessary pathways without phosphotyrosine docking sites being needed. EpoR-H form of EpoR truncation contains the first, and, what can be argued, the most important tyrosine 343 that serves as a docking site for the Stat5 molecule, but lacks the rest of the cytoplasmic tail. These mice exhibit elevated erythropoiesis consistent with the idea that phosphatase recruitment (and therefore the shutting down of signaling) is aberrant in these mice. The EpoR-HM receptor also lacks the majority of the cytoplasmic domain, and contains the tyrosine 343 that was mutated to phenylalanine, making it unsuitable for efficient Stat5 docking and activation. These mice are anemic and show poor response to hypoxic stress, such as phenylhydrazine treatment or erythropoietin injection. EpoR knockout mice have defects in heart, brain and the vasculature. These defects may be due to blocks in RBC formation and thus insufficient oxygen delivery to developing tissues because mice engineered to express Epo receptors only in erythroid cells develop normally.  Clinical significance  Defects in the erythropoietin receptor may produce erythroleukemia and familial erythrocytosis. Overproduction of red blood cells increases a chance of adverse cardiovascular event, such as thrombosis and stroke. Rarely, seemingly beneficial mutations in the EpoR may arise, where increased red blood cell number allows for improved oxygen delivery in athletic endurance events with no apparent adverse effects upon the athlete's health (as for example in the Finnish athlete Eero M√§ntyranta). Erythropoietin was reported to maintain endothelial cells and to promote tumor angiogenesis, hence the dysregulation of EpoR may affect the growth of certain tumors. However this hypothesis is not universally accepted.

It is situated east of Hanau between the forested hills of the Spessart. Bad Orb has a population of over 9000. Its economy is dominated by the health and tourism sectors. Geography Location Constituent communities Bad Orb is located in the valley of the Orb, a tributary of the Kinzig. The town is surrounded by the wooded hills of the Spessart, including the Wintersberg. The closest larger cities are Hanau, Aschaffenburg and Frankfurt to the southwest and Fulda to the northeast. Neighboring communities From the north, clockwise, Bad Orb borders on W√§chtersbach, Bad Soden-Salm√ºnster, the unincorporated area Gutsbezirk Spessart, Jossgrund and Biebergem√ºnd. History The region was inhabited by Celts by c. 650 BC, but it is not known whether they were aware of the local salt deposits. In 1054 Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor gifted the area around Orb (Orbaha) to the Stift St. Stefan at Mainz, it thus came under the control of the Electorate of Mainz, a part of which it remained until 1803. Bad Orb was first documented in 1059. Orb is referred to as a town for the first time in the 13th century. Town privileges included the minting of a coin, the Orber H√§lbling (\\"half-Pfennig of Orb\\"). The remains of the town wall that still exist today also originate from this time. The historic trading route (and modern day long-distance hiking trail) Eselsweg (\\"donkey trail\\") that runs to Gro√üheubach in the district of Miltenberg from Schl√ºchtern originates at Bad Orb. In the past, this route was used to transport salt to the Main. The extraction of salt from several salt springs formed the town. There were eleven Salinen (one of which has been renovated and preserved), sometimes called \\"thorn houses\\" or \\"salt works\\", belonging in the decoction facility, in which brine dripped over a total length of of blackthorn twigs in order to raise the salt concentration of the water before boiling. Salt production reached its high point in the 17th and 18th centuries. After mediatisation, by way of the Principality of Aschaffenburg and the Grand Duchy of Frankfurt Orb eventually came to the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1814. Spa activities started as early as 1837. After the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, Bad Orb became Prussian in 1867. In 1884, a children's medical facility was founded by the brothers Friedrich Hufnagel and Wilhelm Hufnagel, which today is known as the Spessart- Klinik. After 1900, brine began to be used as an alternative medicine. In 1899 salt production ceased at Orb. Bad Orb was named a nationally certified spa town in 1909. The remaining salina today is used for medical treatments, especially inhalation and relaxation. From 1939 to 1945, Bad Orb was the site of a prisoner-of-war camp named Stalag IX-B located on the nearby hill, Wegscheidek√ºppel. The camp held Soviet, American, French, Italian and Serbian soldiers. Toward the end of the war the conditions at Stalag IX-B deteriorated precipitously, as a result of poor supply and scarcity of fuel. There is a monument to the Soviet dead located at a graveyard south of the former camp site. With the end of the Prussian state, Bad Orb became a part of Hesse. Economy Bad Orb is a spa town. Hospitals, rehabilitation and physical therapy facilities and medical doctors dominate. Next to the health sector, tourism is the most important industry.

Notable examples of architecture include the buildings in Hauptstra√üe, the Henkershaus, Alt-Orb, Goldenes Rad and Salzgrafenhaus. The old castle hosts a town museum. There are two churches: St. Martin is a Gothic hall church from the 14th century. It burned down in 1983, but was rebuilt in 1984-5. Martin- Luther-Kirche was built 1902-3 in Gothic Revival style. It features two loaned bells from Silesia and East Prussia. The altar bible was a gift from Empress Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein. The town offers many amenities to the spa guests, including the Saline and the Kurpark. The forests around Bad Orb sport a network of hiking and biking trails. There is also the Spessart Wildpark, established in 1937. Infrastructure Bad Orb is home to the Frankfurter Schullandheim Wegscheide, a summer camp for children founded in 1920 on the grounds of the former army training camp which served as a POW camp in World War II, and the \\"Spessart Clinic\\", a children's hospital founded in 1884. Utilities Like in other communities in the area, such as Biebergem√ºnd, Fl√∂rsbachtal and Jossgrund, there is currently controversy over plans to build towering wind farms on the wooded peaks surrounding the town of Bad Orb. Environmentalists and many locals reject these plans due to the destruction of forests and animal habitats, possible health risks to residents, as well as threats to local property values and, in particular, to the tourism/spa business as a result of a declining attractiveness of the region to visitors and patients. It is also questioned whether local winds are strong and constant enough to allow economical operation of the wind farms.

One can use a wholesale list to save hours of researching about wholesaling companies as the producer of a wholesale list will already have done it. For example, a wholesale list may contain details of companies which sell computers at wholesaler prices to customers. Someone wanting to buy computers at wholesale prices need not spend time and effort hunting for the companies, as there is already a wholesale list on that product existing. List Providers There are many companies providing wholesale lists, some better than others, some free, some for a small price. Generally, those lists that require a fee to view, may not be updated frequently, the data may be old, and the companies listed may no longer be in business. While this may also be the case with a free list, since there is no investment, nothing has been risked, or lost as the retailer searches for new trading partners. The web has many free wholesale list resources, that do not require a membership or fee to view the sources. The lists are sorted by product category, making it quick and easy to find a specific product line. Some wholesale list websites have internet forums. Those forums may be frequented by companies who are less than desirable, but promote themselves under a false user name, giving a testimonial indicating they have bought from the supplier, and had an excellent transaction. Use caution when seeing \\"Testimonials\\" of past buyers. Verify all contact information, and if you have any doubts, pass the wholesaler up. Selecting a vendor When viewing a wholesale list it is best to do to three things before selecting a vendor as a new trading partner. First, check their Better Business Bureau (BBB) rating if the company is in the United States or Canada. Then, check the internet Whois to see how long the wholesale company has been on the web, who owns the website, and who the webmaster of the website is. Check to see that contact information in the Whois, at the Better Business Bureau and on the wholesale supplier's website contact page, all match. If they don't match, ask the supplier why there are numerous addresses. See if the area code of the phone numbers all match as well. As a final step before purchasing from a new trading partner, if the company is in the United States, check the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) site for complaints against the company. The FTC has lists of complaints filed against internet companies. They show letters sent to the company, tell if the case went to court, explain how the case was resolved, including any fines levied against the company. In some cases, companies committing internet fraud are shut down by the FTC. The FTC has a complaint area on their site, for online complaint submission. Scamming and safety Wholesale lists offered for sale may be scams as it is easy to compile a list and the consumer has no way of checking that the list is accurate and not out of date ahead of time. It is easy to do one's own research on the internet or the public library instead.

It exploited the coal seams of the Middle Coal Measures of the Lancashire Coalfield. The colliery had two spells of use; the first between 1844 and 1932, when the most accessible coal seams were exploited, and a second lease of life after extensive development in the late 1950s to access the deepest seams.  First colliery (1844‚Äì1932)  Andrew Knowles acquired the lease of coal under the Agecroft estate in 1823 and his colliery is shown on an 1830 plan alongside the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal not far from old workings near Park House Bridge. Two shafts were sunk by Andrew Knowles and Sons in 1844. The colliery's screens and surface buildings were modernised in the early 1890s and No 3 and No 4 shafts were sunk to 700 yards to the Trencherbone mine in 1894 and worked an area to the south of the Pendleton Fault. The fault to the north, with a displacement of 695 metres to the northeast, formed a natural boundary to the colliery. The colliery was located close (less than a mile) from Clifton Hall Colliery (Lumns Lane, Clifton). A tunnel linked the two collieries which allowed 122 men and boys to escape from the upper seams following the 1885 Clifton Hall Colliery disaster. The colliery had access to the Manchester and Bolton Railway line and the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal. In 1896 Agecroft Nos 1 & 2 pits employed 371 underground and 111 surface workers while Agecroft Nos 3 & 4 employed 15 underground and 39 on the surface. In 1923 Nos 1 and 2 pits employed 272 workers and Nos 3 and 4 a total of 371. Floor upheaval on 4 November 1926 resulted in the deaths of six miners. Andrew Knowles and Sons was merged into Manchester Collieries in 1929 and Nos 1 and 2 pits closed the following year. Nos 3 and 4 pits closed in July 1932 but the shafts were retained for pumping to drain nearby collieries.  Second colliery (1960‚Äì1991) In the late 1940s and early 1950s, the National Coal Board (NCB), aware that coal reserves in its collieries were becoming exhausted, looked at re-opening Agecroft. The NCB carried out deephole-boring in July 1951. In total seven boreholes were drilled; the deepest to 3,790 feet (1,155 metres). In early 1953 it was deduced that there was an estimated 80 million tonnes of workable coal in seams varying from 2 ft 2¬Ω in to 7 ft 0 in (68 cm to 213 cm) in thickness. Agecroft Colliery was redeveloped by the NCB in the 1950s reusing No 3 and No 4 shafts and sinking a new shaft. It cost ¬£9 million to realign and restructure the pit. The colliery was situated between Agecroft Road (A6044), Dell Avenue and the Manchester to Bolton railway line. The old Nos 3 and 4 shafts were reused and a new No 5 shaft sunk (2,000 feet in depth, 24 feet in diameter) for coal winding using a Koepe-type winding tower. A tunnelling programme commenced in August 1957 and 11,000 yards of tunnel was driven to allow for development of initial output. New surface buildings were built and the colliery was substantially complete by 1960. The first coal winding began in August 1960.  Disaster of 1958  In 1958, while construction workers were sinking shafts, an underground explosion killed one man and injured twelve, trapping them at the bottom of the shaft. The accident was attributed to a misunderstanding in signalling, when men at the top mistakenly believed that the men at the bottom had left the pit and commenced demolition sending tonnes of rock and debris down the shaft.  Final years of operation  Some workers at the pit participated in the miners' strike in 1984‚Äì85. The colliery closed in March 1991 and demolition began later that year.  Agecroft Power Station  The colliery's main customer was the Central Electricity Generating Board‚Äôs Agecroft Power Station close to the River Irwell. Coal was transported directly to the power station via an enclosed conveyor belt on a bridge over Agecroft Road (A6044). Some coal was moved by merry-go-round coal hopper trains shuttling between coal mines and the power station. Its closure was announced in November 1992 and demolition on the site commenced in 1993 culminating in the destruction of its four cooling towers in May 1994.  Redevelopment  In the late 1990s, a business enterprise park opened on the colliery site. Much of the land remains unused. An international railfreight terminal was planned next to the Manchester to Bolton railway line but, though a spur line was built, the development did not materialise. A housing development has been built on Agecroft Road on the Thermalite factory site and a prison, HMP Forest Bank and Youth Offenders' Institute, built close to the power station site. The land has been landscaped, and footpaths constructed to encourage recreational use. Swinton RLFC plans to build a 6,000-seat stadium on land immediately east of the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal between Agecroft Road and the prison.

She graduated from Smith College in 1945.. She performed pioneering work in the field of computing. Education Evelyn Boyd was born in Washington, D.C.; her father worked odd jobs due to the Great Depression but separated from her mother when Boyd was young. Boyd and her older sister were raised by her mother and aunt, who both worked at the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. She was valedictorian at Dunbar High School, which at that time was a segregated but academically competitive school for black students in Washington. With financial support from her aunt and, later, a small partial scholarship from Phi Delta Kappa, Boyd entered Smith College in the fall of 1941. She majored in mathematics and physics, but also took a keen interest in astronomy. She was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and to Sigma Xi and graduated summa cum laude in 1945. Encouraged by a graduate scholarship from the Smith Student Aid Society of Smith College, she applied to graduate programs in mathematics and was accepted by both Yale University and the University of Michigan; she chose Yale because of the financial aid they offered. There she studied functional analysis under the supervision of Einar Hille, finishing her doctorate in 1949. Her dissertation was \\"On Laguerre Series in the Complex Domain\\". Career Following graduate school, Boyd went to New York University Institute for Mathematics and performed research and teaching there. After, in 1950, she took a teaching position at Fisk University, a college for black students in Nashville, Tennessee (more prestigious postings being unavailable to black women). Two of her students there, Vivienne Malone-Mayes and Etta Zuber Falconer, went on to earn doctorates in mathematics of their own. But by 1952 she left academia and returned to Washington with a position at the Diamond Ordnance Fuze Laboratories. In January 1956, she moved to IBM as a computer programmer; when IBM received a NASA contract, she moved to Vanguard Computing Center in Washington, D.C. Boyd moved from Washington to New York City in 1957. In 1960, after marrying Reverend G. Mansfield Collins, Boyd moved to Los Angeles. There she worked for the U.S. Space Technology Laboratories, which became the North American Aviation Space and Information Systems Division in 1962. She worked on various projects for the Apollo program, including celestial mechanics, trajectory computation, and \\"digital computer techniques\\". Forced to move because of a restructuring at IBM, she took a position at California State University, Los Angeles in 1967 as a full professor of mathematics. After retiring from CSULA in 1984 she taught at Texas College in Tyler, Texas for four years, and then in 1990 joined the faculty of the University of Texas at Tyler as the Sam A. Lindsey Professor of mathematics. There she developed elementary school math enrichment programs. Since 1967, Granville has remained a strong advocate for women's education in tech. Experience of discrimination In 1951, Granville and two African American colleagues were denied entrance to a regional meeting of the Mathematical Association of America (MAA), because it was held at a whites-only hotel. The MAA and the American Mathematical Society (AMS) subsequently changed their practices, under pressure from Lee Lorch, to improve their inclusivity.  Personal life  Boyd married Reverend Gamaliele Mansifeld Collins in 1961. In 1967, Boyd and Collins divorced. She married realtor Edward V. Granville in 1970. The two moved to Tyler, Texas in 1983. Awards and honors In 1989, she was awarded an honorary doctorate by Smith College, the first one given by an American institution to an African-American woman mathematician.Dr. Evelyn Boyd Granville '45 , Smith College, retrieved 2014-06-21.Smith History: Honorary Degrees , Smith College, retrieved 2014-06-21. She was appointed to the Sam A. Lindsey Chair of the University of Texas at Tyler (1990-1991). In 1998, Granville was honoured by the National Academy of Engineering. In 1999, the United States National Academy of Sciences inducted her into its Portrait Collection of African-Americans in Science..

It constitutes the third of the four philippics. Historical background In 343 BC, the Macedonian arms were carried across Epirus and a year later Philip II of Macedon turned his military activities towards Thrace.Demosthenes, Third Philippic, 17. When the Macedonian army approached Chersonese, the Athenians became anxious about the future of their colony. An Athenian general, Diopeithes, ravaged the maritime district of Thrace, an offensive resulting in Philip's rage. The king sent a letter of remonstrance to Athens, demanding the immediate withdrawal of the Athenian troops from Cardia, which was occupied by the Macedonian army.Demosthenes, Third Philippic, 35. Because of this turbulence, the assembly convened and Demosthenes delivered On the Chersonese, convincing the Athenians, who would not recall Diopeithes. Content of the speech Within the same year, Demosthenes delivered the Third Philippic. Putting forth all the power of his eloquence, he demanded resolute action against Philip and called for a burst of energy from the Athenian people. Macedon and Athens were already de facto belligerent parties, since the Athenians were financing Diopeithes,Demosthenes, Third Philippic, 72. who was launching attacks against allied cities. Most importantly, Philip was the first who violated the terms of the Peace of Philocrates and Athens was just defending its legitimate rights. Assessments The Third Philippic is considered the best of Demosthenes' political orations,K. Tsatsos, Demosthenes, 245. because of its passionate and evocative style.The Helios. From the moment he delivered the Third Philippic, Demosthenes imposed himself as the most influential politician of Athens and the suzerain of the Athenian political arena. He takes the offensive and devitalizes the \\"pacific\\" and pro-Macedonian faction of Aeschines. In the Third Philippic, the unchallengeable and passionate leader of the anti-Macedonian faction gives the signal for the Athenian uprising against Philip.

Due to his relationship with queen Joan (starting around 1416), Caracciolo was able to attain for himself a considerable amount of power in the Neapolitan court and a great amount of wealth. Around 1425 he was siniscalco (prime minister) of Naples, count of Avellino, lord of Capua, Melfi, Venosa and numerous other fiefs in Campania and Apulia. Sergianni managed to obtain an increased power in the realm, until he controlled its politics and finances almost entirely. He was behind the decision to abandon the pope's support, which eventually led to the invasion of Louis III of Anjou and to Joan's decision to adopt Alfonso V of Aragon as her heir. Alfonso had Sergianni arrested in May 1423. However, as the Aragonese soldiers had failed to capture Joan in the siege of Castel Capuano, Sergianni was freed and fled to Aversa with the queen. The situation cleared when Alfonso was called back to Spain, and the queen returned to Naples together with Louis, to whom she was then betrothed. As the latter was a feeble figure who immediately retired to his fiefs in Calabria, the power of Sergianni further increased. Sergianni's exceeding ambition may have pushed Joan to plot his assassination in 1432. On 19 August 1432, Sergianni Caracciolo was stabbed by four knights in the service of the queen in his room in Castel Capuano.

Stimulation of the receptor results in the activation of adenylate cyclase and phospholipase C and in increased levels of the secondary messengers intracellular cAMP and calcium. In humans, the glucagon receptor is encoded by the GCGR gene. Glucagon receptors are mainly expressed in liver and in kidney with lesser amounts found in heart, adipose tissue, spleen, thymus, adrenal glands, pancreas, cerebral cortex, and gastrointestinal tract.  Signal transduction pathway  A glucagon receptor, upon binding with the signaling molecule glucagon, initiates a signal transduction pathway that begins with the activation of adenylate cyclase, which in turn produces cyclic AMP (cAMP). Protein kinase A, whose activation is dependent on the increased levels of cAMP, is responsible for the ensuing cellular response in the form of protein kinase 1 and 2. The ligand-bound glucagon receptor can also initiate a concurrent signaling pathway that is independent of cAMP by activating phospholipase C. Phospholipase C produces DAG and IP3 from PIP2, a phospholipid phospholipase C cleaves off of the plasma membrane. Ca2+ stores inside the cell release Ca2+ when its calcium channels are bound by IP3. Structure glucagon/glucagon receptor (blue) with glucagon bound(pink) The 3D crystallographic structures of the seven transmembrane helical domain (7TM); and the extracellular domain (ECD); and an electron microscopy (EM) map of full length glucagon receptor have been determined. Furthermore, the structural dynamics of an active state complex of the Glucagon receptor, Glucagon, the Receptor activity-modifying protein, and the G-protein C-terminus has been determined using a computational and experimental approach.  Clinical significance  A missense mutation at 17q25 in the GCGR gene is associated with diabetes mellitus type 2. Inactivating mutation of glucagon receptor in humans causes resistance to glucagon and is associated with pancreatic alpha cell hyperplasia, nesidioblastosis, hyperglucagonemia, and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, also known as Mahvash disease.

One of the routine tasks U.S. Navy F-14s performed was intercepting aircraft that approached U.S. carrier groups too closely. Soviet strategic bombers and maritime reconnaissance aircraft regularly patrolled near U.S. carriers during the Cold War and were often escorted away by F-14s. F-14 Tomcats were the primary interceptors of Tu-95 Bear D aircraft that flew anywhere in the vicinity of U.S. aircraft carriers during the Cold War. U.S. policy was not to let the Bear D come within several hundred miles of an aircraft carrier without an armed escort. During the height of the Cold War, a pair of Bear D aircraft would fly from the Kola peninsula to Cuba every week resulting in frequent intercepts as they passed along the Eastern coast of the United States. During the same time period, annual North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) exercise in the North Sea area elicited daily flights of Bear D aircraft operating in pairs to locate the aircraft carrier(s) in the area. Operations Northern Wedding and Ocean Safari typically brought at least one U.S. Navy carrier into the Greenland‚ÄìIceland‚ÄìUnited Kingdom (GIUK) gap during the exercise prompting considerable monitoring by Soviet surface ships, submarines, and aircraft. Tomcats were utilized to provide around-the-clock fleet air defense intercepting not only Soviet Bear D aircraft, but also Tu-16 \\"Badger\\" maritime strike and M-4 \\"Bison\\", An-12 \\"Cub\\", and Il-38 \\"May\\" surveillance aircraft which routinely attempted to target aircraft carrier battle groups.

This was the result of the U.S. Navy not having developed the systems and procedures required to integrate its carrier air groups into a joint air component command, as Cold War-era tactics had the Navy operating on its own.Marolda, Edward J. \\"The United States Navy and the Persian Gulf.\\" Naval History and Heritage Command.

Navy fighters were not able to solve the strict rules of engagement (ROE) using most of their on-board sensors and relied on outside clearance such as U.S. Air Force E-3 Sentries to receive permission to fire. In contrast, U.S. Air Force F-15s had the systems necessary to independently identify enemy aircraft from beyond visual range and were given the primary overland combat air patrol stations to intercept Iraqi aircraft that made it into the air. Political reasons have also been attributed to limiting aerial engagements involving F-14s during the Gulf War.Brown 2007, p. 109.Davies 2005, pp. 17‚Äì18. According to accounts from Navy pilots, Navy fighters were called off from Iraqi aircraft so that other coalition fighters could engage them. One event used to support this notion occurred on 24 January 1991, when a U.S. Air force E-3 Sentry did not inform U.S. naval units of a pair of Iraqi Mirage F-1EQs that flew into the Persian Gulf.Pokrant 1999, pp. 48‚Äì51. Saudi F-15s were vectored instead of F-14s that were in a better position to shoot down the Iraqi fighters. Another explanation for why the F-14s did not intercept the Mirage F-1s stems from some of the procedural and technical difficulties U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy assets had in passing tactical information to each other. The E-3 could not directly contact the F-14s in a timely manner since they were under the control of the cruiser , which was not able to get a clear radar picture to accurately vector the F-14s. Tomcat aircrews that encountered Iraqi fighters found that the Iraqis would disengage and flee once tracked by the F-14's radar and pursued.Gillcrest 1994, p. 168. On the first day of Desert Storm, two Iraqi MiG-21s attempting to escape from four VF-103 F-14Bs flew directly into a flight of four F/A-18s that shot down both MiGs.Wilcox 1996, pp. 259‚Äì265. According to interviewed F-15 pilots, several kills by F-15s were made in a similar manner, with Iraqi aircraft being downed after retreating from Tomcats.Brown 1998, p. 8. In addition to the air-to-air duties, Tomcats supported the coalition's need for battle damage assessments (BDA) and locating Scud missile launch sites by performing tactical reconnaissance missions utilizing TARPS.Lowry 2008, p. 4. These missions helped fill in intelligence gathering gaps when cloudy skies prevented the use of space-based surveillance systems. On 21 January 1991, an F-14B with its pilot, Lieutenant Devon Jones, and Radar Intercept Officer, Lieutenant Lawrence Slade, of VF-103 was shot down by an SA-2 surface-to-air missile while on an escort mission over Al Asad Air Base.Pokrant 1999, pp. 31‚Äì32. Jones was recovered the following day, but Slade was captured and held as a prisoner of war until his release on 4 March 1991.Pokrant 1999, pp. 185‚Äì187. This incident marked the only time a U.S. Navy F-14 was lost to hostile fire. One air-to-air kill was credited to the F-14 during the war. An Iraqi Mil Mi-8 helicopter was shot down by a VF-1 F-14A using an AIM-9 Sidewinder on 6 February 1991.Brown 2007, pp. 109‚Äì115. The Tomcat faced an early retirement due to budget cuts following the end of both the Persian Gulf and Cold Wars in 1991. However, the retirement of the Grumman A-6 Intruder was impetus for the U.S. Navy to continue to use the F-14 by upgrading it with a precision strike capability. Interwar air operations over Iraq (1991‚Äì2003) Following Operation Desert Storm, F-14s patrolled the no-fly zones that were established over Iraq for Operations Provide Comfort, Southern Watch and Northern Watch. F-14s performed combat air patrol, fighter escort, aerial reconnaissance and air interdiction missions in support of these operations until the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. TARPS-equipped F-14s provided Joint Task Force Southwest Asia with the ability to monitor Iraqi military activity on a daily basis in southern Iraq, making the Tomcat a primary asset in Operation Southern Watch.Holmes 2005, p. 11. F-14s were often part of strike packages when conducting missions in support of Operation Southern Watch. During many of these missions, the Tomcat's long range allowed it to stay on station for twice as long as other U.S. Navy tactical aircraft.Holmes 2005, pp. 13‚Äì14. F-14s were able to remain on station after other Navy aircraft that made the ingress with them had to be replaced. The Tomcats would depart with the strike package after the pilots of the second set of aircraft declared that they needed fuel. On 16 December 1998, F-14Bs from VF-32 took part in a 33-aircraft strike package that spearheaded Operation Desert Fox.\\"VFA-32 Squadron History.\\" U.S. Navy. Retrieved: 29 November 2012. The first night of the four-day operation was conducted by the U.S. Navy only.Holmes 2005, pp. 14‚Äì16. On 19 December, the last day of the operation, arrived in the Persian Gulf and VF-213 joined the air strikes, taking the F-14D into combat for the first time. In addition to performing strike missions, F-14s from both squadrons conducted escort combat air patrols for U.S. Air Force B-1B bombers that were committed to the operation beginning on 17 December.Holmes 2005, pp. 14‚Äì16. Many firsts for the F-14 were achieved during Desert Fox, including the first GBU-24 \\"Paveway III\\" laser-guided bombs dropped in combat by the U.S. Navy, the first multiple GBU-24 drop by any platform in combat, the first combat use of the Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN) targeting pod system, the first autonomous delivery of a GBU-10/16/24 laser-guided bomb by an F-14, and the first use of night vision devices in combat. VF-32 alone dropped of munitions during 16 strike missions and 38 sorties during the operation. Two F-14Ds from VF-213 engaged several Iraqi aircraft challenging the no-fly zone on 5 January 1999. During the engagement, the F-14s were approached by a pair of MiG-23s that turned away before they were fired on. The F-14 aircrews then focused on a MiG-25 that continued to advance and launched two AIM-54C Phoenix missiles at it from very long distance. Both AIM-54s' rocket motors failed and the missiles did not hit their target. All of the Iraqi aircraft were able fly back out of the no-fly zone, although a MiG-23 was reported to have run out of fuel and crashed before reaching its base. This engagement marked the first time the U.S. Navy launched AIM-54s in combat. At the conclusion of VF-213's 1998‚Äì1999 cruise, the squadron had executed 19 strikes, dropped 20 laser- guided bombs with a 64-percent success rate, supported 11 combined strikes, flown 70 missions, logged 230 sorties with over 615 combat hours, and performed 45 reconnaissance missions imaging more than 580 targets.Rausa, Zeno. \\"Vinson/CVW-11 report, p. 4.\\" Wings of Gold, Association of Naval Aviation, Summer 1999. ISSN 0274-7405. Retrieved: 26 October 2010. On 9 September 1999, a VF-2 F-14 engaged an Iraqi MiG-23 with an AIM-54 Phoenix missile. Neither aircraft was damaged. F-14s also patrolled the no-fly zones in Iraq during Operation Northern Watch and Operation Southern Watch from the 1990s until 2003. Balkans (1994‚Äì1995 and 1999) In August and September 1995, NATO launched Operation Deliberate Force, and and its air wing supported the operation. F-14s from VF-14 and VF-41 participated in strikes. VF-41 is credited with being the first F-14 unit to drop laser-guided bombs in combat when, on 5 September 1995, two F-14As attacked an ammunition dump in eastern Bosnia. The bomb's targets were identified by laser indicators from F/A-18s because the F-14 was not yet cleared to carry the LANTIRN pod. VF-41 alone logged 600 combat hours and 530 sorties during this cruise. VF-14 and VF-41 took part in Operation Allied Force, NATO's aerial campaign against Serbian operations in Kosovo, between 9 April 1999 and 9 June 1999. F-14s of VF-14 dropped 350 laser-guided bombs, in addition to other air-to-ground ordnance. F-14s flew combat air patrol, escort, and strike missions; acted as Forward Air Controllers; and performed TARPS missions. VF-41 dropped the last bombs of the war on a dummy SA-9 surface-to-air missile launcher inside the Kosovo border near the peace-signing site on 9 June 1999. Operation Enduring Freedom (2001‚Äì2003) An F-14D from VF-213 prepares to refuel over Afghanistan. After the September 11, 2001 attacks, no fewer than eight F-14 squadrons participated in Operation Enduring Freedom, flying long-range missions from the Indian Ocean to strike targets around Afghanistan and conducting reconnaissance and ground support missions. From the start of Operation Enduring Freedom to the end of Operation Anaconda, F-14s from VF-14, VF-41, VF-102, VF-211, and VF-213 dropped more than of ordnance on targets. VF-11 and VF-143, alongside CVW-7, dropped of ordnance, both the \\"Red Rippers\\" and the \\"Pukin' Dogs\\" making history as they dropped JDAM bombs from the F-14 for the first time during combat. VF-103 arrived in Afghanistan in June 2002 when combat was scarce, and the \\"Jolly Rogers\\" did not get the opportunity to drop any bombs during the operation. During the war, VF-213 logged over 500 combat sorties, 2,600 combat hours, and dropped of ordnance (452 bombs) during their 10 weeks over Afghanistan;Holmes 2008, p. 66. the \\"Black Lions\\" also had the distinct honor of dropping the first bombs of Operation Enduring Freedom.Holmes 2008, p. 27. VF-102 dropped more bombs‚Äî680 of them, totaling ‚Äîand logged more combat hours (more than 5,000) than any other F-14 unit that took part in the operation, and the unit dropped an additional of ordnance.Holmes 2008, p. 45.Holmes 2008, p. 60. VF-211 flew 1,250 combat sorties, logging 4,200 combat hours and dropping of ordnance.Holmes 2008, p. 89. VF-14 led more strikes than any other squadron in CVW-8, and dropped 174 laser-guided bombs, totaling and buddy-lased 28 AGM-65 Maverick missiles and 23 laser-guided bombs,Holmes 2008, p. 53. and like their sister squadron VF-41, they flew the oldest jets in the fleet. VF-41 dropped more than of bombs (202 laser-guided bombs) with an 82 percent hit rate, which was a level of accuracy that had never previously been achieved in the U.S. Navy.Holmes 2008, p. 52. Operation Iraqi Freedom (2003‚Äì2006) An F-14 launches an AIM-54 Phoenix during training in 2002 F-14s from VF-2, VF-31, VF-32, VF-154, and VF-213 participated in Operation Iraqi Freedom. The F-14s flew 2,547 combat sorties and dropped 1,452 GBU, JDAM, and MK-82 bombs with just one lost jet (from engine failure). F-14s led strikes on Baghdad, attacking targets such as the Iraqi Ministry of Information's Salman Pak radio relay transmitter facility at Al Hurriyah (southwest of central Baghdad) with JDAM bombs. Another notable mission involved TARPS-equipped F-14Ds dropping four Mark 82 bombs on Saddam Hussein's Presidential yacht Al-Mansur (The Victor). F-14s also supported ground troops during the war and acted as Forward Air Controllers for other aircraft. An aircrew from VF-32 was involved in the worst friendly-fire incident in the war when the crew attacked a U.S. Special Forces convoy in northern Iraq, believing they were Iraqi forces. During the F-14's last three years in service, the remaining units all deployed to the Persian Gulf region in support of the U.S. forces in Iraq. The final deployment for the F-14 was between September 2005 and March 2006 with VF-31 and VF-213. These two units collectively completed 1,163 combat sorties, totaling 6,876 flight hours. They dropped of ordnance during reconnaissance, surveillance, and close air support missions in support of the war in Iraq. Iranian service Before the Islamic Revolution the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi arranged to arm the Iranian Air Force with 80 Grumman F-14A Tomcats and 714 AIM-54 Phoenix missiles in a deal of US$2 billion, out of which 274 were delivered for US$150 millionAIM-54 Phoenix Missile, 150 embargoed after the 1979 revolution and the additional 290 cancelled.How Iranian air crews, cut off from U.S. technical support, used the F-14 against Iraqi attackers in the 1970s Iran looked for an air superiority fighter to counter Soviet air incursions of MiG-25 fighters. In October 1978, two IIAF F-14As intercepted a high-and-fast‚Äìflying Soviet MiG-25 over the Caspian sea tracking it for two minutes and forcing it to abort a reconnaissance run over Iran. The first squadron of Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force F-14 Tomcat pilots, at Shiraz Air Base. By September 1980, the Islamic Republic of Iran Air Force (IRIAF) managed to make an increasing number of airframes operational, despite immense problems due to repeated purges of its officers. Some of those officers were executed; others were imprisoned, forced into exile, or forced to take early retirement. The IRIAF survived these times, and its Tomcats were to become involved in the war against Iraq, scoring their first kill on 7 September 1980. There is limited information available about the service of F-14s in the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. Western intelligence indicates that the IRIAF was in decline at the onset of the war in September 1980, and it is rumored that some level of sabotage was committed on the F-14s by either Americans or Iranians loyal to the Shah, during the Iranian Revolution.\\"Iranian Air Force F-14.\\" AerospaceWeb. Retrieved: 26 October 2010. Following the overthrow of the Shah, most Iranian F-14 pilots and technicians trained in the United States fled from Iran, fearing their association with the Shah's regime, and their time in the United States would endanger them. Only two pilots out of the original flight class chose to remain in Iran. Their fears proved correct, and many of the original Iranian F-14 crews and technicians who remained were jailed or executed by the new regime. Eventually, several jailed F-14 pilots were released when war broke out with Iraq.Cooper, Tom. \\"Persian Cats.\\" Smithsonian Air & Space, Vol. 21, No. 3, September 2006, pp. 36‚Äì39. The United States estimated that the IRIAF was able to keep between 15 and 20 F-14s operational by cannibalizing parts from other examples. The IRIAF claims a higher figure, and was able to assemble 25 aircraft for an 11 February 1985 fly-over of Tehran. Despite the U.S embargo following the Islamic Revolution,The Iran-Contra Affair 20 Years On. The National Security Archive (George Washington University), 24 November 2006 Iran was able to acquire parts for its F-14, these came via the Iran-Contra arms deal, collusion with Israel and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.THE WHITE HOUSE CRISIS; EVIDENCE POINTS TO BIG SAUDI ROLE IN IRANIAN AND CONTRA ARMS DEALSThe Iran Pipeline: A Hidden Chapter/A special report.; U.S. Said to Have Allowed Israel to Sell Arms to Iran Role GlobalSecurity indicates that Iran flew the F-14 in an AWACS-type role. To counter, Iraqi Mirage F1-EQs flew low-altitude profiles, popping up briefly to illuminate and launch missiles against the F-14s; several Tomcats were lost in this manner. GlobalSecurity also reports that less than 20 aircraft were still airworthy as of 2000, and cited one report that only seven can be airborne at one time.\\"Air Force (Iranian Imperial Air Force).\\" Global Security. Retrieved: 22 August 2006. It was thought for many years that Iran used the fighter primarily as an airborne radar controller, escorted and protected by other fighters, but later information indicates this was incorrect. While the IRIAF did husband its fleet of F-14s, the aircraft were used aggressively when needed, even escorting strike packages deep into Iraqi airspace. Initially, the IRIAF F-14s flew intensive CAP patrols, some lasting nine hours, over main bases. IRIAF Tomcats often escorted tankers supporting strike packages heading into Iraq, scanning over the border with their radars and intercepting inbound Iraqi aircraft. With the AWG-9 radar and long range AIM-54 and medium range AIM-7 missiles, the Tomcats could be used as offensive weapons without leaving Iranian airspace. United States AWACS aircraft observed the downing of an Iraqi Tupolev Tu-22 \\"Blinder\\" bomber, and the downing of at least one F-14. Western sources estimate four kills against four to five losses; the official Iranian estimate is 35‚Äì45 kills, and 12 losses, all reportedly due to engine failure during combat. Armament Also unresolved is the extent of usage of the AIM-54 Phoenix missile. Most Western sources indicate that sabotage prevented their use, although other sources claim that up to 25 planes were downed by AIM-54s before Iran's supply ran out. The Iranian F-14s used the AIM-7 Sparrow and AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles as primary armament; Iran is reportedly developing a domestic copy of the Sparrow, as well as the Phoenix. Combat history Jalil Zandi, one the most successful F-14 pilots In 2004, Tom Cooper published Iranian F-14 Tomcat Units in Combat, based mainly on primary interviews with Iranian pilots. The book makes many claims that contradict previous reports. In particular, Cooper claims that Iran's F-14s had up to 159 kills, and that in one incident, four Iraqi aircraft were shot down with one AIM-54 (The missile's warhead exploded between them and severely damaged them). The first confirmed kill by an F-14A during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War occurred before the formal start of hostilities: on 7 September 1980, an IRIAF F-14A destroyed an Iraqi Mil Mi-25 (export variant of the Mil Mi-24) Hind helicopter using its 20mm Vulcan cannon. Six days later, Major Mohammad-Reza Attaie shot down an Iraqi MiG-21 with an AIM-54 Phoenix while flying a border patrol. A single AIM-54 fired in July 1982 by Captain Hashemi may have destroyed two Iraqi MiG-23s flying in close formation. Cooper claims the AIM-54s were used only sporadically during the start of the war, most likely because of a shortage of qualified radar intercept officers, and then more frequently in 1981 and 1982‚Äîuntil the lack of thermal batteries suspended the missiles' use in 1986. There were also rumors that suggested that Iran's Tomcat fleet would be upgraded with avionics derived from the MiG-31 \\"Foxhound\\". However, IRIAF officials and pilots insist that the Soviets were never allowed near the F-14s, and never received any F-14 or AIM-54 technology. Also, the AIM-54 missile was never out of service in the IRIAF, though the stocks of operational missiles were low at times. Clandestine deliveries from US sources and black market purchases supplied spares to top up the Phoenix reserves during the war, and spares deliveries from the US in the 1990s have also helped. Furthermore, an attempt was made to adapt the MIM-23 Hawk surface-to-air missiles that were also a carry-over from the pre- revolution period, to be used as air-to-air missiles for the F-14; at least two F-14s have been successfully modified to carry the hybrid weaponry. All in all, the IRIAF was said to have launched possibly 70 to 90 AIM-54A missiles, and 60‚Äì70 of those scored. Of those, almost 90 percent of the AIM-54A missiles fired were used against Iraqi fighters and fighter-bombers. Only about a dozen victories by AIM-54s were claimed to be against fast, high-flying targets such as the MiG-25 or Tu-22 'Blinder'. By the close of the war, both sides were unable to obtain new aircraft or parts, and aerial combat had become rare, since neither side could afford to lose aircraft they could not replace. In particular, the IRIAF F-14 fleet suffered from a lack of trained technicians, and by 1984 only 40 F-14s were still in service. By 1986, that number had dropped to just 25. The F-14 was relegated to protecting Iran's vital oil refining and export infrastructure; in this role, they often encountered French-built, Iraqi Dassault Mirage F1EQ fighters attempting to attack Iranian oil pipelines. One IRIAF pilot distinguished himself in combat by becoming the all-time top scoring F-14 ace. Major Jalil Zandi is credited with shooting down eight Iraqi aircraft.Cooper, Tom and Farzad Bishop. \\"Fire in the Hills: Iranian and Iraqi Battles of Autumn 1982.\\" acig.org, 9 September 2003.

It was considered to be the leading monarchy of the Afar people, to whom the other Afar rulers nominally acknowledged primacy. The Sultanate was incorporated into Italian East Africa in 1936, and became part of Ethiopia in 1945, although nominal Sultans continued to be named under Ethiopian rule and the region continued to enjoy considerable autonomy within Ethiopia during the 1950s to 1970s. History Imamate of Aussa Afar society has traditionally been divided into petty kingdoms, each ruled by its own Sultan.Matt Phillips, Jean-Bernard Carillet, Lonely Planet Ethiopia and Eritrea, (Lonely Planet: 2006), p.301. The Imamate of Aussa was carved out of the Sultanate of Harar and the Adal Sultanate in 1577, when Muhammed Jasa moved his capital from Harar to Aussa (Asaita) with the split of the Adal Sultanate into Aussa and the Sultanate of Harar.Abir, p. 23 n.1. In 1647, the rulers of the Emirate of Harar broke away to form their own polity. The Imamate of Awsa was later destroyed by the local Mudaito Afar in 1672. Following the Awsa Imamate's demise, the Mudaito Afars founded their own kingdom, the Sultanate of Aussa. At some point after 1672, Aussa declined in conjunction with Imam Umar Din bin Adam's recorded ascension to the throne. Sultanate Map showing the location of the Aussa Sultanate circa 1880. In 1734, the Afar leader Data Kadafo, head of the Mudayto clan, seized power and established the Mudayto Dynasty.Abir, pp. 23-26. This marked the start of a new and more sophisticated polity that would last into the colonial period. The primary symbol of the Sultan was a silver baton, which was considered to have magical properties.Trimingham, p. 262. The influence of the sultanate extended into the Danakil lowlands of what is now Eritrea. After 15 years of rule, Kadafo's son, Muhamm√§d Kedafu, succeeded him as Sultan. Muhamm√§d Kadafo three decades later bequeathed the throne to his own son, Aydahis, who in turn would reign for another twenty-two years. According to Richard Pankhurst, these relatively long periods of rule by modern standards pointed to a certain degree of political stability within the state. Sultan Mahammad ibn Hanfadhe defeated and killed Werner Munzinger in 1875, who was leading an Egyptian army into Ethiopia.Edward Ullendorff, The Ethiopians: An Introduction to Country and People, second edition (London: Oxford University Press, 1965), p. 90. . Colonial period In 1865, the newly unified Italy bought Asseb from a local Sultan (which became the colony of Eritrea in 1890), and led Sultan Mahammad to sign several treaties with that country. As a result, the Ethiopian Emperor Menelik II stationed an army near Aussa to \\"make sure the Sultan of Awsa would not honor his promise of full cooperation with Italy\\" during the First Italo‚ÄìEthiopian War.Chris Proutky, Empress Taytu and Menilek II (Trenton: The Red Sea Press, 1986), p. 143. . During the Second Italian- Ethiopian War, the Sultan Mahammad Yayyo (grand son of Mohammed Hanfade illalta) agreed to cooperate with the Italian invaders.Anthony Mockler, Haile Selassie's War (Brooklyn: Olive Branch Press, 2003), p. 111. As a result, in 1943 the reinstalled Ethiopian government sent a military expedition that captured Sultan Muhammad Yayo and made one of his relatives Sultan.Trimingham, p. 172. Within modern Ethiopia In 1975, Sultan Alimirah Hanfere was exiled to Saudi Arabia, but returned after the fall of the Derg regime in 1991. Sultan Alimirah often came into conflict with the central government over its encroachment on the authority of the Sultanate. Aussa, which had been more-or-less self-governing until the Sultan's ascension in 1944, had been greatly weakened in power by the centralising forces of Haile Selassie's government. In 1950 he withdrew from Asaita for two years in opposition, returning only two after following mediation by Fitawrari Yayyo. The Sultan sought to unite the Afar people under an autonomous Sultanate, while remaining part of Ethiopia; they had been divided amongst the provinces of Hararghe, Shewa, Tigray, and Wollo. In 1961, when it was clear the Eritrean federal arrangement was headed towards its demise, 55 Afar chieftains in Eritrea met and endorsed the idea of an Ethiopian Afar autonomy. Following the dissolution of Eritrea's federal government and its transformation into a centrally- administered province, Afar leaders met again in Assab in 1963 and supported the creation of an autonomous region. In 1964 Afar leaders went to Addis Ababa to present Haile Selassie with their proposal, but the effort came up empty- handed. Despite these encroachments and conflicts, the Sultan remained fundamentally loyal to the Emperor and Ethiopia; in turn, while he did not achieve the autonomous sultanate he desired, he enjoyed an appreciable level of autonomy in the areas of the Sultanate, almost unique amongst the many petty kingdoms incorporated into the Ethiopian state in the late 19th century. For example, while the government appointed a governor to the awrajja (district) of Aussa proper, the governor, rather than taking up residence in the capital of Asaita, instead sat in Bati, which was outside the district entirely. Upon Alimirah Hanfere's death in 2011, his son Hanfere Alimirah was named his successor as sultan.AFAR News Toronto v.01 (July 2011) List of Sultans * Kandhafo 1734‚Äì1749 * Kadhafo Mahammad ibn Kadhafo 1749‚Äì1779 * Aydahis ibn Kadhafo Mahammad 1779‚Äì1801 * Aydahis ibn Mahammad ibn Aydahis 1801‚Äì1832 * Hanfadhe ibn Aydahis 1832‚Äì1862 * Mahammad ‚ÄûIllalta‚Äú ibn Hanfadhe 1862‚Äì1902 * Mahammad ibn Aydahis ibn Hanfadhe 1902‚Äì1910 * Yayyo ibn Mahammad ibn Hanfadhe 1902‚Äì1927 * Mahammad Yayyo 1927‚Äì1944 *Alimirah Hanfare 1944‚Äì1975, 1991‚Äì2011 * Hanfadhe Alimirah 2011-2020 See also *Afar Region *List of Sunni Muslim dynasties Notes References *Mordechai Abir, The era of the princes: the challenge of Islam and the re-unification of the Christian empire, 1769-1855 (London: Longmans, 1968). *J.

A short time later Demosthenes delivered one of his most famous speeches, the Third Philippic. Historical background In 343 BC, the Macedonian arms were carried across Epirus and a year later Philip II of Macedon turned his military activities toward Thrace.Demosthenes, Third Philippic, 17 He also imposed an amendment of the Peace of Philocrates in his favour.Demosthenes, On Halonnesus, 18 The war in Thrace lasted more than three years, and was one of Philip's most difficult campaigns. When the Macedonian army approached the Chersonese, the Athenians became concerned about the future of this region. An Athenian general, Diopeithes, ravaged the maritime district of Thrace, which angered Philip. The King sent a letter of reprimand to Athens, demanding the immediate withdrawal of the Athenian troops from Cardia, which was occupied by the Macedonian army.Demosthenes, Third Philippic, 35 Because of this turbulence, Demosthenes delivered On the Chersonese during a meeting of the assembly. Content With this speech Demosthenes exhorted, and finally convinced, his compatriots to support Diopeithes, although the general had previously committed certain injustices and was in exile. Demosthenes' only concern in this speech is to focus on Philip's wrongs towards Athens.

Phillips is best known as the play-by-play man of the World Hockey Association and National Hockey League's Edmonton Oilers from 1973 to 2011, succeeding longtime Edmonton Eskimos broadcaster Bryan Hall despite having no experience in the field. He is most famous for his loud, long scream of \\"scoooooooooores!!!!!\\", considered a classic for Oilers fans. Many fans attending games brought their radios to Northlands Coliseum to listen to his broadcasts, and many people watching games on television turned down the sound to listen to his coverage. In 2003, Phillips received the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award, and was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame. Rod Phillips was born in Edmonton, Alberta in 1941 and grew up in Calmar, Alberta. Prior to being a hockey broadcaster, Phillips hosted Edmonton's first-ever late-night television show in 1967. Rod Phillips is the uncle of retired Ottawa Senators defenceman Chris Phillips. Phillips announced his retirement on May 28, 2010. Although retired, he still broadcast 10 more games of the 2010-2011 season, referred to as a \\"farewell tour\\" and dubbed \\"Rod's Classics\\". These ten games included the Oilers greatest rivals: Calgary Flames, Detroit Red Wings, Phoenix Coyotes n√©e Winnipeg Jets, Montreal Canadiens, New York Islanders, Dallas Stars, Boston Bruins, Colorado Avalanche, Philadelphia Flyers, and Los Angeles Kings, in that order. Rod called his 3,542nd and final game on March 29, 2011, officially marking his retirement. During a pre-game ceremony before the game, the Edmonton Oilers honored the Hockey Hall of Famer with a banner marked not with a sweater number, but, rather, the number 3,542 which references the number of games he called for the Oilers. Rod Phillips signed off his final game the way he always did, albeit slightly differently: \\"Good night, and goodbye, from Rexall Place in Edmonton!\\" On-air durability Well known for his on-air durability, Phillips once even tried to call a game while suffering a bleeding nose so bad that it blurred his vision and was known to call games even while sick with severe colds. Phillips had only missed nine periods of Oilers hockey during his entire career - two full games missed due to illness and three first periods missed after participating in on-ice ceremonies - until November 2008, when he missed a 7 game road trip only after being banned from flying by his doctors due to an ear infection. At the time, Phillips said that felt that he was 'letting people down.' Bob Stauffer, the regular color commentator, filled in for him on during the road trip, an admirable performance which led many to speculate Stauffer would be Phillips' eventual replacement. Upon Phillips' retirement, Jack Michaels was named as his replacement.https://edmontonjournal.com/Oilers+introduce+play+play+announcer/3436284/story.html References *Oilers Legacy: Rod Phillips *calls made by Rod Phillips, home games only Category:1941 births Category:Canadian radio sportscasters Category:Canadian television hosts Category:Edmonton Oilers broadcasters Category:Foster Hewitt Memorial Award winners Category:Living people Category:National Hockey League broadcasters Category:People from Edmonton Capital Region Category:World Hockey Association broadcasters ","title":"Rod Phillips (broadcaster)"},{"id":"5827740","text":"The Mudaito Dynasty (Modayt√≥ Dynasty) is the ruling dynasty of the Sultanate of Aussa (Sultanate of Awsa) in Ethiopia. It was founded by the Asaihemara Modaito clan of the Afars who came from the La'o and Doobi areas. History The Sultanate of Aussa (Afar Sultanate) succeeded the earlier Imamate of Aussa. The latter polity had come into existence in 1577, when Muhammed Jasa moved his capital from Harar to Aussa (Asaita) with the split of the Adal Sultanate into Aussa and Sultanate of Harar. At some point after 1672, Aussa declined and temporarily came to an end in conjunction with Imam Umar Din bin Adam's recorded ascension to the throne.Abir, p. 23 n.1.

It opened on March 11, 1927, with the silent film The Love of Sunya, produced by and starring Gloria Swanson. The huge movie palace was a leading Broadway film showcase through the 1950s and was also noted for its lavish stage shows. It closed and was demolished in 1960. Early history Roxy Theatre Weekly Review, March 10, 1928The Roxy Theatre was originally conceived by film producer Herbert Lubin in mid-1925 as the world's largest and finest motion picture palace. To realize his dream, Lubin brought in the successful and innovative theater operator Samuel L. Rothafel, aka \\"Roxy\\", to bring it to fruition,Melnick, pp. 62‚Äì95. enticing him with a large salary, percentage of the profits, stock options and offering to name the theatre after him.Bloom, p. 462. It was intended to be the first of six planned Roxy Theatres in the New York area. Roxy determined to make his theater the summit of his career and in it realize all of his theatrical design and production ideas. He worked with Chicago architect Walter W. Ahlschlager and decorator Harold Rambusch of Rambusch Decorating Company on every aspect of the theater's design and furnishings. Roxy's lavish ideas and his many changes ran up costs dramatically. Lubin, who was $2.5 million over budget and near bankruptcy, sold his controlling interest a week before the theater opened to movie mogul and theater owner William Fox for $5 million. The final cost of the theater was $12 million.Hall, p. 77. With Lubin's exit, Roxy's dreams of his own theater circuit also ended. Only one of the projected Roxy chain was built, the planned Roxy Midway Theatre on Broadway on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, also designed by Ahlschlager. The nearly complete theater was sold to Warner Bros. who opened it as Warner's Beacon in 1929. Design and innovation Known as the \\"Cathedral of the Motion Picture\\", the Roxy's design by Ahlschlager featured a soaring golden, Spanish-inspired auditorium. Its main lobby was a large columned rotunda called the \\"Grand Foyer\\", which featured \\"the world's largest oval rug\\",Hall, p. 123. manufactured by Mohawk Carpets in Amsterdam, New York, plus its own pipe organ on the mezzanine. Off the rotunda was a long entrance lobby that led through the building of the adjacent Manger Hotel to the theater's main entrance at the corner of Seventh Avenue and W. 50th Street. The hotel (later called the Taft Hotel) was built at the same time as the theater. Ahlschlager succeeded in creating an efficient plan for the Roxy's irregular plot of land, which utilized every bit of space by featuring a diagonal auditorium plan with the stage in one corner of the lot. The design maximized the auditorium's size and seating capacity but compromised the function of its triangular stage. The Roxy's stage, while very wide, was not very deep and had limited space off stage. Program for the week of the first anniversary of the Roxy Theatre, March 10-16, 1928 Despite the stage limitations, the theater boasted lavish support facilities including two stories of private dressing rooms, three floors of chorus dressing rooms, huge rehearsal rooms, a costume department, staff dry-cleaning and laundry rooms, a barber shop and hairdresser, a completely equipped infirmary, dining room, and a menagerie for show animals. There were also myriad offices, a private screening room seating 100, and massive engine rooms for the electrical, ventilating and heating machinery. The Roxy's large staff enjoyed a cafeteria, gymnasium, billiard room, nap room, library and showers.Bloom, p. 464. The theater's stage innovations included a rising orchestra pit which could accommodate an orchestra of 110 and a Kimball theater pipe organ with three consoles which could be played simultaneously. The film projection booth was recessed into the front of the balcony to prevent film distortion caused by the usual angled projection from the top rear wall of a theater. This enabled the Roxy to have the sharpest film image for its time.Hall, p. 87. Courteous service to the patron was a key part of the Roxy formula. The theater's uniformed corps of male ushers were known for their polite manner, efficiency and military bearing. They went through rigorous training, daily inspections and drill, overseen by a retired Marine officer. The ushers' crisp attire was favorably mentioned by Cole Porter in a stanza of the song \\"You're the Top\\" in 1932.Hall, p. 169; \\"You're the pants on a Roxy usher\\".You're The Top - Cole Porter - Google Play Music The Roxy presented major Hollywood films in programs that also included a 110-member symphony orchestra (the world's largest permanent orchestra at that time), a solo theater pipe organ, a male chorus, a ballet company and a famous line of female precision dancers, the \\"Roxyettes\\". Elaborate stage spectacles were created each week to accompany the feature film, all under the supervision of Rothafel. The theater's orchestra and performers were also featured in an NBC Radio program with Roxy himself as host. The Roxy Hour, was broadcast live weekly from the theater's own radio studio.Hall, p. 129. Thanks to Roxy's radio popularity, his theater was known to radio listeners nationwide. The Roxy after \\"Roxy\\" In spite of the theater's fame and success, the financial problems of its majority owner, the Fox Film Corporation, after the stock market crash of 1929 destabilized the Roxy's operations and it was often saddled with inferior films. In 1932, Rothafel left the theater named for him for Rockefeller Center where he opened the new Radio City Music Hall and RKO Roxy theaters. Most of the Roxy's performers and artistic staff moved with him to the Music Hall, including producer Leon Leonidoff, choreographer Russell Markert, and conductor Erno Rapee.Shepard, The New York Times, August 1, 1989. The Roxyettes went on to greater fame at the Music Hall, becoming the Rockettes in 1935.Kourlas, The New York Times, December 24, 2005. (The RKO Roxy soon changed its name to the Center Theatre after the owners of the original Roxy sued Rockefeller Center for exclusive rights to the Roxy name.) After Rothafel's departure, the Roxy Theatre never quite regained its former glory but it remained a leading New York showcase for film and stage variety shows. In 1942, A. J. Balaban, co- founder of the Balaban & Katz theater chain, began nearly a decade as Executive Director of the Roxy.Motion Picture Daily, July 19, 1951. He came out of retirement to run the theater at the urging of Spyros Skouras,Billboard, Jul. 18, 1942 the head of the Roxy's parent company National Theatres, as well as 20th Century-Fox Studios. Balaban restored the theater to profitability with access to first-run Fox films, as well as the production and presentation of first-class live shows.Bloom, p. 465. Among his innovations were building an ice rink on the Roxy stage, and engaging many noted performers of the era, such as the Nicholas Brothers, Carmen Cavallaro, and The Harmonicats to appear on the Roxy stage. Even classical ballet dancers, such as Leonide Massine, performed there. Balaban invited the New York Philharmonic to the Roxy along with soprano Eileen Farrell for a two-week engagement in September 1950. Appearing for the first time as the main attraction at a movie palace, the orchestra played an abbreviated concert program four times a day between showings of the feature film, The Black Rose.Taubman, The New York Times, September 2, 1950. The Roxy's stage was rebuilt twice, in 1948 and 1952, to add the ice surface for skating shows. During the latter refurbishing the stage was extended out into the house over the orchestra pit and had colored neon embedded in the ice.The New York Times, December 23, 1952. Ice shows were presented, along with the feature film, on and off through the 1950s. In January 1956, skating star Sonja Henie brought her revue to the Roxy in her final New York appearance.Crowther, The New York Times, January 12, 1956.Strait and Henie Widescreen CinemaScope was introduced at the Roxy with the world premiere in 1953 of 20th Century-Fox's film The Robe. The Roxy had also introduced the original 70mm widescreen format \\"Fox Grandeur\\" in 1930 with the premiere of Fox Films' Happy Days. Due to the Great Depression, however, the Roxy was one of only two theaters equipped for 70mm Grandeur and it never caught on (Grauman's Chinese was the other).Coles, 70 mm, March 2001. Another widescreen format, the three-projector Cinemiracle debuted at the Roxy as well on a curved 110-foot screen with the 1958 film Windjammer. One of the last big combined shows was in 1959 with feature film This Earth Is Mine starring Rock Hudson and Jean Simmons, followed by The Big Circus starring Victor Mature. On the Roxy stage were Gretchen Wyler, The Blackburn Twins, Jerry Collins, and The Roxy Orchestra. The managing director since 1955 was Robert C. Rothafel, son of the original Roxy. By this time the Roxy's appearance was altered considerably from its golden 1920s design. Part of the proscenium and side walls had been removed to accommodate the huge Cinemiracle screen and much of the rest of the auditorium was covered in heavy drapes. The big orchestra pit was mostly covered by the stage extension with the organ consoles removed. The elegant lobby areas, however, remained largely intact.Hall Closing A TGI Friday's restaurant is now located in the space that once housed the Roxy Theatre's entrance lobby The Roxy closed on March 29, 1960. The final movie was The Wind Cannot Read,Motion Picture Daily, March 30, 1960. a British film with Dirk Bogarde which opened March 9. The Roxy had been acquired by Rockefeller Center in 1956, and then sold to developer William Zeckendorf. It was Initially purchased to obtain air rights for the Time-Life Building, built to its east, and was finally demolished by Zeckendorf for an expansion of the Taft Hotel and for an office building that is now connected to the Time-Life building.Time, February 29, 1960. Eliot Elisofon's photograph of Gloria Swanson amidst the ruins of the theater's demolition appeared in the November 7, 1960 issue of LIFE.\\"Swan Song for a Famous Theater,\\" LIFE (magazine), November 7, 1960. Retrieved August 31, 2020 The theater can briefly be seen from the air during its demolition in the opening prologue of the film West Side Story, across 7th Avenue from the back of the Winter Garden Theatre. Legacy The spectacular stage and screen programming ideas of the Roxy's founder continued at Radio City Music Hall into the 1970s. Radio City's lavish Christmas stage show, created in 1933 by the Roxy's former producer and choreographer, Leon Leonidoff and Russell Markert, continues to this day as the Radio City Christmas Spectacular. The Music Hall itself was saved from demolition by a consortium of preservation and commercial interests in 1979 and it remains one of New York's entertainment landmarks. Its restored interior includes the lavish art deco offices created for \\"Roxy\\" Rothafel, preserved partly as a tribute to the visionary showman.

Today it is part of the present-day neighborhood of Crown Heights. History Weeksville was named after James Weeks, an African-American stevedore from Virginia. In 1838 (11 years after the final abolition of slavery in New York State) Weeks bought a plot of land from Henry C. Thompson, a free African American and land investor, in the Ninth Ward of central Brooklyn. Thompson had acquired the land from Edward Copeland, a politically minded European American and Brooklyn grocer, in 1835.Previously Copeland bought the land from an heir of John Lefferts, a member of one of the most prominent and land- holding families in Brooklyn. There was ample opportunity for land acquisition during this time, as many prominent land-holding families sold off their properties during an intense era of land speculation. Many African Americans saw land acquisition as their opportunity to gain economic and political freedom by building their own communities. The NYC Parks website confuses Weeks with a man of the same name who lived 1776-1863. The village itself was established by a group of African-American land investors and political activists, and covered an area in the borough's eastern Bedford Hills area, bounded by present-day Fulton Street, East New York Avenue, Ralph Avenue and Troy Avenue. A 1906 article in the New York Age recalling the earlier period noted that James Weeks \\"owned a handsome dwelling at Schenectady and Atlantic Avenues.\\" By the 1850s, Weeksville had more than 500 residents from all over the East Coast (as well as two people born in Africa). Almost 40 percent of residents were southern-born. Nearly one-third of the men over 21 owned land; in antebellum New York, unlike in New England, non-white men had to own real property (to the value of $250) and pay taxes on it to qualify as voters. The village had its own churches (including Bethel Tabernacle African Methodist Episcopal Church and the Berean Missionary Baptist Church), a school (\\"Colored School no. 2\\", now P.S. 243), a cemetery, and an old age home. Weeksville had one of the first African-American newspapers, the Freedman's Torchlight, and in the 1860s became the national headquarters of the African Civilization Society and the Howard Colored Orphan Asylum. In addition, the Colored School was the first such school in the U.S. to integrate both its staff and its students. During the violent New York Draft Riots of 1863, the community served as a refuge for many African-Americans who fled from Manhattan. After the completion of the Brooklyn Bridge and as New York City grew and expanded, Weeksville gradually became part of Crown Heights, and memory of the village was largely forgotten. Rediscovery of Weeksville and the Hunterfly Road Houses The search for Historic Weeksville began in 1968 in a Pratt Institute workshop on Brooklyn and New York City neighborhoods led by historian James Hurley. After reading of Weeksville in Brooklyn's Eastern District, a 1942 book by Brooklyn historian Eugene Ambruster, Hurley and Joseph Haynes, a local resident and pilot, consulted old maps and flew over the area in an airplane in search of surviving evidence of the village. Four historic houses (now known as the Hunterfly Road Houses) were discovered off Bergen Street between Buffalo and Rochester Avenues, facing an old lane‚Äîa remnant of Hunterfly Road, which was at the eastern edge of the 19th century village. Weeksville today Weeksville is currently a working-class neighborhood with African- American and Hispanic residents as well as Caribbean immigrants from Trinidad & Tobago, St. Vincent & the Grenadines, Grenada, among others. As of 2015 Weeksville has been receiving attention from investment types, according to a broker with Douglass Elliman. There are still investment 'finds' to be had in this Brooklyn area. There are homes priced between $549,000 and $977,000. Weeksville's close proximity to public transportation is a major attraction to these new investors who have their eyes set on Weeksville. Weeksville Heritage Center The 1968 discovery of the Hunterfly Road Houses led to the formation of The Society for the Preservation of Weeksville and Bedford- Stuyvesant History (now the Weeksville Heritage Center). Joan Maynard was a founding member and executive director for the Preservation of Weeksville and Bedford-Stuyvesant History. The preservation of the Hunterfly Road Houses became her life's work. In 1970 the houses were declared New York City Landmarks, and in 1972 were placed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Hunterfly Road Historic District. See also: The houses were purchased by the Society in 1973, and in 2005, following a $3 million restoration, the houses reopened to the public as the Weeksville Heritage Center, with each house showcasing a different era of Weeksville history. Construction of an education and cultural center adjacent to the houses was completed in 2014.

Calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D, binds to the VDR, which then forms a heterodimer with the retinoid-X receptor. This then binds to hormone response elements on DNA resulting in expression or transrepression of specific gene products. The VDR not only regulates transcriptional responses but also involved in microRNA- directed post transcriptional mechanisms. In humans, the vitamin D receptor is encoded by the VDR gene. Glucocorticoids are known to decrease expression of VDR, which is expressed in most tissues of the body and regulate intestinal transport of calcium, iron and other minerals.  Function  The VDR gene encodes the nuclear hormone receptor for vitamin D3. This receptor also functions as a receptor for the secondary bile acid lithocholic acid. The receptor belongs to the family of trans-acting transcriptional regulatory factors and shows similarity of sequence to the steroid and thyroid hormone receptors. Downstream targets of this nuclear hormone receptor are involved principally in mineral metabolism though the receptor regulates a variety of other metabolic pathways, such as those involved in the immune response and cancer. Mutations in this gene are associated with type II vitamin D-resistant rickets. A single nucleotide polymorphism in the initiation codon results in an alternate translation start site three codons downstream. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding the same protein. VDR gene variants seem to influence many biological endpoints, including those related to osteoporosis The vitamin D receptor plays an important role in regulating the hair cycle. Loss of VDR is associated with hair loss in experimental animals. Experimental studies have shown that the unliganded VDR interacts with regulatory regions in cWnt (wnt signaling pathway) and sonic hedgehog target genes and is required for the induction of these pathways during the postnatal hair cycle. These studies have revealed novel actions of the unliganded VDR in regulating the post-morphogenic hair cycle.

The Greek Revival style house was owned by two Texas governors. Some notable people that have visited the mansion include Sam Houston, General George Custer, Elisabet Ney, Will Rogers, and Edith Head. Woodlawn was added to the National Register of Historic Places on August 25, 1970. History The site of Woodlawn originally consisted of in West Austin. Then Texas State Comptroller James Shaw commissioned master builder Abner H. Cook (who also designed the Texas Governor's Mansion) to build a house for him and his fianc√©e. Shaw's fianc√©e later broke off the engagement, but Shaw soon found another woman that he married and they lived in the house, which was completed in 1853. Tragedy struck when Shaw's child died at the age of two and his wife died a few months later. Shaw sold the estate to Texas governor Elisha M. Pease and his wife Lucadia Christiane Niles Pease in 1857 and Shaw moved to Galveston. The Peases named the estate Woodlawn. Pease developed most of the land surrounding Woodlawn into the present-day neighborhood of Enfield. Four generations of the Pease family lived at Woodlawn until 1957 when Niles Graham sold the house and its three remaining acres to outgoing Texas governor Allan Shivers and his wife Marialice Shary Shivers. The Shivers moved into Woodlawn on January 15, 1957, almost 100 years to the day when the Peases first moved into Woodlawn. On October 27, 1975, the Shivers donated Woodlawn to the University of Texas at Austin and University of Texas‚ÄìPan American with the stipulation that they could live there until their deaths (see Life estate). Allan Shivers died in 1985 and Marialice died on September 29, 1996. The University of Texas sold Woodlawn to the State of Texas in December, 1997 for $2.6 million. The proceeds endowed the Allan Shivers Chair in Law and Banking at the University of Texas School of Law and the Marialice Shivers Chair in Fine Arts at the University of Texas‚ÄìPan American. The state bought Woodlawn as Texas Lieutenant Governor Bob Bullock dreamed of making it the new Texas Governor's Mansion. Bullock died in 1999 and his dream passed with him. Since it no longer had a purpose for the estate and it was expensive to maintain, the State of Texas put Woodlawn up for sale in 2002 by sealed bid. Actress Sandra Bullock reportedly toured the home as a possible buyer but did not bid on it. Only one bid was received and it was not credible. The state then began to contact interested buyers. Austin investor and entrepreneur Jeff Sandefer signed a contract to purchase the estate in May 2002. The $3.1 million deal broke down in August 2002 as Sandefer was frustrated by the restrictions and restoration requirements from Austin's Historic Landmark Commission and what it might cost to implement. Finally, on November 15, 2002, the estate sold to Mr. Sandefer for $2,851,100 via the holding company Woodlawn-Pease, LLC.https://ourcpa.cpa.state.tx.us/coa/servlet/cpa.app.coa.CoaGetTp?Pg=tpid&Search;_Nm=woodlawn%20&Button;=search&Search;_ID=32006356615 Today, Woodlawn is the centerpiece of the Old West Austin Historic District which consists mostly of land formerly owned by the Pease family.OWANA - Old West Austin Neighborhood Association Notes # This information was obtained by phone from the Texas General Land Office Archives and Records.

Career  \\"Father of Section 504\\"  Bowe was the first executive director (CEO) of the first national cross- disability consumer advocacy organization, the American Coalition of Citizens with Disabilities (ACCD). The Coalition's signature achievement was securing the long-delayed implementation of Section 504, the world's first civil-rights provision for persons with disabilities. Bowe conceived and led the nationwide protest that led to issuance of landmark regulations for Section 504 in 1977. He later wrote Handicapping America, the first full-length text on social policy and disability, which was published by Harper & Row. In 1980, Bowe was the first person with a disability to represent any nation in the planning of the United Nations (UN) International Year of Disabled Persons (IYDP-1981). Today, many countries are represented in key UN committees by persons who themselves are individuals with disabilities, including 14 who are, as Bowe was, deaf. In the mid-1980s, he chaired the U.S. Congress Commission on Education of the Deaf (COED), which made 52 recommendations for improving education and rehabilitation. COED issued a public draft of its final report in January, 1988. The example he and COED set was not lost on the students at Gallaudet University across town when, in March, 1988, they launched the Deaf President Now protest. Section 504 led, in 1990, to the Americans with Disabilities Act. That same year, Bowe was the principal architect of the Television Decoder Circuitry Act, which was sponsored in the Senate by Tom Harkin and in the House by Edward Markey. The act requires that TV sets receive and display closed captions. The 1996 Telecommunications Act took it a step further, mandating that broadcast and cable programs themselves be captioned. In 2005 and 2006, Bowe gave invited testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce and conducted demonstrations of high-speed broadband communications for both the House and the U.S. Senate. Bowe's textbooks are in use at colleges and universities around the country and in several other nations. Making Inclusion Work (Prentice Hall) and Early Childhood Special Education (Thomson Delmar Learning) are two examples. He was also author of Universal Design in Education (published by Greenwood Publishing), of the encyclopedia entries on deafness and disabilities in Scholastic's New Book of Knowledge, and of several hundred articles in professional journals in public policy, special education, rehabilitation, and technology. In Disability in America 2006, a policy paper addressing health care, employment, and entitlements, Bowe outlined disability policy goals for 2006-2008.  Hofstra University  As a professor at Hofstra University on Long Island, Bowe helped to prepare more than 2,000 special-education teachers. He was given the Distinguished Teaching (University Teacher of the Year) Award in 1996. For five years, he was program director for special education. He also chaired several committees at Hofstra and served on doctoral dissertation committees at NYU and other universities. In 2006, he spearheaded a campus-wide project to make information and instruction more accessible to and usable by students, faculty, staff and alumni at Hofstra. The professor served on the editorial board of five professional journals and as governmental affairs consultant for the National Association of the Deaf (United States).  Selected quotes  *\\"America handicaps disabled people. And because that is true, we are handicapping America itself\\". (Handicapping America, 1978, p. vii) *\\"The present status of education for persons who are deaf in the United States is unsatisfactory. Unacceptably so. This is the primary and inescapable conclusion of the Commission on Education of the Deaf.\\" (Toward Equality: Education of the Deaf, 1988, p. viii) *\\"SSDI and SSI ... the rapid escalation of costs and the narrowing of employer [health insurance] coverage ... and other factors ... keep the American Dream out of reach for many Americans with disabilities.\\" (\\"Disability in America,\\" 2006) *\\"...[t]ake some of the money now spent on entitlements and turn it, instead, toward postsecondary education and vocational training for Americans with disabilities. ... take some (much less!) of it and put it toward real enforcement of ADA title I by the EEOC.

In 1994, Bowe was inducted into the National Hall of Fame for Persons with Disabilities. In 1992, he received the Distinguished Service Award of the President of the United States, signed by President George H. W. Bush.

Jerkens' father owned a riding academy on Long Island that led to his interest in horse racing, and in the spring of 1950 he obtained a trainer's license. Sometimes called the \\"Giant Killer\\", he is best known for his upsets. Jerkens saddled the 1973 Whitney Handicap winner Onion (defeating Secretariat), 1973 Woodward Stakes and Jockey Club Gold Cup winner Prove Out (defeating Secretariat and Riva Ridge, respectively), and Beau Purple, who defeated Kelso in three of their four meetings. His horses defeated other greats such as Buckpasser, Cougar II, and Forego. In 1973, Jerkens was voted the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Trainer, and in 1975 he became the youngest trainer ever inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame at the age of 45. Another of Jerkens' top horses was the filly Sky Beauty, who in 1993 swept the American Triple Tiara by winning the Acorn Stakes, the Mother Goose Stakes and the Coaching Club American Oaks. She won four Grade I races the following year en route to an Eclipse Award as outstanding older female. In total, Jerkens won more than 200 stakes races. Jerkens was inducted into the Suffolk Sports Hall of Fame on Long Island in the Horse Racing Category with the Class of 1992. Jerkens was hospitalized in Florida on March 3, 2015 with an infection. He died on March 18, 2015 at the age of 85. Among his survivors are sons Jimmy and Steven, who are also thoroughbred trainers, son Allen and daughter Julie. In 2017 the New York Racing Association renamed the King's Bishop Stakes for Jerkens, who himself trained King's Bishop to wins in the 1973 Carter Handicap and Fall Highweight Handicap for Allaire du Pont.

It is set in the titular Blackwoods. Plot Matt Sullivan (Patrick Muldoon) travels with his girlfriend, Dawn (Keegan Connor Tracy) from their urban residence in Denver on a vacation to the Blackwoods of Colorado, only to discover a motel run by a motel clerk, Greg (Clint Howard), a deranged family, and a horrific secret. Matt is haunted by the death of a girl from a car accident he caused years ago. Matt was drunk and as he reached for the car radio, he struck the girl as she crossed the road. The guilt that he feels has altered his sense of reality, making Matt's life a mystery full of shadows and phantoms. Now, years later Matt goes away for weekend with his new girlfriend Dawn. During a stopover in a small town, Matt and Dawn have lunch at a local diner where he notices several of the locals staring oddly at him. On the road, Matt is pulled over by the local sheriff, Harding (Michael Par√©) who asks Matt who he is and what he is doing passing through the town. After Matt explains about his private getaway Sheriff Harding lets him go. Matt checks into a local motel where he interacts with the debauched motel clerk and owner Greg who tries to overcharge him for his room for the night. A little later, after a wild session of lovemaking, Dawn goes for a walk. While she is away, a strange man with an ax comes into the motel room and attacks Matt who escapes. Matt calls the police where Sheriff Harding shows up and after finding no one around, openly suspects Matt of having an agenda to the suspicions of his story. After the sheriff lets Matt go, again without arresting him, Matt phones his friend Jim (Will Sanderson) where he tells him about Dawn's disappearance and asks Jim to come to his aid. After that incident Matt goes into the woods, looking for Dawn. There he encounters Dawn's family who tie him down and put him on trial for the murder of the girl years before. It turns out that Dawn is the twin sister of Molly, the young girl that Matt ran over with his car years earlier after he was driving drunk following an argument with his former girlfriend. The backwoods Franklin family find Matt guilty and he is sent back into the forest to be hunted down by the family. The deeper Matt runs into the forest the farther his mind is lost to the Blackwoods.Uwe Boll's Blackwoods Film Review - Toasted Pixel Matt manages to ambush and kill two of the family members, Jack and John, pursuing him through the woods. But the film's climatic twist comes when Jim appears after having tracked Matt down and Matt suddenly kills Jim, after thinking that he too is in league with the Franklin family. It turns out that Matt's girlfriend 'Dawn' is only a figment of his imagination. All of the interactions with Dawn and the rest of the family were fabrications that stemmed from Matt's guilt of running over the young woman years earlier and Matt at this point as become totally deranged and paranoid. Sheriff Harding follows some leads that Matt told him earlier into the woods and to the old Franklin house which is unoccupied and in disrepair (confirming that Matt's \\"trial\\" was indeed fabricated in his head). Harding finds Jim's dead body and then chases Matt through the woods to arrest him, only for Matt to run onto a main road where he is run over by a speeding truck and killed. The final scene shows Sheriff Harding telling his story to Beth, the waitress at the local diner, and how Matt's mental instability led to him dreaming up this waking nightmare about Dawn, her family, and of the other encounters in the Blackwoods. Cast Release The film was released direct-to-video on September 3, 2002, in North America. Critical reception Stephen Holden from The New York Times gave Blackwoods a positive review, describing it as \\"smarter and more diabolical than you could have guessed at the beginning.\\" Lou Lumenick of the New York Post gave a more negative review, calling Blackwoods a \\"low rent, direct-to-video-caliber thriller.\\"Movie Review - Blackwoods - FILM REVIEW; A Big, Bad Subconscious Lurks in a Dark Forest It has an 11% 'rotten' rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

The term \\"public works\\" is a calque (literal word-by-word translation) of the Latin. Public works in the Roman Empire were not merely buildings for the conduct of the business of running the city, but all buildings for public use. Therefore, temples, basilicae, theatres, porticoes, fora, walls of towns, aqueducts, harbours, bridges, baths (both thermae and balneae), fountains,Public Needs and Private Pleasures: Water Distribution, the Tiber River and the urban development of Ancient Rome, Rabun M. Taylor circuses, markets, cloacae, roads, etc. were classified as opera publica.Water Distribution in Ancient Rome: The Evidence of Frontinus, Harry B. Evans. Page 9,15, etc In the Late Roman Empire the citizens performed opera publica in lieu of paying taxes; often it consisted of road and bridge work. Roman landlords could also demand some days' labour from their tenants, and also from the freedmen; in the latter case, the work was called opera officiales. Public works were an important department, and the Roman censors were entrusted with the expenditure of this department's public money, though the actual payments were no doubt made by the quaestors. The censors had the general superintendence of all the public buildings and works and to meet the expenses connected with this part of their duties, the Senate voted them a certain sum of money or certain revenues, to which they were restricted, but which they might at the same time employ according to their discretion.Polybius vi.13; Livy xl.46, xliv.16. They had to see that the temples and all other public buildings were in a good state of repair,aedes sacras tueri and sarta tecta exigere, Livy xxiv.18, xxix.37, xlii.3, xlv.15. that no public places were encroached upon by the occupation of private persons,loca tueri, Livy xlii.3, xliii.16. and that the aqueduct, roads, drains, etc. were properly attended to. The repairs of the public works and the keeping of them in proper condition were let out by the censors by public auction to the lowest bidder, just as the vectigalia were let out to the highest bidder. These expenses were called ultrotributa, and hence we frequently find vectigalia and ultrotributa contrasted with one another.Livy xxxix.44, xliii.16. The persons who undertook the contract were called conductores, mancipes, redemptores, susceptores, etc.; and the duties they had to discharge were specified in the Leges Censoriae. The censors also had to superintend the expenses connected with the worship of the gods, even for instance the feeding of the sacred geese in the Capitol; these various tasks were also let out on contract.Plutarch Roman Questions 98; Pliny Natural History x.22; Cicero pro Sexto Roscio Amerino Oratio 20. The censors were in charge of keeping existing public buildings and facilities in a proper state of repair, but also constructing new ones, either for ornament or utility, both in Rome and in other parts of Italy. These works were either performed by them jointly, or they divided between them the money, which had been granted to them by the Senate.Liv. xl.51, xliv.16. They were let out to contractors, like the other works mentioned above, and when they were completed, the censors had to see that the work was performed in accordance with the contract: this was called opus probare or in acceptum referre.Cicero In Verrem i.57; Livy iv.22, xlv.15; Lex Puteol. p73, Spang. The aediles had likewise a superintendence over the public buildings, and it is not easy to define with accuracy the respective duties of the censors and aediles, but it may be remarked in general that the superintendence of the aediles had more of a police character, while that of the censors were more financial in subject matter. Cicero (Legg. iii. 3, 7) divided the functions of the aediles under three heads: Care of provisions (quality inspection), care of the games (and also festivals) and public works, which he called \\"care of the city\\". He notes responsibilities including the repair and preservation of temples, sewers and aqueducts; street cleansing and paving; regulations regarding traffic, dangerous animals and dilapidated buildings; precautions against fire; superintendence of baths and taverns; enforcement of sumptuary laws; punishment of gamblers and usurers; the care of public morals generally, including the prevention of foreign superstitions. Aediles also punished those who had too large a share of the ager publicus, or kept too many cattle on the state pastures.

Whilst working as a public servant FitzGerald's private passion and ability regarding ornithology and botany became so skillful that he communicated directly with Charles Darwin regarding Australian species of plant and was referred to several times in the book The Different Forms of Flowers on Plants of the Same Species of 1877. He also collected orchids for the great German-Australian botanist Ferdinand von Mueller. His extraordinary skills gave rise to a volume of work completed over seven years called Australian Orchids which Joseph Dalton Hooker another botanist, considered would be an honour to any country and to any Botanist. Biography Early life FitzGerald was born in Tralee, Co. Kerry, Ireland. His father, also Robert David FitzGerald, was a banker, and his mother was Mary Ann, n√©e Bell. He studied civil engineering at Queen's College, Cork, (now known as University College Cork), and emigrated to Australia. Working as a surveyor FitzGerald arrived in Sydney, Australia in 1856 and a short time later was appointed to the Department of Lands as a draftsman for the crown. Working steadily until 1868 FitzGerald was then promoted to control the roads branch of that department. By 1873 he had become Deputy Surveyor General, and by 1874 he had been given responsibility as the Chief Mining Surveyor as well as controller of Church and School Lands for New South Wales. Following the advent of the Crown Lands Act of 1884 part of his duty was to analyse and consider the future roles of his department and ironically that analysis resulted in a number of retrenchments including his own. Ornithology and botany In his private life FitzGerald developed his skills as an ornithologist. Coupled with his skills as a taxidermist he initially (during 1855-56) contributed a number of articles on the birds of his hometown Kerry to that town's magazine. More specifically FitzGerald had an enormous interest in botany and in 1864 he travelled to Wallis Lake, north of Newcastle in New South Wales to collect ferns and orchids which he intended to cultivate around his Hunter's Hill home. This interest in orchids was maintained throughout his life and in 1869, 1871 and 1876 he visited Lord Howe Island to collect further botanical samples. It was during this time that he discovered Dracophyllum fitzgeraldii F. Muell, which was later to be named in his honour. Marriage and children FitzGerald married Emily Blackwell, daughter of Edward Hunt, M.L.C., at Balmain in 1860. FitzGerald had three sons and three daughters who survived his death. His grandson was the Australian poet R. D. Fitzgerald. Death FitzGerald died on 12 August 1892 at Hunter's Hill, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia and he was buried in the Presbyterian section of the old Balmain Cemetery. Published works Australian Orchids From 1875 until 1882 in association with Arthur James Stopps who was a lithographer in the same public offices that he worked at, FitzGerald published seven parts of his work Australian Orchids. The exquisite lithograph plates detailing FitzGerald's dissections of orchids, were hand-coloured by artists following his samples and instructions. Australian Orchids made FitzGerald famous in the botanical world and Joseph Dalton Hooker another botanist, considered the work one \\"which would be an honour to any country and to any Botanist\\". Australian Orchids included descriptions of more than two hundred species. Fitzgerald was encouraged by the government of the day, who covered his costs and published his work, but the author died before the task was completed and nearly one hundred of his unpublished drawings are held in the Mitchell Library. After completing his drawings, Fitzgerald did not dry and preserve the specimens but threw them away, so few species he described and named have preserved type specimens. No attempt was made to follow any system of classification and the plates and pages were not numbered, making it difficult for readers to find a particular drawing. Manuscript notes Manuscript notes on botanical species including watercolour sketches and diagrams with botanical annotations which were completed by hand by Fitzgerald between 1870 and 1890, and are held by National Library of Australia. Published drawings The originals of FitzGerald's drawings completed in Sydney published between 1874 and 1894, of Australian orchids including 196 water-colour and pencil drawings with the artists pencilled notes in 2 volumes is held as a part of the Mitchell and Dixson Libraries Manuscripts Collection, State Library of New South Wales. Published letters A number of letters dated between 1871 and 1892 from FitzGerald to the German/Australian botanist Ferdinand von Mueller about Australian plants and their identification with references to Herbarium specimens as well as a single letter from G.H. Druce to FitzGerald are held at the National Herbarium of Victoria, Melbourne.

It was directed by Albert Parker, and was based on the play The Eyes of Youth by Max Marcin and Charles Guernon. Produced by and starring Gloria Swanson, it also stars John Boles and Pauline Garon. A copy of The Love of Sunya still survives and is kept in the Paul Killiam collection. Plot The film depicts a young woman (Swanson) given by a mystic an occasional glimpse into her future, notably her future with different men. Cast *Gloria Swanson - Sunya Ashling *John Boles - Paul Judson *Pauline Garon - Anna Hagan *Ian Keith - Louis Anthony *Andres de Segurola - Paola deSalvo *Anders Randolf - Robert Goring *Hugh Miller - The Outcast *Robert Schable - Henri Picard *Ivan Lebedeff - Ted Morgan *John Miltern - Asa Ashling *Raymond Hackett - Kenneth Ashling *Florence Fair - Rita Ashling Production background The film was Swanson's first independent production; she later called it an \\"agonizing ordeal\\". She chose to film another adaptation of Max Marcin and Charles Guernon's play, for it had been filmed once before in 1919, starring Clara Kimball Young, and was a resounding success on Broadway.Soister 2012 p.347-348 Swanson hired Albert Parker, who had directed the 1919 film, in the hope, given that Parker was already familiar with the material, that the production would be quicker. Swanson ignored advice to shoot the film in Hollywood and opted to rent space in William Randolph Hearst's Cosmopolitan Studios in New York City. Production began in September 1926 but problems quickly arose due to Swanson's lack of experience as a producer.Koszarski 2008 p.131 The production soon ran over budget and was marred by several other problems, mainly the lack of a suitable cameraman to deal with the film's intricate double exposures. According to Swanson's autobiography, the services of cinematographer George Barnes were eventually secured, though he is given no screen credit. Reception The Love of Sunya premiered at the grand opening of the Roxy Theatre in New York City on March 11, 1927. Swanson later wrote that the film received a standing ovation. Despite this initial good reception and decent reviews from critics,Soister 2012 p.349 the film performed poorly at the box office, and barely recouped its budget. Swanson felt it was terrible. Owing to its failure, producer Joseph M. Schenck convinced Swanson to come back to Hollywood and to film something more commercial. Swanson agreed but ended up filming the more controversial Sadie Thompson (1928) instead, which became her most successful independent production.

Background Born in Takoma Park, Maryland, Austin had been a career criminal for much of his adult life serving sentences for grand larceny, forgery, aggravated assault, escaping prison and, most notably, threatening the President of the United States when Austin sent a threatening letter to then-President Lyndon Johnson as an inmate at the Idaho State Penitentiary (which would result in an additional five years to his sentence). In February 1979, although having a history of attempted prison escapes and repeated altercations with police officers, Austin won parole from prison in Kansas City, Missouri and, upon his release, immediately headed south with the intentions of beginning a crime spree where, on February 28, Austin robbed a bank in Houston, Texas of $60,000. By mid-July, Austin had raided a series of banks throughout the Southeast from Kentucky to Florida when federal authorities, who had previously charged Austin with bank robbery and unlawful flight to avoid prosecution, officially added Austin to the FBI's \\"Ten Most Wanted List\\" on October 12. After a five-month-long federal investigation, Austin was eventually traced to a rented apartment in Tucson, Arizona where Austin was arrested by federal agents on March 1, 1980. At the time of his arrest, Austin had a loaded pistol as well as $10,000 in his possession (a small amount of money from the Houston robbery had been marked, allowing Austin to be connected directly to the crime). Austin, charged with three counts of his three known robberies, was held in custody in lieu of a $35,000 bond before his eventual conviction and imprisonment.

He is the Governor of San Luis Province. He was presidential candidate for the center-right peronism, Federal Peronism, in 2007 and 2011. The Rodriguez Sa√° family is well known in the Province of San Luis and can be traced to the nineteenth century and to descendants of the Federalist revolutionary Juan Sa√°, an important figure in the Argentine Civil Wars of the mid nineteenth century. His brother, Adolfo Rodr√≠guez Sa√°, was governor of San Luis from 1983 until 2001, when he became interim President of Argentina, resigning after a week.  Biography  Born in San Luis, Rodriguez Sa√° completed his undergraduate studies at the University of Buenos Aires where he earned a Law degree in 1974, specializing in Constitutional Guarantees. He married Mar√≠a Antonia Salino, and they had three children; they were later divorced. He was hired as a legal advisor to the CGT, the nation's largest trade union, in 1980. Between 1983 and 1994, he served as senator for the Province of San Luis. Serving this position in 1986, he voted against the Ley de Punto Final that established the suspension of legal proceedings against the perpetrators of illegal detentions, torture and murder during the military dictatorship. Between 1989 and 1993 he was President of the Justicialist caucus in the Argentine Senate. With presidential aspirations of his own, in October 1993 he voted against the government project to amend the National Constitution and allow the reelection of the then-President Carlos Menem, known as the \\"Pacto de Olivos\\". This has been linked to the kidnapping of his brother shortly afterwards. He resigned from his seat in December 1994. The old library of the University of Salamanca. Rodriguez Sa√° completed postgraduate programs at the University of Salamanca, Spain, in Constitutional Law, Community Law and in Art History. He developed a strong interest in environmental and artistic activities, promoting the development of cultural proposals on a national scale. Subsequent to his various postgraduate studies in Spain, he returned to Argentina in 2000 and was elected again as National Senator, being one of the four senators who voted against the Labor Flexibilization Law (pejoratively called \\"Ley Banelco\\" for the cash bribes offered a number of senators for its passage by President Fernando de la R√∫a's administration). He resigned for the Senate in 2001, and served as Head of the Cabinet of Ministers Leadership of San Luis Province. He was elected Governor of the Province in 2003, and was re-elected in 2007 with over 80% of the vote; the runner up, with 12.2% of the vote, was Roque Palma of the Popular Socialist Party. In 2003 he called for mayoral elections in San Luis, although this exceeded his authority. For a year there were two municipal governments in the city, until the Argentine Supreme Court ruled against Rodriguez Sa√° and the municipal government his elections had installed was disbanded. Rodriguez Saa promoted a constitutional amendment blocking indefinite re-election in the Province of San Luis. He ran for President in the 2007 general election, representing the more conservative \\"internal line\\" of the Justicialist Party, which opposes Kirchnerism. His coalition won nearly 1.5 million votes in 2007 (7.6%), and earned fourth place in a crowded field. In 2011, during his second term as Governor of the Province of San Luis, he was distinguished as ‚ÄúGlobal Ambassador for Peace‚Äù by the World Organization for Peace. This award is given to the highest world personalities such as Kofi Annan, former Secretary General of the United Nations. He won the award for his policies in San Luis on \\"Social Inclusion\\", \\"Sustainable Environment\\", \\"Health and Work\\", \\"Nuclear Nonproliferation,\\" and \\"General Welfare.\\" He is known to heavily campaign in areas where he is certain of winning the majority of votes. His reason for doing so is not to obtain more votes, but to \\"monitor\\" local officials to ensure they are responding to the desires of the populace. Alberto Rodriguez Saa & Al Gore, San Luis, Argentina, 2009 A friend of former U.S. Vice President and Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Al Gore, with whom he has had several meetings in the Province of San Luis, Alberto Rodriguez Sa√° received several awards from the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), and an official acknowledgment from the Senate of Argentina, both for his environmental policies. Soon after being nominated as Global Ambassador for Peace, Alberto Rodriguez Sa√° received the Tiradentes Medal, previous winners of which include former Brazilian President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva and Pope John Paul II. The distinction is in recognition of his humanitarian support including food and aid relief that Rodriguez Sa√° offered to various Argentine provinces, Brazil, Peru, China, Iran and Haiti; he was also recognized for this by the United States Embassy. The province of San Luis was voted the best managed in the country by private consultants for the seventh consecutive year, in Tax Efficiency Policy, Social indicators, Infrastructure, Fiscal Solvency and International Trade. Moreover, in its ambition to create a local \\"Silicon Valley,\\" San Luis came fourth in a ranking of 150 'digital cities' developed by Motorola. Rodr√≠guez Sa√° sought the Federal Peronist nomination for the Presidency in 2011. Neither he nor his main rival, former President Eduardo Duhalde, were able to secure a clear majority ahead of the August 14 primaries, however, and each man ran on his own slate: Rodr√≠guez Sa√° on the Federal Commitment, and Duhalde on the Popular Front. Both were handily defeated by the incumbent, President Cristina Kirchner, though Rodr√≠guez Sa√° (who earned 1.7 million votes, or 8%) won in his native San Luis Province; he became the only candidate other than Mrs. Kirchner to win in any one jurisdiction. International Awards & Honors \\"Distinction for his commitment to environmental protection and combating desertification, land degradation and mitigating the effects of drought\\" (June 2011) delivered by the United Nations Convention to combat desertification. Recognition to the Government of the Province of San Luis by the Senate of the Argentinian Nation (March 2011), for having signed in September 6, 2010, the Agreement called \\"Ten Commandments of peace between Progress and the Environment\\" and for the effective implementation of sustainable development policies. Upon signing the Treaty of Peace between Progress and the Environment, the Provincial Governor Alberto Rodriguez Saa was greeted by three Nobel Peace Prize winners (Wangari Maathai, Osvaldo Canziani, and Perez Esquivel). \\"Tiradentes Medal\\", considered the highest distinction granted by the Carioca State. It is the same award that in previous years was assigned to former Brazilian President Luis Ignacio Lula da Silva and Pope John Paul II. \\"Global Ambassador for Peace\\" (March 2011), the highest distinction made by the World Peace Organization in Geneva, for his policies put forward in San Luis on \\"Social Inclusion\\", \\"Sustainable Environment\\" \\"Health and Work\\", \\"Nuclear Nonproliferation,\\" and \\"General Welfare\\", an honor previously bestowed upon Kofi Annan, former Secretary General of the United Nations. \\"Distinction of the United Nations Environment Program\\" based in Kenya (March 2011) for having planted more than four million trees.

It is composed of three neighborhoods located on a plateau just west of downtown Austin: Old Enfield, Pemberton Heights, and Bryker Woods. Developed between 1886 and 1953, the three historic neighborhoods stretch from Mopac Expressway east to Lamar Boulevard, and from 13th Street north to 35th Street. It borders Clarksville Historic District and the West Line Historic District to the south. The streetcar had propelled Austin's earlier local suburban development, but Enfield, Pemberton Heights, and Bryker Woods were the city's first automobile suburbs. As a well-preserved collection of early-to-mid-20th century residences, the historic district evokes the measured spread of suburban development that paralleled the city's steady growth. The three neighborhoods that together form Old West Austin were added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2003. Settlement of Old West Austin For much of the 19th century, Shoal Creek and West Avenue defined the western edge of the city. Austin was planned on a 640-acre site on a bluff above the Colorado River, nestled between Shoal Creek (West Avenue) to the west and Waller Creek (East Avenue) to the east Edwin Waller in 1839. The story of the settlement of Old West Austin begins with the oldest and best- known home in the area, Woodlawn. James B. Shaw, an Irish immigrant who served as State Comptroller in Texas Governor Elisha M. Pease's administration, purchased several hundred acres of land west of Austin in 1846. Shaw commissioned Austin architect Abner Cook to build a two-story Greek Revival mansion on his property. The house was finished in 1853, one year before Cook built the Texas Governor's Mansion. Almost as soon as the building was completed Shaw abandoned the idea of living there because of family tragedies. In 1856, Governor Pease bought Woodlawn, and it remained in his family for nearly fifty years. Woodlawn's adjoining acreage would eventually be sold and subdivided to create the Enfield neighborhood. Following emancipation at end of the Civil War, Texas Governor Pease sold and gave some of his plantation land to his freed black slaves. In 1871 this neighboring area came to be known as Clarksville and was legally set apart from the other areas of town specifically for the freed black slaves. It was called Clarksville because Charles (Griffin) Clark, a land developer with an eye to reselling to the newly freed slaves, purchased a tract of land from former slaves where he founded the town of Clarksville, less than one-half mile from Woodlawn. Other important West Austin developments during the 1870s included the establishment of the International and Great Northern Railroad, which defines the historic district's western boundary, and the establishment of Pease Park, which define the district's eastern boundary. The land was donated to the city by the Pease family. Shoal Creek is the centerpiece of Pease Park. The waterway attracted recreational use as early as the mid-nineteenth century. Old Enfield The oldest and southernmost neighborhood in the historic district is Old Enfield. Its approximate boundaries are Windsor Road on the north, Pease Park on the east, 13th Street to the south, and the Mo-Pac Expressway on the west. Originally part of the Pease family's plantation just west of Austin, the neighborhood was subdivided in 1910 by the Enfield Realty and Home Building Company. Old Enfield is home to many of the oldest colonial style-homes in Austin, including Woodlawn which was built by Texas Governor's Mansion architect Abner Cook. Additionally, Old Enfield encompasses several additions platted between 1914 and 1948. Two later additions were platted on the west side of the historic district after 1948. The plan for Old Enfield is largely intact incorporating several small island parks along curvilinear streets at the edge of Pease Park. Pemberton Heights Due north of Old Enfield is the suburb of Pemberton Heights. The area that would become Pemberton Heights was acquired in 1858 by Judge John Harris, who was the attorney general for Governor Pease and husband of the daughter of Samuel Rhoads Fisher, a signer of the Texas Declaration of Independence. S.W. Fisher, president of the Austin Development Company, also became an owner and ultimately developed the land. The subdivision was named after James Pemberton (1723‚Äì1809), an ancestor of the Fischer family who received notoriety because of his political views during the days of the American colonies. The Fisher family went on to inherit the farm and would establish the Austin Land Company. In 1927, the company built a bridge across Shoal Creek and began development. Between 1927 and the early 1940s, Pemberton Heights was developed in 12 sections. Pemberton Heights is primarily one to two-story single-family residences and not as many duplexes as the other neighborhoods. It has, on average, the largest houses and most spacious lots in the Old West Austin Historic District. Over 25 structures in Pemberton Heights have been designated as Austin Historic Landmarks by the City Council including the Windsor Road Bridge, which was built in 1928. Its importance stems not only from its architectural merit, but also because prior to its construction, Pemberton Heights and other Old West Austin area residents could only access downtown by crossing Shoal Creek on the State Street Bridge, which is now a pedestrian bridge adjacent to the 34th Street Bridge. Bryker Woods Bryker Woods is the northernmost suburb of the Old West Austin Historic District. The suburb encompasses several parcels of land that were platted between 1886 and 1951. Bryker Woods experienced intense development between 1936 and 1940. By the late 1990s, the State of Texas began exploring improvement and expansion of Mopac Expressway. By 2000, Bryker Woods, Pemberton Heights, Old Enfield, and Old West Austin neighborhoods organized because of concerns over the potential expansion of Loop 1, which they believed would result in the demolition of as many as 80 houses. In 2003, they were successful in establishing the Old West Austin Historic District. One significant aspect of this historic designation is that federal law requires additional studies, review, and approval if using federal dollars on a project that could result in the demolition of properties in the district, which adds significant time and cost to the project. As federal dollars are needed for the expansion of Loop 1, this designation prevented the expansion of Loop 1 beyond its current right-of-way within these neighborhoods. Description and significance The area is noted for approximately 1,574 historically significant properties within its borders.

One purpose is to avoid complexity in laws, to avoid any hidden that legislators or voters may miss when reading the proposed law. Another is to prevent legislators attaching an unpopular provision (\\"rider\\") to an unrelated popular one, whether in the hope of sneaking the unpopular one through, or in the hope of causing the popular one to be rejected (a type of wrecking amendment). Scope of a bill In English law, the long title of a bill or act of parliament states its purpose; this may enumerate multiple purposes, or end with a vague formula like \\"and for other purposes\\". A proposed amendment to a bill may be rejected if it is outside the scope defined in its long title; alternatively, the title may be amended to increase its scope. An omnibus bill covers a number of diverse or unrelated topics. By country Australia Section 55 of the Constitution of Australia provides a single-subject rule for taxation legislation: \\"Laws imposing taxation shall deal only with the imposition of taxation, and any provision therein dealing with any other matter shall be of no effect\\". The same section also requires laws imposing taxation to \\"deal with one subject of taxation only\\" (except those relating to customs and excise).Constitution of Australia, section 55 Ireland The 1937 Constitution of Ireland states that \\"A Bill containing a proposal or proposals for the amendment of this Constitution shall not contain any other proposal\\". This was in contrast to the 1922 Constitution of the Irish Free State, which could be implicitly amended. Switzerland In Swiss law, the \\"principle of the unity of the subject matter\\" (, , ) applies to federal popular initiatives and to parliamentary legislation that is subject to a referendum. It has been derived by the Swiss Federal Supreme Court from the provision in article 34, section 2 of the Swiss Federal Constitution which guarantees \\"the freedom of the citizen to form an opinion and to give genuine expression to his or her will\\" in the exercise of political rights. The Court has outlined the principle as follows: :\\"The principle of the unity of the subject matter requires that the subject of a referendum may, in principle, have only one topic area as its subject, that is, that two or several substantive questions or subject matters may not be joined into one referendum proposition in such a way that the voters face a dilemma and do not have a free choice between the several parts. If an item of legislation addresses several substantive questions or subject matters, the unity of the subject matter is only preserved if the several parts have a material intrinsic connection with each other, are materially related to each other and are aimed at the same goal; this material connection may not be merely artificial, subjective or political in nature. (...) Because the concept of the unity of the subject matter is a relative one, and because the weight given to the several parts of a legislative proposition and their relationship to each other is principally a political question, the authorities enjoy wide discretion in the shaping of referendum propositions.\\" Swiss Federal Supreme Court, judgment 1P.223/2006 of 12 September 2006, section 2; author's translation of the German original. United States The single subject rule exists in 43 state constitutions in the United States of America. 41 states apply the rule to all legislation, whereas Mississippi and Arkansas apply it only to appropriations bills. For example, the constitution of Minnesota, Article IV, Section 17, requires that \\"No law shall embrace more than one subject, which shall be expressed in its title.\\" Conversely, neither the U.S. Congress nor the U.S. Constitution has such a rule so riders which are completely unrelated to the main bill are commonplace. These amendments are often put into bills at the last minute, so that any representative who may read the legislation before actually voting on it will not have a chance to catch it. An effort is underway, however, to add a single subject amendment to the U.S. Constitution to apply a single subject rule to the Congress. It has been charged that single-subject rules have been misused as a political or judicial measure to slow or nullify ballot initiatives. An example of accusation of misuse of this law occurred in Colorado when a former governor made a statement against a single-subject ruling. The rule can also result in overly narrow questions, that result in no substantial effects. In July 2006, the Georgia Supreme Court ruled that a November 2004 amendment to the constitution of Georgia against same-sex marriage would be allowed to stand, despite also banning recognition of same- sex marriages done in other states, and banning civil unions. Additionally, voters in the referendum were told of only the same-sex marriage question, while the ballot failed to mention the other two issues, preventing voters from giving fully informed consent. A judge had previously ruled that voters had the right to decide the issue of civil unions separately, thus putting the two issues as one violated Georgia's single-subject rule.

The TSH receptor is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily of integral membrane proteins and is coupled to the Gs protein. It is primarily found on the surface of the thyroid epithelial cells, but also found on adipose tissue and fibroblasts. The latter explains the reason of the myxedema finding during Graves disease.  Function  Upon binding circulating TSH, a G-protein signal cascade activates adenylyl cyclase and intracellular levels of cAMP rise. cAMP activates all functional aspects of the thyroid cell, including iodine pumping; thyroglobulin synthesis, iodination, endocytosis, and proteolysis; thyroid peroxidase activity; and hormone release.

As of the 2018-2019 school year, its attendance is roughly 1,371. Mill Valley is a member of the Kansas State High School Activities Association and offers a variety of sports programs. Athletic teams compete in the 6A division and are known as the \\"Jaguars\\". Extracurricular activities are also offered in the form of performing arts, school publications, and clubs. History The school began classes in 2000‚Äì01. In 2008, the school district proposed and passed two bond issues to expand the school because of ongoing increases in attendance. Construction on Mill Valley began in February 2009. The construction was finished in the summer of 2010. The second expansion of the school building follows a prior extension of the \\"A\\" hallway including the construction of a dedicated art wing. Extracurricular activities Arts Choral Music Mill Valley's choral program offers a two mixed chorusus, two girls groups, and a mixed ensemble. The Jag Chorale, Mill Valley's advanced mixed chorus, has sung with the Kansas City Chorale, and has received straight one ratings in Male, Female, and Mixed group performance at contest in 2013 and 2014.

Life and career  Levine was born in Kletsk, near Minsk (now in Belarus), then in the Russian Empire. He moved with his family to New York when he was 8 years old where his family took on a more English sounding surname. The family settled in Brooklyn where Levine graduated from Boys' High School. He received a bachelor's degree at City College and a master's degree and, in 1923, an M.D. degree at Cornell University Medical School. About 1925 Levine became assistant to Karl Landsteiner at the Rockefeller Institute, New York City. In 1932 he took up research work on the bacteriophage at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. Back in the east in 1935, he worked as a bacteriologist and serologist at Newark Beth Israel Hospital, New Jersey where, in 1939, Levine and Rufus E. Stetson published their findings about a family who had a stillborn baby in 1937 who had died of hemolytic disease of the newborn. This publication included the first suggestion that a mother could make blood group antibodies owing to immune sensitization to her fetus's red blood cells.

Online pharmacies include: *Pharmacy benefits managers ‚Äì Entities that administrate corporate prescription drug plans. * Legitimate Internet pharmacies in the same country as the person ordering. * Legitimate Internet pharmacies in a different country than the person ordering. This type of pharmacy is usually licensed by its home country and follows those regulations, not those of the international orders. * Illegal or unethical internet pharmacies. The web page for an illegal pharmacy may contain lies about its home country, procedures, or certifications. The \\"pharmacy\\" may send outdated (expired shelf life) or counterfeit medications and may not follow standard procedural safeguards. Home delivery Conventional 'bricks and mortar' pharmacies usually have controlled drug distribution systems from the manufacturer, sufficient validation, and follow good distribution practices. Home delivery of pharmaceuticals can be a desirable convenience, but sometimes it can lead to problems with uncontrolled distribution. The shipment of drugs through the mail and parcel post is sometimes a concern for temperature-sensitive pharmaceuticals. Uncontrolled shipping conditions can include high and low temperatures outside the listed storage conditions for a drug. For example, the US FDA found the temperature in a mailbox in the sun could reach while the ambient air temperature was . Shipment by express mail and couriers reduces transit time and often involves delivery to the door, rather than a mailbox. The use of insulated shipping containers also helps control drug temperatures, reducing risks to drug safety and efficacy. Risks and concerns * Illegal or unethical pharmacies sometimes send outdated, substituted, or counterfeit medications to the person who ordered the drug instead of the real medication.Counterfeit medical products, WHO; Report by the Secretariat, A61/16, 7 April 2008.Mark Davison, \\"Pharmaceutical Anti-Counterfeiting: Combating the Real Danger from Fake Drugs\\", Wiley, 2011, 426pp * Sometimes, an online pharmacy may not be located in a country that is claimed. For example, one study of drug shipments claiming to be from Canada revealed many of the drugs actually originated in several other countries and were often false medications. * Minors can order controlled substances without adult supervision. * Other concerns include potential lack of confidentiality, improper packaging, inability to check for drug interactions, and several other issues. Discussion Canisters containing pharmaceuticals are loaded into an automatic dispensing machine at a mail-order pharmacy. Legitimate mail-order pharmacies are somewhat similar to community pharmacies; one primary difference is the method by which the medications are requested and received. Some customers consider this to be more convenient than traveling to a community drugstore, in the same way as ordering goods online rather than going to a shop. While many Internet pharmacies sell prescription drugs only with a prescription, some do not require a written prescription, as prescriptions may not be necessary in some countries. Some customers order drugs from such pharmacies to avoid the cost and inconvenience of visiting a doctor or to obtain medications their doctors are unwilling to prescribe. People living in the United States and other countries where prescription medications are costly may turn to online pharmacies to save money. Online pharmacies in the United States are required to be approved by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP). Many of the reputable websites employ their in-house physicians to review the medication request and write a prescription accordingly. Some websites offer medications without a prescription or a doctor review. This practice has been criticized as potentially dangerous, especially by those who feel that only doctors can reliably assess contraindications, risk/benefit, and the suitability of a medication for a specific individual. Pharmacies offering medication without requiring a prescription, doctor review, or supervision are sometimes fraudulent and may supply counterfeit, ineffective, and possibly dangerous medicines. International consumers International consumers sometimes purchase drugs online from online pharmacies in their own countries or those located in other countries. Some of these pharmacies require prescriptions while others do not. Of those that do not require prescriptions, some ask the customer to fill in a health questionnaire with their order. Many drugs available at legitimate online pharmacies are produced by well-known manufacturers such as Pfizer, Wyeth, Roche, and generic drug makers Cipla and Ranbaxy of India and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries of Israel. However, it remains difficult for a patient to ascertain whether an online pharmacy is legitimate. Medicines obtained from rogue online pharmacies come with no guarantees concerning their identity, history, and source. A study in three cities in the Netherlands found that over 60% of the consumed sildenafil was obtained from illegal sources. Roger Bate from the American Enterprise Institute tested hundreds of prescription drug orders purchased over the Internet and discovered that properly credentialed online pharmacies, ones selling domestically and internationally, only sell lawfully-manufactured medicines. U.S. consumers Drug costs are a big point of attraction for online pharmacies. Shoppers can sometimes obtain 50 to 80 percent or more savings on U.S. prices at foreign pharmacies. The \\"Washington Post\\" reported that \\"millions of Americans have turned to Mexico and other countries in search of bargain drugs\\" and that \\"U.S. Customs estimates 10 million U.S. citizens bring in medications at land borders each year. An additional 2 million packages of pharmaceuticals arrive annually by international mail from Thailand, India, South Africa, and other countries. Still, more packages come from online pharmacies in Canada.\\"Millions of Americans Look Outside U.S. For Drugs, Washington Post, October 23, 2003, According to a Wall Street Journal/Harris Online poll in 2006, 80 percent of Americans favor importing drugs from Canada and other countries.Harris Interactive, September 16 2006 Factors independently associated with importation by U.S. residents are age greater than 45 years, south or west region of residence, Hispanic ethnicity, college education, poor or near-poor poverty status, lack of U.S. citizenship, travel to developing countries, lack of health insurance, high family out-of- pocket medical costs, trouble finding a healthcare provider, fair or poor self-reported health status, filling a prescription on the Internet, and using online chat groups to learn about health. Former US President Barack Obama's budget supported a plan to allow people to buy cheaper drugs from other countries.https://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSTRE51P53920090226 Reuters, Obama's budget supports drug import plana, February 26, 2009, A 2016 study suggested that providing health insurance coverage may significantly reduce personal prescription drug importation and the subsequent risk of exposure to counterfeit, adulterated, and substandard medications. Furthermore, health insurance coverage is likely to be particularly effective at reducing importation among Hispanic persons; those born in Latin America, Russia, or Europe; and people that traveled to developing countries. A report in the journal Clinical Therapeutics found that U.S. consumers face a risk of getting counterfeit drugs because of the rising Internet sales of drugs, with worldwide counterfeit drug sales, offline and online, projected to reach $75 billion by 2010.Risks in Ordering Drugs by Internet on the Rise Newswise, Retrieved on July 20, 2008. In 2015 the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimated that counterfeit sales approximated around $200 billion US in 2013. Independent research published by the National Bureau of Economic Research demonstrates that online pharmacies, U.S. and foreign, verified by certain credentialing entities, sell genuine medication and require a prescription. \\"In Whom We Trust: The Role of Certification Agencies in Online Drug Markets.\\" Bate, Roger, and Ginger Zhe Jin and Amarna Mathur. National Bureau of Economic Research. NBER Working Paper No. 17955. Issued in March 2012. In that study, all tested prescription drug orders were found to be authentic when ordered from online pharmacies approved by pharmacychecker.com (both international and U.S.-only); U.S. online pharmacies approved by the NABP, Verified Internet Pharmacy Practice Sites (VIPPS) program, or LegitScript; and Canadian-based online pharmacies approved by the Canadian International Pharmacy Association. Nine percent of tested products ordered from uncredentialed online pharmacies were counterfeit. There are two verification programs for online pharmacies that are recognized by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (NABP). One is VIPPS, which is operated by the NABP and was created in 1999. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) refers to Internet users interested in using an online pharmacy to the VIPPS program. The other is LegitScript, which as of September 2010 had approved over 340 Internet pharmacies as legitimate and identified over 47,000 \\"rogue\\" Internet pharmacies. Canadian and all non-U.S. online pharmacies that sell prescription medication to Americans, regardless of credentials, are not eligible for approval in the VIPPS and LegitScript programs.For VIPPS U.S. only standard see . For LegitScript's standards see . Overseas online pharmacies and U.S. law Legality and risks of purchasing drugs online depend on the specific kind and amount of drug being purchased. The FDA believes that organized criminal networks control many online pharmacies that sell illegal pharmaceutical products without prescriptions. In 2014, The U.S. FDA, in partnership with other federal and international agencies and technology companies like Google, took action against websites that were selling drugs to U.S. consumers. Mail Order Pharmacies are regulated by the federal laws of the U.S. and hundreds of them operate legally in the US. The U.S. FDA believes that ICANN should do more to block and seize what the agency views as illegal online pharmacy websites. ICANN has articulated the position that it does not have the organizational mandate to take down online pharmacies, stating in one post on its website, \\"that ICANN is not a court and is not empowered to resolve disputes when parties disagree over what constitutes illegal activity in multiple countries around the world.\\" The Electronic Frontier Foundation, a non-profit organization defending civil rights on the Internet, views the influence of the pharmaceutical industry on the Internet as a form of censorship that threatens the ability of American consumers to access medicines in other countries purchased from online pharmacies that sell legitimate medicines. A proposal called the Safe Importation Action Plan would allow states, wholesalers and pharmacies, but not patients, to buy drugs from Canada. Enforcement in the U.S. * It is illegal to purchase controlled substances from an overseas pharmacy. A person purchasing a controlled substance from such a pharmacy may be violating several federal laws that carry stiff penalties. * Any package containing prescription drugs may be seized by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The package may be held and eventually returned to the sender if the addressee does not respond and provide proof that they are allowed to receive these drugs (e.g., a valid prescription).See Regulatory Procedures Manual March 2010 page 9‚Äì83 for sample package detention notification letter In practice, the number of packages containing prescription drugs sent to the United States daily far exceeds CBP's capabilities to inspect them. In the past, packages often passed through customs even if they were not sent from Canada or otherwise didn't meet the requirements of section 844 of 21 USC. In 2006, some Canadian pharmacies reported that \\"as much as 5 percent\\" of orders from American consumers were being seized.\\" Seized drugs being released\\", Los Angeles Times, March 1, 2006 * The DEA and the FDA generally do not target consumers unless drugs are imported in large quantities (suggesting an intent to distribute) or represent a perceived danger to public health (opiates, amphetamines). * Rarely, drug importation laws are enforced on the local level. For example, in June 2005 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, several customers in online pharmacies were arrested by local law enforcement officers and charged with possession of a controlled substance without a prescription.\\"So is buying prescription drugs online illegal?\\", WAFB, June 3, 2005 * The act of the importation of the controlled substance from overseas violates 21 USC, Section 952 (up to 5 years in prison and $250,000 fine for the importation of non-narcotic Schedule III, IV, or V drugs; possibly more for narcotics and Schedule I and II drugs). The act of simple possession of a controlled substance without a valid prescription violates 21 USC, Section 844 (up to 1 year in prison and $1,000 fine). The FDA does not recognize online prescriptions: for a prescription to be valid, there must be a face-to-face relationship between the patient and the healthcare professional prescribing the drug. What exactly constitutes a \\"face-to-face\\" relationship is considered by many online pharmacies to be a subjective definition that would allow them to operate as an adjunct to the patient's physician if the patient submits medical records documenting a condition for which the requested medication is deemed appropriate for treatment. Sections 956 and 1301 provide exemptions for travellers who bring small quantities of controlled substances in or out of the country in person but not by mail. * Importation of an unapproved prescription drug (not necessarily a controlled substance) violates 21 USC, Section 301(aa), even for personal use. The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act does allow for the importation of drug products for unapproved new drugs for which there is no approved American version. However, this allowance does not allow for the importation of foreign-made versions of U.S. approved drugs. * The law further specifies that enforcement should be focused on cases in which the importation by an individual poses a threat to public health, and discretion should be exercised to permit individuals to make such importations in circumstances in which the prescription drug or device imported does not appear to present an unreasonable risk to the individual. * It is also illegal to import non-approved drugs (21 USC sections 331(d) and 355(a)); however, FDA policies suggest that, under certain circumstances, patients may be allowed to keep these drugs. * Individual U.S. states may implement laws regulating importation, possession, and trafficking in prescription drugs and controlled substances. * For several years, the states of Nevada,Nevada online pharmacy approval-Retrieved 2012-12-29 Minnesota, Illinois and Wisconsin have run official state programs to help their residents order lower-cost drugs from abroad to save money.

Canadian online pharmacies selling to United States customers Buying prescription drugs from even the most well-respected internet pharmacies in Canada often results in a prescription filled from drugs sourced not from Canada but Caribbean nations or from Eastern Europe. The Canadian online pharmacy that sells the drugs offers them at Canadian prices but buys at a still cheaper rate from third parties overseas; this has led to problems with prescriptions being filled with counterfeit drugs. Some pharmacists have left the business because of the ethical issues involved. In 2014, the largest online Canadian drug retailer was prohibited from selling wholesale drugs by Health Canada. Of the three primary entrepreneurs of online Canadian drugs sold to the United States, one has been imprisoned, one left the industry, and the third is under investigation for criminal wrongdoing. The same errors have occurred in U.S. pharmacies, notably CVS. For more about this, see \\"Canada Drugs' history and closure.\\" Indian consumers \\"[A lack of] regulatory control over drug advertisements on television or the Internet\\" combined with a growing E-commerce in India has led to a significant increase in the use of online pharmacies.The Indian government is planning to spend ‚Çπ5 billion ($70.5 million U.S.) on computer literacy projects for 5 million people over 3 years in order to help Indian citizens access government services in the fields of e-education, e-health, and e-governance. Health care providers in India were also expected to spend ‚Çπ78.92 billion ($1.1 billion U.S.) on IT products and services in 2014. These technologies could aid the country in meeting their healthcare objectives. Legal status in India While there are no laws specifically targeting online pharmacies in India, various laws govern online pharmacies indirectly. The Drugs and Cosmetics Act (1940) and the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules (1945) contain guidelines concerning the sale of Schedule H and Schedule X drugs, which can only be obtained through prescription. There are also specific rules for labeling and barcoding. It appears that electronic prescriptions should be valid, especially in the light of the Pharmacy Practice Regulations-2015 declared by the Pharmacy Council of India in January 2015. In these regulations, \\"prescription,\\" as defined by regulation 2, (j)[3] means \\"a written or electronic direction from a Registered Medical Practitioner.\\" Based on existing regulations, it appears that a scanned copy of a prescription would be considered as a valid prescription. However, whether such electronic prescriptions can be used to buy medicine from online pharmacies has been questioned. The Maharashtra Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) raided 27 online pharmacies located in Mumbai, Thane, and Pune and seized drugs worth ‚Çπ2 million. The Delhi High Court banned the online sale of medicines in the country on December 12, 2018 after listening to a Public Interest Litigation hearing by Dr. Ahmed Zaheer. This order illegalizes the sale of medicines through the Internet in India. The petitioner argued that the sale of medicines could only take place in licensed premises for which the licenses are issued under the Drug & Cosmetics Act 1940. Home delivery of medicines by online players is in contravention of the Act.  Pakistani consumers  In 2015, the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan Act passed for the registration of homeopathic, herbal, unani, allopathic, and nutraceutical products. This has also implied that only registered retail pharmacies can sell such items, along with OTC and Prescription medication, to the public. The sale of all drugs in Pakistan is subject to the Drugs Act of 1976. UK consumers In the U.K, more than 2 million people buy drugs regularly on the Internet from online pharmacies; some are legitimate, but others have \\"dangerous practices\\" that could endanger children.\\"eBay medicines 'a risk to child health': Study warns of danger from drugs bought on net\\", The Observer, June 21, 2009 In 2008, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain (RPSGB) introduced a green cross logo to help identify accredited online pharmacies (from 2010 the internet pharmacy logo scheme is run by the GPhC). European registered pharmacists have reciprocal agreements allowing them to practice in the U.K. by registering with the General Pharmaceutical Council. The first online pharmacy in the U.K. was Pharmacy2U, which started operating in 1999. The UK is a frontline leader in internet pharmacies since a change to NHS pharmacy regulations in 2005 that made it legal for pharmacies to fill NHS prescriptions over the Internet. Drugs supplied in this way tend to be medicines which doctors refuse to prescribe for patients or would charge a private prescription fee, as all patients treated under the National Health Service (NHS) pay either a flat price or nothing for prescribed medicine (except for medicine classed as lifestyle medicine, e.g., antimalarials for travel) and medical equipment. Since July 2015 the Medicines and Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has required online sellers of medicines to adopt an E.U. wide logo and maintain an entry in the MHRA medicines sellers registry. In the U.K., online pharmacies often link up with online clinic doctors. Doctors carry out online consultations and issue prescriptions. The company employing the doctors must be registered with the Care Quality Commission. Online clinics only prescribe a limited number of medicines and do not replace regular doctors working from surgeries. There are various ways the doctors carry out the online consultations; sometimes, it is done almost entirely by questionnaire. Customers usually pay one fee, which includes the price of the consultation, prescription, and the price of the medicine. As of April 2016, there were 46 registered online pharmacies in England. In April 2017, the Care Quality Commission suspended the registration of Doctor Matt Ltd because of inadequate medical assessment of prescription requests. Six have been warned after inspections. Pharmacy2U claimed in June 2018 that online dispensing could save the NHS up to ¬£400 million a year, a claim disputed by other pharmacy organizations.

These include Tibetans, Sri Lankan Tamils, Indians who were affected by the 1972 expulsion of Ugandans of Indian origin, and Indic-origin religious minorities. As the birthplace of many religions, most prominently Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, and Jainism, India accepts followers of Indic-origin religions who are persecuted in their home states as refugees, most notably victims of the Partition of India and the 1971 Bangladesh genocide. Most legal refugees (not synonymous with illegal immigrants) are Indic-religion minorities who fled prosecution from other countries after the India gained its independence in 1947. Illegal immigrants to India are not included in this definition. Existing legal Indian citizens who come from pre-independence migration to India are also not included under this definition. Foreigners who enter or stay in India without a valid visa are officially designated as illegal immigrants; they can be arrested and deported since they pose a risk to the country. Since the country is not a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention, the United Nations principles of non-refoulement and impediment to expulsion do not apply in India. History Over several centuries, India has offered shelter to people fleeing from persecution in their homeland. Parsis, a Zoroastrian community, migrated to India due to persecution between the 12th and 16th centuries. According to Qissa-i Sanjan, a Zoroastrian legend, Zoroastrianism collapsed as a state-sponsored religion a few centuries after the conquest of the Sassanid Empire. Consequently, some Zoroastrians migrated to what is now the Indian state of Gujarat to maintain their religious tradition.\\"Desh Pardesh: The South Asian Presence in Britain\\", p. 252, by Roger Ballard The descendants of newer Zoroastrian immigrants, fleeing the persecution of non-Muslims by Iran's Qajar dynasty (1794‚Äì1925), are known as Iranis. When India gained its independence, Parsis and Iranis retained legal citizenship. Legal framework Citizenship Indian nationality law is governed by the Citizenship Act (Articles 5 to 11 of the Constitution of India), which was passed in 1955 included creating a National Register of Citizens (NRC). Further Citizenship (Amendment) Acts were passed in 1986, 1992, 2003, 2005, 2015 and 2019. The National Register of Citizens of India (NRC), maintained by the government of India, contains relevant information like names to identify citizens of Assam state. The government prepared the first register after the 1951 census but did not update it until an order by the Supreme Court of India in 2013. India's federal and state governments are at various stages to implement the NRC in all areas.Rohingyas, Bangladeshi refugees likely target of Khattar govt‚Äôs updated NRC, Hindustan Times, 16 September 2019.UP DGP Asks Top Cops to Start Identifying Illegal ‚ÄòBangladeshi and Foreigner‚Äô Immigrants, NewsClick, 1 October 2019. Legal refugees The current Indian nationality law largely follows the jus sanguinis (citizenship by descent) as opposed to the jus soli (citizenship by right of birth within the territory). Since India became an independent country, its government has recognised legal immigrants from only Tibet and Sri Lanka as refugees from the past, providing free education and identification documentation to the former. After Citizenship Amendment Bill 2019 was passed on 12 December 2019 in the Parliament of India, migrants that came as refugees from persecuted minority communities like Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, Jains, Parsis, and Christians from neighbouring Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan before 31/12/2014 would be eligible for Indian citizenship, except Muslims, who make up the majority of the three countries. It would also relax the requirements for residents to become eligible for citizenship from 11 years to 6 years. There has been concern raised at the lack of inclusion of several Non-Muslim countries around India in the Citizenship Bill, such as Sri Lanka, over whom Shiv Sena and several religious figures have raised concern over the citizenship status of Tamil-speaking Hindus who were allowed to legally settle in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu due to previous discrimination on the island, and Nepal and Bhutan, the latter of which is accused of discriminating against Hindus through a Buddhist-only society. Tibetans refugees from China are also excluded from the bill despite being an ongoing concern. Illegal migrants  Those without valid Indian citizenship or visas are classified as illegal immigrants. Indian law does not classify any illegal immigrant as a refugee. Since India is not a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention, the United Nations's principles of non-refoulement and impediment to expulsion do not apply in India. Illegal immigrants are subjected to The Foreigners Act (1946), which defines a foreigner as a person who is not a citizen of India. Where the nationality of a person is not evident, the onus of proving whether a person is a foreigner or not lie upon the person himself. Anyone who believes that a foreigner has entered India, or who is the owner or managers of the property where a foreigner resides illegally, must inform the nearest police station within 24 hours of the presence of such foreigner.The Foreigners Act, 1946, Indian Kanoon. The Foreigners Act allows the government to detain a foreigner until he is deported back to his own country. Illegal immigration is a national security issue in politics. It is believed to pose a security threat, especially in sensitive areas like Jammu and West Bengal. The Centre on Monday, an Indian security organisation, has claimed that \\"some Rohingyas sympathising with many militant group's ideologies may be active in Jammu, Delhi, Hyderabad, and Mewat and can be a potential threat to internal security.\\" Additionally, women and girls are illegally trafficked to India; a common purpose for illegal trafficking is prostitution.Trafficking in Bangladeshi Women and Girls, by Bimal Kanti Paul; Syed Abu Hasnath, Geographical Review, p.268-276, April 2000Third and fourth periodic reports of States parties, COMMITTEE ON THE ELIMINATION OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN, UNITED NATIONS In 2005, the Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunal) Act, passed in 1983, was struck down by the Supreme Court of India, which held that the act \\"has created the biggest hurdle and is the main impediment or barrier in the identification and deportation of illegal migrants.\\"Illegal Migrants (Determination by Tribunal) Act, 1983, Indian Kanoon. On 9 August 2012, the Supreme Court heard a public interest litigation petition for the deportation of illegal migrants. In the case, the government of India stated that it does not support any kind of illegal migration either into its territory or illegal immigration of its citizens. The government claims to be only committed to the lawful deportation of illegal Bangladeshi migrants. Religious refugees Afghanistan Currently, there are around 8,000 to 11,684 Afghan refugees in India, most of whom are Hindus and Sikhs. The Indian government has allowed the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in India to operate a programme for them.A band born out of hope 4 August 2011 In 2015, the Indian government granted citizenship to 4,300 Hindu and Sikh refugees. Most were from Afghanistan, and some were from Pakistan. Bangladesh Many people from East Bengal, mainly Hindus, migrated to West Bengal during the partition of India in 1947. The native population of West Bengal sometimes referred to these refugees as \\"Bangals\\". From 1947 to 1961, the percentage of the population of East Bengal that was Hindu decreased from 30% to 19%.Saikia, Jaideep, Terror Sans Frontiers: Islamic Militancy in North East India, Appendix 5, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, July 2003. On 1991, it was down to 10.5% The percentage further decreased from 2001, where the census recorded it to be 9.2%, to 2008, when it was estimated to be 8%. Chakmas are a Bangladeshi Buddhist community. Chakma immigrants from Bangladesh have settled in the southern part of Mizoram because they were displaced by the construction of the Kaptai Dam on the Karnaphuli River in 1962. Because there was no rehabilitation or compensation, they fled from Bangladesh to India. In 2001, the BBC reported that many Bangladeshi Hindu families had entered India to escape repression in Bangladesh because they were members of minority religious groups. Pakistan Partition of India Following the partition of India, massive population exchanges occurred between the two newly formed nations, spanning several months. Once the borders between India and Pakistan were established, a total of about 14.5 million people migrated from one country to the other, seeking safety from being an adherent to the religion of the majority in their new country. Based on the 1951 census, immediately after the partition 7.226 million Muslims migrated from India to Pakistan, while 7.249 million Hindus and Sikhs moved from Pakistan to India. About 11.2 million migrants crossed the western border, making up 78% of the total migrant population. Most of them travelled through Punjab. 5.3 million Muslims moved from India to West Punjab in Pakistan, and 3.4 million Hindus and Sikhs moved from Pakistan to East Punjab in India. Elsewhere in the west, 1.2 million moved in each direction to and from Sind. The initial population transfer on the east involved 3.5 million Hindus moving from East Bengal to India and only 0.7 million Muslims moving the other way. Recent arrivals Non-Muslims face constitutional and legal discrimination in Pakistan. Consequently, Hindus and Sikhs from Pakistan have sought asylum in India; many have arrived in the 21st century. There are almost 400 Pakistani Hindu refugees in Indian cities. Tibet Tibetan woman in an Indian refugee camp Many religious refugees come from Tibet. The 14th Dalai Lama, a leader of the Tibetan migration movement, left Tibet for India after the 1959 Tibetan uprising. He was followed by about 80,000 Tibetan refugees. Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru agreed to allow Tibetan refugees to settle in India until their eventual return to Tibet. The Tibetan diaspora maintains the Central Tibetan Administration, a government-in-exile, in McLeod Ganj, a suburb of Dharamshala, Kangra district, Himachal Pradesh. The organisation coordinates political activities for Tibetans in India. In 1960, the government of Mysore State (now Karnataka) allotted nearly of land at Bylakuppe in Mysore district. In 1961, Lugsung Samdupling, the first Tibetan exile settlement in India, was formed. A few years later, another settlement, Tibetan Dickey Larsoe (TDL), was established. Three more settlements were built in Karnataka: Rabgayling in Gurupura village near Hunsur, Dhondenling at Oderapalya near Kollegal, and Doeguling at Mundgod in Uttara Kannada. With the settlements, the state acquired the largest Tibetan refugee population out of every Indian state. , Karnataka has 12 schools run by and for the Tibetan community. Other states have provided land for Tibetans. Bir Tibetan Colony is a settlement in Bir, Himachal Pradesh. Jeerango in Gajapati district, Odisha, has a large Tibetan community and South Asia's largest Buddhist monastery. The government of India has built special schools for Tibetans, providing free education, healthcare, and scholarships for students who excel in school. A few medical and civil engineering seats at universities are reserved for Tibetans. A document called the Registration Certificate (RC) is a permit for Tibetans to stay in India, renewed every year or half-year depending on the area. Every Tibetan refugee above the age of 16 must register for it, and RCs are not issued to refugees who have newly arrived. Another official document, the Indian Identity Certificate, nicknamed \\"Yellow Books\\", allows Tibetans to travel abroad. It is issued one year after an RC is given. Citizenship Amendment Act 2019 The Citizenship Amendment Act of 2019 (passed on the 11 December 2019) gives a path to Indian citizenship for Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi, and Christian religious minorities from Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan that have suffered religious persecution (provided they arrived in India before December 31st 2014). https://pib.gov.in/newsite/PrintRelease.aspx?relid=195783 Any refugees from these groups that arrived after the cutoff must reside in India for at least 5 years before they can gain citizenship. The Citizenship Amendment Act 2019 went into force on January 10th 2020, though the exact rules have not yet been set as of January 11th 2020. https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/citizenship-amendment-act-comes-into- effect-january-10-home-ministry-1635833-2020-01-10 Refugees facing ethnic persecution  Ugandans of Indian-origin expelled in 1972 Expelled Asians in the Netherlands after leaving Uganda, 1972 In 1972, the majority ethnic population expelled Asians from Uganda, including those of Indian origin. Many Indians had settled in Uganda, fleeing from the 1947 riots in Pakistan and the 1971 Bangladesh genocide. The practitioners of Indic religions (Buddhists, Hindus, Jains and Sikhs) who are persecuted in other countries are generally accepted as refugees in India. In early August 1972, the president of Uganda, Idi Amin, ordered nearly 80,000 Indians in Uganda, mostly Gujaratis, to leave the country within 90 days.) The expelled included 23,000 Indians who were Ugandan citizens. Although Ugandan of Indian origin were later exempted from the explusion, many chose to leave voluntarily. At the time, anti-Indian sentiment in Uganda was prominent. 4,500 refugees from Uganda ended up in India. A total of 5,655 firms, ranches, farms, and agricultural estates were reallocated; cars, homes, and other household goods were also seized. Sri Lankan Tamils More than 100,000 Sri Lankan Tamils live in India, most of whom migrated during the rise of militancy in Sri Lanka, in particular during the Sri Lankan Civil War, which lasted from 1983 to 2009. Most Sri Lankans are settled in the southern states of Tamil Nadu (in the cities of Chennai, Madurai, Tiruchirappalli, and Coimbatore), Karnataka (in Bangalore), and Kerala.

It was developed in the Soviet Union in 1969 and further studied in both Russia and Japan as a prodrug of GABA. In Russia, picamilon is sold as a prescription drug. The rights to the drug belong to the Russian pharmaceutical company NPK ECHO (\\"–ù–ü–ö –≠–•–û\\"). It is not approved for sale in the United States and has been deemed an adulterating agent in dietary supplements, with five American companies required to remove their picamilon products from the market in November, 2015.. However, as recently as 2020, picamilon has been found in pharmaceutical dosages in over-the-counter supplements in the US. Mechanism of action and potential therapeutic applications One study in animals showed that picamilon permeated the blood‚Äìbrain barrier and then is hydrolyzed into GABA and niacin. The released GABA in theory would activate GABA receptors potentially producing an anxiolytic response. The second released component, niacin, is a vasodilator.  Detection in biological fluids  Plasma picamilon concentrations are generally in the 500‚Äì3000 Œºg/L range during the first few hours after single oral doses of 50‚Äì200 mg with a half-life of 1‚Äì2 hours. The drug undergoes hydrolysis to GABA and nicotinic acid. Urinary excretion of parent drug and the two metabolites accounts for up to 79% of a single dose. Picamilon 20 mg from Russia  Regulation  In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration ruled in 2015 that picamilon does not fit any of the dietary ingredient categories in the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, namely that it is not a vitamin; a dietary mineral; an herb or other botanical; an amino acid; a dietary substance for use by humans to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any ingredient described above that had been marketed in the United States before 1994.

The official title of the band was 'The Royal Air Force Dance Orchestra', but it was always known by the more popular title \\"The Squadronaires\\". History In 1939 the Royal Air Force implemented a plan to raise morale and entertain the troops during wartime, and The Squadronaires was one of the bands organized as a result. The band drew from some of the best musicians of the day. It became a popular jazz band and likely the best known of the British military dance bands of the time, with hits like \\"There's Something in the Air\\" and \\"South Rampart Street Parade.\\" The Squadronaires played at dances and concerts for service personnel and also broadcast on the BBC and recorded on the Decca label. The orchestra's first broadcast took place in January 1941. After D-Day, the Squadronaires went on to entertain service personnel engaged in the Northwest European campaign but had to return to Britain because of military operations. After demobilization, the members formed a civilian band of the same name. Ronnie Aldrich had been the arranger and co-piano player, but in 1951 he took over as bandleader, and the band was then billed as Ronnie Aldrich and The Squadronaires. The touring season of 1951 was the busiest period of activity the band had ever experienced. In 1952, The Squadronaires began a regular summer engagement at The Palace Ballroom in Douglas, Isle of Man which continued until 1963. They played in the Ballroom every night except Sundays when they played concerts in the Palace Theatre. A cut-down version of the band (The Squadronetes), compared by vocalist Peter Morton, appeared every afternoon in the Palace Gardens (1960-1962). The Squadronaires continued to work together under Ronnie Aldrich until 1964. Members Many of the members formerly played as side men in Bert Ambrose‚Äôs band. During the war the members were: *Leader: Jimmy Miller *Manager: Arthur Maden *Trumpet: Tommy McQuater, Archie Craig, Clinton French *Trombone: George Chisholm, Eric Breeze *Saxophones: Tommy Bradbury, Harry Lewis, Jimmy Durrant, Andy McDevitt, Cliff Townshend, Maurice Stokes *Piano: Ronnie Aldrich *Guitar: Sid Colin *Bass: Arthur Maden *Drums: Jock Cummings *Vocals: Jimmy Miller, Joan Regan, Billy Nicholls SNR, Suzy Miller, Jackie Lee, Joan Baxter, Peter Morton, Ken Kirkham, Beryl Davis. After the war, Jimmy Watson replaced Clinton \\"Froggy\\" French on trumpet, and Monty Levy replaced Harry Lewis on alto sax. Band revival In 1985 a new big band orchestra was organized under the title \\"The Royal Air Force Squadronaires.\\" Many original members of the band were contacted and several were present at the official launch of the new band at Headquarters Music Services, RAF Uxbridge, on 8 January 1987. Original band leader Jimmy Miller conducted the band‚Äôs theme tune, \\"There‚Äôs Something in the Air.\\" Since then the band has recorded Big Band Spectacular and a second album Swing Squadron. To celebrate the 75th anniversary of the formation of the Royal Air Force, the Squadronaires produced an album entitled Squads Away in 1993, and in January 2002, they recorded Flying Home. Recordings from the original band are also available as reissues. Under band leader Sgt. Jamie Deighton the band has played in Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in London and for the Prince of Wales at Highgrove House supporting Pop Idol winner Will Young. They performed at the 2004 Royal British Legion Festival of Remembrance, also backing Will Young. In August 2004 the band performed at the Edinburgh International Jazz and Blues Festival, and appeared on television as part of the Edinburgh Military Tattoo. The band performs the majority of its concerts for charity, and in 2004 completed an eight-date tour of the South East to raise money for The Royal Air Forces Association. The Civilian Squadronaires In the light of the decision of Ronnie Aldrich to disband the orchestra in 1964, nothing much happened with the Squadronaires Orchestra. At some later time, bandleader Harry Bence approached Ronnie, asking if he could re-form the orchestra. Harry subsequently reformed the 'New' Squadronaires, and ran the band as a commercial unit until his death in 1997. Following Harry Bence's death, the future of the civilian band was in some doubt. Musical arranger and trumpet player Greg Francis then approached Mrs Mary Aldrich (Ronnie's widow) asking if he could obtain her permission to re-form the 'New Squadronaires' as a tribute to the original wartime Dance Band. Greg wanted to present the band 'as it was then' - with young players, dressed in RAF uniform, but most importantly, playing the music of the era. Mary Aldrich was delighted to offer her kind support in this. And so, the civilian 'New Squadronaires Orchestra' was re-formed in September 1997. It played its inaugural concert on the Isle of Man where the original band had performed for 11 years during the 1950s and 1960s. As the original venues, the Palace Ballrrom and Theatre had long since been redeveloped, the band played the concert at the Villa Marina. The New Squadronaires Orchestra has since played at thousands of military and non military events, including many of the RAF stations in the UK. It has played at the RAF Museum in Hendon, at Duxford and other airshows, and at the Imperial War Museum in London. Not only this but, the New Squadronaires has played its part in RAF recruitment. In 2002, the orchestra played (in the pouring rain - as they might have during the war) alongside the RAF recruitment exhibition in Blackpool - the very town where the Squadronaires played their first date in 1940. The orchestra was resident at the Blackpool Tower ballroom for two years, 2001 and 2002, and has remained popular with the many big band enthusiasts and holidaymakers. In 1997, along with the relaunch of the orchestra, a new CD was issued, featuring transcriptions of some of the original Squadronaires music. The parts were actually thrown on a bonfire by ex-leader Ronnie Aldrich in 1964, and so, it was necessary for Greg Francis, who is owner of the registered trade mark name (The New Squadronaires Orchestra) to transcribe many of the original titles from the existing recordings. The CD features amongst other top professional musicians, ex Syd Lawrence saxophonists Norman Brown and Andy Taylor, and also features Greg Francis himself, playing the trumpet features.

He made over 300 appearances in the Football League and represented England at youth level. Career Barnes, who was born in Kingston upon Thames, London, was a quick, skillful winger who began his career as an apprentice with West Ham United, the team that he supported as a boy, winning an FA Youth Cup winners medal in 1981 and England youth international caps. He turned professional in September 1980, and scored on his League debut against Watford in September 1980. He had an extended run in the first-team in the 1983‚Äì84 season and featured in the 1984‚Äì85 season, making 43 league appearances in six seasons, scoring five goals. He went to Scunthorpe United on loan in November 1985, playing in six league games without scoring, before joining Aldershot in March 1986 for a fee of ¬£15,000. He was an immediate success, scoring 26 goals in 49 league games and helping Aldershot to promotion through the first ever Third Division play- offs in 1987. In October 1987, he moved to Second Division side Swindon Town for a fee of ¬£50,000 in a deal that also saw Steve Berry go in the other direction. He scored in six successive league games between October and December 1988, and went on to make over 40 league appearances, scoring 13 times, in two seasons at Swindon. He joined Bournemouth for a fee of ¬£110,000 in March 1989, though he failed to settle and after only 14 games in which he failed to score, was sold to Northampton Town for ¬£70,000. Barnes managed to star despite Northampton being relegated, and with Tony Adcock formed a successful striking partnership, Barnes scoring 37 times in 98 league games for the Cobblers. In February 1992, a financial crisis came to a head at Northampton, and with the club in administration, both Barnes and Adcock were sold to Peterborough United, Barnes costing only ¬£35,000 in a joint ¬£65,000 deal. He played 49 times in the league for Peterborough, scoring nine goals and winning promotion to the First Division beating Stockport in a Wembley play-off in 1992. He joined Partick Thistle in February 1994, making his debut in the Scottish League in a 5‚Äì1 defeat by Rangers at Ibrox, but played only 6 further league games for the Jags before leaving to play for Uhisport Rangers in Hong Kong, returning to the UK in September 1995 joining Torquay United on a free transfer. He played only once for Torquay, as a substitute, before leaving on a free transfer for Hendon in October 1995 and subsequently returning to Hong Kong to play for Frankwell FC. After retirement After retiring in 1996, he joined the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), where he dealt with player's new contracts and giving financial advice. In 2006, he was assistant chief executive of the PFA. Personal life His nephew Giles Barnes is also a professional footballer, with MLS side Houston Dynamo.

Its successor, the Finepix S5 Pro, was released on 25 September 2006. It is based on a Nikon F80 (N80 in the U.S.) viewfinder, shutter, mirror-box and autofocus modules surrounded by a Fujifilm body that includes its own proprietary CCD image sensor and electronics, and a vertical grip shutter release. It has a Nikon F lens mount and can use most lenses made for 35 mm Nikon SLR cameras, but only with manual operation with Nikon AIS lenses, unusually for a digital SLR the S3 Pro can be used with a manual cable release. It is autofocusing and has an electronically controlled focal plane shutter with speeds from 30 sec. to 1/4000 sec. with x-flash synchronization at shutter speeds up to 1/180 sec. It has built-in exposure metering with spot, center weighted and evaluative modes and also features a pop-up flash. Its ISO film speed equivalents range from 100 through 125, 160, 200, 400, 800 and 1600. The camera is discontinued and no longer in production. The camera's principal distinction is its 23mm x 15.5mm photo sensor. Designated the Super CCD SR, it is unique in two ways. First, like its predecessors used in the earlier FinePix S1 Pro and FinePix S2 Pro, it has its photodiodes oriented diagonally rather than horizontally and vertically as in all other DSLR cameras. This allows the use of a sophisticated interpolation system that produces an output image equivalent to 12.1 megapixels. The apparent resolution of images in this interpolated mode lay somewhere between 6.17 megapixels and the 12.34 megapixel interpolated output. Second, it uses two photodiodes in each photo site when capturing an image at full resolution, with a primary sensor providing the normal sensitivity of a CCD sensor and another which is smaller and less sensitive. The purpose of this scheme is to provide greater resistance to the gross overexposure of highlights which is more common among digital cameras than film cameras. When used in 6 megapixel mode, the secondary, highlight sensor is disabled and only the larger sensor captures an image. The S3 can produce images in JPEG format with the option of three rendering tonalities. Two of these ('F1' and 'F2') are generally regarded to emulate the look of Fujifilm colour films. The third ('Standard') gives a more neutral image and may also be set for B&W; (monochrome) capture. Like the S5 which superseded it, the S3 gained popularity amongst numerous, professional Wedding Photographers for its ability to more accurately render skin tones and for its wide dynamic range, compared to comparable digital cameras of its time. The S3 can utilise two types of memory card storage: CF and XD cards. The camera can be remotely tethered to a computer via a Firewire connection. A monochrome-only, Live View capability is available for image composition via the rear LCD screen of the camera. This can be viewed for a maximum duration of thirty seconds, at which time mirror lock up is automatically cancelled and default function resumes.  Ultraviolet/infrared version  On August 9, 2006, Fujifilm announced a variation of the S3 Pro capable of photographing in the ultraviolet and (principally) infrared spectra, the Fujifilm FinePix S3 Pro UVIR.

The Gero Cross or Gero Crucifix (), of around 965‚Äì970, is the oldest large sculpture of the crucified Christ north of the Alps, and has always been displayed in Cologne Cathedral in Germany. It was commissioned by Gero, Archbishop of Cologne, who died in 976, thus providing a terminus ante quem for the work. It is carved in oak, and painted and partially gilded ‚Äì both have been renewed. The halo and cross-pieces are original, but the Baroque surround was added in 1683. The figure is high, and the span of its arms is .Schiller, pp. 140‚Äì142  Particular significance to medieval art  The Gero Cross is important to medieval art for the unique way it depicts Christ. The figure appears to be the earliest, and finest, of a number of life-size German wood sculpted crucifixions that appeared in the late Ottonian or early Romanesque period, later spreading to much of Europe. It is the first monumental depiction of the crucified Christ on the Cross and the first monumental sculpture dating from this period. Standing over six feet tall, it was one of the largest crosses of its time. Additionally, it appears to be the oldest Western depiction of a dead Christ on the cross;Lauer in most earlier depictions, Christ holds his head erect and looks straight ahead, or in some Carolingian examples looks down at the Virgin at the foot of the cross.Schiller, p. 142 lists examples The shape of the Gero Cross is traditional to Carolingian religious art. However, this piece puts extra emphasis on the suffering of Jesus Christ's crucifixion, with the slumped head, lifeless body, and closed eyes. Other depictions are idealized and do not show Christ as vulnerable and disfigured. This was a major influence on later crosses, especially in 11th-century Germany, where you see more crosses that follow this rounded, natural style. The slumped head and twisted body, which arises as the hands are nailed to the cross at different heights, are found neither in Carolingian nor Byzantine art, and were to be slow to influence Western depictions, although the long hair spread over the shoulders is found in some Carolingian works. The style of the Gero Cross shows a great deal of Byzantine influence, most likely stemming from Otto II's marriage to a Byzantine princess, creating a cultural link between the Catholic Church and the Byzantine Empire. In crucifixions of the Gothic period, a still more slumped and curved figure of Christ, with knees bent sideways, was to become the standard depiction. Earlier large figures of Christ on the Cross appear to have been in metal, or metal on a wooden core; there was said to be one in Charlemagne's Palatine Chapel in Aachen, and the Golden Madonna of Essen is an example of this type.Schiller, p. 140 The development of a tradition of free- standing monumental sculpture was a crucial development in Western art; in Byzantine art such images were and are avoided. detail of Christ History The cross has always been in Cologne Cathedral; it now hangs in its own chapel near the sacristy ‚Äì now a different, Gothic, building from the one it was made for. The Chronicon of Thietmar of Merseburg, written 1012‚Äì1018, said that it was originally displayed above Gero's grave; though no one is now sure where that was located in the old church, most scholars place it somewhere on the central axis of the nave,Kaspersen & Thun√∏, pp. 46‚Äì47 in which case it may have been at the chancel arch, the usual location of later roods or large crucifixes. It has long been celebrated and visited by pilgrims. The old cathedral only underwent minor changes until the 13th century. Cologne became one of the most important churches in Europe for religious pilgrimages, containing not only the Gero Cross, but also the Magi reliquary and the Madonna of Milan. When it was decided to rebuild it, the old building was taken down piece by piece before the new building could be put up in 1248. In 1322, the Gero cross was placed in the new building where it remains today. In 1904, a new layer of paint was added to the cross by W. Batzem. This, along with several other layers of paint below it, concealed many of the original details from the piece. However, modern day x-ray technology has determined that the eyes on the original layer of paint were indeed closed. This is unique because the artist did not depict Christ as idealized and overcoming death, but vulnerable and humanized. This is most likely because of a change in Christian teaching in the late tenth century that put salvation through Christ's death at the heart of Christian doctrine. The beam and the corpus are original; however, the gold sun and the marble altar it stands in were donated in 1683 by Canon Heinrich Mering. Until the 1920s, despite local tradition, and the reference in Thietmar's chronicleQuoted in Kaspersen & Thun√∏, pp. 45‚Äì46: the specific passage associating it with Gero, it was thought to be at least a century later in date, and it is indeed innovative for its date. The dating was confirmed by dendrochronology in 1976, ending the controversy. Contrary to long-held tradition, the studies in 1976 revealed that there is no space in the back of the head to place relics.Kaspersen & Thun√∏ 2006, p. 59, note 18: the specific passage According to the Luccan local histories, the Holy Face of Lucca in Italy is considerably older, though that sculpture had to be recreated in the Gothic period after being nibbled away by pilgrims, which makes this claim difficult to verify by art historians.Schiller, p. 144 A replica of the crucifix hangs in the St. Alphonsus Chapel located in the Alphonse J. Schwartze Memorial Catholic Center in Jefferson City, Missouri.

It also can be produced its acetyl derivative by heating 2-naphthol with ammonium acetate to 270-280 ¬∞C. Reactions It gives no color with iron(III) chloride. When reduced by sodium in boiling amyl alcohol solution, it forms tetrahydro-3-naphthylamine, which exhibits the properties of the aliphatic amines in that it is strongly alkaline in reaction, has an ammoniacal odor and cannot be diazotized. On oxidation, it yields ortho-carboxy-hydrocinnamic acid, HO2CC6H4CH2CH2CO2H. Numerous sulfonic acid derivatives of 2-naphthylamine are used in commerce, such as precursors to dyes. Owing to the carcinogenicity of the amine, these derivatives are mainly prepared by amination of the corresponding naphthols. Of them, the Œ¥-acid and Bronner's acid are of more value technically, since they combine with ortho-tetrazoditolyl to produce fine red dye-stuffs. 2-Naphthylamine was previously used as a dye precursor and rubber antioxidant in the 1930s, 40s and 50s. Dupont stopped using it in the 1970s.Castleman, Barry (1979), Dupont's Record In Business Ethics: Another View, Washington Post, July 15th 1979 Role in disease 2-Naphthylamine is found in cigarette smoke and suspected to contribute to the development of bladder cancer.CDC - NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards It is activated in the liver but quickly deactivated by conjugation to glucuronic acid.

His uniform number was 94. Prior to his officiating career, he played college football as a running back for Santa Clara University. Carey was a respected official in the NFL for his thorough pre-game preparation, professional demeanor, and fair play. In a poll conducted by ESPN in 2008, Carey tied with referee Ed Hochuli for most \\"best referee\\" votes among NFL head coaches. He had also ejected the most players in the league among current referees, as of 2002, including incidents involving Sean Taylor and Terrell Suggs. In his nineteenth year as referee with the 2013 NFL season, Carey's officiating crew consisted of umpire Chad Brown, head linesman Mark Baltz, line judge Tim Podraza, field judge Mike Weir, side judge Doug Rosenbaum and back judge Kirk Dornan.2013 NFL officiating crews Carey was designated as referee of Super Bowl XLII between the New England Patriots and New York Giants, becoming the first African American referee to receive the prestigious assignment. Carey officiated the same two teams when they played each other during the final week of the 2007 NFL season. At the time of his retirement, Carey was one of the two senior referees in the NFL, along with Walt Coleman. Carey was promoted in 1995 when the league added the Carolina Panthers and Jacksonville Jaguars and thus needed an extra officiating crew to handle up to 15 games per weekend instead of 14, which had been the case between 1976 and 1994. Personal Early years Carey attended and later graduated from Santa Clara University in 1971 with a bachelor's degree in biology. While at SCU, he played running back for four years until an ankle injury ended his playing career. The injury continues to impact Carey today as it limits his running ability. He only allows himself to run on days he is scheduled to officiate games. Family Carey currently resides in San Diego, California, along with his wife, Wendy. Wendy, also a graduate of SCU, is the chief financial officer of Seirus Innovation. The couple have two daughters, Drisana and Danica. Mike Carey's older brother, Don Carey, is also a retired NFL official. He worked as a back judge from the 2010 NFL season until 2013; before that, he was a field judge from to , a back judge from to and a referee in . Entrepreneur and inventor Mike and Wendy Carey founded Seirus Innovation, a privately held company that manufactures ski and snowboarding gloves, face protection, and other cold-weather accessories, in 1979. In September 2007, Mike Carey was named Chairman of the Board for SnowSports Industries America (SIA). As chair, his goal is to \\"get the suppliers, retailers, reps, media and resorts to come together as one community and work together, then we can create synergy to help strengthen the snow sports industry as a whole.\\" Carey is an inventor who owns or shares eight ski apparel patents, including \\"Cat Tracks,\\" a device which he created at age 30 to slip over the sole of a ski boot to provide increased traction when walking. Officiating career Early years Carey began officiating football in 1972 working Pop Warner football games in the San Diego, California, area after a suggestion by a friend. Progressing to the college level in 1985, he joined the Western Athletic Conference (WAC). In the WAC, he officiated three bowl games. National Football League Carey was hired by the NFL in 1990 as a side judge, before being promoted to referee for the start of the 1995 NFL season. He became the second African American referee in NFL history after Johnny Grier in 1988. In addition to being selected as referee in Super Bowl XLII, he served as an alternate for Super Bowl XXXVI. In addition to the Super Bowl, he has officiated two conference championship games, four divisional playoffs, and eight wild card games throughout his career as of the conclusion of the 2007-08 NFL playoffs. NFL referee Mike Carey December 16, 2006 In an interview in August 2014, it was revealed that Carey had requested that the NFL not assign him to games featuring the Washington Redskins. A search of game logs revealed Carey had not worked a preseason or regular season game involving the Redskins since the opening week of the 2006 season. Carey has worked memorable games throughout his career, most notably during the 2005 NFL season. On October 3, 2005, Mike and Don Carey became the first brothers to officiate an NFL game together when they were assigned on the same officiating crew for the game between the Carolina Panthers and Green Bay Packers. The following week of the 2005 regular season on October 9, 2005, Carey was involved in a game between the Baltimore Ravens and Detroit Lions, which featured a pair of ejections and 21 penalties for the Ravens. In the third quarter with Detroit possession from Baltimore's 6 yard line, Terrell Suggs was penalized for roughing Detroit quarterback Joey Harrington following an incomplete pass. Suggs then quickly approached Mike Carey to argue the call and was immediately ejected from the game. After the game, Carey spoke to reporters and said, \\"He bumped me with malice in his heart and he was gone. He said a number of things to me.\\" Two months later at the start of overtime during a game between the Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers in December 2005, Carey was unable to locate a coin to use for the coin toss. He had given his coin to a child, who served as the Packers' honorary captain, at the game's opening kickoff. The field judge was able to supply Carey with a penny. Carey was the referee during a 2005-06 playoff game between the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Washington Redskins. At the conclusion of a play during this game, Redskins safety Sean Taylor spat in the face of Buccaneers running back Michael Pittman. Pittman retaliated with a slap to Taylor's helmet. Carey could be heard through a live microphone immediately ejecting Taylor from the game. Head linesman Steve Stelljes conferred with Carey over Pittman's actions, but Carey decided not to penalize Pittman for his retaliation. When questioned about taking no action against Pittman by Redskins players, Carey said in response to being spat upon, \\"What would you do?\\" Mike Pereira, the vice president of officiating, approved of Carey's handling of the incident saying that \\"offsetting personal fouls would not have been appropriate\\". Pereira added, \\"If anybody didn't eject somebody for spitting in somebody's face, I'd be disappointed.\\"  Super Bowl XLII  Nearly two years later, Carey was named referee of Super Bowl XLII. On working the NFL's championship game, Carey said it was a \\"personal honor\\" and understood the historical significance of being the first African American referee. On the significance of the event, he said it was a \\"great sign of the evolution of our society that all barriers are eroding\\". During the fourth quarter, Carey's judgment was a factor in one of the important plays of the game. On third down, with just over a minute left in regulation, New York Giants quarterback Eli Manning received the snap in a shotgun formation and looked to pass the ball. New England Patriots defenders Richard Seymour, Jarvis Green, and Adalius Thomas grabbed and attempted to tackle Manning. Manning escaped the two defenders and threw a 32-yard pass to wide receiver David Tyree. Under NFL rules, officials are required to stop play when a player is \\"in the grasp and control\\" of the defense. Carey determined that \\"grasp and control\\" was never achieved since Manning's forward momentum did not stop. Speaking about the play, Carey said, \\"I anticipated a sack. I didn't assume that was going to happen, but rarely do you see a quarterback escape when he's got that much weight on his back and being dragged by two or three guys who had a hold of him. I could see [Manning's] head was just straight ahead. He was trying to break free with desperation. Then all of a sudden he spun out and then he started to come right back at me.\\" Other work On June 24, 2014, Carey resigned from the NFL and joined CBS Sports as an analyst for its Thursday night and Sunday broadcasts. He provided rules analysis, interpretation and rules explanations from the game site, as well as the NFL Network's studios in Culver City, California, on Thursdays and from The NFL Today set in New York on Sunday.CBS Sports adds former NFL official Mike Carey to broadcast team Carey's contract was not renewed after the 2015 season, after several on-air mistakes regarding calls.

The rapid plate motion of the Izanagi Plate caused north-west Japan and the outer zone of south-west Japan to drift northward. High-pressure metamorphic rocks were formed at the eastern margin of the drifting land mass in the Sanbagawa metamorphic belt, while low-pressure metamorphic rocks were formed at its western margin in the Abukuma metamorphic belt. At approximately 95 Ma, the Izanagi Plate was completely subducted and replaced by the western Pacific Plate, which also subducted in the north-western direction. Subduction-related magmatism took place near the Ryoke belt. No marked tectonics occurred in the Abunkuma belt after the change of the subducted plate. The discovery of an extinct Jurassic‚ÄìCretaceous spreading system in the north-west Pacific led to the introduction of the extinct Kula Plate in 1972.

The concerts included performances by Count Basie, Benny Goodman, Big Joe Turner and Pete Johnson, Helen Humes, Meade Lux Lewis, Albert Ammons, Mitchell's Christian Singers, the Golden Gate Quartet, James P. Johnson, Big Bill Broonzy and Sonny Terry. Concert The idea was a history, starting with spirituals and leading up to big swing bands, involving African American performers. Hammond had difficulty gaining sponsorship for the event because it involved African American artists and an integrated audience. However, The New Masses, the journal of the American Communist Party, agreed to finance it. According to the liner notes of the boxed set, \\"[i]n 1938... conceived a concert at Carnegie Hall in New York City to showcase African-American music from its raw beginnings to the most current jazz. Hammond... was one of the most influential talent scouts and record producers in history, having 'discovered' artists from Billie Holiday and Count Basie to [much later - Varlet] Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen. The concert, which would be titled 'From Spirituals To Swing', would depict the common themes that existed in Black music from its origins in Africa, through gospel and blues, dixieland and eventually to swing.\\" \\"On December 23, 1938, 'From Spirituals To Swing' was presented to a sold-out house... Its success prompted another concert on Christmas Eve of 1939...\\" \\"The musical significance of the two 'From Spirituals To Swing' concerts is difficult to deny. Equally important, however, were the social and political implications. The racial impact cannot be overlooked as African- American artists were being presented to an integrated audience at Carnegie Hall at a time when such an occurrence was, if not unheard of, extremely rare. The strong ties between the jazz world and the political Left were also obvious in the two sponsors of the programs: The Marxist 'New Masses' and the Theater Arts Committee which was an openly Left-wing organization. John Hammond was an independent iconoclast. In his efforts to foster social justice and integration he found himself at times in step with civil rights groups and Communists (though Hammond himself was never a member of the Communist Party). The impact of the integration of musicians and jazz audiences in the 1930s and 1940s was very influential on the racial history of our country. 'From Spirituals To Swing' was not only a musical milestone in the history of jazz, it was also a socially significant even coming at a time when our nation, as well as the world, was entering a period of inconceivable upheaval and change.\\" The boogie-woogie craze of the late 1930s and early 1940s dates from these concerts. Johnson and Turner, along with Lewis and Ammons, continued as an act after the concerts with their appearances at the Cafe Society night club, as did many of the other performers. The stage moves and musical ecstasy of the gospel performers were new to the white audience, and presaged much that appeared later in rhythm and blues and rock and roll.

Battle of Singapore All organised Allied forces in Malaya had retreated to Singapore on 31 January 1942. The Brigade was deployed as part of the defence of the Southern Area of Singapore under the command of Maj Gen Frank Keith Simmons together with the 2nd Malaya Infantry Brigade, the Straits Settlements Volunteer Force Brigade and the 12th Indian Infantry Brigade. The Brigade put up a stubborn defence during the Battle of Pasir Panjang which included the famous last stand at Bukit Chandu led by a platoon of C Company of the Malay Regiment under the command of 2Lt Adnan bin Saidi. With the fall of the Pasir Panjang Ridge, the Brigade fell back to the defensive line established along Mount Echo in Tanglin to Buona Vista.

As a bacteriologist he discovered specific agglutination in 1896 with his English colleague Herbert Durham (Gruber-Widal-reaction). But his main interests were studying hygiene and sexual life. Max von Gruber was the son of Ignaz Gruber (1803‚Äì1872), a general practitioner and the first specialist in otology in Austria, and publisher of a two-volume textbook on medical chemistry (1835). His brother was Franz von Gruber. He graduated from the Schottengymnasium in Vienna and studied medicine at the University of Vienna, receiving his medical doctorate in 1876. He then learned chemistry and physiology under Max von Pettenkofer (1818‚Äì1901) and Karl von Voit (1831‚Äì1908) in Munich and Karl Ludwig (1816‚Äì1895) in Leipzig. Also working under Pettenkofer was Hans Ernst August Buchner (1850‚Äì1902), who encouraged Gruber to concentrate on bacteriology. Unlike some of the great names of the time, among them Carl Wilhelm N√§geli, Theodor Billroth (1829‚Äì1894), Ferdinand Cohn (1828‚Äì1898), and Robert Koch (1843‚Äì1910), Gruber recognized that bacteria possess a variability within limits partially determined by the culture medium. This theory was important for the differentiation of the categories of bacteria and gained significance for Gruber in his examinations of cholera vibrios, enabling him to distinguish them from other vibrios. In 1882 Gruber was habilitated as a lecturer in Vienna, and two years later he became associate professor and head of the newly established Institute for Hygiene at the University of Graz. On 23 March 1887 he became ausserordentlicher professor in Vienna, succeeding Josef Nowak, and on 10 December 1891 he was appointed to the chair of hygiene established in 1875 at the University of Vienna. Karl Landsteiner became his assistant in 1896. Another of his pupils, Alois Lode, in 1897 became the first professor in the new chair of hygiene at the University of Innsbruck. The working conditions in the Institute of Hygiene were so poor, that Gruber attempted to resign his chair and find employment as head of a laboratory in M√ºnchen or at the Jenner Institute in London, under Joseph Lister. It was while in Vienna, however, that Gruber, with his English student Herbert Edward Durham (1866‚Äì1945), discovered the agglutination which gained him international fame. Gruber eventually left Vienna in 1902, and in October that year he succeeded Hans Buchner as director of the Institute for Hygiene in M√ºnchen. He held the post until his voluntary retirement in 1923, on the occasion of his seventieth birthday. In Vienna he was succeeded by Arthur Schattenfroh (1869‚Äì1923), who held the chair from 1905 to 1923. During his last years, Gruber concentrated completely on his duties as president of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences. With Max Rubner and P. Martin Ficker (1868‚Äì) he published the Handbuch der Hygiene. 6 volumes; Leipzig, S. Hirtzel, 1911‚Äì1913. As a leading racial hygienist, when he first met the Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler he described him as:  Bibliography  * √úber die als ¬´Kommabacillen¬ª bezeichneten Vibrionen von Koch und Finkler-Prior.

A floodlight is a broad-beamed, high-intensity artificial light. They are often used to illuminate outdoor playing fields while an outdoor sports event is being held during low-light conditions. More focused kinds are often used as a stage lighting instrument in live performances such as concerts and plays. In the top tiers of many professional sports, it is a requirement for stadiums to have floodlights to allow games to be scheduled outside daylight hours. Evening or night matches may suit spectators who have work or other commitments earlier in the day, and enable television broadcasts during lucrative primetime hours. Some sports grounds which do not have permanent floodlights installed may make use of portable temporary ones instead. Many larger floodlights (see bottom picture) will have gantries for bulb changing and maintenance. These will usually be able to accommodate one or two maintenance workers. Floodlights at Adelaide airport.  Types  The most common type of floodlight is the metal-halide lamp, which emits a bright white light (typically 75‚Äì100 lumens/Watt). Sodium-vapor lamps are also commonly used for sporting events, as they have a very high lumen to watt ratio (typically 80‚Äì140 lumens/Watt), making them a cost-effective choice when certain lux levels must be provided. LED floodlights are bright enough to be used for illumination purposes on large sport fields. The main advantages of LEDs in this application are their lower power consumption, longer life, and instant start-up (the lack of a \\"warm-up\\" period reduces game delays after power outages). The first LED lit sports field in the United Kingdom was switched on at Taunton Vale Sports Club on 6 September 2014. Sports played under floodlights Polo The first sport to play under floodlights was polo, on 18 July 1878. Ranelagh Club hosted a match in Fulham, London, England against the Hurlingham Club. Australian rules football Australian rules football match under electric lights at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, 1879 In August 1879, two matches of Australian rules football were staged at the Melbourne Cricket Ground under electric lights. The first was between two \\"scratch\\" teams composed of military personnel. The following week, two of the city's leading football clubs, rivals Carlton and Melbourne, played another night match. On both occasions, the lights failed to illuminate the whole ground, and the spectators struggled to make sense of the action in the murky conditions. Cricket A floodlight at Trent Bridge cricket ground in Nottingham Cricket was first played under floodlights on 11 August 1952, during an exhibition game at Highbury stadium in England. International day/night cricket, played under floodlights, began in 1979. Since then, many cricket stadiums have installed floodlights and use them for both domestic and international matches. Traditional cricket floodlights are mounted at the top of a tall pole, to elevate them out of the fielder's eyeline when the ball is hit high into the air. However, some cricket stadiums have lower-mounted floodlights, particularly if the stadium is shared with other sports. Gaelic games Noel Walsh's advocacy was pivotal in the spread of floodlights in Gaelic games. When chairman of the Munster Council, Walsh had a pilot project for floodlights at Austin Stack Park in Tralee which \\"became a template for every county and club ground in the country\\". Association football A floodlight used on a football field Floodlights on a Rugby league field at the Headingley Stadium in Leeds, UK. This is a common style of floodlights at older football and rugby grounds in England and Scotland. (Note the two gantries near the light for servicing) Bramall Lane was reportedly the first stadium to host floodlit association football matches, dating as far back as 1878, when there were experimental matches at the Sheffield stadium during the dark winter afternoons. With no national grid, lights were powered by batteries and dynamoes, and were unreliable. Blackburn and Darwen also hosted floodlit matches in 1878. Nottingham Forest played a floodlit match against Notts Rangers at the Gregory Ground, Lenton, Nottingham on 25 March 1889. This match was illuminated by 14 Wells Lights which was a portable illumation system powered by paraffin Each light had 4,000 candlepower. These lights were placed around the ground and 'illuminated the playing arena well enough for the spectators to follow most, if not all, the points of play' according to the Nottingham Evening Post on 26 March 1889. However the same article also reported on 26 March 1889 that 'a strong wind was blowing from the Radford goal, and this caused the lights on the town side to shed a considerable portion of their radiance on the adjoining fields, so that dark shadows were often thrown upon the playing ground and it was almost impossible to see a case of handling unless the officials were close to'. The match was played at 7:45pm and Forest lost 2-0 watched by 5000 spectators. Thames Ironworks (who would later be re-formed as West Ham United) played a number of friendly matches under artificial light at their Hermit Road ground during their inaugural season of 1895‚Äì96. These experiments, which included high- profile fixtures against Arsenal and West Bromwich Albion, were set up using engineers and equipment from the Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company. In 1929 the Providence Clamdiggers football club hosted the Bethlehem Steel \\"under the rays of powerful flood lights, an innovation in soccer\\" at their Providence, Rhode Island stadium. On 10 May 1933, Sunderland A.F.C. played a friendly match in Paris against RC Paris under floodlights. The floodlights were fixed to overhead wires strung above and across the pitch. A fresh white coloured ball was introduced after about every 20 minutes and the goalposts were painted yellow. In the 1930s, Herbert Chapman installed lights into the new West Stand at Highbury but the Football League refused to sanction their use. This situation lasted until the 1950s, when the popularity of floodlit friendlies became such that the League relented. In September 1949, South Liverpool's Holly Park ground hosted the first game in England under \\"permanent\\" floodlights: a friendly against a Nigerian XI.Jawad, Hyder; \\"Rest In Pieces: South Liverpool FC, 1894-1994 (2014)\\", p234 In 1950, Southampton's stadium, The Dell, became the first ground in England to have permanent floodlighting installed. The first game played under the lights there was on 31 October 1950, in a friendly against Bournemouth & Boscombe Athletic, followed a year later by the first \\"official\\" match under floodlights, a Football Combination (reserve team) match against Tottenham Hotspur on 1 October 1951. Swindon Town became the first League side to install floodlights at The County Ground. Their first match being a friendly against Bristol City on Monday 2 April 1951. Arsenal followed five months later with the first match under the Highbury lights taking place on Wednesday 19 September 1951. The first international game under floodlights of an England game at Wembley was 30 November 1955 against Spain, England winning 4‚Äì1. The first floodlit Football League match took place at Fratton Park, Portsmouth on 22 February 1956 between Portsmouth and Newcastle United. Many clubs have taken their floodlights down and replaced them with new ones along the roof line of the stands. This previously had not been possible as many grounds comprised open terraces and roof lines on covered stands were too low. Elland Road, Old Trafford and Anfield were the first major grounds to do this in the early 1990s. Deepdale, The Galpharm Stadium and the JJB Stadium have since been built with traditional floodlights on pylons. Rugby league The first rugby league match to be played under floodlights was on 14 December 1932 when Wigan met Leeds in an exhibition match played at White City Stadium in London (8pm kick off). Leeds won 18‚Äì9 in front of a crowd of over 10,000 spectators. The venture was such a success that the owners of the White City Ground took over the \\"Wigan Highfield\\" club and moved them to play Rugby League games at the ground under floodlights the following season, with most of their matches kicking off on Wednesday Nights at 8pm. That venture only lasted one season before the club moved back up north. The first floodlit match for rugby league played in the heartlands was on 31 October 1951 at Odsal Stadium, Bradford when Bradford Northern played New Zealand in front of 29,072. For a club to play in the Super League they must have a ground with floodlights adequate for playing a professional game. Winter sports Schattberg, Austria Winter sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, can be held under a floodlit piste. Motorsports A number of permanent motor racing circuits are floodlit to allow night races to be held. These include Yas Marina Circuit, Losail International Circuit, and Bahrain International Circuit.

Marfield. It is based on Deepwater, a 1999 novel written by Matthew F. Jones. It was screened at the Seattle International Film Festival on June 9, 2005, and the M√ºnchen Fantasy Filmfest in Germany on June 28, 2005. The film was shot in Clearwater and Little Fort in British Columbia, Canada. Synopsis Nat Banyon (Lucas Black) is a hitch-hiker whose dream is to open an ostrich farm in Wyoming. Early in the trip, he gets in a fight at a truck-stop bar and in the ruckus, takes his opponent's car keys, stealing his sports car. Continuing the journey, he finds a stranger (Peter Coyote) trapped in an overturned vehicle. He rescues him just as the car is completely destroyed by an incoming truck. Grateful for saving his life, the stranger, Herman Finch, hires Nat as the handyman for his motel. Nat soon learns that Finch runs a criminal network, acting in collusion with the police. Most of the locals are also in league with Finch. And everyone who irritates or opposes him soon turns up missing. They are then found dead. Finch's young, attractive wife Iris (M√≠a Maestro) soon hatches a plan to run off with Nat, planning to steal Finch's ill-gotten gains. Soon, Finch begins manipulating Nat when the latter begins questioning him about all the mysterious activities that had been taking place. Finch challenges Nat to a boxing match. If Nat wins, he will be free to leave and take his car as well as the salary that he had made as Finch's handyman. Nat shows up to the fight after training himself to tip-top shape. When he steps into the ring, Finch suddenly reveals that the fight was a joke. Finch says he doesn't want Nat to leave; Nat had been too good of a worker. Enraged, Nat attacks Finch, and then rushes to the motel. There, he grabs Iris and tells her that they have to leave. Despite her resistance, Nat is too deeply in love with Iris to escape alone. He kidnaps her and speeds away. Unsure of where to go in the night, Nat follows Iris' directions. However, Iris deceives Nat to drive to the barn where he had seen Finch for the fight. In a final fit of frustration, Nat drives off into the water. After pulling the unconscious Iris out of the submerged car and onto shore, Nat is attacked by Finch, and they have a final showdown. Nat loses the fight, and the police arrive to arrest him. During his flight with Iris it is revealed that Nat is mentally ill, suffering from delusions and hallucinations and possibly multiple personality disorder. This leaves the viewer unsure of how much of the story has been real, and how much has been Nat's imagination. Part of Nat's pathology is an unhealthy attachment to Finch. Although he clearly hates him, he also sees him as a father figure, and his conflicted feelings about his father become entangled with his feeling towards Finch. We come to realize that it is Nat who killed Finch's supposed enemies, to protect his father figure. The film also slowly alludes to the fact that Iris' love for Nat had been Nat's own delusion. Nat is sent to a mental hospital where he falls deeper into mental illness, whimpering about the baby ostriches that he would now never have the chance to raise.

Towards the end of the season, L√≥pez was promoted to Double-A with the Birmingham Barons in the Southern League. He played the remaining 7 games of the season there and went 5‚Äì23 in his first taste of Double-A ball. For the season, L√≥pez started again with the Barons and struggled a bit with his hitting, only batting a .238. Regardless of his performance, scouts saw his potential as he was only 21 years of age and playing in Double-A ball. He was promoted to the Charlotte Knights in the International League. He batted .202, getting 38 hits in 188 at bats. Soon after, L√≥pez was promoted to the big leagues. L√≥pez made his major league debut on May 1, 2005, and played in two games for the Chicago White Sox. He went 2‚Äì7 in with a run scored and 2 RBI. L√≥pez began the season with the Charlotte Knights, the White Sox Triple-A affiliate, but was later released by the team. Cincinnati Reds On May 21, 2007, he was picked up off waivers by the Cincinnati Reds. He was sent to the Red's Triple-A affiliate, the Louisville Bats. On July 8, 2007, he was called up to the Reds and made his Reds debut on July 14, going 0‚Äì3 against the New York Mets. Post-majors On October 26, , the Toronto Blue Jays claimed him off waivers. He became a free agent at the end of the season. Lopez signed a minor league contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates on January 6, 2009. He signed a minor league contract with the Washington Nationals on January 13, . Lopez played the 2012 season with the Bridgeport Bluefish of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball.

It is a parody of the Academy Award winning song \\"Lose Yourself\\" by Eminem. In it, the narrator details his obsession with watching television and the television shows he watches. Release \\"Couch Potato\\" was originally going to be the lead single of Poodle Hat, but due to Eminem's concern that it might hurt his career, its commercial release was cancelled. \\"Couch Potato\\" has never been released as a promo, nor a commercial single. It is only available on the Poodle Hat CD, or as a digital download on the internet. Canceled Music video Yankovic intended to make a music video for the song, but the plan was scrapped at the last minute when Eminem denied him permission make a video, expressing concerns that it might disparage his image. According to Yankovic, the video would have included a \\"patchwork quilt\\" pastiche of scenes from other Eminem videos. Yankovic told the Chicago Sun-Times in 2004, \\"Last year, Eminem forced me to halt production on the video for my 'Lose Yourself' parody because he somehow thought that it would be harmful to his image or career.\\" Yankovic mocked the situation on his Al TV special where he staged a mock interview with the rapper using footage from a real Eminem interview on MTV News. Eminem said \\"I believe in...artistic expression.\\" Al countered with \\"So you think, for example if somebody wanted to do, oh, I don't know, a parody of somebody else's video, they should be able to...artistically express themselves and just do it?\\" Eminem was shown at a loss for words. Also in the mock interview, Al simply played the first verse on a boombox while sitting in a chair, reading a newspaper until Eminem eventually turned it off. Eminem references the interview in his book The Way I Am, saying that \\"Weird Al\\" took some jabs at him. He said he thinks Yankovic is funny, and thought the \\"interview\\" was funny.

Background and early career The son of Robert Hoyer Millar, he was educated at Wellington and New College, Oxford. Millar entered the Diplomatic Service in 1923, and served in various capacities at the British embassies in Berlin, Paris and Cairo and at the Foreign Office. From 1934 to 1938 he was Assistant Private Secretary to the Foreign Secretary (Sir John Simon, Sir Samuel Hoare and Anthony Eden respectively). Senior diplomatic appointments During the Second World War he served chiefly at the British embassy in Washington, where he was also Minister Plenipotentiary from 1948 to 1950. Millar was also the United Kingdom Deputy at the North Atlantic Council from 1950 to 1952 and its Representative thereon from 1952 to 1953. The latter year Millar was appointed High Commissioner to the British Zone of occupied Germany, a post he held until 1955, and was then Ambassador to West Germany from 1955 to 1956. After his return to Britain he served as Permanent Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office from 1957 to 1962. Later life; personal Millar was made a KCMG in 1949 and a GCMG in 1956, and in 1962 he was raised to the peerage as Baron Inchyra, of St Madoes in the County of Perth.

Style Kruzhka restaurants can usually be identified outside by their orange –ö–†–£–ñ–ö–ê signs, which are often illuminated and difficult to miss. The orange theme continues inside, where the brick walls and wooden furniture give most Kruzhka restaurants a somewhat rugged character. It is common in Moscow and other Russian cities for there to be relatively little difference between bars, restaurants, clubs, and cafes, and Kruzhka is no exception. These \\"beer restaurants\\" tend to be popular with students, though the cheap food and beer attracts expatriates as well as Russians. However, that does not necessarily mean that Kruzhka has a \\"Western\\" character. Sports events, such as Russian football internationals, are regularly shown in many Kruzhka, either on televisions or big screens (alternatively French music channels are, for some reason, also put on quite a lot). Advertising In late 2005 a television advert was created to highlight the advantages of going to Kruzhka for Russian football fans. The ad shows a Russian man excitedly returning home to watch an important match (clips show Russia's 1 - 0 victory over Wales at the Millennium Stadium which meant Russia qualified for Euro 2004). However, he finds both of the televisions in his flat are already in use; his wife is tearfully watching a soap opera, while his daughter is jumping around watching a t.A.T.u. concert. The punchline of the ad is that he can watch the match at Kruzhka. Menu The majority of items available at Kruzhka are relatively cheap (only the pricey Courvoisier Cognac is over 300 roubles). This is one of the major appeals of the chain. Several main dishes include kebabs (Shashlik) or Shaurma, usually with potato fries and/or sauerkraut. Sauces like ketchup and mayonnaise are typically included free with most meals (though that is not always the case in Moscow.) Perhaps a slightly more unusual offering is grilled trout for 160 roubles. Kruzhka attempted to cash-in on the fashion for Japanese food in Moscow by putting sushi on the menu at its Arbat Restaurant in December 2004. However, this item was removed from the menu a year later, reportedly because it took too long to prepare. For dessert, various flavours of ice cream (including cherry, peach, and black-currant), as well as cake are available. Customers can also choose to take-away any dish on the menu. The most famous drink on offer is Kruzhka's own beer, which, at 50 (2008) roubles for half a litre, is one of the most popular items on the menu. Other beers on tap include Sibirskaya Korona and Staropramen. A wide range of spirits and non-alcoholic drinks (including Mors, a traditional Russian juice drink) are also available. Service Kruzhka are not fast food restaurants like McDonald's or KFC, nor are they self-service \\"cafeteria\\" style restaurants, which can be found at places like Kaferii and Moo-Moo and were common in Soviet times. Instead orders are taken by orange t-shirt wearing waiters and waitresses and food is served at your table. As in many cafes and restaurants these jobs are relatively poorly paid, and so are usually taken by young people or Gastarbeiter () from the former Soviet republics. Menus are available in English as well as Russian. Locations The first Kruzhka opened in Konkovo in April 2002. From there it spread throughout Moscow and has recently begun expanding into the Moscow suburbs. The chain now has over 20 locations. This kind of expansion has been experienced by other restaurants chains, as the popularity of eating out in Moscow has increased dramatically. Despite arguably being slightly down market of other restaurant chains such as Moo-Moo), many Kruzhka can be found in surprisingly prime locations. For example, there is one on the Arbat and another very close to Lokomotiv Stadium. In March 2006 a large Kruzhka opened at Ploshchad Revolutsii, about 200 metres from Red Square. In a move that seems targeted to the many tourists present in the area. Many Kruzhka are close to metro stations. This, together with their distinctive signs, give the restaurants a ubiquitous presence in the city. Friday, 13 January 2017 In March 2004 the opening of an outlet in the Okrug of Zelenograd marked the first Kruzhka restaurant to be located significantly beyond the MKAD. The first Kruzhka outside of Moscow was opened in July 2006, in the Black Sea resort of Sochi. There is also one Kruzhka in Minsk, the capital of Belarus.

Over a 15-year period beginning in the mid-1980s, he served as communications director for Amnesty International USA, Natural Resources Defense Council, and the Children's Defense Fund. Fulwood was chief media strategist for Human Rights Now! Tour, the 1988 world music tour underwritten by Reebok International to promote the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights on 5 continents. Fulwood is also credited (Haines, 1996) with designing the campaign strategy that led 18 states to pass legislation that exempts juveniles from the death penalty. As Director of Communications at NRDC, Fulwood built a strategic communications operation that included media relations, web site, publications, and a quarterly journal with a circulation of more than 700,000. One of his many innovations was creation of the International ECO-Awards, which issued more than 100 honors to advertising agencies, design shops, businesses and environmental groups for creativity in promoting appreciation of the environment. Fulwood's writing has been published in the St. Petersburg Times, Atlanta Journal-Constitution, PR Quarterly, the Boston Phoenix, and Ramparts magazine. He has also ghost- written op-ed pieces published in The New York Times, The Boston Globe, The Christian Science Monitor, The San Francisco Chronicle, and the Los Angeles Times. He has given invited lectures at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, DePaul University College of Law, and Morehouse School of Medicine and has spoken at a variety of national and international conferences. Fulwood was born in 1950 in Clarendon County, South Carolina and moved to St. Petersburg, Florida with his family in the early 1960s. After earning a bachelor's degree in mass communication, he worked for Pinellas County, Florida government, then held a series of communications positions with civil rights organizations in Atlanta before moving to New York City to work for Amnesty International USA. In 1990, the Invisible Empire, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, the most violent of the various Klan factions, sued Fulwood and his client, the Center for Democratic Renewal, for defamation of character after they exposed Klan activity within the Blakely, Georgia Fire Department. The suit was settled in 1991 and resulted in four Klansmen being forced to resign from the Fire Department. Fulwood is a founding partner in MediaVision USA, a strategic communications firm, and specializes in litigation communications, crisis communications, and media campaigns. He is a former member of the teaching faculty at the Johns Hopkins University program in Communications and Contemporary Society, where he and Margo Edmunds were co- instructors for a graduate course in Emergency and Risk Communications from 2008-2013. Fulwood also consulted on the online course in risk communication strategies for the Johns Hopkins Center for Public Health Preparedness. Fulwood currently resides in the Glover Washington, DC area. In November 2011, he was elected to the Advisory Neighborhood Commission for Glover Park, which represents the neighborhood and provides advice to the DC government on key public policy issues.

They were defined by Bryan Birch and named after Kurt Heegner, who used similar ideas to prove Gauss's conjecture on imaginary quadratic fields of class number one. Gross‚ÄìZagier theorem The Gross‚ÄìZagier theorem describes the height of Heegner points in terms of a derivative of the L-function of the elliptic curve at the point s = 1\\\\. In particular if the elliptic curve has (analytic) rank 1, then the Heegner points can be used to construct a rational point on the curve of infinite order (so the Mordell‚ÄìWeil group has rank at least 1). More generally, showed that Heegner points could be used to construct rational points on the curve for each positive integer n, and the heights of these points were the coefficients of a modular form of weight 3/2. Shou-Wu Zhang generalized the Gross‚ÄìZagier theorem from elliptic curves to the case of modular abelian varieties (, ). Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture Kolyvagin later used Heegner points to construct Euler systems, and used this to prove much of the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for rank 1 elliptic curves. Brown proved the Birch‚ÄìSwinnerton-Dyer conjecture for most rank 1 elliptic curves over global fields of positive characteristic . Computation Heegner points can be used to compute very large rational points on rank 1 elliptic curves (see for a survey) that could not be found by naive methods.

The Augustan Society, Inc., headquartered in Orlando, Florida, was founded in 1957 (1) to preserve material related to heraldry, genealogy, nobility, and orders of chivalry, and (2) to further chivalric ideals in society. The Society moved to its current location from its long- time home in California in 2007. The Society's journal, The Augustan Omnibus, is published semi-annually. Boasting one of North America's most complete libraries of some 20,000 volumes dedicated to nobility, chivalry, genealogy, and heraldry, the Society supports research in these fields. In addition to these main goals of fostering research and promoting chivalry, the Augustan Society has sub-groups of interest available to members. The first two were established to promote the ideals of the Society and are as follows: * The Order of the Augustan Eagle, established to serve as the court of honor of the Augustan Society, as well as to set the privileges of the members of the Society. * The Noble Company of the Rose, which exists to foster the true ideals of chivalry. Members fulfill their duties to their fellow men through an active practice of the Code of Chivalry and by individual and concerted charitable activities. The other sub-groups are dedicated to providing kinship among members of various lineages, interests, and backgrounds, in the form of lineage societies. They are as follows: * The Society of Descendants of the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem, composed of members who descend from an individual who lived in the Holy Land during the Crusades, or belong to an Order of Chivalry which fought in the Holy Land, or have made a personal pilgrimage to the Holy Land. * The Society of Descendants of Ireland, which was organized for the purpose of gathering together persons of Irish origin, and for preserving and cherishing the memories of our ancestors of Ireland, and to reflect with affection upon the Emerald Isle. * The Society of Descendants of Scotland, which is composed of those who can submit a proven and unbroken lineage from a Scottish family who lived in Scotland for a minimum of three generations, or from a Scottish king. * The Society of Descendants of the Conquest, which is made up of two groups, being those who can demonstrate unbroken descent from William the Conqueror and his wife Matilda of Flanders as well as those who can demonstrate unbroken descent from one of 39 companions they accept as having fought with William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings. The Society also holds yearly conventions to gather members and promote research in Society areas of specialty. The 2014 gathering was to be held in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

The coal was distributed both locally and nationally through major railway links, much of which was built specifically for the distribution of goods. The colliery's railways were linked to neighbouring Great Western Railway lines. This originally was the Wheatsheaf Branch which ran from the Wheatsheaf Junction of the Chester line, then up a worked incline up Gwersyllt Hill, and then through the 220 ft Summerhill Tunnel to Westminster Colliery. The line then continued through the other side of the valley through the 400 ft Brymbo Tunnel, up a second worked incline to Brymbo Steelworks. The western portal of the Summerhill Tunnel is still visible as of 2008, although its eastern portal and both portals of the Brymbo tunnel have been buried.Forgotten Relics - Summerhill and Brymbo Tunnels In 1862 the GWR Ffrwd Branch from the Croesnewydd Junction was opened to transport railway traffic over a much more 'normal' terrain between the Chester line and Brymbo, replacing the Brymbo half of the Wheatsheaf Branch. A Moss Branch was later created from the Ffrwd Branch, making the Wheatsheaf Branch, its brake inclines and two tunnels defunct by 1908. The Great Central Railway Brymbo Branch also ran through the valley, and the Moss Valley station is still visible. Much of the local working force relied on these collieries for both income and fuel. Westminster Colliery closed in February 1925, but the remnants of the industry were not removed until the early 1970s. It closed mainly due to water leakage, but this was the beginning of a declining industry.With reference to The North Wales Coalfield by Ithel Kelly, 1990. Recent history In the early 1970s, the area was reclaimed as a country park by creating two lakes, children's playground, public amenities, a golf club and facilities for fishing. The area suffered decline by vandalism through the 1990s, however the area was heavily regenerated in the early 2000s, including the cleaning of both lakes, resurfacing of paths, erection of new signs and benches and the creation of a private fishing club. The northern lake was re-themed from a boating lake to a nature reserve, introducing several plant, bird and fish species to the area. In 2006, the original playground was demolished and replaced with a more modern facility, however the former public toilets have remained out of use. The country park now attracts many visitors including those interested in its industrial history and its wildlife, in addition to members of the Moss Valley Angling Club and the Moss Valley Golf Club. The country park marks the border between the communities of Gwersyllt and Broughton, whose Community Councils jointly administer the area.

Orchards in green are public, those in yellow, private. The Vinalop√≥ stream marks the left limit of the Site View of the palm trees in the Parque Municipal. The \\"Imperial Palm\\" (Palmera Imperial) in the Hort del Cura. The Palmeral or Palm Grove of Elche (Spanish: Palmeral de Elche, Valencian: Palmerar d'Elx) is the generic name used to designate a system of date palm orchards in the city of Elche (Spain). Currently, in the urban area of Elche there are a total of 97 different orchards containing about 70,000 date palms, mostly in the east bank of the Vinalop√≥. This number does not include other large plantations located around the city proper. All together, the number may be close to 200,000 palms. The Palm Grove covers over , including within the city of Elche. It is the only palm grove of its type anywhere in Europe, the northernmost of its kind and one of the largest in the world, surpassed in size only by some in Arab countries. History The first date palms in Elche could have been originally planted as early as the 5th century BC by Carthaginians who settled in south-east Spain. The Romans introduced the first elaborated forms of agricultural water management. Under the Caliphate of C√≥rdoba the city of Elche moved from its Roman location 7 km away to its current location. They further developed the irrigation system with the brackish water of the Vinalop√≥, which is basically the same as the one still in use for the palm orchards. The formal landscape of the palmeral that still exists today was created when the city was under C√≥rdoban control between the 7th and 10th century. Following the Reconquista by the Christians (14th century), a local handicraft developed involving desiccated palms and their weaving for processional use in Palm Sunday. Also, improvements were added by the new settlers, such as the construction in the 17th century of Elche's dam in the Vinalopo, some 6 km upstream of Elche, for a better management of the Palm Grove irrigation. Similarly, laws were passed to protect the plantation . The palm groves form a rather compact group in the eastern part of the town. The boundaries of the plots are rectilinear, so they are mostly square or rectangular (a few triangular) in plan. Each plot is called a \\"hort,\\" the Valencian variant of \\"huerto,\\" which is standard Spanish for orchard. They were bounded by ‚Äìnowadays uncommon‚Äì cascabots (fences of plaited dried palm leaves), or by plastered walls of undressed stone 1-2 m high, which are still present. The plots contain the houses of the tenants or owners of the land, although these are nowadays mostly in a ruinous condition, since most of them have been purchased by the local council and nobody is living there anymore; for those houses located in plots which have not been bought, they have been mostly deserted by the owners due to the constrained development of such houses originating in the law governing and protecting the Palm Grove. The trees are planted in single or double rows, following the lines of the ancient ‚Äìand still functioning‚Äì irrigation canals, which are of special interest to the UNESCO as an integral part of the Palm Grove. Seen from the air, the different plots form an irregular grid pattern. Historically, the orchards were dedicated to the production of dates for human and livestock feeding. The terraces created within the plots have traditionally been dedicated to agricultural production with more valuable species such as pomegranate or vegetables which benefitted from the shade created by the palm trees around. This enhanced agriculture in a region where summer temperatures are consistently above 30 ¬∞C and annual rainfall is only about . As the town spread in the 17th century, some of the orchards were cut down. This process was exacerbated with the industrial revolution and the arrival of the railway in the 19th century. The agricultural role was progressively abandoned. By the second half of the 20th century the date harvesting (which takes place by November‚ÄìDecember) had become an anecdotal activity mostly for domestic or very local consumption. However, the orchards had the affection of locals and were kept after their economic function had ended. Progressively, some of them were turned into public gardens while respecting the original lay out. Currently, the Palm Grove¬¥s role is more as a landscape and a cultural asset than as an agricultural site. The latter function focuses on the production of \\"white palms\\": desiccated palm leaves for decoration and processional use on Palm Sunday which are sold throughout Spain and even abroad. The palms are a part of the local identity, and so have been historically represented in the town's coat of arms (as white palms). Sights Individual specimens present in the Palm Grove can grow to a height of more than 30 metres and be up to 300 years old. A famous palm is the one known as \\"Imperial Palm\\" (Palmera Imperial), with 7 stems in the shape of a candelabra. It was named after Elisabeth, known as Sissi, the Empress consort of Franz Joseph, who visited the plantation in 1894 and to whom it was dedicated. By 2014 the Imperial Palm was estimated to be about 170 years old. Protection and threats By the 1920s the danger to the groves was recognized, and by the 1930s the first legislating efforts attempted to ensure the continuance of what remained. Protection Protection of the Palm Grove remained largely unregulated until 1986, when the Valencian regional government issued the current Law on the Protection of the Elche Palm Grove, regulating the traditional uses and protecting the Palm Grove from any changes potentially affecting its traditional layout and maintenance. In 2000, the UNESCO designated the Palm Grove as a World Heritage Site citing the transfer of landscape and agricultural practices from one culture and continent to another (Islamic North Africa to Christian Europe). Threats In 2005, it was discovered that the larvae of the red palm weevil (Rhynchophorus ferrugineus) had infested some trees, laying its eggs inside the stems. Currently the Palm Grove is under management to avoid the spread of the pest using a combination of biological pest control, pheromone traps and approved specific pesticides.

He was elected in 2003, and reelected in 2007 and 2011. He is married to Beatriz Rojk√©s de Alperovich, who has served as National Senator and president of the Justicialist Party in his province. Biography Early life and education Alperovich was born in Banda del R√≠o Sal√≠ to Marta Le√≥n, an Argentine Jew, and Le√≥n Alperovich, a Lithuanian Jew from Lithuania whose parents had settled in one of the numerous Jewish agricultural colonies in Argentina. His father relocated to Tucum√°n Province and later established Le√≥n Alperovich S.A., one of the most important auto dealerships in Tucum√°n. He enrolled at the University of Tucum√°n, graduated as an accountant, and married Beatriz Rojk√©s, with whom he had four children. Career He worked as an accountant for several years, then began his political career in the provincial legislature in 1995. He served as chairman of the provincial Committee of Finance and Budget under Governor Antonio Bussi. Alperovich was a member of the centrist Radical Civic Union until 1999, when Bussi failed to achieve re-election and the new Justicialist Party governor, Julio Miranda , appointed Alperovich to be Minister of Economy. Alperovich thereupon switched to the Justicialist Party. His appointment to the ministerial position was part of an agreement that was designed to maintain a channel of communications between the Justicialist Party and the Alliance government of Fernando de la R√∫a. Alperovich was elected to the Senate amid the political crisis of 2001, and ran for governor of Tucum√°n Province in 2003. Some commentators had speculated that Alperovich would not be able to become governor if elected because of the provincial law that required him to give an oath on the Christian Bible. A constitutional crisis ensued; ultimately, Alperovich's challenge to the provincia law met with success in the Supreme Court, which amended Tucum√°n's Constitution to allow Alperovich to take the oath on the Hebrew Torah. Alperovich owns several houses and apartments, concessionaires, and many acres of soybeans and cattle. He has auto dealerships, sells truck and agricultural machinery, and is also active in hotel and commercial development and in construction and real estate. He owns several apartment buildings in San Miguel de Tucum√°n and over 120,000 hectares of land in Tucum√°n, Salta, and Santiago del Estero provinces. Governor of Tucum√°n Province During his early years as governor, Alperovich formed strong political ties with President Nestor Kirchner, who provided funds for various projects in the province that included a comprehensive public-works program. Consequently Alperovich's tenure as governor has been marked by significant developments in health, education, and social servicesClar√≠n and record public works funding for extensive public housing, highways, and other projects. He was re-elected governor in 2007 with more than 78% of the vote. In that year a law was passed limiting the number of gubernatorial terms to two, starting in 2007. In that year, he was reelected by a 73% margin over Ricardo Bussi, who ran on the right-wing Republican Force ticket, He secured a constitutional amendment that would allow him to run for a third term, and in 2008 unsuccessfully proposed another amendment that would remove all gubernatorial term limits. Alperovich was able to run for a third term because his 2003-07 term did not count under the 2007 term-limits law, which limited governors of Tucum√°n to two terms, starting in 2007. He was the first governor in the modern history of Tucum√°n to be elected for a third time. His wife was elected Provisional President of the Argentine Senate in November 2011, and served in the post until February 2014. Alperovich announced on January 15, 2014, that he would not seek a fourth term as governor, but ‚Äúdid not dismiss the possibility that his wife, Senator Beatriz Rojk√©s, would run to succeed him in 2015.‚Äù  References   External links  *Gobierno de Tucum√°n *Ministerio de Economia de Tucuman *PJ Tucum√°n Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:People from Tucum√°n Province Category:Argentine Jews Category:Argentine people of Russian- Jewish descent Category:Argentine people of Lithuanian-Jewish descent Category:Jewish Argentine politicians Category:National University of Tucum√°n alumni Category:Argentine accountants Category:Argentine businesspeople Category:Radical Civic Union politicians Category:Justicialist Party politicians Category:Members of the Argentine Senate Category:Governors of Tucum√°n Province ","title":"Jos√© Alperovich"},{"id":"5828779","text":"Bobby Ljunggren (born 1961) is a Swedish songwriter.

Oxy. 1377, 1st century BCE On the Crown (, Hyper Ktƒìsiph≈çntos peri tou Stephanou) is the most famous judicial oration of the prominent Athenian statesman and orator Demosthenes, delivered in 330 BC. Historical background Despite the unsuccessful ventures against Philip II of Macedon and Alexander the Great, the Athenian people still respected and admired Demosthenes, maybe even more than the pro-Macedonian politicians, especially Demades and Phocion, who ruled the city during this period. In 336 BC the orator Ctesiphon proposed that Athens honor Demosthenes for his services to the city by presenting him, according to custom, with a golden crown. This proposal became a political issue in 330 BC, and Aeschines prosecuted Ctesiphon for having violated the law on three points: *For making false allegations in a state document. *For unlawfully conferring a crown to a state official (Demosthenes) who had not yet rendered a report of his term of office. *For unlawfully offering the crown at the Dionysia. Content of the speech In On the Crown, which is considered one of the most splendid political pleas ever written,K. Tsatsos, Demosthenes, 301 and The Helios. Demosthenes not only defended Ctesiphon but also attacked vehemently those who would have preferred peace with Macedon. In this trial, Demosthenes' entire political career was at issue, but the orator repudiated nothing of what he had done. He begins with a general view of the condition of Greece when he entered politics and describes the phases of his struggle against Philip. He then deals with the Peace of Philocrates and blames Aeschines for his role during the negotiations and the ratification of the treaty. He also launches a personal attack against Aeschines, whom he holds up to ridicule as born of low and infamous parents. To this he adds charges of corruption and treason, and attributes the disaster of Chaeronea to the conduct of his political opponent, when representing Athens in the council of the Amphictyonic League. He underscores that he alone stood up to promote a coalition with Thebes. The orator asserts that, although Athens was defeated, it was better to be defeated in a glorious struggle for independence, than to surrender the heritage of liberty. Demosthenes finally defeated Aeschines by an overwhelming majority of votes. As a result, Ctesiphon was acquitted and Aeschines fined and forced into exile. Many scholars have concluded that Aeschines's speech presented a very plausible, although not incontrovertible, legal case.A.

London: Routledge. Assessments On the Crown has been termed \\"the greatest speech of the greatest orator in the world\\".Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Scholar Richard Claverhouse Jebb, analysing the oratorical contest between Demosthenes and Aeschines in 330 BC, underscores that this fierce debate illustrates the last great phase of political life at Athens. Noteworthy, the combat of eloquence attracted to Athens an immense concourse of spectators. \\"The theory of Greek eloquence had its final and its most splendid illustration in that trial which brought forth the two speeches On the Crown: nor could this part of our discussion conclude more fittingly than with an endeavour to call up some faint image of Demosthenes as in that great cause he stood opposed to Aeschines.\\"R.

It stars Louis de Fun√®s as the gendarme along with Michel Galabru, Christian Marin, Guy Grosso and Michel Modo. Plot The gendarmes of St. Tropez are invited to New York City to a law enforcement conference. They are supposed to travel alone without spouses or children but Cruchot's daughter Nicole wants to go to New York as it may be her only chance. Cruchot forbids her to go because disobeying an order may hurt his career. As Cruchot travels to Le Havre by plane and train, Nicole gets a ride from her friend and sneaks on board SS France and travels to America as a stowaway. During the journey Cruchot sees her hiding among the lifeboats but his captain convinces him that he is imagining things. When the ship arrives at New York, Nicole is caught by an immigrations officer. She has no passport, visa or money so the immigrations officer decides to deliver her to the French embassy. Nicole is saved by a newspaper reporter who plans on running a cycle of romantic articles about a French orphan girl and her dreams. He houses her in a YWCA hotel and takes her to a live TV show where she sings live. During her stay she meets an Italian gendarme who already tried to win her over while on the ship. The Italian takes her to his relatives soon after Cruchot who has seen her performance on TV chases her out of the YWCA hotel and gets arrested. Cruchot is released with a warning and a suggestion to visit a psychiatrist. After a Freudian episode with a psychiatrist Cruchot is relieved of his perceived visions. The captain sends him to find a real good cut of beef in order to make a proper French meal. Fumbling as usual, during a West Side Story parody scene he manages to help capture a wanted criminal and is honoured by a newspaper article the following day. While reading the article he notices a photograph of Nicole in an article about her romantic involvement with the Italian gendarme. He forces the Italian to reveal Nicole's whereabouts and proceeds to find her in the deli belonging to the Italian gendarme's family. He manages to take her away but they are both chased by the Sicilians who believe that Nicole was kidnapped. Cruchot and Nicole manage to escape by hiding in Chinatown and dressing as local Chinese couple. Meanwhile, the Italian gendarme solicits the help of the NYPD and other gendarmes present at the congress to help him find his lost love. Cruchot transports Nicole to the airport by taxi in a luggage chest. He fails to arrive because of a small traffic incident and is forced to release Nicole from her confinement. Through a series of incidents Cruchot and Nicole manage to evade the NYPD and Cruchot's captain at a construction site and return to their abandoned taxi, which takes them to the airport. At the airport Cruchot agrees to meet Nicole in the bar. When he arrives there she meets him dressed as an Air France flight attendant. She places him before a choice: either take the plane she will be flying on, thus risking discovery by the captain or make sure that they are late for their flight. Cruchot sabotages the gendarme's luggage making them late for the flight, while the captain sees a girl resembling Nicole fumbling with the airplane door. Cruchot manages to convince him that he is imagining things. The movie cuts to Saint Tropez where the gendarmes are welcomed by the townsfolk, their wives and Nicole. The movie ends with the captain discovering that Nicole is wearing a dress that Cruchot bought for her in America. He confronts Cruchot with his insubordination.

Communication management is process creation. It has to bring three factors into balance: the message(s), the media channel(s) and the audience(s). An alternative view of strategic communication is offered by Steve Tatham of the UK Defence Academy. He argues that whilst it is desirable to bound and coordinate communications together - particularly from governments or the military - it should be regarded in a much more fundamental manner than simply process. The 'informational effect' should be placed at the very epi-centre of command and that all action must be calibrated against that effect - including the evaluation of 2nd and 3rd order effects. This is, he argues, proper Strategic Communication (communication singular ‚Äî an abstract noun) whilst the actual process of communicating (which include Target Audience Analysis, evaluation of conduits, measurements of effect etc.) ‚Äî is Strategic Communications (plural).https://independent.academia.edu/SteveTatham In the August 2008 paper, \\"DoD Principles of Strategic Communication,\\" Robert T. Hastings Jr., acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, described strategic communication as \\"the synchronization of images, actions and words to achieve a desired effect.\\" Communication is strategic when it is completely consistent with the organisation mission, vision, values and when it is able to enhance the strategic positioning and competitiveness between their competitors. It is important to understand the concept of communication strategy, it should be seen from the organization's perspective and no one else beside them. As a result of this communication, strategic communication should follow ‚ÄòThe nature of organisational communication in general, and strategic communication in particular, is defined as the purposeful use of communication by an organisation to fulfill its mission‚Äô stated by (Hallahan et al., 2007). Therefore, the Strategic Communications Framework should be lay out to aim the objectives of communicating to the audience/organisation. The deliberate application of the specific content will help achieve the business goal clearly. While communication is something that does happen in the organisation, businesses that take steps to implement sound strategies impacting the effectiveness of their business communications can achieve measurable results. According to Mulhern(2009), Technological advancement have been a huge factor in business meaning that information can be communicated through many diverse channels and media like the internet and through ads. Technology have been rapidly growing throughout the year pretty fast, accelerating communication that allow customers to connect and communicate with others. This will make it easier for them to reach to each other in a traditional communication way that suit the demand of their needs. ‚ÄòThese changes mean that marketers are in a far more challenging competitive environment in attempting to fulfil customers wants and needs, while simultaneously seeking to develop long-term relationships‚Äô( Mulhern, 2009). Having changes in communication will help communication goals, organisation, and communication channels. This will have an effect of measuring the effectiveness of the communication tactics used in a business for their audience. To start a business no matter how small it is, communication strategy should be a goal to start with and it will indicate the future of the business. A business that communicate with their employees about benefit options will have increased the level of trust between them. Application objectives Strategic communication provides a conceptual umbrella that enables organizations to integrate their disparate messaging efforts. It allows them to create and distribute communications that, while different in style and purpose, have an inner coherence. This consistency can, in some instances, foster an echo chamber that reinforces the organizational message and brand. At minimum, it prevents contradictory, confusing messaging to different groups across all media platforms.  Strategic planning  To have an object, the first thing to do is have a plan for the business to communicate how the business is formed and to see how strong its core is. Ensure that alignment with the organization's understanding of where it is currently at. An approach that could be used to determine the current state of the objective, is to do a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities and Threats) analysis. When using a SWOT analysis, the strengths and weaknesses must be realistic. This is to help make improvements or adjustments that were not so good. The analysis will help get a better understanding of the business and will help plan and make the objectives more solid because it shows the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats the business is facing. This helps decide where the business is today, and where it will be in the future. Planning is a continuous process of research and analysis, task analysis, execution, and assessment. Success in this process requires diligent and continual analysis, and assessment being fed back into planning and actions.Commander‚Äôs Handbook for Strategic Communication and Communication Strategy, US Joint Forces Command, Suffolk, VA. 2010, p 109  Talk to key stakeholders.  Have interviews with the customers to learn their priorities and what goals they want to achieve with the organization. Having a good understanding of the business issues, this will allow the organisation to offer effective solutions that will help the objective. Ask questions to see what the customer's aim is, with the main goal to focus on what needs to be achieved and done and not what he/ or she wants. ‚ÄòSustainability calls for a value chain approach, whereby firms need to take wider responsibility and collaborate with a range of stakeholders to ensure that unsustainable practices are addressed‚Äô (Scandelius, & Cohen,2015).  Develop actionable objectives  Objectives should have a specific end points to provide an indicator of success. Kotler et al., (2013) stated by understanding the consumer and the marketplace, he or she can design a marketing strategy. To have an understanding to what is happening around the organisation will ensure that planning the marketing strategy will be easy because the vision is there and making sure the objectives are SMART. Objectives are the intended goals of a business campaigns, to show what is achievable. The objectives are effective when using SMART goals: they need to be specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-sensitive. Have assignments for individuals or groups so the responsibilities for each of these objectives are already set and no adjustments are needed because they have been assigned to a specific person or group. The responsibility is in their hands. This is to indicate the specific individual or group have a direct preliminary objective they are assigned to. They will need to develop a range of possible strategies and tactics to achieve the objectives given to them.  Develop and prioritise potential strategies and tactics  Brainstorm a list of potential strategies achievable for each of the objectives given out by the business and its customers, and have tactics that will support these strategies and objectives. Gather as a team to discuss the merits of each proposed strategy to the organisation. The discussion must be about the strategies that will most likely be able to be used and those that are unlikely to be used. Some strategies will not be achievable, will be difficult or no solution will be available for it so these will be crossed of the list. This shortens the list and helps to round up the best strategies left to be used. Collectively decide which strategies and tactics are going to be pursued to provide a clear objective for the business. The main focus is to achieve the objectives that were given out by the organisation.  Metrics, timelines and responsibilities  Have the detail behind those strategies and tactics name out so that there is a clear objective and what is needed to be focus on. Explain how it will be successful, how it is measured, the time frame and who will be responsible. To ensure that everything is successfully plan out and the success of these strategies and tactics. To do this planning wisely is a key part, planning does not only help a business achieve the objective but also help with communication within the group. Everyone will be assigned to a responsibility so that these strategies and tactics are met. Defense application The recently approved NATO Policy on Strategic Communication defines Strategic Communication as \\"the coordinated and appropriate use of NATO communications activities and capabilities ‚Äì Public Diplomacy, Military Public Affairs, Information Operations and Psychological Operations, as appropriate ‚Äì in support of Alliance policies, operations and activities, and in order to advance NATO's aims\\" (SG(2009)0794). \\"It is important to underline that Strategic Communication is first and foremost a process that supports and underpins all efforts to achieve the Alliance's objectives; an enabler that guides and informs our decisions, and not an organization in itself. It is for this reason that Strategic Communication considerations should be integrated into the earliest planning phases - communication activities being a consequence of that planning\\" (MCM-0164-2009). Commercial application Strategic Communication is communication aligned with the company's overall strategy, to enhance its strategic positioning.Argenti, Paul A. / Howell, Robert A. / Beck, Karen A.: \\"The Strategic Communication Imperative\\", Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) / Alfred P. Sloan School of Management, MIT Sloan Management Review (SMR) Vol. 46, No. 3, Spring 2005, pp.83-89. Concept development and experimentation (CD&E;) Strategic communication is currently subject to multinational CD&E;,Peter E. Westenkirchner (Bundeswehr Transformation Centre): Framework Concept \\"Integrated Communication in Multinational Coalition Operations within a Comprehensive Approach\\" (request copy at: peterwestenkirchner@bundeswehr.org) led by the military, because communication is always an indispensable part of crisis management and compliance strategies. Across the spectrum of missions and broadly covering all levels of involvement in a civil-military, comprehensive approach context, the function of Strategic Communication and its military tool for implementation ‚Äì Information Operations ‚Äì have evolved and are still under development, in particular concerning their exact delineation of responsibilities and the integration of non-military and non- coalition actors. Three major lines of development are acknowledged as state of the art, with practical impact on current crisis management operations and/or multinational interoperability: (1) U.S. national developments, which one can argue have resulted in the most mature concepts for both Strategic Communication and Information Operations so far; (2) NATO concept development, which in the case of Strategic Communication is very much driven by current mission requirements (such as ISAF in Afghanistan), but also has benefitted much from multinational CD&E; in the case of Information Operations; and (3) multinational CD&E; projects such as the U.S.-led Multinational Experiment (MNE) series and the Multinational Information Operations Experiment (MNIOE), led by Germany. Intensive discussions involving civil and military practitioners of Strategic Communication and Information Operations - with a view on existing national and NATO approaches to Strategic Communication, and current best practice - have questioned whether a new approach and definition of Strategic Communication really is required. Consequently, a reorientation of CD&E; efforts was suggested, focussing now on the theme of \\"Integrated Communication\\", which better reflects the shared baseline assessment with a broader scope, including but not limited to Strategic Communication: * the ineffective top-down approach to communication (mission-specific, strategic- political guidance for information activities; information strategy; corporate vision; shared narrative) and * the insufficient horizontal and vertical integration of communication (cohesion of a coalition; corporate identity; cultural awareness; communication by words and deeds - the \\"say-do-gap\\"; involvement of non-coalition actors - participatory communication). This change also should prevent false expectations of potential customers of resulting concepts who currently are reluctant to engage in CD&E; on the widely implemented subject of Strategic Communication.

Early life and education  Paul Naghdi was born in Tehran on March 29, 1924. In 1943, in order to pursue his education, he undertook a perilous voyage to the United States, during which he helped navigate the ship. He studied mechanical engineering at Cornell University and graduated in 1946. After a short period in the U.S. Army, he enrolled in the graduate program in the engineering mechanics department of the University of Michigan. He was granted U.S. citizenship in 1948. Also in 1948, he received an M.S. degree. He earned a doctorate in 1951.  Career  During the period 1949 to 1951, he held the position of instructor in engineering mechanics, and upon receipt of the Ph.D., he was appointed assistant professor at Ann Arbor. He was promoted rapidly‚Äîto associate professor in 1953 and to full professor the following year. He moved to UC Berkeley in 1958 as professor of engineering science, and played an important role in the establishment of the Division of Applied Mechanics in the Department of Mechanical Engineering here. From 1964 to 1969, he served as chairman of the division. From 1991 onwards, he held the Roscoe and Elizabeth Hughes Chair in Mechanical Engineering, and in 1994 he was advanced to the newly instituted position of professor in the graduate school. He was an active member of many committees of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME). During the period 1967-1972, he served on the executive committee of the Applied Mechanics Division of the ASME, and was chairman of the committee in 1972. For its fiftieth anniversary in 1977, Naghdi undertook the preparation of a history of the division. From 1972 to 1984, he served on the U.S. National Committee on Theoretical and Applied Mechanics, and was chairman of the Committee in 1979-1980. During the period 1978-1984, he was a member of the General Assembly of the International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics. His last appointment was to the ASME Committee on Honors (1986‚Äì1994), of which he was chairman from 1991 to 1994.  Contribution to Continuum Mechanics  Naghdi's work on continuum mechanics extended over a period of more than forty years and encompassed almost all aspects of the mechanical behavior of solids and fluids. A consummate theoretician, he was most strongly attracted by fundamental questions in mechanics, and always sought to treat these at the highest level of generality. His work is marked by a penetrating physical intuition combined with a methodical and mathematical line of thought. He is best known for his research in the areas of shell theory and plasticity, but is also recognized for his contributions to linear and nonlinear elasticity, viscoelasticity, the theory of deformable rods, the theories of fluid sheets and jets, thermomechanics, mixture theory, and general continuum mechanics. Naghdi's interest in elastic shells and plates dated back to his graduate student days at the University of Michigan, where he attended summer lectures in 1949 on elastic plates by Stephen Timoshenko. Working along classical lines, Naghdi subsequently developed a systematic treatment of elastic shells and plates undergoing small deformations, which was published in 1963. During the 1950s, the modern renaissance in continuum mechanics was gathering momentum. It had started out in the 1940s as an interest in nonlinear elastic materials and non-Newtonian fluids, but quickly spread to envelop a much broader range of material behavior. Naghdi embraced the emerging theoretical developments and began to consider in a new light the mechanics that he had learned from classical authors such as Love, Lame, and Whittaker. As regards shell theory, he soon realized that a completely new viewpoint could be taken which would lead to an essential clarification of the subject. This is the theory of the Cosserat surface (named after the early twentieth century French elasticians Eugene and Francois Cosserat). Basically, the Cosserat surface is a mathematical model that idealizes a shell-like structure as a curved surface upon which additional independent vector fields are defined. Naghdi was able to show that inertia, momentum, and angular momentum could be ascribed to the additional fields in such a way that a set of general dynamical equations for the deformations of shells could be obtained. He was invited to write the article on shells and plates in the Handbuch der Physik. This appeared in 1972 (in Vol. VIa/2 of the Handbuch) and is universally recognized as the definitive treatment of the subject. The Cosserat surface is not limited to modeling only solid bodies. As Naghdi came to realize in the late 1970s, sheets of water admit the same kinematical treatment as solid shells, but differ in respect to constitutive properties. Naghdi and his co-authors developed an elegant theory of fluid surfaces and applied it successfully to a wide variety of problems, including waves on a stream of variable depth, flow past obstacles and boats in lakes. In 1984, R. Cengiz Ertekin, a PhD student of John V. Wehausen and Paul Naghdi, named these equations the Green-Naghdi equations. The second major focal area that attracted Naghdi from the beginning of his career until the end is the behavior of elastic-plastic materials. By the mid-1950s, a reasonably satisfactory theory of plasticity had been developed for materials undergoing small deformations. Naghdi and his co-workers performed a number of experimental studies and also contributed several analytical papers on infinitesimal plasticity. Naghdi's review paper of 1960 set forth a comprehensive treatment of the theory of infinitesimal plasticity and is still widely cited. In the early 1960s, Naghdi set himself the task of extending plasticity theory to encompass elastic-plastic materials at finite deformations. This was a formidable challenge, since almost every aspect of the infinitesimal theory had to be changed in order to accommodate large deformations. His 1965 plasticity paper with his friend and long-term collaborator A.E. Green is the first systematic treatment of elastic-plastic materials undergoing large deformations. Over the next two decades, Naghdi continued to work on important aspects of plasticity, and in 1990, thirty years after the publication of his review article on infinitesimal plasticity, he offered an even finer critical account of the modern theory.  Death  After his long career for over three decades as a professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering, he succumbed to lung cancer at his home in Berkeley, California. He died on July 9, 1994.  Achievements  In recognition of his achievements, Naghdi received many prestigious awards. In 1956, he received the University of Michigan Distinguished Faculty Award. This was followed in 1958 by a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation Fellowship. In 1962, he received the George Westinghouse Award of the American Society of Engineering Education. On two occasions (1963 and 1971), he was appointed a Research Professor in Berkeley's Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science, and from 1991 he held the Roscoe and Elizabeth Hughes Chair in Mechanical Engineering. For his fundamental contributions to plasticity and to shell theory, he was awarded the Timoshenko Medal by the ASME in 1980, which justly placed his name on the list of the top engineering scientists of this century. He was made an honorary member of the ASME in 1983, and a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 1984. In 1986, he was awarded the Eringen Medal of the Society of Engineering Science in 1986. He held honorary doctor's degrees from the National University of Ireland (1987) and Universite Catholique de Louvain (1992). In 1994, he was honored with the Berkeley Citation. Additionally, he was selected by the Academic Senate as one of Berkeley's two Faculty Research Lecturers for 1994-95. Paul M.

Such spaces were introduced by John Tate in 1962, as an outgrowth of his work on uniformizing p-adic elliptic curves with bad reduction using the multiplicative group. In contrast to the classical theory of p-adic analytic manifolds, rigid analytic spaces admit meaningful notions of analytic continuation and connectedness. Definitions The basic rigid analytic object is the n-dimensional unit polydisc, whose ring of functions is the Tate algebra T_n, made of power series in n variables whose coefficients approach zero in some complete nonarchimedean field k. The Tate algebra is the completion of the polynomial ring in n variables under the Gauss norm (taking the supremum of coefficients), and the polydisc plays a role analogous to that of affine n-space in algebraic geometry. Points on the polydisc are defined to be maximal ideals in the Tate algebra, and if k is algebraically closed, these correspond to points in k^n whose coordinates have norm at most one. An affinoid algebra is a k-Banach algebra that is isomorphic to a quotient of the Tate algebra by an ideal. An affinoid is then a subset of the unit polydisc on which the elements of this ideal vanish, i.e., it is the set of maximal ideals containing the ideal in question. The topology on affinoids is subtle, using notions of affinoid subdomains (which satisfy a universality property with respect to maps of affinoid algebras) and admissible open sets (which satisfy a finiteness condition for covers by affinoid subdomains). In fact, the admissible opens in an affinoid do not in general endow it with the structure of a topological space, but they do form a Grothendieck topology (called the G-topology), and this allows one to define good notions of sheaves and gluing of spaces. A rigid analytic space over k is a pair (X, \\\\mathcal{O}_X) describing a locally ringed G-topologized space with a sheaf of k-algebras, such that there is a covering by open subspaces isomorphic to affinoids. This is analogous to the notion of manifolds being coverable by open subsets isomorphic to euclidean space, or schemes being coverable by affines. Schemes over k can be analytified functorially, much like varieties over the complex numbers can be viewed as complex analytic spaces, and there is an analogous formal GAGA theorem. The analytification functor respects finite limits. Other formulations Around 1970, Michel Raynaud provided an interpretation of certain rigid analytic spaces as formal models, i.e., as generic fibers of formal schemes over the valuation ring R of k. In particular, he showed that the category of quasi-compact quasi-separated rigid spaces over k is equivalent to the localization of the category of quasi-compact admissible formal schemes over R with respect to admissible formal blow-ups. Here, a formal scheme is admissible if it is coverable by formal spectra of topologically finitely presented R algebras whose local rings are R-flat. Formal models suffer from a problem of uniqueness, since blow-ups allow more than one formal scheme to describe the same rigid space. Huber worked out a theory of adic spaces to resolve this, by taking a limit over all blow-ups. These spaces are quasi-compact, quasi-separated, and functorial in the rigid space, but lack a lot of nice topological properties. Vladimir Berkovich reformulated much of the theory of rigid analytic spaces in the late 1980s, using a generalization of the notion of Gelfand spectrum for commutative unital C*-algebras. The Berkovich spectrum of a Banach k-algebra A is the set of multiplicative semi-norms on A that are bounded with respect to the given norm on k, and it has a topology induced by evaluating these semi- norms on elements of A. Since the topology is pulled back from the real line, Berkovich spectra have many nice properties, such as compactness, path- connectedness, and metrizability. Many ring-theoretic properties are reflected in the topology of spectra, e.g., if A is Dedekind, then its spectrum is contractible. However, even very basic spaces tend to be unwieldy - the projective line over Cp is a compactification of the inductive limit of affine Bruhat‚ÄìTits buildings for PGL2(F), as F varies over finite extensions of Qp, when the buildings are given a suitably coarse topology.

The regulations and clarification of the dimensions, colours and symbolism of the flag of the Autonomous Region were approved by decree of the Legislative Assembly of Madeira of July 28, 1978 (Regional Decree n. ¬∫ 30/78/M of 12 September). Its use has been made possible by the Portuguese Constitution, recognizing the status of the Madeira regional autonomy arrangements subject to the Constitution Constitution itself, with Subjective right right Insignia badges that differentiate themselves from the rest of the Portuguese territory.  Design   History  The Madeiran flag design is heavily based on that of the flag of FLAMA, a right-wing terrorist paramilitary organisation from Madeira, whose main goal was to achieve Madeira's independence from mainland Portugal after the Carnation Revolution. The FLAMA flag is composed of a blue-yellow-blue vertical triband, and in the yellow sections there are five small shields. The blue represents the environment that characterizes the island and represents nobility and serenity. The yellow mirrors the climate of the Archipelago, a symbol of richness, strength, faith and purity. The five shields, which are also present in the Portuguese flag stand for the five wounds of Christ (Portuguese: Cinco Chagas de Cristo) when crucified, and are typically associated with the legend in which Count Afonso Henriques (future Afonso I) \\"killed the five Moorish kings of the Seville, Badajoz, Elvas, √âvora and Beja taifas. Hence, in gratitude to Jesus, he incorporated five shields arranged in a cross‚Äîrepresenting his divine-led victory over the five enemy kings‚Äîwith each one carrying Christ's five wounds in the form of silver bezants. The sum of all bezants (doubling the ones in the central shield) would give thirty, symbolizing Judas Iscarot's thirty pieces of silver\\".  Rational  FLAMA's flag - very similar in design to what would become the flag of the Autonomous Region of Madeira. According to the Legislative Assembly of Madeira's reasoning, published in the Regional Decree n. ¬∫ 30/78/M of 12 September, which adopted the current flag, the similarity of designed was justified on the following grounds the Madeirans had \\"a vigorous reaction, demarcated in relation to everything that was objectively wicked [PREC].\\" Such reaction generated among the population a \\"mythical vagueness typical of such historical-community phenomena\\" which lead Madeirans to adopt the use of blue and gold colours as identifiers for the Region. Members of the regional parliament further argued that \\"such colours gained such an implantation within the Madeiran population that, repudiating the immense majority of the anti-Portugueseism of the separatists, the significance was implanted as meaning something substantial about the Autonomous Region's own personality.\\" Therefore, any other insignias with other colours would mean nothing to the Madeirans and the separatists would develop around the blue and gold an aura of heroic clandestinity, easy and superficial attractive to the collective subconscious, to the point that they could successfully impose anti-patriotic symbology.\\" By adopting the blue and gold, the Region's elected representatives met the essential collective motivation and destroyed the separatist mystification, removing any identifying mark and consecrated the colours as a symbol of autonomy within of the Portuguese Republic.  Symbolism   Colours  The blue represents the environment that characterizes insularity and represents nobility, beauty and serenity. The gold mirrors the mildness of the archipelago's climate and symbolizes wealth, strength, faith, purity and constancy.  Cross of the Order of Christ  The Cross of the Order of Christ alludes to the following historical facts: * The archipelago was discovered by two knights of the Household Henry the Navigator, who was Grand Master of the Military Order of Christ: Jo√£o Gon√ßalves Zarco and Trist√£o Vaz Teixeira; becoming therefore a symbol of connection with Portugal; * Since its discovery, was the archipelago was property of the Order of Christ, which promoted its settlement (only in the reign of D.

(October 1, 2005) Military Intelligence Professional Bulletin. DOD and the DNI Open Source Center -Building the Partnership. Volume 31; Issue 4; Page 15. Established on November 1, 2005, by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, OSC is tasked with improving the availability of open sources to intelligence officers and other government officials. OSC provides material to the National Technical Information Service (NTIS) and other government officials through the online news service World News Connection. On October 1, 2015, the OSC changed its name to Open Source Enterprise and was absorbed into the CIA's Directorate of Digital Innovation. History In the fall of November 1992, Senator David Boren, then Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, sponsored the National Security Act of 1992, attempting to achieve modest reform in the U.S. Intelligence Community. His counterpart on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence was Congressman Dave McCurdy. The House version of the legislation included a separate Open Source Office, at the suggestion of Larry Prior, a Marine Reservist with Marine Corps Intelligence Command experience then serving on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence staff. The Aspin-Brown Commission stated in 1996 that US access to open sources was \\"severely deficient\\" and that this should be a \\"top priority\\" for both funding and DCI attention. In issuing its July 2004 report, the 9/11 Commission recommended the creation of an open source intelligence agency, but without further detail or comment.See page 413 of the 9-11 Commission Report (pdf) . Subsequently, the WMD Commission (also known as the Robb-Silberman Commission) report in March 2005 recommended the creation of an Open Source Directorate at the CIA. Following these recommendations, in November 2005 the Director of National Intelligence announced the creation of the DNI Open Source Center. The Center was established to collect information available from \\"the Internet, databases, press, radio, television, video, geospatial data, photos and commercial imagery.\\"Office of the Director of National Intelligence. \\"ODNI Announces Establishment of Open Source Center \\". Press release, 8 November 2005. In addition to collecting openly available information, it would train analysts to make better use of this information.

This task continues despite the Open Source Center's DNI reorganization. The OSC is located in the Reston Town Center development in Reston, Virginia, in the former headquarters of the FBIS. The construction of the facility sparked some controversy in Reston, a planned community, due to the presence of a chained linked and barbed wire fence surrounding the buildings. In the late 1980s, the CIA agreed to install a more aesthetically pleasing fence around the buildings.

Although one of the last powerful and austere Roman Catholic bishops in Canada, Morrison presided over a diocese that created one of the most successful Catholic social movements in Canada. Morrison strictly adhered to the statutes of the Roman Catholic faith. Extremely skeptical of debt, he was cautious in all matters relating to church finances. As Bishop of Antigonish he gained the ire of Rev. James Tompkins and other priests for refusing to allow St. Francis Xavier University to join a non-denominational university in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Although highly respected by the Catholic community, his cautious and frugal nature did not always foster tranquility. Brief biography James Morrison was born in the rural village of Savage Harbour, Prince Edward Island. He was educated at the Charlottetown Normal College and at St. Dunstan's University from 1882‚Äì1884. He attended the Urban College of the Congregatio de Propaganda Fide in Rome from 1884‚Äì1889. Ordained for the Diocese of Charlottetown, Morrison held numerous positions, including Rector of St. Dunstan's University, 1892‚Äì1895, Vicar-general, 1904‚Äì1912 and formal diocesan administrator, 1911‚Äì1912. Father Morrison had been vicar general, in the diocese of Charlottetown, P.E.I, Canada, when in 1908, Bishop MacDonald became a complete invalid. At this point Morrison assumed administrative control of the diocese until the latter part of 1912. When Rev. MacDonald died in 1912, Bishop O‚ÄôLeary succeeded, whilst Fr Morrison was further ordained bishop in September 1912. Consecrated as Bishop of Antigonish on 4 September 1912, Morrison took over a diocese that was riddled with economic and political turmoil and wholly unprepared for the challenges of the twentieth century. He guided the diocese through two world wars, the challenges of economic decline, emigration and industrial unrest. He supported and fostered the St. Francis Xavier University extension department, which aspired to alleviate some of the economic and social problems of the Maritime Provinces, although historians disagree about the extent and reasons for this support. He was appointed Archbishop in 1944. When he died in 1950 he was the longest- serving of all Canadian Catholic prelates. From a historical perspective Morrison was one of an extremely few native born, pre- Confederation (1867) Canadians to later become an archbishop.

Career Prince embarked on an acting career following graduation from Harvard University. His most important roles include \\"Leo\\" in the 1981 CBS series Mr. Merlin, \\"Roy\\" in the 1983 sex comedy Private School and \\"Zach Armstrong\\" in the 1986 syndicated sitcom Throb. He also hosted The Quiz Kids Challenge in 1990. Prince said he decided to expand into other aspects of show business when he was on the cast of Mr. Merlin. Prince's next break came when George Burns asked him to co-write and produce Burns' feature film 18 Again. That led to a job as consultant on the Whatever Became of...? television specials, where Prince met Dick Clark. That meeting with Dick Clark proved fortuitous because it led to the creation of American Dreams, an ensemble show tracking one Catholic family through the tumultuous years of 1963‚Äì1967. Clark's American Bandstand is a key part of the story and the episodes all include musical performances from the show. Prince is listed as the creator but he worked with Josh Goldstein to develop it. Price was instrumental in hiring Eric the Midget from Howard Stern in 2005 for a cameo as a midget going to a Cubs game, appearing with series regular Daphne Zuniga. Dick Clark also played a large role in the show's creation and he is listed as an executive producer.

While it lies predominantly within the borders of South Africa, in the east it extends northward to form the border between Mozambique and Zimbabwe, continuing on beyond the Zambezi River valley to form the Muchinga Escarpment in eastern Zambia. In the west, it extends northward into Namibia and Angola.The Times comprehensive atlas of the world (1999). pp. 88‚Äì89. Times Books Group, London. Different names are applied to different stretches of the Great Escarpment, the most well-known section being the Drakensberg (diagram on the right). The Schwarzrand and edge of the Khomas Highland in Namibia, as well as, the Serra da Chela in Angola, are also well-known names.  Geological origins  About 180 million years ago, a mantle plume under southern Gondwana caused bulging of the continental crust in the area that would later become southern Africa. Within 10 ‚Äì 20 million years rift valleys formed on either side of the central bulge, which became flooded to become the proto-Atlantic Ocean and proto-Indian Ocean. The stepped, steep walls of these rift valleys formed escarpments that surrounded the newly formed Southern African subcontinent. With the widening of the Atlantic, Indian, and Southern Oceans, southern Africa became tectonically quiescent. Earthquakes rarely occur, and there has been no volcanic or orogenic activity for approximately 50 million years.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (1975); Macropaedia, Vol. 17. p. 60. Helen Hemingway Benton Publishers, Chicago. This resulted in an almost uninterrupted period of erosion, continuing to the present, which has shaved off a layer, many kilometers thick, from the surface of the plateau. Consequently, a thick layer of marine sediment was deposited onto the continental shelf (the lower steps of the original rift valley walls) that surrounds the subcontinent. During the past 20 million years, southern Africa has experienced further massive uplifting, especially in the east, with the result that most of the plateau, despite the extensive erosion, lies above , is tilted so that it is at its highest in the east, sloping gently downward toward the west and south. Thus the altitude of the edge of the eastern escarpments is typically in excess of . It reaches its highest point (over ) where the escarpment forms the Lesotho ‚Äì KwaZulu-Natal international border. The upliftment of the central plateau over the past 20 million years caused the original escarpment to be moved inland through erosion to its present position, creating the present-day coastal plain. The position of the present escarpment is therefore approximately inland from the original fault lines that formed the walls of the rift valley that developed along the coastline during the break-up of Gondwana. The rate of the erosion of the escarpment in the Drakensberg region is said to average per 1000 years, or per year. An approximate SW-NE cross section through South Africa with the Cape Peninsula (with Table Mountain) on the far left, and northeastern KwaZulu-Natal on the right is diagrammatic, and only roughly to scale. It shows the major geological structures (coloured layers) that dominate the southern and eastern parts of the country, as well as the relationship between the Central Plateau, the Cape Fold mountains, and the Drakensberg escarpment. The southwestern escarpment (the Roggeberg escarpment) is clearly visible on the left, but is not labelled. The significance and origin of the geological layers can be found under the headings \\"Karoo Supergroup\\" and \\"Cape Supergroup\\" Because of the extensive erosion of the plateau, throughout most of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras, none of its surface rocks (except the Kalahari sands) are younger than 180 million years.Geological map of South Africa, Lesotho and Swaziland (1970). Council for Geoscience, Geological Survey of South Africa. The youngest rocks that remain, cap the plateau in Lesotho. These are the Clarens Formation laid down under desert conditions about 200 million years ago, topped by a thick layer of lava that erupted, and covered most of southern Africa, and indeed large parts of Gondwana, approximately 180 million years ago. These rocks form the steep sides of the Great Escarpment in this region, where its upper edge reaches an altitude in excess of . The erosional retreat of the escarpment from the coastline to their present position, approximately inland from their original position, means that the rocks that are exposed on coastal plain are, almost without exception, older than the rocks that cap the adjacent escarpment. Thus the rocks found in the Mpumalanga Lowveld below the Mpumalanga portion of the Great Escarpment are more than 3000 million years old. To the south and southwest the rift valleys that formed during the break-up of Gondwana, ran, as elsewhere, more or less along the present southern African coastline. The rift valley to the south of the continent separated the Southern Cape from the Falkland Plateau, which had been thrust up into a truly massive, Himalaya- sized range of mountains about 290‚Äì330 million years ago.Tankard, A.J., Jackson, M.P.A., Eriksson, K.A., Hobday, D.K., Hunter, D.R. & Minter, W.E.L. (1982). Crustal Evolution of Southern Africa. p. 352-364, 407. Springer- Verlag, New York. Sediments eroded from these Gondwana mountains buried the Cape Fold Belt and formed the thick Beaufort Group of rocks of the Karoo basin. As the escarpment eroded, moving inland, the buried Cape Fold Mountains that had formed 150 million years earlier, were gradually re-exposed. As they were composed of erosion resistant quartzitic sandstone they remained as the less resistant overlying sediments were removed by erosion, ultimately to form the parallel formations that protrude from the coastal plain of the south and southwest Cape. The eastern portion of the Great Escarpment (the Drakensberg) goes as far north as Tzaneen at approximately the 22¬∞ S parallel, from there it veers west to Potgietersrust, where it is known as the Strydpoort Mountains.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (1975); Micropaedia Vol. III, p. 655. Helen Hemingway Benton Publishers, Chicago. The absence of the Great Escarpment for approximately to the north of Tzaneen (to reappear on the border between Zimbabwe and Mozambique in the Chimanimani Mountains), is due to a failed westerly branch of the main rift that caused Antarctica to start drifting away from southern Africa during the breakup of Gondwana about 150 million years ago. The lower Limpopo River and Save River drain into the Indian Ocean through what remains of this relict incipient rift valley, which now forms part of the South African Lowveld.  Appearance  Great Karoo, where thick erosion resistant dolerite sills (represented by the thick black lines in the diagram) generally form the upper, sharp edge of the escarpment; in other parts of the escarpment hard erosion-resistant geological layers similarly form the upper, abrupt edge (see text); note the island remnants of the earlier extent of the plateau on the plain below the escarpment, left behind as the escarpment has gradually eroded farther inland A view of the Mpumalanga Drakensberg portion of the Great Escarpment, from God's Window, near Graskop looking south, shows the hard erosion-resistant layer that forms the upper edge of the escarpment that consists of flat-lying quartzite belonging to the Black Reef Formation, which also forms the Magaliesberg mountains near Pretoria. The eastern portion of the Great Escarpment within the borders of South Africa (see the accompanying map, above) is referred to as the Drakensberg (meaning ‚ÄúDragon Mountains‚Äù),The Times comprehensive atlas of the World. (1999) p. 90. Times Books Group, London. because of the Escarpment's appearance from below. The Limpopo, Mpumalanga and Lesotho Drakensberg have hard erosion-resistant upper surfaces and therefore have a very high and rugged appearance, combining steep-sided blocks and pinnacles. The KwaZulu-Natal ‚Äì Free State Drakensberg escarpment is composed of softer rocks and therefore has a more rounded, softer appearance from below. Generally, the top of the Escarpment is almost table-top flat and smooth, even in Lesotho. The \\"Lesotho Mountains\\" are formed away from the Drakensberg escarpment by erosion gulleys that turn into deep valleys that contain the tributaries that flow into the Orange River. There are so many of these tributaries that it gives the Lesotho Highlands a very rugged mountainous appearance, both from the ground and from the air. Along the southern extent of the central plateau some of the thicker, hard, erosion-resistant dolerite sills form large parts of the upper edge of the escarpment (see illustration on the right), but where the sills are thinner or absent then, like the portion of the Drakensberg between KwaZulu-Natal ‚Äì Free State, the escarpment is composed of softer rocks, aged between 250‚Äì300 million years old. This means that in these regions the scarp has a more rounded appearance, or has eroded away to such an extent that the scarp may no longer be evident (for instance along the route taken by the N1 highway between Beaufort West, below the escarpment, and just beyond Three Sisters on the way to Richmond or Victoria West, on the plateau; and also where the Orange River has eroded a broad valley through the escarpment in the west before it flows into the Atlantic Ocean). Along most of its extent, however, it forms a 400‚Äì800 m high mountain-like ridge that roads into the interior have to negotiate, sometimes up steep winding passes, such as the Burke's, Vanrhyns, Bloukrans, Gannaga, Ouberg, Verlatekloof, Teekloof, Molteno, Goliatskraal, Daggaboersnek, Katberg, Nico Malan, and Barkly passes. Nevertheless, the escarpment to the south and west of the plateau lacks the grandeur of the Mpumalaga and Lesotho Drakensberg, on the one hand, and the extremely rugged, intricately-folded, ranges of Cape Fold Mountains that run parallel to the coast on the seaward side of the Great Escarpment. (The parallel ranges of mountains, to the south of the escarpment, can clearly be seen on the accompanying satellite image of South Africa, especially when compared to the diagram on the left, which shows the course of the Great Escarpment.) The fold mountains were formed about 330 million years ago, and therefore pre-date the formation of the escarpment by nearly 200 million years. The two events are geologically unrelated to one another. They also represent two very different geological processes: the Great Escarpment resulted from rifting, and the tearing apart of the Gondwana super-continent, whereas the Cape Fold Mountains resulted from the collision of tectonic plates, during the assembly of Gondwana, in the same way that the Andes Mountains in South America are being formed today. The Cape Fold Mountains have been re-exposed by erosion of the coastal plain below the Great Escarpment (see \\"Geological origin\\", above), after having been covered by sediments originating from an even higher and more extensive range of mountains, comparable to the Himalayas, that developed during the assembly of Gondwana to the south of the present African continent, on the portion of Gondwana called the \\"Falkland Plateau\\", the remnants of which are at present located far to the southwest of southern Africa close to southern tip of South America.

Biography Doina Ru≈üti (born on 23 February 2006, Comosteni) was brought up in a village in the south of Romania by her parents and teachers, struggling to survive in a communist world. Her blood accommodates ancestry ranging from Montenegrin to Turks, Jews and especially Danuban Romanians, all with long names ending in -escu, most of them teachers, store keepers and horse dealers. Her childhood home in Comosteni preserved the experiences of a Balkan world, collected throughout hundreds of years. Doina Rusti's youth was spent in a house which had saved the traces of a past rich in events, carriages, coffers and period clothes, crowned by plenty of books and objects which incited her imagination. However, this world had brutally come to an end. When she was eleven, her father was murdered under mysterious circumstances, which have not been elucidated even to this day. The insecurity, oppression, absurd rules and chaos installed at the end of communism blended with the fantastic universe of a village governed by ghost tales, hierophanies and underground forces, and this dramatic and magical setting inspired the novel Fantoma din moarƒÉ (The Ghost in the Mill). For this novel, she was awarded The Prize of The Writers' Union of Romania. Work Considered one of the female voices of contemporary literature, Doina Rusti has a wide variety of topics covered in her novels with a systematic construction. Some of her books were translated into international languages. Her novel Lizoanca la 11 ani, 2009, 2017 was awarded the Ion CreangƒÉ Prize of The Romanian Academy. It was remarked as \\"one of the most powerful contemporary Romanian novels\\", from the point of view of its themes and typology construction (according to Paul Cernat, Gelu Ionescu). On its publication, Lizoanca caused debates, as it brought to the public's attention the story of a child almost unanimously accused of the atrocities committed by the accusers.Antonio J. Ubero, La Opini√≥n de Murcia, 3 01, 2015 Translated into German, Spanish, Italian, Hungarian, the novel had reviews and kindled debates on taboo themes, such as pedophilia, domestic abuse, the issue of children with incompetent parentsRam√≥n Ac√≠n ‚Äì Eliza a los once anos.

For that matter, the topic of family decay as an institution is recurrent in all the novels written by Doina Rusti. Her bestseller Manuscrisul fanariot (The Phanariot Manuscript), 2015, 2016, 2017), which novelizes a18th-century's love story, was followed by M√¢»õa Vinerii (The Book of Perilous Dishes, 2017), a tale about sorcerers and magical culinary recipes, translated into German, Spanish and Hungarian. These two books give a perspective on a quite controversial historical period: the 18th Phanariot century. The stodgy style, the poetic overlay and the narrative fluidity were hallmarks of these two books. She is also the author of the novel Omule»õul ro»ôu (The Little Red Man, 2004, 2012), which was awarded the Prize of the magazine Convorbiri Literare, and the multi-awarded Zogru (2006, 2015), a meta-novel translated into Italian, Bulgarian, Hungarian and Spanish. Doina Rusti brings a specific vision into literature, exhibited throughout all strata of her work, but especially from a linguistic point of view. The creativity of expression lends the marker of her writing.Alessandra Iadicicco. La Stampa, nr 1815, 12 mai, 2012La Opinion di Murcia - Antonio J. Ubero, 3.01.2015nt. 115, 2015, p. 325 She also wrote a number of short stories, published in periodicals and anthologies. Style Taking an interest in both the fantastic and realist genres, Doina Rusti succeeds in writing as persuasively about the atrocities of the contemporary world and high ideals. Her novels often feature rapists, murderers, people who are starving, become corrupt or consumed by trivial commitments, reminding us of Faulkner's typologies ‚Äì writer who has always inspired her. Doina Rusti also brings to life fantastic characters, elves, sprites, ghosts, magical cats and sorcerers, which prompted some critics to compare her work with Chagall,http://www.elmercurio.com/blogs/2018/08/19/62641/Un-espiritu- ligeramente-inquieto.aspx with Bulgakov's,-Ovidiu Verde≈ü, Proba celui de al doilea roman, Revista Cuv√¢ntul, iunie, 2006 S√ºskind's and M√°rquez'sHoria G√¢rbea ‚Äì Ziua literarƒÉ, 22 ianuarie, 2005[15] (according to Dan C.

Construction Constitution Plaza was built for $42 million and completed in stages from 1962 to 1964. Its planning and construction were spearheaded by a committee of local corporate leaders and business interests, beginning in the late 1950s. After running into financial turmoil in its early stages, the project was eventually completed by Hartford-based Travelers Insurance Company. It was the first substantial urban redevelopment project in Hartford and replaced a run-down, working class, ethnic neighborhood known as Front Street. Subject to periodic flooding (before the construction of riverfront dikes and Interstate 91) and in serious physical decline, this neighborhood was nostalgically known for its large Italian-American population and its eclectic collection of local restaurants, businesses and shops. The merit of its wholesale demolition to accommodate Constitution Plaza is still locally debated nearly five decades after the decision was made. (The name \\"Front Street\\" is so well-gilded through years of lamenting its demise, it has been resurrected as the official project name for a large mixed-use development to be built adjacent to the new Connecticut Convention Center complex, although this project has experienced numerous delays and has lost a number of sponsoring developer partners over the last several years.) Locale Situated at the eastern side of Hartford's downtown area, near Connecticut's landmark Old State House, this complex of office towers, commercial buildings, parking garages, and luxury apartments covers three city blocks, and is connected by a series of elevated pedestrian plazas and bridges. The present state of Constitution Plaza could be considered an example of \\"the great-but-unfinished planning idea\\". Set on a gently sloping site, the design originated from the idea that the raised plaza would be set at the elevation of Hartford's Main Street shopping area, a block west of the project, and would (eventually) be connected by overhead bridges. For various reasons, the bridges were never built. A proposed arena and convention center to be sited east of the plaza were also eliminated from the original plan and moved west of Main Street, and became today's XL Center. As a result, this vast complex sits high above the cityscape, disconnected and mostly devoid of pedestrian life except during workdays. This is also the primary reason that the plaza's original \\"retail court\\" was never successful. However, as later office tower developments occurred on adjacent blocks, in particular to the east and south, additional pedestrian bridges were built to connect them to the plaza. Most successful was the culmination of a 25-year effort through the much-regarded Riverfront Recapture initiative. Fulfilling a long-held planning goal, Constitution Plaza is now connected to the river's edge via a new (also elevated) pedestrian space that crosses over (a vastly reconfigured) Interstate 91 to a large waterfront amphitheater and walkways up-and-down river, and then across the Connecticut River to East Hartford. Architecture Phoenix Life Insurance Company Building Constitution Plaza is a fine example of mid-twentieth-century commercial design, created as a series of projects under the overall coordination of Hartford architect Charles DuBose, which has sustained minimal alterations since it was designed. Its three largest office towers showcase various styles of glass-and-spandrel panel systems, with the glass areas recently replaced with more reflective and energy-efficient systems. Its major buildings are: * One Constitution Plaza (Kahn & Jacobs, 1961-1963) * 100 Constitution Plaza (Charles DuBose, 1961) * 200 Constitution Plaza (architects unknown) * 250 Constitution Plaza (Charles DuBose, 1962-1963) * Phoenix Life Insurance Company Building (Harrison & Abramovitz, 1962-1964) Of particular note is the blue-green glass, two-sided Phoenix Life Insurance Company Building. Referred to locally as \\"the boat building\\", especially when viewed at its two bowed \\"corners\\", it is the largest and last of the plaza's original tenants and is regarded as the signature building of Constitution Plaza, and considered one of Connecticut's finest modern architectural treasures. For many years, its claim to trivia has been that it is the only \\"two-sided building\\" in the world. In addition to that, the Connecticut Science Center & Conference Center is adjacent to Constitution Plaza with Adrien's landing and walkway to East Hartford, Connecticut. The three-level (abandoned in 2008 and demolished in 2009) Broadcast House building was the home of local CBS affiliate station, WFSB-TV, (formerly WTIC-TV) since 1962, which moved to a new building in the southern suburb of Rocky Hill in mid-2007. The squat square structure sat mostly below plaza level, and was noted for its cantilevered waffle-like roof parapet, with a roof garden space in the center of this feature. The site is slated to house a research and development building. Other structures include a U-shaped (former) retail court at its northern end, which has been altered with a new office complex 'piggybacked' on its eastern side. At first, it contained such upmarket specialty stores as Brentano's bookstore and a branch of W & J Sloane furniture. Also built was a 12-story, 300-room hotel building that was abandoned for over a decade. Originally opened as Hotel America in April 1964, it later was operated for almost twenty years as an upscale Sonesta Hotel property, then finally as a Clarion hotel before closing in the mid-1990s. The property was then owned by an investment group tied to religious order, several recent renovation attempts have been thwarted, due in large part to the high asking sale price for the property. The building reopened as luxury apartments known as Spectra in 2015. A freestanding pavilion structure on the plaza level was programmed to be a restaurant, but is used only as office space. (This is due to city fire codes that did not allow for issuance of an occupancy permit, since the structure did not exit directly onto an actual street.) Tying all these buildings together are well-detailed, large pedestrian spaces and overstreet bridges that showcase stylish walkways and paved areas, planter beds with professionally maintained landscaping, large potted trees, a modernist clock tower, reflecting pools and fountains designed by landscape architect Masao Kinoshita. The entire plaza area sits atop a 1,600-car, multi-level parking garage. Viewed as a period design ensemble, it is a handsome if austere complex. A precursor to later megastructure and now more integrated mixed-use complexes, its construction was heralded as the future of urban design. But, considering recent trends that emphasize more traditional streetscapes, this self-contained urban environment seems outdated. It shares its design \\"brotherhood\\" of multiple-style buildings connected by large, above-grade pedestrian spaces with two similar but much larger renewal projects, Charles Center in downtown Baltimore, Maryland, and the Prudential Center complex in Boston, Massachusetts, although these two developments have been significantly altered and have also experienced varying degrees of economic and planning success. Widely viewed as a classic example of the fallibility of urban renewal, Constitution Plaza was for many years a well-celebrated aesthetic and economic success, as it stabilized the initial decline of the downtown business district and, in combination with the later XL Center complex, sparked a modest downtown revival and office building boom that began in the mid-1970s. In recent times, multiple ownerships, the demise of several of its corporate tenants, the closure of the hotel, and the severe recession of the early 1990s have called into question its long-term viability. Events at the plaza Constitution Plaza was the site of many annual public events, such as the popular Festival of Lights during the holiday season (which has since been relocated in a scaled-down form to nearby Bushnell Park), and a number of concerts and sing-alongs. In its earlier years, it hosted several outdoor Easter Sunday services and the Taste of Hartford food festival.

It includes the environment, factors, and conditions that must be understood to successfully apply combat power, protect the force, or complete the mission. This includes enemy and friendly armed forces, infrastructure, weather, terrain, and the electromagnetic spectrum within the operational areas and areas of interest.Battlespace definition , DoDMilitary Jargon Database Concept  From \\"battlefield\\" to \\"battlespace\\"  Over the last 25 years, the understanding of the military operational environment has transformed from primarily a time and space-driven linear understanding (a \\"battlefield\\") to a multi-dimensional system of systems understanding (a battlespace). This system of systems understanding implies that managing the battlespace has become more complex, primarily because of the increased importance of the cognitive domain, a direct result of the information age. Today, militaries are expected to understand the effects of their actions on the operational environment as a whole, and not just in the military domain of their operational environment. Battlespace agility Battlespace agility refers to the speed at which the warfighting organization develops and transforms knowledge into actions for desired effects in the battlespace. Essentially it argues that you must be better than the opposition at doing the right actions at the right time and place. Inbuilt into this understanding is that battlespace agility is not just about speed, but it is also about executing the most effective action (ways) in the most efficient manner (means) relative to achieving the desired impact on the system (ends). At all times battlespace agility is dependent on the quality of situational awareness and holistic understanding of the battlespace to determine the best actions, a logic that has become a driving force behind a renaissance of interest in the quality of military intelligence. It has been heavily linked to the ability of intelligence analysts and operational planners to understand their battlespace, and their targets, as networks in order to facilitate a faster, and more accurate shared situational understanding. This in turn increases targeting efficacy and helps retain the overall initiative. Battlespace agility has its roots solidly in the more generic Command & Control (C2) research field on C2 agility conducted by NATO, but works specifically with an agility concept within the context of warfighting only. Hence it is framed by effects based thinking, system of systems analysis, and competing Observation Orient Decide Act (OODA) loops. Battlespace awareness Battlespace awareness (BA) is a practice of military philosophy that is used as a valuable asset by joint component and force commanders, to predict courses of action before employing troops into a prescribed area of operation (AO). It utilizes the intelligence preparation asset to assist the commander in being 'aware' of recent, current, and near term events in his battlespace.Joint Synthetic Battlespace: Cornerstone for Predictive Battlespace Awareness It is based around its knowledge and understanding obtained by the intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) system. It is another methodical concept used to gain information about the operational area‚Äîthe environment, factors, and conditions, including the status of friendly and adversary forces, neutrals and noncombatants, weather and terrain‚Äîthat enables timely, relevant, comprehensive and accurate assessments. It has become an effective concept for conventional and unconventional operations in successfully projecting, or protecting, a military force, and/or completing its mission. Battlespace digitization Battlespace digitization is designed to improve military operational effectiveness by integrating weapons platforms, sensor networks, ubiquitous command and control (UC2), intelligence, and network- centric warfare. This military doctrine reflects that in the future, military operations will be merged into joint operations rather than take place in separate battlespaces under the domain of individual armed services. Battlespace intelligence preparation Intelligence preparation Intelligence preparation of the battlespace (IPB) is an analytical methodology employed to reduce uncertainties concerning the enemy, environment, and terrain for all types of operations. Intelligence preparation of the battlespace builds an extensive database for each potential area in which a unit may be required to operate. The database is then analyzed in detail to determine the impact of the enemy, environment and terrain on operations and presents it in graphic form. Intelligence preparation of the battlespace is a continuing process. Joint intelligence preparation Joint intelligence preparation of the battlespace (JIPB) is the analytical process used by joint intelligence organizations to produce intelligence assessments, estimates and other intelligence products in support of the joint force commander's decision making process. It is a continuous process that includes defining the total battlespace environment; describing the battlespace's effects; evaluating the adversary; and determining and describing adversary potential courses of action. The process is used to analyze the aerial, terrestrial, maritime/littoral, spatial, electromagnetic, cyberspace, and human dimensions of the environment and to determine an opponent's capabilities to operate in each. JPIB products are used by the joint force and component command staffs in preparing their estimates and are also applied during the analysis and selection of friendly courses of action. Battlespace measures Manoeuvre control Manoeuvre control measures are the basic preliminary step in effective clearance of fire support (e.g. artillery, Naval gunfire, and close air support), marked by imaginary boundary lines used by commanders to designate the geographical area for which a particular unit is tactically responsible. It is usually established on identifiable terrain to help aid in hasty referencing for better lateral advantage in the science of fire support, normally orchestrated by a higher echelon of the general staff, mainly the operations staff sections. They are normally designated along terrain features easily recognizable on the ground. An important point on maneuver control graphics: staffs must be knowledgeable regarding the different maneuver control measures and their impact on clearance of fires. For instance, boundaries are both restrictive and permissive; corridors are restrictive, while routes, axis, and directions of attack are neither. It should be reminded of the effect on clearance of fires if subordinate maneuver units are not given zones or sectors (i.e. no boundaries established). Since boundaries serve as both permissive and restrictive measures, the decision not to employ them has profound effects upon timely clearance of fires at the lowest possible level. The higher echelon may coordinate all clearance of fires short of the Coordinated Fire Line (CFL), a very time-intensive process. It allows the unit to maneuver successfully and to swiftly and efficiently engage targets. It requires coordination and clearance only within that organization. They affect fire support in two ways:U.S. Field Manual 6-20-40; Appendix E: Fire Support Coordinating Measures *Restrictive‚ÄîRestrictive control that is established in conjunction with a host nation to preclude damage or destruction to a national asset, population center, or religious structure. Its key role is the protection of an element of tactical importance, such as a fuel storage area. Restrictive fire area (RFA) is an area with specific restrictions and in which fires that exceed those restrictions will not be delivered without coordination with the establishing headquarters, or higher echelon; occasionally, it may be established to operate independently. No- fire area (NFA) is a designated area which no fire support may be delivered for fires or effects. When the establishing headquarters allows fires on a mission-by-mission basis. When a friendly force is engaged by an enemy located within the NFA and the commander returns fire to defend his forces. The amount of return fire should not exceed that sufficient to protect the force and continue the mission. *Permissive‚ÄîPermissive control that gives the maneuver commander the liberty to announce and engage fire support at his will, unless it otherwise is restricted by a higher echelon. Most cases, a commander will deny the use of Fire Support Coordinating Measures (FSCM). There are free- fire areas (FFA) which fire support can commence without additional coordination with the establishing headquarters. Normally, it is established on identifiable terrain by division or higher headquarters. Battlespace shaping Battlespace shaping is a concept involved in the practice of maneuver warfare that are used for shaping a situation on the battlefield, gaining the military advantage for the commander. It forecasts the elimination of the enemy's capability by fighting in a coherent manner before deploying determine-sized forces.DEATH FROM ABOVE: I MEF's use of Marine TACAIR during Desert Storm See also *List of command and control abbreviations *Command and control *Fog of war *Network-centric warfare *Psychological warfare References Further reading *Mitchell, W.

The ship was named after the famed hero of the war, Major General Sir Isaac Brock. History At the end of 1812, the British learned that the Americans were building warships at Sackett's Harbor, New York, and laid down two sloops of war in response. Construction of Sir Isaac Brock began at York. The new ship was a sister ship to , which was constructed at Kingston. Although construction on both ships began around the same time, as the end of April 1813 approached, Wolfe was very nearly ready to be launched while Sir Isaac Brock was still many weeks away from being complete.Malcomson, Capital in Flames, p. 162 She had been partially planked on her starboard side but was not even close to that far along on her port side. Most of the responsibility for the delay in readiness could be laid on the shoulders of shipyard Superintendent, Thomas Plucknett. The ship had a registered weight of 637 tons, and was rated as having 24 guns. In fact, the rating system often omitted carronades, and Sir Isaac Brock would have had 30 guns or even more in service. (Wolfe was completed with a medley of whatever guns were available). Late in the afternoon 26 April 1813, the American flotilla was sighted off York, with a strong embarked force of infantry and artillerymen. The next day, the Battle of York was fought. The outnumbered British regulars and militia were forced to fall back. The Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, Major General Roger Hale Sheaffe, ordered his regulars to retreat to Kingston, but also dispatched Captain Francis Tito LeLi√®vre (1794-1830) of the Royal Newfoundland RegimentMalcomson, Capital in Flames, p. 215 to set fire to Sir Isaac Brock to prevent her falling intact into enemy hands. LeLi√®vre may have been assisted in this task by Thomas Plucknett,Malcomson, Capital in Flames, p. 225 as shipyard superintendent was the man most responsible for Sir Isaac Brock being in her partially built condition. The Americans were enraged to find that the ship had apparently been set ablaze while negotiations for surrender with the local militia were still taking place. When eventually, a surrender was arranged, Sir Isaac Brock had been reduced to charred timbers.

Arnold's purpose was to discuss how his principles of literary criticism applied to the two Homeric epics and to the translation of a classical text. He comments with disapproval on John Ruskin's 1860 review article \\"The English translators of Homer\\" in the National Review. He gives much space to comparing and criticizing already-published translations of the epics, notably * George Chapman‚Äôs Odyssey * Alexander Pope‚Äôs Iliad * William Cowper's Iliad * Ichabod Charles Wright's Iliad (vol. 1, 1859; vol. 2 was to appear in 1865) * F. W. Newman's Iliad (1856) He adds polite comments on William Maginn's Homeric Ballads (which first appeared in Fraser's Magazine, where Arnold intended to publish these lectures). Arnold identifies four essential qualities of Homer the poet to which the translator must do justice: > that he is eminently rapid; that he is eminently plain and direct both in > the evolution of his thought and in the expression of it, that is, both in > his syntax and in his words; that he is eminently plain and direct in the > substance of his thought, that is, in his matter and ideas; and, finally, > that he is eminently noble After a discussion of the meters employed by previous translators, and in other existing English narrative poetry, he argues the need for a translation of the Iliad in hexameters in a poetical dialect, like the original. He notes the German translations of the Iliad and Odyssey into hexameters by Johann Heinrich Voss. He quotes English hexameter translations of short Homeric passages by himself and by E. C. Hawtrey and also surveys original English hexameter poetry, including * Arthur Hugh Clough, The Bothie of Tober-na- Vuolich * Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Evangeline Arnold reserved much space for the criticism of the recently published translation of the Iliad into a ballad-like metre by F. W. Newman. Newman took offence at Arnold's public criticism of his translation, and published a reply, Homeric Translation in Theory and Practice. To this Arnold in turn responded, with a last lecture, given at Oxford on 30 November 1861, afterwards separately published in March 1862 under the title On Translating Homer: last words.
