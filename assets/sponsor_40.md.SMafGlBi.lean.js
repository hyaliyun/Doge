He pioneered the use of augmented releases of insect egg parasitoids in the genus Trichogramma to control lepidopteran pests in sugarcane. Wolcott was born to David Clinton Wolcott and Marion Delia Benedict in Utica, New York. His father was a lawyer and his mother was a talented watercolour artist. His brother and sister took to architecture while he followed an early interest in insects. He studied at the Utica Free Academy and graduated from the New York State College of Agriculture around 1907‚Äì1909 followed by an MS in agriculture in 1915. He received a Ph.D. from Cornell University in 1925. He worked in the Department of Agriculture in Texas before moving to Puerto Rico and working with the Sugar Producers Association for two years from 1910 and then at the experimental station at Rio Pedras from 1914. He moved around the Caribbean region, working in Peru, Haiti and the Dominican Republic over the next decade. He specialized in the pests of sugarcane and their management using parasitoids. He published a series on the insects of Puerto Rico and wrote on economic entomology in the West Indies. Wolcott married Magdalen Hall in 1919 and they had three children.

(1994). The infrageneric classification of Eragrostis (Poaceae). Taxon, 383-422. The genus was first described by Nathanael Matthaeus von Wolf in 1776 and currently has approximately 350 species. Eragrostis setifolia was classified as a species by Nees in 1843.Hooker, W. J. (Ed.). (1843). Hooker's journal of botany and Kew Garden miscellany (Vol. 1). Reeve, Benham and Reeve.  Description  Eragrostis setifolia is an erect perennial tussock forming grass.Lazarides, M. (1997). A revision of Eragrostis (Eragrostideae, Eleusininae, Poaceae) in Australia. Australian Systematic Botany, 10(1), 77-187. It may reach a height of , however it is most commonly between 10‚Äì50 cm tall. The species has a poorly developed rhizome and produces a compact tussock. The morphology of the cataphylls can vary from hairless to bearing hair like projections. Cataphylls are often either shiny or leathery and may be oval shaped or tapered. The leaves are generally rough and glabrous. The culms are wrapped in broad sheaths. Leaves are generally about 4‚Äì13 cm in length, rolled and taper to point. The flowers of this grass are dense and pointed. They are approximately 3‚Äì12 cm in length and reach a width of 1.5‚Äì3 cm. The flowers range from pale to light purple in colour and are attached via short branches up to 3 cm in length. The grass produces 10-50 spikelets with a pale to slightly purple shade. Spikelets reach approximately 2 cm in length and 1.5 cm in width. Seeds are small only reaching 0.08 mg in mass.Silcock, R. G., Williams, L. M., & Smith, F. (1990). Quality and storage characteristics of the seeds of important native pasture species in south-west Queensland. The Rangeland Journal, 12(1), 14-20.  Distribution  Eragrostis setifolia is an Australian native common throughout the semi-arid interior of Australia. It is found in all mainland Australian states with the highest density in western New South Wales, South Australia and the Northern Territory. It tends to be most commonly associated with semi-arid woodlands and shrub-lands including Coolibah and black box woodlands and salt bush communities. This grass is also a common component of native grasslands including Mitchell grasslands.Davidson, D. (1954). The Mitchell grass association of the Longreach district. Eragrostis setifolia is most abundant in relatively moist refuges within its habitat range.Brandle, R., Moseby, K. E., & Adams, M. (1999). The distribution, habitat requirements and conservation status of the plains rat, Pseudomys australis (Rodentia: Muridae). Wildlife Research, 26(4), 463-477. It tends to be associated with low lying areas.Newsome, A. E. (1965). The abundance of red kangaroos, Megaleia rufa (Desmarest), in central Australia. Australian Journal of Zoology, 13(2), 269-288. The most favourable habitat for Eragrostis setifolia is land that is subject to periodic inundation such as gilgais and floodplains. This grass is most abundant in clay dominated soils ranging from red, brown, grey or black clay. The affinity to clay soils is due to the high water holding capacity of these soils. It is less common in sandy areas however it may also inhabit sandy/loam environments that are subject to flooding (e.g. near flood plains or water courses). It is occasionally found on found in saline or calcareous soils. Eragrostis setifolia is tolerant or even favoured by infertile soils.Friedel, M. H., Cellier, K. M., & Nicolson, K. P. (1980). Nutrient deficiencies in central Australian semi-desert rangelands, with reference to decline in range condition. The Rangeland Journal, 2(2), 151-161.  Ecology and uses  Eragrostis setifolia is a summer growing (C4) grass. It is capable of year round flowering and seed set. It tends to respond positively to rainfall events with growth, germination and flowering coinciding with rainfall and water availability.Grice, A. C., Bowman, A., & Toole, I. (1995). Effects of temperature and age on the germination of naked caryopses of indigenous grasses of western New South Wales. The Rangeland Journal, 17(2), 128-137. Germination is highly dependent on rainfall and is severely depauparate in the absence of moisture. It is quite drought tolerant and tends to die back during severe water shortages only to re-sprout again in periods of rain. The grass also appears to readily colonise burnt areas such as burnt spinifex grasslands.Morton, S. R., Masters, P., & Hobbs, T. J. (1993). Estimates of abundance of burrowing frogs in spinifex grasslands of the Tanami Desert, Northern Territory. Beagle: Records of the Museums and Art Galleries of the Northern Territory, The, 10, 67. It is commonly grazed by native herbivores such as macro pods, the red kangaroo in particular preferably grazes it.Norbury, G. L., Norbury, D. C., & Hacker, R. B. (1993). Impact of Red Kangaroos on the Pasture Layer in the Western Australian Arid Zone. The Rangeland Journal, 15(1), 12-23. Its main use for humans is its value for livestock grazing. Eragrostis setifolia is relatively resilient and productive and thus it is often considered a useful fodder plant. It is tolerant to grazing when compared to other native grasses (such as Mitchell grass) and can withstand grazing pressure that would lead to the elimination of other native grasses.Friedel, M. H. (1997). Discontinuous change in arid woodland and grassland vegetation along gradients of cattle grazing in central Australia. Journal of Arid Environments, 37(1), 145-164. In addition to being consumed by native wildlife it provides important habitat for native species such as the plains rat (Pseudomys australis).

Per its nomination: \\"The Central Receiving Building is one of three buildings on the campus of NMSVH constructed in the Decorative Brick style between 1930 and 1938. Not found on other New Mexico campuses, this style had been employed in 1930 by George Williamson for the nominated Auditorium and Recreation building. As used on this campus the style is closely related to the Mediterranean-style designs of Trost and Trost exemplified by the nominated Administration building, and represents a continuation of Williamson's interpretation of the pattern set for the campus by Trost. Like the 1936 Infirmary, this building represents a continuity of architects in that both Brittelle and Ginner worked for Williamson, and Brittelle had been in business with Trost. The building originally housed a swimming pool which may have been the first indoor pool in New Mexico.\\" With References Category:National Register of Historic Places in Otero County, New Mexico Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1933 ","title":"Central Receiving Building"},{"id":"61194325","text":"Staroilikovo () is a rural locality (a selo) and the administrative center of Ilikovsky Selsoviet, Blagoveshchensky District, Bashkortostan, Russia.

The number of royal guards varied between 60 and 200, at times may have reached 300.  Inspection ceremony  The monarch held random inspections of the royal guards, with the tolling of the Cheobjong bell, which notified the guards that the king was approaching Gwanghwamun Gate. The bell could be heard in central Seoul, as well. The guards had to line up in formation and display their combat skills and tactical skills, according to the Owijinbeob (Ïò§ÏúÑÏßÑÎ≤ï), which was a contemporary document recording various movements and strategies, considered to be the most modern at the time. The royal guards had to defend the east side of the field (the king's left side), during a mock battle with the Gyeomsabok (Í≤∏ÏÇ¨Î≥µ) cavalry units, who would attack from the right (west) side. At the end of the inspection the king would display his displeasure or satisfaction with the skills and performance of the Naegeumwi.  Re- enactments  The royal guard system was dissolved in 1910. In modern days, re-enactments of the royal guards' inspection ceremony are performed for tourists at the Gyeongbokgung Palace during high season.

As of July 2019 it has one of the highest Earth Similarity Index scores, with a score of 0.93. Together with Teegarden's Star c, GJ 1061 c, d, Luyten b and Tau Ceti e, it is the fourth- closest potentially habitable exoplanet as of April 2020.  Discovery  In July 2019, a team of more than 150 scientists led by Mathias Zechmeister published a peer-reviewed article in Astronomy & Astrophysics as part of the CARMENES survey supporting the existence of two candidate exoplanets orbiting Teegarden's Star. Because of the alignment and faintness of Teegarden's Star, Doppler spectroscopy (also known as the radial velocity method) was necessary to detect possible exoplanets. This method detects exoplanets indirectly by observing their effects on a host star's radial velocity, the speed at which it is moving towards or away from the Earth. These radial velocity anomalies in turn produce doppler shifts observable with a spectrograph-equipped telescope of sufficient power. To accomplish this, the team used the CARMENES instrument on the 3.5-meter telescope of Spain's Calar Alto Observatory. After three years of observation, two periodic radial velocity signals emerged: one at 4.91 days (Teegarden's Star b) and another at 11.41 days (Teegarden's Star c).  Characteristics  Teegarden's Star b is the innermost known planet orbiting Teegarden's Star, with an orbital period of just 4.91 days. The planet's minimum mass is 1.05 Earth masses (); this value would be the true mass if the planet's orbit is not inclined from the Earth's perspective. Because of this, Teegarden's Star b is likely to be rocky. Teegarden's Star b may even have an ocean of water on its surface.  Habitability  Ross 128, an example of quiet red dwarf that can support habitable planet, like Teegarden's Star. Kepler-438, an example for active red dwarf with powerful flares that can strip the atmosphere of planet, making it uninhabitable. Teegarden's Star b orbits within the optimistic habitable zone of its host star. This means it is possible that its atmospheric composition could allow for stable liquid water on its surface. Another factor for Teegarden's Star b's potential habitability is its host star. Most red dwarfs emit powerful flares, which can strip the atmospheres off their planets and cause them to be uninhabitable. A good example is Kepler-438b, which has an ESI score of 0.88, but because of its active star it is likely uninhabitable, and another example is Proxima Centauri, the closest star to us. However, Teegarden's Star is relatively inactive and quiet, increasing the chance that Teegarden's Star b may be habitable. Another quiet red dwarf with a potentially habitable exoplanet is Luyten's Star.  Host star  Teegarden‚Äôs Star is a low-mass red dwarf, with a mass of around 9 percent the mass of the Sun's, and with a temperature of around 2,900 Kelvin (2,623 ¬∞C or 4,760 F). The very low temperature and luminosity of Teegarden's Star explains why it was not discovered earlier, since it has an apparent magnitude of only 15.1 (and an absolute magnitude of 17.22). Like most red and brown dwarfs it emits most of its energy in the infrared spectrum. It is also older than the Sun, with age of 8 billion years. It was discovered in 2003. Astronomers had long thought it was likely that many undiscovered dwarf stars existed within 20 light-years of Earth, because stellar-population surveys show the count of known nearby dwarf stars to be lower than otherwise expected, and these stars are dim and easily overlooked. Teegarden's team thought that these dim stars might be found by data mining some of the huge optical sky survey data sets taken by various programs for other purposes in previous years. So they reexamined the NEAT asteroid tracking data set and found this star. The star was then located on photographic plates from the Palomar Sky Survey taken in 1951. This discovery is significant as the team did not have direct access to any telescopes and did not include professional astronomers at the time of the discovery. The parallax was initially measured as 0.43 ¬± 0.13 arcseconds. This would have placed its distance at only 7.50 light-years, making Teegarden's Star only the third star system in order of distance from the Sun, ranking between Barnard's Star and Wolf 359. However, even at that time the anomalously low luminosity (the absolute magnitude would have been 18.5) and high uncertainty in the parallax suggested that it was in fact somewhat farther away, still one of the Sun's nearest neighbors but not nearly as high in the ranking in order of distance. A more accurate parallax measurement of 0.2593 arcseconds was made by George Gatewood in 2009, yielding the now accepted distance of 12.578 light-years.

Designated as the \\"captain protector of the Indians of the Sierra Gorda,\\" Labra's \\"Manifest of the precedent in the conquest, pacification and reduction of the chichimecos jonaces Indians of the Sierra Gorda\\" described the Ximpece, Pame, and Chichimeca Jonaz as follows: \\"The Ximpeces... of so docile nature that there is no tradition that persuades its conquest... the Pames are similar to the Ximpeces and more applied to the work and commerce with the Spanish and opposed to the Jonaces... the untameable rebellious Jonaces...\\" The Ximpece inhabited the Sierra Gorda up until the nineteenth century. They were known for their fierce distrust of the Spanish and \\"entered the [Mexican] Independence period with substantial confidence and solidarity\\" with the other Indigenous groups who lived in the Sierra Gorda, namely the Pame and Jonaz. As \\"merchants, miners, and hacendados,\\" who were \\"lured to the region by commercial investments\\" increasingly encroached upon the remaining territory they had managed to hold onto after centuries of colonization, an internal conflict among these groups \\"escalated into a race war.\\" In August 1847, Francisco Chaire \\"deserted his Guanajuato army post and returned to his Sierran village of Xich√∫.\\" As a result, he was arrested by the mayor, who disliked the Chaire family. However, Francisco was freed shortly after by his brother, and assisted by Eleuterio Quir√≥s, a family servant. The mayor \\"called in the army to track down the escapee and his accomplices.\\" The Chaire family surrendered and were pardoned. However, Quir√≥s was determined to continue resisting, the reasons for which are unclear. Quir√≥s had soon \\"ignited a caste war\\" and quickly gained support among the poor in the region by promising \\"no more government interference in Sierran affairs,\\" as well as land distribution, guaranteed employment, and \\"the termination of Church intrusions.\\" The rebellion was \\"brushed off\\" as \\"socialist,\\" which was \\"used as a catchword by outsiders to characterize Indian anger and unity.\\" However, the white population and \\"even many mestizos\\" quickly became deeply worried \\"about the possibility of a combined effort by the Indians to expel them from the country.\\" Quir√≥s' rebels \\"ravaged the Sierra well into 1849.\\" Many whites were driven from the region in the period, while others fled. Army battalions were called in and ordered by General Anastasio Bustamante, \\"but it took a native son of the Sierra, General Tom√°s Mej√≠a to track down Quir√≥s and in December 1849 to certify his execution.\\" Although further solutions ranged from complete extermination to land distribution, a compromise was eventually reached, which guaranteed the Indigenous people \\"some land to farm, considerable tax relief, and a promise that they would not be force-drafted into the army.\\" Additionally, \\"the federal government founded three colonies for the Indians and gave them provisions and cattle for subsistence there.\\" However, shortly after the French invaded Mexico, which drew the situation of the Ximpece and other Indigenous people in the region into complete disarray. General Mej√≠a \\"won the support of the Indians for the monarchists,\\" yet was executed along with emperor Maximilion I after the eventual retreat of the French, their defeat, and the consolidation of the military forces of the Mexican Republic. This left the Indigenous people in the Sierra Gorda entirely vulnerable, who \\"were enveloped, although not completely pacified, by the national economic development that followed.\\"  References  Category:Indigenous peoples in Mexico Category:Quer√©taro ","title":"Ximpece"},{"id":"61194758","text":"Rahardjo Prodjopradoto (August 10, 1921 - February 16, 1978) was a politician from the Golkar Party. He was the Vice Chairman of Golkar from 1971 until 1973, and later as the Secretary for Civil Servants of Golkar from 1973 until his death.  Early life  Prodjopradoto was born on 10 August 1921 in Danukusuman, Surakarta. Prodjopranoto went to the Hollands Indische School (HIS). After finishing his school, Prodjopradoto went to the Muhammadiyah Teacher's School for four years. During his time there, he often preaches to the masses.  Military career  His career in the military began since his youth. In 1946, he became the member of the division staff of the Senopati Surakarta as a Second Lieutenant.

There are three main approaches to diffuse optics namely continuous wave (CW), frequency domain (FD) and time- domain (TD). Biological tissue in the range of red to near-infrared wavelengths are transparent to light and can be used to probe deep layers of the tissue thus enabling various in vivo applications and clinical trials.  Physical concepts  In this approach, a narrow pulse of light (< 100 picoseconds) is injected into the medium. The injected photons undergo multiple scattering and absorption events and the scattered photons are then collected at a certain distance from the source and the photon arrival times are recorded. The photon arrival times are converted into the histogram of the distribution of time-of-flight (DTOF) of photons or temporal point spread function. This DTOF is delayed, attenuated and broadened with respect to the injected pulse. The two main phenomena affecting photon migration in diffusive media are absorption and scattering. Scattering is caused by microscopic refractive index changes due to the structure of the media. Absorption, on the other hand, is caused by a radiative or non-radiative transfer of light energy on interaction with absorption centers such as chromophores. Both absorption and scattering are described by coefficients \\\\mu_aand \\\\mu_s respectively. Multiple scattering events broaden the DTOF and the attenuation of a result of both absorption and scattering as they divert photons from the direction of the detector. Higher scattering leads to a more delayed and a broader DTOF and higher absorption reduces the amplitude and changes the slope of the tail of the DTOF. Since absorption and scattering have different effects on the DTOF, they can be extracted independently while using a single source-detector separation. Moreover, the penetration depth in TD depends solely on the photon arrival times and is independent of the source-detector separation unlike in CW approach. Injected instrument response function and the reconstructed DTOF The theory of light propagation in diffusive media is usually dealt with using the framework of radiative transfer theory under the multiple scattering regime. It has been demonstrated that radiative transfer equation under the diffusion approximation yields sufficiently accurate solutions for practical applications. For example, it can be applied for the semi-infinite geometry or the infinite slab geometry, using proper boundary conditions. The system is considered as a homogeneous background and an inclusion is considered as an absorption or scattering perturbation. The time-resolved reflectance curve at a point \\\\rho from the source for a semi-infinite geometry is given by R(\\\\rho, t)=k t^{-5 / 2} \\\\exp \\\\left(-\\\\mu_{a} u t\\\\right) \\\\exp \\\\left(-\\\\frac{\\\\rho^{2}}{4 D u t}\\\\right) S\\\\left(D, s_{0}, t\\\\right) where D=\\\\frac{1}{3 \\\\mu_{s}^{\\\\prime}} is the diffusion coefficient, \\\\mu_{s}^{\\\\prime}=\\\\mu_{s}(1-g) is the reduced scattering coefficient and g is asymmetry factor, u is the photon velocity in the medium, S(D,s_0,t) takes into account the boundary conditions and k is a constant. The final DTOF is a convolution of the instrument response function (IRF) of the system with the theoretical reflectance curve. When applied to biological tissues estimation of \\\\mu_a and \\\\mu'_s allows us to then estimate the concentration of the various tissue constituents as well as provides information about blood oxygenation (oxy and deoxy-hemoglobin) as well as saturation and total blood volume. These can then be used as biomarkers for detecting various pathologies.  Instrumentation  Instrumentation in time-domain diffuse optics consists of three fundamental components namely, a pulsed laser source, a single photon detector and a timing electronics. = Sources = Time-domain diffuse optical sources must have the following characteristics; emission wavelength in the optical window i.e. between 650 and 1350 nanometre (nm); a narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM), ideally a delta function; high repetition rate (>20 MHz) and finally, sufficient laser power (>1 mW) to achieve good signal to noise ratio. In the past bulky tunable Ti:sapphire Lasers were used. They provided a wide wavelength range of 400 nm, a narrow FWHM (< 1 ps) high average power (up to 1W) and high repetition (up to 100 MHz) frequency. However, they are bulky, expensive and take a long time for wavelength swapping. In recent years, pulsed fiber lasers based on super continuum generation have emerged. They provide a wide spectral range (400 to 2000 ps), typical average power of 5 to 10 W, a FWHM of < 10ps and a repetition frequency of tens of MHz. However, they are generally quite expensive and lack stability in super continuum generation and hence, have been limited in there use. The most wide spread sources are the pulsed diode lasers. They have a FWHM of around 100 ps and repetition frequency of up to 100 MHz and an average power of about a few milliwatts. Even though they lack tunability, their low cost and compactness allows for multiple modules to be used in a single system. = Detectors = Silicon photomultiplier Single photon detector used in time-domain diffuse optics require not only a high photon detection efficiency in the wavelength range of optical window, but also a large active area as well as large numerical aperture (N.A.) to maximize the overall light collection efficiency. They also require narrow timing response and a low noise background. Traditionally, fiber coupled photomultiplier tubes (PMT) have been the detector of choice for diffuse optical measurements, thanks mainly due to the large active area, low dark count and excellent timing resolution. However, they are intrinsically bulky, prone to electromagnetic disturbances and they have a quite limited spectral sensitivity. Moreover, they require a high biasing voltage and they are quite expensive. Single photon avalanche diodes have emerged as an alternative to PMTS. They are low cost, compact and can be placed in contact, while needing a much lower biasing voltage. Also, they offer a wider spectral sensitivity and they are more robust to bursts of light. However, they have a much lower active area and hence a lower photon collection efficiency and a larger dark count. Silicon photomultipliers (SiPM) are an arrays of SPADs with a global anode and a global cathode and hence have a larger active area while maintaining all the advantages offered by SPADs. However, they suffer from a larger dark count and a broader timing response. = Timing electronics = The timing electronics is needed to losslessly reconstruct the histogram of the distribution of time of flight of photons. This is done by using the technique of time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC), where the individual photon arrival times are marked with respect to a start/stop signal provided by the periodic laser cycle. These time-stamps can then be used to build up histograms of photon arrival times. The two main types of timing electronics are based on a combination of time-to-analog converter (TAC) and an analog-to-digital converter (ADC), and time-to-digital converter (TDC), respectively. In the first case, the difference between the start and the stop signal is converted into an analog voltage signal, which is then processed by the ADC. In the second method, the delay is directly converted into a digital signal. Systems based on ADCs generally have a better timing resolution and linearity while being expensive and the capability of being integrated. TDCs, on the other hand, can be integrated into a single chip and hence are better suited in multi-channel systems. However, they have a worse timing performance and can handle much lower sustained count-rates.  Applications  The usefulness of TD Diffuse optics lies in its ability to continually and noninvasive monitor optical properties of tissue. Making it a powerful diagnostic tool for long-term bedside monitoring in infants and adults alike. It has already been demonstrated that TD diffuse optics can be successfully applied to various biomedical applications such as cerebral monitoring, optical mammography, muscle monitoring, etc.  See also  * Near-infrared spectroscopy * Functional near-infrared spectroscopy * Diffuse optical imaging * Neuroimaging * Functional neuroimaging  References  Category:Neuroimaging Category:Optical imaging Category:Spectroscopy ","title":"Time-domain diffuse optics"},{"id":"61194774","text":"Vladislav Lyakh (; ; born 13 August 1999) is a Belarusian professional footballer.

The technique derives its sublayer‚Äêresolving properties from its parent technique SORS. The main difference between SORS and micro-SORS is the spatial resolution: while SORS is suited to the analysis of millimetric layers, micro-SORS is able to resolve thin, micrometric-scale layers. Similarly to SORS technique, micro- SORS is able to preferentially collect the Raman photons generated under the surface in turbid (diffusely scattering) media. In this way, it is possible to reconstruct the chemical makeup of micrometric multi-layered turbid system in a non destructive way. Micro-SORS is particularly useful when dealing with precious or unique objects as for Cultural Heritage field and Forensic Science or in biomedical applications, where a non-destructive molecular characterization constitute a great advantage. To date, micro-SORS has been mainly used to characterize biological materials such as bones, blood, and Cultural Heritage materials, especially paint stratigraphies. Other materials have been studied with this technique including polymers, industrial paper and wheat seeds. Micro-SORS was developed on a conventional micro-Raman instrument, and portable micro-SORS prototypes are currently under further optimization to enable in-situ measurements and avoid the need of sampling.  Working principle  In turbid media, the depth‚Äêresolving power of confocal Raman microscopy is restricted due to the optical proprieties of these materials. In such materials, Raman photons generated at different depths emerge on the surface after a certain number of scattering events. The Raman photons generated in the sub-surface emerge on the surface laterally compared to the incident light position, and this displacement is statistically proportional with the depth the Raman photon was generated at. Micro-SORS permits to preferentially collect these displaced photons coming from the sub- surface by enlarging (defocusing) or separating laser excitation and collection zones (Full micro-SORS).  Micro-SORS key-modalities  Micro-SORS key-modalities = Defocusing micro-SORS = Defocusing is the most basic variant of the technique and it does not provide a complete separation between excitation and collection zones, rendering this variant less effective. Nonetheless, defocused measurements have the great advantage to be easily performed with a conventional micro-Raman without any hardware nor software modifications. Defocusing consists in the enlargement of the excitation and the collection zones that is achieved by moving the microscope objective out of focus (Œîz movements) from the surface of the object or sample under analysis. The Œîz movements range goes typically from few tens to two millimeters, depending on the numbers and thicknesses of the materials. = Full micro-SORS = This more sophisticated micro-SORS variant provides a complete separation of laser excitation and collection zones (Œîx offset) that requires a hardware or a software modification to a conventional Raman microscope. The separation can be achieved by using an external probe or fibre optics to deliver the laser, by displacing the laser spot by moving the beam- steer alignment mirrors, by using a spatially resolved CCD, by using a digital micro-mirror device (DMD), by moving the tip of the Raman detection fibre to perform an off-confocal detection of the signal or by combining hyperspectral SORS and defocusing micro-SORS.. Full micro-SORS was proven to be more effective in terms of both penetration depth into the sample and relative enhancement of sublayer signal  Layers system reconstruction  Layers make- up reconstruction using defocusing.To reconstruct the micro-layer succession it is required to collect a conventional Raman spectrum and at least a one micro-SORS spectrum; the acquisition of several spectra at gradually increasing defocusing distances or spatial offsets is usually the best way to approach unknown materials. A comparison among the acquired spectra allows achieving the layers composition: in defocused of spatially offset spectra, the signals of the sub-surface layers appear or are intensified compared to the surface signal. Data treatment as spectra normalization or subtraction is commonly used to better visualize the layer sequence. The layers thickess can be estimated after calibration on a well characterized sample set with a known thickness.  Micro-SORS in art  Non-destructivity is a major goal for Conservation Scientist, due to the intrinsic value of Cultural Heritage objects. Micro-SORS was developed to address the need of a non-destructive analytical technique with high chemical specificity for the non-destructive analysis of thin painted layers. In painted artworks, the painted film is typically obtained superimposing turbid thin (micrometric-scale) pigmented layers, and their chemical characterization is essential to detect the presence of degradation products, to gain information about the artistic technique and for datation and authentication purposes. To date, Micro-SORS was successfully used to characterize the paint stratigraphy in polychrome sculptures, painted plasters., painted cards and contemporary street art mural paintings  References   See also  * Cultural Heritage * Conservation Science * Biomedicine * Forensic Scienze * Raman Spectroscopy Category:Raman spectroscopy Category:Microscopy ","title":"Micro-spatially offset Raman spectroscopy"},{"id":"61194780","text":"Eye Central Television (), or EYECTV, is a Taiwanese internet media which focuses of political satire.

Ansch√ºtz 1827 Fortner is a straight-pull action biathlon rifle designed by Peter Fortner junior and produced in cooperation with J. G. Ansch√ºtz. The rifle has been dominant in the sport of biathlon since the late 1980s, and is the current sport standard. It is estimated to be used by that 97% of biathlon competitors worldwide.Biathlon Rifles: A Very Specialized Firearm About 7000 had been manufactured by 2007.Ansch√ºtz Modell 1827 Fortner Sprint, Geradezugverschluss mit Mehrladevorrichtung  History  Ansch√ºtz has been producing biathlon rifles since 1976.Ansch√ºtz: Making of a Biathlon Rifle ‚Äì YouTube The design of the 1827 Fortner action dates back to 1984, when Peter Fortner was having beers with Peter Angerer from West Germany who recently had taken the individual biathlon gold at the 1984 Winter Olympics.Meet the entrepreneurs behind obscure Olympic gear Angerer expressed that he wanted a rifle which could match those used by Soviet and East German competitors. Fortner took the challenge and within a few months developed and patented what was to become known as the \\"Fortner action\\", with the 1827 Fortner introduced around 1984.This German invention is used in 95% of rifles in biathlon ‚Äî Quartz The Fortner action is produced by Fortner Waffen under licence from Ansch√ºtz, and are marketed as Ansch√ºtz rifles.

The straight-pull mechanism uses six ball bearings to lock the bolt.

It is of utmost importance for the shooter that the bullet leaves the barrel as fast as possible after shot release to reduce aiming mistakes.¬ª In order to prevent damage to the firing pin during dry fire, an optional firing pin buffer (also called \\"Dry Fire Donut\\") must be installed by the user.Inserting a Dry-fire Donut into an Anschutz Biathlon Rifle (YouTube) The barreled action is produced by Fortner Waffen, and has a length of 730 mm. Although having been produced for nearly 40 years, the barreled action has not changed very much. All accessories and other parts are compatible across all production years. For example, triggers from any production year are technically the same and compatible. The main improvement has been in the barrel, as some early models featured non-nitrated barrels, but these are rare to find. Barrels are not threaded but press-fitted to the receiver, and can be changed by a competent gunsmith. Like other high end .22 LR competition barrels from Ansch√ºtz, the muzzle is choked, presumably to achieve better performance in cold weather. The action has a safety catch located on the side of the receiver, with \\"S \\" indicating Sicherung (meansing \\"the safety\\" in German) and \\"F\\" indicating Feuer (meaning \\"fire\\" in German).Pilotprosjekt skyting Norges Skiskytterforbund ‚Äì Det frivillige Skyttervesen English translation: Safety catch on the biathlon rifle (Norwegian original: Sikringsfunksjon p√• et skiskyttergev√¶r) The factory stocks are produced by Ansch√ºtz, and the stock design has changed a bit during the years. The current Ansch√ºtz design has an adjustable cheek rest and length of pull so that it can be fitted to different athletes.

On her death, she donated her substantial gardens to the city of Honolulu, and they later became the Foster Botanical Garden.  Early life and background  Mary Foster in her youth Foster was born in 1844 and grew up in Nu‚Äòuanu on Oahu, Hawai‚Äòi, where she attended the Oahu Charity School. She was the eldest of the nine children of Rebecca Prever and John James Robinson. Her mother had French ancestry and Hawaiian ancestry that dates back to ali‚Äòi (chiefs) from Maui and Hawai‚Äòi Island. Her father was British and was the founder of a large shipbuilding company. Her brother was politician and businessman Mark P. Robinson. When she was 16 years old she married Thomas R. Foster, who worked for her father's business. In 1884 the couple bought William Hillebrand's property, which Foster later donated for public gardens, and began developing the plant collections. Five years later, in 1889, Foster's husband died, leaving her widowed and childless at the age of 45. In 1893 her good friend Queen Lili‚Äòuokalani was overthrown by American soldiers, and imprisoned at 'Iolani Palace. Foster was one of two people who were permitted to visit her during her imprisonment.  Career and later life  In March 1893, she was elected as an honorary president of Hui Aloha  ªƒÄina o Na Wahine (Hawaiian Women's Patriotic League) or Hui Aloha  ªƒÄina for Women. This patriotic group was founded shortly after its male counterpart the Hui Aloha  ªƒÄina for Men to oppose the overthrow and plans to annex the islands to the United States and to support the deposed queen. She resigned this position on April 17, 1893 after a dispute arose between two factions of the group over the wordings to the memorial seeking the restoration of the monarchy to be presented to the United States Commissioner James Henderson Blount sent by President Grover Cleveland to investigate the overthrow. Later the same year, she met Anagarika Dharmapala, a Sri Lankan Buddhist and activist who was travelling back to Sri Lanka from the United States. He hoped that she would support his fundraising efforts to return the Mahabodhi Temple in Bodh Gaya, India, where the Buddha is believed to have gained enlightenment, to Buddhist ownership. At their initial meeting, Foster shared her grief over her husband's death, and her anger and pain at the treatment of her friend Queen Lili‚Äòuokalani; in response, Dharmapala taught her the principles of Buddhist meditation and began a lifelong interest in Buddhism for Foster. Over the next 40 years, Foster donated significant amounts of money to Dharmapala's Mahabodhi Society, which was used to support Sri Lankans in need as well as to negotiate for the ownership of Mahabodhi Temple. One of her projects, the Foster-Robinson Hospital for the Poor, is still part of the National Hospital of Sri Lanka in Colombo. In Hawai‚Äòi Foster was also a generous benefactor. She donated land along Pali Highway for the building of the Honpa Hongwanji Mission, the first Buddhist temple in Honolulu. She also supported Hongwanji High School, funded scholarships at Kamehameha Schools, purchased beds at Kap‚Äòiolani Hospital for indigent patients, and acquired land that would otherwise have been purchased by foreign investors, enabling native Hawaiians to live there. Foster died on December 30, 1930 and bequeathed her gardens and home to the city of Honolulu as a public garden, which later became the Foster Botanical Garden.  Legacy  Apart from Foster Botanical Garden in Honolulu and the Foster Robinson Free Ayurvedic Clinic in Narahenpita, Foster Lane, in Colombo 7, commemorates her. The Anagarika Dharmapala Trust celebrates her birthday every year, in accordance with Dharmapala's will.

His election was however refuted by the incumbent president Kenneth Gimugu who petitioned the high court to nullify Muhangi's election. High Court judge Lady Justice Lydia Mugambe ruled in favour of Moses Muhangi on the 2nd of March 2018. His presidency still faced rejection from boxing clubs like Mutajjazi Boxing Club, a club that had endorsed him for the position. In his first months in office, Muhangi introduced a five-point program (Accountability, Structures, Transparency, Discipline, Exchange programs) that changed the federation. The federation saw an increase in the registered number of boxers from 110 to 481 and schools contesting for boxing championships increased from 10 to 27. Muhangi petitioned the Minister of Education and Sports seeking fair distribution of sports budget funds for 2019 - 2010 financial year. FUFA had been allocated Shs10bn of the Shs17.4bn sports budget, leaving the rest of the federations to share only Shs4bn while Shs3bn went to the National Council of Sports.

Goytepe is affiliated with the Shomutepe culture and it is the largest settlement of the early period of Neolithic era in the South Caucasus.  Geographical location  310x310px Goytepe is located in Ganja-Gazakh region of Azerbaijan, 10 km east of Tovuz city, 2 km from the village of A≈üaƒüƒ± Qu≈ü√ßu, on the right bank along the middle reaches of Kura river, western terrace of the Zayam valley. The dune of Goytepe covers more than 2 ha, an altitude of 420 m and a diameter of nearly 145 m.  History  Goytepe approximately dates back to the 6th millennium cal. BC. is one of the largest settlement sites of the Shomutepe culture. Goytepe started to be investigated thoroughly in 2006, after 4 decades of its initial documentation by archaeologist Ideal Narimanov. An Azerbaijani-French joint mission conducted this investigation in 2006. A topographic map of the mound was made and a few samples of charcoal were taken for determining the age of the site. In 2008, the experts from the Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography of Azerbaijan headed by Farhad Guliyev, and the Japanese archaeologists from the University of Tokyo led by Yoshihiro Nishiaki explored this site more extensively in 2009. The presentation of the archaeological complex was held at Tokyo University in 2009, at the College- de-France educational institution in Paris and at the British Museum in London in 2010, as well as, at the Archaeology Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences and at the National History Museum of Georgia in 2011. President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev signed an order dated April 18, 2012 on creation of ‚ÄúGoytepe Archaeology Park‚Äù for the purpose of thorough study of this monument. On April 18, 2012, according to the order of the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev, Goytepe Archaeological Park was established. 300,000 AZN from the Reserve Fund of the President of Azerbaijan was allocated to the National Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan for the establishment of the Archaeological Park.  Stratigraphy and dating  307x307px The area of 300 sq.m. with a depth of 3-4 meters in Goytepe was studied after it was cleared from soil. The excavation area was divided into squares (numbered with numerical numbers ‚Äì 1, 2, 3 ...) using a 10x10 grid system from the datum point to the north and to the east (labelled by letters ‚Äì A, B, C ...). In order to ease stratigraphic reading, each square was then divided into 2 parts ‚Äì west (I) and east (II). 4 squares on top of the mound (1A, 2A, 1B and 2B) were investigated by the Azerbaijani experts, whilst a sub-square (4BII) at the northern part of the hill was excavated by Japanese mission. Moreover, stratigraphy of all the squares primarily conducted by the Japanese experts. The investigation of 1A, 2A, 1B and 2B squares in addition to 4BII sub-square approached a depth of presumably 3 m. Since 2008, eight radiocarbon C14 analyses (in French and Japanese labs) of coal residues taken from different squares of the excavation area have been carried out. Four of these analyses belonged to the top layers of the site. 2 group of ages were provided, each belonged to different squares, 5450-5350 cal. BC to squares 1A/B, 2A/B, and 5600-5500 cal. BC to 4BII. The other four analyses cover mainly the cultural layer at the 150-175 cm depth.  Architecture  11 m-thick Neolithic cultural sequence recovered in Goytepe consists of 14 architectural levels characterized by mudbrick houses in circular shape linked by curvilinear walls. Building techniques and distribution sequence of architectural remainders found from different levels were mainly similar to each other. Plano-convex-shaped mud bricks with straw temper measuring 40-60 x 20 x 8-10 cm made from yellow or brown clay were used as a building material. These constructions including the ones made of 15 rows of mud bricks with a height of 1.5 m. were considered well-preserved. 2 types of circular constructions have been discovered at it was in Shomutepe: large and small. The diameter of large circular constructions reached 3.5 m, while the smaller ones had a diameter up to 2 m. The smaller circular constructions used to generally connect with wing walls, although the larger ones were preferred to be mainly independent or not entirely enclosed. There were also revealed other structures such as ovens and bins. After examinations of these structures, it was affirmed that these units were built one by one in a sequential manner with a specific distribution pattern. The settlement featured circular or oval unit with a diameter of 7-8 m, including a number of round-shaped constructions connected with wing walls to surround a courtyard. There was a break on the enclosure wall for each unit which are assumed to be used as the entrance to the yard. Experts revealed clay bins and ovens/hearths mainly in the courtyard of the settlement close to the wing walls or circular constructions in the archaeological site. The bins with a diameter of 50-60 cm had a round or oval form with a height of 50 cm. The bottom of the bins was dug nearly 10-15 cm into the ground. During the excavations some of them discovered empty, while others were found with different tools and materials showing that they also had a storage function. The ovens with a diameter around 60-70 cm had also a round or oval shape, nevertheless, their bottoms were covered with river cobbles and enclosed by a clay rim. In Square 2B, there was also discovered a building in a rectangular form of 4x2.5 m. with a separating wall located quite far away from the circular buildings and assumed that it had been used for a different purpose.  Material Remains  Ceramic, basalt and obsidian, bone-based labour instruments (awls, needles, axes and hammers), pottery specimens, plant and animal remnants were found from the Neolithic cultural sequence. Tools and other objects were infrequently found in the interior parts of smaller circular constructions. In contrast, larger circular constructions and courtyard featured significant number of objects. Several practical tools, including large obsidian blades and large bone instruments were discovered here. 1525 pieces of ceramics were found during the research. = Pottery = Pottery samples were found at all layers. Vertical and incurved jars were mostly used, followed by bowls, small vessels without handles and deep bowls. Decorated pottery was hardly found; a few samples of them have simple relief decoration with some circles and oval knobs and wavy lines, while others which were revealed from the upper levels have a monochrome decoration around the neck. Mineral and plant tempered pottery were also found here; whereas, minerals, such as basalt and obsidian were generally used in plan-tempered pottery. Mineral-tempered pottery were found in less quantity from the upper layers. The use of mineral-temper in pottery is similar to the Shomutepe culture. = Stone artefacts = More than 5000 lithic artefacts found in this site have been investigated. Almost 70% of them were made of obsidian. Obsidian was mainly used for blade and blade-tools production. Obsidian artefacts were revealed as a stratified obsidian artefact assemblage (10 levels, 901 pieces) (8) and it is considered that obsidian was extracted from the Lesser Caucasus sources. Retouched blades and flakes were widely spread among the retouched tool collection. Other predominant tools were burins and splintered pieces which comprised nearly 30% of the whole retouched tools collection. (3) There have also been found denticules, sickle elements, notches and transverse arrowheads. Non-obsidian raw materials constituted locally available flint, tuff, andesite and mudstone. Flint tools were mainly made on ad-hoc flakes. They featured several glossed blades, which presented the glossed part distributed diagonally to the edge. There were also found ground stone tools that are considered to be common in this site. Ground slabs, mortars, pounding stones and hand stones were among them. These tools were used for food preparation, as well as, for pigment preparation. = Other tools = According to the excavations, it is also assumed that habitats of this site made bone and antler tools, as there were discovered a few samples. Short pointed awl, spatulas and knives are considered to be most common tools among this type. Axes, hammers, picks, and hoes were among the less common ones. Polished axe made of green stone, antler hammer with a smooth surface, wavy grooves and notches were discovered from this site. Polished axes, smooth surface hammers have similarities with the samples of Shomutepe culture. = Plant and animal remains = Domesticated plants, mainly wheat and barley were identified in the excavations. Wheat and barley samples found in Goytepe were beaten, charred and blended. Naked barley and free-threshing wheat are specific to Goytepe because these crops have been found rarely in the Neolithic sites of the Middle East such as in Syria and Turkey. Remains of domesticated goats, sheep and cattle were also found here.

Medical career Arneil joined the staff of Glasgow's Royal Hospital for Sick Children after graduating. He trained in paediatrics under the mentorship of James Holmes Hutchison, and was eventually appointed a consultant at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children. He quickly developed an interest in nephrology and in 1950 he established a paediatric renal unit at Royal Hospital for Sick Children. This was the first specialised unit for children's kidney disease in Britain, and one of the first in Europe. Arneil's unit pioneered the use of cortisone, prednisolone and thiazides in paediatric renal conditions as well as the use of peritoneal dialysis in children with acute kidney injury. Arneil's other major interests included sudden infant death syndrome (cot death) and rickets. A Scottish survey conducted by Arneil in 1981‚Äì82 first showed the risk of cot death associated with laying babies on their front, maternal smoking, and babies sleeping in the same bed as their parents. He is credited with the near-eradication of rickets from Glasgow, and when the disease began to reappear in Pakistani migrants he helped to create a successful educational cartoon dubbed into Hindi and Urdu. He also promoted the BCG vaccine in young children, which led to the disappearance of pre- school tuberculosis. Affiliations and memberships Arneil was a founding member of the European Society of Paediatric Nephrology in 1967. At the inaugural meeting of the American Society for Paediatric Nephrology in 1969, he was invited to present a guest lecture and was introduced as \\"the father of paediatric nephrology in Europe\\". He was also involved in the establishment of the International Paediatric Nephrology Association in 1974, serving as its secretary-general from its inception until 1983. Works With Edinburgh paediatrician John Forfar, he authored Forfar and Arneil's Textbook of Paediatrics, first published in 1973 and in its eighth edition at the time of Arneil's death. Awards and honors In 1983 he was awarded the St Mungo Prize, the highest civic award of the City of Glasgow.

This type of contract requires a full and complete set of plans and specifications and includes all the indirect costs plus the profit and the contractor will receive progress payments each month minus retention. The flexibility of this contract is very minimal and changes in design or deviation from the original plans would require a change order paid by the owner. In this contract the payment is made according to the percentage of work completed. The lump sum contract is different from guaranteed maximum price in a sense that the contractor is responsible for additional costs beyond the agreed price, however, if the final price is less that the agreed price then the contractor will gain and benefit from the savings. There are some factors that make for a successful execution of a lump sum contract on a project such as experience and confidence, management skills, communication skills, having a clear work plan, proper list of deliverables, contingency, and dividing the responsibility among the project team. According to Associated General Contractors of America (AGC), ‚ÄúIn a lump sum contract, the owner has essentially assigned all the risk to the contractor, who in turn can be expected to ask for a higher markup in order to take care of unforeseen contingencies. A Contractor under a lump sum agreement will be responsible for the proper job execution and will provide its own means and methods to complete the work.‚Äù In lump sum Contracts or fixed-price contracts, the contractor is evaluating the value of work as per the documents available. Mainly these documents can be specifications and the drawings. In pre-tender stage Contractor evaluates the cost to execute the project (based on the above documents such as drawings, specifications, schedules, tender instruction and the clarification received for the raised queries). And the contrast to these documents Contractor is evaluating and agreeing with the owner (or employer) to complete the works without exceeding the agreed lump sum amount.  Advantages  * The owner's risk is reduced due to the price of the contract being fixed and variations are not as much like other contracts. * There are less change orders and they are reduced. * The bidding and contractor selection is less complicated. * Obtaining construction loans are easier with this type of contract. * The profit margins and percentages are greater for engineers and contractors. * Payments and installments are made on regular basis which provides the contractor with a reliable cash flow. * Management of the contract is a lot easier for the owner. * It create an improved communication and relationship between the design team, contractor, and the owner.  Disadvantages  * There is a higher risk for the contractor. * Proper change order documentation is required which could be time-consuming. * Higher fixed price due to unforeseen conditions. * The contractor selection usually takes longer. * The design has to be completed before the start of activities. * Change orders could be rejected by the owner. * It increases the adversarial relationship among the stakeholders of the project. * The contractor has a freedom to choose its own methods.  Disputes in Lump sum contracts  Lump sum contracts are suitable for small projects, however, there are some potential causes that could result in disputes between the client and the contractors. Some of these disputes could be due to unbalanced bids, change orders, design changes, and compensation for early completion.  Variations in Lump sum contracts  Variations occur due to fluctuation in prices and inflation, provisional items, statutory fees, relevant events such as failure of the owner to deliver goods, etc. Variations are typically broken down into two categories: beneficial and detrimental where the former is for improvement of work quality, cost and schedule reduction, and the latter is a negative change in performance or quality of work due to client's financial difficulties. There are many reasons for variations to occur but main causes are normally due to omission in design, inadequate design, changes in specifications and scope, and lack of coordination and communication among the stakeholders.

Lying immediately to the west of the city centre, it has played an important role in the city's history, but is now known for its high levels of pollution. Local tradition states that the first settlement in the area was established by the Onamrokor We hunters, on the east bank of the lagoon. The lagoon was believed to be inhabited by a spirit, who used its powers to enchant a woman named Dede, and used her to convince the group to settle in the location, in order to worship the spirit. The land became the property of the Korle We, and it was a matter of dispute whether this was the same group as the Onamorokor We. The settlement grew into Jamestown, now the western part of the city centre, and was an important source of fish until the 1950s. In 1961, the Government of Ghana assumed ownership of the lagoon. It dredged the water body and raised the level of some nearby land, to reduce the risk of flooding, then established industries on surrounding drained and reclaimed land - initially brewing and food processing, later car repairs and then electronic scrap processing at Agbogbloshie. The lagoon links to the Gulf of Guinea. It was fed by the Odaw River, which flows through the suburbs of Accra, its catchment area covering 60% of the city. The most important destination of stormwater runoff, the river also became highly polluted with waste, which was discharged into the lagoon. The combination of waste from the Odaw River and industries and settlements on the shores of the lagoon led, by 2002, to it being described as \\"one of the most polluted water bodies on earth\\". At times of heavy rainfall, it was also flooding nearby areas. In the 1990s, the government established the Korle Lagoon Ecological Restoration Project, aiming to restore the lagoon to a more natural state, reduce pollution, and increase water flow through it. Around this time, the unplanned settlement of Old Fadama was established on the banks of the lagoon, its population peaking at around 30,000. The government announced its intention to clear the area, which it believed was a source of pollution, but following protests, this did not take place. In 2007, Odaw River was diverted, it outflow now desilted, then passed directly into the gulf, through a kilometre-long outfall.

An inside midfielder with goalkicking ability, he spent his early career with Geelong's Victorian Football League (VFL) affiliate. After being overlooked in two AFL drafts, he was selected by Geelong with pick 11 in the 2019 rookie draft and made his debut in the opening round of the 2019 season.  Early career  Atkins began playing in the VFL with Geelong in 2014. He spent his first year on the club's development list before playing VFL matches under the 23rd-player rule (which permitted teams to be expanded to allow players recently listed with a TAC Cup club to play with its VFL affiliate). In 2015, Atkins played for St Joseph's in the Geelong Football League, assisting in their first premiership victory since 1989. In the VFL, he played only ten games from 2014 to 2015, but became an important inside midfielder for Geelong in 2016 after others left the club or were injured. Atkins kicked 15 goals and averaged eight tackles, 18 disposals and four clearances per match, winning Geelong's best and fairest with 389 votes. He was also named in the VFL team of the year in the forward pocket and was considered by Fox Sports one of 15 VFL prospects likely to be selected in the 2016 AFL draft. Atkins' strong season attracted interest from interstate clubs but he stayed with Geelong. In 2017, Atkins was Geelong's co- captain and became a permanent midfielder, but his season was interrupted by a hamstring injury causing him to miss six games. When uninjured he was still regularly named among Geelong's best and in round 18 laid 23 tackles against Collingwood, including 12 in the last quarter ‚Äì the equal-most in a VFL match and the equal-second-most recorded by Champion Data in any competition. Atkins also kicked two goals and amassed 25 disposals to perform best on ground. He was again named, this time by ESPN, as a strong mature-age player likely to be drafted. Atkins again missed out on selection in the 2017 draft, but was encouraged by Geelong's head of football Simon Lloyd to continue pushing for an AFL career. He played every game in the 2018 VFL season, with career-high averages of 21.8 disposals and 9.4 tackles. Atkins was among the VFL's top ten players in score assists, handballs, contested possessions, clearances and hard ball gets. He led the competition in tackles, recording 188, and captained the VFL team of the year as a rover. Atkins won his second Geelong best and fairest with 413 votes. He was named by AFL.com.au as among the best mature-age players ahead of the 2018 draft.  AFL career  Atkins was selected by Geelong with pick 11 in the 2019 AFL rookie draft and cited as \\"another graduate of the Geelong VFL production line\\" alongside other AFL- listed players such as Tom Stewart, Scott Thompson and Shane Mumford. He anticipated playing primarily as a small forward rather than an inside midfielder as he had done in the VFL, due to Geelong's abundance of high- quality midfielders. Atkins made his debut in the opening round of the 2019 season against at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.

The mechanism uses 6 ball bearings around the circumference of the bolt head as locking elements. When the bolt handle is pushed forward, it forces a central plunger down the interior of the bolt body, forcing the diameter ball bearings out to lock into negative shaped (concave) recesses in the receiver. The plunger retracts when the bolt handle is pulled back, allowing the locking bearing to retract into the bolt body so the bolt can open. Primary extraction is performed by retracting the bolt handle, which uses leverage from the opposite side of the bolt to swing the handle to the open position, giving a mechanical advantage.

Pais defended his design for a compact fusion reactor in the IEEE TPS journal to Tingley stating that the journals acceptance should \\"...speak volumes as to its importance and credibility - and should eliminate (or at least alleviate) all misconceptions you (or any other person) may have in regard to the veracity (or possibility) of my advanced physics concepts\\". Pais detailed his discovery of the 'Pais effect' which comprises the \\"generation of extremely high electromagnetic energy fluxes (and hence high local energy densities) generated by controlled motion of electrically charged matter (from solid to plasma states) subjected to accelerated vibration and/or accelerated spin, via rapid acceleration transients\\". Pais added that manipulation of the Pais effect can \\"give rise to the Enablement of Macroscopic Quantum Coherence\\". His patent applications include: * An \\"electromagnetic field generator and method to generate an electromagnetic field\\" (2015), the principal stated application of which is to deflect asteroids that may hit the Earth.

Throughout her career, she worked hard to establish the legitimacy of Anglo-Norman literature as a subject of study, and her definitive work, Anglo-Norman Literature: A Guide to Texts and Manuscripts (1999) has won widespread praise for its substantial contribution to the study of literature.  Biography  Ruth Dean was born in New York City on March 10th 1902. She attended Wellesley College, graduating with a B.A. in 1922. She subsequently attended Saint Hugh's College, Oxford, earning a B.A. in 1924, an M.A. in 1928, and a D.Phil in 1938. During her time at Oxford, Dean had the opportunity to work alongside eminent medievalists: she was research assistant to the notable palaeographer E. A. Lowe, and moreover studied for her doctorate under Mildred Pope. It was also during this time that she met Dominica Legge, with whom she enjoyed a lifelong friendship until her death in 1986. After returning to America, Dean joined the faculty of Mount Holyoke College, where she served as a French language and literature professor until her retirement in 1967. She chaired her department from 1951 to 1954 and was named the Mary Lyon Professor in 1967. After her retirement, Dean taught at the University of Pennsylvania, where she chaired the Medieval Studies program. In 1973, she was elected president of the Medieval Academy of America. Ruth Dean died in 2003. Dean was at the Institute for Advanced Study for the academic years 1943‚Äì1944 and 1950‚Äì1951. She was a Guggenheim Fellow for the academic year 1948‚Äì1949.  Legacy  For much of her career, Dean was a passionate advocate for the study of Anglo Norman both as a body of literature and as a language. This can be seen particularly in her essay 'A Fair Field Needing Folk: Anglo-Norman', written in 1954, where she paints a picture of scholarly neglect of Anglo Norman as a field of study: 'Anglo- Normanists often feel that their subject has been treated in the world of research as stepchild, Cinderella, poor relation, even barbarian. In France, the descendants of its paternity consider it, at its best, an ornament or even a chapter of French literature, and compliment it on contributing joy, light, and color to the gloomy Anglo-Saxon scene; the more it takes on local characteristics the less attention the French pay to it' Ruth J. Dean, 'A Fair Field Needing Folk: Anglo-Norman', PMLA, Vol. 69, No. 4 (Sep., 1954), pp. 965-978 (p.965) Dean finished her manifesto with these words: 'A definitive study of Anglo-Norman language, literature, and ideas in western culture is still some way off. Here is a field for many workers and a training-ground for rising scholars who should go on, from their philological, paleographical, and literary grounding, to make critical evaluations and eventually to compose the larger interpretations for non-specialists which are now recognized as part of the role of scholars.Ruth J. Dean, 'A Fair Field Needing Folk: Anglo-Norman', PMLA, Vol. 69, No. 4 (Sep., 1954), pp. 965-978 (p.978) Indeed, she made such a vast undertaking more feasible for many Anglo Norman scholars through her life's work, Anglo-Norman Literature: A Guide to Texts and Manuscripts, compiled with the collaboration of Maureen Boulton and published by the Anglo- Norman Text Society. Dean's Guide has been referred to as an 'indispensable catalogue of manuscripts of Anglo-Norman literary texts and manuscripts'. This work was based on an earlier survey of manuscripts undertaken by Johan Vising, a copy of which was given to Dean by a fellow medievalist during her years of study at Oxford.Anglo-Norman Literature: A Guide to Texts and Manuscripts, Anglo-Norman Text Society, 1999. p.vii Dean herself writes that with this volume in hand, she began to explore manuscripts, library catalogues, and bibliographies with a view to updating Vising's work. Dean's survey, which came to be known as the 'new Vising', attracted the attention of scholars on five continents, many of whom contributed to its growth and development.Anglo- Norman Literature: A Guide to Texts and Manuscripts, Anglo Norman Text Society Occasional Publications Series 3 by Ruth J. Dean and Maureen B. M. Boulton Review by: Tony Hunt, Medium √Üvum, Vol. 70, No. 2 (2001), pp. 340-343 This collaborative effort, coordinated by Dean, in actuality greatly surpassed the efforts of Vising. Anglo-Norman Literature: A Guide to Texts and Manuscripts catalogues close to 1,000 texts, over 500 more than are recorded in Vising, and the number of manuscripts in which they are found exceeds 1,100, whilst Vising only lists 419. The colossal advance to scholarship represented by the volume was awarded by the Prix Chav√©e by the Acad√©mie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres in 2001. Dean's Guide has been described as 'a substantial addition to knowledge [...] simply irreplaceable'. Elsewhere, the extraordinary effort behind Dean's scholarly contribution has also been highlighted: ‚ÄòIn another environment, this book might have issued from the collaborative work of a large industrious committee: it is in fact a testament to the life-long passion of a nonagenarian, a work that should take its rightful place as a monument of national culture [...] This is truly a monumentum aere perennius for Ruth J. Dean, who devoted more than seventy years to it before her death at the age of ninety-nine. It is also a monument to her surviving collaborator, Maureen B. Boulton, and a great gift to the rest of us.‚ÄôAnglo-Norman Literature: A Guide to Texts and Manuscripts by Ruth J.

He was a conservationist, environmental activist, fisherman, and homesteader based in New Mexico. Salmon was also a coursing sighthound breeder, trainer, and hunter. Biography M. H. Salmon was born in Syracuse, New York, on March 30, 1945. Salmon attended Nottingham High School in Syracuse, and The Winchendon School in Winchendon, Massachusetts. After a short stint at the University of Michigan, he transferred and graduated with a bachelor of arts degree in English and history from Trinity University in San Antonio in 1967. Salmon taught school in the San Antonio area from 1968‚Äì1971 before moving to Minnesota to become an outdoorsman and writer. Salmon moved to southwest New Mexico in 1981 and began his work to preserve the free-flowing Gila River. Salmon died on March 10, 2019 in Las Cruces, New Mexico. Salmon‚Äôs father, John Pomeroy Salmon, fought in World War II with Edson's Raiders in the South Pacific. His 4th great-grandfather was Moses Van Campen, a veteran of the American Revolution, who fought the Native Americans in the frontier of western Pennsylvania. His 2nd great-grandfather, John Niles Hubbard, wrote The Life and Times of Major Moses Van Campen about his grandfather, and Red Jacket and his People, 1750-1830, An Account of Sa-Go-Ye-Wat-Ha. Salmon‚Äôs 2nd great- aunt was Lucy Maynard Salmon, who established the History Department at Vassar College. Conservation and environmentalism In the spring of 1983, when the Gila River was in danger of being dammed, Salmon took a trip along the river where he was inspired to create what would later become his bestseller, Gila Descending. He co-founded the Gila Conservation Coalition in 1984 to protect the free flow of the Gila and San Francisco Rivers as well as the Gila and Aldo Leopold Wilderness areas. The Gila Conservation Coalition successfully lobbied against the Hooker and Conner dams and Mangas diversion in the 1980s and 1990s. It helped to close the San Francisco River to motorized vehicles and kept the East Fork of the Gila River closed to the same. Starting in 2001, Salmon opposed the diversion threat under the Arizona Water Settlements Act. In January 2020, New Mexico senators Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich introduced the M. H. Dutch Salmon Greater Gila River Wild and Scenic Act to protect The Gila River.  Affiliations  Salmon was a member of several commissions and boards throughout his life: * New Mexico Interstate Stream Commission, 1985-1987 * Founder and Chairman, Gila Conservation Coalition, 1984-2019 * Chairman, New Mexico Wilderness Coalition 1989-1995 * Board Member, Quivira Coalition 2000-2006 * Board Member, New Mexico Wildlife Federation 2005-2009 * Board Member, New Mexico Water Dialogue, 2007 * Board Member, Gila Resources Information Project 2004-2019 * Member, New Mexico State Game & Fish Commission, 2005-2011 Salmon received the Lifetime Conservation Award from the Gila Natural History Symposium in 2008. In 2009, he was awarded the Lifetime Conservation Award by the Gila Conservation Coalition. He received the Conservation Voters New Mexico‚Äôs Local Conservation Hero Award in 2013. In 2014, the New Mexico Community Foundation awarded Salmon the Luminaria Award.

She specialized in teaching the deaf-mute. She was the first woman to teach in Copenhagen's public schools. Biography =Denmark= Hedevig Sophie Rosing was born May 16, 1827, in Horsens, Denmark. Her parents were Ulrik Frederik Rosing (1776‚Äì1841), a priest, and Ursula Sophie Lasson (1786‚Äì1838). She grew up in Central Jutland, where she worked as a governess. In 1860, she became the first woman teacher in Copenhagen's public schools. =Norway= In 1865, Rosing traveled to Norway to visit family. On September 9, of that year, she married her cousin, the Norwegian agricultural school teacher, Anton Rosing (1828‚Äì67), and emigrated to Norway. Two years later, she became a widow. Having removed to Oslo after her husband's death, Rosing started teaching at an elementary school in 1868. In the capital city, she became acquainted with issues concerning women's equity and those that are important to teachers. There, she met Fredrik Glad Balchen, a pioneer in deaf-mute education, who had developed a method for teaching deaf people. In 1872, she became a teacher at Balchen's institute. During her time here, she made a plan to set up her own school for the deaf-mute using a \\"purer oral method\\". In the summer of 1880, with public scholarship funding, she visited several countries to study their teaching methods for the deaf, and, as the only representative from the Nordic countries, she attended the Second International Congress on Education of the Deaf. In 1881, she gave up on her plan to create a small family school, because she could not get state support for it subsequent to the passage of the Abnormal School Law of that year. But using a state subsidy, she founded Fru Rosing's Speech School for Deaf-Mute in 1881. Using the \\"pure speech method\\", it was first located in \\"Little Bloksbjerg\\", in Briskeby, Oslo, relocating three years later to \\"H√∏ien\\" at St. Hanshaugen. She managed it until 1895, when she retired with the largest pension (1200 SEK; 1200 DKK) that a woman was ever granted in Norway. She was a member (the only woman) of the school commission set up by Minister Johan Sverdrup that was to prepare the Folkeskole Act of 1889. Rosing published two collections of her late husband's documents, Ungdomstid og Reiseliv (1869) and Anton Rosings Alvorsliv (1871), as well as her father's account of his work as a priest in Great Britain with Danish-Norwegian prisoners of war during the period of 1807 till 1814. She also wrote a series of pieces about folk life and history. Two school books were very successful, Barnets f√∏rste bog (1879, and several editions thereafter) and Veiledning ved undervisning i samtidig l√¶sning og skrivning efter lyd- og stavemethoden (Guidance on Teaching in Simultaneous Reading and Writing according to the Sound and Spelling method). She wrote several papers on teaching deaf-mutes, as well as articles regarding children's education, school teachers, female education, and women in society. With Fredrikke Marie Qvam, Gina Krog, Aasta Hansteen, and others, Rosing was a leader in Norway's woman suffrage movement. In 1908, she was one of the Norwegian representatives who attended the Fourth Conference of the International Woman Suffrage Alliance in Amsterdam. Rosing was a member of the National Windmill Association, the Norwegian Association of Deaf Teachers, and The Deaf Association in Kristiania. She was a board member of the Oslo D√∏veforening until 1896. She died November 30, 1913, in Oslo, and is buried in that city's Cemetery of Our Saviour together with her spouse.

His mother came from a well-known family of painters and illuminators from Mechelen. Her sister Mayken Verhulst married Pieter Coecke van Aelst and became the mother-in-law of Pieter Bruegel the Elder. Julius Goltzius married in 1587 in Antwerp and probably died in that city well after 1601.

He was regularly hired as an engraver by publishers based in Antwerp or Cologne (mostly for exiled Flemish artists and publishers) working amongst others after the designs of Jean-Jacques Boissard, Abraham de Bruyn, Anthonie Blocklandt van Montfoort and Maerten de Vos. His engravings representing satirical peasant scenes are well known. Their German texts suggest that they were mainly intended for the German market. He later established himself as an independent publisher of prints.

During 1933-1936 he was president of the KF Tirana football association. Life Stefan Shundi was born in 1906 in Tirana (then part of the Ottoman Empire, now the capital of Albania). He pursued his secondary studies in Austria and then in Italy, where he graduated in law at the University of Milan. In 1929, Shundi was selected from the Albanian government of Zog I, along with other Albanian students, to participate, in an official ceremony to honor Lodewijk Thomson in the Netherlands. Thomson had been a Dutch military who died in Albania in 1914, while commanding the International Control Commission (Albania), as a unit of protection of a newly created Albania. After graduation in Italy, Shundi returned to Tirana to practice law, which he continued until his death in 1947. In 1927 Shundi was one of the founders of the football association KF Tirana, of which he continued to be a player until 1929 when he became the club's sports director. On 10 July 1930 he kept as a sports director the victory speech of the first football championship of Albania. From 1933 to 1936, he was the club's president. As a journalist, Shundi published (also with the pen names of Gjergj Kuka or Nichts) various articles in different organs of the 1930s and 1940s, such as \\"Minerva\\", \\"Arb√´nia\\", \\"Shk√´ndija\\", and \\"Leka.\\" ecc.) During 1941-1943 Shundi also contributed to the publication of the Drini magazine, a monthly periodical which promoted tourism in Albania. As a literary critic, he wrote (often with polemic tones), about the contemporary poetry of notable Albanian authors, such as Gjergj Fishta, Vin√ßens Prennushi, and Lasgush Poradeci. He well described Fishta's character through typical stories of the priest's life, which reveal his wit and good nature. Albeit eclectic, his critique is said to have been influenced by the Italian idealistic critique of Benedetto Croce. In 1937 Shundi published a drama with folklore themes, ‚ÄúKalor√´si i vdekjes ose Kostandini e Geruntina‚Äù (The death knight, or Konstandine and Geruntine). He has left three unpublished manuscripts: \\"Dy titan√´t ‚Äì Sk√´nderbeu e Moisi Golemi‚Äù (The two titans - Scanderbeg and Moisi Golemi), ‚ÄúVotra e gjyshit ‚Äì sh√´nime historike‚Äù (The grandfather's fireplace - historic notes), and the novel \\"Nan√´ moj‚Äù (O mother). Shundi, along with other writers in the 1930s, is deemed to have improved the quality of literature in the 1930s, by giving it a much more colorful expressiveness and making it more modern. Together with other literary critics of the time, such as Nebil √áika, Ernest Koliqi, Asim Jakova, and Tahir Gjinali, Shundi belonged to the \\"reactionary\\" current of the neo- Albanianism of philosopher Branko Merxhani. Shundi died in 1947 in mysterious circumstances. In recognition of his contributions as a literary critic and as former SK Tirana president, a street of Tirana bears his name.

Of the shorter pieces, four are original to the collection and three originally appeared in various anthologies. Contents *\\"Weird\\" (from Unconventional Fantasy: A Celebration of Forty Years of the World Fantasy Convention, Nov. 2014) - A young couple hiding in their apartment's bathroom from a monstrosity raging outside the building trade stories about the odd things in their lives over a picnic. *\\"Mer\\" - Concerning two witches, a fishing village, and the statue of a mermaid. *\\"The Gorgon in the Cupboard\\" (from To Weave a Web of Magic, Jul. 2004) - A frustrated artist appeals to his muse, whose response unleashes the power of Medusa. *\\"Which Witch\\" (from Under My Hat: Tales from the Cauldron, Aug. 2012) - Witch musicians combat a dark threat during a bar performance. *\\"Edith and Henry Go Motoring\\" - a toll bridge takes travelers on an unexpected journey. *\\"Alien\\" - a grandmother hangs out with aliens, to her family's incredulity. *Something Rich and Strange (Nov. 1994) - mortal lovers, seduced by undersea temptation, must decide if their relationship is worth fighting for. *\\"Writing High Fantasy\\" (from The Writer's Guide to Fantasy Literature, 2002) *\\"Dear Pat: Afterword\\" by Peter S.

His parents were George L. H. (POW Kolyma, Russia, 1940‚Äì42) and Rosalia (Lipka) B. (POW Kazakhstan, Russia, 1940‚Äì42); He married Janet Fullmer in 1965. They have two children: Peter C. and Jennifer L. Bajorek attended California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California, where he received a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in 1967, a Master of Science (M.S.), in electrical engineering (EE) in 1968; and a Ph.D. in electrical engineering in 1972 all from CalTech. He now resides in Los Gatos, California.Poles in America Foundation: Chris Bajorek  Career  Bajorek joined IBM Yorktown in 1971 becoming part of the research effort led by David Thompson and Lubomyr Romankiw studying readback devices based on magnetoresistance. Bajorek made numerous contributions.[R. L. Anderson, C. H. Bajorek, D. A. Thompson, ‚ÄúNumerical Analysis of a Magnetoresistive Transducer‚Äù, IEEE Trans.

In 1979, Bajorek took a one-year assignment in IBM's East Fishkill and contributed to the development of IBM's bipolar logic chip and multilayer ceramic packaging technologies used in the IBM 360 mainframes. Based on this experience, Bajorek established the Advanced Packaging Technology Laboratory (APTL) and was appointed its first director in 1980. This collaboration between East Fishkill and the Thomas J. Watson Research Center was IBM's second interdivisional lab. to be established. In 1981, Bajorek transferred from the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights, NY to the San Jose Research Center (now IBM Research ‚Äì Almaden) in California where he was appointed director of storage systems and technology. He also co-founded IBM's Magnetic Recording Institute (MRI) with Denis Mee. Mee was its first director and Bajorek became its second director in 1984 when he transferred to the IBM General Product Division (GPD). This was the third of IBM's interdivisional laboratories to be established. This time between GPD and the San Jose Research Center. The APTL and MRI collaborations were among the first of eventually 19 joint programs at IBM specifically instigated by Ralph Gomory and designed to bridge between the Research and the Development organizations.Computer History Museum, Oral History: Chris Bajorek and Dave Thompson In 1985, Bajorek was appointed laboratory director of technology development and manufacturing for GPD, San Jose, responsible for MRI as well as head and disk development and manufacturing. In this role, Bajorek directed the development of the first generation MR head for disk drives and the industry's first MR head-based disk drive, the Sawmill 5 ¬º in. drive, which shipped in 1990. Bajorek also contributed directly to the technology with innovations such as shunted soft adjacent layer (SAL)Bajorek et al., ‚ÄúA Permalloy Current Sensor‚Äù, IEEE Trans.

He was responsible for developing and manufacturing small form factor drive products as well as being responsible for developing technologies used by IBM Fujisawa, Japan and IBM Hursley, UK disk drives. Noteworthy were IBM's first thin-film disk used in the 5 ¬º in. Lee drive, shipped in 1988; the first PRML data channel designed for hard drives which was used in Hursley's 5 ¬º in.

In 1996, Bajorek retired from IBM and joined Komag, Inc.Komag, Inc., San Jose, CA in San Jose, California, as executive vice president of advanced technology.John Markov, \\"Advances Nip At Its Heels, But Disk Maker Moves Forward\\", New York Times, July 1, 2002 Bajorek retired from Komag in 2004. Since that time he has served as director of the International Disk Drive Equipment & Materials Association.International Disk Drive Equipment & Materials Association (IDEMA) He has also been an expert witness in several cases notably the patent infringement brought by Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) against Marvell Technologies that resulted in a $750 million settlement.Reuters: Marvell Technology to pay Carnegie-Mellon U. $750 million in patent disputeCarnegie Mellon University vs. Marvell Technology Group, Ltd. Bajorek is a member of the Storage Special Interest Group at the Computer History Museum, Mountain View, California.  Litigation with IBM  After Bajorek joined Komag, in a precedent-setting case, IBM attempted to clawback monies received by Bajorek from vesting stock options citing a non-compete clause signed by Bajorek. At issue were whether Komag was a competitor or supplier to IBM and whether the non-compete clause could be enforced under California State law. Bajorek won the Federal lower court case via a declaratory judgment in 1997. However, in 1999, this was overturned when IBM appealed to the Federal Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, CA. This led to a settlement between Komag and IBM and left the Ninth Circuit Court's Decision as precedent. Finally, however, in 2008, in a different case, California's Supreme Court specifically rejected the Ninth Circuit's IBM vs. Bajorek decision, viewing it as illegal under California law.Crowell & Moring LLP: Client Alert, August 11 2008US Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit: IBM Corp. vs. Bajorek, Sept. 14, 1999UCLA Law Review 51 UCLA LAW REVIEW 593 (2003) pages 601-606Fenwick and West LLP: Employment Law Alert: September 1, 2006  Awards and recognition  *1990: Bajorek became an IEEE Fellow \\"For leadership in the development and manufacture of magnetic data storage and high-speed computer switching devices\\". *2000: Bajorek received the IEEE Millenium MedalIEEE Magnetics Society Newsletter, August 2000: IEEE Millenium Medal for his \\"outstanding achievements and contributions\\". *2002: Bajorek received the IEEE Reynold B.

He was a lifelong resident of Jonesborough, Tennessee. The official historian of Washington County, he was a prime mover in the Historic Jonesborough restoration program. His research into the history of the Town and County has been included in numerous articles in publications of the Tennessee Historical Society, the East Tennessee Historical Society and elsewhere. He served as vice president of the Tennessee Historical Society, the Tennessee Archaeological Society and the Tennessee Folklore Society.He was married to Lena S. Fink, and had two daughters, Sara and Elizabeth. Paul Fink was honored in 1977 by the Appalachian Trail Conference as \\"the guiding influence\\" in establishing the Trail in Tennessee and North Carolina in the 1920s. Fink was inducted into the Appalachian Trail Hall of Fame in 2019. In 1922, only a year after Benton MacKaye's famous article proposing an Appalachian Trail was written, Fink began corresponding with hiking leaders in New England about building the Trail. When Myron Avery began planning the route of the Appalachian Trail in the south, Fink was the first person he contacted. Based on letters exchanged with Horace Kephart in 1919 and the early 1920s, Fink was also an early advocate for the creation of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, through which the Appalachian Trail travels along the Tennessee-North Carolina border. A book written by Paul Fink details many backpacking and camping trips he made into the Smokies and nearby mountain ranges, beginning in 1914 and continuing through the 1930s. Fink and his lifelong companion Walter Diehl were pioneers in backpacking in the rugged mountains of East Tennessee and Western North Carolina. Fink worked closely with David C. Chapman, Kephart, and others in promoting the Great Smokies as a national park in the early 1920s and continuing throughout the park movement. Working with George Masa and others, he was largely responsible for routing the Appalachian Trail through the Great Smokies and nearby mountain ranges. The initial proposal was to route the trail through Mt. Mitchell and the Black Mountains, staying entirely out of TN. Fink was an active leader in the Appalachian Trail Conference, serving on its Board from 1925 to 1949.

Schottm√ºller was most notable as a resistance fighter and for being an symbolically important member of a Berlin-based anti-fascist resistance group who she met through the sculptor Kurt Schumacher. The would later be named by the Gestapo as Die Rote Kapelle, the Red Orchestra. The author and researcher Geertje Andresen conducted an analysis of the estate of Schottm√ºller. This resulted in the publication of a book on Schottm√ºller's life, that brought her to the public's notice. It is Andresen's work that brings to light the futile and vindictive murder by the Nazi state of a German woman who was only tangentially linked to the Rote Kapelle and whose membership of the group constituted resistance. Life Schottm√ºller was the daughter of archivist Kurt Schottm√ºller and Dorothea Schottm√ºller, n√©e Stenzler. Schottm√ºller was the granddaughter of the historian Konrad Schottm√ºller and niece of art historian Frida Schottm√ºller. In 1906, Kurt Schottm√ºller moved his family to Danzig to work in the state archives. A year later, when Oda was two, Schottm√ºller's mother suffered a severe nervous ailment that meant she had to stay in a sanatorium for a substantial period to recover. Dorothea Schottm√ºller never returned until 1912 and instead of going home to Gda≈Ñsk she returned to her parental home in Berlin. This left Schottm√ºller to be brought up by her father in Gda≈Ñsk with constrained family income as he was paying his wife maintenance. In August 1919 Kurt Schottm√ºller, severely emaciated after the first world war, died when Oda was fourteen. Her aunt Professor Frida Schottm√ºller, who was a custodian at the Kaiser-Friedrich Museum and a specialist in quattrocento sculptor applied to be her guardian and being successful meant that Schottm√ºller had to move back to Berlin. She lived with her aunt until 1922. Perhaps due to the war and her bad family life Schottm√ºller was considered unstable and had a laissez-faire attitude to life and work that belied her age. Her guardian realised that spending any more time spent in the state school would have been a waste of time, so she asked Gerda Schottm√ºller, the aunt of Oda Schottm√ºller, who worked at the Odenwald school in Heppenheim to arrange an interview between the headmaster, Paul Geheeb and her to determine if Schottm√ºller could be admitted to the school. From 1922 to 1924 she attended the school to prepare for her Abitur. At Odenwald she met and became lifelong friends with Klaus Mann who would later become a well-known writer. Geheeb considered Schottm√ºller to be unstable during the whole period she attended Odenwald School but she still managed to pass her Abitur in 1924. Between 1924 and 1927 Schottm√ºller completed an arts and crafts education in goldsmithing, pottery and enamel in Pforzheim and Frankfurt. Her family would not support her in becoming a sculptor and dancer, something she had practised at the Odenwald School. When she was of legal age to decide her own future, which was in 1928, she began to study dance at the Berlin School of Modern Artistic Dance with the German dance teacher and choreographer Vera Skoronel who held her audition and the Swiss dance teacher Berthe Tr√ºmpy. At the dance studio she met Fritz Cremer the sculptor who acted as occasional headmaster for the school and who would later become part of the collegial discussion group that was led by Harro Schulze-Boysen. At the same time she began studying sculpture with Milly Steger at the Association of Berlin Artists. Career Oda Schottm√ºller masked in the alraune dance performance with the Mandrake mask, circa 1941 In 1931, after passing the physical fitness examination that consisted of physical education and gymnastics, she joined the Volksb√ºhne theatre as a dancer. At the same time, she had a sculpture studio in Berlin, in the same building as the studio of Johannes Itten. In the early 1930s, she began to design costumes and wooden masks in the studio to incorporate into her performances. Here she lived a life of artistic freedom, inspired life as an artist among artists. On 15 January 1933, Adolf Hitler became Chancellor of Germany and the fascists came to power in Germany. From September 1933, all dancers in Germany were informed that they were required to register with the Reich Chamber of Culture. From that point on, the type of expressive and experimental dance that Schottm√ºller performed in the Weimar Republic was to no longer show. Schottm√ºller chose not to register and never came of notice of the Ministry. Her first solo dance performance was organised in March 1934 at the theatre at Kurf√ºrstendamm. Her style of dance was eccentric, reflecting the expressionist dance or Ausdruckstanz of the 1920s and combining masks and costumes to suit the mood, transforming into mythological creatures. The names of the performances reflected the eccentric nature of the performances, with such names as Wizard, The Hanged, Strange Hour and Witch. Throughout the interwar period of the 1930s, Schottm√ºller received favourable press reviews. Her sculpture which followed the tenets of expressionism was also positively reviewed. Her sculpture the bronze dancer was reproduced in the German newspaper, the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung. In 1940 a reviewer called Nohara wrote highly of Schottm√ºller, commenting on the dual nature of her dance and sculpture that enabled her to modulate the body and, vice versa, shape her sculpture according to living rhythms and impulses. Only a few weeks before her arrest in 1940, a full page spread about Schottm√ºller's work appeared in the Die junge Dame (The Young Lady) magazine that was full of praise and noted that Schottm√ºller had went on an Army tour to cheer up the troops. In 1935, Schottm√ºller rented a studio on Charlottenburg's Reichsstrasse 106. During this period her dances continued to evolve. Instead of creatures from myth she changed to figures and the underlying structure and themes of her dance changed as well. The nomenclature of her dance names also changed and were now called, e.g. Erring Soul Angel of Outrage or Tragedy. These reflected how she felt about the social and political reality that she found herself in as the Nazi state advanced. In August 1936 she undertook her first group performance as a dancer in the 1936 Summer Olympics as part of the accompanying program of the Olympic Games. She danced in the movement choir for a performance of Heracles. This was a piece that had won the medal in a competition explicitly created for the games, in which 70000 people entered, to find a performance, song or composition fit for the Olympics. The performance was conducted by the Berlin Philharmonic in the 20000seater open-ait Dietrich Eckart theatre, now called the Waldb√ºhne. She was paid for this performance which gave her a veneer of National Socialist respectability. In October 1937, the Reich Chamber of Culture finally located Schottm√ºller and she was forced to complete an application and complete a course in German dance. She refused this, instead sending in reviews of her work to the Ministry which they seemed to accept. In February 1938 she was offered an opportunity to dance in the Volksb√ºhne theatre in the Hour of the Dance which was a performance to showcase young and new dancers performing the German Dance. To satisfy the Nazis she renamed her masks the German Suite and performance dances with names like e.g. Angel of Consolation and The Stranger. In the autumn of 1938, Schottm√ºller met the German composer Kurt Schwaen. Schwaen worked with Schottm√ºller to develop new dances in which he composed new music too. On 11 November 1941 Schottm√ºller gave her last public performance in a prestigious concert hall, Beethovensaal on K√∂thener Stra√üe that was formerly used by the Berlin Philharmonic orchestra until it was destroyed by British bombers on 30 January 1944.Aster, Misha (2010). The Reich's Orchestra: The Berlin Philharmonic 1933‚Äì1945. Souvenir Press. p. 149. During the evening she gave a performance of her dance, The Last. Reviews of the act stated it was an incarnation of plastic ideas, to which she visually transforms her own physicality. On 6 December 1941 she spent three months of a tour of the Netherlands and France for the Wehrmacht and for the rest of 1942 she continued to tour before being arrested and murdered. Red Orchestra In 1935 Schottm√ºller met the sculptor Kurt Schumacher in the studio of Fritz Cremer which was located close to hers. Schottm√ºller entered into a love affair with Schumacher and at the time she did not know Schumacher was married. They shared a common bond that led to friendship driven in their opposition to National Socialism and their common interest in sculptural design. A Stolperstein or stumbling block memorial to Oda Schottm√ºller that is located at Reichsstra√üe 106, Berlin-Westend, Germany Arrest On 16 September 1942, while she was at her studio on the Reichsstrasse, Schottm√ºller was arrested and sent to a holding cell in the prison on Alexanderplatz. She was accused of using her studio to host a radio set, which she denied. In January 1943, she was sentenced to death by the Reichskriegsgericht for aiding and abetting the preparation of a treasonable enterprise and enemy favouritism. Due to the number of executions that were being conducted, Schottm√ºller had to spend two months in solitary confinement. In March 1943 Schottm√ºller was sent to Pl√∂tzensee Prison for six weeks before being sent to the Women's Prison on Barnimstrasse. While in the women's prison she petitioned Hitler for a pardon which was rejected on 21 July 1943. On 5 August 1943, she was executed by guillotine in Pl√∂tzensee Prison. Resistance The police records of Schottm√ºller's arrest did not survive and the only material that did survive is the letters that she sent from prison. It is doubtful that she was honest in her writing, confessing that she did not know half the people that the Gestapo had said she did, nor the fact some of them were Communists. In a letter to her father she states: I was so glad of my stupidity + cluelessness about political things ... I'm entirely unaware of these things. Even if she did not take part in anti-Nazi activities, she was certainly a member of the bohemian circle around Libertas Schulze-Boysen and Harro Schulze-Boysen. It was resistance that led to her death, not her art. Honours In November 2014, the Schottmuellerstrasse in Eppendorf was renamed after Schottm√ºller. The street was formerly named after the bacteriologist Hugo Schottm√ºller but after intervention by the aristocratic Pallandt family was renamed in honour of Schottm√ºller. On 23 September 2016, a Stolperstein for Schottm√ºller was laid in front of the 106 Reichsstra√üe in Charlottenburg. On 25 August 2019, a memorial stone was unveiled on St. Matthew's Cemetery in Sch√∂neberg in Berlin. Tributes and exhibitions The first tribute to Schottm√ºller was in 1946 by German theatre critic Paul Fechter who reported on the first art exhibition after the war that spoke about Schottm√ºller and Schumacher. There have been many more. Geertje Andresen formerly a research associate at the Memorial to the German Resistance who in cooperation with the German Dance Archives in Cologne conducted an analysis of the estate of Schottm√ºller. This resulted in the publication of a book and an exhibition that was created in cooperation with Hans Coppi. This was held on 16 November 2006 at the German Resistance Memorial Center. It is Andresen's work that brings to light the futile and vindictive murder by the Nazi state of a German women who was only tangentially linked to the Rote Kapelle and whose membership of the group constituted resistance.

However, the building was demolished in 1989. Architecture and design Built in the Turkish Neoclassical style, the house is one of several of Tek's well known examples in this architectural movement. Turquoise tiles, arches following Islamic geometry and extrusions typical of classical Ottoman houses are the main design elements of the building. The house itself consists of three floors, but due to the slanted plot on which it was built, a fourth floor on ground level exists. This level is used as a restaurant.

The firm has no physical office location but operates remotely via cloud computing. In 2019 the firm has a staff of 25, and has 150,000 authors in its community and 1,500 editors and designers and marketers and ghostwriters. The firm takes a 20% cut of each contract between authors and freelancers (10% from the author, 10% from the editor). Reedsy offers tools and services to assist both authors and freelancers which include training courses to help authors navigate the self-publishing process, as well as online software tools to help authors convert their manuscript files to files suitable for publishing e-books, such as EPUB and PDF formats. It offers authors a free book editing tool as well as a web page to help them promote their books on the site. The platform offers 30 free online courses to help authors with book development. The firm vets the credentials of story editors, cover designers, ghost writers, marketers and other freelancers, by verifying their previous work experience for mainstream publishers as well as examining their overall track record in the publishing industry. The firm gets applications from hundreds of freelancers but only accepts a few, and allows \\"only the publishing world's elite\\" to list with their service, according to a report in Fast Company magazine. According to one report, 95% of Reedsy's freelancers have worked in the past for one of the Big Five publishers. In addition, the firm verifies the credentials of writing contests to help writers avoid wasting time with fake contests and prizes. Typically an author can request free quotes from freelancers, and if an agreement is made, subsequent development such as editing and formating can be handled entirely through Reedsy's website, with authors and freelancers collaborating online. According to statistics compiled by the firm, the average cost for copyediting a 60,000 word manuscript was $1020, proofreading was $540, and cover design was $700. Reedsy began in 2014 after being funded by Seedcamp, founded by Emmanuel Nataf, Richard Fayet, Matthew Cobb and Vincent Durand, with an initial funding of $1.25 million. A competitor to Reedsy is the New York-based firm Bibliocrunch. Self publishing was expanding at a rapid pace, and yet it was difficult for authors to find qualified assistants to help them get their books in good shape, as well as learn what to do; so the firm became an online platform to not only connect authors with freelancers but to help authors learn about self publishing, and to help them promote their self-published books. The firm expanded; in 2016, the Reedsy community included approximately 20,000 authors and 500 freelancers; in 2019, there were approximately 150,000 authors in the community and 1,500 freelancers.

He transformed the culture of the GMC by setting out what patients could expect of doctors and is credited with leading significant changes in the regulation of professional medicine and introducing the policy of professional revalidation in the UK. Irvine was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, where his father was a sole practitioner GP. After qualifying in medicine and spending some time working with his father, he joined colleagues from two practices to establish a multidisciplinary teaching practice and thereafter followed a career with various committees including as regional adviser in general practice, the Joint Committee on Postgraduate General Practice Training, chair of council of the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) and later the GMC committee on professional standards and ethics. In 1979, he received an OBE, in 1987 a CBE and in 1994 he was Knighted. In 1999 Irvine's GMC presidency was unsuccessfully challenged by obstetrician Wendy Savage, the first time anyone had stood in opposition to an incumbent president. Irvine won by 30 votes, the GMC agreed to request revalidation and Irvine decided to step down ten months early. He became internationally known for his work with the Picker Institute and in 2017 was awarded the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) healthcare quality and safety award. He also wrote the books, The Doctors' Tale: Professionalism and Public Trust (2003) and the memoir Medical Professionalism and the Public Interest: Reflections on a Life in Medicine (2017).  Early life and education  Donald Irvine was born on 2 June 1935 in Newcastle upon Tyne, to Andrew Bell Hamilton Irvine and Dorothy Mary Irvine n√©e Buckley. He was brought up in Ashington, Northumberland, a coal mining community, where he travelled to and from school with soot covered miners. His father was a sole practitioner general practitioner (GP) and his home was also the surgery, so his home life revolved around his father's patients. He had one sister who also became a doctor, and they would both go on home visits with their father and help stock the medicines. He later recounted in his memoirs that... \\"in those days there was a common assumption in medical families that son would follow father\\". At the age of ten, during a holiday in Edinburgh, he developed rheumatic fever, and subsequently spent one year of his childhood in hospital, where he was cared for by paediatrician Charles McNeil. He attended The King Edward VI School, Morpeth, and later graduated in medicine from Durham University in 1958. Having contracted rheumatic fever exempted him from National Service. Early career After leaving Durham, he completed his house jobs and vocational training, following which he joined his father's practice. Subsequently, he joined colleagues from two other practices to establish the Lintonville Medical Group, the first multidisciplinary teaching practice in the U.K. His father had been involved in the formation of the RCGP in 1952 and Irvine would soon follow in its philosophy, recognising the need to improve standards in general practice. At that time, a doctor could enter general practice with no requirement for further training and after completing just one year of hospital posts. He was also affected by the poor public perception of general practice in the 1950s, reflected in Winston Churchill's physician, Lord Moran's words in 1958... \\"that it was the place doctors landed when they fell off the hospital ladder\\". Irvine began to take up committee posts, first as regional adviser in general practice and then in the 1970s, as a member of the Merrison Committee of Inquiry into the Regulation of the Medical Profession. RCGP In his mid- thirties, and having also academically achieved a DObst in 1960, an MD from Newcastle in 1964 and a FRCGP in 1972, he was the third person to be appointed honorary secretary of the council of the College, serving for seven years before stepping down in 1978. It gave him the foundation from which he could plan to raise the profile of general practice. During his term he contributed to the College's evidence to the Royal Commission and to the central organisation of the three-year GP vocational training, organised on a regional basis, which provided training practices and a curriculum. He continued as one of two secretarys for the RCGP led Joint Committee on Postgraduate General Practice Training, with Irvine as its lead. Recognising the poor standards in general practice, he led a study that included most of the northern region GPs and hospital paediatricians. He demonstrated that setting standards for children was feasible. Between 1982 and 1985, he served as the chairman of the RCGP council, where he introduced the \\"quality initiative\\" which encouraged GPs to assess their day-to-day care in their own practices. In 1979 he became the first RCGP nominee to the GMC. GMC and medical regulation Irvine chaired the GMC committee on professional standards and ethics and has been credited for his drive \\"to make medical regulation in the UK more patient centred\\". His actions also resulted in a publication titled Good Medical Practice and Duties of a Doctor and a shift from \\"telling doctors what they should not do, to one which told them what they should do\\". It transformed the culture of the GMC by setting out what patients could expect from doctors. In 1995, shortly after being knighted, and with the concern over the GMC's disciplinary procedures and having the job of implementing performance procedures, he was elected president of the GMC, the first ever GP to hold the office. It was an appointment that he kept until stepping down in 2002. In the 1990s, a number of high-profile cases of medical failures had come to public attention during his tenure and had unsettling relations between doctors and their patients. His first role as president was to chair the conduct committee that handled the Bristol heart scandal, where a whistleblower disclosed poor heart surgery outcomes in children. In 1998, two months into the Bristol inquiry, as its chairman, he commented... \\"we are not dealing with statistics here, we are talking about children\\". On 18 June 1998 at a disciplinary hearing, Irvine told two paediatric heart surgeons and the chief executive of the United Bristol National Health Service (NHS) Trust, that they were guilty of serious professional misconduct. Subsequently, restoring public trust became an issue. Feeling that Bristol had exposed a medical \\"club culture\\", he lobbied for the reform of professional medical regulation. It was a difficult time for the medical profession and after the Bristol case and its subsequent public inquiry led by Sir Ian Kennedy, he faced further medical scandals, including the Alder Hey organs scandal and the case of Harold Shipman. He set out to define what good practice should be, focussing on protecting patients, and clarified that it was not justifiable to blame these scandals on individuals, but there needed to be acknowledgement of \\"inherent cultural flaws in the medical profession\\"...\\"excessive paternalism\\"...and a \\"lack of respect for patients\\" resulting in \\"secrecy and complacency about poor practice\\". He pushed for \\"revalidation\\", a five-yearly assessment of doctors' fitness to practise, which was later introduced in 2012. This chief achievement as president of the GMC of introducing the policy of professional revalidation was a term he coined to show how doctors would keep up to date with medical knowledge and skills, and he is credited with turning the GMC's philosophy from one of protecting doctors to that of protecting patients. In 1999 Irvine's presidency was unsuccessfully challenged by obstetrician Wendy Savage, the first time anyone had stood in opposition of an incumbent president. Savage gained 26 votes, whereas Irvine gained 56. The GMC finally agreed to ask the government for legislation to introduce revalidation, and subsequently Irvine stepped down 10 months early in 2002. The legacy of his presidency became the refocusing of the GMC's purpose on protecting patients and the public. Irvine, however, later described the year 2000 as \\"annus horribilis\\" for the GMC. Many of the previous presidents had been elevated to the House of Lords and as he recorded in his memoirs of 2003, his presidency years were not happy ones. Denis Pereira Gray later stated that it \\"was a remarkable achievement to get the GMC to vote for revalidation\\". Later In 2003, Irvine described \\"partnerships with patients, and accountability rather than professional autonomy ... teamwork rather than individualism, collective as well as personal responsibility, transparency rather than secrecy, empathetic communication and above all respect for others\\". In his communication to the GMC Committee (2010‚Äì2011 committee), he...\\"recommended that the committee view the processes of revalidation and fitness to practice as one system that aims to ensure public protection\\". He became internationally known following his work with the Picker Institute. He was their patron and chair of the board of trustees from 2001 to 2013. Awards and honours In 2017 he was awarded the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS) healthcare quality and safety award. In 1979, he received an OBE, in 1987 a CBE and in 1994 he was Knighted in the 1994 New Year Honours Lists. Seven universities have awarded him honorary doctorates.  Personal and family  As well as his interest in aviation, he maintained an interest in ornithology and was able to recognise a bird from listening to its song. He was also interested in gardening. In 1960, he married Margaret McGuckin, with whom he had two sons and one daughter. They divorced in 1983. He then married Sally Fountain in 1986 and divorced in 2004. In 2007, he married nurse Cynthia Rickitt, who cared for him during his final two years of illness with heart and kidney failure. He died at his home on 19 November 2018.  Publications  In 2003, one year after stepping down from the GMC, he published The Doctors' Tale: Professionalism and Public Trust. In this account, he highlighted the importance of role models, his concern over the influence of hospital consultants and the standing of the British Medical Association. He published his memoirs in Medical Professionalism and the Public Interest: Reflections on a Life in Medicine, which was reviewed and recommended by Denis Pereira Gray to all physicians who look to leadership roles, to patients, medical historians and to health policymakers. =Selected publications= Articles * \\"William Pickles Lecture 1975. 1984: the quiet revolution?\\", The Journal of the Royal College of General Practitioners (1975), Vol. 25, No. 155, pp. 399‚Äì407 *\\"Standards in general practice: the quality initiative revisited\\", British Journal of General Practice, February 1990, Vol. 40, Issue 331, pp. 75‚Äì77, * \\"General practice in the 1990s: a personal view on future developments\\", British Journal of General Practice (1993), Vol. 43, No. 368), pp. 121‚Äì125 *\\"The performance of doctors: the new professionalism\\", The Lancet 3 April 1999, Vol. 353, Issue 9159, pp. 1174‚Äì1177, *‚ÄúGood doctors: safer patients ‚Äì the Chief Medical Officer's prescription for regulating doctors‚Äù, Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine (2006), Vol. 99, No. 9, pp. 430‚Äì432, *\\"A Short History of the GMC, Medical Education, 17 February 2006, Vol. 40, Issue 3, pp. 202‚Äì211, Books *The Doctors' Tale: Professionalism and Public Trust, Radcliffe Medical Press (2003), *Medical Professionalism and the Public Interest: Reflections on a Life in Medicine, RCGP Heritage Committee (2017), .

Textual variants in manuscripts arise when a copyist makes deliberate or inadvertent alterations to a text that is being reproduced. An abbreviated list of textual variants in this particular book is given in this article below. Origen, writing in the 3rd century, was one of the first who made remarks about differences between manuscripts of texts that were eventually collected as the New Testament. He declared his preferences among variant readings. For example, in , he favored \\"Barabbas\\" against \\"Jesus Barabbas\\" (In Matt. Comm. ser. 121). In , he preferred \\"Bethabara\\" over \\"Bethany\\" as the location where John was baptizing (Commentary on John VI.40 (24)). \\"Gergeza\\" was preferred over \\"Geraza\\" or \\"Gadara\\" (Commentary on John VI.40 (24) - see ). Most of the variations are not significant and some common alterations include the deletion, rearrangement, repetition, or replacement of one or more words when the copyist's eye returns to a similar word in the wrong location of the original text. If their eye skips to an earlier word, they may create a repetition (error of dittography). If their eye skips to a later word, they may create an omission. They may resort to performing a rearranging of words to retain the overall meaning without compromising the context. In other instances, the copyist may add text from memory from a similar or parallel text in another location. Otherwise, they may also replace some text of the original with an alternative reading. Spellings occasionally change. Synonyms may be substituted. A pronoun may be changed into a proper noun (such as \\"he said\\" becoming \\"Jesus said\\"). John Mill's 1707 Greek New Testament was estimated to contain some 30,000 variants in its accompanying textual apparatusAdam Fox, John Mill and Richard Bentley: A Study of the Textual Criticism of the New Testament 1675‚Äì1729 (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1954), pp. 105‚Äì115; John Mill, Novum Testamentum Graecum, cum lectionibus variantibus MSS (Oxford 1707) which was based on \\"nearly 100 [Greek] manuscripts.\\"Metzger and Ehrman (2005), p.154 Peter J.

Publication history Flying Buffalo's original plan for Mercenaries, Spies and Private Eyes (MSPE) was to publish it as a boxed set that would include a rulebook for the role-playing game setting, and a separate short teaching supplement, The Adventure of the Jade Jaguar. However, they eventually decided to release the MPSE rulebook on its own as a single unboxed book. Although The Adventure of the Jade Jaguar was very short, having been written merely as a teaching adventure, it was released as the first MPSE adventure. Plot summary The Adventure of the Jade Jaguar is a solitaire adventure where a single player must foil the villainous Jade Jaguar, who has roused natives into a crude fighting force, and seized explorer Professor Jackson and her colleagues. Reception Nick Davison reviewed Jade Jaguar for Imagine magazine, and stated that \\"This is a very shallow module, which cannot be enjoyed for much longer than an hour.\\" In the May 1984 edition of White Dwarf (Issue #49), Jon Sutherland was very critical of both the adventure and the MPSE system, giving the adventure a very poor overall rating of 3 out of 10, and stating that it \\"Sounds a bit like a second rate Tarzan script, read on if you can stifle the yawns. A poor introduction to a dull RPG.\\" In the February 1985 edition of Dragon (Issue #94), Arlen Walker pointed out that if players new to the MPSE system used it \\"As a teaching tool, it succeeds because it demonstrates the use of many of the rules and also allows you to try both violent and problem-solving approaches to the game.\\" But as a stand-alone adventure, Walker found \\"it isn't that absorbing\\", and that it was far too short: \\"The first time I played this adventure, I was in and out successfully in a matter of ten minutes or less. While some subsequent runs lasted much longer, ten minutes proved to be about the average time for any adventure.\\" In conclusion, he did not recommend this adventure for players already familiar with the MPSE system, \\"however, if you‚Äôre just now buying the game [MPSE], the extra $4.95 to acquire this teaching tool would be well spent.\\" Reviews *Fantasy Gamer #2 (Oct./Nov., 1983) References Category:Mercenaries, Spies and Private Eyes Category:Role-playing game adventures ","title":"The Adventure of the Jade Jaguar"},{"id":"61197650","text":"Fiona Ross (born 1954) is a British type designer, academic and linguist.

History Since 1971, when President Richard Nixon ended the dollar convertibility to gold, many foreign currencies emerged trying to replicate the pre-1971 situation. An example of a petrocurrency backed by gold was a project by the Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi, who released a project to create a multinational African currency, However, this project was discarded because he was overthrown in the Civil war of Libya in October 2011.\\"The Worrisome Deal: China and Saudi Arabia\\", Harvard Politics, 18 December 2018. China, with a currency constantly growing on market relevance, attempted to create a dollar alternative. On June 2017, the People's Bank of China and the Central Bank of Russia signed a memorandum to facilitate the exchange of crude oil using Yuans. Months later, in September 2017, China made official the existence of the Petroyuan. The operation was given on a context where China dominated crude oil importations, with approximately 400 million tons as of 2017 as stated by Sinopec, one of China's biggest oil companies. Characteristics One of the reasons the Petroyuan was created was that Russia, Venezuela and Iran may be able to avoid United States sanctions, so nations such as Saudi Arabia, one of the main oil producers and extractors could avoid dollar hegemony and US pressure. The Yuan's main problems are its volatile liquidity and short scale extension, however the Chinese government intervened increasing its gold reserves to back the Petroyuan.

Unlike them, however, he preferred to make small works and tended to explicitly draw upon natural forms and figures for his abstract subjects. Called a \\"highly personal artist,\\" he developed a unique style that was considered to be both mystical and magic. His career was exceptionally long, covering more than 50 years and his output was correspondingly large. Early life and training Rosenborg was born in Brooklyn, New York, on June 9, 1913. In 1929, while he was a high school student, he began to work with the designer, artist, and instructor, Henriette Reiss. When Rosenborg encountered her, Reiss was serving as an instructor for the School Art League in the American Museum of Natural History. She was then engaged in instructing both students and their teachers in the city school system by a method she called Rhythmic Design. She believed inspiration for abstract designs could be found in rhythms--rhythms that could be perceived in ordinary perceptions much as they are when listening to music. She said the rhythms of a musical composition might inspire a graphic pattern of forms and colors and in the same way rhythms perceived in a sunset or the ripples of a stream might be translated into a graphic design: anything seen, heard, or read might furnish an idea for a symbolic interpretation. She believed that rhythm is present everywhere and that students could be trained to sense its various manifestations. In May 1930 Reiss selected a drawing by Rosenborg to be shown in an exhibition of creative design by City high school students. From 1930 to 1933, aged 17 to 20, Rosenborg studied with Reiss in what Vivian Raynor of the New York Times called a \\"pupil-apprentice\\" relationship. During this time she instructed him in music appreciation, literature, and art history as well as giving technical training in art. Career in art Ralph Rosenborg, Abstracts in Blues and Greens, 1937, watercolor and ink, 10.5 x 13.75 inches Ralph Rosenborg, The Far-away City, 1941, oil on linen, 18 x 24 inches Ralph Rosenborg, American Landscape, 1972, oil on canvas, 16 x 20 inches Ralph Rosenborg, Landscape with Pink, Green, and Blue, 1982, watercolor, 10 x 14 inches In April 1934 Rosenborg was one of 1,500 artists to participate in the annual Salons of America exhibition, which was held that year in Rockefeller Center's RCA Building. Each paid two dollars for the privilege of hanging up to three works and none was given prominence over the others. The New York Times reported that by the time the show closed a month later, some 30,000 people had viewed it. The following year he was given a solo exhibition (his first) at the Lounge Gallery of the Eighth Street Playhouse. The year after that he participated in a group show held by the Municipal Art Committee and in 1937 was given a second solo exhibition, this time in the Artists Gallery, which, like the Lounge Gallery, specialized in shows of deserving young artists who were unable to show in New York's commercial galleries. That year he also became a founding member of and participated in a group show held by American Abstract Artists, a loose assembly of artists that aimed to promote abstract art and artists in New York. At roughly the same time Rosenborg associated himself with a group of abstractionists that called itself \\"The Ten\\" and in May 1938 joined with its other members in what would be his first appearance in a commercial gallery: the Gallery Georgette Passedoit. In 1938 he his work appeared in a group show at the Lounge Gallery, in 1939 in group shows at the Artists Gallery and (with other members of The Ten) at the Bonestell Gallery, and in 1940 yet another group show (with other members of American Abstract Artists) at the American Fine Arts Building. During this period Rosenborg began an association with an art dealer, Marian Guthrie Willard, that would last into the war years. Willard was known for selecting artists whose work she admired without regard to their commercial potential. She aimed to nurture the careers of young artists whose work, as she put it, made \\"a personal statement as well as a vision of the universal.\\" In 1938 Rosenborg's paintings were included in group shows at her East River Gallery, in 1939 at a gallery she ran jointly with J.B Neumann called the Neumann-Willard Gallery, in 1942 at the Willard Gallery, and in 1943 at the same place. Willard gave Rosenborg solo shows in February and November 1941. Rosenborg never had an exclusive long-term relationship with a commercial gallery. Throughout his career his work appeared in both group and solo shows in a wide variety of galleries and museums both in New York and elsewhere in the United States. Examples include the Phillips Memorial Gallery (group, 1941), Yale University Art Gallery (group, 1942), Brandt (group, 1944), the Pinacotheca (solo, 1945), Troeger-Phillips (solo, 1946), Chinese Gallery (solos, 1946 and 1947), Art Institute of Chicago (group, 1948), Corcoran Gallery of Art (groups, 1949 and 1959) Seligmann (solo, 1950), Davis (solos, 1953 and 1954), Delacorte (solo, 1955), and Landry (solo, 1959, 1960, and 1962). He contributed paintings to exhibitions at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1946, 1953, 1956, 1957, 1976, and 1990. He was given retrospective exhibitions in 1982 at the Schlesinger-Boisant√© Gallery and in 1983 at the Princeton Gallery of Fine Art. =Artistic style and critical reception= Unlike better-known abstract expressionists, Rosenborg made small paintings and gave preference to gouaches and watercolors over oils. From his mentor, Henriette Reiss, he had learned a style of abstraction that involved symbolic interpretation of natural rhythms. Critics noted a preference for a gestural abstraction rather than a geometrical one. They also saw a persistent use of symbols, noting a similarity to the work of Wassily Kandinsky and Paul Klee. Throughout his career critics further saw a distinct lyricism in Rosenborg's work. Rosenborg's 1937 watercolor, \\"Abstracts in Blues and Greens\\" (at left above) illustrates his early watercolor style. \\"The Far-away City\\" of 1941 (at right above) illustrates his early style in oils. \\"American Landscape\\" (at left above) illustrates his late style in oils. \\"Landscape with Pink, Green, and Blue\\" (at right above) illustrates his late watercolor style. His early work obscured the natural forms that inspired them making critics see them as tending toward pure abstraction. In the early 1950s he made a transition to a more clearly figurative expression. These late works were said to give off an air of mystery. Writing of a solo show held at the Landry Gallery in October 1960, Stuart Preston of the New York Times said, \\"The essence of mystery and magic is exactly what distinguishes Ralph Rosenborg's meditative semi-abstract landscape water-colors... These are rapturous little acts of visual and manual concentration at first sight inscrutable and then revealing themselves to be precise and allusive. Writing about the same show, Bennett Schiff, critic for the New York Post, said \\"A mystical intensity and a beauty which burns in ruby and sapphire colors are in these fine paintings.\\" Personal life and family Rosenborg's birth name was Ralph Mozart Rosenborg. He was born on June 9, 1913, to Mozart Wolfgang Rosenborg (October 28, 1884 to March 4, 1932) and his wife Helen Rosenborg (September 20, 1888 to September 28, 1947). Both parents were born in Sweden. Rosenborg's father emigrated to New York in 1903 and lived in New York City. During Rosenborg's childhood, he was a machinist. Later he earned his living as a stockroom man. His mother was sometimes a homemaker and sometimes earned a living as a cook. As a child he had hoped to play the violin, but private lessons were beyond his family's means. The art programs of the city's public schools and the privately-funded Art School League gave him the opportunity for no-cost art training and brought him into contact with Henriette Reiss who became his mentor and supporter. It is likely that sales of paintings never brought in enough money for Rosenborg to live on. Between 1936 and 1938 he taught classes at the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences and subsequently served as a guard for a year or two at the Museum of Non-Objective Painting. Throughout his career he was thought to have relied on the women in his life for economic as well as emotional support--first his mother, then Louise Nevelson, with whom he had a passionate relationship between 1942 and 1948, then, briefly, her sister, Anita, and finally, his wife, Margaret, after they met in 1949 and married in 1951. Suffering from alcoholism and burdened with an erratic and often combative personality, he was said not to have a single close friend. According to Nevelson's biographer, \\"Rosenborg's gifts as a painter were undermined by his alcoholism, irascible temper, and adolescent- like quest for independence...\\" Another writer said he had an \\"exasperating character\\" and was \\"a legend in the art world for his suspicion of anything smacking of entanglement in social or professional relationships.\\" After he was afflicted with a stroke in 1991, Rosenborg and his wife moved to her home town of Portland, Oregon, and there he died in a nursing home on October 22, 1992.

Textual variants in manuscripts arise when a copyist makes deliberate or inadvertent alterations to a text that is being reproduced. An abbreviated list of textual variants in this particular book is given in this article below. Most of the variations are not significant and some common alterations include the deletion, rearrangement, repetition, or replacement of one or more words when the copyist's eye returns to a similar word in the wrong location of the original text. If their eye skips to an earlier word, they may create a repetition (error of dittography). If their eye skips to a later word, they may create an omission. They may resort to performing a rearranging of words to retain the overall meaning without compromising the context. In other instances, the copyist may add text from memory from a similar or parallel text in another location. Otherwise, they may also replace some text of the original with an alternative reading. Spellings occasionally change. Synonyms may be substituted. A pronoun may be changed into a proper noun (such as \\"he said\\" becoming \\"Jesus said\\"). John Mill's 1707 Greek New Testament was estimated to contain some 30,000 variants in its accompanying textual apparatusAdam Fox, John Mill and Richard Bentley: A Study of the Textual Criticism of the New Testament 1675‚Äì1729 (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1954), pp. 105‚Äì115; John Mill, Novum Testamentum Graecum, cum lectionibus variantibus MSS (Oxford 1707) which was based on \\"nearly 100 [Greek] manuscripts.\\"Metzger and Ehrman (2005), p.154 Peter J.

She is a senior investigator and co-chief of the Computational and Statistical Genomic Branch of the National Human Genome Research Institute.  Education  Bailey-Wilson received a B.A. magna cum laude in Biology from Western Maryland College followed by a Ph.D. in medical genetics with a minor in biomathematics from Indiana University School of Medicine in 1981 under the direction of Joe C. Christian. She completed post-doctoral training with Robert Elston in the Department of Biometry and Genetics at Louisiana State University Medical Center.  Career  Bailey-Wilson became a professor at the Medical Center of Louisiana at New Orleans before joining the National Institutes of Health in 1995. She was appointed co-branch chief of the Inherited Disease Research Branch in 2006 and became co-chief of the Computational and Statistical Genomics Branch at the National Human Genome Research Institute in 2014. Her research program focuses on understanding the genetic factors that increase risk for various complex diseases and their interactions with environmental risk factors. Bailey-Wilson specializes in statistical genetics and genetic epidemiology and is especially interested in risk factors for lung cancer, prostate cancer, eye disorders, autism and oral clefts. She has served on many scientific advisory boards including the Cancer Family Registry CFRCCS Advisory Board, the World Trade Center Kinship and Data Analysis Panel for the National Institute of Justice and the Genetic Analysis Workshop Advisory Board. She also served as a member of the International Genetic Epidemiology Society (IGES) Board of Directors (1999-2001), as IGES president-elect, president and past president (2006-2008) and as chair of the IGES Ethical, Legal and Social Issues committee.  Research  Bailey-Wilson in 2002. Bailey-Wilson is actively studying a range of diseases, including lung cancer, prostate cancer, myopia and other eye diseases, autism and cleft lip and palate. Trained in statistical genetics, she is interested in understanding the genetics of complex diseases and developing novel methodologies to disentangle the roles that genes and environment play in disease causation. She has been particularly interested in lung cancer since the early 1980s, when very few scientists believed there might be a genetic link to the condition. Today, significantly more data support the idea that there are susceptibility alleles for one or more unknown genes that dramatically increase certain smokers' risk of developing lung cancer. In a collaboration called the Genetic Epidemiology of Lung Cancer Consortium (GELCC), Bailey-Wilson and others recently narrowed down the location of a potential lung-cancer gene to a region of chromosome 6, and showed that RGS17 is a tumor suppressor gene in this region that shows association with lung cancer risk in highly aggregated lung cancer families. With her collaborators, she is using dense genotyping panels and next-generation DNA sequencing in the GELCC's set of highly aggregated lung cancer families, their family-history- positives cases, and age-gender-smoking matched controls to search for causal variants in additional lung cancer susceptibility loci. Bailey-Wilson has used similar approaches to locate other cancer-related genes. For example, she and her collaborators published evidence that genes involved in prostate cancer reside on specific regions of chromosomes 1, 8, 17 and X. These findings have been replicated, and three candidate genes with rare variants that appear to increase prostate cancer risk have been cloned: RNASEL (HPC1), which encodes ribonuclease L, MSRI, which encodes the macrophage scavenger receptor 1 and HOXB13, which encodes the homeobox B13 protein. Bailey-Wilson is focusing on identifying additional susceptibility genes for these and other cancers in ongoing studies. At present, she is collaborating with the International Consortium for Prostate Cancer Genetics on a whole exome sequencing study of families with strong family history of prostate cancer and is the lead statistician on the study of the ICPCG's African-American families. Bailey- Wilson is also applying these next-generation sequencing tools to her studies of highly aggregated non-syndromic oral cleft families from the Syrian Arab Republic (2 to 17 affected individuals per family) and to a set of multiplex autism spectrum disease families. In the autism study, a subset of families in which at least one child with autism also has abnormal cholesterol levels are of particular interest. Bailey-Wilson develops and tests novel computational methods to analyze genetic markers. Her group is especially interested in using machine learning methods to detect causal variants that have limited or no marginal effects on risk of a disease but which do show strong interaction effects (with either other genetic variants or with environmental risk factors). She is also working to address the effects of linkage disequilibrium, or the nonrandom association of closely spaced loci, on genetic interaction tests and machine learning methods. Linkage disequilibrium can be caused by a low frequency of recombinations between two loci when they are very close together on a chromosome. The closer two loci are, the more likely they are to exhibit linkage disequilibrium. Thus, markers that are only 100 kb apart display significantly greater linkage disequilibrium than markers that are 100‚Äì5,000 kb apart. Because standard linkage analysis methods typically assume no linkage disequilibrium exists between loci, Bailey- Wilson's group has developed approaches to streamline these methods to study sets of dense genetic markers. She is using association methods that take advantage of linkage disequilibrium data, HapMap data, and the sequence of the human genome to determine the location of genetic loci that increase risk for various diseases. She has used these and other analytical methods to determine, for example, whether alleles at specific marker loci are transmitted along with a disease through generations in families with several affected members. Bailey-Wilson has also used statistical methods to determine the marker alleles that people with a specific disease carry more frequently - and disease-free people carry less frequently - than can be explained by chance. This work has helped to greatly reduce the number of target regions that investigators need to search for potential disease-related genes. Her group is also developing approaches to mitigate the increased false-positive evidence of epistatic interaction that can be observed when strong LD exists between variants within a single genetic locus that all have a marginal effect on the trait.  Awards and honors  Bailey-Wilson has received a number of awards and honors, including the Distinguished Alumnus Award from the Department of Medical Genetics, Indiana University School of Medicine (1995), the Trustee's Alumni Award from Western Maryland College (1998), the Leadership Award from the International Genetic Epidemiology Society (2006), induction as an alumni member into Phi Beta Kappa (2010) and the NHGRI Outstanding Mentor Award (2011). Bailey-Wilson is a diplomat of the American Board of Medical Genetics and a founding fellow of the American College of Medical Genetics.  Personal life  Alexander F. Wilson and Joan Bailey- Wilson, co-chiefs of the Inherited Disease Research Branch, NHGRI, at Baltimore's Bayview campus. She heads the Statistical Genetics Section, and he heads the Genometrics Section. Joan Bailey-Wilson and Alexander F. Wilson met as undergraduates while working with the sole genetics faculty member at Western Maryland College in Westminster, Maryland. One thing led to another, and they ended up attending graduate school together at Indiana University, where they studied medical genetics, mathematics, and computer science. They were married in 1978, and two years later they received their doctorates and went to Louisiana State University Medical School in New Orleans to work with Robert Elston. Elston is one of the leading figures in statistical genetics, a then-emerging field that draws on elements of epidemiology, genetics, molecular biology, computer science, and statistics. They entered LSU as postdoctoral fellows and stayed for 15 years, each ultimately reaching the rank of full professor. When Elston left LSU for Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland in 1995, Wilson and Bailey-Wilson decided to relocate as well, to NHGRI. Initially they were in separate branches‚ÄîWilson in the Genetic Disease Research Branch led by Robert Nussbaum and Bailey-Wilson in the Medical Genetics Branch led at the time by Clair Francomano. However, their work was so different from that of the other more traditional bench scientists in their branches that they posed an administrative challenge. \\"We don't purchase supplies; we make contracts for data collection. When we buy computers, it's not laptop computers, it's big servers,\\" explained Wilson. So two years later, Wilson and Bailey-Wilson became a branch unto themselves‚Äîthe Inherited Disease Research Branch (IDRB). Because NIH's anti-nepotism rules prohibit one spouse from supervising the other, Nussbaum was appointed acting chief of the branch. Over the years, Nussbaum gradually taught Wilson and Bailey-Wilson the administrative aspects of the chief's job; thus, they were well prepared to take over this year. \\"He trained us up,\\" said Wilson. Co- branch chiefs are rare at the NIH; married co-chiefs are even rarer. Bailey- Wilson and Wilson have 2 children.

Textual variants in manuscripts arise when a copyist makes deliberate or inadvertent alterations to a text that is being reproduced. An abbreviated list of textual variants in this particular book is given in this article below. Origen, writing in the 3rd century, was one of the first who made remarks about differences between manuscripts of texts that were eventually collected as the New Testament. In , he preferred \\"Bethabara\\" over \\"Bethany\\" as the location where John was baptizing (Commentary on John VI.40 (24)). \\"Gergeza\\" was preferred over \\"Geraza\\" or \\"Gadara\\" (Commentary on John VI.40 (24) - see ). Most of the variations are not significant and some common alterations include the deletion, rearrangement, repetition, or replacement of one or more words when the copyist's eye returns to a similar word in the wrong location of the original text. If their eye skips to an earlier word, they may create a repetition (error of dittography). If their eye skips to a later word, they may create an omission. They may resort to performing a rearranging of words to retain the overall meaning without compromising the context. In other instances, the copyist may add text from memory from a similar or parallel text in another location. Otherwise, they may also replace some text of the original with an alternative reading. Spellings occasionally change. Synonyms may be substituted. A pronoun may be changed into a proper noun (such as \\"he said\\" becoming \\"Jesus said\\").

It is located in the historical Kvabliani valley, on an inaccessible rocky mount. The fortress featured prominently in the Georgian‚ÄìOttoman encounters of the 16th century and was also known by the Turkish equivalent of its name, Altunkal'a. In 2007, Okros Tsikhe was inscribed on the list of Georgia's Immovable Cultural Monuments of National Significance.  Architecture  The Okros Tsikhe fortress is one of the largest medieval fortifications in Georgia. Its thick walls are built of massive crudely trimmed blocks of stone, standing to a height of 10 meters. The citadel tops a rocky ridge of the mount and its ramparts‚Äîreinforced with large towers‚Äîsteeply descent on both southern and northern slopes. Its plan is complex, with several levels following the irregular rocky surface and artificial walls blending with the rocky wall.  History  The Okros Tsikhe fortress was built in the late 13th or early 14th century and was one of the principal fortifications in possession of the Jaqeli dynasty of the Principality of Samtskhe. Owing to its dominant position in the Kvabliani valley, the fortress played a prominent role in the defense of Samtskhe against the invading Ottoman army during Lala Mustafa Pasha's Caucasian campaign in 1578. It was where the princess Dedisimedi had entrenched herself before negotiating a peace agreement with the Ottoman commander. After the final Ottoman conquest of the province, the fortress was known by its Turkish name, Altunkal'a, and served as the center of the homonymous district (liva).

Dating from the early years of the foundation of the city, it connects the Moyka and Neva Rivers. Originally built as part of a system of drainage channels and canals, the Swan Canal replaced a shallow river that flowed between the Summer Garden and the area that became known as the Field of Mars. The canal was dug between 1711 and 1719, and was known as the Summer Canal or Summer Garden Canal. In later years it became a popular habitat for swans, from which it eventually took its name. The canal has undergone repairs and reconstruction over its existence, deepening the channel, and replacing wooden banks with granite. Today it is used by small pleasure boats, and is crossed by two bridges, one of which, the Upper Swan Bridge, is one of the city's oldest stone bridges. Location and characteristics The Swan Canal is in Dvortsovy Municipal Okrug, part of the Tsentralny District of the city. It connects the Moyka River to the south, carrying water north to the Neva River, into which it empties. It divides the Summer Garden to the east from the Field of Mars to the west. It is long, wide and deep. Two bridges span the canal, the Upper Swan Bridge, at the northern end of the canal at its confluence with the Neva, and the Lower Swan Bridge at the southern end, where it branches from the Moyka. Today it is one of the oldest canals in the city, and is used by small pleasure boats. History The view south along the Swan Canal, towards the Mikhailovsky Castle, 1880s, by Alexey Bogolyubov The site of the canal was previously occupied by a shallow swampy river, the Lebedinka (), flowing between the Moyka and the Neva Rivers. Between 1711 and 1719, as part of measures to drain the land now occupied by the Field of Mars, it was cleaned, deepened and renamed the Summer Canal () or the Summer Garden Canal (), after the Summer Garden, which lies alongside the canal's eastern bank. The Red Canal was dug to the west of the Field of Mars, also with the purpose of draining the land. The sides of the canal were reinforced with wooden piles, and possibly also lined with wooden railings about this time, as a 1761 document refers to their repair. Sometime after this, the Summer Canal was settled and became a habitat for swans from the nearby Summer Garden, and the canal became known as the Swan Canal. By the 1730s the canal was crossed by at least four wooden bridges, and in 1733 its banks were reinforced with wood. In 1799 the eastern bank, alongside the Summer Garden, was strengthened with a stone terrace to the design of , and a pier was also constructed, decorated with iron vases by architect Carlo Rossi. The view north towards the Upper Swan Bridge and the junction with the Neva, 1839, by In 1823, as part of the redevelopment of the land around the Field of Mars and the Mikhailovsky Palace, Sadovaya Street was extended up to the eastern edge of the Field of Mars, joining the pathway running parallel to the Swan Canal, and connecting with Millionnaya Street, which crossed the field's northern boundary. In 1824 the terrace was destroyed in a flood, and had to be restored, with stone balusters replaced with a cast-iron openwork grille. Expansion across the meadow's Neva frontage continued in the 1780s with the construction of the service wing of the Marble Palace, and the and the Saltykov Mansions. The Betskoy Mansion, now the home of the Saint-Petersburg State University of Culture and Arts, was built between 1784 and 1787 by Jean-Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe, stands on the west bank of the canal, close to the Upper Swan Bridge. The canal's banks were reinforced in 1934, though a similar strengthening project planned for 1941 had to be cancelled after the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union. Further work on the structure of the canal was carried out between 1953 and 1956, involving deepening it, facing the banks with granite, and landscaping the slopes with earth. In 1997 the walkway beside the canal embankment was repaired, trees planted, and new fences installed. =Bridges= The Upper Swan Bridge and the confluence of the Swan Canal and the Neva The Upper Swan Bridge began as a wooden bridge across the Lebedinka at the point it enters the Neva. It was built between 1711 and 1715, and was named the Swan Bridge. It was replaced in 1768 by a single-span stone bridge designed by Yury Felten. It underwent repairs between 1927 and 1928, and again in 1931 and in 2003. The Upper Swan Bridge is one of the oldest stone bridges in the city. A wooden drawbridge to the design of engineer Harmen van Bol'es was built between 1720 and 1733 at the confluence with the Moyka river, and named the First Tsaritsyn Bridge, after the Tsaritsyn Meadow, now the Field of Mars. It was replaced by a single-span stone bridge built between 1835 and 1837, named the Lower Swan Bridge, as part of the redevelopment of the area around the Mikhailovsky Castle. It was repaired in 1849, and further reconstructed between 1925 and 1926.

Biography =Early years= J√ºrgen Hart was born during the Second World War at Treuen, a small industrial town in the hills south of Leipzig, which during the previous century had become a centre for weaving. While he was small the war ended and the region was liberated from National Socialism in April 1945 by US] troops. Three months left, respecting an agreement concluded the previous year between Comrade Marshal Stalin and President Roosevelt, the Americans left and the Soviets arrived. Hart grew up and then made his life in a region administered as the Soviet occupation zone till October 1949, and thereafter as the Soviet sponsored German Democratic Republic (East Germany). Hart's first cabaret performances took place while he was still at school, along the valley fom Treuen in Auerbach. He was also involved as a stage performer from 1961 till 1963 while stationed at Prenzlau, performing his military service in the National People's Army. Between 1963 and 1967 he studied at the prestigious the Karl Marx University (as it had been renamed in 1953) in Leipzig, emerging with a secondary school teaching qualification in German and Music. =Cabaret= While still at university he became part of \\"academixer\\", a student cabaret group of which in September 1966 Hart was one of four founding members. He continued as its leader till 1990 and remained closely associated with it till his death. Hart worked as a school teacher between 1967 and 1970. He continued to head up the university's \\"Poetic Theatre\\" till 1975 or 1976. Because it was part of the university, the \\"Poetic Theatre\\" company enjoyed the status of a student theatre company even if its members were no longer students. In 1977 \\"academixer\\" was converted from a student cabaret to a professional cabaret, with J√ºrgen Hart as its principal director. It went on to become one of East Germany's best loved cabaret companies. =Katrin= Katrin Bremer joined \\"academixer\\" in 1969, which was the year in which she and J√ºrgen Hart first met. She came originally from Rostock in the north. Eight years younger than her future husband, she had come to Leipzig to study \\"arts and theatre studies\\". The couple's marriage was followed by the births of two recorded daughters one of whom, Elisabeth Hart, later followed her parents onto the cabaret stage. After 1990 J√ºrgen Hart reduced his involvement with \\"academixer\\". His focus switched to solo programmes and, with Katrin Hart, two-person programmes. =Beyond cabaret= During the 1990s Hart also made a series of appearances as a stage actor. He appeared in the comedy \\"Der Raub der Sabinerinnen\\" (\\"The rape of the Sabine Women\\")\\" when it was revived by Emanuel Striese at the Munich Popular Theater (M√ºnchner Volkstheater). In 1995 he took the lead role (as himself) in \\"Augen zu und durch ‚Äì die unernste Geschichte Sachsens\\", an alternative history of the downs and ups of Saxony, when it was staged at the Chemnitz Theatre. He himself was the author of the work. The production was directed by another Saxon, Christoph Br√ºck. He also became active as an author. His detective novel \\"Die Oma im K√ºhlschrank\\" (\\"Granny in the fridge\\") was published in 1999. He also authored \\"Aus der Wichtelrepublik. M√§rchen ohne Grimm und Groll\\" which appeared in 1996. (The punning title is untranslatatable.) J√ºrgen Hart was the author of more than 40 cabaret programmes, many of which became available on gramophone records (and successor media). Many elements from his programmes were re-enacted by other cabaret companies such as, in particular, the Leipziger Pfefferm√ºhle (\\"Leipzig Peppermill\\"). In March 2002, a few weeks before he died, received the Saxon Order of Merit. Wolfgang Schaller, head of the Hercules Club (Herkuleskeule) (cabaret) in Dresden, paid his own tribute: If you take the output of maybe one hundred poets, most people cannot remember one line that any of them wrote. What will then be left will be \\"Sing, mei Sachse, sing\\", which has already become a latter-day folk song\\". The song was published in 1979 with words by J√ºrgen Hart and a melody by Arndt Bause. Almost 200,000 copies of the recording were sold at the time. The song was later adopted and adapted by others: it retains its popularity. =Death and burial= It became known that J√ºrgen Hart was seriously ill in October 2001: he died of bone cancer half a year later. His family implemented his wish that his grave should be positioned next to that of the Saxon dialect poet Lene Voigt in Leipzig's S√ºdfriedhof (South Cemetery). The body of Christian Becher, one of his \\"academixer\\", was placed in an adjacent grave twelve years later. J√ºrgen Hart's widow Katrin remains a member of the \\"academixer\\" cabaret. =Discography (selection)= =Books (selection)= References Category:Musicians from Leipzig Category:German cabaret performers Category:Audiobook narrators Category:Schlager musicians Category:East German musicians Category:Recipients of the National Prize of East Germany Category:1942 births Category:2002 deaths ","title":"J√ºrgen Hart"},{"id":"61198221","text":"Bruno W√ºstenberg (10 March 1912 ‚Äì 31 May 1984) was a German prelate of the Catholic Church who spent his career in the diplomatic service of the Holy See. Biography Bruno W√ºstenberg was born on 10 March 1912 in Duisburg, Germany. He studied Catholic theology at the University of Bonn, the Albert- Ludwigs-Universit√§t Freiburg, and at the seminary in Bensberg near Cologne. He was ordained a priest on 3 March 1938 in Cologne Cathedral and then did pastoral work for a short time in Ulm. He studied law at the Pontifical Gregorian University and in 1945 joined the Roman Curia's Department of Prisoner of War Services. He headed the German-speaking department of the Secretariat of State from 1947 to 1966. In that position he was instrumental in reconciling Germany's two largest political parties, the CDU and the SPD, which required reaching an understanding between the Church and the latter party once it jettisoned its Marxist philosophy in 1959. Die Zeit called him \\"one of the secret pioneers of the grand coalition\\" after he engineered a meeting of Fritz Erler, deputy chair of the SPD, with Pope Paul in 1964. On 24 October 1966, Pope Paul VI named him Titular Archbishop of Tire and Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to Japan. He became the highest-ranking German in the diplomatic service and the first German citizen with the rank of nuncio. He received his episcopal consecration on 11 December 1966 in Cologne Cathedral from the Archbishop of Cologne, Cardinal Joseph Frings. Dated 1966. The title of this article is taken from the words of a Vatican official discussing the process of making the Roman Curia less Italian, more international. He said: \\"The Curia can not be reformed and internationalized overnight. First the old guard has to die off.\\" On 19 December 1973, Pope Paul appointed him Apostolic Delegate to Guinea and Togo and Apostolic Pro-Nuncio to Ivory Coast, Dahomey, and Benin. On 17 January 1979, Pope John Paul II appointed him Apostolic Pro- Nuncio to the Netherlands. There he had a difficult relationship at times for his less than diplomatic handling of the appointment of a bishop. Even early in his career W√ºstenberg lived a stylish life; he belonged to Rome‚Äôs best golf club and drove a Porsche. He anticipated continued social adventures when posted abroad, enjoying the social advantages available in Catholic Tokyo, befriending President Felix Houphou√´t-Boigny in the Ivory Coast, hiring a private band, using the son of Italian most fashionable architect to build a chapel and his own residence.

History The first written record in 1445 shows that Kyle Castle and its lands were previously held by the monks of Melrose Abbey before the Farquhars of Gilmilnscroft obtained possession, John Farquhar having been granted them in a charter granted by a Commendator of Melrose Abbey. The Farquhars obtained further charters to lands from the abbot of Melrose, eventually including the lands of Gilmilnscroft itself. Margaret, a daughter of the Laird of Barquharrie, was the wife of John Farquhar. The Cunninghames at some later stage gained possession, followed by the Stewarts of Bute. Very little written or verbal history survives regarding Kyle Castle except however for inevitable links with 'Old King Cole or Coilus' that have been regularly suggested. The castle's stone has been heavily robbed for use in building dry stone dykes and domestic buildings at Dalblair and Kyle Farms. The preservation of a small section of the castle may relate to the need for readily identifiable landmarks in this remote and relatively featureless landscape. Evidence from maps indicated that the castle was abandoned and in ruins towards the last quarter of the 18th century. Description The covered walkway The castle's chosen location is one of considerable strength with very steep slopes on three sides. Kyle has been dated from the surviving stonework as being 15th to 16th century with a strong rectangular keep that is now 14.0m by 7.0m externally. The surviving ashlar north wall section is 6.1m long, 5.5m high and 1.8, thick. Kyle stands atop a natural flat-topped spur which appears to have had a surrounding barmkin or courtyard wall as suggested by the elevated sections along the edge of the enclosure and a possible watchtower at the extreme western end. To the west a deep narrow 'covered way' curves up to the courtyard area and the keep. The dates of these structures may not be contemporary. Remains of a dry defensive moat lies on the north- east side of the tower castle ruins. A lower terrace with rig and furrow lies to the north. As stated a turf-covered footing of a possible watchtower lies at the extreme western edge of the courtyard.Canmore - Kyle Castle The castle ruins in 1863. Timothy Pont's 16th century map of Kyle shows Castle Keyil (sic) on its natural mound with three towers and a curtain wall or palisade.

Roy's mid 18th century map shows the Castle of Kyle, and an un-named group of buildings that may be Kyle Farm, suggesting that some robbing of stone from the castle or courtyard may have already taken place.Roy Military Survey of Scotland, 1747-1755 In 1775 the castle is shown and marked as a ruin on Armstrong's map.Armstrong, Andrew, 1700-1794. A new map of Ayrshire... In 1832 Thomson's map records the castle as being in ruins.Thomson, John. Northern Part of Ayrshire. Southern Part. As stated the castle structures were robbed of stone which was used to build dry stone dykes and the nearby farm buildings and it is recorded that considerable difficulty was experienced in extracting stones from the mortar. It may be no accident that the ruins that remain form a useful landmark in this desolate and relatively featureless landscape. An engraving made in 1863 shows that the ruins have changed little over the last century and a half or so. References ;Notes ;Sources *Campbell, Thorbj√∏rn (2003). Ayrshire. A Historical Guide.

Early life  John Tennant was born in 1777 in County Antrim, Kingdom of Ireland the third son of Reverend John Tennant and Ann Pat(t)onMadden 1860, pp 168. a Scottish Presbyterian minister who settled in Roseyards, Co. Antrim, Ulster in 1751 and was associated with the Seceding Faction of Ulster Presbyterians.Torpin 2013. His older brother was William Tennant, one of the highest-ranking members of the secret Society of the United Irishmen in Ulster.Torpin 2013.  The United Irishmen  The unsuccessful French expedition to invade Ireland in December 1796 alerted the English authorities to the real danger posed by the United Irishmen. Throughout 1797, repressive measures were taken to destroy the military capabilities of the United Irishmen and break the spirit of the Irish people. The number of arrests and imprisonments without trial increased greatly. Arms were seized and housed burned. As one of the ringleaders, William Tennant had been rounded-up and sent to prison in Scotland, together with Arthur O‚ÄôConnor and Thomas Addis Emmet. Having been involved with their activities, John Tennant, aged 20, fled to France. The first years In 1799 he served in the Army of the North under General Brune. With the provisional rank of chef de battalion, he had helped to drive the combined Anglo-Russian army out of Holland. He then returned to civilian life and was able to live comfortably in Paris. He had had the good fortune to be able to bring with him from Ireland enough money, which he wisely invested, to live from the interest. The Irish Legion By a decree dated 13 Fructidor, Year 11 (31 August 1803), Bonaparte created the formation of a battalion that would be composed entirely of Irishmen or sons of Irishmen. However its formation remained a closely guarded secret and it was not until the 7 December that the existence of the Irish Legion became known publicly. John Tennant was commissioned with the rank of captain on 22 Frimaire, Year 12 (13 Dec 1803).On his commission papers his name was spelt as ‚ÄòTenant‚Äô. In France, unaccustomed with the name, they used about all the different possibilities of the spelling : Tennant, Tennent, Tenent, Tenant. In May of the following year, Bonaparte was proclaimed Emperor. The coronation took place in December 1804. Each regiment in the army sent two representatives to Paris for the ceremonies and celebrations. Captains John Tennant and William Corbet, who were recognised as the two senior captains in the Legion by virtue of service with the French army prior to the formation of the Legion, were chosen for the honour of representing the regiment. With a flag designed specially for them, this was the only Eagle that Napoleon ever gave to a foreign regiment in his service.Of ‚ÄúIrish Green‚Äù, as it was described, of silk, fringed with gold cord, inscribed on one side in letters on gold: ‚ÄúNapol√©on, Empereur des Fran√ßais, √† la Legion Irlandaise,‚Äù and bearing on the other a golden harp, uncrowned, and the words ‚ÄúL‚ÄôInd√©pendance d‚ÄôIrlande.‚Äù The War Drama of the Eagles by Edward Fraser The Legion was based at Lesneven, then Quimper in Brittany. It was still made up almost exclusively of officers, with only a few NCOs and soldiers. Early December 1806 they were moved to Mayence and the Legion became a true military unit. Twelve hundred Polish and Irish prisoners of war volunteered to join the French Army. In early 1807 they were on the move to the island of Walcheren. Throughout the autumn of that year the Legion suffered the drastic effects of malaria.Referred to alternatively as ‚ÄúWalcheren Fever‚Äù or simply ‚Äúthe Fever‚Äù. In the November of that year it was reorganised into two battalions. The 2nd Battalion was sent to Spain to join the army commanded by Marshal Murat that marched to Madrid in 1808. Captain John Tennant was one of those who needed to remain behind with the 1st Battalion since he was suffering the effects of the fever. In the spring of 1809, the Irish Legion was given a new name and organisation. By a decree dated 13 April, the Emperor established the 3rd Foreign Regiment as a French light infantry regiment. About the same time it was decided to raise a 3rd Battalion and John Tennant, as the senior captain, with four officers from the 1st Battalion were ordered to Landau to from the nucleus of the new battalion. As such he missed the English landing on 30 July 1809. On 9 November he was promoted to the rank of chef de bataillon and named commandant of the new 4th Battalion. By imperial decree dated 1 January 1811, the regiment was re-organised, and a week later moved from Landau to Bois-le-Duc (s‚ÄôHertogenbosch) in The Netherlands. The 1st and 4th Battalions were consolidated into one. The new battalion was designated the 1st. Chef de Bataillon John Tennant was given command of the new 1st Battalion.The 2nd and 3rd Battalions in Spain were also ordered to merge by the decree. In the summer of 1812 John Tennant had become quite ill, probably from the re- occurrence of ‚Äúthe Fever‚Äù, and had to spend three months recuperating in Brussels. Fortunately, in the light of the horrible losses and hardships the Grand Army suffered during the Russian Campaign of 1812, the Irish Regiment remained in Holland until February 1813. On the other hand, they occupied the most unhealthy district in all of Europe. The island of Goree and the towns of Bergen op Zoom, and Willemstadt were all three in the low-lying, malaria- stricken district of southwest Holland. Early in 1813 the Irish Regiment was ordered to merge the three existing battalions into two full-strength war battalions. Command of the 1st Battalion went to Chef de Bataillon John Tennant and that of the 2nd Battalion to Chef de Bataillon Hugh Ware. On 1 February they broke camp and made a long winter march to Magdeberg. The Irish Regiment made forced marches to arrive on the battlefield of Bautzen during the morning of 21 May, the second day of the battle. At the head of Puthod‚Äôs Division they attacked Barclay‚Äôs Corps on the extreme allied right. On 26 May they fought with distinction at the Battle of Haynau under the direct command of the emperor. The Irish were rewarded by being given the honour of posting guard at the town of Lignitz (Legnica) for Napoleon until the Imperial Guard arrived and relieved them. On 16 August, at the end of the brief armistice, Puthod‚Äôs Division, including Vacherau‚Äôs Brigade (The Irish Regiment, 134th & 143rd Regiments), were assembled at Goldberg in Silesia. On the eighteenth Blucher‚Äôs cavalry made contact with Puthod. The regiment formed squares to repel a cavalry attack: the squares held fast, and after a number of attempts to break them, the enemy backed off and brought forward artillery. They were then easy targets for cannon fire, losing 400 men before retiring in good order. This affair was the most bloody that the Irish Regiment had seen since it had joined the army in March. Three hundred men had been killed or wounded. Two officers were killed and ten wounded. poor Tennant was giving orders to have the ranks closed and the gaps filled, which had been opened by the artillery, when he fell. He was cut completely in two; the cannon ball striking a belt in which he carried his money served as a knife to separate the body. The soldiers dug his grave with their bayonets, and when burying him found several pieces of gold that fell out of his entrails and part of his gold watch. On 29 August 1813, the whole Irish Regiment was destroyed as a fighting unit during a final stand at Lowerberg. Further reading *Gallaher, John G. Napoleon's Irish Legion.

Very little is known about their biology as C. senex remains a poorly studied species, in spite of being so common. The development of C. senex undergoes four larval instars. The larvae are typical Camponotus larvae: plump and hairy larvae that will spin a cocoon. They contain anchor-tipped dorsal hairs when mature, which may signals for a morphological adaptation to be hung inside the ant nest.

It is a highly fictionalized version of Bacon's Rebellion of 1676, and is one of the first plays to be set in British colonial America. It is also the first travel play known to have been written not only by a woman, but by a playwright who had actually traveled to the Americas. Through her heroic presentation of Nathaniel Bacon and his contempt for the colonial administration, Behn seems to voice her own disillusionment with the morality of colonization (an attitude that also finds expression in her novel Oroonoko).  Plot  The play purports to describe how the colonist Nathaniel Bacon and a volunteer force of Indian fighters temporarily succeeded in overthrowing the government of Sir William Berkeley. Behn portrays Bacon as a heroic figure motivated by honor, and in love with Semernia, an Indian princess. Behn's play has four plots featuring virtually separate casts of characters. One of these is the young and outrageous widow Ranter, who puts on men‚Äôs clothes and fights in several battles. Many of the supporting characters present an unflattering portrayal of colonial life in Virginia. The work ends happily for most characters, with the major exceptions of Bacon, Semernia and the Indian king Cavarnio.  Reception  The play was produced posthumously, and was unsuccessful with audiences. It was first performed at the Drury Lane Theatre in November 1689. Barbara Corte suggests that The Widow Ranter is an unusual tragicomedy that gives both its comic and tragic plots a heroic inflection.

He was consensus five-star recruit and one of the best point guards in the 2020 class, with 247Sports and Rivals ranking him number one overall. Cunningham finished his high school career at Montverde Academy in Montverde, Florida. He won a gold medal for the United States at the 2019 FIBA Under-19 World Cup. He is widely projected to be the first overall pick in the 2021 NBA draft. Early life and career Cunningham was born in Arlington, Texas to Carrie and Keith Cunningham. He grew up playing football as a quarterback, which he claims helped become a better passer and leader on the basketball court. Cunningham focused on basketball after watching his brother play the sport in college. He frequently played basketball with his father and brother at a recreation center. In eighth grade, Cunningham played point guard for Barnett Junior High School in Arlington. High school career Cunningham attended Bowie High School in Arlington. Soon into his freshman season, he became a starter on the varsity team. Cunningham averaged 15.2 points, 6.4 rebounds and three assists per game, helping Bowie reach the District 6A Region I final, and was named District 4-6A Newcomer of the Year. In December 2017, early in his sophomore season, he suffered an injury while attempting to dunk at a tournament in Houston. Cunningham finished the season averaging 18.8 points, 8.2 rebounds, and 5.3 assists per game. He was named District 4-6A co-most valuable player (MVP) and earned Texas Association of Basketball Coaches (TABC) All-Region honors. In the summer prior to his junior year, Cunningham transferred to Montverde Academy, a school in Montverde, Florida with a successful basketball program. He chose Montverde Academy, whose team was ranked No. 1 in the country by USA Today, for its academics and coaching. On February 2, 2019, Cunningham recorded 26 points, nine assists, and seven rebounds in a 76‚Äì51 win over Oak Hill Academy, one of the top high school teams nationally, at the National Hoopfest tournament. At the end of his junior season, after averaging 11.4 points, 5.7 rebounds and 5.5 assists per game, he made the MaxPreps Junior All-American second team. In the summer of 2019, Cunningham was named Nike Elite Youth Basketball League (EYBL) most valuable player (MVP) after averaging 25.1 points, 6.6 rebounds, and 5.2 assists per game for the Texas Titans in the EYBL regular season. For his senior season at Montverde, he was joined by many more top recruits, including five-star forwards Scottie Barnes and Day'Ron Sharpe. Many analysts regarded his team as one of the best in high school basketball history. Cunningham averaged 13.9 points, 6.4 assists and 4.2 rebounds per game, leading Montverde to a 25‚Äì0 record with an average margin of victory of 39 points. He played only 22 minutes per game due to the depth of his team, which often dominated its opposition. At the end of the season, he was honored as Naismith Prep Player of the Year and MaxPreps National Player of the Year. Cunningham was selected to play in the McDonald's All-American Game, Jordan Brand Classic and Nike Hoop Summit, but all three games were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. =Recruiting= Cunningham emerged as a top 25 recruit in the 2020 class at the end of his sophomore season at Bowie. He is a consensus five-star recruit and one of the best players in his class. Cunningham received offers from top NCAA Division I programs, including Duke, Kentucky and North Carolina, but many analysts viewed Oklahoma State as his likely destination after the program hired his brother, Cannen, as an assistant coach. On November 5, 2019, Cunningham announced his commitment to Oklahoma State. He became the highest-ranked commit in program history and the first five-star recruit to join Oklahoma State since Marcus Smart in 2012. In June 2020, the NCAA imposed a postseason ban on Oklahoma State, however Cunningham announced on June 22 that he was still attending Oklahoma State rather than sign with another school or the NBA G League. National team career Cunningham played for the United States at the 2019 FIBA Under-19 World Cup in Heraklion, Greece. In seven games, he averaged 11.7 points, 5.7 assists and 4.9 rebounds per game, helping his team win the gold medal. In the finals, Cunningham led all scorers with 21 points, seven rebounds, and seven assists in a 93‚Äì79 win over Mali. Personal life Cunningham's father Keith Cunningham played college football for Texas Tech. His older brother Cannen played college basketball for SMU, surpassing the school record for games played, before spending one professional season in Poland.

Description Penn Pier, part of the first phase of the park, in July 2019 Located on the site of the former Pennsylvania Avenue and Fountain Avenue Landfills, Shirley Chisholm State Park covers two peninsulas south of the Belt Parkway. The western peninsula, between Fresh Creek to the west and Hendrix Creek to the east, is located just south of Starrett City. The eastern peninsula, between Hendrix Creek to the west and Spring Creek to the east, is located south of Gateway Center and the neighborhood of Spring Creek. The park is named after Shirley Chisholm, who represented the area as the first black U.S. congresswoman, and later became the first black female to seek a major-party nomination for U.S. president. At , the park is the largest state park in New York City. In addition, it is the third-largest park in Brooklyn, behind Marine Park and Prospect Park. The highest point in the modern-day state park is on the Fountain Avenue Landfill at 140 feet above sea level. The initial phase cost $20 million and includes of bike paths and hiking trails, waterfront access points, and a pier at the head of Pennsylvania Avenue on the western peninsula. Shirley Chisholm State Park also includes a \\"bike library\\" operated by Bike New York, which allows park users to borrow refurbished bikes for free, and a mural of Chisholm created by Brooklyn artist Danielle Mastrion. The second phase of the park opened a few months later with an entrance on Fountain Avenue, as well as additional educational programming.. The park is expected to be completed by 2021. Site history The Pennsylvania Avenue Landfill in 2017, prior to the park's establishment Prior to development, the site of this park was mostly marshland and water. However, in 1930, Spring Creek Park and the Shore Parkway portion of the Belt Parkway were proposed by Robert Moses, along with several other parks and highways. Accordingly, in August 1942, the New York City Planning Commission and Board of Estimate approved a project to dump landfill on the site as part of the city's post-World War II program, in order to create parkland on the site. Filling at the Pennsylvania Avenue Landfill began in 1956, while the Fountain Avenue Landfill began operations in 1961 or 1963. At the height of usage, more than 8,000 tons of trash arrived daily at these two landfills, with nearly 40 percent of the city's refuse. Throughout the landfills' operation, waste oil and other hazardous materials such as PCBs were dumped in the landfills, resulting in the spread of respiratory diseases among residents of nearby Starrett City. In 1972, the Gateway National Recreation Area was established by the National Park Service around Jamaica Bay. The two landfill sites were included in the Gateway Area in 1974. As part of the creation of the preserve, the Department of Sanitation was contractually bound to close and cap both landfills by 1985. By 1974, plans emerged to eventually turn the landfills into parks. The Pennsylvania Avenue Landfill was closed in 1979, at a time when it was receiving 1,000 to 2,000 tons of municipal waste every day. The Fountain Avenue Landfill was closed in December 1985. The landfills were declared a Superfund site around 1990, and in 1991 the New York City Department of Environmental Protection (NYCDEP) assumed responsibility for the cleanup of the landfills. In 1995 Jamaica Bay residents, concerned about health implications of the runoff from the landfills, reached an agreement with the city for the dumps' rehabilitation. In 2002, the New York City Department of Environmental Protection commenced site remediation at a cost of 235 million including the installation of a below ground barrier and an impermeable cap to support future use. Following the opening of Gateway Center mall on the site in 2002, The Related Companies constructed an addition to Spring Creek Park circumscribing the mall, opening on May 2, 2003. Afterward, the first tree seeds on the site were planted in the Pennsylvania Avenue Landfill with a density of . Over of fresh soil was spread across the landfill at a depth of up to , and some 35,000 plantings and grassland species were placed in the soil. Hendrix Creek was also cleaned up by the NYCDEP. Development The Fountain Avenue Landfill (pictured) will be developed into the second portion of the park. In his State of the State address in January 2018, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced his intent to build a state park along of the Jamaica Bay coastline, adjoining the Pennsylvania Avenue and Fountain Avenue landfills. The site would receive a $15 million renovation with paths, concession areas, restrooms, and recreational facilities. The state would work with the city and National Park Service on the project. The state park was dedicated to Shirley Chisholm that September. Another $20 million was allotted to the park in April 2019. On July 2, 2019, the governor and other public officials representing the park site attended a ribbon-cutting ceremony at the Shirley Chisholm State Park, officially opening the park to the public. The first portion of the park comprises the Pennsylvania Avenue Landfill; the second portion, the Fountain Avenue Landfill opened a few months later. The park is expected to be completed by 2021.

Textual variants in manuscripts arise when a copyist makes deliberate or inadvertent alterations to a text that is being reproduced. An abbreviated list of textual variants in this particular book is given in this article below. Most of the variations are not significant and some common alterations include the deletion, rearrangement, repetition, or replacement of one or more words when the copyist's eye returns to a similar word in the wrong location of the original text. If their eye skips to an earlier word, they may create a repetition (error of dittography). If their eye skips to a later word, they may create an omission. They may resort to performing a rearranging of words to retain the overall meaning without compromising the context. In other instances, the copyist may add text from memory from a similar or parallel text in another location. Otherwise, they may also replace some text of the original with an alternative reading. Spellings occasionally change. Synonyms may be substituted. A pronoun may be changed into a proper noun (such as \\"he said\\" becoming \\"Jesus said\\").

Early life and career Quatrano was raised in Fairfield, Connecticut but spent summers on her mother's family farm near Cartersville, Georgia. After graduating from the University of Vermont, Quatrano worked in restaurant management before enrolling at the California Culinary Academy in San Francisco. In culinary school, Quatrano was influenced by the California cuisine of the San Francisco Bay Area, and she apprenticed for Judy Rodgers. She also met her husband and business partner, Clifford Harrison, a fellow culinary school student. After culinary school, Quatrano and Harrison moved to New York City, where they worked together in several restaurants, including Le Petite Ferme, Grolier, and Conrad's Bar & Grill. Summerland, Bacchanalia, and Star Provisions In 1992, Quatrano and Harrison moved to Georgia, taking ownership of Quatrano's family farm, named Summerland.

It officially opened in April 1962, and fell into disrepair in the late 1970s after the end of the space race. History = First years = When the building opened in April 1962, besides the bank, the top floor had a restaurant called the Sky Room. Guests could enter and watch space launches from nearby Cape Canaveral. However, when the building was finished in 1961, it had a major flaw; there was no elevator to the upper levels, which ultimately lead to the Sky Room closing permanently in 1963. The issue was resolved that same year when an express elevator was added to the building. After the addition of the elevator, Ramon's Rainbow Room opened up at the former Sky Room space. Ramon's was a restaurant and a nightclub tenant that featured food, music, and an atmosphere which proved popular in the era. It also hosted astronauts, celebrities, and politicians on special occasions. And it even often drew crowds, too. It was known for its cocktails, jazz music, and good food. = Downfall = In 1970, Ramon's closed its restaurant at the Glass Bank, and then that same year Marby's Rainbow Room opened. But it was proven unpopular that Marby's left the top floor in 1972, and no new tenants took over the top floor. Renovations In 1983, an attorney named Frank Wolfe purchased the top of the building. He then added a windowless penthouse, and converted it into a brutalist style by reinforcing the corners of the building with concrete.  Bank closure  In the late 1980s, due to the savings and loan crisis, The First Federal Savings & Loan Association of Cocoa was declared insolvent and was immediately closed by regulators, at that point, First Federal was the last original tenant at the Glass Bank, twenty-years after its existence. Later years In the ensuing decades, damage to the lower floors would be sustained by hurricanes, especially Hurricane Frances. This led to the remaining tenants including Space Coast Credit Union, and a gym, to vacate the spaces, leading to the building becoming abandoned. The Glass Bank Condominium Association (GBCA), which owned the entire building sans the penthouse, wanted to restore the building to its original form. Frank Wolfe refused, and as the stalemate dragged on, the city began fining the co-owners $200 a day. In 2013, the GBCA sued Frank Wolfe for money owed to the city and to the condominium for repairs.}} In response, Frank Wolfe countersued. To break the legal stalemate, the city urged the GBCA and Wolfe to agree to demolition, in exchange for waiving fines. The GBCA agreed, but Wolfe did not; asking the city to buy the penthouse instead if they wanted it to be torn down. The city refused to purchase it, and moved to demolish the structure regardless of his wishes. In January 2014, the city sought and obtained approval for demolition, which shut down power and water to the penthouse floors. On February 4, 2014, the GBCA prevailed in its lawsuit against Wolfe, with the court ruling in their favor. The next day, Wolfe's appeal of the approval was rejected. That afternoon, Wolfe shot and killed himself in front of the Glass Bank. =Demolition= Wolfe's estate cooperated with the decision to demolish the building and in April 2014, the city was granted final permission to perform it. In December of that year, demolition began with asbestos being removed from the building. On February 2, 2015, the building was demolished.

Textual variants in manuscripts arise when a copyist makes deliberate or inadvertent alterations to a text that is being reproduced. An abbreviated list of textual variants in this particular book is given in this article below. Most of the variations are not significant and some common alterations include the deletion, rearrangement, repetition, or replacement of one or more words when the copyist's eye returns to a similar word in the wrong location of the original text. If their eye skips to an earlier word, they may create a repetition (error of dittography). If their eye skips to a later word, they may create an omission. They may resort to performing a rearranging of words to retain the overall meaning without compromising the context. In other instances, the copyist may add text from memory from a similar or parallel text in another location. Otherwise, they may also replace some text of the original with an alternative reading. Spellings occasionally change. Synonyms may be substituted. A pronoun may be changed into a proper noun (such as \\"he said\\" becoming \\"Jesus said\\").

She studied physics at the Institute of Solid State Physics in Russia and earned her PhD in 1989.  Research and career  In 1990 Grigorieva moved to Nottingham with her husband Andre Geim. She visited the University of Oxford, University of Cambridge and Imperial College London to deliver seminars on her PhD research. Eventually, Gregorieva joined the University of Bristol as a postdoctoral researcher. She moved to Nijmegen where she worked as a laboratory assistant. Grigorieva suggested to Andre Geim that he used a frog to demonstrate magnetic levitation, for which Geim won the Ig Nobel Prize. She joined the University of Manchester in 2001, where she works in the Condensed Matter Physics group. When she joined the group, she started studying the adhesive mechanisms of gecko's feet. In 2003 she created a gecko-like adhesive that is self-cleaning and re-attachable. Grigorieva is a member of the Graphene Council. Grigorieva is a Professor of Physics at the University of Manchester and Director of the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council Centre for Doctoral Training in Science and the Applications of Graphene. She works on the electronic and magnetic properties of two- dimensional materials. She is interested in superconducting materials and the application of graphene in spintronics. In 2013 was the first to demonstrate that graphene could be magnetic through the use of non-magnetic atoms and vacancies. Defects in graphene carry Spin-¬Ω magnetic moments. In 2015 she demonstrated that it is possible to switch the magnetism in graphene on and off. She created small bubbles out of graphene and showed that they can withstand pressures of 200 megapascals, which is greater that in the deep ocean. To measure the pressure inside a graphene bubble, they used atomic force microscopy and a monolayer of boron nitride. Grigorieva used graphene as a filter to remove subatomic particles, including taking protons from heavy water. This includes removing deuterium for the cleaning of nuclear waste. = Awards and honours = * 2017 One of the most highly cited researchers in physics * 2019 Institute of Physics David Tabor Medal and Prize = Personal life = Grigorieva is married to the physicist Andre Geim, with whom she has a daughter.

It took place at the National Mall and included presentations of U.S. military vehicles, an address by President Donald Trump from the Lincoln Memorial, flyovers by military aircraft, and a fireworks display. The event occurred alongside pre-existing annual Independence Day events such as the National Independence Day Parade and the PBS-televised A Capitol Fourth concert. It was the first time a U.S. president had addressed a crowd at the National Mall on Independence Day in 68 years. There was controversy leading up to the event. Trump's critics expressed concern that the celebration would be a political event reminiscent of his campaign rallies, especially in the early stages of his 2020 re- election campaign. Concerns were also raised over the involvement of the military, the distribution of VIP tickets to donors and members of the Republican Party, as well as the cost of the event. Trump's speech focused largely on praising the United States' cultural and military accomplishments and featured themes of American exceptionalism and patriotism; it avoided contemporary political topics.  Background  Trump attending the 2017 Bastille Day military parade in Paris, France During a presidential visit to France in July 2017, President Donald Trump attended the Bastille Day military parade in Paris alongside French president Emmanuel Macron. Following the parade, Trump expressed admiration for the event and said he wanted the United States to \\"top it\\" with a similar, military-focused event. Trump proposed a military parade be held in Washington on Veterans Day in 2018, in honor of the centenary of World War I's conclusion. However, the proposal was rejected due to cost concerns. In February 2019, Trump announced on Twitter plans for a \\"Salute to America\\" celebration on Independence Day, promising entertainment, a \\"major\\" fireworks display and \\"an address by your favorite President, me!\\" It was later revealed that this speech would be given from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. Trump would become the first president to speak there since Harry Truman marked the 175th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in an address from the National Mall on Independence Day, 1951. The National Park Service stated that Trump's event was not expected to conflict with other traditional Independence Day events held at the Capitol like the National Independence Day Parade, the televised A Capitol Fourth concert, and its associated fireworks display‚Äî although, due to Salute to America, fireworks were launched from West Potomac Park, rather than the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool. The producers of A Capitol Fourth distanced themselves from the president's planned festivities, emphasizing they were an independent and separate event. Due to Trump's presence, the Federal Aviation Administration suspended flights at Reagan Airport during the event.  Funding  Preparation for the event at the Lincoln Memorial The Department of Defense and the White House have not confirmed the total cost of the event. As of July 11, 2019, a \\"rough total\\" cost was reported to be $5.4 million. It was reported that $2.45 million in entrance and recreation fees were diverted from the National Park Service to cover logistical and medical services‚Äîfunds normally intended for maintenance and improvements to national parks. D.C. mayor Muriel Bowser said the city's additional security costs for the event amounted to $1.7 million, not including police management of demonstrations. Funding was provided by the District's Emergency Planning and Security Fund; a congressional committee was subsequently formed on July 12 to seek reimbursement of this fund by the White House. The military's role in Salute to America cost the Department of Defense $1.2 million, including the cost of flying hours for the aerial demonstrations and logistics, particularly transportation for the two M1 Abrams tanks, the two M2 Bradley IFVs, and related equipment. The Pentagon stated that this funding came from training budgets, but did not provide a breakdown of the figure, causing speculation that $1.2 million is a low estimate. The Department of Defense noted it has a \\"long history of showcasing military assets to the country\\" and spends comparable amounts of money, if not more, during events such as Fleet Week. For example, the 2017 San Francisco Fleet Week cost $1.8 million, and the 2018 Los Angeles Fleet Week cost $1.6 million. U.S. Park Police collaborate with the District of Columbia National Guard for the Salute to America event Fireworks by Grucci produced the fireworks display, while Phantom Fireworks donated $750,000 in additional shells; both companies donated a combined $1.3 million in pyrotechnics for the show. The display was held in tandem with annual Independence Day fireworks produced by Garden State Fireworks under contract with the National Park Service. It was subsequently promoted as surpassing the Bicentennial fireworks as one of the largest fireworks displays in Washington, D.C., in terms of size and length. = Lobbying concerns = ABC News reported that Phantom Fireworks CEO Bruce Zoldan had met with Trump in May 2019 to discuss proposed expansions of U.S. trade tariffs against China that would have added tariffs on pyrotechnics. China is the largest producer of pyrotechnics in the world, and the majority of fireworks in the U.S. are imported from there. At the G20 summit the following month, Trump announced he would resume trade talks with China and postpone additional tariffs. It was insinuated that Phantom's donation to Salute to America's fireworks show was influenced by Trump's decision on tariffs‚Äîa sign of successful lobbying. In an interview with WTOP-FM, Zoldan stated that discussions regarding Phantom's involvement in the show pre-dated the meeting by two months and that the meeting was a general discussion on tariffs, not from the perspective of any specific industry.  Participants  Trump addressing the crowd at the Lincoln Memorial. He is flanked by then-Acting Secretary of Defense Mark Esper (left) and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Joseph Dunford (right) Salute to America featured fireworks, seven flyovers, and music, as well as the first address from the National Mall on Independence Day by a sitting president in 68 years. Trump's address honored the history of the United States and praised the achievements of historical American figures, including George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, Betsy Ross, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, Amelia Earhart, Douglas MacArthur, Dwight D. Eisenhower, Martin Luther King Jr., Jackie Robinson, and John Glenn. Special guests included Florida hurricane volunteer Tina \\"Angel\\" Belcher, cancer biologist Emil J. Freireich, Civil rights movement hero Clarence Henderson, and flight director for NASA's Apollo 11 mission Gene Kranz. Silent Drill Platoon performing at Salute to America Salute to America featured an overarching theme of American military appreciation and patriotism. Trump requested the inclusion of tanks, and that the chiefs of the Air Force, Army, Marines, and Navy stand next to him on stage during the event. However, due to preparations beginning only weeks prior to the occasion, most of the joint chiefs were on leave or traveling and were not available to attend. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Dunford Jr., was available and attended, joining the president and then-Acting Secretary of Defense Mark Esper on stage halfway through the president's address. Trump had wanted tanks to be part of the parade, but was told they were too heavy and could \\"tear up the streets\\". Instead, two Abrams tanks and two Bradley armored personnel carriers were moved into place for a static display. The United States Marine Drum and Bugle Corps at the Salute to America. Department of Defense footage of the flyovers during Salute to America The United States Marine Corps Silent Drill Platoon performed exhibition drills and the Marine Drum and Bugle Corps, Army Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps and the Army Band (Pershing's Own) provided musical performances. The Army Band performed several renditions during Trump's address, including \\"Semper Paratus\\", \\"The U.S. Air Force\\", \\"Anchors Aweigh\\", \\"Marines' Hymn\\", and \\"The Army Goes Rolling Along\\" (all of which make up the Armed Forces Medley). Military equipment representing each service branch of the United States Armed Forces were showcased and demonstrated. Two M1A2 Abrams tanks and two M2 Bradley IFVs from the 3rd Infantry Division were put on stationary display around the Lincoln Memorial for the public while aircraft representing each service branch conducted flyovers during Trump's address. Trump introduced the Coast Guard first, represented by two HH-60 Jayhawks and an HH-65 Dolphin helicopter from Coast Guard Station, Annapolis, Maryland. Subsequent flyovers included: a B-2 Spirit from the 509th Bomb Wing escorted by two F-22 Raptors from the 1st Fighter Wing, two F-35 Joint Strike Fighters from VFA-147 and two F/A-18 Hornets from VFA-37 together in diamond formation, two V-22 Ospreys from HMX-1, and four AH-64 Apache helicopters from the 101st Combat Aviation Brigade. Presidential aircraft, particularly the Air Force One aircraft and the next-generation VH-92 Marine One, also participated. The aerial demonstrations were followed up by a performance by the Navy's Blue Angels flight demonstration squadron.  Attendance and media coverage  A perimeter was constructed around the Lincoln Memorial with wire fencing spanning the Reflecting Pool to separate the ticketed areas intended for VIP spectators from the public. VIP tickets were distributed to the Republican National Committee (RNC), government officials, GOP donors, and other political allies. Politico reported that some donors and Republican Party members were reluctant to attend the event as they were already on vacation elsewhere. It also reported that lotteries were being held to give away blocks of 10 tickets each to White House employees. This is a common practice for White House events, but not normally in such a large quantity. Concerns over the attendance at the event were compared to the Trump administration's claims regarding crowd size and viewership of his 2017 inauguration. Official estimates of the number of attendees were not immediately available. Multiple photographs taken during the event show large crowds both within the guest section and of the public on the National Mall, including tourists and general event-goers. Weather affected the event; rainstorms passed through the area, while temperature inversion caused the smoke from the fireworks display to accumulate, partially obscuring spectators' views of the show. The White House's livestream of Salute to America Of the major cable news channels, only Fox News Channel agreed to air continual live coverage, with CNN and MSNBC initially declining in favor of previously scheduled encore programming. C-SPAN also aired the event. The news departments of the Big Three television networks relegated live coverage to their respective digital platforms. Both CNN and Fox News carried Trump's speech given in front of the Lincoln Memorial live. CNN's coverage of the event averaged 1.5 million viewers, with 353,000 viewers among adults 25‚Äì54 years old‚Äîa key demographic for advertisers. MSNBC's coverage garnered a total audience of 374,000 viewers and 42,000 among 25‚Äì54 year olds. Fox News had the largest viewership, with an average 4.6 million viewers and 793,000 among adults aged 25‚Äì54. This beat CNN and MSNBC's combined viewership in both categories and topped NBC's prime time coverage of the Macy's Independence Day fireworks show from New York City, which averaged 3.8 million total viewers‚Äîits lowest ratings in four years. It was Fox News Channel's highest Independence Day audience since its founding in October 1996.  Reception  Trump's supporters and allies considered the event to be a display of the president's pride in the country and its military. Comparisons were drawn to \\"Honor America Day\\"‚Äîa 1970 Independence Day rally at the Capitol in support of Richard Nixon, in the wake of controversy over the invasion of Cambodia and the Kent State shootings. He appeared via a pre-recorded speech to attendees. That event also faced opposition, notably by anti-Vietnam War protesters and other protesters smoking cannabis in support of its legalization. = Pre-event concerns and criticism = Before the event, Michelle Cottle of The New York Times, former House Republican David Jolly, and radio host Charlie Sykes accused Trump of turning the \\"non-partisan\\" Independence Day holiday into a political event‚Äîco-opting the celebration to promote his 2020 presidential re-election campaign. Pre-event concerns were also expressed over the prominent incorporation of the military; retired lieutenant general David Barno told Politico that Salute to America \\"looks like it's becoming much more of a Republican Party event‚Äîa political event about the president‚Äîthan a national celebration of the Fourth of July\\" and that it was \\"absolutely obscene\\" for Trump to \\"[use] the armed forces in a political ploy for his reelection campaign.\\" Some military and Pentagon officials had raised similar concerns. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington noted that Department of Defense rules forbid military members from participating in political events and that the Hatch Act could also potentially apply. Some media outlets also reported on the potential damage military vehicles could cause to local roads. It was later confirmed that while military vehicles would be featured during the event, they would be parked on the National Mall and not parading. Democratic Senator Tom Udall argued it was \\"unacceptable that the Interior Department is failing to inform Congress about how it plans to spend taxpayer money to fund the president's lavish July 4th plans, which reportedly include special access to the National Mall for the politically connected.\\" Trump downplayed these concerns, saying that the event would cost \\"very little compared to what it is worth\\". The Republican National Committee defended its distribution of tickets, citing it as common practice for the incumbent party's committee to distribute tickets to events of this nature. Journalist and writer Jeff Greenfield noted that prior presidents had given speeches on Independence Day and political parties have used the holiday as a platform since their inception. He added that the inclusion of military equipment could be excused as an attempt to \\"emulate Thomas Jefferson\\" in 1801 rather than an authoritarian celebration of militarism \\"more common to Moscow and Pyongyang.\\" However, Greenfield did argue that Trump, with his affinity for \\"over-the-top celebrations and honors\\", was \\"wreathing himself\\" in the monuments of the Capitol, \\"the most potent symbols of American history ... without any appreciation for the history that made that whole landscape possible.\\" = Protests = The National Park Service issued a permit allowing the activist organization Code Pink to display a Donald Trump baby balloon during the event. It was grounded and did not contain helium to enable it to float. The group also brought the animatronic Dump Trump sculpture‚Äîa caricature of Trump using his phone while sitting on a golden toilet. Around 5:30 pm local, an hour before Trump's speech, two members of the Revolutionary Communist Party were arrested by Secret Service officers after scuffles broke out with counter-protesters during a flag burning protest in front of the White House. One of those arrested was charged with malicious burning and felony assault on a police officer, and the other with obstructing a police investigation and resisting arrest. The Secret Service said the flag burning display occurred \\"outside the limits of a permit issued by the National Park Service.\\" = Post-event = Trump addressing the crowd at the Lincoln Memorial. Two M2 Bradleys are showcased. David Smith of The Guardian acknowledged that Trump's 47-minute speech \\"did not fulfill his critics' worst fears of a politically partisan, campaign-style rally\\", and mostly avoided politics in favor of \\"a heroic version of American military history\\". However, Smith suggested that the event as a whole did \\"provide the bombastic show of military might that had been widely predicted\\" and noted the event resembled a Trump campaign rally because many audience members chanted pro-Trump slogans, wore Make America Great Again hats and held \\"Trump 2020\\" signs. He observed that \\"in a city that projects power through monuments, statues and its own Capitol, critics said it was the moment Trump went full Roman emperor, turning a traditionally nonpartisan day of events into a vanity project.\\" Trump mentions \\"airports\\" Trump was criticized for making incorrect statements about the American Revolutionary War in a section of the speech, recounting that the Continental Army \\"took over the airports\\"‚Äîairplanes were yet to be invented‚Äîand had \\"nothing but victory\\" in the Battle of Baltimore, which took place during the War of 1812, not the Revolutionary War. Trump attributed the \\"airports\\" gaffe to his teleprompter malfunctioning and being difficult to read in the rain. Some Canadian news outlets took exception to Trump referencing Alexander Graham Bell's invention of the telephone as a result of the United States' \\"unleashed\\" \\"culture of discovery\\"; Bell was Scottish-born and spent time in both Canada and the United States while developing the telephone, though he did file his first patent on the telephone in the United States. In a letter to Trump after the event, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser asked for reimbursement of the city's expenses, saying Salute to America had exhausted D.C.'s Emergency Planning and Security Fund, a federally funded reserve account intended to reimburse the city for extra security and anti-terrorism measures during large federal events. She said the costs of \\"your additional July 4th holiday activities and subsequent First Amendment demonstrations\\" had depleted the account and would soon leave it in the red. On July 8, three Democratic members of the Senate Appropriations Committee requested the Government Accountability Office investigate the costs and legality of the event. Also on July 8, Trump announced his intentions to hold a second Salute to America event in 2020, although, in 2020, the occurrence of the event was called into question due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, with at least ten lawmakers having asked President Trump to cancel the planned second celebration. The administration nevertheless held the 2020 Salute to America on July 4, 2020.

They all featured cards known as 'stops' or hocs: cards that ended a sequence and gave the one who played it the advantage of being able to start a new sequence. In some games, hocs attracted bonuses. The best known of the hoc games is Nain Jaune or Yellow Dwarf, which is a classic French family game still played today.Les jeux de hocs on the Academy of Forgotten Games website. Retrieved 2 Jun 2019.  History  The first game known to feature hocs was Hoc itself, a multi- stake, vying game sometimes called Hoc Mazarin and named after Cardinal Mazarin who was known to greatly favour it when at the court of Versailles in the mid-1600s. The concept spread to other 17th and 18th century games including Poque, Comete, Manille, Nain Jaune and Lindor. Manille and Nain Jaune/Lindor are still played.  Types of hoc  Four types of 'stop' card or hoc are distinguished: * End-of-run hoc. The end-of-run hoc (hoc de fin de suite) is the highest card in a run, typically a King. It completes the row of cards. The player playing it calls \\"hoc!\\" and starts a new sequence with a card of his choice. * Incidental hoc. An incidental hoc (hoc accidentel) is one that occurs because the next card in the sequence is not held by any player, e.g. because it is concealed within the talon or stock of cards left face down on the table. The player of the last card of the run calls \\"hoc!\\" and starts a new sequence as before. * Permanent hoc. Within a particular game, certain cards may be designated as permanent hocs, for example, the Q, J and 10 in Nain Jaune. When such a card is played, the player announces \\"hoc!\\" and begins a new sequence. * Chief Hoc. In some games a 'Chief Hoc' is designated. This has special powers: it may be used as a wild card in place of any other card in the pack and the holder may be allowed to withhold it even if it is the next card of a sequence. In Nain Jaune, the 7 is the Chief Hoc; in Hoc Mazarin there are six chief hocs.  References   Literature  * Parlett, David (1991).

In an interview with Teen Vogue, Miller said that she was inspired to write the song when someone commented on a picture she posted of herself to slut-shame her. Miller's co-writer looked up the word 'slut' on the Urban Dictionary and one of the definitions defined it as an acronym for \\"Sweet, little, unforgettable thing\\". Miller thought that women feel better hearing this and said that \\"when women are called a slut for absolutely no reason\\", the song will make them feel better about themselves.

Textual variants in manuscripts arise when a copyist makes deliberate or inadvertent alterations to a text that is being reproduced. An abbreviated list of textual variants in this particular book is given in this article below. Most of the variations are not significant and some common alterations include the deletion, rearrangement, repetition, or replacement of one or more words when the copyist's eye returns to a similar word in the wrong location of the original text. If their eye skips to an earlier word, they may create a repetition (error of dittography). If their eye skips to a later word, they may create an omission. They may resort to performing a rearranging of words to retain the overall meaning without compromising the context. In other instances, the copyist may add text from memory from a similar or parallel text in another location. Otherwise, they may also replace some text of the original with an alternative reading.

such as Saint Patrick, who suffered abuse for his evangelizationSaint Patrick's Confessio \\\\- and unto death - such as Mateo Correa Magallanes, who died rather than violate the Seal of the Confessional in the Catholic Church.

A member of the Cris√°lida Popular Library of Gender, Sexual Affective Diversity, and Human Rights of Tucum√°n, she was a pioneer in the public visibility of the trans community in the social sphere of San Miguel de Tucum√°n. From 2012 to 2014, she conducted training and sensitization of the police forces of Tucum√°n Province for the full application of the Gender Identity Law. Biography Mariana Alarc√≥n was born in Tucum√°n Province and grew up in the San Miguel neighborhood of Juan XXIII, nicknamed \\"La Bombilla\\" for its high rates of social violence. She began to manifest her trans identity at a very young age, enduring discrimination that led her to abandon her studies after finishing primary school. =Career= In 2011 Alarc√≥n was approached to participate in the Cris√°lida Popular Library of Gender, Sexual Affective Diversity, and Human Rights of Tucum√°n. Through Cris√°lida, she advocated for sanction of the Gender Identity Law project, which was enacted on 24 May 2012 as Law 26.743. Based on this, Alarc√≥n was one of the first transgender people to have access to the correction of identification documents to reflect her gender identity. Beginning in September 2012, she organized a space for more trans people to be advised on the steps to be taken to carry out the process, as well as including applicants from the community in national Employment Management training. In Cris√°lida she assumed the role of project coordinator for 2013‚Äì2014, taking charge of the library's Trans Labor Inclusion Line, where she coordinated education and job training for members of the community. She focused her visibility work on sensitizing society as a trainer, setting up the 2012 to 2016 \\"Right to Identity\\" workshop for the Tucum√°n Security Forces, and teaching the workshop until her death in 2014. She also led the aforementioned workshop at the National University of Tucum√°n's Faculty of Philosophy and Letters and for the Ombudsman of Tucum√°n. She also participated in the university volunteering project \\"Youth, Sexual and Reproductive Rights, and Diversity\\" (DSyR) and the publication of its results. Recognitions After Mariana Alarc√≥n's death in 2014, following the guidelines of Law 26.657 and Law 26.743, an assembly began for articulation of the topics of sexual diversity and gender identities with a mental health perspective. In honor of her work, in 2016 this was designated a Mariana Alarc√≥n Friendly Node, consisting of a First Listening space that provides non-clinical care for the LGBT community, their families, reference groups, and the communities in general. It provides guidance and support to those who attend, promoting links with state services.

Early life  This close group of friends first met each other in the late 1990s through the Compton Jr. Posse, a non- profit organization in Richland Farms. The Jr. Posse introduced the group to the equestrian lifestyle and horseback riding. The Jr. Posse was founded in Compton by Mayisha Akbar in a semi-rural area of the city, where the organization has been home to African-American horseback riders since the 1980's. Many of the members of the Compton Cowboys found their way into the Jr. Posse through information and encouragement from friends and family members, and through interacting with horse-riders they had seen in their neighborhoods. Compton was a rough neighborhood, and they found horse riding to be a positive alternative to other paths common in the area. Gang violence and drugs were not an uncommon route for kids to find themselves in. The Cowboys found an interest and lifestyle that had a positive effect on them and others in the community they came across.  Daily Life and Competition  The Compton Cowboys provide a collective effort to maintain and take care of the horses. Typical work days include cleaning the stables, getting fresh feed to the horses, riding and training, and other types of labor and care. The group also competes in different types of events. One of their goals and hopes is to break into the rodeo circuits and create an African American presence among the predominantly white competition participants. The Cowboys continue to compete in events and also are invited to perform in parades in the Los Angeles area. Members of the group have been known to excel in events such as bull riding and English Hunter-Jumper.  Funding and Resources  The group operates but does so with a scarcity of resources. They rely on donations from sponsors and alumni, support from the local community, and government grants. These resources help support the cost of the horses on the ranch. Maintaining an equestrian organization can be very expensive. Typical horses used for what the Cowboys do cost from $10,000 to $50,000, but they sometimes rely on auctioned horses that cost around $200. These horses have often been victims of abuse and neglect. Members have sufficient riding gear and equipment but can often be seen riding their horses bareback in the community. They say like many other equestrians do, that riding bareback builds a strong bond with the horse. The Cowboys have integrated this into part of their unique style.  Their Mission  The Compton Cowboy‚Äôs motto is ‚Äúthe streets raised us, the horses saved us.‚Äù The team works to provide an alternative route and positive role models to inner-city youth. This effort helps give youth a path away from gangs and crime. As alumni of the youth program, they work closely with the Compton Junior Equestrians to provide positive influence and mentorship through horseback riding and equestrian culture. The group also leads efforts to combat stereotypes of African Americans through their media presence. They represent past African Americans and a growing number of African Americans today who have been underrepresented in the rodeo and cowboy world, and they combat other ways African Americans have been misrepresented in the media and in popular culture. Currently, the Compton Cowboys are working to release a documentary type film, highlighting who they are and the goals they are trying to achieve in combating racial stereotypes and related social issues.  Combating Stereotypes  The Cowboys work to create a presence that challenges African-American stereotypes. These efforts include combating stereotypes associated with gang violence and other harmful but common portrayals. The media rarely portrays Cowboys as African Americans. But after the American Civil War, there were an estimated 5000-8000 African American Cowboys. Cowboys are a central part of American history and culture. Combating this stereotype is one goal of theirs because doing so reflects and uncovers an unrealized and underrepresented core of American history and culture. By some estimates, in the 19th century one in four cowboys was of African-American descent.

It is one of the oldest stone bridges in the city and carries Palace Embankment across the Swan Canal. The preceding bridge on the site was of wooden construction, built in the 1710s over the Lebedinka, a shallow watercourse flowing between the Moyka and Neva Rivers, at the point at which it entered the Neva. With the construction of the Swan Canal replacing the Lebedinka, the bridge continued to operate, until being replaced with a stone bridge in 1768. The bridge was alternately known as the Swan Bridge, the Stone Swan Bridge, and finally the Upper Swan Bridge, distinguishing it from the Lower Swan Bridge at the southern end of the canal at its juncture with the Moyka. Structural faults were identified as early as the mid-nineteenth century, but repairs were only carried out in the 1920s. These left the appearance of the bridge unaltered, and it still retains its original form. It has been designated an object of historical and cultural heritage of federal significance. Location and design The Upper Swan Bridge is in Dvortsovy Municipal Okrug, part of the Tsentralny District of the city. It crosses the Swan Canal, one of the city's oldest, at the point at which the canal joins the Neva River, and carries Palace Embankment between the areas of the Field of Mars to the west, and the Summer Garden to the east. It comprises a single- span arched stone construction long and wide, and carries both foot and vehicle traffic. It is one of two bridges that currently span the Swan Canal, the other being the Lower Swan Bridge at the southern end of the canal at its juncture with the Moyka River. Despite several restorations, its appearance has remained almost unchanged from its construction in stone in 1768 to the present day. It is one of the oldest stone bridges in the city. History The view north along the Swan Canal. The Upper Swan Bridge and the junction with the Neva are visible beyond a wooden bridge that has not survived to the present day. An 1839 work by . Over the course of the eighteenth century four different wooden bridges spanned the Swan Canal. The Upper Swan Bridge began as a wooden construction across the Lebedinka, a shallow watercourse, at the point it enters the Neva. It was built between 1711 and 1715, and was named the Swan Bridge. The wooden bridge was replaced in 1768 by a single-span stone bridge, with construction overseen by engineer T. I. Nasonov. This was part of a larger scale overhaul of the embankments along the Neva, which saw them reinforced with granite. As designed the supporting pillars and arch of the bridge were of rubble slab lined with granite, with the parapets of solid granite. The abutments were fitted with gas lanterns, but these were removed at some point, presumably by the late nineteenth century. At some point between 1836 and 1846 the bridge was renamed the Stone Swan Bridge, with the terms Upper and Lower Swan Bridges being in use since at least 1849 to distinguish the bridges at the northern and southern end of the canal respectively. Surveys of the Upper Swan Bridge between 1840 and 1845 revealed movement in the bridge supports and the deformation of its arched vault. Proposals were drawn up for a reconstruction of the bridge in 1847, which envisaged its replacement with a brick arch raised a metre above the river level. This proposal was never implemented, and a similar proposal by engineer K. V. Yefimev in 1908 ultimately came to nothing. The bridge finally underwent repairs between 1927 and 1928, with the fitting of monolithic reinforced concrete by engineer L. A. Krushelnitsky, and the restoration of its granite cladding in 1931. These repairs were carried out with the object of retaining the bridge's design and architectural appearance. Further restoration was carried out in 2003 as part of a general series of works on the canal. Cracks in its foundations were repaired. The bridge has been described as uniting Palace Embankment and the fence of the Summer Garden into a single architectural ensemble, and has been designated an object of historical and cultural heritage of federal significance.\\" Notes a.

As of 2019, it was defined in 21 CFR ¬ß 558.3. History and synopsis The Animal Drug Availability Act 1996 introduced the term of new animal drug, which should be applied in combination with traditional animal feeds such as hay and oats and barley. The FDA found it expedient to subdivide this term into two categories, according to the withdrawal period necessary to be observed prior to slaughter for animals about to enter the human food chain; and Prior to the enactment, only two categories of animal feed drugs existed: over-the-counter or prescription. The ADAA introduced Veterinary Feed Directive drugs. Medicated feeds are differentiated in ¬ß 558.3 from VFD rations, in that a licensed veterinarian is not required to supervise the feed product. Medicated feeds are available over-the-counter from agricultural suppliers. New animal drugs are the functional ingredients for medicated feeds. The distinction between medicated feeds and VFD feeds is somewhat flexible. On 1 January 2017, veterinary oversight was added to a significant number of antibiotic drugs in animal feed, so as to ensure that they are \\"medically necessary\\". The VFD label was applied to, among others, chlortetracycline, hygromycin, penicillin, lincomycin, oxytetracycline, tylosin, virginiamycin and neomycin.

Textual variants in manuscripts arise when a copyist makes deliberate or inadvertent alterations to a text that is being reproduced. An abbreviated list of textual variants in this particular book is given in this article below. Most of the variations are not significant and some common alterations include the deletion, rearrangement, repetition, or replacement of one or more words when the copyist's eye returns to a similar word in the wrong location of the original text. If their eye skips to an earlier word, they may create a repetition (error of dittography). If their eye skips to a later word, they may create an omission. They may resort to performing a rearranging of words to retain the overall meaning without compromising the context. In other instances, the copyist may add text from memory from a similar or parallel text in another location. Otherwise, they may also replace some text of the original with an alternative reading. Spellings occasionally change. Synonyms may be substituted. A pronoun may be changed into a proper noun (such as \\"he said\\" becoming \\"Jesus said\\").

Early life  Mackay was born on Nantucket, Massachusetts, the daughter of George H. Mackay and Maria Mitchell Starbuck Mackay. She was descended from Nantucket whale oil merchant Joseph Starbuck. Her father was an avid amateur ornithologist, and her mother was a graduate of Vassar College. Pauline Mackay golfed on Nantucket as a young woman.  Golf career  Mackay began golfing at Oakley Country Club in Watertown, Massachusetts when it opened in 1898. \\"She played with the steadiness and good judgment of a professional,\\" commented one observer in 1901. In 1904, she was a semi-finalist in the U.S. Women's Amateur. She won the national women's title in 1905, defeating fellow Bostonian Margaret Curtis. \\"I think golf must be a sixth sense with me,\\" she told an interviewer after that victory, \\"I love it so, and it came to me so naturally; but I do thoroughly believe no woman can become a proficient player without taking excellent care of her health... and I think the spirit of competition a woman feels in playing with men is a great aid in strengthening her game.\\" In the 1906 tournament, she was beaten in the second round, but she won the low-score medal.  Personal life  Pauline Mackay married golfer and businessman Bruce Donald Smith, in Boston, in 1909. They lived in Chicago, and had three children together before they divorced in 1920. By 1922, both Smiths had remarried, and Bruce Smith objected to continued alimony payments of $15,000 per year. A judge ruled that their alimony agreement was a perpetual obligation, not eliminated by subsequent events. In 1920, she inherited the \\"Middle Brick\\", a historic house on Nantucket's main street, built by her great-grandfather, Joseph Starbuck. Mackay's second husband was Herbert Linsley Johnson of New York. They married in 1921. She was widowed when Johnson died in 1927. She died in 1958, aged 80 years, on Nantucket.

Paul, a small and energetic woman, was most notable for being a communist member of the anti-fascist resistance group that was later called the Red Orchestra by the Abwehr. Paul was one of the few members of the Red Orchestra Group to survive imprisonment at the hands of the Gestapo. After the war, she became responsible for drafting health policies for the people of the German Democratic Republic. Life Elfriede Paul came from a petite bourgeoisie family background and was the daughter of a lithographer. Between 1905 and 1915, she attended middle school in G√∂rlitz and later Harburg. The visit to her father in the infirmary, who had been wounded during the war, and the lack of food during the last years of World War I, led her to contemplate the meaning of war. Planning to be a fine artist while at school, she was inspired by the anthroposophical ideas of the Austrian philosopher Rudolf Steiner, but later took the rational view that she was unlikely to be successful, and would prefer to be an ordinary teacher rather than a mediocre artist. After attending the lyceum in Harburg for a year, Paul started a teacher training course in 1917. She attended the monastery of St. Johannis in Hamburg and completed the First State Examination of teachers in 1921. In 1919, Paul joined the Free German Youth and, unsatisfied with the organization, joined the German Monist League and then, due to urging from her childhood sweetheart, she became a communist and joined the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) in 1921. Paul found that the Communist Party had the emotional intellect that she had been looking for. While working as a teacher in Hamburg, she started a medical degree in 1926. In 1930 and 1931, Paul worked in Vienna and later passed the Staatsexamen in Berlin, and completed her degree in 1933. Between 1934 and 1936, Paul completed two years of general postgraduate medical training and then obtained a position at the Institute of Hygiene at the Humboldt University of Berlin to study. In 1936, she was promoted to D.Phil with a thesis titled Die Beeinflussung der Menstruation durch das Landjahr (The Influence of Menstruation by the Land Year). In 1954, she completed her habilitation with a thesis titled Ursachen und Dauer der Arbeitsunf√§higkeit bei der Frau (Causes and Duration of Incapacity for Women). Career In July 1933, Paul received a tip that her house was going to be searched for banned literature. The Sturmabteilung officers arrived at 06.30, searched the apartment but found nothing. Paul left a copy of the Volkischer Beobachter on her desk to assuage their suspicions. In 1934, Paul received her license to be a doctor. Between 1934 and 1937, Paul worked in the Municipal Office of Greater Berlin as a school doctor for infants, which was a part-time role. At the same time, she worked in an unpaid role as an assistant in the Hygiene Institute of the University of Berlin. From 1936 to 1939, Paul worked as a doctor for the League of German Girls, a Nazi organization. In 1936, Paul settled to become a general practitioner in Wilmersdorf. Reich Culture Minister Hans Hinkel lived on the same floor as her practice. From 1936 to 1942, Paul continued her general practitioner career. Red Orchestra At the end of 1936, Libertas Schulze-Boysen and Walter K√ºchenmeister, on the advice of Elisabeth Schumacher, sought out Paul. K√ºchenmeister, Schumacher, and a Mr. Schwarz were selected to visit Paul's surgery waiting room. The conversation did not proceed in the waiting room, so Schwarz ordered Schumacher to introduce himself but Paul feared arrest and remained on guard and it was only slowly that her confidence was restored. Paul stated the following: :I think I should represent you, sir, and now you are appearing here yourself? The visitor, obviously amazed, does not seem to comprehend the situation. Why is he so embarrassed? His attitude is strangely uncertain anyway, as if he were bowed over, as if he had stomach pains. Paul was right to be wary as K√ºchenmeister had already been arrested twice by 1936, once in 1933 and once in a 1934, including a nine-month jail sentence spent in Sonnenburg concentration camp, where he was infected with tuberculosis. In 1936, K√ºchenmeister, by now an invalid, was receiving medical treatment for his tuberculosis from Paul. K√ºchenmeister and Paul had become good friends and subsequently, in March 1937, K√ºchenmeister abandoned his wife and moved in with Paul who intensively took up the education of K√ºchenmeister's two sons. Beginning in 1937, the group began copying and disseminating leaflets and pamphlets from the waiting room of Paul's surgery in Wilmersdorf, using information about the Spanish Civil War received from Harro Schulze-Boysen. The group would target friends and acquaintances to try and make them aware of the animalistic behaviour of the Fascists. Secrecy was essential and even getting paper and stamps became more difficult. Paul would drive around, under the guise of making house calls, and mail carefully disguised anonymous leaflets from distant post boxes. In April 1939, K√ºchenmeister's tuberculosis has advanced so much that Paul advised him to attend a sanatorium, recommending alpine air. Paul had obtained a guarantee of a cure for K√ºchenmeister and hoped he would recover completely. K√ºchenmeister, Paul, and the Schumacher's travelled to Leysin in Switzerland, finding the trip to be less suffocating than Berlin under Nazi rule. K√ºchenmeister stayed in Switzerland for seven months, receiving treatment at the sanatorium in Leysin. Paul wrote to Kuchenmeister five times over the seven months. Over the next several years, Paul was intimately involved in the group. Arrest On the 16 September 1942, two Gestapo agents arrived at 6.30 in the morning. K√ºchenmeister knew what the arrival of the agents meant, and instructed Paul to switch off the fridge and to come along. Paul, K√ºchenmeister and his son Rainer were arrested. Both Paul and Rainer were taken to a holding cell on Alexanderplatz. Paul was sentenced by the 2nd Senate of the Reichskriegsgericht on 6 February 1943 to six years in prison for preparation for high treason. Walter K√ºchenmeister was taken to Dachau concentration camp. He was sentenced to death by the 2nd Senate of the Imperial War Court for belonging to the resistance organization, the Red Orchestra, and was executed on 13 May 1943 in Pl√∂tzensee Prison in Berlin. Due to the German idea that the family shares responsibility for a crime, known as Sippenhaft, K√ºchenmeister's son Rainer was also jailed. He was sent to Moringen concentration camp, and in March 1945, was sent to strafbataillon, a penal battalion and survived the war. In February 1945, Paul, along with 300 other women, was transported in a cattle car to Leipzig. While imprisoned, she was allowed to volunteer in the prison hospital. She found 300 women patients in a hall in the hospital. The women had every disease imaginable and the place was full of vermin. While working as a doctor there, she contracted tuberculosis in her left lung. Due to the bombing, it was impossible to bury the dead, so she stacked the dead bodies in a shed in the hospital grounds. After World War 2 On 7 May 1945, Paul and the rest of the prisoners were released when an American tank from the US 2nd Infantry Division drove through the garden wall. The tank crew released all the prisoners and gave what rations they could. After recovering, Paul returned to Berlin, an unrecognizable city now bombed to destruction. Paul started back to work as a physician but found it difficult to visit her patients in the American occupation zone and Soviet occupation zone, so she decided to go live with her sister Elsbeth in Burgdorf, Hanover During this period she worked for the reformation of the KPD in Hanover and the surrounding districts, as old colleagues returned from the concentration camps and prisons. After a two-week holiday in Burgdorf, she decided to settle there, when the KPD asked for her help, as they had insufficient staff in the Hanover officer and the Berlin KPD office was well staffed. In 1945, Paul opened a practice and, with some help, she treated patients from Camp Ohio, a large resettlement camp close to Burgdorf that contained hundreds of women, children and old people. Paul stated of the experience: :I saw unspeakable misery. Primarily separated from each other by blankets, many families lived in a single large barrack, and there was no prospect of returning to their own home in the foreseeable future. The county seat [of] Burgdorf and certainly the villages of this Lower Saxon area had, as I said, barely known the horrors and hardships of the war. Most of the farmers were hard-hearted. They did not give the mothers a drop of milk for their children, not a piece of bread. In 1946, Paul became a Minister for Construction, Labour and Welfare of the State of Hanover as a member of the Landtag of the Communist Party of Germany. The position only lasted for a year as Hanover was in the British Zone of Occupation and became part of Lower Saxony in 1946 and Paul's position as a member of the assembly was dissolved. On 1 May 1947, Elfriede returned to Berlin. For the next two years, Paul was director of the Division for Occupational Health Care in the German Economic Commission. The following year she was medical director of the Insurance Institute Berlin. In 1950, Paul returned to work at the Hygienic Institute of the University of Berlin, where she had been an assistant before the war. Paul remained in the position until 1954 when she was appointed as Head of the Occupational Health Inspectorate of the Health Department of the Berlin City Council. In 1956, Paul was appointed to the Chair of Social Hygiene at the Institute of Social Hygiene at the Medical Academy Magdeburg, the University of Magdeburg, which is now called the Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg. In 1957, Paul also undertook a lectureship in occupational medicine at the Medical Academy Magdeburg. As a social hygienist, she included clinicians from various fields in the lecture series Occupational Hygiene. From 1960, she was also a city counsellor for Magdeburg. She retired in 1964.

It was released on October 25, 2019 by NUXXE. The album features guest appearances from Charli XCX, Iggy Azalea, Violet Chachki, Aquaria, Erika Jayne, Rico Nasty, Ashnikko and others. Background In February 2014, Candy signed with RCA Records. Candy's original debut album was set to be called Daddy Issues, being executively produced by then label-mate Sia, who was also a songwriter on the record. She discovered Candy on Instagram and reached out to her, believing that \\"[she] was the only person who could really support [Candy] in becoming who [she is] on a grander stage or platform.\\" From 2015 to 2017, some promotional and official singles were unveiled anticipating the album's release including \\"Rubber Band Stacks\\", \\"Happy Days\\", \\"Nasty\\", \\"Paper or Plastic\\", and \\"Living Out Loud featuring Sia, which ended up being the first Candy's charting song peaking at number 4 at the Billboard's US Dance Club Songs chart. RCA stated that the album was set for a spring 2017 release. In the summer of 2017, Candy parted ways with RCA Records. In an interview, she stated that Sony owned the songs so after her departure the album was cancelled. During June, Candy spoke with magazine Bullett about her experience with RCA Records, stating: \\"I feel like I‚Äôve been in a weird Matrix glitch for the past three or four years, but I‚Äôm finally out of it‚Äîback at square one, but way healthier.\\" Candy also said she had begun planning an EP set to be released during the summer. \\"I‚Äôm working on a new EP that‚Äôs like punk-rap‚Äîit‚Äôs just what I‚Äôve been feeling. I want to make music everyone can dance to. I never particularly wanted to make mainstream pop music‚Äîit just seemed like a great opportunity and a really cool way for me to build a fucking massive platform to spread a conscious, positive message to young girls and the queer community. But I think I have a better chance of doing that if I just stay true to what I‚Äôm good at‚Äîmaking raw and authentic rap music, and just being myself.\\" From mid-2017 to early 2018 Candy returned to her career as an independent artist with self-released singles \\"Volcano\\" and \\"For Free\\". Later she signed with independent record label WonderSound Records and released two singles with them; \\"War\\" intended as the lead single of a later scrapped EP tentatively titled Who Cares and \\"My Sex\\" featuring Pussy Riot, MNDR and Mykki Blanco On November 7, 2018, Candy stated that releasing a first full-length album was still a possibility. \\"Because of my experience with Sony, I must have made like 60 songs and they just never let me put any of them out. I had a full album ready to go and that kind of burnt me a little bit and put a bad taste in my mouth. I questioned my music and my art for a while and just stopped making it completely,‚Äù Candy explained. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll release the next couple of songs but I‚Äôm planning an album and it‚Äôs in the works. I don‚Äôt want to jump ahead and say things because if things don‚Äôt happen like, godammit!\\" Before the end of the year two more singles were self-released; \\"Nuts\\" featuring American songwriter and rapper Lil Aaron and a joint single alongside production team Ojivolta called \\"Oomph\\". On January 10, 2019, Candy confirmed that she just had finished her debut album. She recorded it in London with English producer, singer and songwriter Oscar Schuller along with rapper Ashnikko. Candy spoke on her time alongside the pair: \\"Ashnikko is basically a savant! We agreed she would help with an EP if I helped with a music video, but we had three tracks done in a day‚Ä¶ within four days we had twelve strong, cohesive songs!\\" On February 28, Candy confirmed the album title to be Sexorcism. Composition The album has been described as \\"futuristic pop, house and trap\\". Candy described the sound of the lead single \\"XXXTC\\" as \\"uber-sexual, freaky, weird and nonsensical!\\" During the same interview, she claimed to have worked with many other artists for the record; \\"I have basically all of my dream collaborators ‚Äì there‚Äôs Boyz Noize, Rico Nasty and TOOPOOR\\". A ‚Äò90s house inspired track featuring RuPaul‚Äôs Drag Race winners Aquaria and Violet Chachki was also confirmed to be on the album. \\"I wanted to mimic Erotica, so it‚Äôs us whispering the nastiest shit over this incredible bassline.\\" Candy stated. Promotion =Singles= On February 28 announced that the first \\"unofficial\\" single would be called \\"Happy\\", which was released on March 29, 2019 along with its official music video directed by Rankin. The track lyrically deals with themes such as mental health and identity, with Paper stating that Candy \\"takes you through the motions of battling mental health and finding that there's pleasure in the pain.\\" The track has also been described as \\"some of [Candy's] most personal work to date\\". On June 20, 2019; Candy confirmed in an interview with The Face a collaboration with Charli XCX and rapper Maliibu Mitch called \\"XXXTC\\", which later served as the project's lead single.

Clash did praise some of the guest verses, particularly those of Charli XCX and Rico Nasty, but found the album to be \\"lacking in ideas\\" overall. However, Washington Blade praised Sexorcism's little depth, suggesting that it was poking fun at \\"music merely pretending to have soul.\\" A Popmatters critic also enjoyed Sexorcism, opining that while it wasn't very accessible, \\"it does stand as the second coming of Brooke Candy -- in all of her nightmarish but playful, horned-up but at least honest, seedy and sexy glory.\\" Track listing All tracks produced by Scheller, except where noted. ;Sampling credits * \\"FMU\\" samples the song \\"I Sit on Acid\\" by Lords of Acid from their 1991 album Lust.

Abolition of the Caliphate in 1924 as reported in the Times of London, 3 March 1924 The Ottoman Caliphate, the world's last widely recognized caliphate, was abolished on 3 March 1924 (27 Rajab 1342 AH) by decree of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey. The process was one of Atat√ºrk's Reforms following the replacement of the Ottoman Empire with the Republic of Turkey. Abdulmejid II was deposed as the last Ottoman Caliph, as was Mustafa Sabri as the last Ottoman Shaykh al-IslƒÅm. The caliph was nominally the supreme religious and political leader of all Muslims across the world. In the years prior to the abolition, during the ongoing Turkish Revolution, the uncertain future of the caliphate provoked strong reactions among the worldwide Sunni Islam community. The potential abolition of the caliphate had been actively opposed by the Indian-based Khilafat Movement, and generated heated debate throughout the Muslim world. The 1924 abolition came less than 18 months after the abolition of the Ottoman sultanate, prior to which the Ottoman sultan was ex officio caliph. Mustafa Kemal Pasha (Atat√ºrk) reportedly offered the caliphate to Ahmed Sharif as-Senussi, on the condition that he reside outside Turkey; Senussi declined the offer and confirmed his support for Abdulmejid. At least thirteen different candidates were proposed for the caliphate in subsequent years, but none was able to gain a consensus for the candidacy across the Islamic world. Candidates included Abdulmejid II, his predecessor Mehmed VI, King Hussein of the Hejaz, King Yusef of Morocco, Prince Amanullah Khan of Afghanistan, Imam Yahya of Yemen, and King Fuad I of Egypt. Unsuccessful \\"caliphate conferences\\" were held in Indonesia in 1924, in 1926 in Cairo, and in 1931 in Jerusalem. Ottoman pan-Islamism In the late 19th century, Ottoman sultan Abdul Hamid II launched his pan-Islamist program in a bid to protect the Ottoman Empire from Western attack and dismemberment, and to crush the democratic opposition at home. He sent an emissary, JamƒÅl al-Dƒ´n al-AfghƒÅnƒ´, to India in the late 19th century. The cause of the Ottoman monarch evoked religious passion and sympathy amongst Indian Muslims. A large number of Muslim religious leaders began working to spread awareness and develop Muslim participation on behalf of the caliphate; of these, Maulana Mehmud Hasan attempted to organize a national war of independence against the British Raj with support from the Ottoman Empire. End of the sultanate Following the Ottoman defeat in World War I, the Ottoman sultan under Allied direction attempted to suppress nationalist movements, and secured an official fatwa from the Sheikh ul-Islam declaring these to be un-Islamic. But the nationalists steadily gained momentum and began to enjoy widespread support. Many sensed that the nation was ripe for revolution. In an effort to neutralize this threat, the sultan agreed to hold elections, with the hope of placating and co-opting the nationalists. To his dismay, nationalist groups swept the polls, prompting the Allied Powers to dissolve the General Assembly of the Ottoman Empire in April 1920. At the end of the Turkish War of Independence, the Turkish National Movement's Grand National Assembly voted to separate the caliphate from the sultanate and abolished the latter on 1 November 1922. Initially, the National Assembly seemed willing to allow a place for the caliphate in the new regime and Mustafa Kemal did not dare to abolish the caliphate outright, as it still commanded a considerable degree of support from the common people. The caliphate was symbolically vested in the House of Osman. On 19 November 1922, the Crown Prince Abdulmejid was elected caliph by the Turkish National Assembly at Ankara. He established himself in Istanbul (at those time Constantinople) on 24 November 1922. But the position had been stripped of any authority, and Abdulmejid's purely ceremonial reign would be short-lived. When Abdulmejid was declared caliph, Kemal refused to allow the traditional Ottoman ceremony to take place, bluntly declaring: In response to Abdulmejid's petition for an increase in his allowance, Kemal wrote: On 29 October 1923, the National Assembly declared Turkey a republic, and proclaimed Ankara its new capital. After over 600 years, the Ottoman Empire had officially ceased to exist. Collapse of the Caliphate In March 1924, Muhammad al-Jizawi Rector of Cairo's prestigious al-Azhar University, in direct response to the collapse and the issue of preaching in such an environment,GRAND MEETING REGARDING THE COLLAPSE OF KHILAFAH translated by Meeraath formulated a resolution: :Whereas the Caliphate in Islam implies general control of the spritual and temporal affairs of Islam; Whereas the Turkish Government deprived the Caliph Abdul Mejid of his temporal powers, thereby disqualifying him from becoming Caliph in the sense that Islam required; seeing that in principal the Caliph is destined to be the representative of the Prophet, safeguarding everything concerning Islam, which necessarily means the Caliph should be subject of respect, veneration and obedience; and whereas the Caliph Abdul Mejid no longer possesses such qualifications and has not even the power to live in his native land; now therefore it has been decided to convene an Islamic conference in which all Muslim nations shall be represented inorder to consider who should be appointed Caliph...The Caliphate. The Times Issue: 43612, 28 March 1924 Two Indian brothers, Maulana Mohammad Ali and Maulana Shaukat Ali, leaders of the Indian-based Khilafat Movement, distributed pamphlets calling upon the Turkish people to preserve the Ottoman Caliphate for the sake of Islam. On 24 November 1923, Syed Ameer Ali and Aga Khan III sent a letter to ƒ∞smet Pasha (ƒ∞n√∂n√º) on behalf of the movement. Under Turkey's new nationalist government, however, this was construed as foreign intervention; any form of foreign intervention was labelled an insult to Turkish sovereignty and worse, a threat to state security. Mustafa Kemal Pasha promptly seized his chance. On his initiative, the National Assembly abolished the caliphate on March 3, 1924. Abdulmejid was sent into exile along with the remaining members of the Ottoman House. Aftermath \\"Turks War on Patriarchs,\\" following the Abolition of the Caliphate as reported in The New York Times, 16 March 1924 With the failure of the Muslim world to find consensus on appointing a successor, the Institution of the Caliphate collapsed.GRAND MEETING REGARDING THE COLLAPSE OF KHILAFAH translated by Meeraath In Egypt, debate focused on a controversial book by Ali Abdel Raziq which argued for secular government and against a caliphate. Today, two frameworks for pan-Islamic coordination exist: the Muslim World League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, both of which were founded in the 1960s. The most active group that exists to re-establish the caliphate is Hizb ut-Tahrir, founded in 1953 as a political organization in then Jordanian-controlled Jerusalem by Taqiuddin al-Nabhani, an Islamic scholar and appeals court judge from Haifa. This organization has spread to more than 50 countries, and grown to a membership estimated to be between \\"tens of thousands\\" to \\"about one million\\". Islamist organizations such as the Federated Islamic State of Anatolia (based in Germany, 1994‚Äì2001) and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (1999‚Äìpresent, declaration of caliphate in 2014) declared that they had re-established the Caliphate.

The bridge is one of two which cross the Swan Canal, the other being the Upper Swan Bridge at the canal's northern end, at the confluence with the Neva River. The site of the Lower Swan Bridge was originally occupied by a wooden drawbridge built to the design of Harmen van Bol'es in the 1730s, replaced by a fixed bridge by 1760, and for a time known as the First Tsaritsyn Bridge, after the Tsaritsyn Meadow, now the Field of Mars. The wooden bridge was replaced with a stone one in the 1830s, but the speed of its construction led to significant problems, with the vaulting in danger of collapse. Numerous repairs and renovations have taken place over the bridge's existence, before finally being given a degree of stability after work in the 1920s, which retained the original appearance. Further restoration took place in 2002. Today the bridge links the Field of Mars with the Summer Garden at the Swan Canal's junction with the Moyka, close to the Mikhailovsky Castle. Location and design The Lower Swan Bridge is in Dvortsovy Municipal Okrug, part of the Tsentralny District of the city. It crosses the Swan Canal, one of the city's oldest, at the point at which the canal joins the Moyka River, connecting the areas of the Field of Mars to the west and the Summer Garden to the east. It comprises a single-span arched stone construction long and wide, and carries both foot and vehicle traffic. It is one of two bridges that currently span the Swan Canal, the other being the Upper Swan Bridge at the northern end of the canal at its juncture with the Neva River. History Iron latticework of the bridge's railings The point at which the Swan Canal diverged from the Moyka River was first crossed by a wooden drawbridge built to the design of engineer Harmen van Bol'es, and in existence between 1720 and 1733. It comprised a beam system with supports on a pile foundation. The supports and superstructure were covered with boards painted to resemble stone. It was called the First Tsaritsyn Bridge after the Tsaritsyn Meadow, now the Field of Mars. It was replaced with a fixed wooden bridge by the 1760s. The wooden crossing was replaced with a stone and brick one over six months between December 1836 and mid-1837, as part of the redevelopment of the area around the Mikhailovsky Castle. Engineers Pierre- Dominique Bazaine, and A. I. Remezov were responsible for the design of the single-span brick-vaulted arched bridge, with its facades and pillars lined with granite, and cast-iron railings designed by Carlo Rossi. Prior to this the bridge had had several names, including the Swan Bridge, the Lower Swan Bridge, and the Wooden Swan Bridge, the latter name to distinguish it from the bridge across the northern end of the canal, which had been a stone construction since 1768. After being rebuilt in stone, the name Lower Swan Bridge took precedence, distinguishing it from the northern bridge, which became the Upper Swan Bridge. The bridge from the Moyka, showing the junction with the Swan Canal The haste in which the bridge was constructed soon began to show. The brick vault of the bridge cracked almost immediately after completion, with the crack widening steadily over the next six years. By 1842 the gap had widened to , causing seams to open in the bridge's foundations. Attempts were made to fill the gaps with copper wedges, but by 1846 all the wedges had fallen out and the bridge was crumbling, pieces falling into the water at the slightest vibration. A repair plan was drawn up by March 1847, but failed to solve the problems, with new defects being found in the repair works. In 1849 the arch collapsed, necessitating further repairs. Defects were again discovered in the vaulting in the early 1900s, and an 1904 examination declared the condition of the bridge unsatisfactory. In 1907, another reconstruction project was drawn up, proposing the fitting of lattice metal trusses. Neither this nor several subsequent repair programmes were implemented, and the bridge continued to collapse. By the early 1920s the condition of the bridge was causing serious concern, and it was closed to traffic in 1924. It was again repaired between April 1925 and 1926 under the oversight of engineers B. D. Vasilyev and A. L. Salarev. The structure was strengthened with reinforced concrete and lined with granite, retaining the earlier appearance of the bridge, including Rossi's railings, which were restored. Another restoration took place in 2002 as part of the 300th anniversary of the founding of the city. Waterproofing was carried out, the railings were restored and the roadway and pavements repaired.

Early life Born on 29 October 1893, Alice was the youngest of six children of Nathalie (n√©e Dr√§gen) and Heinrich \\"Fritz\\" Pfeffer, owners of a gas lamp factory on Moritzplatz in Berlin-Kreuzberg. From 1899 she attended the Royal Augusta Girls School in Kleinbeerenstrasse in Berlin-Kreuzberg, but the early death of the father left the family in straitened circumstances, and she was moved in 1910 to a girls' boarding school under the direction of Baroness von Wrangel, but absconded after three months. From September 1911 and during the First World War until 1914, Alice Lex studied painting and graphic art under Emil Orlik, among others, at the educational institution at the Museum of Decorative Arts with fellow students George Grosz and Hannah H√∂ch, and there in 1912 met Oskar Nerlinger (1893‚Äì1969), whom she married in 1918. As a student she began exhibiting in the annual Gro√üe Berliner Kunstausstellung in 1915, and by 1918, had produced a series of eight Expressionist-style prints illustrating Eduard Reinacher's war poem Der Tod von Grallenfels.Rachel Epp Buller (2005) 'Pregnant Women and Rationalized Workers: Alice Lex‚Äôs Anonymous Bodies'. In Berlin in the 20s was a laboratory for expressionist, Dadaist and futuristic rebels and Lex-Nerlinger, amongst them, tried out different styles and media searching for a politically effective means of expression. After graduation, she worked as a window-dresser in a Tempelhof department store, and designs fabrics for Kaufhaus Wertheim on Leipziger Stra√üe. In 1918 Lex- Nerlinger joined Oskar in Strasbourg, he having completed his military service there and on 23 March they married and returned to Berlin in 1919, together running an antique shop. They frequented events at the gallery associated with Herwarth Walden's expressionist journal Der Sturm, and took part in the monthly 'Die Abstrakten' group soirees in the studio of Arthur Segal. Dissatisfied with the bourgeoise politics of these organisations, in 1927 Lex- Nerlinger and her husband became members of the Communist KPD and, in 1928, of the Bund revolution√§rer K√ºnstler (Association of Revolutionary Visual Artists),Nerlinger, Oskar (1975b): ‚ÄúWie wir zu ASSO kamen.‚Äù In: Alice Lex- Nerlinger/Oskar Nerlinger: Malerei, Graphik, Foto-Graphik, Berlin: Akademie der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik, pp. 16-17. whose aim was to use art as a weapon in the class struggle. She began to design successful political posters, drawing no distinction between the applied work and that which she exhibited. Though born Alice Pfeffer, and having taken her artist husband Otto Nerlinger's last name after their marriage, by 1927, in order to distinguish her production from his and evincing a feminist stance, she took the un- gendered nom de guerre 'Lex', but is now generally identified by her hyphenated name. Career For twenty years Lex-Nerlinger was part of an international avant-garde photography scene which centred on the Neues Shehen ('New Vision') emerging in Germany, a style she embraces in her straight photography of the period, all with a feminist ethos, and was represented in the 1929 in the Stuttgart showing of Film und Foto. Especially interested in the situation of her sisterhood, her documentary photography including the 1928 series Working Women, the subjects are shown yoked to the machinery of industry. The poultry breeder poses half-hidden behind chicken-wire, or the seamstress is bent over her sewing machine, dreaming, in double-exposure of the carefree happiness of her girlhood,Clarke, J 2002, ‚ÄòAlice Lex-Nerlinger (German, 1803-1974): ‚ÄôSeamstress‚Äô, 1930‚Äô, ART INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO MUSEUM STUDIES, vol. 28, no. 1, p. 96, viewed 2 July 2019 while the typist frustratedly scrubs at a misprint with an eraser. She was the only woman photographer represented in Werner Graeff‚Äòs (1901‚Äì1978) influential and now rare 1929 book Es kommt der neue Fotograf! (‚ÄòHere comes the new photographer!‚Äô) published in Berlin by H. Reckendorf, with her political photomontage of that year in which the photographic medium enables her multiplication of figures of authority, soldiers and police, commanded by the raised fist of the bosses to surround the bewildered workers, locked out of their workplace during industrial action. Themes and style Lex-Nerlinger first experimented with photomontage for a 1927 children's picture book dedicated to her son, Peter, then used the medium to political ends from 1928 then until 1933, the didactic and gradually more diagrammatic work for which she is best known. Her photomontage Work! Work! Work! (1928), for example, illustrates the everyday reality of life for the anonymous (and in her imagery, literally faceless)Bergius, Hanne (1994): ‚ÄúFotomontage im Vergleich.‚Äù In: Ute Eskildsen (ed.), Fotografieren hiess teilnehmen: Fotografinnen der Weimarer Republik, D√ºsseldorf: Richter Verlag, pp. 42-50. proletariat: a drab exchange of machine production for the hasty gobbling of dry bread in work- soiled hands. The stop-watch in the capitalist's leather-gloved hand sets the rhythm,Stein, Sally (1994): ‚ÄúZu den lyrischen und anti-lyrischen Tendenzen in der foto/grafischen Werk von Alice Lex-Nerlinger.‚Äù In: Ute Eskildsen (ed.), Fotografieren hiess teilnehmen: Fotografinnen der Weimarer Republik, D√ºsseldorf: Richter Verlag, pp. 51-59. echoed in the mechanical repetition of the workers‚Äô fists, in a spiralling composition. That female self- determination entails more than employment is evident in Lex-Nerlinger's most famous work Paragraph 218 of 1931 (pencil drawing, spray paint); an appeal against a paragraph of the law which punished those providing abortions with imprisonment and which had led to two prominent physicians Friedrich Wolf and Dr. Else Kienle being remanded in custody. While Wolf was soon released on bail, Else Kienle was released only after five weeks and a hunger strike. There was much public controversy over the issue and protests among Lex- Nerlinger's comrades in the communist movement. The magazine, Weg der Frau ('Women's Way'), held an exhibition on the theme Frauen in Not ('Women in Need'), featuring two works by Alice Lex-Nerlinger. In her work the women are not presented as victims but as group who strive in solidarity and strength against a giant cross that reads ‚ÄúParagraph 218‚Äù, toppling it.Grossman, A. (1978). Abortion and Economic Crisis: The 1931 Campaign against ¬ß218 in Germany. New German Critique, (14), 119-137. doi:10.2307/488065 Lex-Nerlinger addressed her traumatic experience of WW1 and its horrific aftermath in works such the 1931 Feldgrau schafft Dividende (‚ÄòField Gray creates dividends‚Äô) denouncing capitalist profit-making through war (the title comes from an article in one of the Communist leftist papers). A factory in the background churns out armaments directly to a screaming soldier who ‚Äì entangled in barbed wire ‚Äì occupies half of the image. Using an air-brush to repeat the blank factory windows, faceless workers, tanks and shells, she explains the causes of a social evil with non-photographic means as forcefully as in her black- and-white photomontages, such as Giftgas ('Poison Gas) of 1929. Originally titled Menschen auf der Stra√üe (People on the Street) and produced specifically for Die Stra√üe, a printmaking exhibition she and other members of Die Abstrakten organized to appear within the 1930 Gro√üe Berliner Kunstausstellunger, her Arm und Reich (Rich and Poor) of 1929 makes class difference explicit through vignettes to make direct comparisons; the elderly well-to-do relaxes in a caf√© while outside the war invalid begs; the child of the rich woman pedals his toy car along the street beside her, while the children of the poor share their pram with newspapers being sold by their heavily pregnant mother; the tennis player exercises for recreation while the worker labours over his jackhammer. Each of the abutted scenes is constructed in the darkroom from intricately cut paper printed as photograms; an exercise in masking that exploits the negative image and the texture and transparency of paper. Repetitions underline the imbalance in the ratio of numbers of poor to rich, but none is printed exactly the same, as the photogram technique entails variations in density and different degrees of light ‚Äòbleed‚Äô under the cut paper templates. In 1931 Lex-Nerlinger participated in a major exhibition of photomontage that took place at the Kunstgewerbemuseum in Berlin. Also invited were John Heartfield, Andre Kertesz, Hannah H√∂ch, Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, Oskar Nerlinger, Albert Renger-Patsch, and other prominent artists of the day. Most productive in the years up to 1933 and the rise of Hitler she developed her spray technique at the same time as photographing and montaging; forms and materials selected for their capacity to urge critical and revolutionary messages: Imprisonment and obscurity With the seizure of power by the National Socialists Lex-Nerlinger was expelled from the \\"Reich Association of Fine Artists\\" and banned from practising her profession or exhibiting. She and her husband were periodically arrested and taken for interrogation and their studio was frequently raided, though their status in the Berlin art community may have protected her from the life-sentences meted out to lesser-known colleagues. Following a short imprisonment in 1933 she retreated into an ‚Äòinner emigration‚Äô and did not publish until 1945. Fearing raids on her studio, she destroyed much of her work and the depredations of the Second World War obliterated much of the rest. We are left with only the vestiges of her output of this period, though researchers like Ira Plein of the University of Luxembourg's Luxembourg Center for Contemporary and Digital History, whose German language master's thesis Alice Lex Nerlinger (1893 ‚Äì 1975) Motifs and imagery in the service of the class struggle 1928-1933 passed at the University of Trier in 2012, are searching the archives and ephemera of the era for what can be salvaged. Having rediscovered the artist in the mid-2000s, US feminist art historian Rachel Epp Buller, with a grant from the Fulbright Foundation in 2011, searched the artist's archive at the Berlin Academy of Arts, then in cooperation with the academy and assistance of the gallery, mounted Lex-Nerlinger's first retrospective in 2016, appropriately at the \\"Hidden Museum\\". Post-War in the German Democratic Republic For the last three decades of her life, Lex‚ÄêNerlinger continued as a well‚Äêknown graphic designer and portraitist in the GDR, working until the day she died in 1975, but under the state's sanctioning of Socialist Realism her photomontages, that she had worked so hard to master, were denounced as \\"formalistic\\". However, the force of her image Paragraph 218 was restored when it was taken up by the women's movement of the 1970s. Even without a contract in the fifties Lex- Nerlinger created photo-derived portraits of workers, among which is the painting Schaffnerin Anni (‚ÄòConductor Anni‚Äô) the now legendary streetcar artist. Anni faces the viewer head-on, looks us in the face with a challenging smile and points to her tram-conductor‚Äôs money changer, which in street jargon is a ‚ÄúKrautkasse‚Äù (‚ÄúHerb‚Äôs purse‚Äù), which she wears around her neck. She was the mother of Hannelore Kraft, a German politician who was the president of the Bundesrat, the first woman to hold the office.

Early life  Jalan Crossland was born and raised in Ten Sleep, Wyoming. He attended Ten Sleep High School before his family moved to Pittsburgh, where he attended David B. Oliver High School. Crossland became interested in music as a child, after hearing his uncle play the banjo. In 1997 he placed second in the Winfield National Guitar Fingerpicking Competition. In 1999 he won the first place title at the Wyoming Flatpick Championship. As a teenager he played electric guitar in a series heavy metal bands in Pittsburgh. When he was twenty, he and his girlfriend had a baby. He moved to Gillette, Wyoming to work as a sheepherder. He and his girlfriend ended their relationship and he left his job as a sheepherder. He then worked with country bands as a free-lance guitarist and had a day job in a mobile home factory in Casper. He quit the factory job and began pursuing music full-time.  Career  Crossland is a banjoist, guitarist, and vocalist. With the help of family he created and recorded his own label, Boom Chicken Rekkerds. He released his first album, Poor Boy Shanty in 2000. In 2004 he released his second record, Moonshiner. In 2005 he formed the Jalan Crossland Band with bassist Shaun Kelley and drummer Pat Madsen. They released the albums Trailer Park Fire & Other Tragedies in 2006 and Driftwood Souls in 2010. The band took a hiatus in 2011 and Crossland released a solo album titled Portrait of a Fish. The band later reconvened and, in 2014, released the album No Cause For Despair. In 2017 the Jalan Crossland Band released the album Singalongs for the Apocalypse. Crossland was awarded Wyoming Public Radio's people's choice award for best Wyoming release of 2017.

Retrieved July 3rd, 2019.  Research Gianmarco Ottaviano's research areas include capital movements and multinational firms, development and growth, economic integration, international trade, international migration, and regional cohesion. = Research on the economics of agglomeration= Reviewing the literature on economic geography, Ottaviano and Diego Puga reconcile the conclusions of Spence (1976) and Dixit and Stiglitz (1977): stronger competition in local product and factor markets causes spatial dispersion, though firms tend to locate close to large markets in order to take advantage of increasing returns to scale and keep trade costs low, which in turn creates pecuniary externalities fostering economic agglomeration. By affecting trade costs, economic integration then shapes the spatial location of economic activities and explains a range of patterns such as offshoring, local immigration and infra-regional development.Ottaviano, G.I.P., Puga, D. (1998). Agglomeration in the global economy: a survey of the 'new economic geography'. World Economy, 21(6), pp. 707-731. In that context, Ottaviano and Rikard Forslid developed an extension of Krugman's classical core-periphery model through the introduction of heterogeneity in workers' skills and mobility.Forslid, R., Ottaviano, G.I.P. (2003). An analytically solvable core- periphery model. Journal of Economic Geography, 3(3), pp. 229-240. Moreover, Ottaviano, Takatoshi Tabuchi and Jacques-Fran√ßois Thisse have shown that the insights from new economic geography models √† la Dixit and Stiglitz (1976) do not depend on the choice of modelling framework by developing a distinct modelling framework that yielded the same results.Ottaviano, G., Tabuchi, T., Thisse, J.-F. (2002). Agglomeration and trade revisited. International Economic Review, 43(2), pp. 409-435. Ottaviano and Thisse's perspective on the relationship between agglomeration and economic geography is elaborated in a chapter of the Handbook of Regional and Urban Economics.Ottaviano, G., Thisse, J.F. (2004). Agglomeration and economic geography. In: Henderson, J.V., Thisse, J.-F. (eds). Handbook of Regional and Urban Economics, vol. 4. Amsterdam: Elsevier, pp. 2563-2608. In another study on the link between agglomeration and growth with Philippe Martin, Ottaviano showed how both processes can be mutually self-reinforcing, as agglomeration reduces the cost of innovation and thereby raises growth, while growth further fosters agglomeration as new firms cluster close to the sector from which innovation originates.Martin, P., Ottaviano, G.I.P. (2001). Growth and agglomeration. International Economic Review, 42(4), pp. 947-968. They similarly showed how growth, FDI, and industrial concentration are mediated through transaction costs and R&D; spillovers, with important implications for economic development.Martin, P., Ottaviano, G.I.P. (1999). Growing locations: Industry location in a model of endogenous growth. European Economic Review, 43(2), pp. 281-302. In further work with Richard Baldwin, Ottaviano and Martin showed how the industrialization and growth take-off of rich northern countries, massive global income divergences and then convergence through trade integration can be explained through changes in trade costs.Baldwin, R.E., Martin, P., Ottaviano, G.I.P. (2001). Global income divergence, trade, and industrialization: The geography of growth take-offs. Journal of Economic Growth, 6(1), pp. 5-37. = Research on the economics of international trade= Together with Marc Melitz, Ottaviano developed a trade model in which productivity and price mark-ups respond to size and integration of a market through international trade, with higher integration enabling tougher competition and thus also changing the composition of producers and exporters in that market.Melitz, M.J., Ottaviano, G.I.P. (2008). Market size, trade, and productivity. Review of Economic Studies, 75(1), pp. 295-316. Expanding this framework in further work with Thierry Mayer to firms' product mixes and range of exported products, Ottaviano and Melitz confirmed the claim that tougher competition in an export market induces firms to skew their export sales towards their best performing products, a finding that is confirmed for French exporters and bears important implications for firms' productivity.Mayer, T., Melitz, M.J., Ottaviano, G.I.P. (2014). Market size, competition, and the product mix of exporters. American Economic Review, 104(2), pp. 495-536. In earlier work on the internationalisation of European firms, Ottaviano and Mayer observed that a few high-performing firms drive their countries' international performance, suggesting that economic integration policies should focus on raising the number of international firms rather than \\"deepening\\" the international involvement of already internationalized firms.Mayer, T., Ottaviano, G.I.P. (2008). The happy few: The internationalisation of European firms. Intereconomics, 43(3), pp. 135-148. = Research on migration and diversity= In joint work with Giovanni Peri, Ottaviano investigated the relationship between linguistic diversity across U.S. cities and local productivity over 1970-90; together, they find that wages and employment density of U.S.-born workers were systematically higher, all else equal, in cities with higher linguistic diversity, especially for highly educated and for white workers, and that the relationship was strengthened the better non-native speakers were assimilated in terms of language skills and duration of residence.Ottaviano, G.I.P., Peri, G. (2005). Cities and cultures. Journal of Urban Economics, 58(2), pp. 304-337. Further research by Ottaviano and Peri on the value of cultural diversity - as proxied by the diversity of countries of birth of U.S. residents - suggested that US- born citizens living in metropolitan areas with increasing shares of foreign- born residents experienced significant growth in wages and housing values.Ottaviano, G.I.P., Peri, G. (2006). The value of cultural diversity: evidence from US cities. Journal of Economic Geography, 6(1), pp. 9-44. Their thinking about the effects of immigration on natives' wages turns around the notion that natives and foreigners are inherently imperfectly substitutable even within the same skill group. Using this framework, they showed that immigration to the U.S. in 1990-2006 had small negative short-run effects on native high school dropouts (-0.7%) and average wages (-0.4%), while raising the wages of native high school dropouts and average native wages in the long run by 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively, but depressing the long-run wages of previous immigrants by 6.7%.Ottaviano, G.I.P., Peri, G. (2005). Rethinking the Gains from Immigration: Theory and Evidence from the US. NBER Working Paper Series, No. 11672.Ottaviano, G.I.P., Peri, G. (2008). Immigration and national wages: Clarifying the theory and the empirics. NBER Working Paper Series, No. 14188.Ottaviano, G.I.P., Peri, G. (2012). Rethinking the effect of immigration on wages. Journal of the European Economic Association, 10(1), pp. 152-197. Another study by Ottaviano with Peri and Greg Wright observed that manufacturing industries with a larger increase in exposure to globalization (through offshoring or immigration) saw improvements in terms of native employment growth relative to less exposed industries. They explain this finding through a model wherein natives, immigrants and offshore workers differ systematically in their ability to apply complex skills and wherein jobs vary in the degree to which their performance requires complex skills. In this framework, the productivity effect related to more efficient task assignment - producers hiring natives, immigrants and offshore workers for different tasks according to their respective comparative advantage - may offset the displacement effect of immigration and offshoring on natives' employment.Ottaviano, G.I.P., Peri, G., Wright, G.C. (2013). Immigration, offshoring, and American jobs. American Economic Review, 103(5), pp. 1925-1959. Finally, with regard to the labour market effects of immigration to Western Germany during the 1990s, Ottaviano - together with Peri and Francesco d'Amuri - found that immigration had a sizeable adverse effect on previous immigrants' employment and a small adverse effect on their wages, while having very little adverse effects on native wages and employments; the authors explain this divergence through the higher substitutability between different groups of immigrants relative to that between immigrants and natives.D'Amuri, F., Ottaviano, G.I.P., Peri, G.

The film stars Sabrina Carpenter, Liza Koshy, Keiynan Lonsdale, Michelle Buteau and Jordan Fisher. It was released on August 7, 2020, by Netflix. Plot Quinn Ackerman is a quirky and intelligent high school senior living in North Carolina with her single mother. She has one best friend, aspiring dancer Jasmine Hale, who has known her since kindergarten and always sticks up for her. Quinn's dream is to attend Duke University, as it is her late father's alma mater, and her mother wants it for her just as much as she does. She studies hard, earns straight As, and takes part in many extra-curricular activities, though she does not have much of a social life as a result. After an interview with progressive admissions counselor, Veronica Ramirez, Quinn is informed that her application is too similar to the other applicants, and that her chances of standing out to the admission's team are not good. Quinn then lies and tells her that she is a member of her high school's elite dance team, \\"The Thunderbirds,\\" which is very well known around the state as the reigning champions of the \\"Work It\\" dance competition. Quinn enlists Jasmine's help to prepare her for an audition being held by the team in two weeks, as she is already on the team. Quinn's dancing skills improve by the time of the audition, but the team's ruthless leader, Julliard Pembroke, still rejects her. After Jasmine stands up to him and defends Quinn, Quinn suggests that the two of them start their own dance team to compete at \\"Work It\\". Jasmine reluctantly agrees, but is worried about not being there to be scouted by a recruiter from a dance academy in New York. Quinn discovers a former champion of the \\"Work It\\" competition, Jake Taylor, who stopped competing after a knee injury two years prior. Quinn approaches him at the dance studio where he now works, and asks him to be a choreographer for her team. He turns her down, mainly due to the fact that she approaches dancing as something that can be learned by thinking, and not with passion. Meanwhile, the girls round up a group of unknown dancers at school who all differentiate in style. The team includes Raven, a goth and rocker style dancer, Chris, a soccer player with dance skills, DJ Tapes, a kid who sells mixtapes, Robby G., a karate student and excellent flipper, and Priya, an Indian style dancer. After seeing her potential during an informal dance lesson with Quinn, Jake agrees to choreograph her team for \\"Work It\\", but only if they can win the upcoming qualifying competition. The team begins practicing on their own, using the studio where Jake works, and performing at the local nursing home where Quinn volunteers. At qualifiers, under the name \\"TBD\\", they make the cut, but on a technicality issue with an opposing team. Jake concludes that they need much improvement and have a lot of work to do if they want to win at \\"Work It\\". Quinn and Jake spend more time together, and Quinn confesses that she's not sure that she truly wants to attend Duke anymore, but feels she has to because of the time and effort her mother put in to help her. Jake takes her aside and decides to experiment free style dancing with her. Quinn's talent surfaces, as well as their undeniable chemistry, and the two kiss passionately. With a newfound confidence, Quinn takes it easier on herself and puts more effort into her dancing and the team. She emails the Duke Admissions Councilor and informs her that she has started her own team and that they will be competing at \\"Work It\\". However, when Julliard discovers that Jake is choreographing for the \\"TBDs\\", he turns them in for using the studio to practice without paying, and Jake loses his job. Quinn's grades drop as a result of her dedication to the team, and receives an email from the Duke admissions team, informing her that Veronica no longer works there. Quinn confesses everything to her mom, and they agree that she should quit the dance team, and bring her grades up before turning in her final transcript. The team feels betrayed by Quinn's departure, especially Jasmine, who rejoins \\"The Thunderbirds\\". Jake attempts to stop Quinn, who calls him out on hypocrisy for lecturing her about quitting. She tells him she doesn't have time for a boyfriend and ends their romance. Quinn, while working at the nursing home, has a conversation with an elderly woman named Ruthie, who encourages her to not waste her time studying all the time and live her life to the fullest. She points out different people in the home who had taken different paths in life and yet ended up in the same place, looking back fondly on their most fun and happy memories. While stamping books, Quinn starts listening to music and begins to \\"get out of her head\\" as Jake told her, and just dance. She re-discovers her own passion for dance and reconciles with Jake, and they both decide to bring the team back together. Quinn also reconciles with Jasmine and she quits \\"The Thunderbirds\\", rejoining \\"The TBDs\\". The group begins to learn each other's unique style of dance, and Jake incorporates all of them into the choreography. On the day of the competition, Quinn arrives late after she is held up by her mom, who is angry with her for lying. Her mom tries to punish her if she leaves, but Quinn stands up to her mother and tells her that dancing is what makes her happy. She manages to grab the keys to the car and drives herself there, even though she only has a learners permit. She dances with the team and sees her mother, who has followed her, in the audience, clearly proud of her daughter. \\"The TBDs\\" win the competition and both Jasmine and Julliard are approached by a scout from the New York Dance Academy. Quinn also runs into Veronica, who is now working at NYU, and invites her to apply for the fall semester.

Armaindo was trained by Canadian athlete Tom Eck, who also worked as her manager and promoter and eventually became her husband. The two met in Chicago in the late 1870s, when Armaindo was performing as a strongwoman and becoming interested in pedestrianism, competitive endurance walking.: 29-31 With Eck as manager, Armaindo became a pedestrienne, competing and giving exhibitions in small American towns for pay.: 15 Around this time, many pedestriennes began to race high-wheel bicycles, including Armaindo.: 15 She soon became a successful bicycle racer, competing against men, women, and horses. In 1882, Armaindo raced American cyclist John Prince over 50 miles. She was given a five-mile head start, but the two eventually became so close in the race that they traded positions several times. Prince won by about a minute. Armaindo was more successful when she raced Elsa von Blumen that same year. She won their championship race in Ridgeway Park, Philadelphia, becoming the women's champion of cycling. Armaindo was also known for participating in multi-day indoor cycling races, in which cyclists would ride many hours each day, with the winner determined by who logged the most miles over the entirety of the race. In 1886, she held a record of 843 miles in a race of this kind. Armaindo died in 1900.

As such, umwelt evokes more than environment; it emphasizes an organism's ability to sense ‚Äî a condition for the existence of shared signs.\\" Her collaborations on third culture projects uncover the deeper meaning behind the history and evolution of science and technology; how people, culture and institutions shape the understanding of science, history and the natural world. Her cross- disciplinary work often includes microscopy and biomedical imaging, and is described as \\"something uncanny... where one's consciousness can neither respond in a unified way to the bodily sensations or float free in imaginary space; it is caught in the in-between.\\" Influenced by the early work of the MIT Center for Advanced Visual Studies, and the art and visual perception theories of Rudolf Arnheim, Olynyk was one of the first artists in the US appointed to a university science unit, is listed as one of the 66 Brilliant Women in Creative Technology, and has programmed art, science and technology curriculum, symposiums and fellowships at research institutions.

Since then, ambitions have been great at the club, despite struggling to live up to these in the first years. The club was close to reaching promotion in 2003, where former Silkeborg IF player Torben J√∏rgensen was in charge of FA 2000, but afterwards a couple of chaotic seasons followed, and in 2006 they were only a single point from suffering relegation from the Series 1. At that point, in the autumn season of 2006, former FC Copenhagen player I√∏rn Uldbjerg was appointed as new head coach of the team. Under him, the team quietly moved the team away from the bottom and towards the top half of the league, but in the decisive match in 2008 in F√¶lledparken they lost 3-2 to BK Viktoria in a dramatic match, where FA 2000 led 2-0 at half-time. In 2009, the tournament was rescheduled to start in the autumn, giving half a season with a golden opportunity for promotion, but many player departures during the winter break meant that FA 2000 had to settle for an 8th place. However, the team managed to qualify for the main round of the Danish Cup for the first time in the club's short history. The disappointment meant that the club board decided to form a sports committee to take care of the development of the club, and the committee's first task was to hire Carsten Rust as the new head coach. He had led KFUMs Boldklub to the fifth tier Copenhagen Series, and for long it looked like he would repeat the feat at FA 2000. However, a long decline during spring ended up costing dearly. A 2-1 defeat at Drag√∏r Boldklub four rounds before the end of the competition cost the promotion. The debut match for Rust had been in the 1st round of the Danish Cup against Aller√∏d FK from the third tier Danish 2nd Division, where they lost 0-2. Rust decided to step down after the season due to private reasons.

Shortly after another case of arson in 1967 which destroyed a remaining barn, the property began to see the medium-density residential development that characterizes it today, with the First Whiting Farms Cooperative Housing breaking ground later that year. Initially criticized as the \\"Road to Nowhere\\" during Samuel Resnic's administration in the early 1960s, Whiting Farms Road today serves as a major artery for retail businesses and traffic to I-91 in the area.

Following her internship, she worked at NPR as a producer, before landing a role on NPR's Investigations Desk. In 2016, Dickerson reported on the testing of mustard gas by the U.S. military on American troops during WWII, in which subjects were grouped by race. Her reporting, published as a two-part special investigation by NPR, revealed that the Department of Veteran Affairs had broken promises it had made in the 1990s to seek out and provide compensation to veterans who had suffered permanent injuries as a result of the testing. Congress reacted to the report by calling for investigations and hearings, ultimately leading to the passage of a law to compensate test subjects. For their work, Dickerson and her investigative team were awarded a 2015 Peabody Award and a 2016 RTDNA National Edward R. Murrow Award. In 2016, Dickerson joined the staff of The New York Times as a national immigration reporter.

She is the Director of the Research School of Social Sciences at the Australian National University and a visiting professor at King's College London. Waldby's research has been focused on social studies of biomedicine and the life sciences. She has written over 50 research articles and seven monographs. Her books include AIDS and the Body Politic: Biomedicine and Sexual Difference (1996), Tissue Economies: Blood, Organs and Cell Lines in Late Capitalism (2006) and Clinical Labor: Tissue donors and Research Subjects in the Bioeconomy (2014). In 2019, she wrote The O√∂cyte Economy: The Changing Meanings of Human Eggs. Waldby is the co-editor of BioSocieties, with Nikolas Rose and Hannah Landecker. In 2010, she was elected as a Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences in Australia and in 2018, a member of the College of Experts, European Science Foundation. Her research has been funded by many international and national grants from various organizations including the Australian Research Council, the National Health and Medical Research Council and the UK Economic and Social Council.  Education  Waldby received her secondary education at St Rita's College, Clayfield. After completing her BA in English Literature and Sociology from University of Queensland in 1982, she completed her MA in Government from Sydney University in 1983. In 1995, she received her Ph.D. in Social Sciences from Murdoch University.  Career  After completing her Ph.D., Waldby joined the School of Media, Culture and Communication at Murdoch University as a Lecturer. During this time, she published her first book AIDS and the Body Politic: Biomedicine and Sexual Difference, which was widely accepted and positively reviewed. The work on her book led to her taking the position of Deputy Director and Senior Research Fellow of the National Center in HIV Social Research at the University of New South Wales in 1999. In 2001, Waldby moved to the United Kingdom and joined Brunel University as the Director of Center for Research in Innovation, Culture and Technology. Waldby moved back to Australia in 2004 becoming a senior lecturer at University of New South Wales, while teaching as a visiting professor at Brunel University. In 2006, she left Brunel University and University of New South Wales and became Professor and Professorial Future Fellow at University of Sydney. While at University of Sydney, she started teaching at King's College, London as a Visiting Professor. Waldby was appointed as the Director of the Research School of Social Sciences at Australian National University in 2015. From 2008 to 2010, she served on the executive board of the Society for Social Studies of Science.  Research and writing  Waldby has made a significant contribution to the discipline of Sociology, in particular to the sociology of biomedicine. Her major contribution to this area is her work on the issues of value, ethics and governance that emerge from biomedical management of the body, particularly the management of human tissues. Her studies have analysed the social economy of human tissues, and the ethical and biopolitical tensions between their status as fragments of particular human bodies and their economic and therapeutic utility. Over the course of her career, she has developed a widely recognized \\"tissue economy\\" approach to the analysis of these developments. =AIDS and the Body Politic = Waldby's first book AIDS and the Body Politic: Biomedicine and Sexual Difference was published in 1996. The book discusses how many of the ideas about HIV and the epidemiology of the disease come from unexamined assumptions about sexual identity. The book was received well. Writing for Review Symposia, G.W. Dowsett wrote that \\"AIDS and the Body Politic: Biomedicine and Sexual Difference represents a significant attempt to build a bridge between science and culture, and to indicate that the chasm between cultural, political and social understandings of the pandemic, and the biomedical understanding of the event of an HIV infection and its syndromic consequence AIDS, is not as wide as one would think.\\" Fran Collyer reviewed the book in Journal of Sociology and called it \\"highly informative.\\" =Tissue Economies= Tissue Economies: Blood, Organs and Cell Lines in Late Capitalism, Waldby's third book, co-authored with Robert Mitchell, was published in 2006. In it, she mapped the transformations of human tissue management (blood, organs, cell lines, embryos) from the post-war welfare state, with its emphasis on distributive justice, gift relations and citizenship, to a competition state and commercialized life science industry, with an emphasis on globalisation and the centrality of markets in the creation of value. In this transformation, human tissues themselves are recalibrated as both intellectual property and forms of commercial productivity, opening up complex questions about property relations and the location of donor populations in the circuits of value creation. This transformation is conventionally presented as a shift from a gift economy for human tissues to a commodity economy. However, she demonstrated that this dichotomy, which structures the majority of bioethical and policy debate, is quite inadequate to understanding the centrality of speculative and promissory forms of value such as patenting of living material in contemporary tissue economies. She demonstrated that, under these historical conditions, the informed consent process, the primary regulatory technology governing the transfer of tissue from donor to recipient, took on some functions of a property contract, by securing the active consent of the donor to relinquish any claims to the future commercial value of their surrendered tissue. Informed consent in this sense becomes a crucial step in securing the conditions for the establishment of the recipient‚Äôs intellectual property claims, and hence right of deployment over future value creation. The book received positive reviews and became Waldby's most cited work. Writing a positive review, Steve Chasin called the book \\"a valuable contribution to understanding the landscape of today's rapidly developing biotechnology industry.\\" Ruth McManus called the book \\"revelatory\\". Writing in Science & Society, Kathryn Russell wrote that \\"there are compelling case studies, a wealth of information about biotechnology and its social context and a captivating critique of the ability of capitalist social relations to generate fantasies of bodily regeneration at the expense of the poor. = Clinical Labor = To sharpen the gender analysis around tissue economies, Waldby developed two new analytic frameworks. One of these is elaborated in her book, Clinical Labor: Tissue donors and Research Subjects in the Global Bioeconomy, co-authored with Melinda Cooper, in which she developed a completely novel \\"precarity\\" approach to these issues that links them to broader concerns around labor rights and protections. In the book, she argued that the increasingly transactional recruitment of tissue donors and clinical research subjects in the commercial biomedical research sectors and the pharmaceutical industry closely resembles other kinds of low-level service labor in the contemporary economy, yet they are not recognised as labor, either within the industrial sector or by regulatory systems. It links women‚Äôs labor in the bioeconomy to earlier debates about domestic labor, and to current debates about contractualisation, outsourcing and human capital theory. In a review of the book in International Journal of Feminist Approaches to Bioethics, Emma Ryman wrote that \\"Providing historical context together with insightful analysis of the rise of clinical labor, Cooper and Waldby give readers a wide ranging, critical look at the role of this hidden workforce within the contemporary bioeconomy.\\" Samuel Walker and Adam Mahoney wrote that \\"this is an important book for anyone interested in biopolitics and political economy, and Cooper and Waldby‚Äôs clinical labor theory of value provides a creative understanding of the post-Fordist regime of labor. =The O√∂cyte Economy = She developed the second framework in her book, The Oocyte Economy: The Changing Meaning of Human Eggs in Fertility, Assisted Reproduction and Stem Cell Research. In this framework, she has focused on gender, consumption and reproductive tissues, considering the ways that women increasingly resort to reproductive medical services, particularly oocyte and embryo banking and fertility tourism to manage key aspects of their life course, including credentialing and family formation, kinship relations, and fertility and aging. This work draws in particular on Raymond Williams‚Äô proposals around ‚Äòthe structure of feeling‚Äô, as a way to account for the deeply felt, historically complex way women value and reason about their oocytes.

Development The P.S.3 was unusual in that the entire wing cellule was designed to have its angle of incidence adjusted from 0¬∞ to 12¬∞ while in flight.Spooner, 1914, p.1072-1074 When set at the maximum, this gave the aircraft a pronounced back- stagger. This was possible because the wing was attached to the fuselage by a single pivot, and controlled by a jackscrew in the cockpit. This allowed for an unusually broad speed range, so that a minimum speed of only was achieved. The fuselage was built up from welded steel tubes, with a square cross section forward tapering to a triangle section aft. One example was built as a floatplane, however unlike most of the landplanes, it was powered by a Canton Unn√© P9 liquid cooled radial in place of the Gnome rotaries normally used. Operational history Although intended as a bomber, it was only ever built in small numbers, and was quickly relegated to use as a trainer, partly because the A√©ronautique Militaire had already chosen the Voisin III as their standard bomber. Victorin Garaix set a number of speed and height records while carrying passengers in 1914. The floatplane was exported to a private buyer the US in 1916, only to later be taken on strength by the United States Navy in April 1917 with the serial A-52, however it was used primarily as a instructional airframe at Pensacola for training groundcrew.Baugher, 2019 Operators ; *A√©ronautique Militaire ; *United States Navy Specifications (Paul Schmitt P.S.3) 3-view drawing from Flight magazine of Paul Schmitt P.S.3 References =Citations= =Bibliography=  Category:1910s French bomber aircraft Category:Paul Schmitt aircraft Category:Rotary-engined aircraft Category:Biplanes ","title":"Paul Schmitt P.S.3"},{"id":"61200925","text":"Hartvig Nielsen (1 April 1908 ‚Äì unknown) was a Danish chess player, Danish Chess Championship medalist (1941).

In 1970 the department producing the rifle was sold to F√∂renade Fabriksverken (FFV), and the production was moved to Carl Gustafs Gev√§rsfaktori in Eskilstuna without large changes. Production in Eskilstuna was ended in 1979.  Copies  It has been claimed that the factory towards the end of the 1970s was instructed to reduce costs, resulting in parts of the production being moved to subcontractors in southern Europe. The quality of the assembled firearm is then claimed to have varied a lot from year to year. After a while copies of the rifle also started appearing on the market, for example under the names \\"Viking 1900\\" and \\"SG 1900\\" (SG meansing svenskt gev√§r, lit. Swedish Rifle).

The bolt travel and magazine was thus fitted according to the cartridge length. These lengths were fitted to calibers such as .222/.223 Rem, .243 Win/.308 Win, 6.5√ó55mm and 30-06.

Just when CG 2000 was about to be launched, Carl Gustaf received a large order from the Swedish Armed Forces for the Kulspruta 58 (ksp m/58, a licensed FN MAG copy). The civilian production of CG 2000 was therefore postponed, and Carl Gustaf instead purchased the rights to import finished and semi-finished rifles from Sauer. Sauer 80 was sold under the name Carl Gustaf 3000, while Sauer 200 was sold as Carl Gustaf 4000. The receivers were made in Germany and had house marks from Sauer. The barrel and stock was usually produced and fitted in Sweden. Some models were produced entirely in Germany. CG 3000 and CG 4000 was sold by Carl Gustaf until they decided to resume production of the model 2000 towards the end of the last century. There are two generations of the CG 2000, which are called MKI and MKII respectively. MKI is said to have had some recurring minor issues, like a weak bolt spring and oil on the bolt spraying towards the shooter when pulling the trigger. Both generations had a detachable single stack magazine. The trigger was made using rollers, and has received some criticism.

He was among the first African Americans to be admitted to the bar of the United States Supreme Court, in 1883, and among the first to argue cases before the Supreme Court. He served as a Justice of the Peace in Washington, DC, from 1890 to 1906.  Early life  = Family background = Hewlett was born in Brooklyn, New York, on November 15, 1850, the son of Aaron Molyneaux Hewlett (c. 1821-December 6, 1871) and Virginia J. Molyneaux Hewlett (c. 1821-1882). He had two sisters, Virginia Lind and Aaronella, and two brothers, Aaron and Paul, a Shakespearean actor who performed under the name \\"Paul Molyneaux.\\"Aaron M. Hewlett (case no. 5155). Middlesex County (Mass.) Probate Packets (1-4720), second series, 1872-1967 (and 4703-19,935). Accessed via Ancestry.com Massachusetts, Wills and Probate Records, 1635-1991 database. Aaron Molyneaux Hewlett in 1859, posing with exercise equipment. Aaron and Virginia Hewlett were part of the nineteenth-century physical culture movement. In 1854 Aaron Hewlett, who had previously worked as a barber and a porter, opened a sparring school called Molineaux House in Brooklyn. The following year the family moved to Worcester, Massachusetts, where he opened a popular gymnasium. This move led to his being hired in 1859 as the first director of Harvard College's new gymnasium, where he worked for fourteen years, serving as an instructor in gymnastics, baseball, rowing, and boxing, coaching sports teams, and managing the gym's equipment. Virginia Hewlett was a gymnastics instructor who held courses for women. They ran a gymnasium in Cambridge together in addition to Aaron's work at Harvard. Aaron Hewlett was active in the fight for civil rights for African Americans in Massachusetts, challenging illegal discrimination in public places and supporting alternatives to discriminatory institutions. In April 1866, after he and one of his daughters were forced by the staff of the Boston Theater to sit in the balcony even though they had purchased tickets for seats in the parquet, he petitioned for changes to Massachusetts' anti-discrimination law, on the grounds that the current law clearly wasn't working. Two years later he was part of a group of twenty people who petitioned to have the license of a Cambridge skating rink revoked on grounds of unlawful discrimination. Also in 1868, he was part of a group that incorporated the Cambridge Land and Building Association, an organization formed to provide loans for African Americans who could not get service from white-run banks. = Education = Hewlett attended Cambridge public schools and graduated from Cambridge High School. He then studied at Boston University School of Law, becoming its first black graduate in 1877.  Legal career  Hewlett practiced law in Boston from 1877 to 1880, then moved to Washington, DC. In 1883 he was admitted to the bar of the United States Court of Claims and the United States Supreme Court bar. In 1890 Hewlett was appointed a justice of the peace for the District of Columbia by President Benjamin Harrison. He was reappointed by presidents Cleveland, McKinley, and Theodore Roosevelt for a total of sixteen years of service. Justices of the peace presided over a \\"poor man's court,\\" with jurisdiction limited to civil cases involving less than $300.00. Nevertheless, this was considered a prestigious appointment for a black attorney. In 1906, when the number of justices of the peace was reduced from ten to six, Hewlett was not reappointed by President Roosevelt. Some in the African American press argued that this was a political decision at the highest level, involving lobbying by national black leader Booker T. Washington in favor of Washington's other black justice of the peace, Robert Terrell. = Supreme Court activities = As a member of the Supreme Court bar, Hewlett was involved in ten cases as counsel or co-counsel, often joining appeals filed on behalf of black southern defendants. He recommended at least two other African American attorneys for admission to the bar, Noah W. Parden of Tennessee in 1906 and Shelby J. Davidson of Kentucky in 1912. Many of the cases with which Hewlett was associated were attempts to win a broad interpretation of the Reconstruction amendments to the Constitution by the Supreme Court by arguing that the civil rights of black defendants, especially the right to equal protection under the law, had been violated through the wilful exclusion of African Americans from juries and grand juries. In Charley Smith v. State of Mississippi 162 U.S. 592 (1896) and John G. Gibson v. State of Mississippi 162 U.S. 565 (1896), Hewlett worked with attorney Cornelius J. Jones to argue that convicted murderers Smith and Gibson had been denied juries of their peers because the juries were empaneled using voter rolls that excluded black citizens. Both cases were dismissed by the court for reasons of lack of jurisdiction; legal scholar R. Volney Riser notes that this may have stemmed from Jones' failure to provide sufficient evidence to interpret the motivations of the Mississippi courts. In Brownfield v. North Carolina 189 U.S. 426 (1903), Hewlett worked with attorneys J.L. Mitchell and W.J. Whipper in a case that made similar arguments, again seeking to overturn a murder conviction on the grounds that black jurors had been excluded due to their race or color. In this case, the court concluded that Hewlett and his colleagues had failed to prove that blacks were purposefully excluded from juries by the administration of the law. In Carter v. Texas 177 U.S. 442 (1900), in which Hewlett served as co- counsel alongside attorney Wilford H. Smith, this tactic was somewhat successful. Smith argued that Seth Carter's indictment for murder should be quashed because no blacks had been chosen to sit on the grand jury that presented it, despite blacks being one-fourth of Galveston, Texas voters. This has been interpreted as a victory for the idea that black defendants were entitled to a jury that included their black peers, making Smith the first African American attorney to successfully argue a case before the Supreme Court; however, the court's decision was narrowly focused on procedure, specifically the fact that Carter had never been given a chance to object to the composition of the grand jury (which had been empaneled before charges were filed against him), in violation of Texas law. In the Ed Johnson case, in which Hewlett acted as co-counsel to Noah Parden, Parden made an argument on equal protection grounds that the trial of Ed Johnson, who faced the death penalty after a conviction for rape, had violated Johnson's Constitutional rights, including through the exclusion of blacks from the jury. Parden succeeded in convincing Justice John Marshall Harlan to stay Johnson's execution until the case could be argued before the full court, but it was never heard because Johnson was taken from the jail in Chattanooga, Tennessee, and lynched. Hewlett did not participate in United States v. Shipp 203 U.S. 563 (1906), the case that resulted from this abrogation of federal authority. = Legal activism = Hewlett also fought against other manifestations of racism and discrimination in his work as an attorney. He filed a number of cases challenging denials of access to public accommodations on his own behalf and for African American clients. In 1884, he sued a steamboat clerk in Washington Police Court after the clerk refused to provide him with the meal to which he was entitled by his ticket. The case was dismissed, with the judge explaining that Hewlett was technically correct, but the government had not \\"maintained the issue\\" of enforcing equal access. In 1889, Hewlett represented George L. Pryor, a black lawyer from Norfolk, Virginia, in a suit against the doorman at Harris' Bijou Theater in Washington who had seated Pryor and a companion at the back of the theater instead of in the seats they had purchased, and in 1900 he was co-counsel in W.T. Ferguson's case against the management of the Grand Opera House. Along with other black Washingtonians, Hewlett used the courts to fight against bars and restaurants violating the Equal Services Acts of 1872 and 1873, local DC laws that barred racial discrimination in bars and restaurants, by refusing to serve black customers or trying to drive them away through tactics like ignoring them or overcharging them. In 1887, he filed a complaint against the popular restaurant Harvey's Oyster House for denying him service. Harvey's was fined $100 but appealed, and eventually the case was dropped. He also pushed back against denial of service in 1907 by alerting the federal marshall in charge of the District of Columbia city hall that a lunchroom in the building had refused to serve him and a black colleague. Although the marshall, who had given the lunchroom operator free use of the space, informed her that discrimination was illegal, she responded by closing the restaurant on the grounds that her white patrons would not share a facility with blacks. Another issue with which Hewlett was engaged was interracial marriage. In 1890 he served as counsel in the cases of Tutty v. State of Georgia and Ward v. State of Georgia, which stemmed from the marriage of Charles Tutty, a white man, and Rosa Ward Tutty, a black woman. They were married in Washington, DC, but when they returned to their home in Georgia, where interracial marriage was illegal, they were arrested and convicted of fornication. On appeal, the question was whether they were committing fornication because they could not legally marry (the prosecution's argument), or incapable of doing so because they were married (the argument of Hewlett and his co-counsel Judge Parker Jordan). In both cases, the guilty verdict was upheld. Hewlett also addressed this issue in his role as justice of the peace. In 1902, he officiated at the wedding of Julia Johnson and George Wilson from Baltimore, who came to Washington and were married in his court because their home state of Maryland prohibited interracial marriage. In 1915, Hewlett was involved with a class- action reparations case filed by Cornelius J. Jones on behalf of a group of former slaves, asserting ownership of $68 million paid in taxes on cotton produced using slave labor between 1859 and 1868. Jones and the case became the target of harassment from the United States Treasury Department and the Post Office in the fall of 1915. In November, Hewlett publicly declared that he \\"sees no merit in the suit\\" and was withdrawing from the case.  Civic activities and activism  In addition to his work as a lawyer and judge, Hewlett was part of a series of real estate and insurance businesses, including the Alpha Law, Real Estate and Collection Company (1892), the Douglass Life Insurance Company (1901) and Hewett, Horner, Watts & Co., a real estate firm (1906). Such firms provided a public service to the black community. White-run companies were often unwilling to conduct real estate transactions or sell insurance to black customers, who they believed were inherently bad risks, so these ventures provided a needed alternative. He belonged to civil rights groups that emerged at the turn of the twentieth century to support the enforcement of the Thirteenth, Fourteenth and Fifteenth amendments and to fight against discrimination, segregation and the Jim Crow legal system, and lynching. He often served as legal counsel. In 1898, he was a founding member of the National Racial Protective Association and the Afro- American Council. During the 1910s and 1920s he was actively involved in the National Equal Rights League, and during World War I he participated in protests in Washington, DC against mistreatment of African American soldiers.Gregory, Thomas Montgomery (June 20, 1919). Report: Negro Situation in Northeast Africa and the Activities of Lawyer Emanuel W. Hewlett. War Department Military Intelligence, Correspondence. 5. http://dh.howard.edu/tmg_intellicorres/5  Personal life  Hewlett remained a bachelor until late in life and had no children. By 1900 he was living as a boarder in the home of Elizabeth P. Brooks, a widow; Hewlett and Brooks were married on August 14, 1920. In 1890, after the death of his sister Virginia Hewlett Douglass (whose father-in-law was Frederick Douglass), he became custodian of Virginia and Frederick Douglass Jr's two minor children, Charles Paul Douglass and Robert Smalls Douglass. Elizabeth Hewlett died in July 1926, aged 77. Emanuel Hewlett died on September 19, 1929, and was interred at Columbian Harmony Cemetery in Washington, DC.

Location  Englschalking is located relatively central in the district of Bogenhausen. The historic town centre lies northeast of the intersection Englschalkinger Stra√üe/Ostpreu√üenstra√üe. In the east Englschalking has developed beyond the Munich East‚ÄìMunich Airport railway to Max-Nadler-Stra√üe, in the south it is bordered by Memeler Stra√üe and Englschalkinger Stra√üe, in the west by Cosimastra√üe and the area of the former Prinz-Eugen-Kaserne and in the north by Fideliostra√üe.  History  St. Nikolaus In the area of Stegm√ºhlstra√üe/Rambaldistra√üe, end Stone Age burials and an Early Bronze Age cemetery were discovered during excavations by the Bavarian State Office for Monument Protection in 1983. At the northern edge of Englschalking, south of Stegm√ºhlstra√üe and east of the Munich S-Bahn, there was a settlement from the Early Middle Ages excavated in 1983. A residential house, an iron smelter, fountain, barns, stables and a cemetery in which 34 burials are documented were found. Jewellery that was found allowed historians to date it back to the 7th century. The foundation of Englschalking is assumed to date back to the 9th or 10th century. Englschalking was first mentioned in a document in 1231/1234 in the Bavarian Duke's urbarium (medieval register of ownership rights of a landlordate). The name is derived from Engelschalch (strict servant) or Englischalcho (also Engilschalko). In 1319 the hamlet of Englschaling was sold by Duke Ludwig to the Hochstift Freising, to which it belonged until secularization in 1803 as part of the county of Ismaning. When the community was included into Bavaria in 1818, Englschalking became part of the community of Daglfing. Most of the buildings in the historic town centre date back to the end of the 19th century. Englschalking achieved some prosperity through the cultivation of moss and brickworks, in which the bricks used in construction in Munich were fired from the clay extracted here. At the beginning of the 20th century, Englschalking developed into the central town of the municipality of Daglfing, partly because a municipal school was opened in 1896 on what is now Schnorr-von-Carolsfeld-Stra√üe. Along with the municipality of Daglfing, Englschalking was incorporated into the city of Munich on 1 January 1930.  Townscape  Primary school on Ostpreu√üenstra√üe Fideliopark The historic centre of Englschalking is a good example of a Haufendorf (ancient heap village). Large farmsteads stand in irregular arrangement around the church of Saint Nicholas, dating back to the 13th century. This village centre, which is a historically listed ensemble of buildings, is about the same size as the village was in the early 19th century. South of the town centre and Englschalkinger Stra√üe lies the large primary school building on Ostpreu√üenstra√üe, a 1930s work by Hermann Leitenstorfer. The original village school, built in the 19th century as a community school for the community of Daglfing on the eastern edge of the old town centre, now serves as a kindergarten. The parish church of Saint Emmeram is also located on Ostpreu√üenstra√üe. To the west of the town centre lies Fideliopark, built in 1966-1970, with three to nineteen-storey apartment blocks. Further west is Cosimapark, built between 1964 and 1969, with four- storey apartment blocks and ten to nineteen-storey skyscrapers surrounded by balconies. On both sides of the railway line, extensive single-family house estates and estates with multi-family houses (such as the Barlowstra√üe estate) have been built since 1978.  Transportation  M√ºnchen-Englschalking stop The railway line from Munich East‚ÄìMunich Airport runs through Englschalking and every 20 minutes the S8 line of the Munich S-Bahn from Herrsching to Munich Airport travels there. The double-track S-Bahn station M√ºnchen- Englschalking, equipped with side-rail platforms, is located here. The tram line to Saint Emmeram which opened in 2011, touches Englschalking along Cosimastra√üe. Currently, line 16 runs on it with connections to Bogenhausen (Arabellapark, Effnerplatz, Herkomerplatz, Ismaninger Stra√üe), to Haidhausen (Klinikum rechts der Isar, Max-Weber-Platz, Wiener Platz, Gasteig, M√ºllersches Volksbad) and to the city centre. The underground line U4 from the city centre does not quite reach Englschalking, but is well connected with three bus lines and one tram line to the Arabellapark terminal. There are plans to extend the underground line 4 from the current end terminal Arabellapark via Fidelio Park to the Englschalking S-Bahn station. The journey time between Bogenhausen and the Munich Airport would be shortened by a few minutes. However, critics are sceptical about extending the rather underutilized U4. Some of the calculated passenger growth has already been absorbed by the new tram line, so that the extension of the subway is currently postponed.

Early years  He was born around 1760 to Muhammad Husayn khan Mushtaq and Qizkhanum (a daughter of Arash noble Muhammad Salih beg). He was sent to Haji Khan by his father to negotiate peace who in turn imprisoned and sent him to be executed by Ibrahim Khalil khan. However, he was spared and kept hidden for 3 years when he was sent to claim his throne in 1783, killing his uncle and cousins after a successful conquest.Abdulhamid, Haji Seyid (1993).

First reign  One of his first acts was to blind his half-brother Fatali and put in house arrest who was more favored by Arash Mahal nobility. Which caused Salim Khan, another half-brother to flee to Djaro-Belokani in 1784/1785. Salim Khan occupied Shaki when Muhammad Hasan travelled to visit new Qajar shah Agha Muhammad in Karabakh on November/December of 1795. While Salim Khan lost the battle near Goynuk, a sudden arrest of Muhammad Hasan by Mostafa khan Davalu (a general under Agha Muhammad) on the charge of treason, led him to re-occupy Shaki using the opportunity. Muhammad Hasan khan was blinded by Qajars and sent to Tabriz as hostage, meanwhile his 7 underage sons were executed by Salim Khan.  Second reign  He was restored to power during Agha Muhammad's reconquest of Transcaucasus in 1797. He deposed Salim Khan on 9 May 1797 with help from Qajars while other sources state he was supported by Mustafa khan of Shirvan. His 8 year long second reign came to an end when his relationship with Shirvan strained again. His domains were invaded by Salim Khan who was now supported by Mustafa khan, however instead of battling, he surrendered himself to Mustafa khan, who spared him and sent viceroys to govern Shaki as a part of Shirvan. While Salim Khan informed his brother Fatali of this betrayal, locals enthroned Fatali Khan instead of Muhammad Hasan in defiance of Shirvan.Acts collected by the Caucasian Archeographic Commission: Volume II, Tbilisi, 1868, p. 643  Later years  He was spared by Mustafa khan spent rest of his life in exile, wandering Quba Khanate, Ottoman Empire, Qajar Iran and Dagestan to gather support. He marched on Gazikumukh Khanate armies on Shaki sometime later in vain, ultimately settled in Tbilisi with his son and was granted with 150 rubles monthly pension. However he was exiled again to Kharkov and Astrakhan by Russian authorities in suspicion related to Shaki revolt of 1814. He died in 1831 and was buried in Shaki Khan's Mosque.  Family  He had at least 8 wives and some issues with them: # Kheyrannisa khanum (a cousin) ## Tuti Agha - married to Ismail Khan Domboli (son of Jafar Qoli Khan Domboli) # Huri khanum (sister of Fatali Khan) ## Abdulla Agha ## Madina Khanum # Javahir khanum (Lezgi) ## Abdul Rahman Agha # Ziba khanum (Udi or Armenian to converted Islam) ## Hashim Agha ## Fahra Khanum ## Amina Khanum # Gulandam khanum (Mountain Jew converted to Islam) # Maryam khanum (Georgian converted to Islam) # Shukufa khanum (Georgian) ## Telli Khanum # Badi Saba khanum (Georgian) ## Zeynab Khanum # Other wives with issues: ## Kafiya khanum ## Asiya khanum ## Sadri khanum Apart from these, he had at least 7 additional sons who were executed in infancy.

This method of fixing a barrel to a receiver has been used extensively by firearms manufacturers since before the 20th century, and can be viewed as a traditional barrel mounting method. Action threads are not the only method of fixing a barrel to a receiver (see Alternative methods below). Furthermore, some firearm designs have moving instead of fixed barrels (e.g. most recoil operated pistols or the Barrett M82 rifle). Action threads must not be confused with muzzle threads, which are used on the other end of the barrel for mounting accessories such as a flash hider, suppressor or muzzle break (compensator).  Designation  There are many systems for designating thread types (metric, unified, Whitworth, etc.). Threading can be specified by diameter, pitch, angle, length and fit tolerances. However, the use of action threads is not well standardized within the firearms industry, and threading can vary between manufacturers and models. For example, factory and aftermarket receivers using the Remington 700 footprint are produced with various types of action threads, all with a diameter, but with a pitch of either a 1.588 mm (16 TPI, Remington standard), 1.411 mm (18 TPI) or 1.270 mm (20 TPI, Savage standard).Bolt Guns - a Survey of Rem 700 Custom Actions  RECOILWEB Typically, many rifles use thread diameters in the range between . Many older rifles from the first half of the 20th century use a thread pitch around 2 mm (12.7 TPI), while many modern rifle use thread pitches around 1.5 mm (16.93 TPI). Fine threaded systems intended for hand tightening typically use thread pitches around 1 mm (25.4 TPI).  Mounting  Using action threads to mount a barrel to a receiver typically requires fitting by a competent gunsmith, and typically some machining has to be done. In this process it is important so set the correct headspace.Brownells - Fitted Barrel Instructions Correct mounting is important both for safety and accuracy.Custom Rifles  Warner Tool Company If the barrel, receiver and bolt are not fitted properly, severe and potential fatal problems can arise due to faulty headspace, e.g. cartridge overpressure and case rupture. Threaded barrels are often mounted to the receiver with a lot of torque, and will therefore generally require tools for assembly and disassembly, such as a suitable action wrench and a vise. Depending on the firearm, a recoil lug is sometimes fitted between the barrel and stock as part of the process, Cleaning up the receiver and barrel action threads is often done during \\"blueprinting\\" in order to increase accuracy.‚ÄúBlueprinting‚Äù (Truing) a Remington 700 Action ‚Äì rifleshooter.com  Alternative methods  Several alternative mounting methods to using action threads exist, for example pressing the barrel into the receiver (e.g. Ansch√ºtz Fortner and Sauer 101Sauer 101 Review  Sporting Rifle magazine \\"This rifle is not a switch barrel, like its predecessor, but fixed. Sauer opted for a non-threaded, heat shrunk, barrel to receiver fitting\\"New Sauer 101 Hunting Rifle from J.P. Sauer & Sohn ¬´ Daily Bulletin \\"Sauer boasts that the barrel is heat-pressed into the receiver, with the bolt locking up directly into the barrel\\") or using a barrel nut (e.g. AR-15). Quick barrel change systems is an increasingly popular alternative, as seen in for example SIG Sauer 200 STR, Roessler Titan or Blaser R8. These methods typically only require simple hand tools (like a hex key) or no tools at all. This can be an great advantage to competition shooters who regularly wear out barrels, or for hunters who want a modular rifle that can shoot several calibers. In these designs, the bolt locks directly into the barrel, and the manufacturer often guarantees that the barrel is headspaced correctly from the factory.

The film centres on a young woman named Gusti (Madge Lessing), one of three sisters who refuse to consider any sort of a relationship with a man, believing that marriage simply confirmed the cruel dominance of men over women. However, Gusti meets a suitable suitor, Dr. Carl Waldeck (Otto Treptow) with whom she falls in love and their growing relationship leads to various comedic situations.

It connects Mpika in Muchinga Province with Mbala in the Northern Province on the border with Tanzania and the Mpulungu port of Lake Tanganyika via Kasama. This stretch of road is commonly known as the Old Great North Road, as the name Great North Road has been given to the T2 Road from Mpika to the border with Tanzania after Nakonde, which is part of the Tanzam Highway, Cape to Cairo Road and Cairo- Cape Town Highway. Route The M1 begins in Mpika, at a junction with the T2 Road (Tanzam Highway; Cape to Cairo Road). It begins by leaving the town in a northwesterly direction and it proceeds northwards, through the villages of the new Kanchibiya District (Kabuko, Katumba, Kasongo and Mpepo), to enter the Northern Province and cross the Chambeshi River at the town of Chandesi. At Chandesi, there is a road going eastwards providing access to the city of Chinsali (Capital of Muchinga Province). The road proceeds northwards to enter the city of Kasama (Capital of Northern Province). The distance from Mpika to Kasama is 214 Kilometres. At a 4-way-junction in Kasama Central, next to the Kasama Golf Club, as the road westwards is the M3 Road to the town of Mansa (Capital of the Luapula Province), the M1 becomes the road northwards from this junction by way of a right turn. At the junction with Milungu Road, the M1 meets a road (D18) which provides access to Mungwi District in the east. The M1 continues northwards for 165 Kilometres, through Nseluka and Senga Hill, to the town of Mbala. It reaches its terminus at a t-junction with the M2 Road, which goes to the Lake Tanganyika port of Mpulungu in the west and to a border with Tanzania in the east. Great North Road The M1 Road was part of the original Great North Road of Zambia, which ran first as the T2 Road from Lusaka (Capital City of Zambia) northwards, continuing by a right turn at Kapiri Mposhi, via a left turn in Mpika to become the M1 Road, to Mbala. But today, The M1 Route from Mpika to Mbala is referred to as the Old Great North Road. This is because the continuation of the T2 from Lusaka, passed Mpika, through Nakonde into Tanzania provides easier access to important towns in Tanzania, including Arusha and the Dar es Salaam sea port for trade. The T2 continuation from Mpika to its end at the Tanzania border after Nakonde is part of the Tanzam Highway (trade route), Cape to Cairo Road (famed road) and Cairo-Cape Town Highway (Trans-African Highway Network no. 4). As a result, it's a more recognized route internationally. But the M1 is still an important route to The Republic of Zambia, as it is the route transporters from the Mpulungu port at Lake Tanganyika use to access the rest of Zambia, transporting imported goods. M2 Road The M2 Road is the road which provides access to the town and port of Mpulungu. From the Lake Tanganyika port of Mpulungu, the M2 Road goes east-south-east for 38 kilometres to reach its junction with the M1 Road in Mbala, next to the Mbala Airport. From the M1 northern terminus, the M2 goes north-east for 26 kilometres to end at a border with Tanzania where it becomes the B8 Road to Sumbawanga in the Rukwa Region.
