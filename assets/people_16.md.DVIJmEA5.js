They were built with four Type 96 anti-aircraft guns in two twin-gun mounts, but more of these guns were added over the course of the war. The ships were also armed with eight torpedo tubes for the oxygen-fueled Type 93 \\"Long Lance\\" torpedo in two quadruple traversing mounts; one reload was carried for each tube. Their anti-submarine weapons comprised 16 depth charges.  Construction and career  Tokitsukaze was laid down on 20 February 1939 at the Uraga Dock Company. The ship was launched on 10 November 1939 and commissioned on 15 December 1940. At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Tokitsukaze, was assigned to Destroyer Division 16 (Desdiv 16), and a member of Destroyer Squadron 2 (Desron 2) of the IJN 2nd Fleet, and had deployed from Palau, as part of the escort for the aircraft carrier in the invasion of the southern Philippines. In early 1942, Tokitsukaze participated in the invasion of the Netherlands East Indies, escorting the invasion forces for Menado, Kendari and Ambon in January, and the invasion forces for Timor and eastern Java in February. On 27‚Äì26 February, she participated in the Battle of the Java Sea, taking part in a torpedo attack on the Allied fleet. During the month of March, Desron 2 was engaged in anti-submarine operations in the Java Sea. At the end of the month, Tokitsukaze deployed from Ambon for the invasion of Western New Guinea. At the end of April, she returned to Kure Naval Arsenal for repairs, docking on 2 May. On 21 May 1942, Tokitsukaze and Desron 2 steamed from Kure to Saipan, where they rendezvoused with a troop convoy and sailed toward Midway Island. Due to the defeat of the Carrier Striking Force and loss of four fleet carriers in the Battle of Midway, the invasion was called off and the convoy withdrew without seeing combat. Desdiv 16 was ordered back to Kure. On 14 July, Tokitsukaze was reassigned to the IJN 3rd Fleet and was assigned to escort the transport Nankai Maru to Rabaul, returning with the cruiser to Kure in mid-August. Tokitsukaze returned to the Solomon Islands before the end of the month, in time to participate in the Battle of the Eastern Solomons on 24 August, as an escort to Ry≈´j≈ç and the cruiser . After the battle, she assisted in the rescue of the survivors from Ry≈´j≈ç and spent the month of September on patrols based out of Truk. She escorted the damaged carrier to Kure for repairs in mid-October. During the Battle of Santa Cruz Islands on 26 October, she was part of Admiral Nagumo‚Äôs Strike Force. In early November, she returned to Kure with , and participated in training exercises in the Inland Sea through the end of the year. After redeploying to Shortland Island, on 10 January, while providing cover for a supply-drum transport run to Guadalcanal, Tokitsukaze assisted in sinking the American PT boats PT-43 and PT-112. Through the end of February, she continued to be used as a high speed transport in the evacuation of Japanese forces from Guadalcanal. During the Battle of Bismarck Sea on 3 March 1943, Tokitsukaze was damaged by an Allied air attack, which killed 19 crewmen and left her dead in the water. Her skipper, Cdr Masayoshi Motokura, gave the order to abandon ship, and the survivors were taken aboard the destroyer . The abandoned vessel was discovered southeast of Finschhafen and sunk by Allied aircraft the following morning at coordinates (). She was removed from the navy list on 1 April 1943.

The Cointet-element, also known as a Belgian Gate or C-element, was a heavy steel fence about three metres wide and two metres high, typically mounted on concrete rollers, used as a mobile anti-tank obstacle during World War II. Each individual fence element weighed about 1,280 kg but was movable (e.g. with two horses) through the use of two fixed and one rotating roller. Its invention is attributed to a French colonel, L√©on-Edmond de Cointet de Fillain (1870‚Äì1948, later to become general), who came up with the idea in 1933 during the run-up to World War II, as to be used in the Maginot Line. Besides their use as barricades to the entrances of forts, bridges and roads, the heavy fences are best known for their use in the Belgian Iron Wall of the KW-line and their re-use as beach obstacles on the Atlantikwall.  History  The Cointet-element formed the main barricade of the Belgian KW-line, a tank barricade that was built between September 1939 and May 1940. Following tests, the Belgian Army accepted the Cointet-elements in 1936 after slightly altering the design by the addition of eight vertical beams in the front frame to avoid penetration by infantry. On 13 February 1939 and 24 July 1939 the first tenders were called for ten groups of five hundred Cointets each. A total of 77,000 pieces were ordered by the Belgian Ministry of Defence and produced by twenty-eight Belgian companies with 73,600 pieces delivered.TUYTELEERS, Wim, Het Belgische Cointet-element, 2014, 198 p., Thousands of Cointets were installed on the KW-line between the village Koningshooikt and city Wavre to act as the main line of defence, against a possible German armoured invasion through the heartland of Belgium, forming a long iron wall. The Cointet- elements were placed next to each other in a zig-zag and connected with steel cables. Near main roads they were fixed to heavy concrete pillars that were fixed into the ground to allow local traffic passage. In May 1940 however, due to a relocation programme, the elements did not form a continuous line and thus were easily bypassed by the 3rd and 4th Panzer Divisions. After the German victory in Belgium on 28 May 1940, the Belgian Gates were reallocated across Europe to serve as German barricade elements on roads, bridges and beaches. The Germans gave it the name C-element. Large numbers of gates were brought to Normandy during the construction of the Atlantikwall to be used with the other varieties of beach obstacles. Instead of connecting them, the Germans used them singly next to other items, especially at the low tide line. They were also put on the dikes next to bunkers. Notes from 1944 cite the placement of 23,408 Cointets over of coastline. With many more still present in Belgium after D-Day, the Allies had great difficulty passing them in the last months of the war.

After genetic analysis, officials have agreed to include the riflebirds (formerly assigned to the genus Ptiloris) in the present genus. All members sport a jet-black to black body found only in males, while their female counterparts sport brown upperparts (shade depends on the species) with barred underparts; they have a relatively long to shortish, slender, crow-like bill, and various ornaments. Superb, Vogelkop superb (or crescent-caped), and the disputed lesser superb birds-of-paradise, or lophorinas, have a distinctive cape found on the nape that they push forward, an iridescent blue-green crown, and an iridescent blue-greenish breast shield that appears to be \\"smiling\\" (L. superba) and \\"frowning\\" (L. niedda) that the males use to court females. When in full display, the birds look like an otherworldly cartoon character with a fully black face, blue eyes, and blue mouth as they hop and dance around a potential mate. The riflebirds, however, sport an iridescent-blue throat shield, which is more or less visible in some species, and mostly all-black bodies. L. victoriae and L. paradisea have metallic greenish-blue, scale-like feathers on the belly to the undertail coverts, which they fluff up during their courtship displays. L. magnifica and L. intercedens have elongated filamental flank feathers that are extremely soft. Riflebirds' displays consist of the males expanding their rounded wings up over their heads to appear disk shaped, flapping the wings to make a woosh sound, and jerking their head side to side along with its throat shield, engulfing the female in his performance, often getting very close to her face.  Etymology  The generic name \\"Lophorina\\" consists of the words lophos, meaning crest or tuft, and rhinos, meaning nose. The word literally means \\"tuft nose\\", which refers to the tufts present on the superb species above and behind each nostril.  Taxonomy  The genus contains seven species: *Superb bird-of-paradise, also known as the greater superb bird-of-paradise or as the greater lophorina, (Lophorina superba), the sole species in the genus until 2018. *Vogelkop superb bird-of-paradise, or crescent-caped lophorina (Lophorina niedda), elevated from subspecies to species in 2018 *Lesser superb bird-of-paradise, or lesser lophorina (Lophorina minor), though this species' validity is disputed. Generally considered a subspecies of Lophorina superba. *Magnificent riflebird (Lophorina magnifica) *Growling riflebird (Lophorina intercedens), once considered conspecific with L. magnifica, but was split on account of its smaller size and different physical and vocal characters. *Paradise riflebird (Lophorina paradisea) *Victoria's riflebird (Lophorina victoriae) See also * Bird-of-paradise References Category:Bird genera ","title":"Lophorina"},{"id":"5050208","text":"Icons.com is an online retailer of authentic signed sports memorabilia based in Kentish Town, London.

On 5 June, the day after the main Battle of Midway, Tanikaze was sent by Admiral Nagumo to ensure the last IJN aircraft carrier had actually sunk, to scuttle her if necessary, and collect any survivors. Tanikaze had the unfortunate luck of being seen by 61 US Dauntless dive bombers sent to destroy Hiry≈´ if she was still afloat. After they were unable to locate the aircraft carrier (she had sunk about an hour earlier), the dive bombers turned back to simultaneously attack the hapless Japanese destroyer, since their bombs needed to be jettisoned before landing anyway. Through aggressive maneuvering (zig zagging) by the ship's Captain Katsumi Motoi (ÂãùË¶ã Âü∫), not one of the 61 dive bombers managed a direct hit.

Coconino Sandstone is a geologic formation named after its exposure in Coconino County, Arizona. This formation spreads across the Colorado Plateau province of the United States, including northern Arizona, northwest Colorado, Nevada, and Utah. Vertebrate tracks known as Chelichnus gigas from the Coconino Sandstone in Grand Canyon. This rock formation is particularly prominent in the Grand Canyon, where it is visible as a prominent white cliff- forming layer. The thickness of the formation varies due to regional structural features; in the Grand Canyon area it is only 65 ft thick in the west, thickens to over 600 ft in the middle and then thins to 57 ft in the east. Either the Kaibab Limestone or Toroweap Formation overlies the Coconino Sandstone. The Coconino Sandstone is typically buff to white in color. It consists primarily of fine well-sorted quartz grains, with minor amounts of potassium feldspar grains deposited by eolian processes (wind-deposited) approximately 275 million years ago. Several structural features such as ripple marks, sand dune deposits, rain patches, slump marks, and fossil tracks are not only well preserved within the formation, but also contribute evidence of its eolian origin.McKee, E.D.

They are treasures which embody not only the technical brilliance of the composer but also offer a peep into the advaitic school of Hindu philosophy and elements of Tantric rituals. They are very elaborate compositions which may be well compared with major symphonies in the Western system. Overview These songs are set in praise of the Goddess Kamalamba who is enshrined in Tiruvarur in the Tanjore district of Tamil Nadu in South India. The Goddess is the reference to the Divine Mother of the universe, or the Supreme Consciousness. The lyrics and the descriptive details are loaded with the mystical symbolism of the Vedantic (advaita) tradition and the chakras of the human system are closely linked to the evolutionary aspects described in the compositions that reflect the scholarly reach, musical depth and mystical significance of the composer. Navavarna refers to the 9 layers of the Sri Chakra yantra, one of the primary modes of Devi worship. Each avarna has a deity associated with it, which is mentioned in each of the songs. Musically, they are par excellence and the majestic sweep of well known ragas (melodic forms) like Todi, Kalyani, Kambhoji, Sankarabharanam, Sahana, Anandabhairavi and Bhairavi are offset against haunting melodies in lesser known ragas like Punnagavarali, Ghanta and Ahiri.http://www.medieval.org/music/world/carnatic/lyrics/srao/kamala.html Dikshitar uses several talas (time measures) although Rupakam (3 beats) seems to be his favourite. Ata talam (14 beats) and Misra Jampa (10 beats) in the Kambhoji and Bhairavi pieces are rarely used because of the technical difficulty in executing these. An added element is the use of different case endings (which Dikshitar uses in his other group krities, like the Abhayamba and Nilotpalamba set). The Dhyana (invocatory) kriti in Todi is in the vocative case, followed by the Anandabhairavi in the nominative, Kalyani in the accusative, Sankarabharanam in the instrumental, Kambhoji in the dative, Bhairavi in the ablative and so on. The ninth avarana kriti in Ahiri has all the cases; the raga itself has all the 22 Sruti (notes) in the octave. It is believed that such a fusion of all melodic and temporal elements in the same kriti is a musical way of expressing the advaitic ideal of \\"aham Brahmasmi\\" or complete union with the Absolute. Indeed, the Ahiri composition is very unusual musically especially the pallavi which has a repeating and distinctive prose sections, are seamlessly put together. The set concludes with a short and sweet mangalam (auspicious conclusion) in Sri ragam set in Khanda Ekam (5 beat talam). The entire set consists therefore of the dhyanam (invocation), the nine avaranas, and the mangalam (conclusion), a total of 11 pieces. Kritis The rendition of this classic cycle of compositions begin with an invocatory song on Lord Ganesha and Lord Muruga. # Sri Maha Ganapathiravathu mam - Goula - Misra Chapu # Balasubramanyam Bhajeham - Surutti - Adi. The 11 kritis are as follows: # Kamalambike - Thodi - Rupakam (Dhyana Krithi) # Kamalamba Samrakshathu - Anandabhairavi - Misra Chapu # Kamalambaam Bhajare - Kalyani - Adi # Sri Kamalambikaya Katakshitoham - Shankarabharanam - Rupakam # Kamalambikayai - Kambhoji - (Khanda) Ata # Sri Kamalambayah param - Bhairavi - Misra Jampa # Kamalambikayaastava - Punnagavarali - Rupakam # Sri Kamalambikayam - Sahana - Tisra Triputa # Sri Kamalambike - Ghanta - Adi # Sri Kamalamba Jayati - Ahiri - Rupakam # Sri Kamalambike - Sri - Khanda Ekam (Mangala krithi) One of the specialities of this group set is the usage of Vibhakti or declension of the noun \\"Kamalamba\\" i.e., \\"‡§ï‡§Æ‡§≤‡§æ‡§Ç‡§¨‡§æ\\" in 8 cases like: ‡§ï‡§Æ‡§≤‡§æ‡§Ç‡§¨‡§æ, ‡§ï‡§Æ‡§≤‡§æ‡§Ç‡§¨‡§æ‡§Ç, ‡§ï‡§Æ‡§≤‡§æ‡§Ç‡§¨‡§ø‡§ï‡§Ø‡§æ, ‡§ï‡§Æ‡§≤‡§æ‡§Ç‡§¨‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ‡§Ø‡•à, ‡§ï‡§Æ‡§≤‡§æ‡§Ç‡§¨‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§É, ‡§ï‡§Æ‡§≤‡§æ‡§Ç‡§¨‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§É, ‡§ï‡§Æ‡§≤‡§æ‡§Ç‡§¨‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ‡§Ø‡§æ‡§Ç, ‡§ï‡§Æ‡§≤‡§æ‡§Ç‡§¨‡§ø‡§ï‡•á. The Dhyana krithi, krithi for the eighth chakram, and Mangala krithi use the last declension. The Ahiri krithi can be decomposed so, to detail about the use of declensions of the noun. Pallavi: 1st vibhakthi Anupallavi: 1st two lines - 2nd vibhakthi Next two lines (Madhyama kala sahityam) - 3rd vibhakthi Charanam: 1st line - 4th vibhakthi 2nd line - 5th vibhakthi 3rd line - 6th vibhakthi 4th line - 7th vibhakthi Madhyama kala sahityam - 8th vibhakthi. The rendering of these Kritis are considered to be extremely challenging owing to the complexity of the words and the notations. The D.K. Pattamal and D.K. Jayaraman school are considered to be specialists in the rendering of these compositions. It requires years of training to render them to perfection. Sri Muthuswamy Dikshitar was a great Devi Upasaka and was well versed in all aspects of Sri Vidya Upasana. Out of his devotion to Sri Kamalamba, (one of the 64 Sakti Peethams in India), the celebrated deity at the famous Tyagaraja Temple in Tiruvarur and his compassion for all bhaktas, Sri Muthuswamy Dikshitar composed the Kamalamba Navavarana kritis, expounding in each of the nine kritis, the details of the each avarana of the Sri Chakra, including the devatas and the yoginis. Singing these kritis with devotion, sraddha and understanding would be the easy way to Sri Vidya Upasana.

Do we not all assume a perfectly illogical conception of Truth as an entity of \\"the supra-mundane order, whence a whirling flame and flying Light subsist?\\" Do we not instinctively assimilate these ideas of Truth and Light, though there is no rational nexus? Is it not clear, then, that we do understand each other perfectly, so far as we can understand each other at all, in a sphere such as Zoroaster calls \\"Intelligible,\\" which \\"subsisteth beyond Mind' but which we should \\"seek to grasp with the Flower of Mind\\"?

Hasel, however, was only mentioned in 1225 as Hasela. The village has since been called Hasle (1261), Hassly (1531), and Hassle (1574). The name can be traced back to the Old High German word hasal, meaning hazel bush. In the Middle Ages, Hasle was part of the Grafschaft Kyburg. From 1384, it was ruled by Bern. In 1525, the village became part of the office of a village mayor Burgdorf. After the collapse of the Ancien R√©gime in 1798, during the Helvetic Republic, Hasle became a part of the district (Distrikt) of Burgdorf; from 1803, it was part of the Oberamt of Burgdorf, which became a district (Amtsbezirk) in 1831. Geography Aerial view from 300 m by Walter Mittelholzer (1923) Hasle bei Burgdorf has an area of . Of this area, or 58.8% is used for agricultural purposes, while or 32.5% is forested. Of the rest of the land, or 7.7% is settled (buildings or roads), or 0.9% is either rivers or lakes and or 0.0% is unproductive land.Swiss Federal Statistical Office-Land Use Statistics 2009 data accessed 25 March 2010 Of the built up area, housing and buildings made up 3.3% and transportation infrastructure made up 3.2%. Out of the forested land, 30.7% of the total land area is heavily forested and 1.8% is covered with orchards or small clusters of trees. Of the agricultural land, 22.5% is used for growing crops and 34.1% is pastures, while 2.2% is used for orchards or vine crops. All the water in the municipality is flowing water. The municipality is located along the Emme river and in the Bigen and Biembach valleys at elevations of . It consists of the villages of Hasle, Goldbach, Schafhausen and Biembach along with hamlets and farm houses. Hasle bei Burgdorf is located as the crow flies southeast of the district capital Burgdorf. It is in the Emmental in the floodplain on the left shore of the Emme in the molasse hills of the higher Swiss plateau. The northeastern border of the municipality runs along the Emme. The main settlement area is the floodplain and the rock terrace, which is about higher than the river bed. In the area by Hasle bei Burgdorf, the Emmental is about wide. From the Southwest and the South four other valleys meet the Emmental: Biembachtal, Bigental, Talgraben and Goldbachtal. Almost the whole watershed of the Biembachtal belongs to Hasle bei Burgdorf, while only the lower segments the other valleys are located in the municipality. The entire southern and western part of the municipality is covered by¬¥the molasse hills between Emmental and Aaretal. This landscape is characterized by hill crests as well as valleys and trenches, which are often very steep - this makes agricultural use of the land very difficult. Therefore, the hills are dominated by pasture and forests from a certain height. The hills reach an average height of above sea level. On the W√§gesse a broad crest between Biembachtal and the Widimattgraben - another valley - the highest point in Hasle bei Burgdorf is reached with above sea level. On 31 December 2009 Amtsbezirk Burgdorf, the municipality's former district, was dissolved.

His maternal grandparents were President Thomas Jefferson and his wife Martha; his paternal grandparents were Francis Wayles Eppes VI, also a prominent planter in Virginia, and his wife Elizabeth Wayles, half-sister to Martha Wayles Skelton Jefferson. After marrying and moving in 1829 from Virginia with his family to near Tallahassee, Florida, Eppes established a cotton plantation. His first wife died and in 1837 he married a second time. With both wives, he had a total of 13 children. Long interested in education, in 1856 Eppes donated land and money to designate a school in Tallahassee as one of the first two state-supported seminaries, now known as Florida State University. He served as president of its board of trustees for eight years. Biography Francis Wayles Eppes was born in 1801, the second child of Maria (n√©e Jefferson) and John Wayles Eppes. He was born at Monticello, his maternal grandfather's plantation in Albemarle County, Virginia. When he was born, his parents resided at Mont Blanco plantation in Chesterfield. He was the only one of three Eppes children to survive childhood. After his mother died in 1804 when he was three, soon after the birth of her third child, Eppes' father moved his household and slaves from Mont Blanco, to another of his plantations, Millbrook, in Buckingham County. Francis spent much time at nearby Monticello with his maternal aunt Martha Randolph and his grandfather, the widower Thomas Jefferson. At his father's plantation, he was cared for by the slave Betsy Hemmings, later called \\"Mam Bess.\\" Jefferson had given her to Eppes' parents at their wedding. She was the daughter of Mary Hemings and the granddaughter of Betty Hemings, who was held by the Jeffersons at Monticello. Among his early nurses was Critta Hemings Bowles, an aunt of Betsy Hemmings. Eppes studied law, but never completed his legal studies. =Marriage and family= At the age of 21, Francis married Mary Elizabeth Cleland Randolph (January 16, 1801 ‚Äì April 15, 1835), the daughter of Thomas Eston Randolph and his wife, Jane Cary (Randolph) Randolph, on November 18, 1822.

They moved to Poplar Forest plantation in Bedford County, Virginia, which was built by his grandfather Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson had originally planned this plantation for his daughter Maria, but she died in April 1804 at age 25. He designated it as his grandson Francis' inheritance. Poplar Forest was the only Jefferson property to pass to the intended heir. Jefferson's debts disrupted the rest of his bequests after his death in 1826. In 1827 after Jefferson's death, Eppes purchased and freed the elder slave Critta Hemings Bowles, who had been his fourth nurse when he was an infant. She had long been married to Zachariah Bowles, a free man of color.\\"Critta Hemings Bowles\\", Plantation and Slavery, Monticello, accessed 21 March 2011 The Eppeses lived at Poplar Forest until 1828, when they decided to move to Florida. By that time they had buried three children at the Jefferson family cemetery at Monticello. Both his father and Jefferson had died by then. Believing Poplar Forest to be too isolated, Eppes was ready to try his fortunes elsewhere. Florida was being rapidly developed for cotton production. In 1829, he moved with his family to Leon County, Florida, settling just east of Tallahassee. Such moves broke up both planters' and slaves' families. The Eppes took numerous slaves with them, among them grown descendants of Betsy Hemmings, who was given to Francis by his father as a wedding present.\\"Betsy Hemmings: Loved by a Family, but What of Her Own?\\", Plantation & Slavery/Life after Monticello, Monticello, 14 February 2011 His first wife died in 1835 following the birth of her sixth child. Two years later, Eppes married Susan Margaret Ware Crouch (February 14, 1815 ‚Äì September 1, 1887), the widowed daughter of U.S. Senator Nicholas Ware, of Georgia. They had seven children together. With his two wives, Eppes was father to a total of thirteen children, but at least three died in childhood in Virginia. Career He established the Francis Eppes Plantation in Leon County, Florida, raising cotton as a commodity crop by the use of extensive slave labor. In the antebellum period, cotton prices were high and there was extensive trade with England. Eppes took an active interest in educational issues in Florida. In Tallahassee, he began 35 years of distinguished service to his community. He was a founding member of the Episcopal Church there. In 1833, Eppes was appointed one of fourteen justices of the peace in Leon County. Eppes was elected to serve as a Deputy to the 1838 General Convention of the Episcopal Church, held that year in Philadelphia. Among its actions, the Convention officially admitted the Diocese of Florida. Eppes first served as intendant (mayor) of Tallahassee from 1841‚Äì1844 and then again from 1856‚Äì1857. His first election was largely due to a rise in sentiment against lawlessness, particularly duels among leading men in territorial Florida. Florida Militia Brigadier General Leigh Read had recently been killed by Willis Alston, in a case attracting much attention. Read had earlier killed Willis' brother Augustus Alston in a duel.Pamela Chase Hain, Murder in the State Capitol: The Biography of Lieutenant Colonel Robert Augustus Alston (1832‚Äì1879), Mercer University Press, 2013, p. 12\\"George T. Ward Secession Broadside,\\" Special Collection, Robert Manning Strozier Library, Florida State University Baptist, Edward E., Creating an Old South, University of North Carolina Press, 2002, p. 197 Eppes appointed six officers, who are considered the beginning of the Tallahassee Police Department. In 1851, the Florida Legislature authorized two seminaries of higher learning in Florida. One seminary was to be located west of the Suwannee River and one to the east of the river. In 1854, Eppes tried to gain approval for the western seminary to be located in Tallahassee, but was rejected. In 1856, Eppes initiated the proposal again and offered to fund an initial endowment of $10,000, plus a $2,000 per year stipend and a new building. The legislature accepted the proposal. That year, the existing Florida Institute in Tallahassee was designated as the State Seminary West of the Suwannee River. Classes began in 1857. Eppes served on the seminary's board of trustees for eleven years; for the last eight of those years, he served as president of the board. The seminary later developed as Florida State University. Eppes died on May 10, 1881 and was buried at Greenwood Cemetery. Three of his children by his first wife had died earlier in Virginia. They were buried at the Jefferson family cemetery at Monticello. Also buried there were Francis' Jefferson grandparents and mother, Maria. Later, at least three of his grandchildren were also buried there. Since the late 19th century, the cemetery has been owned and operated by the Monticello Association, a private lineage society of descendants of Jefferson and Martha Wayles. (This property is separate from the Monticello plantation, which is owned and operated by the Thomas Jefferson Foundation.) Legacy and controversy In 1995, Florida State University established the Jefferson‚ÄìEppes Trophy to honor Eppes and his grandfather Thomas Jefferson. A statue of Eppes was installed to commemorate him at the university.Andrew Waber, \\"Eppes statue\\", Public History project: Exploring FSU's Past, Florida State University In 2016, the Eppes statue was the subject of a non-binding removal referendum introduced by the FSU chapter of Students for a Democratic Society because Eppes owned slaves.

As a newspaper photographer, Tames was a regular on Capitol Hill over a span of forty years. Biography Born in Washington, D.C., Tames was a first generation immigrant of Greek - Albanian descent who couldn't speak English when he went to school. He dropped out of high school in the tenth grade, and took a job as an officeboy in the Washington bureau of Time-Life to help out the family. His career in photography began in 1940 in Washington D.C. Tames went with the Capitol Hill photographers on assignments and eventually photographed individual members. He photographed meetings of the Truman Committee. He developed access to and captured the likeness of numerous members of the United States Congress, and had his work reproduced in many influential publications. He developed a style contrary to the \\"herd instinct\\" of press photographers, demonstrating his artistic eye, sense of place, and special intimacy with his subjects. Married to Frances Owens (1921‚Äì1996). Children: Chris, Pamela, Kathryn, Stephanie, Michael Photography Tames took countless Washington shots, but (by his own admission) is particularly remembered for one, \\"The Loneliest Job,\\" a photograph of President John F. Kennedy. President Kennedy's iconic stance staring down at the table in front of him is all the more fascinating insofar as Kennedy was actually reading a copy of Tames' paper, The New York Times. Tames recalled later that Kennedy was reading a column by editorial columnist Arthur Krock on the table in front of him by the window of the Oval Office. Tames' daughter, Stephanie, recalls in an August 2010 essay for Salon the story of this enduring and iconic photograph by her father: \\"By the way, the morning my father made the picture of JFK at the window, the president was reading the Times. He had gotten to the editorial page. My father said, 'He looked over and he saw me. He hadn't been aware that I took that picture from the back, but he saw me when I moved to the side there. He glanced over at me, and he said: \\"I wonder where Mr. Krock gets all the crap he puts in this horseshit column of his.\\" Apparently he was much upset about Mr. Krock's column that day.'\\" As he explained in an interview late in life, Tames took the photograph through the door of the Oval Office, after Kennedy thought he had left: Tames' work is the subject of an exhibit at the Averitt Center for the Arts in Statesboro, Ga, which opened on Friday, May 6, 2011. Featured in the exhibit is Tames' \\"The Loneliest Job\\" as well as photographs from President Franklin D. Roosevelt through President George H.W. Bush. The New York Times' Jim Mones attended the opening reception of the Averitt Center's exhibit and delivered remarks on Tames' career and his work for the newspaper. Quotations *\\"'Why are you a Democrat?' I say, 'I was born into the Democratic party, the same way I was born into the Greek Orthodox Church.'\\" *\\"If there is anyone that should be a Republican or an ultra conservative, it's me, because I have not only conquered the fact that I had only a tenth grade education, but based on the friendships that I made, and the betting on people, like Mr. J.

She became Member of the Order of Canada in 1978 and was inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame in 1996.  Personal life  Ellen Danby was born in Amsterdam, Netherlands, to Jewish parents who met in England. She learned German and English at home and Dutch and French in school. In the spring of 1943, she and her family were sent to Westerbork transit camp. Ellen had herself registered at Westerbork as the 'Dutch National Figure Skating Champion', at that time such a championship did not exist, the first official one to be held in 1951. Westerbork's commander, , was very interested in figure skating and ordered that Ellen's skates and apparel be sent to the camp. There she was allowed to practice on the frozen pond. Ellen also gave culinary advice at Gemmeker's home and it was the commander's female companion who made sure Ellen was not sent to Sobibor but to Theresienstadt instead. Her parents and grandmother were sent to Sobibor extermination camp only to be killed there. Danby met Czech-born artist, Jan Burka, at Theresienstadt concentration camp. After liberation of the camp by the Soviet Union Army the two walked from Theresienstadt (near Prague) to Ellen's hometown Amsterdam (about 900 kilometres/560 miles) in just 2 weeks time to get married on non-communist soil. The family moved to Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 1950. Ellen and Jan Burka divorced in the mid-1950s. She raised her two daughters, Petra and Astra, in the Anglican Church and told them of her background when they were in their late teens. She died in Toronto on September 12, 2016.  Career  Burka was Dutch National Champion in 1946 and 1947 before becoming a coach in Toronto. Finding Canadian figure skating to be rigid and technical, she decided to blend it with ballet and modern dance, and introduced more imaginative choreography. She coached her daughter Petra Burka to a bronze medal for Canada at the 1964 Olympics and to the gold at the 1965 World Championships. In 1968, she became the coach of Toller Cranston, who won six Canadian national titles and the 1976 Olympic bronze medal. She also coached Dorothy Hamill, Elvis Stojko, Sandra Bezic / Val Bezic, Patrick Chan, Tracey Wainman, Christopher Bowman and many other world and Olympic competitors. In 1978, Burka was made Member of the Order of Canada \\"For elevating skating to an art form and for imaginative choreography on the ice\\". In 1996, she was inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame. She was also inducted into the Canadian Figure Skating Hall of Fame, the Etobicoke Sports Hall of Fame and the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame (October 2013). A documentary about Ellen Burka, Skate to Survive, was directed by her daughter Astra and premiered at the Toronto Jewish Film Festival in May 2008. Virtually unknown in her native Netherlands, her life story was captured in Andere Tijden Sport, a sports history program on Dutch national public TV, in January 2015. For this documentary, she returned to Amsterdam to visit her former family home and the Westerbork transit camp. Burka taught at the Toronto Cricket, Skating and Curling Club and at The Granite Club in Toronto, Ontario.

In 2019 the monks returned to a restored abbey at St, Georgenberg, which had remained a place of pilgrimage and spiritual retreat. History According to tradition, the site's first use was as a hermitage in about the middle of the 10th century by Blessed Rathold (or Rapoto) of Aibling, of the ancient noble family of the Rapotonen. He established his cell on the Georgenberg (\\"St. George's Mount\\"), a rocky outcrop rising some hundred metres above the Stallental valley near Stans.The earliest documentation on this subject is the abbey's first printed chronicle of about 1480. Saint George is the patron saint of Aibling. Substantial donations to the community beginning about 1000 from Albuin, Bishop of Brixen, and in 1097 from Emperor Henry IV suggest that by that time there was already a well-established monastery here rather than a simple hermitage. The religious community at St. Georgenberg was turned into a Benedictine abbey in 1138 by Reginbert, Bishop of Brixen; the papal charter of confirmation is dated 30 April 1138. On 31 October 1705 there occurred the fourth in a series of disastrous fires which ruined all the buildings, and the abbey was moved to a new site at Fiecht in the Inn valley. It became operative there in 1708. 180px  Move from St. Georgenberg to Fiecht  Because of lack of funds, however, the new conventual buildings and church at Fiecht Abbey (begun in 1741 and finished in 1750; its tower was finished as late as 1781) were uniquely modest in their construction, but for that very reason are the more impressive as examples of Baroque architecture. Only the inside of the church and the trompe l'oeil fa√ßade were finished in the typical style of the era: stuccoists of the Wessobrunn School, such as Franz Xaver Feuchtmayer the Elder and his brother Michael, the frescoist Matth√§us G√ºnther and other renowned sculptors from the Tyrol and elsewhere were engaged for these parts of the construction, visible only from the monastic buildings, After the Treaty of Pressburg in 1806 the Tyrol passed from Austria to Bavaria and Fiecht Abbey was suppressed by the Bavarian government in 1807, but restored in 1816 when the Tyrol was restored to Austria. It suffered from another serious fire in 1868 which ruined most of the collection of graphic art, but spared most of the library. Between 1941 and 1945 the abbey was impounded by the Gestapo and the monks were exiled, to return after the end of World War II. After 1967 the abbey became a member of the Ottilien Congregation (Missionary Benedictines) of the Benedictine Confederation.  Move from Fiecht back to St. Georgenberg  In June 2016, the nine monks remaining in the monastery in Fiecht determined to move up the valley to the craggy site of St. Georgenberg, which had remained a popular place of pilgrimage and reflection, and which had been their monastery from the 11th to the 18th century. Fiecht was sold on 28 June 2018 as renovations proceeded on their mountain home. In the Summer of 2019 the monks returned to St. Georgenberg, Pilgrimage churches on the Georgenberg alt= Pilgrimages here began around 1100 and increased after the \\"blood miracle\\" that is reported to have happened in about 1310. The main objects of veneration are Saint George, a Gothic Piet√† sculpture from about 1415 and the reliquary of the Holy Blood.In addition, the chronicle of 1480 lists relics of 132 saints The present Baroque church, dedicated to Saints George and James, was built after the 1705 fire on the site and to the approximate ground plan of the old church. St. Georgenberg remained a place of pilgrimage even after the monks moved to the city in the valley below. The new building was finished in 1735, with further alterations in 1863 (frescoes) and 1866. The Lindenkirche, a small church dedicated to Saint Mary, existed as a stone building from about 1230 and housed the Piet√† until it was transferred to the larger rebuilt church of Saints George and James in 1736. Major changes to the building were made in 1759 and 1882, but its Romanesque porch is still intact.Data from official Tiroler Kunstkataster: see external links To provide access to the monastery without strenuous climbing, a bridge was constructed by the 15th century, and restored by 1709, after the great fire. Its name is the Hohe Br√ºcke (\\"high bridge\\"). When walking up from Stans, however, many pilgrims still take the route that leads through the romantic Wolfsklamm gorge.

With the closure of John Haig, one source of members was stopped; however, the club survives. The current membership displays an eclectic range of backgrounds; while many members have Markinch roots, others appear to have joined through happenstance. Until 2009, though, all members shared a common gender. Ladies had never featured in the membership lists, although they had occasionally been drafted in to prevent a rink from being a \\"man\\" short in a game; none, however, had ever attended a Markinch Curling Club supper - other than as waitress or barmaid - until December 2008, when Morag Erskine was present as a representative of Pitlessie Curling Club. After this ground-breaking event, Morag's name, along with those of Marianne Sankey (a Committee member as of the AGM on 13th. April 2016) and Karen Turley, featured in the list of members. While meteoric is not a word usually associated with the roaring game, it would be appropriate to describe Morag Erskine's progress in Markinch Curling Club. From being the first lady guest in 2008 to the first lady member in 2009, she proceeded to be elected the first lady President at the AGM in April 2014. Not so much ground-breaking as ice-breaking! Venues Curling is known to have taken place in Markinch on \\"The Common\\", an area in the centre of the town now used as the car park for Markinch Bowling Club, Markinch Town Hall, Markinch Primary School, and the local library, prior to the Club‚Äôs founding but there is little known about this. The Club possesses a complete set of hand written minutes from the inaugural meeting to the present day. There have been three curling ponds in the Club‚Äôs history. The first, opened in the winter of 1842, was on the North edge of the town on \\"the low lying ground at the foot of Archibald‚Äôs Park\\". It was only played on for five years. It had to be closed in 1847 when the North British Railway Company‚Äôs line to Cupar was built over the site. The Club received ¬£15 in compensation. The second pond at Balfarg farm on Balbirnie estate was the most successful of the Club‚Äôs ponds, being played on during the great days of outdoor curling in the cold winters in the latter half of the 19th century. It was opened in 1850 with a match against Stratheden and curled on every winter for 64 years. This pond was the venue for club games, district medals and inter club challenge matches. A fine stone curling house was built with three rooms, the Laird‚Äôs room (the Laird being Mr. Balfour, of Balbirnie House), the west room and the curling stone room. However, in 1914, the club was again forced to move as the coming of electricity to Balfarg farm saw the mill lade drained and the source of water for the curling pond lost. A site for a new rink was found on \\"the common\\" in Markinch town itself, and it was opened on 6 January 1914, thus formalising the arrangements which had taken place before the Club's foundation. The days of outdoor curling were beginning to draw to an end, and the opening of Haymarket Ice Rink in 1912 confirmed that outdoor curling was becoming less popular. This rink eventually closed in 1938, bringing to an end 96 years of outdoor curling in Markinch. Club games are now played at Kirkcaldy Ice Rink and at Kinross Curling Rink, the ice rink which was previously the property of the Green Hotel, Kinross, but which has been refurbished, and is now run, by Kinross Curling Trust. The Kirkcaldy venue, also known as Fife Ice Arena, suffered a roof-fire in February 2007, so some of that season's games were either cancelled or re-scheduled to be played at Kinross. In the 2008-09 season, the rink at Kirkcaldy was opened for use by the Club. Competitions The Club's main internal competition is the Balbirnie League, contested between the constituent rinks, which are named after historic Markinch place-names, Balgonie, Stob Cross, Dalginch, and Sweetbank. The Club's annual fixture with Glenrothes Curling Club is for the Davie Napier Trophy An annual game for the Mounie Trophy against Meldrum & Daviot Curling Club means that the Club may also play at Forfar Ice Arena, Curl Aberdeen, or Perth Ice Rink. Swiss Tours The Club has been involved in three Swiss tours, the first in 1963, the second in 2003, and the latest from 19th. to 26th. January 2013. These \\"tours\\" have all been based in Zermatt, where the local ice rink holds an annual Scottish Curling Week.

It is the sequel to the 2005 game Battalion Wars, in which players take command of a battalion of troops to complete missions and defeat opposing forces in battle. The game amended some existing gameplay from the previous title, while introducing new elements, including multiplayer modes, naval units, and base structures. The game's single-player story focuses on a new conflict emerging following the previous war that is being used to mask the search for a powerful ancient superweapon, with players taking charge of troops across three campaigns in the present, and two set at different points in the past. The game received generally favorable reviews, though with some criticism levied on various areas including the game's controls. On 20 May 2014, the game's online multiplayer modes became unavailable for use, as a result of Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection shutting down. Gameplay Like its predecessor, the game is played from a third-person perspective, in which players take control of a variety of units that form a battalion, in order to complete missions and battles. Gameplay features a mixture of elements from both third-person shooters and real-time tactics games, with players taking control of a single unit fully, while giving orders to the rest of their battalion, whether to a single unit, a company of the same type, or the entire battalion. Battalion Wars 2 amended some elements of gameplay brought over from its predecessor - Light and Heavy recon units were replaced with the Recon unit, combining the speed of the former with the firepower of the latter; the HUD's radar now features a mini-map of the battlefield; and units can now be given orders by players through the map screen. One significant change was allowing players to take control of five of the six playable factions during the single-player mode, consisting of twenty missions plus a prologue, with each faction receiving their own campaign that is unlocked one after the other. Along with making improvements to existing gameplay, Battalion Wars 2 added in new elements for players - Naval Units, and Base Facilities. Naval units are based upon those from the Advance Wars series, with the addition of the Dreadnought that is exclusive to the Battalion Wars series, all of which the player can control and give orders to, with the exception of Naval Transports - like Air Transports, they cannot be controlled or given orders. Base Facilities consist of Headquarters, Barracks, Factories, Air Bases, and Docks, and act as respawn points for units lost in battle - HQs respawn Rifle Grunts; Barracks respawn infantry units; Factories respawn ground vehicles; Air Bases respawn aircraft; and Docks respawn Naval Units - so long as they are under the player's control. Each facility features a capture point, based on the system from the previous game, which only infantry can take, and once captured, the building is rebuilt in the architectural style of the player's faction (i.e. if controlled by the Solar Empire, the facility sports a high-tech look). One of the biggest improvements made by Battalion Wars 2 was the inclusion of multiplayer modes, a feature absent in the previous game. Multiplayer offers three online modes for two players to take part in, via Nintento's Wi-Fi Connection - Skirmish, Assault, and Co-operative. In Skirmish, players start out with a pre-deployed force, and win by earning as many points as possible from destroying enemy units within a specified time limit, with Facilities available that can be used to respawn units as long as they remain in a player's control. In Assault mode, one player commands a siege battalion and wins by destroying the opposing player's assets, with the latter winning by defending against this. In Co- operative mode, both players tackle a battalion controlled by an AI opponent, in which each player is assigned a certain role(s) (i.e. anti-air), forcing each to rely on the other to counter units they cannot deal with. Plot =Prologue= 200 years ago, the Iron Legion, ruled by the fearsome Lord Ferrok, was on the brink of total conquest of the world. Ferrok, believing victory was at hand, gathered his armies at his stronghold, the Iron Tower, to prepare for a final onslaught. However, the Solar Empire, the last nation still standing after the Lightning Wars, invades Old Xylvania in a last-ditch attempt to destroy the Legion. After a series of battles, Empress Qa-len, monarch of the Solar Empire, drops a strike battalion equipped with a powerful staff deep into Legion territory with orders to take it to the top of the Iron Tower, whereby it can be used to activate a satellite super-weapon, which would destroy the Legion. Lord Ferrok, discovering the plan, sends in bombers to find and eliminate them, yet one member of the battalion survives the assault. A lone grunt quickly finds the staff just as it is about to fall into enemy hands, and quickly proceeds towards the tower. His rifle is now supercharged by the staff, and a shield is created around himself. The Staff Bearer (as he became known) defeats many Legion troops, heavy tanks and gunships before destroying one of Ferrok's precious Battlestations. The explosion from the Battlestation destroys the protective wall around the tower, clearing the path for the Staff Bearer (who is now accompanied by three Solar grunts). After defeating the grunts guarding the tower, the four Solar warriors infiltrate the tower and activated the satellite's superweapon. After the huge blast from the satellite struck and destroyed, both the Iron Tower and the Iron Legion, Qa-Len finds the staff in the crater, and proceeds to an icy wasteland, where she throws it into a chasm, in hopes that it may never be used again, unaware this action would spark a new conflict in the future. =Solar Empire Campaign= Following the conflict with Xylvania, Western Frontier commanders enjoy a vacation on the islands of the Solar Empire, only for it to be abruptly ended. Colonel Windsor and Commander Pierce, of the Anglo Isles, launch a preemptive strike on the Solar Empire, believing rumours that they are constructing a superweapon. An invasion force, including a squadron of fighters and bombers led by Commander Pierce and a battleship fleet led by Colonel Windsor, attack the Western Frontier Naval base situated on one of the Solar Islands. At the Imperial Palace, Admiral A-Qira interrupts Empress Lei-Qo to inform her of the Anglo attacks, but the Empress already knows and says that \\"history has come full circle, just as she had foreseen\\", leaving her Admiral to deal with the attack. Aided by the Frontier, the Empire counter-attacks the Anglo forces, and after a series of losing battles, the Anglo Isles finally withdraw their troops and return to their home country. They soon realize that the Solar Empire has no superweapon, since their attack did not prompt the use of such a device, but Admiral A-Qira, saying that \\"honor demands that we launch a subsequent attack immediately\\", prepares for a counterstrike (even though Empress Lei-Qo forbids it), calling on Marshall Nova and the Tundra Territories to assist him, with Nova agreeing to do so, after visited upon by the ghost of his father, Tsar Gorgi. =Western Frontier Campaign= After returning to their nation following the conflict in the Solar Empire, General Herman takes Brigadier Betty into the Western Frontier War Room, suspecting the recent skirmishes have a familiar sense of deja vu to it, and looks for files detailing past events in the world. When he finds what he is looking for, Herman tells Betty about the Frontier's early hostilities with the Tundran Territories, back when Gorgi was still in charge of the Tundran Territories. Back then, Gorgi had his nation invade the Frontier on the belief that they were creating a super-weapon, in the same manner that occurred in the present day. This forced a younger Herman to rally the Frontier into first defending against the assault before repelling the invasion, eventually ending the conflict with the Frontier winning, and having both sides make a peace treaty. While explaining his story to Betty, Herman mentions that he and the Frontier's troops saw Xylvanian troops within their territory, but he never found out the reason why they were there or what they were up to. However, by the time he finishes his story, Herman voices concern, believing he has a suspicion on who might have orchestrated the attack between the Anglo Isles and the Solar Empire. =Anglo Isles Campaign= A few days after the conflict in his homeland, A-Qira, having reorganized his forces, leads the Solar Empire into battle, and along with aid from the Tundran Territories, launches a counter-invasion against the Anglo Isles. Colonel Windsor and Commander Pierce find themselves forced to take on the might of the two nations, and defend several key points as a result. Although initially doing well, A-Qira is eventually pushed out of the Anglo Isles, as Windsor and Pierce successfully repel the invasion. As Anglo bombers attack the Solar Empire's naval fleet, A-Qira, witnessing this, drinks from a canteen of his, upset that he is losing the war. A few seconds later, he suddenly finds himself being confronted by Kaiser Vlad, the fugitive Xylvanian leader who escaped from the Alliance of Nations in the previous war. A-Qira suddenly realizes that Kaiser Vlad has tricked both nations into starting the war against each other, but begins coughing soon after while turning pale, realizing that Vlad has poisoned his drink. A-Qira dies shortly afterwards, while Vlad contacts his troops to see how their invasion of the defenceless Tundran Territories is coming along. =Iron Legion Campaign= While Xylvanian and Tundra forces engage each other in the northern regions of the Tundra Territories, Vlad frees Ubel from his gulag by gassing the two grunts guarding him. Vlad then proceeds to tell Ubel that he has discovered the key to their vengeance upon their enemies, thanks to the Iron Legion's defeat. He explains to Ubel about the many battles which took place in Old Xylvania during the final days of the Lightning Wars, when the Solar Empire made a final attempt to annihilate the Iron Legion before they took control of the world, and reveals that his aim to ignite the conflict between the Anglo Isle and Solar Empire was to divert forces away from the region he needed to reach, having now found the staff that can activate the Empire's superweapon. =Tundran Territories Campaign= Having found the Staff of Qa-Len, Kaiser Vlad finally proclaims to destroy his enemies, alerting the other nations to the threat posed on them. Nova, learning of the invasion of his homeland, launches an assault on the Xylvian forces, aided by the other nations, as he and the other COs fight to reach the icy chasm in the northern region of the Tundran Territories, in an attempt to repel Vlad's expedition for the staff. The Alliance of Nations fights its way through Tundra and destroys Vlad's Mining Spider, a gigantic vehicle that he is using to dig up the staff. Vlad and Ubel manage to escape from the spider as it is being destroyed, just as Vlad finds the Staff of Qa-Len and uses it at the last possible second. The super-weapon causes massive destruction in the surrounding area, yet despite this, all the Alliance of Nations' CO's narrowly escape with their lives, while Vlad and Ubel are trapped in the ice, forced to dig their way out. With the nations successful, a parade in the Tundran Territories capital is held, honouring the effort put to ending the recent conflict. Reception Battalion Wars 2 received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. IGN cited an impressive story mode, addition of naval units, mostly intuitive controls, and fun online modes. Sticking points included that Kuju failed to capitalize on or misused Wii's control enhancements, the inability to play through the single-player campaign in online cooperative mode, and the lack of voice chat. Official Nintendo Magazine criticised the lack of a \\"retreat\\" command and the occasionally fiddly controls, but commended the graphics and strong online mode. Hyper's Dylan Burns commended the game for its \\"heaps of units and high production values\\". However, he criticised it for its \\"iffy motion control and being a bit too cutesy\\".

Page 39; was the second vessel to be commissioned in the 19-vessel destroyers built for the Imperial Japanese Navy in the late-1930s under the Circle Three Supplementary Naval Expansion Program (Maru San Keikaku). Background The Kager≈ç-class destroyers were outwardly almost identical to the preceding light cruiser- sized , with improvements made by Japanese naval architects to improve stability and to take advantage of Japan‚Äôs lead in torpedo technology. They were designed to accompany the Japanese main striking force and in both day and night attacks against the United States Navy as it advanced across the Pacific Ocean, according to Japanese naval strategic projections.Peattie & Evans, Kaigun . Despite being one of the most powerful classes of destroyers in the world at the time of their completion, only one survived the Pacific War.Globalsecurity.org, IJN Kagero class destroyers Shiranui, built at the Uraga Dock Company, was laid down on 30 August 1937, launched on 28 June 1938 and commissioned on 20 December 1939. Operational history At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Shiranui, was assigned to Destroyer Division 18 (Desdiv 18), and a member of Destroyer Squadron 2 (Desron 2) of the IJN 2nd Fleet, and had deployed from Etorofu in the Kurile Islands, as part of the escort for Admiral Nagumo‚Äôs Carrier Strike Force. She returned to Kure on 24 December. In January 1942, Shiranui escorted aircraft carriers and to Truk, and onwards to Rabaul to cover landings of Japanese forces at Rabaul, Kavieng and Salamaua. In February, she escorted the Japanese carriers in the Bombing of Darwin, and was then based at Staring-baai in Sulawesi, Netherlands East Indies for patrols south of Java. Shiranui departed Staring-baai on 27 March to escort the carrier force in the Indian Ocean raid on 27 March After the Japanese air strikes on Colombo and Trincomalee in Ceylon, she returned to Kure Naval Arsenal for repairs on 23 April. She deployed from Saipan on 3 June as part of the escort for the troop convoy in the Battle of Midway. Afterwards, she escorted the cruisers and from Truk back to Kure. On 28 June, she was assigned to escort the aircraft carrier to Kiska in the Aleutian Islands on a supply mission. On 5 July, while outside Kiska Harbor, she was hit amidships by a torpedo fired by the submarine , which severed her bow, killing three crewmen. Her crew managed to keep her afloat and she took two months to limp back to Maizuru under tow, where she remained under repairs until 15 November 1943. During these repairs, her \\"X\\"-turret was replaced by two additional triple Type 96 25mm AA guns. On 15 November 1943, Shiranui was assigned to the IJN 9th Fleet, and escorted convoys to Palau, Wewak and Hollandia during January and February 1944. On 1 March, she was reassigned to the IJN 5th Fleet and was assigned to northern waters, making patrols from her base at Ominato Guard District in April, and returning with the cruisers and to Kure at the start of August. During the Battle of Leyte Gulf on 24‚Äì25 October 1944, Shiranui was assigned to Vice Admiral Sh≈çji Nishimura‚Äôs diversionary force at the Battle of Surigao Strait. After the battle, she departed Coron to search for the missing cruiser and destroyer , and took on survivors from the destroyer . On 27 October she was sunk with all hands by dive-bombers from , north of Iloilo, Panay (). Shiranui was removed from the navy list on 10 December 1944.

Although initially successful, the Republicans were forced to retreat from Brunete and suffered devastating casualties from the battle. Prelude After the capture of Bilbao on June 19, the Republicans devised the attack on Brunete to divert Nationalist forces from the north and allow the fleeing Republicans time to reorganize. In addition, Brunete was also chosen because it was situated on the Extremadura road and its capture would make it harder for the Nationalists to resupply their forces besieging Madrid, perhaps even forcing them to withdraw. Once Brunete had been taken, and after some reorganization, the plan was that the offensive would then in a second phase continue in the direction of Talavera de la Reina, a move that would eventually cut off the Nationalist forces outside Madrid. At the same times as the offensive on Brunete started an enveloping attack would be launched from the Carabanchel area just south of Madrid. From a political standpoint, the offensive was chosen for Brunete to satisfy communist demands and to prove to the Russians that the Spanish possessed military initiative. In fact, Russian advisors had been pressing for an attack on Brunete since the spring of 1937. Furthermore, assistance from the Soviet Union had decreased due to the successful blockade of Republican ports by the Nationalists. Prime Minister Juan Negr√≠n needed to convince the French Premier Camille Chautemps that the Spanish Republic was still capable of military action after the disastrous losses of M√°laga and Bilbao. It was expected by the Republicans that a show of force at Brunete would persuade France to open its border for arms shipments. The offensive was well prepared, and had been preceded both by major reorganizations of the government forces and a big influx of modern war material, mainly from the Soviet Union. Nine new brigades had been set up, and the number of heavy machine guns in the units had been increased. The commanders on the battalion level and up were often well qualified for their tasks, while the company and platoon commanders often lacked experience. The offensive was meant as a surprise attack, and the Nationalists were indeed caught unaware - despite the fact that \\"it had been discussed in the caf√©s of the Republic for three months\\".Hugh Thomas: The Spanish Civil War, London 1974, p.588 The terrain where the battle was to be fought is pretty hilly, with many ridges and small creeks, but for the most part open, and thus accessible to the Republicans new Soviet tanks, which they now intended to put to their first full use. The Combatants =Republicans= General Miaja initially commanded two Spanish Republican Army corps. *Vth Army Corps commanded by Colonel Juan Modesto with some 22,000 soldiers (among them five of the International Brigades) and 100 tanks: 11th Division, led by Enrique L√≠ster. 35th Division, led by General Walter. 46th Division, led by El Campesino. *XVIIIth Army Corps commanded initially by Colonel Enrique Jurado and later by Segismundo Casado with some 20,000 men: 10th Division, led by Major Jos√© Maria Enciso. 15th Division, led by Colonel Janos \\"Gal\\" Galicz. 34th Division, led by Colonel Francisco Gal√°n. In reserve were Cipriano Mera's 14th Division, General Kl√©ber's 45th Division, and Gustavo Duran's 69th Division.Beevor, Antony. The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939. Penguin Books. London. 2006. p. 275 The reserve forces consisted of some 25,000 men and 40 tanks. =Nationalists= The site of the offensive was well chosen. Initially facing the Republican attack was not a continuous Nationalist line of defense but (as in many parts of Spain in the initial phase of the war) a series of outposts in the villages, all defended by small detachments able to take the terrain between the outposts under flanking fire. This part of the front was part of the Nationalist Army of the Center under the command of General Andr√©s Saliquet Zumeta. However, pretty soon after the battle had started the overall command was shifted to General Jos√© Enrique Varela Iglesias. The units that fought during the battle were: *The 7th Army Corps commanded by General Jos√© Varela consisted of: 71st Division, led by Colonel Ricardo Serrador Sant√©s. It was composed chiefly of Falangists and approximately 1,000 Moroccans. *The 1st Army Corps commanded during the battle by Colonel Juan Yag√ºe Blanco included: 11th Division, led by General Jos√© Iruretagoyena Solchaga. 12th Division, led by General Carlos Asensio Cabanillas. 13th Division, led by General Fernando Barr√≥n y Ortiz. 14th Division, led by Colonel Juan Yag√ºe Blanco. Transferred to the front were the 150th Division led by General S√°enz de Buruaga, the 4th Brigade of Navarre led by Colonel Juan Bautista S√°nchez and the 5th Brigade of Navarre led by Colonel Alonso Vega. Republican offensive =July 6= The first attacks started already during the night of July 5/6, with Republican forces in the cover of darkness penetrating deep into the thinly held Nationalist lines. At daybreak on July 6, the Republicans bombarded the Nationalist positions using artillery and air power, plus targets in the rear, including the local Nationalist HQ at Navalcarnero. Immediately after the bombardment, the Republican 11th Division commanded by L√≠ster advanced and encircled Brunete. The Nationalist forces there were completely taken by surprise, and it wasn't until the morning attacks started that they realised the full extent of the Republican operation. Brunete fell to the Republicans by noon. The Nationalists placed overall command of the battle in General Varela. During the morning all available manpower was rushed into the faltering front line, these included personnel from local staffs, field hospitals and supply units, and by noon the 12th, 13th and 150th Divisions along with parts of the Condor Legion were on their way to help bolster the defense. Later that day the Republican attacks by the 34th and the 46th Divisions on the flanks of L√≠ster's 11th Division stalled upon meeting fierce resistance by the Nationalists and forced L√≠ster to halt his advance south of Brunete. Attempts by the Republican forces to widen the gap by attacking towards the west was also stopped, in front of Quijorna. The assault on Quijorna was then reinforced by tanks and given the support of both artillery and air assets, but the attackers were again repulsed. Thus far the offensive had almost exclusively been carried out by the V Army Corps. The Republican command seems to have been surprised by their initial success, and there was obviously some confusion which meant that the deployment of XVIII Army Corps was delayed. (This confusion was probably compounded by the fact that many non-communists and regular army officers were reported to be sceptical towards the whole enterprise, which probably made them over-cautious.)Hugh, Tomas. The Spanish Civil War London. 1974. p.588 The planned east-wing of the enveloping attack, from Carabanchel south of Madrid, never broke the enemy line, despite heavy artillery bombardment. =July 7= The Republican Colonel Jurado diverted the 15th Division to end the stalemate at Villanueva de la Ca√±ada and the British Battalion of the XVth Brigade managed to clear the village of Nationalists by 7 am on July 7. The Nationalists in the nearby villages of Villanueva del Pardillo and Villafranca del Castillo continued to hold out. To allow Gal's 15th Division to continue towards Boadilla on the Republican left flank, the 10th Division under Enciso attacked Asensio's 12th Division defending the Mocha Ridge. The Nationalist troops there were driven back and they fell back to the hills near Boadilla. Outside Brunete the day was spent in inconclusive and incoherent fights. The bombardments in the dry landscape, that was parched by the heat, resulted in many wildfires. The Republican insistence on reducing pockets of resistance, rather than bypassing them, gave the Nationalists time to bring up fresh reserves. On the afternoon Nationalist aircraft shifted from the Northern Front started to arrive, and they immediately went into action. Varela was also told that all attacks up north had been suspended, to allow ground units to be rushed to the Brunete sector. =July 8-9= During the night of the 7/8 July general Miaja committed his reserve, the XVIII Army Corps, in an attack towards the east, in the direction of the Guadarrama River. It was performed in the morning hours. After crossing the river the 15th Division assaulted the newly fortified positions held by the 12th Division for two days. All of the attacks were repulsed and when an attack did succeed in evicting the Nationalist defenders, a counterattack quickly eliminated the gains made by the Republicans. Meanwhile, the nationalist position at the village of Quijorna on the Republican right flank continued to hold out. The attack south of Madrid was renewed, but failed once again. Nothing more came of this part of the plan. With the Republican attack on the right flank of L√≠ster remaining held up at Quijorna, Modesto ordered the 35th Division to assist El Campesino's 46th Division. The original intent of the 35th Division was for it to be used in support of L√≠ster's attack through the center. Without the 35th Division, L√≠ster's 11th Division would be unable to advance any further. On the morning of July 9, two Republican brigades attacked at Quijorna, and, after taking heavy casualties, they were able to finally clear the village of Nationalist defenders. On the Republican left flank attacks towards Boadilla del Monte initially made progress, but even though the assaulting units were well supported by tanks, armoured cars and aircraft their losses were so high that the attacks stranded. The fighting continued though, especially on and around the so-called Mosquito ridge in front of the village. In the first attack the Spanish Republican Air Force was very active, attacking both ground targets and rebel-held airfields. But the Republican planes were slow and obsolete, which would assure the German Legion Condor almost total control of the air as the battle would unfold. =July 10-11= On July 10 Villanueva del Pardillo was taken by the XIIth International Brigade of Dur√°n's 69th Division, supported by tanks. Some 500 defenders with weapons, ammunition and materiel were captured. Villafranca del Castillo was slowly being surrounded by Enciso's 10th Division and Kl√©ber's 45th Division. Colonel Jurado made plans for an assault on the village on July 11, but he became ill and was replaced with Colonel Casado. Citing poor morale and fatigue, Casado requested to cancel the attack, but General Miaja ordered for the attack to proceed as planned. (On this day the African American communist Oliver Law, acting commander of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade, was killed whilst leading an attack on the Mosquito Ridge on the Boadilla del Monte sector.) The Republicans were able to trap the Nationalist garrison in Villafranca del Castillo, forcing General Varela to send the 5th Brigade of Navarre to relieve the pressure. The arrival of the Navarrese tipped the balance in favor of the Nationalists as the Republicans were forced from their positions and fled back across the Guadarrama River. A Nationalist attempt to recapture Villanueva del Pardillo on July 11 failed. The activity in the air was very high, as more and more Nationalist air units were committed to the fight. It was not uncommon to see aircraft in groups of thirty or more appear over the battlefield, and clash with equally big squadrons of opponents. =July 12-17= As large Nationalist ground and air reinforcements had arrived to the threatened front, and as the planned pincer movement from the Carabanchel area south of Madrid had failed to make any impression, the Republican offensive was clearly grinding to a halt. Some minor diversionary attacks were still performed, but on July 15 general Miaja finally ordered an end to the offensive. (Major George Nathan, a battalion commander in the XV International Brigade, was killed by bomb fragments the day after.) At this moment, the Republicans held Brunete and had cut the Extremadura road. And the offensive had indeed relieved the Nationalist pressure on the Basque country, and it had proved to friend and foe that the Republican forces were rapidly increasing in both strength and capacity. At the same time the Nationalists had prevented their forces besieging Madrid from being cut off and with reinforcements having arrived were able to prepare to counterattack. The Republican forces had suffered big losses, not only from the actual fighting, but also due to the extreme heat, which, combined with lack of water, had incapacitated many soldiers. Many brigades had lost between 40-60% of their numbers - killed, wounded, sick and missing - and one brigade (the XIVth) is said to have lost 80% of their manpower during this week. The exhausted Republicans dug in and waited for the Nationalist counterattack that they knew probably would come. Nationalist counterattack The nationalist commander general Varela planned to retake the terrain lost to the Republicans with a three-pronged attack. The main force consisted of some 20.000 men, that would attack from the west of the salient towards Quijorna. At the same time another force of some 10.000 men would strike from the east from Boadilla del Monte towards and over the Guadarrama river. Finally some 8.000 men would also attack from the south, towards Brunete itself. =July 18= The counteroffensive started early that morning with a lengthy artillery barrage over the Republican front lines, together with heavy aerial attacks by Nationalist air units. However the Nationalists made only small gains this day: the western group managed to capture some hills northwest of Quijorna, while the eastern force took some ground east of the Guadarrama. The Republican troops defended their position stubbornly. The fighting west of Quijorna was particularly fierce. There Republican units made several countercharges, trying to recapture the hills which they had lost. The fighting in the air was also unusually heavy, as both sides threw large number of aircraft into the struggle: at one time around 80 Nationalist aircraft were involved in a massive dogfight with some 60 opponents. (On this day the British poet Julian Bell was killed by bomb fragments, whilst driving an ambulance for a volunteer British Medical Unit.) =July 19-20= The three pronged attack by the Nationalists failed to achieve any substantial gains on July 19, but the next day the eastern forces, heavily supported by aerial units, managed to make some gains on the east side of the salient, close to the Guadarrama. =July 21-23= In order to stabilize the situation on the eastern side of the pocket Miaja ordered a counterattack along the Guadarrama, which led to several days of bitter fighting in the stifling heat. The terrain initially taken by the Nationalists on July 20 switched hands several times. At the same time three Republican Brigades supported by 20 tanks made a small push from Las Rozas towards the south-east. While the see-saw battle raged on the eastern flank of the salient, the Republican forces on the west side held their ground, despite heavy attacks concentrated mainly on the terrain around Quijorna. However, on July 23 the eastern forces finally made a major breakthrough, and managed to fight their way across the Guadarrama, close to the place where the small Aulencia flows into the larger river. =July 24-25= On July 24 the Nationalists started attacking from the south towards Brunete in earnest. They had managed to concentrate some 65 artillery batteries at this part of the front, against a mere 22 Republican. With this support plus bombing from the air the Nationalist breached the Republican lines south of the city. A counterattack supported by tanks had no success. On the afternoon the attackers entered Brunete, while the remnants of L√≠ster's 11th Division retreated to positions just north of the city, clustering around the cemetery. At the same time the Nationalist east group managed to widen their breach on the Guadarrama. Miaja rushed reinforcements from Madrid, and the Republican 14th Division commanded by Cipriano Mera made yet another counterattack, but it failed, and on July 25 the defenders from the 11th Division around and on the cemetery - which included the division commander L√≠ster himself - withdrew from their positions. After this there were no more large-scale attacks in the battle - save for some ineffectual Republican attempts to counterattacks - and the fighting petered out. Varela wanted to continue his attacks but Franco ordered them to halt so that troops could be moved north for the start of the offensive against the strategically important port of Santander. (On July 25 the German war photographer Gerda Taro was fatally wounded when the car she was riding in was hit by a Republican tank more or less out of control due to a Nationalist air attack.) During the final days of the battle there were clear signs of the morale cracking on the Republican side, due to both exhaustion and the often terrible losses. Even among the volunteer International Brigades there were grumbling, insubordination and outright desertion. Aftermath At the close of the battle, the Republicans failed to cut the Extremadura road, but they still held Villanueva de la Ca√±ada, Quijorna and Villanueva del Pardillo from the Nationalists. From this point of view, both sides were able to claim victory. The losses of men and equipment in the battle were much heavier for the Republicans than the Nationalists. Indeed, the Republican army lost much of its indispensable equipment and so many of their best soldiers in the International Brigades that the battle can be seen as a strategic Nationalist victory.Beevor, Antony. The Battle for Spain. The Spanish Civil War 1936-1939. Penguin Books. London. 2006. pp.284-285 Politically, the communists suffered a loss of prestige because the offensive failed to stop the Nationalist troops from completing the conquest of the north. The frenetic conditions at Brunete for the Nationalists enabled the Germans to acquire favorable trade concessions because of the effectiveness of the Condor Legion. The Nationalists granted most favored nation status to Germany and acquiesced in sending raw materials to Germany as repayment for the debt incurred. Later the battle was commemorated in the name given to Armoured Division No. 1 \\"Brunete\\", formed in the mid-1940s. References * Hugh Thomas: \\"The Spanish Civil War\\".

His yard of birth has often been mistaken to be 1835. Effendi was from a Kurdish/Arab Sayyid family which originated from Mecca and migrated into Abbasid then Sejuk territory. Abubakr was born in the Ottoman Province of Shehrizur. He is a Sayyid, direct descendant of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad through Zayd ibn Ali, son of Imam Zayn al-Abidin. Other imams in the Cape were mostly teaching the Shafi\`i school of Islamic jurisprudence; he was a follower and the first teacher of Hanafi school, for which he also established a madrassa in Cape Town. He gained notoriety in 1869 after ruling that rock lobster and snoek, two staple foods in the Cape, were sinful (haraam). He has often been mistaken for being a Shafi'i on the basis of him being a Scholar of the 4 schools of Sunni Islam, and being able to issue religious edicts according to each one. His ancestors and children practised the Hanafi school of thought. He died after contracting malaria from reportedly travelling to Dera Mozambique, after having made several major contributions to Islam in South Africa. He introduced the fez for men, as well as reinstating the hijab for women . More importantly, besides his role as teacher he also published the Arabic Afrikaans \\"Uiteensetting van die godsdiens\\" (\\"Bayan ad-Din\\", or \\"The Exposition of the Religion\\") in 1877. Early Life and times in South Africa Abu Bakr was born in Ottoman province Shehrizur. His father Molla Omar Al-Baghdadi an Ottoman Governor, was killed by local tribesmen uprising against the authority. He studied at the Madrassa originally set up by his ancestor Abu Nasr Al-Amiyr Sulaymaan Al-Qurashiy Al-Amjadiy (c. 1060 - c.1134) for any who wish to learn. Not much is known of Abu Nasr Al-Amiyr Sulaymaan from Abubakrs personal documents. He is however a contemporary of Suleyman Ghazi, the founder of the Ottoman Empire and Suleyman Sultan of Rum who lived at similar times. Further studies and teachings of Abubakr were in Erzurum, Istanbul and Makkah. According to the Travelogue of Omar Lutfi Effendi, while he and Abu Bakr travelled by sea. At a later age Omar Lutfi returned to Turkey where his descendants still reside. His Travelogue was translated into English from Ottoman Turkish by Turkish/American Islamic Scholar Yusuf Kavakci. Many of Abu Bakr Effendi's descendants originate from his marriage to Tohora Saban Cook whom he married after renouncing the \\"perfectly white\\" first wife, Rukea Maker. He had 5 sons, Ahmad Ataullah, Hisham Nimatullah, Omar Jalaluddin, Muhammad Alauddin, and Hussain Fowzy. Fahimah his daughter was Abu Bakr's eldest child from his marriage to Rukea. The family continues to reside in South Africa, with some returning to Turkey and some migrating to Australia. Some of Abubakr's sons continued in his footsteps of serving far and wide, with one son, Ahmed, being involved in Cape politics. He became a member of the Cemetery Committee because the cemetery where his father's grave was situated was threatened with closure by the Cape Administration. He stood for the legislature of the Cape but failed to get the required votes for a seat due to a change in the system for cumulative votes, amended especially to keep him out of the lCape legislature. Some also served in the Ottoman Army and fought in the Hejaz against the Anglo and Arab nationalist uprising against the Ottoman Empire. In [Singapore is the grave of Abu Bakrs son, Ahmed, who was the Ottoman Turkish Ambassador to Singapore. Struggle of acceptance by the Cape Malay populace Abu Bakr's life in South Africa was not easy. It is clear that the Cape Malay Muslims had suffered and lost some of their religious identity as a result of their deportation by the Dutch from their home countries in Southern India and Maritime Southeast Asia. Historical documents talk of his influence of introducing the Islamic hijab and fez on the Cape Muslims , although many other Islamic scholars had come to South Africa. He also attempted to break the Cape Muslim 'Clerical Order' which existed. Only those related to the previous imam were allowed to become the next in line, holding knowledge to themselves and wielding power over the common people. This is further related in the 1866 Disputes; Over the years the Cape Muslim \`clerical' order developed with the imams wielding appreciable power. The status of the imams, together with economic security and in many cases prosperity was due to the generous monetary donations and gifts by the congregation. Between 1866 and 1900, over twenty cases pertaining to masjid in the Cape peninsula were heard in the Supreme Court with regard to the positions of imams and their succession. Practically every masjid at the Cape in the 19th century faced this problem. This would have thrown him into further dispute with the Cape Malay population. It is also related in the Travelogue of Omar Lutfi, that the Malay people although they had held onto their Islamic heritage where not able to correctly pronounce the Arabic words and text, and it had been \\"corrupted\\" (as Abu Bakr would have seen it) with some Malay words. Their practices also involved non Islamic traditional and tribal Malay practices which originated from their ancestral homes on the Indonesian and Malay islands. These practices still exist in Indonesia where some of the population generally practice Islam but also practice spirit worship. One of the main reasons for Abu Bakr's unpopularity was his declaration that crayfish, a staple item of the diet of the Muslims of the Cape, was \\"khabahith\\" or \\"evil food\\". The matter was taken to court by the \\"kreef (crayfish) party\\" in 1863. Magistrate Hill found in favour of the \\"kreef party\\" and against Abu Bakr. After this and his evidence in the 1869 imam succession trial, a petition was drawn up by some Muslims to have him removed from the Cape. He left his residence in Cape Town and moved 12 km away to Newlands to a spacious house, \\"Stony Place\\". Abu Bakr also seemingly followed and practiced according to the Hanafi school of thought. He swore in the Supreme Court in 1869, when he was the prime witness in the abovementioned affair relating to the succession of the imam of the Buitengracht St mosque, that he had always been a Shafi'i. But because he used hanafi texts, many doubted his word. He also taught and wrote the book the 'Bayan-al-din' which is written on Abu Bakrs own rulings since he was a fiqh scholar, but has many similarities to the Multaqa. Abu Bakr's statements made in court meant it was difficult to associate him with one school or the other. His title was 'Mufti of the 4 Schools' so one could argue he was of the Hanafi, Shafi'i, Malaki or Hanbali School. Analysis of the religious and linguistic impact of Abubakr Effendi From 1862 to 1869 Effendi had studied the local language use and then proceeded to compile the book \\"Bayan-al-Din\\". Printed by the Turkish Ministry of Education in Istanbul, it is an interesting and significant part of South Africa's history, and serves as a valuable reference of the Afrikaans usage during that era in the Islamic neighbourhoods of Cape Town. It gives an invaluable insight into the use of Afrikaans in the so-called \\"Slams\\" (slang for Islamic) neighbourhoods of Cape Town in that period. It is also significant, since this community did not have Dutch as mother tongue and were therefore mostly unaffected by its orthography. As such this was the first substantial book ever written and published in Afrikaans, although written in a modified Arabic script where the diacritic signs are used to indicate the pronunciation of Afrikaans. It bears testimony to the slave origins of the language which was not accredited by the White Afrikaners, especially during the Apartheid Era. The book, totalling 254 pages, appears to follow the Hanafite law-school. It was divided into 8 parts, each dealing with a specific part of Islamic law: # ritual cleansing (pp. 2‚Äì66) # ritual prayer (pp. 66‚Äì219) # religious tax (pp. 219‚Äì258) # fasting (pp. 258‚Äì284) # slaughtering of livestock (pp. 284‚Äì302) # religious prohibitions (pp. 302‚Äì344) # drink (pp. 344‚Äì349) # hunting (pp. 349‚Äì354) Adrianus van Selms, a Dutch scholar and Semitic researcher, published a transliteration in Latin Script of Abu Bakr Effendi's work in 1979. Since the original work presented spoken Afrikaans without using vowels, van Selms's biggest task was to decipher which Afrikaans words were being referred to. Effendi had also innovated new Arabic characters for several Afrikaans letters not found in the Arabic alphabet, the letter 'P' for example. What is interesting is that these innovated letters had to be unique, yet still recognisable by the population who were already schooled in traditional Arabic. Since this was a local modification to the language, used only amongst the Cape Muslim Community, it may have proved illegible for those familiar with traditional Arabic.

Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Aari work involves a hook, plied from the top but fed by silk thread from below with the material spread out on a frame. This movement creates loops, and repeats of these lead to a line of chain stitches.Sajnani, Manohar (2001) Encyclopaedia of Tourism Resources in India, Volume 2 The fabric is stretched on a frame and stitching is done with a long needle ending with a hook such as a crewel, tambour (a needle similar to a very fine crochet hook but with a sharp point)Wood, Dorothy (2008) The Beader's Bible or Luneville work. The other hand feeds the thread from the underside, and the hook brings it up, making a chainstitch, but it is much quicker than chainstitch done in the usual way: looks like machine-made and can also be embellished with sequins and beads - which are kept on the right side, and the needle goes inside their holes before plunging below, thus securing them to the fabric.there are many types of materials used like zari threads, embellishments,siquins etc.. Aari embroidery is practiced in various regions such as in KashmirMehta, Vinod (2006) Delhi and NCR city guide and Kutch (Gujarat).HALI., Issues 117-119 2001 Banjara embroidery Banjara Lambani woman in traditional dress Practiced by the LambadaMs. Jaslean Dhamija (2013) Asian Embroidery gypsy tribes of Andhra Pradesh, Banjara embroidery is a mix of applique with mirrors and beadwork. Bright red, yellow, black and white coloured cloth is laid in bands and joined with a white criss-cross stitch. The Banjaras of Madhya Pradesh who are found in the districts of Malwa and Nimar have their own style of embroidery where designs are created according to the weave of the cloth, and the textured effect is achieved by varying colours and stitches of the geometric patterns and designs. Motifs are generally highlighted by cross-stitch. Banni or Heer Bharat (Gujarat) The Banni or Heer Bharat embroidery originates in Gujarat, and is practiced mainly by the Lohana community. It is done with silk floss (Heer means \\"silk floss\\") and it is famous for its vibrancy and richness in color pallets & design patterns, which include shisha (mirror) work. Bagh and phulkari embroidery of the Punjab region has influenced Heer Bharat embroidery in its use of geometrical motifs and stitchery.Naik, Shailaja D. (1996) Traditional Embroideries of India  Chamba Rumal (Himachal Pradesh) Chamba Rumal with Scenes of Sita and Hanuman This embroidery flourished in the princely hill states of Kangra,Mohinder Singh Randhawa. (1960) Punjab: Itihas, Kala, Sahit, te Sabiachar aad.Bhasha Vibhag, Punjab, Patiala. Chamba, Basholi, and other neighbouring provinces. Chamba region has highly skilled craftsmen. Chikan or Chikankari (Uttar Pradesh) Chikan embroidery on a saree pallu The present form of chikan (meaning elegant patterns on fabric) work is associated with the city of Lucknow, in Uttar Pradesh. Chikan embroidery on silk is Lucknow's own innovation. The other chikan styles are that of Calcutta and Dacca. However, characteristic forms of stitch were developed in Lucknow: phanda and murri.Trivedi, Madhu (2010) The Making of the Awadh Culture Chikan embroidery is believed to have been introduced by Nur Jahan,Bhushan, Jamila Brij (1990) Indian Embroidery the wife of Jahangir. Chikan embroidery involves the use of white thread on white muslin (tanzeb), fine cotton (mulmul), or voile, fine almost sheer fabrics which showcases shadow work embroidery the best. Other colours can also be used. The artisans usually create individual motifs or butis of animals and flowers (rose, lotus, jasmine, creepers). The designs are first printed onto the fabric not with chaulk, but with a mixture of glue and indigo. At least 40 different stitches are documented, of which about 30 are still practiced today and include flat, raised and embossed stitches, and the open trellis-like jaali work. Some of the stitches that are used in Chikankari work include: taipchi, pechni, pashni, bakhia (ulta bakhia and sidhi bakhia), gitti, jangira, murri, phanda, jaalis etc. In English: chain stitch, buttonhole stitch, French knots and running stitch, shadow work. Another is the khatao (also called khatava or katava). Gota (Jaipur, Rajasthan) Kota sari with gota patti It is a form of appliqu√© in gold thread, used for women‚Äôs formal attire. Small pieces of zari ribbon are applied onto the fabric with the edges sewn down to create elaborate patterns. Lengths of wider golden ribbons are stitched on the edges of the fabric to create an effect of gold zari work. Khandela in Shekhawati is famous for its manufacture. The Muslim community uses Kinari or edging, a fringed border decoration. Gota-kinari practiced mainly in Jaipur, utilising fine shapes of bird, animals, human figures which are cut and sewn on to the material.it is very famous in rajasthan as well as in many other parts of the world.Shailaja D. Naik (1996) Traditional Embroideries of India Kantha (Bengal) Modern Naksi kantha Naksha is embroidery on many layers of cloth (like quilting), with running stitch. It is also known as dorukha which mean the designs/motifs are equally visible in both sides: there is no right or wrong side so both side are usable. Traditionally, worn out clothes and saris were piled together and stitched into quilts. Rural Bengali women still do this with cotton saris, the embroidery thread being taken from the sari border. It started as a method of making quilts, but the same type of embroidery can also be found on saris, salwar suits, stoles, napkins, etc. Themes include human beings, animals, flowers, geometric designs and mythological figures.Indian Heritage Karchobi - Rajasthan It is a raised zari metallic thread embroidery created by sewing flat stitches on cotton padding.Knopf, 1996 Rajasthan This technique is commonly used for bridal and formal costumes as well as for velvet coverings, tent hangings, curtains and the coverings of animal carts and temple chariots. Kasuti or Kasuthi (Karnataka) Kasuti (Kai=hand and Suti = cotton) comes from the state of Karnataka,Karine Schomer, W. H. McLeod (1987) The Sants: Studies in a Devotional Tradition of India but also used elsewhere, as in Kanchipuram sarees. Kasuti is done with single thread and involves counting of each thread on the cloth. The patterns are stitched without knots, so that both sides of the cloth look alike. Stitches like Gavanti, Murgi, Negi and Menthi form intricate patterns like gopura, chariot, palanquin, lamps and conch shells, as well as peacocks and elephants, in fixed designs and patterns. Kathi (Gujarat) Kathi embroidery was introduced by 'Kathi' the cattle breeders, who were wanderers.Shailaja D. Naik (1996) Traditional Embroideries of India This technique combines chain stitch, appliqu√© work and mirror-like insertions. Kutch or Aribharat  The best known of the Kutch (Gujarat) embroidery techniques is Aribharat, named after the hooked needle which forms the chainstitch. It is also known as Mochibharat, as it used to be done by mochis (cobblers). Kutchi bharat/Sindhi stitch (Gujarat) A variation of Kutch work, this geometric embroidery starts with a foundation framework of herringbone stitch or Cretan stitch, and then this framework is completely filled with interlacing. It is said that this technique originated in far away land of Armenia and found its way to Gujarat by travelling Nomads. Sindhi stitch or Maltese cross stitch is also similar but the innovation of the Kutchi women have taken it beyond the traditional designs... Kutch workIndian Heritage Kashmiri embroidery Kashmiri phiran Kashmiri embroidery =Kashmiri Kashida= Kashmiri embroidery (also Kashida) is used for phirans (woollen kurtas) and namdahs (woollen rugs) as well as stoles. It draws inspiration from nature. Birds, blossoms and flowers, creepers, chinar leaves, ghobi, mangoes, lotus, and trees are the most common themes. The entire pattern is made with one or two embroidery stitches, and mainly chain stitch on a base of silk, wool and cotton: the colour is usually white, off- white or cream but nowadays one can find stoles and salwar-kameez sets in many other colours such as brown, deep blue, sky blue, maroon and rani pink. Kashida is primarily done on canvas with crystal threads, but Kashida also employs pashmina and leather threads. Apart from clothes, it's found on home furnishings like bed spreads, sofa and floor cushions, and pillow covers. The base cloth, whether wool or cotton, is generally white or cream or a similar shade. Pastel colors are also often used. The craftsmen use shades that blend with the background. Thread colors are inspired by local flowers. Only one or two stitches are employed on one fabric. Kashmiri embroidery is known for the skilled execution of a single stitch, which is often called the Kashmiri stitch and which may comprise the chain stitch, the satin stitch, the slanted darn stitch, the stem stitch, and the herringbone stitch. Sometimes, the doori (knot) stitches are used but not more than one or two at a time. =Kashmiri stitches= Man's Coat (Chogha) Kashmir 19th century Boy's Frock Kashmir 19th century The stitches include sozni (satin), zalakdozi (chain) and vata chikan (button hole).Shailaja D. Naik (1996) Traditional Embroideries of India Other styles include dorukha in which the motif appears on both sides of the shawl with each side having a different color; papier-m√¢ch√©; aari (hook) embroidery; shaaldaar; chinar-kaam; samovar (the antique Kashimiri tea-pot) is a very typical and popular design used in Kashmiri embroidery. The samovar pattern is then filled up with intricate flowers and leaves and twigs; Kashir-jaal which implies fine network of embroidery, particularly on the neckline and sleeves of a dress material. Further styles include naala jaal which involves embroidery particularly on the neckline and chest/yoke: naala means neck in the Koshur dialect of Kashmiri language; jaama is a very dense embroidery covering the whole base fabric with a thick spread of vine/creepers and flowers, badaam and heart shapes, a variation of this form is neem-jaama, where neem means demi or half, because the embroidery is less dense, allowing a view of the fabric underneath; and jaal consisting of bel-buti: a fine and sparse net of vine/creepers and flowers. Variation of this form is neem-jaal, where again the work is less dense. Mukesh Work- (similar to chikankari) -Lucknow Small rectangular pieces of metal are squeezed shut around some threads of the fabric. Mukesh work (known also as badla or fardi), includes women making shiny stitches amid chikan embroidery using a needle and long, thin strips of metal.Clare M. Wilkinson-Weber (1999) Embroidering Lives: Women's Work and Skill in the Lucknow Embroidery Industry Phool patti Ka Kaam (Uttar Pradesh) Flower embroidery of Uttar Pradesh,Textile Trends, Volume 44 2001 especially in Aligarh. Punjabi embroidery =Phulkari (Punjab and Haryana)= Patiala Phulkari Phulkari (Phul=flower, Kari=work) is the most famous rural embroidery tradition of Punjab, mentioned in the Punjabi folklore of Heer Ranjha by Waris Shah. Its present form and popularity goes back to 15th century, during Maharaja Ranjit Singh‚Äôs reign Phulkari also means headscarf, and it comes from the 19th century tradition of carrying an odhani or a head-scarf with flower patterns. Its distinctive property is that the base is a dull hand-spun or khadi cloth, with bright coloured threads that cover it completely, leaving no gaps. It uses a darn stitch done from the wrong side of the fabric using darning needles, one thread at a time, leaving a long stitch below to form the basic pattern. Famous for Phulkari are the cities of Sukaadas (1992) Fabric Art: Heritage of India Amritsar, Jalandhar, Ambala, Ludhiana, Nabha, Jind, Faridkot, and Kapurthala. Other cities include Gurgaon (Haryana), Karnal, Hissar, Rohtak and Delhi. Bagh is an offshoot of phulkari and almost always follows a geometric pattern, with green as its basic colour. =Other styles= Saraiki kurti The embroidery styles of the Punjab region include kalabatun embroideryRamananda Chatterjee (1939) The Modern Review, Volume 66, Issues 1-6 using thin wires. Kalabatan surkh involves using gold wires on orange coloured and red silk. Kalabatan safed involves using silver wires on white material. There are two kinds of gold embroidery, one of a solid and rich kind called kar-chob and the other called tila-kar or kar-chikan utilising gold thread. The former is used for carpets and saddle cloths whereas the latter is used for dresses. The Punjab region also uses mukesh embroidery: mukesh bati-hui, twisted tinsel, mukesh gokru, flattened gold wire for embroidery of a heavy kind, and waved mukesh, made by crimping mukesh batihui with iron tongs.Baden-Powell, Baden Henry (1872).

Nowadays different home d√©cor items can be found, such as lamp shades, garden umbrellas and bed covers and utility products like Hand bags, Wallets, Files. Rabari (Rajasthan and Gujarat) This embroidery style is made by the RabariMs. Jaslean Dhamija (2013) Asian Embroidery or Rewari community of Rajasthan and Gujarat. This very colourful embroidery style, using stark contrast was traditionally used only for garments, but now it can be found on bags, accessories, home furnishings, etc. Mirrors of all shapes and sizes are incorporated in the embroidery, as a result of the belief that mirrors protect from evil spirits. Designs include not only flowers and fruit and animals such as parrots and elephants, but also temples, women carrying pots, and the ubiquitus mango shape.

Originally, pieces of mica were used as the mirrors, but later, people started using thin blown- glass pieces, hence the name, which in Hindi means \\"little glass\\". Until recently they were all irregular, made by hand, and used mercury, nowadays one can also find them machine made and regularly shaped. It's usually found in combination with other types of stitches like cross stitch, buttonhole stitch and satin stitch, nowadays not only by hand but also by machine. Mirrorwork is very popular for cushion covers and bedcovers, purses and decorative hangings as well as in decorative borders in women's salwar-kameez and sari. Thousands of women from kutch (Gujarat) and sikar, churu (Rajasthan) are engaged in doing hand embroidery work like tie, mirror work, beads on fabric. There are various types of Chikan work: Taipchi, Bakhia, Phunda, Murri, Jaali, Hathkati, Pechni, Ghas Patti, and Chaana Patti. Toda embroidery Embroidery work Kotha Primitive Tribal Community, (PTGs) in Nilgiri, Tamil Nadu. Also known as Cross Stitches Embroidery The Toda embroidery has its origins in Tamil Nadu. The Nilgiri Hills, inhabited by the Todu community have their own style called pugur, means flower. This embroidery, like Kantha, is practiced by women. The embroidery adorns the shawls. The shawl, called poothkuli, has red and black bands between which the embroidery is done. As Todas worship the buffaloes, buffalo becomes an important motif in the Toda embroidery among mettvi kaanpugur, Izhadvinpuguti and others. Stylized sun, moon, stars and the eye of the peacock feathers are used in Toda embroidery.Ms. Dhamija, Jaslean (2013) Asian Embroidery Zardozi or Zari or kalabattu Close Shot of the Zardozi (Zardouzi) Embroidery Cushion Covers Sari from India (probably Benares), late 19th or early 20th century, silk with metallic thread (Zari) The most opulent form of Indian embroidery is the Zari and the Zardozi or Zardosi, known since the late 16th century, brought in India by the Moghuls. The word Zardozi comes from the two Persian words Zar & gold and Dozi & embroidery. This form uses metallic thread. Once real gold and silver thread was used, on silk, brocade and velvet fabric. Metal ingots were melted and pressed through perforated steel sheets to convert into wires, which then were hammered to the required thinness. Plain wire is called 'badla', and when wound round a thread, it is called 'kasav'. Smaller spangles are called 'sitara' and tiny dots made of badla are called 'mukais' or 'mukesh'. Zardozi is either a synonym or a more elaborate version of zari where the gold or silver embroidery is embellished with pearls and precious stones, gota and kinari, making this art only affordable by rich people. Nowadays Zardosi thread has a plastic core and a golden-coloured outside. The thread consists of coiled metal wires placed on the right side of the fabric and couched with a thinner thread.

All students enrolled at the Academy live in military-style dormitories located on-campus throughout the school year. The barracks are normally named in tribute to famous military figures in pre- Confederation Canadian history, such as Major-General Isaac Brock (leader of British forces at the Battle of Queenston Heights during the War of 1812), Major John Butler (leader of the irregular militia regiment named after him, Butler's Rangers, formed for service in the American Revolutionary War), and Joseph Brant (1743‚Äì1807) who was a Mohawk military and political leader who was closely associated with Great Britain during and after the American Revolution. Namesake The school itself is named after Robert Land, a United Empire Loyalist originally from New York who migrated into what later became Upper Canada with his family in the mid-1780s, in the wake of the American Revolutionary War. Land is often seen as one of the first inhabitants of modern-day Hamilton, Ontario. Purpose According to the Academy's website, the military theme allows for the reinforcement of the importance of organization, teamwork, discipline and personal responsibility. Students admitted to the Academy are chosen for their potential for success. Students admitted to the Academy mostly do not fit in public school system because of Academic, Behaviour, attitude and other problems. Other students have been diagnosed with various learning disorders, including Autism, Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD) and various forms of learning disability. The Academy asserts that each year 100% of its graduating class who apply to university or college are accepted.Robert Land Academy: About us It also states that 95% of all students experience a dramatic improvement in their academic performance and success within their first semester of enrollment. Motto  The Academy's motto is Deus et Patria (Latin for \\"God and Country\\"). Affiliations with the Canadian Armed Forces The Academy sponsors a closed cadet corps of the Royal Canadian Army Cadets, #2968 Robert Land Academy Royal Canadian Army Cadet Corps, which is also affiliated with The Lincoln and Welland Regiment (the Niagara Region's local Canadian Forces army reserve infantry unit) and The Royal Canadian Regiment (one of the Canadian Forces' three Regular Force infantry regiments). Membership in #2968 RCACC was mandatory for grade 9 students of the 08/09 year. Rank structure within the academy =Student ranks= All students, on first being accepted at the Academy, hold the rank of Recruit. The first phase of non-academic training at the Academy for new students, normally lasting a month's period, is always referred to as the \\"Recruit Period\\" and they will dress in a tan beret to signify their recruit status, Upon passing Recruit Period, by showing a standard of organizational skills with good behaviour, the student is promoted to Cadet and given the right to wear the blue beret with the academy's cap badge. A student who makes serious mistakes may be placed on charge, meaning he stays the rank of recruit for period of time and whatever rank this student was is suspended. The student has to wear an orange beret or tan beret until being reinstated back to the rank cadet or higher. After being promoted to the rank of Cadet, students at the Academy, on proving their ability to demonstrate rudimentary leadership and organizational skills, may be promoted to the rank of Barman, which is normally marked by a silver bar similar to the insignia of a United States Army lieutenant. On reaching Barman rank and getting a position within the academy, the student may then advance in either one of two ways: * If the student demonstrates equivalent leadership skills, he can then be promoted to the rank of Double Barman (marked with two silver bars similar to the insignia of a U.S. Army captain). Students in grade 5 to 10 must obtain the rank of Leading barman followed by Master Barman before they may be promoted higher. * If the student shows exceptional leadership skills, he can then be promoted to the rank of Lance Corporal (the equivalent of the same rank in the British Army). From there, promotions can proceed through the ranks of Corporal, Master Corporal, Sergeant and finally Warrant Officer (paralleling the rank structure of the modern Canadian Forces). The senior ranking student on campus during a school year is acknowledged as '\\"Head Boy\\"', and normally wears the rank of Sergeant or Warrant Officer. The other two senior student positions are '\\"Parade Sergeant Major\\"' and '\\"Aide-de-Camp\\"', both of which may wear either the rank of Sergeant or Warrant Officer, together they are referred to as \\"Top 3\\" at the academy. =Staff ranks= Staff members at the Academy are organized into three general categories: * Academy officers * Academy staff non-commissioned officers(NCOs) * Academy civilian staff Academy officers normally wear the officer rank insignia which existed in the Canadian Army prior to 1968 (\\"pips\\" and crowns). Teachers wear either a second lieutenant's one \\"pip\\" or a lieutenant's two \\"pip\\" stars, company commanders wear a captain's three \\"pip\\" stars and the Headmaster wears a lieutenant colonel's crown and one \\"pip\\". Academy staff non-commissioned officers are normally composed of the Academy Sergeant-Major (ASM) and his immediate subordinates, the Company Sergeants- Major (CSM). The ASM and the CSMs handle all daily drill and other military- theme classes at the Academy. Academy civilian staff (including the staff running the Academy kitchen, the groundskeepers and the administrative staff) do not wear military-style uniforms and do not hold an Academy rank.

She was a judge on the BBC One (originally BBC Two) television programme The Great British Bake Off from its launch in 2010 until 2016, when it relocated to Channel 4. Early life Berry was born on 24 March 1935, the second of three children, to Margaret (‚ÄòMarjorie‚Äô, n√©e Wilson; 1905‚Äì2011) and Alleyne William Steward Berry (1904‚Äì1989). Alleyne was a surveyor and planner who served as Mayor of Bath in 1952 and was closely involved in establishing the University of Bath at Claverton Down. Mary's great-great-grandfather on her father's side, Robert Houghton, was a master baker in the 1860s who provided bread for a local workhouse in Norwich.\\"Mary Berry: A long line of determined business people that had tremendous energy and drive...\\", The Genealogist, 11 September 2014.

At the age of 13, Berry contracted polio and had to spend three months in hospital. This resulted in her having a twisted spine, a weaker left hand and thinner left arm. She has said that the period of forced separation from her family while in hospital \\"toughened [her] up\\" and taught her to make the most of every opportunity she would have.The TelegraphMarie Claire Berry attended Bath High School, where she described her academic abilities as \\"hopeless\\" until she attended domestic science classes with a teacher called Miss Date, who was particularly encouraging of her cooking abilities. Her first creation in the class was a treacle sponge pudding which she took home, and her father told her that it was as good as her mother's. She then studied catering and institutional management at Bath College of Domestic Science. Career Berry's first job was at the Bath Electricity Board showroom and then conducting home visits to show new customers how to use their electric ovens. She would typically demonstrate the ovens by making a Victoria sponge, a technique she would later repeat when in television studios to test out an oven she had not used before. Her catchment area for demonstrations was limited to the greater Bath area, which she drove around in a Ford Popular supplied as a company car. Her ambition was to move out of the family home to London, which her parents would not allow until she was 21. At the age of 22, she applied to work at the Dutch Dairy Bureau, while taking City & Guilds courses in the evenings. She then persuaded her manager to pay for her to undertake the professional qualification from the French Le Cordon Bleu school.The Telegraph She left the Dutch Dairy Bureau to become a recipe tester for PR firm Benson's, where she began to write her first book. She has since cooked for a range of food-related bodies, including the Egg Council and the Flour Advisory Board. In 1966 she became food editor of Housewife magazine.

However, defeat ended hopes of attacking France through its vulnerable southern border, forcing the Allies into a war of attrition on their strongly held northern frontier. It also effectively confirmed Bourbon victory in Spain, following their success at Almansa in April, and ended major operations in Italy. Background The War of the Spanish Succession was triggered by the death in November 1700 of the childless Charles II of Spain. He named his heir as Philip of Anjou, grandson of Louis XIV of France, and on 16 November 1700, he became king of the Spanish Empire. In addition to mainland Spain, this included the Spanish Netherlands, large parts of Italy, and much of Central and South America. In 1701, disputes over territorial and commercial rights led to war between France, Spain, and the Grand Alliance, whose candidate was Charles, younger son of Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor. Savoyard state, circa 1700; note Nice and Savoy, today part of France The war in Northern Italy centred on the Spanish-held Duchies of Milan and Mantua, which were considered essential for the security of Austria's southern borders. In March 1701, French troops occupied both cities; Victor Amadeus of Savoy allied with France and his daughter Maria Luisa married Philip V. In October 1703, Victor Amadeus renounced his alliance with France, and switched sides. During 1704, French Marshall La Feuillade captured Savoyard territories north of the Alps in Villefranche and the County of Savoy. This was accompanied by an offensive conducted by the duc de Vend√¥me in Piedmont, and by the end of 1705, Victor Amadeus controlled only his capital of Turin. The situation changed in July 1706 when Vend√¥me and any available forces were sent to reinforce France's northern frontier after their defeat at Ramillies. Reinforced by German auxiliaries, Prince Eugene broke the Siege of Turin in September; despite a minor French victory at Castiglione, the war in Italy was over. To the fury of his allies, in the March 1707 Convention of Milan Emperor Joseph gave French troops in Lombardy free passage to Southern France. However, this freed Imperial and Savoyard forces for use elsewhere. Sir Richard Hill, English ambassador to Savoy from 1703 to 1706, had been trying to persuade Victor Amadeus to attack the French naval base at Toulon. Its capture would confirm Allied naval supremacy in the Western Mediterranean, support the Protestant Camisard revolt in Southern France, divert Bourbon forces from Spain, and win back Villefranche and Savoy. Siege By April 1707, the Allies had assembled an army of 35,000 but the campaign was delayed when Emperor Joseph detached 10,000 troops in June to capture Naples, allowing France to strengthen its defences around Toulon. The consolidation of Habsburg power in Italy and continuing presence of French garrisons in north-west Piedmont made Victor Amadeus cautious about committing to external operations, especially since many of the commitments made by Austria in the 1703 Treaty of Turin remained unfulfilled. Supported by a Royal Navy squadron under Admiral Cloudesley Shovell, Prince Eugene and Victor Amadeus crossed the Alps via the Col de Tende on 6 July. They reoccupied Nice, then marched along the coast from Antibes to Cuers reaching La Valette du Var by late July. However, progress was slow, and victory at Almansa in April allowed the French to send reinforcements from Spain; by the time the Allies arrived at Toulon on 27 July, Ren√© de Froulay de Tess√© had over 20,000 men based just outside. Toulon harbour contained forty-six ships of the line, ranging in size from 50 to 110 guns; concerned they might be burnt, Louis XIV ordered them sunk, to be re- floated later, while their guns were removed and mounted in the land defences. Although the Allies had insufficient forces or heavy artillery to mount a formal siege, they captured the heights of Santa Catarina above the port on 6 August, followed by the outworks of Fort Sainte-Marguerite on 10 August. Four days later, Tess√© retook the heights, inflicting heavy casualties on the Allies, including the Duke of Saxe-Gotha who was killed. The Camisard rising failed to take place, while many of the troops evacuated from Lombardy had been assembled at Riez under the Comte de M√©davy, threatening the Allied rear. Although a naval attack captured Fort St Louis on 18 August, thousands of Allied troops were incapacitated by disease, and Prince Eugene and Victor Amadeus agreed to withdraw on 22nd. After loading the siege artillery and as many sick as possible on his ships, Shovell's squadron bombarded the harbour for eighteen hours. He sank two French warships, severely damaged many of those partly sunk, and destroyed the dockyards and naval stores essential for repairing them. Aftermath None of the French ships would be available until after the war ended; Louis XIV decided to reallocate money spent on the fleet on strengthening his land forces in Spain. Toulon therefore confirmed British naval control of the Western Mediterranean, while the diversion of resources prevented the Bourbons taking full advantage of their victory at Almansa. However, failure cost 13,000 casualties, mostly from disease, and Marlborough considered it a serious strategic defeat. It ended hopes of attacking France through its vulnerable southern border, and forced the Allies into a war of attrition on their strongly held northern frontier. Prince Eugene and Victor Amadeus recrossed the Alps in early September and expelled the remaining French garrisons in Northwest Piedmont, but Villefranche and the County of Savoy remained in French hands until 1714. Immediately after the siege, the British squadron returned to England; on 22 October 1707, navigational errors caused the loss of four ships and 2,000 men, including Shovell. This led to the 1714 Longitude Act, which offered cash prizes for devising a method of accurately calculating longitude.

History Originally known as WALE, the call sign moved to 990 AM in Providence, Rhode Island on July 20, 1989. On that date, SNE Broadcasting Ltd. (owned by local businessmen Robert and James Karam) took ownership of 1400 AM and introduced the WHTB call sign. The station's first location was at the corner of North Main Street and Central Street in Fall River, Massachusetts, known as the Durfee Theatre Building. The station's \\"Whale\\" was a plaster and chicken wire figure atop the building with the words \\"WALE 1400\\" on the sides in white paint. The transmitting antenna was on the roof and had a copper screen ground system. There was no real ground connection to the antenna, and the screen created an artificial grounding system, limiting the coverage area. WALE began broadcasting May 6, 1948, on 1400 kHz with 250 watts power (full-time). It was owned by Narragansett Broadcasting Company. In 2018, WHTB signed on FM Translator W229DC on 93.7 from the AM tower.http://www.fccinfo.com/CMDProFacLookup.php?sCurrentService=FM&sFacilityID;=200240&tabSearchType;=Faci Personalities Personalities included Mike \\"Surfer\\" Sands (Arthur Lang) and long-time engineer Stephen J.

Steve Sorel ended his career as the Chief Engineer of WHTB and sister station WSAR. The North Main Street/Central Street site was also the location of WCFR-FM and WCFR-TV, although it is not known if WCFR-TV ever produced a signal as after World War II the Channel 1 assignment (44-50Mc.) was dropped from television and given to the Business Radio Service. WALE moved to Rock Street in the early 1970s and the transmitter was relocated to the area along Interstate 195 West and Route 24 South at the end of Augustus St. and remains there today.

It is an approximately 2 miles from Llangorse and 2 miles from Bwlch. It has a Norman castle and great views of Llangorse Lake. St Michael's church at Cathedine occupies a rectangular churchyard on a hill slope at the southern end of the hamlet. The church was first recorded at about the beginning of the 12th century, but was almost entirely rebuilt in the second half of the 19thC. Some stonework from the earlier structure may survive specifically the west wall and the jambs of the south door which could be relics from its predecessor. History Following the conquest of Brycheiniog by Bernard de Neufmarch√© in the late 11th century, and its conversion into his Lordship of Brecknock, the whole of Cathedine was initially assigned by him to his prisoner Gwrgan ap Bleddyn, son of the last king of Brycheiniog (Bleddyn ap Maenarch) but was later repossessed by Bernard. From the late 12th century formed part of the medieval Marcher lordship of Blaenllynfi (of which Talgarth was the main town), which eventually came into the possession of Gwrgan's descendant, Rhys ap Hywel (ancestor of Sir Dafydd Gam).Brecknock in S.Lewis, A Topographical Dictionary of Wales, London, 1849 online versionJohn Burke, A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Commoners of Great Britain and Ireland, 1833-37, Volume 3, entry for Price, of Castle Madog Following Rhys' involvement in the coup against Edward II, Edward III terminated the Lordship of Blaenllynfi, returning the land to Bernard's descendant, the then Marcher Lord of Brecknock. Following the Laws in Wales Act of 1536, the Lordship of Brecknock became part of the new county of Brecknockshire, with Cathedine forming part of the hundred of Talgarth, and later formed part of the 19th-century tithe parish of Cathedine. The hamlet was reputably a favourite country hunting base for the 19th century industrialist, Crawshay Bailey. Landscape Clwyd-Powys Archaeological Trust Predominantly regular fieldscapes with hedged boundaries to the south and east of Llangorse Lake, on sloping hill-land of Allt yr Esgair and the western flanks of Mynydd Llangors, lying between a height of between about 150‚Äì390 metres above sea level. The distinctive field patterns in the area appears to represent systematic clearance and enclosure or the enclosure of former common grazing in the later medieval or early post- medieval period. Modern land use predominantly pasture, with some conifer plantation on Allt yr Esgair. Modern settlement includes a number of widely dispersed farms including Trebinshwn farm and house and Lower Cathedine, both of which are perhaps late medieval or early post-medieval in origin.

The ship was commissioned into the IJN on 28 April 1941. Nowaki was initially assigned to Destroyer Division 4 of the Destroyer Squadron 4. At the beginning of World War II, she was engaged as an escort during the invasion of the Philippine Islands and during subsequent operations around Malaya. On 1‚Äì4 March, while in company with the cruisers , , , and destroyer , she was involved in sinking a number of Allied vessels during operations in the Java Sea. On 1 March, Nowaki assisted Arashi in sinking the Dutch motorship Toranja and the British minesweeper Scott Harley, and later that day captured the Dutch steamship Bintoehan. On 2 March, Nowaki assisted in sinking the destroyer . On 3 March 1942, Nowaki helped sink the gunboat . On 4 March, Nowaki assisted in sinking the Australian sloop and the British Motor Minesweeper 51, tanker Francol, and depot ship Anking. During the Battle of Midway, Nowaki took survivors off the damaged aircraft carrier and then helped scuttle her with torpedoes. Later that year Nowaki and the remaining destroyers of Destroyer Division 4 were reassigned to Destroyer Squadron 10 based in Truk. For the remainder of 1942 and most of 1943, Nowaki operated in and around the Solomon Islands. Nowaki fled Truk on 17 February 1944 in the midst of the massive American air and surface attack known as Operation Hailstone and escaped pursuit by US Task Force 50.9 with minor splinter damage despite being straddled several times by 16 inch salvos from and at extreme range. Returning to the Central Pacific after repairs in Japan, Nowaki took part in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. In the Battle off Samar on 25 October 1944, Nowaki took part in the torpedo attack on the U.S. escort carriers and assisted in sinking the destroyer . Later, she removed survivors from the cruiser and scuttled her with torpedoes, although recent studies suggests that she only managed to arrive in time to rescue the survivors, as Chikuma herself had sunk beforehand. After being crippled by gunfire from U.S. cruisers on 26 October, she was finished off by torpedoes from , east- southeast of Legaspi (). There were no survivors.

She was the only U.S. Navy ship named for the surfbird. Surfbird was laid down on 15 February 1944 by the American Ship Building Company, Lorain, Ohio; launched on 31 August 1944, sponsored by Mrs. F. W. Chambers; and commissioned on 25 November 1944 with Lt. R. H. Nelson, Jr., USNR, in command. Service history =World War II, 1944-1946= Surfbird departed Lorain on 26 November en route to Boston, Massachusetts via Montreal, Quebec and Halifax. She arrived at Boston on 15 December 1944 and held minesweeping trials. On 13 February 1945 the ship arrived at Little Creek, Virginia to begin her shakedown training. After a brief period in the Charleston Naval Shipyard for alterations, she sailed for the west coast. The Panama Canal was transited on 27 April, and Surfbird arrived at San Diego, California on 6 May. Two days later, she and sailed for Hawaii. Surfbird arrived at Pearl Harbor and on 26 May departed there for Okinawa Retto, via Eniwetok, Guam and Ulithi. She arrived at Kerama Retto on 25 June and began daily sweeps of the \\"Skagway\\" area of the East China Sea. The minesweeper departed Okinawa on 5 September for North Saddle Island, at the entrance of the Yangtze River. She swept Bonham Strait and its approaches until 4 October and then swept the entrance to Chefoo Harbor, Shantung. Next was a two-day sweep of the approaches to Jinsen, Korea after which she got underway for Shanghai. The Yangtze River was entered on 16 October and, by the end of the month, she had swept 32 mines. Surfbird sailed from Shanghai on 17 November for Sasebo Japan to be repaired. From 14‚Äì31 December 1945 she swept mines in Tachibana Wan, Ky≈´sh≈´. She moved to Kure from Sasebo and remained there from 20‚Äì26 February 1946 when she sailed for the United States, via the Marianas, Marshall Islands, Johnston Island, and Pearl Harbor. The minesweeper arrived at San Diego on 14 April, and was decommissioned on 5 June 1946. =Korean War, 1952-1953= Surfbird was recommissioned at San Diego on 12 March 1952 and operated from there until December. On 1 December she stood out to sea en route to the Far East. The minesweeper touched at Yokosuka, Japan on 28 December 1952 and departed on 1 January 1953 with units of Mine Division (MinDiv) 76 to begin sweep and blockade operations between Wonsan and Hungnam, Korea. These patrols were only broken by brief intervals of replenishment and upkeep at Sasebo. On 25 May Surfbird arrived at Inchon to make magnetic-acoustic sweeps of Yong Do and Cho Do. She returned to Sasebo on 6 June and sailed for the United States three days later. =7th Fleet, 1953-1956= Surfbird arrived at Long Beach, California on 3 July. Following an overhaul at Mare Island from 17 August to 28 October, she resumed local operations out of Long Beach. The ship departed the Far East again on 28 April 1954 and returned on 24 November 1954. In February 1955, her designation was changed from AM-383 to MSF-383. She trained along the California coast for the next year and on 1 March 1956 sailed for another tour with the 7th Fleet. When Surfbird was due for rotation on 9 August, she and began a 13,000-mile cruise home through the South Pacific. They called at Manila in the Philippine Islands; Bali, Republic of Indonesia; Darwin, Australia; Port Moresby, New Guinea; and Pago Pago, Samoa. They then called at Pearl Harbor before returning to Long Beach on 9 October 1956. =Degaussing ship, 1957-1965= USS Surfbird reconfigured as a degaussing ship and redesignated as ADG-383. On 22 January 1957 Surfbird sailed for Yokosuka (her new home port) to begin a new career. She arrived in Japan on 12 February and began receiving degaussing equipment from the . On 15 June she was redesignated from MSF-383 to a degaussing ship, ADG-383. Until April 1965, Surfbird operated from Sasebo, but her operations covered much of the western Pacific as she also degaussed ships of the allied sea services of Japan, Korea, the Republic of China, the Philippines, and South Vietnam. =Vietnam War, 1965-1970= Surfbird stood out of Subic Bay on 11 April 1965 en route to Vietnam. Upon her arrival there, she was assigned patrol duty on \\"Operation Market Time\\" until returning to Sasebo on 7 May. Surfbird again performed \\"Market Time\\" patrols and special ranging service off the coast of South Vietnam from 2 to 22 August 1966, and from 17 September to 7 October 1966. She returned to Vietnam for operations during the following periods: 8 to 15 September and 10 to 14 November 1967; 17 June to 20 July 1968; 8 to 28 March; 16 August to 10 September; 2 to 26 October 1969; 4 January to 7 February; and 21 July to 3 August 1970. Surfbird received three Battle Stars for service in World War II, two for Korean War service, and eight for service during the Vietnam War. =Decommissioning and subsequent career= On 5 August 1970 Surfbird was notified that she was to be inactivated. She departed Japan on 7 September and, after making port calls at Guam and Hawaii, arrived at the Inactivation Facility, Bremerton, Washington on 3 October. Surfbird was decommissioned on 18 December 1970 and attached to the Pacific Reserve Fleet, where she remained into February, 1975. Surfbird was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 21 February 1975; sold 5 December 1975 to the Pacific Northwest Salvage Company, Inc. of Seattle, Washington; sold again in December, 1975 to Brice Industries of Fairbanks, Alaska and renamed Helenka B. Helenka B was subsequently transferred to the Maritime Administration in 1976 for disposal and sold to Wel-Aska of Valdez, Alaska.

At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Kager≈ç, was assigned to Destroyer Division 18 (Desdiv 18), and a member of Destroyer Squadron 2 (Desron 2) of the IJN 2nd Fleet, and had deployed from Etorofu in the Kurile Islands, as part of the escort for Admiral Nagumo‚Äôs Carrier Strike Force. She returned to Kure on 24 December. In January 1942, Kager≈ç escorted aircraft carriers and to Truk, and onwards to Rabaul to cover landings of Japanese forces at Rabaul and Kavieng. She returned with Sh≈çkaku from Palau to Yokosuka on 3 February, and spent the following month in training patrols. On 17 March, she departed Yokosuka with Sh≈çkaku and Zuikaku to Staring-baai in Sulawesi, Netherlands East Indies. Kager≈ç departed Staring- baai on 27 March to escort the carrier force in the Indian Ocean raid on 27 March. After the Japanese air strikes on Colombo and Trincomalee in Ceylon, she returned to Kure for repairs on 23 April. She deployed from Saipan on 3 June as part of the escort for the troop convoy in the Battle of Midway. Afterwards, she escorted the cruisers and from Truk back to Kure. On 5 July, she was assigned to escort the transport Kikukawa Maru to Kiska in the Aleutian Islands on a supply mission, and on 8 August assisted in towing the damaged destroyer back to Japan. On 20 July, she was reassigned to Desdiv 15, Desron 2, still within the IJN 2nd Fleet. In mid-August, Kager≈ç escorted the cruiser to Truk, and continued on from Truk on a high speed transport run to Guadalcanal. For the remainder of 1942 and into February 1943, she was assigned to patrols from Guadalcanal towards Shortland, and to numerous ‚ÄúTokyo Express\\" high speed transport operations in the Solomon Islands. During this period, she fought at the Battle of the Eastern Solomons, Battle of Santa Cruz, Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, and Battle of Tassafaronga In mid-February 1943, Kager≈ç returned with the aircraft carrier via Truk to Kure for repairs. In mid-March Kager≈ç, Juny≈ç and returned to Truk, and Kager≈ç continued on to Shortlands, arriving on 24 April. After making a troop transport run from Rabaul to Kolombangara on 7 May Kager≈ç was disabled by a naval mine while leaving Vila port. Barely able to maneuver, she was then attacked by Allied aircraft and sank southwest of Rendova (). On Kager≈ç , 18 crewmen were killed and 36 were wounded. Kager≈ç was removed from the navy list on 20 June 1943.

Supervision may be applied as well to practitioners in somatic disciplines for their preparatory work for patients as well as collateral with patients. Supervision is a replacement instead of formal retrospective inspection, delivering evidence about the skills of the supervised practitioners. It consists of the practitioner meeting regularly with another professional, not necessarily more senior, but normally with training in the skills of supervision, to discuss casework and other professional issues in a structured way. This is often known as clinical or counselling supervision (consultation differs in being optional advice from someone without a supervisor's formal authority). The purpose is to assist the practitioner to learn from his or her experience and progress in expertise, as well as to ensure good service to the client or patient. Learning shall be applied to planning work as well as to diagnostic work and therapeutic work. Milne (2007) defined clinical supervision as: \\"The formal provision, by approved supervisors, of a relationship-based education and training that is work-focused and which manages, supports, develops and evaluates the work of colleague/s. The main methods that supervisors use are corrective feedback on the supervisee‚Äôs performance, teaching, and collaborative goal-setting. It therefore differs from related activities, such as mentoring and coaching, by incorporating an evaluative component. Supervision‚Äôs objectives are ‚Äúnormative‚Äù (e.g. quality control), ‚Äúrestorative‚Äù (e.g. encourage emotional processing) and ‚Äúformative‚Äù (e.g. maintaining and facilitating supervisees‚Äô competence, capability and general effectiveness). Some practitioners (e.g. art, music and drama therapists, chaplains, psychologists, and mental health occupational therapists) have used this practice for many years. In other disciplines the practice may be a new concept. For NHS nurses, the use of clinical supervision is expected as part of good practice. In a randomly controlled trial in Australia,White E, Winstanley J, Does clinical supervision lead to better patient outcomes in mental health nursing? Nursing Times; 106: 16, pp. 16‚Äì18, 2010. White and Winstanley looked at the relationships between supervision, quality of nursing care and patient outcomes, and found that supervision had sustainable beneficial effects for supervisors and supervisees. Waskett believes that maintaining the practice of clinical supervision always requires managerial and systemic backing, and has examined the practicalities of introducing and embedding clinical supervision into large organisations such as NHS Trusts (2009, 2010).Waskett, C. Clinical Supervision using the 4S model 1: considering the structure and setting it up' Nursing Times 106: 16, pp. 12‚Äì14, 2010.Waskett C', Clinical Supervision using the 4S model 2: training supervisors to deliver effective sessions' Nursing Times 106: 17, pp. 19‚Äì21, 2010.Waskett, C. 'Clinical supervision using the 4S model 3: Keeping it going. Nursing Times 106: 18, 2010.  United Kingdom  Clinical supervision is used in many disciplines in the British National Health Service. Registered allied health professionals such as occupational therapists, physiotherapists, dieticians, speech and language therapists and art, music and drama therapists are now expected to have regular clinical supervision. C. Waskett (2006) has written on the application of solution focused supervision skills to either counselling or clinical supervision work. Practising members of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy are bound to have supervision for at least 1.5 hours a month. Students and trainees must have it at a rate of one hour for every eight hours of client contact. The concept is also well used in psychology, social work, the probation service and at other workplaces. Models or approaches There are many different ways of developing supervision skills which can be helpful to the clinician or practitioner in their work. Specific models or approaches to both counselling supervision and clinical supervision come from different historical strands of thinking and beliefs about relationships between people. A few examples are given below. Peter Hawkins (1985Hawkins, P. (1985). Humanistic psychotherapy supervision: a conceptual framework. Self and Society: Journal of Humanistic Psychology, 13(2), 69‚Äì79.) developed an integrative process model which is used internationally in a variety of helping professions. His \\"Seven Eyed model of Supervision\\" was further developed by Peter Hawkins along with Robin Shohet, Judy Ryde and Joan Wilmot in \\"Supervision in the Helping Professions\\" (1989, 2000 and 2006 and 2012Hawkins, P., and Shohet, R. (2012). Supervision in the Helping Professions. (Fourth edition) Maidenhead: Open University Press/ McGraw Hill.) and with Nick Smith in \\"Coaching, Mentoring and organisational Consultancy: Supervision and Development\\" (2006 and 2013Hawkins, P. and Smith N. (2006, second edition 2013) ‚ÄúCoaching, Mentoring and Organizational Consultancy: Supervision and Development.‚Äù Maidenhead: Open University Press/McGraw Hill.) and is taught on the courses of the Centre for Supervision and Team Development as well as many other supervision training courses. S. Page and V. Wosket describe a cyclical structure. F. Inskipp and B. Proctor (1993, 1995) developed an approach based on the normative, formative and restorative elements of the relationship between supervisor and supervisee. The Brief Therapy practice teaches a solution focused approach based on the work of Steve de Shazer and Insoo Kim Berg which uses the concepts of respectful curiosity, the preferred future, recognition of strengths and resources, and the use of scaling to assist the practitioner to progress (described in ). Waskett has described teaching solution-focused supervision skills to a variety of professionalsHenderson, P. (Ed.), Supervisor Training: issues and approaches; Waskett; Learning to supervise using a solution focused approach. Karnac, 2009. Evidence-based CBT supervision is a distinctive and recent model that is based on cognitive- behaviour therapy (CBT), enhanced by relevant theories (e.g. experiential learning theory), expert consensus statements, and on applied research findings (Milne & Reiser, 2017). It is therefore an example of evidence-based practice, applied to supervision. CBT supervision meets the general definition of clinical supervision above (Milne, 2007), adding some distinctive features that reflect CBT as a therapy. This includes a high degree of session structure and direction (e.g. detailed agenda-setting), but within a fundamentally collaborative relationship. Also, there is a primary emphasis on cognitive case conceptualization, mainly through the use of case discussion, intended to develop diagrammatic CBT formulations. But discussion should properly be combined with other CBT techniques, including Socratic questioning, guided discovery, educational role-play, behavioural rehearsal, and corrective feedback. Another distinctive aspect is a focus on evidence- based principles and methods, including the use of reliable instruments for feedback and evaluation, in relation to both therapy and supervision. Perhaps the single most defining characteristic of evidence-based CBT supervision is the active and routine commitment to research methods and findings: where other approaches refer to theory and clinical/supervisory experience for guidance, evidence-based CBT supervision appeals ultimately to ‚Äòthe data‚Äô. Examples of the use of relevant theories, expert consensus statements and research, together with six formally-developed supervision guidelines (illustrated through video clips), can be found in Milne & Reiser (2017). Counselling or clinical supervisors will be experienced in their discipline and normally then have further training in any of the above-mentioned approaches, or others.

Smith (born February 28, 1949) is a former American football player, coach, scout, and executive. He served as a part-time scout for several NFL and USFL teams before joining the Buffalo Bills in 1986, serving as a scout and executive for them for 14 years. With the Bills, the team won four AFC Championships. He joined the San Diego Chargers in 2001 as a director of pro personnel, and was promoted to general manager and executive vice president for them two years later. He stayed with the Chargers until being fired following the 2012 season. Smith's son, Kyle, is also a scout and executive. Education and early career Smith is a graduate of Bishop Hendricken High School in Warwick, Rhode Island, where he was a standout on the football and track teams. Smith then attended Kentucky Wesleyan College, where he graduated with a degree in health and physical education in 1971. In 2005, Smith returned in order to attend a dedication in his honor, during which he received a plaque of commemoration. Following graduation, Smith served as an assistant coach at Cranston High School West from 1971‚Äì1976, before serving as the head coach of the Rhode Island Kings of the Eastern Football League (EFL) in 1976 and as an assistant coach at the University of Rhode Island in 1978. In addition to coaching, Smith also played semi-professionally for the Attleboro Kings of the EFL as a wide receiver from 1972 to 1974. He was given a tryout with the Washington Redskins in 1974, but was not offered a contract. Smith was inducted into the American Football Association's Minor/Semi-Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1990.http://www.americanfootballassn.com/forms/2010HallofFameListing.pdf Between 1971 and 1985, Smith taught physical education in the Providence, Rhode Island school system. NFL career =San Diego Chargers= Smith was first hired by the Chargers in 1986 as director of pro scouting. He spent 14 seasons (1987-00) with the Buffalo Bills, working his way from area scout to director of pro personnel during the team‚Äôs most successful period, which included four straight Super Bowl appearances. After the 2000 season, he joined former Bills executive John Butler in San Diego. Smith was later promoted to general manager after Butler, then Chargers GM, died of cancer in 2003. He inherited a team that was 14‚Äì34 in its previous three seasons, and had not made the playoffs since 1995. Smith directed the Chargers to five AFC West division titles and eight consecutive seasons without a losing record. San Diego's 7‚Äì9 record in 2012 was their first losing season since Smith's first season in 2003. Missing the playoffs for the third straight season, the Chargers fired Smith and head coach Norv Turner the day after the 2012 season ended. Over his tenure, Smith allowed Darren Sproles, Michael Turner and Vincent Jackson to leave the Chargers without finding adequate replacements. The Chargers' offensive line grew weak in 2012. Quarterback Philip Rivers was frequently forced to scramble and was sacked 49 times, contributing to his 22 turnovers‚Äî47 over the previous two seasons. Due to public perceptions that he brought an arrogant approach to contract dealings and that his strategies involved high-risk/high-reward, Smith was both widely praised and criticized by fans and media.New York Times In April 2004, a week prior to the NFL Draft (in which the Chargers held the #1 overall pick), University of Mississippi quarterback Eli Manning declared he would not play for the Chargers if they drafted him. Smith ignored Manning's threats and selected him #1 without straying from his objective. Less than an hour later, Smith completed a trade with the New York Giants which sent Manning to New York in exchange for North Carolina State University quarterback Philip Rivers (drafted 4th overall), as well as a 3rd-round pick in 2004 (used to select kicker Nate Kaeding), a 1st round pick in 2005, and a 5th round pick in 2005. In 2005, the Chargers used the first round pick acquired from the Giants to select Shawne Merriman 12th overall. Merriman went on to win the AP's NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year Award. Manning went on to become the MVP of Super Bowl XLII and Super Bowl XLVI. =Washington Redskins= On March 6, 2013, Smith joined the Washington Redskins as a consultant and senior executive. Smith and Redskins general manager Bruce Allen were longtime friends. He announced his retirement on February 28, 2015, after failing to come to an agreement with the team on a contract extension. Personal life Smith married Susan Smith in 1977, and has resided in Del Mar, California since 2000. The couple have two children together, having a son, Kyle (born 1984), and a daughter, Andrea. Kyle is the vice president of player personnel for the Washington Redskins of the NFL, while Andrea is the director of premium services for the Anschutz Entertainment Group.

He was born in Newark (Niagara-on-the-Lake) around 1791, the son of a United Empire Loyalist. He served in the local militia during the War of 1812. He was assistant to King's Printer John Cameron and took over this function from the time when Cameron became ill in April 1815 until February 1816, several months after Cameron's death. After that, he ran an inn at Niagara. In 1824, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada for the town of Niagara as a Reformer. He supported government funding for the Welland Canal and defended those who supported Robert Gourlay. For a time, with Bartemas Ferguson, he published the Niagara Herald, a newspaper owned by John Crooks. As a freemason, he was accused of being associated with the kidnapping and presumed murder of Captain William Morgan, who is said to have revealed secrets of the order. Although McBride denied these accusations, this contributed to his defeat in the 1828 election. He died in Niagara in 1834.

He is best known for his discovery, along with Masakazu Konishi, of a brain map of sound location in two dimensions in the barn owl, tyto alba. His work has contributed to the understanding of information processing in the auditory system of the barn owl, the plasticity of the auditory space map in developing and adult barn owls, the influence of auditory and visual experience on the space map, and more recently, mechanisms of attention and learning. He is a recipient of the Lashley Award, the Gruber Prize in Neuroscience,2005 Gruber Neuroscience Prize and the Newcomb Cleveland prize AAAS Newcomb Cleveland Prize, 1978 and is a member of the National Academy of Sciences. Biography Knudsen attended UC, Santa Barbara, earning a B.A. in Zoology followed by an M.A. in Neuroscience. He earned a Ph. D. at UC, San Diego in 1976, working under Theodore H. Bullock. Knudsen was a post-doctoral fellow with Konishi at California Institute of Technology from 1976 to 1979. He has been a professor at the Stanford University School of Medicine since 1988 and was chair of the Department of Neuroscience in the School of Medicine from 2001 to 2005. Auditory sound map of the Barn Owl In 1978, Knudsen and Konishi presented the discovery of an auditory map of space in the midbrain of the barn owl. This discovery was groundbreaking because it unearthed the first non- somatotopic space map in the brain. The map was found in the owl‚Äôs midbrain, in the lateral and anterior mesencephalicus lateralis dorsalis (MLD), a structure now referred to as the inferior colliculus. Unlike most sound- localization maps, this map was found to be two-dimensional, with units arranged spatially to represent both the vertical and horizontal location of sound. Knudsen and Konishi discovered that units in this structure respond preferentially to sounds originating in a particular region in space.Knudsen, E. I. and Konishi, M. ‚ÄúA neural map of auditory space in the owl.‚Äù Science 200: 795-797, 1978. In the 1978 paper, elevation and azimuth (location in the horizontal plane) were shown to be the two coordinates of the map. Using a speaker set on a rotatable hemispherical track, Knudsen and Konishi presented owls with auditory stimulus from various locations in space and recorded the resulting neuronal activity. They found that neurons in this part of the MLD were organized according to the location of their receptive field, with azimuth varying along the horizontal plane of the space map and elevation varying vertically. Knudsen followed this discovery with research into specific sound localization mechanisms. Two main auditory cues used by the barn owl to localize sound are interaural time difference (ITD) and interaural intensity difference (IID). The owl‚Äôs ears are asymmetric, with the right ear‚Äôs opening being directed higher than that of the left. This asymmetry allows the barn owl to determine the elevation of a sound by comparing sound levels between its two ears. Interaural time differences provide the owl with information regarding a sound‚Äôs azimuth; sound will reach the ear closer to the sound source before reaching the farther ear, and this time difference can be detected and interpreted as an azimuthal direction.*Carew, T.J. (2000). Behavioral Neurobiology. Sunderland, MA: Sinauer. At low frequencies, the wavelength of a sound is wider than the owl's facial ruff, and the ruff does not affect detection of azimuth. At high frequencies, the ruff plays a role in reflecting sound for heightened sensitivity to vertical elevation. Therefore, with wide-band noise, containing both high and low frequencies, the owl could use interaural spectrum difference to obtain information about both azimuth and elevation. In 1979, Knudsen and Konishi showed that the barn owl uses interaural spectrum information in sound localization. They presented owls with both wide-bandwidth noise and pure tones. The birds were able to successfully locate pure tones (since they could still gather information from IID and ITD), but their error rate was much lower when localizing wide- bandwidth noise. This indicates that the birds utilize interaural spectrum differences to improve their accuracy.Knudsen, E. I, and Konishi, M. ‚ÄúMechanisms of sound localization in the barn owl (Tyto alba).‚Äù Journal of Comparative Physiology 133: 13-21, 1979. Together with John Olsen and Steven Esterly, Knudsen studied the pattern of response to IID and ITD in the space map. They presented owls with sound stimuli while recordings were made from the optic tectum. Consistent with the previous findings regarding the organization of the optic tectum in terms of elevation and azimuth, they found that ITD varied primarily along the horizontal axis and IID along the vertical axis. However, the map according to elevation and azimuth does not line up perfectly with the ITD/IID map. Azimuth and ITD do not have a strictly linear relationship. In addition, IID is used not only to determine elevation of the sound source, but also, to a lesser degree, azimuth. Finally, IID and ITD are not the only two cues the owl uses to determine sound location, as shown by Knudsen‚Äôs research into the effect of bandwidth on sound localization accuracy. Information from multiple types of cues is used to create the map of elevation and azimuth in the optic tectum.Olsen, J.F., Knudsen, E.I. and Esterly, S.D. ‚ÄúNeural maps of interaural time and intensity differences in the optic tectum of the barn owl.‚Äù Journal of Neuroscience 9: 2591-2605, 1989. Sound map plasticity At Stanford, Knudsen studied the plasticity of the auditory sound map, discovering that associations between the auditory cue values of the map and the locations in space that they represent can be altered by both auditory and visual experience. Knudsen altered owls‚Äô auditory cues by plugging one ear or removing the ruff feathers and preaural flaps. Initially this caused the birds to inaccurately judge sound source location, since the cues normally associated with each location in space had been changed. However, over time, the map shifted to restore a normal auditory sound map, aligned with the visual space map, despite the abnormal cues. New associations were formed between the abnormal cue values and the spatial locations they now represented, adjusting the map to translate the cues the bird was receiving into an accurate representation of its environment. This adjustment happens most rapidly and extensively in young birds. However, the map never perfectly reflects abnormal experience, even when cues are altered so early that the bird never experiences normal cues. This indicates that there is some innate ‚Äúprogramming‚Äù of the map to reflect typical sensory experience.Mogdans, J. and Knudsen, E.I. ‚ÄúEarly monaural occlusion alters the neural map of interaural level difference in the inferior colliculus of the barn owl.‚Äù Brain Research 619: 29-38, 1993. In 1994, Knudsen disproved the idea that the auditory sound map is not long plastic in the adult bird; the plasticity appears to have a critical period. Earlier work had indicated that alteration of the sound map by experience was restricted to a period during development, and once this window of plasticity had passed, subsequent changes would not occur. In work done with Steven Esterly and John Olsen, he showed that adult animals retain plasticity, although to a lesser degree than younger animals. The adult auditory sound map is more readily altered if the bird was exposed to abnormal stimuli earlier in life, during a sensitive period. This shows that the owl‚Äôs brain forms functional connections during early abnormal experience which can be reactivated upon the return of abnormal stimuli.Knudsen, E.I., Esterly, S.D. and Olsen, J.F. ‚ÄúAdaptive plasticity of the auditory space map in the optic tectum of adult and baby barn owls in response to external ear modification.‚Äù Journal of Neurophysiology 71: 79-94, 1994. Sound map vision guides development Knudsen's work has shown that vision is the dominant sense in changing the auditory sound map. Binocular displacing prisms were used to shift owls‚Äô visual world, which resulted in a corresponding shift in the sound map. The disparity between the owls‚Äô visual and auditory experience was reconciled by reinterpretation of auditory cues to match visual experience, even though the visual information was incorrect and the auditory was not. Even when other sensory information indicates to the owl that its visual input is misleading, this input exerts an apparently innate dominance over the other senses. In owls raised with displacing prisms, this persistent reliance on inaccurate information is particularly apparent: ‚ÄúEven though interaction with the environment from the beginning of life has proven to owls that their visual perception of stimulus source location is inaccurate, they nevertheless use vision to calibrate sound localization, which in this case leads to a gross error in sound localization‚Äù.Knudsen, E.I. and Knudsen, P.F. ‚ÄúSensitive and critical periods for visual calibration of sound localization by barn owls‚Äù (222). Journal of Neuroscience 63: 131-149, 1990. This dominance does have limitations, however; in 1985, Eric Knudsen and Phyllis Knudsen conducted a study which showed that vision can alter the magnitude but not the sign of an auditory error.Knudsen, E.I. and Knudsen, P.F. ‚ÄúVision guides the adjustment of auditory localization in young barn owls.‚Äù Science 230: 545-548, 1985. While monaural occlusion and visual displacement both alter the associations between sensory cues and corresponding spatial locations, there are significant differences in the mechanisms at work: ‚ÄúThe task under [the conditions of monaural occlusion] is to use vision[‚Ä¶]to assign abnormal combinations of cue values to appropriate locations in space. In contrast, prisms cause a relatively coherent displacement of visual space while leaving auditory cues essentially unchanged. The task under these conditions is to assign normal ranges and combinations of cue values to abnormal locations in space‚Äù.Knudsen, E.I. and Knudsen, P.F. ‚ÄúSensitive and critical periods for visual calibration of sound localization by barn owls‚Äù (230).

It is situated in the city-centre, and is towards the northern end of the Cross-City Line northeast of Birmingham New Street. The station, and all trains serving it, are operated by West Midlands Railway. The other station serving Lichfield is , on the city outskirts. History =Early years= Lichfield City Station in 1849 The station opened in 1849, on the South Staffordshire Railway's line from Lichfield Trent Valley to Walsall and Dudley. This later became part of the London and North Western Railway. The architect for the South Staffordshire Railway was Mr Edward Adams of London and the station building built in 1849 was a modest creation in a Tudor style, with tall gables and chimneys. Services to Birmingham began in 1884, when a branch to Sutton Coldfield opened, connecting with an earlier LNWR line. This original station was demolished in 1882 when the present one was built to accommodate these additional services. The original station stood further east than the present one. It was approached from the city by a path which ran across Levett's Field and up some brick steps in front of the station, these can still be seen near the present Fire Station. =Recent history= The station platform Passenger trains northwards via Trent Valley station to ceased in January 1965, along with trains to Walsall so Lichfield City became the northern terminus of the line from Birmingham. This later became part of the Cross-City Line. In 1988 under British Rail, the line was extended back to Trent Valley. Lichfield City has retained considerable character.Rail Around Birmingham and the West Midlands: Lichfield City station The line to Walsall subsequently closed to all traffic in March 1984, except for the portion as far as Anglesey sidings (near Hammerwich), which was retained to serve a Charringtons oil terminal. Traffic from there ceased in 2002 and the line has been disused since then (though the track remains intact). In June 1990 the station was in the news after a trainee soldier, William Robert Davies, aged 19, was shot and killed, and two other new recruits were wounded, whilst they were awaiting a train to Birmingham. They had been shot by two IRA gunmen.D. McKittrick et al, Lost Lives - the stories of the men, women and children who died as a result of the Northern Ireland troubles. Mainstream Publishing 2007. A plaque commemorating the incident is situated in the station. The South Staffordshire Line The South Staffordshire Line from Lichfield Trent Valley to Burton on Trent is often used for diversions (when the route via is closed for engineering work), as well as for occasional freight trains and empty stock transfers. In a strategy which has been conducted by the West Midlands Combined Authority. The line from Walsall to Lichfield has been identified as a disused rail corridor and this means that it is a long term ambition to reopen the line from Walsall to Lichfield. As either a rail/light rail corridor, which considers the line to be reopened for either rail or tram trains. There is also aspirations to reconnect the disused line at Wednesbury to Walsall as either rail or tram. Consideration is also being given to the reintroduction of trains to Burton and Derby. Services north of Lichfield City currently terminate at Lichfield Trent Valley, with the line beyond only used by freight, access to the Barton train maintenance depot, occasional cross country services and as a diversionary route. A short term option may be a diesel shuttle service with longer term ambitions to electrify the line and provide stations at Barton Under Needwood and Alrewas. Facilities The station has a staffed ticket office, located at street level on Station Road. This is open throughout the week from early morning until mid-evening. A self-service ticket machine is also provided in the ticket hall for use when the ticket office is closed or for collecting pre-paid tickets. At platform level, there are toilets and a waiting room. Customer help points, CIS displays and automated announcements provide train running information. Step-free access is available to both the ticket hall and platforms (the latter via lift from the subway).Lichfield City station facilities National Rail Enquiries Bridge Immediately adjacent to the station is a bridge which carries the rail lines over the busy A51. The bridge is frequently struck by heavy goods traffic on the road below, forcing rail traffic to and from Shenstone to reduce speed over the bridge as a safety precaution.

History  Gregg Wallace =2002‚Äì2003= After a pilot hosted by Ainsley Harriott on 14 April 2001, the show was launched on 26 January 2002 and was originally broadcast as a BBC production for the Open University under an educational remit. It was hosted by Gregg Wallace, then a relatively unknown presenter. He was joined by a celebrity chef each week in a pre- recorded format and with a low budget, using archived content from the likes of Keith Floyd and Rick Stein to fill the show. After the first series, the second series was broadcast live. =2003‚Äì2006= After the success of the first two series, the programme was relaunched with established celebrity chef Antony Worrall Thompson as the host, initially guest hosting from May before taking over on 13 September. The format was tweaked, moving away from the educational remit and simple meals to more aspirational food with an increase in chefs, a number of whom had Michelin stars, and celebrity guests. The BBC archive was retained for the revamped format, with Worrall Thompson and the guest chefs preparing dishes, with the clips used to allow clean-up and \\"resetting\\" of the studio kitchen. During the summer of 2004, the programme temporarily moved to BBC One and aired as Saturday Brunch, live from Worrall Thompson's home. Subsequently, in January 2006, the show moved from BBC Two to BBC One on a three-month trial that became permanent, a decision which drew controversy after the moving of children's programming from its regular slot on the channel for the first time since the 1970s. =2006‚Äì2016= James Martin After Worrall Thompson left the network to present Saturday Cooks! in June 2006, James Martin took over as host from 24 June. During Martin's tenure, the audience increased from 1.2 million to around 2.5 million, peaking at 2.7 million on 9 January 2010. On 8 September 2012, the first episode was broadcast from a new studio set, which saw a new design and the addition of mains gas and running water. On 23 February 2016, Martin announced that he would be leaving the show to concentrate on other commitments, and \\"to have a lie in\\" on a Saturday.BBC NEWS His last show was on 26 March. Among those to cover in Martin's absence were Matt Tebbutt and John Torode. =2016‚Äì= Presenters Matt Tebbutt is the predominant presenter. Andi Oliver and Michel Roux Jr. have also presented several episodes. In the immediate months following James Martin's departure as presenter, the programme was presented by a variety of chefs, food writers, and restaurateurs. Michel Roux, Jr, Donal Skehan, Matt Tebbutt, and John Torode, all presented at least four editions between Martin's March departure and the end of 2016. Drinks' experts Each week, a drinks' expert pairs various drinks to go with the studio dishes. Jane Parkinson and Olly Smith are the predominant experts. Future (2017‚Äì2020) As part of the tender for the production of the programme released in October 2016, it was confirmed that the show and Best Bites will remain on air until March 2020, airing 52 episodes and 50 episodes per year respectively. It also confirmed the show will remain live and continue to feature guest chefs and archive content, but may see changes to the presenters. In February 2017, the BBC announced that Cactus TV and Daniel Piotrowski-Taylor had been awarded the tender. Features Rick Stein Each show typically includes a host chef and two guest chefs, each cooking in the studio. They are joined by a celebrity guest, usually on to promote a forthcoming or current project. Each guest chefs dish is paired with a drink chosen by an expert. In between each studio dish, excerpts are shown from the BBC Archives. The footage has most commonly come from Rick Stein and Keith Floyd, but have also featured James Martin, The Hairy Bikers, and Tom Kerridge, among many others. Before the introduction of the Heaven and Hell feature, the programme previously featured Worrall Thompson and guest chefs pitching a dish to be cooked, which the public voted on and a running total of wins were recorded by using fridge magnets. =Omelette Challenge= Each week, the guest chefs are challenged to cook a three-egg omelette, as quickly as possible. The current record holder is Theo Randall with a time of 14.76 seconds, set on 2 May 2015. The achievement was recognised by Guinness World Records and Randall is officially the world's fastest omelette maker. =Heaven or Hell= Each show concludes with the host and guest chefs cooking the celebrity guest a dish containing their favourite or least-favourite ingredient/s. Which dish is cooked depends on an online vote for viewers at home to choose heaven or hell. Formerly, only the viewers who phoned in to the show were able to vote, along with the guest chefs.

Young Controversies =Worrall Thompson defection= In June 2006, it was revealed that host Antony Worrall Thompson was to defect to ITV to host a similar cooking show in the same slot, Saturday Cooks!, though later rescheduled to noon. In addition to his defecting, the new show was to be made by the Saturday Kitchen producer, Prospect Pictures. In light of the changes, the programme was revamped with new host James Martin and new producer Cactus TV. At the same time, a new \\"Heaven or Hell\\" feature was introduced, which saw the celebrity guest provide their heaven and hell ingredients for two recipes, with the public phoning in to vote for the choice to be cooked at the end of the show. A sister show to the new Worrall Thompson show, Sunday Feast, had a similar feature at its launch, a week before the new feature was introduced as part of the revamp to the programme. The idea was, however, first announced three weeks before the launch of the revamped programme. =Misleading viewers= In February 2007, the programme was accused of misleading viewers to phone in to an apparently live segment, which was found to have been pre-recorded a week earlier. =Dietary requirements= In July 2016, Matt Tebbutt hosted an episode of Saturday Kitchen. Tebbutt was discussing food commandments with food critic and writer Jay Rayner, when Tebbutt said \\"I'd like people in restaurants to leave their dietary requirement at home. Unless, it's obviously life- threatening‚Äîthat would be wrong! There are so many dietary requirements these days.\\" One social media user stated: \\"For your information, dietary requirements aren't fussiness. Coeliac? Allergies? Ignorance makes dining out impossible for many.\\" Another said: \\"I wish intolerant views were left at home, so disappointing.\\" Other tweets read: \\"I love, love Saturday Kitchen, but not everyone with a dietary requirement is trying to make life difficult for restaurants\\" and \\"thanks for making those of us with dietary requirements feel even worse about eating out.\\" Tebbutt responded: \\"Apologies, was being flippant. I mean the 'faddy' eaters amongst us, that's all.\\" =Presenter selections= In January 2017, viewers took to social media to express their displeasure at Michel Roux, Jrs selection as host for an episode of Saturday Kitchen. A Guardian investigation published in November 2016, alleged that Roux had not paid some staff the minimum wage. The article also alleged that service charges added to bills had been used for restaurant revenues. Some viewers stated that they could not watch while Roux hosted. Roux has hosted several times since. Spin-offs The programme has produced a number of spin off series, including Spring Kitchen, Christmas Kitchen and Saturday Kitchen: Best Bites, a compilation programme currently airing on Sunday mornings on BBC Two, as well as the \\"Saturday Kitchen Cookbook with James Martin\\", published by BBC Books in July 2007. =Christmas Kitchen= Christmas Kitchen is a weekday, daytime spin-off of Saturday Kitchen. Series 1 (2013): Each show, James Martin was joined by guest chefs, including Gennaro Contaldo, Daniel Galmiche, Ching-He Huang, Nathan Outlaw, Theo Randall, Vivek Singh, and Bryn Williams. In addition to this, Martin was joined by a different star each show. These included James Blunt, Tom Chambers, Anthony Head, Ben Miller, and Sharleen Spiteri. Series 2 (2014): James Martin returned for another 10-episode run of Christmas Kitchen in December 2014. Over the 10 episodes, he was joined by several respected chefs, including Jason Atherton, Galton Blackiston, Monica Galetti, Ching-He Huang, Nathan Outlaw, Glynn Purnell, and Bryn Williams. Also joining Martin were various celebrity guests, including Jon Culshaw, Sophie Ellis-Bextor, Micky Flanagan, Dave Gorman, Alex Jones, Denise Lewis, Al Murray, Sarah Parish, and Frank Skinner. Series 3 (2016): Matt Tebbutt and Andi Oliver replaced Martin in the presenting role. As well as appearances from Sabrina Ghayour, Theo Randall, and Vivek Singh, Tebbutt and Oliver were also joined by previous Great British Bake Off contestants, including former winners Candice Brown, Edd Kimber, Frances Quinn, and Jo Wheatley. There were celebrity appearances from Ronni Ancona, Helen George, David Haig, Aled Jones, Miles Jupp, Adil Ray, Louise Redknapp, and Nina Wadia. =Spring Kitchen with Tom Kerridge= Spring Kitchen was a weekday, daytime spin-off of Saturday Kitchen presented by Tom Kerridge. The series aired for 14 episodes in April 2014. For each show, Kerridge was joined by different chefs, including Jason Atherton, Michael Caines, Daniel Clifford, Gennaro Contaldo, Lisa Goodwin-Allen, Angela Hartnett, Ching-He Huang, Tom Kitchin, Glynn Purnell, Theo Randall, and Bryn Williams. Kerridge was also joined by a diverse cross-section of celebrity guests, including Amanda Abbington, Chris Addison, Amanda Byram, Nicki Chapman, Jenny Eclair, Chris Hollins, Alex Jones, Jo Joyner, Nick Knowles, Dominic Littlewood, Craig Revel Horwood, Gaby Roslin, Danny Wallace, and Paul Young.

He was led to resign following a scandal surrounding an alleged sexual affair between Roche and his daughter-in-law, Lissa Jackson Roche, and her subsequent suicide. Roche received his bachelor's degree from Regis College (now Regis University) in 1956. He later received a masters and Ph.D. from the University of Colorado. Prior to becoming president of Hillsdale College Roche was a professor at the Colorado School of Mines. He also worked with the Foundation for Economic Education. The Center for Constructive Alternatives seminar program and the college's widely circulated speech digest, Imprimis, were started during Roche's years as college president. Under his leadership, many new buildings were constructed, including a sports complex that bears his name. Roche authored many books, such as Legacy of Freedom, The Bewildered Society, and The Book of Heroes, although it is believed that Lissa Roche, his daughter-in- law who worked at the college, was the ghostwriter of his later books. In the case of The Book of Heroes, Lissa is sometimes listed as a co-author and is acknowledged as a major contributor in its introduction. Ronald Reagan appointed Roche chairman of the National Council on Educational Research in 1984. The scandal broke out in 1999 when Lissa Jackson Roche claimed to have had an affair spanning 19 years with her husband's father. She threatened suicide, and her husband found her in the college arboretum with a handgun and her blood still warm, but was unable to prevent her self-inflicted death.Miller. \\"Horror in Hillsdale\\" Roche resigned in November 1999 and left public life. The widely publicized scandal brought national attention to Roche and Hillsdale. The 2000 book Hillsdale: Greek Tragedy in America's Heartland explores the events and questions whether Lissa Roche's death was actually suicide. Roche denied Lissa's allegations. After the scandal Roche moved to a remote cabin in Colorado. He visited Michigan briefly in 2005 to celebrate his 70th birthday.Trowbridge, Ron. \\"George Roche, Captain of Hillsdale Ship\\", Human Events. 16 May 2006.

American John Carpenter was disqualified, and teammates John Baxter Taylor and William Robbins refused to race in protest. A walkover, also W.O. or w/o (originally two words: \\"walk over\\") is the awarding of a victory to a contestant because there are no other contestants, or because the other contestants have been disqualified, or have forfeited, or have withdrawn from the contest. The term can apply in sport but also to uncontested elections, when it is also referred to as winning \\"by default\\". The word is used more generally by extension, particularly in politics, for an election in which the winner is not the only participant but has little or no competition.Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed.: walkover The narrow and extended meanings of \\"walkover\\" as a single word are both found from 1829. Sports The word originates from horseracing in the United Kingdom, where an entrant in a one- horse race run under Jockey Club rules has at least to \\"walk over\\" the course before being awarded victory. This outcome was quite common at a time when there was no guaranteed prize money for horses finishing second or third, so there was no incentive to run a horse in a race it could not win. The eighteenth century champion racehorse Eclipse was so dominant over his contemporaries that he was allowed to walk over on nine occasions, and the 1828 Epsom Derby winner Cadland walked over on at least six occasions. The term is also used in tennis, in reference to a player's unopposed victory as a result of the opponent's failing to start the match for any reason, such as injury. The only Olympic Games walkover for a gold medal was at the 1908 Summer Olympics: Wyndham Halswelle won a rerun of the 400 m race as the two other athletes refused to take part in the rerun. The first time it happened at the FIFA World Cup was in the 1938 edition, when Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany before the former was scheduled to play Sweden. Latvia was the runner-up in Austria's qualification group, but was not invited to participate; instead Austria's place remained empty, and Sweden, which would have been Austria's initial opponent, progressed directly to the second-round. The second time was in 1974 FIFA World Cup qualification, when the Soviet Union refused to play in Chile two months after the coup d'√©tat of 1973 and was disqualified from the tournament, giving the Chilean team a victory by walkover. In 2019, the Colombian women's basketball team was awarded a 20‚Äì0 walkover victory at the Pan Am games due to the Argentinean team's failure to wear the correct uniforms; the Argentinean team walked onto the court wearing blue, which had been designated as the Colombian team's jersey color. Use in poker In poker games that use blinds, a hand is considered a walkover (usually shortened to walk) when no other players call or raise the big blind, resulting in the player who posted the big blind winning the hand by default. Walks are most often seen in tournament play. Cash games often allow the players to \\"split the blinds\\" (i.e. take back their blind bets in case there are no callers or raisers by the time the action gets to the small blind), but this is usually not permitted in tournaments.

It was produced by Gary Lubow. The album was reissued on CD in 2007 with the single \\"Fuck Christmas\\" as a bonus track. The band re-recorded the album in its entirety and released it under the title The Fear Record in 2012. Reception The album has been regarded as Fear's best album and as a classic album of the 1980s Los Angeles hardcore punk scene. It has received mostly positive reviews, with Mark Deming of AllMusic rating the album 4.5 out of 5 stars and stating that it \\"makes sense that John Belushi was a big fan of Fear, because The Record sounds like the punk equivalent of the movie Animal House  puerile, offensive, and often reveling in its own ignorance, but pretty entertaining on a non-think level while it lasts\\". He also stated that Fear had a \\"fairly unique perspective  they seemingly embraced punk as an efficient way to piss off everyone around them, and there's no arguing that they achieved their goals with flying colors on their first and best album, The Record\\". Record Collector's Mark Rigby called it \\"probably the most exciting and impressive, one-dimensional, ill- mannered, distasteful, odious 'hate' record ever made\\". Legacy Kurt Cobain listed it in his top 50 albums of all time.

With a slightly altered track sequence, it was released by The End Records on November 6, 2012. Due to the sexism of songs such as \\"Beef Boloney\\" and the homophobia of the song \\"New York's Alright If You Like Saxophones\\", certain lyrics were altered for the remakes. The re- recorded album received mostly negative reviews from critics and fans alike. Jason Lymangrover of AllMusic rated it 2.5 out of 5 stars and stated: \\"The reason why this was made is a complete mystery. The '80s version is obviously the way to go. It's a perfect snapshot of the snottiest band of the punk movement baiting everyone and everything around them\\". He also said that \\"finances played into the band disbanding before, so there is a good chance that this version was devised as a way to cash in.

Its application is important in areas such as radiation protection, ion implantation and nuclear medicine. ICRU Report 73: Stopping of Ions heavier than Helium, Journal of the ICRU, 5 No. 1 (2005), Oxford Univ. Press Graphic showing relationships between radioactivity and detected ionizing radiation Definition and Bragg curve Both charged and uncharged particles lose energy while passing through matter. Positive ions are considered in most cases below. The stopping power depends on the type and energy of the radiation and on the properties of the material it passes. Since the production of an ion pair (usually a positive ion and a (negative) electron) requires a fixed amount of energy (for example, 33.97 eV in dry air), the number of ionizations per path length is proportional to the stopping power. The stopping power of the material is numerically equal to the loss of energy E per unit path length, x: : S(E) = -dE/dx The minus sign makes S positive. Bragg curve of 5.49 MeV alpha particles in air The force usually increases toward the end of range and reaches a maximum, the Bragg peak, shortly before the energy drops to zero. The curve that describes the force as function of the material depth is called the Bragg curve. This is of great practical importance for radiation therapy. The equation above defines the linear stopping power which in the international system is expressed in N but is usually indicated in other units like MeV/mm or similar. If a substance is compared in gaseous and solid form, then the linear stopping powers of the two states are very different just because of the different density. One therefore often divides the force by the density of the material to obtain the mass stopping power which in the international system is expressed in m4/s2 but is usually found in units like MeV/(mg/cm2) or similar. The mass stopping power then depends only very little on the density of the material. The picture shows how the stopping power of 5.49 MeV alpha particles increases while the particle traverses air, until it reaches the maximum. This particular energy corresponds to that of the alpha particle radiation from naturally radioactive gas radon (222Rn) which is present in the air in minute amounts. The mean range can be calculated by integrating the reciprocal stopping power over energy: : \\\\Delta x=\\\\int_{0}^{E_0}\\\\frac{1}{S(E)}\\\\, dE where: :E0 is the initial kinetic energy of the particle :Œîx is the \\"continuous slowing down approximation (CSDA)\\" range and :S(E) is the linear stopping power. The deposited energy can be obtained by integrating the stopping power over the entire path length of the ion while it moves in the material. Electronic, nuclear and radiative stopping Electronic stopping refers to the slowing down of a projectile ion due to the inelastic collisions between bound electrons in the medium and the ion moving through it. The term inelastic is used to signify that energy is lost during the process (the collisions may result both in excitations of bound electrons of the medium, and in excitations of the electron cloud of the ion as well). Linear electronic stopping power is identical to unrestricted linear energy transfer. Instead of energy transfer, some models consider the electronic stopping power as momentum transfer between electron gas and energetic ion. This is consistent with the result of Bethe in the high energy range. Since the number of collisions an ion experiences with electrons is large, and since the charge state of the ion while traversing the medium may change frequently, it is very difficult to describe all possible interactions for all possible ion charge states. Instead, the electronic stopping power is often given as a simple function of energy F_e (E) which is an average taken over all energy loss processes for different charge states. It can be theoretically determined to an accuracy of a few % in the energy range above several hundred keV per nucleon from theoretical treatments, the best known being the Bethe formula. At energies lower than about 100 keV per nucleon, it becomes more difficult to determine the electronic stopping using analytical models.P. Sigmund: Stopping of heavy ions. Springer Tracts in Modern Physics Vol. 204 (2004) Recently real-time Time-dependent density functional theory has been successfully used to accurately determine the electronic stopping for various ion-target systems over a wide range of energies including the low energy regime. keV per nucleon. Graphical presentations of experimental values of the electronic stopping power for many ions in many substances have been given by Paul.Stopping Power for Light Ions The accuracy of various stopping tables has been determined using statistical comparisons. Nuclear stopping power refers to the elastic collisions between the projectile ion and atoms in the sample (the established designation \\"nuclear\\" may be confusing since nuclear stopping is not due to nuclear forces, but it is meant to note that this type of stopping involves the interaction of the ion with the nuclei in the target). If one knows the form of the repulsive potential energy E (r) between two atoms (see below), it is possible to calculate the nuclear stopping power F_n (E). In the stopping power figure shown above for aluminium ions in aluminum, nuclear stopping is negligible except at the lowest energy. Nuclear stopping increases when the mass of the ion increases. In the figure shown on the right, nuclear stopping is larger than electronic stopping at low energy. For very light ions slowing down in heavy materials, the nuclear stopping is weaker than the electronic at all energies. Especially in the field of radiation damage in detectors, the term \\"non-ionizing energy loss\\" (NIEL) is used as a term opposite to the linear energy transfer (LET), see e.g. Refs. Since per definition nuclear stopping power does not involve electronic excitations, NIEL and nuclear stopping can be considered to be the same quantity in the absence of nuclear reactions. The total non-relativistic stopping power is therefore the sum of two terms: F(E) = F_e (E) + F_n (E). Several semi-empirical stopping power formulas have been devised. The model given by Ziegler, Biersack and Littmark (the so-called \\"ZBL\\" stopping, see next chapter),J. F. Ziegler, J. P. Biersack, and U. Littmark. In The Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter, volume 1, New York, 1985. Pergamon. J. F. Ziegler, J. P. Biersack, and M. D. Ziegler: SRIM - The Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter, SRIM Co., 2008. implemented in different versions of the TRIM/SRIM codes, is used most often today. At extremely high ion energies, one also has to consider radiative stopping power which is due to the emission of bremsstrahlung in the electric fields of the particles in the material traversed. For electron projectiles, radiative stopping is always important. At high ion energies, there may also be energy losses due to nuclear reactions, but such processes are not normally described by stopping power. Close to the surface of a solid target material, both nuclear and electronic stopping may lead to sputtering. The slowing-down process in solids Illustration of the slowing down of a single ion in a solid material In the beginning of the slowing-down process at high energies, the ion is slowed mainly by electronic stopping, and it moves almost in a straight path. When the ion has slowed sufficiently, the collisions with nuclei (the nuclear stopping) become more and more probable, finally dominating the slowing down. When atoms of the solid receive significant recoil energies when struck by the ion, they will be removed from their lattice positions, and produce a cascade of further collisions in the material. These collision cascades are the main cause of damage production during ion implantation in metals and semiconductors. When the energies of all atoms in the system have fallen below the threshold displacement energy, the production of new damage ceases, and the concept of nuclear stopping is no longer meaningful. The total amount of energy deposited by the nuclear collisions to atoms in the materials is called the nuclear deposited energy. The inset in the figure shows a typical range distribution of ions deposited in the solid. The case shown here might, for instance, be the slowing down of a 1 MeV silicon ion in silicon. The mean range for a 1 MeV ion is typically in the micrometer range. =Repulsive interatomic potentials= At very small distances between the nuclei the repulsive interaction can be regarded as essentially Coulombic. At greater distances, the electron clouds screen the nuclei from each other. Thus the repulsive potential can be described by multiplying the Coulombic repulsion between nuclei with a screening function œÜ(r/a), : V(r) = { 1 \\\\over 4 \\\\pi \\\\varepsilon_0} {Z_1Z_2 e^2 \\\\over r} \\\\varphi(r/a) where œÜ(r/a) ‚Üí 1 when r ‚Üí 0. Here Z_1 and Z_2 are the charges of the interacting nuclei, and r the distance between them; a is the so-called screening parameter. A large number of different repulsive potentials and screening functions have been proposed over the years, some determined semi-empirically, others from theoretical calculations. A much used repulsive potential is the one given by Ziegler, Biersack and Littmark, the so-called ZBL repulsive potential. It has been constructed by fitting a universal screening function to theoretically obtained potentials calculated for a large variety of atom pairs. The ZBL screening parameter and function have the forms : a = a_u = { 0.8854a_0 \\\\over Z_1^{0.23} + Z_2^{0.23} } and : \\\\varphi(x) = 0.1818e^{-3.2x} +0.5099e^{-0.9423x} +0.2802e^{-0.4028x} +0.02817e^{-0.2016x} where x = r/au, and a0 is the Bohr atomic radius = 0.529 √Ö. The standard deviation of the fit of the universal ZBL repulsive potential to the theoretically calculated pair- specific potentials it is fit to is 18% above 2 eV. Even more accurate repulsive potentials can be obtained from self-consistent total energy calculations using density-functional theory and the local-density approximation (LDA) for electronic exchange and correlation. =Channeling= In crystalline materials the ion may in some instances get \\"channeled\\", i.e., get focused into a channel between crystal planes where it experiences almost no collisions with nuclei. Also, the electronic stopping power may be weaker in the channel. Thus the nuclear and electronic stopping do not only depend on material type and density but also on its microscopic structure and cross- section. =Computer simulations of ion slowing down= Computer simulation methods to calculate the motion of ions in a medium have been developed since the 1960s, and are now the dominant way of treating stopping power theoretically. The basic idea in them is to follow the movement of the ion in the medium by simulating the collisions with nuclei in the medium. The electronic stopping power is usually taken into account as a frictional force slowing down the ion. Conventional methods used to calculate ion ranges are based on the binary collision approximation (BCA). In these methods the movement of ions in the implanted sample is treated as a succession of individual collisions between the recoil ion and atoms in the sample. For each individual collision the classical scattering integral is solved by numerical integration. The impact parameter p in the scattering integral is determined either from a stochastic distribution or in a way that takes into account the crystal structure of the sample. The former method is suitable only in simulations of implantation into amorphous materials, as it does not account for channeling. The best known BCA simulation program is TRIM/SRIM (acronym for TRansport of Ions in Matter, in more recent versions called Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter), which is based on the ZBL electronic stopping and interatomic potential.SRIM web site It has a very easy-to-use user interface, and has default parameters for all ions in all materials up to an ion energy of 1 GeV, which has made it immensely popular. However, it doesn't take account of the crystal structure, which severely limits its usefulness in many cases. Several BCA programs overcome this difficulty; some fairly well known are MARLOWE, BCCRYS and crystal-TRIM. Although the BCA methods have been successfully used in describing many physical processes, they have some obstacles for describing the slowing down process of energetic ions realistically. Basic assumption that collisions are binary results in severe problems when trying to take multiple interactions into account. Also, in simulating crystalline materials the selection process of the next colliding lattice atom and the impact parameter p always involve several parameters which may not have perfectly well defined values, which may affect the results 10‚Äì20% even for quite reasonable-seeming choices of the parameter values. The best reliability in BCA is obtained by including multiple collisions in the calculations, which is not easy to do correctly. However, at least MARLOWE does this. A fundamentally more straightforward way to model multiple atomic collisions is provided by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, in which the time evolution of a system of atoms is calculated by solving the equations of motion numerically. Special MD methods have been devised in which the number of interactions and atoms involved in MD simulations have been reduced in order to make them efficient enough for calculating ion ranges. The MD simulations this automatically describe the nuclear stopping power. The electronic stopping power can be readily included in molecular dynamics simulations, either as a frictional force or in a more advanced manner by also following the heating of the electronic systems and coupling the electronic and atomic degrees of freedom. Minimum ionizing particle Beyond the maximum, stopping power decreases approximately like 1/v2 with increasing particle velocity v, but after a minimum, it increases again.http://pdg.lbl.gov/2005/reviews/passagerpp.pdf A minimum ionizing particle (or mip) is a particle whose mean energy loss rate through matter is close to the minimum. In many practical cases, relativistic particles (e.g., cosmic-ray muons) are minimum ionizing particles.

It is becoming rare due to habitat loss. Physical characteristics Dryophytes andersonii, only about long, is one of the smaller species of tree frogs. Members of the species are predominantly green, with wide, dark stripes. They often have spotted, orange-gold markings on the hidden surfaces of their legs and tend to have large toe pads. The key to distinguishing the Pine Barrens tree frog from the similar-appearing American green tree frog (D. cinerea) is the white- bordered lavender stripe on each side of the body in the Pine Barrens tree frog. D. cinerea has only a white stripe in this location. Habitat Dryophytes andersonii is most commonly found in brushy areas, often near peat bogs or shallow ponds. They usually inhabit areas carpeted with thick moss. Adults are terrestrial, but tend to reside near water sources. Unlike most frogs, they are tolerant of low pH levels, and often lay eggs in shallow, acidic ponds. The ideal pH level for D. andersonii eggs is between 3.8 and 5.9.  Distribution  Geographical distribution of Dryophytes andersonii Database entry includes a range map and justification for why this species is near threatened. RangeMap: Due to the limited extent of suitable habitats, Dryophytes andersonii is currently distributed in three disjunct areas in the southeastern United States: the New Jersey Pine Barrens; the Sandhills of North and South Carolina; and the Florida panhandle and southern Alabama. Although one specimen of D. andersonii is known from Georgia, a population is not known to currently exist there. Dryophytes andersonii is the state amphibian of North Carolina. Conservation status Dryophytes andersonii was listed as endangered by the US Fish and Wildlife Service between 1977 and 1983, when additional populations were found in Florida. The IUCN has classified it as Near Threatened as of 1996. In popular culture The Pine Barrens tree frog was featured in a series of prints by artist Andy Warhol. In 1983, the artist was commissioned to create a portfolio of ten endangered species to raise environmental awareness and included was D. andersonii.

The series was initially intended to be a television pilot that went on to be published as comic, before being picked up as a TV series for the 2008 season by ABC Family,ABC Family brood growing but cancelled the same year.  Publication history  The first issue hit the shelves in July, 2005. The mini-series was collected as a single trade paperback volume, entitled The Trade Paperback Imperative. The second trade volume, entitled The Second Volume Inevitability, was released on July 2006 and includes the supplement Legends of the Middlemen, three short stories chronicling the adventures of past Middlemen. The third \\"mini-series\\" was released straight to trade in 2007 as The Third Volume Inescapability. All three volumes were collected in 2008 into a single volume, The Middleman: The Collected Series Indispensability. In 2009, a fourth volume, The Middleman: The Doomsday Armageddon Apocalypse, was published. Unlike the previous comics, this volume was based on an unpublished script for the ABC Family TV series and serves as the show's finale.The Doomsday Armageddon Apocolypse Plot The Middleman's slogan is \\"fighting evil so you don't have to\\" and the character has been doing it for an unknown length of time. The Middleman is not just the incarnation in the current mini series; it is a job, a title, a persona that is handed down from Middleman to Middleman. There are no written records of the Middlemen throughout history; only Ida holds the answers to the present day Middleman's predecessors. Each Middleman receives information via Ida from the \\"Organization Too Secret To Know\\" (O2STK). They carry out their orders in typical hero fashion and always save the day. The series follows hero-by-day, artist-by-night Wendy Watson as she tries to balance her normal life of boyfriends, mothers, and roommates with her more surreal adventures with the Middleman. She is presumably training to become the next Middleman. Thus far, the adventures of four Middlemen have been chronicled in the book and its supplementsPresent Day Middleman, World War Two Middleman (and his doomed sidekick \\"The Middleboy\\"), Victorian Middleman and Barbarian Middleman, who operates in a quasi-Hyborean era. All of the historic Middlemen (with the exception of Victorian Middleman) have female sidekicks who bear a peculiar resemblance to Wendy. In November, 2011, it was announced that The Middleman would cross over with Doctor Who, although the Doctor may not be mentioned by name.  Characters  = The Middleman (present day) = The Middlemans real name and past is unknown to anyone, save Ida, although in the first comic book series (and first episode of the TV series) he recounts having been a Navy SEAL and being recruited shortly after having been cashiered for insubordination. But even though much of his life is a mystery, his character is unmistakable. In the third trade paperback series, and the scripted 13th episode of the TV show (turned into a standalone comic book), he is revealed to be named Clarence (full name Clarence Colton in the 13th episode). The 13th episode also revealed the Middleman who recruited him. The Middleman is what Grillo-Marxuach calls a \\"Dirk Squarejaw\\" character. He is the all American hero and a callback to heroes of more innocent times. He hardly ever swears. He is rugged, dorky, and he drinks his four glasses of milk every day. It was lightly hinted in the first episode that he had feelings for Wendy. In the ABC Family TV version, he is played by Matt Keeslar. = Wendy Watson = Wendy is The Middleman's sidekick and presumably a Middleman-in-training. She was picked because the weird things that the Middleman deals with on a daily basis do not faze her. In many ways, she is the total opposite of The Middleman, which makes her even more perfect for the job. She is an artist by passion and a temp-worker by necessity. On one of her temp-jobs, something went horribly wrong and she accidentally met The Middleman. He recruited her under the guise of the Jolly Fats Wehawkin Temp Agency. Wendy's roommate calls her \\"Dub-Dub\\", for her initials \\"WW\\", and reminiscent of the name of Doctor Dolittle's housekeeper, a duck named Dab- Dab. The Middleman picked up on this nickname, and frequently calls her \\"Dubbie\\". In the ABC Family TV version, Wendy is played by Natalie Morales. = Ida = Ida is a \\"soulless android from outer space masquerading as a cranky librarian\\". Like many things in the Middleverse, not much is known about her other than she is the only link between all of the Middlemen. She is the one thing that has been there since the inception of the Middleman program. The only evidence to her origins come from what she can do, which seems to be almost anything. She has been able to interface with every electronic device she has come in contact with thus far and can also produce a number of weapons. She also used to have the ability to change her personality and appearance until her circuits got stuck on domineering schoolmarm. In the ABC Family TV version, she is played by Mary Pat Gleason. = Lacey Thornfield III = Lacey Thornfield is Wendy's sexpot roommate. She is a conceptual artist who specializes in confrontational spoken-word performance art and works small jobs to pay off her student loans. It is unclear exactly what she knows about Wendy's new job, but she's clearly suspicious. In the ABC Family series she also has demonstrated an apparent crush on the Middleman, as shown by her often referring to him as \\"sexy boss-man\\" or \\"pillow lips\\". In the ABC Family TV version, Lacey is played by Brit Morgan. = Noser = Nosers real name is unknown in the continuity of the ABC Family series. He is frequently seen sparring song lyrics with Wendy as she returns to her apartment but has also appeared in other roles assisting Wendy and her roommate. Noser was, previously unknown to his friends, a world-famous ventriloquist, who retired when he was thirteen. He came out of retirement for a short time to pay off some loans. His ventriloquist dummy is named \\"Young Noser\\". In the ABC Family TV version, Noser is played by Jake Smollett. = Sensei Ping = Sensei Ping is the martial arts trainer for the Middlemen. He is a member of the Clan of the Pointed Stick, the greatest warrior in the world, and the only man alive to master the Wu-Han Thumb of Death. He wears a Mexican wrestling mask as a tribute to the only man he could not technically beat: El Sapo Dorado, who suffered a fatal heart attack on their twenty-sixth day of fighting. In the ABC Family TV version, Sensei Ping is played by Mark Dacascos. = O2STK = O2STK stands for \\"Organization Too Secret To Know\\". the organization that gives the Middlemen their marching orders when evil needs fighting. The Middleman and Ida came up with the name as a joke because nothing is known about the organization, not even its real name. Not even Ida knows anything about them. = Ben Stanley = Ben Stanley is Wendy's on-again/off-again boyfriend. He is a film student who is in touch with his sensitive side but can be a total jerk due to poor social skills. He later publishes the footage of his breakup with Wendy on the Internet, which became an overnight hit and he was whisked off to stardom as a genius movie director.  Volumes  =Volume 1 ‚Äì The Trade Paperback Imperative=  Synopsis  Volume 1 is the origin story of Wendy Watson. It starts off with her working yet another boring temp job at A.N.D. Laboratories. She is on the phone with her mother when something goes horribly wronga giant tentacled ass monster escapes the labs. It grabs her, and without even panicking, she grabs a letter opener and stabs it. The beast is wounded, but not downthat is until the day is saved by the Middleman. Due to Wendy's response to her life-threatening situation, The Middleman recruits her under the guise of the Jolly Fats Wehawkin Temp Agency. Her first response to the offer is a hearty, \\"Hell no.\\" But after her boyfriend breaks up with her (and films it as the subject of his latest documentary), she re-evaluates her life and decision. Wendy joins The Middleman and quickly starts her first adventure. Mobsters have been dying and the only clues are banana peels left at the scene of the crimes. The banana peels lead them to Simionics Ltd., where they find genetically engineered apes. They are given a tour by a Dr. Gibbs. Everything seems in order, until they find that a gorilla named Spanky is missing. Spanky also had access to a secret room where he had been collecting and watching mobster movies. After a few scuffles with the talking Spanky, they return to Simionics Ltd. There, they are greeted by a legion of monkeys and a cackling Dr. Gibbs. She planned to build an army of genetically engineered apes to take over the world. The Middleman and Wendy fight with the army and in the process destroy the computer that controls the higher brain functions of the simians. The story ends with Dr. Gibbs in jail, with apes having a safe level of intelligence, and with Wendy more inspired artistically than she has been in a while.

Only, La Cage De Lumiere, the world's most precious diamond, has just been stolen and also requires his attention. Since The Middleman can not be in two places at once, he reluctantly sends Wendy to pick up Sensei Ping. On their way back to Jolly Fats Wehawkin Temp Agency, Sensei Ping is kidnapped and Wendy is knocked out by a group of Mexican Wrestlers. The wrestlers get around in a truck for a Latino dairy delivery company named \\"Los Huevos Gigantes\\". In fact, they're the ones who stole La Cage De Lumiere. Using the diamond in concert with a high-powered laser, the wrestlers create a cage of light which they use to imprison Sensei Ping, and the most lethal man alive is finally trapped without hope of escape. The Middleman launches a rescue operation, but in the process gets caught. Ida and Wendy try to help, but the wrestlers escape with their prisoners after decapitating Ida and shooting Ben, who followed Wendy, in the chest. The Mexican wrestlers take Sensei Ping and the Middleman to the Dread Pyramid of Itzilichlitlichlitzl to charge them for past crimes. They accuse Sensei Ping of killing the greatest masked wrestler to ever slap the canvasthe legendary El Sapo Dorado. Ping pleads with them. He says he did not kill him, but fought with him for twenty- six straight days, and on the last day of their fight, El Sapo Dorado had a fatal heart attack. Ping took his mask to honor him, for he was the only man he could never beat. They, of course, did not believe him and the only way out is for Ping to choose a champion to fight a champion chosen by the wrestlers. So, the Middleman is going to have to take on Cien Mascaras. Cien Mascaras was once a man with a hundred masks, but then he was cursed by an Aztec mummy and now he is one hundred identical men who must all wear the same mask. Hoping to mount a rescue, Wendy flies the Middlejet to the wrestlers' stronghold, the Dread Pyramid of Itzilichlitlichlitzlbut not before the Middleman enters his trial by combat against Cien Mascaras. After putting up a brave struggle and taking out dozens of Cien Mascarases, the Middleman is overcome and his leg is broken. As the remaining Cien Mascarases set upon for the kill, Wendy arrives and short circuits the laser cage holding Sensei Ping. In a display of unspeakable violence, Sensei Ping proceeds to slaughter every last one of the wrestlerssaving his signature finishing move, the Wu-Han Thumb of Death, for El Maestro De Ceremonias, leader of the wrestling troupe and architect of the blood feud. Returning to the states, the Middleman assures Wendy that she has impressed Sensei Ping, and that someday she will make a great Middleman ... but the victory is bittersweet, as Wendy rushes to see Ben at the hospital, and he breaks up with her once and for all: he doesn't have the stomach to understand her new life as a Middleman in training.

The Kingdom's universities provide, through their medical colleges or hospitals, specialist curative services and medical education and training programs, while they also conduct health research in collaboration with other research centers. The Government also finances and provides care on a referral basis in its major specialized national tertiary care referral hospitals King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center and King Khalid Eye Specialist Hospital. The King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center uses highly advanced technologies and act as a reference hospital for cases that require advanced and specialist treatment, while it also conducts research on health issues in general and those related to the Kingdom in particular. The King Khalid Eye Specialist Hospital is designed to be a large health facility offering high quality specialized services for ophthalmology and eye surgery and medicine as well as being a regional research center in the area of ophthalmology. The hospital also has a cornea bank in which imported corneas are stored. The ministry maintains the Saudi Health Office in London. =Budget= Budget allocated to the health sector by the Ministry of Health was in: *1956: 39,549,458 SR *1958: 68,480,000 SR *1960: 116,395,000 SR *2009: 40.43 billion SR *2010: 61.2 billion SR *2011: 68.7 billion SRhttp://www.yahind.com/saudi-budget-for-2011-helps-attain-robust-healthcare- system_24325.html =Electronic health records= In 2010, Saudi Arabian National Guard Health Affairs was recognized with the Arab Health Award for \\"Excellence in Electronic Health Records\\". =Private sector= The private sector provides health services through its health facilities including hospitals, dispensaries, laboratories, pharmacies and physiotherapy centers throughout the kingdom. Provision by the private sector at the end of the year 2000: * 100 hospitals with 8,485 beds, accounting for about 19 percent of the total number of hospitals beds in the kingdom. * 622 dispensaries, 785 clinics, 45 medical laboratories and 11 physiotherapy centers. * 273 pharmaceutical stores and 3,209 pharmacies. * Increased investments in manufacturing of drugs and medical supplies of medical appliances, and pharmaceuticals, in addition to the operation of some governmental hospitals and maintenance and cleaning in all health facilities. * Increased contribution of the private sector in the provision of health care services, where out-patient visits increased from 12.1% of total out-patient visits in 1994 to 16.1% in 1998. In-patients in the Kingdom's private hospitals rose from 16.6% in 1994 to 27.1% in 1998. Foreign investment in health is subject to the Private Health Institutes Law. Until 2019 this only permitted foreign ownership of hospitals, but now any kind of healthcare facility can be owned by foreign investors. Benefits Saudis and public sector expatriates are eligible for a comprehensive package of benefits including, public health, preventive, diagnostic, and curative services and pharmaceuticals with few exclusions and no cost sharing. Most services including state of the art cardio-vascular procedures, organ transplants, and cancer treatments (including bone marrow transplants) are covered. Sponsors/employers are responsible for paying for an extensive package of services for private sector expatriates. History Government prioritization of preventive healthcare and environmental health began in 1925 following the establishment a public health department. The decision to create it came after a royal decree from King Abdul Aziz Al-Saud. By 1926, the first school of nursing was opened, followed by the school of health and emergencies in 1927. Health services expanded in 1951 with the establishment of the Ministry of Health. A ministerial ordinance in 1980 led to a conglomeration of the administration of the existing dispensaries, health centers, health offices and maternal and child health centers into one unit. By the end of the 1980s, there were 253 hospitals, 38,955 hospital beds and 1,640 primary health centers. The proportion of positions filled by Saudi nationals was low, with Saudi nationals representing 13% doctors (22,633 doctors), 11.2% nurses (45,840 nurses) and 38% health technicians (25,192 health technicians). In 1993, the total number of hospitals was 281, 41,789 hospital beds and 1,707 primary health centers and the positions filled by Saudi nationals increased to 22.7% doctors, 24.5% nursing staff and 41.8% health technicians. In 2002, the Saudi health system was established by a Royal decree to insure the provision of comprehensive and integrate health care to all population in Saudi Arabia in a fair minded, organized and affordable manner. In 2004, there were 1,848 primary health care centers and 200 hospitals. The Ministry of Health budget increased from 2.8% of the total National budget in 1970 to 6.4% in 2004. In 2006, there were 20.4 doctors and 35.4 nurses per 10,000 population. In 2008 there were 1925 health care centers throughout the kingdom and 220 hospitals which adopted the referral system which provided curative care for all members of society from the level of general practitioners at health care centers to antecedent technology specialist curative services through a broad base of general and specialist hospitals. =Government Hospitals in Riyadh (public hospitals)= *King Khaled Eye Specialist Hospital *King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center - Founded in 1975, and specialized in incurable diseases, which can not be treated in other centers and the hospital has a section of equipment containing all types of diagnostic radiology such as MRI, CT scan. *Mental Health Hospital - Overseeing the cases outside the hospital and it consists of three parts, interior and outpatient clinics and ambulance 24 hours as there is in the hospital pharmacy and laboratory. *King Fahad Medical City in Riyadh city =Introduction of health insurance= In 2005, health insurance was made compulsory for all non-Saudi nationals working in the country under the Cooperative Health Insurance Act.http://www.zawya.com/Story.cfm/sidZAWYA20051025034746/SecIndustries/pagFinancial%20Services/lok034700051025 In 2008, this act was extended to include Saudi nationals working for the private sector. Enforcement of this compulsory coverage include fines for non- compliant companies and a refusal to renew working permits without insurance.

The magnificent bird-of-paradise is distributed amongst the hill and mid-mountain forests of New Guinea and surrounding islands. Like most members of the family Paradisaeidae, the male is polygamous and performs an elaborate courtship display. A widespread and common species throughout their large range, the magnificent bird-of-paradise is evaluated as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. They are listed on Appendix II of CITES. Etymology The generic name Cicinnurus means \\"curled tail\\" and its specific name magnificus means magnificent or splendid. The species was formerly listed in the genus Diphyllodes, which means \\"Double leaf-like\\", referring to its \\"leaf-like\\" tail. Description Male specimen, race hunsteini, at the Naturalis Biodiversity Center. Note the iridescent scale- like feathers going down the breast shield. As the name suggests, the magnificent bird-of-paradise is magnificent indeed. It has one of the most complex plumage arrangements in the family Paradisaeidae. It reaches around 26‚Äì26.5 cm in total length, though the body is around 19 cm. The male has beautiful golden-yellow wings, which are overlapped by a sulfur-colored mantle, or cape, that deflect white a whitish glow, with deep red feathers bordered by black beneath the cape that form a semi-circle over the wings; there are also scruffy brownish feathers on the sides of the cape. The head is fairly short; it is a light brown in a scalloped pattern on the top that extends to the back of the neck, and a darker reddish-brown on the face and below the chin. It has a pale grey-bluish bill, dark brown eyes and a thin, white line that extend behind the eyes. Below is an entirely different story; almost the entire underside consists of the large, iridescent green breast shield, which is finely decorated with lime-green to turquoise scale-like feathers that run down the middle of it. The plumage under the shield is blackish-brown. When fully extended, the breast shield is edged with shiny turquoise-greenish. The tail is blackish-brown with two long, sickle-like, partially curved central tail plumes that are colored light blue. As characteristic in the genus Cicinnurus, both sexes have colorfully blue legs and feet. The female is drastically different from the extravagant male; she is light-brown above, including the tail (which lacks the long sickles). Her head is light brown, but the chin is intercepted by brown barring and creamy feathers that extend all the way to the rump. Her bill is the same color as the males', and she also has a white line extending behind the eyes. It is sympatric with its congener, the King Bird-of-paradise, and hybridization has been noted several times. Over 20 specimens of these hybrids exist in museums, though no wild records have ever occurred. It was once even thought to be a separate species, called King of Holland's Bird-of-paradise (\\"Diphyllodes gulielmitertii\\"); this hybrid is scarlet red above, of the King, with the golden mantle cape of the Magnificent, also sporting two long tail wires more resembling the king's, but being partially curved at the tip with no green spirals that the king sports. Behavior They tend to favor tropical and subtropical montane and hill forest at altitudes of around 1500 m, though they can be found around 1780 m as well. They build their courts on rugged slopes of rocky and uneven terrain. The birds feed mainly on fruits, but also feed on animal matter (notably insects, reptiles and amphibians), and possibly take nectar and flowers. They mainly feed solitarily, but may also feed in mixed- species congregations. The courtship display of the male is very unique in its family. It typically takes place on a sapling standing up from the ground. He commonly tends to his court and makes sure it stays clean and clear of fallen debris. When a female attends his court, he is usually on his display perch. Here is where he does his display; he leans backwards to point where his body is perpendicular to the sapling, raises his mantle cape, to where it appears like a yellow halo behind his head, expands and flexes his iridescent breast shield, and waggles his sickle-shaped tail on each side. Though this performance is comical, it is often observed by many females nearby, who do not take the male mating with the core audience member too lightly. When the male is about to copulate the core female, other females nearby will spring from their perches to attack and shoe off the female, and the male is discouraged and may have to wait a while to perform again. Typical of most of the bird-of-paradise family, the female takes up all parental duties, including nest-building, incubation and chick-rearing. They lay one to two creamy yellow eggs, and incubation usually concludes within 19 days, and the chicks usually fledge in 18 days. Taxonomy The Magnificent bird is included in the same genus as the King and Wilson's Birds-of-paradise, though it's more closely related to the latter. The genus Cicinnurus forms a clade with the genera Paradisaea and Paradisornis, and the other closest genus is Astrapia, though it is not included in the clade. This species has three subspecies: *C. m. magnificus (Forster, 1781) *C. m. chrysopterus (Elliot, 1873) *C. m. hunsteini (Meyer, 1885) Gallery File:Bird Of Paradise 001.jpgMale File:John Gould and W.

The film revolves around the interview of two prison inmates, firstly, Kothala Thevar's (Pasupathy) life sentence, and secondly, Virumaandi (Haasan), who is sentenced to be hanged. The criminals express how they feel about the direction that their lives have taken and how they have ended up where they are. The film's narrative is based on the Rashomon effect. The film revolves around the controversy of the death penalty. The cast also includes Abhirami, Napoleon, Rohini, Shanmugarajan, and Nassar in pivotal roles. The film's score and soundtrack were composed by Ilayaraaja. It was dubbed into Telugu as Pothuraju. The film won critical acclaim and was a commercial success at the box office. This film acquired cult status in Tamil cinema and inspired similar themes. Plot The film begins with Dr. Angela Kathamuthu (Rohini), a civil rights activist and her cameraman in Madras Central Prison interviewing prisoners serving life imprisonment and awaiting the death sentence, for her PhD thesis in law, against the death penalty. When she enters the prison for the second day, there is a sit-in protest, demanding the reason for the sudden death of death penalty convict Narayanan, who secretly told Angela, the previous day, about immoral practices of Deputy-Jailer Peykkaman (Shanmugarajan). Angela meets Kothala Thevar (Pasupathy), who is serving a life sentence for assisting in the murder of 24 people in District of Theni. He tells his version of the story that led to his conviction. According to him, the root cause of the problem is Virumaandi Thevar (Kamal Haasan), a happy-go-lucky rogue. Virumaandi has a large part of the land in CK Patti, their village, and has high underground water levels, which is eyed by every other farmer. Virumaandi lost his mother when he was four. He was taken to Chennai and later to Singapore by his father Thavasi Thevar. Even after Thavasi died, Virumandi still lived there, but at the age of 25, Virumaandi was convicted for a small crime. He was whipped and exiled back to India. He comes back to live with his paternal grandmother (S. N. Lakshmi) in CK Patti and to practice agriculture. His support to his uncle Kothala in his clash against Nallama Naicker (Napoleon) brings about a bonding between the two, as Naicker killed Kothala's father in a melee caused during a peace meeting between Thavasi and Kothala's father. Annalakshmi (Abhirami), Kothala's young niece, falls in love for Virumaandi. Kothala, with an eye on the fertile land owned by Virumaandi, does not object to the romance. An assassination attempt on Virumaandi is blamed on Naicker, and in the ensuing peace meeting of eight villages, Virumaandi's gang is verbally humiliated. Virumaandi goes to Naicker's village alone to take revenge at night, and Kothala's gang is forced to save him, where 24 lives are taken. Virumaandi saves all of them by his false testification so that he can marry Annalakshmi, but Kothala seemingly refused the marriage. According to Kothala, Annalakshmi was abducted by Virumaandi and brutally raped. She later escapes from him, comes home, tells what happened, and commits suicide by hanging herself. A clash between Virumaandi and Kothala takes place in which six henchmen are killed. Virumaandi then escapes and kills Naicker, but he is later caught by the police. In the 26 people murder case, Virumaandi testifies against Kothala's gang, getting them all 15-year sentences, while Virumaandi gets five years for raping Annalakshmi and then the death penalty for the six people murder case. Here, Kothala stops and says that God has given justice, but Virumaandi is still angry. Angela tries to make Virumaandi talk, but Virumaandi verbally assaults her badly. Finally, Angela says that she is doing a PhD against the death penalty, as her father, who got her married to James by great hard work, was forced to kill James to save her from marital abuse. Her father was hanged in the same prison, and then she chose law as a career. After much resentment and objection, Virumaandi agrees to turn to tell his version to Angela. Virumaandi, 25, a manual laborer, was sent back to home from Singapore for taking responsibility for his cousin's fault. His only relation was his grandmother, who practices natural farming without artificial fertilizers and deep bore wells. Kothala had a silent eye on the fertile land owned by Virumaandi, as it had the only rich underground water availability. He treats Virumaandi as his nephew. Virumaandi falls in love with Annalakshmi after he tames her very stubborn bull at jallikattu. That night, his grandmother passes away, and two days later, an attempt is made on Virumaandi's life. Annalakshmi finds him and admits him in the hospital to save his life. Gradually, she falls in love with him. She teaches him the importance of apology and forgiveness, which are virtues. A clash at the peace Panchayat insults Kothala's gang, and their need for revenge infuriates Annalakshmi, who asks Virumaandi to apologize to the elders whom he insulted. He goes to apologize single-handedly at night to Naicker's village, but Kothala and his men, thinking he has gone to take revenge, come in groups and hack down innocents to death, despite his pleas. Kothala uses his clout to get out of the murder charge, but Virumaandi, who was involved in the bloodbath, is disturbed because he had to lie in the court to save Kothala and his kin. As part of the penance, he wills all his land for the villagers. Annalakshmi asks him to marry her and leave the village. He marries her at the village temple, goes away at night with her, and stays with his aunt, whose son he helped. They consummate their marriage that night. Kothala's men come the next day, when Virumaandi was away, and abduct Annalakshmi, taking her home. Kothala and his gang forcibly get her married again, to Kothala's nephew Kottaisamy (O. A. K. Sundar). This is to ensure that Annalakshmi's share in property does not go to Virumaandi. Kottaisamy is then asked by Kothala to consummate his marriage immediately by raping Annalakshmi. Unable to tolerate, Annalakshmi commits suicide by hanging herself. Upon hearing the news, a distraught Virumaandi enters Kothala's house to kill the gang. He takes revenge by hacking Kothala's four men, including Kottaisamy, to death but finds Kothala holding his own son upside down on a staircase. Virumaandi places his weapon down, and Kothala escapes. Naicker shelters Virumaandi and sends him off to Chennai. Kothala and his men corner Naicker to hand over Virumaandi. A melee ensues in which Naicker is killed. Virumaandi turns up in court, where he finds that all evidence is framed against him. He is convicted of having raped Annalakshmi and killing her and later on being the main reason for killing the four relatives of Kothala, and also the main accused for the murder of 26 lives in Naicker's village. He is sentenced to first six years in jail, followed by death by hanging. While leaving the jail, Angela's cameraman discreetly shoots a conversation between Peykkaman and other jail wardens and convicts to bump off Chief Jailer Jayanth (Nassar). This is because all of them trafficks drugs into the prison, and this is now under investigation by Jayanth. Peykkaman also reveals that Virumaandi never killed anyone, but his charge sheet got him a death sentence. A revolt among the jail staff leads to a jailbreak, as Jayanth gets stabbed and Virumaandi saves the vital evidence and Angela from Peykkaman and his henchmen. When Virumaandi and Angela are about to leave the jail to outside police, Kothala stabs Virumaandi, proving that Virumaandi was true all the time. Virumaandi then barehandedly kills Kothala, and they escape. The riot is stopped, and Angela presents the evidence in court. Angela applies for Virumaandi's clemency to the President of India, stating that the six-year prison sentence is enough as he did not commit any other offence, and to release him immediately. Virumaandi, on TV, pleas for a quick judgement, either to reach Annalakshmi by hanging to death or to live life as a silent man, seeking retribution. Finally, an epilogue denotes a note that the death sentence should be abolished.

An uncontested single-winner election is one where there is only one candidate. In some uncontested elections, the normal process, of voters casting ballots and election official counting votes, is cancelled as superfluous and costly; in other cases the election proceeds as a formality. There are some election systems where absence of opposing candidates may not guarantee victory; possible factors are a quorum or minimum voter turnout; a none of the above option; or ability write-in candidates on the ballot. Preventing automatic election Running without opponents is not always a guarantee of winning. Many elections require that the winner has not only the most votes of all candidates, but also either a minimum number of votes or minimum fraction of votes cast, which may apply if many voters cast blank votes or spoiled votes. If elections require a minimum voter turnout, then abstention may likewise invalidate the election and trigger a fresh election. Some elections allow a \\"none of the above\\" option for the same purpose, and some allow voters to add write-in candidates to the ballot, so the pre-printed candidate is not truly uncontested. In the Philippines, the sole candidate in an uncontested election must have at least one vote in order to win the seat; this is also true in general elections in the United States. There are cases in local government races where the sole candidate on the ballot finished with zero votes and thus have lost an uncontested election; this is because almost all U.S. government seats require candidates to reside in the municipality they seek to represent, and means the candidate themselves must, usually out of forgetfulness or lack of time on election day, fail to vote for themselves. In such cases, the other members of the body usually appoint someone to the vacant seat. This is does not apply in primary elections: if only one candidate qualifies for a party's nomination, the primary is scratched and the candidate is declared nominated. Single- winner elections An uncontested single-winner election may be termed a walkover, a term originating in horse racing. Election walkovers are called acclamation in Canada. In Communist countries, elections have often involved a single candidate of the ruling Communist Party; compulsory voting for such candidates gives reinforces the party's hegemony. In illiberal democracy, walkovers may be a suspicious sign of electoral fraud, or gerrymandering to prevent other candidates from participating. In a two-party system, a walkover may be the sign of a very strong mandate or unanimous support. Sometimes an opposing party will nominate a paper candidate to provide nominal opposition, or the opposition boycotts the election and a ruling party supporter provides a paper opponent to prevent a walkover, as in four Northern Ireland by- elections in 1986. Many liberal democracies in history, including the United States, have had uncontested elections because support for one candidate was so strong. In the United States presidential elections of 1788-89 and 1792, George Washington ran uncontested for President, though in the latter election the ballot for the Vice President was contested by both Federalists and Democratic-Republicans. In the 1820 election, James Monroe also ran unopposed, though New Hampshire elector William Plumer cast a vote for John Quincy Adams as a symbolic measure. In the UK House of Commons, the outgoing Speaker's constituency was traditionally not contested until the 1960s, as a symbol of the Speaker's political neutrality. Otherwise, the last uncontested Commons elections were in four Northern Ireland constituencies with large Ulster Unionist Party majorities, in the 1951 United Kingdom general election and ensuing by-elections. During the World Wars, many by-elections were uncontested, with the candidate of the outgoing MP's party winning by default. This was both a cost-saving emergency measure at a time of war coalition government, and a gesture of solidarity if the by-election was triggered by a war-related death. Multi-party systems that have held uncontested presidential elections include Germany, Singapore, Ireland, Algeria, Iceland, and Zimbabwe. =Non-party elections= In civic organisations and civic societies, where personal charisma and personal politics often dominate, while parties or factions are often interested in a seat, they may not contest a seat that is being held by a long-standing or very popular individual, for fear of being seen as \\"rocking the boat\\". In elections for these societies, there is often \\"pre-election politics\\" where candidates attempt to figure out who is running for which positions; in this cat and mouse game, elected positions are thus often effectively decided by internal politics before a single vote is cast. Multiple-winner elections Irish town councils were elected from 1919 to 2009 by single transferable vote; in many cases the entire town formed a single nine-seat local electoral area. Where there were nine or fewer candidates, no election contest was held and all eligible candidates deemed elected without a vote. This happened in 1960 in three urban districts and six towns with commissioners.

Under the Bourbons, the G√¢tinais had already been divided between the provinces of √éle-de-France and Orl√©ans. In the words of the modern tourist slogan for the \\"two G√¢tinais\\", it lies between the Seine and the Loire. Under the Franks, G√¢tinais was the pagus Wastinensis (eventually to become Wasteney in the 20th Century), (or Vastinensis) one of five belonging to the Archbishop of Sens. The west part of Puisaye and the archbishop's other fiefs in the northwest of the modern department of Yonne, west of that river, are also often considered part of G√¢tinais; as is the area around √âtampes in the present department of Essonne. Around the 10th century, the main town of this province was Ch√¢teau-Landon, and a twenty-five mile circle around Notre- Dame de Ch√¢teau-Landon basically comprised it. The western part, G√¢tinais orl√©anais, approximately corresponds to the arrondissements of Montargis and a large part of Pithiviers, in Loiret. Pithiviers has for several centuries been the most representative town of G√¢tinais. The eastern part, G√¢tinais fran√ßais, had Nemours as its chief town, and corresponds to the arrondissement of Fontainebleau in Seine-et-Marne. This is an essentially agricultural area, although the west is wooded. It was for several centuries known for its saffron, a crop that disappeared from this area because of the heavy charges on human work and the impossibility to mechanise this particular crop; these days saffron makes a timid reappearance in the local fields under the impulse of natural regional park of G√¢tinais fran√ßais.

After scoring 9 in his d√©but ODI match against Zimbabwe, Chattergoon made an unbeaten 54 in his second game, helping the West Indies to a ten-wicket victory; his batting partner, Chris Gayle, made 95 not out in the opening stand of 156.

He impressed with fluent knocks of 34, 52 and 48 in the three innings whilst opening the batting. He clocked up 134 runs in that series, proving his skills at the highest level and has answered the WICB selectors call for an opening partner for Chris Gayle. After making his test d√©but for the West Indies against a formidable Sri Lankan team at the Queens Park Oval in Trinidad, he made a statement by starting his test career with an impressive but patient and technically correct innings of 46. This particular innings showed great potential for the long sought after opening batsman the West Indies have craved for a number of years now. In his first Test match he demonstrated the technical ability comparable to that of Greenidge and Haynes. His classy left- handed style of batting combined with his solid defensive technique accounts for a great opening batsman in the making. As well as his batting, Chattergoon has showed extraordinary ability in his slip fielding, somewhat incomparable to those previous players in the similar position by taking a spectacular catch at third slip in the first innings of his d√©but Test match. Other achievements in domestic cricket includes the 119 he hit in the final of the 2005‚Äì06 KFC Cup, the regional one-day tournament of the West Indies, out of a total 247 for 7 to help Guyana beat Barbados by three wickets and win the title.Chattergoon leads Guyana to title triumph, from the Trinidad and Tobago Express, published by Cricinfo on 17 October 2005  External links  *  Notes  Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:Guyanese cricketers Category:West Indies One Day International cricketers Category:West Indies Test cricketers Category:Guyana cricketers Category:Indo-Guyanese people Category:Guyanese Hindus ","title":"Sewnarine Chattergoon"},{"id":"5051503","text":"Wonder Boy, is the name of two fictional characters who have appeared as superheroes in comics published by Quality Comics and DC Comics. The original was an alien who appeared in National Comics. The second was a time-traveler from an alternate future who appeared in Team Titans.  History  As most of the stories with him in them were only six pages long there was never much revealed about him other than that he was known for: having the strength of a thousand men, a girl friend named Sally Benson and a tendency for bombastic speeches. Deciding to help the people of Earth fight crime and evil (most specifically Hitler) his first act shortly after getting out the meteor and hearing about Hitler was to swim to Europe and bash a few fascists, he was soon called Wonder Boy by the public at large, otherwise he had no other name or a secret identity, and apparently never wore anything but the costume he was ‚Äúborn‚Äù wearing. Quality Comics Wonder Boy was a fictional Quality Comics character and superhero who first appeared in National Comics #1 (July 1940), in the story \\"The Boy from the Meteor\\". The character was created by writer Toni Blum and artist John Celardo.Wonder Boy at Don Markstein's Toonopedia With \\"the strength of a hundred full grown men\\", the nameless Wonder Boy fell to Earth from the planet Viro, destroyed when it \\"collided\\" with a star. Finding himself in Chicago, Illinois, he joined forces with Sgt. Crane of the Army Air Corps and began using his superhuman abilities to fight the Nazis, Axis spies and big-city crime. Cheering him on from the sidelines was sweetheart Sally Benson, an earth girl. Wonder Boy last appeared under the Quality Comics banner in National Comics #26 (November 1942), in an untitled story. The character reappeared two years later in Elliot Publishing Co's Bomber Comics (along with several other characters that originally appeared in National Comics). The circumstances behind the move are unclear. In 1955, he was one of the characters to be used by Ajax-Farrell Comics in Terrific Comics #16 and Wonder Boy #17 and 18.

In the 16th century it was recorded as Greenfield but the Welsh language name Maesglas has remained the more widely used, among English speakers. It is located in the Gaer ward directly north of the A48 Southern Distributor Road, south of Cardiff Road and south west of the South Wales Main Line railway. The Newport-born author Leslie Thomas wrote of Maesglas: This quote is incorporated into a mural telling the history of the estate painted on the side of the Maesglas shops . Housing The main housing estate was first built in the 1930s, then many newer houses were added between the 1970s and 1990s in the Bideford Road area, next to the Great Western Main Line. Homes on the Maesglas estate are fairly compact but all have front and back gardens. Most of the houses are terraced but are arranged in all sorts of different rows and shapes of street, due to being built in the suburbs and having more room to build wider roads. A significant percentage of the houses are council-owned. In the centre of the estate, there are two schools: Maesglas primary school and Maes-Ebbw School for older students with severe learning difficulties. The nearest Highschools in the area are St. Josephs (Roman Catholic) and Duffryn High School which is attended by most teenagers of the estate. Semi-detached houses either side of Cardiff Road, St. Bride's Gardens next to the Ebbw River and the small estate (St David's Crescent) next to St. David's R.C. primary school, are also \\"sometimes\\" considered to be part of Maesglas. Facilities Maesglas is surrounded by several retail parks including the Harlech Retail Park, Maesglas Retail Park and 28 East Retail Park. Maesglas is also home to the headquarters of the Monmouthshire region's local newspaper: the South Wales Argus. South-east of the railway line lies the Maesglas Industrial Estate, although this is actually in the Pill ward. Both the Maesglas estate and the nearby Gaer estate are Communities First areas of Newport, recognised as being high on the index of multiple deprivation used by the Welsh Assembly to establish the poverty of an area. Maesglas has benefited hugely since the beginning of the scheme. Maesglas has many recreational areas nearby such as Tredegar Park as well as football field in the grounds of the Maesglas Primary school. It is surrounded by history as Maesglas is close to Tredegar House of the famous Morgan family. Maesglas is said to have an ancient burial ground towards the back of the estate next to the children's playground. Maesglas school is built over a castle and grounds. A new suburban railway station will be built to serve Maesglas within the next few years. Politics The estate is the sub-ward of the Gaer ward of Newport City Council, which elects three councillors for a four-year term. The Current Councillors for the Gaer ward as of May 2017 -2022 are Mark Whitcutt, Debbie Wilcox and Stephen Marshall.

J Oral Maxillofac Surg 2005;63:1693-1707 (also termed sinus lift, sinus graft, sinus augmentation or sinus procedure) is a surgical procedure which aims to increase the amount of bone in the posterior maxilla (upper jaw bone), in the area of the premolar and molar teeth, by lifting the lower Schneiderian membrane (sinus membrane) and placing a bone graft.http://www.colgate.com/en/us/oc/oral-health/cosmetic- dentistry/implants/article/sinus-lift When a tooth is lost the alveolar process begins to remodel. The vacant tooth socket collapses as it heals leaving an edentulous (toothless) area, termed a ridge. This collapse causes a loss in both height and width of the surrounding bone. In addition, when a maxillary molar or premolar is lost, the maxillary sinus pneumatizes in this region which further diminishes the thickness of the underlying bone. Overall, this leads to a loss in volume of bone that is available for implantation of dental implants, which rely on osseointegration (bone integration), to replace missing teeth. The goal of the sinus lift is to graft extra bone into the maxillary sinus, so more bone is available to support a dental implant. Indications While there may be a number of reasons for wanting a greater volume of bone in the posterior maxilla, the most common reason in contemporary dental treatment planning is to prepare the site for the future placement of dental implants. Sinus augmentation (sinus lift) is performed when the floor of the sinus is too close to an area where dental implants are to be placed. This procedure is performed to ensure a secure place for the implants while protecting the sinus. Lowering of the sinus can be caused by: Long-term tooth loss without the required treatment, periodontal disease, trauma. Patients who have the following may be good candidates for sinus augmentation. * Lost more than one tooth in the posterior maxilla. * Lost a significant amount of bone in the posterior maxilla. * Missing teeth due to genetics or birth defect. * Minus most of the maxillary teeth and need a strong sinus floor for multiple implants. It is not known if using sinus lift techniques is more successful than using short implants for reducing the number of artificial teeth or dental implant failures up to a year after teeth/implant placement. Technique 1) Edentulous area of two missing teeth is being prepared for future placement of dental implants with a lateral window sinus lift; incisions into the soft tissue are shown here. 2) The soft tissue is flapped back to expose the underlying lateral wall of the left maxillary sinus. 3) The bone has been removed with a piezoelectric instrument, exposing the underlying Schneiderian membrane, which is the lining of the maxillary sinus cavity. 4) Through careful instrumentation, the membrane is carefully peeled from the inner aspect of the sinus cavity. 5) The membrane has been reflected from the internal aspect of the inferior portion of the sinus cavity; one can now visualize the bony floor of the sinus cavity without its lining membrane (note the triangular ridge of bone within the sinus, known as an Underwood's septum). 6) The newly formed space within the bony cavity of the sinus yet inferior to the intact membrane is grafted with human cadaver allograft bone. The floor of the sinus will now be roughly 10mm or so more superior than it was before, providing enough room to place dental implants into the edentulous site. Prior to undergoing sinus augmentation, diagnostics are run to determine the health of the patient's sinuses. Panoramic radiographs are taken to map out the patient's upper jaw and sinuses. In special instances, Cone beam computed tomography is preferable to measure the sinus's height and width, and to rule out any sinus disease or pathology. There are several variations of the sinus lift technique. = Traditional Sinus Augmentation or Lateral Window Technique = There are multiple ways to perform sinus augmentation. The procedure is performed from inside the patient's mouth where the surgeon makes an incision into the gum, or gingiva. Once the incision is made, the surgeon then pulls back the gum tissue, exposing the lateral boney wall of the sinus. The surgeon then cuts a \\"window\\" to the sinus, which is exposing the Schneiderian membrane. The membrane is separated from the bone, and bone graft material is placed into the newly created space. The gums are then sutured close and the graft is left to heal for 4‚Äì12 months. The graft material used can be either an autograft, an allograft, a xenograft, an alloplast (a growth-factor infused collagen matrix), synthetic variants, or combinations thereof. Studies indicate that the mere lifting of the sinus membrane, creation of a void space and blood clot formation might result in new bone owing to the principles of guided bone regeneration. The long-term prognosis for the technique is estimated to 94%. = Osteotome Technique = As an alternative, sinus augmentation can be performed by a less invasive osteotome technique. There are several variations of this technique and all originate from the original technique of Dr. Tatum, first published by Dr.s Boyne and James in 1980. Dr. Robert B. Summers described a technique that is normally performed when the sinus floor that needs to be lifted is less than 4 mm. This technique is performed by flapping back gum tissue and making a socket in the bone within 1‚Äì2 mm short of the sinus membrane. The floor of the sinus is then lifted by tapping the sinus floor with the use of osteotomes. The amount of augmentation achieved with the osteotome technique is usually less than what can be achieved with the lateral window technique. A dental implant is normally placed in the socket formed at the time of the sinus lift procedure and left to integrate with bone. Bone integration normally lasts 4 to 8 months. The goal of this procedure is to stimulate bone growth and form a thicker sinus floor, in order to support dental implants for teeth replacement. Sinus dimensions and shape significantly influence new bone formation after transcrestal sinus floor elevation: with this technique, the regeneration of a substantial amount of new bone is a predictable outcome only in narrow sinus cavities. During presurgical planning, bucco- palatal sinus width should be regarded as a crucial parameter when choosing sinus floor elevation with transcrestal approach as a treatment option. Dr. Bruschi and Scipioni described a similar technique (Localized Management of Sinus Floor or L.M.S.F.) that is based on a partial thickness flap procedure. This technique increases the malleability of the crestal bone and uses not the bone directly below the sinus, but rather the bone on the medial wall, and thus can be used in more extreme cases of bone resorption that would normally need to be treated with the lateral wall technique. The healing period is reduced to 1.5 to 3 months. Recently an electrical mallet has been introduced to simplify the application of this and similar techniques. Complications A major risk of a sinus augmentation is that the sinus membrane could be pierced or ripped. Remedies, should this occur, include stitching the tear or placing a patch over it; in some cases, the surgery is stopped altogether and the tear is given time to heal, usually three to six months. Often, the sinus membrane grows back thicker and stronger, making success more likely on the second operation. Although rarely reported, such secondary intervention can also be successful when the primary surgery is limited to elevation of the membrane without the insertion of additional material. Besides tearing of the sinus membrane, there are other risks involved in sinus augmentation surgery. Most notably, the close relationship of the augmentation site with the sinonasal complex can induce sinusitis, which may chronicize and cause severe symptoms. Sinusitis resulting from maxillary sinus augmentation is considered a Class 1 sinonasal complication according to Felisati classification and should be addressed surgically with a combined endoscopic endonasal and endoral approach. Beside sinusitis, among other procedure related-risks include: infection, inflammation, pain, itching, allergic reaction, tissue or nerve damage, scar formation, hematoma, graft failure, oro-antral communication / oro-antral fistula, tilting or loosening of implants, or bleeding, Recovery It takes about three to six months for the sinus augmentation bone to become part of the patient's natural sinus floor bone. Up to six months of healing is sometimes left before implants are attempted. However, some surgeons perform both the augmentation and dental implant simultaneously, to avoid the necessity of two surgeries. History The first maxillary sinus floor augmentation procedure was performed by Oscar Hilt Tatum, Jr. in 1974. A sinus-lift procedure was first performed by Dr. Hilt Tatum Jr. in 1974 during his period of preparation to begin sinus grafting. The first sinus graft was done by Tatum in February, 1975 in Lee County Hospital in Opelika, Alabama. This was followed by the placement and successful restoration of two endosteal implants. Between 1975‚Äì1979, much of the sinus lining elevation was done using inflatable catheters. After this, suitable instruments had been developed to manage the lining elevation from the different anatomical surfaces encountered in sinuses. Tatum first presented the concept at The Alabama Implant Congress in Birmingham, Alabama in 1976 and presented the evolution of technique during multiple podium presentations each year until 1986 when he published an article describing the procedure. Dr. Philip Boyne was introduced to the procedure when he was invited, by Tatum, to be \\"The Discusser\\" of a presentation on sinus grafting given by Tatum at the annual meeting of The American Academy of Implant Dentistry in 1977 or 1978. Boyne and James authored the first publication on the technique in 1980 when they published case reports of autogenous grafts placed into the sinus and allowed to heal for 6 months, which was followed by the placement of blade implants. This sequence was confirmed by Boyne before the attendees at The Alabama Implant Congress in 1994. Cost-effectiveness The slightly higher effectiveness (implant survival) of the lateral sinus lift technique needs to be considered in relation to the substantially higher costs in comparison with the transalveolar sinus lift technique. From a patient perspective the higher invasiveness of the lateral technique will also be an important decision criterion. However, the transalveolar approach is unlikely to be effective in cases of advanced levels of bone reduction at the implant site. References     Lazzara RJ.

A contract was signed between the Greek State and AEK Athens FC and all the details of the project were finalised. Capacity and other facilities The stadium would have a capacity of at least 50,000 spectators according to chairman Demis Nikolaidis and it would fulfill all the UEFA criteria in order to be regarded a 5-star venue. It would also feature a shopping mall of around 50,000 square metres, a multiplex cinema and numerous cafes and restaurants. Stadium naming The name \\"AEK Arena\\" would not be the official name of the future stadium, it is just the temporary name of the project. Although, it was likely that the stadium was finally named AEK Arena even though a name like \\"New Nikos Goumas Stadium\\" is more likely to be chosen. Last but not least, it is very possible the stadium to be named after a sponsorship deal 'LG Stadium/LG Arena. Cancellation The stadium was cancelled due to financial problems of the club and negative reaction from the fans.

His greatest importance lies in his work as a transcriber, arranger, and copyist of a wide variety of music. Life Little is known of John Reading's early life. He was probably the son of the composer and organist John Reading (c. 1645‚Äì1692) who from 1681 until his death was organist and Master of the Choristers at Winchester College. The younger Reading received the best possible musical training, being a chorister of the Chapel Royal, where he was taught by John Blow. He would almost certainly have sung at the funerals of Henry Purcell and Queen Mary. It was tradition, when the choristers' voices broke, for the Chapel Royal to find them their first appointment. Reading was placed as organist at Dulwich College, a position he held for two years (1700‚Äì1702), after which he moved to Lincoln Cathedral, becoming Master of the Choristers there in 1703, a post that his father had previously held. By 1708 he was organist of St John's, Hackney in London, a position he held for some 20 years. This was a church with a strong musical tradition, and one of the first to be furnished with an organ after the Restoration. In 1727 he became organist of the combined churches of St Mary Woolnoth and St Mary Woolchurch Haw in the City of London. In addition he took up the post of organist at St Dunstan's-in-the-West. He was an early member of the Royal Society of Musicians. He died in London. His portrait hangs in the Dulwich College Art Gallery. Historical importance Reading was a notable organist, composer and teacher, but his great contribution to music lies in his activities as a copyist. He lived at a time when musical taste was evolving quickly. The development of English organ music lagged a long way behind that of the continent, but the Fantasy and the Voluntary were popular forms, and were becoming strongly influenced by the Italian style of Vivaldi and Corelli whilst the sound of the English organ was being influenced by the sound of the reeds in French organs. These changes in style were obviously reflected in the organ playing of Reading, because in 1719 a representation was made to him while organist of the Church of St John-at-Hackney about \\"irregularities relating to the execution of his Office as Organist of this Parish, and particularly for playing the Voluntary too long, and using persistently too light, Airy and Jyggy Tunes, no ways proper to raise the Devotion Suitable for a Religious Assembly.\\" Reading's playing was showing his admiration for the Italian style. In the preface to his A Book of New Songs (1710) he writes of the Italian influence in opera houses in London that \\"our English composers might be inspired with ye utmost delicacy of a Roman Genius.\\" Although Reading promised to \\"amend\\" he was eventually dismissed from his post in Hackney. Reading must have retained great affection for Dulwich College where he had had his first post, for he donated 12 volumes of his music which he had collected, transcribed and arranged. These volumes, now in the archives in Dulwich, are an important source of English organ music. They also contain psalm settings, harpsichord music and verse anthems which he had arranged for unison voices. His transcriptions are accurate, and his attributions are reliable. However, he sometimes \\"improved\\" upon pieces as he copied them, adding octaves in the bass. He saw the sections of a voluntary as interchangeable, sometimes indicating after an introduction: \\"follow this with any fugue\\". The manuscripts often have detailed registration marks, with first movements played on diapasons and second voluntaries marked \\"Full Organ\\", followed by a fugue for full organ. Most of his compositions have a seriousness of purposefar from the frivolity suggested by the reaction of the congregation in Hackney.

The museum shows exhibits of natural history subjects, with an emphasis on Utah and the Intermountain West. The mission of the museum is to illuminate the natural world and the place of humans within it. A new building, named the Rio Tinto Center, opened in November 2011. The museum is part of the University of Utah and is located in the University's Research Park. History The museum was conceived in 1959, when the University of Utah faculty committee decided to consolidate natural history collections from around its campus. The museum was established as the Utah Museum of Natural History on the University of Utah campus in 1963 by the Utah State Legislature. In 1969, the museum opened in the former George Thomas Library and included specimens from the Deseret Museum, as well as from the Charles Nettleton Strevell Museum that was located in the old Lafayette School on South Temple Street from 1939 until 1947. The paleontology collections acquired a very important amount of new collected specimens during the 1960s, particularly fossilized remains of dinosaurs. It all began when a young local paleontologist called James Henry Madsen Jr. obtained his Master of Science in 1959 in the University of Utah. The following year, as of 1960, Madsen was hired as an assistant for Professor William Lee Stokes of the Princeton University, who at that time performed the dauntless project to extensively dig the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry. Since the 1920s, it had been firmly established by geologists that this quarry is one of the most important paleontological sites ever found in the United States, and still in the early 1960s literally tens of thousands of disarticulated dinosaur bones were buried in the rock, awaiting to be excavated. Because the bone bed was so vast and contained a so huge quantity of fossilized bones (mainly from Allosaurus fragilis), it seemed obvious to Stokes and Madsen that it was literally impossible for a single unique institution to dig up a number of specimens being realistically representative of the overall total. To accomplish this task, or at least a reasonable part of it, Stokes and Madsen founded the \\"University of Utah Cooperative Dinosaur Project\\",James Henry Madsen Jr., Allosaurus fragilis: A Revised Osteology, Bulletin 109, Utah Geological Survey (a division of Utah Department of Natural Resources), printed August 1976, reprinted 1993. thanks to initial funds allowed by the University of Utah and its Department of Geology. The project worked for 16 years in close collaboration not only with museums and institutions within the USA, but also with prestigious international museums and research centers. Since financial assistance was brought by all the institutions who had participated in the project, the Dinosaur Project granted them casts or even original composite specimens of the dinosaurs found in the quarry. In the running time of the \\"Cooperative Dinosaur Project\\" (from 1960 to 1976), literally tons of fossilized bones were dug up from the quarry, numerous remains of species as famous as Camarasaurus, Camptosaurus, Ceratosaurus, Stegosaurus, and, of course, Allosaurus, among others (Allosaurus is by far the most represented species, with 44-46 individuals found). In addition to these already known species, two new species were discovered and named: Stokesosaurus (in 1974); and Marshosaurus (in 1976); both of whose holotypes are preciously preserved in the Natural History Museum of Utah. In 1976, the University of Utah stopped the \\"Cooperative Dinosaur Project\\". To continue financing his research, Madsen founded Dinolab, a company that cast and sold skeletons of dinosaurs to museums, institutions, or private buyers. Madsen died in 2009 and Dinolab disappeared in 2014, but thanks to the \\"University of Utah Cooperative Dinosaur Project\\" and Madsen's excavations in the Cleveland-Lloyd Dinosaur Quarry back in the 1960s and 1970s, the Natural History Museum of Utah now is able to display the largest collection in the world of Allosaurus skeletons, among some additional dinosaur skeletal mounts belonging to other species. In 1963, Dr. Jesse D. Jennings, a professor and archaeologist, was appointed director of the museum. The \\"Utah Museum of Natural History\\" opened to the public in 1969. Jennings was the director for 10 years.https://nhmu.utah.edu/newsdesk/kits/come-discover-natural-history- museum-utah-rio-tinto-center In 1973, Don Hague, the museum's curator and first paid employee became the director. Hague led the museum for nearly 20 years, retiring in 1992.http://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=3182257&itype;=CMSID&fullpage;=1 Since 1992, Dr. Sarah George has been the director of the museum.https://nhmu.utah.edu/newsdesk/experts/sarah-george In 2011, the museum moved from the old George Thomas Library location at 1390 Presidents Circle into the Rio Tinto Center, in the University of Utah's Research Park 301 Wakara Way, Salt Lake City. The move also resulted in a change of name to the Natural History Museum of Utah. The Rio Tinto Center is a building set on a campus in the foothills of the Wasatch Mountains. The building's highest point is a round structure on the back or east side which houses the Native Voices gallery. The architects for the building were Ennead Architects from New York City and GSBS of Salt Lake City. Ralph Appelbaum Associates designed the exhibits. Collections and research The Natural History Museum of Utah has more than 1.6 million objects in its collection that are used for research and education. The Museum's collections emphasize the natural history of Utah and are accessible to researchers from around the world. The majority of the collections are from public lands within the inter-mountain region of the United States. Collections are used in studies on geological, biological, and cultural diversity, as well as the history of living systems and human cultures within the Utah region. The goal of the museum is to increase the collections while providing the widest possible access to that information. =Anthropology= The collection features one million objects related to anthropology. * Archaeological collections of approximately 750,000 objects * Associated records from more than 3,800 sites * Ethnographic collections including more than 2,000 objects The curator of anthropology is Duncan Metcalfe, and the collections manager is Glenna Nielsen-Grimm. =Paleontology= The paleontology collection includes 12,000 vertebrates, 4,000 invertebrates, and 7,000 plants. =Entomology= The entomology collection includes 140,000 specimens. =Vertebrate zoology= The collection related to vertebrate zoology includes 30,000 mammals, 20,000 birds, and 18,000 reptiles. =Mineralogy= The mineralogy collection includes 3,700 minerals. =Botany= The botany collection includes 123,000 specimens. =Malacology= The malacology collection includes 25,000 specimens. Permanent exhibitions The Museum has ten permanent exhibitions: * Past Worlds * Great Salt Lake * Life * Land * First Peoples * Gems and Minerals * Native Voices * Sky * Our Backyard * Utah Futures =Special exhibitions= The Museum houses a special exhibition gallery with rotating special exhibitions. Educational programs The educational programs are organized by the School Programs Department. Development of school programs is closely tied to the public school system's core curriculum. The museum's educational programs include: * School Tours: The program includes self-guided groups moving among demonstration carts throughout the galleries. * Junior Science Academy: Workshops for fourth grade students tied to the core curriculum and held in the museum. * Youth programs: After-school, Saturday, and summer classes primarily for children in grades K-6, covering natural history and science. * Adult and family programs: Workshops, lectures, and special events intended for an adult and/or family audience in geology, archeology, and biology. * Youth Teaching Youth: A program with Glendale Middle School; youth from at-risk environments are trained to instruct elementary school classes using outreach kits. These middle school youth conduct all classroom outreach in the Salt Lake School District. As these students graduate to high school, they are offered internships in disciplines at the museum and throughout the university. Outreach Outreach efforts include: * Museum on the Move: A total of 12 kits containing specimens and activities are presented by Museum educators in schools statewide. The kits use natural history topics to allow students to build science process skills and are tied to science core curriculum standards. Topics addressed by the kits include rocks and minerals, fossils, Utah animals, and Great Salt Lake. * Field Crates * Traveling Treasures * Teaching Toolboxes * Teachers are able to check boxes out for 2 weeks at a time * Scientist in the Classroom Role at the University of Utah The museum is part of the academic life of the University of Utah. The collections offer research opportunities and provide a learning laboratory for students. Museum programs expose students to many aspects of museum studies: educational outreach, exhibit design and fabrication development, public relations, and curriculum development. The museum is a repository for collections that were accumulated by the university's departments of Anthropology, Biology, and Geology. The collections are held in trust for faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates who have access to the collections for research and teaching purposes. In-service training is offered by the Utah Museum of Natural History Education Department; university credit can be earned with these courses, leading to salary lane changes for public school teachers. These courses are coordinated with the Academic Outreach and Continuing Education and the Department of Teaching and Learning. As the founder of the University's Genetic Science Learning Center, the museum continues to partner in its teacher training program. The museum meeting rooms are available for rental for on- and off-campus groups.

Now, the ISSA is organized into seven District Associations within ISSA that schedule and administer regattas within their established regions: * New England Schools Sailing Association * Middle Atlantic Scholastic Sailing Association * South Atlantic Inter- Scholastic Sailing Association * South East Inter-Scholastic Sailing Association * Midwest Inter-Scholastic Sailing Association * Northwest Inter- Scholastic Sailing Association * Pacific Coast Inter-Scholastic Sailing Association Individual schools are also responsible for scheduling dual meets and team-racing events. Although there are over 350 high schools across the United States that field varsity sailing teams, relatively few of these schools own their own boats. Instead, most schools have established partnerships with community sailing organizations, colleges, or yacht clubs in order to gain access to a fleet of boats. Additionally, most high school sailing teams are involved with fundraising. Many high school sailors go on to participate in college sailing (governed by the Intercollegiate Sailing Association). Both college varsity teams (such as Yale University) and club teams (such as the Vanderbilt Sailing Club) recruit high school sailors. The ISSA partners with Vanguard Sailboats to help sponsor its national regattas.

In 2014, The Red Mile announced it was partnering with Keeneland to build a $30 million historical racing facility, with 1,000 terminals, scheduled to open September 2015. In May 2015, Keeneland also announced that it would move most of its Off-track betting operations to The Red Mile beginning July 15, 2015, investing over $2 million upgrading The Red Mile's grandstand area. Facilities The race track itself is one mile long and made of red clay, which gives the track its name. In addition to the race track, The Red Mile features a two-story clubhouse, a round barn, and a park. The clubhouse is often used for weddings, parties, and other gatherings. The Tattersalls area can accommodate large groups and is often used for horse sales. History KY Trotting Assoc, 1898 The track was founded on September 28, 1875 and was sponsored by the Kentucky Trotting Horse Breeders Association. Attendance to the opening races was minimal because the track had not been advertised. Once newspapers published articles about the new track, attendance picked up. The track is the second-oldest harness racing track in the world and the oldest horse racing track in Lexington.

In Greek grammar, it is also called the alpha declension, since its forms have the letter Œ±, at least in the plural. In Latin and Greek grammar, the first declension is analyzed as a thematic declension. But its lack of a Proto-Indo-European thematic vowel (o or e) and of any nominative singular ending (ordinarily -s or -os) doesn't neatly place it within either of the Proto-Indo-European nominal categories, thematic and athematic. Therefore, it is assumed to be a newer formation: a suffix based on the neuter plural ending *-(e)h‚ÇÇ, forming a collective noun. Latin =Latin nouns and adjectives= Latin first declension has only one set of endings for both feminine and masculine nouns. The very small native masculine group includes only a few occupation nouns and nouns imported from the Greek masculine first declension. *agricola \\"farmer\\" ‚Üê ager, agro- \\"field\\" and root of col≈ç \\"I cultivate\\" * poƒìta \\"poet\\" ‚Üê œÄŒøŒπŒ∑œÑŒÆœÇ poiƒìtƒìs \\"one who composes\\" poetry * pƒ´rƒÅta \\"pirate\\" ‚Üê œÄŒµŒπœÅ·æ±œÑŒÆœÇ peirƒÅtƒìs \\"one who makes an attempt on\\" someone * aurƒ´ga \\"charioteer\\" ‚Üê aurea \\"horse's bridle\\" and ag≈ç \\"I do, lead, drive\\" The same endings are used for the feminine gender of Latin adjectives. Ancient Greek =Greek nouns= Greek first declension has two basic classes of feminine endings and one basic class of masculine endings, distinguished by their original nominative singular: long -ƒÅ, short -(y)ƒÉ, long -ƒÅs. But besides the nominative and accusative singular of feminines, and nominative, genitive, and vocative singular of masculines, forms are the same between subclasses. In the Attic dialect, an ƒÅ-ƒì split divides each class into two subclasses: nouns with ·æ± and nouns with Œ∑. By contrast, other dialects tend to generalize the vowel one way or the other ‚Äî Ionic has only ƒì, and Doric and Aeolic have only ƒÅ. =Greek adjectives= The feminine of first- and second-declension adjectives uses the -ƒÅ class of the first declension: * -os, -ƒÅ/ƒì, -on First- and third-declension adjectives, including participles in -nt-, use the -(y)ƒÉ class. Here are examples of this class, which is complex because of sound changes involving the y (see Ancient Greek nouns: short a): *-us, -eia, -u *-ƒÅs, -aina, -an *-≈çn, -ousa, -on *-ƒÅs, -ƒÅsa, -an *-eis, -eisa, -en See also * For specific information on the first declension as it appears in Latin and Greek, see the appropriate sections in Latin declension and Ancient Greek nouns. References 1 1 ","title":"First declension"},{"id":"5051642","text":"The second declension is a category of nouns in Latin and Greek with similar case formation. In particular, these nouns are thematic, with an original o in most of their forms. In Classical Latin, the short o of the nominative and accusative singular became u. Both Latin and Greek have two basic classes of second-declension nouns: masculine or feminine in one class, neuter in another. Most words of the former class have -us (Latin) or -ŒøœÇ -os (Greek) in the nominative singular, except for the r-stem nouns in Latin, and the \\"Attic\\" declension and contracted declension in Attic Greek (when these groups are considered part of this declension). The latter class, i.e. the neuter nominative/accusative singular, usually ends with -um, in Latin and -ŒøŒΩ (-on), in Greek, matching the accusative of the former. In Latin, the masculine words of the second declension that end with -us in the nominative case, are differently declined from the latter in the vocative case: such words end with -e.

Sanskrit also has a corresponding class (although not commonly termed as third), in which the so-called basic case endings are applied very regularly. In contrast with the first- and second-declension endings, those of the third declension lack a theme vowel (a or o/u in the first and second declensions) and so are called athematic. One distinguishing feature of third-declension nouns is a genitive singular ending of a short vowel and s: Latin rƒìg-is \\"of a king\\" Greek œáŒµŒπœÅ-œåœÇ (cheir-√≥s) \\"of a hand\\", and Sanskrit bhagavat-as \\"of the blessed (one)\\". Another is a dative singular ending of i (short i in Greek, long ƒ´ in Latin): rƒìg-ƒ´ \\"for a king\\"; œáŒµŒπœÅ-ŒØ (cheir-√≠) \\"for, with the hand\\". This corresponds to an -e ending in Sanskrit, which might have been a contracted ai or lengthened i: bhagavat-e \\"for the blessed (one)\\" Many third-declension nouns, unlike first- or second-declension nouns, show different stems depending on case and number ‚Äî usually one stem for the nominative singular, and another for the rest of the cases, though some Greek nouns have three stems. Greek stems are often formed by ablaut: Latin hom≈ç \\"person\\" and homin-ƒìs \\"people\\"; Greek œÄŒ±œÑŒÆœÅ (patƒìr‚Äô) \\"father\\", œÄŒ±œÑœÅ-œåœÇ (patr-√≥s) \\"of a father\\", and œÄŒ±œÑŒ≠œÅ-ŒµœÇ (pat√©r-es), \\"fathers\\". In Sanskrit the situation is similar to that in Greek, but the strongest stem is used somewhat more. A subcategory within both the Latin and Greek third declension is nouns with consonant stems. These, unlike all first- and second-declension nouns, end in a consonant. Often the consonant at the beginning of certain endings undergoes a sound change with the consonant of the stem: Latin rƒìx \\"king\\", from rƒìg-s (compare the earlier-mentioned rƒìgis); œÄŒøœçœÇ (po√∫s) \\"foot\\", and Attic dative plural œÄŒøœÉŒØ (pos√≠) \\"on foot\\" from œÄœåŒ¥-œÇ (p√≥d-s) and œÄŒøŒ¥-œÉŒØ (pod-s√≠). These changes are subject to sandhi in Sanskrit. Greek third-declension nouns with vowel endings Other Greek nouns whose stems in the earliest Greek (notably Mycenaean) ended in Œπ (i) or œÖ (u), and j (English consonantal y) or œù (digamma; English w) in e-grade, have in later Greek undergone sound changes that markedly distinguish them from run-of-the- mill third-declension nouns. In particular, the stems with j or œù lose this sound, and in some cases the preceding vowel is lengthened by compensatory lengthening. In Attic, if there is a short vowel adjacent in the ending, the two vowels switch their lengths by quantitative metathesis. Illustrative of the process is the development of the genitive singular of Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπŒªŒµœçœÇ (basile√∫s), \\"king\\", œÄœåŒªŒπœÇ (p√≥lis), \\"city\\", and ·ºÑœÉœÑœÖ (√°stu), \\"town\\": :early Greek *Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπŒª·øÜœù-ŒøœÇ ‚Üí Homeric Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπŒª·øÜŒøœÇ ‚Üí Attic Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπŒªŒ≠œâœÇ :early Greek *œÄœåŒªŒµj-oœÇ ‚Üí Homeric œÄœåŒªŒ∑ŒøœÇ ‚Üí Attic œÄœåŒªŒµœâœÇ :early Greek *œùŒ¨œÉœÑŒ∑œù-ŒøœÇ ‚Üí *·ºÑœÉœÑŒ∑ŒøœÇ ‚Üí Attic ·ºÑœÉœÑŒµœâœÇ :*basilƒìw-os ‚Üí basilƒìos ‚Üí basil√©≈çs :*p√≥ley-os ‚Üí p√≥lƒìos ‚Üí p√≥le≈çs :*w√°stƒìw-os ‚Üí *√°stƒìos ‚Üí √°ste≈çs Further reading For specific information on the third declension as it appears in Latin and Greek, and paradigms of nouns belonging to the different subcategories, see the appropriate sections in Latin declension and Ancient Greek nouns. 3 3 ","title":"Third declension"},{"id":"5051666","text":"Alan Henry Spenner (7 May 1948 ‚Äì 11 August 1991) was an English bass player who performed with Wynder K.

Lenshina founded and led the Lumpa Church, a religious sect that embraced a mixture of Christian and animist beliefs and rituals.http://www.dacb.org/stories/zambia/lenshina1_alice.html The Lumpa Church rejected the authority of any \\"earthly government\\", it refused to pay taxes and it established its own tribunals. Shortly after Zambia became independent under President Kenneth Kaunda, she and her followers were engaged in the so-called \\"Lumpa Uprising\\". The uprising was suppressed and she was detained, but the Lumpa Church was never entirely eradicated. Origins She was born Alice Mulenga Lubusha in 1920 in the Chinsali district of the northern province of Northern Rhodesia. Alice was her baptismal name, while Mulenga was her traditional African name. Much information about her upbringing remains unknown. There are no further details on her mother beside her name, Musungu Chimba. Lubusha, her father, was a village policeman who fought for the British during World War I and was a messenger for the colonial administration. They were members of the Crocodile Clan, which was a distinguished clan of the Bemba kingdom. The name \\"Lenshina\\" was a Bemba form of the Latin word \\"regina\\" (\\"queen\\"). She married Gibson Nkwale. After he died, she married Petros Chintankwa with whom she had five children. Situated in a remote part of Northern Rhodesia, Chinsali district was a battleground for two competing Christian missions: the Roman Catholic Missionaries of Africa (the \\"White Fathers\\"), based at Llondola from 1934, and the United Free Church of Scotland, based at Lubwa from 1905. One of the Lubwa missionaries was David Kaunda, father of Kenneth Kaunda who became the first president of Zambia and who was a firm opponent of the Lumpa sect. 1953‚Äì1955 Lenshina was a member of the Church of Scotland until she became very ill with cerebral malaria in September 1953 and fell into a deep coma. On regaining consciousness, she claimed that, during her coma, she met Jesus Christ, who gave her the task of spreading a special message. She became the focus of a revival movement at Lubwa mission, where she was baptized. Lenshina preached a Christian doctrine with baptism as the only observance. She attacked witchcraft and sorcery, and condemned the consumption of alcohol and the practice of polygamy. A grand temple was built at Zion (the name given to her home village) in 1958. Gradually the revival became a witchcraft eradication movement and evolved into an independent church called the Lumpa Church in 1955. The Lumpa Church was the answer for women who wanted a more active leadership roles. The European missionaries were often domineering presence that devalued African culture, especially the importance of women. According to Hinfelaar, the Lumpa Church resulted from the Bemba women‚Äôs reaction against the missionaries who kept confining them to subordinate positions. The new church rapidly joined the competition for souls against the Roman Catholic Church and the Church of Scotland. Lumpa was so successful that by the late 1950s it may have had up to 150,000 members in the northern and eastern provinces of Northern Rhodesia. The church's drive for membership was so aggressive that it was seen as a political threat by the colonial Northern Rhodesia government. 1958‚Äì1964 At first the Lumpa Church was close to the main Black organization fighting for independence, the Northern Rhodesia African National Congress (ANC). However, when Kenneth Kaunda left the ANC in 1958 and formed the more militant United National Independence Party (UNIP) there arose a competition for members between the new church and the new party. Villages were split as Lumpa leaders ordered their members to establish separate villages by moving out of villages where they lived alongside UNIP's members. The conflict between UNIP and the Lumpa Church reached a climax in July to October in 1964, just before Northern Rhodesia's independence. On July 24, 1964, a gunbattle broke out between UNIP and Lumpa Church members. The resulting riots were only quelled by the intervention of State troops, and the proclamation of a state of emergency by the new pre-independence Prime Minister, Kenneth Kaunda. About a thousand people died in the clashes between Lumpa Church adherents, UNIP's members and the security forces. Approximately 15,000 Lumpa Church members fled and took refuge in Congo; some of them never returned to Zambia. The Lumpa Church was banned on 3 August 1964 and Lenshina surrendered to police a few days later. Hardly anyone faulted Lenshina for the violence that took place. This was evident when her biggest critic, Kaunda, never called for her trial in court. Even though she was the symbol for the Lumpa Church, she adamantly denied any involvement in the political disturbances. The political aspirations of her contemporaries took precedent over the Lenshina's desire for a religious and cultural revival. 1964‚Äì1978 Alice Lenshina herself played no significant role in the Lumpa Church's political activities. She regretted the fact that the political actions weakened the religious impact of her message, which stressed the sanctity of marriage, opposed both polygamy and traditional African folk magic and promoted the upliftment of common people, especially women. Lenshina never faced a trial but was detained by Kenneth Kaunda in Mumbwa district, beginning in August 1964. Her husband, Petros Chintankwa (who died in 1972), was detained with her. In 1965 they were moved to Kalabo district, near the Angolan border, but they escaped in October 1967. They were caught, jailed for 6 months and restricted in Mkushi district. In May 1970 Kaunda placed her in detention and ordered the destruction of her temple church in her home village of Kasomo. Finally she was released from detention in December 1975 but was put under house arrest in Lusaka's New Chilenje compound, Nkunda Road. Death Lenshina died on 7 December 1978 while under house arrest and was eventually buried at Kasomo village where the Kamutola Church stood. The Lumpa Church continues to exist to this day, though it is split and called by various names, the most prominent of which are Uluse Kamutola Church, under Chilemweni Nkonde (the biggest), Jerusalem Church, under Bubile (Daughter to Lenshina) and New Jerusalem Church, under Nkaya, in Kitwe's Chimwemwe Township.

The term 'Applied' means that the degree is vocational in nature, and not research- oriented (depending on the country of origin). The term \\"applied arts\\" have been used since the late 19th century to differentiate it from the pure arts, fine arts or a regular humanities subjects, since it consisted of technical applications or a physical product or outcome. The term Bachelor of Applied Arts was used in a similar manner as Bachelor of Applied Science. Usage The BAA is most often awarded in the Commonwealth of Nations, especially in Canada and New Zealand. For example, the BAA is awarded by Mount Saint Vincent University for child and youth study, also there are BAA awarded in architectural technology, interior design, applied linguistics, information technology, arts education, family studies, and gerontology. Northland Polytechnic in New Zealand offers the BAA for the visual arts. Canada In the past in Canada a (BAA) Bachelor of Applied Arts was slotted into fields that were both technical and creative in nature, or did not fit any of the traditional curricula of a classic structure of a \\"humanities\\" style degree. In Canada the term originated with Ryerson University in Ontario and prior to the late 1990s most of the degrees were B.A.A., as opposed to a B.A. Ryerson changed to the traditional degree naming after the end of the 1990s. At Ryerson programs were considered more professional in nature compared to other universities and offered theory classes alongside with practical applications, or at times combined in one class. There was also an outside program Liberal Studies - Humanities (breath) component for each program of study. Well known programs at Ryerson that used the B.A.A designation included Radio and Television Arts, Media, Journalism, Film and Photography, Theatre, Fashion Design and Merchandising, and Interior Design. In the early 2000s some Community colleges in Ontario were granted the ability to grant degrees and the B.A.A was adopted as the degree designation. The B.A.A designation is now used for all Degrees at Community Colleges in Ontario, but the Liberal Arts or Humanities component of the degree is not as strong compared to programs at universities due to funding and the difference in Policies for Colleges and Universities.

Usage during World War II Police authorities in Travnik report on the deportation of 118 Jews to Jasenovac concentration camp, ending with the official salute \\"Za dom spremni\\". During World War II, the Usta≈°e, a movement of radical Croatian nationalists and fascists, which ruled the Axis puppet state Independent State of Croatia (1941-5), created after the Invasion of Yugoslavia, and conducted genocidal campaigns against Serbs, Jews and Romani people. The salute \\"Za Dom ‚Äì spremni!\\" was immediately instituted as a new, revolutionary salute to be used in official correspondence and everyday life. On 10 April 1941, Slavko Kvaternik, designated commander-in-chief of the State's Armed Forces, and deputy of state leader (Poglavnik) Ante Paveliƒá proclaimed the establishment of the state on Radio Zagreb, and ended the statement with Bog i Hrvati!

In October 1941, state minister of education and culture Mile Budak issued strict rules regarding the mandatory usage of the salute. In July 1941, Usta≈°a commissar for Sarajevo, Jure Francetiƒá, issued a circular to state authorities on the importance of using the Usta≈°a greeting. As British historian Rory Yeomans notes, the Usta≈°e authorities were disappointed with the low acceptance of the salute among the population, even in the areas where the new regime enjoyed support. State officials and the government-controlled press constantly complained about the lack of the usage of the new salute, and they threatened with sanctions and reprimanded those who did not use it. In 1944, newspapers admonished the readers that \\"in the Independent State of Croatia there exists only one greeting: For the homeland ‚Äì prepared!\\" According to Yeomans, Usta≈°a movement saw the usage of the new greeting as \\"not only the question of ideological purity, but also the national pride.\\" Usta≈°a official Mijo Bzik furiously attacked all other greetings as foreign, servile and slavish. All official government and military reports and documents usually ended with \\"Za dom spremni.\\"Zbornik dokumenata i podataka NOR-a. tom V ‚Äì Dokumenti NOVJ ‚Äì Borbe u Hrvatskoj, knjiga 32 Ante Paveliƒá used the salute to end all of his private correspondence, even after the war ended, in exile (1945‚Äì56). As a part of their new cultural and language policy, government took an effort to replace \\"hello\\" when answering the phone with \\"prepared\\" (though, somewhat ironically, the former is and was used in Germany of which NDH was an ally). State Intelligence and Propaganda Bureau (DIPU) wanted to assess how many people used the salute by calling them randomly on the phone and recording whether they answered with \\"hello\\" or \\"prepared\\". Some of those who did not answer with \\"prepared\\" had their telephones confiscated. During this time, the salute was used in various ways, for example as \\"Za poglavnika i za dom spremni!\\"Izvje≈°taj ≈Ωupske redarstvene oblasti u Sarajevu od 2 oktobra 1943 god. o situaciji na podruƒçju ≈Ωupe, Zbornik NOR-a. tom IV ‚Äì Borbe u Bosni i Hercegovini ‚Äì knjiga 18 ‚Äì oktobar 1943., page 452Zbornik NOR-a. tom V ‚Äì Borbe u Hrvatskoj ‚Äì knjiga 25 ‚Äì o≈æujak 1944.

The office found the salute to be in violation of Croatian Constitution and the Law on Association. The salute is not explicitly banned by law in Croatia. The police usually views it as implicitly banned by misdemeanor laws and anti-discrimination laws and treats it as an offense rather than a crime (hate speech). For instance, during a house search and seizure of an illegal weapon in June 2017 in Kistanje near Knin, the police have removed the shirt with the salute from a man who was wearing it and charged him with the offence against the public order.\\"U majici s natpisom 'Za dom spremni' i s privjeskom na Paveliƒáa napao policajku: Oduzeli mu pu≈°komitraljez!\\", sibenik.in, 28/6/2017 In 2011, a municipal court in Knin dismissed the case against a craftsman who sold souvenirs which contained the salute Za dom spremni. The court ruled that accused didn't wear clothing or souvenirs with slogan that encourage national, racial or religious hatred, but instead he was selling them. While the former is punishable by law, the latter is not. The court ruling cited defendant's claim that \\"Za dom spremni is an old Croatian salute known throughout history\\" as a part of the defense statement, however, it didn't state any opinion on that subject.Presuda iz Knina ne odnosi se na pozdrav ‚Äù Za dom spremni‚Äù Austria Local authorities and security agency in Austria have noted that the salute and other Usta≈°a symbols are undesirable during the annual commemoration of Bleiburg repatriations in Bleiburg, Carinthia.\\"\\"Hier d√ºrfen wir alles bis auf den Nazi-Gru√ü\\", Der Standard, 17.

The Greens and many civil organizations have therefore asked Carinthian and federal Austrian authorities to ban the gathering.\\"Am Samstag findet in K√§rnten das gro√üte Neonazitreffen in Europa statt!, Vice.com, June 2017 In the spring of 2018, many federal politicians across the party spectrum supported a stricter enforcement of the Austrian laws against hate speech and Nazi insignia. After the Austrian government decided to send additional law enforcement and judiciary to control the gathering in 2018, the organizers decided to ban any flags, especially those with the CDF emblem and the salute Za dom spremni. The authorities announced that any expression of the salute will be punished. In November 2018, Austrian federal government included fascist Ustasa symbols and gestures/greetings amidst other unacceptable symbols (such as those of ISIS, Al-Qaida or Muslim Brotherhood) as the target of a new Law on Symbols (Symbole-Gesetz) proposed to the parliament. The use of Ustasa symbols and greetings will be punishable by up to a 1-month in prison or up to ‚Ç¨4,000 fine, while the repeated offense will be punished by up to ‚Ç¨10,000 fine or six weeks in prison. The exact list of symbols and greetings will be outlined through a separate government decision by March 1, 2019.

Historian Hrvoje Klasiƒá from the Zagreb Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences stated that \\"Za dom spremni\\" as a phrase has not been documented in any historical document prior to the 1941 formation of the Independent State of Croatia. Other prominent Croatian historians Tvrtko Jakovina and Ante Nazor, as well as former minister of culture Zlatko Hasanbegoviƒá, also a historian, supported this view.\\"HRT organizirao raspravu o pokliƒçu 'Za dom spremni!': Hasanbegoviƒá, Jakovina i Nazor se slo≈æili kako je rijeƒç o usta≈°luku iz vremena notornog Ante Paveliƒáa i NDH\\", Slobodna Dalmacija, September 6th, 2017 Supporters of the salute say that the words \\"Za Dom\\" (\\"For home\\" or \\"For homeland\\") were used in the 19th century by count Josip Jelaƒçiƒá, while he was leading the army from Vara≈ædin into a battle with Hungarians.

History The Shiratsuyu-class destroyers were modified versions of the , and were designed to accompany the Japanese main striking force and to conduct both day and night torpedo attacks against the United States Navy as it advanced across the Pacific Ocean, according to Japanese naval strategic projections.Peattie & Evans, Kaigun . Despite being one of the most powerful classes of destroyers in the world at the time of their completion, none survived the Pacific War.Globalsecurity.org, IJN Shiratsuyu class destroyers Shigure, built at the Uraga Dock Company was laid down on 9 December 1933, launched on 18 May 1935 and commissioned on 7 September 1936. Operational history At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Shigure was assigned to Destroyer Division 27 of Destroyer Squadron 1 of the IJN 1st Fleet on anti-submarine warfare patrols in Japanese home waters and to assist in guarding Japan‚Äôs main battle fleet. In early 1942, Shigure was assigned to convoy escort duties, escorting the aircraft carrier to Davao, and the carriers , and to Truk. At the Battle of the Coral Sea on 7 May, Shigure was part of the escort for Admiral Takeo Takagi‚Äôs Strike Force and at the Battle of Midway on 4‚Äì6 June, she was part of the Aleutians Guard Force under Admiral Shir≈ç Takasu. Shigure was reassigned to the IJN 2nd Fleet on 14 July after the Midway Operation was cancelled. In mid-August, Shigure escorted the fleet to Truk, and was then assigned to cover a troop transport run to reoccupy Makin Atoll after the Makin Raid. Based out of Jaluit in September, Shigure helped secure Abemama in the Gilbert Islands and Ndeni in the Santa Cruz Islands, before escorting a troop convoy from Palau to Rabaul on 24 September. In October and November, she made eight \\"Tokyo Express\\" troop transport runs to Guadalcanal. In the First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal on the night of 12‚Äì13 November 1942 she was part of the distant screening force and saw no combat, but later rescued survivors of the battleship . At the end of the year, she escorted the aircraft carrier from Truk to Yokosuka and back to Truk. In mid- January 1943, Shigure escorted a troop convoy from Truk to Shortlands, and was later assigned to \\"Operation KE\\", to cover troop evacuations from Guadalcanal. She returned to Sasebo in mid-February for repairs. Shigure returned to Truk in mid-March, escorting Ch≈´y≈ç and from Truk to Yokosuka in mid-April and returning with Ch≈´y≈ç and at the end of the month. In mid-May, she escorted the battleship from Truk to Yokosuka, returning to Truk by 21 June. In July, she was assigned to accompany the cruiser on various assignments around the Solomon Islands, and was reassigned to the IJN 2nd Fleet on 20 July. She made a \\"Tokyo Express\\" troop transport run to Rekata Bay on 27 July, and to Kolombangara on 1 August. During the Battle of Vella Gulf of 6‚Äì7 August, Shigure was the only one of four Japanese destroyers to escape, though she was later found to have been hit by a torpedo that failed to explode. During the Battle off Horaniu on 17‚Äì18 August, she again engaged United States Navy destroyers without damage while covering a troop transport mission to Vella Lavella. At the end of August, she made two troop evacuation runs to Rekata Bay, one of which was aborted, and one mission to Tuluvu and to Buka, Papua New Guinea in September. She further covered two troop evacuation missions to Kolombangara at the end of September and early October. She was covering troop evacuations at Vella Lavella during the 6‚Äì7 October Battle of Vella Lavella, and contributed to massive damage to the destroyer . For the remainder of October, she participated in four more transport runs to points in New Guinea. At the Battle of Empress Augusta Bay on 2 November, she engaged an American cruiser-destroyer formation, but without damage. After making a final troop transport mission to Buka on 6 November, she escorted a convoy from Rabaul to Truk, rescuing 70 survivors of the transport Tokyo Maru en route on 10 November. She returned to Sasebo in mid-November for repairs. Departing Sasebo on 24 December, she collided with a fishing boat in Bungo Strait, and was forced to return again to Sasebo for further repairs. In January 1944, Shigure escorted the food supply ship from Yokosuka to Truk, and in early February escorted tanker convoys from Truk to Tarakan and Balikpapan. She suffered heavy damage in an air raid on Truk by United States Navy aircraft, taking a direct bomb hit to her No.2 gun turret, killing 21 crewmen and wounding 45 others. She was withdrawn to Palau for emergency repairs, and returned to Sasebo on 22 March, where her damaged turret was removed and replaced by two triple Type 96 anti-aircraft gun mounts. Repairs completed by 11 May, she escorted Musashi and aircraft carriers , , Zuih≈ç to Tawitawi, and from there to Davao. In June she was assigned to ‚ÄúOperation KON‚Äù, (the reinforcement of Biak), in response to American landings. She rescued 110 survivors from the destroyer on 8 June, and then engaged in combat against a group of Allied cruisers and destroyers, taking two shell hits, which killed seven crewmen and wounded 15 others. From 19‚Äì20 June, Shigure was at the Battle of the Philippine Sea as part of Admiral Takatsugu J≈çjima‚Äôs ‚ÄúForce B‚Äù, and assisted in the rescue of survivors from the aircraft carrier . In July, she was assigned to escort a troop convoy from Kure to Okinawa, and in August accompanied the cruiser on a transport mission from Singapore to Brunei, Manila and Palau, returning via Cebu. In October, Shigure sortied from Lingga and Brunei and was at the Battle of Leyte Gulf on 22‚Äì25 October. She took minor damage from a direct bomb hit to her forward gun turret on 24 October, killing five crewmen and wounding six. She took further damage in the Battle of Surigao Strait in which a direct shell hit and several near misses took out her radio, compass, and steering, but she was the only ship of the ‚ÄúSouthern Force‚Äù to survive the battle, and limped back to Brunei on 27 October. Shigure returned to Sasebo for repairs in November, possibly sinking the submarine off Mindoro on 8 November en route. She was reassigned to the IJN 5th Fleet on 15 November and the IJN 2nd Fleet on 20 November, departing Kure on 17 December with the aircraft carrier for Manila. After Unry≈´ was sunk by the submarine , Shigure and the destroyer rescued the 146 survivors. On 24 January 1945, while escorting a convoy from Hong Kong to Singapore, Shigure was torpedoed and sunk by the submarine in the Gulf of Siam, approximately east of Kota Bharu, Malaya at position (). She sank slowly, allowing for 270 survivors to escape, with 37 crewmen lost. The survivors were rescued by the escort ships and . Shigure was removed from the navy list on 10 March 1945.

The tubes originate at a junction of two PATH lines on the New Jersey shore and cross eastward under the Hudson River. On the Manhattan side, the tubes run mostly underneath Christopher Street and Sixth Avenue, making four intermediate stops before terminating at 33rd Street station. Despite their name, the tubes do not enter Uptown Manhattan, but are so named because they are located to the north of the Downtown Hudson Tubes, which connect Jersey City and the World Trade Center. Dewitt Clinton Haskin first attempted to construct the Uptown Hudson Tubes in 1873. Work was delayed by five years by a lawsuit, and was further disrupted by an accident in 1880, which killed twenty workers. The project was subsequently canceled in 1883 due to a lack of money. A British company attempted to complete the tunnels in 1888, but also ran out of money by 1892, by which point the tunnels were nearly half-finished. In 1901, a company formed by William Gibbs McAdoo resumed work on the tubes, and by 1907, the tunnels were fully bored. The Uptown Hudson Tubes opened to passenger service in 1908 as part of the Hudson & Manhattan Railroad (H&M;) and were completed by 1910. After the Uptown Hudson Tubes' opening, the H&M; proposed extending them northward to Grand Central Terminal, as well as creating a crosstown spur line that would run under Ninth Street in Manhattan. However, neither extension was ultimately constructed. In the 1930s, parts of the tubes under Sixth Avenue were rebuilt due to the construction of the Independent Subway System (IND)'s Sixth Avenue Line. The Uptown Hudson Tubes contained seven original stations; two stations at 19th and 28th streets were later closed and the 33rd Street terminal was rebuilt. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey took over the H&M; and the tunnels in 1962, rebranding the H&M; as part of the PATH subway system. PATH operates two services through the Uptown Tubes on weekdays: Hoboken‚Äì33rd Street and Journal Square‚Äì33rd Street. On late nights, weekends, and holidays, they are combined into the Journal Square‚Äì33rd Street (via Hoboken) service. Description The Uptown Hudson Tubes travel a roughly east‚Äìwest path beneath the Hudson River, connecting Manhattan in the east and Jersey City in the west. On the Manhattan side, the tunnels initially take an eastward trajectory under Morton Street. At Greenwich Street, the tubes curve sharply north, then continue two blocks before turning sharply east below Christopher Street. This sharp curve, which follows the streets above it, was necessitated to avoid the demolition of preexisting basements during construction. The tubes do not enter Upper Manhattan, but are so named because they are located to the north of the Downtown Hudson Tubes, which connect Jersey City and the World Trade Center. At the time of the tubes' construction, what is now considered Midtown Manhattan was considered \\"uptown\\", while the true northernmost reaches of Manhattan were not as densely developed. The name \\"Uptown Hudson Tubes\\" also applies to the section of the subway under Christopher Street and Sixth Avenue in Manhattan. The first PATH stop in New York is at the Christopher Street station; service continues uptown to the 33rd Street terminal, making intermediate stops at 9th Street, 14th Street, and 23rd Street. Two stations formerly existed at 19th Street and 28th Street. The ornately-designed stations in Manhattan featured straight platforms, each long and able to accommodate 8-car consists. The stations underneath Sixth Avenue (14th, 19th, 23rd, and 28th streets, and the original 33rd Street Terminal) contain round columns with scrolls and the station name near the ceilings. The exposed steel rings of the tunnel's structure can be seen at Christopher and Ninth streets. On the Jersey City side, the tunnels leave the riverbank approximately parallel to 15th Street and enter a flying junction where trains can proceed to either Hoboken Terminal to the north or Newport station to the south. The Uptown Hudson Tubes measure , or between shafts. The tubes descend as far as below mean river level. In both the uptown and downtown tubes, each track is located in its own tunnel. When a train passes through the tunnel, it pushes out the air in front of it towards the closest ventilation shaft. At the same time, it pulls air into the rail tunnel from the closest ventilation shaft behind it. This enables the piston effect, which results in better ventilation. The diameter of the Uptown Tubes' southern tunnel is , while the more northerly tunnel is slightly larger with a diameter of , because that tube had been constructed first. Shield tunneling was used only between the Uptown Hudson Tubes' western end in Jersey City and 12th Street in Manhattan. North of 12th Street, the circular tubes transition into two rectangular tunnels, which measure high by wide and carry one track each. History =Initial construction attempts= In 1873, engineer Dewitt Clinton Haskin formed the Hudson Tunnel Company to construct a tunnel running under the Hudson River. He intended for the tube to run from 15th Street in Jersey City to Morton Street in Manhattan, a distance of . Trenor W. Park was hired as the president of the new company. Haskin initially sought $10 million in funding to pay for the tunnel. At the time, constructing a tunnel under the mile-wide river was considered less expensive than trying to build a bridge over it. An initial attempt to construct the Hudson River tunnel began in November 1874 from the Jersey City side. Had this original tunnel effort been completed, it would have been long. Trains from five railroad companies on the New Jersey side would have entered one of two tubes, hauled by special steam locomotives that would be able to emit very little steam. The engines would have continued to Manhattan, terminating at a railroad hub in Washington Square Park. This tunnel project was known as the Morton Street Tunnel. Work progressed for only one month when it was stopped by a court injunction submitted by the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad, who owned the property at the tunnel's New Jersey portal. As a result of the lawsuit, work on the tunnel was delayed until September 1879, when the judge ruled in favor of the builders and the injunction was dissolved. The construction method used at the time did not employ a tunneling shield; rather, it utilized air compressors to maintain pressure against the water-laden silt that was being tunneled through. Haskin believed the river silt was strong enough to maintain the tunnel's form‚Äîwith the help of compressed air‚Äîuntil a brick lining could be constructed. Haskin's plan was to excavate the tunnel, then fill it with compressed air to expel the water and to hold the iron plate lining in place. However, the amount of pressure needed to hold back the water at the bottom of the tube was much greater than the pressure needed to hold back the water at the top. On July 21, 1880, an overpressure blowout at the tube's top caused an accident that resulted in an air lock jam, trapping several workers and killing 20. A memorial for one of the workers killed was later erected in Jersey City. The liabilities incurred as a result of the accident halted tunneling work on November 5, 1882, due to insufficient funds. At that time, water was allowed to fill the unfinished tunnel. On March 20, 1883, the air compressors were turned back on and the tunnel was drained with the resumption of work. This continued for the next four months until July 20, 1883, when it was stopped once again due to a lack of funds. By that time, of one tube and of a parallel tube to the south had been constructed. In 1888, an unnamed British company attempted to finish the Morton Street Tunnel; it employed James Henry Greathead as a consulting engineer and S. Pearson & Son as principal contractors. S. Pearson & Son subsequently acquired the project's construction contract from Haskin's company. The firm used a new device developed by Greathead, a pneumatic shield called the \\"Greathead Shield\\", to extend the tunnel by . With a concentration of rock directly underneath the clay riverbed, the tube was aligned to pass directly above it, with very little clearance. To maintain sufficient air pressure inside, S. Pearson & Son decided to place a silt layer of at least above the tube. The silt layer was then removed after the tubes were finished, allowing each tube to maintain its own air pressure. S. Pearson & Son were unable to finish the tubes because they had also run out of funds by 1891. Work stopped completely in 1892 after the company had completed another of digging. By this point, the pair of tubes had been dug from both sides of the river. The northern tube extended from the New Jersey shore and from the New York shore, with a gap of between the two ends of the tube. The southern tube had only been excavated from the New Jersey shore and from the New York shore. = Completion = In 1901, lawyer and future statesman William Gibbs McAdoo casually mentioned the idea of a Hudson River tunnel to a fellow lawyer, John Randolph Dos Passos, who had invested in the original tunneling project. From this conversation, McAdoo learned about the unfinished Morton Street Tunnel effort. He went on to explore it with Charles M. Jacobs, an engineer who helped build New York City's first underwater tunnel in 1894 under the East River, and who had also worked on the unfinished tunnel. McAdoo and consulting engineer J. Vipond Davies both believed that the existing work was still salvageable. McAdoo formed the New York and Jersey Tunnel Company in 1902, raising $8.5 million in capital stock for the company. Unlike the North River Tunnels upstream, which would carry intercity and commuter trains when they opened in 1910, the Morton Street Tunnel was intended to carry only trolleys or rapid transit, which used smaller trains. This, in turn, allowed the Morton Street Tunnel to be smaller and less expensive. Originally, McAdoo only intended to complete the northern tube, which was further along in the construction process. Afterward, he would operate a narrow-gauge railway with two small carriages going back and forth within that single tube. However, amid worsening ferry congestion at Cortlandt Street Ferry Depot in Lower Manhattan, McAdoo ultimately devised a plan for a network of train lines connecting New Jersey and New York City. The Morton Street Tunnel became known as the Uptown Hudson Tubes, complementing a pair of downtown tunnels that McAdoo had planned to connect Jersey City with Lower Manhattan. The idea for the downtown tunnels was actually conceived by another company, the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad Corporation (H&M;), in 1903, but McAdoo's New York and Jersey Railroad Company was interested in the H&M;'s plans as well. 9th Street stationleft The new effort to complete the Uptown Hudson Tubes, led by chief engineer Charles M. Jacobs, employed a different method of tunneling using tubular cast iron plating and a tunneling shield at the excavation site. The large mechanically-jacked shield was pushed through the silt at the bottom of the river, and the silt went through the bulkhead of the shield, which faced the portion of the tunnel that had already been dug. The bulkhead contained a pressurized air lock in order to avoid sudden blowouts, such as had occurred during the original construction. The air pressure was maintained at . The excavated mud was then carted away to the surface using battery-operated electric locomotives running on a temporary narrow-gauge railway. In some cases, the silt would be baked with kerosene torches to facilitate easier removal of the mud. The cast iron lining would then be placed on the tunnel wall immediately after the shield had been pushed through, so that no silt could be seen on the tube wall behind the shield's bulkhead. These iron plates were then bolted shut to prevent leakages, as well as to maintain low air pressure in the tunnel. McAdoo later noted that the Uptown Hudson Tubes effort was the first project where machines, rather than workers, carted out the excess silt. Owing to the previous work that had been performed on the Morton Street Tunnel, the tunnel project was already half complete a year after McAdoo's company started digging. By 1903, the gap was only a few feet wide between the two sections of the northern tube. As a result, the tubular cast iron and tunneling shield method was mostly used on the southern tube. For the southern tube, the tunneling shield progressed from the New Jersey side. Some difficulties arose during the completion of the northern tube; the company had to use dynamite to tunnel through a hard reef on the Manhattan side and an explosion killed one worker. The two parts of the northern tube were connected in March 1904, accompanied by a large celebration that involved a group of 20 men walking through the completed tube from end to end. By the end of 1904, the New York and Jersey Railroad Company had received permission from the New York City Board of Rapid Transit Commissioners to build a new subway line through Midtown Manhattan, which would connect with the Uptown Hudson Tubes; the company received the sole rights to operate this line for a duration of 25 years. The Midtown Manhattan line would travel eastward under Christopher Street before turning northeastward under Sixth Avenue, then continue underneath Sixth Avenue to a terminus at 33rd Street. The New York City Board of Aldermen expressed that the line could be extended further north to Central Park in the future. McAdoo's company would also retain perpetual rights to build and operate an east‚Äìwest crosstown line under Christopher Street and Ninth Street eastward to either Second Avenue or Astor Place, with no intermediate stops. This option was never fully exercised, as the crosstown line was only excavated about ; the partly completed crosstown tube still exists. In January 1905, the Hudson Companies was incorporated for the purpose of completing the Uptown Hudson Tubes and constructing the Sixth Avenue line. The company, which was contracted to construct the Uptown Hudson Tubes' subway tunnel connections on each side of the river, had a capital of $21 million to complete the project. The Hudson and Manhattan Railroad Company (H&M;) was incorporated in December 1906 to operate a passenger railroad system between New York and New Jersey via the Uptown and Downtown Hudson Tubes. The Downtown Hudson Tubes, located about south of the first pair, had started construction by that point, and would ultimately open in July 1909. Digging for the Uptown Hudson Tubes was completed in 1907, after 33 years of intermittent effort; they were celebrated as the first non-waterborne link between Manhattan and New Jersey. Work continued to finish off the interior of the tubes. The finishing touches included the addition of a concrete lining, which replaced the original brick lining, as well as laying tracks and electric third rails; this took an additional year to complete. The stations on the Manhattan side were also completed during this time. Test runs of trains without passengers started through the tunnels in late 1907; the Hudson Companies tested its rolling stock on the Second Avenue Elevated, then delivered the trains to the Uptown Hudson Tubes for further testing. =Service begins= The Christopher Street station, the first station along the Uptown Hudson Tubes after they enter Manhattan A trial run, carrying a party of officials, dignitaries, and news reporters, ran on February 15, 1908. The first \\"official\\" passenger train, which was also open only to officials and dignitaries, left 19th Street on February 25, 1908 at 3:40 p.m., and arrived at Hoboken Terminal ten minutes later. The tubes opened to the general public at midnight the next day, at which point the tubes had taken more than three decades to construct. At the time, three more stations at 23rd Street, 28th Street, and 33rd Street were under construction, and there were plans to extend the H&M; line northeast to Grand Central Terminal, at Park Avenue and 42nd Street. The 23rd Street station opened on June 15, 1908. In the coming years, many businesses moved to Sixth Avenue, along the route of the Uptown Hudson Tubes, while commuters moved to New Jersey to take advantage of the 10-minute commute to Manhattan. New office buildings were also developed around the Hoboken Terminal. On July 19, 1909, service via the downtown tubes commenced between Hudson Terminal in Lower Manhattan and Exchange Place in Jersey City. By this time, the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) had become a viable competitor, with a proposal to connect its Lexington Avenue line to the H&M; at three locations: Fulton Street, Astor Place, and Grand Central-42nd Street. The Sixth Avenue portion of the H&M; line also competed with the IRT's Sixth Avenue elevated, which extended both north of 33rd Street and south of 9th Street. By 1910, McAdoo wanted to extend the Uptown Hudson Tubes under Sixth Avenue to 42nd Street, where they would curve east under the IRT's 42nd Street Line and terminate at Park Avenue, to create an easy connection to Grand Central Terminal, which was under construction at the time. There would be two intermediate stops at 39th Street/Sixth Avenue and 42nd Street/Fifth Avenue. The proposed extension to Grand Central soon encountered problems. At Grand Central, the H&M; platforms would be directly below the 42nd Street Line's platforms, but above the IRT's Steinway Tunnel that carried the Flushing Line to Queens. However, the IRT had constructed an unauthorized ventilation shaft between the 42nd Street line and the Steinway Tunnel; this would force the H&M; to build its station at a very low depth, making it relatively harder for passengers to access the H&M; station. As an alternative, the city's Utilities Board proposed connecting the Uptown Hudson Tubes to the Steinway Tunnel. A franchise to extend the Uptown Hudson Tubes to Grand Central was awarded in June 1909, with the expectation that construction would start within six months and that the extension would be operational by January 1911. However, by February 1910, financing had only been secured to complete the 33rd Street terminal, and not for the Grand Central extension. The extension to 33rd Street opened on November 10, 1910. By 1914, the H&M; had not started construction of the Grand Central extension, and it requested to delay the start of construction for at least two more months. The Rapid Transit Commissioners had determined that the Ninth Street crosstown spur was unlikely to be built soon, so permission to build the Ninth Street tunnel was denied. By 1920, the H&M; had submitted seventeen applications in which they sought to delay construction of the extension to Grand Central; in all seventeen instances, the H&M; claimed that it was not an appropriate time to construct the tube. On its seventeenth application, the Rapid Transit Commissioners declined the request for a delay, effectively ending the H&M;'s right to build an extension to Grand Central. = Reconfiguration underneath Sixth Avenue = Reconstructed 33rd Street terminal In 1924, the city-operated Independent Subway System (IND) submitted its list of proposed subway routes to the New York City Board of Transportation. One of the proposed routes, the Sixth Avenue Line, ran parallel to the Uptown Hudson Tubes from Ninth to 33rd streets. At first, the city intended to take over the portion of the Uptown Hudson Tubes under Sixth Avenue for IND use, then build a pair of new tunnels for the H&M; directly underneath it. With the IND committed to building the Sixth Avenue line, and the H&M;'s 33rd Street terminal located both above and below preexisting railroad tunnels, the IND preferred to acquire the tubes. However, the H&M; objected, and negotiations between the city, IND, and H&M; continued until 1929. The IND and H&M; finally came to an agreement in 1930. The city had decided to build the IND Sixth Avenue Line's local tracks around the pre-existing H&M; tubes, and add express tracks for the IND underneath the H&M; tubes at a later date. However, the city still planned to eventually take over the H&M; tracks, convert them to express tracks for the IND line, then build a lower level for the H&M.; As part of the construction of the IND line, the H&M;'s 14th Street and 23rd Street stations had to be rebuilt to provide space for the IND's 14th Street and 23rd Street stations, which would be located at a similar elevation. The 19th Street station was not affected because the IND tracks were located below the H&M; tracks at that point. The 33rd Street terminal closed on December 26, 1937, and service on the H&M; was cut back to 28th Street to allow for construction on the subway to take place. The 33rd Street terminal was moved south to 32nd Street and reopened on September 24, 1939. The city paid $800,000 to build the new 33rd Street station and reimbursed H&M; another $300,000 for the loss of revenue. The 28th Street station was subsequently closed because the southern entrances to the 33rd Street terminal were located only two blocks away, rendering the 28th Street stop unnecessary. It was demolished to make room for the IND tracks below. The IND line opened in December 1940; it replaced the Sixth Avenue elevated, which was closed in December 1938 and demolished soon after. = Later years = The remnants of the abandoned 19th Street station The 19th Street station was closed in 1954; the only entrance to the station's westbound platform had been located inside a building, whose owner canceled the lease for the station entrance. The H&M; determined that constructing a new entrance would be too expensive. In 1962, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey took over the H&M;'s operations, and the H&M; system was rebranded as the PATH. In 1961, as part of the Chrystie Street Connection and DeKalb Avenue Junction projects, the city began building a pair of express tracks for the IND Sixth Avenue Line. Although the tracks were located below ground level, they were directly underneath the portion of the Uptown Hudson Tubes that ran along Sixth Avenue; their ceilings located just beneath the bottom of the tubes. Service on the Uptown Hudson Tubes was suspended for five days in 1962 when it was discovered that builders constructing the express tunnels had drilled to an \\"unsafe\\" margin of underneath. The express tracks opened in 1967. In 1986, the New Jersey-bound platform at 14th Street and both platforms of Christopher Street were closed for three months for renovations. Due to positive train control installation on the Uptown Hudson Tubes, service through the tubes was mostly suspended on weekends from July to October 2018. Awards The Uptown and Downtown Hudson Tubes were declared a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1978 by the American Society of Civil Engineers. Additionally, the coal-fired Hudson and Manhattan Railroad Powerhouse, which generated electricity to run the Hudson tube trains, was built in 1906‚Äì1908. The powerhouse stopped generating in 1929, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 23, 2001.

Nicknamed \\"The Hedgehog\\", Jeremy was ranked by AVN at No. 1 in their \\"50 Top Porn Stars of All Time\\" list. Jeremy has also made a number of non-pornographic media appearances, and director Scott J. Gill filmed a documentary about him and his legacy, Porn Star: The Legend of Ron Jeremy, which was released in 2001. More than a dozen women have publicly accused Jeremy of sexual assault over the years. Several of the allegations relate to his appearances at fan conventions, alleging that he would grope and insert his fingers into attendees without their consent. In June 2020, Jeremy was charged with four counts of rape and sexual assault involving four women and in August 2020, he was charged with another 20 counts of either rape or sexual assault over a span of 16 years from 2004‚Äì2020 that involved 12 women and a 15-year-old girl. In total, Jeremy faces a 250-year prison sentence.  Early life  Ronald Jeremy Hyatt was born in Queens, New York, to a middle-class Jewish family from Russia and Poland. His father, Arnold (born 1918),http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/ron-jeremy- holding-pattern-aneurysm-article-1.1252201 was a physicist, and his mother a book editor who served in the O.S.S. during World War II, as she spoke fluent German and French. He graduated from Benjamin N. Cardozo High School.Hart, John. \\"The Hedgehog Shoots For Legit\\" , The Village Voice, Accessed December 6, 2007. \\"Long before Hollywood called, Jeremy was just another Bayside kid who enjoyed afternoons playing on his favorite tree outside his home on Bell Boulevard. He attended Benjamin Cardozo High School, where he appeared in theatrical productions like Oklahoma. One of his fellow cast members was Reginald Vel Johnson, who went on to fame in the Die Hard movie series and TV's Family Matters.\\"  Pornographic film career  Dennis Hof, Heidi Fleiss, and Jeremy at the Adult Video Network Convention in Las Vegas, 2006 Ron Jeremy Jeremy left the teaching profession (he called it his \\"ace in the hole\\") to pursue a legitimate acting career on Broadway. He has said that he learned then what it was like to be broke, making no money as an actor who \\"starved Off-Broadway\\". Jeremy soon found work posing for Playgirl after his then- girlfriend submitted his photo to the magazine. Jeremy utilized this opportunity as a springboard into the adult film industry, which he viewed as a reliable means of supporting himself. Jeremy began using his first and middle name professionally in the adult industry after his grandmother Rose was pestered by people calling her thinking they were contacting him. Rose, listed at that time as R. Hyatt in the phone book, was reportedly pestered at all hours by prospective suitors who'd seen Jeremy in Playgirl. \\"She had to move out of her apartment for a month,\\" he has said. \\"My father told me, 'If you want to get into this naked, crazy business, so be it, but if you use the family name again, I'll kill you.'\\" He quickly dropped his last name professionally for fear of embarrassing his family. Jeremy had the nickname \\"The Hedgehog\\" bestowed upon him by fellow porn actor William Margold in 1979 after a situation on the set of the porn film Olympic Fever. Jeremy flew in from New York to shoot the movie. Expecting warm California weather, he wore only a T-shirt and shorts and brought no additional clothing. During the long motorcycle ride to the set, located near Lake Arrowhead, in the California mountains, the weather deteriorated to blizzard conditions, which chilled him to the point of near hypothermia. Upon arriving at the set, Jeremy was immediately whisked away to thaw out in a hot shower. When he finished, his skin had taken on a pinkish hue from the temperature extremes, and all the many hairs on his body were standing on end. Margold's comment upon seeing Jeremy at that moment was \\"You are a hedgehog, my friend. A walking, talking hedgehog.\\" Contrary to popular belief, the nickname had nothing to do with his weight, as he was quite physically fit at the time. Jeremy is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records for \\"Most Appearances in Adult Films\\"; his entry on the Internet Adult Film Database lists more than 2,000 films in which he has performed, and an additional 285 films which he directed. By way of comparison, John Holmes, the next highest-ranked male star on the AVN Top 50 porn stars, has 384 acting credits listed on the IAFD. One joke that made the rounds within the industry at the time was \\"the kinkier acts some actresses would not perform were bestiality, sado-masochism, and sex with Jeremy\\" because he had an atypical appearance for a porn star.  Non-pornographic appearances  = Film = Outside the adult film industry, Jeremy worked as a \\"special consultant\\" for the 1986 film 9¬Ω Weeks.

Three weeks later, he was released from the hospital. Sexual assault allegations More than a dozen women have publicly accused Jeremy of sexual assault. Several of the allegations relate to his appearances at fan conventions, alleging that he would grope and insert his fingers into attendees without their consent. The organizers of the Exxxotica national adult conventions permanently banned Jeremy from their shows in October 2017 after a social media campaign by webcam model Ginger Banks. The Free Speech Coalition, an industry trade group, rescinded its Positive Image Award that it had originally presented to him in 2009 due to the allegations. In June 2020, Jeremy was charged with four counts of rape and sexual assault by the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office. Jeremy was accused of forcibly raping a 25-year-old woman at a home in West Hollywood in May 2014. He also allegedly sexually assaulted two women, ages 33 and 46, on separate occasions at a West Hollywood bar in 2017, and is accused of forcibly raping a 30-year- old woman at the same bar in July 2019.

County Sheriff's Department had received 30 new allegations of forcible rape and groping against Jeremy involving incidents that took place in L.A. County since 2000. On August 31, 2020, Los Angeles prosecutors filed 20 more counts that included charges of rape, sexual assault, sodomy and forcible penetration by foreign object against Jeremy that involved 12 different women with ages ranging from 15 to 54 years old and that spanned over 16 years from 2004 to 2020. A 15-year-old girl alleges that she was sexually assaulted by Jeremy at a party in Santa Clarita. The most recent incident is said to have occurred on January 1, 2020, when a 21-year-old woman alleged she was sexually assaulted outside of a business in Hollywood. Six other women alleged sexual assaults happened inside a West Hollywood bar the defendant frequented and another in the bar‚Äôs parking lot. The combined 24 counts could bring sentences of more than 250 years. Jeremy, who originally had bail set at $6.6 million when first charged in June, is in custody at Twin Towers Correctional Facility in Los Angeles.

In the story, a young fan of Spider-Man meets his hero. This comic was elected as one of the \\"Top 10 Spider-Man stories of all time\\" by Wizard and is regarded as among the most-loved Spider-Man stories. Plot Young Timothy \\"Tim\\" Harrison lies in his bed. Newspaper captions (from a report by Daily Bugle journalist Jacob Conover) say Tim is the greatest Spider-Man fan in the world and has collected every article available on him, including a whole album of The Daily Bugle retractions. Tim has also collected mementos such as kinescopes of Spider-Man's early television appearances and bullets from a crime foiled by Spider-Man. Suddenly, Spider-Man comes into Tim's room. In the following hours, the two trade anecdotes about Spider-Man's long career. The hero is surprised and touched by how much the boy adores him. When Spider-Man is about to leave, Tim asks him who he really is. After some hesitation, Spider-Man takes off his mask, identifies himself as Peter Parker, and retells the fateful night when his negligence let Uncle Ben die, causing him to fight crime. The story does not change Tim's admiration of his hero. A tearful Peter Parker embraces Tim (who refers to him as \\"Pete\\") and departs. An exterior view reveals Tim is staying in a cancer clinic. The last of the newspaper captions states that the boy's only wish is to meet his hero in person. Conover ends his report by stating his hope that \\"Spider-Man takes the time to visit a very brave young man named Tim Harrison, and I hope he does it soon. You see, Tim Harrison has leukemia, and the doctors only give him a few more weeks to live.\\" =Background= Most of Amazing #248 is Spider-Man's fight against Thunderball, but Stern's backup story is remembered much better than the main tale. According to Stern: Tim Harrison's death is mentioned in Danny Fingeroth and Ron Garney's \\"A Spider-Man Carol\\", in which Spider-Man meets Tim's brother Joey. The story was published in the 1991 Marvel Holiday Special. Adaptations The story served as the partial basis for the two- part story \\"Make a Wish/Attack of the Octobot\\", in the third season of Spider- Man: The Animated Series. The major difference is that the child is a girl, named Taina. She mentions a friend named Timmy. Another reference to Tim is at the end of the episode where there is a plaque that reads \\"WISH COME TRUE FOUNDATION FOR TERMINALLY ILL CHILDREN\\". Collected editions The story has been reprinted several times and collected in various trade paperbacks including The Very Best of Spider-Man (December 1994, ).

The novel has been described as Canning's best work in the thriller genre.Higgins, 2000 Synopsis Elderly spinster Julia Rainbird, under sessions by medium Blanche Tyler, or \\"Madame Blanche\\", promises her a large sum of money to locate her illegitimate nephew Edward Shoebridge. Blanche and her boyfriend, George Lumley, begin making inquiries around their area about the Shoebridges, despite no one knowing where Edward is, or if he is alive. Meanwhile, Edward Shoebridge, alive and under the pseudonym of \\"the Trader\\", has been organising small kidnappings around the area, but is planning a larger score, the Archbishop of Canterbury, whom he will hold for a large ransom. Adaptations The novel was adapted by writer Ernest Lehman into the film Family Plot, directed by Alfred Hitchcock, becoming his fifty- third and final motion picture. The film featured Barbara Harris and Bruce Dern as Blanche Tyler and George Lumley, with Karen Black as Francine and William Devane as Edward Shoebridge/Arthur Adamson. The film deviated quite heavily from the book, with the most noticeable difference being that the film was adapted as a black comedy. Other small changes include the switching of setting from England to Northern California, and the fact that in the book, Blanche actually had psychic abilities, while in the film, she fakes them for financial gain.

Bicycle is a major means of transport in daily use of the city. Rail There are several railway stations in the city, Tianjin railway station being the principal one. It was built in 1888, initially, the station was located at Wangdaozhuang (). The station was later moved to Laolongtou () on the banks of the Hai He River in 1892, so the station was renamed Laolongtou Railway Station. The station was rebuilt from scratch in 1988. The rebuilding work began on April 15, 1987 and was finished on October 1, 1988. The Tianjin Railway Station is also locally called the 'East Station', due to its geographical position. Tianjin West railway station and Tianjin North railway station are also major railway stations in Tianjin. There is also Tanggu railway station is located in the important port area of Tanggu District, and TEDA railway station located in TEDA, to the north of Tanggu. There are several other railway stations in the city. Construction on a Beijing-Tianjin high-speed rail began on July 4, 2005, and was scheduled to be completed in 2007. The following rail lines go through Tianjin: * Jinghu Railway, from Beijing to Shanghai * Jingha Railway, from Beijing to Harbin * Jingqin Railway, from Beijing to Qinhuangdao, Hebei * Jinpu Railway, from Tianjin to Pukou District, Nanjing * Jinji Railway, from Tianjin urban area to Ji County, Tianjin * Jinba Railway, from Tianjin to Bazhou, Hebei Roads and expressways Some spots in Tianjin, including roads and bridges, have names from Dr. Sun Yat-Sen's Three Principles of the People (for example, Minquan Gate on Zhonghuan Road). Names harkening back to the era of the Republic of China on the mainland also appear (e.g. Beiyang Road). Many roads in Tianjin are named after a Chinese province or city. Also, Tianjin is unlike Beijing, in that very few roads run parallel to the major four compass directions. Tianjin has three ring roads. Unlike Beijing, the Inner and Middle Ring Roads are not closed, traffic-controlled roadways and some often have traffic light intersections. The Outer Ring Road is the closest thing to a highway-level ring road, although traffic is often chaotic and sometimes more than chaotic. * Inner Ring Road (neihuan) * Middle Ring Road (zhonghuan) * Outer Ring Road (waihuan) Tianjin's roads often finish in dao (ÈÅì avenue), xian (S: Á∫ø / T: Á∑ö line, more used for highways and through routes) and lu (Ë∑Ø road). Jie (Ë°ó street) is rare. As Tianjin's roads are rarely in a cardinal compass direction, jing (S: Áªè / T: Á∂ì) roads and wei (S: Á∫¨ / T: Á∑Ø) roads often appear, which attempt to run more directly north-south and east-west, respectively. The following seven expressways of China run in or through Tianjin: * Jingjintang Expressway, from Beijing, through Tianjin's urban area, to Tanggu District / TEDA * Jinghu Expressway, from Jinjing Gonglu Bridge to Shanghai (together with Jingjintang Expressway, this is the expressway from Beijing to Shanghai) * Jingshen Expressway, through Baodi District on its way from Beijing to Shenyang * Tangjin Expressway, from Tanggu District, Tianjin, to Tangshan, Hebei  known in Tianjin as the Jintang Expressway * Baojin Expressway, from Beichen District, Tianjin, to Baoding, Hebei  known in Tianjin as the Jinbao Expressway * Jinbin Expressway, from Zhangguizhuang Bridge to Hujiayuan Bridge, both within Tianjin * Jinji Expressway, from central Tianjin to Jixian County The following six China National Highways pass through Tianjin: * China National Highway 102, through Ji County, Tianjin on its way from Beijing to Harbin * China National Highway 103, from Beijing, through Tianjin's urban area, to Tanggu District * China National Highway 104, from Beijing, through Tianjin Municipality, to Fuzhou * China National Highway 105, from Beijing, through Tianjin Municipality, to Macau * China National Highway 112, circular highway around Beijing, passes through Tianjin Municipality * China National Highway 205, from Shanhaiguan, Hebei, through Tianjin Municipality, to Guangzhou Air Tianjin Binhai International Airport (ZBTJ) is located to the east of the urban area, in Dongli District, Tianjin. Public transport Trams in Tianjin network was built by Belgian interests. The concession was given by the occupying powers in 1901 and recognized by the Chinese authorities in 1904. Tram services began in 1906. Tianjin was the first city to have its own citywide tram system in China. Buses were introduced by the municipality in 1932. Tramways were withdrawn around 1972. Trams returned in Tianjin as TEDA Modern Guided Rail Tram. There were 402 bus lines in the city as of 2004. The Tianjin Metro is currently operational, consisting of 6 subway lines and 1 tram system. The initial line started construction on July 4, 1970 and commenced service in 1984. However, this line, with its outdated trains and services, was forced to close down in 2001, and renovation commenced until 2006, when the line (now known as Line 1 on the system) reopened. The other line, Line 9, started construction in 2001 and opened in 2004, with recent extensions in 2011. The Tram line, TEDA Modern Guided Rail Tram, commenced operations in 2007 and runs between downtown Tianjin and TEDA (Tianjin Economic Development Area) in the coastal region. Other lines are under construction and will be successively opened.

This traditional designation was in use for centuries to divide the kingdom into ecclesiastical areas that were led by a parish priest. Prestegjelds began in the 1400s and were officially discontinued in 2012. History Prior to the discontinuation of the prestegjeld, Norway was geographically divided into 11 dioceses (bisped√∏mme). Each diocese was further divided into deaneries (prosti). Each of those deaneries were divided into several parishes (prestegjeld). Each parish was made up of one or more sub-parishes or congregations (sogn or sokn). Within a prestegjeld, there were usually one or more clerical positions (chaplains) serving under the administration of a head minister (sogneprest or sokneprest). In 1838, the formannskapsdistrikt law was passed in Norway and it created civil municipalities that corresponded to the same borders as the ecclesiastical prestegjelds. Prior to that time there was no local government in Norway apart from the church's parishes. Today's municipalities have changed some, but their roots are all based on the prestegjeld. Historically, the government employed all the priests working in all of the prestegjelds across Norway. In 1989, the law was changed so that each diocese employed the priests within its areas. Between 2004 and 2012, the prestegjeld was phased out of the Church of Norway. The new structure replaced the prestegjeld with the already-existing deanery (prosti). The sokn (sub-parishes or congregations) are the basic units of the church and all of the sokn within each municipality in Norway forms a governing church council for the municipality. The municipal church councils are part of a deanery and the deaneries are part of a diocese. Also in this reform, priests are now employed by the deaneries.

He is best known for his ventriloquism act with Chuck Wood and Ted E. Bare. Early life and education Strassman, the second of four children, was born and raised in Los Angeles County, California. His father, Harvey D. Strassman (September 19, 1922 ‚Äì January 30, 2011), was a psychiatrist and medical academic. Career A visit to Disneyland with his family prompted a young Strassman to ask his father to purchase some professional magic tricks that he performed for local neighborhood children. Strassman took a ventriloquism class in junior high school as an elective, taught by local Chicago children's television host Steve Hart. Strassman discovered he was good at it and could make money from his performances. Strassman studied acting at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York but returned to ventriloquism, busking in Central Park in New York, Leicester Square and the Marble Arch in London, and a brief stint in Paris. Strassman performed in New York's comedy clubs, including the Improv. In 1980, Strassman (along with his main ventriloquist character Chuck Wood) appeared in Roger Corman's horror movie Humanoids from the Deep. In 1986, Strassman added remote control to his puppet, Chuck Wood, using transmitters, motors, and servos, from his hobby flying remote control model airplanes. He discovered a remote clutch system in a NASA facility that could be integrated into his own dummies. At the end of Strassman's act, he gets into an argument with his dummy, Chuck Wood, and leaves the stage. Chuck then appears to come to life with Strassman speaking into an off-stage microphone. He debuted this routine on The Late Show with Arsenio Hall in 1989. New York ventriloquist Stanley Burns, used remote-controlled dummies in the 1950s. In 1995, he performed on The Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon. In 1996, he performed at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in Scotland. He received the ‚ÄúCritics Award for Comedy‚Äù and the Glasgow ‚ÄúHerald Angel award.‚Äù Strassman continues to perform frequently throughout Australia, New Zealand, and Britain. Strassman had a television talk show called \\"Strassman\\" on Nine Australia, where his puppet character, Chuck Wood, interviewed celebrities. Subsequent series were produced in England on ITV, and in New Zealand on TV2. Strassman has 6 DVD titles. Strassman Live (1999) ‚Äì Volume 1, The Chuck You Tour (2003) - Volume 2, Get Chuck'd Tour (2007) ‚Äì Volume 3, Ted E's Farewell (2010) ‚Äì Volume 4, Careful What You Wish For (2014) ‚Äì Volume 5, and iTedE (2018) ‚Äì Volume 6. In 2010, he performed the play, \\"Duality,\\" written and directed by Steve Altman, at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and in Los Angeles, CA. Duality is a two- character play about a mentally-ill ventriloquist, Jack, who talks to himself through a puppet named Zack. Throughout Duality, Strassman's character \\"talks\\" to his ventriloquist puppet as it sits lifeless in a chair, he operates it manually with his hand in the back, and controls the puppet through wireless robotics. Strassman regularly visits children's hospitals with his characters while on tour, including hospitals in Wellington and Melbourne. Strassman's show, Careful What you Wish For ran in Australia through April 2014. Characters Puppet characters voiced by Strassman include: * Chuck Wood - A 1950s era-looking wooden ventriloquist puppet whose character makes rude and crude jokes, fun of other characters, spits and vomits. Can also be remotely controlled. For the latter half of Careful What You Wish For, an alternate universe version of the character is presented as Charlie and sports a shaved, tattooed head and goatee, a look which carried over to Chuck in the sixth special, iTedE. * Ted E. Bare - A soft Teddy bear hand puppet whose character is na√Øve, inquisitive, slow, innocent and is often the butt of Chuck's jokes and pranks. For the latter half of Careful What You Wish For, an alternate universe version of the character is presented as Theodore Bare, who smokes cigars and headbutts Strassman several times. * Sid Beaverman - is a North American beaver whose character is an aspiring stand-up hack comic. For the latter half of Careful What You Wish For, an alternate universe version of the character is presented as Sidney Australia Wellington, a koala bear. * Kevin - An Alien puppet made of foam latex and controlled manually by Strassman. Similar in appearance to Crazy Frog * Grandpa Fred - Ted E. Bare's grandfather who has dementia. During the latter half of Careful What You Wish For, an alternate universe version of the character is presented as Grandpa Frieda, a transgender old bear. * A.N.G.E.L - Strassman's first female puppet, A.N.G.E.L is a robot android. A special mechanism is required to make Strassman's voice sound female. * Buttons the Clown - A manually operated clown ventriloquist puppet who appears drunk. * Little Ricky - A baby puppet that acts extremely nice to David. In earlier performances, Little Ricky was portrayed as David's nephew. * The Dinosaurs - Strassman's robotic dinosaur puppets who sing pre-recorded songs. * Vinny - A dolphin who is also a private investigator who has a bad relationship with his family.

Eerdmans, 1979, 1988. 844. or 2) inside a building with a smooth floor of earth, stone or wood where a farmer would thresh the grain harvest and then winnow it. Animal and steam powered threshing machines from the nineteenth century onward made threshing floors obsolete. The outdoor threshing floor was either owned by the entire village or by a single family, and it was usually located outside the village in a place exposed to the wind. Work on the threshing floor in Gumuara (Ethiopia) Structure of outdoor floors Outdoor threshing floors are usually located near a farm or farmhouse, or in places easily accessible from growing areas. They are usually paved with material that may be of various kinds, for example round stone cobbles about the size of a fist; slate; tile; or sometimes the underlying bedrock itself is exposed. Unpaved earthen threshing floors are also sometimes found. The floors usually have a slight slope, to avoid water standing on them after rain; and the paving may be divided by rays traced from a central focus to facilitate the pavement. To overcome possible unevenness, and isolate them from water running off after rain so helping to preserve them, threshing floors are often surrounded by a stout low wall. The construction was often in a high place, to take advantage of soft and steady winds to facilitate the work of winnowing, separating the grain from the chaff, once the threshing had been completed. Structure of indoor floors Threshing Floor by Alexey Venetsianov, 1821-1823 The central bay of a barn was the typical location of the threshing floor.Gardner, D. P..

Threshing in barns was mostly done by hand with a flail until threshing machines became available in the 19th century. The harvest could be stored in the barn and threshed during the winter. Barns may have a granary room or a separate granary building may have been used to store the threshed crop. A unique barn feature in some barns in parts of the northeast United States, called a swing beam, was designed for animals to walk in circles around a pole inside the barn pulling a device to thresh the grain instead of using a flail.Ensminger, Robert F.. The Pennsylvania barn: its origin, evolution, and distribution in North America. 2nd ed. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2003 The farm family could use the barn to their advantage in winnowing by standing in a doorway where a slight breeze is magnified by the wind passing around the building. Some barns had smaller winnowing doorsBrunskill, R. W.. Houses and cottages of Britain: origins and development of traditional buildings. London: Gollancz, 2000. 98. to the rear of the threshing floor to concentrate the breeze even more than the big barn doors. Use A horse pulling a threshing-board on a threshing floor Sheaves of grain would be opened up and the stalks spread across the threshing floor. Pairs of donkeys or oxen (or sometimes cattle, or horses) would then be walked round and round, often dragging a heavy threshing board behind them, to tear the ears of grain from the stalks, and loosen the grain itself from the husks. After this threshing process, the broken stalks and grain were collected and then thrown up into the air with a wooden winnowing fork or a winnowing fan. The chaff would be blown away by the wind; the short torn straw would fall some distance away; while the heavier grain would fall at the winnower's feet. The grain could then be further cleansed by sieving.

It is the largest arena in the SHL, and the second-largest indoor arena in Sweden. Apart from hosting Redhawks hockey matches, the arena is often the venue for team handball, floorball, concerts, and other events. It has also hosted indoor athletics. Owned and operated by Parkfast AB, the arena was designed by Mats Matson of MM Matsson Konsult AB, Hannu Helki√∂ of P√∂yry Architects, and Gert Wing√•rdh of Wing√•rdh arkitektkontor. Naming rights for the venue are owned by Malm√∂ Stad, in a ten- year contract, agreed in 2007. Malm√∂ Arena hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 between 14 and 18 May 2013 and the 2014 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships from 26 December 2013 to 5 January 2014. With a capacity of 12,600 for sports and 15,500 for concerts, Malm√∂ Arena is the second-largest indoor arena in Sweden, only trailing the Ericsson Globe, located in Stockholm. The attendance record for concerts at Malm√∂ Arena is 11,300, set by a Lady Gaga concert on 19 November 2010. The venue attendance record for ice hockey was set on 12 November 2008, when Malm√∂ Redhawks hosted Leksands IF in front of 13,247 people. Ground was broken on 10 January 2007, and the arena was inaugurated on 6 November 2008. The final construction cost for the arena was 750 million SEK. The arena is located about from Hyllie railway station, from where there are rail and bus connections to Malm√∂ Central Station, Copenhagen Airport, and Copenhagen Central Station. History Malm√∂ Arena, next to Hyllie Railway Station. Though it is Sweden's third most populous city, Malm√∂ often missed the possibility to host larger concert and music events because it lacked a suitable indoor arena. When the City Tunnel project was initiated by Malm√∂ Stad in the late 1990s, the city began to plan a new district in Hylliev√•ng. This led to the decision to build Hyllie station in 2001, as a part of the tunnel project, to boost the development of the new district. The ice hockey club Malm√∂ Redhawks, which was the proposed main tenant of the new arena, was initially uncertain of the new project and wanted to renovate its present home, the Malm√∂ Isstadion, instead of moving to an entirely new arena. However, the Redhawks were convinced when Percy Nilsson of Parkfast AB contributed seven million kronor to help the club's financial situation. The decision to build an arena in the area was first presented by Nilsson in May 1997, and developed further over the following decade. The permit to start building Malm√∂ Arena was granted in September 2006, and the first sod was turned on 10 January 2007 by Nilsson, hockey players Pekka Lindmark, Juha Riihij√§rvi, and Carl S√∂derberg, and two politicians from Malm√∂ Stad. The main contractors for the building of the arena were Parkfast AB, with the collaboration of the structural engineer Byggteknik i Sk√•ne. The arena was designed by Mats Matson of MM Matsson Konsult AB, Hannu Helki√∂ of P√∂yry Architects, and Gert Wing√•rdh of Wing√•rdh arkitektkontor. The final construction cost for the arena was 750 million kronor ‚Äì 100 million kronor over budget because of additions to the initial plan. The arena was entirely financed by Percy Nilsson of Parkfast AB. Malm√∂ Arena was inaugurated on 6 November 2008 with a large concert featuring a variety of artists, among them Robyn, Helen Sj√∂holm, Sanne Salomonsen, and Jill Johnson. The name of the arena was discussed during 2007, with Malm√∂ Arena or Hyllie Arena discussed as potential options. The naming rights were eventually sold to Malm√∂ Stad for 10 years in a deal worth 50 million kronor. Nilsson wished for the arena to have \\"Malm√∂\\" in its name because the city's new association football stadium, Swedbank Stadion, did not. =Sports= Malm√∂ Arena during the 2011 World Men's Handball Championships Malm√∂ Arena has hosted Malm√∂ Redhawks ice hockey home games since 2008, replacing their former home, Malm√∂ Isstadion. The team plays in the SHL, the first tier of Swedish ice hockey. The Redhawks play 26 games per season at the arena (excluding playoffs), making them the arena's most regular tenant. Malm√∂ Arena was the main venue for the 2014 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. In addition to ice hockey, Malm√∂ Arena hosted 22 matches of the 2011 World Men's Handball Championships, including the bronze medal match, and the final, between France and Denmark, which was won by France. Malm√∂ Arena hosted the playoff finals of the men's and women's Swedish national team handball championship in 2010 and 2012. Malm√∂ Arena was also scheduled to host the 2013 finals, but they were moved elsewhere when the arena was chosen as the host for the 2013 Eurovision Song Contest, which is scheduled to take place five days after the handball finals. In floorball, the arena served as the final venue for the 2010‚Äì11 and 2011‚Äì12 Swedish Super League finals. It will be used again for the 2023 World Men's Handball Championship with Sweden co-hosting alongside Poland. Malm√∂ Arena was used for athletics in February 2009, when the arena hosted \\"Malm√∂ Indoor Gala\\", a newly founded indoor athletics competition, organised by Malm√∂ Allm√§nna Idrottsf√∂rening (MAI). Several international athletes were invited to compete, including pole vault Olympic champion Yelena Isinbayeva, but she turned down the invitation due to illness. Many other major athletes refused their invitations for a variety of reasons, causing the competition to attract only meagre interest from the public. No more than 7,000 spectators attended, making the competition a financial failure. The competition was therefore not held again. =Other events= Swedish Idol being held at Malm√∂ Arena in 2009 Malm√∂ Arena has hosted several concerts as well as other music events such as Christmas shows and musicals. Britney Spears performed at the arena on 11 October 2011 during her Femme Fatale Tour. Rihanna was scheduled to bring her Loud Tour to Malm√∂ Arena on 31 October 2011, but the event was cancelled with only a few hours' notice because of health issues - she eventually did perform at the venue in August 2016. Other international artists who have performed at the arena are Bob Dylan, Cliff Richard, Tom Jones, Lady Gaga, and many others. The Lady Gaga show holds the attendance record for concerts at the arena, having drawn a crowd of 11,300; the cancelled Rihanna concert would have set a new record with 11,700 tickets sold. The semi-finals of Melodifestivalen, Sweden's national song contest, were held at the arena in 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012. Malm√∂ Arena also hosted Fotbollsgalan, Sweden's award ceremony for domestic football, in 2009 and 2010. The arena was selected to host the 2013 Eurovision Song Contest, which took place in May that year. Malm√∂ Arena's main contenders for this were the Friends Arena in Stockholm and Scandinavium in Gothenburg. Sveriges Television (SVT) decided on Malm√∂ Arena because of the good transport links around the arena, as well as SVT's previous experiences hosting Melodifestivalen heats at the arena. SVT also expressed the desire to host the contest at a slightly smaller venue than previous years to increase the Eurovision experience. Structure and facilities Eurovision Song Contest 2013 being held at Malm√∂ Arena Malm√∂ Arena has an overall capacity of 12,600 for sporting events; for concerts and other events, the capacity can be as low as 500 or as high as 15,500, depending on where the stage is placed.

It has been sponsored by the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television since 1987. It is the French- language equivalent to the Gemini Awards, the Canadian Academy's former presentation for English-language television. History In 1986, ACTRA transferred their awards to the Academy of Canadian Cinema & Television. The Academy called their television awards the Gemini Awards, or Prix G√©meaux in French. After their first Gemini awards ceremony for English-language television, the academy decided to have an awards ceremony for French-language television in 1987. In 2003 the Academy added categories for digital media. The first webcast for the awards ceremony was in 2008. In 2013 the Academy decided to keep the Prix G√©meaux separate from the merged Canadian Screen Awards. The Academy decided on this separation because French-language television does not have strong viewership in English Canada and there is a strong recognition of French-speaking celebrities among Quebecois people. In 2015 many categories were separated or renamed in response to production studios boycotting previous ceremonies. The Academy eliminated Best Soap Opera and replaced Best Drama Series with Best Annual Drama Series for shows that have between 2 and 13 episodes, Best Seasonal Drama Series for 14 to 26 episodes, and Best Daily Drama Show. In 2018 a change in rules dictated that if there is only one show nominated in a category, that show can instead be entered into the category that is closest to its runtime. This rule allowed District 31 to apply for entry in the Best Seasonal Drama Series. Nomination process Before 2015, production companies and producers would submit shows and individuals to be considered for a nomination. The Academy then created a nomination jury of five or six people who were selected because they had expertise and experience in that category. After viewing all entries, the jury would meet to choose by consensus two to five people to be nominated. The nominees would be announced in June. After a rules change in 2015, the juries for each category were replaced with six juries whose membership was decided by broadcasters. Awards process Before 2015, the process of awarding Prix G√©meaux consisted of a weighted vote; 50% of the weighted vote was from the nomination jury while 50% was weighted from members of the Academy. Each voter would rank the nominees from best to worst. After 2015, the weighted vote was recalculated and the nomination juries were 70% of the weighted total while 20% was decided by Academy members. The remaining 10% was based on the show's ratings and each program was ranked by Numeris. Awards For awards of merit, there are 84 television categories and 15 digital media categories. The Academy also awards Special Awards for various achievements. The Academy appoints a special committee who suggests nominations but they have also sent calls for nominations from Academy members. A proposed nominee is then presented to the Quebec board of the Academy for approval. The special awards include \\"le G√©meau sp√©cial des artisans\\"In English, \\"The Special G√©meaux for Craftsmen\\" created in 2019 and \\"le prix sp√©cial de la rel√®ve\\"In English, \\"The Special Prize for the Next Generation\\" is awarded to someone at the beginning of their career who is under 35 years old.

It extended for from an intersection with NY 22 and NY 55 in the village of Pawling to the Connecticut state line in the town of Pawling. At the state line, NY 341 continued eastward into Sherman, Connecticut, as a town road named Wakeman Road. The route crossed a largely undeveloped section of the county, utilizing parts of Quaker Hill Road, Mizzentop Road, and Kirby Hill Road. NY 341 was originally designated as part of NY 55 in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. The highway remained part of NY 55 until when that route was realigned to pass through Wingdale on its way to Connecticut. The old routing of NY 55 was renumbered to NY 341, which remained in place until it was removed in the 1940s. The alignment of NY 341 is now maintained by Dutchess County as parts of County Route 67 (CR 67), CR 66, and County Route 67A. Route description NY 341 began at an intersection with NY 22 and NY 55 in the village of Pawling. The highway headed eastward along Quaker Hill Road, exiting the village as it wound its way through a mountainous, undeveloped portion of the town of Pawling. It traversed a hairpin turn at Reservoir Road prior to entering Mizzen Top, a small hamlet west of the Connecticut state line. Here, the route straightened out ahead of a T-intersection with Mizzentop Road. It turned south here, passing by the handful of homes comprising the community before turning back to the east at a junction with Kirby Hill Road and Church Street. Now on Kirby Hill Road, NY 341 proceeded generally eastward over rolling hills to the Connecticut state line, where the NY 341 designation terminated and the right-of-way continued eastward as Wakeman Road towards Sherman. History When NY 55 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, it continued east from Pawling to the Connecticut state line via Quaker Hill Road. NY 55 was realigned to follow NY 22 north to Wingdale, where it turned east to follow its current alignment to Connecticut. The former routing of NY 55 east of Pawling became NY 341. The NY 341 designation remained in place until the 1940s when it was removed. The former routing of NY 341 is now maintained by Dutchess County as CR 67 (for Quaker Hill Road), a short portion of CR 66 (Mizzentop Road) and CR 67A (Kirby Hill Road).

Front Range Express (FREX - stylized frex) was a commuter bus service that began in 2004 and operating between the cities of Colorado Springs and Denver, with stops along the way in Greenwood Village, Monument and Castle Rock in Colorado, USA. FREX operated on Interstate 25 except when exiting to make stops at each city. FREX served the southern portion of the Colorado Front Range and during its tenure was operated via different contracts by Veolia Transport & Laidlaw Transit. It was added as a part of Mountain Metropolitan Transit, which serves the Colorado Springs and El Paso County areas. In 2005, annual ridership was 118,389 and daily ridership was 464. In 2007, nineteen Gillig BRT suburban buses were bought. Before 2007, FREX used many different models of buses including the GMC RTS, MCI 102-C3, MCI 102-D3, MCI 102-DL3 and NovaBus RTS WFD suburban. However, the older buses were prone to breaking down. To provide a more efficient service, standard Mountain Metropolitan Transit buses were used from December 2006 until the new Gillig BRT suburban buses entered service in mid-2007. FREX buses included amenities such as free Wi-Fi available to passengers throughout the route. Due to the lack of funding, FREX faced the likelihood of being eliminated after February 12, 2010. As a last resort, FREX put up for sale nine out of the nineteen Gillig BRT suburban buses. The first two attempts to sell the buses failed. On February 8, a successful bid of $1.44 million, an average of $160,000 per bus (a substantial loss), was made by York County Transportation Authority in Pennsylvania. These funds enabled FREX to continue for the remainder of 2010 with a reduction in service, including service times. The city of Castle Rock did not wish to help fund FREX any longer, so they lost the service at their stop. With the budget being higher than expected for 2011, FREX service continued through 2011 and most of 2012. However, due to the Colorado Springs new mayor's wishes, the FREX service was discontinued completely on August 31, 2012. On May 5, 2014 the Denver Post reported that the Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) was in the process of planning a replacement for FREX that would run along the Interstate 25 corridor and add new service into the mountains along the Interstate 70 corridor as part of their statewide transportation plan.

Later, Polish King Jan III Sobieski tried to establish contacts with Georgia. Many Georgians participated in military campaigns led by Poland in the 17th century. Bogdan Gurdziecki, a Georgian, who was the greatest authority on all things Persian working in the Polish king's diplomatic service, made frequent diplomatic trips to Persia, on which he obtained, among other things, guarantees upholding earlier privileges for missionaries. Already during the rule of King Jan Kazimierz, he sent on missions to Isfahan, and King Jan III Sobieski availed himself of Gurdziecki's talents in like manner (in 1668, 1671, 1676‚Äì1678, in 1682‚Äì1684, and in 1687). Gurdziecki remained at the court of the shah for several years in the capacity of special resident and representative of the Polish king; it was he who delivered to the shah Suleiman news about the victory of the Christian forces at Vienna (1683). Several Georgian politicians, intellectuals and military officers left Georgia for Poland after the Soviet armies invaded the Democratic Republic of Georgia (DRG) in February 1921, taking over the government and establishing the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic in the same March. Although not very numerous and consisting of a few hundred members, the Georgian community of Poland was very active politically and culturally. The best remembered are, however, the Georgian military personnel who served in the Polish ranks from the early 1920s until the end of World War II.  Georgian Prometheism  Active diplomatic contacts developed between the short-lived DRG and Poland was part of J√≥zef Pi≈Çsudski's well-known political concept known as Prometheism. Its aim was to greatly reduce the power of the Russian Empire and subsequently, the Soviet Union, by supporting nationalist independence movements of the major non-Russian peoples that lived within the borders of Russia or the Soviet Union. Polish and Georgian officers serving in the Polish Army, 1925 The Georgian Promethean groups were one of the most active within the movement. This was not overlooked by the Bolsheviks, who in 1930 organized the assassination of Noe Ramishvili, a prominent Georgian political leader and a major promoter of Prometheism. The 1932 Polish-Soviet mutual nonaggression pact precipitated the downfall of the Promethean movement though the Georgians continued their activities in various cultural and social organizations. The most important was the Committee of Georgia founded as early as 1921 by several Georgian intellectuals led by Sergo Qurulashvili. They had close contacts with the centers of Georgian political emigration across Europe, primarily in Paris. The Committee organized various meetings and social activities and provided material support for the Georgian √©migr√©s. It also published its own publications, ProGeorgia (1922), and Propartia (1923). From 1923 to 1924, Qurulashvili also directed the journal Schlos Wschodu pertaining to the Georgian problems. The Georgians organized also the Union of Georgian Students and the Polish-Georgian Society led by Prince Pavle Tumanishvili. The activities of these organizations were limited, however, due to financial difficulties.  Georgians in the Polish military service  Major Giorgi Mamaladze, later murdered in the 1940 Katyn massacre Immediately after the fall of the DRG, Noe Zhordania, the head of the Georgian government- in-exile, addressed the friendly nations, particularly France, Greece and Poland, to help in maintaining the professional military cadres. The government of Poland promptly responded, and from 1922 to 1924, hundreds of Georgian Junkers and officers, recommended by Zhordania‚Äôs government, were accepted in the Polish military schools. Several professional officers of the former DRG attended military training courses at the Polish army centers. Although not obligated to do so, virtually all of them were subsequently enrolled in the Polish army as contract officers. In the subsequent decade, the total number of Georgian military servicemen reached 1,000. At the outbreak of World War II, most of the Georgian officers took part in the 1939 Defensive War, and several of them commanded their own regiments composed of Polish soldiers. The most notable officers were: Zakaria Bakradze, genera≈Ç dywizji, deputy commander of Polish 15th Infantry Division. Aleksandre Chkheidze, genera≈Ç brygady, deputy commander of Polish 16th Infantry Division. Ivane Kazbegi, genera≈Ç brygady. Aleksandre Koniashvili, genera≈Ç brygady. Kirile Kutateladze, genera≈Ç brygady. Aleksandre Zakariadze, genera≈Ç brygady. Viktor Lomidze, the commander of . Jerzy Tumaniszwili, captain of the navy, who was awarded Virtuti Militari. Valerian Tevzadze, podpu≈Çkownik, the commander of the northern sector of the Polish defences during the siege of Warsaw. Mikheil Kvaliashvili, major, the commander of a cavalry battalion within the 15th Uhlans Regiment. Several Georgian officers were captured by the Soviet forces during the 1939 campaign. General Chkheidze, Major Mamaladze, Captain Skhirtladze and Captain Rusiashvili were killed during the infamous Katyn Massacre, from 1940 to 1941. Many others spent several years in the gulag camps. During the occupation of Poland, the Germans reorganized the Warsaw-based Committee of Georgia and placed it under their tight control. The occupation administration encouraged the Georgian soldiers in the Polish service to join the Georgian Legion of the Wehrmacht. Some of them responded to the Nazi request, but subsequently joined the Polish resistance movement. The Georgian Orthodox priest and Professor Grigol Peradze of Warsaw University was killed on December 6, 1942 in the Nazi concentration camp of Auschwitz (O≈õwiƒôcim) when he took the blame for the murder of a German officer to spare his fellow prisoners, or, according to another report, when he entered a gas- chamber in the place of a Jewish prisoner who had a large family.Archpriest Zakaria Machitadze, Lives of the Georgian Saints, trans. David and Lauren Elizabeth Ninoshvili and ed. Lado Mirianashvili and the St. Herman of Alaska Brotherhood (Platina, Cal.: St. Herman of Alaska Brotherhood, 2006), 424-426. The American John Malchase David Shalikashvili, general of the United States Army who served as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 1993 to 1997, was born in Warsaw, Poland, where his father also served in the army. After the war, most Georgians either left for Western Europe or were deported to the Soviet camps though some of them (e.g., General V. Tevzadze) remained in the Polish anti-Communist underground for several decades.

Biography In films since childhood in his native Germany, Kieling appeared in a few American films such as Alfred Hitchcock's Torn Curtain (1966), where he played Gromek, an East German agent brutally slain by Paul Newman's character. He also played Gromek's brother in a scene that was deleted from the final print Rawle, Steven & Donnelly, K. J. Partners in Suspense: Critical Essays on Bernard Herrmann and Alfred Hitchcock Oxford University Press, 2017, Kieling had a small role in $ (aka, The Heist, 1971), starring Warren Beatty. In a British film, Amsterdam Affair (1968), he portrayed the fictional Dutch detective Van der Valk several years before Barry Foster (another Hitchcock alumnus) was cast in the same role for the British TV series. He did much work on German TV, including the first episode of Derrick (\\"Waldweg\\", 1974). The best of his later roles was in the film Out of Order (1984), originally titled Abw√§rts. In the German-language version of Disneys Alice in Wonderland he dubbed the Mad Hatter. Early on, Kieling also became a dubbing actor for German dubs of foreign films, serving as the standard dubbing voice of Glenn Ford, Frank Sinatra (in his 1950s films), and he also dubbed Charlton Heston in the first part of the Planet of the Apes franchise. Thanks to his voice's similarity to that of Gert G√ºnther Hoffmann, he would also replace Hoffmann as the dubbing voice of Paul Newman when Hoffmann was not available. On TV, he was especially known as the German voice of Bert (see Bert and Ernie) from Sesame Street up until his death in 1985. In October 1952 his wife Jola Jobst (ex-wife of German Luftwaffe ace Hermann Graf), whom he had married in 1950, committed suicide.Bergstr√∂m, Christer; Antipov, Vlad, and Sundi, Claes (2003).

It is on the Cross-City Line southwest of . The station, and all trains serving it, are operated by West Midlands Trains. The station itself is an unstaffed station. Originally a single platform station on a single-track line, a second platform was added during 2014, when a new passing loop was constructed on the line through the station, in order to allow a more frequent service. Services As of December 2018, the station is served every 20 minutes by trains to Redditch Monday to Saturday, and every 30 minutes on Sundays. Northbound Monday to Saturday, there are trains every 20 minutes; one per hour to Four Oaks, one to Lichfield City and one to Lichfield Trent Valley. On Sundays, there are trains every half-hour to Lichfield Trent Valley. This increase follows the installation of a passing loop and second platform at the station in 2014. History Alvechurch station was built as part of the Redditch Railway and opened on 1 November 1859. From the beginning it was operated by the Midland Railway, who had extended the line south of Redditch to Evesham and (the Evesham Loop Line) by 1868. It became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway during the 1923 railway grouping. Under the 1948 transport nationalisation it became part of the London Midland Region of British Railways. Passenger services beyond Redditch ended in October 1962 and the line closed completely in July 1964 - the remainder of the route (including the station here) was threatened with closure following the publication of the Beeching Report in 1963 but subsequently reprieved (albeit with a much reduced level of service - just four trains per day each way from the mid-1960s onwards) to serve the planned Redditch New town development announced in 1964. As a result of the Transport Act 1968, from 1969 BR operated the passenger service on behalf of the newly created West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive. In 1982 BR divided its business into sectors, and Alvechurch came under its Regional Railways sector. Under the Privatisation of British Rail, Regional Railways was divided into several train operating companies. From 1997 Alvechurch became part of the Central Trains franchise. In 2007 the first franchise expired and was restructured. The new franchise was awarded to London Midland and runs until 2015. As a PTE station, Alvechurch has train services operated under the Network West Midlands names. Under their auspices, the service was significantly improved in 1980 when the branch became part of the recently inaugurated Cross-City Line from via New Street and .History of the Cross-City LineRedditch MRC; Retrieved 2013-12-16 When the Cross-city line was upgraded and electrified in 1993 the platform at Alvechurch was re-sited slightly northwards.

Playboy Press) The Fury is a thriller/horror novel by American writer John Farris. The novel was published in 1976 and became a feature film in 1978 starring Kirk Douglas and Amy Irving. Plot summary In 1972, a young man named Robin Sandza lives with his strictly religious aunt and uncle due to his father Peter‚Äôs frequent trips on business. As he grows, Robin develops powerful psychic abilities. Unknown to Robin, his father‚Äôs ‚Äúbusiness trips‚Äù are cover for his true occupation as a government assassin. One of Peter‚Äôs superiors in the intelligence community, the cruel and ambitious Ben Childermass, learns of Robin‚Äôs abilities. Childermass fakes Robin‚Äôs death for Peter, while also convincing Robin of Peter‚Äôs death, all as part of a conspiracy to isolate Robin and turn him into a deadly weapon under Childermass‚Äô control. Robin also shares a psychic bond with Gillian Bellaver, the daughter of immensely rich and influential parents, owing to the two of them being psychic \\"twins\\". Though Robin remembers past lives where they were together, Gillian does not and was born a few years after Robin in this cycle. As a result, Robin's powers have surpassed Gillian's. Though their bond is different than it had been in other lives, they can still \\"visit\\" each other psychically, and have done so since Gillian was much younger. In 1976, Gillian's own psychic powers begin to emerge after an intense clairvoyant episode leads to a hospital stay. She grows in strength quickly, but has no control. Her powers cause her to pass out, while the energy she generates when using them cause fatal hemorrhaging in anyone unlucky enough to be nearby. By now, Peter has realized Robin‚Äôs death was faked and is using his vicious and violent skills to hunt down Childermass and reclaim his son. In the process, he learns of Gillian as Childermass is also made aware of the young woman‚Äôs potential. Childermass‚Äô agents nearly kill Peter as he attempts to find Robin. Meanwhile, Robin has been growing terribly powerful but increasingly unstable and paranoid during the years he has been under the manipulations of Childermass‚Äô organization. Gillian has become aware of this dark turn as her \\"visits\\" with Robin have become abusive. After a demonstration of Robin‚Äôs powers, other government agencies recognize the threat represented by Robin and by Childermass‚Äô lust for power. When Peter contacts a friend for help in reaching his son, he is programmed by Childermass‚Äô enemies to kill Robin. Gillian's parents unwittingly surrender her to Childermass. She is rescued by Peter's girlfriend Hester, who has infiltrated Childermass' organization. Hester is killed but Peter takes Gillian to safety. Gillian reveals her bond with Robin, and that she can use it to find him. The pair are captured by Childermass and brought to the facility where Robin is held. Robin has a psychotic break, brutally murdering the doctor who had been sexually manipulating and grooming him for Childermass. Peter and Robin briefly escape and are reunited on the roof of the facility. In a moment of clarity, Robin calls to Peter, triggering his father‚Äôs programming. Peter drops Robin from the roof to his death and is subsequently shot and killed by an enraged Childermass. Childermass intends to simply start over with Gillian, but she has witnessed enough to realize his depravity. Gillian ambushes him in the bath, where she forces him under the water and uses her powers to kill him. In the aftermath, Gillian resolves to gain control over her abilities as she waits for her parents and the authorities to find her. Film A film adaptation of the novel was released in 1978. Farris wrote the screenplay, Brian De Palma directed and Kirk Douglas and Amy Irving starred. Carrie, a 1974 novel by Stephen King with a similar premise and its 1976 film adaptation, also directed by De Palma and Irving was also cast. In April 2008 a remake of the film was announced by Fox 2000, to be written by Brian McGreevy and Lee Shipman. Farris stated that he would not be involved in the project. Since then, there has been no further news on the project.

Bullock, 2003, Introduction to Emergency Management, Amsterdam: Butterworth-Heinemann, Origin of the act The act was motivated by a long history of property damage and loss of life due to flooding.Wright, James M., The Nation's Response to Flood Disasters: A Historical Account. 1 April 2000. The legislation was finally promulgated because of the recent flood loss sustained in Florida and Louisiana following the destruction caused by the Hurricane Betsy flood surge in 1965. National Flood Insurance Program The NFIP goals are two-fold: ‚Ä¢ To provide flood insurance for structures and contents in communities that adopt and enforce an ordinance outlining minimal floodplain management standards. ‚Ä¢ To identify areas of high and low flood hazard and establish flood insurance rates for structures inside each flood hazard area. Amendments The program was first amended by the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, which made the purchase of flood insurance mandatory for the protection of property within SFHAs. In 1982, the Act was amended by the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA). The CBRA enacted a set of maps depicting the John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System (CBRS) in which federal flood insurance is unavailable for new or significantly improved structures. The National Flood Insurance Reform Act of 1994 codified the Community Rating System (an incentive program that encourages communities to exceed the minimal federal requirements for development within floodplains) within the NFIP. The program was further amended by the Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2004, with the goal of reducing \\"losses to properties for which repetitive flood insurance claim payments have been made.\\" More specifically, FIRA authorized FEMA to offer assistance in the buyout of Severe Repetitive Loss Properties to willing sellers and impose premium hikes on those that refused. =Biggert‚ÄìWaters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012= The Biggert‚ÄìWaters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 was \\"designed to allow premiums to rise to reflect the true risk of living in high-flood areas.\\" The bill was supposed to deal with the increasing debt of the National Flood Insurance Program by requiring the premiums to reflect real flood risks. The result was a 10 fold increase in premiums. At present, $527 billion worth of property is in the coastal floodplain. The federal government heavily underwrites the flood insurance rates for these areas. The law \\"ordered FEMA to stop subsidizing flood insurance for second homes and businesses, and for properties that had been swamped multiple times.\\" These changes were to occur gradually over the course of five years. FEMA was also instructed to do a study on the affordability of this process, a study which it has failed to complete. =Proposed= In January 2014, the United States Senate passed the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014 (S. 1926; 113th Congress). That bill would delay the increases in flood insurance premiums that were part of the Biggert‚ÄìWaters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012. The reforms from that law were meant to require flood insurance premiums to actually reflect the real risk of flooding, which led to an increase in premiums. The National Flood Insurance Program is currently $24 billion in debt and taxpayers will be forced to pay for any additional payouts until that situation is solved. In March 2014, the United States House of Representatives passed the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2013 (H.R. 3370; 113th Congress), a similar but not identical bill to the Senate version (S. 1926). The bill would amend the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 to prohibit the Federal Emergency Management Agency from providing flood insurance to prospective insureds at rates less than those estimated for any property purchased after the expiration of such six-month period (currently, any property purchased after July 6, 2012). It would also make additional reforms to the National Flood Insurance Program and delay some of the provisions of the Biggert‚ÄìWaters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012. Criticism According to critics of the program, the government's subsidized insurance plan \\"encouraged building, and rebuilding, in vulnerable coastal areas and floodplains.\\" Stephen Ellis, of the group Taxpayers for Common Sense, points to \\"properties that flooded 17 or 18 times that were still covered under the federal insurance program\\" without premiums going up.

The first desegregated hotel casino, it was popular with many of the black entertainers of the time, who would entertain at the other hotels and casinos and stay at the Moulin Rouge. The Hotel was named after the Paris nightclub, the Moulin Rouge.  Early history  Life magazine, June 20, 1955 The Moulin Rouge opened on May 24, 1955, built at a cost of $3.5 million. It was the first integrated hotel casino in the United States. Until that time almost all of the casinos on the Strip were totally segregated‚Äîoff limits to blacks unless they were the entertainment or labor force. =Characteristic= The hotel was located in West Las Vegas, where the black population lived. West Las Vegas was bounded by Washington Avenue on the north, Bonanza Road on the south, H Street on the west, and A Street on the east. The establishment was a model of eye-catching, 110 rooms, a gorgeous showroom, swimming pool, restaurant/coffee shop, dress-shop, and bar which was constructed of highly polished and expensive hardwoods. References to Paris are numerous: * The Eiffel Tower appears vertically on the sign of the establishment, and also on the casino chips, * A French Chef is at the head of the largest gastronomic restaurant of the establishments * From the entrance, security personnel are dressed in the uniform of the French Foreign Legion (allusion to France and Edith Piaf, who made a comeback after the war with Yves Montand at the Moulin Rouge), which, according to the press, adds a touch of glamour in Las Vegas. =Founding= It was during this era that Vester Heath saw the need for an integrated hotel. Will, along with other white investors‚ÄîLouis Rubin, owner of Chandler's Restaurant in New York City, and Alexander Bisno, who worked in real estate in California‚Äîand black boxing great Joe Louis, built and opened the Moulin Rouge at 900 West Bonanza Road. This location placed it in a prime location between the predominantly white area of the Strip and the largely black west side. =Design= The complex itself consisted of two \\"Googie-populuxe\\" Modernist style stuccoed buildings that housed the hotel, the casino, and a theater. The exterior had the hotel's name in stylized cursive writing and murals depicting dancing and fancy cars. The sign was designed by Betty Willis, creator of the \\"Welcome to Las Vegas\\" sign on the south end of the Strip. The Moulin Rouge in Paris was a source of inspiration. When the casino opened the revue \\"Tropi Cancan,\\" was inspired by the French Cancan, created in the 19th century to the Moulin Rouge Paris: ¬´The Moulin Rouge Hotel and Casino opened on May 24, 1955 to fanfare, long lines of well-dressed visitors, and Las Vegas' newest showroom revue, the Tropi-Can-Can Revue¬ª This inspiration comes from the first Afro-American star in France, Josephine Baker. The wall painted of the Moulin Rouge Las Vegas, included many references to Paris and Toulouse-Lautrec. \\"Black showgirls performed on a stage amid a backdrop of walls featuring mahogany wood trim and Toulouse- Lautrec-style murals of black French cancan dancers. The showroom featured \\"Tropi-Can-Can\\" under the tutelage of veteran producer Clarence Robinson.\\" Operating and direction When it opened, the Moulin Rouge was fully integrated top to bottom, from employees to patrons to entertainers. The hotel made the June 20, 1955, cover of Life magazine, with a photo of two showgirls. A veritable \\"A\\" list of performers regularly showed to party until dawn. Great black singers and musicians such as Lena Horne, Sammy Davis Jr., Louis Armstrong, Sarah Vaughan, Nat King Cole, Duke Ellington, Dorothy Dandridge, Harry Belafonte, Pearl Bailey, and Count Basie would perform often. Many of these artists were banned from gambling or staying at the hotels on the Strip. In addition, white performers, including George Burns, Jeanette MacDonald, Tallulah Bankhead, Judy Garland, Marlene Dietrich, Frankie Laine, Maurice Chevalier, Zsa Zsa Gabor, Jack Benny, Sophie Tucker and Frank Sinatra, would drop in after their shows to gamble and perform. Eventually management added a 2:30am \\"Third Show\\" to accommodate the crowds. Closure and landmarking In November 1955 the Moulin Rouge was closed by Sheriff's deputies. By December 1955, the casino had filed for bankruptcy. Nevertheless, to maintain its gaming license, the Moulin Rouge (like many closed properties) operates on a temporary basis for a state-mandated minimum of eight hours every two years, with video poker machines being trucked in for the day. This occurred for example on June 19, 2012, on June 11, 2014, and for the eighth time on May 29, 2018. =Civil-rights heritage= The short but vibrant life of the Moulin Rouge helped the Civil Rights Movement in Las Vegas. For a while the hotel was owned by the first African American woman to hold a Nevada Gaming License, Sarann Knight-Preddy. Many of those who enjoyed and were employed by the hotel became activists and supporters. The hotel was also the spark needed to bring an end to segregation on the Strip. In 1960, under threat of a protest march down the Las Vegas Strip against racial discrimination by Las Vegas casinos, a meeting was hurriedly arranged by then-Governor Grant Sawyer between hotel owners, city and state officials, local black leaders, and then-NAACP president Dr. James McMillan. The meeting was held on March 26 at the closed Moulin Rouge. This resulted in an agreement to desegregate all Strip casinos. Hank Greenspun, who would become an important media figure in the town, mediated the agreement. Preservation and fires In 1992 the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places and became a symbol of the expanding of black civil rights, and a monument of Las Vegas's past. Although the Moulin Rouge complex remained shuttered for decades, many plans had been hatched to rebuild and reopen the cultural landmark. But on May 29, 2003, a fire gutted the complex. The facade with its signature stylized name was spared destruction. In 2004, a man arrested near the property was sentenced to four years in prison after pleading guilty to one count of arson in connection with the fire. January 2004 saw the Moulin Rouge sold again for $12.1 million to the Moulin Rouge Development Corporation. The stylized \\"Moulin Rouge\\" neon sign was turned back on. A $200 million renovation of the site was announced but was never completed; developers went bankrupt in 2008 and a receiver was appointed for the property. Following a February decision to tear down the structures as a public nuisance, the third fire in four years on May 6, 2009, caused significant damage to the original hotel lobby building, but did not touch the remaining original exterior wall that held the signage. The signage had just been removed for storage at the Neon Museum boneyard. The property, which was in foreclosure at the time of the fire, had failed to sell at a foreclosure auction the day before. In June, 2010, the Las Vegas Historic Preservation Commission approved permits for demolition of the remains of the buildings, citing numerous concerns by the city about the safety of the structures. Instead of demolishing what was left of the hotel wings, which had seemed to catch fire every few years, the city instead demolished the stone exterior wall, pillar, and facade that held the sign. Also destroyed was the landmark tower that stood over the West side and was a symbol to the residents. The tower, which the city claimed was unstable, took nearly half a day of weakening to finally pull down. As of February 2011, the red mosaic pillars still lie in the empty lot, and the unstable, fire hazard hotel wings still stand. In 2017, the receiver awarded Clark County the right to redevelop the Moulin Rouge site, but the county withdrew its bid after an outcry from neighborhood residents over the proposed reuse, a government building. In July 2019 a bid by a local group called Moulin Rouge LLC to develop a new hotel, casino, and convention center complex was accepted; a bid by a rival group also proposes a new casino and hotel.

Currently, Penn Station has over 300 locations in 15 states. History Original logo until 2016 The concept for an East Coast sub restaurant came to Jeff Osterfeld soon after he graduated from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. In 1983, he opened \\"Jeffrey's Delicatessen\\" at the Dayton Mall in Dayton, Ohio. It was during a trip to Philadelphia that he first realized the popularity of the cheesesteak sandwich. He began selling a version of the cheesesteak sandwich at his own restaurant, and it instantly became a huge hit. He eventually expanded to Cincinnati, where he opened his first Penn Station restaurant in 1985. Originally, only four sandwiches were available, including the cheese steak. However, this first restaurant also offered fresh-cut french fries and freshly squeezed lemonade, two items that would become trademarks for Penn Station in the future. By 1987, Osterfeld had opened several Penn Station restaurants in and around Cincinnati. He began selling franchises that year and restaurants soon opened in St. Louis, Louisville, and Nashville. Today, Penn Station has become a large chain across the Midwest with 306 restaurants currently open in 15 states across the United States. With the COVID-19 pandemic that began in mid-March 2020, all restaurants had dealt away with dine-ins and customers make their orders via drive-thru, take-away or pick-up service.

Auguste Pavie, French vice consul in Luang Prabang in 1886, was the chief agent in furthering French interests in Laos. His intrigues, which took advantage of Siamese weakness in the region and periodic invasions by Vietnamese rebels from Tonkin, increased tensions between Bangkok and Paris. Following the conflict, the Siamese agreed to cede Laos to France, an act that led to the significant expansion of French Indochina. This conflict succeeded the Haw wars (1865‚Äì1890), in which the Siamese attempted to pacify northern Siam and Tonkin. Context Punch Magazine cartoon showing the \\"French wolf\\" looking across the Mekong towards the \\"Siamese lamb\\" A cartoon from the British newspaper The Sketch shows a French soldier attacking a Siamese soldier depicted as a harmless wooden figure, reflecting the technological superiority of the French troops. The conflict started when French Indochina's Governor-General Jean de Lanessan sent Auguste Pavie as consul to Bangkok to bring Laos under French rule. The government in Bangkok, mistakenly believing that they would be supported by the British government, refused to concede territory east of the Mekong and instead reinforced their military and administrative presence. Events were brought to a head by two separate incidents when Siamese governors in Khammuan and Nong Khai expelled three French merchants from the middle Mekong in September 1892, two of them, Champenois and Esquilot, on suspicion of opium smuggling. Shortly afterwards, the French consul in Luang Prabang, Victor- Alphonse Massie, feverish and discouraged, committed suicide on his way back to Saigon. Back in France, these incidents were used by the colonial lobby (Parti Colonial) to stir up nationalistic anti-Siamese sentiment, as a pretext for intervention. The death of Massie left Auguste Pavie as the new French Consul. In March 1893 Pavie demanded that the Siamese evacuate all military posts on the east side of the Mekong River south of Khammuan, claiming that the land belonged to Vietnam. To back up these demands, the French sent the gunboat Lutin to Bangkok, where it was moored on the Chao Phraya next to the French legation. Conflict When Siam rejected the French demands, de Lanessan sent three military columns into the disputed region to assert French control in April 1893. Eight small Siamese garrisons west of the Mekong withdrew upon the arrival of the central column, but the advance of the other columns met with resistance. In the north, the French came under siege on the island of Khoung, with the capture of an officer, Thoreaux. In the south the occupation proceeded smoothly until an ambush by the Siamese on the village of Keng Kert resulted in the killing of French police inspector Grosgurin. =Killing of Inspector Grosgurin= Inspector Grosgurin was a French inspector and commander of a Vietnamese militia in Laos. Like Auguste Pavie, he had been engaged in several exploratory expeditions in the region. He was a member of one of the French armed columns dispatched in April 1893 by Lassenan to cross the Annamite Range into the Lao area of Khammuan (modern Thakhek) and to occupy the disputed territory. The column was at first successful in evicting the Siamese commissioner at Khammuan by 25 May. Shortly afterwards on 5 June, the Siamese commissioner organized a surprise ambush on the village of Kien Ket, where Grosgurin, confined to his sickbed, had encamped with his militia. The commissioner had apparently been instructed by Siamese government representatives to \\"compel their [French troops] retirement, by fighting, if necessary, to the utmost of their strength\\". The ambush resulted in the razing of the village and the killing of Grosgurin and 17 Vietnamese.The Peoples and Politics of the Far East (1895) by Sir Henry Norman, p.480-481 The incident and the death of Grosgurin became known as the \\"Affair of Kham Muon (Kien Chek)\\" and was ultimately used as a pretext for strong French intervention. =Paknam incident= As a result France demanded reparations and tensions with the British over control of Siam came to a peak.Chandran Jeshurun, The British foreign office and the Siamese-Malay states 1890-97. Cambridge (1971) pp 112, 113. The British sent three navy ships to the mouth of the Chao Phraya, in case evacuation of British citizens became necessary. In turn the French went one step further in July 1893 by ordering two of their ships, the sloop Inconstant and the gunboat Com√®te, to sail up the Chao Phraya towards Bangkok, without the permission of the Siamese. They came under fire from the fort at Paknam on 13 July 1893. The French returned fire and forced their way to Bangkok. With guns trained on the Grand Palace in Bangkok, the French delivered an ultimatum to the Siamese on 20 July to hand over the territory east of the Mekong and withdraw their garrisons there, to pay an indemnity of three million francs in reparation for the fighting at Paknam, and to punish those responsible for the killings in the disputed territory. When Siam did not immediately comply unconditionally to the ultimatum, the French blockaded the Siamese coast. In the end the Siamese submitted fully to the French conditions after finding no support from the British. In addition, the French demanded as guarantees the temporary occupation of Chantaburi and the demilitarization of Battambang, Siem Reap and a -wide zone on the west bank of the Mekong. The conflict led to the signature of the Franco-Siamese Treaty, on 3 October 1893. =Franco-Siamese trial= Following the killing of Grosgurin, the Commissioner of the Kammuon District, Phra Yot, was acknowledged by his government to have been the responsible official, although he was initially acquitted of wrongdoing in a trial in March 1894. A \\"Franco-Siamese Mixed Court\\" was subsequently convened in June 1894. The court determined that Phra Yot had brought extra forces to surround the house in Kien Ket occupied by the ill Grosgurin, outnumbering his small Vietnamese militia; that Grosgurin and those Vietnamese who had not managed to escape had been killed and the house subsequently set on fire on the orders of Phra Yot. In a joint agreement between the Siamese and the French, Phra Yot was condemned to 20 years of penal servitude. The solicitor for the defense was the Ceylonese lawyer William Alfred Tilleke, who was later appointed Attorney General of Siam and granted a peerage by the king. The Royal Thai Army fort Phra Yot Muang Khwan in Nakhon Phanom Province on the border between Thailand and Laos commemorates Phra Yot. Consequences The Siamese agreed to cede Laos to France, significantly expanding French Indochina. In 1896, France signed a treaty with Britain defining the border between Laos and British territory in Upper Burma. The Kingdom of Laos became a protectorate, initially placed under the Governor General of Indochina in Hanoi. Pavie, who almost single-handedly brought Laos under French rule, saw to the officialization in Hanoi. The French and British both had strong interests in controlling parts of Indochina. Twice in the 1890s, they were on the verge of war over two different routes leading to Yunnan. But several difficulties discouraged them from war. The geography of the land made troop movements difficult, making warfare more costly and less effective. Both countries were fighting a difficult conflict within their respective colonies. Malaria was common and deadly. Ultimately, the imagined trade routes never really came into use. In 1904, the French and the British put aside their many differences with the Entente Cordiale, ending this dispute in southeastern Asia. France continued to occupy Chanthaburi and Trat up until 1907, when Siam ceded to it the provinces of Battambang, Siem Reap and Sisophon.

History Founded as part of the Prime Minister's office by Prime Minister Moshe Sharett in 1952‚Äì1953, Nativ was designed to function covertly, making contacts, fostering Jewish education, and aiding immigration to Israel. Nativ was not the first organization to do this; Mossad Le'aliyah Bet, part of the Haganah, had brought Jews to Israel in defiance of the British Mandate, but this ended with the creation of Israel. Nativ was to continue that mission, except now in defiance of the Soviet Union. Although it operated in a clandestine manner, the official policy was never to break Soviet laws.Levin 64. This did not stop the KGB from suspecting that it was spying. In fact, as recently as 1998 Nativ was accused of conducting espionage operations.\\"Russia claims Israeli spy ring smashed\\", BBC World Service. A former Israeli ambassador to Moscow claims that the KGB conducted exhaustive surveillance measures on all their operations, but never directly interfered.Levin 64‚Äì65. Nativ began its foreign operations out of Israeli embassies, yet this ended after the Six-Day War, when Russia and fellow Soviet countries severed diplomatic ties with Israel. This led Nativ to focus more of its efforts on Western countries, where it lobbied governments to promote greater emigration freedom in the USSR with the phrase \\"Let My People Go\\". While its Soviet operations were stymied, the Refusenik movement began, bringing greater international attention to the Soviet emigration issue. Nativ assisted the movement by materially supporting the refuseniks and fostering refusenik organizations. In the mid 1970s international pressure forced the Soviet Union to allow greater emigration, and the number of Soviet Jews leaving for Israel increased dramatically. The dissolution of the Soviet Union ended the need to conduct operations clandestinely, and today Lishkat Hakesher openly runs Jewish clubs and education services in Russia. It is also tasked with issuing visas and processing immigrants coming to Israel under the Law of Return. However, it has recently faced budget and personnel cuts, immigrant backlogs, and pressure to close from groups including the Mossad and Shin Bet. As of November 2006, Nativ had 60 employees and a budget of approximately 11.6 million USD.Melman, Yossi and Barkat, Amiram. \\"From Russia with Jews\\", Haaretz, November 9, 2006. Retrieved November 23, 2006. When Kadima formed a coalition government with Yisrael Beiteinu, Nativ was moved from the Prime Minister's Office to the Ministry of Strategic Affairs.Lieberman seeks to encourage aliyah of Russian Jews from Canada In February 2007, Avigdor Liberman, the Minister of Strategic Affairs and a Russian emigre, proposed that Lishkat Hakesher move into new operations among Russian Jews who emigrated to the United States, Canada, and Germany.\\"Israel considers new campaign among Jews\\", UPI, February 5, 2007. Retrieved February 15, 2007. Under Liberman's leadership, Nativ's Operation Germany attempted to convince ethnic Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union to emigrate from Germany to Israel. However, with his resignation in January 2008, plans of placing two Nativ employees in Germany are not likely to be carried out. Organization =Head= As of 2005, the only requirements to lead Lishkat Hakesher were the ability to speak Russian and experience in managing bureaucracies. Headquartered in Tel Aviv, the director reports directly to the prime minister. All Nativ representatives in foreign countries report to the director, and are not responsible to the local diplomats. Representatives are supposed to inform the local ambassador of their activities, though failure to do this has caused tension in the past.Levin 175.

Course  The Piva emerges from the Sinjac wellspring (Cyrillic: –°–∏—ö–∞—Ü; etymologically sinjac is derivative of sinji/sinje/sinja, rooted in proto-slavic, and means having a blue tinge, bluish color, gray, gray-blue, so Sinjac could be translated in modern ), which is also simply called Wellspring of Piva (; Cyrillic: –í—Ä–µ–ª–æ –ü–∏–≤–µ), situated near the Piva Monastery underneath of Golija mountain. After a kilometer or so, and before the artificial Lake Piva was formed, the waters from the well rushed into the river Komarnica (Cyrillic: –ö–æ–º–∞—Ä–Ω–∏—Ü–∞) thus creating the Piva river for the next 34 km. However, Komarnica is part of an 86 km long river system (Tu≈°ina‚ÜíBukovica‚ÜíKomarnica), so measured from the source of the Tu≈°ina river (Cyrillic: –¢—É—à–∏–Ω–∞), the Piva, nicknamed 'the river with five names', is 120 km long. Bridge over the Piva river, canyon just downstream from Mratinje dam Piva river, canyon view from the same bridge (above photo) The Tu≈°ina originates from the mountain Sinjajevina in the Uskoci region of central Montenegro, just few kilometers away from the source of another important Montenegrin river, Moraƒça. The river flows to the west, between the Sinjajevina and Lola mountains, next to the villages of Krnja Jela, Bare, Boan and Tu≈°ina. It receives from the north the Bukovica river (Cyrillic: –ë—É–∫–æ–≤–∏—Ü–∞), and continues further under this name. After the river passes the regional center of ≈†avnik and the villages of Gradac and Pridvorica in the region of Drobnjaci, the stream receives from the north the Komarnica and takes its name. The Komarnica continues between the mountains of Vojnik and Treskavac, in an almost uninhabited area (village of Du≈æi) and enters the high Piva Pleateau, where it turns north (almost all of the Komarnica's course is flooded by the reservoir of the Lake Piva), receives from the right outflow of the Piva well and enters the deep Piva canyon. The canyon is cut between the mountains of Bioƒç, Volujak, Magliƒá and Pivska planina, its 33 km long, deep up to 1.200 m and river generates immense power used for the power station of Mratinje (342 MW) which dammed the canyon in 1975. The dam is 220 m high, one of the highest in Europe and creates Lake Piva, third largest in Serbia and Montenegro (12,5 km¬≤, altitude 675 m, 188 m deep), which flooded the old location of the monastery of Piva from the 16th century, so the monastery was moved to the new one. The Vrbnica river flows from the left into the lake. After the dam, the Piva continues straight to the north, meets the Tara at ≈†ƒáepan Polje on the border with Bosnia and Herzegovina and creates the Drina. The Piva belongs to the Black Sea drainage basin with its own drainage area of 1,784 km¬≤ and is not navigable.  Piva Plateau  Pivska povr≈° (Cyrillic: –ü–∏–≤—Å–∫–∞ –ø–æ–≤—Ä—à), is a high limestone plateau in the drainage area of Piva, between the mountains of Durmitor, Magliƒá, Lebr≈°nik, Golija and Vojnik. The plateau is 55 km long, 30 km wide with an average altitude of 1.200 m, the highest 2.159 m. The flow of Komarnica-Piva divides it in two regions: western one, Pivska ≈Ωupa (Cyrillic: –ü–∏–≤—Å–∫–∞ –ñ—É–ø–∞) and eastern one, Pivska planina (Cyrillic: –ü–∏–≤—Å–∫–∞ –ø–ª–∞–Ω–∏–Ω–∞). Area is characterized by many limestone features, like cavities (called vrtaƒça, –≤—Ä—Ç–∞—á–∞) deep pits and excavations, and extremely sparsely populated (some 20 smaller settlements in Pivska ≈Ωupa and 15 in Pivska planina). Stock breeding is developed though, especially sheep.  See also  * Tara (Drina) * Drina  References  * Mala Prosvetina Enciklopedija, Third edition (1985); Prosveta; * Jovan ƒê.

The novel spent one week atop The New York Times Best Seller List (on the list dated October 15, 1967), and was Uris's first New York Times number-one bestseller since Exodus in 1959. During its 52-week run on the list, Topaz set two records in two weeks; those for largest positional jump to number-one (9-1) and largest positional fall from number-one (1-5). Overview On the eve of the Cuban Missile Crisis, American and French intelligence agents are plunged into a maze of Cold War intrigue. In Paris, 1962, French intelligence chief Andr√© Devereaux and NATO intelligence chief Michael Nordstrom have uncovered Soviet plans to ship nuclear arms to Cuba. But when Devereaux reports his findings and nobody acts‚Äîand he is targeted in an assassination attempt‚Äîhe soon realizes he‚Äôs tangled in a plot far greater than he first understood. The two agents, along with a small band of Cuban exiles and Soviet defectors, chase leads around the globe in a quest to save NATO, themselves, and perhaps the world itself. Film adaptation In 1969, Universal Pictures released Alfred Hitchcock's Topaz, based on the Uris novel. It was a critical and commercial failure. Basis in fact The events in Topaz are based to a limited degree on the Martel affair, which involved a Soviet defector, Anatoliy Golitsyn, who indicated there were deep KGB penetrations within the French establishment. This was taking place during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the actions of one French agent in gathering information in Cuba became swept up in the events.

The series was created by Chad Hodge and was produced by Golly and Darren Star Productions in association with Sony Pictures Television. Along with The Game, it was one of only two series on the new network not to be inherited as previously aired from either of its predecessor networks, The WB and UPN. The show was officially cancelled on October 18, 2006. Synopsis Runaway chronicles the life of the Hollands, an average middle-class American family who just moved to Bridgewater, Iowa, ostensibly from New Orleans, Louisiana, following the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Despite appearing to be just a normal family looking for a change of scenery, the Hollands are actually the Raders, a family from Potomac, Maryland who are secretly on the run from the law after Paul Rader, the family patriarch, was convicted for a murder that he didn't commit and subsequently jumped bail. Not only that, but the Raders are also hunted by the real killer who had made good on targeting the family, especially their three children. These reasons are enough for Paul (similar to the plot line of The Fugitive) to seek the evidence that will clear his name and end his family's nightmare. Characters =Main= * Paul Rader/Jim Holland (Donnie Wahlberg) is the patriarch of the family, and a successful attorney. He was wrongfully accused of the murder of Erin Baxter, a beautiful young associate in his law firm, which he believes was connected to a secret investigation she was conducting. The real killer's next move is to go after his three children, so Paul must relocate them while also trying to stay a step ahead of the law enforcement agents pursuing him. * Lily Rader/Brenda Holland (Leslie Hope) is the wife and mother of the family who previously owned an art gallery near their former home in Maryland. * Henry Rader/Jason Holland (Dustin Milligan) is the elder son in the family, a high school sophomore. He misses his girlfriend Kylie in Maryland and sometimes takes rash risks in order to try and communicate with her. * Hannah Rader/Kate Holland (Sarah Ramos) is the only daughter in the family, also a high school sophomore, who seems to be the only one who prefers the possibility of creating a new life where she isn't the social outcast she was back in Maryland. * Tommy Rader/Michael \\"Mikey\\" Holland (Nathan Gamble) is the younger son of the family, eight years old. As the youngest, it is the most difficult for him to keep his lies straight. * Angela Huntley (Karen LeBlanc) is the lead investigator assigned to the Raders' case and is considered one of the best agents in the U.S. Marshals Service. * Gina Bennett (Susan Floyd) is the Raders' local realtor, a single mother with a law school education who helps the Raders in their new lives. =Recurring= * Jake Bennett (Craig Olejnik), Gina's only son, who is seen in the first episode taking an instant dislike to Henry and making his life at school difficult. The family eventually finds out that he and his mother have been on the run from his abusive father, and are also using assumed identities to hide. * Brady Sullivan (Andrew Lawrence), the son of the Raders' neighbors Bob and Mary Sullivan and a potential new love interest for Hannah. * Amber (Leah Renee Cudmore), Hannah's new friend and the leader of the popular clique whom also happens to be Brady's girlfriend, complicating Hannah's developing feelings toward the boy. * Sam (Melanie Merkosky), Henry's new friend who often defends him from Jake and assists him and Hannah into 'fitting in' at Bridgewater. * Susie (Niamh Wilson), Tommy's classmate at school who consistently antagonizes him until he is forced to save her amidst a deadly tornado. * Kylie (Kristen Hager), Henry's girlfriend back in Maryland whom he misses dearly and will do anything in the world to be with, even if it means endangering the safeties of himself and his family. * Agent Raj Rao (Raoul Bhaneja), Huntley's quick-witted partner in the U.S. Marshals who doesn't take her determination to apprehend the Rader family seriously. * Tannen (Aaron Abrams), a former associate of Paul's who may hold the key to solving Erin's murder. * Erin (Sandrine Holt), Paul's co-worker, mistress, and the victim of a brutal murder wrongfully attributed to Paul. * Lloyd Cunningham (Craig Eldridge), Paul's defense attorney.

The heavy metal singer Udo Dirkschneider produced a song called Tallyman. Vote counter In Ireland, it is common for political parties to provide private observers when ballot boxes are opened. These tallymen keep a tally of the preferences of visible voting papers and allow an early initial estimate of which candidates are likely to win in the drawn-out single transferable vote counting process. Since the public voting process is by then complete, it is usual for tallymen from different parties to share information. Head counter Another possible definition is a person who called to literally do a head count, presumably on behalf of either the town council or the house owners. This is rumoured to have occurred in Liverpool, in the years after the First World War. Mechanical tally counters can make such head counts easier, by removing the need to make any marks. Debt collector In poorer parts of England (including the north and the East End of London), the tallyman was the hire purchase collector, who visited each week to collect the payments for goods purchased on the 'never never', or hire purchase. These people still had such employment up until the 1960s. The title tallyman extended to the keeper of a village pound as animals were often held against debts, and tally sticks were used to prove they could be released.

The station's thrice-yearly fund drives have a goal of one million dollars each as of 2013.

Anode circuits Since valves are designed to operate with much higher resistive loads than solid state devices, the most common anode circuit is a tuned LC circuit where the anodes are connected at a voltage node. This circuit is often known as the anode tank circuit. Grid circuits =Active (or tuned grid) = Simple tetrode based design using a tuned grid input An example of this used at VHF/UHF could include the 4CX250B; an example of a twin tetrode would be the QQV06/40A. The tetrode has a screen grid which is between the anode and the first grid. This is grounded at the operating frequency, but carries a DC potential, normally 10 to 50% of the plate voltage. The screen grid serves to increase the stage gain while also providing shielding which increases the stability of the circuit by reducing the effective capacitance between the first grid and the anode. For very high gain circuits, the shielding effect of the screen may not be sufficient to prevent all coupling from the plate back to the grid. Even a small amount of feedback may cause tuning difficulties and perhaps even self oscillation. Coupling of energy from the output back into the input can also occur due to poor circuit layout. It is therefore often necessary to add a neutralization circuit, which feeds some of the output signal back to the input with proper amplitude and opposite phase so as to cancel out the above-mentioned undesirable effects. In common with all three basic designs shown here the anode of the valve is connected to an LC circuit to tune the plate circuit to resonance. Power may be coupled to the antenna via an additional inductive link as shown. More commonly modern circuits use a Pi network to resonate the plate circuit and match it to the antenna while also reducing harmonics. =How it works= For a fixed anode voltage the anode current of a triode can be described by the following equation Ianode = {K1.(Egrid-N1)} + {K2.(Egrid¬≤-N2)} + {K3.(Egrid¬≥-N3)} etc. For a tetrode the equation will be: Ianode = {K1grid1.(Egrid1-N1grid1)} + {K2grid1.(Egrid1¬≤-N2grid1)} + {K3grid1.(Egrid1¬≥-N3grid1)} etc. + {K1grid2.(Egrid2-N1grid2)} + {K2grid2.(Egrid2¬≤-N2grid2)} + {K3grid2.(Egrid2¬≥-N3grid2)} ... etc. Note that the K constants for the second grid are smaller than those of the first grid because the second grid is further away from the cathode. As the second grid (screen grid) in a tetrode is maintained at a constant potential the equation for the tetrode can be reduced back to that of the triode as long as the screen grid is kept at the same potential. In short the anode current is controlled by the electrical potential (voltage) of the first grid. A DC bias is applied to the valve to ensure that the part of the transfer equation which is most suitable to the required application is used. The input signal is able to perturb (change) the potential of the grid, and this in turn will change the anode current. Another term for the anode in a valve is the plate so hence on many designs the anode current is named the plate current. In the RF designs shown on this page between the anode and the high voltage supply (known by convention as B+) is a tuned circuit. This tuned circuit has been brought to resonance, and in a class A design can be thought of as a resistance. This is because a resistive load is coupled to the tuned circuit. In audio amplifiers the resistive load (loudspeaker) is coupled via a transformer to the amplifier. In short the load formed by the loudspeaker driven via the transformer can be thought of as a resistor wired between the valves anode and B+. As the current flowing through the anode connection is controlled by the grid, then the current flowing through the load is also controlled by the grid. One of the disadvantages of a tuned grid compared to other RF designs is the neutralization is required. Passive grid simple tetrode based design using a passive grid input An example of a passive grid used at VHF/UHF frequencies include the 4CX250B; an example of a twin tetrode would be the QQV06/40A. The tetrode has a screen grid which is between the anode and the first grid, the purpose of the screen grid is to increase the stability of the circuit by reducing the capacitance between the first grid and the anode. The combination of the effects of the screen grid and the damping resistor often allow the use of this design without neutralization. The signals come into the circuit through a capacitor, they are then applied to the valve's first grid directly. The value of the grid resistor determines the gain of the amplifier stage. The higher the resistor the greater the gain, the lower the damping effect and the greater the risk of instability. With this type of stage good layout is less vital. Passive grid design is ideal for audio equipment, because audio equipment must be more broadband than RF equipment. A RF device might be required to operate over the range 144 to 146 MHz (1.4% of an octave) while an audio amp might be required to operate over the range 20 Hz to 20 kHz, a range of three orders of magnitude. =Advantages= *Stable, no neutralizing required normally *Constant load on the exciting stage =Disadvantages= *Low gain, more input power is required *Less gain than tuned grid *Less filtering than tuned grid (more broadband), hence the amplification of out of band spurious signals, such as harmonics, from an exciter is greater Grounded grid Simple triode based design using cathode input This design uses a triode. The grid current drawn in this system is higher than that required for the other two basic designs. Because of this, valves such as the 4CX250B are not suitable for this circuit. This circuit design has been used at 1296 MHz using disk seal triode valves such as the 2C39A. The grid is kept at ground potential, and drive is applied to the cathode through a capacitor. The heater supply must be isolated with great care from the cathode as unlike the other designs, the cathode is not connected to RF ground. The cathode may be at the same DC potential as the grid if a valve such as the 811A (zero bias triode) is used, otherwise the cathode must be positive with respect to the grid to provide proper bias. This may be done by putting a zener diode between the cathode and ground, or by connecting a suitable power supply to the cathode. =Advantages= *Stable, neutralizing not normally required *Some of the power from exciting stage appears in the output (no phase inversion) =Disadvantages= *Very low gain, much more input power is required *The heater must be isolated from ground with chokes Category:Valve amplifiers ","title":"Valve transmitters"},{"id":"5052350","text":"The northwest heroon at Sagalassos, Turkey. A hero√∂n or heroon (plural heroa) (; , pl. ), also latinized as heroum, is a shrine dedicated to an ancient Greek or Roman hero and used for the commemoration or cult worship of the hero. They were often erected over his or her supposed tomb or cenotaph. Description The Romans and the Greeks practised an extensive and widespread cult of heroes. Heroes played a central role in the life of a polis, giving the city a shared focus for its identity. The cult typically centred on the hero√∂n in which the hero's bones were usually believed to be contained. In a sense, the hero was considered still to be alive; he was offered meals and was imagined to be sharing feasts. His allegiance was seen as vitally important to the continued well-being of the city. This led to struggles between Greek cities for control of heroic remains. Greek literature records how Cimon of Athens avenged the death of the legendary hero Theseus in 469 BC, finding a set of bones allegedly belonging to the hero and returning with them in triumph to Athens. Similarly, Herodotus records in his Histories that the Spartans raided the hero√∂n of the city of Tegea, stealing the bones of Orestes. This was regarded as changing the hero's allegiance from Tegea to Sparta, ensuring that the Spartans could defeat the Tegeans as foretold by the Oracle of Delphi. (For an analogous practice in ancient Rome, see evocatio). Hero√∂n at Paestum, uncovered in 1952 Many examples of heroa can be found around the tholos tombs of Mycenaean Greece and in or near the sacred areas of a number of Greek cities around the Mediterranean. A particularly well- preserved example, the so-called Tomb of Theron, can be found at Agrigento in Sicily. The Greek city of Paestum, south of Naples, has an unlooted heroon of an unknown figure, perhaps the city founder, with its contents intact (now in the museum there), including large metal vases. Another notable one, at Vergina in Greek Macedonia (the ancient city of Aigai - Œë·º∞Œ≥Œ±ŒØ), is thought to have been dedicated to the worship of the family of Alexander the Great and may have housed the cult statue of Alexander's father, Philip II of Macedon. The sanctuary of Zeus in Nemea also contains a hero√∂n, this one dedicated to the infant hero Opheltes. The hero√∂n at Nemea was known as a popular place to practice magic due to the nature of Opheltes' death. A well-preserved Roman hero√∂n from the Augustan period is situated in the ancient city of Sagalassos in what is now Turkey. Another well-preserved and well-known hero√∂n is the Library of Celsus in Ephesus, Turkey. It was built to honor a Roman senator, Tiberius Julius Celsus Polemaeanus, a consul and proconsul of Asia from 92 to 107 and governor of Asia when he died in 114. He bequeathed a large sum of money for its construction which was carried out by his son. Apart from the library in Alexandria, Egypt, it was one of the largest libraries of the ancient world. The erroneously-named Tomb of Theron, a hero√∂n at Agrigento, Sicily.  Early examples of heroa  The first examples of heroa in Greece were found at Late Bronze Age sites from the Mycenaean civilization. These tombs were built much like other tombs during the time, either as a shaft tomb (grave shaft) filled with elaborate grave goods, or as a tholos tomb (beehive tomb), a type of chamber tomb. In an untouched example of a Mycenaean hero√∂n found in Pylos, the grave shaft-style tomb was dedicated to a \\"Griffin Warrior\\" whose votive objects include a mix of Mycenaean and Minoan objects. This grave group includes a large bronze sword, gold rings, jewels, and crafted seals. This shows that the Griffin Warrior Tomb might be an example of Mycenaean interaction with other areas of Greece.  Lefkandi hero√∂n  The tradition of building tombs to honor heroes continued from Mycenae into other areas of Greece. This can be seen by the hero√∂n found at Lefkandi in Euboea. This site dates to around 950 BC during the Iron Age. This site differs from earlier sites, as it was built in an apsidal style. This means that one end of the tomb was shaped like a half-circle. In addition, the site is much larger than previous tombs as it reaches up to 50 meters long. The inside of this hero√∂n contains two human remains, which have been cremated and placed in bronze amphoras. One of these remains is the hero himself, who can be identified by the hunting scene found on his amphora, as well as the many swords that were left by his tomb as grave gifts. The other set of human remains at this site is believed to be the hero's wife, who possibly was slaughtered with him when the hero died.  Olympian hero√∂n  This idea of using a tholos tomb for heroa continued in Greece even into the Classical Age. This is illustrated by a hero√∂n found at the Panhellenic Sanctuary of Olympia. This tomb, which was established around 450 B.C., follows the typical tholos tomb structure with a large dome with several other rooms flanking the tomb to provide the building with a square shape. Within the tomb, there is a large earthen mound that held the ashes of the cremated hero. This tomb must is likely to have been erected for an important figure that was known across Greece, as it was located at a Panhellenic Sanctuary rather than in the astu of a particular polis. This hero√∂n also shows the wide variety of architectural styles used on heroa depending on time period and geography, as it differs considerably from the heroa found at Leftkandi and Acragas.  Heroa in the colonies  Heroa were common not only on the Greek mainland but also in the colonies. This can be seen at the hero√∂n of Acragas on the south coast of Italy. This hero√∂n, known as the oratory of Phalaris, was much more similar to classical architecture, with the building being prostyle, tetrastyle, and having columns in the Ionic order and both triglyphs and metopes, as in the Doric style. The building was constructed in 1st century B. C. and is surrounded by many other Greek temples. It was used as a church for a time after the end of the Greek and Roman periods.  Association with hero cults  Heroa sites were often linked to hero cults, due to the variety of different uses for hero cults that they provided. They acted as places of worship, where cult followers could leave grave goods and other worship offerings, and were used as locations where feasts could be held to honor the hero and remember the hero's great feats. These events occurred primarily because of the Greek belief of heroes possessing special abilities that lingered locally even when he died, and it was believed that offerings and worship towards this hero would allow living cult members to tap into this power.

The Arte della Lana was the wool guild of Florence during the Late Middle Ages and in the Renaissance. It was one of the seven Arti Maggiori (\\"greater trades\\") of Florence, separate from the Arti Minori (the \\"lesser trades\\") and the Arti Mediane (the \\"middle trades\\"). The Arte della Lana dealt in woollen cloth and cooperated with the other corporations of bankers and merchants in administering the commune, both under the podest√† and the Republic of Florence.  History  At the height of the industry the Arte della Lana directly employed 30.000 workers and indirectly about a third of Florence's population, and produced 100,000 lengths of cloth annually. The Arte della Lana saw all the processes from the raw baled wool through the final cloth, woven at numerous looms scattered in domiciles throughout the city. Like other guilds, the Arte served only to coordinate the activities of its own members, who did not generally own the means of production or directly manage the processes. Its syndics ensured that quality standards were met and contracts were honored. The predecessor and until the mid-14th century the rival of the Arte della Lana was the powerful Arte di Calimala, a corporation of importers of raw cloth, who dyed and finished it. The guildhall, the Palazzo dell‚Äô Arte della Lana, was completed in 1308, with an attached fortifiable tower-house. From its interior, where some 14th- century frescoes remain, a gallery designed by Bernardo Buontalenti links the palazzo with the church of Orsanmichele.

When the calibrated components are a parallel resistor and capacitor, the bridge is known as a Maxwell-Wien bridge. It is named for James C. Maxwell, who first described it in 1873. It uses the principle that the positive phase angle of an inductive impedance can be compensated by the negative phase angle of a capacitive impedance when put in the opposite arm and the circuit is at resonance; i.e., no potential difference across the detector (an AC voltmeter or ammeter)) and hence no current flowing through it. The unknown inductance then becomes known in terms of this capacitance. With reference to the picture, in a typical application R_1 and R_4 are known fixed entities, and R_2 and C_2 are known variable entities. R_2 and C_2 are adjusted until the bridge is balanced. R_3 and L_3 can then be calculated based on the values of the other components: :\\\\begin{align} R_3 &= \\\\frac{R_1 \\\\cdot R_4}{R_2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ L_3 &= R_1 \\\\cdot R_4 \\\\cdot C_2 \\\\end{align} To avoid the difficulties associated with determining the precise value of a variable capacitance, sometimes a fixed-value capacitor will be installed and more than one resistor will be made variable. It cannot be used for the measurement of high Q values. It is also unsuited for the coils with low Q values, less than one, because of balance convergence problem. Its use is limited to the measurement of low Q values from 1 to 10. :Q = \\\\frac{\\\\omega L}{R} The frequency of the AC current used to assess the unknown inductor should match the frequency of the circuit the inductor will be used in - the impedance and therefore the assigned inductance of the component varies with frequency. For ideal inductors, this relationship is linear, so that the inductance value at an arbitrary frequency can be calculated from the inductance value measured at some reference frequency. Unfortunately, for real components, this relationship is not linear, and using a derived or calculated value in place of a measured one can lead to serious inaccuracies. A practical issue in construction of the bridge is mutual inductance: two inductors in propinquity will give rise to mutual induction: when the magnetic field of one intersects the coil of the other, it will reinforce the magnetic field in that other coil, and vice versa, distorting the inductance of both coils. To minimize mutual inductance, orient the inductors with their axes perpendicular to each other, and separate them as far as is practical. Similarly, the nearby presence of electric motors, chokes and transformers (like that in the power supply for the bridge!) may induce mutual inductance in the circuit components, so locate the circuit remotely from any of these. The frequency dependence of inductance values gives rise to other constraints on this type of bridge: the calibration frequency must be well below the lesser of the self-resonance frequency of the inductor and the self-resonance frequency of the capacitor, Fr < min(Lsrf,Csrf)/10. Before those limits are approached, the ESR of the capacitor will likely have significant effect, and have to be explicitly modeled. For ferromagnetic core inductors, there are additional constraints. There is a minimum magnetization current required to magnetize the core of an inductor, so the current in the inductor branches of the circuit must exceed the minimum, but must not be so great as to saturate the core of either inductor. The additional complexity of using a Maxwell-Wien bridge over simpler bridge types is warranted in circumstances where either the mutual inductance between the load and the known bridge entities, or stray electromagnetic interference, distorts the measurement results. The capacitive reactance in the bridge will exactly oppose the inductive reactance of the load when the bridge is balanced, allowing the load's resistance and reactance to be reliably determined.

He was principally active in Rome, in the service of the Papal Chapel, and was one of the judges at the famous debate between Nicola Vicentino and Vicente Lusitano in 1551. Life He was born in Tholen, in Zeeland, but nothing is known of his early life. Like many of his contemporaries from the Low Countries, he may have received his early training in his homeland, going to Italy as a young adult. In his manuscript treatise Sopra una differentia musicale sententiata he asserts that he was employed by Pierluigi Carafa, member of an aristocratic family in Naples. He was admitted as a singer at the Papal Chapel 21 March 1538, a position he retained, seemingly without break, until 1565. In August 1565 he was forced to retire from the papal chapel as part of a reorganization and reduction in size which followed from the reforms of the Council of Trent. The entry in the chapel records for his dismissal includes the notice: \\"he is without voice, he is given to women, is excessively rich, and is useless because of illness.\\" He was granted a monthly pension of six ducats and remains in the lists among the \\"second class\\" singers from October 1565 - November 1567.Richard Sherr, Capsulae biographies of papal singers Music, writings, and influence A few works of Danckerts have survived, but no complete publications. One motet which survives in manuscript is an eight- voice setting of Laetamini in domino; two other motets, for six and five voices, Suscipe verbum and Tu es vas electionis, were destroyed in the Allied bombing of Treviso on April 7, 1944, during World War II. Other surviving works include several madrigals and puzzle canons, two of which are included in Pietro Cerone's El Melopeo y maestro (Naples, 1613). An autograph manuscript source containing sacred music, like as a Salve Regina, a Magnificat, a Mass (Missa de Beata Virgine), some hymns and motets, probably composed by Danckerts, has recently come to light.A. Morelli, \\"Una nuova fonte per la musica di Ghiselino Danckerts 'musico e cantore cappellano della cappella del papa¬ª'\\", Recercare, xxi (2009), pp. 75-110 (English version: \\"A new source for the music of Ghiselin Danckerts, ‚Äòmusico e cantore cappellano della cappella del papa‚Äô\\", Tijdschrift van de Koninklijke Vereniging voor Nederlandse Muziekgeschiedenis, lxiv/1-2 (2014), pp. 47-75. While relatively little of Danckerts' music has survived, his contemporary reputation as a composer and theorist was strong enough for him to be selected as one of the judges at the renowned Vicentino-Lusitano debate, and it is for his participation in this, and his subsequent writings on it and related topics, that he is best known. The judges, including Danckerts, ruled Lusitano the winner. As a result of the debate, Vicentino published his famous treatise L'antica musica ridotta alla moderna prattica (1555), and Danckerts replied with his treatise Sopra una differentia musica sententiata, which however remained unpublished. The treatise by Danckerts exists in three versions. The first was probably written in 1551, and Danckerts seems to have revised it twice: once around 1555 and once around 1559 or 1560. Its importance to music history is as a document by a performing musician, with strong conservative views, who documented contemporary practice in some areas ‚Äì for example in interpretation of accidentals ‚Äì where documentation is relatively scanty. One of the chapters in his treatise contains an account of a dispute between two singers in the papal choir over the correct application of accidentals to polyphonic parts which, as was normal at the time, contained none. Danckerts also wrote on the use of chromaticism, generally derisively, and opposed attempts to add modes to the current eight-mode system, for example as described by Glareanus in his 1547 publication, the Dodecachordon, which proposed the twelve modes, including the major and minor scales familiar in the present day. Artusi used portions of Danckerts' treatise in his reactionary 1600 publication Imperfettioni della musica moderna, which he wrote as an attack on Monteverdi.

In rowing, oars are used to propel the boat. Oars differ from paddles in that they use a fixed fulcrum, an oarlock or rowlock attached to the side of the boat, to transfer power from the handle to the blade, rather than using the athlete's shoulders or hands as the pivot-point as in canoeing and kayaking. When the rower uses one oar on one side, it is called sweep rowing that the single oar is called a \\"sweep\\" oar. When the rower uses two oars at the same time, one on each side, it is called sculling, and the two oars are called a pair of \\"sculls\\". Typical sculls are around 284 cm - 290 cm in length  sweep oars are 370 cm - 376 cm. A scull has a smaller blade area, as each rower wields a pair of them at any one time, operating each with one hand. Since the 1980s many oars have been adjustable in length. The shaft of the oar ends with a thin flat surface 40 to 50 cm long and 25 cm wide, variously called the blade or spoon.

Blade shapes =Cleaver= The most common shape now seen is the \\"cleaver\\" (also called \\"hatchet\\"), which is used almost universally. Cleaver blades are asymmetrical, with a somewhat rectangular shape resembling a meat cleaver, hence the name. The shaft of a cleaver blade connects to the blade offset to the top corner of the blade. The shape of the face and the offset connection is designed to maximize the surface area of the blade in contact with the water during the rowing stroke, while also minimizing the amount and depth of the shaft that is submerged and contributing to drag. As the cleaver blade is asymmetrical it may only be used on one side of the boat or the other. Cleaver blade designs were first developed by Dick and Pete Dreissigacker in 1991. They are now manufactured by most major rowing oar suppliers, including Concept 2 and Croker. There have been three major types of blades used over the past century. Oars have generally become shorter, and blade area has been increased. =Macon= Some clubs use the older \\"macon\\" style blades (also called \\"spoons\\" or \\"tulips\\" or \\"shovels\\") for novice crews, usually to develop the basic technique of the rower without the extra complexity of a cleaver blade. A minority of coaches favor macons, but it has been generally accepted since their introduction in 1992 that cleavers give a speed advantage over macons under most conditions. Macon blades are symmetrical, with an elliptical shape and a ridgeline running down the center of the blade face. The blade is squared off at the end. Despite the blade being symmetrical, modern asymmetrical collars or aesthetic issues regarding decorative paint on the blade face may dictate which side of the boat the blade can be rowed on. Macon blades achieved prominence at the 1959 European Championship in M√¢con when they were used by the West German national team. West Germany won all the male sweep events that year, except the coxless four. =Square= Prior to the development of the macon blade a longer, thinner shape was used, known as \\"square\\" blades or \\"standard\\" blades. They are still occasionally used in training for technique. The development from standard to cleaver, via the macon, is therefore a progression from long, thin blades to shorter, wider ones. In each case there has been a reduction in the area of the blade that actually moves the wrong way through the water: in practice a point of the blade remains stationary relative to the water, with the portion outboard of that point providing drive, and the area inboard of it providing drag. Shorter, wider blades place this pivot point closer to the blade's neck, reducing the area dragging in the water.

He is regarded as one of the leading bowlers of his generation and his list of achievements include appearing at eight Commonwealth Games and winning two gold medals and eight World Bowls Championship gold medals. Early life Wood took up bowls at the age of 12, perhaps unsurprisingly as his father, grandfather and mother all played the sport. With little else to occupy his time, Wood says he elected to bowl in his home village of Gifford, rather than brave the bus journey to the swimming baths at nearby North Berwick. Wood undertook his national service with the British Army, joining aged 18, serving in Germany with the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers. He later ran his own garage before concentrating on bowls. Bowls career =World Championships= Wood has won sixteen medals at the World Outdoor Bowls Championship including eight gold medals. He first won two medals at the 1980 World Outdoor Bowls Championship in Melbourne in the fours and team event (Leonard Trophy). He competed in the finals of the 1984 and 1988 World Bowls Championship singles (held every four years), missing out by millimetres to Peter Belliss of New Zealand in 1984 on home soil in Aberdeen. He was back in the final four years later in Auckland, New Zealand but was beaten by England's David Bryant. He did however win team gold. During the 1988 World Outdoor Bowls Championship in Auckland he won two silver medals and four years later picked up two golds and one bronze at the 1992 World Outdoor Bowls Championship in Worthing. Two further gold medals were added during the 1996 World Outdoor Bowls Championship in Adelaide and two bronze medals were won at the 2000 World Outdoor Bowls Championship in Johannesburg. On home turf in Ayr at the 2004 World Outdoor Bowls Championship he won two golds. Wood competed in nine World Championships in total and most recently a gold medal in the triples at the 2008 event in Christchurch, New Zealand. =Commonwealth Games= Wood first represented his country in 1966 and in 2002 became the first athlete to compete in a 7th Commonwealth Games.Lindsay, Clive (2002) \\"Wood and Wilkins enjoy records\\", BBC, 27 July 2002, retrieved 7 July 2011 His Commonwealth Games career included a singles bronze in 1974, a silver in the pairs in 1978, individual gold in 1982 and a captain's role in the 1990 winning fours team. The feat is even more remarkable as, had internal politics not forced him out of the 1986 games (held, ironically, in Scotland), Wood could have competed in more. After refusing to be reclassified as an amateur, the Scotland team decided not to select the World Championship runner-up, denying him the chance to compete in Edinburgh, at a bowling green just metres from Tynecastle Park ‚Äì home of his beloved Heart of Midlothian FC. In 2002, Wood was reported to be disappointed that Team Scotland athletes voted to give cyclist Craig MacLean the honour of carrying the flag at the opening ceremony, despite Wood's record-breaking achievement. Aged 72, Wood was included in Scotland's team for the 2010 Commonwealth Games, extending his record to an eighth games, and making him the oldest competitor at the games.Cyriac, Biju Babu (2010) \\"Great Scot!

(1975). Saiyid Ahmad barevali: His Life and Mission (No. 93). Lucknow: Academy of Islamic Research and Publications. Page 27. The epithet Barelvi is derived from Rae Bareli, his place of origin.  Early Life and Militia Service  Born in Rae-Bareilly in 1786, Syed Ahmad received his initial education at his home town and went to Lucknow at the age of 18 in search of a job but failed. He then moved to Delhi where he became a disciple of Shah Abdul Aziz. He resided there from 1806 to 1811, then at the age of 25 he joined militia of Amir Khan, a military expeditionary. This was the era of military campaigns in India during which nawabs and governors established their power by occupying territories. Syed Ahmad spent seven years in the service of Amir Khan, who only fought to loot and plunder. In 1817, after the Third Anglo-Maratha War, Amir Khan submitted to the British British East India Company, the Governor-General and Commander- in-Chief, The Marquess of Hastings, resolved to extinguish the Pindaris whom they deemed a menace. The Treaty of Gwalior severed the link between them and Scindia. Moreover, the treaty required the latter to join forces with the British to eliminate the Pindaris and Pathans. Bowing to the inevitable, Amir Khan assiduously came to terms with the British, agreeing to disband his men in return for a large stipend and recognition as a hereditary ruler. Amir Khan was recognized as hereditary nawab, disbanded his forces and quietly settled down to consolidating his little state. He became a faithful friend to the British, earning praise and consideration from successive pro-consuls. From Sayyid Ahmad's perspective, this was a strategic disaster, because for him the British were Christian heretics. Syed Ahmad was unemployed again with 30,000 other soldiers. Syed Ahmad came to Delhi after the end of his service and from here he decided to become a power player like Amir Khan. Barbara Metcalf theorizes this period in Sayyid Ahmad's life as a time of maturation, when he began to synthesize his experience in state-making and his commitment to the Sharia. He was joined by two members of the Shah Waliullah family: Shah Ismail Dehlavi (1771-1831) and Maulvi Abdul Hai (died 1828).Dr. Mubarak Ali, ‚ÄúAlmiyah-e-Tarikh‚Äù, Chapter 11, pp.107-121, Fiction House, Lahore (2012). This endorsement only added to Syed Ahmad's reputation, and his popularity grew with adherents flocking to him by the thousands. Reform Movement According to Olivier Roy, Barelvi was \\"the first person to realize the necessity of a movement which was at the same time religious, military and political.\\" He also was the first to address the people, not traditional leaders in his call for jihad. His evangelism‚Äîbased on networks of preachers, collectors and judges‚Äîalso addressed the common people and not the rulers' courts. The reform movement started with the idea of wahabist understanding of monotheism, and the fight against the local interpretations and customs that, according to him, had corrupted Islam. Barbara Metcalf writes: \\"Sayyid Ahmad's reformist teachings were set down in two works that, when printed on the new lithographic press of the day, soon achieved wide circulation. The Sirat'ul Mustaqim (the Straight Path) was compiled by Muhammad Ismail in 1819. Written initially in Persian, it was translated into Urdu in order to reach a wider audience. The second work, Taqwiyatul-Iman or the strengthening of the Faith, was written directly in Urdu. The two works stressed above all the centrality of tawhid, the transcendent unity of God, and denounced all those practices and beliefs that were held in any way to compromise that most fundamental of Islamic tenets. God alone was held to be omniscient and omnipotent. He alone, entitled to worship and homage. There were, the followers of Sayyid Ahmad argued, three sources of threat to this belief: false sufism, Shi√° doctrines and practices, and popular custom\\".B. Metcalf, \\"Islamic revival in British India: Deoband, 1860‚Äì1900\\", pp. 56 - 57, Princeton University Press (1982). According to Andreas Rieck, Syed Ahmad visited towns of North Indian planes from 1818 to 1821 with hundreds of missionaries to preach against Shia beliefs and practices. Syed Ahmad repeatedly destroyed ta'ziyas, an act that resulted in subsequent riots and chaos.Andreas Rieck, \\"The Shia's of Pakistan\\", p. 16, Oxford University Press (2016). Barbara Metcalf offers the following explanation to his anti-shi'ism: \\"A second group of Abuses Syed Ahmad held were those that originated from Shi‚Äôi influence. He particularly urged Muslims to give up the keeping of ta‚Äôziyahs. The replicas of the tombs of the martyrs of Karbala taken in procession during the mourning ceremony of Muharram. Muhammad Isma‚Äôil wrote, > ‚Äòa true believer should regard the breaking a tazia by force to be as > virtuous an action as destroying idols. If he cannot break them himself, let > him order others to do so. If this even be out of his power, let him at > least detest and abhor them with his whole heart and soul‚Äô. Sayyid Ahmad himself is said, no doubt with considerable exaggeration, to have torn down thousands of imambaras, the building that house the taziyahs\\".B. Metcalf, \\"Islamic revival in British India: Deoband, 1860‚Äì1900\\", p. 58, Princeton University Press (1982). In 1821, Syed Ahmad left for Hajj along with a group of devotees. He returned from Haj in 1823, and once again visited different parts of India. For Syed Ahmad and the followers of the Faraizi movement, India was ‚ÄúDarul Harb‚Äù the capital of war and therefore jihad was obligatory for the Muslims. In his book, Sirat-e-Mustaqeem, Shah Ismail Dehlavi wrote: ‚Äúa large part of present-day India has become ‚ÄúDar-ul-Harab‚Äù. Compare the situation with the heavenly blessings of India two and three hundred years ago‚Äù. Comparing India with Darul Islam, he said: ‚Äúcompare India with Rome and Turkey in terms of heavenly blessings‚Äù.  Jihad and Islamic State  His first target was the Sikh-ruled kingdom of Ranjit Singh, which was expanding further into Afghanistan. Barelvi intended to establish an Islamic bastion on the north-west frontier in the Peshawar valley from whence to attack the British colonialists after defeating Sikh forces. When the action began, some Muslim nawabs, like his former employer Amir Khan, provided funds but did not join him for jihad. Around 8,000 holy-warriors who accompanied him were mostly clergymen or poor people who joined the militia were looking for employment. The rulers of Tonk, Gwalior and Rampur supported him with British consent because they were dependent on British forces and they knew well enough that the British would not stop them from aiding an enemy of the Sikhs. Since Syed Ahmad‚Äôs campaign was based on Islamic concept of jihad, his spokesman, Shah Ismail Dehlavi, tries to create desire for the war by saying: ‚Äúas far as the special (sexual) benefits are concerned that go to the faithful Martyrs, the Muslim Mujahideen, the ruling Sultans and the brave men of the battle field, don't need to be elaborated here‚Äù. Arriving in Peshawar valley in late 1826, Sayyid Ahmad and his followers made their base in towns of Hund and Zaida in Swabi DistrictWahhabi movement in India. Qeyamuddin Ahmad, (1994, p.50). open library Barelvi preached jihad amongst the local Pashtun tribes, demanding they renounce their tribal customs and adopt the Shariah. The traditional khan were replaced by ulama (clerics) and a system of Islamic taxes was established to finance the jihad. Only after this evangelist campaign and sharia system was had set up was jihad declared. He sent a message to Ranjit Singh to ‚Äúeither become a Muslim, pay Jizyah or fight and remember that in case of war, Yaghistan supports the Indians‚Äù. The mujahideen received both ideological preaching and physical training sessions. Syed Ahmad organized wrestling, archery training and shooting competitions. The mujahideen also sang anthems. One such anthems has survived, known as \\"Risala Jihad\\", it goes as follows: > \\"War against the Infidel is incumbent on all Musalmans; make provisions for > all things. He who from his heart gives one farthing to the cause, shall > hereafter receive seven hundred fold from God. He who shall equip a warrior > in this cause of God, shall hereafter obtain a martyr's reward; His children > dread not the trouble of the grave, nor the last trump, not the Day of > Judgement. Cease to be crowds; join the divine leader, and smite the > Infidel. I give thanks to God that a great leader has been born, in the > thirteenth of the Hijra\\".Charles Allen, \\"God's Terrorists: The Wahhabi Cult > and the Hidden Roots of Modern Jihad\\", p. 86, Abacus (2006). In December 1826 Sayyid Ahmad and his followers clashed with Sikh troops at Akora with some success. On 11 January 1827, allegiance was sworn on his hand and he was declared Caliph and Imam. Syed Ahmad‚Äôs claim of leadership (Caliphate) was viewed with suspicion in the Frontier region as well as in the clerical circles of North India. When the Friday sermon was read in his name, it became clear to the tribal chiefs that he wanted the political power for himself. According to Khadi Khan, a Pathan sardar: ‚Äúit is the job of the Sardars to take care of the people, not a Maulvi who spends his life on donations. Maulvies are ill-equipped to run the affairs of a State‚Äù. Syed Ahmad tried to explain that his aim was not this-worldly but to lead jihad against the infidels. In one of his letters, he writes: ‚ÄúWe thank and praise God, the real master and the true king, who bestowed upon his humble, recluse and helpless servant the title of Caliphate, first through occult gestures and revelations, in which there is no room for doubt, and then by guiding the hearts of the believers towards me. This way God appointed me as the Imam (leader)‚Äù. Criticizing his opponents, Shah Ismail Dehlavi wrote: ‚Äútherefore, obedience to Syed Ahmad is obligatory on all Muslims. Whoever does not accept the leadership of His Excellency or rejects it after accepting it, is an apostate and mischievous, and killing him is part of the jihad as is the killing of the disbelievers. Therefore, the appropriate response to opponents is that of the sword and not the pen‚Äù. Regarding his Imamate, Syed Ahmad wrote to Nawab Wazir ud-Dawla, the ruler of Tonk: ‚Äúbelieve me, the person who sincerely confesses to my position is special in the eyes of God, and the one who denies it is, of course sinful. My opponents who deny me of this position will be humiliated and disgraced‚Äù. Mubarak Ali writes: \\"After the conquest of Peshawar, Syed Ahmad launched a violent policy to enforce Shari‚Äôah and announced the abolition of all tribal rituals that he considered illegal. The most important of these rituals were: the bride was paid a regular price for marriage, the wives of the deceased were divided among his heirs, more than four marriages were practiced, women could not inherit property, internecine wars were considered jihad and plunder was considered booty. Therefore, after the conquest of Peshawar, orders were issued that those who can give half of the agreed money to the brides can take them. The young girls (9 year old and above) who are eligible for marriage should be married immediately. To enforce Shari‚Äôah law, he appointed Imam Qutbuddin as an ombudsman, accompanied by 30 armed soldiers, who accompanied him to nearby villages to beat up the people who had abandoned prayers. Beatings and flogging had become the norm, that if the ombudsman went to any village, panic would spread. Punishment was carried out with extreme violence and people were even hanged on tree branches. Even among women, those who missed prayers were punished in the women‚Äôs quarters, so people soon became fed up with these polices because these judges and ombudsmen started harassing people and imposed fines on them beyond their means\\". In addition to the stated social agenda, Sayyid Ahmad also attempted to collect the Islamic tithe (usher) of ten per cent of crop yields. The alliance was defeated and the Islamic reformers finally occupied Peshawar. Over several months during 1830 Sayyed Ahmad tried to conciliate established power hierarchies. But before the end of 1830 an organized uprising occurred and the agents of Sayyid Ahmad in Peshawar and in the villages of the plain were murdered and the movement retreated to hills. There in the town of Balakot in 1831, Syed Ahmad was killed by the Sikh Army. He was beheaded.Qeyamuddin Ahmad, Wahhabi movement in India, (1994, p.55)Grave of Syed Ahmed Shaheed in 2014 Battle of Balakot The position of the Sikh forces at the foot of the Metikot hill. Syed Ahmad's political and religious power created strong opposition against him in the Frontier region and the locals started to revolt. The decisive moments for Sayyid Ahmad came in 1830. The Pukhtuns rose against him and his around two hundred Mujahidin were killed in Peshawar valley which compelled him to migrate and try his luck in Kashmir, his long cherished dream.Qadir, Altaf, \\"Ahmad Barailvi: His Movement and Legacy from the Pukhtun Perspective, Sage Publications India, 2015 On 8 May 1831, on the day of Holy Jumu'ah, 24 Zulqa'da 1248 AH, Syed Ahmad Barelvi's Mujahideen forces prepared for the final battle at Balakot Maidan in the mountainous valley of Mansehra district. It is to be noted that the total number of fighters in the Mujahideen was 600 and the number of Sikh soldiers was 10,000. Sikh troops started landing at Balakot Maidan from Metikot hill and Syed Ahmad Barelvi and most of the Mujahideen were staying in and around the Masjid-i Bala. Note that, The 700-strong Mujahideen force was encamped far along the Satban waterfall. Syed Ahmad Barelvi suddenly left Masjid-e-Bala to attack the Sikhs and reached Masjid-e-Yarin. He then marched towards the foot of Metikot with the Mujahideen forces. Most of the Sikh soldiers who landed at the foot of Metikot were killed. But already every inch of Tiller in Metikot was filled by troops. They came down from every place and launched a fierce attack on the Mujahideen. Syed Ahmad Barelvi was at the forefront of the Mujahideen forces. Suddenly, Syed Ahmad Barelvi was killed in the fountain of Metikot. A large group of Mujahideen did not realize the death of Syed Ahmad Barelvi and went in search of him. Besides, small groups of Mujahideen were killed while fighting in different places. This battle lasted at least two hours. Then the people of Gojar's group started shouting loudly in different groups that Syed Ahmad had been taken to the top of the hill. So you all come to the top of the hill. As a result, the Mujahideen moved towards the mountains to the north. And thus the war came to an end. The reason why the people of Gozar do this is that, Either they did it at the instigation of the Sikhs. Because if the Mujahideen were fighting in Metikot, many more Sikh fighters would have been killed. Or it may be assumed that the remaining Mujahideen had to resort to such tactics for the purpose of migration. Another rumor about the Death of Syed Ahmad Barelvi, the Emir and Commander-in-Chief of the Mujahideen forces, is that he was at the forefront of the Mujahideen and infiltrated a group of Sikh soldiers. The peaks surrounded him which his followers did not notice. Thus he was killed and his body could not be identified by the Mujahideen. For this reason, even after a long time, the remaining Mujahideen could not believe that the death of Syed Ahmad Barelvi was true.  Legacy  Syed Ahmad is thought by at least one scholar (Edward Mortimer), to have anticipated modern Islamists in waging jihad and attempting to create an Islamic state with strict enforcement of Islamic law,Mortimer, Edward, Faith and Power, (1982), p.68-70 and by at least one other (Olivier Roy), to be the first modern Islamic leader to lead a movement that was \\"religious, military and political,\\" and to address the common people and rulers with a call for jihad.

The original population speaks Luxembourgish, an old Southern German named \\"Mosel-Fr√§nkisch\\" which has a common root with English and sounds a bit like Celtic, but which got mixed with many French words assimilated to the Luxembourgish intonation. In the small country of Luxembourg, the local dialects differ a bit from one village to another. The population of Moutfort used to speak a more Southern variety, but the finer variety of the city of Luxembourg is now mostly being adopted. At school, the alphabetisation of 6 year old children in first primary class is done in German, which children understand intuitively, although it is really considered as a foreign language. The books are in German, but the teacher speaks mostly in Luxembourgish to the little children. Likewise, the newspapers are mostly in German. The Luxembourgish language is being written for poems, songs, theatre plays, often but not always for private letters. Luxembourgish is being spoken on the radio and TV, and in the parliament \\"Chambre des d√©put√©s\\". Many foreign people who get settled in Luxembourg learn the Luxembourgish language, at least their children learn it at school and like to speak it. In second primary class, children start learning French, which is really a foreign and difficult language for the original population. But many francophone people have settled in Luxembourg, for which it is their language. French is since the presence of Napoleon's regime the public language used by officials and by the court of Luxembourg. When you go for shopping, to a petrol station or a restaurant, it is very probable that the person serving you will speak French. English is on the school program latest in 7th class, and it sounds somehow familiar so that everyone believes he knows English at once. Anyhow, most people can communicate a bit in English. It is being said: If you don't know how to speak English, just take a hot potato in your mouth and speak a funny Luxembourgish, and they will understand you. There is an important Portuguese population in Luxembourg due to a contract with Portugal, they use French as communication language. Many people in Luxembourg also learn Spanish or Italian, because they like to be able to communicate in their vacation country. Moutfort is situated in the valley of the Syr, a little stream having its sources in the area of the close neighbour village Syren. The Syr joins the Moselle(French), Mosel(German), Musel(Luxb )in Wasserbillig and the waters of the Syr will then flow into the Rhine at Koblenz, Germany. The commune of Contern used to have its own sources from the \\"Conter Heed\\" (Heide, German) for the water supply of its population as well as for neighbour communes.

Administration Communale de Contern. Retrieved 1 October 2015. Moutfort is associated with the little neighbour village Medingen which is situated a bit higher on a hill, appearing like a bird nest. The cookery writer Ketty Thull was born in Moutfort but there is a street in Moutfort that bears her name. The people of Medingen were known to be more sociable with each other than the people of Moutfort. Both villages used to have common associations, like the church choir, the brass band, the volunteer fire company, the youth club, the soccer club (German: Fussballverein, Luxbg: Futballsclub, French: club de football), always denominated as \\"Moutfort-Medingen\\". Meanwhile, the associations and the church tend to collaborate over the whole commune or even with villages of neighbour communes, like Sandweiler, or along the Syr valley (Luxbg: Syrdall). The church of Moutfort is catholic, like almost everyone in Luxembourg used to be. Medingen has just a little church designated as chapel, although there is space for many people. The Guardian Angel on the main road is standing in a little parc beside a chapel that's bigger than most such chapels on the way, but not meant to go inside. At the traditional Corpus Christi procession which marches around the village on the central streets in the shape of a square, this chapel is always being decorated with flowers and flags, in old times also with a carpet of flowers in front of it, and the procession stops there for special prayers and songs.

Fourteen players were ejected, and one fouled out, making that game the probably only playoff game in professional basketball history that ended as a 3-on-4 match. The disturbance The second match of the playoff series between Bonn and Bamberg was played in Bonn. With Bonn trailing 21-14 after 13 minutes, Uvis Helmanis (Bamberg) committed a hard foul against Michael Meeks (Bonn) without the referees whistling. In the next play, Meeks scythed Helmanis, prompting Steffen Hamann (Bamberg) to face Meeks and punch him to the ground. In the following 20 minute bench-clearing brawl, almost every player and many team officials stormed onto the court. Thirteen players were ejected; the game could only carry on as a 4-on-5 with Bamberg being short-handed. The Bamberg team used a 2:2 zone defense against the Bonn team, who were in a perpetual power play situation. It worked surprisingly well, as long as the four players still had some energy left. The Bonn team had the privilege of being able to use a libero (similar to free-roaming defensive positions in football and volleyball), but were unable to capitalize on this until the last quarter: the shorthanded Bamberg team led 45‚Äì30 at half time, managed to end the third quarter still in front with 52‚Äì50 and took a 61‚Äì60 lead minutes away from the end, however, then exhaustion took its toll. Bonn drained shot after shot and shut down Bamberg's offense, because of the advantage of the extra player. The match reached its absurd climax seconds before the game ended. A Bamberg player fouled out, and Bamberg coach Dirk Bauermann was ejected after receiving his second technical foul for abusing officials. In frustration, the Bamberg player who fouled out pushed another Bonn player, and he shoved him back in retaliation. The referees ejected the Bonn player and the match ended as a 3-on-4 with Bonn winning 75‚Äì64.

Located in what today would be eastern Chad and western Sudan, Wadai fiercely resisted the French invasion. Regardless, much of Wadai including its capital Ab√©ch√© fell to the invaders in 1909, forcing the empire's ruler Dud Murra to continue his resistance from outlying provinces and allied states. He managed to gain the support of the Sultanate of Darfur and Dar Masalit, and used these areas as rear bases during his attempts to oust the French. Doing so, he enjoyed some success, and inflicted several defeats on French-led forces. In order to legitimize their intervention, the French installed Dud Murra's relative Adam Asil as puppet ruler in Wadai. After losing most of his forces and allies, Dud Murra was forced to surrender in 1911. Regardless, unrest initially continued: a major anti-French revolt broke out soon after Dud Murra's defeat, and an anti-European conspiracy was allegedly organized with the support of Adam Asil. The last effective anti-French resistance in Wadai was suppressed by 1912 and the region remained a part of French colonial empire until 1960.  Background  Wadai Empire (yellow) and its surroundings around 1890, from an American map Founded by the Tunjur people in the 16th century and located in the eastern Chad Basin, Wadai's economy relied on cattle herding and slave trading. Accordingly, it developed a capable military whose main purpose was to raid other territories for slaves. Even though Islam served as state religion, traditional religious practices remained common among Wadai's population. Regardless, religion was used to justify slave raids against non-Muslim peoples to the south. In the 19th century, Wadai grew in power thanks to a succession of capable kings (kolak), despite occasional civil wars. The state eventually forged an alliance with the influential Senussi order which was based in the desert to the north and controlled important Trans-Saharan trade routes, becoming the dominant power in the east- central Chad Basin. Wadai prospered under the stable reigns of Ali ibn Muhammad Sharif (r. 1858‚Äì1874) and Yusuf ibn Muhammad Sharif (r. 1874‚Äì1898). Caravans increasingly opted to travel through Wadai, deeming it safer, and brought the region much wealth. Relying on its prospering economy and firearms imported from the Senussi, Wadai expanded and subjugated several other polities such as Bornu and the Sultanate of Bagirmi, forcing them to pay tribute and abducting skilled craftsmen to enrich the empire. At the same time, the Scramble for Africa resulted in the rapid colonization of the Sahel. To Wadai's east, th British defeated Mahdist Sudan and reestablished the Sultanate of Darfur as buffer state. Darfur's ruler, Ali Dinar, proved to be a relatively effective and independent monarch. In the west, French colonial armies had begun expanding into the Chad Basin, where they came into conflict with various local states, tribes, and movements including the Senussi order. As results of negotiations in 1898‚Äì99, the British and French governments agreed to divide the Chad Basin among themselves. They decided to assign Wadai to France, whereas Darfur was formally included in the British sphere of influence. Uncertainty remained, however, as the borders between Wadai and Darfur were disputed and regularly in flux. When Ali Dinar of Darfur learned of the European agreements, he was determined to expand his territory as fast as possible westward to preclude a French occuptain of areas which he believed were rightfully his. He increasingly cooperated with the Senussi for military and economic reasons, and thus was gradually drawn into the anti-French struggle further west. In 1898, Kolak Yusuf of Wadai died, resulting in a succession struggle during which Ahmad al-Ghazali, supported by Ali Dinar, gained the throne. Two years later, the French destroyed Rabih az-Zubayr's empire and established French Chad, directly bordering Wadai. The French consequently began interfering in Wadai's succession struggle. In 1901, Ahmad al-Ghazali was overthrown by Muhammad Salih, better known as \\"Dud Murra\\" (Lion of Murra) who was backed by the Senussi order. To reward his Senussi allies, Dud Murra allowed them to trade freely in his realm. As result, Dud Murra and the Senussi forged a close alliance. Despite his ascension, Dud Murra's rule continued to be challenged by rivals. His cousin Adam Asil attempted a coup, but failed and fled to avoid being blinded. Adam Asil found refuge with the French who began to support his claims to the throne. They intended to install him as puppet ruler of Wadai.  Opposing forces  = Wadai = Wadai had a capable and highly experienced military, well versed in mobile combat and the constant raiding which marked traditional warfare in the region. The core of its army were elite cavalry troops, many of whom belonged to a warrior nobility. By 1900, Wadai was able to raise 7,000 to 11,000 of these mounted soldiers. The nobles were supplemented by ordinary soldiers, many of whom were actually slaves. Wadai's rulers were keen to modernize their military, and began importing modern guns from North Africa during the early 19th century. Civilians were banned from owning guns, while the gun trade to expand Wadai's official arsenal increased as time went on. The firearms were usually exchanged for slaves. In particular, Dud Murra greatly expanded Wadai's arsenal, and amassed about 10,000 guns, ranging from older but high-quality flintlocks to Martini‚ÄìHenry, Remington, Gras, and Winchester rifles, as well as colts. For the most part, modern guns had to be smuggled to Wadai by the Senussi order, as European colonial powers and the Ottoman Empire generally forbade their sale in the Sahara region. As result, the import of guns remained extremely expensive for sub-Saharan states including Wadai. A traveller described in 1881 that the value of a modern Italian firearm would increase up to ten times by the time it arrived south of the desert. The supply of spare parts and ammunition for moderns guns remained problematic, and many Sub-Saharan warriors accordingly continued to prefer flintlocks which suffered from no supply shortages. = French = The regular French troops from Europe which were active in the Chad were poorly equipped and weak in numbers. As a result, the French relied on African troops in their wars in the region, many of whom were recruited from the armies of allied chiefs and sultans. Many of the French-led troops which fought against Wadai were actually veterans of Rabih az-Zubayr's defeated army who had defected to the Europeans.  The war  Wadai cavalry in combat against the French (Le Petit Journal, 1911). Despite their often medieval weaponry, the armies of Wadai inflicted several defeats on the French colonial forces. With the French backing Adam Asil, open conflict between the European colonial power and Wadai broke out in 1906. The French gradually advanced eastward, building fortified posts to support their war effort, and assaulted fortified Senussi Zawiya posts in the desert which reduced the Islamic order's military and economic poweress. By 1907, the French forces were within of Ab√©ch√©. Meanwhile, Adam Asil started to launch regular raids into Wadai's surroundings from French- held territories. These attacks were not sanctioned by his European protectors, resulting in tensions. The French even temporarily abandoned him in 1908, but soon resumed their support for his cause. Despite the troubles surrounding Adam Asil, the French continued to advance. A column of 200 soldiers led by Captain J√©rusalemy inflicted heavy defeats on Wadaian forces at Dokotchi on 29 May 1908 and Djoua on 16 June. The French killed the governors of the Wadai provinces of Mahamid and Debaba during the latter battle. Thanks to the success at Djoua, a French column of 180 under Captain Jean-Joseph Fiegenschuh was able to occupy Ab√©ch√© on 2 or 12 June 1909. Wadai became part of the French colonial empire, and Adam Asil was installed as new kolak. Dud Murra refused to surrender, however, and continued to operate as \\"shadow\\" kolak. He retreated northward into Senussi-held areas, and waged an insurgency against the French whose control of Wadai remained highly tenuous. As the French claimed all areas that had been controlled by Wadai's rulers in the past, they also came into conflict with Darfur. Ali Dinar considered their advance into the disputed Wadai-Darfur border region as aggression, and he began to support Dud Murra's cause. Meanwhile, Captain Fiegenschuh was sent after the fugitive kolak who was based in the territory of Sultan Taj ad-Din, ruler of Dar Masalit. Fiegenschuh and his troops were completely wiped out by Wadaian forces at Wadi Kadja on 4 January 1910. Another French force was promptly assembled. Counting 300 soldiers, this column was personally led by Chad Territory commander Joseph √âdouard Maillard, and encountered an army of 5,000 native troops led by Dud Murra and Sultan Taj ad-Din at Dorothe on 8 November 1910. The African forces managed to surround the French, and wiped them out in a hard-fought battle. Both sides suffered heavy losses, including Maillard and Sultan Taj ad-Din. Overall, the Battle of Dorothe was a major success for Dud Murra, and temporarily restored his power. Realizing the seriousness of the situation, the French leadership prepared another offensive. This time, colonial veteran Victor Emmanuel Largeau was put into command of the Wadai War. He launched a comprehensive counter-insurgency campaign, which succeeded in forcing Dud Murra to surrender in October 1911. The defeated kolak was imprisoned at Fort-Lamy, although unrest continued. Shortly after Dud Murra's surrender, a major revolt broke out in Wadai. After this uprising was suppressed, the French fully cemented their control over the region. Wadai's puppet ruler had also outlived his usefulness. Adam Asil was ousted by the French in 1911, suspected of supporting an anti-European conspiracy. Wadai was completely occupied by the French in 1912.  Aftermath  The Wadai War resulted in high casualties on both sides, and devastated the local economy. Famine and epidemics became widespread in Chad, and the population of Wadai fell from 700,000 in 1912 to 400,000 in 1914. Chad, including Wadai, remained difficult to control, and some native rulers continued to maintain de facto independence until 1917. In that year, a French commander also ordered the murder of more than 100 Wadaian dignitaries in the so-called \\"Cut-cut massacre\\". The former empire's intellectual elite responded by fleeing en masse to Darfur and Egypt. Hatred for the French government increased, and open anti-French resistance in Chad continued until 1920.

He was a Member of the Knesset, and is known for founding industrial parks in Israel and neighboring countries.Who Is Stef Wertheimer?, Stacy Perman, Business Week, 14 March 2008 The Wertheimers are Israel‚Äôs richest family as of 2013. Early life Wertheimer was born in Kippenheim, Germany, to a Jewish family. His family fled to Israel in 1937 to escape Nazism and settled in Tel Aviv. He studied in the Tel-Nordau School but dropped out of school at age 16 and started working in a camera repair store. At the same time, he began studying optics with Professor Emanuel Goldberg, a researcher and inventor who contributed significantly to different aspects of imaging technology in the first half of the twentieth century. In 1943, during World War II, Wertheimer joined the British Royal Air Force. Wertheimer served as an optical equipment technician. He was sent to Bahrain where he repaired optical equipment installed in Britain's military aircraft. In 1945 he joined the Palmach, where he served as a technical officer in the \\"German Unit\\" ‚Äì a special guerilla force trained with British cooperation to participate in combat operations against the German army, should it reach Palestine. In 1947, he joined the Haganah and worked in the development and improvement of cannons. During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, he served as a technical officer in the Yiftach Brigade. After the war, Wertheimer started working at Rafael, only to be dismissed shortly thereafter because of his lack of formal education. Following the war, he and his wife briefly lived on kibbutz Yir'on, but left, as he did not agree with the socialist economic model adopted by the kibbutz movement. Business career In 1952, Wertheimer started his own business in the backyard of his home in Nahariya, a small metal shop and tool making company called ISCAR. The company quickly became a success and attracted the interest of Discount Investments, who later became a minority investor in the company. Today, ISCAR is one of the world's largest (by sales) manufacturers of carbide industrial-cutting tools, which are used by carmakers like General Motors and Ford.Stef Wertheimer & Family, Forbes, dated October 2006. ISCAR branches exist in over 50 countries worldwide and the company employs nearly 6,000 people. In 1969, as part of Israeli efforts to overcome the French weapons embargo after the Six-Day War, Wertheimer founded ISCAR Blades which later became Blades Technology ‚Äì one of the largest manufacturers of blades and vanes for jet engines and industrial gas turbines. Today, Blades Technology's customers include Pratt & Whitney, Rolls-Royce, Snecma, General Electric, MTU Aero Engines, Techspace Aero, and Solar Turbines. In May 2006, Berkshire Hathaway bought 80% of ISCAR Metalworking Company for $4 billion (the Wertheimers paid $1 billion in taxes to the Israeli government).Jerusalem Post Jerusalem Post, 6 May 2006. In May 2013 Buffett bought the rest of Iscar for $2.05 billion. Industrial parks Wertheimer founded seven industrial parks ‚Äì in Tefen, Tel-Hai, Dalton, Lavon and now Nazareth in the Galilee; in Omer in the Negev; and another in Turkey. Each is based on five principles: exports, education, coexistence, community and culture, with the goal of fostering economic growth and job creation to help create stability in the region. As Wertheimer has explained, \\"The idea of industrial parks in the Middle East and on the borders between Israel and its neighbors is that the parks will bring industry and provide jobs, which will keep people busy working, instead of engaging in terrorism.\\"Stef Wertheimer's New Middle East Israel21c, 11 January 2004 Wertheimer's model park is the Tefen Industrial Park. Built in 1982, it encompasses everything from transportation to cultural and educational facilities. Wertheimer's industrial park in the mixed Muslim- Christian Arab city of Nazareth, where Jews and Arabs work side by side, opened in April 2013. Wertheimer and Nazareth Mayor Ramez Jeraisy explained that the industrial park is part of a unique model to promote the advancement of Arab-Jewish Israeli export companies. During his visit to Israel in 2009, Pope Benedict had met with both men at the site of the future park and gave his blessing to the project. Wertheimer has said, \\"Coexistence in the industrial park in Arab Nazareth is a good example of coexistence. When people work together, they have no time for nonsense. They're too tired at night to commit terrorist acts. They're satisfied, they engage in producing. They work together, not against each other.\\" Peace efforts Wertheimer promotes the idea of a \\"Marshall Plan for the Middle East\\" ‚Äì his concept for using industry to provide training, create jobs, alleviate poverty and raise the per capita income of those living in the Middle East. In the 1990s, he drew up plans for an industrial park in Rafah, in the Gaza Strip. The Palestinian and the Israeli governments both offered support, but one week before the groundbreaking ceremony, the Second Intifada broke out and that plan was indefinitely shelved.Giving Galilee a Foothold in Industry, New York Times, 18 May 2006. In 2002, he testified before the United States House of Representatives about a \\"new Marshall Plan\\" that advocates U.S. funding to revitalize the Middle East through a sustained effort to promote commerce, jobs, and a free economy in the region.Marshall Plan for Middle East News Advisory, U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on International Relations, 22 July 2002. Wertheimer's vision includes building an additional 100 industrial parks that will employ Israelis and Palestinians. Wertheimer isn't confining his idea to Israel though, and has plans underway in Turkey and Jordan. \\"My Marshall Plan is based on aid from Western countries for strengthening the Middle East, in order to achieve peace and tranquillity. The parks will serve as a five-year incubator for manufacturing and export companies. If aid is obtained, the parks can usher in an era in which production, exports, education, and an advanced quality of life can replace terrorism and poverty,\\" elaborated Wertheimer on his vision. Political career In 1977 Wertheimer was amongst the founding members of Democratic Movement for Change, a new centrist political party. The party was highly successful, winning 15 seats in the 1977 elections, with Wertheimer taking one of the seats. When the party split up in 1978, he joined Shinui. In 1981 following an accident, he resigned from the Knesset (was replaced by Stella Levy) and returned to his business ventures. During his term in the Knesset, he was a member of the Economics Committee. He remains active in bridging gaps between the Jewish and Arab populations of Israel, particularly by boosting Arab participation in the country's high-tech sector.Arabs and Jews in high- tech Israel: Bring them together Prior to 2013 elections, he took the honorary final slot on Tzipi Livni's new list, Hatnuah. He endorsed her alliance with Labor, the Zionist Union, in 2015. Awards In 1991, Wertheimer was awarded the Israel Prize for his special contribution to society and the State of Israel. In 2008 he received the Buber-Rosenzweig-Medal. He received the Oslo Business for Peace Award in 2010, which is given to leaders in the private sector who have demonstrated transformative and positive change through ethical business practices.

The program featured the first full-length interview with the most recent eliminated contestant and various behind-the-scenes material. It was hosted by Jillian Reynolds and co-hosted by Ace Young, a former contestant of the show. Jillian interviewed each week's eliminated contestant as well as Idol contestants from years past. The show included exclusive behind the scenes packages from the Idol show as well as live, in studio, performances by former Idols. Judges Simon Cowell, Randy Jackson, Paula Abdul and Kara DioGuardi were periodically interviewed after the results show tapings. The show premiered in 2006 and was shown on both Fox Reality Channel and The 101 Network (the DirecTV owned and exclusive programming service). Ty Treadway was the host that season and Mikalah Gordon and Matthew Rogers served as cohosts. The second season (2007) brought some changes. JD Roberto became the host and the show became exclusive to Fox Reality Channel. In addition, the show is now taped on a stage of CBS Television City adjacent to the Idol studio in front of a live studio audience (the stage was also used for The Price is Right). In season 3 (2008), Gina Glocksen and Constantine Maroulis replaced Gordon and Rogers as the co-hosts of the show. In season 4 (2009), Jillian Reynolds replaced Roberto as host and Ace Young replaced Glocksen and Maroulis as co-host. The program did not return in 2010 because Fox Reality was in transition to National Geographic Wild. The exit interview moved to The Ellen DeGeneres Show, hosted by DeGeneres, who was a judge that season. DeGeneres has since left the show and the first exit interview is now conducted on Live with Regis and Kelly. No other elements of this program have survived.

He was an English Dissenter and was instrumental in bringing political rights to that religious minority. He was a friend and close associate of William Wilberforce and a member of the Clapham Sect of social reformers, and was in the forefront of many of their campaigns for social justice, prison reform and philanthropic endeavour, most notably the abolition of slavery. He was the grandfather of pioneer nurse and statistician Florence Nightingale and educationalist Barbara Bodichon, a founder of Girton College, Cambridge. Early life William Smith was born on 22 September 1756 at Clapham (then a village to the south of London), the only son of Samuel Smith by Martha, daughter of William Adams of London. Brought up by parents who worshipped at an Independent chapel, he was educated at the dissenting academy at Daventry until 1772, where he began to come under the influence of Unitarians. He went into the family grocery business and by 1777 had become a partner. Smith had a long career as a social and political reformer, joining the Society for Constitutional Information in 1782. Election to parliament In 1784 Smith was elected as one of the two Members of Parliament for Sudbury in Suffolk.History of Parliament Online He was active in his support for the Whigs while in opposition. In 1790 he lost his seat at Sudbury and in the following January was elected as one of the members for Camelford. In 1796 he was again returned for Sudbury, but in 1802 accepted the invitation of radicals to stand for Norwich, although he was defeated in the election of 1806, which was fought on a local issue. However, enough Whigs were elected to form the next government, led by Lord Grenville. Smith was returned again in 1807 and 1812 and became a popular and outspoken radical Member of Parliament for Norwich, which was known for being a gathering place for dissenters and radicals of all kinds. Unitarianism William Smith held strong dissenting Christian convictions ‚Äì he was a Unitarian, and was thus prevented from attaining the Great Offices of State. (The doctrine of Unitarians was to deny the truth of the Trinity, a central tenet of the Church of England.) He nevertheless played a leading role in most of the great contemporary parliamentary issues, including the Dissenters' demands for the repeal of the Test and Corporation Acts (for the first time since the 1730s). Although the campaigners were unsuccessful in 1787, they tried again in 1789. When Charles Fox introduced a bill for the relief of Nontrinitarianism in May 1792, Smith supported the Unitarian Society, publicly declaring his commitment to the Unitarian cause. The same year he became one of the founding members of the Friends of the People Society. In 1813 Smith challenged the established church, and was responsible for championing the Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813, known as 'Mr William Smith's Bill', which, for the first time, made it legal to practice Unitarianism. He was a member of the Essex Street Chapel. Abolitionism In June 1787, Smith was one of the first to campaign for the abolition of the slave trade, becoming a vocal advocate for the cause. In 1790 he supported William Wilberforce in the slave trade debate in April. While he had been out of parliament he had given his support to Abolitionism by writing a pamphlet entitled A Letter to William Wilberforce (1807), in which he cogently and convincingly summarised the abolitionists' arguments for abolition. Once the trade had been halted, he turned his attention to freeing those who were already slaves. In 1823 with Zachary Macaulay he helped found the London Society for the Abolition of Slavery in our Colonies, thereby launching the next phase of the campaign to eradicate slavery. French Revolution In the beginning, at least, William Smith was sympathetic to the revolutionary movement in France. He visited Paris in 1790, where he attended the 14 July celebrations, and later recorded his reactions to the momentous events he witnessed. In April 1791 he publicly supported the aims and principles of the newly formed Unitarian Society, including support for the recently won liberty of the French (see Revolution Controversy). Smith was swiftly gaining a reputation as a radical, even a Jacobin. Because he had business contacts and friends in Paris, he was more than once asked to act as a go-between for the government. In 1792 he arranged several meetings between William Pitt and Maret, Napoleon's foreign minister, in an attempt to avoid war. Later life He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1806 as \\"a Gentleman well versed in various branches of Natural Knowledge\\". As an MP, Smith witnessed the assassination of prime minister Spencer Perceval. Smith finally saw through parliament the repeal of the Test Acts in 1828. He died on 31 May 1835 in London, at the age of 78. Family On 12 September 1781 Smith married Frances Coape (1758 ‚Äì 1840), daughter of John and Hannah Coape, both Dissenters. They had five sons and five daughters. Of the sons: *the eldest was Benjamin Smith, the Whig politician. He fathered Barbara Bodichon, founder of Girton College, and the explorer Benjamin Leigh Smith. *the second, William Adams Smith (1789‚Äì1870), was known as an activist. *Samuel (1794‚Äì1880), married Mary Shore. *Octavius (1796‚Äì1871), married Jane Cooke, and had eight children. *Frederick (1798‚Äì1882), married Mary Yates. The third daughter, Frances Smith (1789‚Äì1880), married William Nightingale and was the mother of Florence Nightingale. Of the other daughters, Joanna Maria (1791‚Äì1884) married MP John Bonham-Carter (1788‚Äì1838) and founded the Bonham Carter family. Martha Frances (1782‚Äì1870, Patty) and Julia (1799‚Äì1881) did not marry; Anne (1785‚Äì1854) married George Thomas Nicholson. The Smiths lived near the family business, and moved into Eagle House on Clapham Common.

Translohr is a rubber-tired tramway (or guided bus) system, originally developed by Lohr Industrie of France and now run by a consortium of Alstom Transport and Fonds strat√©gique d'investissement (FSI) as newTL,newTL which took over from Lohr in 2012. It is used in Paris and Clermont-Ferrand, France; Medell√≠n, Colombia; Tianjin and Shanghai, China; and Venice-Mestre and Padua in Italy.http://www.ferrovie.it/portale/leggi.php?id=1378 In June 2012, Alstom Group and the Strategic Investment Fund acquired Translohr for ‚Ç¨35 million. Description Translohr guide rail Translohr in Medell√≠n The Translohr system is intended to provide a tram or light rail-like experience compared to regular buses or trolleybuses. Unlike other guided bus systems (including the similar but incompatible Guided Light Transit system developed by Bombardier Transportation), Translohr cars are permanently fixed to guide rails, and cannot divert from them, similar to traditional steel-wheeled rail vehicles. Since the guide rail automatically guides the vehicle along its route, there are minimal steering controls in the driver's cab. Accelerating and braking are the only functions the driver controls. Like a conventional tram, power is provided by overhead wires and collected with a pantograph. The vehicle can also be run on internal batteries (arranged in packs) on sections of the route without overhead wires. There are two main designs for the vehicles: the bi- directional STE series, and the unidirectional SP Prime series. They consist of three to six articulated sections like a conventional tram, with a length from long and wide. Their net weight is , depending upon the number of car sections. Translohr LRVs cannot run without a guide rail therefore they are not classified as buses. Hence, vehicles that are used on the Clermont-Ferrand network do not have license plates. Criticism The Translohr system is more expensive than conventional trams or light rail systems, with higher building and operating costs. The Ch√¢tillon‚ÄìViroflay Line in Paris cost ‚Ç¨27.4m per km, including infrastructure, improvements of the right-of-way, and the purchase of 28 STE6 vehicles.https://www.lesechos.fr/11/05/2016/LesEchos/22189-359-ECH_la-ligne- de-tramway-t6-entre-chatillon-et-viroflay-achevee.htm# In addition, due to the tyres constantly running over the same area of road, there is significant erosion of the roadway; this has already happened with Bombardier Guided Light Transit transit system, resulting in extensive repairs at significant cost to the operator. This adds to already high running costs. Ride quality is also said to be poor and is not much of an improvement over a standard bushttp://www.city-data.com/forum/urban-planning/2132956-nantes-transit- riders-prefer-qualities-brt.html due to the four-wheeled design, whereas trams have trucks (bogies) with shock absorbers or springs. The Translohr system has also suffered some derailments. The Tianjin system suffered a derailment on 20 August 2007, three months after its inauguration.

The process of Tunisian Independence occurred from 1952 to 1956 between France and a separatist movement led by Habib Bourguiba. Bourguiba became the first Prime minister of the Kingdom of Tunisia after negotiations with France successfully brought an end to the colonial protectorate leading to independence.  Overview - the road to Tunisian independence  The first independence movement was formed by the Young Tunisian Party in 1907. By 1920, the Destour, a Tunisian political party, had formed a powerful base that was supported by the Bey. Their following lasted until 1934, when Neo Destour was formed, and brought about by a new generation of young nationalists striving for independence. With a new energized independence movement, the stage was set for a new leader, Habib Bourguiba. With the threat of independence, the French immediately banned Neo Destour and sent Bourguiba to a variety of French prisons in France where he spent the next 20 years of his life. World War II brought about a halt in Tunisia's bid for independence, but helped win Bourguiba a transfer from a French prison to an Axis one in Rome. The Nazis attempted to pressure Bourguiba into helping the Axis powers with his influence over the Tunisian independence fighters in pushing back the Allied invasion of North Africa. He refused - primarily due to his belief that Germany would lose the war and was released from prison in 1943 when the Nazi campaign was finally defeated at El Alamein in Egypt. Upon his return to Tunisia, Bourguiba proposed a concept of gradual independence for Tunisia which was supported by most Tunisians. As a means of forcing the French to leave, the Neo Destour returned to armed resistance by carrying attacks on colonial facilities spearheaded by militants such as Chedly Kallala. As a result, from 1952 to 1954, Bourguiba was imprisoned for the attacks, further fueling the fire between Tunisian Independence and French Rule. In June 1954, new French Prime Minister Pierre Mend√®s France came to power and immediately instituted a withdrawal policy from Tunisia to lessen the violent backlashes occurring in the colonies. France still retained control of Tunisia's foreign affairs, and gradually the nations returned to the same arrangement of 1881. By November 1955, France granted Morocco independence; which helped pave the way for Tunisia's independence. March 20, 1956, Tunisia achieved independence from France proposed by Habib Bourguiba. France, Tunisia, and Western Powers remained in good relations, and maintain significant economic and cultural links to this day. The early Tunisian nationalist movement  Lamine Bey's rapprochement with the nationalists (1948-1951)  After the funeral of Moncef Bey the nationalists of the Neo Destour were more willing to work with Lamine Bey. Salah Ben Youssef met him several times, encouraging him to refuse to apply his seal to laws drafted by the Resident General. Delays in the passing of legislation ensued, and indeed on 1 October 1948 Lamine Bey formally protested when he learned that French residents in Tunisia had been elected to the French National Assembly. Jean Mons was obliged to recognise that once the threat of being deposed had been removed from him, Lamine Bey was determined to win the acclaim of his people and therefore worked willingly with the nationalists. The change of mood was evident on 15 May 1949 on the anniversary of his accession, during a demonstration headed jointly by Ben Youssef and Lamine Bey's own son Chedly. On 4 June, despite Mons' protestations, the Bey received a delegation from the Neo Destour although the party remained under ban following the violent demonstrations of 9 April 1938. In September 1949 the Neo Destourian leader Habib Bourguiba returned to Tunis from exile in Egypt, and one of his first visits was to the Bey. The following year, seeing that nothing was coming of efforts for reform, the Bey sent a messenger to Mons in March 1950 asking for a response to the proposals he had made eight months previously. Mons warned the French government that if he was unable to give a substantial response, the Bey would withhold his seal from the decree confirming the budget for the protectorate. In April, after a meeting with Bourguiba, the Bey wrote directly to French President Vincent Auriol pressing him to agree reforms admitting Tunisians to a substantially larger share of self-government. The Bey's popularity rose. The first Bey since 1881 to leave Tunis, on 14 April he visited Kairouan and on 30 April Sousse, and he was given a rapturous welcome in both towns. On 19 June a new Resident General, Louis P√©rillier, was appointed with an explicit mission from the French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman to prepare Tunisia for internal autonomy the Chenik ministry A new government was formed under M'hamed Chenik, the former Grand Vizier under Moncef Bey, on 17 August 1950. For the first time the Resident General was not able to impose Tunisian ministers of his own choosing. His nomination of Abdelkader Belkhodja was rejected by Chenik, who was supported by the Bey. Chenik was however successful in imposing his own son-in-law Mohamed Ben Salem, as Minister of Health. Mahmoud El Materi, whom the Resident General had put forward for the post, became instead Minister of the Interior.Louis P√©rillier, op. cit., p.81Sa√Ød Mestiri, op. cit., p.58 After five months of negotiations, an initial package of reforms was approved by the Bey on 8 February 1951. Although limited in scope, it was welcomed by Tunisians as a token of future progress. The Bey invested P√©rillier with the Nichan ad-Dam (Order of the Blood) as a gesture of thanks.Louis P√©rillier, op. cit., p.95 However his gratitude was premature as no further negotiations on reforms took place beyond this point. In retaliation Chenik refused to present a budget to the consultative Grand Council, bringing government to an effective standstill.Louis P√©rillier, op. cit., p.102 The Bey was able to add his own protest on the occasion of his address from the throne on 15 May 1951. In this speech, read by Hamadi Badra, he set out an unequivocally nationalist direction and expressed strong support for his government in pursuing nationalist goals.Sa√Ød Mestiri, op. cit., p.112Ahmed Ounaies, Histoire g√©n√©rale de la Tunisie, vol. IV. ¬´ L‚Äô√âpoque contemporaine (1881-1956) ¬ª, √©d. Sud √âditions, Tunis, 2010, p.463 Contrary to custom, the speech was not sent in advance to the Resident General. This caused an outcry among the French colonists who regarded it as an affront to French dignity. On 19 May P√©rillier, in full uniform, accompanied by a military escort, went for an audience with the Bey to make an official protest at this snub, and to ask for the dismissal of Chenik and Ben Youssef.Sa√Ød Mestiri, op. cit., p.113 The following day, the Bey responded with a telegram to President Vincent Auriol, vigorously protesting against the actions and the tone of the Resident General.Sa√Ød Mestiri, op. cit., p.114 Faced with this show of determination, P√©rillier backed down. To break this impasse, Tunisian ministers were invited to Paris to present their demands. On 16 October 1951 Chenik arrived in Paris and submitted a memorandum to Robert Schuman summarising key Tunisian demands for internal autonomy.Sa√Ød Mestiri, op. cit., p.131 The French government responded on 15 December with a flat refusal.Louis P√©rillier, op. cit., p.125 With neither the Bey nor the Grand Vizier willing to give ground, P√©rillier resigned on 24 December. Confrontations with De Hautecloque (1952-1953) Tunisian delegation to the UN, 1952 On 13 January 1952, the new Resident General Jean de Hauteclocque arrived in Tunis on board the cruiser Le Mercure.Fran√ßois Arnoulet, R√©sidents g√©n√©raux de France en Tunisie... ces mal aim√©s, √©d. Narration √©ditions, Marseille, 1995, p.205 He asked for his first audience with the Bey to take place without his ministers present, but Lamine Bey refused this request and it took place with the full Chenik cabinet in attendance.Sa√Ød Mestiri, op. cit., p.224. Hautecloque was back again the following day, to demand the withdrawal of a memorandum outlining Tunisian protests about French rule which he had discovered Chenik's cabinet had sent to the United Nations, and the dismissal of the two ministers responsible for delivering it. He obtained no satisfaction in respect of either demand.Sa√Ød Mestiri, op. cit., p.225 The UN memorandum had been drafted following discussions between Chenik and Chedly Bey, who had insisted that his father not be involved in any way. When Chenik approached Lamine Bey directly seeking his support, he responded that it 'was a matter for the government and for ministers' but raised no objections.Sa√Ød Mestiri, op. cit., p.206 The memorandum was therefore signed by all Chenik's ministers but did not carry the Bey's seal. Having disclaimed involvement in the memorandum itself, the Bey took no responsibility for its consequences when the two ministers who submitted it, Salah Ben Youssef and Hamadi Badra were eventually forced to resign under French pressure.Sa√Ød Mestiri, op. cit., p.214 Ministers in the Chenik cabinet exiled in March 1952 (left to right) Mohamed Salah Mzali, M‚Äôhamed Chenik, Mahmoud El Materi and Mohamed Ben Salem. Following this, the congress of the Neo Destour Party was banned and large numbers of nationalists were arrested. Unrest spread and on 24 January De Hauteclocque was obliged to ask the Bey to issue an appeal for calm, agreeing to withdraw his insistence on the resignation of the Chenik government. Lamine Bey refused to oblige him for as long as Bourguiba and his companions remained in prison.Sa√Ød Mestiri, op. cit., p.234 The Bey refused to give way even under direct pressure from the French Prime Minister Edgar Faure.Mohamed Sayah, Histoire du mouvement national tunisien. Le N√©o-Destour face √† la troisi√®me √©preuve, 1952-1956, tome I ¬´ L'√©chec de la r√©pression ¬ª, √©d. Dar El Amal, Tunis, 1979, p.263 On 25 March, unsuccessful in his requests to meet the Bey in private, De Hauteclocque agreed to an audience with Tunisian ministers present. He once again demanded the resignation of the Chenik government, and the Bey responded with another angry telegram to President Vincent Auriol complaining of De Hauteclocque's discourteous and threatening tone.Mohamed Salah Mzali, op. cit., p.261 Within a few hours, every minister had been arrested and interned. Deprived of the support of his ministers, on 28 March the Bey eventually gave way and signed the decree naming De Hauteclocque's nominee Slaheddine Baccouche as his Grand Vizier.Sa√Ød Mestiri, op. cit., p.257-258 Train sabotaged by militant nationalists Faced with the imposition of a government they regarded as having no legitimacy, Tunisians protested and demonstrated ever more vigorously. The opposition was so intense that on 14 April Baccouche attempted to present his resignation to the Bey. The Bey responded 'You should not address your resignation to me since I did not appoint you. Address yourself to him who has imposed you on me.'Mohamed Ben Salem, op. cit., p.72 Baccouche remained in office, with the confidence of neither the Bey nor the people. Disturbances continued and there were outbreaks of sabotage. Lamine Bey continued to refuse to issue any appeal for calm for as long as thousands of his subjects remained interned. To increase the pressure on him, his daughter Princess Zakia was arrested on 29 April and accused of plotting sabotage with her friend Rafia Bornaz.Mohamed Ben Salem, op. cit., p.73 The Bey's doctor, Mohamed Ben Salem, was prevented from visiting him despite his suffering from a lung infection. To show his defiance, the Bey went in person to the house of his daughter and her husband, and gave a thousand-franc note to each of the policemen guarding the house in ironic thanks for their valuable 'protection'.Mohamed Ben Salem, op. cit., p.76 On 7 June, an individual named Mohamed Achouri, one of the entourage of the future Bey al- Mahalla Essadok Bey, surrendered a sachet of poison to the palace doctor Abderrahmen Mami, claiming that he had been ordered to give it to the cook. When questioned, he implicated the Resident General's Chief of Staff Jacques Grellet and a second man known as Jacobson. Despite the matter being the subject of a criminal complaint, Achouri disappeared and the matter was covered up.Mohamed Ben Salem, op. cit., p.78Ahmed Ounaies, op. cit., p.482 The Assembly of Forty with Lamine Bey The ministers who had been interned were gradually released, and some gathered around Lamine Bey to offer him support. Determined to boycott the Baccouche government, the Bey relied more and more on his son Chedly and surrounded himself with counsellors he felt he could trust, including Mzali, Farhat Hached, H√©di Nouira and Sadok Mokaddem.Mohamed Salah Mzali, op. cit., p.271 Without a properly-functioning government, proposals for reform were unilaterally issued from Paris and presented to the Bey for his signature on 28 July. To the chagrin of De Hauteclocque, Lamine Bey refused to sign them straight away and said he would take two or three months to consider them. On 1 August he brought together in his palace in Carthage forty leading Tunisian figures representing a range of views to seek their opinions on the proposals from France.Louis P√©rillier, op. cit., p.164Mohamed Sayah, tome I ¬´ L'√©chec de la r√©pression ¬ª, p.499 After a month of debates and consultations, the Assembly of Forty rejected the French proposals as unsatisfactory. According to Ahmed Mestiri the minute outlining the rejection was drafted in secret by the underground leadership of the Neo Destour before being passed to the Assembly through Hached and Mokaddem and approved by them.Ahmed Mestiri, T√©moignage pour l‚ÄôHistoire, √©d. Sud √âditions, Tunis, 2011, p.57 On 9 September 1952 the Bey sent a letter to the Resident General, addressed to President Auriol, declaring his refusal to sign the reform proposals. Soon after Lamine Bey confided his despondency about the future to Ben Salem: 'There is nothing to hope for from different French governments. I am old and tired. It may be that I will never see our country independent, but never mind..... when one plants a tree, one must not hope at the same time to eat its fruits.'Mohamed Ben Salem, op. cit., p.97  Assassinations and terror (1952-1953)  Farhat Hached The Resident General persisted in his attempts to pressure the Bey into signing the French reforms. On 30 November he surrounded the palace with troops, on the pretext of protecting the Bey from the large demonstrations expected for the Mawlid festival.Mohamed Ben Salem, op. cit., p.106 With all his nationalist advisers either in prison or in exile, the Bey had no-one to support him apart from Farhat Hached, the trade union leader, who visited him every day, encouraging him to stand firm.Anissa El Materi Hached, Mahmoud El Materi, pionnier de la Tunisie moderne, √©d. Les Belles Lettres, Paris, 2011, p.237 On 5 December 1952, Hached was assassinated by 'La Main Rouge' (The Red Hand), a terrorist unit operated by the French state to eliminate nationalists in North Africa.http://www.webdo.tn/2013/07/08/les-archives-sur-lassassinat-de-farhat- hached-ecartent-toute-implication-tunisienne/ accessed 23/05/2017 Anyone else who might advise or support the Bey was kept out of the way: Mohamed Salah Mzali was obliged to leave Tunis and remain in Monastir and when he tried to telephone the palace he found that all the lines had been cut.Mohamed Salah Mzali, Au fil de ma vie, √©d. Hassan Mzali, Tunis, 1972, p.277 Completely cut off from the outside world, the ailing Bey wrote to the French government once again asking to restart negotiations about internal autonomy.Mohamed Ben Salem, op. cit., p.108 With France's negative response on 20 December, he was able to resist no longer, and signed the decrees formulated months previously in Paris, which allowed for new municipal elections.Mohamed Ben Salem, op. cit., p.111Ahmed Ounaies, op. cit., p.485 Bourguiba, in exile on the Galite Islands, understood all too well the extreme pressure which the Bey had withstood for so long. When he learned that he had finally given way and authorised the French proposals, he remarked 'I don't think we need to throw stones at this venerable old man who struggles alone in almost desperate conditions against an enemy who has no conscience and can exert such pressure. He may have thought... that it was better to bend once again than to be broken.'Mohamed Sayah, tome I ¬´ L'√©chec de la r√©pression ¬ª, p.515 In any case, the reforms imposed by the French, on which they set such great store, remained a dead letter - the nationalists launched a campaign of terror against both candidates and voters. This extended as far as the ruling family itself - on 1 July 1953 the Bey al-Mahalla Azzedine Bey was assassinated inside his own palace, accused of weakening the position of the Bey by conducting discussions of his own with the Resident General. Arrested on the spot, the assassin was tried before a military tribunal, condemned to death on 28 September 1953 and shot on 14 April 1954.Mohamed Sayah (texte r√©unis et comment√©s par), Histoire du mouvement national tunisien.

Dar El Amal, Tunis, 1979, p.73-74 Essadok Bey, son of Mustapha Bey, became the new Bey al-Mahalla. He was not regarded sympathetic to the Neo Destour. On 2 September 1953, Jean de Hauteclocque was finally recalled to Paris.Louis P√©rillier, op. cit., p.77  The Mzali government (1953-1954)  Tensions eased somewhat with the arrival of the new Resident General, Pierre Voizard. As soon as he arrived, Lamine Bey issued a call for calm - something he had always refused to do with De Hauteclocque.Louis P√©rillier, op. cit., p.181 Thousands of prisoners were freed and censorship was scaled back. However Voizard's instructions from the French government made the relative calm only temporary - he was to pursue a reform policy with the Bey only, but not with the Neo Destour. France hoped by this means to drive a wedge between the ruler and the militant nationalists.Louis P√©rillier, op. cit., p.182 Lamine Bey was too wily to be deceived by the apparently pleasant demeanour of the new Resident General. On 16 October 1953 he refused to preside at the opening of the Tunis-Carthage Fair because some repressive measures were still in place.Louis P√©rillier, op. cit., p.183 More efforts were made to appease him - on 1 January 1954 a number of nationalist leaders were freed and promptly received by the Bey. Bourguiba however, regarded by France as highly dangerous, remained confined on La Galite, despite Voizard's requests for his release.Louis P√©rillier, op. cit., p.187 Mohamed Salah Mzali On 24 November 1953 the Bey appointed Mzali to negotiate a new reform package with the Resident General. On 18 January 1954, sufficient progress had been made that the Bey asked him to form a new government.Mohamed Ben Salem, op. cit., p.138 The key elements in the newly-agreed structure of government were - the majority of ministers were to be Tunisians; the Grand Vizier was to act as head of the government; the assent of the Resident General was no longer to be required to give effect to governmental decrees; local governors and mayors were to be appointed by and responsible to the Grand Vizier and not to the Resident General; and a national assembly was to be created.Louis P√©rillier, op. cit., p.193 A number of nationalists, including H√©di Nouira, were willing to give these reforms a chance,Anissa El Materi Hached, op. cit., p.245 but the refusal to free Bourguiba remained a stumbling block for many Tunisians, and indeed, for Bourguiba himself. 'The failure of an old man terrorised by the fear of deposition and exile, combined with the vile ambition of an unscrupulous adventurer risk depriving Tunisia of the only asset that remains to it: it standing as a nation state; its legal character, recognised internationally by treaty and confirmed by the General Assembly of the United Nations. Suddenly my release has been postponed indefinitely' he commented.Mohamed Sayah, vol. 2 ¬´ La victoire ¬ª, p.193 On 27 May Bourguiba, who had recently been transferred from La Gailte to custody in France, returned to the Bey the Grand Cross of the Nichan Iftikhar which he had received in 1950.Ahmed Ounaies, op. cit., p.492 Mzali's cabinet resigned on 17 June 1954 and no successor was appointed. Bitter at the defeat of his efforts, the Bey confided to Voizard 'For a year, since I have been asking for Bourguiba to be released or transferred to a spa, I have received nothing but threats. Then you transfer him to a remote island without seeking my opinion. Now you are transferring him close to Paris, depriving me of the goodwill I might have earned by securing this move for him. I am ready to take up my rifle and become a fellagha to rebuild my contact with my people, for you have done everything possible to separate me from them.'Mohamed Ben Salem, op. cit., p.159  Independence talks (1954-1956)  welcoming Mend√®s France, 31 July 1954 On 31 July 1954 the new French Prime Minister Pierre Mend√®s France arrived in Tunis. He was received by Lamine Bey in the palace of Carthage, where he announced internal autonomy for Tunisia. This was a welcome surprise for the Bey, who had been kept at arm's length from the negotiations between Mend√®s France and the Neo Destourians before his visit. Shortly afterwards, the Bey addressed his subjects: 'A new phase has just begun in the life of our beloved country. It is hard for us to recall the painful days that all of Tunisia has lived through.... before this decisive step in our national life, we must stand equal to our destiny in offering to the world the spectacle of a united people marching serenely towards progress. This great constructive effort to which we are summoned can only bear fruit for us through order, peace and security, which all the inhabitants of this country have the right to enjoy.'Louis P√©rillier, op. cit., p.222 There was no doubt however that the balance of forces had shifted decisively away from the Bey. For France, the experience of the failed Mzali government highlighted the futility of hoping to evolve political institutions by means of negotiating only with the Bey. The new Resident General, Pierre Boyer de Latour was quick to understand thisPierre Boyer de Latour, V√©rit√©s sur l‚ÄôAfrique du Nord, √©d. Librairie Plon, Paris, 1956, p.79 and it was now the Neo Destour who were the sole interlocutors for the Tunisian people. Tahar Ben Ammar, Lamine Bey and Habib Bourguiba in 1955 Despite the repeated efforts of the Bey, a new government was formed without consulting the palace. To recover some semblance of his former influence, on 10 August he proposed to the French government that the institution of the beylicate should be replaced with a full monarchy, which would give him the authority he felt was appropriate. He was willing, in return, to sign supplementary agreements to the Treaty of Bardo necessary to maintain Franco-Tunisian cooperation and preserve the French presence in Tunisia. At the same time, he opened communications with Salah ben Youssef, in exile in Geneva. None of these approaches led to anything.Khalifa Chater, Tahar Ben Ammar (1889-1985), √©d. Nirvana, Tunis, 2010, p.189 After six months of negotiation, the autonomy accords were signed on 3 June 1955. Bourguiba had returned to Tunis on 1 June, welcomed as he came down the gangplank by the Bey's three sons,Mohamed Sayah, vol. 2 ¬´ La victoire ¬ª, p.650 and by a giant demonstration of Tunisians. Having crossed the capital in triumph, Bourguiba visited the Bey in Carthage, apparently unmindful of having returned his decoration only a few months before,Ahmed Mestiri, op. cit., p.87 and made a stirring declaration of the deep attachment felt by the Tunisian people towards beylical rule.Victor Silvera, ¬´ Du r√©gime beylical √† la R√©publique tunisienne ¬ª, Politique √©trang√®re, vol. 22, , 1957, On 7 August the Bey applied his seal to the conventions agreed with FranceLouis P√©rillier, op. cit., and on 1 September, for the first time since the protectorate was established in 1881, he applied his seal to decrees that had not been authorised by the Resident General. On 29 December 1955 his seal confirmed a decree establishing a Constituent Assembly for the country, with elections to be held on 8 April 1956. Tunisia appeared to be evolving into a constitutional monarchy.Louis P√©rillier, op. cit., Salah Ben Youssef arrives in Tunis, 13 September 1955 In fact, power continued to ebb rapidly away from Lamine Bey as independence approached. Salah Ben Youssef returned from exile on 13 September 1955, giving the Bey hopes that his political power would start to be restored. He was close to Ben Youssef, who had been one of the few politicians to pay his respects to him at the time of his installation in 1943. However violence quickly erupted between followers of Ben Youssef and those of Bourguiba, leaving the Bey to vainly attempt to act as arbiter between them. The French had already transferred authority over the police force from the Resident General to the Tunisian government, whose ministers had been chosen by Bourguiba, so Ben Youssef's representations to the Bey had no effect. On 2 December the Bey summoned the Resident General (now known as the High Commissioner) Roger Seydoux to remind him of France's responsibility for public order - which in fact it no longer had. In effect, the Bey was appealing for a restoration of colonial powers from the nationalist government.Khalifa Chater, op. cit., As his appeals had no effect he made use of the only power remaining to him and refused to apply his seal to the decrees authorising the forthcoming elections and the appointment of local governors and mayors. This move was welcomed by Ben Youssef, who demanded a ministerial reshuffle, but naturally alienated the Bey further from Bourguiba and his followers. He backed down and signed them the following day.Khalifa Chater, op. cit., Ben Youssef fled the country on 28 January and a crackdown followed on his followers in Tunisia, in which Bourguiba relied on the army, with its French officers, the airforce and heavy artillery. Horrified at this brutality, Lamine Bey renewed his ineffective protestations to Seydoux in April 1956. The only effect was to enrage Bourguiba, who hastened to the palace to accuse the Bey and his family of seeking to hinder the transfer of power from France to the Tunisian government.B√©chir Turki, √âclairage sur les recoins sombres de l‚Äô√®re bourguibienne, √©d. Clairefontaine, Tunis, 2011, On 20 March 1956 the Franco-Tunisian protocol was signed by the Grand Vizier Tahar Ben Ammar and the French Foreign Minister Christian Pineau. The new Tunisian government, led by Bourguiba, deemed the country to be independent by virtue of this protocol, and therefore refused to enter into the subsequent bilateral negotiations it provided for. Independence was regarded as a fait accompli, and for this reason the independence protocol was never ratified either by the Bey, or indeed by France, although this is what the protocol on internal autonomy required.Victor Silvera, ¬´ R√©flexions sur la crise des rapports franco-tunisiens ¬ª, Politique √©trang√®re, vol. 23, , 1958, See also *Tunisian national movement *Bizerte crisis *Algerian War References Further reading *Hole, Abigail, Michael Grosberg, and Daniel Robinson, Tunisia, Lonely Planet, 2007. pp28‚Äì33. *John Gunther, Inside Africa, Harper & Brothers, New York, 1955. pp146‚Äì162. *Us Army, multiple authors, Tunisia ‚Äì a Country (study), 1st ed.

History The town developed following the late 17th century establishment by monks of a paper mill within the town powered by the fast flowing Senninger Brook. Following a fire in 1750, Pierre Bourgeois, a French immigrant, ordered the facilities of the mill enlarged and the residential property on the site rebuilt in the classical style. Output was increased under the ownership of Jacques Lamort throughout the early 1800s, with mechanisation improvements to the mill and the canalisation of the Senninger Brook. However, as a result of economic problems, the mill was finally closed in 1882. The same year, the site was bought by Ernest Derveaux who demolished the mill and transformed the owner's residence into a revival-style castle, Senningen castle, (), which included neo-gothic wings, and a landscaped surrounding park with ornamental plants and trees and lake with a fountain. From 1940 to 1944, the Nazis used the castle as a convalescent home for artists during the occupation of Luxembourg. In 1952, the Luxembourg army used it for one of its battalions until 1968. Since then, the site has acted as the seat of Luxembourg's National Communications centre, as well as a conference centre for use during State visits, with a press room and cabins for interpreters. Additional renovation work was completed in 2004. The Luxembourg government used the site for European Council summits during its 1991 and 1997 presidencies of the Council of Ministers. On 24 May 2007, Senningen Castle hosted Russian President Vladimir Putin and Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker for an official visit.

Johnston Richard \\"Dick\\" Norris Williams II (January 29, 1891 ‚Äì June 2, 1968), generally known as R. Norris Williams, was an American tennis player and RMS Titanic survivor. Biography Richard Norris Williams II Williams was born in Geneva, Switzerland, the son of Philadelphia parents Charles Duane Williams, a direct descendant from Benjamin Franklin, and Lydia Biddle White. He was tutored privately at a Swiss boarding school and spoke fluent French and German. He started playing tennis at age 12, mainly under the guidance of his father. On January 11, 1919 in Paris, France, Williams married Jean Haddock (1890‚Äì1929), daughter of Arthur Henry and Matilda (Stewart) Haddock. They would have four children. Jean died aged 38 on April 20, 1929 in Philadelphia. Williams remarried to Frances West Gillmore (1908‚Äì2001), daughter of Major General Quincy Adams Gillmore II and Frances West (Hemsley) Gillmore, on October 2, 1930. She was a great-granddaughter of Quincy Adams Gillmore. =Tennis career= In 1911 Williams won the Swiss Championship. A year later he entered Harvard and became the intercollegiate tennis champion in singles (1913, 1915) and doubles (1914, 1915). Williams is best known for his two men's singles titles at the U.S. Championships in 1914 (beating Maurice McLoughlin in the final) and 1916 (beating Bill Johnston in the final). He was also on the victorious American Davis Cup team twice: in 1925 and 1926 and was considered a fine doubles player. He also had a reputation in singles of always hitting as hard as possible and always trying to hit winners near the lines. This made him an extremely erratic player, but when his game was sporadically \\"on\\", he was considered unbeatable. During the 1924 Olympics, at the age of 33 (and with a sprained ankle), Richard Norris Williams became a Gold Medalist in the mixed doubles, partnering Hazel Hotchkiss Wightman. He went on to captain several winning Davis Cup teams from 1921 through 1926 as well as the 1934 team. At age 44 he retired from Championship Tennis. He was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame (Newport, Rhode Island) in 1957. =RMS Titanic= Williams also gained fame as being a survivor of the RMS Titanic disaster in April 1912. He and his father, Charles Duane Williams, were traveling first class on the liner when it struck an iceberg and sank. Shortly after the collision, Williams freed a trapped passenger from a cabin by breaking down a door. He was reprimanded by a steward, who threatened to fine him for damaging White Star Line property, an event that inspired a scene in James Cameron's film Titanic (1997). Williams remained on the doomed liner almost until the very end. At one point Williams' father tried to get a steward to fill his flask. The flask was given to Williams and remains in the Williams family. As Titanic began her final plunge, father and son jumped into the water. While Dick was able to save himself, his father was killed by the first funnel falling from the ship. The 21-year-old Williams recalled, \\"I saw one of the four great funnels come crashing down on top of him. Just for one instant I stood there transfixed ‚Äì not because it had only missed me by a few feet ‚Ä¶ curiously enough not because it had killed my father for whom I had a far more than normal feeling of love and attachment; but there I was transfixed wondering at the enormous size of this funnel, still belching smoke. It seemed to me that two cars could have been driven through it side by side.\\" He made his way to the partially- submerged Collapsible A, holding onto its side for quite a while before getting in. When Williams entered the water, he was wearing a fur coat which he quickly discarded along with his shoes. Those in Collapsible A who survived were transferred to Lifeboat 14 by Fifth Officer Harold Lowe. Although abandoned by RMS Carpathia, Collapsible A was recovered a month later. Onboard the lifeboat was the discarded fur coat which was returned to Williams by White Star.Colonel Archibald Gracie ‚Äì The Truth About The Titanic (1913), New York, Mitchell Kennerley After entering the lifeboat, he spent several hours knee-deep in the freezing water. Carpathia arrived on the scene to rescue survivors. The ordeal left his legs so severely frostbitten that the Carpathias doctor wanted to amputate them. Williams, who did not want his tennis career to be cut short, opted instead to work through the injury by simply getting up and walking around every two hours, around the clock. The choice worked out well for him: later that year, he won his first U.S. Tennis Championship, in mixed doubles, and went on to win many more championships including the Davis Cup with fellow survivor Karl Behr. It was not until after the publication of A Night to Remember (1955), a book about the Titanic disaster, that Williams became acquainted with its author Walter Lord. In 1962, Williams met with Lord and gave a detailed account of the sinking. =Military service, business career, historical society= Williams served in the United States Army during World War I and was awarded the Croix de Guerre and the Legion of Honor.

George departed in 1950, and Lonzo was later portrayed by Johnny Sullivan (1917‚Äì1967) from 1950 to 1967 and by David Hooten from 1967 to 1985, when the band retired (with some final shows performed by Sullivan and first Cleo C. Hogan, then Billy Henson, the latter of which eventually bought the rights to the name). Lonzo and Oscar owned a record label, a recording studio, and a music publishing company. The recording studio and the record label were called \\"Nugget\\". The music publishing company was called \\"Lonzo and Oscar (BMI)\\". Melba Montgomery's first recordings were released on Nugget Records in the late 1950s through the early 1960s. The songs which Starday Records released by Melba Montgomery in the 1960s came from Nugget Records. Harlan Howard recorded an album with Nugget Records. Danny Harrison, Melba Montgomery, and Darnell Miller wrote for Lonzo and Oscar's publishing company, Lonzo and Oscar (BMI). Biographies =Lloyd George= Lloyd George was born to parents Austin and Myrtle George in a duplex house in Cordova, Alabama on June 27, 1924. In 1930, Austin operated a cafeteria and Myrtle worked in a cotton mill. About 1931, they moved to the mill village in Haleyville, Alabama, where better jobs were available, and where Lloyd went to school. He ordered a cheap guitar from Sears and Roebuck and always loved music. George had a local group called the Rhythm Rascals, and he also played with Sonny James Loden and his family, as well as gospel singer Jake Hess. The Rhythm Rascals consisted of Will Harvey Jones, James \\"Snookem\\" Turner, a fiddle player, and a Mr. Howell. At age 14, George made his debut radio broadcast on WMSD-AM in Sheffield, Alabama. He graduated from Haleyville High School in 1942. Turned down by the military for World War II, he moved to Nashville and got a gig with Curly Fox and Texas Ruby, but soon he was playing bass with Eddy Arnold after Arnold's bassist, Gabe Tucker, left. =Rollin Sullivan= Rollin Sullivan was born in Edmonton, Kentucky, one in a family of ten. Rollin (born January 9, 1919) and brother Johnny Sullivan (born July 7, 1917) toured together in the 1930s; they were also in a local group known as the Kentucky Ramblers. They made their professional debut on WTJS-AM in Jackson, Tennessee, about 1939. In 1942, Rollin joined Paul Howard's Arkansas Cotton Pickers playing an electric mandolin, where he received the nickname Oscar. Johnny was in the military at the time. In the summer of 1944, Rollin, with WSM-AM's Grand Ole Opry, played tent shows with Eddy Arnold. Johnny and his wife Ruth Evelyn Sullivan were killed in a car crash near Evanston, Wyoming, on October 9, 1959, while traveling with the Grand Old Opry. Rollin was injured but recovered. Lonzo and Oscar By 1945, the Sullivan brothers joined George with Arnold's show. They played a comedy act called Cicero and Oscar, opening shows for Arnold and His Tennessee Plowboys. George was Cicero and Rollin was Oscar. One evening the troupe stopped at a hotel. \\"While we was checking in, this black man, a porter, was coming down the steps just covered with dirty linen. The desk clerk looked up and said, ‚ÄòLonzo! Don‚Äôt you ever come down those front steps with dirty linen anymore,‚Äô\\" recounted Rollin. Arnold then changed Cicero to Lonzo. According to Rollin, they would \\"go out on the stage, and boy, we‚Äôd wang-bang them, get them all laughing and having a good time [Lonzo and Oscar got 20 minutes before Arnold.] Then we introduced Eddy. Eddy came out on the stage, and he would sing ‚ÄòMommy Please Stay Home with Me,‚Äô and they‚Äôd all start bawling.\\" Rollin continued on the electric mandolin, recording for Arnold on November 21, 1945. By Arnold‚Äôs next two recording dates on March 20 and September 24, 1946, all three were playing as session musicians: George played bass and Johnny Sullivan played guitar. In 1947, Arnold signed George and Sullivan with his label, RCA Victor. They recorded their first songs on May 18, 1947, which were released in August. George named the group Lonzo and Oscar with their Winston County Pea Pickers. Sullivan still recorded for Arnold throughout 1947, but at the end of the year, Arnold let Lonzo and Oscar go. Besides persuading Steve Sholes of RCA Victor to get them a contract and landing them a spot on the Grand Ole Opry, he also hired Johnny Sullivan to manage a record store Arnold owned in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. Lonzo and Oscar with their Winston County Pea Pickers recorded 16 songs for RCA. Their best selling song was released in 1948. Written by Dwight Latham and Moe Jaffe, \\"I‚Äôm My Own Grandpa\\" became their signature tune and was recorded by many others. It sold over four million copies. Originally, RCA Victor approached Arnold to sing and release this record, but Arnold thought that it would better suit Lonzo and Oscar. In 1949, the team switched record companies, finding their home with Capitol Records. Their first recording date with Capitol was August 21, 1949; however, George recorded his first songs as Ken Marvin on Capitol two days before he recorded with Rollin as Lonzo and Oscar. They recorded ten songs for Capitol. By the end of January 1950, Lloyd left the group to solo as Ken Marvin. George asked Rollin if he could quit, and told him \\"sometime in my life, I am gonna try to go solo. It's something that I've always wanted to do.\\" Lloyd had to use a different name because WSM stipulated that Lloyd would have to give up the name Lonzo. Johnny Sullivan then took on the role. Rollin produced the duo from this point on. They went to Decca Records and released 29 singles. In 1963, the group scored another hit with \\"Country Music Time\\". Johnny Sullivan died of a massive heart attack on June 5, 1967, and Rollin continued with Lonzo and Oscar when he found David Hooten, the third Lonzo. In the duo's third incarnation, Lonzo and Oscar made a brief comeback in the 1970s when they recorded the album Traces of Life. A departure from their earlier comedy material, the album consisted primarily of sentimental and religious songs. The title track, a middle-aged man's tribute to home and people who (now deceased) made a difference during his formative years, reached No. 29 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart in March 1974.Hot Country Singles chart, Billboard, March 23, 1974, pg. 48. George's later years Following his departure from the duo, George continued performing under the stage name Ken Marvin. George continued recording throughout the 1950s; he released many songs on the Capitol, Mercury, RCA Victor, Intro, Todd, and Briar labels. In the 1960s, he changed his stage name from Ken Marvin back to Lloyd George, where he released songs on Imperial Records. His best known song is \\"Uh-Huh Honey\\", which nearly became a hit. He was also a disc jockey on WSKY-AM in Asheville, North Carolina in 1956. After George stopped making records later in his life, he booked shows for Bill Monroe. He married Clyda Ogletree, a singer in a trio (January 15, 1924-June 6, 1990). They lived in Cookeville, Putnam County, Tennessee, and had one daughter, Claudia Faye. George died October 16, 1991. He and his wife are buried at Netherland Cemetery in Overton County, Tennessee.

A satire on door-to-door salesmen, it stars Timothy Spall, who was nominated for a British Academy Television Award for Best Actor for his performance. Plot Pete, a young man trying to make a living by creating mixtapes of electronic music, acts as a DJ accompanying his girlfriend Sheila while she performs a stripogram at a retirement party for 'Throat', an elderly vacuum salesman with two weeks to live. 'Throat' dies at the party and Pete is offered a job as a replacement for 'Throat'. For his training period, Pete is paired with Tommy Rag, a gruff and aggressive high- performing salesman who feels superior to the rest of the office and views a salesman nicknamed 'Pockmark' as his only real competition for the next prize for leading sales, a two-week vacation in Benidorm. Sheila tells Pete that she will not have sex with him anymore until he makes his first sale. The next morning, Tommy gives Pete a new suit and throws his old clothes out the window of the moving car. Pete asks to make a sale on his own and offers to split the commission with Tommy. Tommy drops Pete off in a poor area and warns him to get out quickly after the sale without listening to any sob stories. He sells a vacuum to a single mother of four who continuously laments all of her troubles, then he notices her crying after he leaves. Sheila welcomes him home in a leather catsuit, eager for sex, but Pete is so wracked with guilt that he returns to the poor woman's home, takes back the vacuum, tears up her contract and gives her some money. While he is leaving he is beaten and robbed of the vacuum by three young men. He apologises to Sheila, who calls him a loser. The next morning Pete finds a note from Sheila that she has left. Desperate to get information about Sheila's whereabouts, he kicks open the door of an elderly downstairs neighbour nicknamed 'Clayface', only to find a candlelit room full of stacks of newspapers, some dating back to 1945. He turns a corner and is shocked to discover the old woman's corpse, causing him to bump into a candle and set the newspapers on fire. He smothers the fire with newspapers as Tommy impatiently beeps the car horn. While waiting on hold for the police, Tommy tells Pete of a dream he had about Uki, the new Head of IT, transforming the office into a sales call centre operated by intelligent women gently guiding customers toward the sale instead of the aggressive sales approaches he currently knows and admits to hating. In the dream he follows her into a computer screen leading to a tropical beach. She is gone but there is a gold vacuum on the beach and he begins vacuuming completely nude in Paradise, weeping tears of joy. At the next house, Tommy goes upstairs to have sex with the potential customer, whom he has nicknamed 'Spaniard', while Pete has sex with her lonely mentally handicapped daughter. Tommy successfully closes the sale but Pete once again feels guilty about the experience. They pick up a hitchhiker, a DJ who calls himself 'De Kid'. Pete asks him questions about how he got started and asks him to listen to his mixtape. De Kid takes the tape and promises to play it at his show that night, then tells Pete the secret that 'silence is loud'. Tommy drops off the final sales contracts at the office as Pete falls asleep and dreams about life as a successful DJ. He awakens to find 'Spaniard' and her daughter in the car as Tommy is driving them to the prize ceremony at Metropole Hotel in Blackpool, predicting himself the winner. At the prize ceremony, Uki announces 'Pockmark' as the winner of the Golden Vac award. Tommy ties with the deceased 'Throat' for second place. Enraged, Tommy barges into the ladies' restroom and demands answers from 'Stonecheeks'. She admits to him that this will be the last competition and that Uki, who she jealously reveals is in an intimate relationship with the boss, will be working to focus more on Internet sales, eliminating many of the jobs for salesmen. She tells Tommy that he was one sale short of 'Pockmark' and that he tied with 'Throat' because the boss convinced the other salesmen to donate some of their sales to the 'Throat Memorial'. Meanwhile, Pete sees that De Kid is working as the DJ at the party and that his own mixtape is getting the crowd dancing. Tommy suddenly pulls the plugs on the DJ equipment and angrily begins choking Pete, whom he blames for the loss, but is stopped by the mentally handicapped girl lashing him with a whip to protect Pete. Tommy is sacked and kicked out on the street. Peter is given a chance to work the DJ equipment to the adulation of the crowd as Tommy angrily storms toward the sea, discarding his clothing and ultimately throwing a vacuum into the tide before he collapses. 'Spaniard' chases after him and finds his dead body on the beach.

Despite being one of the most powerful classes of destroyers in the world at the time of their completion, none survived the Pacific War.Globalsecurity.org, IJN Shiratsuyu class destroyers Kawakaze, built at the Fujinagata Shipyards was laid down on 25 April 1935, launched on 1 November 1936 and commissioned on 30 April 1937. Operational history At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Kawakaze was assigned to Destroyer Division 24 of Destroyer Squadron 4 of the IJN 2nd Fleet, and had sortied from Palau as part of the Philippine invasion force, covering landings at Legaspi and Lamon Bay. From January 1942, Kawakaze participated in operations in the Netherlands East Indies, including the invasions of Tarakan Island, Balikpapan and Makassar. After covering the invasion of Java, Kawakaze engaged a group of Allied destroyers during the Battle of the Java Sea, and was credited with assisting in the sinking of the American destroyer , and the British cruiser and destroyer , rescuing 35 British survivors from both ships. In April, Kawakaze assisted in the invasion of Panay and Negros in the Philippines. From 10 May, Kawakaze was reassigned to the IJN 1st Fleet and returned to Sasebo Naval Arsenal for repairs at the end of the month. During the Battle of Midway on 4‚Äì6 June, Kawakaze was part of the Aleutians Guard Force under Admiral Shir≈ç Takasu, however, on 14 July she was assigned back to the IJN 2nd Fleet and returned to Truk in mid-August together with the aircraft carrier . On 21 August, while patrolling off of Guadalcanal, Kawakaze sunk the American destroyer . She participated in the Bombardment of Henderson Field on 24 August and was part of the escort for Japanese troop ships at the Battle of the Eastern Solomons. In the remainder of August through early November, Kawakaze participated in ten \\"Tokyo Express\\" high speed transport runs or surface attack missions to Guadalcanal, as well as participating briefly in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands on 26 October under Admiral Nobutake Kond≈ç. During the First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal on the night of 12‚Äì13 November 1942, Kawakaze rescued 550 survivors from the torpedoed transport Brisbane Maru. For the rest of the month, Kawakaze patrolled between Shortland Island, Buna and Rabaul. During the Battle of Tassafaronga on 30 November, torpedoes from Kawakaze possibly hit the American cruiser . In December and through the end of January 1943, Kawakaze continued in transport operations to Guadalcanal and to Kolombangara, shifting to troop evacuation missions from Guadalcanal from February. 1 February 1943, while patrolling off Guadalcanal, she sunk motor torpedo boat PT-37. On 9 February, she suffered significant damage in a collision with cargo ship Toun Maru and had to be towed by the destroyer to Rabaul for emergency repairs, which allowed her to limp back to Sasebo by the end of March. Repairs completed by the end of May, Kawakaze returned to Truk, transported troops to Nauru in early June, and to Kwajalein in late June and Tuluvu on 1 August. On 7 August 1943, Kawakaze was on a troop transport run to Kolombangara. In the Battle of Vella Gulf she was sunk by gunfire and torpedoes of the American destroyers , and , between Kolombangara and Vella Lavella at position . Of her crew, 169 were killed, including her captain, Lieutenant Commander Yanase. She was removed from the navy list on 15 October 1943.

He worked extensively in modern classical music, Third Stream and jazz, and was perhaps best known for having played with pianist Dave Brubeck intermittently from the 1940s to the early 2000s. Smith frequently recorded jazz under the name Bill Smith, but his classical compositions are credited under the name William O. Smith. Biography Smith was born in Sacramento and grew up in Oakland, California, where he began playing clarinet at the age of ten. He put together a jazz group to play for dances at 13, and at the age of 15 he joined the Oakland Symphony. He idolized Benny Goodman, but after high school, a brief cross-country tour with a dance band ended his romance for the life of a traveling jazz musician. He gave two weeks' notice when the band reached Washington, D.C. Encouraged by an older band member to get the best education he could, Smith headed to New York. He began his formal music studies at the Juilliard School of Music, playing in New York jazz clubs like Kelly's Stables at night. Uninspired by the Juilliard faculty, he returned to California upon hearing and admiring the music of Darius Milhaud, who was then teaching at Mills College in Oakland. At Mills, Smith met pianist Dave Brubeck, with whom he often played until Brubeck's 2012 death. Smith was a member of the Dave Brubeck Octet, and later occasionally subbed for saxophonist Paul Desmond in the Dave Brubeck Quartet. Brubeck's 1960 album Brubeck √† la mode featured Smith performing ten of his own compositions with Brubeck's quartet . Smith rejoined Brubeck's group in the 1990s. He studied composition with Roger Sessions at the University of California, Berkeley, where he was graduated with a bachelor's and a master's degree. Winning the Prix de Paris presented Smith the opportunity for two years of study at the Paris Conservatory, and in 1957, he was awarded the prestigious Prix de Rome and spent six years in that city. He has since received numerous other awards, including two Guggenheim grants . After a teaching stint at the University of Southern California, Smith began a thirty- year career at the University of Washington School of Music in Seattle, where he taught music composition and performance, co-leading the forward-thinking Contemporary Group, first with Robert Suderburg, and then with trombonist Stuart Dempster, from 1966 to 1997 . Smith had four children: Mark, Gregory, Rebecca, and Matthew. He died at age 93 in his home from complications of prostate cancer on February 29, 2020 . In 1947, Smith composed Schizophrenic Scherzo for the Brubeck Octet, one of the earliest works that successfully integrated jazz and classical techniques, a style that later was given the name \\"third stream\\" by Gunther Schuller . Smith investigated and cataloged a wide range of extended techniques on the clarinet, including the use of two clarinets simultaneously by a single performer, inspired by images of the ancient aulos encountered during a trip to Greece , numerous multiphonics, playing the instrument with a cork in the bell, and the \\"clar-flute,\\" a technique that involves removing the instrument's mouthpiece and playing it as an end-blown flute. As William O. Smith, he wrote several pioneering pieces that feature many of these techniques, including Duo for Flute and Clarinet (1961) and Variants for Solo Clarinet (1963) . In an article titled \\"Contemporary Clarinet Sonorities\\" (Selmer Bandwagon no. 67, fall 1972, pp. 12‚Äì14), Smith compiled the first comprehensive catalogue of fingerings for clarinet multiphonics . He was among the early composers interested in electronic music, and as a performer he continued to experiment with amplified clarinet and electronic delays. He remained active nationally, internationally, and on the local Seattle music scene until well into his 90s. In 2008, he composed, recorded, and premiered a \\"jazzopera\\" (his preferred term) titled Space in the Heart .

This species is derived from ethylenediamine by replacement of the four amine hydrogens with four methyl groups. It is a colorless liquid, although old samples often appear yellow. Its odor is remarkably similar to that of rotting fish. As a reagent in organic and inorganic synthesis TMEDA is widely employed as a ligand for metal ions. It forms stable complexes with many metal halides, e.g. zinc chloride and copper(I) iodide, giving complexes that are soluble in organic solvents. In such complexes, TMEDA serves as a bidentate ligand. TMEDA has an affinity for lithium ions. When mixed with n-butyllithium, TMEDA's nitrogen atoms coordinate to the lithium, forming a cluster of higher reactivity than the tetramer or hexamer that n-butyllithium normally adopts. BuLi/TMEDA is able to metallate or even doubly metallate many substrates including benzene, furan, thiophene, N-alkylpyrroles, and ferrocene. Many anionic organometallic complexes have been isolated as their [Li(tmeda)2]+ complexes. In such complexes [Li(tmeda)2]+ behaves like a quaternary ammonium salt, such as [NEt4]+. :TMEDA adduct of lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide Notice that the diamine is a bidentate ligand. It is also worth noting that s-BuLi/TMEDA is also a useful combination in organic synthesis. Utilization of this is useful in cases where the n-butyl anion is able to add into the starting material due to its weak nucleophilic nature. TMEDA is still capable of forming a metal complex with Li in this case as mentioned above. Other uses TEMED is used with ammonium persulfate to catalyze the polymerization of acrylamide when making polyacrylamide gels, used in gel electrophoresis, for the separation of proteins or nucleic acids. Although the amounts used in this technique may vary from method to method, 0.1‚Äì0.2% v/v TEMED is a \\"traditional\\" range. TEMED can also be a component of hypergolic propellants.

Pitts Field is a public use airport located two nautical miles (4 km) east of the central business district of Auburn, a city in Lee County, Alabama, United States. The airport is owned by Auburn University and was formerly known as Auburn‚ÄìOpelika Robert G. Pitts Airport. It is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011‚Äì2015, which categorized it as a general aviation facility. The airport offers no commercial service in or out of Auburn. The closest airport of significance outside Auburn is the Columbus Airport ( via US-280) in Columbus, Georgia, roughly a one-hour drive from Auburn. The closest commercial airports are the Montgomery Regional Airport ( via I-85) in Montgomery, Alabama, the Birmingham‚ÄìShuttlesworth International Airport ( via US-280) in Birmingham, Alabama, and the Hartsfield‚ÄìJackson Atlanta International Airport ( via I-85) in Atlanta, Georgia. These airports are within a two-hour driving distance from Auburn, and offer air service to most of the world's major airports. Daily bus/van shuttle service is available from the Auburn area to the Atlanta airport.  History  In its earliest days, the airport was nothing more than a grass field. With one airplane, the airport was very different from its current status. Today, the airport is home to some 97 aircraft and Auburn University's Department of Aviation. When first constructed in 1930, the Auburn‚ÄìOpelika Airport was a private airfield built to serve the sister cities of Auburn and Opelika located in Lee County, Alabama. It was also intended to serve the Alabama Polytechnic Institute (API), later renamed Auburn University. Over the next decade, the airport would go from a private airfield, to a stop along the mail route for the Civil Aeronautics Administration, and eventually become a training ground for the U.S. Military. During its time as a Navy/CAA war training school, the Auburn School of Aviation would be developed. The new airport terminal was dedicated in September, 2010. Over the next several decades, many improvements were made to the airport, making it a standard of excellence in the general aviation field. A new terminal and administration building was constructed in 1950, consisting of both enclosed and open flight decks, a restaurant, flight ready rooms, classrooms, and operations offices with local, state, and federal funds. Also in the 1950s, medium-intensity runway lights were installed, runways were resealed, and an access road to Glenn Avenue was constructed. The 1960s continued to see major improvements to the airport; pavement for aircraft parking was completed along with the reconstruction of the 18/36 and 11/29 runways and taxiways. During the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s a concentrated effort was made to acquire the land and funding for the 18/36 runway extension. Renovations and several improvements were made to the airport facilities, updating them to modern standards. In January 2002, a ribbon- cutting ceremony was held to open the runway extension. It was extended from to and was widened from to . As of August 2006, the Federal Aviation Administration gave clearance for the installation of a glideslope antenna and approach lighting system (MALSF) for runway 36. These improvements were completed in late 2007. Plans are being made for extensive crack repair, pavement rehab, and painting of runway 11/29, along with minor crack repair and repainting of runway 18/36. Site prep work for four hangars, a new ramp area, and a new terminal was started in January 2008.Stallcup, Katie. Airport Director: Plans progressing. Opelika-Auburn News. February 20, 2008. Accessed March 2, 2008. These improvements will help the airport provide better service for the large crowds of people who fly in to attend college football games at Auburn University. In November 2009, the Auburn University Board of Trustees voted to rename the Auburn-Opelika Robert G. Pitts Airport as the Auburn University Regional Airport with the Robert G. Pitts Field.Trustees OK dual degree program. Opelika-Auburn News. A new terminal was dedicated in September, 2010. In July, 2018, the old FBO (serving as the flight education building) was demolished shortly before the newly constructed Delta Air Lines Aviation Education Building was dedicated and opened. That same year, the WWII era hangar and maintenance facilities were demolished and taxiway A, parallel to Runway 18/36, was shifted further west to meet FAA design standards.  Facilities and aircraft  Auburn University Regional Airport covers an area of 423 acres (171 ha) at an elevation of 777 feet (237 m) above mean sea level. It has two runways with asphalt surfaces: 18/36 is 5,264 by 100 feet (1,604 x 30 m) and 11/29 is 4,000 by 75 feet (1,219 x 23 m). For the 12-month period ending July 23, 2010, the airport had 65,445 aircraft operations, an average of 179 per day: 97% general aviation, 2% air taxi, and 1% military. At that time there were 53 aircraft based at this airport: 77% single-engine, 13% multi-engine, 8% jet, and 2% helicopter. The FBO at the Auburn University Regional Airport is staffed from 7:00 AM to 7:00 PM Central Time (-5, -6z) weekdays, 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM weekends. Fuel services are available during this time, as are use of the FBO and airport facilities. There are additional charges or \\"call fees\\" for after hours assistance for fuel or supplies. Services include WSI weather, courtesy cars, aircraft maintenance, oxygen, nitrogen, GPU availability, vending, cable TV, computer workstations, wired and wireless Internet, and LAV service. Maintenance is available during normal working hours, from 7 AM to 4 PM local time. AUO's four mechanics, three of whom have their Inspection Authorization License (IA), can service most all single engine, twin engine, and turbo-prop aircraft, but provide only minor powerplant and airframe service. After hours and weekend service is available on demand at a rate of time and a half.

Despite being one of the most powerful classes of destroyers in the world at the time of their completion, none survived the Pacific War.Globalsecurity.org, IJN Shiratsuyu class destroyers Umikaze, built at the Maizuru Naval Arsenal was laid down on 4 May 1935, launched on 27 November 1936 and commissioned on 31 May 1937. Operational history At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Umikaze was assigned to Destroyer Division 24 of Destroyer Squadron 4 of the IJN 2nd Fleet together with her sister ships , , and , and had sortied from Palau as part of the Philippine invasion force, covering landings at Legaspi and Lamon Bay. From January 1942, Umikaze participated in operations in the Netherlands East Indies, including the invasion of Tarakan Island, and landings at Balikpapan and Makassar. After participating in the invasion of eastern Java, Umikaze was engaged in convoy duty, and thus escaped combat during the Battle of the Java Sea. In April, Umikaze assisted in the invasion of Panay and Negros in the Philippines. From 10 April, Umikaze was reassigned to the IJN 1st Fleet and returned to Sasebo Naval Arsenal for repairs at the end of May. During the Battle of Midway on 4‚Äì6 June, Umikaze was part of the Aleutians Guard Force under Admiral Shir≈ç Takasu. She was assigned back to the IJN 2nd Fleet on 14 July after the Midway Operation was cancelled. Umikaze escorted the aircraft carrier from Yokosuka to Truk in mid-August, and continued on the Guadalcanal, where she was assigned to eleven ‚ÄúTokyo Express‚Äù missions through the end of September. During a mission on 24 September, she suffered damage from a near miss by American aircraft, killing eight crewmen, and necessitating a return to Truk for repairs. In October, Umikaze participated in two missions to bombard Henderson Field on Guadalcanal, and on 26 October was part of Admiral Nobutake Kond≈ç‚Äôs force at the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands. After escorting cruisers and to Shortland Island and making another ‚ÄúTokyo Express‚Äù run to Guadalcanal on 7 November, Umikaze was in the First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal on the night of 12‚Äì13 November 1942. On a troop transport run to Buna, Umikaze suffered heavy damage in an air strike by USAAF B-17 Flying Fortress bombers, and had to be towed back to Rabaul by the destroyer for emergency repairs. Umikaze was withdrawn to Truk by the end of December, and returned to Sasebo for repairs by 5 January 1943. Umikaze returned to active duty at the end of February 1943, escorting a troop convoy to Truk, and then conducting patrols out of Truk to the end of April. In May, after a troop transport run to Kolombangara, she accompanied the battleship from Truk to Yokosuka, returning with the aircraft carriers and . In June, Umikaze led a troop transport mission to Ponape and Nauru and continued on with escort duties between Truk and the Japanese home islands through the end of November. Umikaze went into dock at Sasebo in November, where her ‚ÄúX‚Äù turret was removed and replaced by additional Type 96 anti-aircraft guns. She returned to active duty at the end of December, escorting a troop convoy to Truk, and then patrolling out of Saipan from mid-January 1944. On 1 February 1944, while escorting a convoy from Saipan to Truk, Umikaze was torpedoed and sunk by the submarine off the southern entrance to Truk Atoll (). She sank slowly, allowing for 215 survivors, with 50 crewmen lost. She was removed from the navy list on 31 March 1944.

During World War II, it was known as Smyrna Army Airfield.  History  =World War II= The War Department ordered the construction of a Bombardment Air Base near Nashville on 22 December 1941, shortly after the US had entered World War II. A tract of land consisting of located off US Route 70 in Rutherford County, Tennessee near Smyrna, Tennessee, was selected and acquired by the United States Army Air Forces for use as an Army-Air Force Training Command Base. Six thousand workers erected 200 buildings and an airfield to accommodate the training needs of the Army Air Force. In January 1942, Smyrna Army Airfield was assigned to the AAF Southeast Training Center with the Army Air Force Pilot School (Specialized 4-Engine) activated (phase 3 pilot training). In this phase, cadets flew B-17 Flying Fortress and B-24 Liberator heavy bombers. Pilots graduating this phase were sent on to group combat training with the Second Air Force. Graduates were commissioned as Flight Officers (Warrant Officers), and those who graduated at the top of their class were commissioned as Second Lieutenants. On 8 January 1943, the War Department constituted and activated the 76th Flying Training Wing (Specialized 4-Engine) at Smyrna and assigned it to the AAF Eastern Flying Training Command. Throughout the war, numerous military personnel were stationed at Smyrna. At the end of hostilities, demobilization and defense reductions followed, resulting in the base being deactivated and placed in caretaker status in 1947. However, the installation's inactivity was short-lived and the newly created United States Air Force re-activated the facility as Smyrna Air Force Base in 1948. = 314th Troop Carrier Wing = 100px On 1 November 1948, the 314th Troop Carrier Wing (314 TCW) was formed at Smyrna AFB. The 314th Wing served as a primary troop carrier unit in the eastern United States, involved in joint airborne training with Army forces. Its personnel developed assault airlift operations and participated in aerial demonstrations, exercises, maneuvers, and joint operations.

Smyrna AFB flourished in the late 1940s and 1950s. In the aftermath of World War II, the US military renamed several military establishments in honor of fallen heroes, and the Department of Defense chose to name the Smyrna base after native Tennessean Allan J. Sewart, Jr. of Nashville. On 25 March 1950, Sewart Air Force Base was officially dedicated in honor of this hero who died in a bombing mission over the Solomon Islands in November 1942. Sewart AFB was the only operational C-130 base in the United States in 1958. On 7 January 1960, seven ski-equipped C-130 Hercules from Sewart's 61st Troop Carrier Squadron flew via California, Hawaii, Canton, Fiji and New Zealand to support Operation Deep Freeze ‚Äô60 in Antarctica, during the summer months on the frozen continent. The mission was to supply the U.S. National Science Foundation by landing at two bases at the South Pole and Marie Byrd Land. Lt. Colonel Wilbert Turk, commander of the 61st, led the mission. Staging from Christchurch, New Zealand, the C-130s flew 7:40 hours to McMurdo Sound, Antarctica, on 23 January to establish a record- breaking time previously held by a U.S. Navy R7V Super Constellation. The 114 pilots and support crew were quartered ten miles (16 km) from the Ross Ice Shelf in order to be close to flight operations. The use of the ski-equipped aircraft, which took place during twelve days in the final weeks of the summer support season, was called a significant advance in Antarctic explorations since the aircraft were the first to be able to physically land supplies at the front door of the scientific bases. Previously, supply was accomplished only by parachute by means of U.S. United States Air Force Globemaster aircraft, potentially losing or damaging the food, mail, building materials and delicate equipment. The C-130s carried extra wingtip tanks to extend the flight capability of up to 600 extra miles. The 61st TCS returned to Sewart on 20 February after demonstrating that the ski-equipped C-130s could be successfully employed as ground-landing delivery systems. In subsequent years, Antarctic Development Squadron SIX (VXE-6) of the U.S. Navy took over support of the scientific stations by means of specially modified, ski-equipped LC-130F aircraft. Following the decommissioning of VXE-6, this mission was transferred to the 109th Airlift Wing of the New York Air National Guard which continues to perform polar support missions with the LC-130H aircraft to this day. On 15 January 1966 the 314th Troop Carrier Wing was reassigned to Ching Chuan Kang Air Base (CCK), Taiwan to support the Vietnam War. The 314th also maintained a large detachment of C-130Es at Tuy Hoa Air Base, South Vietnam until 1970. A placeholder unit, the 4413th Troop Carrier Wing was established at Sewart with the wing's departure. At Sewart, the 314th was awarded Air Force Outstanding Unit Awards for the periods of 11 January ‚Äì 14 February 1955, and 1 January 1960 ‚Äì 31 December 1961. =463d Troop Carrier Wing= 100px On 15 January 1959, the 463rd Troop Carrier Wing (463 TCW) moved to Sewart AFB, being transferred from the closing Ardmore Air Force Base, Oklahoma. Along with the 314th, the two wings made up the 839th Air Division (839 AD). The 839 AD supported Tactical Air Command and US Strike Command deployments throughout the world, including back-to-back deployments to Lebanon and Taiwan in response to crisis situations on opposite sides of the world in the summer of 1958. 463d wing crews were involved in numerous operations around the globe until the 463rd transferred to Pacific Air Forces to support the Vietnam War. C-130 squadrons of the 463d at Sewart: *772d Troop Carrier: 25 September 1957 ‚Äì 30 June 1963 *773d Troop Carrier: *774th Troop Carrier: 25 September 1957 ‚Äì 30 June 1963 In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the 774th TCS also included \\"The Four Horsemen,\\" a Tactical Air Command- sponsored C-130 flight demonstration team utilizing four C-130A aircraft. During September 1961, the 463d supported the crisis in Berlin. Then, on 1 October 1962, the wing was redesignated as the 463rd Troop Carrier Wing (Assault). Immediately, the wing deployed to support the Cuban Missile Crisis (October‚ÄìNovember 1962). The wing moved to Langley AFB, Virginia, on 1 July 1963, later deploying to Mactan AB and Clark AB in the Philippines during 1965 to support the Vietnam War. A large detachment was established at Tan Son Nhut AB, South Vietnam, which flew transport missions until 31 December 1971 when the unit was deactivated. At Sewart, the 463d was awarded the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award for the period 15 December 1960 ‚Äì 1 April 1961. =64th Troop Carrier/Tactical Airlift Wing= 100px Lockheed C-130E-LM Hercules AF Serial No. 69-6569 of the 62nd Tactical Airlift Squadron, 20 May 1970. This aircraft was later converted to an AC-130E gunship, then upgraded to an AC-130H, named \\"Fatal Attraction\\". With the departure of the 314th and 463d TCWs to PACAF, the 64th Troop Carrier Wing was activated at Sewart on 7 March 1966, replacing the 4413th. On 1 May 1967 the unit was re-designated as the 64th Tactical Airlift Wing. The 64th initially performed global airlift and medical evacuation missions, including several deployments to South Vietnam and Thailand. However beginning in 1968, its primary mission was providing C-130 combat crew training for other units deploying to the Vietnam War. C-130E squadrons of the 64th at Sewart: *61st Troop Carrier: 1 July 1966 ‚Äì 31 May 1971 (Tail Code: SR), green band on the vertical stabilizer *62d Troop Carrier: 1 July 1966 ‚Äì 31 May 1971 (Tail Code: ST), blue band on the vertical stabilizer At Sewart, the 64th was awarded the Air Force Outstanding Unit Award with Combat \\"V\\" Device for the period 1 July 1966 ‚Äì 30 June 1967 and (without \\"V\\" device) 1 June 1969 ‚Äì 31 May 1971. On 9 December 1965 the Department of Defense announced the closure of several military bases in the United States, including Sewart AFB. Closure activities continued for the next five years and on 9 March 1971, the last C-130 Hercules left one of the Sewart AFB runways. The 64th TAW was inactivated on 31 May 1971 and Sewart AFB was officially closed. =Redevelopment= When the base was deactivated it was transferred to a civilian operation. Ownership of the base was transferred to the Army Corps of Engineers and ultimately to the Smyrna/Rutherford County Airport Authority. The bulk of the property vacated by the USAF was divided between three entities: 1) Rutherford County 2) State of Tennessee and 3) Metropolitan Nashville Airport Authority. Rutherford County formed an Economic Development Committee composed of county commissioners, the county executive and the mayors of the municipalities. This group was instrumental in the conversion of the property obtained from the Department of Defense to private industrial use. Some of the larger industries recruited included Better Built Aluminum, Cumberland Swan, and Square D. During the 1970s many new jobs were created, and as a result, Smyrna's population nearly tripled between 1970 and 1980. The property received by the State of Tennessee has been utilized by the Tennessee Rehabilitation Center. A portion of the base, including some hangar and aircraft ramp space, was retained by the Corps of Engineers and licensed for use by the Tennessee Army National Guard. The Army National Guard established an Army Aviation Support Facility, currently operating 60 helicopters manned by approximately 300 full-time and 700 part-time military personnel, technically qualifying the airport as a joint civil-military airfield. Because of the Army National Guard presence, the airfield was also used as an Air National Guard outlying training field by C-130 Hercules aircraft of the former 118th Airlift Wing, now the 118th Wing, of the Tennessee Air National Guard at Nashville International Airport until 2012. It also continues to be used by C-17 Globemaster III aircraft of the 164th Airlift Wing of the Tennessee Air National Guard at Memphis International Airport. The land granted to the Metropolitan Nashville Airport Authority included the runways, hangars, clear zones and related aviation facilities. The airport property was held for nearly 20 years with few improvements. In 1990, the Metropolitan Nashville Airport Authority agreed to relinquish control and transfer the airport to the newly formed Smyrna/Rutherford County Airport Authority.

History The club was founded in 1966 as Associazione Calcio Boca. In 2002 the club merged with Felsina San Lazzaro (a team from San Lazzaro di Savena founded in 1930 as F.C. San Lazzaro), and its denomination changed to A.C. Boca San Lazzaro. The club has played Serie D/C in 2005‚Äì06, winning it and gaining the right to play 2006‚Äì07 season in Serie C2. However, the team relegated to Serie D after just a single season, being defeated on playoffs by Sansovino, and successively even to Eccellenza. In June 2009, A.C. Boca detached itself from F.C. San Lazzaro and acquired the league rights from newly promoted Serie D club Dorando Pietri Carpi, which was abandoned after its shareholders opted to join forces with Carpi FC 1909. The club chose for a merger with Prima Categoria outfit Vignolese to bypass Serie D relocation laws (that do not allow to move sport rights to a province from another: Boca could not move to the province of Modena from Bologna but Vignola could move to Carpi), and will play its home games in Vignola for the 2009‚Äì10 season.

With terrible curses she cursed Charlemagne and France, and she cursed her own heathen gods and idols. Then she threw the image of Apollin down, taking from him his crown and sceptre and trampling him under foot. \\"Oh, wicked god,\\" she cried, \\"why hast thou brought such shame upon us?

The South Shore Regional Centre for Education was established on August 1, 2004 by an Act of the provincial legislature. Enrollments As of 2020 the school board had an enrollment of over 12,886 students enrolled in elementary, junior and senior schools. Controversies =Religious discrimination= On May 3, 2012, the Board drew attention to itself in the Canadian media for allowing a student from Forest Heights Community School to be suspended by the school's principal for wearing a T-shirt that had the words, \\"Life is wasted without Jesus\\" on it, drawing criticism that it was discriminating against Christians and violating the boy's Charter rights to freedom of expression and religion. The T-shirt was an expression of the scriptural passage from the St. Paul's Letter to the Philippians 3:8, which says, \\"More than that, I even consider everything as a loss because of the supreme good of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have accepted the loss of all things and I consider them so much rubbish, that I may gain Christ....\\". On May 4, 2012, the South Shore Regional School Board decided to allow the boy to return to school on the following Monday and gave him permission to wear the shirt at school. They also hired a facilitator to deal with the issue; however, reports by CTV News indicated that the boy was not sure he wanted to return to school, feeling both discriminated against by administrators and bullied. =Verbal attack on hearing impaired student= In 2018 Fred Forsyth, a teacher of the Bayview Community School, repeatedly verbally attacked Amy Bennett, a hearing impaired student of the same school, after she went to the bathroom for a prolonged time. Accusing her of skipping classes, he yelled at her for a couple of minutes. The parents of Amy Bennett claimed that the incident caused permanent damage to her ears due to the fact that her hearing aid magnifies certain noises and caused a permanent tinnitus. The incident escalated up to Education Minister Zach Churchill, who made a public statement condemning the teacher for his behavior while denying to meet neither the student nor her parents. In the aftermath, after a 9 months investigation of the accident, there was made no public statement regarding the disciplinary actions against the teacher to protect the privacy of the teacher.

It was adapted into a film by the same title in 1958 by the Polish film director Andrzej Wajda. English translation, entitled Ashes and Diamonds, appeared in 1962. The story takes place during the last few days of World War II in Europe, and describes the political and moral dilemmas associated with the soon to be suppressed Anti-communist resistance in Poland (1944‚Äì1946).Jean Albert B√©d√©, William Benbow Edgerton, Columbia dictionary of modern European literature. Page 632. Columbia University Press, 1980. The protagonist Maciek is a soldier in the underground anti-communist Polish army assigned to kill the Communist Szczuka. The story follows Maciek's and other characters' actions in those ominous days. According to a Polish journalist Krzysztof KƒÖkolewski the original story was the killing of a Communist - and robber - Jan Foremniak, in Ostrowiec ≈öwiƒôtokrzyski in January 1945. The first edition was published in 1947 as Zaraz po wojnie (Directly After the War). Jerzy Andrzejewski rewrote the book according to changing party teachings because he was an eager Communist at that time. Plot The story takes place in Ostrowiec (probably Ostrowiec ≈öwiƒôtokrzyski), Poland, and begins on 5 May 1945, one of the last days of World War II. The characters are all aware that the war will end soon. The Soviet Army had driven the German Army out of Ostrowiec in January, and the Communists are poised to take control of post- war Poland. In the story, Stefan Szczuka is the Secretary of the Province Committee of the Polish Workers' Party (PPR, a party of Communist orientation formed in the Soviet Union), and is expected to play an important role in the new government of Stalinist Poland. A jeep is transporting him to speak at a cement factory in Bia≈Ça, a nearby town. The jeep is being driven by Frank Podg√≥rski, who is the Secretary of the District Committee of the PPR. Podg√≥rski recognizes a friend (Alicja Kossecka) walking alongside the road, and stops to greet her. Podg√≥rski learns from her that her husband Antoni Kossecki, who was a local judge before the war, had returned from the German prison camp Gro√ü-Rosen two days ago. He asks to visit them, and she agrees. Podg√≥rski gets out of the car to talk with his friend which causes a delay. Szczuka impatiently honks the horn to get Podg√≥rski to return to the jeep and resume the trip. Later, as they are driving, Podg√≥rski explains to Szczuka who his friend Alicja Kossecka was and that her husband had just returned from the Nazi captivity. Szczuka mentions that he had also spent time in that prison camp, but cannot remember knowing anyone from Gross-Rosen named Kossecki. Podg√≥rski suddenly remembers that Kossecki had been arrested under an assumed name, so that Szczuka would not have known him as Kossecki, but Podg√≥rski cannot recall what his assumed name was. A short time later, after the jeep passes a narrow point in the road, they find a crowd surrounding another jeep lying on its side at a distance from the road. They stop and go to investigate. They find that the passengers, two workers named Smolarski and Gawlik, have been shot and killed, apparently ambushed at the narrow place in the road they had just passed. On the way back to their own jeep, Szczuka tells Podg√≥rski that he thinks the shots were intended for him (Szczuka). Podg√≥rski suddenly recalls that Kossecki's assumed name was Rybicki. Szczuka recognizes this name, but doesn't say very much about what he remembers. =The anti-communist resistance= Antoni Kossecki and his wife Alicja Kossecka (the couple that Podg√≥rski was telling Szczuka about), have two sons Andrzej (21) and Alek (17). During the war, while his father was at Gross- Rosen, Andrzej was fighting as a partisan, presumably with the Armia Krajowa (AK), although it is never mentioned by name in the story. Andrzej too has now returned home, so the family is together again. Alicja Kossecka returns home from the walk on which she had met Podg√≥rski. She needs 3,000 zloty to purchase some wool. She had hidden this money in a safe place, but discovers that the money has disappeared. The only person who could easily have taken it was her younger son Alek, who was there at home earlier but suddenly left the house shortly after she did. She keeps her suspicions to herself and decides to ask her elder son Andrzej to lend her the money she needs. As she goes to his room, she hears him talking with some friends and overhears fragments of a conversation that he is having with them. These conversation fragments strongly suggest to the reader that Andrzej and his friends were somehow involved in the ambush of the two men in the jeep. Meanwhile, Podg√≥rski drops Szczuka at the Monopol hotel in Ostrowiec, where he is staying. They will both attend a banquet at the hotel later in the evening, but Podg√≥rski says that he first wants to visit Antoni Kossecki, as he had agreed earlier in the day with Alicja Kossecka. As Podg√≥rski and Szczuka part ways, Szczuka asks Podg√≥rski to ask Antoni Kossecki whether he wants to meet him, an old comrade from Gross- Rosen. Podg√≥rski agrees and goes to visit the Kossecki family while Szczuka goes into the hotel. As Szczuka is picking up his room key from the reception desk, a 24-year-old young man, who we later find out is Maciek Chelmnicki, is also at the hotel desk asking for a room. The desk clerk tells Maciek that all the rooms are taken, however Maciek is very persistent and ultimately convinces the desk clerk (with the help of a bribe) to find him a room. By chance, Maciek ends up in the room next to that of Szczuka. Podg√≥rski's visit to Antoni Kossecki turns into a very long conversation, and Podg√≥rski stays late. They talk about how the War subjected people to conditions that brought out the worst in some of them, and to what extent people can be held accountable for their actions under such conditions. While Podg√≥rski is visiting Antoni Kossecki, Szczuka goes to visit his sister-in-law Katarzyna Staniewiczowa, who also lives in Ostrowiec. She has not invited him, and does not expect him to visit, but he feels that he has to tell her that his wife Maria (the sister of Katarzyna Staniewiczowa) has not returned from the prison camp where she had been staying. When Szczuka arrives, Katarzyna Staniewiczowa has guests who are obviously part of the pre-War aristocracy and disapprove of Szczuka's politics. In the next room, unknown to Szczuka, Andrzej Kossecki is meeting with Captain Florian Waga. It is apparent that Captain Waga is Andrzej's commanding officer in a conspiratorial organization (presumably the AK) and has given the order to kill Szczuka, eliminating any doubt that Andrzej and his friends are the ones involved in the ambush earlier that day. Andrzej asks Captain Waga whether it is really necessary to kill Szczuka, and Captain Waga replies that all that matters is that they have been given the order to do so, and that they must obey the order. Back in the living room, the discussion has taken a not very cordial turn. Szczuka confronts the aristocrats about their political views, but feels deflated by the conversation. Szczuka does not tell his sister-in-law about Maria's death in the camp, presumably the reason he came to visit, and decides to leave. After Szczuka leaves, Katarzyna Staniewiczowa and her guests, including Andrzej, all decide to go to the Monopol for entertainment. Captain Florian Waga declines to join them and goes his separate way. =The communist banquet= Back at the Monopol, Maciek Chelmnicki has gone to the hotel bar, where he chats up the bar maid Krystyna. He is quite taken with her, and tries to convince her to come to his room when she is done with work. While waiting for Krystyna's shift to end, Maciek is joined in the bar by his friend Andrzej Kossecki, who has just come from the home of Katarzyna Staniewiczowa. Maciek and Andrzej discuss the botched attempt on Szczuka's life. Andrzej recounts his meeting the Captain Waga, and Maciek promises to finish the job of killing Szczuka. In the main part of the Monopol dining room, separate from the bar, the banquet is beginning. Meanwhile, Alek Kossecki, who has stolen the 3,000 zloties from his mother, is meeting in an abandoned basement with four of his friends, all of whom belong to a conspiratorial organization. During the meeting, their leader Jerzy Szretter calls upon all the attendees to produce the 5,000 zloties that each of them was supposed to bring to the meeting to fund a weapons purchase. All but one of them is able to produce their money. Alek Kossecki confesses that he had to steal part of the money from his mother. The leader tells Alek to keep his money, and demands that his share be paid by Janusz Kotowicz, another of the attendees who is known to have more money than the others. Kotowicz refuses, and Szretter beats him until he surrenders all his money, which turns out to be an enormous amount. Janusz Kotowicz starts to leave, hinting that he will turn them in, prompting Jerzy Szretter to shoot Kotowicz. Back at the hotel, Podg√≥rski has returned from his visit to Antoni Kossecki, and stops by Szczuka's room on his way to the banquet. While they are talking, Szczuka tells Podg√≥rski that Antoni Kossecki had committed horrible crimes while at the Gross-Rosen prison camp. Podg√≥rski, who knew Kossecki before the War, can hardly believe what he is hearing and reflects about the conversation he just had with Kossecki about moral accountability. At the bar of the Monopol, Krystyna asks her coworker to cover for her so that she can leave early and go to Maciek's room. Her coworker agrees, and Krystyna does go to Maciek's room and they spend the night together. Maciek falls seriously in love with her, and begins to reconsider the path he has been following in life. Downstairs, the banquet, which turned into a boisterous party, is ending, and the hotel impresario has the musicians play Chopin's Military Polonaise as the last guests leave. The next day, Maciek spends the entire day with Krystyna. He tells her that he wants to make changes in his life and is thinking about enrolling in a technical school. He meets with Andrzej Kossecki, who is his superior in the secret organization that has ordered the killing of Szczuka which Maciek has been ordered to carry out. Maciek explains to Andrzej that he has fallen in love with Krystyna and wants to change his life, and that he no longer wants to kill Szczuka. Andrzej reminds Maciek that he is under orders to carry out the killing. Maciek finally agrees to kill Szczuka, but says that this will be the last order he will carry out. Maciek writes a note to Krystyna and tells her that he has some business to attend to, and cannot see her for a while. He says that he has to go to Warsaw, and invites her to come with him, and she agrees. Maciek begins to stalk Szczuka, and follows him to the apartment of a woman who had returned from the same camp where Szczuka's wife was imprisoned. Szczuka has gone to see her in hopes of learning the fate of his wife. While Szczuka is in the apartment, Maciek enters and kills Szczuka. He returns to the hotel, where he sleeps for several hours. When he awakes he hurries to catch the train for Warsaw. After having killed Szczuka he is nervous about being recognized, and on his way to the train station he raises the suspicion of a patrol, which orders him to stop. He panics and tries to run, and they shoot him.

Despite being one of the most powerful classes of destroyers in the world at the time of their completion, none survived the Pacific War.Globalsecurity.org, IJN Shiratsuyu class destroyers Suzukaze, built at the Uraga Dock Company was laid down on 9 July 1935, launched on 11 March 1937 and commissioned on 31 August 1937. Operational history At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Suzukaze was assigned to Destroyer Division 24 of Destroyer Squadron 4 of the IJN 2nd Fleet together with her sister ships , , and , and had sortied from Palau as part of the Philippine invasion force, covering landings at Legaspi and Lamon Bay. From January 1942, Suzukaze participated in operations in the Netherlands East Indies, including the invasion of Tarakan Island. She was later assigned to patrols of Staring Bay in the Sulawesi, where she was torpedoed on 4 February 1942 by the submarine . The resultant explosion killed nine crewmen and caused extensive damage, requiring a return to Sasebo Naval Arsenal at the end of March for repairs. Suzukaze was reassigned to the IJN 1st Fleet on 10 April, and back to the IJN 2nd Fleet on 14 June. In mid-August, she returned to active duty, escorting the aircraft carrier to Truk and continuing on to join the rest of the fleet at Guadalcanal. After the Battle of the Eastern Solomons on 28 August, she escorted the damaged cruiser back to Truk. In the remainder of August through early November, Suzukaze participated in twelve \\"Tokyo Express\\" high speed transport runs or surface attack missions to Guadalcanal, as well as participating briefly in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands on 26 October under Admiral Nobutake Kond≈ç. During the First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal on the night of 12‚Äì13 November 1942, Suzukaze rescued 1100 survivors from the torpedoed transport Naka Maru. For the rest of the month, Suzukaze patrolled between Shortland Island, Buna and Rabaul. During the Battle of Tassafaronga on 30 November, Suzukaze barely avoided being struck by a salvo of torpedoes fired from the American destroyer . In December 1942, Suzukaze continued in transport operations to Guadalcanal, suffering from minor damage in an air raid on 1 January 1943, necessitating repairs at Truk at the end of the month, and return to Sasebo in February. Repairs completed by mid-June, Suzukaze escorted the cruisers and to Truk and on to Rabaul by the end of June. During the Battle of Kula Gulf on 5‚Äì6 July, Suzukaze assisted in sinking the cruiser , taking a number of hits in return which disabled her forward guns. After repairs at Yokosuka in late July, Suzukaze was assigned to escort missions between the Japanese home islands and Truk until early November. During a refit at Sasebo at the end of November, her ‚ÄúX‚Äù turret was removed and replaced by additional Type 96 anti-aircraft guns. From the end of December to end of January 1944, Suzukaze escorted numerous convoys to Truk and Ponape. On 25 January 1944, while escorting a convoy from Truk to Eniwetok, Suzukaze was torpedoed and sunk by the submarine north-northwest of Pohnpei (formerly Ponape) at position . She was removed from the navy list on 10 March 1944.

Until 2018, it was an agency of Federally Administered Tribal Areas, with merger of FATA with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, it became a district. Geographically, it covers the Kurram Valley region which is a valley in the northwestern part of Pakistan.The Kurram Valley . Most of the population is Pashtun and the main religion is Islam (Shia and Sunni). Major tribes living in Kurram Agency are Bangash, Turi, Orakzai, as well as Mamozai, Muqbil, Zazai, Mangal, Ghilzai, Para Chamkani, Hazara and Khoshi tribe (Persian speaking tribe). Until the year 2000, when the old divisions were abolished, the Kurram District used to be part of the Peshawar Division of the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan. thumbnail Description The name Kurram comes from the river Kurram, which flows along the valley. In the north it is surrounded by snow-covered or \\"white\\" mountains, the Safed Koh, locally known in Pashto as Spƒ´n Ghar, which also forms the natural border with Afghanistan. Kurram Agency is just like a beak of a bird and is connected with three provinces of Afghanistan named as Khost, Paktia and Nangarhar (Tora bora). Kurram Agency is located in the FATA and its major tribes are Bangash, Turi, Orakzai, Para-Chamkani, Zazai (Jaji), Alisherzai, Alizai, Mangal, Muqbil, Khuaidadkhel and Masozai. In Lower Kurram Agency, Sadda is a scenic place where tribes such as the Bangash reside and Sadda has natural richness depended upon hills and mountain with evergreen forests and fields for growing crops like rice and wheat. The Kurram River drains the southern flanks of the Safed Koh mountain range, and enters the Indus plains north of Bannu. It flows west to east and crosses the Paktia Province Afghan-Pakistan border at about 80 km southwest of Jalalabad, and joins the Indus near Isa Khel after a course of more than . The district has an area of ; the population according to the 1998 census was 448,310. It lies between the Miranzai Valley. It is inhabited by the Bangash and Mangal tribes. thumbnail  History  The Kurram Valley in ancient times offered the most direct route to Kabul and Gardez. The route crossed a pass 3,439 m (11,283 ft) high, just over 20 km west of modern Parachinar and sadda, that was blocked by snow for several months of the year. The valley is highly irrigated, well populated and crowded with small fortified villages, orchards, and groves, to which a fine background is afforded by the dark pine forests and alpine snows of the Safed Koh. The beauty and climate of the valley attracted some of the Mughal emperors of Delhi, and the remains exist of a garden planted by Shah Jahan. According to the Gazetteer of Kurram, the richness of the land gradually weaned the Turks from their nomadic life. Sections built villages and settled permanently; they ceased to be Kuchi and became Kothi this abandonment of their nomadic habits by the majority of the resulted, as it was bound to do, in a contraction of the area in effective possession. The upper Kurram plain was safe as their headquarters, but hills and slopes below the Safed Koh and Mandher over which their graziers had kept an efficient watch, now afforded a menace as a place in which an encroaching tribe could establish itself. To guard against this settlements of Mangals and Muqbils were half invited half allowed to push themselves in conditions of vassalage, and on promise to afford a buttress against any enemy aggression. In the lower Kurram, where for climatic reasons candidates for settlements were fewer, the problem was not easily solved. The Chardi Turis seem to have been the first to abandon their nomadic life. As the numbers who went down to graze every year became less, the area under control contracted. Sangroba and Hadmela were left far behind and as the Turis receded the Watizai Zaimushts gradually pushed in, until all that was left was a settlement at and about Alizai. On the western side the Saragallas retained, and still largely retain their habits. They too put in settlements around Biliamin and after much intervening warfare had finally to admit Bangashes brother not as vassals, but for the rest they retain unimpaired the rights on the western bank which they acquired at the time the conquest. thumbnail With Chardis this was for from being the course left unsupported by their Kuchis they maintained a precarious existence at Alizai until even then they had to give three-fifths of their land to the Watizai Zaimushts in return for their assistance in a feud they had entered upon with Bilyamin. Consequently, the hills and the grazing grounds passed from the Turizun to the Zaimushtzun and as the other Zaimushts section being unopposed had settled themselves on the left bank below Sadda. In the early 19th century the Kurram Valley was under the government of Kabul, and every five or six years a military expedition was sent to collect the revenue, the soldiers living meanwhile at free quarters on the people. It was not until about 1848 that the Turis were brought directly under the control of Kabul, when a governor was appointed, who established himself in Kurram. The Turis, being Shiah Muslims, never liked the Afghan rule. During the second Afghan War, when Sir Frederick Roberts advanced by way of the Kurram Valley and the Peiwar Kotal to Kabul, the Turis lent him every assistance in their power, and in consequence, their independence was granted them in 1880. The administration of the Kurram Valley was finally rendered to British authorities, at the request of the Turis themselves, in 1890. Technically it ranked, not as a British district, but as an agency or administered area. Two expeditions in the Kurram Valley also require mention: (1) The Kurram expedition of 1856 under Brigadier-General Sir Neville Chamberlain. The Turis, on the first annexation of the Kohat district by the British, had repeatedly leagued with other tribes to infest the Miranzai valley, harbouring fugitives, encouraging resistance, and frequently attacking Bangash and Khattak villages in the Kohat district. Accordingly, in 1856 British forces numbering 4,896 troops traversed their country, and the tribe entered into engagements for future good conduct. (2) The Kohat-Kurram expedition of 1897 under Colonel W. Hill. During the frontier risings of 1897 the inhabitants of the Kurram valley, chiefly the Massozai section of the Orakzais, were infected by the general excitement, and attacked the British camp at Sadda and other posts. A force of 14,230 British troops traversed the country, and the tribesmen were severely punished. In Lord Curzon's reorganization of the frontier in 1900-1901, British troops were withdrawn from the forts in the Kurram Valley and were replaced by the Kurram militia, reorganized in two battalions, and chiefly drawn from the Turi tribe. thumbnail In recent years the Kurram Valley has once again assumed a strategic position and has been the site of intense Taliban activities. The armed forces of Pakistan extended their major offensive against Al-Qaeda and Taliban elements in FATA dubbed Operation Rah-e-Nijat to Kurram in December 2009. Archeological findings Ahmad Hasan Dani has recorded several findings in the North Waziristan area.  Administrative divisions  Kurram District is currently subdivided into three tehsils. * Central Kurram Tehsil * Lower Kurram Tehsil * Upper Kurram Tehsil =Parachinar Cantonment= Parachinar is the administrative headquarter of Kurram valley. It has offices of Deputy Commissioner, Assistant Commissioner, Kurram Police, and Kurram Militia, a part of the Frontier Corps (FC) and Pak Army. It is located northwest of the valley. This makes it a part of Upper Kurram. Governor cottage, Shalozan House, Circuit House and Passport office are also located in cantonment area. The name of Parachinar comes from 'Para' (Paarha), one of the tribes of the valley and 'Chinar', the maple trees which are found in abundance in the region and Parachinar in particular. The old name of Parchinar was Tutki and the inhabitants of Tutki were called Tutkiwal and even still, the Afghans call it Tutki. The town (sometimes listed as a city) of Parachinar has a population of around five thousand predominantly {Turi}, {Bangash} and {jaji}. The town has government hospital and many government schools.  Major Towns  Makay village, upper Kurram # Parachinar is the headquarter of district Kurram and the largest city of the district as well.Turi and Bangash tribes live here. # Sadda is the second largest city in district Kurram.Predominantly Bangash and Alisherzai tribes live there. # Dogar is the third largest town in the Kurram Agency. # Tari Mangal Major Dams Kurram Agency has a few water reservoirs locally called Dams. Basically, these are water supply schemes for domestic purposes. No hydroelectric power is generated in these constructions nor are they used for irrigation purpose. =Malana Dam= Located in the north of Parachinar town this dam was constructed in 1857. Most of the population of Parachinar town depend on this reservoir and the dam is famous among the locals as a picnic resort. A guest house is built here by the Agency administration. =Zeran Dam= Zeran dam is located to the north-east of Prachinar. It is also famous for its scenic beauty. This reservoir served water for Parachinar town before the construction of Malana dam, still the dam contributes much water to a large part of the town Parachinar. =Kot Ragha Dam Malikhel= This is a small size reservoir, largest in the kurram, and was built in Kot Ragha(Malikhel). It contains about 70,000 fish and has capacity to provide water about 2500 km¬≤ area. =Maidani Small Dam= This is a small Dam which is located in Munda near BILYAMIN(ÿ®ŸÑŸäÿßŸÖŸäŸÜ) Lower Kurram Agency. Its length is 1062 feet, and height is 86 feet. The benefits of this Dam: * storage of flood water in the reservoir of the dam. * Irrigation of Agriculture lands under its command. * Mitigation of flood hazards and gully erosion at the downstream of the dam. * Recharge to ground water aquifer. * Facilities for fish breeding and wildlife growth. * A forestation on the adjacent hills. * Creation of recreational resort for the community. * Employment opportunities for the local Communities of the area.  Climate  Climate of the valley remains pleasant most of the summer however in winters minimum temperature is usually below freezing point, occasionally mercury drop below -10 degree Celsius. Parachinar is ranked the fourth-coldest location in Pakistan by the weather charts website \\"Climate-Charts\\" that uses data available from the World Meteorological Organization. Northern and western heights of the valley receive snow falls in winters. Much of the precipitations occur during spring and summer season. Autumn and winter are usually dry. Due to its climatic condition Kurram Agency is famous for certain agricultural products throughout Pakistan such as peanut, bean, tomatoes and course rice(Kurmawalay wrazey). Wild olive trees are abundantly found along other trees and plants. Maple (Chinar) is the identity of Kurram Agency especially Parachinar. Mentioned in Rigveda In the Rigveda, the Kurrum is mentioned as Krumu. Taliban Activity Kurram was a stronghold of the TTP till 2008 when the Pakistani Army ordered a military operation in the Agency to flush out the militants.The military offensive, named Operation Koh- e-Safaid, ended in 2011 with the Lower and Upper Subdivisions of the agency falling back into the Pakistani control. In August, 2012, the Upper and Lower Subdivisions were de-notified as Conflict zones while as a military operation continued in Masozai Area of Central Kurram Agency. The Kurram faction of Haqqani Network is commanded by the notorious Fazal Saeed Haqqani who is famous for his bloody ambushes against shia community of Kurram Agency. He has thousands of armed supporters from local Tribes of Bangash,, Watizai, Daudzai. Extremist groups In recent years, Kurram Agency has become increasingly victimized by sectarian violence as tensions grew between the Shiites and Sunnis of the agency.

As of 2018, there were under wine-grape cultivation and 148 commercial wineries in Michigan, producing of wine. According to another count there were 112 operating wineries in Michigan in 2007.\\"Midwestern wine: Move over, California\\", The Economist, August 23, 2008 , accessed September 7, 2008 Wine and enotourism were estimated in 2007 to be a $300 million industry. Most of the quality bottled wine of Michigan is produced in the five American Viticultural Areas (AVAs) of Fennville AVA, Lake Michigan Shore AVA, Leelanau Peninsula AVA, Old Mission Peninsula AVA, and the Tip of the Mitt AVA. There are also a few disjunct wineries in every region of the state, including some in the Upper Peninsula that have opened over the past several years.http://www.michiganbythebottle.com/wineries.html# In addition to grape wine, Michigan is a leader in the production of fruit wines such as cherry wine. History The traditional wines of Michigan were sweet wines, often made from grape varieties native to North America, such as the Catawba, Concord, and Niagara, or from hybrid grapes partly developed by crossing native species with vinifera grapes. North American native grapes have the advantage of being adapted to local growing conditions, with consequent high fruit yield. In addition, growers can switch back and forth between the production of sweet wine and grape juice. Of Michigan's under grape cultivation, only 12%, , were devoted to wine grapes as of 2007. Michigan's wine industry dates from after the repeal of Prohibition. With large plantings of Concord in the southwest, mostly for the Welch Grape Juice Company, the state was well positioned to enter wine production. Four large wineries (out of eleven wineries established by 1946) came to produce almost all Michigan wine: La Salle Wine and Champagne Company which was established in Windsor, Ontario, and moved to Farmington, Michigan; the Bronte Champagne and Wines Company of Hartford; Michigan Wineries (now Tabor Hill Winery) of Buchanan; and St. Julian Winery, which was also established in Windsor, Ontario, on the Canadian shore across from Detroit during Prohibition and moved to Paw Paw, Michigan, after repeal. Vineyard on the Leelanau Peninsula To promote the local industry, Michigan law in the mid-20th century placed a tax of four cents per U.S. gallon on Michigan wine while other wine was taxed at 50 cents per U.S. gallon. Michigan wine of that era was, primarily, fermented to dryness, giving about 9% alcohol, and then fortified with California brandy to 16% alcohol. State laws considered this natural wine and allowed it to be sold in grocery and drug stores while fortified wines from out of state, produced to 18-20% alcohol, could only be sold from state liquor stores. The wineries of Michigan specialized in sweet wine and fruit wine well into the 1970s. With the growth in demand, starting in the latter half of the 20th century, for locally grown and locally labeled U.S. fine wines, several existing Michigan makers of sweet wine experimented with upgrading their production, and new vintners entered the scene. Tabor Hill Winery, in southwest Michigan, opened in 1971 as the first Michigan winery specializing in vinifera wines. Only a few years later in 1974, Chateau Grand Traverse opened in the Traverse Bay region of Northern Michigan. A slow growth in the number of wineries and continued trials of different vinifera varieties continued well into the 2000s. Presently, various hybrid varieties are being looked at which could allow grape growing in the Upper Peninsula to expand significantly over the next several years.http://michiganradio.org/post/michigan-winemakers- experiment-get-most-out-their-grapes Regions The four senior AVAs of Michigan. Michigan contains five American Viticultural Areas (AVAs), regions whose wines share similar and distinct characteristics: Fennville, Lake Michigan Shore, Leelanau Peninsula, Old Mission Peninsula, and Tip of the Mitt. All five regions are located in proximity to Lake Michigan, and almost all of Michigan's wine grapes are grown within 25 miles (40 km) of the lake. The lake effect provides a favorable microclimate compared to interior regions of the state. The northern wine regions have a 145-day growing season while the southern ones have a 160-day season. The Greater Traverse City area, which includes the peninsulas of Leelanau and Old Mission, is one of the primary wine regions of Michigan. The soil is sandy, with good drainage, and a lake- dominated climate allows a longer growing season than in most of the U.S. Midwest. Fifty-one percent of Michigan's wine grapes, including much of the state's vinifera grapes, are grown in this area. The same advantages exist, to a slightly lesser degree, on the eastern shore of Lake Michigan south of Grand Rapids in the Fennville and Lake Michigan Shore regions. Forty-five percent of Michigan's wine grapes are grown in this area. Grape varieties Most of the grapes grown in Michigan are grown for \\"table\\" uses (like jelly and grape juice), not wine. Of 100,000 short tons of grapes produced in 2005, only 4,600 tons were used for wine-making. However, the proportion of vinifera grapes used in wine‚Äìmaking is increasing. In 2005, the wine industry pressed 2,640 tons of European vinifera grapes, 1,660 tons of hybrid varieties, and 300 tons of American varieties. European grapes grown include Cabernet Franc, Chardonnay, Gew√ºrztraminer, Pinot noir, Merlot, Syrah, Pinot gris, and Riesling.Fruit Production 2005, U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Agricultural Statistics Service, Michigan Field Office, January 25, 2006, , accessed July 20, 2006 Specialty wines =Ice wine= The climate of Greater Traverse City allows for the production of ice wine, which requires an early hard freeze so the fruit still on the vine can be harvested while frozen. A small number of wineries produce this style, although it is not possible every year. In 2002, for example, six Michigan wineries produced over 13,000 half-bottles of ice wine, a record at that time.Record number of Michigan wineries make ice wine in 2002 vintage, (January 2, 2003), Sandra Silfven, Detroit News, accessed July 18, 2006. Ice wine was first produced in Michigan in 1983 by Mark Johnson, who at the time was working at Chateau Grand Traverse and is currently the head winemaker at Chateau Chantal. Northern Michigan wineries follow some of the German practices that govern what wine qualifies as ice wine. German law dictates that ice wine must be picked only when the grapes are frozen on the vine, while United States law allows for wine to be sold as ice wine if the grapes are picked and then artificially frozen. Because of the impossibility of predicting nature, making ice wine requires a great deal of luck. The grapes are generally picked in December after prolonged below-freezing temperatures, to ensure they are frozen all the way through. But in warmer years the grapes cannot be picked until late into January. It can also be difficult to protect the grapes from birds and wind as they stay on the vine until after they are very ripe.http://www.winesandvines.com/template.cfm?section=features&content;=49688&ftitle;=Michigan%20Ice%20Wine%20Rises%20When%20Mercury%20Falls =Fruit wine= Cranberry wine and vineyard in the Lake Michigan Shore AVA Michigan is one of the foremost U.S. states in the production of diverse varieties of bottled, fermented fruit wine. Fruit wine has a long history in Europe, especially in regions such as Poland and the Baltic states where grapes do not easily grow. In Michigan, apple wine and cherry wine are produced in the highest volume, but other fruit juices are fermented as well. Michigan is the leading state for tart cherry production (many Traverse City vineyards were formerly cherry orchards); a number of Michigan wineries produce cherry wine, spice cherry wine, and cherry-grape blends. Michigan is a North American leader in the production of fortified fruit wines and eau-de- vie (fruit brandy). Ongoing issues =Tourism synergy= As with other states, the Michigan wine industry is seen as an attractive example of regional cuisine and is supported by tourists. More than 800,000 tourists visited Michigan wineries in 2005. =State support= The wine industry in Michigan is supported by an agricultural research program at Michigan State University, which began experimental vineyards around the state in 1970 and established a winery on campus in 1972. The Michigan Grape and Wine Industry Council is a state agency established in 1985 to promote and support Michigan wineries. The state government has declared May to be \\"Michigan Wine Month.\\"http://www.freep.com/story/life/food/2016/12/26/michigan-wine-month- moving/95847882/ =Future prospects= A warming trend in the climate of the Great Lakes region could increase Michigan vinifera productivity and lead to a higher profile for Michigan wines. However, Michigan vineyards, particularly vinifera vineyards, remain vulnerable to late spring and early fall cold snaps, such as the killing frost of March, 2003, insufficient growing season heat to fully ripen the grapes, and rot or mildew originating from rainfall while the grapes are maturing. The Michigan Grape and Wine Industry Council has set a goal of of wine grape production and 3,000,000 cases of Michigan- produced wines annually by 2024, about 10 times current production.Michigan Grape and Wine Industry Council Research and Education Advisory Committee: Funding Priorities, 22 May 2006, David P. Miller, accessed July 18, 2006. Consumption of Michigan wine has risen from 1.5% of all wine consumed in Michigan in 1997 to 5.2% in 2006, with the number of wineries rising from about 16 to 50 in the same period.\\"Michigan Grapevine: Business aims to convert Michigan wine skeptics into buyers\\", Traverse City Business News, Cari Noga, July 2007, Vol. 13 Number 12, accessed August 24, 2007 Michigan liquor law revisions in 2005 affirmed the right of wineries to sell from their tasting rooms, ship wine directly to consumers, and sell directly to licensed retailers and restaurants, bypassing wholesale distributors.Michigan Public Act 268 of 2005 and Michigan Public Act 269 of 2005, accessed Aug. 8, 2008. Industry and events A northwest Michigan vineyard in fall As of 2018, there are 148 wineries operating in Michigan. A large number of these wineries operate within the five recognized viticultural areas of Michigan. =Blossom Days= The Original Traverse City Cherry Festival began in 1925 as the Blessing of the Blossoms Festival. This festival was originally an event held in early May to attract tourists to Northern Michigan to view the cherry blossoms. In 1931 the Michigan Legislature renamed the festival the National Cherry Festival, and moved the event to the summer. The Wineries of Old Mission Peninsula revived this tradition in 2004 by hosting the Blossom Days Festival. The festival is a two-day event with a non-denominational ceremony taking place to bless the cherry and grape blossoms for the coming growing season. The 2011 Blossom Days event took place on May 14 and 15, and the Blessing of the Blossoms was performed by Bishop Bernard Hedba at Chateau Chantal. =Great Lakes Wine Festival= Starting in 2010, Michigan International Speedway has hosted the annual Great Lakes Wine Festival. In 2011, 25 Michigan wineries and 17 breweries attended this event. The 2011 Great Lakes Wine Festival was a three-day event from Friday, May 20, through Sunday, May 22. The festival offers the opportunity to taste Michigan wine from all over the state while wineries demonstrate food pairings. MIS has camping available for festival goers to spend the entire weekend. =Paw Paw Wine and Harvest Festival= The Paw Paw Wine and Harvest Festival is a three- day event held on the second weekend of September in Paw Paw, Michigan.

Bloomer notably had three separate spells with his home town club Grimsby Town, having also played for Hull City, Lincoln City, Telford United, Cambridge United, Boston United and Harrogate Town. Career =Grimsby Town= Bloomer started his career as a trainee with his home town club of Grimsby Town, but failed to make an impact, starting only three games in his four years under contract. He was brought up in a youth team that consisted the likes of Jack Lester, John Oster, Danny Butterfield and Daryl Clare, and under the stewardship of long serving manager Alan Buckley. Bloomer was released by the club's new manager Lennie Lawrence at the end of the 2000‚Äì01 campaign. =Hull City= Upon his release from Blundell Park, Bloomer dropped down two league's to sign for Hull City, where he also struggled, making just three appearances in the league in two years, all of them off the bench. In 2002, Alan Buckley's Lincoln City, who were facing relegation from Division Three signed Bloomer on a month-long loan. He turned in a series of impressive displays at centre back which helped keep Lincoln in the Football League. =Lincoln City= The following season, Keith Alexander succeeded Alan Buckley as manager, and brought Bloomer in on a permanent deal. After signing permanently for Lincoln he was mainly a bit-part player, but nonetheless made nearly a century of appearances for the club. During the 2004‚Äì2005 season, he earned himself a starting place at right-back, replacing veteran Dean West. Bloomer was given his chance to start ahead of West for the League Cup first round match against Derby County. Lincoln won 3‚Äì1, Bloomer's performance was highly praised, and he went on to make a number of solid performances. He lost his starting place following an ill-fated first half against Wycombe Wanderers in early 2005. Bloomer moved from right back to central defensive position held by captain Paul Morgan, who was out with an injury, Wycombe scored three goals in the first 45 minutes, all from Nathan Tyson. He did not start again all season, with both Lee Beevers and Gareth McAuley playing in his position for the rest of the year, however, he did play as a striker in the play-off final in Cardiff, where Lincoln lost 2‚Äì0 after extra-time to Southend United. During the 2005‚Äì06 season, Bloomer found himself on the fringes of the Lincoln squad, and had spells on loan at former club Grimsby Town and Conference side Cambridge United. =Cambridge United= Bloomer signed for Cambridge permanently in July 2006, and made 18 first team appearances. However, he only had a short lived spell at the struggling Conference club, and he had his contract cancelled on 31 January 2007. =Return to Grimsby Town= Following his release from Cambridge, Alan Buckley tempted Bloomer into returning to his home town and he rejoined Grimsby Town until the end of the 2006‚Äì07 season. After playing only a cameo role in the end of the club's season, Buckley released Bloomer four months later. =Boston United= He went on trial with York City at the end of the 2006‚Äì07 season following his release by Grimsby, but York confirmed they would not be offering Bloomer a contract after did not turn up to training, and had also gone to play for Halifax Town for a pre- season friendly. However, he eventually signed for Conference North side Boston United. Despite Boston's financial trouble, Bloomer stayed on even though the club were demoted two years in a row for financial irregularities. Despite being offered a new but reduced contract for the 2009‚Äì10 season, Bloomer was eventually released by Boston on 1 June 2009. =Harrogate Town= Less than two weeks after his release from Boston United, Bloomer agreed to join Harrogate Town, who were managed by his former Lincoln City teammate Simon Weaver. Despite finishing bottom of the Conference North with Harrogate Town, Bloomer managed to make a total of 44 appearances. He left Harrogate in January 2016 midway through his fifth season with the club. =Cleethorpes Town= In January 2016 Bloomer joined Cleethorpes Town on a free transfer. Personal life Bloomer is a third generation professional footballer. His father, Brian played in the Football League for Scunthorpe United while Brian's father, Jimmy played for Grimsby Town as well as Matt's old club Boston United. Matt's uncle, Jimmy Bloomer Jr also played for Grimsby Town.

Operational history At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Shiratsuyu was assigned to Destroyer Division 27 of Destroyer Squadron 1 of the IJN 1st Fleet, and remained in Japanese home waters as part of the protection of the Japanese battleship forces. From mid-January 1942, she was assisted to escorting convoys between Japan and Taiwan, and in mid-February escorted the aircraft carrier to Davao and back to Hashirajima. In April, the destroyer escorted the aircraft carriers and from Mako to Truk, from which it joined Admiral Takeo Takagi‚Äôs Strike Force at the Battle of the Coral Sea on 7‚Äì8 May. At the end of May, the ship escorted the cruisers and back to Kure, from which it was assigned to Admiral Shir≈ç Takasu‚Äôs, Aleutians Guard Force during the Battle of Midway on 4‚Äì6 June. On 14 July she was assigned back to the IJN 2nd Fleet and returned to Truk in mid-August, from which she was deployed as a high speed transport to carry troops to reoccupy Makin Atoll after the Makin Raid. Until mid-September, Shiratsuyu remained based out of Jaluit in the Marshall Islands, but from October was deployed to the Solomon Islands, where she made several \\"Tokyo Express\\" high speed transport runs to Guadalcanal. On an attack mission to Guadalcanal on 25 October, she assisted in sinking the American tugboat and damaging the high-speed minesweeper . She participated in the First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal on the night of 12‚Äì13 November 1942, rescuing survivors from the torpedoed battleship , but was not involved in combat. On 23 November, while on a transport run to Lae, she rescued survivors from the destroyer , which she then scuttled with a torpedo. However, on her next mission to Buna on 28 November, Shiratsuyu took a direct hit from a bomb during an attack by USAAF B-17 Flying Fortress bombers in her bow, which required emergency repairs at Rabaul, Truk, and Saipan before she should reach Sasebo on 25 February 1943 for complete repairs. She returned to active duty on 20 July 1943 with the IJN 2nd Fleet, escorting the aircraft carrier from Yokosuka to Truk and back in late August. She returned to Rabaul in mid- October, after which she was assigned to troop transport runs to Qavuvu. During the Battle of Empress Augusta Bay on 2 November, she collided with the destroyer , after which she was strafed by American aircraft, leaving four dead and two wounded, and necessitating a return to Sasebo in November. During this refit, one gun turret was removed and replaced by two triple 25-mm anti- aircraft guns. She returned to Truk at the end of December as part of the escort for the cruisers My≈çk≈ç, Haguro and , continuing on to Kavieng in early January. On 31 January, she rescued survivors of torpedoed Yasukuni Maru at Truk. From February through April, she was part of the escort for the battleship . From the end of April, she was reassigned to Take Ichi convoy duty, escorting troop convoys from China to the Philippines and other points in southeast Asia. Shiratsuyu was attacked on 8 June off of Biak by US Navy aircraft, with four killed and five crewmen injured. On the night of 14 June, she collided with the Japanese tanker Seiyo Maru southeast of Surigao Strait (), after which her depth charges exploded among survivors.

An exhibit at the National Museum in New Delhi, India. * In Vedic tradition, Yama was considered to be the first mortal who died and espied the way to the celestial abodes; thus, as a result, he became the ruler of the departed. His role, characteristics, and abode have been expanded in texts such as the Upanishads and Puranas. * His name means 'twin' (Yama has a twin sister, Yami), 'moral rule or duty' (i.e. dharma), 'self-control', 'forbearance', and 'cessation'. * One of the LokapƒÅla - Guardians of the Directions - representing the south cardinal direction. *Depicted as riding a water-buffalo and holding a danda (meaning 'stick', also referring to Vedic punishment) as a weapon. *Skin colour is often depicted as blue, but also sometimes as red. *Often related to KƒÅla (\\"time\\") since all must die in due course (Krishna and Shiva are considered to be the personifications of time). *Analogous to Hades (also known as Pluto, another meaning of 'Yama'), the Greek god of the underworld.  Mantra  Yama's original Sanskrit mantra in the Devanagari, in the English transliteration, and in an English translation:  Literature  =Vedas (Rig Veda)= In the Rig Veda, Yama is the son of Vivasvan (the sun god, son of Kashyapa) and of Saranya (the dusk goddess, daughter of Tvastar) and has a twin sister named Yami. He helped humankind find a place to dwell, and gave every individual the power to tread any path in life which he or she so chooses.The Rig Veda/Mandala 10/Hymn 14 Ralph Griffith (Translator), see also hymns 10.135-10.136 Yama is mentioned roughly fifty times in the Rig Veda, almost exclusively in the first and (far more frequently) in the tenth book. Four hymns (10.10, 10.14, 10.135, and 10.154) are directly addressed to or about Yama. From the Jamison/Brereton translation: Hymn 10.10 consists of prayer by Yama's sister, Yami, to him. Agni, the god of fire, has close relations with Yama. In hymn 10.21, Agni is said to be the envoy of Vivasvat (Yama's father) and a well-loved friend (kƒÅmya) of Yama himself: Hymn 10.52, asks who Yama's priest is: Hymn 1.164 states Agni, Yama, and MƒÅtari≈õvan are the names of One being, along with other forms of the divine: = Upanishads = In the Katha Upanishad, Yama is portrayed as a teacher to the Brahmin boy Nachiketa. Having granted three boons to Nachiketa, their conversation evolves to a discussion of the nature of being, knowledge, the Atman (i.e. the soul, self) and moksha (liberation).Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 269-273 From the translation by Brahmrishi Vishvatma Bawra: = Mahabharata = alt= In the epic Mahabharata, Yama is the father of Yudhishthira (also known as Dharmaraja), the oldest brother of the five Pandavas. Yama most notably appears in person in the Yaksha Prashna and the Vana Parva, and is mentioned in the Bhagavad Gita.  Yaksha Prashna  In the Yaksha Prashna, Yama appears as a yaksha (nature spirit) in the form of a Crane to question Yudhishthira and test his righteousness. Impressed by Yudhishthira's strict adherence to dharma and his answers to the riddles posed, Yama revealed himself as his father, blessed him, and brought his younger Pandava brothers back to life. From the Yaksha Prashna article linked:  Vana Parva  In the Vana Parva, when Yudhishthira asks the sage Markandeya whether there has ever been a woman whose devotion matched Draupadi‚Äôs, the sage replied by relating the story of Savitri and Satyavan. After Savitri's husband Satyavan died, Yama arrived to carry away his soul. However, Yama was so impressed with Savitri's purity and dedication to dharma and to her husband, he was convinced to instead bring Satyavan back to life. = Tirtha-Yatra Parva = Varaha lifts the earth. In the Tirtha-yatra Parva (Book 3, Varna Parva, CXLII), Lomasa tells Yudhishthira 'in days of yore, there was (once) a terrible time in the Satya Yuga when the eternal and primeval Deity [Krishna] assumed the duties of Yama. And, O thou that never fallest off, when the God of gods began to perform the functions of Yama, there died not a creature while the births were as usual.' This led to an increase in the population and the Earth sinking down 'for a hundred yojanas. And suffering pain in all her limbs.' The earth sought the protection of Narayana, who incarnated as a boar (Varaha) and lifted her back up.  Udyoga Parva  In the Udyoga Parva, it is stated that the wife of Yama is called Urmila.  Bhagavad Gita  In the Bhagavad Gita, part of the Mahabharata, Krishna states: = Puranas = Yama and his abode are frequently mentioned in the Puranas.  Bhagavata Puruna / Srimad Bhagavatam  = Third and Fourth Canto = leftIn the third and fourth cantos of the Srimad Bhagavatam, Yama was incarnated as a shudra called Vidura due to being cursed by a sage for being too harsh in his punishments. From the A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada / Bhaktivedanta Book Trust (BBT) translation: Vidura, a devotee of Krishna, is the main protagonist in the third canto. In this canto, after being thrown out of his home by King Dhritarashtra (his older half- brother) for admonishing the Kaurava's ignoble behaviour towards the Pandavas, Vidura went on a pilgrimage where he met other devotees of Krishna such as Uddhava and the sage Maitreya, the latter of whom revealed Vidura's true origin to him: Krishna also states Yama punishes sinners, as relayed to Vidura (again, an incarnation of Yama) by Maitreya during their conversation about the origin and creation of the multiverse: A detailed account of the punishment of a sinner upon their death is also provided, beginning with their seizure and journey to Yamaloka (i.e. Hell): = Sixth Canto = In the sixth canto, Yama (not as Vidura nor with Aryama in the post; see third and fourth canto) instructs his messengers, the Yamadutas, when questioned about who has supreme authority in the universe since there are so many gods and demigods: = Tenth Canto = In the tenth canto, Krishna and Balarama travel to Yama's abode to bring back the dead son of their Guru, Sandipani Muni:  Brahma Purana  In the Brahma Purana, Yama is the lord of justice and is associated with Dharma. Mentions include: * Chapter 2.29-30: Yama has a daughter called Sunitha and a grandson called Vena, who turned his back on dharma * Chapter 20: The various hells of Yama are described along with their concomitant sins * Chapter 30.64-68: Yama chastises his mother for cursing him (to his father) *Chapter 35.11: Yama is destroyed by Shiva after coming to claim the soul of Markandeya (and at the behest of the Gods is revived afterwards) *Chapter 48.4: Krishna describes himself as Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Indra, and Yama ('I am Yama who restrains the universe.') *Chapter 105: Descriptions of the 'terrible servants of Yama' are given *Chapter 126.42.50: Descriptions of the agony of death for sinners including being caught by Yama with His noose, and the tortures suffered in His abode *Chapter 24 (book 4): Yama is killed in battle by Karttikeya; on Shiva's orders, Yama is revived by Nandin  Garuda Purana  In the Garuda Purana, Yama and his realm where sinners are punished are detailed extensively, including in the twelfth chapter called 'The Realm of Yama'.  Matsya Purana  In the Matsya Purana, In addition to his battles against the asuras, Yama is mentioned extensively: * Chapter XI: Yama as boy is cursed * Chapter XLIX: Yama fights Janamejaya in Hell and after being captured, gives him knowledge of emanicipation * Chapter XCIII: Yama is declared to be of Saturn * Chapter CII: Synonyms of Yama are given (Dharmaraja, Mrityo, Antaka, Vaivaswata, Kala, Sarvabhutaksaya, Audumbara, Dadhna, Nila, Paramesthi, Vrikodara, Chitra, and Chitragupta) * Chapter CCXLVIII: Yama - like others - is controlled by Vishnu * Chapter CCLIII: Yama is 13th of the 32 Devas  Vishnu Purana  In the Vishnu Purana, Yama is the son of sun-god Surya (Vivasvan named in the Vedas also means 'sun') and Sandhya (Saranya named in the Vedas is another name), the daughter of Vishvakarma (Tvastar named in the Vedas emerged from the navel of Vishvakarma). Iconography Sculpture of the dikpala Yama. In art, some Sanskrit sources say that he should be of dark color, resembling the rain-cloud, with two arms, fire-colored eyes and sharp side-tusks. He is depicted with red or black clothes, and seated either on a throne or a he-buffalo. A different iconographic form described in the Vi·π£·πáudharmottara depicts him with four arms and wearing golden yellow garments. He holds a noose (pƒÅ≈õa) of rope in one hand. He is also depicted holding a danda which is a Sanskrit word for \\"stick\\".  Worship  Although Yama is worshiped as part of daily prayer rituals as one of the Guardians of the Directions, there are few temples dedicated to the worship of Yama. All known temples and shrines are located in India.  In Popular Culture  In addition to his depiction in movie and television adaptations of scriptures such as in the television series, Yama has also been depicted in road safety campaigns in India, particularly to warn against the dangers of riding motorcycles without helmets. Dharma Raja has been depicted as a character in \\"The Star-Touched Queen\\" and \\"A Crown of Wishes\\" by Roshani Chokshi.

History and Description It was a lengthened version of the earlier centerfire .41 Short Colt, which was made to duplicate the dimensions of the even earlier .41 Short rimfire. The front of the bullet was about 0.406‚Äì0.408‚Ä≥ OD, the same as the case. The barrel was about 0.404‚Äì0.406‚Ä≥ groove diameter. The bullet lubrication was outside the case. At 0.386‚Äì0.388‚Ä≥ OD, The base of the bullet was smaller in diameter to fit inside the case. This is known as a \\"heel-base\\" or heeled bullet. The only modern heeled bullet is the .22 rimfire. In the mid-1890s, Colt redesigned the cartridge. They reduced the entire diameter of the bullet to 0.386\\" OD and lengthened the brass case in order to put both the bullet and its lubrication inside the case. The overall length of both loaded cartridges was about the same. The barrel of the revolver was reduced slightly to match the more popular .38-40 at 0.400‚Äì0.401‚Ä≥ groove diameter (this was probably done for manufacturing reasons, not accuracy reasons). This meant that the outside diameter (OD) of the new bullet was smaller than the barrel's bore, let alone its groove diameter. A hollow-base bullet can be dropped down the bore by gravity alone. The newer soft lead bullet was made with a large hollow base, like Civil War Mini√© balls. The intent was for the base of the bullet to expand with the pressure of the burning gunpowder to grip the rifling. The original 41LC brass cases came in three primary lengths, although they vary quite a bit within a headstamp. The first ones were the shortest at about 0.932‚Ä≥ to 0.937‚Äù long. In balloon-head cases, they held about 20 gr of compressed black powder (BP) with a 200 gr flat-bottom, heel-base, blunt-nose bullet. The next cases were about 1.130‚Äù to 1.138‚Äù long with a 200 gr hollow-base, blunt-nose bullet and about 21 gr of BP (also in balloon-head cases). Although the brass case lengths were far different, both cartridges were about the same overall length when loaded. The last brass case length was 1.050‚Äù to 1.100‚Äù long and was created exclusively for hand loaders so that both heel-base and hollow-base bullets could be used interchangeably (note that cartridges made from the longest brass cases and heel-base bullets are too long to fit most .41 LC revolvers). The accuracy the .41LC is adequate for what it was intended; close range self- defense, its drawback had more to do with the heavy double-action trigger pull of the Thunderer. Elmer Keith wrote in his book \\"Sixguns\\" that the \\"41LC was a better fight-stopper than its paper ballistics would indicate\\" and it was \\"better for self-defense than any .38 Special load made\\". Keith would go onto design the .41 Magnum, possibly influenced by the advantages of the .41 Long Colt. However, .41 Long Colt cannot be fired out of a .41 Magnum. The .41 Long Colt worked surprisingly well considering the mismatch of bullet and bore sizes, but by the beginning of World War I it was in serious decline and it fell from use by the beginning of World War II. The .41 long Colt was a moderately popular chambering in several Colt models. It was available in the Model 1877 Thunderer double action revolver, the series of New Army and New Navy revolvers of 1889, 1892 94,95,96, 1901 & 1903, the Single Action Army, the Bisley Model, the Army Special-Official Police.Colt's Manufacturing Company Today, the .41 Long Colt is a mere relic of the past and is considered obsolete. It is currently only produced sporadically for high prices by a handful of small manufacturers such as Ultramax, as the Thunderer is considered by collectors too valuable to shoot.

Early life Ghesqui√®re was born in Comines, Nord, the younger of two sons of a Francophone Belgian golf-course owner and manager in the 7,500-inhabitant Poitevine town of Loudun and a French mother, who enjoyed fashion.Alice Gregory (18 October 2019) Nicolas Ghesqui√®re T: The New York Times Style Magazine. He grew up in Loudun, Vienne. From a young age, Ghesqui√®re enjoyed and practiced sports, such as horse riding, fencing, and swimming, and, in fact, many of his collections today use that inspiration, most notably his scuba mini dresses and his equestrian-inspired fall/winter 2006 ready-to-wear collection. Reared in the small town of Loudun in western France's Poitevin-speaking area, at a young age Ghesqui√®re announced at that he wanted to be a designer. He now admits this was partly from an adolescent desire to do something different from his parents and to alleviate country boredom. By the age of 12, Nicolas was sketching dress designs in his school books, making dresses out of his mother's curtains, and designing earrings out of his grandmother's chandelier crystals. With the help of his father, Ghesqui√®re put together a portfolio of drawings and sent it, along with a letter introducing himself, to several designers.Ingrid Sischy (27 March 2014), The Thriller at Vuitton Vanity Fair. He diligently did internships during his school holidays. At 14, he assumed an internship with French designer agn√®s b, for which he was paid in clothes. His next apprenticeship was with Corinne Cobson. He decided afterward that fashion was difficult and returned home to finish his schooling. Career After graduating from high school at age 18, Ghesqui√®re turned down a place at art school to work as an assistant to designer Jean-Paul Gaultier from 1990 to 1992.Jo Ellison (19 September 2015), Nicolas Ghesqui√®re Financial Times.

Ghesqui√®re eventually landed a job doing the licensing for Paris fashion house Balenciaga and designing for the Asian market. At that time, Balenciaga had limited success since the 1970s and was owned by Groupe Jacques Bogart, whose management realized Ghesqui√®re's talent when he designed a small collection for one of its Japanese licensees. (The label's founder, Crist√≥bal Balenciaga, died in 1972.) Ghesqui√®re held, as he then described it, \\"what many would call the worst position in fashion,\\" designing suits and funeral clothes under a Balenciaga licence for Japan. In 1997, at the young age of 25, Ghesqui√®re was the surprise choice to head Balenciaga, promoted to creative director of Balenciaga after his Dutch predecessor Josephus Thimister was fired following a highly unsuccessful show. In this capacity, he was put in charge of the brand's entire image, from clothing and accessories to store design and advertising.Nadya Masidlover and Christina Passariello (4 November 2013), Louis Vuitton Appoints Ghesqui√®re as Creative Director Wall Street Journal.

At Balenciaga, Ghesqui√®re soon became known for his sense of contrast, such as pairing high-waisted skinny pants with a voluminous blouson or a tightly cut wool jumpsuit with billowing sleeves.

His biggest commercial success was the Lariat bag,Christina Passariello (5 November 2014), Nicolas Ghesqui√®re Innovates at the Legendary House of Louis Vuitton Wall Street Journal. with braided handles and dangling zipper pulls. An aspect of the designer's devotion to the house's legacy was his respect for Crist√≥bal Balenciaga's original design concepts. However, even though the Balenciaga archives are stored in Ghesqui√®re's atelier, he was only able to gain entry to the locked room by special appointment with an off-site custodian.

Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh has hosted the program since its inception in 1982. Most recently, it has been directed by Physics Professor Dr. Barry Luokkala. Participants are required to be Pennsylvania high school students between their junior and senior years and are required to live in the dormitories for the full five weeks of the program. Admission is very competitive - approximately 500 of the most scientifically gifted students in the state compete for 56 to 60 slots in the program. The aim of PGSS is to promote interest in science rather than to advance students' knowledge in a specific area. The curriculum includes five \\"core\\" courses in Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, Mathematics and Physics, and numerous electives. In addition to taking classes, students are required to participate in a lab course and a research-style team project. The emphasis is on cooperation, rather than competition - students are encouraged to both collaborate with other students on academic work and to interact socially. The Residence Life staff provides a number of structured social events to foster friendship and teamwork. There is at least one event per day and is advertised on the social calendar in the dorm lobby. For many students, the social development gained from the program rivals the scientific knowledge they acquire. The students leave the program with a strong bond; most attend an organized reunion the following year after the 4th week of the program. PGSS was discontinued in 2009 by Governor Ed Rendell who cut all funding for PGSEs from the 2009-2010 budget. After the program closed, a group of PGSS alumni and parents worked on what was called the most important \\"team project\\": the restoration of PGSS. This included the following milestones: organizing PGSS Campaign, Inc. as a registered 501(c)3 nonprofit organization, locating over 95% of the 2400 alumni, and many of their parents, collecting over $900,000 in donations from these individuals, meeting with former Governor Thomas Corbett and several former Secretaries of Education as well as the current Secretary of Education Pedro Rivera, meeting with key legislative leaders in Pennsylvania, hiring a part-time Executive Director, gaining formal recognition as an Education Improvement Organization (EITC), and securing numerous corporate grants. After several years of work by PGSS Campaign, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania awarded Carnegie Mellon University a matching $150,000 grant to operate PGSS in 2013 and 2014. This provided half of the required funds for a 54-student program. To secure the funding from the state, the non-profit PGSS Campaign, Inc. had to agree to match those funds, and raised that and more to allow 60 students to attend each summer. PGSS was ultimately restored in 2013, and PGSS 2014 followed the next summer. Although Governor Corbett put a line item in the 2014 budget, the legislature took it out in the final version. TeamPA provided the matching $150,000 grant to Carnegie Mellon for PGSS 2015, and PGSS Campaign continued to raise funds for the match. PGSS Campaign hosted PGSS 2016 through 2020 with only in-kind support from the Commonwealth due to the generosity of PGSS alumni, family and friends as well as corporate support secured by PGSS Campaign. PGSS Campaign is still in discussion with the state about funding. PGSS Campaign hopes to increase the number of students even more, closer to the earlier 90-student program. PGSS Campaign, Inc. also functions as a PGSS alumni association. PGSS Campaign, Inc. has arranged successful reunions in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, Boston, San Francisco, DC, Austin, Houston, Seattle, New York and more and started a mentoring program connecting recent alumni with alumni from previous years. Applications are available for interested high-school juniors who reside in PA at Core Courses None of the teachers of the core courses are required to teach any one particular area or course. They are simply hired to teach a course in the general subject area. As a result, the core courses vary from year to year. However, it is typical for the Biology course to be in HIV/AIDS Biotechnology, the Chemistry course to be in Organic Chemistry, the Mathematics Course on Discrete Mathematics and the Physics course typically covers concepts in Modern Physics, often focusing on Special Relativity. The Computer Science Course covers basic programming concepts and offers independent study for those with experience.PGSE Page As it is not unusual for a student in the PGSS program to be unfamiliar with a topic, it is common for the students to help one another to stay abreast of the workload. The core courses typically run fifty minutes each four days a week, with four courses each day from Monday through Friday. Students may drop one core course after two weeks, provided that they are taking at least one elective and have completed outstanding homework assignments in that course. The core professors often return for multiple summers. Dr. Mark Farrell of Point Park University usually teaches the chemistry course and is the only faculty to have been with the program since the beginning of the program. Dr. Richard Holman of Carnegie Mellon has been teaching the physics core since the early 1990s. Dr. Ben Campbell was a student in the program in 1997 and has been a TA or faculty member every year but one since. Lab Courses A laboratory course is offered in every subject. Typically, one or more inter-disciplinary laboratory courses are added, such as Forensic Science. These usually meet twice a week for three hours. Depending on the subject area, it may be required that the laboratory course and the Team Project be in the same area. Electives This is perhaps the second most variant course topic in the PGSS program, with the most variant being the team projects. Electives typically run for an hour twice a week. Taking more than four electives in addition to all of the core courses is not permitted without special permission from the director. Usually, several electives, including Astrophysics, Laser Technology, the Science of Music, Material Science and several Mathematics electives are consistently offered every year, although content in these courses may change. Past Math Electives were taught by longtime PGSS faculty, Juan Schaffer, who was often revered by students for his mathematical genius and resemblance to Einstein until his passing in 2017. Team Projects All PGSS students are required to participate in a team project. The areas generally match the areas of the core courses. These team projects, each culminating in a final scientific research paper, are presented during the last week of the PGSS program known as \\"Team Project Week.\\" During Team Project Week, no classes are held, due to the immense demand on the participants' time from their research paper and presentations. The final papers are compiled for the PGSS Journal.PGSS Journal Homework Typically, PGSS students must complete and hand in an assignment once a week for every core course and must also hand in any homework for electives. This usually works out such that one core course assignment is due every weekday. The PGSS program strives to emulate the modern scientific community by encouraging collaboration and cooperation among students as they complete their assignments. The homework problems are often designed to require copious amounts of time and effort if one attempts to solve them without teaming up, thus encouraging a cooperative atmosphere. In addition to this, students participating in this program are not ranked among their peers, thus removing any reason for isolation solely to stand out. There are no grades given. Location From the inception of the program until 2000 the PGSS program used the Hamerschlag House (also referred to as the 'Schlag) as the coed residence for the students with the boys confined to one wing, and the girls to the other. In 2001 the program was moved to Morewood E tower floors 4-7 (each sex having 2 floors) with the lounge in Morewood Underground. The program briefly moved back to Hamerschlag before going to Mudge House starting in 2007, with girls living in the main house and boys confined to one wing. The 2013 and 2014 programs were housed in Donner House, with boys in the southern wing and girls in the northern wing. In 2017 and onwards, the program's housing has been moved to Scobell House where the boys lived on the bottom two floors and the girls on the two upper floors.

History In 1950s Germany, in the wake of musique concr√®te, the first fully electronic compositions were written. During this period many countries established electronic music studios to discover and explore these new worlds of sound. In Germany, new music was composed and experiments conducted on electronic equipment that often came originally from the physics lab or radio. However, development in the East and the West differed considerably. The political division of Germany after World War II led to the foundation of two politically independent states in 1949, geographically neighbours yet entirely separate: the German Democratic Republic (GDR) in the east and the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG) in the west. In the years that followed, each state defined its own cultural policy. One result was that young artists and musicians, who saw themselves as the avant-garde, were valued and tolerated differently in the two states. In the West, from the outset it was easier for musicians to remain independent and to experiment relatively unhampered. For example, at the famous WDR in K√∂ln, many new works were written by composers such as Herbert Eimert, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and Gottfried Michael K√∂nig. The publications that came out of the WDR studio had an international audience. In other studios, such as Milan, the Rome, Eindhoven, Brussels, Gravesano, and New York, experiments with musical structures and technical innovations were also ongoing.  Invention  This revolutionary development in music, together with the use of new electronic sources of sound, was followed with great interest in East Berlin. Like the rest of the country, the city of Berlin was divided politically into East and West. In the competitive struggle between the two systems, the GDR did not merely want to be part of international developments, it wanted to take the lead. Thus, around 1960, technical experts at the ‚ÄúLabor f√ºr Akustisch-Musikalische Grenzprobleme‚Äù (laboratory for problems at the acoustics/music interface) began with the construction of a sound-generating device, which would be a compact sound lab and centerpiece of an electronic music studio; furthermore, it would be unrivaled and unsurpassed. The East German composers would have an instrument at their disposal that was superior to all comparable inventions in the studios of the Western world. This wonder-machine utilized microelectronics, which was new at the time. The machine‚Äôs concept was based on the mixing of so-called subharmonic sounds. In this respect its model was the Trautonium, a German invention from the 1930s.  Mixtur-trautonium  In Alfred Hitchcock's film The Birds, the rather menacing sounds of these usually harmless creatures were produced synthetically on an electronic instrument, a Mixturtrautonium ‚Äî a further development of the Trautonium. The Mixtur-trautonium is a special case in the history of electronic music instruments, since it uses the afore mentioned subharmonic mixtures to generate sound. The sounds produced by conventional instruments and in the natural world are a combination of a fundamental with a series of harmonic overtones above it. Subharmonic sounds are produced by dividing the fundamental frequency, resulting in subharmonics, or \\"undertones\\". Subharmonics only exist naturally in bells and steel plates and differ from the sounds produced conventionally by synthesizers and software programmes for electronic music. It appeared that the world of sound produced by mixing subharmonics would be forever dominated by the only existing instrument, the Mixturtrautonium, and its constructor and player, Oskar Sala. Nobody else had ever mastered or played Sala‚Äôs instrument, and when he died, it seemed that the sound world of subharmonics was lost.  Rediscovery in 2000  In the course of extensive research on the history of electronic music instruments, in 2000 Manfred Miersch, a Berlin artist and musician, made a remarkable discovery: the Trautonium is not the only instrument of its kind; another exists that produces subharmonic sounds ‚Äî the \\"Subharchord\\". As described above, this instrument was invented in the GDR under difficult technical conditions, but using the latest technology available. However, the Subharchord differs from the Mixturtrautonium in key respects. The Subharchord has a keyboard and is played like an organ, whereas the Mixturtrautonium‚Äôs manual is a resistor wire over a metal plate, which is pressed at various points to create sound (like a ribbon-controller), a rather difficult procedure. In addition, the Subharchord possesses considerably more possibilities than the Mixturtrautonium for generating and manipulating sounds. Miersch succeeded in tracking down and unearthing long-forgotten instruments, thus saving the Subharchord from oblivion. With his publication of a four-part series in the German magazine Keyboards in 2003 and construction of a website (www.subharchord.com) in 2002/2003, Miersch introduced the Subharchord to a wider audience. As a result of Miersch‚Äôs activities, one of the surviving instruments has now been restored. Like its West German counterpart, the Trautonium, the East German Subharchord was a favourite choice for film soundtracks. , former conductor of the Symphony Orchestra of the DEFA film studio, worked with the subharchord in Dresden on the soundtracks of science fiction classics, such as Signale. The subharchord was also used for many of the DEFA‚Äôs cartoons.

Consisting of fifty questions, it aims to investigate whether adults of average intelligence have symptoms of autism spectrum conditions. More recently, versions of the AQ for children and adolescents have also been published. The test was popularised by Wired in when published alongside their article, \\"The Geek Syndrome\\".The Geek Syndrome It is commonly used for self diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders, although it is not intended to be a diagnostic test.Take the AQ Test , Embarrassing Bodies website, Channel 4, 2011. Accessed 2011-09-16. The PhenX Toolkit uses age-specific versions of AQ as its adult and adolescent screening protocols for Symptoms of Autism Spectrum Disorders.  Format  The test consists of 50 statements, each of which is in a forced choice format. Each question allows the subject to indicate \\"definitely agree\\", \\"slightly agree\\", \\"slightly disagree\\" or \\"definitely disagree\\". Approximately half the questions are worded to elicit an \\"agree\\" response from neurotypical individuals, and half to elicit a \\"disagree\\" response. The subject scores one point for each question which is answered \\"autistically\\" either slightly or definitely.\\"Each item scores one point if the respondent records the abnormal behaviour either mildly or strongly\\" The questions cover five different domains associated with the autism spectrum: social skills; communication skills; imagination; attention to detail; and attention switching/tolerance of change. Factor analysis of sample results have been inconsistent, with various studies finding two, three or four factors instead of five.  Use as a diagnostic tool  In the initial trials of the test, the average score in the control group was 16.4, with men scoring slightly higher than women (about 17 versus about 15). 80% of adults diagnosed with autism spectrum disorders scored 32 or more, compared with only 2% of the control group. The authors cited a score of 32 or more as indicating \\"clinically significant levels of autistic traits\\". However, although the test is popularly used for self-diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders, the authors caution that it is not intended to be diagnostic, and advise that anyone who obtains a high score and is suffering some distress should seek professional medical advice and not jump to any conclusions. A further research paper indicated that the questionnaire could be used for screening in clinical practice, with scores less than 26 indicating that a diagnosis of Asperger syndrome can effectively be ruled out. It is also often used to assess milder variants of autistic-like traits in neurotypical individuals.  Mathematicians, scientists and engineers  Although most students with an autism spectrum disorder have average mathematical ability and test slightly worse in mathematics than in general intelligence, some are gifted in mathematics and autism spectrum disorder has not prevented some adults from major accomplishments. The questionnaire was tried on Cambridge University students and a group of 16 winners of the British Mathematical Olympiad to determine whether there was a link between a talent for mathematical and scientific disciplines and traits associated with the autism spectrum. Mathematics, physical sciences, and engineering students were found to score significantly higher, e.g., 21.8 on average for mathematicians and 21.4 for computer scientists. The average score for the British Mathematical Olympiad winners was 24.

Visitors can tour the farmhouse, which has been restored to appear as it did during the 1840s, and exhibits about Transcendentalism and the Alcott family. Fruitlands offers a diverse schedule of contemporary exhibits, lectures, outdoor concerts and easy walking trails. There is also a museum store and restaurant. The properties are overseen by The Trustees of Reservations. History Fruitlands, inspired by Transcendentalism and Amos Bronson Alcott's ideas of societal reform, was established on purchased by Charles Lane in May 1843. People interested in joining the community began moving in the next month and the site was optimistically named \\"Fruitlands\\" despite having only a small cluster of apple trees. The community was based on self-sufficiency, using no hired labor and growing all the food they needed themselves. The community ultimately failed because of the difficulty in growing crops. Community members began moving away as early as October 1843; Lane and Alcott abandoned it in January 1844. The property was purchased in 1910 by Clara Endicott Sears, who opened the farmhouse to the public in 1914 as a museum. In addition to the Fruitlands building, the site now includes a transplanted Shaker house from the nearby Harvard Shaker Village, Native American artifacts and Hudson River School paintings.Massachusetts Office of Travel and tourism - Find Lodging - Fruitlands Museum, retrieved 1 October 2008 The museum is primarily the result of the efforts of Sears, a preservationist.National Park Service - Fruitlands Museum Historic District, retrieved 1 October 2008 Since 2015, the Fruitlands Museum has held an amateur cyclocross race on its grounds. Notorious for the rough surface of the course as well as the often muddy off-cambers utilized, it has quickly become a favorite amongst the New England cyclocross community.

It was originally suggested to be a subtype of autistic spectrum disorders (PDD) with co-morbid schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder; however, there is some controversy that not everyone with MCDD meets criteria for both PDD and psychosis. The term multiplex developmental disorder was coined by Donald J. Cohen in 1986. Diagnostic criteria The current diagnostic criteria for MCDD are a matter of debate due to it not being in the DSM-V or ICD-10. Various websites contain various diagnostic criteria. At least three of the following categories should be present. Co-occurring clusters of symptoms must also not be better explained by being symptoms of another disorder such as experiencing mood swings due to autism, cognitive difficulties due to schizophrenia, and so on. The exact diagnostic criteria for MCDD remain unclear but may be a useful diagnosis for people who do not fall into any specific category. It could also be argued that MCDD is a vague and unhelpful term for these patients. =Psychotic symptoms= Criteria are met for a psychotic disorder. Some symptoms may include: #Delusions, such as thought insertion, paranoid preoccupations, fantasies of personal omnipotence, over engagement with fantasy figures, grandiose fantasies of special powers, referential ideation, and confusion between fantasy and real life. #Hallucinations and/or unusual perceptual experiences. #Negative symptoms (anhedonia, affective flattening, alogia, avolition) #Disorganized behavior and/or speech such as thought disorder, easy confusability, inappropriate emotions/facial expressions, uncontrollable laughter, etc. #Catatonic behavior. =Affective and behavioral symptoms= These symptoms are not due to situations such as, person is depressed because of difficulty making friends. It is normal to experience dysfunctional emotions and behaviors at times. Criteria are met for a neurotic or personality disorder, preferably at least two. Some symptoms may include: #Depression. #Mania. #Anxiety. #Anger. #Dissociative symptoms such as depersonalization, derealization, deja vu, etc. #Emotional instability. #Psychopathic behavior. #Narcissism. #Paranoia. #Obsessive-compulsive behavior. =Autistic symptoms= Criteria are met for an autistic spectrum disorder. Some symptoms may include: #Difficulty with social skills. #Repetitive behaviour and patterns. #Sensory processing disorder. (Poor motor skills, poor auditory processing, poor depth perception, etc.) #Alexithymia. (Difficulty expressing self, difficulty understanding emotions, literal concrete thinking, etc.) #Lack of eye contact. #Intense, singular interests. #Low interest in dress up games during childhood. =Neurological symptoms= Because these are frequently found in cases of autistic disorders, criteria could be met for multiple neurological disorders, or cause severe symptoms. Some examples include: #Learning difficulties symptoms such as dyslexia, dysgraphia, dyscalcula, NVLD, slow learning, poor memory, etc. #AD/HD symptoms such as poor concentration, poor decision making, poor judgement, impulsiveness, difficulty sitting still, etc. #Synesthesia. #Neurological sleep disorders such as narcolepsy, insomnia, circadian rhythm disorder, etc. #Conditions affecting perceptions and/or cognition, such as agnosia, aphasia, etc. #Tourette syndrome or Tic disorder. #Epilepsy or Seizure disorder. #Parkinsonian syndrome features such as tremors, stiff movements, etc. Causes Multiple complex developmental disorder is likely to be caused by a number of different various genetic factors. Each individual with MCDD is unique from one another and displays different symptoms. Various neuropsychological disorders can also be found in family members of people with MCDD.

The Arava Institute for Environmental Studies (AIES) is an academic studies and research institute located at Kibbutz Ketura on the Israeli side of the Arava Valley. Under the motto that \\"nature knows no borders\\", AIES seeks to train future leaders of the Middle East in environmental issues so that they will be able to cooperate in solving regional environmental problems. The Arava is a sparsely populated desert valley that connects the Dead Sea region with the Red Sea, and is part of the Jordan Rift Valley. Between the Dead Sea and the cities of Eilat and Aqaba, the Arava forms the border between Israel and Jordan. Kibbutz Ketura, founded in 1973 by members of Young Judaea, is located only a few hundred meters from the border between Israel and Jordan. Kibbutz Ketura is one of a small number of intentional communities in Israel, and that makes it an ideal setting for a culturally diverse program. Members of the Kibbutz are both religious and non-religious Jews who have chosen to live together in the same community and maintain an egalitarian synagogue. The kibbutz is also a member of Israel's Green Kibbutzim movement, which seeks to promote environmentally friendly and sustainable practices. A portion of the kibbutz's agricultural produce is organic.  Students and academic programs  Students at the Arava Institute live on Kibbutz Ketura while taking classes in sustainable development, water management, environmental law, economic policy, environmental science, and other topics in environmental studies. Classes are taught in English. Members of the faculty are often guest lecturers from universities, both in Israel and abroad, or professionals in fields such as public policy and water management. Students come from around the world to study and conduct research at the Arava Institute. Since its founding in 1996, the Arava Institute has hosted over 800 graduate and undergraduate students of various nationalities, including Israeli Jewish, Israeli Arab, Palestinian, Jordanian, Egyptian, Tunisian, Moroccan, European and American students. The Arava Institute has been able to maintain a diverse student body even during very difficult times elsewhere in Israel and the Middle East. Lecture on the ecology of coral reefs in the Gulf of Aqaba, 2018 AIES students can participate in semester and year-long programs accredited through Ben Gurion University as well as two master's degree graduate programs granted by Ben-Gurion University ‚Äì one in Environmental Desert Studies and the other a ‚ÄúGreen‚Äù MBA that teaches environmental sustainability and efficiency as well as business management skills. A three-week summer course is sometimes offered to study biodiversity and environmental challenges in the Arava Valley. The Arava Institute is considering establishing a joint Master's program with Al-Quds University, the only Arab institution of higher learning in Jerusalem. All AIES students are required to completes a non-credit bearing Peace-Building and Environmental Leadership Seminar, which provides them with a facilitated forum for expressing their views on race, religion, identity, and the political situation. This is often considered as a successful environmental peacebuilding practice and can make a small, yet important effect on everyday (or local) peace.  Alumni  Many of the Arava Institute graduates are working in the environmental or peacebuilding field. The institute has created an alumni network to continue supporting alumni by providing personal and professional contacts as well as seed money for alumni projects that demonstrate cross-cultural cooperation. Several alumni of the institute have gone on to work in cross-cultural projects. * Hashem Shahin, a Muslim Palestinian alumnus, is part of a joint Israeli-Palestinian project to discover the genetic basis of deafness. * Tamar Keinan, a Jewish Israeli alumna, joined a Jordanian alumnus to create the \\"Good Neighbors Water Project\\" for Friends of the Earth Middle East. * Laithi Gnaim, an Israeli Arab alumnus, established a nongovernmental organization called \\"Arrasid\\" (Bearing Witness) which trains Arab farmers in the Beit Netofa Valley in sustainable farming techniques. He has used connections made at the Arava Institute to offer training in sustainable practices and bui Arab-Jewish partnerships in the agricultural sector. * Maya Negev, a Jewish Israeli alumna, working at the Herzog Center for Policy in Tel Aviv University Others are working in NGOs working on solutions to hygiene and energy in rural and poor areas, working on environmental education and awareness, activists in peace-related activities and more. The Arava Institute has recently added a new network to build more connections between alumni. The Arava Alumni Peace and Environmental Network (AAPEN) brings together alumni from all years of study during an annual conference held in varying locations in the Middle East, as well as an online presence on Facebook, a private online network (NING), updated pages on the Arava website for alumni, a newsletter, and more.  Research centers  In addition to its academic programs, the Arava Institute conducts cross-border studies in four research centers: * The Center for Hyper-Arid Socio-Ecology (CHASE), directed by Dr. Miri Lavi Neeman, is dedicated to the study of the natural ecosystems in the Arava valley and the interaction between those ecosystems and the region's people. The center brings together Jordanian and Israeli researchers to map the biodiversity of the region, in order to better protect natural resources while enabling sustainable human development in the region. Projects include monitoring of the 2014 Evrona Oil Spill. * The Center for Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation (CREEC), directed by Dr. Tareq abu Hamed, conducts research in a wide variety of subjects focusing on energy policy, solar fuels, photovoltaic technologies, biomass, wind and solar thermal energy, as well as innovative building construction techniques customized to conserve energy in desert climates. The \\"Methuselah\\" tree * The Center for Sustainable Agriculture (CSA), directed by Dr. Elaine Solowey, is dedicated to the investigation and preservation of arid lands and their natural resources. Among the center's notable projects are the sprouting of a 2,000 year old date seed, nicknamed \\"Methuselah\\", and the revival of the frankincense tree in Israel 1,500 years after its last appearance in the region. * The Center for Transboundary Water Management (CTWM), directed by Dr. Clive Lipchin, provides a platform for water professionals and policy makers from Israel, Palestine and Jordan to cooperate in water conservation, desalination, wastewater treatment and education. Its project include the installation of greywater treatment systems in Israel and the West Bank, and research on sinkholes and desalination in the Dead Sea basin. In addition, the Arava Center for Sustainable Development (ACSD), under the supervision of Dr. Shmuel Brenner, aims to reduce poverty, enhance sustainability and empower communities by supporting locally driven, environmentally focused development programs worldwide. One of those programs is the agricultural development program \\"Furrows in the Desert\\" in Turkana, Kenya, which intends to create greater food security to the region by building local capacity in sustainable agriculture.

He was best known during the 1950s and 1960s as an advertiser on Radio Luxembourg. He advertised a way to win money by predicting the results of football matches, sponsoring programmes on the station. His spelling out of Keynsham, a town in western England where he operated, made it famous. The \\"Famous Infra-Draw Method\\" Batchelor sponsored programmes on Radio Luxembourg to promote his \\"Famous Infra-Draw Method\\", a system that he claimed increased the chances of winning large sums on the football pools. Before the National Lottery started in 1994, the \\"Pools\\" was the only way to win large sums for a small stake. Listeners were asked to submit their stakes to Batchelor, who then determined how the stake was placed. He was paid only if the bet won. Infra-draw was thus not dependent on his predictive talent for its financial success. Advertising on Radio Luxembourg Radio Luxembourg was a music station broadcasting to Britain from Luxembourg as a way to circumvent the BBC's national monopoly and the policy in the United Kingdom of no broadcast advertising. The station played pop music promoted by record companies. The advertisers were allowed to buy air time in units of 15 minutes. Batchelor's programme usually featured the Deep River Boys, a gospel/barbershop group seemingly performing live. He voiced his own advertisements, inviting listeners to write for details of his \\"Famous Infra- Draw Method for the Treble Chance\\" that he promised was able to predict the drawn games on which winnings depended. The address was always read as \\"Horace Batchelor, Department One, Keynsham, spelt K-E-Y-N-S-H-A-M, Keynsham, Bristol\\". Batchelor needed to carefully spell Keynsham out loud for his listeners (and prospective clients), as the town's name is pronounced CANE- sham, and its spelling is not obvious from the way that it is pronounced. Batchelor's slow, very deliberate spelling and repeated mentions of Keynsham on his programme led to the town's name becoming something of a meme. Personal life Batchelor was a watercolour painter of many subjects. His studio was the entertainment room at the side of a detached house, a sparsely furnished, bow-windowed room with cocktail bar and steel shutters. He spent his last years mainly in one small room equipped with a chaise longue and two televisions, one colour, the other monochrome, rented from Granada TV Rental at Knowle, Bristol. His housekeeper communicated with visitors and tradesmen. His son Richard took over the business of results prediction.Memoirs of a Electronics engineer.Title: \\"Life after Bath Tech\\".

Saint-Clair resisted the interests of the Mafia for several years after Prohibition ended; she continued to be an independent operator and never came under Mafia control. She ran a successful numbers game in Harlem and was an activist for the black community. Her nicknames included: \\"Queenie\\", \\"Madam Queen\\", \\"Madam St. Clair\\", and \\"Queen of the Policy Rackets\\". Early life Stephanie Saint- Clair was born of mixed French and African descent in the West Indies to a single mother, F√©licienne, who worked hard to send her daughter to school. According to St. Clair's 1924 Declaration of Intention, she gave Moule Grandterre, French West Indies (present-day Guadeloupe, West Indies) as her place of birth, not Martinique as has usually been cited.Source Citation: National Archives and Records Administration; Washington, DC; ARC Title: Index to Petitions for Naturalizations Filed in Federal, State, and Local Courts in New York City, 1792-1906; NAI Number: 5700802; Record Group Title: Records of District Courts of the United States, 1685-2009; Record Group Number: RG 21 Source Information: Ancestry.com.

When St√©phanie turned 15, her mother became very ill and she had to leave school. She was employed as a maid by a rich family, where she was repeatedly raped by the son. She managed to save some money and, after the death of her mother, finally left Guadeloupe for France in 1912. Even though she could read and write, a rare quality for a black woman at the time, she could not find decent employment. She immigrated to the United States via Marseille on The Guiana, arriving in New York on July 31, 1911.Source Citation Year: 1911; Arrival: New York, New York; Microfilm Serial: T715, 1897-1957; Microfilm Roll: Roll 1715; Line: 20; Page Number: 28 Source Information: Ancestry.com. New York, Passenger Lists, 1820-1957 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc., 2010. She used the long voyage and subsequent quarantine to learn English. In Harlem, she fell in love with a small-time crook, Duke, who soon tried to prostitute her. Enraged, she stabbed a fork into his eye and promptly left New York on a bus. The following night, the bus was stopped by the Ku Klux Klan. Several black passengers were hanged or burnt alive in front of her, and she was repeatedly raped. Following this incident, she returned to New York, learning that Duke had been shot in a fight between gangs. After four months, she decided to start her own business, selling controlled drugs with the help of her new boyfriend, Ed. Much of this speculation about St. Claire's early life is derived from an biographical novel, Madame St-Clair, Reine de Harlem, by Martinican author Rapha√´l Confiant (available in English translation as Madam St. Clair, Queen of Harlem). After a few months, she had made $30,000 and told Ed she wanted to leave him and start her own business. Ed tried to strangle her and she pushed him away with such force that he cracked his skull against a table and died. For months afterwards, she employed her own men, bribed cops, and on April 12, 1917, invested $10,000 of her own money in a clandestine lottery game in Harlem. As a result of her success running one of the leading numbers games in the city, she became known throughout Manhattan as \\"Queenie\\", but Harlem residents referred to her as \\"Madame Saint-Clair\\". Numbers game involvement She was involved in policy banking, an admixture of investing, gambling, and playing the lottery. Many banks at this time would not accept black customers, so they were not able to invest legally. Policy banking wasn't technically legal, but it was the only way for black individuals living in Harlem to invest their money. In this way she used the underground economy in Harlem to address race politics. At this time the numbers game in Harlem was male-dominated and Saint-Clair was one of the only women involved. Saint-Clair helped the black community in Harlem by providing many with jobs as numbers runners and other jobs within her business. Because of her success in the numbers game, she lived a lavish life making over $20,000 a year in the 1920s. Police corruption Saint-Clair was known to put out ads in the local newspapers educating the Harlem community about their legal rights, advocating for voting rights, and calling out police brutality against the black community. Several times she complained to local authorities about harassment by the police. When they paid no heed she ran advertisements in Harlem newspapers, accusing senior police officers of corruption. The police responded by arresting her on a trumped-up charge and she spent eight months in a workhouse. In response she testified to the Seabury Commission about the kickbacks she had paid police officers and those who had participated in the Harlem numbers game. The Commission subsequently fired more than a dozen police officers. Conflict with the Mafia After the end of Prohibition, Jewish and Italian-American crime families saw a decrease in profits and decided to move in on the Harlem gambling scene. Bronx-based mob boss Dutch Schultz was the first to move in, beating and killing numbers operators who would not pay him protection. Saint-Clair and her chief enforcer Ellsworth \\"Bumpy\\" Johnson refused to pay protection to Schultz, despite the violence and intimidation by police they faced. St. Clair responded by attacking the storefronts of businesses that ran Dutch Schultz's betting operations and tipping off the police about him. This resulted in the police raiding his house, arresting more than a dozen of his employees and seizing approximately $12 million (about $172 million in 2019 currency). Saint-Clair never submitted to Dutch Schultz like many others in Harlem eventually did. After Saint-Clair's struggles with Schultz, she had to become legitimate and stay away from the police, so she passed on her criminal business to \\"Bumpy\\" Johnson. Eventually her former enforcer negotiated with Lucky Luciano, and Lucky took over Schultz's spots, with a percentage going to \\"Bumpy\\". The Italians then had to go to \\"Bumpy\\" first if they had any problems in Harlem. Luciano realized that the struggle with the Five Families was hurting their business, so Schultz was assassinated in 1935 on the orders of The Commission. Although St. Clair was not involved with his murder, she was remembered for sending an infamous telegram to his bed that stated ‚ÄúAs ye sow, so shall ye reap.‚Äù The telegram reportedly made headlines across the nation. By the 1940s, \\"Bumpy\\" Johnson had become the reigning king in Harlem, while Saint-Clair became less and less involved in the numbers game. Later life After Saint- Clair retired from the numbers game, she started a new era of her life as an advocate for political reform. In the late 1930s, Saint-Clair met her husband, Sufi Abdul Hamid, known as the \\"Black Hitler\\" for his anti-Semitic, Nazi fashion of activism. Hamid was a militant activist and was the leader of an Islamic Buddhist cult. Saint-Clair and Hamid's marriage went downhill quickly when he started cheating with a black fortune teller known as \\"Fu Futtam\\". Hamid and Futtam attempted to open a business with Saint-Clair's money, and their marriage officially ended in 1938 when Hamid was shot. Saint-Clair was charged for shooting at him and spent 10 years in the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women in New York. After she was released from prison, Saint-Clair continued her work in informing those in the community of their civil liberties. She continued to write columns in the local newspaper about discrimination, police brutality, illegal search raids, and other issues facing the black community. Death She died quietly and still wealthy in 1969, shortly before her 73rd birthday. One year earlier, \\"Bumpy\\" Johnson, who came back to live with her and to write poetry, had died.

The 1913 Ottoman coup d'√©tat (January 23, 1913), also known as the Raid on the Sublime Porte (), was a coup d'√©tat carried out in the Ottoman Empire by a number of Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) members led by Ismail Enver Bey and Muhammad Talaat Bey, in which the group made a surprise raid on the central Ottoman government buildings, the Sublime Porte (). During the coup, the army chief of staff, Nazƒ±m Pasha was assassinated and the Grand Vizier, K√¢mil Pasha, was forced to resign. After the coup, the government fell into the hands of the CUP, now under the leadership of the triumvirate known as the \\"Three Pashas\\", made up of Enver, Talaat, and Djemal Pasha. In 1911, the Freedom and Accord Party (also known as the Liberal Union or Liberal Entente), K√¢mil Pasha's party, was formed in opposition to the CUP and almost immediately won the by-elections in Constantinople (now Istanbul). Alarmed, the CUP rigged the general elections of 1912 with electoral fraud and violence against Freedom and Accord, earning them the nickname \\"Election of Clubs\\" (). In response, the Savior Officers () of the army, partisans of Freedom and Accord determined to see the CUP fall, rose up in anger and caused the fall of the CUP's post-election Muhammad Said Pasha government. A new government was formed under Ahmed Muhtar Pasha, but it too was dissolved after a few months in October 1912 after the sudden outbreak of the First Balkan War. After gaining the permission of sultan Mehmed V to form a new government in late October 1912, Freedom and Accord leader K√¢mil Pasha sat down to diplomatic talks with Bulgaria after the unsuccessful First Balkan War. With the Bulgarian demand for the cession of the former Ottoman capital city of Adrianople (today, and in Turkish at the time, known as Edirne) looming and the outrage among the Turkish populace as well as the CUP leadership, the CUP carried out the raid on the Sublime Porte. After the coup, opposition parties like Freedom and Accord were subject to heavy repression and their leaders arrested or exiled to Europe, while many CUP members were put into power. Coup leader Enver Bey (later Pasha), soon to be Minister of War, withdrew the Ottoman Empire from the ongoing London Peace Conference and moved it closer to Germany ahead of World War I. Immediate pretext While the inner circle of the CUP may already have decided earlier to stage a coup to regain power from the Freedom and Accord Party, the proximate occasion was the CUP's fear that the government would concede to a demand by the Great Powers that the town of Adrianople (a former Ottoman capital city from 1365 to 1453) should be handed over to Bulgaria after the disastrous results of the First Balkan War for the Ottoman Empire. Background =April 1912 elections and aftermath= In the 1908 elections, the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) had only managed to win about 60 of the 288 seats in the Chamber of Deputies (), the popularly elected lower house of the General Assembly. Nevertheless, it was the largest party in the Chamber. The Freedom and Accord Party (Liberal Union/Entente) was founded on 21 November 1911 by those in opposition to the CUP, and immediately attracted 70 Deputies to its ranks. Only 20 days after its formation, Freedom and Accord won the December 1911 by-elections conducted in Constantinople by one vote. The ruling CUP, seeing the potential of Freedom and Accord to win next year's general elections, took several precautions. Hoping to thwart the nascent Freedom and Accord's efforts to grow its ranks and better organize itself, the CUP asked Sultan Mehmed V to dissolve the Chamber and announced its call for early general elections in January 1912.Hasan Kayalƒ± (1997) Arabs and Young Turks University of California Press These early April 1912 general elections were known infamously as the \\"Election of Clubs\\" () after the beating of opposition (Freedom and Accord) candidates for the Chamber of Deputies with weapons like clubs and sticks as well being marred by electoral fraud and violence in favor of the CUP. The fraud included early balloting, secret counting and reporting of votes, ballot stuffing, reapportioning electoral districts, and more, although the CUP still enjoyed genuine support outside of the cities. The results of the elections had CUP win 269 of 275 seats in the Chamber, with Freedom and Accord only netting 6 Deputies. Angered at their loss in the election, the leadership of Freedom and Accord sought extra-legal methods to regain power over the CUP, complaining vocally about electoral fraud. At around this time, a group of military officers, uncomfortable with injustices it perceived within the military, organized itself into an armed organization known as the \\"Savior Officers\\" () and made their presence known to the imperial government. The Savior Officers, quickly becoming partisans of Freedom and Accord, soon created unrest in the capital Istanbul. After gaining the support of Prince Sabahaddin, another opposition leader, the Savior Officers published public declarations in newspapers. Finally, after giving a memorandum to the Military Council, the Savior Officers succeeded in getting Grand Vizier Mehmed Said Pasha (who they blamed for allowing the early elections that led to the CUP domination of the Chamber) and his government of CUP ministers to resign in July 1912. =Great Cabinet= The Grand Vizier and leader of the three-month \\"Great Cabinet\\", Ahmed Muhtar Pasha. After Mehmed Said Pasha's resignation, a new, non-partisan cabinet was formed by Ahmed Muhtar Pasha, an old military hero, which was known as the \\"Great Cabinet\\" () because it included three former Grand Viziers as ministers and sometimes as the \\"Father-Son Cabinet\\" () because it included Ahmed Muhtar Pasha's son, Mahmud Muhtar Pasha, as Minister of the Navy. Although the Savior Officers had succeeded in making sure that the Great Cabinet was free of CUP members, the CUP's domination of the Chamber of Deputies had not changed. Soon, however, rumors began to circulate that the government would dissolve the Chamber of Deputies and call new elections. The rumors were confirmed when, a few days after Ahmed Muhtar Pasha took office, the Savior Officers sent another memorandum, this time to the President of the Chamber of Deputies (and CUP member), Halil Bey, demanding that the Chamber be dissolved for new elections within 48 hours. The CUP members in the Chamber condemned and censured this threat. However, thanks to a law he had passed through the Senate, Ahmed Muhtar Pasha was able, with the sultan's support, to dissolve the Chamber with ease on 5 August, after which sultan Mehmed V immediately called for new elections by royal decree. While preparations for new elections were underway, however, the First Balkan War erupted early in October 1912, catching Ahmed Muhtar Pasha's administration off-guard. Martial law was declared, the new elections were cancelled on 25 October, and Ahmed Muhtar Pasha resigned as Grand Vizier on 29 October after just three months in the premier's office in order to defer to the premiership of K√¢mil Pasha, who had good relations with the British and was expected to produce a favorable settlement to the disastrous war. =Government of K√¢mil Pasha and lead-up to the coup= Although the foreign crisis in the Balkans put a temporary halt to domestic politics, it did not stop them. Unlike his predecessor Ahmed Muhtar Pasha, who had been non-partisan, K√¢mil Pasha was a passionate Freedom and Accord Party member and was determined to use his premiership to destroy the CUP. Prior to World War I, Enver Pasha was hailed at home as the hero of the revolution. Freedom and Accord and anti-CUP Grand Vizier K√¢mil Pasha, who led the government until his forced resignation in the coup. Using his friendly relations with the British, K√¢mil Pasha also sat down to end the ongoing First Balkan War diplomatically. However, the heavy Ottoman military upsets during the war continued to sap morale, as rumors that the capital would have to be moved from Constantinople to inland Anatolia spread. The Bulgarian Army had soon advanced as far as √áatalca, a western district of modern Istanbul. At this point, K√¢mil Pasha's government signed an armistice with Bulgaria in December 1912 and sat down to draw up a treaty for the end of the war at the London Peace Conference. The Great Powers‚Äìthe British Empire, France, Italy, and Russia‚Äìhad begun to engage in the relationship of Bulgaria with the Ottoman Empire, citing the 1878 Treaty of Berlin. The Great Powers gave a note to the Sublime Porte (the Ottoman government) that they wanted the Ottoman Empire to cede Adrianople (Edirne) to Bulgaria and the Aegean islands under its control, most of which by that time had been captured by the Greek Navy, to the Great Powers themselves. Because of the losses experienced by the army so far in the war, the K√¢mil Pasha government was inclined to accept the \\"Midye-Enez Line\\" as a border to the west and, while not outright giving Edirne to Bulgaria, favored transferring control of it to an international commission. After the capture of Salonica (Thessaloniki), the birthplace of many progressive political leaders and movements of the era, by Greece in November 1912, many CUP members were arrested by Greek forces and exiled to Anatolia. At the same time, Freedom and Accord found itself on the brink of dissolution after inter-party conflicts. Left with little political power and flexibility, the CUP began to plan a coup against K√¢mil Pasha's Freedom and Accord government. In addition, an animosity had already been brewing between K√¢mil Pasha and the CUP since the 1908 Young Turk Revolution that had started the Second Constitutional Era. During the more than four years since, K√¢mil Pasha had made a series of efforts to keep CUP members far from government and keep the army, which had many CUP members among its ranks, out of politics. By January 1913, the CUP was thoroughly frustrated with K√¢mil Pasha and Freedom and Accord. Although the coup was to be a surprise attack, the CUP had made definitive decisions to carry it out far in advance. Although he was killed during the coup, both the CUP and Freedom and Accord claimed that they had been planning to give Minister of the Navy Nazƒ±m Pasha a position in their next cabinet. The CUP's Talaat Bey went as far as to say some time after the coup that the CUP had previously offered Nazƒ±m Pasha the position of Grand Vizier and the leadership its cabinet. Events Le Petit Journal magazine in February 1913 depicting the assassination of Minister of War Nazƒ±m Pasha during the coup. =March towards the Sublime Porte= On 23 January 1913, at 14:30, Lieutenant Colonel Enver Bey (later and better known as Enver Pasha), one of the top leaders of the Committee of Union and Progress, was notified by a CUP member named that everything was prepared for the raid as he waited in the military supply-station inspectorate () building near the Nuruosmaniye Mosque. After receiving this news, Enver Bey mounted a white horse waiting for him and began to ride the several blocks from Nuruosmaniye towards the Sublime Porte, which was a metonym referring to a group of government buildings that housed the offices of the Grand Vizier, his imperial government, and other state offices. At this time, Talaat Bey (later and better known as Talaat Pasha) also began to make his way towards the Sublime Porte with a group of CUP loyalists. When Enver Bey arrived in front the Ministry of Public Works () building, fellow CUP members and √ñmer Seyfettin (who would later become one of the foremost Turkish writers of the 20th century) were already provoking a crowd that had gathered by loudly proclaiming that K√¢mil Pasha was about to cede Adrianople to the Bulgarians. The speeches made by √ñmer Naci and √ñmer Seyfettin were effective, and the front of the Sublime Porte was soon filled with a crowd shouting slogans against K√¢mil Pasha's government. Moreover, up to 60 CUP members were placed around the Sublime Porte's buildings. =Entering the Sublime Porte= Enver Bey, along with confederates Talaat Bey, Sapancalƒ± Hakkƒ±, , , and about 50 others, entered the Sublime Porte compound of government buildings and made their way into the Grand Vizier's building, in which K√¢mil Pasha and his cabinet were in session. An aide-de-camp to the Grand Vizier, Ohrili N√¢fiz Bey, heard the commotion and opened fire on the raid party but was unable to hit any of them. Himself wounded in the exchange, Ohrili N√¢fiz Bey hid in the aide-de-camp office; when Mustafa Necip entered the office, Ohrili N√¢fiz Bey shot and killed him but died himself of his wounds sustained from Mustafa Necip. An aid-de-camp and nephew of Nazƒ±m Pasha, Kƒ±brƒ±slƒ± Tevfik Bey, had also drawn his revolver and fired at the raid party, his bullet also striking Mustafa Necip. After the raiders returned fire, Kƒ±brƒ±slƒ± Tevfik Bey was instantly killed. During the shooting, a secret police agent and an attendant of the Sheikh ul-Islam were also killed. =Shooting of Nazƒ±m Pasha= Hearing the gunshots, Minister of War Nazƒ±m Pasha stepped out of his room and rushed towards the raid party. According to the memoirs of future Turkish President and Prime Minister Cel√¢l Bayar, Nazƒ±m Pasha angrily shouted at the men, \\"What is going on? You came to raid the Grand Vizier's office?\\", using \\"ill- mannered\\" profanities in his rage, after which Enver Bey saluted him and tried to explain his intentions. At this time Yakub Cemil, approaching Nazƒ±m Pasha from the back while he was engaged with Enver Bey and the rest of the coup party, fired his gun at Nazƒ±m Pasha's right temple, killing him. Another account claimed that Enver Bey had tried to stop Yakup Cemil from killing Nazƒ±m Pasha, but Yakup Cemil had refused to listen. Yet another version of events held that either Enver Bey or Talaat Bey had accidentally killed Nazƒ±m Pasha while trying to protect themselves from gunfire from his aid-de-camp Kƒ±brƒ±slƒ± Tevfik Bey. In any case, the CUP termed Nazƒ±m Pasha's death during the coup a \\"regrettable accident\\", saying that it was unpremeditated but \\"unavoidable\\" under the circumstances. The CUP said that the fact Interior Minister had been allowed to go unhurt proved that the coup leaders had desired to avoid bloodshed, since Ahmet Re≈üit was much more hostile towards the CUP than Nazƒ±m Pasha was. Because the CUP had favored Nazƒ±m Pasha and had claimed to offer him a role as Grand Vizier for a future CUP cabinet before they undertook the coup, the contemporary French magazine L'Illustration said that his \\"strange fate was being persecuted by the former regime [of K√¢mil Pasha's Freedom and Accord Party and then being included in its cabinet], and being cheered and treated in triumph by the new regime [of the CUP] and then being murdered by it.\\" =Forced resignation of K√¢mil Pasha= Enver Bey asking K√¢mil Pasha to resign during the raid on the Sublime Porte. After this, Enver and Talaat Bey entered Grand Vizier K√¢mil Pasha's room and forced him to write a letter of resignation at gunpoint. The letter addressed to the sultan read: After K√¢mil Pasha finished writing, Enver Bey immediately left the Sublime Porte to deliver the letter to Sultan Mehmed V in his palace, driving to the palace in the Sheikh ul-islam's (≈ûeyh√ºlislam) car. Aftermath =Immediate effects= Enver Bey (center) speaking to a correspondent for the French magazine L'Illustration and the British attach√© in Constantinople (Istanbul) immediately after seizing power in the coup. After the coup, Enver Bey told a local Turkish correspondent for the French magazine L'Illustration (pictured on right): K√¢mil Pasha was replaced as Grand Vizier and Nazƒ±m Pasha as Minister of War by Enver Bey's friend Mahmud Shevket Pasha, who held both posts. The new cabinet under Mahmud Shevket Pasha, made up entirely of CUP members, was made up of: * Said Halim Pasha as President of the Council of State (for 3 days) * Talaat Bey (now Pasha) as Minister of the Interior * √á√ºr√ºksulu Mahmud Pasha as Minister of the Navy * Nicolae Constantin Batzaria as Minister of Public Works * Muhtar Bey as acting Minister of Foreign Affairs (for 3 days)  Said Halim Pasha succeeding him * as Minister of Justice * as Minister of Pious Foundations * Mehmed Celal Bey as Minister of Agriculture * as Minister of Education * Oskan Mandikyan as Minister of Posts, Telegraph and Telephone Although the CUP appointed Grand Vizier Mahmud Shevket Pasha to lead their cabinet, he was genial towards the now-opposition Freedom and Accord Party. When one of Nazƒ±m Pasha's relatives assassinated him in revenge in June 1913, the CUP used the opportunity to crack down on the opposition. Twelve men held responsible by the CUP for Mahmud Shevket Pasha's death, including Nazƒ±m Pasha's relative, were convicted for murder and hanged. The opposition parties, already sidelined by the coup, were heavily repressed by the CUP. The leaders of the Savior Officers () escaped to Egypt and Albania.An essay on the Savior Officers Another opposition leader Prince Sabahaddin, who had backed the Savior Officers against the CUP, fled to western Switzerland, where he would remain until 1919. =Long-term legacy= The coup essentially established the domination of the Ottoman Empire by a so- called dictatorial triumvirate known as the \\"Three Pashas\\": the soon-to-be war minister, Enver Pasha, the soon-to-be interior minister, Talaat Pasha, and the soon-to-be naval minister, Djemal Pasha. The Three Pashas, leading the CUP autocratically, would control the Empire until fleeing the country at the end of World War I. It established the CUP as the dominant party of Young Turks in the Empire; the rival Young Turks party, Freedom and Accord, would not regain power until the end of the war. The coup is considered one of the first violent coups d'√©tat to take place in modern Turkish history, seen as some as establishing a precedent for future coups in the Republic of Turkey. After the coup, the CUP became increasingly nationalist and intolerant of opposition after seeing significant resistance from more liberal Ottoman parties like Freedom and Accord, as well as rebellions and wars against the Ottoman government from non-Muslim nationalities in the Empire, such as the catastrophic Balkan Wars, which saw former Ottoman citizens of Bulgarian, Greek, Macedonian, and Armenian ethnicity actively fighting against the Empire and committing widespread ethnic cleansing against Ottoman Muslims. Though initially opposed in principle to the extension of local autonomy to the provinces, the CUP now seemed inclined to reconcile with those in favor of greater extension of the millet system to enable Ottoman Muslim unity. A court session of the Turkish courts-martial of 1919‚Äì20. CUP's leaders, Enver, Djemal, Talaat, and others, were ultimately sentenced to death under charges of wartime profiteering and mistreatment of Armenians. The CUP government introduced several political and military reforms to the Empire, including increasing centralization and carrying out military modernization efforts. Under coup leader Enver Bey (later Pasha), the Ottoman Empire moved towards a closer relationship with the German Empire, officially leading to the Ottoman‚ÄìGerman Alliance being ratified the next year in 1914. Enver would enter the Empire into World War I that same year as part of the Central Powers, on the side of Germany, in contrast to the overthrown K√¢mil Pasha, who was partial towards the British. Although the CUP had worked with the Armenians to reinstall constitutional monarchy against Abdul Hamid II, factions in the CUP began to view the Armenians as a fifth column that would betray the Ottoman cause after World War I with nearby Russia broke out;Uƒüur √úmit √úng√∂r (2008) Geographies of Nationalism and Violence: Rethinking Young Turk ‚ÄòSocial Engineering‚Äô, European Journal of Turkish Studies, 7  2008 these factions gained more power after the 1913 Ottoman coup d'√©tat. The first major offensive the Turks undertook in World War I was an unsuccessful attempt to drive the Russians from the portion of Western Armenia they had taken in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877. After the failure of this expedition, the CUP's leaders, Enver, Djemal, and Talaat, were involved in ordering the deportations and massacres of 1 and 1.5 million Armenians in 1915-1916 in what became known as the Armenian Genocide. After World War I and the signing of the armistice of Mudros, the leadership of the Committee of Union and Progress and selected former officials were court-martialled with/including the charges of subversion of the constitution, wartime profiteering, and the massacres of both Armenians and Greeks. The court reached a verdict which sentenced the organizers of the massacres, Talat, Enver, Cemal and others to death. Question of popularity The public support for the coup was questioned at the time by analysts, some of whom reported that the CUP was backed by only a small crowd of actual citizens who had been gathered only within the hour by provocative speeches made by CUP members. Eyewitnesses and newspapers reported very little actual popular participation in the coup or the events surrounding it. Reporter Georges R√©mond said: R√©mond said that preventing the minimalist coup would have taken at most 50 guards, and that the only reason that the Sublime Porte had been defenseless was because K√¢mil Pasha wanted to call the bluff of any real threat the CUP, which he had sidelined politically, posed to his government. After the coup, R√©mond said, he found the capital Constantinople to be quiet and devoid of public opinion, whether about the coup or the ongoing First Balkan War, noting an air of \\"indifference\\" among not only the populace, but the statesmen involved themselves.

Early life The third son of Michael Doheny, of Brookhill, he was born at Brookhill, near Fethard, Co. Tipperary, and married a Miss O'Dwyer of that county. He was admitted to Gray's Inn in November 1834. Politics Doheny became connected with the national movement in the forties, and wrote prose and verse to The Nation over his initials, and signature of \\"Eiranach.\\" He may also have been \\"A Tipperary Man,\\" who wrote poems in the same paper between 1842 and 1848. He contributed letters to the Irish Tribune in 1848. Thomas Mooney states in his History of Ireland that Doheny was a parliamentary reporter in London in his early days. Rebellion of 1848 and life in the US He took part in the Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848, eluded arrest, and after being hunted by the police for some time, escaped to New York. He settled in the United States, and became a lawyer and a soldier with the Fenian Brotherhood. He was also instrumental in the founding of the Irish- American 69th Infantry Regiment, nicknamed the \\"Fighting Irish\\", in which he was a company commander. Though it was never involved in liberating Ireland, as Doheny hoped, the regiment would have an illustrious history in the American Civil War and both world wars. Conclusion On 1 April 1863 he died very suddenly and was buried in Calvary Cemetery. Works Is best known as author of a small work, The Felon's Track, (Text at Project Gutenberg) New York, 1867, and of two poems, \\"Achusha gal machree\\" and \\"The Outlaw's Wife.\\" References Sources Additional reading *The Politics of Irish Literature: from Thomas Davis to W.B.

He was drafted by the New York Giants in the fifth round of the 2009 NFL Draft. He played college football at the University of Oklahoma and Sam Houston State. He was also a member of the Minnesota Vikings and Oakland Raiders. Personal life As a boy, Bomar lived in Groesbeck, Texas where his father Jerry coached and was the ball boy for their State Championship team in 1991. Coached by his father at Grand Prairie High School who is now the athletic director and head coach of the high school football team in Beeville Texas. Bomar was a starter for three years. He was ranked as the nation's No. 1 high school quarterback of 2004 by the recruiting services Rivals.com and Scout.com and was compared to former NFL great John Elway. He threw for 1272 yards and rushed for 547 yards as a senior. Bomar committed to Oklahoma in February 2004. He played in the 2004 U.S. Army All-American Bowl. Bomar was an athletic director and the head coach of the football team at the Freer Early College High School, in Freer, Texas until March 2017. He currently holds the position of offensive coordinator at Alief Taylor High School in Houston, Texas. In the spring of 2017 it was announced that Bomar would follow former Alief Taylor defensive coordinator Cedric Hardeman to Conroe to become Hardeman‚Äôs offensive coordinator with the Tigers. College career =Oklahoma= Bomar became the starter by the 2nd game 2005 season. His season started roughly while he adjusted to college football, but his game improved throughout the season. He was named the Most Valuable Player of the Holiday Bowl when Oklahoma defeated the Oregon Ducks. On August 2, 2006, Bomar was dismissed from the team by OU head coach Bob Stoops. It was reported that he was paid for work at Big Red Sports and Imports, a car dealership owned by a major University of Oklahoma donor, but that he did not complete the work, a violation of NCAA rules. Senior Paul Thompson began the year as starting quarterback, backed up by true freshman Sam Bradford and junior college transfer Joey Halzle.\\"Stoops Names Paul Thompson Starter After Bomar Dismal\\" =Sam Houston State= Bomar entered spring practice as the starting quarterback for the 2007 Bearkats, with two years of collegiate eligibility remaining. He played nine games the first year for the Bearkats before injuring his knee on November 3, 2007 against Nicholls State. ‚ÄúRhett brings a lot of athleticism to the quarterback position that we haven‚Äôt had,‚Äù SHSU coach Todd Whitten told the Huntsville Item. ‚ÄúHe's going to get a chance to get a lot of reps this spring. We feel like our offense has the chance to make a lot of big plays next year.‚Äù Bomar started all 10 games in 2008 for Sam Houston State as the Bearkats went 4-6 on the season. He completed his college career as Sam Houston's all-time leader in passing with 5,564 yards in 19 games and career leader in total offense with 6,159 yards. He was a two-time All-Southland Conference selection and ended the 2008 season ranked No. 2 in NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision total offense (354.2 yards per game) and No. 4 in passing offense (335.5 yards per contest). Bomar passed for more than 300 yards in nine games during his Bearkat career. He threw for passes of more than 50 yards 10 times, including his longest of 80 yards. He is one of only 11 players in NCAA FCS history to throw for more than 300 yards and rush for more than 100 yards in a single game (against North Dakota State in 2007). He was also selected as a finalist for the Walter Payton Award given to the top player in the Football Championship Subdivision. Professional career =New York Giants= In the 2009 NFL Draft, Bomar was drafted by the New York Giants as the 15th pick of the 5th round (151 overall). Bomar on June 24, 2009 signed a four-year contract, including a $185,183 signing bonus. He was waived on September 5, 2009, and re-signed to the practice squad on September 6. Bomar was promoted to the active roster on December 31, 2009. On September 4, 2010, Bomar was waived by the Giants. Following an injury to Giants quarterback Jim Sorgi, Bomar was initially expected to take over the role as backup quarterback, but on September 3, 2010, the Giants acquired Sage Rosenfels from the Minnesota Vikings to step in at the position, making Bomar expendable. On the following day, September 5, the Giants re-signed Bomar to the team's practice squad. =Minnesota Vikings= Bomar was signed by the Minnesota Vikings off of the Giants' practice squad on December 21, 2010, and made him the team's third-string quarterback for the final two games of the season. =Oakland Raiders= On January 6, 2012, Bomar was signed by the Oakland Raiders to reserve/future contract. He was waived May 14, 2012, following the Raiders' acquisition of Matt Leinart.

They can include nutrition, avoidance of excessive sun exposure and appropriate use of emollients. Practices that enhance appearance include the use of cosmetics, botulinum, exfoliation, fillers, laser resurfacing, microdermabrasion, peels, retinol therapy and ultrasonic skin treatment. Skin care is a routine daily procedure in many settings, such as skin that is either too dry or too moist, and prevention of dermatitis and prevention of skin injuries. Skin care is a part of the treatment of wound healing, radiation therapy and some medications. Background Skin care is at the interface of cosmetics, and dermatology, a traditional medical discipline;Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary. Random House, Inc. 2001. Page 537. . there is some overlap with each of these topics. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act defines cosmetics as products intended to cleanse or beautify (for instance, shampoos and lipstick). A separate category exists for medications, which are intended to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent disease, or to affect the structure or function of the body (for instance, sunscreens and acne creams), although some products, such as moisturizing sunscreens and anti-dandruff shampoos, are regulated within both categories.Kessler R. More than Cosmetic Changes: Taking Stock of Personal Care Product Safety. Environ Health Perspect; DOI:10.1289/ehp.123-A120 FDA. Cosmetics: Guidance & Regulation; Laws & Regulations. Prohibited & Restricted Ingredients. [website]. U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Silver Spring, MD. Updated 26 January 2015. Skin care differs from dermatology, as traditionally practiced, by its additional but less medical scope and by its inclusion of non-physician professionals, such as estheticians and wound care nursing staff. Skin care includes modifications of individual behavior and of environmental and working conditions. Nevertheless, dermatology has co-opted some aspects of skin care, particularly in the U.S., and to a significantly lesser extent elsewhere, such as the U.K. Add fromHandbook of Cosmetic Skin Care Second Edition AVI SHAI, HOWARD I. MAIBACH, and ROBERT BARAN Published August 2009 Edition Second Pages 308 226 http://informahealthcare.com/isbn/9781616310004Antioxidants and skin care: The essentials Graf J - Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, 2010 Draelos ZD Active agents in common skin care products - Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, 2010 Neonate Guidelines for neonatal skin care have been developed. Nevertheless, the pediatric and dermatologic communities have not reached consensus on best cleansing practices, as good quality scientific evidence is scarce. Immersion in water seems superior to washing alone, and use of synthetic detergents or mild liquid baby cleansers seems comparable or superior to water alone. Add from Sunscreen A woman applying sunscreen Sun protection is an important aspect of skin care. Though the sun is beneficial in order for the human body to get its daily dose of vitamin D, unprotected excessive sunlight can cause extreme damage to the skin. Ultraviolet (UVA and UVB) radiation in the sun's rays can cause sunburn in varying degrees, early ageing and increased risk of skin cancer. UV exposure can cause patches of uneven skin tone and dry out the skin. This can reduce the skin's elasticity and encourage sagging and wrinkle formation. Sunscreen can protect the skin from sun damage; sunscreen should be applied at least 20 minutes before exposure, and should be re-applied every four hours. Sunscreen should be applied to all areas of the skin that will be exposed to sunlight, and at least a tablespoon (25 ml) should be applied to each limb, the face, chest, and back, to ensure thorough coverage. Many tinted moisturizers, foundations and primers now contain some form of SPF. Sunscreens may come in the form of creams, gels or lotions; their SPF number indicates their effectiveness in protecting the skin from the sun's radiation. There are sunscreens available to suit every skin type; in particular, those with oily skin should choose non-comedogenic sunscreens; those with dry skins should choose sunscreens with moisturizers to help keep skin hydrated, and those with sensitive skin should choose unscented, hypoallergenic sunscreen and spot-test in an inconspicuous place (such as the inside of the elbow or behind the ear) to ensure that it does not irritate the skin. Elderly Skin ageing is associated with increased vulnerability. Skin problems including pruritus are common in the elderly but are often inadequately addressed. A literature review of studies that assessed maintenance of skin integrity in the elderly found most to be low levels of evidence but the review concluded that skin- cleansing with synthetic detergents or amphoteric surfactants induced less skin dryness than using soap and water. Moisturizers with humectants helped with skin dryness, and skin barrier occlusives reduced skin injuries. There is limited evidence that moisturising soap bar; combinations of water soak, oil soak, and lotion are effecrive in maintaining the skin integrity of elderly people when compared to standard care. Acne According to the American Academy of Dermatology, between 40 and 50 million Americans suffer from acne each year. While many associate acne with adolescence, acne can occur at any age, with its causes including heredity, hormones, menstruation, food, and emotional stress. Those with inflammatory acne should exfoliate with caution as the procedure may make conditions worse and consult a dermatologist before treatment. Some anti-acne creams contain drying agents such as benzoyl peroxide (in concentrations of 2.5 - 10% ). Pressure sore Pressure sores are injuries to skin and underlying tissue as a result of prolonged pressure on the skin. A known example of pressure sore is bedsore called pressure ulcer. Stoma Add from Skin care management of gastrointestinal fistulas JL Dearlove - Surgical Clinics of North America, 1996 - Elsevier* Peristomal skin care: an overview of available products P Black - Br J Nurs, 2007 - silesse.com When cleaning the stoma area, plain warm water should be use and dry wipe to gently clean around the stoma. Pat gently and make sure not to rub the area. Put all used wipes in a disposable bag and wash your hands after. Wound healing Wound healing is a complex and fragile process in which the skin repairs itself after injury. It is susceptible to interruption or failure that creates non-healing chronic wounds. Nutrition Add from * 2001 American Society for Clinical Nutrition Nutritional skin care: health effects of micronutrients and fatty acids Esther Boelsma, Henk FJ Hendriks, and Len Roza. Radiation Radiation induces skin reactions in the treated area, particularly in the axilla, head and neck, perineum and skin fold regions. Formulations with moisturising, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial and wound healing properties are often used, but no preferred approach or individual product has been identified as best practice. Soft silicone dressings that act as barriers to friction may be helpful. In breast cancer, calendula cream may reduce the severity of radiation effects on the dark spot corrector. Deodorant use after completing radiation treatment has been controversial but is now recommended for practice. Add from EGFR Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors are medications used in cancer treatment. These medications commonly cause skin and nail problems, including rashes, dry skin and paronychia. Preventive intensive moisturising with emollient ointments several times, avoidance of water-based creams and water soaks (although in certain circumstances white vinegar or potassium permanganate soaks may help), protection the skin from excessive exposure to sunshine, and soap substitutes which are less dehydrating for the skin than normal soaps, as well as shampoos that reduce the risk of scalp folliculitis, are recommended. Treatment measures with topical antibiotic medication can be helpful. Related products Cosmeceuticals are topically-applied, combination products that bring together cosmetics and \\"biologically active ingredients\\". Products which are similar in perceived benefits but ingested orally are known as nutricosmetics. According to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \\"does not recognize any such category as \\"cosmeceuticals.\\" A product can be a drug, a cosmetic, or a combination of both, but the term \\"cosmeceutical\\" has no meaning under the law\\". Drugs are subject to an intensive review and approval process by FDA. Cosmetics, and these related products, although regulated, are not approved by FDA prior to sale. Procedures Skin care procedures include use of botulinum;http://www.allergan.com/assets/pdf/botox_cosmetic_pi.pdf exfoliation; fillers; laser medicine in cosmetic resurfacing, hair removal, vitiligo, port-wine stain and tattoo removal; photodynamic therapy; microdermabrasion; peels; retinol therapy.

It is a two-story structure east of the White House Executive Residence, the home of the president of the United States. While the West Wing generally serves the president's executive office staff, the East Wing serves as office space for the first lady and her staff, including the White House social secretary, White House Graphics and Calligraphy Office and correspondence staff. The East Wing also includes the visitors' entrance and the East Colonnade, a corridor connecting the body of the East Wing to the residence. Along the corridor is the White House theater, also called the Family theater. Social and touring visitors to the White House usually enter through the East Wing. Visitors touring the White House enter through the wood-paneled lobby, where portraits of presidents and first ladies hang. They go through the Garden Room and along the East Colonnade, which has a view of the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden, past the theater to the Visitors' Foyer. They enter the residence at the ground floor. History President Thomas Jefferson added colonnaded terraces to the east and west sides of the White House, but no actual wings. Under Jackson in 1834, running water was piped in from a spring and pumped up into the east terrace in metal tubes. These ran through the walls and protruded into the rooms, controlled by spigots. Initially, the water was for washing items, but soon the first bathing rooms were created, in the ground-level east colonnade. Van Buren had shower baths installed here. The East Terrace was removed in 1866. For many years, a greenhouse occupied the east grounds of the White House. The first small East Wing was built during the Theodore Roosevelt renovations, as an entrance for formal and public visitors. This served mainly as an entrance for guests during large social gatherings, when it was necessary to accommodate many cars and carriages‚Äîas well as many cloaks and hats. Its primary feature was the long cloak room with spots for coats and hats of the ladies and gentlemen. The White House Complex ‚Äì East Wing at right The East Wing as it exists today was added to the White House in 1942 primarily to cover the construction of an underground bunker, now known as the Presidential Emergency Operations Center (PEOC). Around the same time, Theodore Roosevelt's coatroom became the movie theater. Later, offices for correspondence, calligraphers and the social secretary were placed in the East Wing. Eleanor Roosevelt employed the first social secretary. Rosalynn Carter, in 1977, was the first First Lady to keep her own office in the East Wing. Today, the social secretary prepares all of the invitations and written correspondence for every event held at the White House.

By country = New Zealand= Dawn raids were a common event in Auckland, New Zealand, during a crackdown on illegal overstayers from the Pacific Islands from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. The raids were first introduced in 1973 by Norman Kirk's Labour government and were continued by Rob Muldoon's National government. These operations involved special police squads conducting raids on the homes and workplaces of overstayers throughout New Zealand usually at dawn. Overstayers and their families were often prosecuted and then deported back to their countries.Melanie Anae, 230‚Äì33 The Dawn Raids were a product of the New Zealand government's immigration policies to attract more Pacific Islanders. Since the 1950s, the New Zealand government had encouraged substantial emigration from several Pacific countries including Samoa, Tonga, and Fiji to fill a labour shortage caused by the post-war economic boom. Consequently, the Pacific Islander population in New Zealand had grown to 45,000 by 1971, with a substantial number overstaying their visas. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, New Zealand's economy had declined due to several international developments: a decline in international wool prices in 1966, Britain joining the European Economic Community in 1973 which deprived NZ of a major market for dairy products, and the 1973 oil crisis. This economic downturn led to increased crime, unemployment and other social ailments, which disproportionately affected the Pacific Islander community.John Parker, 64‚Äì65 In response to these social problems, Prime Minister Kirk created a special police task force in Auckland in 1973 which was tasked with dealing with overstayers. Its powers also included the power to conduct random checks on suspected overstayers. Throughout 1974, the New Zealand Police conducted dawn raids against overstayers which sparked criticism from human rights groups and sections of the press. In response to public criticism, the Labour Immigration Minister Fraser Colman suspended the dawn raids until the government developed a \\"concerted plan.\\" In April 1974, Kirk also introduced a two-month amnesty period for overstayers to register themselves with the authorities and be granted a two-month visa extension. Kirk's change in policies were criticized by the mainstream press, which highlighted crimes and violence perpetrated by MƒÅori and Pacific Islanders.Melanie Anae, 227‚Äì30 In July 1974, the opposition National Party leader Muldoon promised to reduce immigration and to \\"get tough\\" on law and order issues if his party was elected as government. He criticized the Labour government's immigration policies for contributing to the economic recession and a housing shortage. During the 1975 general elections, the National Party also played a controversial electoral advertisement that was later criticized for stoking negative racial sentiments about Polynesian migrants. Once in power, Muldoon's government accelerated the Kirk government's police raids against Pacific overstayers. The Dawn Raids were condemned by different sections of New Zealand society including the Pacific Islander and MƒÅori communities, church groups, employers and workers' unions, anti-racist groups, and the opposition Labour Party. One Pacific group known as the Polynesian Panthers combated the Dawn Raids by providing legal aid to detainees and staging retaliatory \\"dawn raids\\" on several National cabinet ministers including Bill Birch and Frank Gill, the Minister of Immigration. The raids were also criticized by elements of the police and the ruling National Party for damaging race relations with the Pacific Island community.Melanie Anae, 234‚Äì36 Critics also alleged that the Dawn Raids unfairly targeted Pacific Islanders since Pacific Islanders only comprised one-third of the overstayers but made up 86% of those arrested and prosecuted for overstaying. The majority of overstayers were from Great Britain, Australia, and South Africa. The Muldoon government's treatment of overstayers also damaged relations with Pacific countries like Samoa and Tonga, and generated criticism from the South Pacific Forum. By 1979, the Muldoon government terminated the Dawn Raids since the deportation of illegal Pacific overstayers had failed to alleviate the ailing New Zealand economy. =United Kingdom= England And Wales =Politicians= * Ruth Turner In January 2007 Ruth Turner was arrested in a dawn raid as part of the investigation into the Cash for Peerages affair. Senior Labour politicians criticised the move; but their concern about this has been contrasted by their lack of concern at other dawn raids.Dawn Raids Okay for Children but not Labour Aides =Asylum-seekers= *Manuelo Bravo In September 2005, Manuelo Bravo took his own life following a dawn raid. He and his son (13) were detained in Yarl's Wood Immigration Removal Centre where he had been threatened with deportation to Angola, where he feared his life was in danger as other family members had been killed there. Scotland =Asylum-seekers= Dawn raids have become a regular feature in the arrest of asylum seekers in Scotland. These have caused a great deal of controversy and pressure has been brought to bear on the Scottish Executive to end the practise. Several support groups have been set up to oppose the practice of dawn raids, including the Glasgow Girls, the UNITY centre in Ibrox and No Border Network which campaigns under the slogan of \\"No one is illegal\\". There has been speculation that the practice may be coming to an endDawn raids on asylum seekers may be scrapped for asylum seekers following criticisms from a wide range of people. On 1 February 2007 the deputy First Minister, Nichol Stephen condemned the practise of dawn raids describing them as \\"unacceptable and unnecessary.\\" Some have speculated that this is part of a wider change in tactics on the issue of asylum, moving away from dawn raiding asylum seekers, to detaining families at reporting centres;After dawn raids‚Ä¶ the new scandal however, dawn raids have continued. *Ay family In 2002, Yurdugal Ay and her children were suddenly removed from their home by immigration officials and taken to Dungavel detention centre in South Lanarkshire, Scotland.

Dawn raids are a tactic often used by law enforcement agencies in the United States. High-profile dawn raids include: *the 22 April 2000, apprehension of Eli√°n Gonzalez by a Border Patrol BORTAC team in Florida. *the arrest of Rod Blagojevich on corruption charges *the 2006 Swift raids at six meatpacking plants, leading to 1300 arrests and many deportations =The Netherlands= During the Nazi occupation of The Netherlands during World War II, the Nazis carried out numerous raids. The largest and most infamous is the Raid of Rotterdam on 10 and 11 November 1944, in which 52,000 men between the ages of 17 and 40 (some 80% of all men) from Rotterdam and the neighboring Schiedam were rounded up and put on transport to labor camps.

Pre-dawn raids usually occur during the early morning (usually between one and four o'clock), when most people are asleep. The police make a sudden entry into the premises or remain quiet to keep the element of surprise. Police often can catch their targets sleeping or unprepared, giving them the upper hand.

Fournet was born in Rouen in 1913. His father was a flutist who gave him some instruction on the flute and music theory. Fournet was then trained at the Conservatoire de Paris in flute by Gaston Blanquart and Marcel Moyse, and conducting by Philippe Gaubert (himself a flutist). He performed on the flute at age fifteen with the Orchestra of the Th√©√¢tre des Arts in Rouen. He first established himself as a conductor in his native country conducting in Rouen 1936-1940, Marseilles 1940-1944, and then as director of the Paris Op√©ra-Comique 1944-1957. He was also a professor of conducting at the √âcole Normale de Musique de Paris 1944-1962. In 1949, and again in 1950, he was guest conductor with the Radio √âireann Symphony Orchestra. His debut with the Concertgebouw Orchestra was in 1950. The Netherlands became Fournet‚Äôs second home. He became principal guest conductor of the Netherlands Radio Philharmonic Orchestra in Hilversum 1961-1968, where he also taught conducting. He married Miriam-Hannecart Jakes, an American who performed the Cor anglais with the Netherlands Radio Philharmonic Orchestra from 1977. He served as music director of the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra 1968-1973, and the newly created Orchestre National de l‚Äô√éle de France 1973-1982. He was the conductor of the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra 1983-1986 (he was given the title Honorary Conductor in 1989, and on his death in 2008 he was honored again with the title Permanent Honorary Conductor). His debut with the Lyric Opera of Chicago was in 1965 with a double bill of Carmina Burana and L'heure espagnole, and his debut with the Metropolitan Opera in New York was on March 28, 1987 where he conducted Samson et Dalila. Fournet was also president of the jury of the Besan√ßon International Conductor's Competition for many years. He proved a welcome addition to opera companies in America, where the French style had become something of a lost art. Beyond stage work, he proved, both early and late, a persuasive interpreter of the French symphonic literature. He was known as a gentle perfectionist, rarely raising his voice in rehearsal. Jean Fournet's career extended over an extraordinarily long period. His final concert was conducted in January 2005, at age 91, with the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra. Following that concert he retired to his home in Weesp near Hilversum in the Netherlands, where he died in 2008, aged 95.

It was first published in the July 1939 issue of Astounding Science Fiction and was reprinted in Great Science Fiction Stories About the Moon (1967) and The Early Asimov (1972). \\"Trends\\" was the tenth story written by Asimov, the third to be published, and the first to appear in Astounding, then the leading science fiction magazine.The Early Asimov, Book One, Isaac Asimov, 1972, p. 301. Origins The story had its genesis in research Asimov was conducting on behalf of an academic writing a book on social resistance to technological change. Asimov was particularly struck by a series of articles by Simon Newcomb from the early 20th century arguing that heavier-than-air flight was physically impossible. If there had been resistance to earlier technological change, then Asimov reasoned that there might be social resistance to spaceflight, which was a notion he had never encountered before in a science fiction story. In December 1938, Asimov wrote a story, which he originally titled \\"Ad Astra\\", that included resistance to a proposed flight to the Moon, submitting it to Astounding editor John W. Campbell on December 21, 1938. On December 29, 1938 Asimov received a letter from Campbell asking for a story conference. At the conference, Campbell said that he had never read a story that included resistance to space flight, that he liked the idea, and wanted Asimov to rewrite \\"Ad Astra\\" to make it central to the story. Asimov brought the revised version to Campbell on January 24, 1939, and Campbell accepted it, publishing it under the title \\"Trends\\". Plot summary Trends is narrated by Clifford McKenny, looking back from the year 2008, who tells how his boss John Harman was preparing to fly a rocket, the Prometheus, to the Moon in 1973. On July 14, 1973, the day before the scheduled flight, a newspaper called the Clarion denounces Harman as an impious blasphemer for daring to profane the heavens with his rocket ship, and warns that if the government won't stop him, \\"our enraged citizenry may have to take matters into their own hands\\". The head of the research institute Harman works for tries to dissuade him, arguing that popular opposition to his work is too strong. Harman refuses to listen. On the day of the flight, after Harman enters the Prometheus and prepares to launch it, it explodes, killing 28 members of a mostly hostile crowd led by a powerful evangelist named Otis Eldredge. McKenny learns that his coworker Shelton, an Eldredge follower, sabotaged the rocket. The next day, a mob led by an injured Eldredge converges on the hospital where Harman is recuperating, and is barely kept from lynching him. Within a week, a bill passes Congress making rocket experiments a capital crime, and it becomes clear to McKenny that Harman will not be allowed to leave the hospital. He smuggles Harman out and takes him to his uncle's farm in Minnesota. Within six months, Harman is preparing to try again. McKenny is sent to Chicago to collect the remainder of Harman's personal fortune, and to recruit a handful of trusted engineers. Over the next five years, Harman oversees the construction of the New Prometheus. At the same time, Eldredge's followers gain control of Congress, which establishes the Federal Scientific Research Investigatory Bureau to scrutinize and control all scientific research. Eldredge's death in 1976 does not deter his followers, who continue to restrict scientific research. On March 25, 1978, the FSRIB issues the Easter Edict, forbidding all independent scientific research. A month later, Harman launches the New Prometheus and succeeds in making a free return trajectory around the Moon. Harman lands across the Potomac from Washington, D.C. and before collapsing announces that he has been to the Moon. The news of Harman's feat, combined with Eldredge's absence and growing popular discontent at the extreme policies of the FSRIB, causes a reaction against antiscientism, and Harman is acclaimed as a hero. Notes Asimov named the narrator after fellow writer Clifford D. Simak. He cited \\"Trends\\" as an example of a successful prediction of the future in a science fiction story. Even though he got the details of the flight itself wrong, Asimov said, he was correct in predicting that there would be popular opposition to a flight to the Moon, and was the first to do so. The story, written two months after the Munich Crisis, mentions a Second World War in 1940. He later wrote that he did not believe Neville Chamberlain's prediction of \\"Peace for our time\\": \\"I estimated that there would be war in a year and a half, and again I was too conservative\\".

Early life  Most of her early work focused on human rights violations against refugees, especially in Sudan, Turkey, and Iran, and she has actively campaigned against sharia law. Namazie became well known in the mid-2000s for her pro-secularism positions and her critique of the treatment of women under Islamic regimes. In 2015, her lectures were opposed by groups labeling her as too provocative. Namazie is the spokesperson for Iran Solidarity, One Law for All, and the Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain and is a patron of the Association of Black Humanists. Namazie is an honorary associate of the National Secular Society. National Secular Society. Retrieved 5 June 2019 Namazie was born in Tehran, but left with her family in 1980 after the 1979 revolution in Iran. She has subsequently lived in India, the United Kingdom, and the United States, where she began her studies at the age of 17.. Career = Refugee work = Namazie first worked with Ethiopian refugees in Sudan. During the Islamic Revolution in that country, her clandestine organisation in defence of human rights, Human Rights Without Frontiers, was discovered and prohibited. Back in the United States in 1991 she became the co-founder of the Committee for Humanitarian Assistance to Iranian Refugees (CHAIR). In 1994 she worked in Iranian refugee camps in Turkey and produced a film about their situation. Namazie was then elected Executive Director of the International Federation of Iranian Refugees with branches in more than twenty countries. She has led several campaigns, especially against human rights violations of refugees in Turkey, and is involved with the International Committee against Stoning. Namazie is also a spokesman for Equal Rights Now - Organisation Against Women's Discrimination in Iran, that serves to defend women's rights and the struggle against \\"sexual apartheid\\" in Iran.Equal Rights Now ‚Äì Contact Us Namazie has also broadcast programmes via satellite television in English: TV International. = Secularism = Namazie has not limited her activism for secularism to her country of birth: she has also campaigned in Canada and Britain, where she currently lives. In numerous articles and public statements she has challenged cultural relativism and political Islam. These activities were recognised by the National Secular Society with the 2005 Secularist of the Year award, making Namazie its first recipient. During the Danish cartoon riots, she was one of the twelve signatories of Manifesto: Together Facing the New Totalitarianism together with Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Shahla Chafiq, Caroline Fourest, Bernard-Henri L√©vy, Irshad Manji, Mehdi Mozaffari, Taslima Nasreen, Salman Rushdie, Antoine Sfeir, Philippe Val, and Ibn Warraq. The manifesto begins thus: \\"After having overcome fascism, Nazism, and Stalinism, the world now faces a new totalitarian global threat: Islamism.\\" Namazie said in a 2006 interview that the response by the public \\"has been overwhelming. Many feel such a manifesto is extremely timely whilst of course there is the usual hate mail from Islamists.\\" Namazie has denounced the discrimination women have to endure under the Islamic regime: \\"From the very fact that you are a second- class citizen, even your testimony legally is worth half that of a man's, you get half what a boy does in inheritance if you are a girl. You have to be veiled if you're a girl or a woman, and there are certain fields of education or work that are closed to you because you're considered emotional.\\" She compares women's situation under Islamic regimes today to the social inequalities under apartheid in South Africa, and she cites as examples the existence of separate entrances for women into government offices and the separation of men and women on swimming areas in the Caspian Sea by a curtain. After Mina Ahadi launched the Central Council of Ex-Muslims in Germany in January 2007, Namazie became the co-founder of the Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain (CEMB) in June, and was involved in the founding of the Dutch branch in September: the Central Committee for Ex-Muslims, an initiative of Ehsan Jami. The representatives of the three ex-Muslim councils signed a \\"European Declaration of Tolerance\\". The rise of ex-Muslim organisations have been described by MEP Sophie in 't Veld as a \\"new Renaissance\\"; Namazie herself compared the breaking of taboos and the 'coming out' of Muslim apostates with the emancipation of homosexuals. In February 2008, Namazie and Ahadi were selected among of the top 45 \\"Women of the Year 2007\\" by Elle Quebec for their role in the foundation of the ex-Muslim councils. Though the Dutch Committee for Ex-Muslims was dissolved in 2008, its British and German counterparts were reinforced with a French branch: by the initiative of Waleed Al-Husseini the Council of Ex-Muslims of France was founded on 6 July 2013, in which Namazie was again involved. Namazie was named in Victims of Intimidation: Freedom of Speech within Europe's Muslim Communities, a late 2008 report about 27 European public figures with an Islamic background that have been made the focus of terrorist attention on the basis of what they have said about issues such Islam, homosexuality or religious experience. Since 1982, there has been an Islamic Sharia Council in the United Kingdom, and Islamic sharia courts are allowed to adjudicate in familial matters (marriage, divorce, inheritance, custody of children) according to the Arbitration Act 1996. Namazie campaigns against these issues under the name One law for all. She deems sharia law is discriminatory and unjust, especially against women and children: \\"Rights and justice are meant for people, not for religions and cultures\\", said Namazie. The action was launched on 10 December 2008 during the 60th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Namazie has also spoken against cultural relativism in regards to human rights and equality, denouncing the fact that Western propaganda disregards violations of human rights and the oppression of women in countries ruled by Islamists, under the excuse that these actions are part of the culture of the countries where they occur. She has also pointed out that she believes the greatest opponents of sharia law and Islamism are precisely people who have lived under its rule, and that no one should have lesser rights for having been born in the place where they were born. On 15 September 2010, Namazie, along with 54 other public figures, signed an open letter published in The Guardian, stating their opposition to Pope Benedict XVI's state visit to the UK. Namazie opening the 2014 Secular Conference in London. Namazie was keynote speaker at the World Atheist Convention 2011 in Dublin, where she stated that there is currently an \\"Islamic Inquisition\\" going on; that labeling people and countries as being first and foremost 'Islamic' or 'Muslim' denies the diversity of individuals and societies and gives Islamists more influence; that human rights are not 'Western' but universal; and that the word \\"Islamophobia\\" is wrong because it is not a form of racism, because fear of Islam and opposition against it is not unfounded, but even necessary. A similar speech she made in Salt Lake City at the 2014 American Atheists National Convention opposed the wearing of the veil. After the gesture of the Egyptian blogger Aliaa Magda Elmahdy, who posted nude pictures of herself to provoke the Islamists, Namazie launched a calendar with pictures of naked female activists in February 2012, with among others the Ukrainian Alena Magela of the FEMEN group. Namazie said: \\"\\"Islamists and the right conservatives are obsessed with women's bodies. They want to silence us, to make us go veiled and chained through life. Nudity breaks taboos, and is an important means of resistance.\\" She called Ehmaldy's deed \\"a scream against Islamism\\" and \\"the ultimate act of rebellion\\". Namazie emphasizes the difference between 'normal' Muslims on the one hand, who support human rights activists like Malala Yousafzai, and Islamists on the other, who are dangerous because they form repressive political movements that have seized power in some countries. She argues that globally, the Christian Right is less successful in repressing women's rights than Islamist movements. Maryam Namazie is also the spokesman of Fitnah- Movement for Women's Liberation, a protest movement which is, according to their website, \\"demanding freedom, equality, and secularism and calling for an end to misogynist cultural, religious, and moral laws and customs, compulsory veiling, sex apartheid, sex trafficking, and violence against women.\\" According to Namazie, the name of the movement comes from a hadith, or a saying from Islamic prophet Muhammad, which in her opinion portrays women as a source of harm and affliction. She explains that even though the term is generally perceived as negative, the fact that women who are called fitnah are those who \\"are disobedient, who transgress the norms, who refuse, who resist, who revolt, who won't submit\\" makes it suited for a women's liberation movement. She has explained that the creation of the movement was sparked by contemporary movements and revolutions around the world, especially those in the Middle East and North Africa, although she emphasizes Fitnah has global relevance. Namazie on celebrating apostasy and blasphemy, opening the International Conference on Free Expression and Conscience 2017 In September 2015, the students' union of Warwick University briefly banned her from a forthcoming talk on campus organised by the Warwick Atheists, Secularists and Humanists' Society because of a fear that she might \\"incite hatred\\" of the university's Muslim students. In an interview with the Coventry Telegraph Simon Gilbert, she was quoted as saying: \\"It angers me that we're all put in a little box and that anyone who criticises Islam is labelled racist. It's not racist, it's a fundamental right. ... The Islamic movement is a movement that slaughters people in the Middle East and Africa. It's important for us to speak about it and criticise it.\\" The ban was lifted after a few days. In December 2015, she gave a talk about blasphemy at the Goldsmiths University in London, sponsored by the university's Atheist, Secularist and Humanist society. During her talk, members of the university's Islamic Society caused a disruption by heckling and switching off her PowerPoint presentation when Namazie displayed a cartoon from the series Jesus and Mo. Namazie asked for the disruptive students to be removed, but security refused to do so. Some of the students were alleged to have issued death threats at Namazie and another lecturer. In response to the incident, the university's Feminist Society released a statement on Tumblr, expressing support for the Islamic Society, and condemning the Atheist, Secularist and Humanist Society for hosting \\"known Islamophobes\\" to speak at the university. Namazie is patron of London Black Atheists and Pink Triangle Trust. = Politics = Namazie at the eighth WPI Congress Maryam Namazie used to be a Central Committee member of the Worker- communist Party of Iran, as editor for the Worker-communist Review. She advocated ideas inspired by Workerist Communism, especially those of the Iranian theorist Mansoor Hekmat. Maryam Namazie and Fariborz Pooya resigned from membership of the Worker-communist Party of Iran on 1 January 2009. Central Committee secretary Hamid Takhvai regretfully accepted their resignation, saying the party would 'continue to support [their] social activities and campaigns against political Islam', and expressed hope that Namazie and Pooya would continue to work on the new Bread and Roses programme. Namazie strongly distances herself from far-right anti-Islamic groups, whom she does not regard as allies, but enemies as well., Enemies Not Allies: The Far-Right (2011). One Law For All. At the World Atheist Conference in Dublin in 2011, referring to the far-right, she said \\"they are like the Islamists\\" and that Muslims need equal protection under the law, while she stressed the need to be able to criticize religion. She strongly condemned the far-right movements after the terrorist attacks on mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, which took away 50 victims' lives, stating that \\"We stand with Muslims everywhere who face discrimination, violence and terror\\".

The island is small, measuring 1 km in length and 400 m at its widest point. The highest point on the island is 51 metres above sea level. There are two tourist resorts on the island: the original resort at the southern end and a newer resort at the north-eastern end. The original resort caters to day visitors and the newer resort, which opened in 1990, caters to overnight guests. Tourists from the mainland port of Abel Point Marina regularly visit the island. It is owned by China Capital Investment Group as of March 2015. History Named West Molle Island in 1881, the present name \\"Daydream\\" came into use during the 1930s when Lee (Paddy), his wife Connie Murray and their best friend Charlie Hird established the first tourist resort on the island. Day Dream was the name of a yacht owned by the Murrays. Ownership of the resort has transferred to a number of individuals or groups since the 1930s. Notable owners include Reg Ansett, who dismantled the resort in 1953 and shipped the buildings to his new resort on Hayman Island; and Bernie Elsey, whose massive redevelopment of the island in 1967 was destroyed by Cyclone Ada three years later. The resort was previously owned by Vaughan Bullivant.What a day for Daydream theage.com.au. The name West Molle Island was officially discontinued in 1989. Attractions Resort pool area by night, 2005 Daydream Island is a mecca for sailing enthusiasts. It has an outdoor aquarium, with sea life from the Great Barrier Reef. The aquarium has about 80 different types of sea life and about 50 different corals. Wallabies roam around outside the resort by the beach. It is a short ferry ride from Great Barrier Reef airport on Hamilton Island to Daydream Island, and also just minutes away by boat to Airlie Beach. Activities like snorkeling, sail-boarding, jet-skiing, parasailing, coral viewing, scuba diving, volleyball, tennis, and badminton are popular.  Redevelopment  On 25 January 2017 Daydream Island announced a $50 million renovation. The island will close in February 2018 with the Fish Bowl, Bake House and Shops on the southern end closing in February 2017 for renovations to the lagoon outside the Fish Bowl.  Cyclone Debbie  Daydream island was significantly damaged by Cyclone Debbie in 2017, with the main jetty being washed away, Lovers Cove deck destroyed, the roof of the day spa ripped off, and power, water and telecommunications lost. Evacuation was completed with the assistance of Cruise Whitsundays and the Royal Australian Navy. The schedule for previously- planned renovations was accelerated as a result, with most repairs being completed as of 2019.

He was very much a legend in the film industry of Turkey with 119 movies directed. He also wrote 53 screenplays and produced 28 movies since 1951. He was active in almost every period of the Turkish film industry.  Early life  Atƒ±f Yƒ±lmaz was born on 9 December 1925 in Mersin, Turkey to a Kurdish family originally from Palu.Rejis√∂r Atƒ±f Yƒ±lmazhttps://www.evrensel.net/haber/222826/rejisor-atif- yilmaz After finishing high school in Mersin, he attended the Law School of Istanbul University. Because of his interest in arts, he dropped out of Law School and entered the Painting Department of the Academy of Fine Arts in Istanbul. After graduating from the Academy, he did some painting works in workshops. His education in painting helped him when he was directing his movies, as he once remarked.  Film career  In the beginning, he worked as a film critic, made paintings and wrote film scripts to earn a living. After co-directing two movies as an assistant director to Semih Evin in 1950, his directing career began with the film Kanlƒ± Feryat (The Bloody Cry). In 1960, he established his film company \\"Yerli Film\\" with the actor Orhan G√ºn≈üƒ±ray. The most important movies in his filmography were: Hƒ±√ßkƒ±rƒ±k (The Sob), Alageyik (The Fallow Deer), Su√ßlu (The Guilty One), Seni Kaybedersem (If I Lose You), Yaban G√ºl√º (The Wild Rose), Ke≈üanlƒ± Ali Destanƒ± (Kesanli Ali's Epic), Ta√ßsƒ±z Kral (The Crownless King), Topraƒüƒ±n Kanƒ± (Blood of the Earth), √ñl√ºm Tarlasƒ± (Death Field), Utan√ß (The Shame), Zavallƒ±lar (The Poor People), Selvi Boylum, Al Yazmalƒ±m (My Girl with the Red Scarf), Baskin (The Raid), Adak (The Sacrifice), Bir Yudum Sevgi (A Sip of Love), Adƒ± Vasfiye (Her Name is Vasfiye), Berdel, D√º≈ü Gezginleri (Walking After Midnight), Eyl√ºl Fƒ±rtƒ±nasƒ± (After the Fall) and Mine. He made movies that were both fluent and had mainly social messages. Most of the themes of his movies were taboo when they were produced. Particularly \\"Mine\\" and \\"Her Name is Vasfiye\\" were both revolutionary at the time of their release with themes regarding sexuality and the reaction of society. He never gave up making movies throughout his life and even in the time when the industry stopped filmmaking due to economic reasons. Atƒ±f Yƒ±lmaz played an important role in the professional career of notable Turkish film directors like Halit Refiƒü, Yƒ±lmaz G√ºney, ≈ûerif G√∂ren, Zeki √ñkten and Ali √ñzgent√ºrk. During the Antalya Film Festival in September 2005, he was admitted to hospital with gastro-intestinal complaints. He died on 5 May 2006 in Istanbul.

It is a popular tourist destination and a noted surf break. Lagundri Bay surf break The main break in Lagundri Bay, often also called \\"The Point,\\" \\"Soraki Point,\\" or simply \\"Nias,\\" is a barrelling right-hander breaking over reef along the western side of the bay. The correct name of the point where the wave breaks is \\"Soraki\\" (which apparently means \\"many reefs\\"). A break further out along the bay is called Indicators, which breaks dangerously onto dry reef and is surfed only on rare occasions. On the opposite side of the bay, a left-hander called The Machine breaks sometimes, but needs a very high tide and large swells. \\"Kiddies Corner\\" is the name of the inside section of the wave at \\"the Point.\\" All the waves have been affected by recent uplift from the 2005 Nias‚ÄìSimeulue earthquake. = Start as surf location = The surf break was discovered in 1975 by travelling Australian surfers Kevin Lovett and John Giesel. Accompanying them to the bay on 18 June 1975 when they first surfed it were Peter Troy and Wendy Adcock of Australia, New Zealander Michael Day and Australian Patrick Waite. Lovett and Giesel, aged 20 and 22, were travelling through south-east Asia, living rough and pursuing the surfer's dream of perfect uncrowded waves. They were drawn to Nias by a map they saw in a chieftain's house in North Sumatra. On their final sea leg to the island they found legendary surf traveller Peter Troy and his partner Wendy Adcock. Michael Day, 25, a former surfer, and Patrick Waite were travelling in Indonesia and just happened to arrive at the time of the discovery. On the island and after traveling 15 km through jungle they finally reached the bay and were greeted by, as Lovett put it, \\"Relentless sets of smokin' 6-to-8 foot almond-eyed waves\\". (That's 6 to 8 Hawaiian scale.) Those who surfed it for the first time were Kevin Lovett, John Giesel and Peter Troy. Michael Day, who swam in the break, could speak Indonesian and, at the request of Lovett and Giesel, asked a local to build a shack for them, and he agreed. That was the beginning of the surf village now there. Lovett and Giesel lived there for 3 months surfing it alone. Giesel and Lovett, and the others who were with them at the time of the discovery, made a pact to keep the place secret, but word leaked out over the years. Giesel never got to enjoy Lagundri again, he suffered repeated bouts of malaria he'd contracted on their travels and died of pneumonia just 7 months later. Lovett maintained his connection with the place, returning many times and getting involved with helping the local people. In around 1995 he learnt from the local siulu (chief and head magician) that the two had actually been in considerable danger from headhunting, which still went on back in 1975. New Yorker writer William Finnegan surfed Nias in 1979 and wrote about it in his 2015 memoir Barbarian Days.William Finnegan, Barbarian Days: A Surfing Life. Penguin, 2015. = 2005 Nias‚ÄìSimeulue earthquake = The 2005 Nias‚ÄìSimeulue earthquake (28 May 2005) devastated the local village, and caused an uplift up to several metres over much of the island, with some eastern parts of island also reported to have sunk several feet or more in places. A number of structures both within the local village and throughout the island were toppled (with reportedly several thousand deaths, particularly in the north of the island), and a small tsunami also occurred, apparently up to the height of door frames on the first floor at Lagundri Bay, which also caused damage to houses and hotels within the bay. Locals report that the tsunami arrived about 15‚Äì20 minutes after the earthquake. A number of people in the local village lost their goods and livelihoods from this earthquake and tsunami. The uplift seems to have been part of a regular cycle of megathrusts followed by gradual sinking. On this occasion the uplift was about 2 feet within the Bay itself, and it has actually improved the main surf break, but reduced the quality of the others. Where previously The Point only broke from about 4 foot and up (Hawaiian scale) it now breaks from 2 foot and the main section of the tube has lengthened from 7 seconds to perhaps 9 in good conditions, with a second tube section a little further down from the main part of the wave on occasions. On the other side of the bay however The Machine has suffered, needing an even more fickle combination of large swell and higher tides to be surfable. = Characteristics = The wave characteristics of \\"the Point\\" have long been considered world-class, and include: a remarkably easy paddle out; a machine- like, jacking, perfect almond-shaped tube (particularly when >4 feet) and which has reportedly held waves up to 15 feet (Hawaiian scale-that's ~30 feet wave faces) since the earthquake; and a sculptured wave face which is partially smoothed out by a weak 'reverse current'- which sucks water from the bay into the wave and acts to 'smooths out' the breaking wave face, even under light onshore wind conditions. The wave jacks and pitches quickly out of relatively deep water, and has surprising energy and roundness over about 4 feet (Hawaiian scale), particularly since the earthquake, also breaking in relatively deep water (at least for the roundness of the barrel) on all tides. The world-class section of the wave only breaks for about 60-80m, before it dies out in deeper water, afterwards forming a slow moving, low-quality wave which breaks for around another 100m or so (\\"Kiddies Corner\\"). The water within the surrounding bay has a sharp and remarkably deep drop-off, and it is likely the peculiar, long and narrow U-shape of the bay acts to focus the incoming swell energy onto the main part of the point, to produce both the weak 'reverse current', and the consistently almond-shaped tubes. Other Nias Island surf breaks There are other waves both to the west and east of Lagundri Bay, which have been variably affected by uplift from the earthquake. A medium quality left-hander breaks about 2 hours walk west from the main point, called locally \\"the Shark Hole,\\" and another very dubious right-hander breaks about 15 minutes walk to the west of the main point. There are waves to the north along the west coast of Nias island, one of which, \\"Afulu,\\" has apparently been severely affected and reduced in quality by recent uplift.

Nefret is introduced in The Last Camel Died at Noon, in which the Emersons set off into the Sudan, to find out whether Willy Forth, an old acquaintance of Emerson, is still alive after setting out years earlier, with his pregnant wife in tow, to find a mysterious hidden oasis. After being stranded in the desert without water, transportation or guides, they are rescued by one of their servants, who leads them to a lost civilization in a far-off valley. The settlement seems to have developed from a lost tribe of Cush and preserves many of the customs and lore that Amelia and Emerson have only read about. In the midst of a power struggle between two brothers and claimants to the throne ‚Äì one good and one evil ‚Äì the Emersons find that Willy Forth and his wife did make it to this land, and that they left a daughter, raised entirely within the culture of ancient Egypt, and now thirteen years old. Willy Forth is dead, but to their astonishment they find his wife also sheltered by the inhabitants, demented and obese. The good brother ascends the throne, and decides it is best for Nefret to return with the Emersons. Nefret's last surviving relative is her grandfather, Lord Blacktower. Knowing the old man's reputation for depravity, the Emersons convince him to let them adopt Nefret. (Emerson even darkly speculates that it was the old man, not Willy Forth, who fathered Nefret with his own daughter- in-law, though he has no proof.) Eventually, Lord Blacktower dies and leaves her a large fortune. She decides to do her best to learn about and live with English culture, but (to Amelia's secret satisfaction), she stands out as an independent, intelligent, bold and (to Amelia's dismay) mischievous woman. Ramses Emerson, meanwhile, is smitten with Nefret from the moment he sees her, which evolves into a mature love over the course of several stories. After some monumental misunderstandings between them, he and Nefret are finally married after the events of He Shall Thunder in the Sky. Thanks to her fortune, Nefret goes to medical school, becomes a surgeon, and opens a clinic in Cairo for prostitutes and poor women. Ramses and Nefret have two children, twins Charlotte (\\"Charla\\") and David John, and at the end of Tomb of the Golden Bird it is revealed that Nefret is pregnant again. In the Vicky Bliss series' final installment, The Laughter of Dead Kings, it is revealed that main character John Tregarth is the descendant of the youngest of Ramses and Nefret's three children, an as-yet unnamed daughter. It is also mentioned that the children \\"bred like rabbits,\\" and that at the time of Dead Kings, over eighty people are descended from Ramses and Nefret's offspring. Nefret is described as slim, with red-gold hair and a beautiful (though untrained) singing voice. She is adept with knife, bow, and medical kit.

This film was Lewis's film producing and screenwriting debut. Plot Sidney L. Pythias (Jerry Lewis), a janitor, is mistaken for a gang member and arrested along with three so-called \\"juvenile delinquents,\\" Artie, Monk, and Harry. Police officer Mike Damon (Darren McGavin) believes he can help a wayward youth just as a cop once did for him. He is given a month by Captain Riley (Horace McMahon) to set a boy right, provided he allow socialite and civic do-gooder Martha Henshaw (Martha Hyer) assist him in the effort. Sidney's secret ambition is to be a policeman. He also wants to impress Patricia, a student nurse who lives in his building, by making something of himself. Mike and Martha bicker while working with Sidney, who is permitted to attend the police academy, over the objections of his \\"friends\\" Artie, Monk and Harry. Artie is accidentally shot by a gun in Sidney's possession, endangering his future with the police force, but it turns out Monk is responsible. Cleared of all blame, Sidney becomes a cop, determined to set a good example for youths like himself, while Mike and Martha fall in love.

After it came out that Roberts was underage, Hefner was brought before a domestic relations court on a charge of contributing to the delinquency of a minor.\\"The Naked Truth.\\" Time, February 3, 1958. Retrieved from \\"The Press: The Naked Truth\\". Time. February 3, 1958.Standish, David. \\"The Illustrated History of Playboy\\". Playboy, January 1979, p. 288. The charges were ultimately dropped on the grounds that Hefner in all likelihood did not know the girl's true age. Roberts eventually became a Bunny at the Chicago Playboy Club.

It has an undergraduate population of about 6,300 students. The college offers more than 100 degrees and certificate programs.http://www.sfcc.edu/about_SFCC/degrees_and_certificates SFCC's Higher Education Center offers televised and online connections to bachelor and masters programs at the University of New Mexico, New Mexico Highlands University and the Institute of American Indian Art. Campus The Santa Fe Community College Campus occupies of land, about southwest of Santa Fe city center. The Santa Fe Community College District is identical to the Santa Fe Public School District, which covers most of Santa Fe County and includes the outlying areas of Glorieta, Madrid, Cerrillos, Lamy, La Cienega, Galisteo and Tesuque. SFCC campus has made a number of ecological improvements, such as a biomass boiler for heating, LEED Gold certification for two buildings, and treated grey water irrigation for most landscaping and recreation areas. History In early 1983, the New Mexico State Legislature approved a bill to provide 1.5 million dollars to fund the creation of a community college in Santa Fe. In September the program began offering classes in temporary facilities at several sites around town, including the New Mexico School for the Deaf, Santa Fe High School, the Institute of American Indian Arts and the College of Santa Fe. Construction began on a permanent facility in 1984, funded by a 5 million dollar bond and donations. A fitness building was added in 1993, a technology and occupation lab was added in 1995, an early childhood development center in 1996, and a fine arts center in 1999. In 2001 an instructional technology center was added, while in 2005 a sustainability program was begun. in 2007 a bond for $25 million funded the addition of a health and sciences building, which was begun in 2009, as well as a trades and technology center, which was opened in 2011. In March 2014 the college settled with fired president Ana M. (Cha) Guzm√°n for $500,000 for wrongful dismissal.Santa Fe Community College to Pay Its Fired President $500,000 in Settlement In July 2019, the college hired Dr. Becky Rowley as its ninth president. Dr. Rowley worked as president of Clovis Community College in Clovis, New Mexico since 2011. Prior to becoming president, she was Executive Vice President (Academics and Student Services) at CCC. Before moving into administration, she taught English as a fulltime faculty member at Clovis Community College for seven years.Board picks Clovis native as Santa Fe Community College president Higher Education Center The Santa Fe Higher Education Center was developed after a needs assessment survey showed that Santa Fe residents were interested in pursuing a bachelor‚Äôs or master's degree but were concerned about cost and commuting. Through the HEC, Santa Fe residents can earn bachelor‚Äôs or master's degrees from the University of New Mexico, located in Albuquerque; NM Highlands University, located in Las Vegas, NM; and the Institute of American Indian Art, located in Santa Fe, by attending online and instructional TV classes at Santa Fe Community College. They have coordinated existing resources from their institutions and have agreed to allow students to take basic coursework through SFCC before completing higher degrees through the HEC. About 500 students are enrolled in the program. =Development= In 2009, Santa Fe Community College submitted a proposal to the NM Higher Education Department to establish a Higher Education Center (HEC) after a survey showed that a majority of local residents questioned would seek a higher degree if it were located in the city. The Higher Education Department approved the proposal and the HEC was formally established. In 2010, SFCC District voters approved a bond measure, $12 million of which was earmarked to fund the construction of a facility for the HEC. In March 2011, the New Mexico Legislature passed House Joint Memorial 9, authorizing the state‚Äôs General Services Department to sell to the college a tract of land for the center‚Äôs building site. In July 2011, the Higher Education Department approved the land purchase, and the sale was finalized in September 2011. A pilot of the program began in August 2011 on the Santa Fe Community College campus. In November 2011, the College learned that the administration of Governor Susana Martinez, who was elected in November 2010, was of the opinion that the college had to gain further approval from the Legislature before the Higher Education Department would review construction plans for the center. A primary source of criticism has been concerns over long-term funding, as well as a possibly excessive number of higher education options in New Mexico. In May 2012, attorneys for Santa Fe Community College filed a legal action in district court requesting an order to force the New Mexico Higher Education Department (HED) to grant a hearing to review construction plans for the center. The Higher Education Center was opened in January, 2015.SFCC‚Äôs newly completed Higher Education Center is a city-center hub for learning References External links * Official website Category:1983 establishments in New Mexico Category:Buildings and structures in Santa Fe, New Mexico Category:Community colleges in New Mexico Category:Education in Santa Fe, New Mexico Category:Educational institutions established in 1983 ","title":"Santa Fe Community College"},{"id":"5054166","text":"The Midwest Military Simulation Association (MMSA) is a group of wargamers and military figurine collectors active during the late 1960s and 1970s. History When wargaming was in its heyday and role-playing games were first developed, the group lived in the Minneapolis-St Paul area. Its membership included Dave Arneson, David Wesely, Ken Fletcher, Dave Megarry, John and Richard Snider and others.Midwest Area Gaming Enthusiasts In 2006 Wesely described how the club began: > The Midwest Military Simulation Association was founded on April 18, 1963, > by Ray Allard, noted amateur historian and reenactor, now deceased. The > first meeting was attended by Dr. William Musing, Loren Johnson, Ron > Lauraunt and Winston Sandeen, Ray Allard Junior and David A. Wesely. Ray was > about 54 at the time, the next four were all about 30 and the last two were > teenagers. Besides age, the group was split by interest, with the five older > guys being historians, collectors, modelers and painters of military > miniatures, and the two youngest being wargamers. The older guys put up with > us, and Winston Sandeen even played in a few miniatures battles, partly > because we hung on their every word when they told war stories about WWII > and the Korean War.Wesely's Comments on the MMSA at acaeum.com The ranks were augmented by friends of the original members, and one of these friends, Don Nicholson, recruited new members by contacting people who had checked out \\"Strategos: A Game of War\\" by Charles Totten at the UM library. In this way Jim Clark and Greg Scott were recruited. The MMSA also found new wargamers by running welcome tables during fall registration at the UM and the University of St. Thomas, or by running ads in The General and Strategy & Tactics magazines. Dave Arneson joined when he was in high school. He produced a newsletter describing the group's Napoleonic and American Civil War games, as well as its play-by-mail Diplomacy games. In 1986, under the direction of Hal Thinglum, The Midwest Wargamers' Association Newsletter won the Charles S. Roberts Award as the best Best Amateur Wargaming Magazine. The younger members of the group began to meet at Arneson's house. More interested in wargaming than collecting or historical reenactment, these members played a critical role in the development of RPGs. Dave Wesely conducted what is considered to be the first role-playing game, set in Napoleonic Germany, in 1967. Arneson later developed a fantasy role-playing milieu called Blackmoor, and co-created Dungeons & Dragons with Gary Gygax in 1973. Dave Megarry conceived the idea of a dungeon crawl, and designed a board game around this idea called Dungeon!, published by TSR, Inc. in 1975. That same year TSR also published Star Probe by John Snider.

With It was built as an eight-story residential apartment hotel. In 1988 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  Description  The Knickerbocker's neighborhood was called Yankee Hill because many of Milwaukee's early leaders living there in the 1800s were Yankees from New England. They liked the neighborhood because it was close to the downtown and had nice views along Lake Michigan. It was also part of Milwaukee's \\"Gold Coast\\". By 1900 many of the prominent Yankees living there had been replaced by prominent German and Irish. After 1900 many of the big old single-family homes were divided into rooming houses, and some were razed to make space for apartment buildings and residential hotels. These allowed more middle and upper-class people to live at a prestigious address close to downtown without the cost or trouble of maintaining their own free-standing home. The Astor Hotel was one like this, built in 1916 and expanded in 1925. Very similar, the Knickerbocker was built just up Juneau Avenue in 1929. The Knickerbocker Hotel was designed by architects Rossman & Wierdsma of Milwaukee in late Neo- Classical Revival style, somewhat simplified as fashion shifted toward Art Deco and more modern styles. The building was generally U-shaped, eight stories tall. The exterior is reddish brick decorated with terra cotta. The first two floors are covered with terra cotta panels. The eighth floor is set off with a terra cotta cornice. The windows on that floor are surrounded by pilasters and window hoods decorated with wreaths and foliage. Inside, the first floor housed an elegant lobby and retail space. Above that each floor held about 30 apartments. For many years it was owned by the Kaiser family and known as the Kaiser Knickerbocker Hotel. The Knickerbocker on the Lake bills itself a boutique hotel, with suites decorated in styles varying from Victorian to French Country. The majority of the rooms are now owner-occupied. From 1994 to 2011, the hotel housed the Osterio del Mondo, which had been rated a top hotel restaurant by Zagat/USA Today.

He became the colony's first Inspector of Native Police, and helped to explore the Champion Bay district before becoming one of the district's pioneer pastoralists. Early years and background The fourth child of botanist James Drummond, John Drummond was born in County Cork in 1816. Among his brothers were James, who would become a Member of the Western Australian Legislative Council; and Johnston, who became a respected botanical collector. An uncle, Thomas, had accompanied Sir John Franklin in his explorations into the Northwest Territories of Canada in 1819‚Äì22. In 1829 the Drummond family emigrated to the Swan River Colony in what is now Western Australia, arriving on board the Parmelia on 1 June. John Drummond would have spent much of his youth helping with the family farm at Toodyay. As he grew older, he spent more and more time with the local indigenous Australians of the area, going on long hunting expeditions that took him away from home for many weeks at a time. In 1839 he caused a scandal in the colony when it became widely known that he had been \\"lent\\" a wife by the local tribe. Police career Late in 1839, a woman and her baby were murdered by natives near York, and Governor John Hutt responded by establishing a special police force known as the Native Police. As a man well known and widely respected by the local tribes, and familiar with indigenous language and customs, Drummond was appointed the colony's first Inspector of Native Police. He made regular patrols of the Avon Valley district, and continued to attend corroborees and tribal gatherings. He became a valued tracker and negotiator, and earned the respect of both colonists and natives. In 1845, Drummond's brother Johnston was murdered by a native named Kabinger. After obtaining a warrant, John Drummond set out to avenge his brother's murder. He tracked Kabinger for two weeks without success, before finding him at sundown on 15 August. According to the diary of Gerard de Courcy Lefroy: :\\"He pulled up his horse, which is rather a hot little beggar, and asked him why he murdered his brother... the awful ghastly look the scoundrel gave him nearly unnerved him for the moment... but when he saw the spear shifted... his horse plunging all the time he put his gun up and fired and drove the ball in his left side and out his right. He fell to the ground on his face and buried his teeth in the grounds and expired.... It was a beautiful shot ‚Äì fifty yards ‚Äì he never let his spears go.\\" Drummond reported Kabinger's death as having been done \\"in the execution of his duty while enforcing a warrant of arrest\\". Governor Hutt, who had already had a number of disputes with Drummond over his \\"independent attitude to officialdom\\", did not accept Drummond's version of events, and suspended him from the police force. However without Drummond's influence the natives caused the colonists of the district difficulties, so when Hutt returned to England at the end of the year, Drummond was immediately reappointed to the police at a lower rank. In 1849, Drummond accompanied an overland party to the Champion Bay district, where a small mining settlement was being formed. He helped to handle a number of delicate and dangerous standoffs with the local indigenous tribe, and his return to Toodyay was greatly regretted. On returning to Toodyay, Drummond found himself constantly quarrelling with the newly appointed Protector of the Natives at York, Walkinshaw Cowan, who accused him of leaving his district while on duty. These accusations were probably correct, as Drummond was courting Mary Eliza Shaw of Guildford at the time. In April 1850, a court of inquiry was held at York to enquire into Cowan's complaints against Drummond. The inquiry was eventually closed without any findings, and shortly afterwards the problem was solved by transferring Drummond to Champion Bay as First Constable of the newly established police force there. In 1850, Drummond acted as a police escort for a group of pastoralists including John Sydney Davis, Major Logue, William and Lockier Burges, Thomas and Kenneth Brown, and Drummond's brother James, in overlanding stock from York to Greenough. Later he accompanied an exploration party including Augustus Gregory, John Septimus Roe, James Drummond Jr and Samuel Pole Phillips, in exploring the land around the Upper Irwin. Pastoralist In 1851, Drummond acquired a block of 4000 acres of land next to the police reserve at what is now known as Drummond Cove. He named the property White Peak Station. Shortly afterwards he obtained a pastoral lease over of land in the area, adding the following year. In February 1852 he took leave, travelling to Guildford where he married Mary Eliza Shaw. They would have one daughter, who would die in infancy. A rich lode of copper ore was discovered on Drummond's pastoral lease in 1853, and Drummond purchased of his lease to secure the mining rights. He then placed management of the mine in the hands of George Shenton, who appointed Joseph Horrocks superintendent. The Gwalla mine ultimately became part of the town of Northampton. By 1857, Drummond had been promoted to Sub-Inspector of Police at Champion Bay, and owned valuable pastoral and mining interests in the area. That year, he was ordered to take charge of the police force at Albany, around away. Unwilling to abandon his other interests, he resigned from the police force, thereafter focussing on his pastoral and agricultural interests. In 1876, the Drummonds took in the orphaned child of Kenneth Brown (Rose, born 1874), who had been hanged for murdering his second wife. In 1881, White Peak Station was sold to Edward Wittenoom. Criminal conviction and death In 1877 Drummond was charged with wounding with intent to murder tenant farmer John Fisher at Redcliffe Farm, near Geraldton. He was found guilty of shooting Fisher with intent to do him grievous bodily harm, and sentenced to three years' penal servitude. In 1895, at the age of 79, he was charged with stealing sheep from his neighbor Edward Wittenoom ‚Äì a charge of \\"feloniously killing three or more sheep, with intent to feloniously steal the carcases of the said sheep\\". A jury returned a not guilty verdict. Drummond died at Seaview Cottage, Drummond Cove, in 1906. He was the third-last surviving colonist to arrive on the Parmelia, the others remaining being his sister Euphemia Macintosh, and Mary Ann Strickland (Hokin).

Biography =Early life and career= Scott was born in 1916 at Te Awamutu. He was known as Jack Scott. His great-grandfather, a Scot, had moved his family to New Zealand from Canada in 1865. He received his education at Kawhia and Paterangi primary schools, then Mount Albert Grammar School before he became a farmer. On leaving school, he purchased a partly-developed plot of land at Hobsonville on which he ran sheep and beef cattle. =Political career= In 1954 Scott was chairman of National's Rodney electorate committee when Clifton Webb was appointed to the job of high commissioner to the United Kingdom. In search of a suitable replacement candidate Scott toured the electorate to find a successor with little success. He even went as far as to personally appeal to Prime Minister Sidney Holland to delay Webb's appointment to London until after the election. Holland demurred and eventually Scott was persuaded to run. After reluctantly putting his name forward he beat 10 other nominees for the party nomination. He was elected and represented the Rodney electorate from 1954 and held it to 1969, when he retired. By 1961 he had been appointed chief government whip, a position he held until 1963. He was a cabinet minister in the Second National Government under Keith Holyoake. He was Minister of Marine (1963‚Äì1969), Postmaster-General (1963‚Äì1969), and Minister of Broadcasting (1963‚Äì1967). Scott was Minister of Broadcasting during the 1966 saga of the \\"pirate\\" station Radio Hauraki, which was broadcasting from the Tiri in the Hauraki Gulf, a role he was best remembered for. As minister he became the unpopular face of the \\"heavy handed\\" government when it moved to stop radio broadcasts from beyond the three-mile limit in international waters. Personally Scott was loathe to intervene, believing a National government should be on the side of private enterprise, but was overruled in cabinet. In 1990 Scott helped Radio Hauraki celebrate its transition to the FM frequency. At the event he revealed that he had vainly tried to persuade the board members of the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation to lease the station air time so that they could broadcast from land. He also confessed that he burnt a marine department report proposing to arrest the broadcasters stating \\"I wasn't going to use those sort of dirty tricks on them.\\" After his retirement from Parliament he remained an active National Party member, but was known to criticise the party publicly on occasion. Notably, in an article in the New Zealand Herald in 1980 he stated that the Muldoon government had become arrogant and described what Robert Muldoon called \\"fine-tuning the economy\\" as \\"fiddling while Rome burns\\". =Later life and career= He was chairman of the New Zealand Historic Places Trust (since renamed to Heritage New Zealand) from 1970 to 1973. He then sold his farm after refusing to continue paying $20,000 in rates on 160 acres to the Waitemata City Council which he deemed to be an excessive amount. Scott then became a director of several shipping companies, including North Shore Ferries until he retired. In the 1994 Queen's Birthday Honours, Scott was appointed a Companion of the Queen's Service Order for public services. Scott died in Hastings on 30 October 2001, aged 85. He frequently pondered over writing his memoirs, and after many years equivocating had promised friends he had set aside time to do so, but died just a week before he was set to commence.

The station, which is owned and operated by the non- profit KSER Foundation, broadcasts at 90.7 MHz with an ERP of 5.8 kW and is licensed to Everett, Washington. History KSER's roots trace back to 1962, when KRAB signed on at 107.7 MHz. This Seattle radio station, later owned by the Jack Straw Memorial Foundation, provided an eclectic mix of jazz, world music, Pacifica radio features, and much more. But the station was also dangerously close to insolvency. Its management realized the station could be sold to a commercial broadcaster and an endowment created, allowing the foundation to broadcast in the non-commercial part of the radio dial, which exists between 88.1 MHz and 91.9 MHz. The owners of KRAB originally applied to share time with KNHC, owned by the Seattle Public Schools. However, this action was seen by the school district as a hostile take-over bid. Ultimately, the owners got a license for 90.7 MHz in Everett, Washington. The Seattle frequency was sold and became KMGI (now today's KNDD). Six years later, on February 9, 1991, KSER signed on from its studios in nearby Lynnwood, Washington. By 1994 the foundation sold the station to its current owners, who relocated the studios to Everett and its transmitter to Lake Stevens, Washington, giving them complete coverage in Snohomish County. Although its signal also reaches King County, coverage is limited due to signal coverage from KVTI: Tacoma, which broadcasts adjacent at 90.9 MHz. KVTI can't be heard in most of Snohomish County, Washington. In the fall of 2013, the KSER Foundation signed on a second signal: 89.9 KXIR, Freeland.

An army officer of Slavic origin from the Pontus region (now north-eastern Turkey), Thomas rose to prominence, along with the future emperors Michael II and Leo V the Armenian (), under the protection of general Bardanes Tourkos. After Bardanes' failed rebellion in 803, Thomas fell into obscurity until Leo V's rise to the throne, when Thomas was raised to a senior military command in central Asia Minor. After the murder of Leo and usurpation of the throne by Michael the Amorian, Thomas revolted, claiming the throne for himself. Thomas quickly secured support from most of the themes (provinces) and troops in Asia Minor, defeated Michael's initial counter-attack and concluded an alliance with the Abbasid Caliphate. After winning over the maritime themes and their ships as well, he crossed with his army to Europe and laid siege to Constantinople. The imperial capital withstood Thomas's attacks by land and sea, while Michael II called for help from the Bulgarian ruler khan Omurtag. Omurtag attacked Thomas's army, but although repelled, the Bulgarians inflicted heavy casualties on Thomas's men, who broke and fled when Michael took to the field a few months later. Thomas and his supporters sought refuge in Arcadiopolis, where he was soon blockaded by Michael's troops. In the end, Thomas's supporters surrendered him in exchange for a pardon, and he was executed. Thomas's rebellion was one of the largest in the Byzantine Empire's history, but its precise circumstances are unclear due to competing historical narratives, which have come to include claims fabricated by Michael to blacken his opponent's name. Consequently, various motives and driving forces have been attributed to Thomas and his followers. As summarized by the Oxford Dictionary of Byzantium, \\"Thomas's revolt has been variously attributed to a reaction against Iconoclasm, a social revolution and popular uprising, a revolt by the Empire's non-Greek ethnic groups, Thomas's personal ambitions, and his desire to avenge Leo V.\\" Its effects on the military position of the Empire, particularly vis-√†-vis the Arabs, are also disputed. Early life and career The 11th-century Theophanes Continuatus states that Thomas was descended from South Slavs resettled in Asia Minor by successive Byzantine emperors, while the 10th- century chronicler Genesios calls him \\"Thomas from Lake Gouzourou, of Armenian race\\". Most modern scholars support his Slavic descent and believe his birthplace to have been near Gaziura in the Pontus.; ; ., Note 1. Hence his epithet of \\"the Slav\\", which has been applied to him only in modern times.. Nothing is known about his family and early life, except that his parents were poor and that Thomas himself had received no education. Given that he was between 50 and 60 years old at the time of the rebellion, he was probably born around 760... Miniature from the Madrid Skylitzes depicting Thomas's supposed flight to the Arabs Two different accounts of Thomas's life are recounted in both Genesios and Theophanes Continuatus. According to the first account, Thomas first appeared in 803 accompanying general Bardanes Tourkos, and pursued a military career until launching his revolt in late 820. In the second version, he came to Constantinople as a poor youth and entered the service of a man with the high court rank of patrikios. Then, discovered trying to commit adultery with his master's wife, Thomas fled to the Arabs in Syria, where he remained for 25 years. Pretending to be the murdered emperor Constantine VI (r. 780‚Äì797), he then led an Arab-sponsored invasion of Asia Minor, but was defeated and punished.; . Classical and Byzantine scholar J.B. Bury tried to reconcile the two narratives, placing Thomas's flight to the Abbasid Caliphate at around 788 and then having him return to Byzantine service before 803,. while the Russian scholar Alexander Vasiliev interpreted the sources as implying that Thomas fled to the Caliphate at Constantine VI's deposition in 797, and that his participation in Bardanes's revolt must be discounted entirely.. The second version of Thomas's story is explicitly preferred by Genesios and Theophanes Continuatus, and is the only one recorded in 9th-century sources, namely the chronicle of George the Monk and the Life of Saints David, Symeon, and George of Lesbos. Nevertheless, the French Byzantinist Paul Lemerle came to consider it an unreliable later tradition created by his rival Michael II to discredit Thomas, and rejected it altogether, preferring to rely on the first account alone. Most modern scholars follow him in this interpretation.; . The first tradition relates that Thomas served as a spatharios (staff officer) to Bardanes Tourkos, the monostrategos (\\"single-general\\", i.e. commander-in-chief) of the eastern themes, who in 803 rose in rebellion against Emperor Nikephoros I (r. 802‚Äì811). Alongside Thomas were two other young spatharioi in Bardanes's retinue, who formed a fraternal association: Leo the Armenian, the future Leo V, and Michael the Amorian, the future Michael II. According to a later hagiographic tradition, before launching his revolt, Bardanes, in the company of his three young prot√©g√©s, is said to have visited a monk near Philomelion who was reputed to foresee the future. The monk predicted what would indeed happen: that Bardanes's revolt would fail, that Leo and Michael would both become emperors, and that Thomas would be acclaimed emperor and killed.; ; . When Bardanes did in fact rise up, he failed to win any widespread support. Leo and Michael soon abandoned him and defected to the imperial camp and were rewarded with senior military posts. Thomas alone remained loyal to Bardanes until his surrender.; . In the aftermath of Bardanes's failure, Thomas disappears from the sources for ten years.. Bury suggests that he fled (for a second time according to his interpretation) to the Arabs,. a view accepted by a number of other scholars, such as Romilly James Heald Jenkins., Note 3. The historian Warren Treadgold, however, argues that Thomas stayed in the empire and that may have even remained in active military service, and explains his obscurity by Thomas's association with Bardanes, which hampered his career.. In July 813, Leo the Armenian became emperor and quickly rewarded his old companions, giving them command over elite military forces. Michael received the tagma of the Excubitors (one of the professional guard cavalry regiments stationed around Constantinople), and Thomas the tourma (division) of the Foederati, stationed in the Anatolic Theme.; ; . Rebellion =Background and motives= On Christmas Day 820, Leo was murdered in the palace chapel by officials under the direction of Michael the Amorian, who was quickly crowned emperor.. At about the same time, Thomas launched a rebellion in the Anatolic Theme. Sources are divided on the exact chronology and motives of the revolt. George the Monk, the hagiographic sources, and a letter from Michael II to the western emperor Louis the Pious claim that Thomas had risen up against Leo before Michael's usurpation. This chronology is followed by almost all later Byzantine chroniclers like Genesios, Theophanes Continuatus, and Skylitzes, as well as a number of modern scholars like John B. Bury and Alexander Kazhdan..cf. In his study of Thomas and the revolt, Paul Lemerle dismisses this timeline as a later attempt by Michael to justify his revolt as a response to Leo's failure to suppress the rebellion, and to exculpate himself of the early defeats suffered by the imperial forces.. Some recent studies follow Lemerle and prefer the account of Symeon Logothetes‚Äîgenerally considered the most accurate of the 10th-century sourcescf. ‚Äîaccording to which Thomas rebelled a few days after the murder of Leo and in reaction to it.., Chapter 1. Consequently, the empire became divided in a struggle that was less a rebellion against the established government and more a contest for the throne between equal contenders. Michael held Constantinople and the European provinces, controlled the imperial bureaucracy, and had been properly crowned by the Patriarch, but he had come to the throne through murder, while Thomas gained support and legitimacy through his claim to avenge the fallen Leo, and he won the backing of themes both in Asia and later in Europe.. Thomas was a well-known, popular, and respected figure in Asia Minor, where Leo V had enjoyed considerable support. Michael, on the other hand, was virtually unknown outside the capital; his military record was unremarkable, he was uneducated and coarse of manner, his stutter earned him ridicule, and he was reputed to sympathize with the heretical religious sect of the Athinganoi, to which his family had belonged.; . Byzantine accounts of Thomas's rebellion state that he did not in fact claim the throne under his own name but assumed the identity of Emperor Constantine VI, who had been deposed and murdered by his mother, Irene of Athens, in 797.. Most modern scholars follow Lemerle, who dismisses this as yet another later fabrication.., Note 5. If it contains any truth, it is possible that this story may originate from Thomas choosing to be crowned under the regnal name of \\"Constantine\\", but there is no evidence for such an act. The possible appropriation of Constantine VI's identity is linked in some Byzantine sources with the statement that Thomas was a rumoured supporter of iconolatry, as opposed to Michael's support for iconoclasm: it was under Constantine VI that veneration of the icons was restored. Nevertheless, the ambiguous phrasing of the sources, the iconoclast leanings of many themes in Asia Minor, and Thomas's alliance with the Arabs seem to speak against any open commitment to icon worship on his part.; ; . Indeed, given Michael II's conciliatory approach during his early reign, the icon worship controversy does not seem to have been a major issue at the time, and in the view of modern scholars most probably did not play a major role in Thomas's revolt. The image of Thomas as an iconophile champion opposed to the iconoclast Michael II in later, Macedonian-era sources was probably the result of their own anti-iconoclast bias.. Warren Treadgold furthermore suggests that if true, Thomas's claim to be Constantine VI may have been little more than a tale circulated to win support, and that Thomas pursued a \\"studied ambiguity\\" towards icons, designed to attract support from iconophiles. In Treadgold's words, \\"Thomas could be all things to all men until he had conquered the whole empire, and then he would have time enough to disappoint some of his followers\\".. The account of Theophanes Continuatus on Thomas's revolt states that in this time, \\"the servant raised his hand against his master, the soldier against his officer, the captain against his general\\". This has led some scholars, chiefly Alexander Vasiliev and George Ostrogorsky, to regard Thomas's revolt as an expression of widespread discontent among the rural population, which suffered under heavy taxation.; ., Note 6. Other Byzantinists, notably Lemerle, dismiss rural discontent as a primary factor during the revolt.. Genesios and other chroniclers further state that Thomas won the support of \\"Hagarenes, Indians, Egyptians, Assyrians, Medians, Abasgians, Zichs, Iberians, Kabirs, Slavs, Huns, Vandals, Getae, the sectarians of Manes, Laz, Alanians, Chaldians, Armenians and every kind of other peoples\\".; . This has led to modern claims that Thomas's rebellion represented an uprising of the empire's non-Greek ethnic groups,. but according to Lemerle, this exaggerated account is yet another piece of hostile disinformation. It is almost certain, however, that Thomas could count on support among the empire's Caucasian neighbours, for the presence of Abasgians, Armenians, and Iberians in his army is mentioned in the near-contemporary letter of Michael II to Louis the Pious. The reasons for this support are unclear; Thomas may have made unspecified promises to their rulers, but Lemerle suggests that the Armenians might have in part been motivated by revenge for Leo, their murdered kinsman.. =Outbreak and spread of the revolt in Asia Minor= Map of the themes of Asia Minor (modern Anatolia) and of Thrace c. 842 As commander of the Foederati, Thomas was based at Amorion, the capital of the Anatolic Theme. Although junior to the theme's strategos (military governor), his proclamation received widespread support throughout Asia Minor. Within a short time, all the Asian themes supported Thomas, except for the Opsician Theme under the patrician Katakylas, a nephew of Michael II, and the Armeniac Theme, under its strategos, Olbianos. The Thracesian Theme wavered between the two rivals, but finally threw its support behind Thomas. More than two-thirds of the empire's Asian army eventually aligned with Thomas, while the defection of the provincial tax officials provided him with much-needed revenue.; ; ., Chapter 2.1. Thomas's troops defeat the forces loyal to Michael II. Miniature from the Madrid Skylitzes. Capture of a city in Asia Minor by Thomas's troops. Miniature from the Madrid Skylitzes. Michael's first response was to order the Armeniac army to attack Thomas. The Armeniacs were easily defeated in battle and Thomas proceeded through the eastern parts of the Armeniac Theme to occupy the frontier region of Chaldia.; . His conquest of the Armeniac province was left incomplete because the Abbasids, taking advantage of the Byzantine civil war, launched raids by land and sea against southern Asia Minor, where Thomas had left few troops. Instead of returning to face these raids, Thomas launched a large- scale invasion of his own against Abbasid territory in spring 821, either in Syria (according to Bury and others) or in Arab-held Armenia (according to Treadgold).; . Thomas then sent an emissary to the Caliph al-Ma'mun, who was sufficiently impressed by Thomas's show of force to receive his proposals, especially in view of the Caliphate's own problems with the rebellion of the Khurramites under Babak Khorramdin. Thomas and Ma'mun concluded a treaty of peace and mutual alliance. The Caliph allowed Thomas to recruit men from Arab- ruled territories, and gave leave for him to cross the border and travel to Arab-held Antioch, where he was crowned emperor by the iconophile Patriarch of Antioch, Job. In exchange, Thomas is said to have promised to cede unspecified territories and become a tributary vassal of the Caliph, though the agreement's exact terms are left unclear in the sources.; ; . At about the same time, Thomas adopted a young man of obscure origin, whom he named Constantius and made his co-emperor. Meanwhile, Michael II tried to win support among the iconophiles by appointing a relative of his as Archbishop of Ephesus, but his plan failed when the latter refused to be consecrated by the avowedly iconoclast Patriarch Antony I Kassimates. In an effort to consolidate his hold on the provinces, and especially the two Asian themes still loyal to him, Michael proclaimed a 25 percent reduction in taxes for 821‚Äì822.. Abydos to Thrace. Miniature from the Madrid Skylitzes. By summer 821, Thomas had consolidated his position in the East, though the Opsician and Armeniac themes still eluded his control. He set his sights on the ultimate prize, Constantinople, the possession of which alone conferred full legitimacy to an emperor. Thomas assembled troops, gathered supplies, and built siege machines. To counter the powerful Imperial Fleet stationed in the capital, he built new ships to augment his existing fleet, which came from the Cibyrrhaeot and Aegean Sea naval themes, and possibly included task forces from the theme of Hellas.; . Thomas recalled Gregory Pterotos, a general and nephew of Leo V whom Michael had exiled to the island of Skyros, and gave him command of the fleet. By October, the thematic fleets loyal to Thomas had finished assembling at Lesbos, and Thomas's army began marching from the Thracesian Theme towards Abydos, where he intended to cross over into Europe.; ; . At this point, Thomas suffered his first reversal of fortune: before his departure for Abydos, he had sent an army under his adoptive son Constantius against the Armeniacs. Constantius was ambushed by strategos Olbianos and killed, although the army was able to withdraw with relatively few casualties. Constantius's severed head was sent to Michael, who dispatched it to Thomas at Abydos.; . Thomas was undaunted by this relatively minor setback, and crossed over into Europe some time in late October or early November. There, Constantius was soon replaced as co-emperor by another obscure individual, a former monk whom Thomas also adopted and named Anastasius.; . =Siege of Constantinople= Constantinople and its walls during the Byzantine era Anticipating Thomas's move, Michael had gone out at the head of an army to the themes of Thrace and Macedonia in Constantinople's European hinterland and strengthened the garrisons of several fortresses there to secure the loyalty of their populace. When Thomas landed, the people of the European themes welcomed him with enthusiasm, and Michael was forced to withdraw to Constantinople. Volunteers, including many Slavs, flocked to Thomas's banner. As he set out towards Constantinople, chroniclers recount that his army swelled to some 80,000 men.; . The capital was defended by the imperial tagmata, augmented by reinforcements from the Opsician and Armeniac themes. Michael had ordered the city walls to be repaired, and chained off the entrance to the Golden Horn, while the Imperial Fleet further guarded the capital from the sea. Nevertheless, judging from Michael's passive stance, his forces were inferior to Thomas's; Warren Treadgold estimates Michael's army to have numbered approximately 35,000 men.; . Thomas's fleet arrived at the capital first. Facing no opposition from the Imperial Fleet, the rebels broke or unfastened the chain and entered the Golden Horn, taking station near the mouths of the Barbysos river, where they awaited the arrival of Thomas and his army.; . Thomas arrived in early December. The sight of his huge force did not cow the capital's inhabitants: unlike the provinces, the capital's citizens and garrison stood firmly behind Michael. To further encourage his troops, Michael had his young son Theophilos lead a procession along the walls, carrying a piece of the True Cross and the mantle of the Virgin Mary, while a large standard was hoisted on top of the Church of St. Mary at Blachernae, in full view of both armies.; . Thomas and his army assail Constantinople. Miniature from the Madrid Skylitzes. After subduing the cities around the capital, Thomas resolved to attack Constantinople from three sides, perhaps hoping his assault would impress its inhabitants or lead to defections. His deputies Anastasius and Gregory Pterotos would attack the Theodosian land and sea walls, respectively, while he would lead the main attack against the less formidable defenses protecting Blachernae. All of Thomas's forces were amply supplied with siege engines and catapults, and his fleet fielded quantities of Greek fire in addition to large shipborne catapults.; . Each of Thomas's attacks failed: the defenders' artillery proved superior and kept Thomas's engines away from the land walls, while adverse winds hindered the fleet from taking any meaningful action. Deciding that operations in the midst of winter were hazardous and unlikely to succeed, Thomas suspended all further attacks until spring and withdrew his army to winter quarters.; ., Chapter 2.2. Repulse of the attack of Thomas's fleet on the seaward walls of Constantinople. Miniature from the Madrid Skylitzes. Michael used the respite to ferry in additional reinforcements from Asia Minor and repair the walls of Blachernae. When Thomas returned in spring, he decided to focus his attack on the Blachernae sector. Before the offensive, Michael himself ascended the walls and addressed Thomas's troops, exhorting them to abandon their commander and promising amnesty if they would defect. Thomas's army viewed the plea as a sign of weakness, and advanced confidently to begin the assault, but as they neared the wall, the defenders opened the gates and attacked. The sudden onslaught drove back Thomas's army; at the same time, the Imperial Fleet defeated Thomas's ships, whose crews broke and fled to the shore in panic.; . This defeat diminished Thomas's naval strength, and although he continued blockading the capital by land, the loss demoralized his supporters, who began defecting. Gregory Pterotos, whose family was in Michael's hands, resolved to desert Thomas, followed by a small band of men loyal to him. He departed the rebel camp, headed west, and sent a monk to inform Michael of his defection, but the monk failed to circumvent the blockade and reach the capital. Upon learning of this defection, Thomas reacted quickly: with a select detachment, he followed Gregory, defeated his troops and killed the deserter.; . Michael's fleet destroys Thomas's ships using Greek fire. Miniature from the Madrid Skylitzes. Thomas exploited this small victory for all it was worth, widely proclaiming that he had defeated Michael's troops \\"by land and sea\\". He sent messages to the themes of Greece, whose support had been lukewarm until that point, demanding additional ships. The themes responded forcefully, sending their squadrons, allegedly numbering 350 vessels, to join him. Thus reinforced, Thomas decided to launch a two-pronged assault against Constantinople's sea walls, with his original fleet attacking the wall of the Golden Horn, and the new fleet attacking the south coast, looking towards the Sea of Marmara. Michael, however, did not remain idle: his own fleet attacked the thematic force soon after it arrived at its anchorage in Byrida. Using Greek fire, the Imperial Fleet destroyed many of the rebel vessels and captured most of the remaining ships. Only a few managed to escape and rejoin Thomas's forces.; . Through this victory, Michael secured control of the sea, but Thomas's army remained superior on land and continued its blockade of Constantinople. Minor skirmishes ensued for the remainder of the year, with Michael's forces sallying forth from the city to attack Thomas's forces. Although both sides claimed minor successes in these clashes, neither was able to gain a decisive advantage.; . The Bulgarians under Omurtag attack Thomas's army. Miniature from the Madrid Skylitzes. Michael turned to the empire's northern neighbour, Bulgaria, for help. The two states were bound by a 30-year treaty signed under Leo V, and the Bulgarian ruler, khan Omurtag (r. 814‚Äì831), was happy to respond to Michael's request for assistance. A later tradition, reported by Genesios and Theophanes Continuatus, holds that Omurtag acted of his own accord and against Michael's will, but this is almost universally rejected as a version started or at least encouraged by Michael, who did not wish to be seen encouraging \\"barbarians\\" to invade the empire.; ; . The Bulgarian army invaded Thrace, probably in November 822 (Bury believes that the Bulgarian attack occurred in spring 823), and advanced towards Constantinople. Thomas raised the siege, and marched to meet them with his army. The two armies met at the plain of Kedouktos near Heraclea (hence known as the Battle of Kedouktos in the Byzantine sources) . The accounts of the subsequent battle differ: the later sources state that Thomas lost the battle, but the near-contemporary George the Monk states that Thomas \\"killed many Bulgarians\\". Given the lack of Bulgarian activity after the battle, most modern scholars (with the notable exception of Bury) believe that Thomas won the battle.; ; . =Defeat and death of Thomas, end of the revolt= Michael II's army defeats Thomas. Miniature from the Chronicle of Constantine Manasses. Thomas was unable to resume the siege: aside from the heavy casualties his army likely suffered, his fleet, which he had left behind in the Golden Horn, surrendered to Michael during his absence. Thomas set up camp at the plain of Diabasis some west of Constantinople, spending winter and early spring there. While a few of his men deserted, the bulk remained loyal.; . Finally, in late April or early May 823, Michael marched with his troops against Thomas, accompanied by the generals Olbianos and Katakylas with new troops from Asia Minor. Thomas marched to meet them and planned to use a stratagem to outwit his opponents: his men, ostensibly demoralized, would pretend to flee, and when the imperial army broke ranks to pursue them, they would turn back and attack. However, Thomas's troops were by now weary of the prolonged conflict, and their submission was unfeigned. Many surrendered to Michael, while others fled to nearby fortified cities. Thomas sought refuge in Arcadiopolis with a large group; his adopted son Anastasius went with some of Thomas's men to Bizye, and others fled to Panion and Heraclea., Chapter 2.3.; . The surrender and humiliation of Thomas, as depicted in the Madrid Skylitzes Michael blockaded Thomas's cities of refuge but organized no assaults, instead aiming to capture them peacefully by wearing out their defenders. His strategy was motivated by the political and propaganda expedient of appearing merciful‚Äî\\"in order to spare Christian blood\\", as Michael himself put it in his letter to Louis the Pious‚Äîbut also, according to the chroniclers, by fear of demonstrating to the Bulgarians that the Byzantine cities' fortifications could fall to attack.; . In Asia Minor, Thomas's partisans hoped to lure Michael away by allowing the Arabs free passage to raid the provinces of Opsikion and Optimaton, which were loyal to the emperor. Michael was unmoved and continued the blockade.. His troops barred access to Arcadiopolis with a ditch. To conserve supplies, the blockaded troops sent away women and children, followed by those too old, wounded, or otherwise incapable of bearing arms. After five months of blockade, Thomas's loyalists were eventually forced to eat starved horses and their hides. Some began deserting by lowering themselves with ropes over the city walls or jumping from them. Thomas sent messengers to Bizye, where the blockade was less close, to arrange a relief attempt by Anastasius. Before anything could be done, however, the exhausted troops at Arcadiopolis surrendered their leader in exchange for an imperial pardon.; . Thomas was delivered to Michael seated on a donkey and bound in chains. He was prostrated before the emperor, who placed his foot on his defeated rival's neck and ordered his hands and feet cut off and his corpse impaled. Thomas pleaded for clemency with the words \\"Have mercy on me, oh True Emperor!\\" Michael only asked his captive to reveal whether any of his own senior officials had had dealings with Thomas. Before Thomas could respond, the Logothete of the Course, John Hexaboulios, advised against hearing whatever claims a defeated rebel might make. Michael agreed, and Thomas's sentence was carried out immediately.; . When the inhabitants of Bizye heard of Thomas's fate, they surrendered Anastasius, who suffered the same fate as Thomas. In Panion and Heraclea, Thomas's men held out until an earthquake struck in February 824. The tremor severely damaged the wall of Panion, and the city surrendered. The damage at Heraclea was less severe, but after Michael landed troops at its seaward side, it too was forced to surrender.; . In Asia Minor, Thomas's loyalists mostly submitted peacefully, but in the Cibyrrhaeot Theme, resistance lingered until suppressed by strategos John Echimos. In the Thracesian theme, Thomas's soldiers turned to brigandage. The most serious opposition was offered in central Asia Minor by two officers, who had possibly served Thomas as strategoi: Choireus, with his base at Kaballa northwest of Iconium, and Gazarenos Koloneiates, based at Saniana, southeast of Ancyra. From their strongholds, they spurned Michael's offer of a pardon and the high title of magistros and raided the provinces that had gone over to him. Soon, however, Michael's agents persuaded the inhabitants of the two forts to shut their gates against the officers. Choireus and Koloneiates then tried to seek refuge in Arab territory but were attacked en route by loyalist troops, captured, and crucified.; . =Aftermath and effects= solidus of Michael II with his son, Theophilos The end of Thomas the Slav's great rebellion was marked by Michael II's triumph, held in May 824 in Constantinople. While he executed Thomas's volunteers from the Caliphate and perhaps also the Slavs, the sheer number of individuals involved, the necessity of appearing clement and sparing with Christian lives, and the need to restore internal tranquillity to his realm compelled Michael to treat Thomas's defeated partisans with leniency: most were released after being paraded in the Hippodrome during his celebration, and only the most dangerous were exiled to remote corners of the empire.; . In an effort to discredit his opponent, Michael authorized an \\"official\\" and heavily distorted version of Thomas's life and revolt. The document was written by the deacon Ignatios and published in 824 as Against Thomas. This report quickly became the commonly accepted version of events.. Thomas failed in spite of his qualities and the widespread support he had gained, which brought him control of most of the empire. Lemerle holds that several factors played a role in his defeat: the Asian themes he did not subdue supplied reinforcements to Michael; Thomas's fleet performed badly; and the Bulgarian offensive diverted him away from the capital and weakened his army. But the most decisive obstacles were the impregnable walls of Constantinople, which ensured that an emperor who controlled Constantinople could only be overthrown from within the city.. Thomas's rebellion was the \\"central domestic event\\" of Michael II's reign, but it was not very destructive in material terms: except for Thrace, which had suffered from the prolonged presence of the rival armies and the battles fought there, the larger part of the empire was spared the ravages of war., Chapter 3.. The Byzantine navy suffered great losses, with the thematic fleets in particular being devastated, while the land forces suffered comparatively few casualties.. This is traditionally held to have resulted in a military weakness and internal disorder which was swiftly exploited by the Muslims: in the years after Thomas's rebellion, Andalusian exiles captured Crete and the Tunisian Aghlabids began their conquest of Sicily, while in the East, the Byzantines were forced to maintain a generally defensive stance towards the Caliphate.. More recent scholarship has disputed the degree to which the civil war was responsible for Byzantine military failures during these years, citing other reasons to explain them: Warren Treadgold opines that the empire's military forces recovered fairly quickly, and that incompetent military leadership coupled with \\"the remoteness of Sicily, the absence of regular troops on Crete, the simultaneity of the attacks on both islands, and the government's long-standing lack of interest in sea-power\\" were far more responsible for the loss of the islands.cf. .

The first performance was given by LeClair and the New York Philharmonic under Kurt Masur on April 12 of that year. The orchestra consists of three flutes and piccolo, two oboes and English horn, two clarinets and bass clarinet, two bassoons and contrabassoon, four horns, three trumpets, three trombones and tuba, timpani, harp, piano, celesta, and strings. Performance time is approximately 26 minutes. Inspiration for the work also comes from the writings of British poet and novelist Robert Graves. Movements The work is composed of five movements, each representing a tree from ancient Celtic mythology. =E√≥ Mugna= The first movement of the concerto is E√≥ Mugna, named after the oak. It opens with a long bassoon solo that lends solemnity to the piece. E√≥ Mugna, the great oak, whose roots extend to Connia's Well in the \\"otherworld,\\" stands guard over what is the source of the River Shannon and the font of all wisdom. The well is probably the source of Mugna and the sacred well. - John Williams =Tortan= The second movement is Tortan, the tree associated with magic, especially witchcraft. This movement features both the bassoon and the violin. Tortan is a tree that has been associated with witches, and as a result, the fiddle appears, sawing away as it is conjoined with the music of the bassoon. The Irish bodhr√°n drum assists. - John Williams =E√≥ Rossa= The third movement, E√≥ Rossa, is named after the yew. This tree had power over destruction and rebirth. It opens with a long harp solo. The Tree of Ross (or E√≥ Rosa) is a yew, and although the yew is often referred to as a symbol of death and destruction, The Tree of Ross is often the subject of much rhapsodizing in the literature. It is referred to as \\"a mother's good,\\" \\"Diadem of the Angels,\\" and \\"faggot of the sages.\\" Hence the lyrical character of this movement, wherein the bassoon oncants [sic] and is accompanied by the harp! - John Williams =Craeb Uisnig= The fourth movement represents Craeb Uisnig, the ash. The ash was typically associated with strife. It is the shortest and least melodic movement. Craeb Uisnig is an ash and has been described by Robert Graves as a source of strife. Thus, a ghostly battle, where all that is heard as the phantoms struggle is the snapping of twigs on the forest floor. - John Williams =Dathi= The last movement is Dathi, named after tree that was the muse. The movement is slow and melancholy, featuring the flute as well as the bassoon. There is no gap between movements four and five. Dathi, which purportedly exercised authority over the poets, and was the last tree to fall, is the subject for the close of the piece. The bassoon soliloquizes as it ponders the secrets of the trees. - John Williams Reception Reviewing a recording of the work, Lawrence Johnson of the Chicago Tribune praised the piece, remarking, \\"In a broad five- movement canvas, Williams explores a variety of lightly contrasted, mostly ruminative moods, and there is a quiet mystery and spacious quality to this music that compels attention.\\" Andrew Achenbach of Gramophone similarly observed, \\"Williams has penned a highly imaginative, impeccably crafted score which will surely give great pleasure to many.\\" Recordings The Five Sacred Trees was recorded in 1997 with Williams leading LeClair and the London Symphony Orchestra. This recording was published by Sony Classical Records, and also featured Toru Takemitsu's Tree Line, Tobias Picker's Old and Lost Rivers, and Alan Hovhaness's Symphony No. 2 Mysterious Mountain.

Schm√ºcker's automotive experience came from a long successful career with Ford at Cologne where he began his career as a commercial apprentice when aged 16. He returned to Ford in 1946, following his military service, working successively in the sales, finance and export departments. He was appointed Purchasing Manager in 1956 and joined the management board in 1961. He was appointed Sales manager in 1967 before leaving to become Chairman of Rheinstahl in 1968. He became Chairman of the Volkswagen board in February 1975, succeeding Rudolf Leiding. Schm√ºcker brought to the job a combination of political skill and personal charm that had eluded his two immediate predecessors: his authority within the company was also enhanced by the extent of the financial crisis that directly preceded his appointment and which had appeared to place the very survival of the business in doubt. At the time of Schm√ºcker's assumption of the job, Volkswagen had just staved off bankruptcy with the introduction of the Volkswagen Golf (marketed as the Rabbit in North America and as the Caribe in Latin America), which would eventually replace the Volkswagen Beetle. One of Schm√ºcker's first achievements at Wolfsburg involved reducing the Volkswagen workforce by 25,000 employees during 1975, applying, in the words of a contemporary industry commentator, methods and systems he had learned at Ford. The loss making assembly plant in Australia was closed, but after a period of rationalisation he placed the plants in Mexico and Brazil on a sounder footing for growth than that on which he had found them. Schm√ºcker's cost-cutting instincts were also evident in the decision to sell back to Porsche the commission for a successor to the commercially disappointing VW-Porsche 914. The new car, based on the underpinnings of the Audi 100 C2, turned up a couple of years later badged as the Porsche 924, but sold in much lower volumes (and at a near Porsche-level higher price) than had been envisaged when Volkswagen had commissioned the project. In September 1976, Schm√ºcker made history by securing a deal to build the Volkswagen Westmoreland Assembly Plant near New Stanton, Pennsylvania, making VW the first non-American car company to build its products in the United States since the 1930s. It was an effort to make the Rabbit less expensive to sell in North America at a time when the German Mark was gaining in value both against the U.S. dollar and against the currencies of other competitor economies such as Italy, Japan and France. The Pennsylvania factory opened on 10 April 1978. The Schm√ºcker era saw a conscious retreat from the old commitment to crank up volumes at almost any price: Volkswagen by 1980 was only the world's fifth largest auto-maker in terms of unit sales, overtaken during the 1970s by Toyota and Nissan since volumes had peaked in 1971. Under Schm√ºcker, the Beetle was no longer the unstoppable force in European and US marketplaces it had been at the start of the decade, and in price sensitive markets the German built Golf was hampered by government determination to retain a strong currency. VW lost sales volume to the Japanese automakers, generally around the world but particularly in North America. Nevertheless, in 1975 Volkswagen was again profitable and in 1976 it posted a profit of One Billion Marks, earning Schm√ºcker the epithet in Wolfsburg \\"Toni, der Trickser\\".Jerry Sloninger: Die VW-Story; Stuttgart: Motorbuch Verlag, 1981; ; Seite 256 After suffering a heart attack in 1981, Schm√ºcker was forced to resign the following year, and was succeeded by Dr. Carl Hahn.

The species is a popular quarry for anglers, and has been widely introduced beyond its native area, into Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. They have caused substantial damage to native fish populations in Australia and have been proclaimed a noxious species in New South Wales.  Description  thumb European perch are greenish with red pelvic, anal and caudal fins. They have five to eight dark vertical bars on their sides. When the perch grow larger, a hump grows between its head and dorsal fin. European perch can vary greatly in size between bodies of water. They can live for up to 22 years, and older perch are often much larger than average; the maximum recorded length is . The British record is , but they grow larger in mainland Europe than in Britain. As of May 2016, the official all tackle world record recognised by the International Game Fish Association (IGFA) stands at for a Finnish fish caught September 4, 2010. In January 2010 a perch with a weight of 3.75 kg (8 lb 4 oz) was caught in the River Meuse, Netherlands. Due to the low salinity levels of the Baltic Sea, especially around the Finnish archipelago and Bothnian Sea, many freshwater fish live and thrive there. Perch especially are in abundance and grow to a considerable size due to the diet of Baltic herring.  Distribution and habitat  The range of the European perch covers fresh water basins all over Europe, excluding the Iberian peninsula. Their range is known to reach the Kolyma River in Siberia to the east. It is also common in some of the brackish waters of the Baltic Sea. European perch has been widely introduced, with reported adverse ecological impact after introduction. The European perch lives in slow-flowing rivers, deep lakes and ponds. It tends to avoid cold or fast-flowing waters but some specimens penetrate waters of these type, although they do not breed in this habitat.  Behaviour and reproduction  The perch is a predatory species. Juveniles feed on zooplankton, bottom invertebrate fauna and other perch fry, while adults feed on both invertebrates and fish, mainly sticklebacks, perch, roach and minnows. Perch start eating other fish when they reach a size of around 120 mm. Male perch become sexually mature at between one and two years of age, females between two and four. In the northern hemisphere they spawn between February and July, depositing their eggs on water plants or the branches of trees or shrubs immersed in the water. There has been speculation, but only anecdotal evidence, that eggs stick to the legs of wading birds and are then transferred to other waters.  Taxonomy  The first scientific description of the river perch was made by Peter Artedi in 1730. He defined the basic morphological signs of this species after studying perch from Swedish lakes. Artedi described its features, counting the fin rays scales and vertebrae of the typical perch. In 1758, Carl Linnaeus named it Perca fluviatilis. His description was based on Artedi's research. Because of their similar appearance and ability to cross-breed, the yellow perch (Perca flavescens) has sometimes been classified as a subspecies of the European perch, in which case its trinomial name would be Perca fluviatilis flavescens.  Fishing  Low energy X-rays used for quality control of perch fingerlings at a Swiss fish farm European perch is fished for food and game fishing. Its flesh is described as good eating, with a white, firm, flaky texture and well- flavoured. According to FAO statistics 28,920 tonnes were caught in 2013. Largest perch fishing countries were Russia, (15,242 tonnes), Finland (7,666 tonnes), Estonia (2,144 t), Poland (1,121 t) and Kazakhstan (1,103 t). Baits for perch include minnows, goldfish, weather loaches, pieces of raw squid or pieces of raw fish (mackerel, bluey, jack mackerel, sardine), or brandling, red, marsh, and lob worms, maggots, shrimp (Caridina, Neocaridina, Palaemon, Macrobrachium) and peeled crayfish tails. The tackle needed is fine but strong. Artificial lures are also effective, particularly for medium-sized perch. It is possible to fly fish for perch using artificial flies tied for the purpose. Often, the flies required are \\"streamers\\" or bait-fish imitations and use flash, colour and movement to entice a take from the perch.  Predators  The European perch is a frequent prey of many fish-eating predators, such as the Western osprey (Pandion haliaetus), great cormorant (Phalacrocorax carbo) and common kingfisher (Alcedo atthis). It is an important item in the diet of the globally threatened Dalmatian pelican (Pelecanus crispus). and non avian predators include the Northern pike (Esox lucidus) and the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra).  Diseases and parasites  Cucullanus elegans is a species of parasitic nematode. It is an endoparasite of the European perch. Juvenile perch are commonly infected by Camallanus lacustris (Nematoda), Proteocephalus percae, Bothriocephalus claviceps, Glanitaenia osculata, Triaenophorus nodulosus (all Cestoda) and Acanthocephalus lucii (Acanthocephala)  Perch in culture  Emblem of Bad Buchau.

Smaller continuous truss bridge over the Illinois River at Lacon, Illinois The Kingston-Rhinecliff Bridge A continuous truss bridge is a truss bridge which extends without hinges or joints across three or more supports. A continuous truss bridge may use less material than a series of simple trusses because a continuous truss distributes live loads across all the spans; in a series of simple trusses, each truss must be capable of supporting the entire load. Although some continuous truss bridges resemble cantilever bridges and may be constructed using cantilever techniques, there are important differences between the two forms. Cantilever bridges need not connect rigidly mid-span, as the cantilever arms are self-supporting. Although some cantilever bridges appear continuous due to decorative trusswork at the joints, these bridges will remain standing if the connections between the cantilevers are broken, or if the suspended span (if any) is removed. Conversely, continuous truss bridges rely on rigid truss connections throughout the structure for stability. Severing a continuous truss mid-span endangers the structure. However, continuous truss bridges do not experience the tipping forces that a cantilever bridge must resist, because the main span of a continuous truss bridge is supported at both ends. It is possible to convert a series of simple truss spans into a continuous truss. For example, the northern approach to the Golden Gate Bridge was originally constructed as a series of five simple truss spans. In 2001, a seismic retrofit project connected the five spans into a single continuous truss bridge. Examples The Hart Bridge is a continuous, cantilevered truss bridge with an unusual design that includes a suspended road deck on the main span and a through truss deck on the adjacent approach spans.

It was officially supplanted by the Gregorian chant of the Roman rite in the 11th century, although a few Beneventan chants of local interest remained in use. thumb  220x124px  right  alt= ‚ÄúTu es deus‚Äù in beneventan notation  ‚ÄúTu es deus‚Äù in beneventan notation History During the Lombard occupation of the 7th and 8th centuries, a distinctive liturgical rite and plainchant tradition developed in Benevento. It included feasts of special local importance such as the Holy Twelve Brothers of Benevento. At the time it was called cantus ambrosianus (\\"Ambrosian chant\\"), although it is a separate plainchant tradition from the chant of Milan which we call Ambrosian chant. The common use of the name cantus ambrosianus, the common influence of the Lombards in both Benevento and Milan, and musical similarities between the two liturgies and chant traditions suggest a Lombard influence in the origins of Beneventan chant. Fa√ßade of the church in Montecassino Gregorian chant had already begun to take hold in the Beneventan orbit as early as the 8th century. The two traditions appear to have coexisted for about a century before the Gregorian chant began to replace the native Beneventan. Many Beneventan chants exist only as interpolations and addenda in Gregorian chantbooks, sometimes next to their corresponding chants in the Gregorian repertory. External ecclesiastical influences, such as two German abbots at Montecassino during the 11th century, led to an increasing insistence on the Roman rite and Gregorian chant instead of the local Beneventan traditions. One of these abbots later became Pope Stephen IX, who in 1058 officially outlawed the Beneventan rite and chant. A few Beneventan chants continued to be recorded and performed for a time, especially for the feasts of local importance such as the Holy Twelve Brothers, which had no Gregorian counterpart. However, the Beneventan repertory as a whole fell into disuse. This was commemorated in a legend of a singing contest between a Gregorian and a Beneventan cantor, which ended in victory for the Gregorian repertory when the Beneventan cantor fainted from exhaustion. thumb  220x124px  right  alt= Cloister of Santa Sofia church (Benevento)  Cloister of Santa Sofia church (Benevento) General characteristics Beneventan chant is largely defined by its role in the liturgy of the Beneventan rite, which is more closely related to the liturgy of the Ambrosian rite than the Roman rite. The Beneventan rite has not survived in its complete form, although most of the principal feasts and several feasts of local significance are extant. The Beneventan rite appears to have been less complete, less systematic, and more liturgically flexible than the Roman rite; many Beneventan chants were assigned multiple roles when inserted into Gregorian chantbooks, appearing variously as antiphons, offertories, and communions, for example. Like all plainchant, Beneventan chant is monophonic and a cappella. In accordance with Roman Catholic tradition, it is primarily intended to be sung by males. Like the other Italian chant repertories, the Old Roman chant and Ambrosian chant, the melodies are melismatic and ornate. The melodic motion is primarily stepwise, with a limited ambitus, giving the chants a smooth, undulating feel. Unlike Ambrosian chants, Beneventan chants do not notably specify whether any given chant is meant to be sung by the choir or by any particular singer. The chants almost all end on one of two pitches, a G or an A, and thus do not fit into the Gregorian system of eight modes. What most distinguishes Beneventan chant is its frequent and repeated use of various short melodic motifs. Although this technique is used in other chant traditions, such as the centonization of melodic formulae in the Gregorian Graduals, it is far more frequently used in Beneventan chant than in the other Western plainchant traditions. Chants of the Office Many Beneventan antiphons have psalmody, but no specifically Beneventan style can be distinguished from the Gregorian sources in which it survives. Unlike the Ambrosian rite, there is no special service for nightfall, but there are about fifty extant antiphons and five responsories. Only antiphons for Sunday services survive. Much melodic material is shared among the antiphons and among the responsories. Chants of the Mass With rare exceptions, only Proper chants (chants which vary depending on the feast) for the Mass survive. As in the Ambrosian rite, a threefold Kyrie was sung to a simple melody following the Gloria, but this was not analogous to the more complex Kyrie of the Gregorian repertory. In the Beneventan rite, the Proper of the Mass included an Ingressa, Alleluia, Offertory, Communion, and in six extant Masses, a Gradual. Ingressae, as in the Ambrosian rite, are elaborate chants sung without psalm verses. They are analogous to the Gregorian Introit. Alleluias appear in every Mass except the Masses of Holy Week. Most of them share a single melody. Offertories and Communions are melodically more simple. Some Masses have two Communion chants. Some Communion chants appear in other services as the Offertory chant, or as a simple antiphon.

The small, 100-foot ship had 102 passengers and a crew of about 30‚Äì40 in extremely cramped conditions. By the second month out, the ship was being buffeted by strong westerly gales, causing the ship's timbers to be badly shaken. Caulking failed to keep out sea water. And passengers, even in their berths, lay wet and ill. This, combined with a lack of proper rations and unsanitary conditions for several months, contributed to death for many, especially the majority of women and children. During the voyage there were two deaths, a crew member and a passenger, but the worst was yet to come when, after arriving at their destination, in the space of several months almost half the passengers perished in the cold, harsh, unfamiliar New England winter.Stratton, p. 413 On 9/19 November 1620, after about 3 months at sea, including a month of delays in England, they spotted land, which was the Cape Cod Hook, now called Provincetown Harbor. After several days of trying to get south to their planned destination of the Colony of Virginia, strong winter seas forced them to return to the harbour at Cape Cod hook, where they anchored on 11/21 November.

The series was first shown on British Channel 4 in April and May 2001. The series details Ronson's encounters with conspiracy theorists. It accompanies Ronson's book Them: Adventures with Extremists, which covers similar topics and describes many of the same events. Part 1: \\"The Legend of Ruby Ridge\\" Original air date: 29 April 2001 Jon Ronson meets with Randy Weaver and daughter Rachel, two of the surviving members of the Weaver family. The film shows previously unseen archive footage to describe the life of a family who claim to have moved to a cabin in Ruby Ridge, Idaho, to live peacefully, and escape what they saw as the tyrannical elite of international bankers bent on enslaving the world. Ronson also explains how the Weaver family's conspiracy theories became a shocking tragedy when U.S. Marshals killed two of the family members, their dog, and shot and wounded Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris, whom the Weaver family considered their son. Ronson explores the unsympathetic media response to the killings and how this incident might have influenced the siege at Waco, the Oklahoma City bombing, and the growth of the American militia movement. Part 2: \\"David Icke, The Lizards and The Jews\\" Original air date: 6 May 2001 Jon Ronson follows David Icke as he promotes his theory that \\"the elite are genetically descended from a race of 12-foot, blood-drinking, shapeshifting lizards\\". During the film, Icke is accused by a leftist protest group (including Richard Warman, lawyer and former Green Party of Canada candidate) in Canada of antisemitism. The documentary explores the theme of whether Icke literally means lizards ‚Äî as he steadfastly maintains ‚Äî or whether the reptilians are a coded reference to Jews, an assertion which Icke vehemently denies. Ronson concludes that Icke is probably not an antisemite, and comes to have misgivings about the Icke protesters' methods and their attempts to silence Icke. Part 3: \\"Timothy McVeigh, The Oklahoma Bomber\\" Original air date: 13 May 2001 Before his involvement in the Oklahoma City bombing, Timothy McVeigh believed that a shadowy elite secretly controlled the governments of the world, conspiring to establish a genocidal New World Order. He believed that the Alfred P. Murrah building was local New World Order headquarters. But many other theorists are convinced that the world only knows part of an apparent complex conspiracy story behind the bombing. Ronson meets a number of theorists whilst investigating the story, and concludes his film in Elohim City, a private Christian Identity movement compound in Oklahoma. Part 4: \\"The Satanic Shadowy Elite?\\" Original air date: 20 May 2001 Jon Ronson follows conspiracy theorist and radio host Alex Jones as Jones attempts to infiltrate the annual gathering of dignitaries and business leaders (reportedly including George Bush and Henry Kissinger) at the Bohemian Grove. The film includes footage of attendees dressed in robes and burning an effigy at the foot of a giant stone owl. Jones believes that the ceremony is related to occult secret societies. After the event, Ronson meets comedy actor and fellow attendee Harry Shearer who describes the event as a glorified fraternity party. Shearer largely dismisses Jones's dramatic retelling of the gathering and notes that the music is supplied by the Symphony Orchestra of San Francisco. Part 5: \\"The Bilderberg Group\\" Original air date: 27 May 2001 Ronson teams up with reporter James P. Tucker Jr., who has been investigating the Bilderberg Group, an annual invitation-only conference, for over thirty years. According to Tucker, around 130 guests, most of whom are persons of influence in business, academic, or political circles, meet annually in secret. The duo encounter unwelcoming suited security men and a car chase. Ronson also interviews Group founder Denis Healey.

Biography Canham joined the Army on May 23, 1919. In 1921, as a sergeant, Canham took a course in the Army's first preparatory school to allow soldiers from the ranks to attend the United States Military Academy. He was chosen and graduated from West Point in 1926. Prior to World War II, he served in the Philippines and Shanghai and was one of the purchasers of the Shanghai Bowl. During these years he acquired a reputation as a strict disciplinarian and superb leader of troops. =World War II= In 1942, as a colonel, he took command of the 116th Infantry Regiment shortly before it sailed for England. Canham's 116th Infantry, alongside the 1st Infantry Division's 16th Infantry Regiment, was chosen as the first to land at Omaha beach on D-Day. The opening scene of the movie Saving Private Ryan depicts the conditions under which Canham's regiment landed on the Dog Green (A Co)/White (G Co)/Red (F Co) sectors [Cite: \\"The First Wave\\" by Alex Kershaw (Publ. 2019)] of Omaha Beach along with one company of Army Rangers. Shortly after hitting the beach, Canham was shot through the wrist, refusing evacuation, he moved his men off Omaha and inland. Sergeant Bob Slaughter (D Company, 116th) remembers Canham screaming at soldiers to move off the beach and go kill Germans. Slaughter remembers him yelling at one lieutenant hiding in a pillbox from a German mortar barrage, \\"Get your ass out of there and show some leadership!\\". Don McCarthy (Headquarters Company, 116th) remembers seeing Canham walking upright along the beach in the face of enemy fire, \\"I got the hell out of there and moved forward. I was more afraid of Colonel Canham than I was of the Germans.\\" For his actions on Omaha Beach, and the fighting to take Saint L√¥, he received the United States' second highest award for valor in combat, the Distinguished Service Cross. Soon afterwards Canham was promoted to Brigadier General and was named as the Assistant Division Commander of the 8th Infantry Division. It was in this capacity during the surrender of the German garrison at the Port of Brest (see Battle for Brest) that Canham spoke the words that would become the 8th Infantry Division's motto. Upon entering the headquarters of Generalleutnant (Lieutenant General) Hermann-Bernhard Ramcke, a leader of German paratroops, Ramcke demanded to know the lower ranking Canham's credentials as a condition of surrender. Unruffled, Canham pointed to the dirty and tired American soldiers he had brought with him to witness the surrender and said, \\"These are my credentials.\\" The account of this event, which was reported in The New York Times, saw in this spontaneous statement of a combat leader the greatest tribute ever paid to the real power of the American Army, the individual soldier. By the end of World War II, Canham had earned every award for valor except the Medal of Honor from the United States. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order by General Bernard L. Montgomery of the British Army and several awards for valor from France. After the war, Canham was Assistant Division Commander of the 82nd Airborne Division and later became commanding general of the 82nd. He was also the commanding general of the 3rd Infantry Division and the commanding general of XI Corps. =Later life= Canham retired from the Army in 1960 with 41 years of service. He died on August 21, 1963 at Walter Reed General Hospital aged 62 years and is interred at Arlington National Cemetery.

He was broken by Tommy Akin, but for the majority of his career was trained by Vincent Timphony. Wild Again was bred by W. Paul Little and owned by Black Chip Stables, a nom de course for the racing partnership of Texans William Allen and Ron Volkman and the Californian Terry Beall. Wild Again is most famous for winning the inaugural Breeders' Cup Classic in 1984 over Slew o' Gold and Gate Dancer in a famous stretch run where all three battled head-to- head to the finish line. In a thrilling conclusion to the richest race in history during that time, long shot Wild Again survived both a wild bumping match in the stretch with Slew o' Gold and Gate Dancer and a steward's inquiry to win the $3 million Breeders' Cup Classic at Hollywood Park Racetrack. The three battled down the stretch with Wild Again bearing out and shifting his path away from the rail and Gate Dancer \\"lugging in\\" towards the rail, squeezing out Slew O' Gold. Wild Again finished a head in front of Gate Dancer with Slew o' Gold less than a length behind. Wild Again, ridden by substitute jockey Pat Day, ended up in front by a head over Gate Dancer and Slew o' Gold - sandwiched between the two for the final furlong - was third by one-half length. After the long steward's inquiry, Slew o' Gold was moved up to second because of interference by Gate Dancer, the Preakness Stakes winner. Steward Alfred Shelhamer pointed out in the films that Wild Again's path through the stretch didn't waver more than six inches. \\"If you look at the harrow marks in the track,\\" said Shelhamer, \\"you'll notice Wild Again never leaves his path, but Gate Dancer comes over quite a bit at the sixteenth pole and bothers both horses.\\" The dark brown colt ran in 28 races in his four-year career, winning 8, placing 7 times, and coming in third on four occasions. Year by year record: *1982 = 7: 2-3-0  $33,700 *1983 = 1: 0-0-0  $0 *1984 = 16: 6-1-4  $2,054,409 *1985 = 4: 0-3-0  $116,720 *Totals = 28: 8-7-4  $2,204,829 Aside from winning the first Breeders' Cup Classic, to which he had to be supplemented for a fee of $360,000, Wild Again won the Grade I Meadowlands Cup Handicap, the Grade II New Orleans Handicap and the Grade II Oaklawn Handicap in which he broke the track record by almost two seconds. When he retired from racing, Wild Again stood at stud at Three Chimneys Farm where he became a successful sire. Among his sons and daughters are: * Wild Waltz - won Yugoslavian Cup 1992-1994, Champion in Yugoslavia 1994 * Born Wild - won Austrian Derby, Champion three-year-old in Austria * Elmhurst - winner of the 1997 Breeders' Cup Sprint * Milwaukee Brew - won the 2002 & 2003 Santa Anita Handicap * Offlee Wild - wins include the Suburban Handicap, Holy Bull Stakes, Massachusetts Handicap * Sarava - won the Belmont Stakes * Shine Again - multiple Grade I winner for Allaire du Pont * Wild Rush - millionaire multiple Grade I winner * Wild Wonder - multiple stakes winner, set new Track Record while winning the 1998 Longacres Mile Handicap * Wilderness Song - multiple stakes winner in Canada and the United States, 1992 Canadian Champion Older Mare Wild Again was pensioned from stud duties in October 2004 and euthanized in December 2008 due to the infirmities of old age. He was laid to rest at Three Chimneys Farm Cemetery where Slew o' Gold was laid to rest the year prior in 2007. Wild Again was the last survivor among the winners of the first Breeders' Cup.

She brings a very personal vocal style to the singing of French pop songs: Her voice has a very strong vibrato. Ten years after Barbara, V√©ronique Sanson became one of the first French female singer-songwriters to break into stardom with her debut album Amoureuse in 1972. She also became one of the most successful and most prominent members of the Seventies \\"Nouvelle chanson fran√ßaise\\" (\\"New French chanson\\"), alongside Alain Souchon, Bernard Lavilliers, Jacques Higelin, Michel Polnareff, Catherine Lara, Yves Duteil, Maxime Le Forestier, Renaud, William Sheller, Michel Jonasz, Michel Berger, Hubert-F√©lix Thi√©faine, Louis Ch√©did, or Francis Cabrel.Pr.

In 1974, Patti Dahlstrom recorded a second version with her own lyrics, entitled \\"Emotion\\" which was covered by Helen Reddy (1974) and Shirley Bassey (1975). Many other covers of \\"Amoureuse\\" have been recorded in French, German, Spanish, Dutch or Japanese.\\"V√©ro en vrai\\" par Yann Morvan, booklet included in the Whole-collection-box \\"Et voil√†\\", 2008. V√©ronique Sanson plays piano and guitar.  Childhood and family  Both her parents, Ren√© and Colette Sanson, were members of the Resistance during the German occupation of France. Before the war, was a French diplomat in The Hague. When the Germans invaded the Netherlands, he sent a coded message to warn the French government that Germany was planning to attack France from across the Belgian border. This very message was decoded by Colette, a communication worker at the French Ministry of War. It was not until a few months later that they met in person, in a resistance cell. Both became prominent within the French Resistance. In 1944, after the bombing of a German train, Colette was arrested and sentenced to death by the occupation force before she managed to escape.Documentary \\"La douceur du danger\\" by Didier Varrod 2005 After the liberation of Paris, Ren√© Sanson was appointed Minister of Labour in Charles de Gaulle's provisional government. The couple married in 1945. As a lawyer and an economist, Ren√© Sanson remained involved in politics as Member of Parliament and Deputy of the 13th district of Paris until 1967. In 1970, he was in charge of the French delegation at the Osaka World Expo; V√©ronique first visited Japan on this occasion. V√©ronique grew up in a very posh and privileged Parisian home. She attended the Cours Hattemer, a private school. Her parents considered music the finest art there was, and emphasized the musical apprenticeship of their daughters. Her mother introduced her to the guitar, while her father, who was a great fan of jazz, taught her the piano at the age of four. At the age of 13, she already composed her own songs, influenced by The Beatles, Ray Charles and by Dionne Warwick's peculiar vibrato. In 1965, she was struck by amnesia after a severe bout of meningitis that left her with few and fragmented childhood memories. Discovery and early recordings: the late 1960s In 1967, her career began in a trio, the Roche-Martin, with Fran√ßois Bernheim and her sister Violaine Sanson. The three teenagers only managed to sell a few hundred records, but this experience allowed her to meet with Michel Berger, with whom she began a romantic relationship as well as a prolific artistic career. He introduced her to his record company (Path√© Marconi), and encouraged her to pursue a solo career. Sanson later mentioned that period as her most productive. In an interview, she recalled that she forced herself to write a song per day to keep up with Berger, who commissioned her to write songs for Isabelle de Fun√®s, niece of French actor, Louis de Fun√®s. She wrote \\"Mon voisin\\", \\"Une odeur de neige\\" and \\"Jusqu'√† la tomb√©e du jour\\" that would later be featured in Sanson's 1992 album Sans Regrets. In 1969, she released her first solo single, comprising \\"Le Feu Du Ciel\\" and \\"Le Printemps est l√†\\", which met with very little success. The Breakthrough: the early 1970s After the commercial failure of her first single, her contract with Path√© Marconi was severed. In 1971, she wrote \\"La brume de Philadelphie\\" for Petula Clark, which was issued as the B-side of Clark's French single \\"La Chanson de Marie Madeleine\\". She and Berger had formed an inseparable team, and were offered a joint recording contract by Bernard de Bosson, CEO of WEA at the time. In 1972, Sanson released the album Amoureuse, produced by Berger, which received a warm welcome from critics. With the singles \\"Besoin de personne\\", \\"Amoureuse\\", and \\"Bahia\\", it reached the summit of the charts thanks to intensive radio play (2x Gold in 5 months). Fran√ßoise Hardy later declared that the release of Amoureuse marked the end of the Y√©-y√© era, as she confessed \\"When I first heard Amoureuse, I had the impression that every female singer, including myself, was left far behind\\". However, the success of the album had an ironic downside for V√©ronique, who was terrified of performing in front of an audience and therefore refused to schedule concerts. However, Berger and de Bosson believed she could overcome her debilitating fear, and forced her to perform a daily showcase at the Eiffel Tower's restaurant. She also appeared the same year as the opening act for some of the biggest stars of the time such as Claude Francois, Julien Clerc, and Michel Polnareff. Amoureuse was closely followed by De l'autre c√¥t√© de mon r√™ve, which also became a commercial success thanks to the singles \\"Comme je l'imagine\\", and \\"Chanson sur ma dr√¥le de vie\\". In the meantime, she had met Stephen Stills after a concert he performed with his new band Manassas in Paris. The pair fell in love, and V√©ronique Sanson left Berger to follow Stills to New York, just as De l'autre c√¥t√© de mon r√™ve was released - she supposedly went out to buy cigarettes, but never came back. In 1973, Sanson went on tour as a main act for the first time in Canada. The American Period: 1973‚Äì1981 V√©ronique Sanson and Stephen Stills married in 1973, in Guildford, England, with notable guests such as Ringo Starr and Roger Daltrey. She moved permanently to the United States, but returned to France regularly to give concerts and promote her music. In 1974, she gave birth to her only child, Christopher, in Boulder, Colorado. Her marriage also marked a new direction to her career, which has led the French media to constantly associate her music with Anglophone influences (in her career she has recorded most of her albums in the US, and mostly with American musicians). She enrolled Manassas and decided to produce her next album herself. In contrast with her Beatles-inspired previous albums, the record emerged as a mixture of pop and 1970's rock'n'roll. Critically acclaimed at the time and still viewed today as a milestone of Sanson's career, Le Maudit was released in 1974, and reflects a large spectrum of musical influences such as bossa nova in \\"Alia Souza\\", or pure rock'n'roll in \\"On m'attend l√† bas\\". After several tours in Quebec in 1973, she went touring in France, with two concerts at the Olympia in October 1974, with Stills on bass guitar, then a long tour in 1975, with two weeks at the Olympia. In 1976, she began a long-lasting professional collaboration with producer Bernard Saint-Paul - making 12 albums - and released the album Vancouver, recorded in London with British musicians. The record became her first platinum album, propelled by the single \\"Vancouver\\", one of her biggest hits. By 1976, Sanson had become an established star. Her music, very much inspired by the best American producers, was a rarity in the Seventies French musical landscape. She gave two weeks of concerts at the Olympia, where her first live album was recorded.Live at the Olympia 1976 The following year she released Hollywood, her fifth studio album. Recorded in Stevie Wonder's studios in Los Angeles, Hollywood found Sanson combining a disco-inspired sound to pop-driven melodies, which led the album to be referred to as the most representative piece of Sanson's American period. The same year she went on tour across France with Michel Jonasz as her opening act. Although she lived in the United States most of the time, she managed to remain present in the French musical landscape, travelling back and forth between her home in Colorado and her audience in France. In 1978, she became the first French female artist to perform at le Palais des sports in Paris, which was the biggest arena in Paris at that time. In 1979, she released 7√®me, best known for the single \\"Ma r√©v√©rence\\", one of her most popular songs. Overall, the album is quite melancholic, which contrasts with the lightness of Hollywood two years earlier. In fact, Sanson was going through a hard time in her life. She had decided to leave Stills and was engaged in a tough legal battle in American courts for the custody of her son. Period of Transition: The 1980s The transition toward the 1980s was difficult and challenging. Still tied to America by her son, of whom she did not gain full custody until 1983, she continued to split her time between the USA and France. Fans and critics were enthusiastic when her new album came out in 1981 (Laisse-la vivre). Though the record contained no memorable hit singles, it emerged as a solid ensemble of well-crafted songs. The album went double gold and she spent the following year on the road, managing to draw large audiences during a tour that ended with three weeks in a row at the le Palais des sports of Paris.Live at the Palais des Sports 1981 In 1983, she permanently settled in France with her son, Christopher, and her boyfriend, actor Etienne Chicot. After a long break, she released an eponymous album in 1985, recorded entirely in France. This untitled album was nicknamed The white album by the press, while Sanson refers to it as The lil' trees (Les p'tits arbres). This synth-driven album included C'est long c'est court which became a radio hit in France during the summer of 1985, as well as the ballad \\"Le temps est assassin\\". She then embarked in a long tour during 1985‚Äì86 which met with tremendous success highlighted by a month-long residence at the Olympia in November 1985.Olympia 1985 In 1988, she released the album Moi le venin, which included the highly controversial single \\"Allah\\" (produced by Michel Berger). A couple of months after the release of the video directed by Dominic Sena (director of Gone in 60 Seconds, Kalifornia, Swordfish...), the song was censored in the media, and Sanson was forced to drop it from her tour's set-list after receiving threats of violence from radical Muslims. As a result of several death threats, she was put under police protection. The controversy arose because of the Muslim tradition forbidding reference to Allah in a song, and occurred just a few weeks after a fatwƒÅ was issued against Salman Rushdie. In response to the uproar, Sanson apologized and pleaded that the song was really meant to be a message of peace and tolerance. French show-business massively stood up for her, and more than a hundred artists signed a pamphlet against \\"the diktat of all forms of radicalism\\"sur l'initiative du chanteur Yves Simon, une centaine d'artistes fran√ßais en appellent \\"au refus du diktat de tous les int√©grismes\\". In November 1989, Sanson took part in the first charity tour entitled Les Enfoir√©s for Les Restos du coeur, alongside French rock stars Johnny Hallyday, Eddy Mitchell and Jean-Jacques Goldman. In 1989, she realized a lifelong dream to play with a symphonic orchestra. After rehearsals in Czechoslovakia with the Czech symphonic orchestra \\"Fisyo\\", a series of six concerts took place in December 1989 at the Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet in Paris. A resulting live album was released the subsequent year. In 1990, she also toured with the symphonic orchestra for a dozen concerts across France. The 1990s In 1991, V√©ronique Sanson received the Grand Prix of \\"la SACEM\\" (the French Singer Songwriter guild) to celebrate her entire recording career. The same year, she released a duet with singer-songwriter Catherine Lara, entitled \\"Entre elle et moi\\". For the first time in more than a decade, Sanson recorded her tenth studio album in the US with American musicians. Sans regrets, issued in 1992, was a tremendous success propelled by the famous single \\"Rien que de l'eau\\". This song was the result of an unprecedented collaboration with another songwriter, Bernard Swell, a long-time friend. The album went platinum and its first single still remains one of her biggest hits, with over 500,000 copies sold in six months. In 1993, she won a Victoires de la musique for best female singer of the year. In March, she performed at the Zenith Paris. During these shows, she paid tribute to Berger who had died in 1992, by performing \\"Seras-tu l√†\\", one of his songs. The live album recorded at the Zenith went platinum. Between 1993 and 1996, Sanson went on tour in France, Belgium, Switzerland and Canada. During the summer of 1994, at the Francofolies Festival of La Rochelle, several artists gathered to pay a musical tribute to her career. For more than two hours, Michel Fugain, Alain Chamfort, Yves Duteil, William Sheller, Marc Lavoine, les Innocents, Paul Personne, Maxime le Forestier and I Muvrini, performed some of her biggest hits in duet with Sanson. This special tribute was made into a live album released the following year: Comme ils l'imaginent went 2x Platinum, and became one of the best-selling albums of 1995 in France. In 1995, she married stand-up comedian Pierre Palmade in Triel-sur-Seine. She also recorded a duet with her son, Chris Stills, titled \\"Run\\". The song was released on a benefit album for children living with AIDS (Sol En Si). In 1996, she won her second Victoire de la musique for Best Female Artist of The Year. Sanson started the production of a new album in 1997. The album was recorded in the United States, and Bernard Swell wrote and produced four of the album's songs. A sold out tour followed the release of Indestructible, which went 2x gold. She performed in the Palais des sports of Paris in January 1998, then toured through France, and in the summer of 1999, Sanson performed at various festivals, including at France's largest rock Festival Les Vieilles Charrues. Long Distance: the 2000s Sanson's cover album of Michel Berger songs ‚Äî mostly from his early years ‚Äî was released in 2000 (D'un papillon √† une √©toile) and went platinum in just a few weeks. It was followed by an extensive tour, produced by Paul Buckmaster (Elton John's arranger), and eventually by a live album (Avec vous). Sanson surrounded herself with her usual musicians, mostly Americans, as well as a classical ensemble from Prague. Her stage outfits for this tour were entirely created by Yves Saint Laurent. In June 2000, she was invited to perform for President Jacques Chirac at the Elys√©e Palace for the F√™te de la Musique. In 2002, after a prolonged absence due to health problems, Sanson canceled a solo tour on which she would have accompanied herself only on piano. However, in September 2004, a few months after the press had announced her divorce from Pierre Palmade, she released a comeback album titled Longue Distance, produced by Bernard Saint- Paul. Longue Distance peaked at number 1 on the French charts. Her 2005 tour across France ended with nine concerts at the Olympia, during which she recorded her eighth live album. In 2005, she released her autobiography, La Douceur du Danger (written with Didier Varrod), in which she discussed the most striking events of her life, particularly her alcoholism and her love life. The \\"best-of\\", entitled Petits moments choisis, was released in November 2007, just as the singer started an unusually long tour which lasted until the summer of 2009. In December 2008, the limited edition 22CD/4DVD collection titled Et voil√† !, including all her albums and videos as well as many previously unreleased tracks, sold out in less than a month. In October 2008, she joined ex-husband Stills and her son, Chris Stills, on the stage of the Olympia, to perform a family version of Stills's \\"Love the One You're With\\". In November 2008, rapper Jay-Z released a song called \\"History\\", to honor the election of US President Barack Obama. The song is based on samples and melodies from V√©ronique Sanson's 1972 recording of \\"Une nuit sur son √©paule\\" (the original solo version, not the 1995 duet with Marc Lavoine). Jay-Z's song features Sanson on background vocals. In December 2008, she declared on Canal Plus's \\"Le Grand Journal\\" that she appreciated it, but would have preferred to be asked beforehand.In le Grand Journal of Canal Plus France, aired on 19 December 2008 French-Canadian pop star Ima released a salsa-inspired reworking of \\"Chanson sur ma dr√¥le de vie\\", followed in February 2009 by an associated video. Additionally, singer Lara Fabian released a cover version of \\"Amoureuse\\" in June on her studio album Toutes les femmes en moi.  The 2010s  In March 2010, the two lead actresses of the film Tout ce qui brille released a cover of \\"Chanson sur ma dr√¥le de vie\\" on the movie soundtrack. The song became a number one hit in France, while the original recording by Sanson peaked at number 2 on the French iTunes. The album, titled Plusieurs lunes (Many Moons) was released on 25 October 2010, and debuted at number 3 on the French charts. Plusieurs Lunes caught the attention of the press who widely celebrated and highlighted the return of Sanson after a couple of fairly disappointing albums (namely Indestructible and Longue Distance). A song from this new piece, \\"La nuit se fait attendre\\", was made available on her official website in June 2010, while the second single, \\"Qu'on me pardonne\\" (written by her sister, Violaine) was released in early October. After a week-long residence at the Paris Olympia in March 2011, Sanson toured across France, Belgium, Switzerland, Tunisia, Israel before finishing touring at the end of 2012 with more shows in Paris, at the Grand Rex and Salle Pleyel. In commemoration of the forty years anniversary of the release of Amoureuse (released on 20 March 1972), singer songwriter Jeanne Cherhal played a tribute concert on 21 March 2012 at the studio 104 in Paris at which all 12 tracks of the album were covered by the singer. The concert was broadcast on the radio France Inter on 6 April 2012. On 14 May 2012, Warner Music released a box set containing a remastered CD of Amoureuse (including 10 demo songs, and a duet with Fanny Ardant), a vinyl version, a live CD recorded in Brussels in 2011, and a photo book. In January 2015, she launched a new tour named \\"Les Ann√©es Am√©ricaines\\" (The American Years) at the Olympia, along with a book, composed of unreleased personal documents and pictures, and a 2CD Best of, also titled \\"Les Ann√©es Am√©ricaines\\". In March 2015, a Deluxe issue of the Best of with a previously unreleased recording of her 1975 concert at the Olympia was released. Initially planned to last until April 2015, the tour \\"Les Ann√©es Am√©ricaines\\" was prolonged to January 2016. After 43 years under contract with Warner, she joined Sony. At the 2016 Victoires de la Musique, she was nominated for \\"Best Female Artist of the year\\", but lost to Yael Naim. In November 2016, she released her 15th album Dignes, dingues, donc..., which debuted at number 3 on the French album charts. \\"Et je l'appelle encore\\" was the first single released. At the 2017 Victoires de la Musique, she received two nominations: for \\"Best Female Artist of the year\\" (lost to Jain), and for \\"Best song of the year\\" with \\"Et je l'appelle encore\\" (lost to Vianney's \\"Je m'en vais\\"). Her 2017-2018 tour started on June 30th. Personal life Sanson was romantically involved with French singer-songwriter Michel Berger from 1967 to 1972. Their love story has become a part of French music mythology, especially through songs they wrote to each other long after they broke up. From 1973 to 1979 she was married to American rock musician Stephen Stills. Their son, Chris Stills, is also a musician. She was later married to French comic Pierre Palmade from 1995 to 2001.

It is visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of +3.57. It is separated from the fainter Œ±¬π Capricorni by 0.11¬∞ of the sky, a gap just resolvable with the naked eye, similar to Mizar and Alcor. Based on parallax shift as refined from orbits around the sun of the Gaia spacecraft at earth's Lagrange point 2, the star is 101 to 103 light years from the solar system. Properties The primary, component A, is an evolved G-type star with a stellar classification of G8.5III-IV, indicating that the spectrum displays mixed traits of a giant and subgiant star. At the age of 1.3 billion years, is currently on the red giant branch and is generating energy through hydrogen fusion along a shell surrounding an inert helium core. The star has around double the mass of the Sun and has expanded to more than eight times the Sun's radius. The star is radiating 40 times the solar luminosity from its photosphere at an effective temperature of 5,030 K. The secondary components B and C form a binary system that orbit each other with a period of about 244 years. Both stars have masses about half that of the Sun. They orbit the primary with an estimated period of around 1,500 years. As of 2010, the pair lies at an angular separation of 6.6 arc seconds from the primary along a position angle of 196¬∞. Nomenclature Œ±¬≤ Capricorni (Latinised to Alpha¬≤ Capricorni) is the star's Bayer designation. It bore the traditional names Secunda Giedi or Algiedi Secunda and shared the name Algedi (from the Arabic ÿßŸÑÿ¨ÿØŸä al-jadii 'the goat') with Œ±¬π Capricorni. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN approved the name Algedi for Œ±¬≤ Capricorni on 21 August 2016 and it is now so entered in the IAU Catalog of Star Names. In Chinese, (), meaning Ox (asterism), refers to an asterism consisting of Œ±¬≤ Capricorni, Beta Capricorni, Œæ¬≤ Capricorni, Pi Capricorni, Omicron Capricorni and Rho Capricorni. ‰∏≠ÂúãÊòüÂ∫ßÁ•ûË©±, written by Èô≥‰πÖÈáë.

The song is sung in very heavy Eastern Savonian dialects spoken in North Karelia. It takes the point of view of a young man and Ieva/Eva/Eeva in Finnish, who sneaks away to where everyone is dancing to a polka, and dances all night. Origin The melody of \\"Ievan Polkka\\" is very similar to that of , and in South Karelia the Ievan Polkka is also known as \\"Savitaipaleen polkka\\". The melody can be traced back to the Viipuri Province in the 17th century when the border with the Kingdom of Sweden ran west of the province. The number of Russian soldiers stationed in the border area outnumbered the locals for many decades. At the beginning of the 19th century collectors of Finnish folk dances and folk songs all mention that the dances in the area of Luum√§ki-Savitaipale were Russian dances only and didn't write them down. However, the polka genre is of much later date. Polka was introduced in northern Europe during the late 19th century, which implies that the actual tune as it is known today originates from this era.Red. Greger Andersson, Musik i Norden, Musikaliska akad. Stockholm 1997, article \\"Spelmannen och hans musik\\" Popularity Owing to its viral exposure in popular culture, Ievan Polkka has become one of the most famous Finnish songs in the world. Very popular after World War II, the song was almost forgotten during the late 1970s and 1980s. The song resurfaced after an a cappella performance by the Finnish quartet Loituma, which was first released on their debut album, Loituma, in 1995. The album was released in the United States as Things of Beauty in 1998. The \\"Loituma Girl\\" Orihime Inoue twirling her leek in the Flash animation The a cappella version of the song acquired greater international popularity as part of an Internet phenomenon in the spring of 2006 when the Loituma Girl (also known as Leekspin), a looped Flash animation of anime character Orihime Inoue from the Bleach series twirling a leek, set to a scat singing section of Ievan Polkka sung by Loituma was posted in Russian LiveJournal. For the animation, only the second half of the fifth stanza (four lines) and the complete sixth stanza (eight lines) are used. It quickly became a global hit and the song soon enjoyed overwhelming popularity as a ringtone.Russian meme and cultural phenomena wiki Lurkmore - Yak Zup Zop article Since then the song has been circulating and known under several misspelled variations of its original name or references to the animation, including \\"Ievas Polkka\\", \\"Levan Polkka\\" and \\"Leekspin Song\\". After the animation was posted, Ievan Polkka become widely known worldwide, with a significant rise of interest and recognition demonstrated by the search terms popularity. The Finnish folk song was also given popular covers by several Japanese Vocaloid singers, such as Megurine Luka, Kagamine Rin, and Kagamine Len. The most popular Vocaloid cover belonged to that of Hatsune Miku, garnering more than 5 million views on producer Otomania's official Niconico music video as of April 2020. Its popularity has lent itself to being used in the Vocaloid rhythm game series Hatsune Miku: Project DIVA, mainly as tutorial music. It has also been used in a commercial promoting the LG G5 smartphone. In 2012, folk metal band Korpiklaani recorded a cover on their eighth album Manala. Furthermore, mobile ringtones based on various mixes of \\"Ievan Polkka\\" gained a wide popularity among Russian and Commonwealth of Independent States mobile subscribers in late 2006. The tune is also the theme song to the Internet sitcom Break a Leg; it was remixed by DJ Basshunter of Sweden, DJ Sharpnel of Japan, and Beatnick of Poland; and a version of the song performed by Anne Kulonen was part of a Ready Brek television advert aired in the United Kingdom. In 2016, Erika Ikuta, a member of Japanese girls group, Nogizaka46, sang Ievan Polkka as a part of her private segment on a web TV Show titled Nogizaka46 Hours TV. This song then became well known among Nogizaka46's fans. She later sang it on several occasions such as \\"JUNK Bananaman no Bananamoon GOLD\\" radio show, \\"Nogizaka Under Construction\\" TV show which aired on TV Aichi & \\"Banana Zero Music\\" music program which aired on NHK.

In Asian supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed, wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a firm- textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color. Salted duck eggs are normally boiled or steamed before being peeled and eaten as a condiment to congee or cooked with other foods as a flavoring. The texture is gelatin like egg white and firm and has a perfect round yolk. The egg white has a sharp, salty taste. The orange red yolk is rich, fatty, and less salty. The yolk is prized and is used in Chinese mooncakes to symbolize the moon. Salted eggs can also be made from chicken eggs, though the taste and texture will be somewhat different, and the egg yolk will be less rich. Salted eggs sold in the Philippines undergo a similar curing process, with some variation in ingredients used. They are dyed red to distinguish them from fresh duck eggs. Production =Pateros method= Red salted duck eggs sold in the Philippines. A popular method for processing salted eggs in the Philippines is the Pateros method. The salted egg is prepared \\"Pateros style\\" by mixing clay (from ant hills or termite mounds), table salt and water in the ratio of 1:1:2 until the admixture becomes smooth and forms a thick texture similar to cake batter. The fresh eggs are individually dipped in the admixture, and packed in 150-egg batches in newspaper-lined 10x12x18 inch wooden boxes (often residual boxes of dried fish packing). The whole batch is then lightly wrapped in newspapers to slow down the dehydration process. The eggs are then stored indoors at room temperature over the next 12 to 14 days to cure, the salt equilibrating in the batch by osmosis. Curing can last up to 18 days, but that results in very long-lasting red eggs that can have a 40-day shelf life, which is largely unnecessary, as the eggs are stocked and replenished biweekly. After the two-week curing period, the eggs are hand-cleaned with water and a brush and prepared to be boiled in low heat for 30 minutes. Time is measured from the first moment the water boils and the eggs are immersed. A 50-egg batch is then wrapped in fish nets for ease of removal from the cookware, which must be large enough to accommodate the batch with a two-inch covering of water. Chicken eggs may be processed the same way, although up to 10% of the batch can break during the process.

Christianity, including Catholic, Orthodox, Protestant, Assyrian Church of the East, accounted for 1% and other religions made up the remaining 1-4%. Yazidism and religious syncretism practiced by minorities in Iraq includes Mandaeism, Shabakism, and Yarsanism accounts for 1.5%. The Iraqi Jewish community no longer exists aside from the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Islam Imam Ali Mosque, Najaf. One of the holiest sites in Shia Islam. Iraq's Muslims follow two distinct traditions, Shia and Sunni Islam. According to the 2018 CIA Factbook, Iraq is 97% Muslim: 60-65% Shia and 32-37% Sunni. The overall percentage of Muslims has increased since the Iraqi Civil War (2014‚Äì2017) due to the migration of Christian and Yezidi refugees into neighboring countries. Iraq is home to many religious sites important for both Shia and Sunni Muslims. Baghdad was a hub of Islamic learning and scholarship for centuries and served as the capital of the Abassids. The city of Karbala has substantial prominence in Shia Islam as a result of the Battle of Karbala, fought on the site of the modern city on October 10, 680. Similarly, Najaf is renowned as the site of the tomb of Alƒ´ ibn Abƒ´ TƒÅlib (also known as \\"ImƒÅm Alƒ´\\"), who the Shia consider to be the righteous caliph and first imƒÅm. The city is now a great center of pilgrimage from throughout the Shia Islamic world and it is estimated that only Mecca and Medina receive more Muslim pilgrims. The city of Kufa was home to the famed Sunni scholar Abu Hanifah, whose school of thought is followed by a sizable number of Sunnis across the globe. Likewise, Samarra is home to the al-Askari Mosque, containing the mausoleums of the Ali al-Hadi and Hasan al-Askari, the tenth and eleventh Shia Imams, respectively, as well as the shrine of Muhammad al- Mahdi, known as the \\"Hidden Imam\\", who is the twelfth and final Imam of the Shia of the Ja'farƒ´ Madhhab. This has made it an important pilgrimage centre for Ja'farƒ´ Shia Muslims. In addition, some female relatives of the Prophet Mohammad are buried in Samarra, making the city one of the most significant sites of worship for Shia and a venerated location for Sunnis. Smaller sects of Islam exist in the country, such as the small Shia Shaykhist community concentrated in Basra and Karbala. =Kurds= Iraqi Kurds are mainly Sunni Muslims, with a Shia Feyli minority of 3%. Most Kurds are located in the northern areas of the country. Most Iraqi Kurdish Muslims follow the Shafi school of Islamic law, while others are members of either the Qadiri or the Naqshbandi Sufi tariqah. =Turkmens/Turkomans= About 60%-70% of Iraqi Turkmen are Sunni Muslims, and about 30% to 40% practice the Shia form of Islam. Collectively, most Iraqi Turkmen are secular, having internalized the secularist interpretation of state‚Äìreligion affairs practiced in the Republic of Turkey. The religious and tribal factors and tensions inherent in Iraq‚Äôs political culture do not significantly affect the Iraqi Turkmen Sunnis and Shias.. Christianity The Latin Church in Baghdad Yazidi leaders meet the Chaldean patriarch Audishu V Khayyath in Mosul, c.1895 Christianity was brought to Iraq in 40's AD/CE by Thomas the Apostle, Thaddaeus of Edessa and his pupils Aggagi and Mari. Thomas and Thaddeus belonged to the twelve Apostles. Iraq's indigenous Assyrian people represent roughly 3% of the population (earlier CIA Factbook), mostly living in Northern Iraq, concentrated in the Ninewa and Dahuk governorates. There are no official statistics, and estimates vary greatly. In 1950 Christians may have numbered 10‚Äì12% of the population of 5.0 million. They were 8% or 1.4 in a population of 16.3 million in 1987 and 1.5 million in 2003 of 26 million. Emigration has been high since the 1970s. Since the 2003 Iraq War, Iraqi Christians have been relocated to Syria in significant but unknown numbers. There has been no official census since 2003, when the Christian population in Iraq numbered 1.2‚Äì2.1 million. Iraqi Christians are divided into four church bodies: * \\"Chaldeans\\" (Chaldean Catholic Church) * \\"Assyrians\\" or \\"Nestorian\\" group (Assyrian Church of the East) and (Ancient Church of the East) * \\"West Syriac\\" or \\"Jacobite\\" group (Syriac Orthodox Church) * \\"Eastern Orthodox\\" group (Archdiocese of Baghdad, under jurisdiction of the Eastern Orthodox Patriarchate of Antioch and All the East) Yazidism The Yazidis are a group in Iraq who number just over 650,000. Yazidism, or Sherfedin, dates back to pre-Islamic times. Mosul is the principal holy site of the Yazidi faith. The holiest Yazid shrine is that of Sheikh Adi located at the necropolis of Lalish. Zoroastrianism Zoroastrianism was one of the dominant religions in Kurdistan before the Islamic era. Currently, Zoroastrianism is an officially recognized religion in Iraqi Kurdistan and Iran. Zoroastrianism has become the fastest growing religion with Kurds, especially in Kurdish-controlled Northern Iraq. Because of the religion's strong ties to Kurdish culture, there has been a recent rebirth of Zoroastrianism in the region, and as of August 2015 the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) officially recognized Zoroastrianism as a religion within Kurdish Iraq. Arguably the world‚Äôs oldest monotheistic religion, Zoroastrianism (Zardashti in Kurdish) has almost disappeared in the last century until recent years. According to Yasna, an association that promotes Zoroastrianism in Kurdistan, since 2014 about 15,000 people have registered with the organization, most of them Kurds converting from Islam. people in Iraqi Kurdistan have converted to Zoroastrianism from a Muslim background since 2015, with the first new Zoroastrian temples being built and opened in 2016. Many Kurdish people converted from Islam to Zoroastrianism, especially after ISIL attacked Iraqi Kurdistan. The surge in Kurdish Muslims converting to Zoroastrianism, the faith of their ancestors is largely attributed to disillusionment with Islam after the years of violence and barbarism perpetrated by the ISIS jihadi group. On 21 September 2016, the first official Zoroastrian fire temple of Iraqi Kurdistan opened in Sulaymaniyah. Attendees celebrated the occasion by lighting a ritual fire and beating the frame drum or daf. There are no accurate numbers on the population of Zoroastrians in Iraq because they are listed as \\"Muslims\\" on their government-issued documents. Mandaeism The Mandaean faith has existed in Iraq since the reign of Artabanus V of Parthia, according to the Haran Gawaitha, a text that tells the history of the Mandaean people. This would make the Iraqi presence of Mandaeans at least 1,800 years old, making it the third oldest continually-practiced faith in Iraqi society after Zoroastrianism and Judaism. There are about 60,000 estimated Mandaeians living in Iraq. The oldest independent confirmation of Mandaean existence in the region is the Kartir inscription. The Mandaean faith is commonly known as the last surviving Gnostic faith and its adherents believe it to be the oldest faith on Earth. John the Baptist, known as Yahia Yuhanna, is considered to have been the final Mandaean prophet and first true Ris'Amma, or Ethnarch, of the Mandaean people. Most Iraqi Mandaeans live near waterways because of the practice of total immersion (or baptism) in flowing water every Sunday. The highest concentrations are in the Mesene province with headquarters in Amarah, Qalat Saleh and Basra. Besides these southern regions bordering Khuzestan in Iran, large numbers of Mandaeans can be found in Baghdad in the Dweller's Quarters, giving them easy access to the Tigris River. Judaism Judaism first came to Iraq under the rule of the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon. It was a part of the Babylonian Captivity. After the Six-Day War in Israel, rioting caused the majority of Jews to flee. Present estimates of the Jewish population in Baghdad are eight (2007), seven (2008)Baghdad Jews Have Become a Fearful Few , The New York Times and five (2013) . Among the American forces stationed in Iraq, there were only three Jewish chaplains.

Its population of 3,473 (2011 Census makes it the 12th largest settlement in County Kildare and the fastest growing in the county, having doubled in population from 1,483 in the census of 2002. It is situated primarily in the Barony of Kilcullen (in the Civil Parish of Kilcullen), with part in the Barony of Naas South (Civil Parish of Carnalway), and subsidiary areas include Logstown, Harristown, Carnalway and Brannockstown, Gilltown, Nicholastown, and Castlemartin. Kilcullen Bridge replaced the original settlement of Kilcullen, now Old Kilcullen, in the centuries following the building of the great bridge at the future site of the town. Other local historical features include Dun Ailinne, New Abbey and Castlemartin, for many years the home of media magnate Tony O'Reilly and his wife, horse-breeding shipping heiress Chryss Goulandris, and now owned by US billionaire John Malone. In the town's hinterland are a number of stud farms. Location and natural features Kilcullen is situated off the Dublin to Waterford (M9) motorway, between Naas and Kilkenny, and is centred on the crossroads of the R413 and R448 regional roads (the R448 was part of the main road from Dublin to Carlow, Kilkenny and Waterford until the M9 motorway was opened in 1995, bypassing the town). Kilcullen straddles the River Liffey and is about from Dublin, under from Newbridge, and also close to Kildare Town and Naas. There is just one bridge in the town (on the site of the historic bridge which gave rise to the settlement), and none to the north / west for some distance, until Athgarvan, though there are three to the south / east, in Harristown / Brannockstown, one on a public road, one a road bridge hidden on the old Harristown Estate, and one a former railway viaduct, also on private land. First built in the 1310s, the six-arch bridge over the Liffey was last reconstructed c. 1850, and renovated and widened in the early 1970s; the upstream face is modern while if viewing from downstream, the historic style is visible. Upstream of the town the Liffey is joined by what is called locally the Mill Stream, coming from the direction of New Abbey, and forming the last stage of the substantial Kilcullen Stream (flowing north through Yellow Bog), a nationally monitored waterway. At the western edge of the town is the Pinkeen Stream, a minor tributary of the Liffey, which forms one boundary of Castlemartin Estate. At least two small streams lie further downstream in the Castlemartin area. The town comprises one main street, with a few connecting roads. The main street slopes from Old Kilcullen and the Athy Road and motorway access, after joining with the Newbridge Road, down to the Liffey, and back up again, more steeply. Schools and churches are concentrated at the south-western edge, businesses spread along the main street and near the old market square, and the town hall and theatre (former cinema) and heritage centre, and a bank, lie just to the north east of the bridge. History =(Old) Kilcullen= (Old) Kilcullen and Kilcullen Bridge on one of Ireland's first road maps, with Castlemartin and other local features, 1777‚Äì1783The current town and the barony of the same name are named for an earlier settlement, Kilcullen, on a hilltop a few kilometres to the south, now known as Old Kilcullen. Begun as a monastic settlement, in the mid-5th century, it was at its peak an Anglo-Norman walled town with seven gates and seven, or perhaps eight, roads. Little now remains visible beyond a damaged round tower and a churchyard. This town was perhaps related to the nearby Dun Ailinne, a ceremonial and possible palace site related to the kings of Leinster, though Dun Ailinne precedes any known settlement at Old Kilcullen. Old Kilcullen was raided by Vikings, landing at the location of the modern town, at least twice, in 936 and 944. =Foundation= The current town, officially known, mapped and recorded on legal documents, as Kilcullen Bridge, developed after 1319 when a bridge was constructed here across the River Liffey by a canon, Maurice Jakis, of Kildare Cathedral. It took over, over succeeding centuries, from the previous settlement. Originally, as shown on maps even as late as the late 18th century, the new settlement was wholly on the eastern bank of the Liffey, outside the Barony of Kilcullen. =(Fitz)Eustace family= Kilcullen was influenced for much of its history by the Eustace family, one of whose seats was at Castlemartin. =18th to 19th century= The town was in the vicinity of the Battle of Kilcullen in the 1798 Rebellion, and Castlemartin the base of operations for the British Army in Kildare, under Dundas. In 1837, the official town area had a population of 699, one principal street of 112 buildings, chiefly on the western bank of the Liffey, a market on Saturdays and fairs on 2 February 25 March, 22, 8 June and 29 September 2 October and 8 December. There was a police station and a dispensary, and petty sessions were held. At that time, the population of the rural area of Old Kilcullen still exceeded that of the town by a multiple. =Historic remains= Kilcullen images, including 18th- and 19th-century maps, Liffey, charity cafe and bookshop, round tower at Old Kilcullen, The Bridge, The Spout, Dun Ailinne memorial, Portlester Monument, credit unionOn a hill around three kilometres south and east from Kilcullen (Bridge) is the site of the original settlement, now known as Old Kilcullen, featuring an historic church and graveyard, with an extant round tower. Old Kilcullen may have related to the reputed site of a palace or ceremonial place of the Kings of Leinster at Dun Ailinne, on an adjacent hill. Local groups have constructed an interpretative site for Dun Ailinne at Nicholastown, about a kilometre from the modern town centre, and featuring a sculpture by local sculptor and art teacher (at Kilcullen's Cross and Passion College) Noel Scullion. The site was informally launched at the Spring Equinox, and formally in summer, 2008. In April 2009, it was announced that Dun Ailinne might form part of a bid for World Heritage Site status, along with other royal sites from around Ireland. Adjacent to the modern town are at least one tumulus, on the hill opposite Castlemartin, and one barrow, on a small enclosed green at Logstown. To the west of the town is Castlemartin Estate, where, to the north west, is situated Castlemartin House. This 18th-century mansion, said to have around thirty rooms, is owned by American billionaire, John Malone. The house is successor to a series of older dwellings, perhaps dating back to the 13th century. The estate also includes St. Mary's Church (\\"Castlemartin Chapel\\"), a dependent chapel of Kilcullen Church, founded c. 1200, ruined for centuries and restored in 1979‚Äì1980, and a number of other houses. Two of these, and outlying buildings, opening off the northern part of Main Street, were planned to be redeveloped as apartments, restaurants and shops, with permission granted on 15 February 2008. While the estate itself is largely closed to the public, the new development is required to be without gates, and it was a condition of restoration of the old church that reasonable public access to this also be available. Kilcullen has an early church of its own, around outside the town, the New Abbey, commenced in 1486 by Rowland FitzEustace, 1st Baron Portlester and Chancellor of Ireland. The remnants of the abbey today lie in a church- and grave-yard and feature some notable tombstones. They can be reached by a Mass path, within the Valley Community Park, which also passes St. Bridget's Well. In the Brannockstown / Harristown area, near the five-way crossroads, is Harristown House, originally built in 1740 by Whitmore Davis as the country seat of the La Touche family, gutted by fire in 1891 (while some furniture was saved, most artwork was lost) and rebuilt by James Franklin Fuller in reduced form. The house was sold in 1920, and refurnished, and is now open as a tourist attraction. Features include a walled garden and formal walk, the library, French and Italian furniture and 18th-century Chinese wallpaper. Notably, Harristown, although it had no real settlement, was once an electoral borough. Harristown once had its own railway station on the terminated Naas ‚Äì Sallins ‚Äì Tullow Branch Line, and a railway bridge over the Liffey, built 1885. The line has since been lifted but the bridge remains, away from the roads. =Turnpike= Kilcullen Bridge and Old Kilcullen were pivotal to the first toll road in Ireland, founded in 1729, and initially running to \\"the Bridge at Kilcullen\\" and later to a point west of this, passing the fair green at Old Kilcullen. The road's administration and maintenance were at times questionable, and amending legislation was made at least twice in its history. =Birth of motor racing= 1903 Gordon Bennett Trophy. Ren√© de Knyff, driving his Panhard to second place, passes Alexander Winton repairing the Winton Bullet 2 on the first lap On 2 July 1903 the Gordon Bennett Cup race ran through Kilcullen. It was the first international motor race to be held anywhere in what was then the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The Automobile Club of Great Britain and Ireland wanted the race to be hosted in the United Kingdom, and Ireland was proposed as racing was illegal on British public roads. After some lobbying, a number of local laws were changed, and Kildare was chosen as the venue ‚Äì partly because the straightness of the roads were deemed a safety benefit. As a compliment to Ireland, the British team chose to race in Shamrock green which thus became known as British racing green. The route consisted of several loops which passed through Kilcullen, Kildare, Monasterevin, Stradbally, Athy, Castledermot, and Carlow. The race was won by the Belgian racer Camille Jenatzy, driving a Mercedes. Modern signs mark both the route and the old inn that was used as a base. =Town Hall and Heritage Group= Today the town hall has historical displays, formed and maintained in co-operation with the active Kilcullen Heritage Group, and with the Kildare County Library Service. The town hall displays include photographs, prints and maps and some objects. The Heritage Group holds regular meetings and talks. Community and amenities Kilcullen images, inc. the Valley Community Park and St. Brigid's Holy Well there, parts of Main Street, historical maps, the Dun Ailinne interpretative board, an early sketch and floorplan of St. Mary's Church, CastlemartinA major feature of the town is the narrow but extensive Valley Community Park, which runs along the River Liffey, and related walks, one of which goes all the way to New Abbey. The Valley includes the restored historic main water source for the town, the Spout, and the Holy Well of St. Brigid, ornamented with a sculpture of \\"St. Brigid feeding the poor\\", by Fr Henry Flanagan, OP. There is also the small Riverside Walk behind the Town Hall. Kilcullen Library, a branch of Kildare County Libraries on New Abbey Road, provides service to the greater Kilcullen area. Located in the former boys schoolhouse, built 1925 and operating until 1980, it holds adult, reference and junior sections, some local history information, and a public access internet PC. =Civic groups= On a number of occasions from the mid-20th century, community groups have been formed, most notably Kilcullen Community Council, Kilcullen Community Development, and the current formation, Killcullen Community Action (KCA). These groups have achieved much for the town, including the establishment, and preservation under charitable trustees, of the Valley Community Park. Kilcullen has an active Lions Club, meeting regularly and driving and wholly or partly funding a number of community initiatives, such as the Youth Cafe due to open at the Tennis Club building, and the Photographic Competition, designed to capture a record of scenes and personalities, to be kept in the Heritage Centre. One of their major fund-raising events is the Duck Race in the Liffey, which since 2010 formed part of a larger community-led River Festival. There is an active local Scout group, and a well-established credit union, with a large office near the town bridge, as well as the Kilcullen Flower and Garden Club. Camphill Kilcullen district is home to two Camphill Communities, one at Dunshane and one in the town itself, which operates the An Tearmann facility, including a coffee shop and Ireland's only Anthroposophical Bookshop, with an organic food shop behind. =Education= The town and area have a number of primary schools, and one secondary school, the Cross and Passion College. There is also a Steiner method school in nearby Grangebeg, about five miles from Kilcullen, on the Dunlavin Road. =Media= There is a long-running local magazine, The Bridge, published monthly, and the area is also covered with a section in the Kildare Nationalist newspaper. There is also an established online journal, A Kilcullen Diary. =Religion= Brannockstown Baptist Church, built in 1882. Kilcullen is the main element in the Parish of Kilcullen and Gormanstown in the Roman Catholic Church, with two churches managed by the parish of which the parish church, dedicated to the Sacred Heart and St. Brigid, from 1872, lies at the western end of the town proper, while the other, St. Joseph's, is at Yellow Bog. There is also a church on private land, at Castlemartin Estate, St. Mary's Church. Kilcullen is part of the Union of Newbridge in the Church of Ireland (along with Newbridge town, Athgarvan and Brannockstown), having one of that Union's three churches, St. John's. Kilcullen also has a Baptist church in Brannockstown (near Harristown), Brannockstown Baptist Church. It was founded in 1873 by John La Touche who was influenced by Charles Spurgeon. Business The town has more than thirty shops and service outlets, including a petrol station, several convenience stores (one of which includes the local post office), a bookshop, suppliers of farm, hardware & building equipment, and a bank branch. There are small restaurants, several fast food stores, at least three pubs serving food, and a coffee shop (and bookshop) run by the local Camphill Community. On Lower Main Street is Berney Bros. Saddlery, founded in the mid- nineteenth century. Slightly to the east of the town, in parts of Brownstown and Carnalway, is a private refuse disposal facility, KTK. The owner of the facility made available funding over many years, notably from 2000 to 2006, from a levy on dumping there, to support the work of local groups such as the Tidy Towns Committee. As of late 2008, this facility had begun closure processes, being more or less full. Sport Kilcullen GAA is the local Gaelic Athletic Association club, and Kilcullen AFC the local soccer group. The GAA club adjoins, within the Kilcullen Community Centre Sports Complex, near the entrance to Castlemartin Estate, an all-weather pitch, and an 18-hole pitch-and-putt club (St. Brigids). At the opposite side of the town, opposite Hillcrest housing estate, is Kilcullen Tennis Club, in Logstown. There is also a successful badminton club in the area which has both junior and senior members competing in inter-county tournaments and competitions such as the Westside and the county championships. It has a fierce rivalry with Naas badminton club who it competed against in. There is a Sli na Slainte healthy walking route around the area, passing the graveyard, St. Bridget's Well, the bridge and Bishop Rogan's Park. =Breeding and horses= Kilcullen is about from the Curragh, the center of Ireland's horse racing industry and is home to the Aga Khan's horse breeding operation, the Gilltown Stud, and to stud and cattle breeding operations belonging to Tony O'Reilly and his wife. Horse- riding is available, and horses can be stabled locally. =River activities= The area historically enjoyed a number of swimming locales in the Liffey (one at Carnalway, one in The Valley and one opposite Castlemartin House) and walking routes along its banks (at least one of which is a right-of-way), but access has become more difficult in recent years, and a bitter dispute over riverbank access took place at Carnalway from 2005 to 2007, featuring unauthorised construction of fencing and obstruction of rights of way. The Liffey at Kilcullen is known for trout angling and the North Kildare TSAA manages fishing rights from Harristown through to the town centre. Kilcullen is also home to the oldest canoe club in the country. Established in 1957 by Paddy Maloney, it has been the home of Olympic and international kayak athletes. Kilcullen Canoe Club are the current holders of the Irish Marathon Canoeing Cup (aka the Riba De Sella Cup), as well as the Irish Junior Series Cup. On 27 July 2008, the club opened its new clubhouse, just over half a century since the club was started. It is dedicated to the memory of Pat Dunlea, who played a major role in the building and financing of the facility. It lies just upstream of The Bridge and actively encourages locals to get involved. Government and representation (Old) Kilcullen and Kilcullen Bridge, with the Curragh, in context in Co. Kildare, 1838, with exclaves of Co. Dublin to the east and of Co. Offaly to the westKilcullen is within the remit of Kildare County Council; it does not elect councillors for itself or its broader area but parts of the town and surrounds fall within the Naas Local Electoral Area and parts within the Athy Local Electoral Area. For national elections, Kilcullen is today in the Kildare South D√°il constituency. It was controversially, for a period, in a Wicklow constituency. =Local government services= The council operates a covered reservoir almost a kilometre north of the bridge, with outlying areas served by group water schemes (many originally arranged by Kilcullen Community Council).

She started working at the magazine in the 1950s and served as its editor-in-chief between 1971 and 1988. Her eponymously-named publication, Mirabella, was created in 1989 and lasted until 2000 with the financial support of Rupert Murdoch. Early life Mirabella was born in Newark, New Jersey to parents of Italian descent. With a gambler for a father and a feminist mother, Mirabella took her strength and endurance to the fashion world, where she saw fashion as a way to show evidence that a woman can rise to power.\\"Fall of Grace\\", New York Magazine via Google Books; accessed January 30, 2013. She graduated from Skidmore College in June 1950, majoring in economics. Personal life She married Dr. William Cahan in November 1976.In and out of Vogue, Grace Mirabella, Doubleday, 1995; . Career Mirabella began her career by working in a family friend's sportswear shop. After college, she held several junior positions in the retail, including at Macy's as an executive trainee and Saks Fifth Avenue as an assistant to the sales promotion manager. In 1952, when Jessica Daves was editor-in-chief, Mirabella was hired as an assistant at Vogue, where she was rapidly promoted. During most of the 1960s, she held the position as the associate editor-in-chief under Diana Vreeland. Eventually, in 1971, she was promoted to editor in chief. Vogue then received a face lift; the laid-back feel of the 1970s directed her style, and she added a more casual feel that contrasted with the way the magazine had been defined in its earlier years. Due to the recession in the United States in the 1970s, Mirabella used more editorials that addressed affordable yet stylish clothing for women. Mirabella was noted for bringing in and showcasing designs from Halston, Saint Laurent, Geoffrey Beene, and Ralph Lauren. During her tenure at Vogue, she increased revenue to $79.5 million and grew the magazine's circulation to 1.2 million. Conde Nast owner Si Newhouse replaced Mirabella with current editor in chief Anna Wintour in 1988. According to Newhouse biographer Carol Felsenthal, nobody personally told Mirabella about her firing‚Äîshe found out about it through the news.Felsenthal, Carol. Citizen Newhouse: Portrait of a Media Merchant, Seven Stories Press, 1998. There were numerous reasons as to why Newhouse fired Mirabella. However, the main one that circulated and was later discussed in her autobiography, In and Out of Vogue, was that Newhouse wanted to go with a younger looking woman that trusted no one but Newhouse himself. In the 1990s, she published her own magazine, Mirabella, with the financial assistance of Rupert Murdoch. Mirabella was targeted at women in their 30s and 40s, with more focus on lifestyle advice and casual wear. Cover and editorial models were typically lesser-known and had more average proportions.Cronin, M. \\"A Fresh Take on Fashion.\\" Time 137, no. 13 (1991): page 69 Mirabella had 400,000 readers at its start‚Äîits reputation boosted by Mirabella's own pedigree as former editor at Vogue - but in subsequent years readership and revenue fell. Mirabella folded in 2000. Notable work During Mirabella's term as editor in chief of Vogue, the circulation increased from 400,000 copies to 1.2 million. The advertising revenues at the time of her dismissal from Vogue was $79.5 million, to be compared to that of Elle of $39 million.In and out of Vogue, ibid. Her autobiography, In and Out of Vogue, gave insight into her relationships with the various people that she worked with such as Diana Vreeland, Andy Warhol, Jessica Daves and Si Newhouse. Fashion photographer Helmut Newton published several notable editorials in the magazine from 1971 to the end of Mirabella's leadership. Further, Richard Avedon photographed most of the covers and other photographers, such as Patrick Demarchelier, Arthur Elgort, Albert Watson, Denis Piel and Chris von Wangenheim published several examples of their early work in her editions.

The structure of these molecules may be considered at any of several length scales ranging from the level of individual atoms to the relationships among entire protein subunits. This useful distinction among scales is often expressed as a decomposition of molecular structure into four levels: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary. The scaffold for this multiscale organization of the molecule arises at the secondary level, where the fundamental structural elements are the molecule's various hydrogen bonds. This leads to several recognizable domains of protein structure and nucleic acid structure, including such secondary-structure features as alpha helixes and beta sheets for proteins, and hairpin loops, bulges, and internal loops for nucleic acids. The terms primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structure were introduced by Kaj Ulrik Linderstr√∏m-Lang in his 1951 Lane Medical Lectures at Stanford University. Primary structure The primary structure of a biopolymer is the exact specification of its atomic composition and the chemical bonds connecting those atoms (including stereochemistry). For a typical unbranched, un-crosslinked biopolymer (such as a molecule of a typical intracellular protein, or of DNA or RNA), the primary structure is equivalent to specifying the sequence of its monomeric subunits, such as amino acids or nucleotides. Primary structure is sometimes mistakenly termed primary sequence, but there is no such term, as well as no parallel concept of secondary or tertiary sequence. By convention, the primary structure of a protein is reported starting from the amino terminal (N) to the carboxyl terminal (C), while the primary structure of DNA or RNA molecule is reported from the 5' end to the 3' end. The primary structure of a nucleic acid molecule refers to the exact sequence of nucleotides that comprise the whole molecule. Often, the primary structure encodes sequence motifs that are of functional importance. Some examples of such motifs are: the C/D and H/ACA boxes of snoRNAs, LSm binding site found in spliceosomal RNAs such as U1, U2, U4, U5, U6, U12 and U3, the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, the Kozak consensus sequence and the RNA polymerase III terminator. Secondary structure Secondary (inset) and tertiary structure of tRNA demonstrating coaxial stacking ) The secondary structure is the pattern of hydrogen bonds in a biopolymer. These determine the general three-dimensional form of local segments of the biopolymers, but does not describe the global structure of specific atomic positions in three- dimensional space, which are considered to be tertiary structure. Secondary structure is formally defined by the hydrogen bonds of the biopolymer, as observed in an atomic-resolution structure. In proteins, the secondary structure is defined by patterns of hydrogen bonds between backbone amine and carboxyl groups (sidechain‚Äìmainchain and sidechain‚Äìsidechain hydrogen bonds are irrelevant), where the DSSP definition of a hydrogen bond is used. In nucleic acids, the secondary structure is defined by the hydrogen bonding between the nitrogenous bases. For proteins, however, the hydrogen bonding is correlated with other structural features, which has given rise to less formal definitions of secondary structure. For example, helices can adopt backbone dihedral angles in some regions of the Ramachandran plot; thus, a segment of residues with such dihedral angles is often called a helix, regardless of whether it has the correct hydrogen bonds. Many other less formal definitions have been proposed, often applying concepts from the differential geometry of curves, such as curvature and torsion. Structural biologists solving a new atomic-resolution structure will sometimes assign its secondary structure by eye and record their assignments in the corresponding Protein Data Bank (PDB) file. The secondary structure of a nucleic acid molecule refers to the base pairing interactions within one molecule or set of interacting molecules. The secondary structure of biological RNA's can often be uniquely decomposed into stems and loops. Often, these elements or combinations of them can be further classified, e.g. tetraloops, pseudoknots and stem loops. There are many secondary structure elements of functional importance to biological RNA. Famous examples include the Rho-independent terminator stem loops and the transfer RNA (tRNA) cloverleaf. There is a minor industry of researchers attempting to determine the secondary structure of RNA molecules. Approaches include both experimental and computational methods (see also the List of RNA structure prediction software). Tertiary structure The tertiary structure of a protein or any other macromolecule is its three-dimensional structure, as defined by the atomic coordinates. Proteins and nucleic acids fold into complex three-dimensional structures which result in the molecules' functions. While such structures are diverse and complex, they are often composed of recurring, recognizable tertiary structure motifs and domains that serve as molecular building blocks. Tertiary structure is considered to be largely determined by the biomolecule's primary structure (its sequence of amino acids or nucleotides). Quaternary structure The quaternary structure refers to the number and arrangement of multiple protein molecules in a multi-subunit complex. For nucleic acids, the term is less common, but can refer to the higher-level organization of DNA in chromatin, including its interactions with histones, or to the interactions between separate RNA units in the ribosome or spliceosome. Structure determination Structure probing is the process by which biochemical techniques are used to determine biomolecular structure. This analysis can be used to define the patterns that can be used to infer the molecular structure, experimental analysis of molecular structure and function, and further understanding on development of smaller molecules for further biological research. Structure probing analysis can be done through many different methods, which include chemical probing, hydroxyl radical probing, nucleotide analog interference mapping (NAIM), and in-line probing. Protein and nucleic acid structures can be determined using either nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) or X-ray crystallography or single- particle cryo electron microscopy (cryoEM). The first published reports for DNA (by Rosalind Franklin and Raymond Gosling in 1953) of A-DNA X-ray diffraction patterns‚Äîand also B-DNA‚Äîused analyses based on Patterson function transforms that provided only a limited amount of structural information for oriented fibers of DNA isolated from calf thymus. An alternate analysis was then proposed by Wilkins et al. in 1953 for B-DNA X-ray diffraction and scattering patterns of hydrated, bacterial-oriented DNA fibers and trout sperm heads in terms of squares of Bessel functions. Although the B-DNA form' is most common under the conditions found in cells, it is not a well-defined conformation but a family or fuzzy set of DNA conformations that occur at the high hydration levels present in a wide variety of living cells. Their corresponding X-ray diffraction & scattering patterns are characteristic of molecular paracrystals with a significant degree of disorder (over 20%), and the structure is not tractable using only the standard analysis. In contrast, the standard analysis, involving only Fourier transforms of Bessel functions and DNA molecular models, is still routinely used to analyze A-DNA and Z-DNA X-ray diffraction patterns. Structure prediction Saccharomyces cerevisiae tRNA-Phe structure space: the energies and structures were calculated using RNAsubopt and the structure distances computed using RNAdistance. Biomolecular structure prediction is the prediction of the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence, or of a nucleic acid from its nucleobase (base) sequence. In other words, it is the prediction of secondary and tertiary structure from its primary structure. Structure prediction is the inverse of biomolecular design, as in rational design, protein design, nucleic acid design, and biomolecular engineering. Protein structure prediction is one of the most important goals pursued by bioinformatics and theoretical chemistry. Protein structure prediction is of high importance in medicine (for example, in drug design) and biotechnology (for example, in the design of novel enzymes). Every two years, the performance of current methods is assessed in the Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP) experiment. There has also been a significant amount of bioinformatics research directed at the RNA structure prediction problem. A common problem for researchers working with RNA is to determine the three-dimensional structure of the molecule given only the nucleic acid sequence. However, in the case of RNA, much of the final structure is determined by the secondary structure or intra-molecular base-pairing interactions of the molecule. This is shown by the high conservation of base pairings across diverse species. Secondary structure of small nucleic acid molecules is determined largely by strong, local interactions such as hydrogen bonds and base stacking. Summing the free energy for such interactions, usually using a nearest-neighbor method, provides an approximation for the stability of given structure. The most straightforward way to find the lowest free energy structure would be to generate all possible structures and calculate the free energy for them, but the number of possible structures for a sequence increases exponentially with the length of the molecule. For longer molecules, the number of possible secondary structures is vast. Sequence covariation methods rely on the existence of a data set composed of multiple homologous RNA sequences with related but dissimilar sequences. These methods analyze the covariation of individual base sites in evolution; maintenance at two widely separated sites of a pair of base-pairing nucleotides indicates the presence of a structurally required hydrogen bond between those positions. The general problem of pseudoknot prediction has been shown to be NP-complete. Design Biomolecular design can be considered the inverse of structure prediction. In structure prediction, the structure is determined from a known sequence, whereas, in protein or nucleic acid design, a sequence that will form a desired structure is generated. Other biomolecules Other biomolecules, such as polysaccharides, polyphenols and lipids, can also have higher-order structure of biological consequence.

Secondary structure can be predicted from one or several nucleic acid sequences. Tertiary structure can be predicted from the sequence, or by comparative modeling (when the structure of a homologous sequence is known). The problem of predicting nucleic acid secondary structure is dependent mainly on base pairing and base stacking interactions; many molecules have several possible three-dimensional structures, so predicting these structures remains out of reach unless obvious sequence and functional similarity to a known class of nucleic acid molecules, such as transfer RNA (tRNA) or microRNA (miRNA), is observed. Many secondary structure prediction methods rely on variations of dynamic programming and therefore are unable to efficiently identify pseudoknots. While the methods are similar, there are slight differences in the approaches to RNA and DNA structure prediction. In vivo, DNA structures are more likely to be duplexes with full complementarity between two strands, while RNA structures are more likely to fold into complex secondary and tertiary structures such as in the ribosome, spliceosome, or transfer RNA. This is partly because the extra oxygen in RNA increases the propensity for hydrogen bonding in the nucleic acid backbone. The energy parameters are also different for the two nucleic acids. The structure prediction methods can follow a completely theoretical approach, or a hybrid one incorporating experimental data. Single sequence structure prediction A common problem for researchers working with RNA is to determine the three-dimensional structure of the molecule given only a nucleic acid sequence. However, in the case of RNA much of the final structure is determined by the secondary structure or intra-molecular base pairing interactions of the molecule. This is shown by the high conservation of base pairings across diverse species. =The most stable structure= Secondary structure of small RNA molecules is largely determined by strong, local interactions such as hydrogen bonds and base stacking. Summing the free energy for such interactions should provide an approximation for the stability of a given structure. To predict the folding free energy of a given secondary structure, an empirical nearest-neighbor model is used. In the nearest neighbor model the free energy change for each motif depends on the sequence of the motif and of its closest base-pairs. The model and parameters of minimal energy for Watson‚ÄìCrick pairs, GU pairs and loop regions were derived from empirical calorimetric experiments, the most up-to-date parameters were published in 2004, although most software packages use the prior set assembled in 1999. The simplest way to find the lowest free energy structure would be to generate all possible structures and calculate the free energy for it, but the number of possible structures for a sequence increases exponentially with the length of RNA: \`number of secondary structures = (1,8)N, N- number of nucleotides\`. For longer molecules, the number of possible secondary structures is huge: a sequence of 100 nucleotides has more than 1025 possible secondary structures. =Dynamic programming algorithms= Most popular methods for predicting RNA and DNA's secondary structure involve dynamic programming. One of the early attempts at predicting RNA secondary structure was made by Ruth Nussinov and co-workers who developed a dynamic programming-based algorithm that maximized the length and number of a series of \\"blocks\\" (polynucleotide chains). Each \\"block\\" required at least two nucleotides, which reduced the algorithm's storage requirements over single base-matching approaches. Nussinov et al. later published an adapted approach with improved performance that increased the RNA size limit to ~1,000 bases by folding increasingly sized subsections while storing the results of prior folds. In 1981, Michael Zuker and Patrick Stiegler proposed a refined approach with performance comparable to Nussinov et al.'s solution but with the additional ability to find also find \\"suboptimal\\" secondary structures. Dynamic programming algorithms provide a means to implicitly check all variants of possible RNA secondary structures without explicitly generating the structures. First, the lowest conformational free energy is determined for each possible sequence fragment starting with the shortest fragments and then for longer fragments. For longer fragments, recursion on the optimal free energy changes determined for shorter sequences speeds the determination of the lowest folding free energy. Once the lowest free energy of the complete sequence is calculated, the exact structure of RNA molecule is determined. Dynamic programming algorithms are commonly used to detect base pairing patterns that are \\"well-nested\\", that is, form hydrogen bonds only to bases that do not overlap one another in sequence position. Secondary structures that fall into this category include double helices, stem-loops, and variants of the \\"cloverleaf\\" pattern found in transfer RNA molecules. These methods rely on pre-calculated parameters which estimate the free energy associated with certain types of base-pairing interactions, including Watson-Crick and Hoogsteen base pairs. Depending on the complexity of the method, single base pairs may be considered, and short two- or three-base segments, to incorporate the effects of base stacking. This method cannot identify pseudoknots, which are not well nested, without substantial algorithmic modifications that are computationally very costly. =Suboptimal structures= The accuracy of RNA secondary structure prediction from one sequence by free energy minimization is limited by several factors: # The free energy value's list in nearest neighbor model is incomplete # Not all known RNA folds in such a way as to conform with the thermodynamic minimum. # Some RNA sequences have more than one biologically active conformation (i.e., riboswitches) For this reason, the ability to predict structures which have similar low free energy can provide significant information. Such structures are termed suboptimal structures. MFOLD is one program that generates suboptimal structures. =Predicting pseudoknots= One of the issues when predicting RNA secondary structure is that the standard free energy minimization and statistical sampling methods can not find pseudoknots. The major problem is that the usual dynamic programing algorithms, when predicting secondary structure, consider only the interactions between the closest nucleotides, while pseudoknotted structures are formed due to interactions between distant nucleotides. Rivas and Eddy published a dynamic programming algorithm for predicting pseudoknots. However, this dynamic programming algorithm is very slow. The standard dynamic programming algorithm for free energy minimization scales O(N3) in time (N is the number of nucleotides in the sequence), while the Rivas and Eddy algorithm scales O(N6) in time. This has prompted several researchers to implement versions of the algorithm that restrict classes of pseudoknots, resulting in performance gains. For example, pknotsRG tool includes only the class of simple recursive pseudoknots and scales O(N4) in time. =Other approaches for RNA secondary structure prediction= Another approach for RNA secondary structure determination is to sample structures from the Boltzmann ensemble, as exemplified by the program SFOLD. The program generates a statistical sample of all possible RNA secondary structures. The algorithm samples secondary structures according to the Boltzmann distribution. The sampling method offers an appealing solution to the problem of uncertainties in folding. Comparative secondary structure prediction S. cerevisiae tRNA-PHE structure space: the energies and structures were calculated using RNAsubopt and the structure distances computed using RNAdistance. Sequence covariation methods rely on the existence of a data set composed of multiple homologous RNA sequences with related but dissimilar sequences. These methods analyze the covariation of individual base sites in evolution; maintenance at two widely separated sites of a pair of base-pairing nucleotides indicates the presence of a structurally required hydrogen bond between those positions. The general problem of pseudoknot prediction has been shown to be NP-complete. In general, the problem of alignment and consensus structure prediction are closely related. Three different approaches to the prediction of consensus structures can be distinguished: # Folding of alignment # Simultaneous sequence alignment and folding # Alignment of predicted structures =Align then fold= A practical heuristic approach is to use multiple sequence alignment tools to produce an alignment of several RNA sequences, to find consensus sequence and then fold it. The quality of the alignment determines the accuracy of the consensus structure model. Consensus sequences are folded using various approaches similarly as in individual structure prediction problem. The thermodynamic folding approach is exemplified by RNAalifold program. The different approaches are exemplified by Pfold and ILM programs. Pfold program implements a SCFGs. ILM (iterated loop matching) unlike the other algorithms for folding of alignments, can return pseudoknoted structures. It uses combination of thermodynamics and mutual information content scores. =Align and fold= Evolution frequently preserves functional RNA structure better than RNA sequence. Hence, a common biological problem is to infer a common structure for two or more highly diverged but homologous RNA sequences. In practice, sequence alignments become unsuitable and do not help to improve the accuracy of structure prediction, when sequence similarity of two sequences is less than 50%. Structure-based alignment programs improves the performance of these alignments and most of them are variants of the Sankoff algorithm. Basically, Sankoff algorithm is a merger of sequence alignment and Nussinov (maximal-pairing) folding dynamic programming method. Sankoff algorithm itself is a theoretical exercise because it requires extreme computational resources (O(n3m) in time, and O(n2m) in space, where n is the sequence length and m is the number of sequences). Some notable attempts at implementing restricted versions of Sankoff's algorithm are Foldalign, Dynalign, PMmulti/PMcomp, Stemloc, and Murlet. In these implementations the maximal length of alignment or variants of possible consensus structures are restricted. For example, Foldalign focuses on local alignments and restricts the possible length of the sequences alignment. =Fold then align= A less widely used approach is to fold the sequences using single sequence structure prediction methods and align the resulting structures using tree-based metrics. The fundamental weakness with this approach is that single sequence predictions are often inaccurate, thus all further analyses are affected. Tertiary structure prediction Once secondary structure of RNA is known, the next challenge is to predict tertiary structure. The biggest problem is to determine the structure of regions between double stranded helical regions. Also RNA molecules often contain posttranscriptionally modified nucleosides, which because of new possible non-canonical interactions, cause a lot of troubles for tertiary structure prediction. The three-dimensional structure prediction methods can use comparative modeling which starts from a related known structure known as the template. The alternative strategy is de novo modeling of RNA secondary structure which uses physics-based principles such as molecular dynamics or random sampling of the conformational landscape followed by screening with a statistical potential for scoring. These methods either use an all-atom representation of the nucleic acid structure or a coarse- grained representation. The low-resolution structures generated by many of these modeling methods are then subjected to high-resolution refinement.

It was based on the Vauxhall VX Series of 1976 to 1978, itself a development of the Vauxhall Victor FE. When introduced in 1983, it was one of the few Indian manufactured luxury cars in the market. One of its few indigenous competitors was the short-lived Standard 2000 which was based on the Rover SD1 and the Premier 118 NE was based on Fiat 124. The Contessa was a popular choice amongst government officials. History By the late 1970s, HM was ready to introduce a more modern car in the Indian market after having produced the ageing Ambassador for three decades. They were successful in acquiring the production tooling and technology of the Vauxhall VX Series, a car that was phased out in the UK in 1978.Vauxhall V72 Platform - 94000 FE VX Series aka Hindustan Contessa, vauxpedianet.uk2sitebuilder.com Retrieved 5 May 2016 The production line was set up alongside the Ambassador at Uttarpara near Kolkata and the first test cars were ready by 1982. Series production was under way by the spring of 1984. To keep development costs in check, HM Contessa was introduced to the Indian market with the 1.5 L BMC B-Series engine which also powered the Ambassador, in a slightly modified form along with the Hindustan four-speed gearbox. The press was upbeat about the roomy interior and plush ride, but was critical about the grossly underpowered engine and equally primitive gearbox. Top speed was only around , although there was also version with higher 8.3:1 compression which offered . =Isuzu-engine era= Rear of a Contessa Classic 1.8 GL By the late eighties, Hindustan had tied-up with Isuzu of Japan and started manufacturing their 1.8 L 4ZB1 petrol engine and matching five-speed gearbox for installation in the Contessa. The new car was called the Contessa Classic with distinctive \\"CLASSIC\\" and \\"1.8GL\\" badging on the trunk lid. The car was an instant success and set a new standard for refinement, power and luxury in the Indian market. The BMC-engined model was phased out in short order. The car can achieve an increased top speed of 160 km/h. Even though the Contessa was based on a 1970s design, the interior was surprisingly quiet and the seats were extremely comfortable for the passengers. The basic design of Contessa has remained the same throughout its life, though HM made minor updates throughout the life of the model. Numerous features like fuel injection, power windows, power steering, fat bumpers, upgraded headlights, air conditioning, etcetera, were introduced in phases to keep the car appealing to the premium customer. In the 1990s, Hindustan started manufacturing the 2.0 L Isuzu 4FC1 diesel engine that came to power the Contessa Diesel. It as well was an instant success. A turbo diesel version was also introduced a few years later. However, after the advent of more modern cars from GM, Ford, Fiat, Tata etc., the demand for the Contessa began to wane. Maruti Suzuki had grabbed the lion's share of the market and the intense competition between the new auto manufacturers brought modern fuel-efficient cars to the Indian marketplace in the late 1990s. The constant rise of petrol prices was the final nail in the coffin for the now comparably thirsty Contessa, which was phased out in 2002. Towards the end of production, there were three versions of this car; 1.8 GLX (Isuzu petrol), 2.0 DLX (Isuzu diesel) and 2.0 TD (Isuzu turbo diesel).

In asexual organisms, the study of mitotic recombination is one way to understand genetic linkage because it is the only source of recombination within an individual. Additionally, mitotic recombination can result in the expression of recessive genes in an otherwise heterozygous individual. This expression has important implications for the study of tumorigenesis and lethal recessive genes. Mitotic homologous recombination occurs mainly between sister chromatids subsequent to replication (but prior to cell division). Inter-sister homologous recombination is ordinarily genetically silent. During mitosis the incidence of recombination between non-sister homologous chromatids is only about 1% of that between sister chromatids.  Discovery  The discovery of mitotic recombination came from the observation of twin spotting in Drosophila melanogaster. This twin spotting, or mosaic spotting, was observed in D. melanogaster as early as 1925, but it was only in 1936 that Curt Stern explained it as a result of mitotic recombination. Prior to Stern's work, it was hypothesized that twin spotting happened because certain genes had the ability to eliminate the chromosome on which they were located. Later experiments uncovered when mitotic recombination occurs in the cell cycle and the mechanisms behind recombination. Mitotic recombination can result in homozygous expression in a heterozygous individual  Occurrence  Mitotic recombination can happen at any locus but is observable in individuals that are heterozygous at a given locus. If a crossover event between non-sister chromatids affects that locus, then both homologous chromosomes will have one chromatid containing each genotype. The resulting phenotype of the daughter cells depends on how the chromosomes line up on the metaphase plate. If the chromatids containing different alleles line up on the same side of the plate, then the resulting daughter cells will appear heterozygous and be undetectable, despite the crossover event. However, if chromatids containing the same alleles line up on the same side, the daughter cells will be homozygous at that locus. This results in twin spotting, where one cell presents the homozygous recessive phenotype and the other cell has the homozygous wild type phenotype. If those daughter cells go on to replicate and divide, the twin spots will continue to grow and reflect the differential phenotype. Mitotic recombination takes place during interphase. It has been suggested that recombination takes place during G1, when the DNA is in its 2-strand phase, and replicated during DNA synthesis. It is also possible to have the DNA break leading to mitotic recombination happen during G1, but for the repair to happen after replication. =Response to DNA damage= In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mutations in several genes needed for mitotic (and meiotic) recombination cause increased sensitivity to inactivation by radiation and/or genotoxic chemicals.Haynes, R.H. & Kunz, B.A. (1981). DNA repair and mutagenesis in yeast. In: Strathern, J; Jones, E; Broach J. editors. The Molecular Biology of the Yeast Saccharomyces. Life Cycle and Inheritance. Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, 371-414. For example, gene rad52 is required for mitotic recombination as well as meiotic recombination. Rad52 mutant yeast cells have increased sensitivity to killing by X-rays, methyl methanesulfonate and the DNA crosslinking agent 8-methoxypsoralen-plus-UV light, suggesting that mitotic recombinational repair is required for removal of the different DNA damages caused by these agents.  Mechanisms  The mechanisms behind mitotic recombination are similar to those behind meiotic recombination. These include sister chromatid exchange and mechanisms related to DNA double strand break repair by homologous recombination such as single-strand annealing, synthesis- dependent strand annealing (SDSA), and gene conversion through a double- Holliday Junction intermediate or SDSA. In addition, non-homologous mitotic recombination is a possibility and can often be attributed to non-homologous end joining.  Method  There are several theories on how mitotic crossover occurs. In the simple crossover model, the two homologous chromosomes overlap on or near a common Chromosomal fragile site (CFS). This leads to a double- strand break, which is then repaired using one of the two strands. This can lead to the two chromatids switching places. In another model, two overlapping sister chromatids form a double Holliday junction at a common repeat site and are later sheared in such a way that they switch places. In either model, the chromosomes are not guaranteed to trade evenly, or even to rejoin on opposite sides thus most patterns of cleavage do not result in any crossover event. Uneven trading introduces many of the deleterious effects of mitotic crossover. Alternatively, a crossover can occur during DNA repair if, due to extensive damage, the homologous chromosome is chosen to be the template over the sister chromatid. This leads to gene synthesis since one copy of the allele is copied across from the homologous chromosome and then synthesized into the breach on the damaged chromosome. The net effect of this would be one heterozygous chromosome and one homozygous chromosome.  Advantages and disadvantages  Mitotic crossover is known to occur in D. melanogaster, some asexually reproducing fungi and in normal human cells, where the event may allow normally recessive cancer-causing genes to be expressed and thus predispose the cell in which it occurs to the development of cancer. Alternately, a cell may become a homozygous mutant for a tumor-suppressing gene, leading to the same result. For example, Bloom's syndrome is caused by a mutation in RecQ helicase, which plays a role in DNA replication and repair. This mutation leads to high rates of mitotic recombination in mice, and this recombination rate is in turn responsible for causing tumor susceptibility in those mice. At the same time, mitotic recombination may be beneficial: it may play an important role in repairing double stranded breaks, and it may be beneficial to the organism if having homozygous dominant alleles is more functional than the heterozygous state. For use in experimentation with genomes in model organisms such as Drosophila melanogaster, mitotic recombination can be induced via X-ray and the FLP-FRT recombination system.

When safety belt laws are passed, belt wearing rates increase, but casualties decline by smaller percentages than estimated in a simple calculation. This is because those converted from non-use to use are not ‚Äúrecruited‚Äù random members of the driving population. Instead, users differ from non-users in many ways that influence safety. Two effects are: *1. When non-wearers crash, they have more severe crashes. *2. Non-wearers are more likely to crash Illustrative example of effect Say initial belt use was zero (it never is, but this assumption makes it easy to understand), and after a belt law is passed use rate increases to 50%. As belts reduce driver fatality risk in crashes by 42%, a naive calculation would lead one to expect a 21% reduction in fatalities. In fact, a lesser reduction is observed. A somewhat complicated equation (p. 293 of Traffic Safety (book) estimates expected fatality reductions when use rates increase from any initial percent to any new percent. For the case of an increase in belt use from zero to 50%, the calculated reduction in deaths is 16%, well below the 21% estimated from the naive calculation. Diminishes effectiveness of belt wearing laws So even when belt wearing rates reach 90%, the 10% who do not wear have substantially more crashes, and more severe crashes, than the overall population. The 10% of non wearers thus make a far larger contribution to the overall casualty toll than might appear likely if selective recruitment did not occur. Hardly unexpected Belt wearers have been shown in more than a dozen good studies to behave differently from non- wearers. The phenomenon is in many ways obvious and to be expected. When a belt-wearing law is in effect, those not wearing belts are violating traffic law. Someone who does not obey one traffic law is more likely to not obey another ‚Äì hence those who do not use belts are more likely to speed, drive drunk, and so on. Although selective recruitment provides a perfectly reasonable and quantitative explanation for why casualty reductions from belt laws fall short of those computed simply from increased belt use, other explanations that are convincingly refuted by mountains of research persist. The risk compensation explanation claims that the same driver substantially increases risk taking as a consequence of being compelled to wear a belt. Any such interpretation is compelling rejected by simple analyses of innumerable data sets (fatalities, crash-involvement rates, insurance claims). Any behavior change can change the risk of a fatal crash by no more than 5% percent in either direction‚Äîdramatically less than the 42% reduction in fatality risk provided by the belt in a crash. Claims that substantially lower than expected safety benefits from belts are due to drivers changing their behavior as a result of being compelled to wear belts are well outside the solid body of accepted traffic safety knowledge.

Rechargeable liquid-metal batteries are used for industrial power backup, special electric vehicles and for grid energy storage, to balance out intermittent renewable power sources such as solar panels and wind turbines.  History  Thermal batteries originated during World War II when German scientist Georg Otto Erb developed the first practical cells using a salt mixture as an electrolyte. Erb developed batteries for military applications, including the V-1 flying bomb and the V-2 rocket, and artillery fuzing systems. None of these batteries entered field use during the war. Afterwards, Erb was interrogated by British intelligence. His work was reported in \\"The Theory and Practice of Thermal Cells\\". This information was subsequently passed on to the United States Ordnance Development Division of the National Bureau of Standards. When the technology reached the United States in 1946, it was immediately applied to replacing the troublesome liquid-based systems that had previously been used to power artillery proximity fuzes. They were used for ordnance applications (e.g., proximity fuzes) since WWII and later in nuclear weapons. The same technology was studied by Argonne National LaboratoriesA. E.

Auxer, \\"The PB Sodium Sulfur Cell for Satellite Battery Applications\\", 32nd International Power Sources Symposium, Cherry Hill, NJ, June 9‚Äì12, 1986, Proceedings Volume A88-16601, 04-44, Electrochemical Society, Inc., Pennington, NJ, pp. 49‚Äì54. An NaS battery for space use was successfully tested on the space shuttle mission STS-87 in 1997, but the batteries have not been used operationally in space. NaS batteries have been proposed for use in the high-temperature environment of Venus. A consortium formed by TEPCO (Tokyo Electric Power Co.) and NGK (NGK Insulators Ltd.) declared their interest in researching the NaS battery in 1983, and became the primary drivers behind the development of this type ever since. TEPCO chose the NaS battery because all its component elements (sodium, sulfur and ceramics) are abundant in Japan. The first large-scale field testing took place at TEPCO's Tsunashima substation between 1993 and 1996, using 32 MW, 6.6 kV battery banks. Based on the findings from this trial, improved battery modules were developed and were made commercially available in 2000. The commercial NaS battery bank offers: *Capacity : 25‚Äì250 kWh per bank *Efficiency of 87% *Lifetime of 2,500 cycles at 100% depth of discharge (DOD), or 4,500 cycles at 80% DOD =Sodium‚Äìnickel chloride (Zebra) battery= A lower-temperature variant of Molten-salt batteries was the development of the ZEBRA (originally, \\"Zeolite Battery Research Africa\\"; later, the \\"Zero Emissions Batteries Research Activity\\") battery in 1985, originally developed for electric vehicle applications.7.6 The Sodium Nickel Chloride \\"Zebra\\" Battery, Meridian International Research, 2006, p. 104-112. Accessed 2 August 2017. The battery uses NaAlCl4 with Na+-beta-alumina ceramic electrolyte. The battery operates at and uses molten sodium tetrachloroaluminate (), which has a melting point of , as the electrolyte. The negative electrode is molten sodium. The positive electrode is nickel in the discharged state and nickel chloride in the charged state. Because nickel and nickel chloride are nearly insoluble in neutral and basic melts, contact is allowed, providing little resistance to charge transfer. Since both and Na are liquid at the operating temperature, a sodium-conducting Œ≤-alumina ceramic is used to separate the liquid sodium from the molten . The primary elements used in the manufacture of these batteries have much higher worldwide reserves and annual production than lithium. It was invented in 1985 by the Zeolite Battery Research Africa Project (ZEBRA) group at the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) in Pretoria, South Africa. It can be assembled in the discharged state, using NaCl, Al, nickel and iron powder. The positive electrode is composed mostly of materials in the solid state, which reduces the likelihood of corrosion, improving safety. Its specific energy is 100 Wh/kg; specific power is 150 W/kg. The Œ≤-alumina solid ceramic is unreactive to sodium metal and sodium aluminum chloride. Lifetimes of over 2,000 cycles and twenty years have been demonstrated with full-sized batteries, and over 4,500 cycles and fifteen years with 10- and 20-cell modules. For comparison, LiFePO4 lithium iron phosphate batteries store 90‚Äì110 Wh/kg, and the more common LiCoO2 lithium-ion batteries store 150‚Äì200 Wh/kg. A nano lithium-titanate battery stores 72 Wh/kg and can provide power of 760 W/kg.Lithium-titanate datasheet. The ZEBRA's liquid electrolyte freezes at , and the normal operating temperature range is . Adding iron to the cell increases its power response. ZEBRA batteries are currently manufactured by FZSoNick and used as a power backup in the telecommunication industries, Oil&Gas; and Railways. It is also used in special electric vehicles used in mining. In the past it was adopted in the Modec Electric Van, the Iveco Daily 3.5 ton delivery vehicle,, the prototype Smart ED, and the Th!nk City. In 2011 the US Postal Service began testing all-electric delivery vans, one powered by a ZEBRA battery. In 2010 General Electric announced a battery that it called a sodium‚Äìmetal halide battery, with a 20-year lifetime. Its cathode structure consists of a conductive nickel network, molten salt electrolyte, metal current collector, carbon felt electrolyte reservoir and the active sodium‚Äìmetal halide salts. In 2015, as a result of a global restructuring, the company abandoned the project. In 2017 Chinese battery maker Chilwee Group (also known as Chaowei) has created a new company with General Electric (GE) to bring to market a Na-NiCl battery for industrial and energy storage applications. When not in use, batteries are typically kept molten and ready for use because if allowed to solidify they typically take twelve hours to reheat and charge. This reheating time varies depending on the battery-pack temperature, and power available for reheating. After shutdown a fully charged battery pack loses enough energy to cool and solidify in five-to-seven days. Sodium metal chloride batteries are very safe; a thermal runaway can be activated only by piercing the battery and also, in this unlikely event, no fire or explosion will be generated. For this reason and also for the possibility to be installed outdoor without cooling systems, make the sodium metal chloride batteries very suitable for the industrial and commercial energy storage installations. Sumitomo studied a battery using a salt that is molten at , far lower than sodium based batteries, and operational at . It offers energy densities as high as 290 Wh/L and 224 Wh/kg and charge/discharge rates of 1C with a lifetime of 100 - 1000 charge cycles. The battery employs only nonflammable materials and neither ignites on contact with air nor risks thermal runaway. This eliminates waste-heat storage or fire- and explosion- proof equipment, and allows closer cell packing. The company claimed that the battery required half the volume of lithium-ion batteries and one quarter that of sodium‚Äìsulfur batteries. The cell used a nickel cathode and a glassy carbon anode. In 2014 researchers identified a liquid sodium‚Äìcesium alloy that operates at and produced 420 milliampere-hours per gram. The new material was able to fully coat, or \\"wet,\\" the electrolyte. After 100 charge/discharge cycles, a test battery maintained about 97% of its initial storage capacity. The lower operating temperature allowed the use of a less-expensive polymer external casing instead of steel, offsetting some of the increased cost of cesium. =Liquid-metal batteries= Professor Donald Sadoway at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has pioneered the research of liquid- metal rechargeable batteries. Both magnesium‚Äìantimony and more recently lead‚Äìantimony were used in experiments at MIT. The electrode and electrolyte layers are heated until they are liquid and self-segregate due to density and immiscibility. They may have longer lifetimes than conventional batteries, as the electrodes go through a cycle of creation and destruction during the charge‚Äìdischarge cycle, which makes them immune to the degradation that afflicts conventional battery electrodes. The technology was proposed in 2009 based on magnesium and antimony separated by a molten salt.Staff (2012) Ambri Technology Ambri company web page, Retrieved 6 December 2012. Magnesium was chosen as the negative electrode for its low cost and low solubility in the molten-salt electrolyte. Antimony was selected as the positive electrode due to its low cost and higher anticipated discharge voltage. In 2011, the researchers demonstrated a cell with a lithium anode and a lead‚Äìantimony cathode, which had higher ionic conductivity and lower melting points (350‚Äì430 ¬∞C). The drawback of the Li chemistry is higher cost. A Li/LiF + LiCl + LiI/Pb-Sb cell with about 0.9 V open-circuit potential operating at 450 ¬∞C had electroactive material costs of US$100/kWh and US$100/kW and a projected 25-year lifetime. Its discharge power at 1.1 A/cm2 is only 44% (and 88% at 0.14 A/cm2). Experimental data shows 69% storage efficiency, with good storage capacity (over 1000 mAh/cm2), low leakage (< 1 mA/cm2) and high maximal discharge capacity (over 200 mA/cm2). By October 2014 the MIT team achieved an operational efficiency of approximately 70% at high charge/discharge rates (275 mA/cm2), similar to that of pumped-storage hydroelectricity and higher efficiencies at lower currents. Tests showed that after 10 years of regular use, the system would retain about 85% of its initial capacity. In September 2014, a study described an arrangement using a molten alloy of lead and antimony for the positive electrode, liquid lithium for the negative electrode; and a molten mixture of lithium salts as the electrolyte. In 2010, the Liquid Metal Battery Corporation (LMBC) was formed to commercialize the liquid-metal battery technology invented at MIT. LMBC was renamed Ambri in 2012; the name \\"Ambri\\" is derived from \\"cAMBRIdge\\" Massachusetts, where the company is headquartered and where MIT is located. In 2012 and 2014, Ambri received $40 million in funding from Bill Gates, Khosla Ventures, Total S.A., and GVB. In September 2015, Ambri announced a layoff, pushing back commercial sales. but announced a return to the battery business with a redesigned battery in 2016.Eric Wesoff, \\"Ambri Returns to the Energy Storage Hunt With Liquid Metal Battery Redesign\\", Green Tech Media, December 14, 2016. Accessed 2 August 2017. A recent innovation is the PbBi alloy which enables a very low melting point lithium based battery. It uses a molten salt electrolyte based on LiCl-LiI and operates at 410 ¬∞C.  Thermal batteries (non-rechargeable)  =Technologies= Thermal batteries use an electrolyte that is solid and inactive at ambient temperatures. They can be stored indefinitely (over 50 years) yet provide full power in an instant when required. Once activated, they provide a burst of high power for a short period (a few tens of seconds to 60 minutes or more), with output ranging from watts to kilowatts. The high power is due to the high ionic conductivity of the molten salt, which is three orders of magnitude (or more) greater than that of the sulfuric acid in a lead‚Äìacid car battery. One design uses a fuze strip (containing barium chromate and powdered zirconium metal in a ceramic paper) along the edge of the heat pellets to initiate burning. The fuze strip is typically fired by an electrical igniter or squib by application of electric current. Another design uses a central hole in the middle of the battery stack, into which the high- energy electrical igniter fires a mixture of hot gases and incandescent particles. This allows much shorter activation times (tens of milliseconds) vs. hundreds of milliseconds for the edge-strip design. Battery activation can be accomplished by a percussion primer, similar to a shotgun shell. The heat source should be gasless. The standard heat source typically consists of mixtures of iron powder and potassium perchlorate in weight ratios of 88/12, 86/14, or 84/16. The higher the potassium perchlorate level, the higher the heat output (nominally 200, 259, and 297 cal/g respectively). This property of unactivated storage has the double benefit of avoiding deterioration of the active materials during storage and eliminating capacity loss due to self- discharge until the battery is activated. In the 1980s lithium-alloy anodes replaced calcium or magnesium anodes, with cathodes of calcium chromate, vanadium or tungsten oxides. Lithium‚Äìsilicon alloys are favored over the earlier lithium‚Äìaluminium alloys. The corresponding cathode for use with the lithium-alloy anodes is mainly iron disulfide (pyrite) replaced by cobalt disulfide for high-power applications. The electrolyte is normally a eutectic mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride. More recently, other lower-melting, eutectic electrolytes based on lithium bromide, potassium bromide, and lithium chloride or lithium fluoride have also been used to provide longer operational lifetimes; they are also better conductors. The so- called \\"all-lithium\\" electrolyte based on lithium chloride, lithium bromide, and lithium fluoride (no potassium salts) is also used for high-power applications, because of its high ionic conductivity. A radioisotope thermal generator, such as in the form of pellets of 90SrTiO4, can be used for long- term delivery of heat for the battery after activation, keeping it in a molten state. =Uses= Thermal batteries are used almost exclusively for military applications, notably for guided missiles. They are the primary power source for many missiles such as the AIM-9 Sidewinder, MIM-104 Patriot, BGM-71 TOW, BGM-109 Tomahawk and others. In these batteries the electrolyte is immobilized when molten by a special grade of magnesium oxide that holds it in place by capillary action. This powdered mixture is pressed into pellets to form a separator between the anode and cathode of each cell in the battery stack. As long as the electrolyte (salt) is solid, the battery is inert and remains inactive. Each cell also contains a pyrotechnic heat source, which is used to heat the cell to the typical operating temperature of 400‚Äì550 ¬∞C.

The piano arrangement of this play's most famous melody, El c√≥ndor pasa, was legally registered on May 3, 1933, by The Edward B. Marks Music Corporation with the United States' Library of Congress under the number 9643. This zarzuela is written in prose and consists of one musical play and two acts. The eponymous piece, performed during the zarzuela's parade scene, has no lyrics. In July 2013, the Colectivo Cultural Centenario El C√≥ndor Pasa (cultural association) re-edited the original script, which had been lost for some time, as a CD containing the dialogues and seven musical pieces. The music from the original score was reconstructed by musicologist Luis Salazar Mej√≠a, with the collaboration of musicians Daniel Dorival and Claude Ferrier, and it was performed on November 14, 15 and 16, 2013, at the Teatro UNI in Lima to commemorate the masterpiece's first centenary. All of the work done to recover and re-release the zarzuela (including the CD) was possible thanks to the efforts of musicologist Luis Salazar Mej√≠a and cultural promoter Mario Cerr√≥n Fetta (members of the above-mentioned cultural association), and was carried out without any public financial support. The zarzuela's famous eponymous melody is considered the second national anthem of Peru. It is based on the traditional Andean music of Peru, which was declared an element of National Cultural Heritage in 2004. There are probably more than 400 versions of the piece by artists from around the world, at least 300 of which have lyrics.

Plot The story takes place in the early twentieth century in Y√°pac, a mining settlement in the Peruvian Andes. Act 1 The first scene begins with the Prelude. It is before dawn and Y√°pac's miners are heading to work. A male choir is performing a mournful song \\"En la nieve de las cumbres\\" (\\"On the Snow of the Peaks\\"). At the end of the song some miners fall behind while listening to the shepherd playing the quena (traditional flute of the Andes); they watch him disappear among the clouds that surround the peaks with admiration, and they envy his freedom. Frank is a young miner who does not accept the mine owners' abuse. \\"Something tells me that life isn't this way\\", Frank says, but the other miners accuse him of being ungrateful to the patrones. In the second scene, Juanacha and Ruperto (two shepherds) enter the stage. Ruperto is playfully chasing Juanacha, whom he is about to marry. Everyone leaves the stage but Frank, who performs a melancholic yarav√≠ (song) \\"Pobre alma prisionera\\" (\\"Poor Captive Soul\\") while he reflects on his identity, appearance, and feelings. In the third scene, mine owners Mr. King and Mr. Cup enter the stage chatting, when they see Frank sitting on a rock outside the gallery. Mr. King questions Frank and tells him to get back inside the mine after a brief altercation. Mr. King and Mr. Cup continue their conversation after Frank leaves. During the fourth scene Mr. King forces the four miners to exit the gallery with gunfire. He asks briefly about their progress and sends them back in. Tension grows between Frank and Mr. King. Mar√≠a enters on stage out of breath, bringing liquor to Mr. King. They talk about Frank, and Mar√≠a tries to intercede for her son. It is revealed that Mr. King is Frank's biological father. Mar√≠a and King sing together \\"Perd√≥nalo, taita\\" (\\"Forgive Him, Father\\"), and Mr. King finally agrees not to punish the boy, swayed by the passion he feels towards Mar√≠a. They leave together, while Higinio, Mar√≠a's husband, comes out of the gallery and furiously acknowledges his anger towards his bosses and plots his revenge. Act 2 Outside the mine, a feast is being held in honor of Ruperto and Juanacha's wedding that is going to take place in the town. During a cachua (dance), the sky darkens; a storm will begin soon and the couple will be unable to reach the town to get married. Everyone prays to the Virgin, singing \\"Dulce reina de las cumbres\\" (\\"Sweet Queen of the Peaks\\") and miraculously the sun shines again. The couple and friends head to town, dancing (parade), except for the miners who can not leave work. It is during this scene that the tune \\"El condor pasa\\" is played. During the party, Mr. King has too much to drink, and cruelly abuses Higinio. When Mr. King leaves, Higinio follows him on a higher path, and pushes a boulder onto him when they reach a gorge, causing his death. A shepherd witnesses the horrible murder and tells the other miners about it. Higinio admits it all; Mar√≠a weeps inconsolably over the tragedy that has struck her family; and the miners fear for their lives. The other mine owner, Mr. Cup, arrives gun in hand looking for the murderer. Frank faces him, defending Higinio and his friends, and kills him. Everyone is horrified at these events. The appearance of a condor, the first one after many years, is seen as a sign of a new life of freedom and they are filled with hope. \\"We are all condors\\", the miners shout joyfully. Covers and adaptations The pieces were originally written for orchestra, not for Andean instruments. The most famous parts, such as the prelude, parade, and cachua, have been adapted from the piano arrangement that Daniel Alom√≠a Robles sold to The Edward B. Marks Music Corp., in New York, by the Colectivo Cultural Centenario El C√≥ndor Pasa in 1933. All of the pieces are exempt from copyright license fees due to the time elapsed since they were registered. =Paul Simon's cover= In 1965, American artist Paul Simon listened to the version of the parade tune performed by Los Incas in the Th√©√¢tre de l'Est Parisien (Paris). Simon asked the band permission to include a cover version of the song on an album. The band advised him that the piece belonged to Andean folklore, while the arrangement was Jorge Milchberg's (director of Los Incas). Milchberg is represented as the arrangement's co-author because he added two notes which entitled him to collect royalties. In 1970, Simon & Garfunkel covered the Los Incas' version under the name \\"El C√≥ndor Pasa\\" (\\"If I Could\\"), adding English lyrics written by Simon, and included it in the album Bridge Over Troubled Water. Daniel Alom√≠a Robles was not listed in the credits as the piece's original composer, because it was considered an Andean folk melody. Simon was listed as the author of the lyrics; nobody was given credit for the melody. This cover achieved worldwide fame, and has itself been covered multiple times, its lyrics translated into multiple languages. Even Armando Robles Godoy, the composer's son and Peruvian filmmaker, wrote new lyrics for the song using Paul Simon's version as a reference. =Other versions= Renowned Argentinean guitarist and composer Eduardo Fal√∫ also adapted the song for solo guitar. Many other exceptional covers belong to Peruvian guitar players including: Ra√∫l Garc√≠a Z√°rate, Manuelcha Prado, and Mario Orozco C√°ceres. There is also a cover from the song sung by Trini L√≥pez, and another cover in Chinese by Teresa Teng. There are covers by Peruvian singers including: Yma S√∫mac, and Roxsana and Kesia Rivera with different lyrics. Famous singers Pl√°cido Domingo, Celia Cruz, Marc Anthony, Jos√© Feliciano, and Esther Ofarim also have their own covers of the song.

After the \\"Tomozuru Incident\\" of 1934 and \\"IJN 4th Fleet Incident\\" in 1935, Y≈´gure underwent extensive design changes and modifications prior to launch to remedy these issues. Y≈´gure was laid down at Maizuru Naval Arsenal in Maizuru, Kyoto on 9 April 1933, launched on 6 May 1934 and commissioned on 30 March 1935. Operational history At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Y≈´gure was assigned to Destroyer Division 27 of Destroyer Squadron 1 of the IJN 1st Fleet together with her sister ships , , and , and was based at Hashirajima in Japanese home waters on anti-submarine patrol. In January 1942, Y≈´gure escorted aircraft carriers and to Palau and to Ambon during the invasion of the Netherlands East Indies, and was a participant in the Darwin air raid of 19 February 1942. Afterwards, she was based at Staring Bay, in Sulawesi from which she conducted escort patrol missions to the end of March. She returned to Sasebo Naval Arsenal for repairs from 22 March to 15 April 1942. At the end of April, she went to Truk as part of the escort for the aircraft carriers and and was part of Admiral Takagi's force at the Battle of the Coral Sea. In May, Y≈´gure was assigned escort the cruisers and back to Kure. During the Battle of Midway, she was part of the escort for the Aleutian diversionary force under Admiral Shir≈ç Takasu. Reassigned to the IJN 2nd Fleet on 14 July, she was then detached for temporary duty with the IJN 4th Fleet in a sortie from Truk to Jaluit on 20 August. After bombarding Ocean Island on 23 August, a landing party from Y≈´gure occupied that island on 26 August as part of \\"Operation RY\\" until relieved by a garrison force on 30 August. Y≈´gure was then assigned to the Solomon Islands, participating in numerous Tokyo Express high speed transport runs throughout the Solomon Islands through January 1943. Although she did not participate in the First Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, she assisted in rescue operations afterwards, taking on crew from the stricken battleship After returning to Sasebo for repairs through the middle of January 1943, Y≈´gure escorted a convoy to Tsingtao, and from there to Palau and Wewak by the end of February. She escorted another convoy from Truk to Wewak and back to Yokosuka in March and again in May. She returned to Truk at the end of the month as escort for the carrier , returning with the battleship at the end of May. In early June, she escorted the aircraft carrier to Truk, and returned with the same damaged ship a few days later. In late June, she escorted the carrier from Yokosuka to Truk. In early June, she was assigned to cover troop transport runs to Kolombangara.

He was noted for dominating the challenges, with an unbroken string winning five immunity challenges and four reward challenges. He was also the first contestant to find a hidden immunity idol at Exile Island. However, because of his prowess in the immunity challenges, he never had to play it. Deitz finished in third place, behind Aras Baskauskas (winner) and Danielle DiLorenzo (runner-up). With five consecutive immunity challenge wins, Deitz is currently tied with Colby Donaldson of Survivor: The Australian Outback for the record of the highest-amount of consecutive immunity challenge wins in Survivor history. He is also tied with Donaldson, Tom Westman, Ozzy Lusth, Mike Holloway, and Brad Culpepper for the record of most immunity challenge wins in a season overall. Also, with four additional reward challenge wins, Deitz is tied with Holloway for the record of the highest amount of overall post-merge challenge wins in a single season. However, he is the only one of these five individuals to have never reached the finals. After his appearance on Survivor: Panama, Deitz was considered as one of the ten past castaways to return for the 16th season, Survivor: Micronesia, but was ultimately cut. He was also considered to return for the 27th season, Survivor: Blood vs. Water, where he would have competed alongside his daughter, but was cut from consideration since his daughter was then under the minimum age requirement. =Cambodia= On May 6, 2015, it was revealed that Deitz was one of the 16 men eligible to be voted in by viewers for Survivor's 31st season, Survivor: Cambodia. He was one of two representatives on the ballot from Panama, the other being Shane Powers. It was later revealed that Deitz and Powers had formed a pre-game alliance consisting of themselves, Jeff Varner (from Survivor: The Australian Outback) and Kelly Wiglesworth (from Survivor: Borneo). Although Powers did not make it onto the season, the other three members all were voted in and originally were placed on the same tribe, Ta Keo. After the tribal split on Day 7, from two tribes to three, Deitz was one of only two contestants who remained on the Ta Keo tribe, the other being Kelley Wentworth. On Day 10, Deitz won second place for his tribe in the \\"heroes duel\\" reward challenge.

This was the first Looney Tunes compilation film to center on Daffy Duck, as the previous ones had centered on Bugs Bunny. A note in the end credits dedicates the film to animator and story man, John Dunn, \\"who inspired it.\\" Dunn died of heart failure in San Fernando, California on January 17, 1983; six months before the film's release. Plot The premise of the framing animation was a general parody of the popular 1970s/1980s television series Fantasy Island, with Daffy and Speedy playing caricatures of that series' principal characters, Mr. Roarke and Tattoo (respectively). The pair, stranded on a desert island for months with nothing on it but a coconut tree (and Daffy sick and tired of eating coconuts), discover a treasure map which leads them to a magical, talking wishing well (voiced by Les Tremayne). The greedy Daffy proposes to use the power of the well, which obeys the commands of whoever holds the map. Rather than simply wishing for a heap of wealth, Daffy figures he can make himself and Speedy rich by transforming the barren island into a verdant tourist paradise and selling other people wishes for a hefty fee. Speedy and Daffy attire themselves in the white suits worn by Tattoo and Roarke in the television show, with Speedy exclaiming \\"da plane, da plane\\" as an airplane carrying various Looney Tunes characters arrives on the island. As the customers step up for their chance at the well, their wishes are fulfilled through the events of a classic Looney Tunes cartoon. Meanwhile, Yosemite Sam, cast as a pirate, and his first mate, the Tasmanian Devil, search for the map, which originally belonged to them (they had earlier lost their ship in a battle with Bugs Bunny). They eventually find out that Daffy took it (the two pirates had a single black feather for a clue). In their pursuit of Daffy and Speedy, Sam inadvertently chases the former into volcanic soil. The map is lost to all because of this, causing the island to revert to what it once was and Daffy, Speedy, Sam, and Taz end up trapped on the once- again-deserted island. The well gives them three wishes individually, but warns them to use them wisely for they are the last wishes it will ever grant. After Daffy and Speedy waste their wishes -Speedy wishing for a burrito, then Daffy angrily responding by wishing the burrito was stuck on the end of Speedy's nose- Daffy asks Sam to wish the burrito off Speedy's nose, but discovers that Sam already wished for a ship, abandoning Daffy and telling them after he sinks Bugs, he'll come back and pick the pair up. Daffy (now furious) then shouts his catchphrase at Sam and Taz. The film concludes with the wishing well doing the famed \\"That's all, folks!\\" sign-off. Classic cartoons in order The following includes the Well's descriptions of each cartoon (except for the first one) in relation to that character's wish. Some cartoons are abridged. * Captain Hareblower (Pirate Sam vs. Bugs Bunny) * Stupor Duck (Daffy's wish): The Well: \\"Your fondest wish, your fondest dream. I'll make you Super Duck Supreme!\\" * Greedy for Tweety (Granny's wish, slightly extended): The Well: \\"Your wish shall be granted. Gaze into me and see. The next time that you see yourself, a nurse is what you'll be.\\" * Banty Raids (Foghorn's wish, shortened): The Well: \\"I am here to grant your wish; the Spirit of the Well. I will knock the cockiness out of that little cockerel!\\" After this one, Foghorn, believing he was hornswoggled, demands a refund, but gets another penny. * Louvre Come Back to Me! (Pep√© Le Pew's wish, shortened): The Well: \\"I grant your wish to meet a girl of beauty unsurpassed, which, when compared with works of art, will leave the Louvre outclassed.\\" * Tree for Two (Spike and Chester's wish): The Well: \\"If that's his wish, and yours alike, I'll make Chester brave and strong, like Spike.\\" * Curtain Razor (Porky Pig's wish, shortened with altered opening): The Well: \\"Discovering new talent for the world to see; a wondrous thing for a producer to be...\\" * A Mouse Divided (Sylvester's wife's wish, the opening with the drunken stork is omitted and the ending was changed to occur on the island): Sylvester's wife: \\"Wishing Well. Oh, Wishing Well, you I do entreat. I wish our house would resound to... the patter of little feet.\\" The Well: \\"I hear your wish and I obey. The patter of little feet you shall hear this day.\\" (Sylvester's wife's wish is included in the description because she, like the Well, speaks it in rhyme.) * Of Rice and Hen & Lovelorn Leghorn (Prissy's wish, with the opening of the former and the plot of the latter): The Well: \\"Your mind is such a simple thing, your wish I can foretell: you're wishing for a husband, and the ring of a wedding bell?\\" * From Hare to Heir (Pirate Sam's wish, final wish to show a classic Looney Tunes cartoon): The Well: \\"A very rich relative in poor health doth will to you his entire wealth.\\" Merchandise In 1981, a puzzle showing 105 Looney Tunes characters was issued. Among the characters there are three that never appeared in animation, identified as Hoppy, Hysterical Hyram and Minniesoda Fats. In one scene in Daffy Duck's Fantastic Island Hoppy and Hysterical Hyram are seen waiting for their chance to make their dreams come true (along with two other unidentified characters, namely a white dog and a small mouse with a hat).

Legal impossibility arises when the act, if completed, would not be a crime.Criminal Law - Cases and Materials, 7th ed. 2012, Wolters Kluwer Law & Business; John Kaplan (law professor), Robert Weisberg, Guyora Binder, , A person believes she is committing a crime, but the act is, in fact, lawful. For example, a person may believe she is receiving stolen goods, but the goods are in fact not stolen. A different form of legal impossibility (known as \\"hybrid legal impossibility\\") comes into play when an actor's goal is illegal, but commission of the crime is impossible due to a factual mistake regarding the legal status of one of the attendant circumstances of one of the elements of the crime. For example, a man attempting to bribe someone whom he mistakenly believes is a juror is not liable for attempted bribery of a juror. On the other hand, some jurisdictions may find the actor guilty of attempt. For example, under the US Model Penal Code, the defendant can be guilty of the attempted crime if the facts being the way she thought they were would indeed make it a crime; however, she would not be guilty of the completed crime, because the crime was never completed.

By 1934, Zhang had made enough money to create his own movie studio named \\"Xinhua\\" or \\"New China.\\"Fu, p. 5 Zhang proved to be an excellent promoter, and within three years, Xinhua had transformed from a minor newcomer to a major industry player. After the Battle of Shanghai in 1937, Xinhua remained the only major production company still active in what became known as the \\"Solitary Island\\" period of Chinese film (in that the foreign concessions of Shanghai were an \\"island\\" within the \\"sea\\" of Japanese occupation). It was eventually joined by two major competitors, Guohua Film Company (established from the remnants of Mingxing, whose studio had been destroyed by Japanese bombing) and Yan Chuntang's Yihua Film Company, which had closed after the occupation but reopened in May 1938.Fu, p. 9-10 In 1938, the film company was split into two subsidiaries, Huacheng and Huaxin because of a franchise agreement with distributors.Fu, p. 9 In 1939, Zhang incorporated Xinhua into an American owned company named Zhongguo lianhe or \\"China United Pictures\\" (not to be confused with \\"United China\\", a common translation of the unrelated Lianhua Film Company or \\"China United Productions, Ltd., Xinhua's eventual successor).Fu, p. 22 This was done mainly to escape from Japanese meddling of Xinhua business.

After the intersection with Starkey Road, SR 806 divides back into four lanes, as it enters an interchange with Florida's Turnpike (unsigned SR 91). West Atlantic Avenue first intersects with the entranceway and exit ramp from the turnpike southbound and continues eastward over a stream. After passing under the eight lanes of the Turnpike, SR 806 intersects with the ramp to the northbound lanes. After leaving the large interchange with the turnpike, the highway continues eastward along the country clubs in Delray Beach, beginning with an intersection to the Lexington Club on the eastbound lanes.

After crossing the tracks at-grade, SR 806 and West Atlantic interchange with I-95 (unsigned SR 9). The highway crosses through the partial cloverleaf and crosses under the ten lanes of I-95. SR 806 (Atlantic Avenue) through downtown Delray Beach After the interchange with I-95, West Atlantic Avenue continues eastward, entering downtown Delray Beach, where the highway begins intersecting with numbered local streets now as a four-lane boulevard. The surroundings become a mix of residences and commercial industries until NW 6th Avenue, when it becomes purely commercial. SR 806 passes to the south of the Delray Beach Tennis Center and its lanes begin to merge as the highway approaches the intersection with Swinton Avenue. At Swinton Avenue, West Atlantic Avenue changes names to East Atlantic Avenue, and SR 806 continues eastward along East Atlantic. Also at the intersection with Swinton Avenue, SR 806 narrows to a two lane undivided avenue. At this point, the state has relinquished control of East Atlantic to the city of Delray Beach, and the segment is not part of SR 806\\\\. At the intersection with North Railroad Avenue, the road crosses the Florida East Coast Railroad and continues through downtown Delray Beach. At the intersection with NE 5th Avenue, East Atlantic Avenue intersects with US 1 (unsigned SR 5) southbound, where the state regains control of the road and SR 806 resumes. A block later, the route intersects the US 1 northbound lanes (NE 6th Avenue). SR 806 widens to a four lane undivided avenue for the remainder of East Atlantic. After US 1, the highway continues eastward, crossing Veterans Park and then crossing over Intracoastal Waterway on a large drawbridge. After the drawbridge, East Atlantic Avenue continues eastward, passing several high-rise residences until terminating at an intersection with SR A1A in Delray Beach, along the Atlantic Ocean. History State Road 806 was established in the 1945 renumbering as a road extending from US 441 /SR 7 to US 1 / SR 5 in Delray Beach, and extended to SR A1A at a later point. Prior to the 1945 renumbering, it was State Road 198.Routes 800‚Äì809 Retrieved April 13, 2010 Major intersections References External links * 806 806 ","title":"Florida State Road 806"},{"id":"5055130","text":"Metalist may refer to: * Metalist, a village in Slovianoserbsk Raion, Ukraine. * FC Metalist Kharkiv, Ukrainian football club * Metalist Stadium, multi- purpose sport stadium in Kharkiv, Ukraine * Metadata, in some contexts referred to as a metalist or as a meta-list * Metalhead, member of heavy metal subculture ","title":"Metalist"},{"id":"5055135","text":"Psi Capricorni, Latinized from œà Capricorni, is a single star in the southern zodiac constellation of Capricornus.

Such a thermal battery (a.k.a. TBat) allows energy available at one time to be temporarily stored and then released at another time. The basic principles involved in a thermal battery occur at the atomic level of matter, with energy being added to or taken from either a solid mass or a liquid volume which causes the substance's temperature to change. Some thermal batteries also involve causing a substance to transition thermally through a phase transition which causes even more energy to be stored and released due to the delta enthalpy of fusion or delta enthalpy of vaporization.  History of thermal batteries  Thermal batteries are very common, and include such familiar items as a hot water bottle. Early examples of thermal batteries include stone and mud cook stoves, rocks placed in fires, and kilns. While stoves and kilns are ovens, they are also thermal storage systems that depend on heat being retained for an extended period of time.  Types of thermal batteries  Thermal batteries generally fall into 4 categories with different forms and applications, although fundamentally all are for the storage and retrieval of thermal energy. They also differ in method and density of heat storage. = Phase change thermal battery = Phase change materials used for thermal storage are capable of storing and releasing significant thermal capacity at the temperature that they change phase. These materials are chosen based on specific applications because there is a wide range of temperatures that may be useful in different applications and a wide range of materials that change phase at different temperatures. These materials include salts and waxes that are specifically engineered for the applications they serve. In addition to manufactured materials, water is a phase change material. The latent heat of water is 334 joules/gram. The phase change of water occurs at 0¬∞C (32¬∞F). Some applications use the thermal capacity of water or ice as cold storage; others use it as heat storage. It can serve either application; ice can be melted to store heat then refrozen to warm an environment which is below freezing (putting liquid water at 0¬∞C in such an environment warms it much more than the same mass of ice at the same temperature, because the latent heat of freezing is extracted from it, which is why the phase change is relevant), or water can be frozen to \\"store cold\\" then melted to make an environment above freezing colder (and again, a given mass of ice at 0¬∞C will provide more cooling than the same mass of water at the same temperature). The advantage of using a phase change in this way is that a given mass of material can absorb a large quantity of energy without its temperature changing. Hence a thermal battery that uses a phase change can be made lighter, or more energy can be put into it without raising the internal temperature unacceptably. = Encapsulated thermal battery = An encapsulated thermal battery is physically similar to a phase change thermal battery in that it is a confined amount of physical material which is thermally heated or cooled to store or extract energy. However, in a non-phase change encapsulated thermal battery the temperature of the substance is changed without inducing a phase change. Since a phase change is not needed many more materials are available for use in an encapsulated thermal battery. One of the key properties of an encapsulated thermal battery is its volumetric heat capacity (VHC), also termed volume- specific heat capacity. Typical substances used for these thermal batteries include water, concrete, and wet sand. An example of an encapsulated thermal battery is a residential water heater with a storage tank.Your home water heater may soon double as a battery, Washington Post, February 24, 2016, By Chris MooneyThe Hidden Battery: Opportunities in Electric Water Heating, The Brattle Group, Prepared for the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA) and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), January 2016, by Ryan Hledik, Judy Chang, Roger Lueken This thermal battery is usually slowly charged over a period of about 30‚Äì60 minutes for rapid use when needed (e.g., 10‚Äì15 minutes). Many utilities, understanding the \\"thermal battery\\" nature of water heaters, have begun using them to absorb excess renewable energy power when available for later use by the homeowner. According to the above cited article, \\"net savings to the electricity system as a whole could be $200 per year per heater ‚Äì some of which may be passed on to its owner\\". = GHEX thermal battery - unencapsulated = A ground heat exchanger (GHEX) is an area of the earth that is utilized as a seasonal/annual cycle thermal battery. These thermal batteries are areas of the earth into which pipes have been placed in order to transfer thermal energy; they are \\"unencapsulated\\" in the sense that the target area is not insulated from the rest of the surrounding earth. Energy is added to the GHEX by running a higher temperature fluid through the pipes and thus raising the temperature of the local earth. Energy can also be taken from the GHEX by running a lower temperature fluid through those same pipes. GHEX thermal batteries are usually implemented in two forms. The picture above depicts what is known as a \\"horizontal\\" GHEX where trenching is used to place an amount of pipe in a closed loop in the ground. They are also formed by drilling boreholes into the ground, either vertically or horizontally, and then the pipes are inserted in the form of a closed-loop with a \\"u-bend\\" fitting on the far end of the loop. These drilled GHEX thermal batteries are also sometimes called \\"borehole thermal energy storage systems\\". Heat energy can be added to or removed from a GHEX thermal battery at any point in time. However, they are most often used as a Seasonal thermal energy storage operating on an annual cycle where energy is extracted from a building during the summer season to cool a building and added to the GHEX, and then that same energy is later extracted from the GHEX in the winter season to heat the building. This annual cycle of energy addition and subtraction is highly predictable based on energy modeling of the building served. A thermal battery used in this mode is a renewable energy source as the energy extracted in the winter will be restored to the GHEX the next summer in a continually repeating cycle. This type is solar powered because it is the heat from the sun in the summer that is removed from a building and stored in the ground for use in the next winter season for heating. There are two main methods of Thermal Response Testing are used to characterize the Thermal Conductivity and Thermal Capacity/Diffusivity of GHEX Thermal Batteries  Log-Time 1-Dimensional Curve FitWhat does In-Situ (in place) Testing Provide? and newly released Advanced Thermal Response TestingAdvanced Testing Method for Ground Thermal Conductivity, ORNL/TM-2017/208, Xiaobing Liu/Rick Clemenzi/Su Liu, April 2017Thermal Response Testing Takes a Step Forward, Geo Outlook 2017 Vol. 14 No. 3, Rick Clemenzi, Xiaobing Liu, Garen Ewbank and Judy Siglin. A good example of the Annual Cycle nature of a GHEX Thermal Battery can be seen in the ASHRAE Building study[https://www.geoexchange.org/download/performance-hvac-systems-ashrae- headquarters-building/ Performance of the HVAC Systems at the ASHRAE Headquarters Building, Jeffrey D. Spitler, Laura E. Southard, Xiaobing Liu, GeoExchange Organization, September 30, 2014, see Figure 2-7 (pdf pg 32): Ambient air and ground loop water supply temperatures during occupied hours. As seen in the therein Ground Loop and Ambient Air temperatures by date graphic (Figure 2-7), one can easily see the annual cycle sinusoidal shape of the ground temperature as heat is seasonally extracted from the ground in winter and rejected to the ground in summer, creating a ground \\"thermal charge\\" in one season that is not uncharged and driven the other direction from neutral until a later season. Other more advanced of Ground-based Thermal Batteries utilizing intentional well bore thermal patterns are currently in research and early use. =Other thermal batteries= There are some other items that have historically been termed \\"thermal batteries\\". In this group is the molten salt battery which is a device for generating electricity. Other examples include the heat packs that skiers use for keeping hands and feet warm (see hand warmer). These are a chemical battery which when activated (with air in this case) will produce heat. Other related chemical thermal batteries exist for producing cold (see instant cold pack) generally used for sport injuries. The one common principle of these other thermal batteries is that the reaction involved is generally not reversible. Thus, these batteries are not used for storing and retrieving heat energy.

It was released for the Super NES, Genesis, Game Boy, Sega Saturn, PlayStation, and PC. It includes most major Division I colleges, but some, such as the University of Tennessee, the University of Notre Dame, and Mississippi State University (who had just made a run to the Final Four that year), are not included. The player can play tournaments, a season, or a single game. Many gaming critics accused it of being a thinly veiled repackaging of NBA Jam. Gameplay Each team starts out by picking any two out of five players to play with during the game. During timeouts, and at half-time, the player has a choice to make substitutions. When a player makes two baskets in a row, the announcer says \\"He's heating up\\", and if he makes three baskets in a row without the other team scoring, he says \\"He's on fire!\\", which makes it easier to score. In the season mode, the player can pick from 44 teams, and then play a 20-game season against quality competition. In the tournament mode, 16 teams compete for a chance to win the national championship. The player also has the ability to edit teams and players. Like NBA Jam before it, the gameplay is goofy, but yet competitive as players can easily make full-courts shots off and on (but usually often) and can score 3 in a row to get a flaming ball (to have a chance to become player of the game). Occasionally the college ball players can get struck by lightning as they dunk. Reception The two sports reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the PlayStation version scores of 6.0 and 5.5 out of 10. Though they acknowledged that some players would find the college license appealing, they remarked that the game differs too little from NBA Jam to stir real interest, with one of them noting that \\"Some of the players look exactly the same as they did in Jam except for a color palette change.\\" Tommy Glide and Greasy Gus of GamePro concurred that the game retains the fun of NBA Jam, but that the new alley-oops and player substitutions don't significantly enhance the game, leaving College Slam a pointless clone. Reviewing the Genesis version, a Next Generation critic argued that even the college licensing does nothing for the game, since it doesn't use real players and in some cases even gets the teams' uniform colors wrong. He scored it 2 out of 5 stars. In 1996, Computer Gaming World declared College Slam the 11th- worst computer game ever released.

The prominent fourteener is located in the Lizard Head Wilderness of San Juan National Forest, north by east (bearing 12¬∞) of the Town of Rico in Dolores County, Colorado, United States.The elevation of Mount Wilson includes an adjustment of +1.899 m (+6.23 ft) from NGVD 29 to NAVD 88. Mount Wilson should not to be confused with the lower Wilson Peak nearby. The peak was named for A.D. Wilson, a topographer with the Hayden Survey. He was in the first ascent party, which climbed the peak on September 13, 1874, via the south ridge (a difficult route, not often climbed today).Walter R. Borneman and Lyndon J. Lampert, A Climbing Guide to Colorado's Fourteeners (3rd ed.), Pruett Publishing, 1994, , pp. 231‚Äì239. Climbing Mount Wilson is ranked among the top ten hardest of the Colorado fourteeners to climb. The standard climbing route ascends the North Face from Navajo Basin. Some permanent snowfields exist high in the basin (sometimes termed \\"Navajo Glacier\\") and the climb usually involves snow travel, with ice axe and crampons recommended. Scrambling on rock then leads to the summit. A popular, though long, outing for expert climbers is the mile-long ridge connecting Mount Wilson to El Diente Peak. The ridge is sharp and rocky, and requires difficult scrambling and often a small amount of rappelling. Geology and history Mount Wilson, and the rest of the San Miguel Mountains, are made up of a large, irregular tertiary igneous intrusion.Halka Chronic, Roadside Geology of Colorado, Mountain Press, 1980, , p. 245. The Mount Wilson region became the site of intense mining activity, particularly for silver, in the early 1880s. The most famous of these mines was the Silver Pick Mine, which gave its name to Silver Pick Basin, just north of Navajo Basin. =Glaciers and permafrost= Mount Wilson contains four small glaciers on its summit, these being the southernmost modern glaciers in the Rocky Mountains and indeed the most southerly in the contiguous US outside the Sierra Nevada in California.

The bridging sequences, which had been produced in 1978, show Bugs at his home, which is cantilevered over a carrot-juice waterfall (modeled on Frank Lloyd Wright's \\"Fallingwater\\" house in Bear Run, Pennsylvania). Early on, Bugs discusses the wild villains he had co-starred with in his cartoons, which is followed by a tongue-in-cheek sequence depicting the history of comedy and a scene in which Bugs discusses his \\"several fathers\\". The latter scene was written by Chuck Jones as a way to debunk fellow animation director Bob Clampett's claims throughout the 1970s that he alone created Bugs, and Clampett's name is notably missing from Bugs' list, as a result of the conflict between Jones and Clampett. The movie Bugs Bunny: Superstar featured Bob Clampett, and is another compilation of cartoon shorts, probably the first to examine the history of Warner cartoons, which under-played Bugs' other 'several fathers' and is part of the mentioned conflict. All of the shorts featured were directed by Chuck Jones. The combination of classic animated footage along with new animation would become the template for the theatrically released Looney Tunes movies for this film up until Daffy Duck's Quackbusters in 1988. The film was dedicated to the memory of Chuck Jones' first wife, Dorothy Webster, who died before the film got released. Plot Bugs Bunny, while giving a tour of his home, talks about some of the famous rivalries, battles, and chases from the Looney Tunes shorts, which serves as introductions to footage from the classic short subjects. The final segment of the film consists of an extended chase sequence between Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner.

Originally a continuous state road extending from Bonita Springs to Tice by way of Fort Myers Beach and Fort Myers, SR 865 now consists of two segments connected by a part of CR 865, which also extends to the north and south of the state segments. Both the state and county controlled segments of the route combined stretch a distance of over , making it the longest designation in Lee County. Until the 1980s, State Road 865 signs were posted along a much longer highway. In the mid 1970s, FDOT designated three large sections of then-SR 865 as secondary routes, which started a process in which these designated sections would be converted to county control. This was part of a series of transformations that particularly affected southern Florida. Route description =Bonita Springs and Fort Myers Beach= SR 865 connects to Estero Island via the Matanzas Pass Bridge The historic southern terminus of SR 865 is an interchange between Interstate 75 (I-75 or SR 93) and Bonita Beach Road in Bonita Springs, though the current county designation actually begins east of the interchange. From there CR 865 follows Bonita Beach Road westward through Bonita Springs to Hickory Boulevard on Bonita Beach (Little Hickory Island), near the Gulf of Mexico shore. Motorists traveling north then cross the Bonita Beach Causeway, which passes over Big Hickory Island, Long Key and Black Key, which provides access to the Lovers Key / Carl E. Johnson State Park. Once on Estero Island, CR 865 passes through the town of Fort Myers Beach before connecting to San Carlos Boulevard on the north end of the island. State maintenance begins the intersection of Estero and San Carlos boulevards just east of Bodwitch Point Park. After crossing the Matanzas Pass Bridge and San Carlos Island onto the mainland, SR 865 forms the western boundary of Estero Bay Preserve State Park adjacent to Hurricane Bay. = Iona and South Fort Myers = San Carlos Boulevard then intersects with Summerlin Road (CR 869), which is a grade-separated single- point urban interchange, with Summerlin Road crossing above on an overpass. This interchange also provides access to Sanibel Island. The southern section of SR 865 continues northward its northern terminus, an intersection with McGregor Boulevard, which is SR 867 to the northeast of the intersection, and CR 867 to the southwest, a more direct route connecting downtown Fort Myers to the popular Sanibel and Captiva islands. At this point, SR 865 ends and CR 865 resumes, proceeding east along Gladiolus Drive. East of here, CR 865 intersects Summerlin Road (CR 869) again, this time at an at-grade intersection with two left-turning flyover ramps. It passes by Lakes Park before intersecting with U.S. Route 41 (US 41), where the route transitions yet again to SR 865. Extending only in South Fort Myers, the northern section of SR 865 is locally known as the Ben C. Pratt Six Mile Cypress Parkway. It begins at Tamiami Trail (US 41) and terminates at an intersection with Metro and Michael G. Rippe Parkways (SR 739). This portion of the parkway historically served as the first mile of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad's Punta Rassa Branch. Though this section runs in east‚Äìwest route, it is still signed as a north‚Äìsouth route to be consistent with the adjacent county- controlled segments. = East Fort Myers and Tice = Beyond the northern section's terminus at SR 739, historic SR 865 continues along Six Mile Cypress Parkway and turns north passing the Lee County Sports Complex, which contains Hammond Stadium, the spring training home of the Minnesota Twins major league baseball team. As it turns north, it parallels the Six Mile Cypress Slough. At Colonial Boulevard (SR 884), historic SR 865 becomes Ortiz Avenue and parallels Interstate 75 to its northern terminus, an intersection with Palm Beach Boulevard (SR 80) in Tice. Parts of Ortiz Avenue were originally signed State Road 80B before being connected to the rest of SR 865.General Highway Map, Lee County, January 1976, reprinted January 1980 History The entire route of SR 865 came into existence incrementally over the span of many decades. Gladiolus Drive originally existed to serve gladiolus fields in Iona and Biggar. Lee County was once known as the gladiolus capital of the world, with the A&W; Bulb Company being once of the major operators of the fields. San Carlos Boulevard was built in 1927 to serve as a more direct route from McGregor Boulevard (SR 867) to Fort Myers Beach, replacing an earlier route that traversed present-day Bunche Beach. Estero Boulevard, San Carlos Boulevard and Gladiolus Drive were first designated State Road 278 in 1935. State Road 278 would become State Road 865 during the 1945 Florida State Road renumbering. The northernmost of San Carlos Boulevard (in Iona) was renumbered SR 867 when McGregor Boulevard was realigned slightly south in the early 1980s (Old McGregor Boulevard is the former alignment). Gladiolus Drive would also be realigned to the south in the early 1990s (Paul Schultz Way is the former alignment of Gladiolus Drive). Estero Boulevard reached the southern tip of Fort Myers Beach by 1950. Upon the completion of the Bonita Beach Causeway in 1965, the SR 865 designation was extended south from Fort Myers Beach through Bonita Springs along Hickory Boulevard and Bonita Beach Road. Bonita Beach Road was developed in the 1950s as Bonita Springs main east‚Äìwest thoroughfare. The construction of Six Mile Cypress Parkway was the final link in the entire route, which opened around 1978 to provide improved access from the area to Interstate 75 (which opened in 1979). With the completion of Six Mile Cypress, Gladiolus Drive was realigned to the north at the intersection with US 41. The SR 865 designation then continued along Six Mile Cypress, which ran east along a former railroad spur, then turned north along the Six Mile Cypress Slough to connect with Ortiz Avenue (which existed previously as State Road 80B). The entire route from Bonita Springs to Tice would only be designated SR 865 for a short time before the state relinquished portions to the county.

The current spelling of \\"Eolus\\" was first used in the Wheeler Survey of 1878. Climbing Mount Eolus is one of three fourteeners in the Needle Mountains; the others are Sunlight Peak and Windom Peak. All three peaks are located around the cirque known as Upper Chicago Basin. Eolus lies to the west of the upper basin, while the other peaks lie on the east side. These mountains are among the most remote of Colorado's fourteeners and have a strong wilderness character. North Eolus, elevation , is a northern subpeak of Mount Eolus, though it is not usually counted as a separate peak or as an official fourteener, since it has a topographic prominence of only . It is sometimes climbed in conjunction with Eolus. Elevation Mount Eolus' elevation is very close to, and may even be higher than, that of nearby Windom Peak.

Intended for use by heavy bombers and transports, they were the standard air base design for the Royal Air Force as well as U.S. Army Air Forces units operating from the UK. Upon the entry of the US into the war a number of RAF Class A bases were transferred to the U.S. Eighth Air Force for use as heavy bomber bases with the RAF units formerly occupying them being redeployed to other RAF bomber airfields, and U.S. Army Engineer Units constructed more airfields to this standard or brought earlier airfields up to this specification by lengthening runways, etc. Many units of the U.S. Ninth Air Force also flew from Class A airfields. The term Class 'A' came about because, quite often, the resultant aerial shot of the crossed runways would look like the letter A. Design The specifications set by the British Air Ministry in August 1942 called for three converging strips, each containing a concrete runway optimally placed‚Äîif practicable at the site‚Äîat 60-degree angles to each other in a triangular pattern. The longest strip was designated the main strip and aligned southwest to northeast wherever possible, this being chosen to allow aircraft to take off and land into the prevailing wind. The other two runways were to allow safe takeoff and landing from either end when the wind was blowing from other directions. The primary consideration was for operational safety for any type of aircraft then in operation or under development. The runways were connected by taxiways called a perimeter track (peri-track), of a standard width of . However, certain stations that were designated to be fighter bases sometimes had a narrower perimeter track, such as RAF Coltishall, whose peri-tracks measured across. A area was cleared and leveled on either side of the perimeter track. Class A specifications for taxiways set a minimum curve radius of measured from the centre line for angles greater than 60 degrees and for angles less than 60 degrees. Perimeter track gradients could not exceed 1 in 40 in any direction, and no building could be placed closer than from the edge of the track. Areas called hardstands were placed along the perimeter track, made of concrete, with their centres at least from the edge of the track and the edges of each hardstand separated from each other and from the funnels by a minimum of . The purpose of the hardstands was to allow aircraft to be dispersed some distance from each other so that an air attack on the airfield would be less likely to destroy all the aircraft at once. Dispersal also minimised the chance of collateral damage to other aircraft should an accident occur whilst bombing- up. Hardstands were either of the Frying-Pan or Spectacle Loop type, with the Spectacle type being the easiest in which to manoeuvre aircraft.RAF Bassingbourn in 1945. The Frying-Pan and Spectacle Loop aircraft dispersals are easy to identify The strips were in width, cleared, graded and surfaced with turf. A concrete runway in width was centred on the strip, with a length of at least for the main strip and at least for the secondary strips. On each side of the strip the field was cleared of obstructions and leveled an additional . Gradients for the strips were a maximum 1 in 80 longitudinally and 1 in 60 transversely. In addition, an area at the end of each runway was cleared of obstructions at an angle of fifteen degrees outward from each side on a rising imaginary plane of 1 in 50 to provide a flightway called a funnel. Construction The material needs for building runways suitable for heavy bombers were approximately 18,000 tons of dry cement and 90,000 tons of aggregate. Expected stress factors of 2,000 pounds per square inch led to runway thicknesses of six to nine inches of concrete slab laid on a hardcore base, covered with a layer of asphalt. In areas where there was no natural rock, such as East Anglia, stone had to be imported for the hardcore. Up to six trains ran daily from London to east Anglia carrying rubble from destroyed buildings in Luftwaffe raids. This material was used as hardcore for the airfields. The runways at RAF Beaulieu Operational use Nine airfields (Alconbury, Bassingbourn, Chelveston, Grafton Underwood, Kimbolton, Molesworth, Podington, Polebrook, and Thurleigh) were allotted to the Eighth Air Force but had been completed prior to the Class A standard for runway lengths. These were brought to Class A standards in 1942 and early 1943 by extending their runways, repositioning their perimeter tracks, and adding additional hardstands. Class A airfields were also characterized by standardized technical site requirements for repair, maintenance and storage of aircraft. Two T-2 type metal hangars (240 feet long by 115 feet wide by 29 feet high) were the standard for most airfields, although a few pre-1942 bases had three T-2 hangars and Thurleigh had four. Three bases (Chelveston, Molesworth, and Polebrook) also had a J Type brick-and-metal hangar (300' X 151') in addition to a pair of T2's, and Bassingbourn, which had been a pre- war RAF bomber station, had four C type brick hangars measuring 300 by 152 feet Several airfields had their runways widened and extended in length for emergency landing of damaged bombers after operations over Germany, these airfields, RAF Woodbridge, RAF Carnaby, and RAF Manston being designated as \\"Emergency Landing Grounds\\" ‚Äì ELG's. These ELG airfields had some of the first fitments of the fog-dispersing installation, FIDO. Post-war motorsport use With the end of World War II and the resurgence of the sport of motor racing several former airfields were used as race tracks, including Silverstone, Castle Combe, Goodwood and Thruxton. Most race tracks on former airfields use the encircling perimeter track, although the main straight at Snetterton is laid down on a secondary runway, and the main runway is used at Santa Pod Raceway (formerly RAF Podington) for drag racing.

Washington was convicted of raping and murdering Lucy Fryer, the wife of his white employer in rural Robinson, Texas. He was chained by his neck and dragged out of the county court by observers. He was then paraded through the street, all while being stabbed and beaten, before being held down and castrated. He was then lynched in front of Waco's city hall. Over 10,000 spectators, including city officials and police, gathered to watch the attack. There was a celebratory atmosphere among whites at the spectacle of the murder, and many children attended during their lunch hour. Members of the mob cut off his fingers, and hung him over a bonfire after saturating him with coal oil. He was repeatedly lowered and raised over the fire for about two hours. After the fire was extinguished, his charred torso was dragged through the town. A professional photographer took pictures as the event unfolded, providing rare imagery of a lynching in progress. The pictures were printed and sold as postcards in Waco. Although the lynching was supported by many Waco residents, it was condemned by newspapers around the United States. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) hired Elisabeth Freeman to investigate; she conducted a detailed probe in Waco, despite the reluctance of many residents to speak about the event. Freeman concluded that white residents were generally supportive of Washington's lynching. She also concluded that Washington killed Fryer. After receiving Freeman's report on the lynching, NAACP co-founder and editor W. E. B. Du Bois published an in-depth report featuring photographs of Washington's charred body in The Crisis, and the NAACP featured his death in their anti- lynching campaign. Historians have noted that Washington's death helped alter the way lynching was viewed. The widespread negative publicity helped curb public support for the practice. In the 1990s and 2000s, some Waco residents lobbied for a monument to Washington's lynching, but this idea failed to garner wide support in the city. On the centenary of the event, in May 2016, the mayor of Waco held a formal ceremony to apologize to Washington's descendants and the African-American community. A historical marker has been installed to memorialize the lynching.  Background  La Grande Jatte, reflecting the city's desire to present itself as an idyllic localealt=left In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, thousands of lynchings occurred in the Southern United States, primarily of African Americans in the states of Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, and Texas. Between 1890 and 1920, about 3,000 African Americans were killed by lynch mobs in cases where they were alleged perpetrators of crimes. They were conducted outside the legal system: suspects were taken from jail and courtrooms or killed before arrest. Supporters of lynching justified the practice as a way to assert dominance over African Americans, to whom they attributed a criminal nature. Lynching also provided a sense of white solidarity in a culture with changing demographics and power structures. Although lynching was tolerated by much of southern society, opponents of the practice emerged, including some religious leaders and the nascent National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). In 1916, Waco, Texas, was a prosperous city with a population of more than 30,000. After it became associated with crime in the 19th century, community leaders sought to change its reputation, sending delegations across the U.S. to promote it as an idyllic locale. By the 1910s, Waco's economy had become strong and the city had gained a pious reputation. A black middle class had emerged in the area, along with two black colleges. In the mid-1910s, blacks comprised about twenty percent of the Waco population. In her 2006 study of lynching, journalist Patricia Bernstein describes the city as then having a \\"thin veneer\\" of peace and respectability. Racial tension was present in the city: local newspapers often emphasized crimes committed by African Americans, and Sank Majors, a black man, was lynched and hanged from a bridge near downtown Waco in 1905. A small number of anti- lynching activists lived in the area, including the president of Waco's Baylor University. In 1916, several factors led to an increase in local racism, including the screening of The Birth of a Nation, a movie that promoted white supremacy and glorified the Ku Klux Klan, and the sale of photographs of a recently lynched black man in Temple, Texas.  Murder and arrest  McLennan County courthouse in 2006 In Robinson, Texas, Lucy Fryer was murdered while alone at her house on May 8, 1916. She was found clubbed to death, sprawled across the doorway of the farm's seed shed. It was a grisly scene that included signs of sexual assault. Officials determined a blunt instrument was used as the murder weapon. She and her husband George were English immigrants, and had become well respected in the rural community where they operated a farm. News of the death quickly reached the McLennan County Sheriff, Samuel Fleming, who immediately investigated with a team of law enforcement officers, a group of local men, and a doctor. The doctor determined that Fryer had been killed by blunt-force trauma to the head. The local men suspected that Jesse Washington, a seventeen-year-old black youth who had worked on the Fryers' farm for five months, was responsible. One man said that he had seen Washington near the Fryer house a few minutes before Lucy's body was discovered. That night, sheriff's deputies traveled to Washington's home, finding him in front of the house wearing blood-stained overalls. He said the stains were from a nosebleed. Jesse, his brother William, and their parents were taken to nearby Waco to be questioned by the county sheriff's department; although Jesse's parents and brother were released after a short time, he was held for further interrogation, without an attorney or his parents present. His questioners in Waco reported that he denied complicity in Fryer's death, but offered contradictory details about his actions. Rumors spread after Washington's arrest that the youth had been in an altercation with a white man a few days before the murder. On May 9, Sheriff Fleming took Washington to Hill County to prevent vigilante action. The Hill County sheriff, Fred Long, questioned Washington with Fleming. Washington eventually told them he had killed Fryer following an argument about her mules, and described the murder weapon and its location. Long brought Washington to Dallas, Texas, while Fleming returned to Robinson. Fleming soon reported that he found a bloody hammer where Washington had indicated. In Dallas, Washington dictated and signed a statement that described the rape and murder of Fryer; the confession was published the next day in Waco newspapers. Newspapers sensationalized the murder, describing Fryer's attempts to resist Washington's attack. But the doctor who had examined her body concluded that she was killed before she resisted any assault. A lynch mob assembled in Waco that night to search the local jail, but dispersed after failing to find Washington. A local paper praised their effort. That night, a small private funeral and burial were held for Lucy Fryer. A grand jury was assembled on May 11 in McLennan County and quickly returned an indictment against Washington; the trial was scheduled for May 15. The Times-Herald of Waco published a notice on May 12 requesting that residents let the justice system determine Washington's fate. Sheriff Fleming traveled to Robinson on May 13 to ask residents to remain calm; his address was well received. Washington was assigned several inexperienced lawyers. His lawyers prepared no defense, and noted that he appeared placid in the days before the trial.  Trial and lynching  The crowd preparing to lynch Washington Washington's body hanging Charred corpse of Jesse Washington among the ashes Charred corpse of Jesse Washington among the ashes On the morning of May 15, Waco's courthouse quickly filled to capacity in anticipation of the trial: the crowd almost prevented some jurors from entering. Observers also filled the sidewalks around the courthouse; more than two thousand spectators were present. Attendees were almost entirely white, but a few quiet members of Waco's black community were present. As Washington was led into the courtroom, one audience member pointed a gun at him, but was quickly overpowered. As the trial commenced, Judge Richard Irby Munroe attempted to keep order, insisting that the audience remain silent. Jury selection proceeded quickly: the defense did not challenge any selections of the prosecution. Judge Munroe asked Washington for a plea, and explained the potential sentences. Washington muttered a response, possibly \\"yes\\", interpreted by the court as a guilty plea. The prosecution described the charges, and the court heard testimony from law enforcement officers and the doctor who examined Fryer's body. The doctor discussed how Fryer died, but did not mention rape. The prosecution rested, and Washington's attorney asked him whether he had committed the offense. Washington replied, \\"That's what I done\\" and quietly apologized. The lead prosecutor addressed the courtroom and declared that the trial had been conducted fairly, prompting an ovation from the crowd. The jury was sent to deliberate. After four minutes of deliberation, the jury's foreman announced a guilty verdict and a sentence of death. The trial lasted about one hour. Court officers approached Washington to escort him away, but were pushed aside by a surge of spectators, who seized Washington and dragged him outside. Washington initially fought back, biting one man, but was soon beaten. A chain was placed around his neck and he was dragged toward city hall by a growing mob; on the way downtown, he was stripped, stabbed, and repeatedly beaten with blunt objects. By the time he was taken to city hall, a group had prepared wood for a bonfire next to a tree in front of the building. Washington, semiconscious and covered in blood, was doused with oil, hanged from the tree by a chain, and lowered to the ground. Members of the crowd cut off his fingers, toes, and genitals. The fire was lit and Washington was repeatedly raised and lowered into the flames until he burned to death. German scholar Manfred Berg posits that the executioners attempted to keep him alive to increase his suffering. Washington attempted to climb the chain, but was unable to do so without fingers. The fire was extinguished after two hours, allowing bystanders to collect souvenirs from the site of the lynching, including Washington's bones and links of the chain. One attendee kept part of Washington's genitalia; a group of children snapped the teeth out of Washington's head to sell as souvenirs. By the time the fire was extinguished, parts of Washington's arms and legs had been burned off and his torso and head were charred. His body was removed from the tree and dragged behind a horse throughout the town. Washington's remains were transported to Robinson, where they were publicly displayed until a constable obtained the body late in the day and buried it. The spectacle of the lynching drew a large crowd estimated at 10,000 to 15,000 at its peak, including the mayor, John Dollins, and the chief of police, Guy McNamara, although lynching was illegal in Texas. Sheriff Fleming told his deputies not to try to stop the lynching, and no one was arrested after the event. Bernstein speculates that Fleming may have wanted to be seen as dealing harshly with crime to help his candidacy for re-election that year. Mayor John Dollins may have also encouraged the mob for political benefit. Residents had telephoned acquaintances to spread word of the lynching, allowing spectators to gather more quickly and in greater numbers than before the advent of telephones. Local media reported that \\"shouts of delight\\" were heard as Washington burned, although they noted that some attendees disapproved. The Waco Semi-Weekly Tribune maintained that a number of black Waco residents attended, a claim that historian Grace Hale of the University of Virginia thinks is dubious. Waco residents, who likely had no connection with the rural Fryer family, comprised most of the crowd. Some people from nearby rural communities traveled to the city before the trial to witness the events. As the lynching occurred at midday, children from local schools walked downtown to observe, some climbing into trees for a better view. Many parents approved of their children's attendance, hoping that the lynching would reinforce a belief in white supremacy. Some Texans saw participation in a lynching as a rite of passage for young men.  Aftermath  Fred Gildersleeve, a Waco-based professional photographer, arrived at city hall shortly before the lynching, possibly at the mayor's request, and photographed the event. His photographs provide rare depictions of a lynching in progress, rather than typical lynching photography, which shows only dead victims. Gildersleeve's photographs include views of the crowd shot from a building and close images of Washington's body; some may have been taken by an assistant. Gildersleeve produced postcards featuring images of adolescents, some as young as twelve, gathered around Washington's body. The individuals in the photographs made no attempt to hide their identities. Berg believes that their willingness to be photographed indicates that they knew that no one would be prosecuted for Washington's death. Although some Waco residents sent the cards to out-of-town relatives, several prominent local citizens persuaded Gildersleeve to stop selling them, fearing that the images would come to characterize the town. In the days after the lynching, newspapers fiercely condemned the event. Within a week, news of the lynching was published as far away as London. A New York Times editorial opined that, \\"in no other land even pretending to be civilized could a man be burned to death in the streets of a considerable city amid the savage exultation of its inhabitants\\". In the New York Age, James Weldon Johnson described the members of the lynch mob as \\"lower than any other people who at present inhabit the earth\\". Although many southern newspapers had previously defended lynching as a defense of civilized society, after Washington's death, they did not cast the practice in such terms. The Montgomery Advertiser wrote that, \\"no savage was ever more cruel ... than the men who participated in this horrible, almost unbelievable episode\\". In Texas, the Houston Chronicle and the Austin American criticized the lynch mob, but spoke highly of Waco. The Morning News of Dallas reported the story, but did not publish an accompanying editorial. In Waco, the Times-Herald refrained from editorializing about the lynching. The Waco Morning News briefly noted disapproval of the lynching, focusing criticism on papers they felt had attacked the city unfairly. They cast the condemnatory editorials in the aftermath of the lynching as \\"Holier than thou\\" remarks. A writer for the Waco Semi-Weekly Tribune defended the lynching, stating that Washington deserved to die and that blacks should view Washington's death as a warning against crime. The paper later carried an editorial from the Houston Post condemning the lynching, characterizing the column as part of an attack on the city. Some residents condemned the lynching, including ministers and leaders of Baylor University. The judge who presided over Washington's trial later stated that members of the lynch mob were \\"murderers\\"; the jury's foreman told the NAACP that he disapproved of their actions. Some who witnessed the lynching recorded persistent nightmares and psychological trauma. A few citizens contemplated staging a protest against the lynching, but declined to do so owing to concerns about reprisals or the appearance of hypocrisy. After the lynching, town officials maintained that it was attended by a small group of malcontents. Although their claim is contradicted by photographic evidence, several histories of Waco have repeated this assertion. There were no negative repercussions for Mayor Dollins or Police Chief Guy McNamara; although they made no attempt to stop the mob, they remained well respected in Waco. As was common with such attacks, no one was prosecuted for the lynching. Although leaders of Waco's black community gave public condolences to the Fryer family, they complained about Washington's lynching only in private. One exception was the Paul Quinn Weekly newspaper, of Texas' Paul Quinn College, a black college. It published several articles that criticized the lynch mob and city leadership. In one article, the author proclaimed that Jesse Washington was innocent and George Fryer was guilty. A. T. Smith, the paper's editor, was subsequently convicted of libel. George Fryer also sued the college for libel; his vehemence caused some Robinson residents to suspect that he played a part in his wife's death. Bernstein states that it is \\"highly unlikely\\" that George Fryer played a role in Lucy's murder, but notes that there is the \\"shadow of a possibility\\" that he bore some guilt. On May 11, 1953, an F5 tornado tore right through Downtown Waco, killing 114 people and injuring 593 others. In the aftermath of the disaster, some people in the local African-American community saw the tornado as divine retribution for the lynching of Jesse Washington over thirty years prior.  NAACP investigation and campaign  Elisabeth Freeman in 1913 The NAACP hired Elisabeth Freeman, a women's suffrage activist based in New York City, to investigate the lynching. She had traveled to Texas in late 1915 or early 1916 to help organize the suffrage movement, and was already in Dallas for a statewide convention in early May. Freeman began her assignment in Waco soon after the lynching, posing as a journalist and attempting to interview people about the events. She found that most residents were reluctant to discuss the event. She spoke with town officials and obtained pictures of the lynching from Gildersleeve, who was initially reluctant to provide them. Although she feared for her safety, she enjoyed the challenge of the investigation. When speaking with city leaders, Freeman convinced them that she planned to defend Waco against criticism when she returned to the North. Some journalists soon grew suspicious of her and warned residents not to talk to outsiders. Local African Americans, however, gave her a warm reception. Freeman interviewed both Sheriff Fleming and the judge who presided over the trial; each said that he did not deserve blame for the lynching. A schoolteacher who had known Washington told Freeman that the young man was illiterate, and that all attempts to teach him to read had been futile. Freeman concluded that white residents were generally supportive of Washington's lynching after his conviction, although many were upset that he had been mutilated. She determined that the mob that took him from the courtroom was led by a bricklayer, a saloonkeeper, and several employees of an ice company. The NAACP did not publicly identify them. Freeman concluded that Washington killed Fryer, and suggested he had resented her domineering attitude towards him. W. E. B. Du Bois had been incensed by news of the brutal attack, saying \\"any talk of the triumph of Christianity, or the spread of human culture, is idle twaddle as long as the Waco lynching is possible in the United States\\". After receiving Freeman's report, he placed a photograph of Washington's body on the cover of The Crisis, the NAACP's newsletter, in a special issue that discussed the event. The issue was titled \\"The Waco Horror\\" and was published as an eight-page supplement to the July edition. Du Bois popularized \\"Waco Horror\\" as a name for Washington's lynching; the Houston Chronicle and the New York Times had previously used the word \\"horror\\" to describe the event. In 1916, The Crisis had a circulation of about 30,000, three times the size of the NAACP's membership. Although The Crisis had campaigned against lynching in the past, this was the first issue to publish images of an attack. The NAACP's board was initially hesitant to publish such graphic content, but Du Bois insisted on doing so, arguing that uncensored coverage would push white Americans to support change. The issue included accounts of the lynching that Freeman had obtained from Waco residents. Du Bois wrote The Crisis' article on the lynching; he edited and organized Freeman's report for publication, but did not credit her in the issue. Du Bois's article concluded with a call to support the anti-lynching movement. The NAACP distributed the report to hundreds of newspapers and politicians, a campaign that led to wide condemnation of the lynching. Many white observers were disturbed by photos of the southerners who celebrated the lynching. The Crisis included more images of lynchings in subsequent issues. Washington's death received continued discussion in The Crisis. Oswald Garrison Villard wrote in a later edition of the paper that \\"the crime at Waco is a challenge to our American civilization\\". Other black newspapers also carried significant coverage of the lynching, as did liberal monthly magazines such as The New Republic and The Nation. Freeman traveled around the U.S. to speak to audiences about her investigation, maintaining that a shift in public opinion could accomplish more than legislative actions. Although there were other lynchings as brutal as Washington's, the availability of photographs and the setting of his death made it a cause c√©l√®bre. Leaders of the NAACP hoped to launch a legal battle against those responsible for Washington's death, but abandoned the plan owing to the projected cost. The NAACP had struggled financially around that time. Their anti-lynching campaign helped them raise funds, but they scaled back the campaign as the U.S. entered World War I. NAACP president Joel Elias Spingarn later said that the group's campaign placed \\"lynching into the public mind as something like a national problem\\". In her 2006 study of lynching, Bernstein describes this anti-lynching campaign as the \\"barest beginnings of a battle that would last many years\\". The number of lynchings in the U.S. increased in the late 1910s, particularly in the postwar period. In addition, in the summer and fall of 1919, called Red Summer, racial riots of whites against blacks broke out in numerous large cities, including in the Northeast and Midwest, due in part to tensions related to competition for jobs and housing in the postwar period as veterans struggled to re-enter society. Particularly in Chicago and Washington, DC, blacks fought back fiercely in the riots but suffered the most casualties and property losses. They believed their war service should have earned them better treatment as citizens. More lynchings took place in Waco in the 1920s, partially owing to the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan. By the late 1920s, however, Waco authorities had begun to protect blacks from lynching, as in the case of Roy Mitchell. Authorities feared that negative publicity generated by lynchings‚Äîsuch as the NAACP's campaign following Washington's death‚Äîwould hinder their efforts to attract business investors. The NAACP fought to portray lynching as a savage, barbaric practice, an idea which eventually gained traction in the public mind. Bernstein credits the group's efforts with helping to end \\"the worst public atrocities of the racist system\\" in the Waco region.  Analysis and legacy  In 2011, Manfred Berg speculated that Washington probably murdered Fryer, but doubted that he raped her. The same year, Julie Armstrong of the University of South Florida argued that Washington was possibly innocent of both charges. In her 2006 book, Patricia Bernstein noted that Washington's motives have never been established clearly, although he did confess to having a dispute about mules with Fryer and there was a witness who alleged to have seen a dispute, as noted previously. She also states that his confession could have been coerced, and that there is evidence of limited intellectual capacity. She suggests that the murder weapon‚Äîperhaps the strongest evidence against him‚Äîcould have been planted by authorities. Bernstein states that Washington's lynching was a unique event because of its scale and location; not only did it occur in a larger city with a reputation for progressiveness, but it was attended by 10,000 spectators who were excited by the brutal torture. Similar acts of mob violence typically occurred in smaller towns with fewer spectators. William Carrigan of Rowan University argues that the culture of central Texas had glorified retributive mob violence for decades before Washington's lynching, maintaining that this culture of violence explains how such a brutal attack could be publicly celebrated. Hale posits that Washington's death signaled a transition in the practice of lynching, demonstrating its acceptance in modernized, 20th-century cities. She notes that Washington's lynching illustrates how technological innovations, such as telephones and inexpensive photographs, could empower lynch mobs but also increase society's condemnation of their actions. In their 2004 study of lynching, Peter Ehrenhaus and A. Susan Owen compare the lynching to a blood sacrifice, arguing Waco residents felt a sense of collective righteousness after Washington's death, as they saw him as the presence of evil in the community. Bernstein compares the public brutality of the lynch mob to the medieval English practice of hanging, drawing, and quartering people convicted of high treason. Amy Louise Wood of Illinois State University writes that the event was \\"a defining moment in the history of lynching\\", arguing that with Washington's death, \\"lynching began to sow the seeds of its own collapse\\". Although the spectacle of violent mob attacks had previously benefited white supremacists, Wood contends that after Washington's death was publicized, the anti-lynching movement included images of racially motivated brutality in their campaigns. Carrigan notes that Washington's death may have received more public attention than any other lynching in the United States, and sees the event as a \\"turning point in the history of mob violence in Central Texas\\". Although the outcry it provoked did not end the practice, it helped bring an end to public support of such attacks by city leaders. Carrigan states that the lynching was \\"the most infamous day in the history of central Texas\\" until the Waco siege of 1993. After the practice of lynching was suppressed in central Texas, it received little attention from local historians. However, Waco developed a reputation for racism‚Äîpropagated in part by American history textbooks‚Äîto the vexation of the city's white residents. In the years following the lynching, African Americans often held Waco in disdain, and some viewed the 1953 Waco tornado outbreak as divine retribution. White leaders of Waco took a non-violent approach in response to demonstrations during the Civil Rights Movement, possibly owing to a desire to avoid stigmatizing the city again. Blues musician Sammy Price recorded a version of \\"Hesitation Blues\\" that referenced Washington's lynching. Price lived in Waco as a child, possibly at the time of Washington's death. Waco- based novelist Madison Cooper featured a lynching, thought to be based on Washington's death, as a key event in his 1952 novel Sironia, Texas. In the 1990s, Lawrence Johnson, a member of Waco's city council, viewed pictures of the Washington lynching at the National Civil Rights Museum, and began to lobby for a monument to the lynching. In 2002, Lester Gibson, another member of the city council, proposed that a plaque be installed at the courthouse where Washington was lynched. He further stated that the plaque should carry an apology from the city. The ideas were discussed, but were not developed. In the 2000s, the idea of a memorial was revived by a McLennan County commissioner and the Waco Chamber of Commerce; the Waco Herald Tribune has editorialized in support of a historical marker on the site of the lynching. Some descendants of Fryer objected to the proposed memorial. On the centenary of the lynching, May 15, 2016, the mayor of Waco apologized in a formal ceremony to Washington‚Äôs relatives and issued a proclamation condemning Washington's lynching and noting the anniversary of the event.J.B. Smith, \\"‚ÄòWaco Horror‚Äô at 100: Why Jesse Washington‚Äôs lynching still matters\\" , Waco Tribune, May 15, 2016; accessed May 21, 2018 A historical marker is being erected at the site. In the 2018 film BlacKkKlansman, Harry Belafonte portrays a witness to the lynching who describes the event at a civil rights rally in 1970s Colorado Springs.

Competing in four Summer Olympics, he won three medals with one gold (2008: K-1 1000 m) and two bronzes (2000: K-1 1000 m, 2008: K-1 500 m). Early life and education Tim Brabants was born in Chertsey. He first began his canoeing career at Elmbridge Canoe Club in Elmbridge. Brabants was educated at the Salesian School, a Voluntary Aided co- educational Roman Catholic comprehensive school in Chertsey, Surrey, followed by the University of Nottingham. Career Brabants trained at Royal Canoe Club, the world's oldest canoe club located in Teddington, London. Brabants won the K-1 1000 m European championship at Szeged, Hungary in 2002, the first time a British paddler had won the blue riband event. The 2004 Olympics however were a disappointment. Brabants had won a European silver medal at Pozna≈Ñ earlier in the season and was the fastest qualifier for the Olympic K-1 1000 m final with the world's fastest time of 3:24.412. However, in the final itself he finished in fifth place. He took a year off from competitive kayaking in 2005 to complete his medical studies at the University of Nottingham followed by a spell as a doctor in Jersey. However, he returned to action in 2006, winning the gold medal in Raƒçice in the K-1 1000 m event at the European Championships and the silver medal in the same event at the World Championships in Szeged in August 2006, finishing just 0.06 seconds behind Sweden's Markus Oscarsson. 2007 was an even better year. Brabants competed in the K-1 500 m discipline as well and at the European Championships won Silver for the 1000 m and Gold for the 500 m. At the 2007 World Championships in Duisburg, Brabants won gold in the K-1 1000 m and silver in the K-1 500 m events, thus securing a place for Great Britain at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. At these games Brabants made his way into the history books by being the first Briton to win a gold medal in either the sprint or slalom kayak discipline. This he achieved by a convincing win in the K-1 1000 m, leading from start to finish. Although best known as a sprinter, Brabants' first success as a senior international had in fact come in the marathon. He won a silver medal at the 1998 World Canoe Marathon Championships in Cape Town, South Africa.http://www.timbrabants.com/carrer_highlights.php Brabants is a member of the Nottingham Kayak Club and is a physician by profession. He is 188 cm (6'2) tall and weighs 85 kg (187 lbs). Brabants was Awarded an MBE by Queen Elizabeth II in the 2009 New Years Honours List for his services to kayaking. In 2010, he won a silver in the K-1 1000 m event at the world championships. Brabants was selected for the canoe sprint team for London Olympics 2012, where he finished 8th.

Since 2013 he has been the president of swisspeace. Biography Jakob Kellenberger was born in the Swiss canton of Appenzell in 1944. Kellenberger studied French and Spanish literature at the University of Zurich. He also studied at the Graduate Institute of International Studies in Geneva between 1974-75. During his studies, he spent time in Tours, France, and Grenada, Spain. He wrote his undergraduate dissertation on Jean-Jacques Rousseau and his doctoral thesis on the Spanish playwright Pedro Calder√≥n de la Barca. He completed his studies with a doctorate in literature from the University of Zurich. While still a student, Kellenberger married Elisabeth Jossi. They have two daughters, Eleonore and Christina. In 2013, Kellenberger was appointed as President of the swisspeace Foundation Board which establishes and oversees the annual and longer-term strategic work program for swisspeace and accepts the annual financial statements and budget. It also formulates and develops the guiding principles for swisspeace's work. Diplomatic service Jakob Kellenberger entered the Swiss diplomatic service in 1974. He was posted to Madrid, then to Brussels and subsequently to London. From 1984 to 1992, he headed the joint office of the Swiss Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Economic Affairs in charge of the relations to the European Union and EFTA, and in 1988, he was promoted from the diplomatic rank of minister to ambassador. From 1989 to 1991, he headed the transport (transit) negotiations with the European Community on the Swiss side. In 1992, Kellenberger was appointed Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. From 1992 to 1999, he held the posts of Secretary of State and head of the Directorate of Political Affairs within the Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs. From 1994 to 1998, he was also coordinator and chief negotiator for Switzerland's sector-by-sector bilateral negotiations with the European Union.ICRC. 1 Jan 2009. The members of ICRC. Presidency of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) On 1 January 2000, Jakob Kellenberger was appointed president of the ICRC, a humanitarian organization that, as of July 2011, has some 13,000 staff and a network of over 200 delegations. The scope of the ICRC's operations expanded considerably during his term in office. The ICRC's large-scale operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Sudan and the Near East had and partly still have a particular impact on Jakob Kellenberger's job, as also reflected by his field visits and efforts in the sphere of humanitarian diplomacy. Kellenberger made a decisive contribution towards more intensive cooperation in several spheres between the ICRC and the European Union and its member States.David P Forsythe. The Humanitarians: The International Committee of the Red Cross. New York: Cambridge, 2005. 219. Managing the ICRC's relationship with the United States after the September 11 attacks in the areas of law and humanitarian diplomacy was one of his greatest challenges. In difficult conflict situations, he considered it important to get first-hand experience of the reality on the ground, as witnessed by his trips to southern Lebanon during the war of summer 2006 and to Gaza in January 2009, and his numerous visits to Afghanistan and Darfur. He stated on 5 April 2007 that the United States had inadequate procedures to guarantee the human rights of foreign detainees at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba. He demanded a \\"more robust\\" system to determine whether to release hundreds of men who probably will never face trial.Washington Post. 5 Apr 2007.ICRC Chief Faults Rights Protection at Guantanamo. Jakob Kellenberger set great store by a clear strategy for the organization and the adoption of clear positions in a rapidly changing environment. He made a major contribution to achieving those goals.

It hosted the international national Health Fair of 1926 and the huge cultural NSDAP Exhibition of 1937. The waterfront on the Rhine, the Rheinpark Golzheim, owes its shape to these exhibitions. Started in 1947, the annual D√ºsseldorf Trade Fair was held in Golzheim in the Ehrenhof complex, until the new exhibition grounds were built next to the airport in 1971. Many of the apartments, surrounding the area of Kaiserswerther Stra√üe and Uerdinger Stra√üe, were used as holiday apartments for members of the German Armed Forces in the 1930s. From the air, gun emplacements can still be seen on top of these apartments and these were used to defend D√ºsseldorf during World War II. Since 1958 Golzheim is the place of the New Synagogue of D√ºsseldorf, which is the religious center for about 7.500 members of the local Jewish community, the third largest in Germany.  Economy and infrastructure  Golzheim is one of the most prestigious office addresses in the city.\\"New Perspectives: Market Report for Germany 2004\\" Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Immobilienfonds The tallest building is the Sky Office at 22 stories which was completed in 2006. On the Ehrenhof are the NRW-Forum Kultur und Wirtschaft (North-Rhine Westphalia Forum for Culture and Trade), and the art museum (Museum Kunst Palast). The Tonhalle D√ºsseldorf (concert hall), located next to Oberkassel bridge on the Rhine, used to be a planetarium. It and the Rheinpark Golzheim are important places for events. Trees in Rheinpark Golzheim taken October 13, 2005 The land for the park was reclaimed from an old harbor basin in 1900 in preparation for the 1902 Exhibition, and was used for exhibition and trade fair purposes until 1926. After the international Health Fair of 1926, which had 7.5 million visitors, the area was turned into a park. Originally called \\"Kaiser-Wilhelm- Park\\", the Rheinpark Golzheim is not a classical park, but is more of a greenbelt, 24 hectares, between Cecilienallee and the Rhine, from the Oberkassel bridge to the Theodor Heuss bridge, with arranged copses of trees and plenty of open lawn for sunbathing and amateur volleyball games. The Circus Roncalli is located year-round in the park, and in the summer a local brewery sponsors an open-air cinema. Geography Golzheim has an area of 2.64 km2, 10,248 inhabitants and therefore a density of 3,882 inhabitants/km2. Golzheim borders on the Rhine to the west, on Pempelfort to the south, on Kaiserswerth to the north, and on Derendorf to the east.

Background  = Jews in 1930s Germany = At the end of the 1920s, most German Jews were loyal to Germany, assimilated and relatively prosperous. They served in the German army and contributed to every field of German science, business and culture. After the Nazis were elected to power in 1933, the state-sponsored anti-Semitic persecution such as the Nuremberg Laws (1935) and the Kristallnacht (1938) drove masses of German Jews to seek asylum abroad, with over 304,500 German Jews choosing to emigrate, 1933-1939. Chaim Weizmann wrote in 1936, \\"The world seemed to be divided into two parts‚Äîthose places where the Jews could not live and those where they could not enter.\\"Manchester Guardian, May 23, 1936, cited in A.J. Sherman, Island Refuge, Britain and the Refugees from the Third Reich, 1933‚Äì1939, (London, Elek Books Ltd, 1973), p.112, also in The Evian Conference ‚Äî Hitler's Green Light for Genocide by Annette Shaw During the 1930s, there was a growing military conflict between Japan and China. The influential Japanese statesman Prince Iyesato Tokugawa attempted to stop or at least contain this conflict. In 1934, the International Red Cross held its conference in Tokyo, Japan, where Prince Iyesato Tokugawa presided. Prince Tokugawa was well aware of the plight of the Jews in Europe due to the growing Nazi movement, and also of the danger to Chinese civilians resulting from the Japan China conflict. Based on these significant humanitarian needs, Prince Tokugawa guided the 1934 International Red Cross Conference to establish ‚Äòsafe zones‚Äô in Japanese controlled cities in China, such as Shanghai. These demilitarized areas provided safe havens where tens of thousands of European Jewish refugees could escape to from the growing horrors of the holocaust, and also a place where a half million Chinese civilians could find safety. The Evian Conference demonstrated that by the end of the 1930s it was almost impossible to find a destination open for Jewish immigration. According to Dana Janklowicz-Mann: > Jewish men were being picked up and put into concentration camps. They were > told you have X amount of time to leave‚Äîtwo weeks, a month‚Äîif you can find a > country that will take you.

It started as a rumor in Vienna... ‚ÄòThere's > a place you can go where you don't need a visa. They have free entry.‚Äô It > just spread like fire and whoever could, went for it.Europe's Harms to > China's Arms by Sally Ogle Davis and Ivor Davis (Jewish Journal) October 4, > 2002 = Shanghai after 1937 = The International Settlement of Shanghai was established by the Treaty of Nanking. Police, jurisdiction and passport control were implemented by the foreign autonomous board. Under the Unequal Treaties between China and European countries, visas were only required to book tickets departing from Europe. Following the Battle of Shanghai in 1937, the city was occupied by the army of Imperial Japan, and the port began to allow entry without visa or passport. By the time when most German Jews arrived, two other Jewish communities had already settled in the city: the wealthy Baghdadi Jews, including the Kadoorie and Sassoon families, and the Russian Jews. The last ones fled the Russian Empire because of anti-Semitic pogroms pushed by the tsarist regime and counter-revolutionary armies as well as the class struggle manifested by the Bolsheviks. They had formed the Russian community in Harbin, then the Russian community in Shanghai. = Chiune Sugihara, Jan Zwartendijk and Tadeusz Romer = Many in the Polish- Lithuanian Jewish community were saved by Chiune Sugihara, the Japanese consul in Kaunas, Lithuania, and Jan Zwartendijk, director of the Philips manufacturing plants in Lithuania and part-time acting consul of the Dutch government-in-exile. The refugees fled across the vast territory of Russia by train to Vladivostok and then by boat to Kobe in Japan. The refugees, totaling 2,185, arrived in Japan from August 1940 to June 1941. Tadeusz Romer, the Polish ambassador in Tokyo, had managed to get transit visas in Japan, asylum visas to Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Burma, immigration certificates to Palestine, and immigrant visas to the United States and some Latin American countries. Tadeusz Romer moved to Shanghai on November 1, 1941, where he continued to act for Jewish refugees. Among those saved in the Shanghai Ghetto were leaders and students of Mir yeshiva, the only yeshiva in occupied Europe to survive the Holocaust. 1940 issued visa by consul Sugihara in Lithuania = Arrival of Ashkenazi Jews = Current view of once important business area in the ghetto, Huoshan Road The refugees who managed to purchase tickets for luxurious Italian and Japanese cruise steamships departing from Genoa later described their three-week journey with plenty of food and entertainment‚Äîbetween persecution in Germany and squalid ghetto in Shanghai‚Äîas surreal. Some passengers attempted to make unscheduled departures in Egypt, hoping to smuggle themselves into the British Mandate of Palestine. The first German Jewish refugees‚Äîtwenty-six families, among them five well-known physicians‚Äîhad already arrived in Shanghai by November 1933. By the spring of 1934, there were reportedly eighty refugee physicians, surgeons, and dentists in China. On August 15, 1938, the first Jewish refugees from Anschluss Austria arrived by Italian ship. Most of the refugees arrived after Kristallnacht. During the refugee flight to Shanghai between November 1938 and June 1941, the total number of arrivals by sea and land has been estimated at 1,374 in 1938; 12,089 in 1939; 1,988 in 1940; and 4,000 in 1941. In 1939-1940, Lloyd Triestino ran a sort of \\"ferry service\\" between Italy and Shanghai, bringing in thousands of refugees a month - Germans, Austrians, and a few Czechs. Added to this mix were approximately 1,000 Polish Jews in 1941. Among these were the entire faculty of the Mir Yeshiva, some 400 in number, who with the outbreak of World War II in 1939, fled from Mir to Vilna and then to Keidan, Lithuania. In late 1940, they obtained visas from Chiune Sugihara, the Japanese consul in Kaunas, to travel from Keidan, then Lithuanian SSR, via Siberia and Vladivostok to Kobe, Japan.Shanghai Jewish History By November 1941 the Japanese moved this group and most of others on to the Shanghai Ghetto in order to consolidate the Jews under their control. Finally, a wave of more than 18,000 Ashkenazi Jews from Germany, Austria, and Poland immigrated to Shanghai; that ended with the Attack on Pearl Harbor by Japan in December 1941. The Ohel Moshe Synagogue served as a religious center for the Russian Jewish community since 1907; it is currently the Shanghai Jewish Refugees Museum. In April 1941, a modern Ashkenazic Jewish synagogue was built (called the New Synagogue). Much-needed aid was provided by International Committee for European Immigrants (IC), established by Victor Sassoon and Paul Komor, a Hungarian businessman, and the Committee for the Assistance of European Jewish Refugees (CFA), founded by Horace Kadoorie, under the direction of Michael Speelman. These organizations prepared the housing in Hongkou, a relatively cheap suburb compared with the Shanghai International Settlement or the Shanghai French Concession. Refugees were accommodated in shabby apartments and six camps in a former school. The Japanese occupiers of Shanghai regarded German Jews as \\"stateless persons\\", because Nazi Germany treated them so.  Life in the restricted sector  A Jewish girl and her Chinese friends in the Shanghai Ghetto, from the collection of the Shanghai Jewish Refugees Museum Former site of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee The authorities were unprepared for massive immigration and the arriving refugees faced harsh conditions in the impoverished Hongkou District: 10 per room, near-starvation, disastrous sanitation, and scant employment. The Baghdadis and later the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee (JDC) provided some assistance with the housing and food problems. Faced with language barriers, extreme poverty, rampant disease, and isolation, the refugees still were able to transition from being supported by welfare agencies to establishing a functioning community. Jewish cultural life flourished: schools were established, newspapers were published, theaters produced plays, sports teams participated in training and competitions, and even cabarets thrived.The Ghosts of Shanghai by Ron Gluckman There is evidence that some Jewish men married Chinese women in Shanghai. Although not numerous, ‚Äúthe fact that interracial marriages were able to take place among the relatively conservative Jewish communities demonstrated the considerable degree of cultural interaction between the Jews and the Chinese‚Äù in Shanghai.Zhou Qingyang, ‚ÄúInteractions Between the Chinese and the Jewish Refugees in Shanghai During World War II,‚Äù Penn History Review 25(2), 2018, 50‚Äì88 (68). = After Pearl Harbor (1941‚Äì1943) = After Japanese forces attacked Pearl Harbor, the wealthy Baghdadi Jews (many of whom were British subjects) were interned, and American charitable funds ceased. As communication with the US was banned and broken, unemployment and inflation intensified, and times got harder for the refugees. The JDC liaison Laura Margolis, who came to Shanghai, attempted to stabilize the situation by getting permission from the Japanese authorities to continue her fundraising effort, turning for assistance to the Russian Jews who arrived before 1937 and were exempt from the new restrictions.Special Tributes. Laura Margolis, Rescuer of Jews A Testimonial by Ernest G. Heppner, Author of Interactions Between the Chinese and the Jewish Refugees in Shanghai During World War II Refuge: A Memoir of the World War II Jewish Ghetto  German requests, 1942-1944  During a trial in Germany relating to the Shanghai Ghetto, Fritz Wiedemann reported that Josef Meisinger had told him that he got the order from Himmler to persuade the Japanese to take measures against the Jews. According to Wiedemann, Meisinger certainly could not have done this in form of a command to the Japanese. Since most Japanese were not anti-Semitic, Meisinger used their fear of espionage to achieve his goal. In fall 1942 he conferred with the head of the foreign section of the Japanese Home Ministry. Meisinger explained, that he had orders from Berlin to give the Japanese authorities all the names of \\"anti-Nazis\\" among the German community. He explained that \\"anti-Nazis\\" were primarily German Jews, of whom 20,000 had emigrated to Shanghai. These \\"anti-Nazis\\" were always \\"anti-Japanese\\" too. Later a subordinate, the interpreter of Meisinger, Karl Hamel, reported to CIC agents, that the Japanese, after some consideration, believed in this thesis. According to Hamel, this led to a veritable chase of \\"anti-Nazis\\" and to the internment of many people. In response, the Japanese demanded from Meisinger to compile a list of all \\"anti- Nazis.\\" As his personal secretary later confirmed, this list had already been prepared by Meisinger in 1941. After consultation of General M√ºller in Berlin, it was handed over by Meisinger to the Japanese Home Ministry and to the Kenpeitai at the end of 1942. The list contained the names of all Jews with a German passport in Japan. For the Japanese this official document made clear, that in particular the large number of refugees, who had fled to Shanghai from 1937 onwards, represented the highest \\"risk potential\\". So the proclamation of a ghetto was just a logical consequence of Meisinger's intervention. This way Meisinger succeeded, despite the barely existing anti-Semitism of the Japanese, to achieve his goal: The internment of a large part of the Jews in the Japanese sphere of influence. Apparently for this \\"success\\" he was promoted Colonel of the police on February 6, 1943, despite the Richard Sorge affair. These informations were kept secret by US authorities and were not used in civil proceedings of ghetto inmates to gain redress. That is why, for example in the case of a woman who was interned in the ghetto, a German court came to the conclusion, that even though there was a probability that Meisinger tried to encourage the Japanese to take action against Jews, the establishment of the ghetto in Shanghai was \\"solely based on Japanese initiative\\". On November 15, 1942, the idea of a restricted ghetto was approved, which was after the visit of Shanghai by Meisinger. As World War II intensified, the Nazis stepped up pressure on Japan to hand over the Shanghai Jews. While the Nazis regarded their Japanese allies as \\"Honorary Aryans\\", they were determined that the Final Solution to the Jewish Question also be applied to the Jews in Shanghai. Warren Kozak describes the episode when the Japanese military governor of the city sent for the Jewish community leaders. The delegation included Amshinover rabbi Shimon Sholom Kalish. The Japanese governor was curious and asked \\"Why do the Germans hate you so much?\\" > Without hesitation and knowing the fate of his community hung on his answer, > Reb Kalish told the translator (in Yiddish): \\"Zugim weil wir senen > orientalim‚ÄîTell him [the Germans hate us] because we are Orientals.\\" The > governor, whose face had been stern throughout the confrontation, broke into > a slight smile. In spite of the military alliance, he did not accede to the > German demand and the Shanghai Jews were never handed over.The Rabbi of 84th > Street: The Extraordinary Life of Haskel Besser by Warren Kozak > (HarperCollins, 2004) p.177 \\"Residences, Businesses of City's Stateless Refugees Limited to Restricted Sector\\". (Shanghai Herald newspaper, February 18, 1943) According to another rabbi who was present there, Reb Kalish' answer was \\"They hate us because we are short and dark-haired.\\" Orientalim was not likely to have been said because the word is an Israeli academic term in modern Hebrew, not a word in classical Yiddish or Hebrew.  Creation of the Shanghai Ghetto  On February 18, 1943, the occupying Japanese authorities declared a \\"Designated Area for Stateless Refugees\\" and ordered those who arrived after 1937 to move their residences and businesses within it by May 18, three months later. The stateless refugees needed permission from the Japanese to dispose of their property; others needed permission to move into the ghetto. About 18,000 Jews were forced to relocate to a 3/4 square mile area of Shanghai's Hongkou district, where many lived in group homes called \\"Heime\\" or \\"Little Vienna\\". The English version of the order read: While this area was not walled or surrounded with barbed wire, it was patrolled and a curfew enforced in its precincts. Food was rationed, and everyone needed passes to enter or leave the ghetto. Polish Jew's passport registration inside the ghetto (1943) 1942 Polish Association ID issued to a Jewish man living inside the Ghetto. According to Dr. David Kranzler, > Thus, about half of the approximately 16,000 refugees, who had overcome > great obstacles and had found a means of livelihood and residence outside > the 'designated area' were forced to leave their homes and businesses for a > second time and to relocate into a crowded, squalid area of less than one > square mile with its own population of an estimated 100,000 Chinese and > 8,000 refugees.Japanese, Nazis and Jews: The Jewish Refugee Community in > Shanghai, 1938‚Äì1945 by David Kranzler, p.491. Although a few temporary passes were issued to work and to 16 students of St. Francis Xavier College, outside the ghetto, these were granted arbitrarily and were severely curtailed after the first year. But the fact that the Chinese who lived within the Hongkou ghetto did not leave meant the Jews were not isolated. Nevertheless, economic conditions worsened; psychological adjustment to ghettoization was difficult; the winter of 1943 was severe and hunger was widespread. The US air raids on Shanghai began in 1944. There were no bomb shelters in Hongkou because the water table was close to the surface. The most devastating raid started on July 17, 1945, and was the first attack that hit Hongkou. Thirty-eight refugees and hundreds of Chinese were killed in the 17 July raid. The bombings by the US 7th Air Force continued daily until early August, when the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and the Japanese government surrendered shortly thereafter.Refugees in the ghetto, improvised their own shelters, with one family surviving the bombing under a bed with a second mattress on top, mounted on two desks. Some Jews of the Shanghai ghetto took part in the resistance movement. They participated in an underground network to obtain and circulate information and were involved in some minor sabotage and in providing assistance to downed Allied aircrews.  After liberation  The ghetto was officially liberated on September 3, 1945, after some delay to allow Chiang Kai-shek's army to take political credit for the liberation of Shanghai. With the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 and the fall of Chiang Kai-shek in 1949, almost all the Shanghai ghetto Jews left. By 1957, only 100 remained; today only a few may still live there. The Government of Israel bestowed the honor of the Righteous Among the Nations to Chiune Sugihara in 1985 and to Ho Feng Shan in 2001. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between Israel and China in 1992, the connection between the Jewish people and Shanghai has been recognised in various ways. In 2007, the Israeli consulate-general in Shanghai donated 660,000 Yuan, provided by 26 Israeli companies, to community projects in Hongkou District, in recognition of the safe harbour provided by the ghetto.China News Agency. 2006-06-07 ‰ª•Ëâ≤Âàó‰ºÅ‰∏öÊçêÊ¨æ‰∏äÊµ∑ ÊÑüË∞¢‰∫åÊàòÊó∂Êé•Á∫≥ÁäπÂ§™ÈöæÊ∞ë (Israeli companies donate to Shanghai - gratitude for accepting Jewish refugees in World War II).

The device consisted of multiple aluminium cylinders, 2 meters in length and 1 meter in diameter, antennae for detecting gravitational waves. History Around 1968, Weber collected what he concluded to be \\"good evidence\\" of the theorized phenomenon. However, his experiments were duplicated many times, always with a null result. Such experiments conducted by Joseph Weber were very controversial, and his positive results with the apparatus, in particular his claim to have detected gravitational waves from SN1987A in 1987, were widely discredited. Criticisms of the study have focused on Weber's data analysis and his incomplete definitions of what strength vibration would signify a passing gravitational wave.

The garden contains eight of the cores of Weber's bar detectors.  Mechanism  These massive aluminium cylinders vibrated at a resonance frequency of 1660 hertz and were designed to be set in motion by gravitational waves predicted by Weber. Because these waves were supposed to be so weak, the cylinders had to be massive and the piezoelectric sensors had to be very sensitive, capable of detecting a change in the cylinders' lengths by about 10‚àí16 meters.

The street runs east-west, sometimes called north-south because the western end is nearer to the Financial District. At the north end of Park Row is the confluence of Bowery, East Broadway, St. James Place, Oliver Street, Mott Street, and Worth Street at Chatham Square. At the street's south end, Broadway, Vesey Street, Barclay Street, and Ann Street intersect. The intersection includes a bus turnaround loop designated as Millennium Park. Park Row was once known as Chatham Street; it was renamed Park Row in 1886, a reference to the fact that it faces City Hall Park, the former New York Common. History =Early history= In the late 18th century Eastern Post Road became the more important road connecting New York to Albany and New England. This section of the road which became Park Row was called Chatham Street, a name that enters into the city's history on numerous occasions. Printing House Square in 1868 Park Row after 1905. Buildings from bottom left clockwise are: New York City Hall; the New York World Building, also known as the Pulitzer Building (with spherical top) which housed the New York World newspaper (now the site of one of the Brooklyn Bridge entrance ramps); the 1873 New Yorker Staats-Zeitung Building, also later demolished; the New York Tribune Building with the spire top (today the site of the Pace Plaza complex of Pace University); the New York Times Building (19th century home of The New York Times, today a building of Pace University); the American Tract Society Building, visible behind the Times Building; and, cut off from the picture, the Potter Building. The tobacco industry in New York City got its start in 1760, when Pierre Lorillard opened a snuff factory on Chatham Street,Burrows & Wallace (1999), p.1046 and in 1795, the Long Room of Abraham Martling's Tavern on Chatham Street was one of the first headquarters used by the Tammany Society and the Democratic- Republican Party on election days. Those who gathered there became known as \\"Martling Men\\", \\"Tammanyites\\" or \\"Bucktails\\", especially during the time that Tammany was attempting to wrest control of the party away from governor De Witt Clinton.Burrows & Wallace (1999), pp.322,424 In the 1780s, Chatham Street was the site of the Tea Water Pump, a privately owned company which took water from Fresh Water Pond, the city's only supply of fresh water, and which remained purer longer than some of the other sources which drew from the pond.Burrows & Wallace (1999), p.360 Chatham Street was also a center for entertainment. In 1798, Marc Isambard Brunel designed the 2,000-seat Park Theater on Chatham Street, intended to attract the upper classes of the city. The theater cost $130,000 to build, and tickets were 25 cents for seats in the gallery, and 50 cents in the orchestra. In the early 1800s, more taverns, theaters and small hotels on the street started to offer free entertain to attract customers to drink. These were called \\"free and easies\\", \\"varieties\\" or \\"vaudeville\\" and offered numerous different kinds of performances: comedy, dance, dramatic skits, magic, music, ventriloquism, and tellers of tall tales. New theaters such as the Chatham Theater sprang up as well to attract the overflow from the entertainment strip on the Bowery.Burrows & Wallace (1999), pp.375,404,642 Boxing was also a popular entertainment. The Arena on Park Row packed in fans with its nightly presentation of \\"the manly art\\".Burrows & Wallace (1999), p.755 Early in the 19th century most of the Manhattan portion of the street was suppressed, the Commons became City Hall Park, and the stub of a street was renamed Park Row. By the mid-19th century, the street had a bazaar-like atmosphere from the many used clothing shops and pawnbrokerages open by recently immigrated Jews from Germany and central Europe. This gave rise to anti-Semitic caricatures, although many New Yorkers could not distinguish German Jews from other Germans.Burrows & Wallace (1999), pp.740,749 Chatham Street was also the site of several anti-African American incidents, as in the 1863 New York City draft riots, in which rioters were repulsed in their attempt to attack black waiters at Crook's Restaurant on the street.Burrows & Wallace (1999), p.890 Poverty was also commonplace; in 1890, Jacob Riis revealed in How the Other Half Lives that over 9,000 homeless men lodged nightly on Chatham Street and the Bowery, between City Hall and the Cooper Union.Burrows & Wallace (1999), p.1182 = Newspaper era = Ernst Plassman's statue of Benjamin Franklin During the late 19th century, Park Row was nicknamed Newspaper Row, as most of New York City's newspapers located on the street to be close to City Hall. Among the earlier newspapers in the area were The New York Times, which in 1857 became the first New York City newspaper to be housed in a structure built specially for its use. Part of the southern section of the street, centered on the intersection with Spruce Street, was known as Printing House Square. The newspapers housed on Newspaper Row, combined, printed more than 250,000 copies per day at their peak, leading the area to be considered \\"America's preeminent press center\\". Other papers, such as the New York Herald and The Sun, were near Newspaper Row but not actually housed on Park Row itself. The newspapers on Chatham Street would be among the first to construct early skyscrapers for their headquarters, reflecting their newfound wealth. The first of these major newspaper buildings, the New York Tribune Building, opened in 1875 as a nine-story, structure; the headquarters of the New-York Tribune was then the city's second-tallest building after Trinity Church. The next major structure to open was a new New York Times building at 41 Park Row, which was completed in 1889 and stood 13 stories tall. The third early skyscraper on Newspaper Row was the 20-story New York World Building, the New York World headquarters, which at a height of was the first building in the city to be taller than Trinity Church. The Times and Tribune Buildings were both expanded in the first decade of the 20th century. Two other buildings on Park Row were also part of Newspaper Row but not built specifically for newspapers' use. The Potter Building, at 38 Park Row, contained tenants such as The Press, a Republican Party-affiliated penny paper, as well as The New York Observer. The Park Row Building, at 15 Park Row, housed the early headquarters of the Associated Press. The decline of Park Row as a newspaper hub began in 1895, when the Herald moved to Herald Square. Ten years later, the Times moved to its new headquarters at One Times Square. The Tribune moved uptown in 1923, while the World shuttered in 1931. The Journal of Commerce, the last remaining newspaper to publish from Park Row, moved from its headquarters in the World Building in 1953. Today, a statue of Benjamin Franklin by Ernst Plassman stands in Printing House Square, in front of the One Pace Plaza and 41 Park Row buildings of Pace University, holding a copy of his Pennsylvania Gazette, a reminder of what Park Row once was. = Later years = After the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge in 1883, Park Row was the site of the large Park Row Terminal for the elevated trains and cable-hauled shuttle cars which crossed the bridge. Service was gradually reduced from 1913 to 1940, and the terminal was demolished in 1944.Sparberg, Andrew \\"Park Row\\" in Until 1971, Park Row continued in a relatively straight path, except for a curved portion around the Brooklyn Bridge's ramps. Between 1971 and 1973, a pedestrian plaza was built as part of 1 Police Plaza, Park Row was rerouted underneath the plaza, and its intersection with New Chambers Street and Duane Street was eliminated. Structures The New York Times was originally located at 113 Nassau Street in 1851. It moved to 138 Nassau Street in 1854, and in 1858 it moved a little more than one block away to 41 Park Row, possibly making it the first newspaper in New York City housed in a building built specifically for its use. The New York Times Building, which was designed by George B. Post, was designated a New York City landmark in 1999. The building is now used by Pace University. The New Yorker Staats-Zeitung moved to its own building at 17 Chatham Street at almost the same time as the Times moved into its new building.An Epitome of the New-Yorker Staats-Zeitung's Sixty-Five Years of Progress. 1899. Complimentary pamphlet prepared and distributed by the Staats- Zeitung to describe its history and new press capacity. This source indicates that the Staats-Zeitung was publishing from its building on Chatham Street no later than April 1858, and possibly as early as a year prior to that.Burrows & Wallace (1999), p.943 The Park Row Building (also known as 15 Park Row) is located at the western end of Park Row, opposite City Hall Park. Designed by noted architect R. H. Robertson, and built in 1896-99, It was designated a city landmark in 1999. At tall it was the tallest office building in the world from 1899 until 1908, when it was surpassed by the Singer Building. The Potter Building at 38 Park Row (145 Nassau Street) was built in 1882-86 and designated a New York City landmark in 1996. It was built after the owner's previous building on the site burned down. The Potter Building was converted into apartments between 1979 and 1981. The New York City Police Department is headquartered at 1 Police Plaza located on Park Row, across the street from the Manhattan Municipal BuildingBuckley, Cara. \\"Chinatown Residents Frustrated Over Street Closed Since 9/11\\", The New York Times, September 24, 2007. \\"The Police Department says that most of Park Row has to be blocked off to protect its headquarters, called One Police Plaza, against terrorist threats, particularly truck bombs.\\" and Metropolitan Correctional Center. Two apartment buildings of significance on Park Row are the Chatham Towers at no. 170, built in 1965 and designed by Kelly & Gruzen, which, according to the AIA Guide to New York City, makes a \\"strong architectural statement...[which] rouses great admiration and great criticism,\\" and Chatham Green at 185 Park Row, built in 1961 and also designed by Kelly & Gruzen. Park Row terminal can be seen at the right Police Plaza closure The segment of Park Row between Frankfort Street and Chatham Square is open only to MTA buses and government and emergency vehicles. The section of Park Row has been closed to civilian traffic since the September 11, 2001, attacks. The NYPD asserts that this is necessary to protect its headquarters from a truck bomb attack. Chinatown residents are increasingly frustrated at the disruption caused by the closure of the thoroughfare, especially nearby residents. People who live nearby argue that the police department has placed a chokehold on an entire neighborhood and suggest One Police Plaza be moved from a residential area. Members of the Civic Center Residents Coalition have been fighting the security perimeter around the building for years. The NYPD has stated that it will not move despite the numerous complaints from residents, explaining that they had tried to alleviate the impact of the security measures by forbidding officers from parking in nearby public spaces and reopening a stairway that skirts the headquarter's south side and leads down to street level near the Brooklyn Bridge. The department also plans to redesign its guard booths and security barriers to make them more attractive, and was involved in efforts to convert two lanes of Park Row into a cycling and pedestrian greenway which opened in June 2018.

This solitary village in the Malana Nala, a side valley of the Parvati Valley to the north-east of Kullu Valley, is isolated from the rest of the world. The peaks of Chanderkhani and Deo Tibba shadow the village. It is situated on a remote plateau by the side of the torrential Malana river, at a height of above sea level. Malana has its own lifestyle and social structure and people are strict in following their customs. Malana has been the subject of various documentaries, including Malana: Globalization of a Himalayan Village,Malana: Globalization of a Himalayan Village, 2010 and Malana, A Lost Identity.Malana, A Lost Identity The existing speakers of the autochthonous language Kanashi, the traditional language of the inhabitants of Malana, number approximately 1700. According to the 1961 census, the language speakers were then 563, but today the population of Malana is at least three times as large as 40 years ago.Malana : Shangrila in the Himalayas The most common route to the village is by taxi or bus from Jhari. One stop prior to Malana. Roads till Malana Village trekking gate are developed.  History  According to the local legends, Jamlu rishi (sage) inhabited this place and made rules and regulations. The locals claim it to be one of the oldest democracies of the world with a well-organized parliamentary system, guided by their devta (deity) Jamlu rishi.Kulu The End of the Habitable World By Penelope Chetwode page 89 Although Jamlu is currently identified with a sage from the Puranas, this is a relatively recent development. Jamlu is believed to have been worshipped in pre-Aryan times. Penelope Chetwood recounts a tale about an orthodox Brahmin priest, who visited Malana, and tried to educate the locals about the pedigree of their god, and what subsequently befell the hapless priest.Kulu The End of the Habitable World By Penelope Chetwode page 90 Malana has been called ‚Äòone of the oldest democracy‚Äô in the world. The villagers believe that they have pure Aryan genes and that they are descendants of Alexander the Great‚Äôs soldiers. A dam project, the Malana Hydro Power Station, has brought Malana much closer to the rest of the world and provides revenue for the region. A new road has shortened the walking time from several days to just 4 hours. The Hydro Malana Project has also ruined the beauty of the valley. In 2004, Malana was adopted by Aryan Sharma, a businessman based in Delhi. On 5 January 2008, a raging fire in the village, which burnt for more than 5 hours, destroyed cultural structures and parts of ancient temples located in the village. In 2017, the village ordered the closure of approximately a dozen guest houses and restaurants, ostensibly on the orders of the deity Jamlu. Government The village is governed by a bicameral parliament, consisting of lower house called the Kanishthang and an upper house called the Jayeshthang. The current panchayat is Bhagi Ram. Language The residents of Malana speak Kanashi/Raksh (supposedly the dialect of devils residing there long ago),\\"About Malana\\" which is understood only by the villagers. \\"Kanashi, the language of Malana, does not resemble any of the dialects spoken in its neighbourhood but seems to be a mixture of Sanskrit and several Tibetan dialects.\\"Dr. Virendra Bangroo, \\"Malana: A Lost Utopia In The Himalayas,\\" http://ignca.nic.in/nl002401.htm Ethnologue, citing a reference from 2002, classifies Malana as a Tibetan-Burmese language, rather than as a member of the Indo-European languages,Lewis, M. Paul (ed.), 2009. Ethnologue: Languages of the World, Sixteenth edition. Dallas, Tex.: SIL International, \\"Kanashi, a language of India,\\" http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=xns and notes that Kanashi has some intelligibility with any Tibeto-Burman language of Kinnaur\\" although Malana is surrounded by Indo-Aryan language speaking populations. Economy The economy of Malana was traditionally based on making baskets, ropes and slippers from hemp. Marijuana was cultivated as a legal cash crop for centuries. Beginning in the 1980s, Malana became a destination for recreational drug tourism. The village also produces maize and potatoes. While tourism is now a major source of income for the village, recently a ban has been placed preventing the tourists from staying overnight at the village. Apparently, this has been done to protect the village from corrupting influence of the outside world. As a result, hotels and guest houses by the outsiders have been closed down. Tourists can visit during daytime and leave before it is dark or they can stay in few home stays owned by locals. Culture and lifestyle The village administration is democratic and is believed, by locals, to be the oldest republic of the world. Despite being a part of the Kullu valley, there is a myth that the Malanis have very distinct physical features, and a dialect which is different from the rest of the valley. However, in the valleys of Himachal, there are a significant number of distinct Pahadi dialects, some of them totally different from each other. Hence the physical/lingual uniqueness cannot be proven, given the inaccessibility of the Malana people, except for the trade of Marijuana / Hashish in the Parvati valley. =Jamblu Devta= The social structure of Malana in fact rests on villagers' unshaken faith in their powerful deity, Jamblu Devta. The entire administration of the village is controlled by him through a village council. This council has eleven members and they are believed as delegates of Jamblu who govern the village in his name. His decision is ultimate in any dispute and any outsider authority is never required. Thus Malana has been named the Athens of Himalayas.Malana (Manali): Ath√®nes de l'Himalaya Jamlu is invoked through a villager serving as an oracle. deity Jamalu known as Rishi Jamdagni. =Hellenic connection= There are various legends about their origin. According to one of them, it is believed that they are the descendants of Greek soldiers of Alexander's army. As the legend goes, some soldiers took refuge in this remote land after Alexander left the country and later settled there permanently. This myth is however disputed because there are those who claim that it is the valley of Kalash, in Pakistan that is actually the area in which Alexander the Great's soldiers took refuge. This legend is also inconsistent with the legendary descent of the local people from Indo-Aryans who would pre-date Alexander the Great's soldiers by approximately a thousand years. Recent genetic typing of the Malani population is much more consistent with an Indo-Aryan origin with a large proportion of Y-DNA haplotypes J2 and R1a which are the haplotypes of majority of Indians, North or South in South Asia rather than with a Greek origin which would have a different characteristic mix of Y-DNA haplotypes such as R2b. J2 and R1a are paternal lineages found in more than 20% and 40% of population of North/South India but are rare in Mediterranean societies like Greece. =Temples= The village has several ancient temples. (1) Jamlu temple, built in Kathkuni style, with wooden carving and deer heads (2) Rukmini temple =Malana Cream= Malana is famous for its ‚ÄúMalana Cream‚Äù, a product made from cannabis plants which grow in the Parvati valley. Malana cream is regarded as high purity hash. In order to make Malana Cream the live cannabis flower is rubbed between the hands repeatedly, pulling out the resin to generate a layer of sticky hashish across the palm.https://www.hindustantimes.com/travel/among-the-world-s-top-stoner-spots- malana-now-cannot-do-without-marijuana/story-rbiWwsRw44NcIjcCQyIvjM.html  References  External links * Top Secrets of Malana Village * MALANA * Malana : Shangrila in the Himalayas * Himalayan Culture and Mountaineering Museum * https://m.imdb.com/title/tt1951087/ Category:Kullu Category:Villages in Kullu district ","title":"Malana, Himachal Pradesh"},{"id":"5055628","text":"Handies Peak is a high and prominent mountain summit of the San Juan Mountains range in the Rocky Mountains of North America.

This is followed up by Bugs narrating how Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies immediately replaced baggy-pants comedy before introducing us to \\"a warm-hearted humble little introvert called Yosemite Sam\\". =Act 1: Satan's Waitin'= Yosemite Sam courts Granny with evil intentions for the $50,000,000 she has inherited, but Bugs overhears his scheming and thwarts Sam under the guise of another suitor and later Granny herself. In the end, Sam dies after being crushed by a safe that Bugs drops on him and lands in Hell. Satan offers to give Sam another chance in life provided he sends someone in his place. Sam agrees to this and, as a Roman guard captain, an Arab, and in his usual cowboy guise, attempts to kill Bugs. His attempts are unsuccessful, but when Satan keeps offering him one more chance, Sam refuses, stating Satan should get the rabbit himself and decides to stay. =Act 2: The Unmentionables= Bugs Bunny explains about cops and robbers, as well as gangster films. In Act 2, there are three cartoons dedicated to the gangster character, Rocky. Immediately after becoming a police detective (with the codename \\"Elegant Mess\\"), Bugs is captured by Rocky and his gang, who try to drown him. Bugs promptly escapes that and then infiltrates Rocky's birthday party that night, disguised as a showgirl. Rocky soon sees through Bugs' disguise and, accompanied by Mugsy, chases him into a cereal factory, where Bugs traps the pair on the cereal manufacturing machine. Afterwards, he brings Rocky to court, but thanks to some manipulations and obfuscating legalese by Rocky's sleazy and unethical lawyer at his trial, the mobster is free to go. Bugs has problems finding Rocky's new hideout until word breaks out of farmer Porky Pig's golden egg, which was apparently laid by Daffy Duck. Upon reading of this, Rocky and his men capture Daffy and demand him to lay a golden egg. He eventually does after Rocky shoots him in the head, and is then ordered to lay more to fill up their collection of egg cartons. Bugs and the police suddenly bust in and arrest Rocky's troop. But another law loophole sets Rocky free again. Rocky then captures Tweety and holds him for ransom, and Bugs appoints Sylvester to find Tweety and pins a badge on his chest leaving him yelping in pain. Sure enough, the pussycat finds Tweety in Rocky's hideout. After several failed attempts by Sylvester to free Tweety, the police arrive and surround Rocky's hideout. Sylvester ends up being hailed as a hero for having seemingly rescued Tweety, and Bugs brings Rocky to justice, but is forced to go to jail with him and Mugsy (who was likely arrested too) because he lost the keys to his handcuffs. =Act 3: The Oswalds= In the third and final act, Bugs introduces the Oswald Awards, an award ceremony created by Friz for animated characters. He then hosts the ceremony himself, announcing the nominees - the Wolf from Three Little Bops, Sylvester & Tweety and himself. During Bugs' show, Daffy talks to an impressed Yosemite Sam, who then yells at him to shut up, which sends Daffy right into Granny's arms who glares at him and an angry Sam. After Sylvester and Tweety's performance, Clarence devours Tweety, and Sylvester and Granny both grab Tweety back from him. In the meantime, Daffy continually gripes about the fact that he has not been nominated. When Bugs wins the award, an infuriated Daffy challenges Bugs to a talent showdown. Bugs seems to have the audience's favor, but Daffy ultimately wins their applause by blowing himself up. Bugs gives the now-ghostly Daffy the award, with the duck responding, \\"It just goes to show you, you gotta kill yourself to win an Oswald in this town!\\" =\\"That's all Folks!\\"= There was no outro/send-off for this film, because after the third and final act, Bugs, at first, does the \\"That's all Folks!\\" send-off, but then Porky tells Bugs that it was his line. Bugs then allows Porky to do the send off, but sadly, before he could do the chance, the Iris-Door used in the opening credits, instantly closes on him, Porky just grumbles and says, \\"D-D- Dirty Guys\\" as the film fades out.

The character appeared in the Spider- Girl comic book series. JJ is the grandson of J. Jonah Jameson and the son of John Jameson. Publication history First appearing in the MC2 comic book series Spider-Girl, the Buzz went on to have his own limited series. Fictional character biography Jack Jameson, or JJ to his friends, accompanied his grandfather, J. Jonah Jameson, C.E.O. of Jameson Communications (publisher of the Daily Bugle) to a demonstration of Project Human Fly. The project's goal was to create body armor that would grant the wearer superpowers. The staff of the project included Dr. Marla Jameson (Jonah's wife), biophysicist Dr. Sonja Jade and Robert Douglas, grandson of the late Joseph \\"Robbie\\" Robertson. It was then that JJ first met Buzz Bannon, a former Navy SEAL and the test pilot for the Human Fly armor. They quickly became friends. While JJ and Buzz were in the gym, Buzz received a message that he needed to attend a meeting about the Human Fly project, but it was a trap. Dr. Sonja Jade turned out to be a traitor who took Marla, Jonah Jameson and Buzz Bannon hostage and was stealing the project files and armor. While her minions went to retrieve the armor, JJ and Richie Robertson discovered what was happening and triggered a fire alarm. Buzz used the distraction to overcome most of his guards, but he was shot in the abdomen during the fight, while Richie was beaten unconscious. Buzz and JJ manage to escape and get to the armor. A few moments later, the Human Fly rescues the hostages and went after the villains, but Dr. Jade got away due to an explosion. Later on that evening Buzz Bannon's body was discovered. JJ had donned the armor, but he could not tell his grandfather (who, in a fit of rage, accused the Human Fly of killing Bannon). JJ knew that the body armor was the only way he could get revenge for Buzz's death. He kept the armor a secret from his grandfather and, in memory of his friend, called himself the Buzz. Richie, having seen Buzz die, agreed to help JJ with his armor from an electronics equipped van. With Richie's help, the Buzz was able to find and defeat Dr. Jade. The Buzz soon met Spider-Girl, but she was leery of him since she read in the Daily Bugle that he was a murderer. Buzz managed to convince her that he wasn't, and later helped her form a new team of New Warriors. Powers and abilities Jack Jameson has no superhuman abilities of his own, but his armor gives him superhuman strength and flight. His gauntlets can fire blasts of electricity (his \\"Bug Zapper\\") or ribbons of adhesive polymer (his \\"Fly Paper\\"). His goggles give him 360-degree vision. The neural interface of the armor is bonded specifically to Jameson and will not work for anyone else.

The California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment has issued a safe advisory for any fish caught in Castaic Lake and Castaic Lagoon due to elevated levels of mercury and PCBs. Description The lake, with a surface elevation of approximately above sea level, is the terminus of the West Branch California Aqueduct, though some comes from the Castaic Creek watershed above the dam. Castaic Lake is bisected by the Elderberry Forebay Dam, which creates the adjacent Elderberry Forebay. The aqueduct water comes from Pyramid Lake through the Angeles Tunnel and is used to power Castaic Power Plant, a pumped-storage hydroelectric facility on the northern end of the forebay. Water is mostly powering the turbines, rather than being pumped by them.Historic Pump-Storage Operation in WSCC, page 14 Castaic Lake is part of the Castaic Lake State Recreation Area. Primary access is via Interstate 5 at exits 176A and 176B at the town of Castaic. =Distribution= Water from the lake is distributed throughout the northern portion of the Greater Los Angeles Area. Some water is released into Castaic Lagoon below the dam, to maintain its water level for recreation. Castic Lagoon drains into Castaic Creek, which flows south until it meets the Santa Clara River, a few miles west of Santa Clarita.  Lake activities  Castaic Lake has a lower lagoon with a swim beach that is open from Memorial Day weekend to Labor Day weekend annually. This lake also offers bass fishing in the upper and lower lake year-round and float tube fishing in the lower lake.http://www.castaiclake.com/  In popular culture  Castaic Lake was one of the main filming locations for the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers series.

Everson invented the first suction-side pool vacuum cleaner in 2002 the first handheld/extended reach, battery-powered pool and spa vacuums were finally invented. They now come in many sizes for all applications Typical electric robotic pool cleaner Weda B480 robotic commercial pool cleaner for the largest public pools. They now come in many smaller sizes from several manufacturers with a wide array of sophisticated, computerized programs An automated pool cleaner is a vacuum cleaner intended to collect debris and sediment from swimming pools with minimal human intervention. It is one of several types of swimming pool vacuum cleaners. Other major types are battery- powered or manually powered wands, which are generally used for smaller pools and hot tubs, and battery-powered, handheld/extended reach pool and spa vacuums. The latter is powered by rechargeable batteries and can be handheld attached to a telescopic pole used for extended reach. These are used for small to medium-sized pools, larger spas, and to spot clean larger pools.  History  = Evolution = Swimming pool cleaners evolved from two areas of science: development of the water filter and early cistern cleaners. The forerunner of today's pool cleaners were cistern cleaners. These developed from the need to clean pools and cisterns throughout history. Roman Baths were well-known for their elaborate cisterns, but they were prevalent in early America as well. The United States Patent and Trademark Office refers to a cistern cleaner patent filed (though never issued) as early as 1798. In 1883 John E. Pattison of New Orleans applied a \\"Cistern and Tank Cleaner\\" and the first discovered patent was issued the following year. It swept and scraped the bottom of a cistern or tank and, through a combination of suction and manipulation of the water pressure, was able to separate and remove sediment without removing the water. Over the next 20 years, his invention was improved upon on numerous occasions. Many pool cleaner patents issued in the modern era refer to some of the cistern cleaners as predecessors of their invention. = Early models = An evolution of the previously patented cistern cleaner, the first swimming pool cleaner was invented in 1912 by Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania citizen John M. Davison. On November 26, 1912, he submitted a patent application to the United States Patent and Trademark Office entitled \\"Cleaning Apparatus For Swimming Pools And The Like,\\" patent number 1,056,779, which was issued on March 25, 1913. The first suction-side pool cleaner was invented by Roy B. Everson of Chicago in 1937, which he entitled \\"Swimming Pool Cleaner\\". Nineteen years later, the first suction-side pool cleaner was the work of Joseph Eistrup of San Mateo, California, who called his invention simply \\"Pool Cleaner\\". Two years later, the \\"Automatic Swimming Pool Cleaner\\" was created by Andrew L. Pansini of Greenbrae, California, founder of Jandy Corporation. This was the first truly automatic pool cleaner and as patent Number 3,032,044, was touted by Pansini as \\"effective to remove the scum, dirt and other accumulations from both the bottom and sidewalls of a pool to disperse foreign matter in the water for removal therefrom by a normal pump- filter system of the pool.\\" The first robotic pool cleaner which used electricity was the work of Robert B. Myers of Boca Raton, Florida in 1967, who filed a patent. A third development was the pressure-side cleaner. This was invented by Melvyn Lane Henkin of Tarzana, California in 1972. His \\"Automatic Swimming Pool Cleaner, United States Patent Number 3,822,754\\" used three wheels to allow the machine \\"to travel underwater along a random path on the pool vessel surface for dislodging debris therefrom\\". The design is used as the Polaris Pool Cleaner, a commonly used pool cleaner amongst modern pool owners. Independently from his American counterparts Ferdinand Chauvier, a hydraulics engineer who emigrated to South Africa from the Belgian Congo, introduced the Kreepy Krauly in Springs, South Africa in 1974.  Types  There are three main types of automated or automatic swimming pool cleaners, classified by the drive mechanism and source of power used: a suction side cleaner, a pressure side cleaner, and an electric robotic cleaner. = Suction-side = In this type, water pumped out of the pool via its skimmer or drains is used for locomotion and debris suction, then returned after being filtered via pool return or outlet valves. This is the least expensive and most popular type of cleaner, and traces a random course around the pool. This type of cleaner is usually attached via a 1.5-inch hose to a vacuum plate in the skimmer, or a dedicated extraction or \\"vac\\" line on the side of the pool. The suction action of the pool's pump provides the needed force to the machine for it to randomly traverse the floor and walls of the pool, extracting dirt and debris in its path. The first automatic pool cleaner was a suction cleaner. These are the least expensive and most widely used pool cleaners. The price of suction-side cleaners ranges from $100 to $300. They are powered solely by the main pump of the pool and utilize the pool's filter system to remove dirt and debris from the water. Suction-side cleaners are best suited for screened-in pools or those with light debris such as sand. Large amounts of debris or bigger debris such as leaves and sticks can easily clog the unit itself or the pump basket. These machines effectively diminish the suction of the main pump - using them will increase the electricity costs and require the main pump and filter system to be serviced more frequently. There are minimal maintenance and part replacement costs on these devices over time. = Pressure-side = In this design, pool water inflow is further pressurized using a secondary \\"booster\\" pump on most but not all models. This high- pressure water is used for locomotion and debris suction, employing the venturi effect. It traces a random course. The requirement of a booster pump makes this type the highest in electricity use of the three types of pool cleaners. The pressure causes turbulence in the water, distributing some debris on the floor and walls of the pool, some of which are re-floated to the pool surface and then sucked into the main filter through the skimmer inlets. A portion of the dirt and debris is caught in an attached filter bag. Pressure-side cleaners are better suited for handling a heavy amount of debris. They are also better for large debris such as leaves, acorns, and sticks. The purchase cost of this type of cleaner range from a minimum of $200 to about $700 plus the costs of the booster pump, usually over $200. Some more sophisticated models can cost over $1,000. Both suction-side and pressure-side cleaners are dependent on the pool's main pump and filter system to remove contaminants from the pool water, so cannot remove particles smaller than the pore size of the pool's existing filter element. Such elements can be made of sand, diatomaceous earth, zeolite, or other natural or synthetic materials. That particle size ranges from under 5 ¬µm for diatomaceous filters to 50+ ¬µm for sand filters. Disadvantages of these types of pool cleaners are the additional electricity use, and filtration limitation by the pore size of the main filter element, as well as the time and effort needed to attach the device to the ports that connect to the main pump and filter, and the increased burden of maintenance time and expense on the pool's mechanics. = Electric robotic = These cleaners are independent of the pool's main filter and pump system and are powered by a separate electricity source, usually in the form of a set-down transformer that is kept at least from the pool. They have two internal motors: one to suck in water through a self-contained filter bag and eject the filtered water back into the pool. The second is a drive motor that is connected to tractor-like rubber or synthetic tracks and \\"brushes\\" connected by rubber or plastic bands via a metal shaft. The brushes, resembling paint rollers, are located on the front and back of the machine and help remove contaminant particles from the pool's floor, walls (and in some designs even the pool steps) depending on size and configuration. They also direct the particles into the internal filter bag. An internal microchip is programmed to control the drive motors. The chip will cause the machine to change direction when it reaches a wall or the water surface after climbing the pool walls. These machines may also be directed by sensors located in the bump bars which, on contact with objects such as a wall, cause a reverse in direction, with a small offset allowing it to move one machine's width over on each crossing of the pool. The delay timer is an important feature for many pools, as many switch off several circulation pumps during the night to allow suspended particles to settle on the bottom of the pool; after a couple of hours, the pool cleaner begins its cleaning cycle. This cleaning cycle is set up to complete before the pumps are turned back on. Though not necessary for adequate pool cleaning, this feature saves energy and improves cleaning efficiency. To move forward and backward and negotiate walls and steps, electric robotic cleaners rely on three natural principles, traction and movement caused by the drive motor and tracks, buoyancy created by the large areas inside the machine that fills with air, and the force resulting from the high pressure of water being emitted from the top of the machine that pushes it against the floor and walls. Some electric robotic machines use brushes made out of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Polyvinyl alcohol has an adhesive quality that allows the unit to essentially cling to the walls, steps, and floors. The substance is resistant to dirt and oil, thus improving lifespan over rubber or other synthetic materials. The combination of these three natural principles along with an internal mercury switch that tells the microchip that the unit has gone from a horizontal to a vertical position as it climbs a wall allows it to change direction from ascending to descending the wall at pre-programmed intervals based on the average height of swimming pool walls. Some machines have delayed timers that cause the robot to remain at the waterline, where more dirt accumulates, for momentarily resulting in a scrubbing action, much like the wheels of a powerful automobile spinning or peeling out. The major benefits of these machines are efficient in time, energy, and cleaning ability as well as low maintenance requirements and costs. The major disadvantage is purchase cost which can range from $1,000 to $1,500. The smart navigation system on the product makes it possible to cover the entire area with ease. Limited warranties and specialized internal parts mean repairs can be costly. Therefore, robotic pool cleaners require regular and specific maintenance.  Commercial versions  All commercial pool cleaners are electric robotic and can range in price from a little over $1,000 to upwards of $15,000. They closely resemble residential models but in addition to their addition size, they are made with heavy-duty components and often more sophisticated computer guidance and on and off systems. In the US, commercial pool cleaners need to be certified by the National Spa Pool Foundation (NSPF) as Certified Pool Operators (CPO).  Controlling legislation  There have been attempts for nearly 100 years to mandate the use of pool cleaners, primarily addressed to public pools. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, on a grant provided by the National Swimming Pool Foundation (NSPF), is about to publish the first uniform Model Aquatic Health Code (MAHC). Included is a section on pool filtration proposed regulations directed to the nation's 3200+ state and local agencies that enforce laws and ordinances relating to the operation of swimming pools and spas. = Historical perspective = The proposed MAHC is not the first attempt to propose a uniform aquatic health code. The credit for that goes to the American Public Health Association(APHA) which 100 years ago recognized the dangers of improperly maintained aquatic facilities and formed a committee in 1918 that, for the next 66 years, issued eleven so-called \\"Swimming Pools and Other Public Bathing Places Standards For Design, Construction, Equipment And Operation\\" recommended ordinances and regulations. But for a variety of reasons none of these recommendations were adopted, at least not formally or completely adopted. Uniform Aquatic Health Code The APHA has tried to develop a uniform aquatic health code, or what is referred to for years as referenced above, and published short reports annually from 1920 through 1925 that it simply referred to as \\"Report of the Committee On Bathing Places\\". and finally in 1926 Report of the Joint Committee on Bathing Places of the A.P.H.A. and the Conference of State Sanitary Engineers 1926, Swimming Pools and Other Public Bathing Places Report of the A.P.H.A. and the Conference of State Sanitary Engineers, presented to the Public Health Engineering Section of the American Public Health Association at the Fifty-sixth Annual Meeting at Cincinnati, Oct. 18, 1927, published in its journal its first comprehensive report it called \\"Standards for Design, Construction, Equipment, and Operation\\" for \\"Swimming Pools and Other Public Bathing Places\\". Twelve others were published through 1981. However, its lack of authority to enforce them is implied by the changing description of what was limited to their recommendations or suggestions and the expressed purposes in issuing them. Reports *In 1957, it referred to its report as \\"Recommended Practice for Design, Equipment, and Operation of Swimming Pools and Other Public Bathing Places\\".'Recommended Practice for Design, Equipment, and Operation of Swimming Pools and Other Public Bathing Places' Prepared by the Joint Committee on Bathing Places of the Conference of State Sanitary Engineers and the Engineering and Sanitation Section of the American Public Health Association 1957 *In the most comprehensive one since 1926 and until it stopped issuing them in 1981 it referred in 1964 to its report as \\"Suggested Ordinance and Regulations Covering Public Swimming Pools\\" and in 1970 one for \\"Private Swimming Pools\\". Its last report in 1981 was called \\"Public Swimming Pools: Recommended Regulations for Design and Construction, Operation and Maintenance\\". In 1926 appears the committee believed its standards would be adopted by the empowered jurisdictions, although they were never mentioned in the report. *In 1964 the boldest move of all took place as it presented its recommendations in the form of proposed ordinances and regulations and the Forward concluded: \\"State and local governments who desire to enact this Suggested Ordinance and Regulations Covering Public Swimming Pools a useful resource\\". New York City Meeting, 1912 In 1912, coincidentally the same year when the United States Patent and Trademark Office issued the first patent for a swimming pool cleaner, the Sanitary Engineering Section of the American Public Health Association (APHA) convened in New York City to lay the groundwork for the first recommended pool and spa regulations. As reported in the American Journal of Public Health in April 1912 a meeting was held in Havana the previous December and at the New York meeting among the subjects that the committee was to be studying was \\"Hygiene of swimming pools\\".American Journal of Public Health, Sanitary Engineering Section American Public Health Association, Volume 11, April 1912, Issue 4, Read at the annual meeting of the Association, held in Havana, December 1911 Six years later a committee on swimming pools was appointed at the APHA's annual meeting in Chicago and in 1920 a similar committee was appointed at the meeting in Washington, D.C. In 1921 and periodically over the next seven decades until the work of the APHA on this subject matter went through a series of divisions and consolidations, diverted elsewhere its committees and joint committees with other health- orientated public and quasi-public organizations issued proposed ordinances and regulations in the form of unenforceable recommendations. Despite their intended and published goals, none became law, uniform, much less national.American Journal of Public Health, Sanitary Engineering Section American Public Health Association, Sanitary control of a public swimming pool George W. Simons, Jr., Chief Sanitary Engineer, Florida State Board of Health, Jacksonville, FLA., Read before Sanitary Engineering Section, American Public Health Association, at San Francisco, Cal. September 17, 1920 Report of the committee on bathing places Read before the Sanitary Engineering Section of the American Public Health Association at the Fiftieth Annual Meeting, New York City, November 17, 1921, and adopted by a vote of the Section None of the proposed Standards included more than a passing reference of the need to properly clean a pool. A few, but curiously not all of these recommended ordinances and regulations, related to the use of a vacuum, although the first that included any specificity in 1923 at least required a certain level of clarity. The 1921 report, barely a few pages in length, made this reference to the need to clean the pool. The 1923 report of the American Journal of Public Health, Sanitary Engineering Section American Public Health Association read before the Sanitary Engineering Section of the American Public Health Association at the Fifty-second Annual Meeting at Boston, Massachusetts, October 8, 1923. slightly longer, but still very brief stated: It further stated: Therefore, in 1921 it was recognized that infectious material, namely pathogens collect in the pool and should be removed. It was not until 1926 twelve years after the organization recognized the need to address swimming pool \\"hygiene\\" and eight years after the committee was organized that the first true report was issued and later published in the Journal of the American Public Health Association. Of all of its reports from 1920 through 1981 the first major report by the APHA in 1926, written in narrative form as were the succeeding nine though 1957, the committee included the detailed provisions relating to pool cleaning, vacuuming and vacuums: The 1964 report included the following language: The CDC was founded (in 1946), followed by the Cabinet-level Department of Health, Education and Welfare (in 1953), now the Department of Health, and Human Services and its 11 operating divisions, the National Health Service Corps (in 1977) and along the way a variety of private and non-profit aquatic organizations such as the National Spa and Pool Association (in 1956), now the Association of Pool and Spa Professionals the National Swimming Pool Foundation (in 1965). Presently a variety of states and jurisdictions that have codified the requirement of inclusion of an independent vacuum cleaner including the two states with the highest number and concentration of both residential and public pools: California: 2010 Title 24, Part 2, Vol. 2 California Building Code. Section 3140B, Cleaning Systems: Florida: Florida Department of Health section 64E-9.007 Recirculation and Treatment System Requirements = Call to action = In 2005 the CDC, in response to growing concern and feared epidemic with the pathogen Cryptosporidium, much like the American Public Health Association did in 1912, convened many of the country's foremost medical and scientific experts to study the concern for aquatic health. As a result, in 2007 they began their quest, again much like the APHC, for a uniform aquatic health code. Each health and safety segment has been assigned to a committee to study it and draft a proposed module open for public comment before being adopted and then recommended to the nation's 3200+ state and local health agencies that enact ordinances and regulations for swimming pools and spa and other aquatic facilities, inspect and monitor them and then enforce the regulations. Since the focus of the MAHC was to respond to the threat of Cryptosporidium the Technical Committee of Recirculation Systems and Filtration is a major focus. The University of North Carolina Charlotte Associate Professor James Amburgey is the Chairperson of the Centers For Disease Control, Model Aquatic Health Code Technical Committee on Recirculation Systems and Filtration. Amburgey has conducted many tests to evaluation existing swimming pool filters and his conclusions have been they are extremely ineffective in most cases to help remove Cryptosporidium., James E.

D. Q. Bach. The work is a parody of the classical double concerto but where one instrument, the hardart, uses different devices, such as plucked strings, blown whistles and popped balloons, to produce each note in its range. The name \\"hardart\\" and the name of the concerto is a play on the name of proprietors Horn & Hardart, who pioneered the North American use of the automat. Like the automat, the hardart had small windows in the front where the musician had to insert coins to remove implements needed to strike or otherwise play the devices that produced the notes. The composer Philip Glass, a classmate of Schickele's, helped build the actual instrument; Glass and the others tasked with building the hardart made it a transposing instrument without telling Schickele. Although a parody, the work is a well- written example of a classical concerto and could stand as a serious piece of music with a few changes. The piece is in three movements: * Allegro con brillo * Tema con variazione * Menuetto con panna e zucchero The first movement is in sonata form, though with numerous mishaps. It quotes Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Symphony No. 29. The second is a set of variations which, as Schickele notes, have no relationship to the initial theme. It quotes Piano Concerto No. 21 (Mozart). It concludes with a cadenza that shows off the abilities of the hardart. The third movement, a minuet (\\"with cream and sugar\\"), ends with the bursting of the balloons on the hardart. A portion of the cadenza was sampled by the group Jurassic 5 in the song \\"Monkey Bars\\" on their album Quality Control. The inscription Minor Labor Matris on the hardart is Latin for \\"Less Work for Mother\\", the advertising slogan adopted by Horn & Hardart in 1924. References Category:P. D. Q.

Vales Point is located on the southern shore of the lake, near the township of Mannering Park. It has two steam turbines, with a total generating capacity of 1,320 MW (1,770,000 hp) of electricity. Vales Point was the first major power station in New South Wales to be located near its fuel source (coal). In November 2015, the Government of New South Wales sold Delta Electricity, which at that time owned only the Vales Point Power Station, to Sunset Power International for $1 million. In 2017 it was valued at $730 million, and is expected to make energy entrepreneur and former National Party candidate Trevor St Baker a half billionaire. A station Vales Point was originally equipped with three turbo-alternators of 200 MW supplied by the English Electric (unit nos. 1 to 3) and one of 275 MW supplied by Associated Electrical Industries (unit no. 4), for a total of 875 MW. The first two units were completed in 1963, and the third in 1964. Unit no. 4 was brought into use in 1966. In order to supply coal to the station, three mines were opened; Chain Valley Colliery, Newvale No.1 Colliery and Wyee State Mine. These four units were known as 'A' Station, its capacity of 875 MW being the highest in New South Wales at the time. Vales Point 'A' Station was decommissioned in 1989. The turbines were removed in 1997; the boilers and buildings were demolished between 2011‚Äì14. B station In 1978, two Toshiba 660 MW units were added, becoming \\"B\\" Station. The combined capacity of 2195 MW made Vales Point the largest power station in Australia at the time. The Toshiba 660 MW turbo-alternator became the standard in New South Wales, with similar units later being installed at Eraring, Bayswater and Mount Piper. Vales Point uses salt water from Lake Macquarie for cooling. The coal for Vales Point is delivered by conveyor and a balloon loop connection to the Main Northern railway line between Wyee and Morisset.Vales Point Coal Unloader NSWrail.net The balloon loop opened in March 1980.Signalling & Safeworking Railway Digest December 1980 page 355 Carbon Monitoring for Action estimates this power station emits 9.32 million tonnes of greenhouse gases each year as a result of burning coal.

Loosely based upon the 1874 novel The Mysterious Island (L'√éle myst√©rieuse) by Jules Verne (which was the sequel to two other novels by Verne, 1867's In Search of the Castaways and 1870's Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea), the film was produced by Charles H. Schneer and directed by Cy Endfield.MYSTERIOUS ISLAND Monthly Film Bulletin; London Vol. 29, Iss. 336, (Jan 1, 1962): 82. Shot in Catalonia, Spain, and at Shepperton Studios, Shepperton, England, the film serves as a showcase for Ray Harryhausen's stop motion animation effects. Like several of Harryhausen's classic productions, the musical score was composed by Bernard Herrmann. Another version of the story was produced in 2005. Plot In 1865, during the American Civil War, a massive storm sweeps through Libby Military Prison in Richmond, Virginia. Union soldiers Cyrus Harding, Herbert Brown and Neb, along with Union war correspondent Gideon Spillet plan an escape via a gas balloon tethered next to the compound. After escaping their cell, they take one of the Confederate guards named Pencroft aboard the balloon after he explains that he knows how to pilot the airship. The balloon carries them westwards across the United States, and over the Pacific Ocean. A storm arises, tearing open the balloon and forcing the men to land near the shore of an unknown island. The following morning the men explore the strange island. They discover that the island has lush tropical jungles, harsh plains, and many volcanoes which frequently erupt. When they reach the other side of the island, they encounter a giant crab. After Neb is nearly killed, the castaways are able to push it into a boiling geyser and have crab meat for dinner. Afterwards, the men continue exploring and find a herd of wild goats which they try to catch. Then they find two unconscious English ladies, Lady Mary Fairchild and her niece Elena, who were shipwrecked here by the same storm. Working together, the castaways find cover and protection in a cave which they call \\"Granite House\\", formerly inhabited by a now deceased castaway named Tom Ayrton. A treasure chest later washes ashore, and in it the men find a variety of useful items, including rifles, nautical charts, and books such as Robinson Crusoe. Markings upon one of the rifles found in the chest indicate that it came from the Nautilus, upon which Spillet gives Lady Fairchild (who is unfamiliar with the tale) a brief summation of the Nautilus, its creator Captain Nemo, and its supposed destruction off the coast of Mexico some eight years earlier. Spillet expresses a sense of respect and admiration for Nemo's genius and principles against war, while Harding derides him for being a madman and a murderer, condemning him for the deaths of numerous sailors during his crusade. Making use of the charts, the castaways are able to determine their location and proceed with the construction of a boat on which they can escape the island. While Mary and Elena are one day tending to the goats, Spillet encounters a giant flightless bird (a prehistoric species called a Phorusrhacos) while fishing. Spillet and the women retreat into the goat pen, but the bird simply jumps over the fence and assails them. As it tries to eat Elena, Herbert arrives and attacks the creature, knifing it until he apparently kills it. Later, as they consume the bird, they discover it was actually killed by a bullet none of them had fired. A few weeks later, Herbert and Elena are sunning outside when they notice a rivulet of honey. Atop a rocky bluff, they come across an enormous hive inhabited by giant bees, which attack them. As Herbert and Elena escape from the hive into a large flooded cave, they spot the submarine Nautilus inside. They enter the vessel, but knowing that it belongs to someone else, retreat, swimming out of the cave. Meanwhile, Harding, Spillet, Neb, Mary and Pencroft spot an approaching pirate ship. They try to hide, but are discovered, and a fight with the pirates ensues. The castaways prevail only after an explosion mysteriously sinks the pirate ship with all hands aboard. Once outside, the castaways reunite and meet Captain Nemo, who is living aboard his disabled submarine. Nemo has been watching the castaways and secretly assisting them by sending the chest, shooting the giant bird, and sinking the pirate ship. He invites them to dinner aboard the Nautilus, where he tells them that the giant creatures are results of his genetic experiments to enlarge the world's food resources, thereby eliminating hunger and economic competition which he sees as prime causes for the wars he was striving to end all his life. Due to their fortitude, he has selected them to assist him in his efforts to make his achievements known to the world, especially since the Nautilus is incapacitated beyond repair and the volcano will soon erupt, destroying the island. When time runs out, the castaways discover that Nemo has invented an air-filled raising system which can refloat the pirate ship, the only readily seaworthy vessel on this island. Nemo teaches them to breathe underwater using his special \\"shell\\" air tanks, and they work to raise the ship, despite interference by a giant cephalopod. With the pirate ship raised and seaworthy, the castaways set sail. The volcano erupts and Nemo is killed as the Nautilus is buried, but the rest escape and begin the journey home, vowing to continue Nemo's dream of achieving lasting peace throughout the world.

New York Times 13 Sep 1959: X9. =Screenplay= The novel on which the film is based is a sequel to two other novels by Jules Verne, In Search of the Castaways (1867) and Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea (1870). The first book featured the island, the pirates and a character Tom Ayrton who was marooned on a nearby island. The second book featured Captain Nemo and the Nautilus presumed lost in the maelstrom at the end of that novel. In The Mysterious Island (1874) after the escapees' balloon landed on the island, among many adventures, they encountered Ayrton alive, fought the pirates and discovered that Captain Nemo was their benefactor and the island the base for the Nautilus. =Casting= The film was mostly cast with British actors. Michael Callan was under contract to Columbia at the time.

The mine was a development of the Tellermine 35 with improved resistance to blast. It was followed by the simplified Tellermine 43. The Tellermine consists of a circular pressed steel main body with a large central pressure plate. The pressure plate is smaller than the earlier Tellermine 35, which increases the mine's resistance to blast.

It was a simplified version of the Tellermine 42, which enabled simpler production techniques. Between March 1943 and the end of World War II, over 3.6 million Tellermine 43s were produced by Germany. Copies of the mine were produced by several countries including Denmark (M/47), France (Model 1948) and Yugoslavia (TMM-1). Description The casing of the Tellermine is circular, rising towards the center with a large flat pressure plate. A rectangular metal carrying handle is fitted to the side of the mine. The pressure plate sits over the fuze well which can hold either a T.Mi.Z.42 shear pin fuze or T.Mi.Z.43 ball release fuze. The mine is armed by removing the pressure plate, screwing a fuze into the fuze well, then screwing the pressure plate back on again. At the bottom of the fuze well is a PETN booster charge, surrounded by the doughnut-shaped main charge of TNT explosive. The mine has secondary fuze wells located on the side and base to enable anti-handling devices to be fitted if required. Additionally, the T.Mi.Z.43 fuze features an integral anti-handling device as standard: when the fuze is inserted and the pressure plate screwed down into place, it shears a weak arming pin in the fuze with an audible \\"snap\\".

Since it is impossible to determine which fuze type has been installed, no pressure plate should be removed from a Tellermine. The Tellermine 43 can also be fitted with an optional tilt-rod fuze, which is screwed into the side fuze well. Anti-tank mines with this type of fuze were capable of inflicting much more damage to armored vehicles. This was demonstrated numerous times in the Normandy Campaign. On June 8, 1944, a Sherman tank was accompanying the 2nd Ranger Battalion in an attack on the Maisy battery.

He has also been the subject of Adventures in the Simple Life by Sarah Vowell on the weekly radio show This American Life with Ira Glass. He is the owner of the Turtle Island Preserve in Boone, North Carolina. He is one of the featured personalities on the History channel show Mountain Men. Biography At age 17 Conway left home so that he could live in a tipi in the woods. He has hiked the entire Appalachian Trail and claims to have set the world record of 103 days for crossing the United States on horseback from the Atlantic to the Pacific. However, according to The New York Times and Los Angeles Times of the day, as well as the book Bud & Me, the record for crossing the North American continent on horseback was actually 62 days. This journey was made by Bud and Temple Abernathy, aged 11 and 7, who rode from New York City to San Francisco on an equestrian journey, which started in August 1911. The weekly radio show This American Life reported on Conway's cross-country journey in the episode \\"Adventures in the Simple Life\\", which aired on September 11, 1998. The show uses recordings that were taped on a hand-held recorder by Conway and his party.This American Life, episode 111 A 2003 documentary film on Conway's life, Full Circle: A Life Story of Eustace Conway, was directed by Jack Bibbo. Conway is also one of four featured characters in the 2012 documentary film Reconvergence, which was directed by Edward Tyndall. Conway appeared in Mountain Men, a reality television series on the History channel. The series focused on his daily life of performing his chores and preparing food for the coming winter. Threatened by a lien against his land, Conway fights to maintain ownership. In November 2012, Turtle Island was forced to shut down public access because its traditional buildings violated building codes. In mid-December, 2012 Conway appeared to make progress toward reaching a resolution with the North Carolina Building Code Council. However, immediately following this apparent progress with the code council, Conway was arrested for trespassing on a neighbor's property in a dispute over the property border, continuing the legal challenges to Turtle Island. Conway's problems with the North Carolina Building Code Council quickly gained notice of state officials. The North Carolina General Assemblyhttp://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/lastaction/lastaction.pl?Biennium=2013&SessionNumber;=1 stepped in, proposing an exemption to building-code requirements for primitive structures.http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/gascripts/BillLookUp/BillLookUp.pl?Session=2013&BillID;=H774 Both the state's House and Senate voted unanimously to pass H774.http://www.ncga.state.nc.us/Sessions/2013/Bills/House/PDF/H774v4.pdf The bill was signed into law by Governor Pat McCrory on June 12, 2013. This ordeal was described in the Fox News special War on the Little Guy, hosted by John Stossel. Conway has three siblings: Walton, Judson, and Martha.

The books were published by DAW Books between 1985 and 1991. Angel with the Sword was originally published by Cherryh in 1985 as a free-standing novel. The Merovingen Nights series came into being two years later when Cherryh began editing seven anthologies that were set in the same universe as Angel with the Sword. Angel with the Sword was subsequently republished with the Merovingen Nights branding. The books take place on the planet Merovin in the Alliance-Union universe after AD 3240, and as such, they are definitively science fiction. But the level of technology on the planet is quite backwards for the 33rd century. For example, most personal weaponry is of the knife or sword variety; relatively few firearms are available and in any case nothing more advanced than a revolver. In addition, the planet Merovin is isolated, forsaken by the rest of humanity because of poor interstellar relations with an aggressive alien species, the Sharrh. Because of these limitations on technology, trade, and travel, and because many of the stories feature swordplay and skullduggery, the series is reminiscent of the old sword and planet subgenre of speculative fiction. As such, the term science fantasy might be a more appropriate label for the books than science fiction. List of books Novels * Angel with the Sword (1985), C. J.

Walker, written by Tom Minton, Tim Cahill and Julie McNally, and directed by James T. Walker, Karl Toerge, Charles Visser, and Kyung Won Lim, starring Tweety. The film also features other Looney Tunes characters such as Sylvester (as the main antagonist), Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Yosemite Sam, Lola Bunny (in a cameo as an anchorwoman), and Speedy Gonzales. The animation was made overseas by the South Korean animation company Koko Enterprises. The movie is an updated spoof of Jules Verne's Around the World in Eighty Days. It was the first (and, so far, the only) long form animated film featuring Tweety in the lead role. Many of the key creative people from the 1995-2000 TV series The Sylvester & Tweety Mysteries also worked on Tweety's High-Flying Adventure, which commenced shortly after the series wrapped production in May 1999. Co-producer Tom Minton instigated the project, which was only the second internally produced direct-to-video animated film done at the Warner Bros. Animation division in Sherman Oaks, California. It was adapted into a video game for the Game Boy Color in 2000. The film was released on DVD in September 2007. Plot On 2 October, when Colonel Rimfire, at the Looney Club in London, announces about his beliefs that cats are the most intelligent, musical animals (after his many plans were foiled by Cool Cat), Granny, hoping to raise money for a nearby children's park, makes a wager that her Tweety can fly around the world in 80 days, collecting the pawprints of 80 cats in the process. Sylvester, still hoping to make Tweety his personal snack, is incensed at the thought of some other cat getting the little bird first and vows to follow Tweety around the world and catch the canary himself; unbeknownst to either one, a thief is also present. Tweety sets a course to Paris, but is blown by a strong wind to the Swiss Alps, where he gets trapped, as does Daffy Duck, but Bugs Bunny saves them both. He goes back to Paris, this time successfully and outsmarts Penelope Pussycat, where he causes Pep√© Le Pew to mistake Sylvester for a female skunk. Tweety continues on to Venice, but grows overweight after eating too much bird seed. On a longboat, he faces a lot of cats, but he overpowers them and goes back to normal. While attempting to sleep in Egypt, he is chased into a tomb by Sylvester and several other cats, but escapes . Sylvester disguised himself as a dancing woman in a basket and takes it off as he caught Tweety, but when he sees hieroglyphics, Sylvester thinks he just sees images. A mummy cat army beats Sylvester as Tweety resumes to his escape. In the African jungle, he outsmarts Pete Puma and a lion with help from the Minah Bird. In the Chinese Himalayas, he befriends another canary known as Aoogah (the name coming from her ability to imitate a horn), after rescuing her from a sacrifice using Hugo the Abominable Snowman. They are taken by more winds into Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and Japan and eventually make it onto a boat to the United States. However, Sylvester catches up with them, but Hubie and Bertie cause him to slide into the water. Tweety and Aoogah are able to save him, but end up on a beach in Australia. Sylvester meets Taz and they chase the two canaries, resorting to a motorcycle, but end up in the ocean with Taz holding the sign from Wile E. Coyote. Tweety and Aoogah ride a windsurfer to San Francisco. Sylvester hijacks a tram to chase them, but ends up on Alcatraz, to the fury of Yosemite Sam, who appears as the tram's driver. The two canaries make it safely on a train to Las Vegas, where they escape more cats. Afterwards, they go through more cities across the United States, finishing in New York City. There, they trick Sylvester into getting onto a Concorde alone. The two canaries are caught up in an Atlantic hurricane and briefly washed up on an island, but outsmart more cats and escape back through the hurricane. In a pub in the English countryside, they discover the thief and manage to outsmart him. Sylvester attempts to frame Tweety by passing his license to fly for a stolen passport. He almost succeeds, but the real passport is in his hand, thus getting himself arrested instead to frame Tweety and himself. Tweety and Aoogah believe they are a day late, until they discover that it's the 21st of December because they crossed the international date line. They are able to get back to London, only to find that they managed to get just 79 pawprints. Tweety then realizes he forgot Sylvester so he flies into the prison truck taking him away and is able to get his pawprint, thereby saving the park. Tweety gets happily knighted by the Queen and Sylvester goes to prison.

Since then, it has grown into a network of campuses in and around Metro Manila. SFACS-Calamba was established in 1991, a decade after the Las Pi√±as campus was opened. The campus is currently headed by the Directress-Principal, Mrs. Evelyn O. Oliveros. In 1996, the school inaugurated the Saint Francis of Assisi Building, a four-storey facility that houses classrooms, a cafeteria, computer room, the learning resource center, a speech lab, gymnasium and the offices of the administration and finance. The school will celebrate its 20th Anniversary during Academic Year 2011-2012. =Culture, sports and tradition= Franciscans are known for their performance arts. The school has won awards for song and dance in local competitions and its dance troupe, Tribong Fransiskano was the only school dance group featured in the final season of the Digital LG Challenge. Every year, the school celebrates its Foundation Day on the Feast Day of Saint Francis of Assisi, October 4. It is usually a week-long event highlighted by an evening programme. Other annual celebrations include the Living Rosary, Recognition Day and Faculty Day. Mass is held every first Wednesday of every month of the school year, and a Baccalaureate Mass is celebrated preceding the Recognition and Graduation Ceremonies. In 2002, SFACS-Calamba showed one of its largest productions in terms of participating students and costs based on several Disney animation classics. Students went through weeks of workshops during otherwise vacant hours, and the school renovated parts of the gymnasium, rented and acquired various lighting and audio equipment. This was replicated by another, smaller scale production by the school in 2005 to celebrate the Christmas holiday. The school is involved in outreach programs to help the less fortunate in the school's community. In 2004, the graduating senior students of the school initiated an outreach program to the pre-school students of the Barandal Elementary School. =Organizations= * Student Body Organization - consists of student-elected officials that oversee projects for the school. * Franciscan Young Communicators Organization - official organization for the communication arts.

According to the International Council of Nurses (ICN), an Advanced Practice Nurse is a registered nurse who has acquired the expert knowledge base, complex decision-making skills and clinical competencies for expanded practice, the characteristics of which are shaped by the context and/or country in which s/he is credentialed to practice.\\"Definition and Characteristics of the Role\\". International Council of Nurses (ICN) International Nurse Practitioner/Advanced Practice Nursing Network. International Council of Nurses (ICN). Retrieved 25 November 2015. Clinical Nurse Specialists are registered nurses, who have graduate level nursing preparation at the master's or doctoral level as a CNS. They are clinical experts in evidence-based nursing practice within a specialty area, treating and managing the health concerns of patients and populations. The CNS specialty may be focused on individuals, populations, settings, type of care, type of problem, or diagnostic systems subspecialty. CNSs practice autonomously and integrate knowledge of disease and medical treatments into the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of patients' illnesses. These nurses design, implement, and evaluate both patient‚Äìspecific and population-based programs of care. CNSs provide leadership in the advanced practice of nursing to achieve quality and cost-effective patient outcomes as well as provide leadership of multidisciplinary groups in designing and implementing innovative alternative solutions that address system problems and/or patient care issues. In many jurisdictions, CNSs, as direct care providers, perform comprehensive health assessments, develop differential diagnoses, and may have prescriptive authority. Prescriptive authority allows them to provide pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments and order diagnostic and laboratory tests in addressing and managing specialty health problems of patients and populations. CNSs serve as patient advocates, consultants, and researchers in various settings [American Nurses Association (ANA) Scope and Standards of Practice (2004), p. 15]. United States In the United States a CNS is an advanced practice registered nurse (APRN), with graduate preparation (earned master's or doctorate) from a program that prepares CNSs. The National Association of Clinical Nurse Specialists (NACNS) announced in July 2015 its endorsement of proposals for the Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) as the required degree for CNS entry into practice by 2030. According to the Consensus Model for APRN Regulation (2008), \\"The CNS has a unique APRN role to integrate care across the continuum and through three spheres of influence: patient, nurse, system. The three spheres are overlapping and interrelated but each sphere possesses a distinctive focus. In each of the spheres of influence, the primary goal of the CNS is continuous improvement of patient outcomes and nursing care. Key elements of CNS practice are to create environments through mentoring and (p. 8) system changes that empower nurses to develop caring, evidence-based practices to alleviate patient distress, facilitate ethical decision-making, and respond to diversity. The CNS is responsible and accountable for diagnosis and treatment of health/illness states, disease management, health promotion, and prevention of illness and risk behaviors among individuals, families, groups, and communities.\\" (p. 9). CNSs are clinical experts in a specialized area of nursing practice and in the delivery of evidence-based nursing interventions. A systematic review published in 2011 identified 11 studies from the US (four RCTs and seven observational) that had looked at the possible effect of having CNS as part of the healthcare team. The reviewers found some evidence of reduced length of stay and costs of care for teams which included a CNS.  Overview  CNSs work with other nurses to advance their nursing practices, improve outcomes, and provide clinical expertise to effect system-wide changes to improve programs of care. CNSs work in specialties that are defined by one of the following categories: * Population (e.g. pediatrics, geriatrics, women's health) * Setting (e.g. critical care, emergency department, long-term care) * Disease or medical subspecialty (e.g. diabetes, oncology, palliative) * Type of care (e.g. psychiatric, rehabilitation) * Type of problem (e.g. pain, wounds, palliative) = Spheres of influence = There are three domains of CNS practice, known as the three spheres of influence (Mayo, et al,2017; NACNS 2004): * Patient * Nursing personnel * System (healthcare system) The three spheres are overlapping and interrelated, but each sphere possesses a distinctive focus. In each of the spheres of influence, the primary goal of the CNS is continuous improvement of patient outcomes and nursing care. = Core competencies = Within the three spheres of CNS practice, Sparacino (2005)Sparacino, P. S. A. (2005). The clinical nurse specialist. In A. B. Hamric, J. A. Spross & C. M. Hanson (Eds.), Advanced practice nursing: An integrative approach (3rd ed., pp. 415‚Äì446). St. Louis: Elsevier identified seven core competencies: # Direct clinical practice includes expertise in advanced assessment, implementing nursing care, and evaluating outcomes. # Expert coaching and guidance encompasses modeling clinical expertise while helping nurses integrate new evidence into practice. It also means providing education or teaching skills to patients and family. # Collaboration focuses on multidisciplinary team building. # Consultation involves reviewing alternative approaches and implementing planned change. # Research involves interpreting and using research, evaluating practice, and collaborating in research. # Clinical and professional leadership involves responsibility for innovation and change in the patient care system. # Ethical decision-making involves influence in negotiating moral dilemmas, allocating resources, directing patient care and access to care. Although these core competencies have been described in the literature they are not validated through a review process that is objective and decisive. They are the opinion of some within the profession. A set of core competencies has now been described and validated through a consensus process (2008) that clearly defines the spheres of influence, the synergy model and the competencies as defined by Sparacino (2005). These core competencies are now expected to be used in all educational programs and will be revised in the coming years in order to be maintained as current and reflective of practice. The 2010 Adult-Gerontology Clinical Nurse Specialist Core Competencies revision reflect the work of a national Expert Panel, representing the array of both adult and gerontology clinical nurse specialist education and practice. In collaboration with colleagues from the Hartford Geriatric Nursing Institute at New York University and the National Association of Clinical Nurse Specialists (NACNS), the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) facilitated the process to develop these consensus- based competencies, including the work of the national Expert Panel and the external validation process. Pivotal to the full practice authority of CNSs in the United States as intended by the APRN Consensus Model implementation is the inclusion in the core competencies of the Clinical Nurse Specialists the crucial role of prescribing medications and durable medical equipment. The authoritative 2010 CNS core competencies document states that the clinical nurse specialist prescribes nursing therapeutics, pharmacologic and non- pharmacologic interventions, diagnostic measures, equipment, procedures, and treatments to meet the needs of patients, families and groups, in accordance with professional preparation, institutional privileges, state and federal laws and practice acts.  International perspectives  Historically, in North America, the CNS role developed within the acute care (hospital) setting. Currently, in addition to the traditional acute care setting, CNSs practice in a variety of non-acute care settings. In the Australian health system, however, a clinical nurse specialist refers to a promotional position, rather than a qualification.

It is the only local newspaper that serves the greater Hunter Region and Central Coast region six days a week. It is owned by Australian Community Media. Overview The Herald is the largest local media organisation, and enjoys a long affinity and reader involvement with the region's residents. It is also well read in Sydney (with readership figures showing a 20% increase in Sydney readership on Saturdays) and interstate, and is usually seen as an accurate record of business and local data for those looking to relocate to the region. The paper features the only classifieds section published six days a week across the region. The Herald, along with its sister free weekly The Star employs more than 310 full-time staff, and injects $17 million into the local economy each year. History The Herald had its origins in two early newspapers, The Newcastle Chronicle and Hunter River District News and The Miners Advocate and Northumberland Recorder. Established in 1858, the Chronicle began as a weekly journal carrying mining, shipping, court and some small items of local news. It cost just sixpence. In the years that followed it took on more of the appearance of a newspaper, became a bi-weekly and then tri-weekly, and by 1876 its last edition was priced at two pence. Some of the paper's first articles document the Newcastle Earthquake of 1868, riots, severe storms and the sinking of Cawarra, the worst shipwreck in Newcastle's history that claimed the lives of sixty passengers on the Brisbane-bound passenger ship. It was also during the paper's infant years that the Newcastle rail line was extended to Watt Street (1858), Newcastle became a municipality (1859), the Miners' Federation was formed (1860) and gas lighting was introduced to the city (1875). In 1873 in Nelson St, Plattsburg (now part of Wallsend), The Miners Advocate and Northumberland Recorder was first published. Under the guidance of founder John Miller Sweet, the paper flourished and by 1876 it was a tri-weekly selling for three pence and with a circulation of 4000 copies a week. John Sweet's father-in-law, James Fletcher, believed the region was ready for a bigger newspaper published daily and persuaded his son-in-law to expand. The Advocate moved to Bolton St, Newcastle, and on 3 April 1876, the first copies of The Newcastle Morning Herald and Miners Advocate hit the streets. The first Herald and Advocate masthead was ornate and carried a sketch of a colliery pit-top, including poppet head and chimney. Such ornate mastheads stayed with The Herald for 104 years, the last major change being on 6 October 1980, when a more modern and simpler masthead was introduced, dropping the \\"Morning\\" and \\"Miners Advocate\\" from the title. As with the Chronicle the first years of The Newcastle Morning Herald and Miners Advocate were to be also marred by tragedy. Some of the first stories printed by the newly named paper included the sinking of Yarra Yarra off Newcastle with no survivors, a fire in Scott Street, deaths at the Greta coal mine, coal strikes and the beginning of the Boer War. Among other stories of local importance were the sinking of the Newcastle-Stockton ferry Bluebell (The Bluebell Collision) in 1934, The Newcastle Tragedy of 1927 and the Japanese attack on the city's East End and dockyards in 1942. = Move to tabloid = In July 1998, the newspaper rebranded itself as \\"the compact with impact\\" after going tabloid in size. According to the newspaper's proponents the move to tabloid was an immediate success, and the newspaper's circulation has grown more than 21 per cent since then. Others have argued that the paper's journalism values suffered and that the paper had become more sensationalist and less analytical as a result. (transcript of radio broadcast) As The Newcastle Herald was one of the first Australian newspapers to switch from broadsheet to tabloid, the paper is often cited as an example when other Australian newspapers are contemplating or alleged to be contemplating a similar move. = Merger = In mid-2008, the paper was forced to sell its free weekly Post publication to Newcastle Jets owner Con Constantine following the merger between Fairfax Media and Rural Press. Rural Press owned the competing Star newspaper and the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission ruled that the conglomerate was not allowed to own two such similar publications. The Star is still in print today. Awards Two Herald writers have won the Gold Walkley, the most prestigious of the Walkley Awards for Australian journalism.

His appointment was made to please the aristocracy which, under Matthew Bonnellus, had murdered Maio. Sylvester, though distantly related to King William I, was possibly a conspirator with Bonnellus. His fellow triumvirs were Henry Aristippus and the Bishop Palmer. When in 1162 William was besieging Salerno, Sylvester and Palmer interceded on behalf of the Salernitan notary Matthew of Ajello to prevent a sack. It was his last important act. He died later that year and was replaced by the ca√Ød Peter. He left a daughter named Matilda who is buried in San Cataldo, the foundation of Maio which Sylvester had secured for himself.
