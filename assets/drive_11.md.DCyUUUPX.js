It was once a flourishing ancient trade city known as Kodumanam, as inscribed in Patittrupathu of Sangam Literature. The place is an important archaeological site, under the control of State Archaeological Department of Tamil Nadu. It is located on the northern banks of Noyyal River, a tributary of the Cauvery. The ancient city The inhabitants of this destroyed ancient city of Chera dynasty were highly skilled craftsmen, who were specialized in making beads and high-quality iron. The place is referred to in Sangam literature as an important industrial centre that had links with the Chola port city of Kaveripoompattinam, now called Poompuhar. Roman trade route The city played a major role in Indo-Roman trade and relations, as the ancient city is located on the mid-way of a Roman trade route, linking Muziris port on the Malabar Coast with the Kaveripoompattinam (Puhar) Port in the Coromandel Coast. The Hindu - Mar 2011 Megalithic tombs Excavations have been carried out and it came out with the layers of a megalithic-cum-early tombs of historic period. Also there were two female and one male human skeleton were recovered from a pit burial in this site. A set of 300 megalithic tombs of different types and sizes were observed and recorded in this area. The ancient city has been destroyed in time and now the area is available with the remains of a megalithic settlement dating back to the 2nd century BC. Apparently, this was the centre for the Romans who visited to obtain beryls from Kodumanal. The megalithic communities that flourished in this site belong to the period of 2nd century BC to 2nd century AD. Iron and metal The iron and steel furnaces and iron artefacts produced in these places revealed the technical advancement made by the iron smelters around 500 BC. The excavated sword bit contained spheroidal graphite phase and forge welding of high-carbon cutting edge. Indian Journal of History & Science,34(4),1999 (through \\"Digital Library of India\\") This place was once celebrated for its trade in precious stones like garnet, carnelian, lapis lazuli, sapphire and quartz. The people of this city were experts in manufacturing the finest iron. Collections Excavations uncovered ancient iron objects such as arrow heads and swords. They also produced Roman artefacts, iron melting furnaces, beads, shell bangles and pottery with the Tamizhi scripts (from the habitation deposits and burials). Other artifacts uncovered during the excavation of this site include roulette pottery, Roman silver coins, and gold and silver spirals. A bronze statue of a lion and the iron melting furnaces were important to deciphering the site's history.http://www.flonnet.com/stories/20120810291506200.htm References External links https://books.google.com/books?id=H3lUIIYxWkEC&pg;=PA402&lpg;=PA402&dq;=kodumanal+called+as&source;=bl&ots;=xcdC8QeVjA&sig;=AUsc9aTBsG5d-EzNqgRm2esbDoc&hl;=en&ei;=a5xbTZ39N4a4vgP4jOnfDA&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=2&ved;=0CBgQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&q;&f;=false * https://books.google.com/books?id=zzZBdGQN_TIC&pg;=PA122&lpg;=PA122&dq;=kodumanal+called+as&source;=bl&ots;=eY2rXArdfM&sig;=FawJfjzSIwiYR3UGbwr1Xx6PZa4&hl;=en&ei;=a5xbTZ39N4a4vgP4jOnfDA&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=3&ved;=0CBsQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q;=kodumanal%20called%20as&f;=false * http://kodumanal.blogspot.com/2008/07/genesis-of-ukku-insights-from.html * http://kodumanal.blogspot.com/2008/07/anchor.html * https://web.archive.org/web/20060321084351/http://www.thebeadsite.com/UNI- MAPS.html * http://www.krepublishers.com/02-Journals/T-Anth/Anth-06-0-000-000-2004-Web/Anth-06-2-091-157-2004-Abst- PDF/Anth-06-2-105-112-2004-Reddy-V-R/Anth-06-2-105-112-2004-Reddy-V-R.pdf * https://web.archive.org/web/20110721154746/http://www.new.dli.ernet.in/rawdataupload/upload/insa/INSA_1/2000c951-385.pdf * http://www.thehindu.com/arts/history-and-culture/article3465932.ece Villages in Erode district History of Tamil Nadu Tamil history Ancient Indian cities Former populated places in India Archaeological sites in Tamil Nadu Sangam period ","title":"Kodumanal"},{"id":"30889963","text":"Distichophytum is a genus of extinct vascular plants of the Late Silurian (Ludfordian) to Early Devonian (Emsian), around . The genus has a tangled taxonomic history, also being known as Bucheria and Rebuchia (see below). Description Stylized reconstruction of the habit of Distichophytum ovatum. Based on the information in , but not the figure, which is more 'realistic'. The genus was first discovered as fossils of Early Devonian age (Pragian or Siegenian to Emsian, ), consisting of isolated spikes of sporangia (spore- forming organs) found at Beartooth Butte, Wyoming, United States of America. Specimens of D. ovata with sporangia attached to stems were later found at the same location. The base of the plant remains unknown; the known part was about 8.5 cm high. The sporophyte consisted of narrow leafless stems (axes) 1.5 to 2.0 mm in diameter, which branched dichotomously. Stems which did not bear sporangia ended in blunt points; fertile branches bore compact one-sided spikes of up to 20 laterally attached sporangia, more-or-less opposite. The sporangia were kidney-shaped (reniform) and had short stalks around 1.5 mm long which curved so that all the sporangia were on one side of the stem. The sporangia split (dehisced) distally into two equal parts in order to release the unornamented spores., p. 258 Specimens from the Pragian flora of Bathurst Island, Nunavut, Canada, were later also assigned to this species, although their sporangia were smaller. A second possible species, D. mucronatum, has narrower, less branched stems and smaller, somewhat differently shaped sporangia than D. ovata. Hueber considered the differences in sporangial shape were caused by compression and that the other differences were too small to warrant a different species; Schweitzer put the two in the same genus but as different species., cited in A third possible species was discovered in sediments from Bathurst Island, Nunavut, Canada, from the Late Silurian (Ludfordian, ); it was not assigned a species name as poor preservation obscured the sporangial shape. Taxonomy The genus has a somewhat tangled taxonomic history which has been clarified by Kotyk et al. The genus Bucheria Dorf was created in 1933 for what is now D. ovata., cited in Independently, Distichophytum M√§gdefrau was created in 1938 for D. mucronatum. Later, Bucheria Dorf was discovered to be homonym of Bucheria Heynhold of 1846, and the alternative Rebuchia (an anagram of Bucheria) was suggested provisionally by H√∏eg in 1967, but only as a form genus for poorly preserved spikes., cited in Rebuchia was formally established by Hueber in 1970 as a replacement for the invalid Bucheria Dorf. However, Hueber regarded Bucheria ovata Dorf and Distichophytum mucronatum M√§gdefrau as the same species; in which case the name Distichophytum had priority over his Rebuchia and should have been used as the genus name. Phylogeny On the basis of the shape of the sporangia (reniform), their lateral position on the stem, borne on short stalks, and their mode of dehiscence, Hueber placed the genus in the Zosterophyllophytina. A cladogram published in 2004 by Crane et al. agrees in placing Distichophytum (as Rebuchia in the original) in a paraphyletic stem group of broadly defined \\"zosterophylls\\", basal to the lycopsids (living and extinct clubmosses and relatives).

He was a prominent leader in Iraqi Kurdistan and his political party was the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan. Early life and childhood He was born in 1936 in the village of Goptapa in Kurdistan. The family is originally from the village of Sargalo, but Ali Askari's great-grandfather moved to Askar in order to settle down in this village. In early 1916 Ali Askari's father, Abdullah Askari, went on to build a village close to Askar which today is called Goptapa. His father was the head of the Qala Saywka tribe, one of the most famous and largest tribes in Iraqi Kurdistan. Ali Askari was the youngest among seven brothers and three sisters. Since there was nowhere to get an education in Goptapa, he had to move to Askar in order to start his studies, at the age of seven. He studied in Askar until he was in the third grade, then moved to the village of Aghjalar to continue his studies in the fourth and fifth grade for his last year in middle school. At the same time, he moved to Kirkuk to his uncle Sheik Raza, who was leading the Naqshbandi branch. Family history The family had started out as a Naqshbandi believers but created a new branch called the Haqqa movement, which was started by Ali Askari's uncle, Sheikh Abdul Kerim in the village of Shadala in the early 1900s. The Haqqa movement was a sect of the poor and oppressed and the movement grew rapidly by spreading to over 300 villages in northern Iraq in just under a few years. The religious movement could be joined by anyone including the wealthy and several powerful tribal leaders had done so from the Kurdish region of Iraq. During the Iraq occupation, the British were opposed to the Haqqa movement due to its growing power, its nonconformity, and the refusal of its followers to pay taxes. This led to the capture the branch's leaders twice. The first time they captured Sheikh Abdul Kerim in 1934 in Kirkuk. Haqqa's contingent managed to release Sheikh Abdul Kerim from Kirkuk with the help of 20,000 of its followers by peacefully marching on the city and demanding his release. Ali Askari's other uncle Raza who took over the Haqqa movement following the death of his older brother, Sheikh Abdul Kerim, was also captured in the 1940s by the Iraqi Government under the pressure of the British but again the Haqqa branch succeeded in releasing another of their leaders with help by some 30,000 to 35,000 followers. Political career At the age of seventeen, Ali Askari became a member of the Kurdish Democratic Party, also known as the KDP. After finishing high school, Ali Askari applied for military college, as well as a civil-engineering college, but the KDP asked him to move to Mosul and become the KDP's representative, so he never went to college. Ali Askari was appointed and voted member of the KDP's central committee at the parties first official meeting. The Kurdish revolution started on 11 September 1961 and Ali Askari was asked to command the liberation of Zaxo, Duhok and the rest of the Bahdinan region. He was the youngest member of the KDP's leading staff. Ali Askari was much liked amongst Kurds for his perpetual optimism, great energy, courage and military ability Military career In the 1960s, Ali Askari led dozens of battles and had control of many different Peshmerga groups. During the 1961 revolution against the Iraqi Government, Ali Askari became head of the Khabat force, one of the five major military forces of the KDP in Kurdistan at the time. The other major KDP forces were led by Ibrahim Ahmad who was head of the Malouma force, Jalal Talabani headed the Rizgari forces, and Omar Mustafa and Kamal Mufti commanded the Kawa and Qaradagh forces. Following the 1975 Algiers Agreement between Iran and Iraq, all support of the Kurdish revolution halted and the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, decided to give up supply to the Kurds in Iraq based on the Algiers accord agreed with then Iraqi Vice-President, Saddam Hussein. This lead Mustafa Barzani and the Kurdistan Democratic Party (The only Kurdish party in Iraqi Kurdistan at the time) to give up the armed struggle against Baghdad and to go into exile in Iran. In 1975, Ali Askari asked Mustafa Barzani to continue the fighting against the Iraqi regime and stand up for the rights of the Kurds, however Mustafa Barzani disagreed stating that no one should continue the revolution, leaving many of the Kurdish leadership divided over the future of the Kurdish liberation movement in Iraq. After the division of the Kurdish Leadership, many of the left-wing KDP cadres decided to split and restart the revolution separately and continue the Kurdish movement in Iraqi Kurdistan. Ali Askari, Omar Dababa, Rasul Mamand, and Dr Khalid Sa'id decided to form the Kurdistan Socialist Movement (KSM). Ali Askari then decided to lead his party to create a union of newly created parties, which would be called the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan, also known as the PUK, that would start a new revolution against Saddam Hussein and his regime. on June 1, 1975 The PUK was formed as an Umbrella of two organizations. This was set up of the Marxist‚ÄìLeninist group, Komala, led by Nawshirwan Mustafa and the Kurdistan Socialist Movement (KSM) led by Ali Askari. During the first congress of the PUK, he was appointed as Politburo of the party and commander of all of its Peshmerga forces. The PUK commanded over 3,000 to 3,500 Peshmerga in the period of 1975‚Äì1978, all under the command of Ali Askari which started the PUK insurgency against the Ba'ath regime following the defeat of the KDP revolution in 1975. This insurgency is referred to as the \\"New Revolution\\" in Iraqi Kurdistan led by the PUK. The Insurgency was stopped briefly when Ali Askari met with Saddam Hussein on 23 November 1977 in Baghdad in order to negotiate the application of the statute of autonomy for Kurdistan, legalisation of the parties in Kurdistan, and the situation of Kurdish villages being destroyed. All three points were rejected by Saddam Hussein, which led to the resumption of the PUK's operations upon Ali Askari's return to Kurdistan. After the fall of the First Kurdish‚ÄìIraqi War and the 'Aylul' revolution led by Mustafa Barzani, there were many disagreements between the Kurdish leadership over continuing the fight against the Ba'ath regime. Ali Askari asked Mustafa Barzani to continue the fight, however Mustafa Barzani believed in withdrawal and suspension of Kurdish rebellion, after KDP supply-lines were completely severed as part of 1975 Algiers Agreement between Iraq and Iran. After Algiers Agreement, KDP withdrew and based itself in Iran and Turkey, while Kurdish areas in Iraq fell under Iraqi Army followed by widespread arabization. Meanwhile, Jalal Talabani formed PUK from his exile in Syria, in protest against perceived \\"inability of the feudalist, tribalist, bourgeois, rightist and capitulationist Kurdish [KDP] leadership\\". From Syria, Jalal Talabani instructed followers to get rid of KDP. KDP leadership under Sami Abd al-Rahman and Idris Barzani, still recuperating from the massive sudden down-turn and in no mood to deal softly with internal enemies, were aware of these general instructions from Talabani and preemptively ambushed and killed dozens of PUK fighters on 3 occasions while PUK were also accused of killing numerous high-ranking Barzanis. Jalal Talabani was now even more insistent on eliminating KDP forces, while Ali Askari who had limited but direct contact with KDP, was urging him that Saddam Hussein was the only enemy and Kurdish infighting must be abandoned. Death In June 1978, Ali Askari, Dr. Khalid Sa'id, and Sheikh Hussein Yezidi were sent on a mission to pick up arms from Kurdish villages located inside the Turkish border in order to support the new Kurdish revolution in Iraq. With them, written instructions from Talabani that they were to wipe out KDP bases in Turkey. Ali Askari was intent on ignoring instructions to attack KDP as he had already established respectable relations with KDP in Baradust area. However, a copy of Talabani's letter found its way to Sami Abd al-Rahman, via Kurdish tribes in Turkey. Armed with solid evidence of Talabani's intentions to attack KDP forces, but unaware of Askari's intent on ignoring these orders, KDP under Sami planned an ambush of their own. As claimed by the KDP and their supporters, the PUK claim it was over the fact the KDP was opposed to a revival of armed conflict after its suppression in 1975 in addition to the political split that had already existed in the PDK which lead to the formation of the PUK, and the KDP were supported by both Iraq and Turkey in their attack according to most sources. Ali Askari and his force of 800 Peshmerga were attacked en route to the Turkish border town of Hakk√¢ri by Iraqi and Iranian Airstrikes and ground forces. By the time they arrived in Baradust with low ammunition, Askari made routine contact with KDP and predicted no hostilities. But later upon entering Turkey, Askari and his 800 Peshmerga were ambushed by KDP who were expecting them based on the information given by Kurdish tribes in Turkey, with whom KDP had stronger relations than PUK did. Askari's men split into different groups, some fought their way southwards, some returned to Iran, while others surrendered to Iraqi forces and Askari himself along with remaining PUK forces surrendered to KDP after heavy losses. Dr. Khalid Said and his men who split up from Askari before the ambush were also forced to surrender. Ali Askari and Dr. Khalid Said were executed on orders from Sami Abd al-Rahman. The killing of Ali Askari was already damaging for internal Kurdish affairs however the manner of his execution, by an RPG-7, made the matter even harder to over-come, which was ordered by Mustafa Barzani himself. The event is sometimes referred to among Kurds as \\"The Hakkari Massacre\\".The impact of the event has embittered internal Kurdish affairs, while it has helped foreign powers gain more success in dividing the Kurds politically.

Located above the medieval Kingsgate, one of the principal entrances to the city, the church is unusual in forming a part of the fabric of the old city walls. St Swithun's first appears in 13th century records, and under the fictional name of St Cuthbert's, is mentioned in Anthony Trollope's novel The Warden. History =Medieval origins= The first mention of the church is recorded in 1264, when it was apparently burned by the citizens of Winchester during a dispute with the Priory.Official St Swithun's Church Leaflet Most likely the church served as a chapel for lay people who worked for the Abbey.Official St Swithun's Walk Around Guide In 1337 some woodwork was done on the church, costing a total of fifteen shillings, and in 1484 the windows underwent repair. St Swithun was an Anglo Saxon saint, born in Winchester and in 852 becoming the 19th bishop of the city. He died in 862 when King Alfred the Great was still a young man. It is possible that St Swithun was tutor to the young king, and accompanied him on a pilgrimage to Rome. According to legend, St Swithun has a special association with the English weather, a legend which dates from July 971 when the bones of the saint were moved from outside the old Saxon cathedral and brought inside the building, apparently causing a great thunderstorm: :\\"On St Swithun's Day, if then dost rain, :For forty days it will remain: :St Swithun's Day, if then be fair, :For forty days 'twill rain nae mair.\\" St Swithun's Day is celebrated on 15 July. =Reformation= In 1538 the Shrine of St Swithun in Winchester Cathedral was destroyed, and in 1539 the monastery was dissolved. St Swithun upon Kingsgate became a parish church. The East wall niche, which today lies empty, most likely once held a statue of St Swithun, which was probably destroyed at this time. By the 17th century the church had fallen into disrepair, and had become home to one Robert Allen, the porter of Kings Gate, and his wife, \\"who did and doth keep swine at ye ende of the Chapell\\". The situation was improved around 1660 when the church was restored, its bells re-hung in 1677. It has remained a place of worship since that time. =19th century and literary fame= St Swithun's appears in Anthony Trollope's novel The Warden, in which Warden Harding is appointed Rector of St Cuthbert's (a thinly disguised St Swithun's), after he has resigned from Hiram's hospital (most likely based upon the Hospital of St Cross). Writing in the 1850s, Trollope describes the church, in Chapter 21, as follows: :\\"The church is a singular little Gothic building, perched over a gateway, through which the Close is entered, and is approached by a flight of stone steps which leads down under the archway of the gate. It is no bigger than an ordinary room - perhaps twenty seven feet long by eighteen wide - but still a perfect church\\".Church leaflet St Swithun's differs slightly from this description; the stairway is of wood, and is positioned to the right of the King's Gate in St Swithun Street, and not in the nearby gateway to the Close, (usually known as the Prior's Gate). Modern era Today the King's Gate is maintained by the City of Winchester, while the duty of maintaining the church falls upon the parish of St Lawrence with St Swithun-upon-Kingsgate.Church leaflet\\" The east window has some fragments of medieval stained glass, most likely depicting the Annunciation, which were brought in 1961 from St Peter's Church, Chesil.\\"Walk Around Guide\\" Entry to the church is via a narrow staircase, dating from the 1500s, accessible from St Swithun Street next to the right-hand arch of the three arches of the King's Gate. In retirement, the late Lord Coggan, formerly the Archbishop of Canterbury, regularly attended the Church where he sometimes accompanied services, playing the piano, surely the only Archbishop ever to have done so. His funeral took place at St Swithun's on 26 May 2000, and he is commemorated there by his initials carved on a bench-end.

Carter attempted a career as a solo artist in 2002, when he released Now or Never. The album reached number 17 on the Billboard 200 and was certified gold, both in the United States and Canada. The lead single, \\"Help Me\\" achieved considerable worldwide success while the other single, \\"I Got You\\", was a minor hit in Europe. Carter began work on his second solo album in 2003, but the recordings were aborted when the Backstreet Boys returned to the studio. One of the tracks from the earlier recording sessions was used as the theme song to the television series House of Carters in 2006. \\"Let It Go\\" was written by Nick Carter, Matthew Gerrard, and Bridget Louise Benenate. Carter recorded a duet with pop singer Jennifer Paige called \\"Beautiful Lie\\" in 2009. In 2010, Nick Carter started recording new songs for his second solo album, working with Rami, Carl Falk, Toby Gad, Josh Hoge, Claude Kelly, and many others.

It is a collection of three previously unpublished public lectures given by Feynman in 1963. The book was first published in hardcover in 1998, ten years after Feynman's death, by Addison‚ÄìWesley. Several paperback and audiobook editions of the book have subsequently been published. The Meaning of It All is non-technical book in which Feynman investigates the relationship between science and society. Background The Meaning of It All contains three public lectures Richard Feynman gave on the theme \\"A Scientist Looks at Society\\" during the John Danz Lecture Series at the University of Washington, Seattle in April 1963. At the time Feynman was already a highly respected physicist who played a big role in laying the groundwork for modern particle physics. Two years later in 1965, Feynman won the Nobel Prize in Physics with Julian Schwinger and Sin-Itiro Tomonaga for their work in quantum electrodynamics. The three lectures were not published at the time, because, despite requests by the University of Washington Press, Feynman did not want them to be printed. The Meaning of It All was published posthumously by Addison‚ÄìWesley in 1998, with the lectures having been transcribed \\"verbatim\\" from audio recordings. Apart from numerous scientific papers, Feynman also published The Feynman Lectures on Physics in 1964, which was based on lectures he had given to undergraduate students between 1961 and 1963. Towards the end of his life, he edited two autobiographical books, Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman! and What Do You Care What Other People Think?, published in 1985 and 1988 respectively. Synopsis In the first lecture, \\"The Uncertainty of Science\\" Feynman explains the nature of science, that it is a \\"method for finding things out\\", and that it is \\"based on the principle that observation is the judge of whether something is so or not\\". He says that uncertainty and doubt in science is a good thing, because it always keeps the door open for further investigation. The lecture is structured around three topics: the activity of \\"doing\\" science, the body of scientific knowledge, and the application of science, which Feynman covers in reverse order. Feynman also emphasizes the distinction between questions that science can answer: \\"what will happen\\", and questions science cannot answer: \\"what do I want to happen\\". The second lecture, \\"The Uncertainty of Values\\" deals with his views on the relationship between science, religion and politics. Feynman acknowledges science's limitations and says that it does not have the value system that religions have, but adds that it can be used to help in making decisions. He also stresses the importance of having the freedom to question and explore, and criticizes the (then) Soviet Union by saying that no government has the right to decide which scientific principles are correct and which are not. In the third lecture, \\"This Unscientific Age\\", the longest of the three, Feynman discusses his views on modern society and how unscientific it is. Using a number of anecdotes as examples, he covers a range of topics, including \\"faith healing, flying saucers, politics, psychic phenomena, TV commercials, and desert real estate\\". Reception The Meaning of It All was generally well received by reviewers, although some said that the lectures did not translate into print very well and complained about the awkward sentence constructions in places resulting from the transcription from the audio recordings. In The Guardian Nicholas Lezard wrote that The Meaning of It All has almost no science in it, and that Feynman, two years before winning the Nobel Prize in Physics, gave these lectures to a non-specialist audience and spoke of \\"the principles of scientific methodology as if he was making a good wedding speech\\". Bruce Tierney said on the Book Page that it gives readers \\"the opportunity to take a fresh glimpse into the inner workings of one of the finest minds of our age\\", adding that Feynman \\"expounds on [...] issues with his characteristic energy and intellectual vigor\\". Nick Meyer wrote in the New York magazine that Feynman departs from his field of theoretical physics and \\"waxes philosophical\\" on \\"the strengths and limitations of scientific thought\\", using topics like \\"poverty, religion, and flying saucers\\" to illustrate his arguments. Meyer said that Feynman \\"sounds like himself, which is a high compliment.\\" Chris Quigg, a theoretical physicist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, said that The Meaning of It All is an opportunity to \\"ponder and debate [Feynman's] ideas\\". Quigg said it is also an \\"unspoken challenge\\" to other scientists to consider the \\"cultural and spiritual value of science\\". Timothy Ferris writing in The New York Times was generally impressed with the first two lectures, but felt that Feynman's \\"ad- lib approach\\" faltered in the third. At the beginning of this last lecture Feynman said, \\"I have completely run out of organized ideas\\", and Ferris felt that this showed in the somewhat \\"ragged\\" speech that followed. Eli Kintish in The Yale Review of Books complained that while the lectures \\"burn with the fuel of Feynman's enthusiasm\\", they are difficult to follow in places because of their lack of focus. Kintish said that with some editing it would have been \\"a more accessible read\\", but added that the book was still full of \\"original gems\\". David Goodstein, a physicist who attended the lectures in 1963, wrote in American Scientist that while the book has \\"some nuggets of pure Feynman gold\\", it is \\"badly dated and atrociously edited\\". Goodstein complained that the publishers had ignored Feynman's request not to print the lectures, and said that the book \\"does not honor his memory\\".

Sanders had a quick rise in Queensland football, becoming a regular interstate player after his first representative match in 1946. Although mainly a backman, Sanders was often used with success as a forward. He was club captain of Queensland Australian National Football League (QANFL) club Yeronga and then of Coorparoo-Yeronga, a merged outfit which competed in the 1953 and 1954 seasons. He won The Courier-Mail Best and Fairest Cup in 1954.The Courier-Mail, \\"Code award to Sanders\\", 7 September 1954. p. 12The Sunday Mail, \\"The Sunday Mail Names Aces of Queensland Winter Sports\\", 12 September 1954. p. 33 He started his cricket career as a wicket- keeper and had been a promising junior cricketer, captaining the Queensland Colts in 1949 and 1950. With Queenslander Don Tallon keeping wicket for Australia and future Test player Wally Grout the new state gloveman, Sanders was at best the third choice wicket-keeper for Queensland. As a result, he gave up the glovework and tried to get state selection as a specialist batsman. It was as an opening batsman that Sanders was most often used by Queensland. He made his first-class cricket debut in the 1950/51 Shield season and was never able to become a regular fixture in the side, instead he was used more as a reserve batsman for Queensland, who filled a spot when a player was injured. His best effort with the bat came in the 1951/52 season, against Victoria, when he opened the batting and made 49. He missed out on his half century when he edged a ball from John Cordner to the keeper. After an absence of two years, Sanders played his 10th and final first-class match when he was called up as a middle order batsman for a Shield fixture against New South Wales. He suffered the indignity of scoring a pair and his dismissal in the second innings put debutant spinner Jack Treanor on a hat-trick, which he completed with the wicket of Peter Burge.

The first church on this site was built in 610. The present building on the site dates from 1873, and was designed by the rector at the time. It reuses earlier material including a decorated 15th-century doorway and a 17th-century bell. The church is still used for worship by the Church in Wales, and is one of seven churches in a combined parish. It is a Grade II listed building, a national designation given to \\"buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them\\", in particular because it is regarded as \\"a simple late 19th-century essay in Gothic revival\\". History and location St Dona's Church is on a steep hill near the coast on the eastern side of Anglesey, about from the village of Llanddona itself. The village takes its name from its parish church: the Welsh word originally meant \\"enclosure\\" and then \\"church\\", and \\"‚Äìddona\\" is a modified form of the saint's name. St Dona's is surrounded by a churchyard, entered through a lychgate dated 1906 which bears a memorial to Henry Stanley, 3rd Baron Stanley of Alderley, \\"Patron and Benefactor of this church\\". According to the 19th-century Anglesey historian Angharad Llwyd, a church was built here in 610, dedicated to St Dona, who lived on the sea shore nearby. The presence of a church here was recorded in the Norwich Taxation of 1254. Repairs were carried out in the 1840s: one 19th- century writer, Samuel Lewis, recorded that the internal state of St Dona's was \\"wretched in the extreme\\" until the rural dean at the time put it \\"into a state of creditable repair\\". In 1873, the rector (Peter Jones) had the church entirely rebuilt to his own design. St Dona's is still in use for worship and belongs to the Church in Wales. It is one of seven churches in the combined benefice of Beaumaris with Llanddona and Llaniestyn. It is within the deanery of Tindaethwy and Menai, the archdeaconry of Bangor and the Diocese of Bangor. As of 2012, the rector is the Reverend Neil Fairlamb. Architecture and fittings St Dona's is built of rubble masonry, dressed with freestone. The roof is made from slate, and has a bellcote made from stone at the west end. There is a stone cross finial at the east end of the roof. The church is entered through a porch on the south side which leads to a doorway dating from the 15th century. The rounded doorway is decorated with figures of a bird, a dog and a human face on the left, and a cherub on the right. Inside, the nave is separated from the chancel by a step, and the sanctuary is itself raised one step above the chancel. The roof timbers can be seen from inside. The window at the east end has three lights (vertical sections separated by mullions) topped with ogee curves, and is set within a pointed arch with an external hoodmould. It contains stained glass added in 1963, depicting Christ with sea in the background (centre), St Curig (left) and St Dona (right); above them are images of a lion, dove, lamb and eagle. A stone bearing the date 1566 has been set upside down into the wall above the east window. The other windows are plain and smaller, with one or two lights. The glass in the other windows has been described as \\"unusual opaque leaded glass\\". The fittings are from the late 19th century, although the octagonal font (made of gritstone) is of uncertain date, possibly 14th century. The bell is dated 1647. A survey in 1937 by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire recorded the presence of an 18th-century communion table, an Elizabethan cover-paten dated 1574, and a silver cup dated 1769‚Äì1772. Churchyard The churchyard contains two Commonwealth war graves, of a Royal Welsh Fusiliers soldier of World War I and a RNVR officer of World War II. CWGC Cemetery report. Assessment St Dona's has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II listed building ‚Äì the lowest of the three grades of listing, designating \\"buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them\\". It was given this status on 30 January 1968, and has been listed because it is \\"a simple late 19th-century essay in Gothic revival\\". Cadw (the Welsh Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists) also notes that \\"its simple character\\" is \\"appropriate to its scale and site\\". A 2009 guide to the buildings of the region described St Dona's as \\"drably rebuilt\\".

He played 10 seasons in the South East Australian Basketball League (SEABL) and spent two seasons in the National Basketball League (NBL). At 221 cm, he is the tallest player ever to play in the NBL. Early life Harris was born in Launceston, Tasmania, and grew up in the suburb of Newnham. He started playing basketball in the late 1990s and attended Launceston College. In 2001, Harris moved to Canberra to attend the Australian Institute of Sport (AIS) and play for the program's SEABL team. With Lake Ginninderra College at the 2001 National Schools Basketball Tournament in Ballarat, the 17-year-old Harris stood at 219 cm‚Äî4 cm taller than the previous student record. He continued on with the AIS in 2002, 2003 and 2004, playing in the SEABL each year. College career Between 2004 and 2008, Harris played college basketball for Old Dominion University in the United States. As a freshman, on 27 November 2004, he scored a career-high 14 points. In 126 games for the Monarchs over four seasons, he made 17 starts and averaged 1.8 points and 1.5 rebounds in 7.5 minutes per game. Professional career Harris returned to Tasmania in May 2008 and played out the SEABL season with the NW Tasmania Thunder. In late April 2008, Harris signed with the Singapore Slingers for the 2008‚Äì09 NBL season. However, the team withdrew from the NBL in late July 2008 to pursue competitions closer to home. Harris remained with the squad that was kept together, with the Slingers engaging in a series of touring matches during the 2008‚Äì09 season, most notably the Singapore Challenge Series that ended in January 2009. In 11 games during the Challenge Series, Harris averaged 6.5 points, 3.2 rebounds and 1.8 blocks per game. For the 2009 SEABL season, Harris returned to the NW Tasmania Thunder, where he averaged 18 points and 11 rebounds while finishing with 73 blocked shots. Following the conclusion of the 2009 SEABL season, Harris moved to Perth to train with the Perth Wildcats ahead of the 2009‚Äì10 NBL season. He was elevated to the full squad in mid-October as an injury replacement for Paul Rogers, and was later replaced in the line-up by American Galen Young in late December. He remained a member of the Wildcats' shadow squad for the rest of the season, and in March 2010, he became an NBL champion when the Wildcats defeated the Wollongong Hawks in the grand final series. He totalled six points and seven rebounds in six games for the Wildcats. Harris remained in Perth during the 2010 off-season and played for the East Perth Eagles in the SBL. In June 2010, Harris began to dabble in the prospect of switching to Australian rules football, as he was recruited by West Perth Football Club with the plan being to debut in the WAFL with the Falcons in 2011. Ahead of the 2010‚Äì11 NBL season, Harris had been in contention for a full NBL contract with the Wildcats but missed out due to the club's need to satisfy a league rule to sign an under-24 player. As a result, in August 2010, he joined the training squad of the Adelaide 36ers. He played two games for the 36ers in November 2010. Following the 2010‚Äì11 NBL season, Harris joined the Bendigo Braves for the 2011 SEABL season. He went on to split the 2012 SEABL season with the Hobart Chargers and NW Tasmania Thunder. He returned to the Thunder in 2013 for one final season. National team career Harris was a member of the Australian under 18 squad in 1999 and 2000, and a member of the Australian under 20 squad in 2001 and 2002. In 2003, he helped Australia win gold at the FIBA Under-19 World Championship in Greece. In 2005, he played for Australia at the FIBA Under-21 World Championship.

It stands a block away from the Palazzo Spada on Via Capo di Ferro, while a few blocks away on the Via dei Pettinari stands the Ponte Sisto. History West facade of the church Urged by Filippo Neri, by 1540 lay members of his order gathered at the church of San Girolamo della Carit√†. Neri soon had Pope Paul III recognise the group as the Confraternita della Santissima Trinita de' Pellegrini e de' Convalescenti (Fraternity of the Holy Trinity of Pilgrims and Convalescent). For the Jubilee of 1550, the group took on the burden of hosting pilgrims, with particular regard for those who came from distant lands. After Holy Year, the association cared for the convalescent poor, discharged from city hospitals. In 1558, Pope Paul IV assigned them the dilapidated church of San Benedetto in Arenula. The next year, the fraternity bought a house near the church to be used as a hospital-hospice. For the Jubilee of 1575, the fraternity hosted more than 180,000 pilgrims. The fraternity ultimately razed the decrepit church, and the first stone for the present church was laid on February 26, 1587. The consecration took place on June 12, 1616 and the church was titled initially Santissima Trinit√† e San Benedetto. In subsequent centuries the parish and adjacent buildings continued to serve as a hospice for pilgrims, or as a hospital. In 2008 Pope Benedict XVI entrusted the parish to the Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter (FSSP), a society of apostolic life dedicated to the celebration and preservation of the Tridentine Mass, the 1962 form of which is authorised, under certain conditions, for continued use within the Catholic Church.Pope Benedict XVI, Summorum Pontificum The SS Trinit√† dei Pellegrini church provides the Mass in this form for the local community, as well as for tourists and pilgrims. As the home parish of the Latin Mass in Rome, Santissima Trinit√† hosts numerous visiting clergy who celebrate the Latin mass, including Archbishop Alexander King Sample of Portland in Oregon,, Bishop Athanasius Schneider of Astana, Kazakhstan, and Cardinal Raymond Leo Burke. Art and architecture Facade =Facade= In 1722, a Piedmontese merchant, Giovanni Battista de' Rossi, commissioned the architect Giuseppe Sardi to build the partially concave, late-Baroque style fa√ßade using designs by Francesco De Sanctis. The stucco statues on the fa√ßade, depicting the four evangelists, were completed by Bernardino Ludovisi.Accurata, E Succinta Descrizione Topografica, E Istorica Di Roma, Volume 1, by Ridolfino Venturini, published by Carlo Barbellieni, Rome (1768); page 225. The adjacent building to the facade (left of the church when facing the facade) was the former hospice of the confraternity. =Interior= The church has a Latin cross design with eight chapels: #Chapel of Crocifisso #Chapel of San Filippo Neri: The altarpiece depicting the Ecstasy of St Phillip and vision of the Virgin and child (1853) was painted by Filippo Bigioli. #Chapel of Giovanni Battista de' Rossi: first dedicated to the Annunciation, and until recently, it housed the remains of this saint. It was frescoed by Giovanni Battista Ricci; The altarpieces by Antonio Bianchini depict Jesus and Saint and Phillip Neri crowns St Giovanni Battista de‚ÄôRossi. #Chapel of St Matthew: on right transept. The altar statue of Apostle Matthew was sculpted by Jacob Cornelisz Cobaert. #Chapel of the Madonna and Saints Joseph & Benedict: in left transept, now dedicated to Virgin of the Auxilium christianorum (Aide to Christians).

The altarpiece, by Giambattista Ricci, and depict Saints Joseph and Benedict of Norcia. #Chapel of St Gregory the Great: The prior church at the site was dependent on the church of San Benedetto of the monastery of San Gregorio. The altarpiece depicts Pope Gregory I liberating souls from Purgatory‚Äô‚Äô painted by Baldassarre Croce; he also painted the frescoes on the walls. #Chapel of Saints Augustine and Francis of Assisi: The altarpiece depicting the Virgin with ST Francis and Augustine by Cavalier d'Arpino. #Chapel of St Charles Borromeo: The altarpiece depicting the Virgin and child and Saints Carlo Borromeo, Domenico di Guzm√°n, Phillip Neri, and Felice da Cantalice was painted by Guillaume Courtois, also called il Borgognone. The transept and altar were designed by Martino Longhi il Vecchio and Giovanni Paolo Maggi. The nave frescoes were originally painted by Raffaele Ferrara in 1853. The cupola (1612) was designed by Giovanni Battista Contini and decorated in polychrome marble by Valadier. The pennants were frescoed with the Evangelists by Giovanni Battista Ricci; the cupola is frescoed with God the father, attributed to Reni. The main altar has four columns of African black marble, and was built in 1616 by designs of Domenico Pozzi. The altarpiece depicts the Trinity (1625), a masterwork by Guido Reni.

The Santissima Trinit√† dei Pellegrini (Most Holy Trinity of Pilgrims) is a church on via Portamedina in the historic city centre of Naples, Italy History The church building and the eponymous hospital was founded in the sixteenth century by Fabrizio Pignatelli di Monteleone, a member of the Knight of Jerusalem, and later, the complex, was given to the Brotherhood of the Holy Trinity. The hospital attached therein, the structure was designed by Carlo Vanvitelli, and enlarged along with the church in 1769. The church connects on the right nave with the small church of Santa Maria Materdomini. Description The facade is characterized by fine stucco statues of Angelo Viva, representing San Filippo Neri and San Gennaro. The architecture of the temple is somewhat unusual; the floor plan is formed by two octagons joined by a rectangle, with the first octagon which assumes the function of the nave and the second serving as oratory, while the rectangle is the presbytery. On the high altar there are works in stucco by Viva, with the two sides as many paintings by Paolo De Matteis, both representing St. Joseph with Child Jesus, while other paintings are attributed to the school of Giuseppe Bonito. The choir of the church (1754) was designed by Giovanni Antonio Medrano with a rich decoration, also in stucco. On the first altar on the left, by Onofrio Palumbo is a San Gennaro protecting Naples from lightning. In the church there is also a bust of the adviser Ferrante Magdalene, first counselor of the king, who is buried there.

Life He was born in London about 1725, and son of a gentleman holding a public office. He was a pupil of painter George Lambert, and studied at the art school in St Martin's Lane. He first exhibited at the exhibition of the Free Society of Artists in 1761, to which he sent three landscapes. In 1762, he exhibited with the same society A Gipsy telling some Country Girls their Fortune. From this time, though he occasionally exhibited landscapes, portraits, animals, and other subjects, his pictures are mainly of a humorous description, based on the style of William Hogarth, whose 'comedy in art' he strove to imitate, if not to surpass. There was a large demand for his pictures, and the engravings from them, many by first-class engravers, were published by Carington Bowles, Smith & Sayer, Boydell, and other well-known publishers. Collett continued to exhibit with the Free Society of Artists up to 1783. His pictures give insight into manners at the end of the 18th century. In 1775, Richard Brinsley Sheridan brought out his comedy The Duenna and Collett drew pictures based on scenes in this play. One of them, representing the drinking scene in the convent (act iii. scene 5), was figured in Thomas Wright's History of Caricature and Grotesque in Art. He inherited a fortune from a relation, and resided in Chelsea, London, where he died, in Cheyne Row, on 6 August 1780, and was buried there on 11 August. Assessment Collet represented scenes of debauchery, low life, and social weaknesses and absurdities. He did not possess, however, the force and deep moral of Hogarth's work, and his pictures are often mere plagiarisms, appealing only to a vulgar taste. When, however, he cared to be original, he showed great ability, and his pictures are always carefully executed. Collections Two water-colour pictures by Collett, entitled The Asylum for the Deaf and Promenaders in St. James's Park, went to the South Kensington Museum. In the print room of the British Museum there is a collection of engravings from his works., an most of which are described in the Catalogue of Political and Personal Satires Preserved in the Department of Prints and Drawings in the British Museum. There is check list of his prints by David Alexander John Goldar engraved after him The Sacrifice, The Refusal, The Recruiting Sergeant, exhibited in 1767, The Female Bruisers, exhibited in 1768, and also engraved in mezzotint by Butler Clowes, The Spirit is Willing, but the Flesh is Weak, The Country Choristers, The Unlucky Attempt, The Discovery, The Mutual Embrace, and Modern Love, in four scenes, Courtship, The Elopement, The Honeymoon, Discordant Matrimony, painted in 1765, and published in 1782, after his death. James Caldwall engraved The Gipsies, The Ladies' Disaster, The Bold Attempt, The Unwelcome Customer, The Guards of the Night defeated, A Macaroni taking his Morning Ride in Hyde Park, The Englishman in Paris, High Life below Stairs, The Cotillion Dancers, exhibited in 1772. Among numerous others were: Sweets of Liberty and The City Chanters, in mezzotint by Samuel Okey; A Rescue, or the Tars Triumphant, and Grown Gentlemen taught to dance, in mezzotint by Butler Clowes; The Coaxing Wife and An Holland Smock to be run for, by Thomas Morris; January and May, by Charles Grignion; The Frenchman in London, by C.

TARGIT is Denmark's largest developer of business intelligence and analytics software, and is also Denmark's leading business software vendor. B-eye-network Spotlight TARGIT's chief product is the TARGIT Decision Suite, which has been cited as one of the industry's easiest-to-use tools for business intelligence and analytics.http://www.targit.com/en/resources/surveysreviews/surveys- reviews/bi-survey-12  History  TARGIT was founded in May 1986 by Morten Sandlykke who served as CEO until February 2, 2017 where the company was acquired by GRO Capital. The company HQ was until 2018 located in Hj√∏rring, Denmark. Before venturing into the Business Intelligence-market the company provided software to retail and oil businesses, but then adjusted its scope to accommodate clients' need for analytical processing tools. In 1996, TARGIT acquired Morton Systems, which was led by Dr. Morten Middelfart. Following the acquisition, Middelfart became TARGIT's CTO and the company began developing business intelligence tools.Computerworld The Decision Suite (formerly BI Suite) is the culmination of those efforts, and is targeted in part to businesses using Microsoft Dynamics ERP software solutions.Database Journal 2010 According to independent IT analyst firm Gartner, TARGIT is one business intelligence platform vendor with a vision of consumerizing BI and analytics, as evidenced by the company's focus on ease of use, cross-department deployments, and mobile device compatibility. TARGIT is a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner.Microsoft Solution Finder  Decision Suite  The first version of TARGIT's business intelligence technology dates back to 1996, when TARGIT acquired Morton Systems. The newly appointed CTO, Morten Middelfart, developed TARGIT's Decision Suite around the concept of the OODA Decision Loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act) and his own CALM philosophy (Computer Aided Leadership & Management). The combination directed the Decision Suite to focus on allowing users to retrieve reports and analyses with as few user interactions as possible. This focus earned the Decision Suite a consistent place in Gartner's Magic Quadrant ranking. CALM and the OODA Loop continue to play a role in the product's development. TARGIT's software has been well received by users of Microsoft Dynamics NAV and AX for its ease of use and rapid implementation processes. The technological underpinnings of TARGIT's Decision Suite have been awarded several US patents for developments in usability, including natural language processing, data visualization techniques, and database retrieval processes.http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph- Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2;=HITOFF&p;=1&u;=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch- bool.html&r;=1&f;=G&l;=50&co1;=AND&d;=PTXT&s1;=middelfart.INNM.&OS;=IN/middelfart&RS;=IN/middelfarthttp://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph- Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2;=HITOFF&p;=1&u;=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch- bool.html&r;=2&f;=G&l;=50&co1;=AND&d;=PTXT&s1;=middelfart.INNM.&OS;=IN/middelfart&RS;=IN/middelfarthttp://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph- Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2;=HITOFF&p;=1&u;=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch- bool.html&r;=3&f;=G&l;=50&co1;=AND&d;=PTXT&s1;=middelfart.INNM.&OS;=IN/middelfart&RS;=IN/middelfarthttp://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph- Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2;=HITOFF&p;=1&u;=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch- bool.html&r;=4&f;=G&l;=50&co1;=AND&d;=PTXT&s1;=middelfart.INNM.&OS;=IN/middelfart&RS;=IN/middelfarthttp://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph- Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2;=HITOFF&p;=1&u;=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch- bool.html&r;=5&f;=G&l;=50&co1;=AND&d;=PTXT&s1;=middelfart.INNM.&OS;=IN/middelfart&RS;=IN/middelfarthttp://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph- Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2;=HITOFF&p;=1&u;=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch- bool.html&r;=6&f;=G&l;=50&co1;=AND&d;=PTXT&s1;=middelfart.INNM.&OS;=IN/middelfart&RS;=IN/middelfarthttp://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph- Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2;=HITOFF&p;=1&u;=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch- bool.html&r;=7&f;=G&l;=50&co1;=AND&d;=PTXT&s1;=middelfart.INNM.&OS;=IN/middelfart&RS;=IN/middelfart TARGIT's latest developments are in the direction of Big Data, integrating third-party technologies to allow customers to create analyses and reports based on very large data sets.

Biodiversity This conservation area conserves the unique local ‚ÄúCape Flats Dune Strandveld‚Äù vegetation with its dense evergreen thickets, flowers, shrubs and trees. The last remaining forest of the endangered White Milkwood tree (Sideroxylon inerme) on the Cape Flats is found on this reserve, and it is also home to the largest and highest dune system on the Cape Peninsula. Many of the 178 plant species that can be found here burst into flower in spring time, covering the dunes with colour. Animal species found here include buck, tortoises, porcupine, hares, mongoose and a variety of bird species. History The area was originally inhabited by the Khoi-khoi people who had lived at the Cape for centuries. In the 1600s under colonial rule, the first Muslim community in South Africa was founded here by Sheikh Yusuf of Indonesia, who named the area after his home in Indonesia ‚Äì the original Khoi name for the area was not recorded. The shrine (or ‚Äúkramat‚Äù) of Sheikh Yusuf is located on a hill on the eastern edge of the reserve and is still a site of worship and pilgrimage. Even up until today, Muslims from all over South Africa still make their way to the Kramat in Macassar to camp for the entire Easter weekend. The local Cape Flats Dune Strandveld vegetation Threats and Conservation Unfortunately the local ecosystem is classified as endangered and what is left of it is under threat from alien invasive plants like Acacia cyclops (‚ÄúRooikrans‚Äù), sand-mining and the rapid spread of informal settlements which is threatening to engulf the nature reserve. Shacks built on the dunes destroy the vegetation that is holding the sands in place. Consequently masses of mobile wind-swept sand become a problem. Areas that are infested with Acacia cyclops also burn much more easily, frequently and fiercely. These too-frequent fires reduce the ability of the indigenous vegetation to regenerate and are also a danger to the people of the neighbouring informal settlements. However, community involvement in the management of the reserve is increasing. It is used by local people for hiking, whale watching, environmental education, school excursions and fishing. In addition, traditional healers gather plants and animals from the reserve to use in traditional medicine. The reserve also provides shelter for the communities from the strong winds and sand from the coast, as well as being a protection from storm damage and a source of fresh water.

Johnson adopted his stage name as a teenager as a reference to the Dorian scale. Dorian Concept is also a member of the Austrian funk band Jacob's Salty and Bamboozling Ladder (JSBL). He also has periodically toured as a keyboarder for Flying Lotus (with Richard Spaven on drums) and collaborated with the Cinematic Orchestra. Biography He studied multimedia art with a focus on acoustic engineering and graphics at the University of Applied Sciences in Salzburg from 2005-2009. During this period, he won Elektronikland Salzburg prizes for composition in electronic music in 2005 and 2007 and released his first EP on line in 2006. Between 2006 and 2008, he also posted a popular series of five short videos on YouTube under the moniker of \\"yorktownrecreation\\" called \\"Fooling Around on Micro Korg\\" that show him improvising on the Micro Korg (and other keyboards, such as the Alesis Micron, Korg Nanokey, and Casio SA-21) and totalled over one million views after posting. He is among the self-proclaimed generation of \\"bedroom producers\\" who participated in the emergence of an international beat community based the accessibility of digital production technology and early Internet fora, such as MySpace, in the first decade of the 2000s. In 2007, the BBC Radio 1 producer Benji B \\"discovered\\" Dorian Concept at the Red Bull Music Academy in Toronto, where Paul Movahedi, a Viennese bandmate of his and RMBA participant, gave Benji B a CD with 10 unreleased Dorian Concept tracks that Benji B started airing on his show and playing in London clubs.See the interview with Dorian Concept, Benji B relates the story of his \\"discovery\\" of Dorian Concept at redbullmusicacademy.com, retrieved December 18, 2014. BBC Radio 1's Gilles Peterson also started giving Dorian Concept air-time on his program \\"Worldwide\\" and included him in the line-up of worldwide events,Starting with the Worldwide Awards on January 25, 2009 in London and Dorian Concept subsequently started to receive invitations to major electronic music festivals.Including 5 Days Off (Amsterdam), Dour (Belgium), Elevate Festival (Graz), Lowlands (NL), Jazz Middelheim (Antwerp), Pukkelpop (Belgium), North Sea Jazz (Rotterdam), Numusic (Stavanger, Norway), Sziget (Budapest), S√≥nar (Barcelona and Tokoyo), St Jerome's Laneway Festival (Brisbane), Unsound (Krak√≥w and New York), and Wilsonic (Bratislava), among others He also participated in the Red Bull Music Academy in Barcelona in 2008 and has since been involved in a number of Red Bull Music Academy events.See \\"Dorian Concept\\" on the Red Bull Music Academy website. His first album, When Planets Explode, appeared in 2009 preceded and was followed by a number of EPs and remixes. In 2010, Ninja Tune invited him to contribute a track, \\"Her Tears Taste Like Pears,\\" to its twentieth anniversary box set, Ninja Tune XX, and Ninja released an EP of his under the same title shortly thereafter. He performed at a number of Ninja XX events in Europe in 2010, including the Ninja gala celebration at Royal Albert Hall with the London Metropolitan Orchestra and the Cinematic Orcherstra in November, where he arranged and performed tracks from his Ninja EP for an ensemble including London Metropolitan string quartet accompaniment and the Cinematic Orchestra's saxophonist Tom Chant. In 2011, Jason Swincoe invited him to continue his collaboration with Cinematic Orchestra by asking him to compose film music (with Tom Chant) for two avant-garde shorts by Peter Tscherkassky, \\"Outer Space\\" and \\"Dream Work,\\" for the Cinematic Orchestra's \\"In Motion\\" series in which musicians are asked to compose original scores for classic short films, which also gave him an additional opportunity to perform in a formal concert settings with string accompaniment at the Barbican Centre in London and Tokyo. He also has performed in a more formal setting at the Austrian Cultural Forum in New York City. As of 2011, his touring and production activity dropped off with the exception of a few remixes, and he spend over two years working on a new sound and material for his second album, Joined Ends, which Ninja Tune released in October 2014.  Style  Although he had classical piano training as a child, he does not consider himself to be classically trained. As an autodidact, he identifies funk, hip-hop, jazz, and electronica as the primary influences for his music. His music cannot ‚Äúeasily be categorized, yet he has already developed his own, recognisable sound\\" as Benji B has observed in his blog in 2008. Reviewers of his original releases have noted that his sound ‚Äúfuses technical jazz flair with . . .programming skills[,] and strictly bumping beats with abstract electronica harmonics, . . .‚Äù and is ‚Äúsynthetic, electronic and beat-driven, and yet . . . musical.‚Äù \\"Unconventional chord changes, expressive dynamics and quirky layers of counterpoint melodies,...\\" also have been identified as \\"...parts of his unmistakable musical voice,...\\" along with his ability to \\"...dot effortlessly through different genres and styles: from sublime electronica to hyperactive garage to avant-garde dancehall.\\" His trademark instrument for production and performance has been the MicroKORG synthesizer. During solo live sets, he has used the Ableton software to play his tracks and improvises over them on the MicroKORG or manipulates them with the MicroKORG or the tools available on DJ consules. On his \\"minimal set-up\\", examples are available online. The release of Joined Ends in 2014 marked a departure from his established musical voice and reliance on the Microkorg as a platform for digital production and performance. Johnson purchased older retro equipment, including a Moog synthesizer, Wurlizter electronic piano, and Roland SH 101, and began to work with analogue media, including his own voiceSee Ninja Tune Joined Ends release information. Retrieved November 30, 2014 to create \\"an agile body of work filled with playful melodic earworms, complex textures, and vituosic transformations.\\" Johnson noted that the \\"new gear was important because the Microkorg . . . really tied me down to my old sound . . . [W]orking with analogue gear was a way for me to put my focus back on playing. It feels like my first musical cycle is closing and the start of a new one.\\" His aspiration was‚Äîin comparison to his frentic, established sound club‚Äîto \\"do something simple.\\" His tracks are based on the technique of recording himself performing with analogue media and then \\"self-sampling\\" and reworking the analogue material in the course of production. In an interview, he has described himself as \\"an autodidact jazz musician, who samples himself.\\" To perform this new material and sound, he also developed a new trio stage show with his long- standing Viennese friends and band-mates from JSBL: Paul Movahedi (\\"The Clonius\\") on bass and Clemens Bacher (\\"Cid Rim\\") on percussion. After Joined Ends was released, Johnson toured extensively and then dropped out of sight again for over two years to work on his third album, The Nature of Imitation, which appeared on his third label, Brainfeeder, as his third LP in 2018.

History =Foundation= The Sisters were founded in Rome through the inspiration of Father Cosimo Berlinsani, O.M.D. (1619‚Äì1694), together with Mother Anna Moroni (1613‚Äì1675). The priest had recently been appointed pastor of the Basilica Church of Santa Maria in Campitelli. In the course of his pastoral care, he found that many of the girls who came to him to make their First Communion had little or no knowledge of the Catholic faith. He asked Moroni, for whom he served as confessor, to teach some of these girls. In 1650 Moroni began to dedicate herself to the work of re-educating female victims of prostitution, shortly afterwards setting up a school to teach young girls the catechism and in 1667 receiving authorisation from the Vicar General of Rome to open a boarding house for her students. In 1671, Moroni and 12 of the students from the school, who had become her assistants, decided to form a religious community, taking the name of the Boarding School Community () of the Most Holy Child Jesus, based on a favorite devotion of Moroni. They then elected her their leader. The members of the small community all made a vow of perseverance on 2 July 1672, thereby formally establishing themselves as a lay religious society. The women initially took as their religious habit a brown tunic, in honor of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, with a woolen belt and a black, ankle- length veil. They established a limit of 33 members for their community, based on the traditional lifespan of Christ. =Expansion= The members of the community then formed a life combining adoration of the Blessed Sacrament with the service to the students of the school. New schools under their direction began to be established outside of Rome. A Rule of Life was drawn for them between 1680-1684, which received final approval from Cardinal Gasparo Carpegna in 1693, under his authority as the Cardinal Priest of Santa Maria in Campitelli, to which they were still attached. New schools of the congregation began to be founded outside of Rome: Spoleto (1683), San Severino (1693) and Rieti (1693). Not long after, though, Cardinal Lorenzo Corsini, who was their Cardinal Protector, persuaded them to adopt the Rule of St. Augustine, at which time they changed the name of the community to the Augustinian Oblates of the Most Holy Child. The following century saw continued growth of the congregation. In 1708 the community in Rome moved from their original site to the one they still have as their motherhouse, adjacent to the Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore. The historic Church of the Bambin Ges√π was built for them there during the 1730s. Additional schools of the congregation were established: Ascoli Piceno (1701), Fermo (1717), Sezze (1717) and Palestrina (1722). During the 19th century, due to their status as laywomen, not nuns, the members of the congregation and their schools were able to escape the closing of religious communities mandated by the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy. A school was founded in Gualdo Tadino in 1817. Modern era For the first 250 years of the congregation's existence, each community of Oblates had been completely autonomous, and they lived under the canonical status of a society of common life, not taking religious vows. In 1917, the Catholic Church issued its first universal code of canon law, which recognized for the first time women living in religious communities, that were not part of an enclosed religious order, as leading a consecrated life. In 1926 the Oblates voted to seek the status of a religious congregation, uniting themselves all under one central administration. Two years later, in 1928, they were allowed to profess vows as Religious Sisters. At that time they changed the name of the congregation to the one they currently use. This period saw a new spurt of growth of the congregation within Italy: Sorrento (1916), Giulianova (1931), Montone (1936), Roseto degli Abruzzi (1936) and Tortoreto (1946). In response to a general request by the pope issued to all religious orders, the Sisters began to serve in South America, opening schools in Brazil and Peru.

The institutions of pontifical right depend immediately and exclusively on the Vatican in the matters of internal governance and discipline.Code of Canon Law (C.I.C.), can. 593. History Until the 19th century the religious communities were divided into two groups: regular orders with solemn vows and congregations of simple vows. Only those taking the solemn vows were valued by the Church and the civil authorities.Direttorio canonico, p. 53. In 1215, in the Fourth Lateran Council, Pope Innocent III decreed that no regular orders could be founded without papal approval. The bishops, however, retained the right to form communities whose members lived the religious life without taking formal vows. These groups later took the name of ‚Äúcongregations of simple vows‚Äù. The congregations of simple vows, especially women‚Äôs, were increasing dramatically during the 17th and 18th Centuries, and in the early 19th Century, many of them were seeking papal recognition from Rome. in 1816 the Holy See began to approve the congregations with simple vows but they were still not recognized as religious institutions.Direttorio canonico, p. 54. In 1854 Giuseppe Andrea Bizzarri, the Secretary of the Sacred Congregation for Consultations about Regulars, created on the behalf of Pope Pius IX a procedure for the approval of congregations of simple vows, which was communicated to the bishops in 1861. With this new procedure, the distinction was formally made for the creation of an institute, operated by a bishop, and its approval by the Holy See. After its foundation, the institute (i.e., congregation) would have the status \\"of diocesan right\\". Under it, it would remain under the protection of the bishops of its diocese, where it was founded, increasing its importance. If the Holy See grants the institute the decretum laudis [decree of approval], the institute would be placed under its direct protection, and the institute would then acquire the status \\"of pontifical right\\". The distinction between the legal status of an institute of diocesan right and an institute of pontifical right was permanently drawn on 8 December 1900 by Conditae a Christo Ecclesiae [Latin, ‚ÄúFounded by the Church of Christ‚Äù], the apostolic constitution of Pope Leo XIII.

Ecology \\"Waboom protea\\" (Protea nitida) in the Kogelberg mountains Located in the Kogelberg Mountains, along the mountainous coast on the eastern edge of Cape Town, this nature reserve protects a significant portion of Kogelberg Sandstone Fynbos. Among the enormous range of plants in this local vegetation type are hundreds of species of Erica, a wide range of Protea species and a great many plant families which are endemic. The Kogelberg mountains are known as the heart of the Fynbos, and have a floral diversity per unit area that is greater than anywhere else in the world. In addition to its unique mountain fynbos, other ecosystems include wetlands, as well as the riparian vegetation of the Palmiet River, which is the most untouched in the south western Cape and are home to forests of indigenous trees such as Wild Almond, Butter-spoon, Rapanea and Yellowwoods. Shady montane forests exist in several spots - like Louwsbos, Platbos and Oudebos - where relic Southern Afrotemperate Forests grow in the ravines and river valleys.http://www.capenature.org.za/reserves.htm?reserve=Kogelberg+Nature+Reserve History R44 that runs along it. The aboriginal inhabitants of the Kogelberg mountains were the San hunter-gatherers and the Khoi herders, whose shell-middens and burial areas can still be found. During the early colonial era, explorers occasionally penetrated the mountains and reported on the area's unusual beauty and teeming wildlife, however no permanent settlements were made, as the landscape was considered far too extreme and inaccessible for farming. The Kogelberg region therefore remained almost pristine. In the early 19th century the whole area was designated \\"Crown Land\\" by the government of the Cape Colony, and over a hundred years later, in 1935, the rugged area finally became accessible, when a road was built. This brought about rapid change, as the Department of Forestry took over the region in 1937 and declared its intention of using the area for state timber plantations.E. Mossop: Old Cape Highways. Maskew Miller: Cape Town. 1928.W. Burchell: Travels in the Interior of Southern Africa. Batchford Press: London. 1953. The idea of turning the region into a nature reserve was first brought up by local landowner Harry Molteno, who put the proposal to his Cape Tercentenary Foundation board on 18 April 1951. A passionate fynbos enthusiast, he advocated for this vast stretch of mountain range to be returned to its natural state, for which he secured the vital support of the Cape Western Conservancy and Professor Harold Compton of Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens. Later in the decade, his dream was finally realised when his financial grant secured the establishment of the Kogelberg preserve, comprising the land lying south of the N2 and west of the Palmiet River - with necessary infrastructure, fencing and biological surveys.

While a small power in the international system may never equal or surpass the effect of larger powers, they can nevertheless influence the workings of the international system together with others. The formalization of the division between small and great powers came about with the signing of the Treaty of Chaumont in 1814. Before that the assumption had been that all independent states were in theory equal regardless of actual strength and responsibilities. From the second half of the twentieth century, the bipolar power blocs decreased the strategic room for manoeuvre for smaller actors. According to a 2017 review study, \\"What scholars can agree on is that small states generally prefer multilateralism as both a path to influence and a means to restrain larger states. Studies of influential small states indicate that they are able to develop issue-specific power to make up for what they lack in aggregate structural power. Small states can, therefore, develop power disproportionate relative to their size on the few issues of utmost importance to them. In addition to prioritization, small states have successfully employed the strategies of coalition-building and image-building. Even though small state administrations lack the resources of their larger counterparts, their informality, flexibility, and the autonomy of their diplomats can prove advantageous in negotiations and within institutional settings.\\"  Powers great and small  Almost all studies of power in international relations focus on great power politics and it will for this reason not be discussed here. For, as L√°szl√≥ R√©czei noted, power status hinges on the capacity for violence: \\"If the notion of war were unknown in international relations, the definition of ‚Äòsmall power‚Äô would have no significance; just as in the domestic life of a nation it has no significance whether a man is less tall or has a weaker physique than his fellow citizen.R√©czei, (1971). The Political Aims and Experiences of Small Socialist States. In Schou, A. & Brundtland, A. O. (eds) Small States in International Relations. New York: Wiley Interscience Division, p. 76. Most of the small-state studies that make up the backbone of the small power research tradition were carried out in the heyday of non- alignment by scholars such as David Vital,Vital, D. (1967). The Inequality of States: a Study of Small Power in International Relations. Oxford, England: Oxford University Press. Robert Rothstein,Rothstein, R. L. (1968). Alliances and Small Powers. New York: Columbia University Press. Maurice East and Robert Keohane. The weakening of the non-alignment movement during the 1970s coincided with a gradual decline in small-state studies, culminating in Peter Baehr's critical appraisal of the research tradition in which he questioned smallness as a useful framework for analysis. The small-power category was first taken into serious account with David Mitrany's study on world government (pax oecumenica) in 1933. Mitrany argued that the international community consisted only of two tiers of state powers: great and small.Mitrany, D. (1933). The Progress of International Government. London: George Allen & Unwin Ltd, p. 9. Asle Toje takes a view where great powers and small powers distinguish themselves through patterns of behaviour. Small powers are not down scaled great powers ‚Äì or oversized microstates.Toje, A. (2010). The European Union as a small power: After the post-Cold War. New York: Palgrave Macmillan. Alesina and Spolaore presented that the benefits of being a large state included (but were not limited too) being less economically vulnerable, militarily powerful, cheaper public goods, greater administrative strength and greater diplomatic power. Small countries can enter into military alliances, but, in general, size determines the extent of military power. It makes sense that a small state foreign policy would be formed to overcome the lack of capabilities the states battle within these areas. Take for example economic power where larger states can transfer money from boom regions to bust regions which most small states can't, which makes them more vulnerable to temporary volatility and economic fluctuation. Alesina and Spolaore state that if there were only benefits from size, then the tendency should be for the entire world to be organized in a single country. They argue that the number of states in the international system is likely to increase. They name a few reasons. Firstly, it is democratization. Dictators prefer large states so that they can extract greater rents. More democracies lead to more states. Peacefulness is also a reason. Small states can more easily survive and be stable in a peaceful world. Free trade and international economic integration also plays a big role. Small states gain access to the markets that they depend on so more free trade and economic integration -leads to more states. The presence of international institutions to coordinate political and economic policies also plays a role as well as more comprehensive international law and better defined property rights.  Defining small powers  There is no one definition of small powers. Therefore, they have been defined in various ways. As Thorhallsson and Steinsson point out, shortage of the resources and capabilities that determine power and influence are central to most definitions of small powers. The most common factor for defining state size, however, they continue is population size. Besides the size of population, other variables such as territory, economy, and military capabilities are also used. Even though the most common factor for defining small powers is the size of the population, there is not an agreement of how populous states should be to be defined as small or middle powers. Although states with less than 10 or 15 million inhabitants are regarded as small by most academics, states with up to 30 million inhabitants are sometimes considered small. Others, however, think of size as a relative concept where the influence of great powers is seen as far greater and the influence of middle powers moderately greater than those of small powers. Additionally, small states barely have the capabilities to influence the international system. It is quite clear that this ‚Äúsmallness‚Äù is not systematic, but as Long among others states, reduced size really depends on context. The concept of state as well as that of power are therefore not consequential to just one factor, but to many such as markers of population, GDP, or military indicators. To find a balanced conclusion, we need to discern quantitative and qualitative approaches to analyze and define a small state. As a matter of fact, smallness and greatness can evolve in time and as Vital points out all states possess aspects of strength and weakness. In a realistic approach to small states theory we could observe how small powers are mostly defined by their actual lack of power, which is of course not the case. They are for instance quite relevant in the IR area, both to the political and social aspect. This could be, according to Chong and Maass (2010) an indicator of power, more precisely \\"foreign policy power\\". For example, Thorhallsson proposes a framework that intertwines multiple factors. In that regard, factors such as fixed size (population and territory), sovereignty size (the degree to which a state controls its internal affairs and borders and is recognized), political size (military and administrative capabilities, domestic cohesion, and foreign policy consensus), economic size (GDP, market size, and development), perceptual size (how a state is perceived by internal or external actors), and preference size (the ideas, ambitions, and priorities of domestic elites regarding their role in the international system) are given equal value as opposed to just a single factor.  The Size of Small States  = Optimal Size of States = The size of small states is affected by several variables. These tend to result in a balance between the diversity of the population and the benefits of a larger state. The costs of the diversity within the population occurs from different needs and preferences within the population. These include: * Non-economic factors (culture, religion, language) * Economic factors (income and industrialization patterns) A benefit of a larger state is a larger market and more efficient provision of public goods. States can also grow to create larger internal markets to internalize the benefits of free trade opportunities. In a free trade regime, states can remain smaller. Historically times of war have led to state consolidation due to the cost and benefits of a centralized military. Larger states tend to correlate with stronger central governments while democratization tends to generate smaller states. = Early History of Small States in Europe = From the 14th to 17th century European city-states were unified around politics and economics and had many of the characteristics of modern small, democratic countries. Industrialization and a search for larger markets and inter- regional trade led to regional consolidation. Professionalization of the European military and innovation in military technology increased the financial cost of wars. This increased the benefits and power of a larger state. Outside of Europe empires (China, the Ottoman Empire and India) tended to expand with the incentive to tax and support the elite. However, history has demonstrated that expansion often was the downfall of empires and that there was a more optimal size for states. The inherent geographical constraint on England is partially credited with the effective development of a sustainable state in the late 16th and 17th centuries, rather than a conquest driven effort of territorial acquisition.  Evaluating the size of a state  To answer the question of what constitutes a small state, many different criteria must be regarded. Many factors, both subjective and objective, can contribute to what is perceived as the size of a state, so there is no one entirely fulfilling definition. No matter how diverse criteria are used to define the size of states, no one method will suffice to group the states of the world today because of their diversity. For example, the easiest and most often used indicators of the size of a state, population and geographical area, already pose a problem if the world's states are to be grouped in two: small or large. In that case, extremely different countries like San Marino and Sweden on one hand and Italy and China on the other would get grouped together. In their article Introduction: Small states and the European Union Clive Archer and Neill Nugent mention Raimo V√§yrynen's definition of the axes along which the properties of small states had been measured in international relations literature by the time of V√§yrynen's survey's publication in 1971. Although not perfect, it remains useful now despite its age, to capture the different approaches used when small states are identified: \\"One axis considers whether the factors involved are endogenous or exogenous: that is to say, whether the smallness lies in the internal aspects of a country itself (such as its population or Gross Domestic Product [GDP]) or in its relations with other states (such as the size of its armed forces or its alliance status). The other axis involves objective and subjective evaluations: that is, whether the smallness is seen in terms of ‚Äòmeasureable‚Äô elements (such as geographical area or size of the diplomatic corps) or ‚Äòimpressionistic‚Äô elements (notably views held and/or expressed by practitioners and commentators either at home or abroad).\\" In the same paper, they mention the difficulty of categorizing a state as a small state based only on its size. They argue how the population size can determine the decision if a small state is considered small, but the actual parameters used for that approach can be rather complicated. They go on to explain how a state that has a population below one million falls into the category of a micro-state, but a state with a population over ten million would be better described as a medium-sized state. Also, that number is not necessarily the only one used for the measurement, mostly because of the similar sizes of some states. They use the examples of Central European states such as the Czech Republic and Hungary and the Benelux states, the original ten million margin would more logically be moved to twelve, so that it could include these countries on the small state spectrum. The exploration of these parameters is a big part of the small state debate, especially in Europe. The authors also mention the big difference between European, and for example Latin American or African countries. The states in Latin America unquestionably have larger populations, but that still does not really affect their placement in the category of small states, because their weakness in the international system is still noticeable and influences the way the states are seen as ‚Äúsmall‚Äù. This is an important approach, since it makes it clear how aside from the geographical and population size, the country's GDP, the ranking of a state in the international system, the political, economical and military power play an important role in putting a state somewhere on the spectrum.  Foreign policy of small states  Small states are usually more vulnerable to changes in the international system since they are more focused on survival than the bigger states. The costs of being exploited are way higher for small states and the effects of foreign- policy mistakes are much bigger, since the bigger states have a larger margin of time and error. So in some ways statesmen in small states have to watch more closely for external constraints. Using that reasoning, IR-theorists tend to believe that the foreign-policy of small states is more greatly influenced by the international system rather than their domestic politics. Miriam Fendius Elman talks about this in her article The foreign policies of small states: challenging neorealism in its own backyard, adding that foreign policy of bigger states tends to be more influenced by their domestic politics: ‚ÄúBy contrast, domestic politics will necessarily play a greater role in an explanation of great power foreign policy. Generally speaking, great powers are faced with a lower level of external threat in comparison to small states and thus have more options for action. This increased range of choice will tend to make foreign policy formation more susceptible to domestic political influences. Consequently, unit level variables cannot be ignored when explaining great power foreign policy.‚Äù She continues to quote Snyder where he points out the importance of the size of state when its foreign policy is being analysed: ‚ÄúSimilarly, Snyder assumes that the study of small state and great power behaviour require different analytical foci. He points out that 'among the great powers, domestic pressures often outweigh international ones in the calculations of national leaders'.'1 Since great powers 'enjoy a substantial buffer from the pressures of international competition', domestic political explanations are good predictors of their foreign policy strategies. When studying the foreign policies of small states, Snyder does not expect domestic political theories to fit as well. Whereas 'great powers adapt their foreign strategies to their domestic circumstances', small states are more 'exposed to the vagaries of international security and economic competition'. Since small state foreign policy strategies will reflect an attentiveness to external exigencies, international/structural explanations should suffice.‚Äù More and more research is being done specifically on small states, how they develop their foreign policy, and how they are at some level completely different from larger states. Authors Alyson J.K. Bailes, Bradley A. Thayer, and Baldur Thorhallsson make the argument that small states differ from larger states in how they form alliances in their article Alliance theory and alliance 'Shelter': the complexities of small state alliance behavior. They acknowledge that small states are naturally more vulnerable than larger states, due to smaller militaries, economies, and overall population size. However, they also argue that small states are not without power, especially when viewed through the theory of alliance of shelter. In comparison with the more traditional international relations view that small states will always be obligated to seek protection from more power neighboring states and form alliances with them, the theory of alliance of shelter expands on and differs from this claim and viewpoint in six key ways. # Shelter theory recognizes that small states are 'fundamentally different' that large states and therefore must act and make decisions using different logic. # The alliances that small states form reflect not only the international reasons why the alliance is necessary, but the domestic reasons as well. # Small states are able to benefit from alliances with larger states and reap greater relative gains than the larger state. # In order to survive and thrive, small states rely heavily on alliance of shelter theory. # Alliance of shelter theory allows small states to avoid isolation with the outside world using their alliances, which can have a profound social and cultural impact on the small state. # Due to these alliances, small states may undergo a transformation, both internationally and domestically, which can come at a high cost to the small state. Baldur Thorhallsson and Alyson J. K. Bailes take the shelter theory even further and talk about how small states have three vulnerabilities, political, economic and societal. # Political shelter is all about power, be it military or diplomatic. When a state does not have the sources to defend itself, it means that it lacks hard power, for example military, and diplomatic power which means poor administrative capacity. Therefore, is it essential for the small states to \\"be sheltered by the norms and rules of the international system.\\" # Economic shelter is very important for small states, it means having economic assistance, access to a common market and even beneficial loans amongst other factors, and it can be from an organisation or another state. In fact, \\"small domestic markets and concentrated production make small states acutely dependent on international trade.\\" # Societal shelter is about identity and being recognised by others. Unfortunately, \\"small states risk cultural, educational and technological stagnation without the free flow of people, goods and ideas.\\" That is why it is not only important but necessary for small states to rely on others in order to prevent stagnation. It needs to be taken into account that these vulnerabilities come with a cost if small states look towards shelter by either organisations or larger states. The agreements small states have to make need to be beneficial for both them and the state providing the shelter, although the costs may differ between states. It is not always easy for the small states to negotiate on beneficial terms because \\"shelter providers may impose conditions on smaller states in exchange for the shelter, reducing the small partner‚Äôs freedom of manoeuvre and choice.\\" In Europe there are various important and inexpensive shelters available for small states.  Power Maximization in international negotiations  A traditional, Realist view of Small States is that they are disadvantaged within the international system. A Liberal Institutionalist view emphasizes the institutionalization of the international system through international cooperation. According to Diana Panke, small states can be strategically benefited by a multilateral institutionalized environment. * When decisions are taken according to a one- state, one-vote, majority voting procedure - such as the WTO and the UN - small states are at the advantage. * When decisions are taken according to a weighted voting system - such as the EU - small states are disproportionately weakened. Small states have less representational ability to engage with each international agenda item. = Influential techniques used by small states = Maximize influence through strategic priorities e.g. Climate Change, Equality * Chair meetings * Agenda setting * Individual or collective persuasion strategies Small states are at a disadvantage in the UN Security Council (UNSC) due to economic, administrative and military weaknesses. According to Baldur Thorhallsson these weaknesses are related to small territories, small economies and small populations. A Realist perspective takes little notice of small states. It focuses on hard power - military and economic resources. According to Realism small states will always be weak in negotiations. Small states are not powerful according to traditional measures of power and are primarily ignored or disregarded by larger powers. Liberal Institutionalism sees small states as actors with great potential. A lack of influence is only evidence of a lack of cooperation - or collective action problems. International institutions can decrease the price of cooperation, facilitate information sharing and provide a venue for relationship building.  Unique Powers of Small States  Norm entrepreneurship - develop and promote ‚Äònew‚Äô ideas such as equality and sustainable development * Issue specific power - e.g. fisheries, oil production * Diplomats are more flexible, autonomous, and directly influential in domestic government. * Less bureaucratic and therefore potentially faster acting. * More focused interests and therefore able to form coalitions and trade votes. Characteristics of small powers Though a single definition has proved elusive due to the number of potential variables and their particular interpretation under given conditions, Asle Toje claims to have found recurring traits in the research literature regarding the behavioural patterns of small powers on the international stage: # The strategic behaviour of small powers is characterized by dependence. A small power recognizes that it cannot obtain security by relying solely on its own capabilities. They cannot affect the international system alone but with some concerted effort they can affect the way the system works. A small power plays a dispensable and non-decisive part in a great power's array of political and military resources. Small powers therefore tend towards a policy of either strict neutrality or alliance. Those ‚Äòlocated in geopolitical regions critical to maintaining a great power‚Äôs position in the international system [tend] to opt for alliance‚Äô. In an alliance, small powers tend to follow the alliance leader closely, lend it what support they can and avoid antagonizing it. Under regional hegemony with a low probability of punishment, small powers tend to adopt neutrality. # Small powers display variable geometry. In terms of military capabilities there is no ability to project power on a global scale. They are forced by their limited resources, their location and by the international system itself to establish clear priorities. To this end, they identify a hierarchy of risks and attempt to internationalize those considered to be most serious. Small power policies, argues David Vital, are aimed at altering the external environment by ‚Äòreducing an unfavourable discrepancy in strength, broadening the field of manoeuvre and choice, and increasing the total resources on which the state can count in times of stress‚Äô.Vital, D. (1967) The Inequality of States: A Study of Small Power in International Relations, Oxford: Oxford University Press. p.134 Small powers are therefore status quo oriented. They work within the established order rather than attempting to revise the order itself. # Small powers are the primary beneficiaries of international institutions and are, by necessity, lovers of the law. A small power will often seek to minimize the costs of conducting foreign policy and will increase the weight behind its policies by engaging in concerted efforts with other actors. Generally, this leads to a high degree of participation in and support for international organizations, which leads to a tendency to adopt ‚Äòmoral‚Äô or ‚Äònormative‚Äô policy positions. Formal rules are actively encouraged in order to curb the great powers and strengthen their own position. # Small powers are risk averse. They see more dangers than opportunities in international politics, which leads them both to shun system-upholding tasks and to display a penchant for token participation in such endeavours. Zaki Laidi defines a risk averse power as an international actor that ‚Äòdefines and responds to the political states of a given identified risk in terms of a will to reduce its uncertainties and uncontrollable effects‚Äô.La√Ødi, Z. (2010) Europe as a Risk Averse Power ‚Äì A hypothesis, Garnet Policy Brief No. 11, p. 1. Due to the risks of extermination when challenging more powerful states, their ambitions are generally ‚Äòdefensive‚Äô. They have a narrow range of interests and little freedom of activity. Annette Baker Fox sees small powers as being geographically bound in the sense that their demands are restricted to their own and immediately adjacent areas, while great powers exert their influence on a global scale. Subsequently, small power strategic behaviour is characterized by a general reluctance to coerce and a tendency to promote multilateral, non-military solutions to security challenges.‚ÄùFox, A. B. (1959) The Power of Small States: Diplomacy in World War Two, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 3, fn. 8.  Small powers in international organizations  Small states can under some circumstances have a disproportionately great influence. According to Diana Panke, \\"Small states tend to be most likely to punch above their weight if the negotiations take place in an institutionalised arena with majority-based decision-making rules in which each state has one vote or in contexts in which decisions are made unanimously, if they are selective in negotiations and concentrate their capacities on the most important issues, engage in capacity-building activities to maximise their ideational resources, if they make use of institutional opportunity structures such as chairing meetings and engaging in agenda-setting, and if they individually or collectively apply persuasion strategies from early on\\". The majority of the states in the world can be considered small states, but somehow there is less than ideal information about the activities of small states within international organisations particularly when it comes to influencing policy outcomes Small states encounter size-related obstacles in different negotiation settings (the negotiation settings ranging between everything from the UN and the EU to the WTO) as well as in capacity-building and shaping strategies used to influence negotiation outcomes. A size-related obstacle would for example be the EU which uses a system of weighted voting, which gives bigger states a greater political leverage than smaller states. On the other hand a lot of International Organisations use a ‚Äúone state, one vote‚Äù principle which may appear to secure equality between states of various sizes. However, even if the formal voting itself is equal what happens in the background is not. Small states face size-related difficulties during negotiation processes in IO's such as the UN because they often possess fewer administrative, financial and economic resources, which hinders them in participating in the negotiation process at the same level as the larger states. They are simply spread too thin across various issues and therefore resort to concentrating all their resources towards the issue of highest significance. Therefore, small states are forced to choose between their interests in negotiations. They also produce better results if they use persuasion based strategies rather than bargaining ones because they lack bargaining leverage. In addition, delegates from smaller states tend to have speaking points for fewer issues and smaller budgets than the delegates from the larger nations; This gives the larger states a better position to influence outcomes both in weighted and equal weight voting systems. There is a number of ways that small states can try to counter size-related obstacles. (Small states can engage in capacity-building, for example through contacts with or through joining coalitions. Capacity building can increase a state's ideational capacities and amplify the effectiveness of persuasion-based strategies. Coalitions have burden-sharing effects and can increase the discursive leverage of its members Secondly small states can also use shaping strategies. Shaping strategies can include either legal, moral or normative argumentation applied in different negotiation settings. Framing and reframing is for example important for small states if there is a high number of delegations participating in the negotiations. These strategies help small states compete, but they are not always enough for them to compete successfully. The location of a small power can be very important for its survival. If a small power is working as a so call \\"buffer state\\" between two bigger rival power then it is more likely for that state to cease to exist. Despite the fact that the buffer location can decrease the likelihood of a small powers survival does not mean that a state cannot use its buffer location as an advantage. In the cod wars (a fishing dispute over a 20-year period between Iceland and the UK) the micro nation of Iceland was able to use both its small size and location as an advantage and won the conflict. One of the reasons is the threat by Icelandic authorities to leave NATO and remove the US defence force out of the country. It seems that the UK were not willing to go as far as the Icelandic government to win the dispute even though they had the military power to do so. According to Sverrir Steinsson, it seems that the simple liberal explanation is not enough on its own to explain the difference between the nations in a satisfactory way. Even though many Icelandic officials did not want to leave NATO over the fishing dispute, they had enormous pressure from the public to do so if the dispute would not end, while the UK had much less public pressure over the issue. According to Steinsson's result it seems that small powers are much more affected by domestic view then bigger powers witch can increase the chances of a small state leaving an international organisation.  Small states' power  Small states‚Äô power can be categorized as particular-intrinsic, ‚Äúderivative‚Äù and collective. Through one of these three types of power can small states best seek their needs and interest. Middle or great powers are not precluded from these types of power, only the limitations of the small states force them to rely on them more. Small states have different goals and different bases, i.e. ideational, material and relational bases. Bases are the resources that a state has and can exploit in order to effect another's behavior. This variation of small states‚Äô bases lead to a variety of means of power. Means in this context are the ways a state utilizes its base. The three categories of power all have different bases and therefore different means, best understood as small states‚Äô properties and its actions. Particular-Intrinsic Power Small states lack many of the factors that usually determine capability. Some may however possess a particular form of intrinsic power. Particular-intrinsic resources can serve as the base of small states‚Äô power but the resources will only gain importance through the states actions. For example, small states may rely on their strategic location or material possessions. Identity can also be a potential base for the exercise of power. Derivative Power Small states that lack material capabilities can try to persuade larger states to take actions that will increase their interests and thus derive power. In this category of power the base is the relationship between the great power and the small state. The means of this power will depend on the small states‚Äô goals and the type of relationship it has with the larger state. In a friendly relationship, for example, there can be the possibility for an access to policy discourses. Collective Power The base of collective power is the relationship a small state has to other small states. This type of power can be achieved through single-issue groupings, institutionalism or by leveraging allies in pursuance of one state's cause. Furthermore, collective power can be either institutional or compulsory. A collective power is compulsory when a large state is directly pressured by small states to change its policies through promises or threats. Institutions can provide small states with protection and a voice. They can provide the ability for small states to influence rules and be used to broaden norms in the international field. International organizations are particularly useful for small states in terms of norm promoting activities.  The effect of industrial sectors on small (Nordic) states behaviour  Since small states are more dependent on their leading economic sector more than larger states. The Nordic states of Denmark, Sweden and Finland have sought shelter in the European Union while the remaining others, Iceland and Norway, do not. The five Nordic states have differences that are important to their industrial structures as Lars Mjoset, a Norwegian political economist, pointed out. Ingebritsen noted that: Each Nordic government had to respond to a different set of interest groups ‚Äì some that anticipated positive benefits of European integration and others that anticipated undesirable costs. One of the major differences is how dependant nations are on their raw materials and manufacturing production. For example, Iceland is a nation that is heavily dependent on fishing as its main export and therefore seeks to protect its fisheries. If Iceland would join the EU it would have to share the market as well as its fishing grounds with for example Spain and Portugal. ‚Äò In Iceland, fishing is a strategic sector: the interests of fishermen are synonymous with government policy goals. Icelanders are uncompromising when it comes to fish‚Äô (ibid, p. 127). This can be seen in more recent events when the Icelandic government put membership to the EU to a national vote following the financial crisis, in which the Icelandic people voted ‚Äòno‚Äô ‚Äì the fisheries being the too great of a risk factor following membership (ibid). However, Norway is in a much stronger position in the international community with less dependency on the ‚Äòinternationally oriented manufacturing sector and more reliant on a single industry for its export revenue: the petroleum sector‚Äô (ibid, p. 129). Norwegians hold power with their petroleum sector and have access to important markets for petroleum in Europe without having to join the EU (ibid, p. 130). Denmark joined the EC in 1973 although with agriculture being the dominant sector at the time, however in recent years manufactured goods have become the largest sector for the Danish national income. (ibid, p. 122). Danes remained quite supportive and optimistic about the EC with even the support of Trade Unions: The trade union movement supports the completion of the internal market‚Äô; ‚Äòincluding the removal of the technical and physical barriers to trade, and the liberalization of competition within the EC‚Äô Unlike Iceland, Danish farmers welcomed the competition and access to more markets Despite this the Danes have remained active in judging new treaties in the EC/EU and been very observant for national interests, for example by voting no to the Maastricth Treaty on 2 June 1992. However, it did not affect the Danes in the long run and they did sign the treaty eventually. Sectoral differences between the Nordic applicants to the EC in the 1970s (Norway and Denmark) can account for the reason why the Danes decided to enter the EC and the Norwegian government failed to achieve a majority in favor of joining the EC. Sweden was also very pro-EC and joined in 1995. The Swedish industry had been international for a long time but after moving a lot of their operations into the European markets the businesses managed to convince the government it was in the national interest to follow their example. Such active, well coordinated deep integration outside Sweden was only seen in Finland who embraced the EC into the roots of society (ibid, pp. 143‚Äì144).  Constructivist view on small states  According to constructivists states behavior is subject to change when the identities and interests of states change. That means that small states do not necessarily do what's practical but can pursue ideational goals as well. Neumann and de Carvalho stated that small states primarily seek status and that small powers suffer from status insecurity to an extent that established great powers do not, which makes the status game even more important to them. Smaller powers have status insecurity to an extent that established great powers do no have, therefore making the status game even more important to them. It is important to distinguish status seeking of smaller power from greater powers. Smaller states have limited power resources and aiming for status can be the only possible choice. Small state's identity is constituted in relation to great powers and therefore initially hierarchical. Small and middle powers play a role in constituting great powers and the greater posers depend on non-great powers to acknowledge their greatness. International status seeking cannot be separated from domestic legitimation, especially with small states that are integrated in global politics. Smaller states' status aim is often to stand in one or more peer groups of similar states. They might also seek recognition by great powers as useful allies, contributors to systems maintenance or as impartial arbiters. Smaller states do not seek status by seeking to match greater powers materially. Some degree of emulation can however pay off. States can be a major donor in the United Nations and give competitive status among peer groups of small states while simultaneously acknowledge great powers for system maintenance. Small states can get access to the middle power club since this is a category with loose membership criteria, but access to the great power club is not possible. Small states may opt for a collective strategy of mobility into the middle power rank by taking on extended responsibilities for preserving international order. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

History In the late 1900s, the success of the three-phase electrification on mountain lines such the Valtellina line, the Simplon Tunnel and the Giovi Pass line, led the newly formed Ferrovie dello Stato, under the direction of Riccardo Bianchi, to extend the electrification to other lines, where electric locomotives gave better performance. For the new lines to be electrified, three batches of electric locomotives were ordered, including the E.330 and the E.550 (a type E.551 was ordered but not built). Unlike the previous electric locomotives used on mountain lines, the new locomotives had to be able to vary their speed, a capability which at the time was difficult to achieve, due to the fact that the three-phase motor spins at constant speed set by the feeding current frequency. The E.330 was designed to have four speeds (where the E.430 had only one and the contemporary E.550 two); this capability was obtained thanks to two patents by the German engineer Manu Stern and the Hungarian engineer Maurice Milch. The wheel arrangement chosen was 1‚Ä≤C1‚Ä≤, similar to that adopted on the contemporary 685 class of steam locomotives. The production contract was signed in 1913, construction of the new units beginning at Societ√† Italiana Westinghouse, which had designed the locomotive under the direction of K√°lm√°n Kand√≥. The mechanical parts were co-built with Societ√† Italiana Ernesto Breda. The locomotives were assigned to the Valtellina and Ligurian coast lines. The E.330s became operational in the Spring 1914. They were later used also in Lombardy on the local three-phase lines, until, from 1962, the railroads were adapted to the now standard 3,000 V direct current electrification. All the E.330s were phased out during the 1960s.

It was built in the 1760s for James Hamilton, 8th Earl of Abercorn, and was designed by Sir William Chambers. It is now protected as a category A listed building, and the grounds of the house are included in the Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes in Scotland, the national listing of significant gardens. History The lands of Duddingston were purchased by James Hamilton, 8th Earl of Abercorn (1712‚Äì1789), in 1745 from the Duke of Argyll. During the Jacobite rising of 1745, Bonnie Prince Charlie's cavalry camped in the park, before the Battle of Prestonpans. In 1760, Lord Abercorn commissioned Sir William Chambers (1723‚Äì1796) to design a modest new house, which was constructed between 1763 and 1768. The total cost of the house and pleasure grounds, laid out by Robert Robinson in the style of Capability Brown, was around ¬£30,000. After Lord Abercorn's death in 1789, the estate passed to his heirs but the house was let. The Benhar Coal Mining Company bought a large part of the estate in the 1880s, and in 1894 Duddingston Golf Club was developed in the grounds. Holyrood High School was built in the park in the 1960s, to the west of the house. By this time the house was in poor repair, and in 1959 it was bought, along with , by a Mr E. Gladstone, who restored the house and opened it as a hotel in 1963. In the 1990s the stables and service block courtyard of the house were converted into town houses, while the main house was restored by the Burrell Company as offices.

With five petit ouvrages the sector was poorly equipped with fortress artillery, limiting the ouvrages ability to provide mutual support. The sector was attacked in 1940 by German forces in the Battle of France. Despite the withdrawal of the mobile forces that supported the fixed fortifications, the sector mounted a strong resistance. Two of the petit ouvrages fell to German attack, the remainder holding out until the Second Armistice at Compi√®gne. The surviving positions and their garrisons finally surrendered on 2 June 1940. During the Cold War, Ouvrage Kerfent was partially reactivated as a communications station for Royal Canadian Air Force units stationed in northwestern France with NATO. At present, most of the underground works in the sector are flooded by groundwater. Only Ouvrage Bambesch has been preserved and may be toured by the public. Casemate des Quatre Vents Sud Concept and organization The Faulquemont sector was part of the larger Fortified Region of Metz, a strongly defended area between the Ardennes to the west and the Sarre valley to the east. The Metz region was more important during the planning and construction phase of the Maginot Line than it was in the operational phase of the Line, when the sectors assumed prominence.Mary, Tome 1, p. 15 The Fortified Region of Metz was dissolved as a military organization on 18 March 1940.Mary, Tome 3, p. 79 The initial plans for the sector in 1930 envisioned the construction of four gros ouvrages, eight petit ouvrages and 23 casemates. Since the sector was of second importance, by the time work began in the sector the building programme had been cut back. All of the Faulquemont ouvrages were infantry works. There were no gros ouvrages mounting heavy artillery in the sector. Lacking such major works, the sector formed an extension of the weaker right wing of the neighboring SF Boulay, whose eastern positions were similarly lacking in artillery.Mary, Tome 1, p. 28 Uniquely, artillery support in the SF Faulquemont was provided by three casemates behind the main line firing to either side along the line. The artillery casemates resemble detached artillery blocks from a gros ouvrage. However, these casemates were evacuated on 15 June 1940 and played no major role in the fighting around the ouvrages. A follow-up programme was planned to augment the ouvrages with artillery, but financial difficulties delayed the projected start date in 1940. The artillery casemates were completed in 1937-1938.Mary, Tome 3, pp. 111-115 File:Insigne r√©gimentaire du 69e R√©giment d‚ÄôInfanterie (Forteresse).jpgInsignia of the 69th RIF.

Command The Faulquemont sector was under the overall command of the French 3rd Army, headquartered at Fort Jeanne d'Arc at Metz, under the command of General Charles Cond√©, which was in turn part of Army Group 2 under General Andr√©-Gaston Pr√©telat. The SF Faulquemont was commanded by General Baudoin until 14 April 1940, then General Mendras until 29 April, and finally General de Girval. The command post was at Helfdange. The interval troops, the army formations that were to provide the mobile defense for the sector, to support and be supported by the fixed defenses, were under the command of the 9th Corps (9e Corps d'Armee), General Laure, commander. The 6th Corps included the 47th Infantry Division.Mary, Tome 3, p. 99 Artillery support for the sector was provided by the 163rd Position Artillery Regiment (R√©giment d'Artillerie de Position (RAP)), which controlled both fixed and mobile artillery, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Hanoteau. The 47th ID was a Class A reserve formation. At the midpoint of the Battle of France on 1 June 1940, the fortress troops of the SF Faulquemont amounted to four fortress infantry regiments in twelve battalions, comprising 645 officers and 18,850 men.Mary, Tome 3, p. 189 During the general retreat from the French frontier in mid-June the sector's mobile forces were designated the groupement Girval, comprising the 146th and 156th RIFs, the 69th and 82nd RMIFs (from the SF Sarre), the second and third battalions of the 39th RAMF, the first battalion of the 163rd RAP and the first and second battalions of the 166th RAP, and several other battalions.Mary, Tome 3, p. 191 These units were attached to the 20th Army Corps.Mary, Tome 3, p. 201 Description The sector includes, in order from west to east, the following major fortified positions, together with the most significant casemates and infantry shelters in each sub-sector: =Sub-sector of Narb√©fontaine= Transferred to the SF Boulay. =Sub-sector of Steinbesch= 156th Fortress Infantry Regiment (156e R√©giment d'Infanterie de Forteresse (RIF)), Lt.

Peacetime barracks and support: * Casernement de T√©ting History Block 5, Laudrefang = 1940 = In early June in the face of the German assault, and with the collapse of the left wing of the French armies in Flanders, all fortress units attached to the Third Army were ordered to prepare for withdrawal to the south and west between 14 and 17 June The interval personnel of the SF Faulquemont were to be consolidated into a unit entitled the Groupement Girval, consisting of the 146th and 156th RIFs, together with units from the SF Sarre. On 13 June the troops of the field army in the intervals between fortifications began to withdraw towards the south, followed the next day by the fortress units designated for withdrawal. The withdrawal left the ouvrage garrisons in their positions to cover the withdrawal of the interval troops and the fortress infantry assigned to the divisions de marche. The Groupement Girval was assigned to the Third Army.Mary, Tome 3, pp. 191, 201 Following the 15 June 1940 breakthrough by German forces through the Saar gap, the Germans advanced along the rear of the Maginot Line. The German 167th Infantry Division approached Kerfent, Bambesch, Einseling and T√©ting, now manned only by their individual garrisons, on 19 June. The 167th was a weak, inexperienced formation. However, the 167th's parent unit, H√∂heres Kommando XXXXV, had obtained extra 8.8cm high-velocity guns, which had proven particularly effective against Maginot positions in other sectors.Romanych, Rupp, pp. 67-68 On the 20th the Germans assaulted Bambesch. After an initial infantry assault was repelled, a sustained barrage with 8.8 cm guns on Block 2 drove the defenders into the underground galleries. With further attacks on Block 3, the defenders risked entrapment and asphyxiation. Supporting fire from Kerfent was of limited use, since the petit ouvrage did not mount heavy weapons. Bambesch surrendered at 1900 hours.Kaufmann 2006, p. 172 German casualties were six wounded and one dead. The following day the Wehrmacht attacked Kerfent with 8.8 cm fire from a battery positioned atop Bambesch. Kerfent's cloches were hit by direct fire and Block 3 had to be abandoned after it was holed. The German batteries approached to within to attack Block 2 using the cover of the nearby woods. A follow-up infantry assault ran into trouble, taking fire from Mottemberg and the Mottemberg Sud casemate in addition to Kerfent's machine gun turret. Despite this support, Kerfent was forced to surrender. The Germans suffered four dead and thirty wounded.Mary, Tome 3, p. 210 On the 21st the Germans] attacked Einseling, which was more fortunate, as it was within range of Laudrefang's 81mm mortars, the only such weapons in the sector. Einseling benefitted as well from a French ruse. French soldiers occupied nearby interval casemates at night, convincing the Germans that the casemates, which were evacuated by day, still harbored combat teams. The Germans divided their fire between the casemates and the ouvrage. Laudrefang's fire, along with accurate fire from Einseling's lighter weapons, broke up a German artillery attack. The defense was supported by the Quatre-Vents Nord casemate, which had been re-occupied by French teams. The ouvrage survived until the Second Armistice at Compi√®gne took effect on 25 June, when it surrendered. T√©ting fared similarly. After a disorderly German retreat the infantry attacks were suspended in favor of an artillery barrage at Laudrefang, firing between 3000 and 3500 rounds at the ouvrage.Mary, Tome 3, p. 212 Compared to other German attacks on other ouvrages, the bombardment of Laudrefang was relatively ineffectual. While the concrete structure was badly damaged, it was not perforated, and the mortar turrets and cloches were not hit.Mary, Tome 3, p. 223 The ouvrage survived until the Second Armistice at Compi√®gne took effect on 25 June, when it surrendered. The machine gun turret at Block 3 was used for testing of shaped-charge munitions.Mary, Tome 5, p. 155 Units The 146th Fortress Infantry Regiment (the Faulquemont Regiment) held the Bois-des Ch√™nes sub-sector. The regiment's third battalion sw action in September 1939, when it participated in an incursion in the Warndt Forest, with fighting on 9 September at Ludwiller. The regiment's interval troops were ordered to retreat on 14 May 1940, initially to the north, but on the 16th their orders were changed to have them regroup to the south on the Marne-Rhine Canal, where it was hoped that a defense could be established. However, some of the regiment's 21st battalion were captured near Domptail by elements of the German 198th Infantry Division and shot out of hand. The remainder of the 146th's mobile regiments surrendered near Saint-Di√© on 23 June. The troops who remained in their positions surrendered on 2 July.Mary, Tome 1, pp. 109-110 The 156th Fortress Infantry Regiment was in charge of the Zimming sub-sector. In September 1939 the unit's third battalion participated in the Warndt incursion, from 8 September to 20 September. The regiment's interval troops were ordered to retreat on 13 June 1940, and the interval casemates followed suit on the 15th. The ouvrages remained manned. The regiment's mobile units were attached to the groupement Girval, which retreated to the south. The regiment surrendered on 22 June. The combat teams left behind at the ouvrages fought on, with Bambesch and Kerfent surrendering under fire on 21 June. The remaining ouvrages surrendered after the armistice on 2 July.Mary, Tome 1, p. 120 = 1944 = The sector did not see significant action during the Lorraine Campaign of 1944, but Kerfent's observation block's cloche was used for weapons tests by the Americans.Mary, Tome 5, p. 210 = Cold War = After the war, Kerfent's combat blocks were mostly left in their damaged state,Mary, Tome 5, p. 163 but the underground facilities were cleaned and maintained. From 1958 to 1961, prior to France's withdrawal from the NATO integrated command structure in the mid-1960s, Kerfent's underground portions and open surface areas were used by the Canadian 601st Communications Squadron as a communications center, supporting RCAF Station Grostenquin. A microwave antenna was erected on Block 2. By 1970, Kerfent was listed for disposal,Mary, Tome 5, p. 174 and was acquired by the commune of Zimming. The military antenna was replaced by a civil television antenna. Bambesch was stabilized after the war by military engineers and was acquired by the community of Bambiderstroff. The site was opened to the public on 31 August 1973. Einseling, T√©ting and Laudrefang were in poor condition and were not chosen for renovation. Present status Groundwater intrusion is a problem in the SF Faulquemont. Bambesch is preserved and is open for public tours on occasion. Kerfent, though flooded, is interpreted by local volunteers who tour the surface of the ouvrage. Likewise, the surface of Einseling may be visited, but the underground works are flooded. Laudrefang is abandoned and flooded. T√©ting is abandoned and vandalized, but retains some of its equipment. Notes References  Bibliography Allcorn, William. The Maginot Line 1928-45.

The prison was notorious during the rule of Muammar Gaddafi for alleged mistreatment and human rights abuses, including a massacre in 1996 in which Human Rights Watch estimated that 1,270 prisoners were killed. In 2011, when the NTC invited investigators from CNN and other organizations it found only what appeared to be animal bones at that site and announced further investigations. Allegations of human rights abuses Amnesty International has called for an independent inquiry into deaths that occurred there on 29 June 1996, an incident which some have referred to as the Abu Salim prison massacre. Human Rights Watch believes that 1,270 prisoners were killed. HRW also calls the prison a \\"site of egregious human rights violations.\\" Human Rights Watch also stated in a report that they were unable to independently verify the allegations of a massacre. The claims cited by Human Rights Watch are based on the testimony of a single former inmate, Hussein Al Shafa‚Äôi, who stated that he did not witness a prisoner being killed: \\"I could not see the dead prisoners who were shot...\\" The figure of over 1200 killed was arrived at by Al Shafa‚Äôi allegedly calculating the number of meals he prepared when he was working in the prison's kitchen. Al Shafa'i stated \\"I was asked by the prison guards to wash the watches that were taken from the bodies of the dead prisoners...\\" Libyan Government rejected the allegations about a massacre in Abu Salim. In May 2005, the Internal Security Agency head of the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya told Human Rights Watch that the prisoners captured some guards and stole weapons from the prison cache. The prisoners and guards died as security personnel tried to restore order, and the government opened an investigation on the order of the Minister of Justice. The Libyan official stated that more than 400 prisoners escaped Abu Salim in four separate break-outs prior to and after the incident: in July 1995, December 1995, June 1996 and July 2001. Among the escapees were men who then fought with Islamist militant groups in Afghanistan, Iran, and Iraq. Journalist Lindsey Hilsum explored the topic in her 2012 book \\"Sandstorm\\". She met with a number of families who claimed their family members had been at the prison. She describes the massacre number as an uncertain estimate for several reasons; the main problem being the government's long term silence about the whereabouts of prisoners and their condition. She also describes eyewitness accounts of a mass shooting. The families of the disappeared and killed formed a loose association and held numerous protests in Benghazi. Lawyer Fathi Terbil helped represent them. He was arrested several times for his trouble. Saif al-Islam Gaddafi (son of the dictator) tried to resolve the issue via his Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations circa 2007. The Libyan government said in 2009, then controlled by the same people as at the time of the event, that the killings took place amid confrontation between the government and rebels from the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, and that some 200 guards were killed too. In January 2011, the Libyan Arab Jamahiriya confirmed that it was carrying out an investigation into the incident along with international investigators. Statements made in an interview with the BBC by the captured Mansour Dhao, a prominent figure in the Gaddafi regime, provides further evidence for the massacre. When the Arab Spring occurred in Tunisia and Egypt, lawyer Fathi Terbil was amongst the first arrested by Libyan authorities trying to stave off a revolution. The Abu Salim families gathered to protest his imprisonment, and this gathering eventually contributed to the revolution in Libya. Abdullah Senussi, Gaddafi's intelligence chief suspected by many to have been involved in the 1996 massacre, reportedly tried to ask Terbil to make the protests stop. On 25 September 2011, soon after the previous government had been overthrown, the governing National Transitional Council (NTC) said that a mass grave had been discovered outside the prison. Khalid al-Sherif, a military spokesman for the NTC, said that the grave was located based on information from captured former regime officials. He stated: \\"We have discovered the truth about what the Libyan people have been waiting for many years, and it is the bodies and remains of the Abu Salim massacre.\\" Ibrahim Abu Shim, a member of the committee looking for mass graves, said that investigators believed 1,270 people were buried in the grave but the NTC needed help from the international community to find and identify the remains as they lacked the sophisticated equipment needed for DNA testing. However, when the NTC invited investigators from CNN and other organizations it found only what appeared to be animal bones at that site and announced further investigations. Before the civil war, the lawyer Abdul Hafiz Ghoga took the legal representation for the families of people killed in the massacre and negotiated with Gaddafi about compensations. During the uprise Ghoga became speaker of the National Transitional Council, in April 2011 vice president, and held this position until January 2012. Inmates of Abu Salim prisonAhmed al-Senussi, a current member of the NTC, was held here by Gaddafi until his release in 2001. *Tawfiq Algazwani, a former Libyan citizen who was imprisoned for leading a Human Rights protest in Benghazi. The next day Gaddafi's forces arrested him and took him to Tripoli where he was taken into Abu Salem and imprisoned for 10 years, when he was released he immigrated to Ireland, now in Benghazi and Tripoli. Tawfiq now lives in Dublin, married and has two kids. Tawfiq was released in the 80's and immigrated to Ireland in 1988. YouTube videos On 24 January 2010, the Libyan authorities blocked access to YouTube after it featured videos of demonstrations in the Libyan city of Benghazi by families of detainees who were killed in Abu Salim prison in 1996, and videos of family members of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi at parties. Libyan civil war During the Libyan Civil War the prison was captured by the rebels on 24 August and all prisoners were set free. Among those confirmed to have been freed was volunteer rebel fighter Matthew VanDyke from Baltimore, Maryland, USA, a member of a rebel unit captured by the Libyan Army in Brega in March. An international campaign to free VanDyke had described him as a \\"writer and journalist,\\" but it was later revealed that he was a rebel fighter and prisoner of war.

It operated between 1782 and 1998. Early history Morrell's was founded by Richard Tawney in 1743 as the Lion Brewery. In 1782 he formed a partnership with Mark and James Morrell, who eventually became the owners. Morrell's brewed its beers at the Lion Brewery in St Thomas Street. In the 19th century Morrell's redeveloped and extended the Lion Brewery a number of times. A large brewing shed was added in 1879, a blacksmith's shop and engine house in 1880, a further shed and new yard in 1882, stables in 1889, new offices in 1892, a tun room in 1895, further offices in 1897 and a tall octagonal chimney in 1901. All these developments were designed by the local architect Harry Drinkwater, who also designed a number of the company's pubs. The Lion Brewery was powered by a waterwheel on Castle Mill Stream, a branch of the River Thames. This was supplemented by steam engines for which the engine house was built. One rotative beam engine that was built for the Lion Brewery in about 1826 remained in service until 1964 and is now preserved at the Abbey Pumping Station, Leicester. The Morrell family lived at Headington Hill Hall and their estate included South Park. The family included Philip Morrell (1870‚Äì1943), who was a Liberal MP 1906‚Äì18 and was married to Lady Ottoline Morrell. In 1929‚Äì31 Morrell Avenue was built along the south side of South Park. The family also owned the village of Streatley and one side of the family lived there, until Emily Morrell died in 1938, when the estate was sold. After an acrimonious family dispute the brewery was closed in 1998. Refresh UK bought the beer brands and for a time Thomas Hardy Burtonwood was contracted to brew them. Marston's acquired Refresh UK in 2008 and now brew Morrells beers. Post-brewing operations In 1998 Michael Cannon, owner of the US hamburger chain Fuddruckers, bought Morrell's 132 tied pubs for ¬£48 million through a new company, Morrells of Oxford.

It is a direct sequel to his 1998 story The Vigilante of Pizen Bluff and is one of his most historically accurate stories. The story was first published in the Danish Anders And & Co. #1999-09; the first American publication was in Uncle Scrooge #319, in July 2003. Plot The story begins approximately fifteen minutes after the end of The Vigilante of Pizen Bluff, where Scrooge McDuck is in his Money Bin together with Donald Duck and his grandnephews, having just finished telling them a story about his encounter with famous American Old West legends such as the Dalton Gang, Phineas T. Barnum, Buffalo Bill, Annie Oakley, and Geronimo. It's only now that Scrooge learns that the poster that was the original cause for the earlier adventure also contains a secret map leading to the Lost Dutchman's Gold Mine, one of the biggest lost treasures in the United States. Scrooge, Donald, and the boys thus set off on a new adventure to find this treasure. The Ducks travel to the mountains of Arizona, where the lost mine is said to be located. There, they meet a shady character who presents himself as a tourist guide and map vendor. He tells the Ducks the story of the lost mine: The mine was originally discovered by an expedition created by Don Miguel Peralta, who had been given a map to the treasure as a reward for funding the repairs of the Jesuit church of Arizpe, but because of an Apache ambush, only one man, Gonzales Peralta, survived the expedition. He left markings on the ground leading to the treasure, which Jacob Waltz then marked in his map, which now belongs to Scrooge. The Ducks start on an expedition to follow Waltz's map and find the treasure. However, right at the start, the map is accidentally destroyed, so the Ducks have to use their own intelligence to decipher Peralta's markings and find the treasure. They eventually succeed, but the shady tourist guide has followed them, and traps them in the mine, intent on claiming the entire mine for himself. Eventually, the Ducks manage to escape and get back to town, where the robber has already been arrested, thanks to Scrooge's clever advance thinking. However, Scrooge has no legal claim to the treasure, as it has all along been the property of the Native American Pima tribe, so Scrooge has to render it to their possession - receiving ten million dollars as a reward. Notes This is one of Rosa's most historically accurate stories. Jacob Waltz, the Peralta family, and Eusebio Fransesco Chino, mentioned in the story, are all real historical characters. The Lost Dutchman's Gold Mine is a real legendary lost mine, and Gonzales Peralta's markings really exist. The only things Rosa invented for himself are the deciphered meaning of Peralta's markings and the connection between Eusebio Fransesco Chino and the lost mine. The Pueblo in which the mine is located in the story appears to have been inspired by a Lieutenant Blueberry story \\"The Lost Dutchman's Mine and The Ghost with the Golden Bullets\\" (). Donald's sharp eyesight when deciphering Peralta's markings is a reference to Rosa's earlier story, An Eye for Detail. Don Rosa and his wife themselves make a cameo appearance in this story, as mountaineers travelling in the Arizona mountains.

Though first attempted manually in the 1920s, it was not until the advent of the computer and computer simulation that computation time was reduced to less than the forecast period itself. ENIAC was used to create the first forecasts via computer in 1950, and over the years more powerful computers have been used to increase the size of initial datasets as well as include more complicated versions of the equations of motion. The development of global forecasting models led to the first climate models. The development of limited area (regional) models facilitated advances in forecasting the tracks of tropical cyclone as well as air quality in the 1970s and 1980s. Because the output of forecast models based on atmospheric dynamics requires corrections near ground level, model output statistics (MOS) were developed in the 1970s and 1980s for individual forecast points (locations). The MOS apply statistical techniques to post-process the output of dynamical models with the most recent surface observations and the forecast point's climatology. This technique can correct for model resolution as well as model biases. Even with the increasing power of supercomputers, the forecast skill of numerical weather models only extends to about two weeks into the future, since the density and quality of observations‚Äîtogether with the chaotic nature of the partial differential equations used to calculate the forecast‚Äîintroduce errors which double every five days. The use of model ensemble forecasts since the 1990s helps to define the forecast uncertainty and extend weather forecasting farther into the future than otherwise possible. Background Until the end of the 19th century, weather prediction was entirely subjective and based on empirical rules, with only limited understanding of the physical mechanisms behind weather processes. In 1901 Cleveland Abbe, founder of the United States Weather Bureau, proposed that the atmosphere is governed by the same principles of thermodynamics and hydrodynamics that were studied in the previous century. In 1904, Vilhelm Bjerknes derived a two-step procedure for model-based weather forecasting. First, a diagnostic step is used to process data to generate initial conditions, which are then advanced in time by a prognostic step that solves the initial value problem. He also identified seven variables that defined the state of the atmosphere at a given point: pressure, temperature, density, humidity, and the three components of the flow velocity vector. Bjerknes pointed out that equations based on mass continuity, conservation of momentum, the first and second laws of thermodynamics, and the ideal gas law could be used to estimate the state of the atmosphere in the future through numerical methods. With the exception of the second law of thermodynamics, these equations form the basis of the primitive equations used in present-day weather models. In 1922, Lewis Fry Richardson published the first attempt at forecasting the weather numerically. Using a hydrostatic variation of Bjerknes's primitive equations, Richardson produced by hand a 6-hour forecast for the state of the atmosphere over two points in central Europe, taking at least six weeks to do so. His forecast calculated that the change in surface pressure would be , an unrealistic value incorrect by two orders of magnitude. The large error was caused by an imbalance in the pressure and wind velocity fields used as the initial conditions in his analysis. The first successful numerical prediction was performed using the ENIAC digital computer in 1950 by a team composed of American meteorologists Jule Charney, Philip Thompson, Larry Gates, and Norwegian meteorologist Ragnar Fj√∏rtoft, applied mathematician John von Neumann, and computer programmer Klara Dan von Neumann. They used a simplified form of atmospheric dynamics based on solving the barotropic vorticity equation over a single layer of the atmosphere, by computing the geopotential height of the atmosphere's pressure surface. This simplification greatly reduced demands on computer time and memory, so the computations could be performed on the relatively primitive computers of the day. When news of the first weather forecast by ENIAC was received by Richardson in 1950, he remarked that the results were an \\"enormous scientific advance.\\" The first calculations for a 24‚Äëhour forecast took ENIAC nearly 24 hours to produce, but Charney's group noted that most of that time was spent in \\"manual operations\\", and expressed hope that forecasts of the weather before it occurs would soon be realized. mbar geopotential height prediction from a numerical weather prediction model. It also shows an Omega block. In the United Kingdom the Meteorological Office first numerical weather prediction was completed by F. H. Bushby and Mavis Hinds in 1952 under the guidance of John Sawyer. These experimental forecasts were generated using a 12 √ó 8 grid with a grid spacing of 260 km, a one-hour time-step, and required four hours of computing time for a 24-hour forecast on the EDSAC computer at the University of Cambridge and the LEO computer developed by J. Lyons and Co. Following these initial experiments, work moved to the Ferranti Mark 1 computer at the Manchester University Department of Electrical Engineering and in 1959 a Ferranti Mercury computer, known as 'Meteor', was installed at the Met Office. 30px This article contains quotations from this source, which is available under the Open Government Licence v3.0. ¬© Crown copyright. Early years In September 1954, Carl-Gustav Rossby assembled an international group of meteorologists in Stockholm and produced the first operational forecast (i.e. routine predictions for practical use) based on the barotropic equation. Operational numerical weather prediction in the United States began in 1955 under the Joint Numerical Weather Prediction Unit (JNWPU), a joint project by the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Weather Bureau. The JNWPU model was originally a three-layer barotropic model, also developed by Charney. It only modeled the atmosphere in the Northern Hemisphere. In 1956, the JNWPU switched to a two- layer thermotropic model developed by Thompson and Gates. The main assumption made by the thermotropic model is that while the magnitude of the thermal wind may change, its direction does not change with respect to height, and thus the baroclinicity in the atmosphere can be simulated using the and geopotential height surfaces and the average thermal wind between them. However, due to the low skill showed by the thermotropic model, the JNWPU reverted to the single- layer barotropic model in 1958. The Japanese Meteorological Agency became the third organization to initiate operational numerical weather prediction in 1959. The first real-time forecasts made by Australia's Bureau of Meteorology in 1969 for portions of the Southern Hemisphere were also based on the single- layer barotropic model. Later models used more complete equations for atmospheric dynamics and thermodynamics. In 1959, Karl-Heinz Hinkelmann produced the first reasonable primitive equation forecast, 37 years after Richardson's failed attempt. Hinkelmann did so by removing small oscillations from the numerical model during initialization. In 1966, West Germany and the United States began producing operational forecasts based on primitive- equation models, followed by the United Kingdom in 1972 and Australia in 1977. Later additions to primitive equation models allowed additional insight into different weather phenomena. In the United States, solar radiation effects were added to the primitive equation model in 1967; moisture effects and latent heat were added in 1968; and feedback effects from rain on convection were incorporated in 1971. Three years later, the first global forecast model was introduced. Sea ice began to be initialized in forecast models in 1971. Efforts to involve sea surface temperature in model initialization began in 1972 due to its role in modulating weather in higher latitudes of the Pacific. Global forecast models Models use systems of differential equations based on the laws of physics, fluid motion, and chemistry, and use a coordinate system which divides the planet into a 3D grid. Winds, heat transfer, radiation, relative humidity, and surface hydrology are calculated within each grid and evaluate interactions with neighboring points. A global forecast model is a weather forecasting model which initializes and forecasts the weather throughout the Earth's troposphere. It is a computer program that produces meteorological information for future times at given locations and altitudes. Within any modern model is a set of equations, known as the primitive equations, used to predict the future state of the atmosphere. These equations‚Äîalong with the ideal gas law‚Äîare used to evolve the density, pressure, and potential temperature scalar fields and the flow velocity vector field of the atmosphere through time. Additional transport equations for pollutants and other aerosols are included in some primitive-equation high- resolution models as well. The equations used are nonlinear partial differential equations which are impossible to solve exactly through analytical methods, with the exception of a few idealized cases. Therefore, numerical methods obtain approximate solutions. Different models use different solution methods: some global models and almost all regional models use finite difference methods for all three spatial dimensions, while other global models and a few regional models use spectral methods for the horizontal dimensions and finite-difference methods in the vertical. The National Meteorological Center's Global Spectral Model was introduced during August 1980. The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts model debuted on May 1, 1985. The United Kingdom Met Office has been running their global model since the late 1980s, adding a 3D-Var data assimilation scheme in mid-1999. The Canadian Meteorological Centre has been running a global model since 1991. The United States ran the Nested Grid Model (NGM) from 1987 to 2000, with some features lasting as late as 2009. Between 2000 and 2002, the Environmental Modeling Center ran the Aviation (AVN) model for shorter range forecasts and the Medium Range Forecast (MRF) model at longer time ranges. During this time, the AVN model was extended to the end of the forecast period, eliminating the need of the MRF and thereby replacing it. In late 2002, the AVN model was renamed the Global Forecast System (GFS). The German Weather Service has been running their global hydrostatic model, the GME, using a hexagonal icosahedral grid since 2002. The GFS is slated to eventually be supplanted by the Flow- following, finite-volume Icosahedral Model (FIM), which like the GME is gridded on a truncated icosahedron, in the mid-2010s. Global climate models In 1956, Norman A. Phillips developed a mathematical model which could realistically depict monthly and seasonal patterns in the troposphere, which became the first successful climate model. Following Phillips's work, several groups began working to create general circulation models. The first general circulation climate model that combined both oceanic and atmospheric processes was developed in the late 1960s at the NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory. By the early 1980s, the United States' National Center for Atmospheric Research had developed the Community Atmosphere Model; this model has been continuously refined into the 2000s. In 1986, efforts began to initialize and model soil and vegetation types, which led to more realistic forecasts. For example, the Center for Ocean-Land Atmosphere Studies (COLA) model showed a warm temperature bias of 2‚Äì4 ¬∞C (4‚Äì7 ¬∞F) and a low precipitation bias due to incorrect parameterization of crop and vegetation type across the central United States. Coupled ocean-atmosphere climate models such as the Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research's HadCM3 model are currently being used as inputs for climate change studies. The importance of gravity waves was neglected within these models until the mid-1980s. Now, gravity waves are required within global climate models in order to properly simulate regional and global scale circulations, though their broad spectrum makes their incorporation complicated. The Climate System Model (CSM) was developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in January 1994. Limited-area models The horizontal domain of a model is either global, covering the entire Earth, or regional, covering only part of the Earth. Regional models (also known as limited-area models, or LAMs) allow for the use of finer (or smaller) grid spacing than global models. The available computational resources are focused on a specific area instead of being spread over the globe. This allows regional models to resolve explicitly smaller- scale meteorological phenomena that cannot be represented on the coarser grid of a global model. Regional models use a global model for initial conditions of the edge of their domain in order to allow systems from outside the regional model domain to move into its area. Uncertainty and errors within regional models are introduced by the global model used for the boundary conditions of the edge of the regional model, as well as errors attributable to the regional model itself. In the United States, the first operational regional model, the limited-area fine-mesh (LFM) model, was introduced in 1971. Its development was halted, or frozen, in 1986. The NGM debuted in 1987 and was also used to create model output statistics for the United States.Explanation of Current NGM MOS. National Weather Service Meteorological Development Lab (1999). Retrieved 2010-05-15. Its development was frozen in 1991. The ETA model was implemented for the United States in 1993 and in turn was upgraded to the NAM in 2006. The U.S. also offers the Rapid Refresh (which replaced the RUC in 2012) for short-range and high-resolution applications; both the Rapid Refresh and NAM are built on the same framework, the WRF. Met√©o France has been running their Action de Recherche Petite √âchelle Grande √âchelle (ALADIN) mesoscale model for France, based upon the ECMWF global model, since 1995. In July 1996, the Bureau of Meteorology implemented the Limited Area Prediction System (LAPS). The Canadian Regional Finite-Elements model (RFE) went into operational use on April 22, 1986. It was followed by the Canadian Global Environmental Multiscale Model (GEM) mesoscale model on February 24, 1997. The German Weather Service developed the High Resolution Regional Model (HRM) in 1999, which is widely run within the operational and research meteorological communities and run with hydrostatic assumptions. The Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System (AMPS) was developed for the southernmost continent in 2000 by the United States Antarctic Program. The German non-hydrostatic Lokal-Modell for Europe (LME) has been run since 2002, and an increase in areal domain became operational on September 28, 2005. The Japanese Meteorological Agency has run a high-resolution, non-hydrostatic mesoscale model since September 2004. Air quality models Visualization of a buoyant Gaussian air pollutant dispersion plume The technical literature on air pollution dispersion is quite extensive and dates back to the 1930s and earlier. One of the early air pollutant plume dispersion equations was derived by Bosanquet and Pearson.Bosanquet, C. H. and Pearson, J. L., \\"The spread of smoke and gases from chimneys\\", Transactions of the Faraday Society, 32:1249, 1936 Their equation did not assume Gaussian distribution nor did it include the effect of ground reflection of the pollutant plume. Sir Graham Sutton derived an air pollutant plume dispersion equation in 1947 which did include the assumption of Gaussian distribution for the vertical and crosswind dispersion of the plume and also included the effect of ground reflection of the plume.Sutton, O. G., \\"The problem of diffusion in the lower atmosphere\\", Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, 73:257, 1947 and \\"The theoretical distribution of airborne pollution from factory chimneys\\", Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society, 73:426, 1947 Under the stimulus provided by the advent of stringent environmental control regulations, there was an immense growth in the use of air pollutant plume dispersion calculations between the late 1960s and today. A great many computer programs for calculating the dispersion of air pollutant emissions were developed during that period of time and they were called \\"air dispersion models\\". The basis for most of those models was the Complete Equation For Gaussian Dispersion Modeling Of Continuous, Buoyant Air Pollution Plumes The Gaussian air pollutant dispersion equation requires the input of H which is the pollutant plume's centerline height above ground level‚Äîand H is the sum of Hs (the actual physical height of the pollutant plume's emission source point) plus ŒîH (the plume rise due to the plume's buoyancy). To determine ŒîH, many if not most of the air dispersion models developed between the late 1960s and the early 2000s used what are known as \\"the Briggs equations.\\" G. A. Briggs first published his plume rise observations and comparisons in 1965.Briggs, G. A., \\"A plume rise model compared with observations\\", Journal of the Air Pollution Control Association, 15:433‚Äì438, 1965 In 1968, at a symposium sponsored by Conservation of Clean Air and Water in Europe, he compared many of the plume rise models then available in the literature.Briggs, G.A., \\"CONCAWE meeting: discussion of the comparative consequences of different plume rise formulas\\", Atmospheric Environment, 2:228‚Äì232, 1968 In that same year, Briggs also wrote the section of the publication edited by SladeSlade, D. H. (editor), \\"Meteorology and atomic energy 1968\\", Air Resources Laboratory, U.S. Dept. of Commerce, 1968 dealing with the comparative analyses of plume rise models. That was followed in 1969 by his classical critical review of the entire plume rise literature,Briggs, G. A., \\"Plume Rise\\", United States Army Environmental Command Critical Review Series, 1969 in which he proposed a set of plume rise equations which have become widely known as \\"the Briggs equations\\". Subsequently, Briggs modified his 1969 plume rise equations in 1971 and in 1972.Briggs, G. A., \\"Some recent analyses of plume rise observation\\", Proceedings of the Second International Clean Air Congress, Academic Press, New York, 1971Briggs, G. A., \\"Discussion: chimney plumes in neutral and stable surroundings\\", Atmospheric Environment, 6:507‚Äì510, 1972 The Urban Airshed Model, a regional forecast model for the effects of air pollution and acid rain, was developed by a private company in the US in 1970. Development of this model was taken over by the Environmental Protection Agency and improved in the mid to late 1970s using results from a regional air pollution study. While developed in California, this model was later used in other areas of North America, Europe and Asia during the 1980s. The Community Multiscale Air Quality model (CMAQ) is an open source air quality model run within the United States in conjunction with the NAM mesoscale model since 2004. The first operational air quality model in Canada, Canadian Hemispheric and Regional Ozone and NOx System (CHRONOS), began to be run in 2001. It was replaced with the Global Environmental Multiscale model ‚Äì Modelling Air quality and Chemistry (GEM-MACH) model in November 2009. Tropical cyclone models Top: WRF model simulation of Hurricane Rita tracks. Bottom: The spread of NHC multi-model ensemble forecast. During 1972, the first model to forecast storm surge along the continental shelf was developed, known as the Special Program to List the Amplitude of Surges from Hurricanes (SPLASH). In 1978, the first hurricane-tracking model based on atmospheric dynamics ‚Äì the movable fine-mesh (MFM) model ‚Äì began operating. Within the field of tropical cyclone track forecasting, despite the ever-improving dynamical model guidance which occurred with increased computational power, it was not until the decade of the 1980s when numerical weather prediction showed skill, and until the 1990s when it consistently outperformed statistical or simple dynamical models. In the early 1980s, the assimilation of satellite-derived winds from water vapor, infrared, and visible satellite imagery was found to improve tropical cyclones track forecasting. The Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) hurricane model was used for research purposes between 1973 and the mid-1980s. Once it was determined that it could show skill in hurricane prediction, a multi-year transition transformed the research model into an operational model which could be used by the National Weather Service in 1995. The Hurricane Weather Research and Forecasting (HWRF) model is a specialized version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and is used to forecast the track and intensity of tropical cyclones. The model was developed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, the University of Rhode Island, and Florida State University. It became operational in 2007. Despite improvements in track forecasting, predictions of the intensity of a tropical cyclone based on numerical weather prediction continue to be a challenge, since statiscal methods continue to show higher skill over dynamical guidance. Ocean models The first ocean wave models were developed in the 1960s and 1970s. These models had the tendency to overestimate the role of wind in wave development and underplayed wave interactions. A lack of knowledge concerning how waves interacted among each other, assumptions regarding a maximum wave height, and deficiencies in computer power limited the performance of the models. After experiments were performed in 1968, 1969, and 1973, wind input from the Earth's atmosphere was weighted more accurately in the predictions. A second generation of models was developed in the 1980s, but they could not realistically model swell nor depict wind-driven waves (also known as wind waves) caused by rapidly changing wind fields, such as those within tropical cyclones. This caused the development of a third generation of wave models from 1988 onward. Within this third generation of models, the spectral wave transport equation is used to describe the change in wave spectrum over changing topography. It simulates wave generation, wave movement (propagation within a fluid), wave shoaling, refraction, energy transfer between waves, and wave dissipation. Since surface winds are the primary forcing mechanism in the spectral wave transport equation, ocean wave models use information produced by numerical weather prediction models as inputs to determine how much energy is transferred from the atmosphere into the layer at the surface of the ocean. Along with dissipation of energy through whitecaps and resonance between waves, surface winds from numerical weather models allow for more accurate predictions of the state of the sea surface. Model output statistics Because forecast models based upon the equations for atmospheric dynamics do not perfectly determine weather conditions near the ground, statistical corrections were developed to attempt to resolve this problem. Statistical models were created based upon the three-dimensional fields produced by numerical weather models, surface observations, and the climatological conditions for specific locations. These statistical models are collectively referred to as model output statistics (MOS), and were developed by the National Weather Service for their suite of weather forecasting models by 1976. The United States Air Force developed its own set of MOS based upon their dynamical weather model by 1983. Ensembles As proposed by Edward Lorenz in 1963, it is impossible for long-range forecasts‚Äîthose made more than two weeks in advance‚Äîto predict the state of the atmosphere with any degree of skill, owing to the chaotic nature of the fluid dynamics equations involved. Extremely small errors in temperature, winds, or other initial inputs given to numerical models will amplify and double every five days. Furthermore, existing observation networks have limited spatial and temporal resolution (for example, over large bodies of water such as the Pacific Ocean), which introduces uncertainty into the true initial state of the atmosphere. While a set of equations, known as the Liouville equations, exists to determine the initial uncertainty in the model initialization, the equations are too complex to run in real-time, even with the use of supercomputers. These uncertainties limit forecast model accuracy to about six days into the future.Weickmann, Klaus, Jeff Whitaker, Andres Roubicek and Catherine Smith (2001-12-01). The Use of Ensemble Forecasts to Produce Improved Medium Range (3‚Äì15 days) Weather Forecasts. Climate Diagnostics Center. Retrieved 2007-02-16. Edward Epstein recognized in 1969 that the atmosphere could not be completely described with a single forecast run due to inherent uncertainty, and proposed a stochastic dynamic model that produced means and variances for the state of the atmosphere. While these Monte Carlo simulations showed skill, in 1974 Cecil Leith revealed that they produced adequate forecasts only when the ensemble probability distribution was a representative sample of the probability distribution in the atmosphere. It was not until 1992 that ensemble forecasts began being prepared by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, the Canadian Meteorological Centre, and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction. The ECMWF model, the Ensemble Prediction System, uses singular vectors to simulate the initial probability density, while the NCEP ensemble, the Global Ensemble Forecasting System, uses a technique known as vector breeding.

History The magazine originally launched as Asia Property Report, a bi-monthly 16-page staple bound publication with a newspaper style layout aimed at the real estate industry throughout Asia. Within two issues, the title changed to Thailand Property Report and the readership focus shifted to investors as the company's expatriate British founders, Terry Blackburn and Duncan Worthington, sought to capitalize on interest in the booming resort and luxury condominium real estate market in Thailand at the time. The local property market had remained stagnant since the Asian financial crisis in 1998, but went through a period of unprecedented growth between 2004‚Äì2008. During this time, the magazine grew to be a 126-page, perfect bound publication, became the best selling real estate magazine in the country and expanded its distribution to Hong Kong and Singapore, to take advantage of local interest in luxury Thai property. Due to local publication licensing laws the magazine was renamed Property Report Thailand in 2006. In 2007, Ensign Media opened an office in Singapore in order to launch a sister magazine to Property Report Thailand, Property Report Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia. The publication's primary areas of focus were Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Bali, Penang and Jakarta. Whilst the publisher reported strong subscriber numbers and newsstand sales, the magazine never attracted the same number of advertising pages as Property Report Thailand, meaning its page count was always around 50% of its more established sibling publication. Plans to launch a Singapore Property Awards were announced but then shelved during the financial crisis of 2008. In June 2010, Ensign merged Property Report Thailand and Property Report Singapore, Malaysia Indonesia into a single publication, Property Report South East Asia. The magazine was distributed in five countries: Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and Hong Kong with a claimed circulation of 25,000 copies and was South East Asia‚Äôs only monthly real estate publication. Its editor in chief was UK national Andrew Batt, who was previously managing editor of Bloomberg Businessweek Thailand.Editorial Team Property Report.com In 2005, propertyreport.com was launched under the original magazine branding of Asia Property Report Online and widened the editorial reach of the magazine to cover residential real estate throughout Asia, as well as carrying property and business listings. The website's most recent redesign was in July 2010, when it scrapped many of its superfluous sections and features to become more opinion, analysis and feature focused, and debuted a new property search engine and villa rental section. Thailand Property Awards In 2006, Ensign held the inaugural Thailand Property Awards, to recognize achievements in residential real estate. In order to avoid accusations of favoritism towards advertisers, the organizers used a panel of independent judges and monitoring of the processCNN Go by auditing firm BDO AdvisoryBDO Thai Tax Whilst this occasionally produced controversial results, the awards continued to grow over the years and attracted over 500 attendees to the November 2010 gala dinner and considerable local and international media coverage for winnersBangkok Post In November 2010, Ensign Media announced plans for the South East Asia Property Awards to be held in Singapore in 2011.Ensign Media Distribution Property Report is available for sale in major English language bookstores throughout Thailand, including Asia Books, Kinokuniya and Bookazine.

History  QEH was founded as a result of a gift of ¬£100,000 given by Sir Ernest Oppenheimer to the University of Oxford.Queen Elizabeth House, Oxford University Archives The donation was for the development of colonial studies and the establishment of an associated colonial centre. A further gift of ¬£50,000 was given by the Colonial Development and Welfare Fund of the British government. QEH was constituted by Royal Charter in 1954 to provide a residential centre which people concerned with the study of Commonwealth affairs could visit to make contacts and exchange ideas. In the 1980s there was a drive to reshape QEH as a centre for international studies, rather than purely for study concerning the Commonwealth. In 1986 it was merged with the Institute of Commonwealth Studies, Oxford and the Oxford University Institute of Agricultural Economics to create the International Development Centre, a department of the University within the Social Studies Faculty. From 1958 to 2005 QEH was located at 20-21 St Giles. In 2005, the department moved to the former School of Geography building in Mansfield Road and became known as the Oxford Department of International Development. In 2011 the Palace authorised the use of the name Queen Elizabeth House for the buildings at 3 Mansfield Road.  Courses  The Department provides postgraduate research training (DPhil and MPhil) and four MSc taught courses to some 200 students.

The application is designed to improve text entry on mobile devices by making it faster and error-free. It achieves this by predicting the next word as well as the word being typed, continuously adapting to the user's writing-style and vocabulary. History and product features Launched in 2006, Adaptxt supported Windows Mobile smartphones only. Adaptxt provides features such as context-based next- word suggestions, word completion, personal dictionary, dynamic language detection, conversion from SMS language to standard English and vice versa, multilingual text entry and a feature that learns new words and context while typing. The application stores the new words in the user‚Äôs personal dictionary, where they can be edited. KeyPoint also claims that Adaptxt users can type in any of the installed languages without changing their keyboard language or dictionary, thanks to an engine capable of recognizing the language in use. This feature is supposed to be an added value for users who are bi-lingual or occasionally type in a foreign language. A version for Symbian S60 smartphones was released in 2008, with improved support for third- party applications. In April 2009, KeyPoint introduced a feature to scan personal data, including calendar entries, phonebook contacts, SMS and email inbox and sent items. The ‚ÄúScan Facebook‚Äù feature learns words from the user‚Äôs Facebook profile. The new words learnt are added to the personal dictionary and offered as suggestions during text entry. Later that year, KeyPoint also launched a new version of Adaptxt with error correction. This feature provides alternative suggestions for incorrect spellings. Automated correction of spelling mistakes were also made available, with an option to revert to the exact word entered by the user in case of unwanted corrections. All these features can now be found in the Symbian version of the product and most of them can also be found in the Windows Mobile version. KeyPoint was also the first software company to introduce professional add-on dictionaries that provide industry-specific word and phrase suggestions related to a particular profession, such as medicine, law, IT and telecommunications, business and finance.

Riffard, Nouveau dictionnaire de l'√©sot√©risme, Paris: Payot, 2008, 96. As regards form, esotericists have a secret: paralipsis (apophasis). They purport to say nothing, while at the same time discreetly revealing something (In saying \\"I will say nothing about the sacred nature of sexuality\\", I have said that sexuality does indeed have a sacred nature). For example, symbols such as the apple or the coiled serpent reveal numerous clues or keys to sexuality, while simultaneously appearing to obfuscate the discourse or image. As regards content, esotericists have another secret: reversion. They reverse ordinary ideas, they turn around commonplace behaviour, they overturn shared emotions, to return to the original. For example, kundalini yoga sends sexual energy up to the brain, and the alchemist returns to primary matter, when everything becomes possible and powerful again. As regards sense, esotericists have no secrets; they just adopt a lifestyle, one which gives priority to the interior of things. For example, in love they prefer a state of consciousness higher than sexual pleasure; in alchemy they are more interested in the solar image of gold than its market value. \\"Riffard's approach may thus be characterized as universalist, religionistic, and trans-historical: Esotericism is a basic 'anthropological structure' and as such not dependent on cultural mediation. Its scope in time and space includes the whole of human history.\\" -Wouter J. Hanegraaff.Wouter J. Hanegraaff, \\"On the Construction of Esoteric Traditions\\", in Antoine Faivre and Wouter J.

Riffard, Les philosophes: vie intime, Paris: Presses Universitaires de France (PUF), 2004, 33-232. # a handicap: being female. Only one woman philosopher (Hannah Arendt) featured on an official list of 305 classical philosophers compiled in 1991. # an opportunity: being an expatriate. More than 13% of philosophers are born outside their parent's home country, in the colonies. More than 54% of philosophers have lived abroad. Aristotle was born in Macedonia. Descartes spent 20 years in Holland. # an advantage: being an orphan. 68% of major philosophers are orphaned by the age of five. # no precociousness. As a statistical average, the first work is published at the age of 27, the masterpiece at the age of 42. Kant was already 57 years old when he published his masterpiece, The Critique of Pure Reason # acceptance of the culturally dominant language. It is necessary to speak a scholarly language. 23% of major philosophers have written Latin (until 1905 in France), 21% Greek and French, 13% English (this is becoming the dominant language). # rejection of the ideologically dominant religion. One enters philosophy in the same way that one enters the Mafia, by committing an assassination, of the God of the time, the beliefs of the time. The major philosophers are 51% Christian, 27% without religion and 19% pagan. # clumsiness in matters of the heart. The glories of love are not on the agenda for philosophers (apart from Auguste Comte). Giordano Bruno: \\"Truly, with respect to that sex [the female sex], what I abominate is that zealous and disordered venereal love which some are accustomed to expend for it, so that they come to the point of making their wit the slave of woman, and of degrading the noblest powers and actions of the intellectual soul.\\"Giordano Bruno, The Heroic Frenzies (1585), argument. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1964. # the risk of madness. A good philosopher keeps his insanity in check: Heraclitus' melancholia, Auguste Comte's manic-depression, Hegel's anxiety, Jean-Jacques Rousseau's paranoia, Nietzsche's syphilitic meningoencephalitis, etc. # triumph over illness. Many philosophers suffer, but overcome, whether it be nephritis (Epicurus), kidney stones (Montaigne), paralysis (Blaise Pascal, Feyerabend), poor eyesight (Democritus, Plotinus, Condillac, Cournot, Gonseth), etc. # obscure identities. Philosophers play around a lot with pen names, anonymity, etc. Descartes and Kierkegaard advance in disguise. # a mixed bag of curriculum vitae. 43,7% of philosophers have been teachers, the rest have been members of the clergy (20,9%), politicians (9,3%), without profession (4,9%), doctors (4%), lawyers or jurists (3,1%), editors or journalists (3,1%), none or almost none have been artisans (Henry David Thoreau), farmers (Gustave Thibon) or sailors (Michel Serres). # feet! Aristotelian = œÄŒµœÅŒπœÄŒ±œÑŒ∑œÑŒπŒ∫œåœÇ, peripatetic = \\"walking\\". Nietzsche: \\"All truly great thoughts are conceived while walking.\\"Nietzsche, Twilight of the Idols (1888), I, 34. # and, of course, a head (one head or two, or three, if the philosopher changes philosophy, like Schelling, Wittgenstein, Carnap). A major philosopher shows themselves to the world as such thanks to their vast personal semantic memory and a universal metaphysical obsession. About Leibniz, we know that \\"his memory was so strong, that in order to fix anything in it, he had no more to do but to write it once\\", and he was obsessed by harmony. :\\"Philosophy is like a nutcracker. There are some who merely end up pinching their fingers in it, professionals who are completely comfortable using it, and then there are people who use it to open those marvellous nuts called thoughts. To philosophise is good; to philosophise oneself is better. To philosophise oneself each day, on the routine, the commonplace, is best.\\"P. Riffard, Philosophie matin, midi et soir, Paris: Presses Universitaires de France (PUF), 2006, 177. \\"Pierre Riffard's vision of philosophy is that of a being torn between opposing demands: analysis and synthesis, the singular and the universal, certainty and doubt.\\" (\\"La vision qu'a Pierre Riffard du philosophe est celle d'un √™tre tiraill√© par des sollicitations contraires : analyse et synth√®se, le singulier et l'universel, certitude et doute.\\") -Thomas R√©gnier.Thomas R√©gnier, \\"Un essai de Pierre Riffard. La philomafia\\", Paris: Le Nouvel Observateur, n¬∞ 2228, 1-7 avril 2004, 108.  Thanatology  Thanatology is the study of death among human beings. ¬´ Female Skeleton Anatomy ¬ª. Bernhard Ungerer, 2008 Raising the issue of the afterlife is no plain matter, something like ‚ÄúI believe in Paradise‚Äù. It actually is a speculative strategy, a rational reckoning, combining several concepts and requiring a number of successive choices.Pierre A. Riffard, ¬´ Comment se pose rationnellement la question de la vie apr√®s la mort ¬ª, Thanatologie, Paris: Soci√©t√© de thanatologie, 87/88 (1991), 99-108 ; ¬´ Vie apr√®s la mort ¬ª, in Philippe Di Folco (dir.), Dictionnaire de la mort, Paris: Larousse, 2010, 1075-1078. It looks like a decision tree! As for the afterlife itself, several problems arise. First of all, problems of method. decision tree 1 ‚Äì Is it possible to ascertain whether there is an afterlife (or life after death) : yes (1a), maybe (1b), no (1c) ? 2 ‚Äì Where is documentation to be found? 3 ‚Äì What is to be considered as suitable evidence? Next come the philosophical queries. A - Should one negate (A1) or assert (A2) or suspend one‚Äôs opinion (A3) on the afterlife ? B ‚Äì Who survives : a single individual (B1), an elite (B2), a community (B3), Humanity (B4), the World (B5) ? C - What survives : the soul (C1), a soul, the mind, the Self... ? D- Under what shape : some specific element in the individual, some universal element... ? E ‚Äì Since when : the death of the individual, Doomsday... ? F ‚Äì Over what span of time : eternity ? G ‚Äì What type of time : cyclical, over an evolutionary period... ? H ‚Äì Where : a subterranean place, Heaven... ? I ‚Äì Following which law : God‚Äôs Will, Chance, One‚Äôs karma... ? J ‚Äì What types of survival : reincarnation, resurrection... ? K ‚Äì to what ultimate end : fusing into God, dissolution of the Self... ? The Christian view of life after death is a combination of assertions : \\"the afterlife is a fact\\"(A2), humanity is concerned (B4), spiritualism (C1), Doomsday (E2)... and resurrection Skepticism and scientism bring reflection to an abrupt ending through the suspension of judgment (A3), it agrees with Wilder Penfield‚Äôs words : \\"Whether energy can come to the mind of man from an outside source after his death is for each individual to decide for himself. Science has no such answer\\" (The Mystery of the Mind, 1976). All things considered, about a dozen ascertained types of survival are possible; they may either co-exist or follow one another and may vary according to the individuals, the souls, the actions. The history of religions mainly highlights a few types : neutral form of life (ex : the limbo in the Roman Catholic faith), shadow existence (Homer and the Ancient Jews), demonic life, damnation or salvation, migration of the souls through metempsychosis (whether the soul takes the shape of an animal or a plant or a human being) or reincarnation (in the human body's shape), catasterisation (transfer of the souls to the stars), palingenesis (one does not die but undergoes some transformation, just like mould turning into fungi), eternal return (all souls living through the same experiences again, thousands of years later, through cosmic palingenesis). * \\"La mort selon Leibniz\\", Paris: Thanatologie, n¬∞ 83-84, 1990.

One of his close lifelong friends from the class of 1936 at BC was Tip O'Neil, future Congressman from Massachusetts and Speaker of the US House of Representatives. Upon graduation, Moore reported to Naval Air Station Pensacola for flight training and was commissioned Ensign, USNR and designated a Naval Aviator on August 1, 1938.1938 Flight Jacket Yearbook - Aviation Cadet Battalion - US Naval Air Station - Pensacola, FL Early naval career Ensign Moore VF-5 USS Yorktown (CV-5) In September 1938, Ensign Moore joined Fighting Squadron Five (VF-5) on board the operating out of NAS North Island in San Diego, California. Ensign Moore flew off Yorktown from September 1938 thru September 1940. The primary aircraft flown by VF-5 in the late 1930s was the Grumman F3F, the last American biplane fighter aircraft.Navy Department Bureau of Naval Personnel, Washington, D.C. Records archived at the National Personnel Records Center, (Military Personnel Records), 9700 Page Avenue, St. Louis, MO 63132-5100 During his assignment to VF5 and Yorktown on the West Coast, in December 1939, now Lieutenant (junior grade) Moore took leave to travel back to Boston to marry his longtime sweetheart, Catherine Mary Donovan from Dorchester, Boston, Massachusetts. They were married on December 26, 1939, at Saint Ambrose Church in Dorchester followed by a reception at the Copely Plaza in Copley Square in downtown Boston. In May 1940, Moore was promoted to lieutenant. In October 1940, Moore was transferred back to NAS Pensacola as executive officer of the naval flight school. As the nations of the world moved toward World War II, Naval Air Station Pensacola once again became the hub of air training activities, training 1,100 cadets a month or 13,220 annually. Lieutenant Moore played a key role in making this massive ramp up in naval aviators to become known as one of 'the wonders of the modern world'.Quote from Senator Ralph Owen Brewster [R-Maine](February 22, 1888 - December 25, 1961) World War II Lieutenant Moore on USS Yorktown (CV-10) In March 1943, Lieutenant Moore moved to Pearl Harbor to meet with Fighter Squadron 1 and later that summer VF1 joined the new . The VF-1 squadron was established in March 1943, operating Grumman F6F Hellcats and was assigned to the United States Pacific Fleet to participate in numerous missions during World War II. With Lieutenant Moore as the executive officer, VF1 first fought the Japanese at the Battle of Tarawa, flying off from November 20 to November 22, 1943. The VF-1 squadron flew a total of 106 missions and spent 237 hours of flying time in three days of operations without losing a single plane or pilot. F6F-3 Hellcat on flight deck USS Yorktown (CV-10) 1943 Fighter Squadron 1 continued fighting off Yorktown with their Grumman F6F Hellcat aircraft in the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign, Marianas, Bonin Islands, and Caroline Islands.Samuel Eliot Morison, History of United States Naval Operations in World War II, Vol. 7; Aleutians, Gilberts and Marshalls: June 1942‚ÄìApril 1944, (Edison, NJ: Castle Books, 2001). The squadron was both land based and carrier based and it did night fighting, day fighting, bombing, and escort work. Over a fifteen-month period, VF1 attacked the Imperial Japanese Navy, sank 8 ships and damaged 16. It destroyed 102 airborne enemy planes plus 20 probables while losing only 5 in aerial combat. VF1 also ruined 61 enemy planes on the ground, silenced 46 A-A batteries, and blew up or burned 10 fuel or ammunition dumps. In June 1943, Moore transferred from the USNR to USN. Lieutenant Moore reported aboard in March 1944 as the commanding officer (CO) of Air Group 35. Chenango arrived at Espiritu Santo in April 1944 and sortied for the landings at Aitape and Hollandia and then joined the invasion of the Marianas. Air Group 35 crippled airfield installations, sank enemy shipping, and hammered harbor facilities on Pagan Island, as well as conducting valuable photographic reconnaissance on Guam. In May 1944, Moore was promoted to lieutenant commander. AG 35 on flight deck of USS Chenango In June 1944, launching 32 planes in the attack on Pagan Island, Air Group 35 absolutely crippled Japanese airfield installations there, and shot up gun positions and personnel. At the Battle of Guam (1944), AG35 dropped 74 tons of bombs, destroying many Japanese gun emplacements, troop concentrations, bridges, and truck convoys. A desperately needed Japanese ammunition storage dump exploded with spectacular violence. In October 1944, Chenango Hellcats conducted softening up strikes on Leyte in preparation for the invasion landings at the Battle of Leyte Gulf. Air Group 35 shot down 93 Japanese planes and sunk or destroyed 91 ships. AG35 lost only five pilots. Throughout its thirteen months of flying through the fiercest kind of anti-aircraft fire, Air Group 35 flew 4,644 sorties in combat zones and not one enemy plane or submarine succeeded in damaging the US surface vessels that AG35 was covering.Gene R.

The first deployment for Moore after he took command was to sail to the Caribbean Sea in December 1962 to conduct flight operations off the coast of Cuba. Although the flash points of the Cuban Missile Crisis had cooled a month earlier, the United States wanted to maintain a presence in the area until all of the Soviet Union missile sites were fully dismantled. This was called the Cuban Quarantine Operation. In late 1962, Saratoga remained \\"on the line\\" in the waters off Cuba. During this time, a Russian ship was spotted moving toward Cuba ‚Äì and the embargo line where it would turn back or be challenged by American ships. Saratoga crew scrambled to battle stations as general quarters was ordered by Moore. The fighter jets on the flight deck readied for launch. [Moore was about to be tested in a potentially large-scale international incident and he wasn't about to back down.] The Russian ship quickly turned around and sailed away. Although the crisis ended in late December 1962, the American ships, including Saratoga, remained in the area through the winter. Saratoga received an Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for the 3‚Äì20 December 1962 period that she was \\"on-line\\" in the waters off Cuba.Stahura, Barbara, USS Saratoga CV-3 & CVA/CV-60, page 49, Page 130, Turner Publishing Company, Captain Moore on USS Saratoga bridge Saratoga deployed to the Mediterranean Sea from March 1963 through October 1963. When not conducting flight operations underway, Saratoga entered several ports on the mission of goodwill ambassador for the United States. Ports visited were: Marseille; Barcelona; Cannes; Naples; Athens; Taranto; Genoa; Istanbul; Palma de Mallorca; Palermo; Venice; Capri; and Gibraltar. While operating in the Mediterranean Sea off the coast of France, a Grumman E-1 Tracer landed on the deck of Saratoga, logging the carrier's 69,000th arrested landing. Later on the cruise, the 72,000th arrested landing was made with a Douglas A-1 Skyraider off the coast of Italy. Newest addition to the ‚ÄúTen Thousand Trap Club‚Äù was Moore, who was credited with 10,000 arrested landings when a McDonnell F3H Demon landed on the carrier in the Mediterranean. Yet another milestone was reached on the 1963 cruise with the 76,000th landing aboard Saratoga.Naval Aviation News - Department of the Navy - Naval History & Heritage Command - Naval Warfare Division - back issues (March 1963 - November 1963) Late naval career October 1963 ‚Äì January 1965 ‚Äì Chief of Staff - Carrier Division Six- and ‚Äì Mayport, FL In September 1964, Moore, aboard in the Norwegian Sea, quarterbacked the NATO Strike Force in exercise \\"Teamwork\\". There were scores of NATO cruisers, destroyers and carriers, including the world's largest cruiser . Russia had injected operational reality into the war games. Moore had to contend with Soviet destroyers and planes taking position among and over the NATO fleet. Moore was Chief of Staff to Rear Admiral Robert L. Townsend, Commander of NATO Carrier Strike Forces - Atlantic and commander of Carrier Division Six. Moore called the plays from the bridge of USS Independence and this was the first time that Soviet air and sea forces had observed carrier striking forces in simulated actions. He was convinced that such actions as the Tonkin Gulf assault on North Vietnam and the Cuban Blockade in late 1962, in which Moore commanded Saratoga, had created newborn respect by Russia for US aircraft carrier power. Moore disclosed that every Soviet plane approaching the fleet on daily incursions had been detected and intercepted by his jet fighters. In real warfare, the American jets could have destroyed the Soviet invaders more than 100 miles away before they could attack the NATO fleet.Edward G.

William Wordsworth, engraved mechanically by Achille Collas after a medallion by Henry Weekes, from the 1838 book The authors of England by Henry Fothergill Chorley. Achille Collas (1795-1859) was a French engineer, inventor, writer and engraver who developed a way of mechanically creating engravings after medallions and other reliefs, and a machine to copy sculptures at a smaller scale, the so-called \\"r√©duction m√©chanique\\", which popularized small sculptures and has been credited with being almost entirely responsible for \\"the transformation of the bronze industry\\". Achille Collas was born in Paris in 1795. He worked as an engineer before joining the Army at the end of the First French Empire. Afterwards he worked as a toolmaker and inventor. He never married. He applied for many patents, most of them for long-forgotten inventions for buckle-making machines and other tools. His most successful inventions had to do with the reproduction of 3D artworks in 2D and 3D. He produced the illustrations for The authors of England: A series of medallion portraits of modern literary characters, engraved from the works of British artists by Henry Fothergill Chorley from 1838: this work contains a ten-page introduction outlining the new procedure of mechanically creating engravings from cameos and medals, developed by Collas. He developed this method between 1825 and 1832, demonstrating it at the Salon of 1833. Using this procedure, he created the Tr√©sor de numismatique et glyptique. When it was finished in 1850, it reproduced some 15,000 items, spread over 20 volumes. His second great invention came in 1836, when he produced a pantograph-like machine to reproduce sculptures in different scales and materials. In 1838, he started a company together with Ferdinand Barbedienne, the \\"Soci√©t√© Collas et Barbedienne\\", for the production and marketing of reduced copies of sculptures in different materials ranging from plaster and wood to bronze and ivory. The first product of the company was a reproduction of the Venus of Milo, but for the next ten years nothing much happened, until Barbedienne sent some pieces to The Great Exhibition of 1851, where the company received a special medal. Further success came in 1855, when Collas was awarded the Grand M√©daille d'Honneur of the Exposition Universelle in Paris. By the time of Barbedienne's death in 1892 the company had some 600 employees. It existed until 1954.

It deals in plant engineering in oil and gas, chemicals and petrochemicals, in green chemistry and in technology supporting energy transition. Maire Tecnimont manages large turnkey licensing, engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) projects in different geographical areas. It operates in over 45 countries in four continents through a staff of around 6,300 employees. In November 2007 it was listed on the Milan Stock Exchange in the FTSE Italia Mid Cap index. History =Origins= Fiat Engineering S.p.A. was set up in the 1930s under the name \\"Servizio Costruzioni e Impianti Fiat S.A.\\", as part of the Fiat Group, for the design and construction of equipment for the manufacture of cars. Subsequently, it specialised in the production of cogeneration and combined cycle plants both in Italy and abroad, with a particular focus on the Middle East and Latin America. In 1972, this branch of the business (\\"Servizio Costruzioni e Impianti Fiat S.A.\\") was made into a separate company and incorporated into a new company, \\"Fiat Engineering S.p.A.\\".Maire Tecnimont, Strong fundamentals, low rating, Initiate with a 1-Overweight recommendation, Lehman Brothers, 11 January 2008 It later extended its scope of operation in the transport infrastructure sector to include the design of high-speed railway lines and innovative underground railway systems. Tecnimont S.p.A. was set up by Montedison in 1973 in order to combine the specialist skills of the Engineering and Development departments of Montecatini and Edison, two big names of Italian industry. Montecatini brought the legacy of Giulio Natta (winner of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry in 1963) and its specialism in the production of polyolefin plants, while Edison had been active in energy production since the 19th century. =Launch of the Maire Tecnimont Group= In 2004, Maire Holding acquired Fiat Engineering (later Maire Engineering). Maire Tecnimont was formed in 2005 by Maire Holding's acquisition of Tecnimont. On 27 November 2007, Maire Tecnimont commenced trading on the Milan Stock Exchange by IPO. On 25 March 2008, the company was admitted to the blue chip market of the Italian stock exchange. On 2 August 2010, the company signed a lease contract for two Garibaldi Towers in Milan. Both towers have been renovated. =Acquisitions= In 2008, the Group finalised the acquisition of the entire share capital of :it:Tecnimont ICB Pvt. Ltd. (TICB), a leading Indian engineering services company which was set up by the Kapadia family in 1958. Tecnimont had already acquired a 25% stake in the company in 1996, before acquiring another 25% stake, taking it to 50% ownership in 2000. This acquisition opened up new scope for growth in the Asian market, consolidating the group‚Äôs already well-established presence in the Country. The Group has had a presence in India since the 1930s through Tecnimont. Over the last 50 years, it has set up over 20 fertiliser plants and 40 process units. Also in 2008, the Group acquired Noy Engineering, in order to expand its technological portfolio. The company is specialized in the design and supply of plants for the production of PET polyester and resin, nylon and acrylic fibres. Active in the chemicals and textiles sectors since 1980, Noy has diversified its expertise around the world and invested in new areas of production. In 2009, Maire Tecnimont‚Äôs acquisition of Stamicarbon allowed it to combine its traditional EPC activities with technology licensing services. The Dutch company was set up in the 1940s as the licensing company of DSM (Dutch State Mines), selling licenses for coal washing plants. It entered the chemicals sector in the 1950s, offering licensing services for urea processes. This became Stamicarbon's main focus area, particularly towards the end of the 1980s, when DSM decided to close its Mining Technology Department. Over the years, Stamicarbon established itself and consolidated a position of global leadership in technology design and innovation in the field of urea production. Thanks to the acquisition of Stamicarbon, Maire Tecnimont was one of the finalists in the ‚ÄúBest foreign acquisition by an Italian company‚Äù category at KPMG‚Äôs 2010 M&A; Awards. Also in 2009, the Group entered the renewable energy industry with the creation of a new company, Met NewEn, which operates in the biomass and concentrated solar power sector. In 2010, Maire Tecnimont acquired Technip KTI SpA (TKTI) through the acquisition of a parent company: Sofipart Srl. Technip KTI, later renamed KT, was set up 40 years ago as a contractor working on the design and production of industrial furnaces, operating under the name Selas Italia. Since then, it became the world‚Äôs leading company in the design and construction of hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, ethylene and sulphur plants. In 1974, Selas Italia changed its name to KTI (Kinetics Technology International) and was acquired by the German company Mannesmann Anlagenbau in 1988. In 1999, it became part of Technip Italy. Thanks to the acquisition of KT, Maire Tecnimont won the ‚ÄúBest acquisition in Italy‚Äù award at KPMG‚Äôs 2011 M&A; Awards. =Creation of Tecnimont CC= In the first half of 2011, Maire Tecnimont created a new company named Tecnimont Civil Construction (TCC) with the aim of developing its business activities in the infrastructure sector. The objective is to synergistically boost the Group's expertise in the infrastructure and civil engineering sectors and to improve performance and profitability. =Digitalisation and green chemistry= In 2016, Maire Tecnimont launched a new phase to bring about the digital transformation of its production processes and to open up to new business areas, such as renewable energy and green chemistry. Based on this new business direction, in November 2018 Maire Tecnimont set up NextChem, a new company of the Group which would oversee green chemistry projects and projects focusing on energy transition. Among these, the construction of plants for the mechanical recycling of plastic, such as the one in Bedizzole (Brescia). In July 2019, Stamicarbon ‚Äì a Maire Tecnimont Group company ‚Äì acquired the Dutch IT company Protomation in order to continue its process of business digitalisation. Activities In 2019, the company's activity was 95.5% in Hydrocarbons and 4.5% in Green Energy. The business activities are geographically located: * 4.6% in Italy, * 21.3% in other European Union countries, * 42.2% in other European countries, * 6.8% in the Middle East, * 13.1% in the Americas (North, Central and South), * 10.5% Africa, * 1.5% Asia.

As the legal regime for bankruptcy in the United States developed, it moved from a system which viewed bankruptcy as a quasi-criminal act, to one focused on solving and repaying debts for people and businesses suffering heavy losses. Pre- Independence In the Thirteen Colonies, laws regarding the payment and collection of debt were based on English common law. Debtors who were unable to repay their debts had property confiscated and assigned to the creditor, or were imprisoned.Noel 1919, 35-36. Eighteenth and nineteenth centuries Upon the ratification of the United States Constitution in 1789, Congress was given the power under Article I, Section 8, Clause 4 to legislate for \\"uniform laws on the subject of Bankruptcies\\" throughout the United States. Congress' first law on the subject was the Bankruptcy Act of 1800,Ch. 19, 2 Stat. 19 (repealed by Ch. 6, 2 Stat. 248). See David A. Skeel, Jr., Bankruptcy Lawyers and the Shape of American Bankruptcy Law, 67 Fordham L.R. 497. which was limited to traders and provided only for involuntary proceedings. This was repealed in 1803. Diplomatist Edmund Roberts, President Andrew Jackson's envoy to the Far East, incorporated American concepts of bankruptcy protection into Article VI of the Roberts Treaty with Siam of 1833. Voluntary bankruptcy in the United States was first allowed by the Acts of 1841,Act of Aug. 19, 1841, section 1, 5 Stat. 440 and 1867.Act of Mar. 2, 1867, section 11, 14 Stat. 521, amended in 1874, 18 Stat. 182 and repealed in 1878. These early acts and the Bankruptcy Act of 1898, known as the Nelson Act,Act of July 1, 1898, ch. 541, 30 Stat. 544. established the modern concepts of debtor-creditor relations. Twentieth century The Bankruptcy Act of 1938, known as the Chandler Act expanded voluntary access to the bankruptcy system, and voluntary petitions were made more attractive to debtors. The Chandler Act gave authority to the Securities and Exchange Commission in the administration of bankruptcy filings. The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, commonly referred to as the Bankruptcy Code, constituted a major overhaul of the bankruptcy system. First, it covered cases filed after October 1, 1979. Second, the 1978 Act contained four titles. Title I was the amended Title 11 of the U.S. Code. Title II contained amendments to Title 28 of the U.S. Code and the Federal Rules of Evidence. Title III made the necessary changes in other federal legislation affected by the bankruptcy law changes. Title IV provided for the repeal of pre-Code bankruptcy, the effective dates of portions of the new law, necessary savings provisions, interim housekeeping details, and the pilot program of the United States trustee. Perhaps the most important changes to bankruptcy law under the 1978 Act, however, were to the courts themselves. The 1978 Act drastically altered the structure of the bankruptcy courts and conferred pervasive subject matter jurisdiction upon the courts. The act granted the new jurisdiction over all \\"civil proceedings arising under title 11 or arising in or related to cases under title 11.\\" 28 U.S.C. ¬ß1471(b) (1976 ed. Supp.) While the new courts were denominated adjuncts of the district court, they were in practice free standing courts. The expanded jurisdiction was to be exercised primarily by bankruptcy judges. The bankruptcy judge would continue to be an Article I judge, who was appointed for a set term. The provisions of the 1978 Act came under scrutiny in the case of Northern Pipeline Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., 458 U.S. 50, 102 S. Ct. 2858, 73 L. Ed.2d 598 [6 C.B.C.2d 785] (1982). The Court held unconstitutional the broad grant of jurisdiction to bankruptcy judges because those judges were not appointed under and protected by the provisions of Article III of the Constitution. Under the United States Constitution, the Article III judges hold their offices during good behavior (an appointment for life), and their salary cannot be reduced during their tenure in office. Article I judges do not enjoy such rights. The jurisdictional challenge started when a creditor filed an adversary proceeding in bankruptcy court, which covered issues such as breach of contract, warranty, and misrepresentation. The bankruptcy court denied the defendant's motion to dismiss, and the defendant appealed to the district court. The district court held that 28 U.S.C. ¬ß1471 violated Article III of the Constitution because it delegated Article III powers to a non-Article III court by its broad grant of jurisdiction to the bankruptcy courts. In a plurality opinion, the Supreme Court held that the broad grant of jurisdiction accorded bankruptcy courts by 28 U.S.C. '1471 was an unconstitutional delegation of Article III powers to a non-Article III court. Similarly, Section 241(a) of the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, by establishing the jurisdictional provisions set forth in 28 U.S.C. '1471 was held unconstitutional. The Court stayed its judgment until October 4, 1982, to give \\"Congress an opportunity to reconstitute the bankruptcy courts or to adopt other valid means of adjudication, without impairing the interim administration of the bankruptcy laws.\\" Id. 458 U.S. at 89. After the stay had expired, Congress still failed to act. Instead, a model \\"emergency rule\\" was adopted as a local rule by the district courts. The purpose of the rule was to avoid the collapse of the bankruptcy system, and it was a temporary measure to provide for the orderly administration of bankruptcy cases and proceedings after Marathon. The rule remained in effect until enactment of the 1984 legislation on July 10, 1984. Although the constitutionality of the \\"emergency rule\\" was under constant attack, the Supreme Court consistently denied certiorari. In 1984, Congress implemented a \\"permanent\\" legislative solution to the issues addressed in Marathon by enacting the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984. By this act, with few exceptions, such as the trial of personal injury and wrongful death claims and matters that require consideration of both Title 11 and organizations or activities affecting interstate commerce, the new bankruptcy courts were allowed to exercise all of the subject matter jurisdiction of the district courts. Thus, bankruptcy courts were allowed to hear cases such as Marathon. The Act of 1984 in many ways resembled the Bankruptcy Act of 1898. Among other things, the law provided for the re-designation of separate units for bankruptcy judges under the district court system. Bankruptcy cases pending on or filed after July 10, 1984, are subject to most of the amendments relating to bankruptcy jurisdiction. The Bankruptcy Judges, United States Trustees, and Family Farmer Bankruptcy Act of 1986 made substantive changes relating to family farmers and established a permanent United States trustee system. The 1986 Act applies to cases filed since November 26, 1986. The Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1994 is effective as to cases filed on or after October 22, 1994. The reform act and the case law interpreting its provisions have a great impact upon the mortgage banking industry and the servicers of mortgage loans.

Bankruptcy is the legal status of a legal person unable to repay debts. Ancient world In Ancient Greece, bankruptcy did not exist. If a man owed and he could not pay, he and his wife, children or servants were forced into \\"debt slavery\\", until the creditor recouped losses via their physical labour. Many city-states in ancient Greece limited debt slavery to a period of five years and debt slaves had protection of life and limb, which regular slaves did not enjoy. However, servants of the debtor could be retained beyond that deadline by the creditor and were often forced to serve their new lord for a lifetime, usually under significantly harsher conditions. In Judaism and the Torah, or Old Testament, every seventh year is decreed by Mosaic Law as a Sabbatical year wherein the release of all debts that are owed by members of the Jewish community is mandated, but not of \\"gentiles\\".Deuteronomy 15:1‚Äì3 The seventh Sabbatical year, or forty-ninth year, is then followed by another Sabbatical year known as the Year of Jubilee wherein the release of all debts is mandated, for fellow community members and foreigners alike, and the release of all debt-slaves is also mandated.Leviticus 25:8‚Äì54 The Year of Jubilee is announced in advance on the Day of Atonement, or the tenth day of the seventh Biblical month, in the forty-ninth year by the blowing of trumpets throughout the land of Israel. In Islamic teaching, according to the Quran, an insolvent person was deemed to be allowed time to be able to pay out his debt. This is recorded in the Quran's second chapter (Sura Al-Baqara), Verse 281, which notes: \\"And if someone is in hardship, then let there be postponement until a time of ease. But if you give from your right as charity, then it is better for you, if you only knew.\\" Medieval period Medieval canon law discussed extensively provisions to mitigate the harshness of debtors' punishments. Most commentators allowed for a debtor to be discharged and make a fresh start, after ceding to his creditors all his goods (or possibly all his goods except some bare necessities).W. Pakter, The origins of bankruptcy in medieval canon and Roman law, in Proceedings of the Seventh International Congress of Medieval Canon Law, 1984, ed. P. Linehan, Vatican City, 1988, 485-506. These provisions later influenced English law. Bankruptcy is also documented in East Asia. According to al-Maqrizi, the Yassa of Genghis Khan contained a provision that mandated the death penalty for anyone who became bankrupt three times. Philip II of Spain had to declare four state bankruptcies in 1557, 1560, 1575 and 1596. Spain became the first sovereign nation in history to declare bankruptcy. Renaissance England In England, the first recognised piece of legislation was the Statute of Bankrupts 1542.Statute of Bankrupts 1542 (34 & 35 Hen. 8, c. 4) Bankrupts were seen as crooks, and the Act stated its aim to prevent \\"crafty debtors\\" escaping the realm. A more humane approach was developed in the Bankruptcy Act 1705.Bankruptcy Act 1705 (4 & 5 Ann. c. 4) passed on 19 March 1706 The Lord Chancellor was given power to discharge bankrupts, once disclosure of all assets and various procedures had been fulfilled. In Fowler v PadgetFowler v Padget (1798) 101 ER 1103; 7 Term Rep 509 Lord Kenyon reasserted the old sentiment that \\"Bankruptcy is considered a crime and a bankrupt in the old laws is called an offender.\\" The bankrupt was seen as being bonded to his creditors. Under the Insolvent Debtors (England) Act 1813, debtors could request release after 14 days in jail by taking an oath that their assets did not exceed ¬£20, but if any of their creditors objected, they had to stay inside. Attitudes were changing, however, and the Bankrupts (England) Act 1825Bankrupts (England) Act 1825 (6 Geo. 4 c. 16) allowed people to start proceedings for their own bankruptcy, in agreement with creditors. Previously only creditors could start the proceedings. Bankruptcy proceedings agreed between creditors and debtor also occurred when a trader filed a declaration of insolvency in the office of the Chancellor's Secretary of Bankrupts, which was then advertised. The advertised declaration supported a commission in bankruptcy to be issued. A law was thereafter enacted, which declared that no commission grounded on this act of bankruptcy was to be \\"deemed invalid by reason of such declaration having been concerted or agreed upon between the bankrupt and any creditor or other person.\\"Bankrupts (England) Act 1825 (6 Geo. 4 c. 16) sections VI and VII Voluntary bankruptcy was not authorized until the passing of the Bankruptcy Law Consolidation Act 1849.Bankruptcy Law Consolidation Act 1849 (12 & 13 Vict. c. 106) section 93 In the middle of the 19th century, attitudes towards corporations were also quickly changing. Since the South Sea Bubble disaster, companies were viewed as inefficient and dangerous.Adam Smith, Wealth of Nations (1776) Book V, Ch 1, para.107 But with the industrial revolution in full swing that changed. The Joint Stock Companies Act 1844Joint Stock Companies Act 1844 (7 & 8 Vict. c. 110) allowed people to create companies without permission through a royal charter. Companies had \\"separate legal personality\\", the ability to sue and be sued, and served as an easy mechanism for raising capital through the purchase of shares (an equitable title) in the company's capital. The Act's corollary, to bring the existence of these \\"legal persons\\" to an end was the Joint Stock Companies Winding-Up Act 1844. The Limited Liability Act 1855 produced a further innovation. Before, if a corporation had gone broke, the people that lent it money (creditors) could sue all the shareholders to pay off the company's debts. But the 1855 Act said that shareholders' liability would be limited to the amount they had paid for their shares of stock. The Joint Stock Companies Act 1856 consolidated the companies legislation in one, and the modern law of corporate insolvency was born. Finally, the Bankruptcy Act 1869 was passed allowing all people, rather than just traders to file for bankruptcy. *Debtors' prison, Fleet Prison, Marshalsea Prison, King's Bench Prison, Debtors' Act 1869 *Charles Dickens, Hard Times, Mr Micawber in David Copperfield Modern development =United States= See alsoUK insolvency law Notes References ;Articles   ;Reports *Report of the Commission on Bankruptcy Laws of the United States, H.R.

In 2014 it won several others including a Mind Media Award and Student Media of the Year. Roar has existed in various incarnations since 1973, but in 1992 its name was changed from Casey L to Roar News - named after the university's mascot, Reggie the lion. Roar prints four times a year, spending most of its energy on bringing students and staff up-to-the-minute news online. Former editors, writers and photographers now work for national news outlets such as The Sun, Press Association, The Independent The Daily Mail, Time Out Magazine, The Times and Sky. History Roar has existed in various formats, as a magazine, then a tabloid newspaper. It was turned into a full colour, glossy magazine in 2006 but has since been re-branded as a tabloid, borrowing the style of The Sun and The Mirror newspapers in its layout. It once fell under complete editorial control of the Vice-President Media and Publications, Vice-President Communications and Vice-President Student Media and Engagement, with shifts in the nature of its editorial independence, but in 2010 a student editor was appointed. The correct version of the newspaper's full name is Roar News, although it is typically shortened to Roar. The newspaper's name has changed the punctuation and style many times over the years which often leads to it wrongly being called ROAR, ROAR! or Roar!. Awards In 2018, Roar picked up a total of five Highly Commended Awards at the Student Publication Association. Nominated in five categories, the paper was commended in all five: Best News Story, Best Multi-Media Journalism Story, Best Newspaper Design, Best Student Photographer and Best Lifestyle Story. The paper also picked up Best Publication in the London Regional Student Publication Awards. In 2017, Roar won a Highly Commended Award at the Student Publication Association for Best Feature. Roar picked up six awards at the Student Publication Association in 2015. The paper won Best Publication, Best Website, Best Design and Best Entertainment Piece. It received a highly commended for Best News Story and Best Feature. Roar's editorial team won the Anna Sargent Student Journalist Award at the Mind Media Awards for outstanding mental health reporting in November 2014.[3] The newspaper was also shortlisted alongside The Guardian and Cosmopolitan for the non-student award of Best Publication.[4] Roar won Best Website in the 2014 Student Publication Association awards and received a special recognition for Best Publication.[5] Alongside KCL Radio, KingsTV and Photosoc, Roar was ranked as one of the top three best student media outlets in the country at the NUS Awards 2014. KCLSU Student Media received runner up in the Student Media of the Year category.[6] Campaigns True to its tabloid style, Roar runs traditional tabloid campaigns on matters of student interest. Recent campaigns have included: * Health Schools job cuts (May 2014 ‚Äì present) Roar came out against university plans to cut 120 jobs in Health Schools in a leader accusing the College of lacking transparency and racing through the redundancy process too quickly. * London Living Wage (Feb 2014 - March 2014) As part of the campaign, Roar ran an interview with two anonymous King's cleaners who couldn't afford to feed their children on the front page of their February edition. That edition of the paper was taken into the College Council meeting in March, where King's agreed to the London living wage. * Lord Carey 'homophobic' comments (Nov 2012‚ÄìFeb 2015) Roar campaigned for the removal of King's alumnus Lord Carey from the Strand Campus windows for controversial comments in opposition to same sex marriage at a Conservative Party conference fringe event in 2012. * Mental health awareness (Nov 2013‚Äìpresent) Roar produced a special print edition on mental health in November 2013, aiming to raise awareness of mental health among King's students.

Once ordained, they would return to the Canadian Prairies to open up new Lutheran churches. Concordia was established in 1921 with a first class of eighth grade boys. In the 1940s the school became co-ed and became an academic prep school. After World War II the high school continued as a grade nine to twelve program. In 1987 Concordia University College of Alberta was granted degree-granting status. The history and growth of the university is largely owed to the small academic high school that gradually added junior college courses to the high school program until it grew into a full-fledged university college on the same campus, gradually crowding out the original high school program. Many students as a matter of course received their high school diploma and took university courses at Concordia until either graduation or in order to transfer to the University of Alberta. Some of the university faculty as well were previous students or teachers at the high school. In 2000 the high school program was fully detached from the university program. Concordia High School was incorporated as a separate entity with its own board of governors separate from the governance of the university. In 1997 the high school moved to the north edge of campus at 112 Avenue and 73 Street in Edmonton, where it remained for 14 years. In July 2011 Concordia High School moved to 830 Saddleback Road (the former Taylor College and Seminary campus) in the south end of Edmonton. Concordia High School permanently closed on August 20, 2012. The school's board of governors issued a statement that they had been informed in an unanticipated development that the facility lease would not be renewed, and that they had been unable to find an alternative facility for dormitory and classroom space; however, the landlord company stated that the school had defaulted on its lease in January 2012, and the lease was later terminated when the school informed the landlord that they were insolvent and would not open for the 2012-13 school year.

It inhabits reefs along the western coast of the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico from North Carolina to northern Argentina. Geographic Range This species of ray is generally found in the Western hemisphere, around the Southern coast of the North America and the Eastern and Norther coast of South America. They are widely distributed in tropical latitudes, with the highest concentrations near the tropical west Indo-Pacific region, they are also considered an endemic species of the western Atlantic Ocean (Wosnick 2018). There have been a few locations along the coast of Brazil where they have been reported, those include, Rio Grande do Sul, Paran√° State, Canan√©ia, Ubatuba, Bahia State, Pernambuco State, Para√≠ba State, Maranh√£ State, and Par√° and Amap√° States (Menni 2000). Those locations are all on the coast of Brazil. On the East of the United States they are found in the waters along the coast of Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. On the South of the United States they are located on the southern coast of Florida, Alabama and Mississippi (GBIF). Habitat This species is considered a ‚Äúwarm water species‚Äù. When there's a temperature gradient between an inshore and an offshore they will habituate at the depths with the highest temperature (Menni 2000). The density of this species had a higher concentration in temperatures that were greater than 20¬∫C (Vianna 2009). They prefer shallow waters because that is usually the warmest part of the water. During the summer, they are abundant in coastal water with depths that go to 20 meters and in the winter, they are still in that area but in a lower concentration and at deeper depths, about 40-50 meters, to avoid the cold temperatures. (Vianna 2009) This behavior points toward a migration towards the south in the summer because of the warmer water with higher salinity. The salinity range that they prefer is from 24% to 36% (Menni 2000). They also hunt and hide around areas with soft sand and/or mud substrate (Rolim 2015). Physical Description They are small to moderate sized, not very big, they can get to only about 45 centimeters in total length (Vianna 2009). The shape of their body is an oval shape, with two dorsal fins that are around the same size (Wosnick 2018), the caudal fin is shaped like a triangle and there is no spine on the caudal fin on this ray, unlike some other species. On the dorsal side of their body they have a brown coloration and a white coloration on their ventral side. They have more of an elongated/protruding body size, they aren't very short or rounded, this helps to differentiate them from other ray species (Olfers 1831). The jaw arch, which consist of the lower and upper jaw, moves as a unit, this allows for them to create suction in order to feed and capture prey hiding in the sand or mud substrate. The limitation to this is, there are a series of ligaments that constrict the jaws from moving in other directions, because of this it may cause limits in their diet, but at the same time increase their suction ability (Dean 2004). They have an electroreceptor system located on the ventral part of their body that is sensitive to low frequency, they use this in order to search for prey. The system is composed of many sensory units, known as Ampullae of Lorenzini, these are connected to the environment and the nervous system through external pores and canals by nerves and fibers (Wosnick 2018). What is special about this species, is they have electric organs that can generate an average voltage about 0.35 mV (Macesic 2008). The organs are located in their pectoral fins and they are noticeable when you look at the ray from the frontal few. The lobules have hexagonal faces and they show their shape through the skin (Olfers 1831). The size and number of the cells in the electric organs are higher in adults than in embryos/newborns (Rolim 2015), this causes the newborns to generate weaker electric organ discharge (Macesic 2008), which makes them more vulnerable to predators. Males vs. Females The females reach larger sizes than males, however, features such as the eyes, mouth, and nostrils are larger in males. The tails on males are longer than females‚Äô tails because the posterior region of the body develops at a faster rate than the total length. The larger sizes of females helps with the nourishment of the embryos. The males also have higher values of the proportions of the dorsal fins, and the superior lobe of their caudal fin. The females have a wider trunk (main part of the body), this is because they have to accommodate all of the embryos that they hold (Rolim 2015). Males have a greater proportion of their electric organs than females, this may be another example of resource allocation in this species since the females have to use more energy to produce nutrients for the embryos (Macesic 2008). Development Although little is known about this species‚Äô life cycle, scientist do know that they have slow growth the birth is viviparous (Marinsek 2017). Since they are born live, as they are developing inside the womb, each individual ray (or pup) has a yolk-sac which they use for obtaining nutrients as they are growing in the womb. As they grow bigger and get closer to being birthed by the mother, those nutrients are used up (Rolim 2016). The three main stages of this ray are a neonate (newborn), a juvenile, and an adult. As for their electric organs, neonates don't have a lot of electric cells so they can't give off as much of a voltage as juveniles and adults (Macesic 2008). Reproduction ‚Äì general behavior/parental investment Sexual maturity occurs when males have a total length of about 25 centimeters and when females have a total length of about 30 centimeters (Wosnick 2018). Although there is low fecundity, generally, in females (Marinsek 2017), they can produce about 4-15 embryos per pregnancy. Also, as females increase in size their fecundity increases as well, meaning there is a selective advantage on larger sized female rays. Since males are generally smaller in size than females, they also mature sexually at smaller sizes compared to females (Rolim 2016). Most pregnancy in females occurs in the summer and the autumn, and pre-ovulatory periods in females occurred in the winter. in males calcifying claspers were observed during the summer, autumn, and winter. Going along with this pattern in males in females, there is an annual reproductive cycle with a mating season during the spring and a pregnancy and birth season during the summer and the autumn. There is a high energy requirement during the courtship and mating process, there may be bite marks observed in sexually mature female and male dorsal regions during the mating period (Rolim 2016). Life Span/Longevity As stated earlier, not much is known about their life cycle, but what is known is they have a very long surviving capacity and a low natural mortality rate (Marinsek 2017). Natural meaning death by predators, most of them die from anthropogenic causes which is discussed in later sections. Behavior This species of ray migrates around November and December from the north (Menni 2000) to areas with a depth of about 20 meters (Rolim 2016), and then migrate again during May and June (Menni 2000) to areas with a depth of about 10 meters (Rolim 2016). This migration is mainly driven by reproductive opportunities or feeding opportunities (Vianna 2009). The migration has also been associated with the higher temperatures in the south during the winter months, they have been observed having a sluggish and slow-moving sort of behavior if they are in water that is less than 20 ¬∫C (Vianna 2009). They spend most of the time buried in the substrate or in murky water because of their demersal habits, in order to hide for predators or search for prey (Macesic 2008). Unlike some other electric ray species, this species of electric ray generally only uses its electric organs for predator defense and intraspecific communication (Wosnick 2018). When it comes to neonates, since they are smaller in size, they have smaller electric organs, so when they are defending themselves against predators, they discharge a greater number of electric organ discharges than juveniles and adults, in order to make up for their size. Food Habits Since the Brazilian electric ray is a benthic feeder, they mainly feed on invertebrates that are buried in the sand, for example, polychaetas are one of the main foods of its diet (Vianna 2009). Some other things that this species has been known for feeding on are crustaceans, marine worms, poriferans (sponges), echinoderms (starfish), and some other types of benthonic fish. When they do catch prey, they use benthonic pressure suction in order to take the prey into their mouth and swallow it whole (Marinsek 2017). In order to create that suction to get their prey, they extend their jaws into the substrate, then they retract their jaws very quickly and create the ‚Äúsuper ambient orobranchial pressure‚Äù (Dean 2004) to get rid of any sediment taken in and draw food towards the esophagus. Since they have a lot of muscle control in their mouths, these rays are able to remove the exoskeletons of crustaceans, squid mantels, and bivalve shells in order to eat only the indigestible parts (Dean 2004). Predation As stated in the lifespan/longevity section, most of their deaths are caused by anthropogenic effects. One of these main effects, is the fishing industry, since they have been responsible for the decline of several populations of this species over the past 30 years (Vianna 2009). They are usually discarded as bycatch when they are caught accidentally by trawl nets. Even though the fishermen may throw the rays back into the water alive they have been observed to sustain injuries from this. Some of those injuries observed are contusion in the bottom portion of their body (the most common injury), many deep cuts, fractures, and partial, even total, loss of body parts (Wosnick 2018). Ecosystem Roles The Brazilian electric ray is considered a macropredator in its habitat and it plays an important part in the ecosystem dynamics. The most important role they play is population control, they keep the number of polychaetas and crustaceans down which then helps the population of algae. If they weren't located in the ecosystem there would be too many crustaceans and they would ruin the ecosystem. Since these rays help with the population numbers of algae, they are also known to help in connecting the lower and the higher trophic levels. Since they play such important roles, changes in their populations may lead to negative changes in the ecosystem at all the tropic levels (Marinsek 2017). Economic Importance In the economy, they really have no commercial value, they are only caught by accident usually. Their release as by-catch from the trawl nets is even considered an annoyance and a challenge by fishermen because of the electric discharges that the rays are giving off as they are being handled (Wosnick 2018). They give off these electric discharges because they believe they are being attacked by a predator and the fisherman are just throwing them back into the water, although not many make it back to the water with no injuries. Conservation Status Since Brazilian electric rays don't have any commercial importance, there aren't many statistics on the commercial fisheries of this species and no statistics on efforts that would enable a population status assessment (Vianna 2009). This has left to the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species to put this species in the Data Deficient category. In order for the IUCN to find a good section for them to be listed in, they need more studies to determine the taxonomic issues, population dynamics, morphology, and distribution (Rolim 2015). However, most of them are killed by the fishing industry and since this industry is so huge it is likely that they may be threatened, since the depth that they exist and proliferate in is the same depth that is interrupted by shrimp trawls (Marinsek 2017).

The English- language distribution title of the film is Life Is a Bed of Roses, though it has also been known as Forbek's Castle and Life Is a Fairy Tale. A literal translation of the original title is \\"Life is a novel [or story, romance]\\"; in the film the French quotation (or misquotation) is attributed to Napoleon. Plot The film interweaves three stories from different eras but sharing a common location, in the forest of Ardennes. In legendary times, the baby son of a king is rescued by his nurse when his father is killed by a rival. When the boy grows up, he kills a dragon, rescues a maiden, and reclaims his kingdom, to initiate a reign of love and happiness. In 1914, the wealthy Count Forbek announces to his friends his plan to build an extravagant castle, a \\"temple of happiness\\", as a home for himself and for them, which he will dedicate to Livia, the woman he intends to marry. His plans are disrupted by the onset of the First World War, and Livia marries Raoul, an army officer; but in 1920 the castle is sufficiently complete for Forbek to entertain his friends there. He invites them all to participate in an experiment in which their present discontents and all their memories will be wiped away when they drink a potion, and they will be reborn as new people, re-educated to live in perfect harmony. Livia alone secretly avoids drinking the potion and observes its effect on the others. When she learns that Raoul has died in the experiment, she denounces Forbek's scheme, and he is devastated by her rejection. In the 1980s, the castle has been converted into the Institut Holberg, a progressive school and teacher-training establishment. An educational conference brings together delegates who include Walter Guarini, a utopian architect, Nora Winkle, an American anthropologist, Elisabeth Rousseau, an earnest provincial schoolmistress, and Roger Dufresne, a games expert at the Institute. The determination of Georges Leroux, the conference convenor, to unite everyone in shared ideals of how the next generation should be educated is subverted when Elisabeth's demonstration of her practical method of integrated teaching provokes an outbreak of ideological disputes.

They developed an original scenario from their personal interests and enthusiasms into a three-tiered narrative which explored different attitudes towards happiness. Resnais's interest in 18th century British architecture and the extravagant projects of William Beckford provided the starting point for the section about Forbek and his castle.Interview with Jean Gruault in October 2002, included in the Artificial Eye DVD edition (2010) of Life Is a Bed of Roses. Music was a significant element of the film. Resnais was eager to use an alternation of speaking and singing in the dialogue.Interview with Alain Resnais in Cahiers du Cin√©ma, no.347 (1983); quoted by Emma Wilson, Alain Resnais. (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2006.) p.157. The final scenes of the 1980s section with its shifting romantic coupling was modelled with The Marriage of Figaro in mind. The operatic dimension of the film was further emphasised by the casting of the bass Ruggero Raimondi in the role of Forbek (though he does not sing). The singer Cathy Berberian appeared in the legendary sequence, in the singing role of the old nurse which was one of her last performances; she died before the film was released. To create distinct visual textures for different sections, different types of film stock were used: Eastmancolor for the 1920s section about Count Forbek, and Fujicolor for the 1980s episode of the educational conference. For the fantasy scenes, the graphic artist Enki Bilal (who had previously designed the publicity poster for Mon oncle d'Am√©rique) created grotesque images of trees, plants and roots, painted on glass, which were placed in front of the camera to give an air of unreality to the filmed sets and landscapes. For the exterior scenes of the castle, a ch√¢teau on the outskirts of Paris was used; the set designer Jacques Saulnier built a structure around it to give its extravagant aspects which were in a mixture of styles, including many oriental influences. This produced the effect described in the film as \\"une p√¢tisserie\\" (\\"a cake\\").Interview with Jacques Saulnier in October 2002, included in the Artificial Eye DVD edition (2010) of Life Is a Bed of Roses. Interior scenes were filmed at the Studios de Boulogne. Reception When the film was released in April 1983, it received many bad reviews: a critic for Le Monde called it a \\"catastrophe\\".Emma Wilson, Alain Resnais. (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2006.) p.157. It also drew the lowest-ever number of cinema admissions in France for a Resnais film to that date.Interview with Alain Resnais, in Robert Benayoun, Alain Resnais: arpenteur de l'imaginaire. (Paris: Stock, Ramsay, 2008.) p.252. It was also coolly received by English-language critics when shown at film festivals.E.g. David Robinson, reporting from the Venice Film Festival 1983 in The Times, 12 September 1983, p.13. Janet Maslin, from the New York Film Festival, in The New York Times, 29 September 1983. Derek Malcolm, from the Venice Film Festival, in Sight & Sound, Winter 1983/1984, p.6. Some reviewers saw the film as a comic counterpart to its predecessor Mon oncle d'Am√©rique which had also used a triple narrative as the means of exploring theories of human behaviour; and both films were written by the same screenwriter, Jean Gruault.E.g. Robert Brown, \\"Everyone Has His Reasons\\", in Monthly Film Bulletin, v.51 no.4 (May 1984) pp.136-137. A rare positive reaction was stated in Sight & Sound: \\"After Mon oncle d'Am√©rique, which drew its multiple narratives from the forbidding stuff of the behavioural sciences, Resnais's latest collage seems quite frivolously based, intertwining fairy tale, comedy of manners and Feuillade-like fantasy. But the result is the same: a delicious celebration of imaginative possibility and narrative cunning\\".Sight & Sound, vol.53 no.3, (Summer 1984) p.232. Robert Benayoun, the critic and friend of Resnais, attributed the film's lack of success to the public's confusion when confronted with what appeared to be an overtly comic film from a director previously more associated with serious themes. Benayoun asserted however that this film \\"was made more than ever in the full likeness of Resnais: composite in style, baroque, intricate, built upon levels which are multiplied without restraint\\".Robert Benayoun, Alain Resnais: arpenteur de l'imaginaire (Paris: Stock, 2008.) p.199. \\"Cette ≈ìuvre ‚Äì qui est plus que jamais √† la ressemblance totale de Resnais: composite, baroque, sinueuse, b√¢tie sur des niveaux qui s'additionnent sans se contrecarrer ‚Ä¶ ‚Äì a √©t√© m√©connue, m√©sestim√©e √† sa sortie, parce que sa bouffonnerie occasionnelle a pu accr√©diter l'id√©e superficielle que Resnais, contre tout son travail pr√©c√©dent, avait voulu faire rire son public‚Ä¶ C'√©tait d'abord n'avoir rien entendu √† l'humour diffus de tous les films d'Alain Resnais‚Ä¶\\" References  External links  * 1980s musical comedy films 1983 films Films directed by Alain Resnais French musical comedy films French films 1983 comedy films ","title":"Life Is a Bed of Roses"},{"id":"30891748","text":"The Transatlantic Climate Bridge is a climate partnership between Germany and the United States. The partnership was first proposed by German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier in an April 2008 lecture at Harvard University. He believed that climate policy was the core of transatlantic matters. On 29 September 2008, he and German Environment Minister Sigmar Gabriel wrote in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, \\"Together with the United States, we can make the technological breakthroughs required and successfully negotiate a follow-up treaty to the Kyoto Protocol. Only if we work closely with our partners on the other side of the Atlantic will we succeed in convincing emerging countries such as China, India and Brazil, as well as Russia, to opt for a sustainable growth model that spares the climate.\\" The next day, the climate bridge was launched by Germany at a conference at the German Foreign Office in Berlin, where about 300 American, Canadian, and German representatives invited by Steinmeier and Gabriel convened. There, they \\"sought to identify innovative solutions for tackling climate change\\". In the US, the initiative was launched on 16 December in Washington, D.C., at the invitation of German Ambassador to the US Klaus Scharioth. The partnership entails cooperation between US and German officials in matters of confronting climate change. It aims to develop novel ways to reduce emissions and to improve energy efficiency.

Early life  Stilinoviƒá was born in Belgrade, Serbia, to father Marijan Stilinoviƒá, who early in his career was an editor of the newspaper Borba, ambassador to Argentina, and later head of Museum of Contemporary Art, Zagreb, and mother Nada Stilinoviƒá (n√©e Popoviƒá).  Career  Stilinoviƒá's works are based on the idea of social and art critique. They are often witty, and come with a dose of irony and cynicism illustrated for example in his work, Money is Money, Art is Art. He was one of the founding members of the informal neo-avantgarde, Group of Six Artists (Grupa ≈°estorice autora), together with Vladimir Martek, Boris Demur, ≈Ωeljko Jerman, Sven Stilinoviƒá and Fedomir Vuƒçemiloviƒá.

Note the battleship on the bottom end of the second row from the bottom (Iowa has since moved to the Port of Los Angeles as a museum ship). The Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet is located on the northwest side of Suisun Bay (the northern portion of the greater San Francisco Bay estuary). The fleet is within a regulated navigation area that is about long and wide. It begins just north of the Union Pacific Railroad Bridge and runs northeast, parallel to the shoreline. Water depths range from about at Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) at the foot of the anchorage, to about MLLW at the shallowest berths towards the northern end of the anchorage. Purpose The U.S. Maritime Administration (MARAD) maintains the National Defense Reserve Fleet, a fleet of vessels that serves as a reserve of ships for national defense and national emergency purposes. The reserve fleet program was begun in 1946 at the end of World War II. At its peak in 1950, the program had more than 2,000 ships in lay-up. One of the reserve fleet storage sites is in Suisun Bay, the northern portion of San Francisco Bay. Only a small portion of vessels currently remain with the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet. In January 2016, the Department of Transportation and MARAD have officially announced the fleet closure in February 2017. All remaining ships will be sold at auction or scrapped. Environmental issues The State of California and several environmental groups have raised concerns about the environmental impacts of the fleet. Potential concerns include heavy metals and anti-fouling agents in the paint that is peeling off of the vessels, as well as PCBs and other hazardous materials that may have been released. Congress responded to these concerns by funding the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to design and implement a study of contaminants in the vicinity of the fleet. NOAA's Damage Assessment, Response and Restoration Program (DARRP) began work on this project in January 2008. Since then, NOAA's team has assessed existing data from the area to determine data gaps, researched the history and environmental setting of the site, discussed the project with numerous stakeholders, conducted a site visit, and developed and refined a sampling and analysis plan. NOAA deployed bivalve samples in June 2008 and collected sediment and bivalve tissue samples from the area in July 2008. A second field sampling event for additional tissue samples occurred in September. These samples were analyzed and a data report was delivered in early 2009. Based on these findings, the United States Government has reached an agreement with Arc Ecology, San Francisco BayKeeper, Natural Resources Defense Council, and the California Regional Water Quality Control Board, San Francisco Bay Region (Regional Board) regarding the maintenance and disposal of obsolete ships owned by the U.S. Department of Transportation's Maritime Administration (MARAD) at the Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet site, resolving a lawsuit in the Eastern District of California.

It is dedicated to St Caian, a Christian from the 5th or 6th century about whom little is known. The building contains a late 14th-century east window and a late 15th-century doorway. The churchyard contains the grave of William ap Howel, who died in 1581 at the age of 105, leaving over forty children between the ages of 8 and 89 and over three hundred living descendants. The church is still used for worship by the Church in Wales, and is one of three churches in a combined parish. It is a Grade II* listed building, a national designation given to \\"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\\", in particular because it is regarded as \\"an excellent late Medieval rural church\\". History and location The date of construction of the first Christian building on this site is unknown. The church is dedicated to St Caian, a Christian from the 5th or 6th century, about whom little is known. One manuscript says that his father was St Caw, a king in northern Britain who lost his lands and sought safety in Anglesey, where the ruler Maelgwn Gwynedd gave him land in the north-east of the island, the district known as Twrcelyn.Baring-Gould, pp. 92‚Äì94. If Caian was a son of St Caw, then his sisters included St Cwyllog, who established the nearby church of St Cwyllog, Llangwyllog, in the 6th century.Baring-Gould, p. 279. Other manuscripts say that he was active in the 5th century and was a son or grandson of Brychan, a king from south Wales.Baring-Gould, p. 51. Caian gives his name to the hamlet of Tregaian in which the church is situated: the Welsh word ' (shortened here to tre) means \\"settlement\\", and \\"‚Äëgaian\\" is a modified form of the saint's name ‚Äì i.e. \\"Caian's settlement\\". Tregaian is about north of Llangefni, the county town of Anglesey, and the church is in the countryside by a small road. The present church is medieval, dating from the latter part of the 14th century, which is the period given to the east window. The doorway is from the late 15th century, the roof from the end of the 16th or beginning of the 17th century, and the nave windows and the panelling of the pulpit are from the 17th century. It is still used for worship by the Church in Wales, as one of three churches in the combined benefice of Llangefni with Tregaean with Llanddyfnan (Talwrn). It is within the deanery of Malltraeth, the archdeaconry of Bangor and the Diocese of Bangor. As of 2013, the priest in charge of the parish is the Reverend J Ashley-Roberts. Architecture and fittings The church is built from rubble masonry. The roof, which is made from slate, has a stone bellcote at the west end. Entrance is through the doorway on the south side, from the late 15th century; it has decorated surrounds and a square frame. There is no structural division between the nave (where the congregation sit) and the chancel (where the altar is located) apart from a single step up into the chancel. The church is about long by wide.Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire, p. 149. The east window, from the late 14th century, is set in a pointed arch with decorative edging. It has stained glass from 1916 depicting Christ crowning a knight with the words \\"Well done thou good and faithful servant / Take unto you the whole armour of God.\\" There are two pairs of square-headed windows in the south wall, dating from the 17th century. On the north side of the church, a second entrance was blocked up in the late 19th century, and there is one pair of square-headed windows, also from the 17th century; there is also a small window at the west end of the church, from the 17th or 18th century. The beams of the roof can be seen from inside the church. Behind the altar is a panelled reredos from the 19th century. A memorial by an old gravestone The church has a 12th-century circular font, decorated with an irregular pattern of chevrons on the side. The bell is dated 1717, whilst the pews are from the 19th century. There are memorials tablets from the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries on the walls, some of which commemorate the Lloyd family from a nearby house, Plas Tregaian. A 1937 survey by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire noted a plain silver cup dated 1714‚Äì15. The churchyard contains the grave of William ap Howel, who died at the age of 105 in 1581. Married three times, he fathered 42 or 43 children in and out of wedlock, and more than 300 of his descendants attended his funeral. His children at his death ranged in age from 8 to 89. Assessment The church has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II* listed building ‚Äì the second-highest of the three grades of listing, designating \\"particularly important buildings of more than special interest\\". It was given this status on 12 May 1970, and has been listed because it is \\"an excellent late Medieval rural church\\". Cadw (the Welsh Assembly Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists) also states that it \\"retains a strong simple character in the retention of many early features and its original plan, with structurally undivided nave and chancel.\\" The 19th-century antiquarian Angharad Llwyd described the church as \\"a small but neat edifice\\", and noted the \\"handsome\\" east window. The 19th-century writer Samuel Lewis said that the church was \\"simple and primitive in its construction\\". Writing in 1847, the clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones said that the font was \\"remarkable\\" for having no drain, and was \\"hardly large enough for immersion.\\" He added that the east window was of \\"rather singular\\" design. A 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey notes the \\"unusually wide\\" east window. A 2009 guide to the buildings of the region says that the church \\"gives an impression of what the Anglesey parish churches were like before so many were reassembled in the 19th century\\" ‚Äì partly because the walls lean, it adds. The east window has also been compared to that of St Ceidio's Church, Rhodogeidio, also on Anglesey.Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire, p. 144.

He returned to mining aged thirteen, and through studying at night school, he and his brother both obtained mine manager's certificates. His brother later became superintendent of mines for Charles Brooke, Rajah of Sarawak, while Chisholm Robertson turned to trade unionism.

Murdoch first journeyed to Ceylon in order to serve as a head-master of the schools located in Kandy, yet shortly after his arrival he resigned due to concerns with the state-mandated curriculum. Murdoch instead began to work with various Christian societies within the country producing Christian tracts. After a successful career with the Ceylon Tract Society, he became the Agent and Travelling Secretary in India for the Christian Vernacular Education Society, located in India, working with this mission for the rest of his career. He retired from full-time missionary work in 1903, yet continued to publish his written works on a variety of sources which included politics, religion, and sociology. He died in India after becoming weakened by pneumonia in 1904 having never married yet leaving behind a legacy in his written work.  Early life  John Murdoch was born in Glasgow, Scotland on 22 July 1819 to John and Margret Murdoch, the third in a family of twelve children. When he was ten years of age, Murdoch attended the Glasgow High School where he showed great aptitude in both the classics as well as in the field of art. Thus, in 1838, when he was only nineteen years of age, Murdoch left Glasgow and moved to Amsterdam with the intention of studying the classic works of art contained in the local galleries. Despite devoting himself to his artistic lifestyle he was unable to support himself by selling his paintings and was forced to return home to Glasgow.  Career  =As a teacher= It was at this point Murdoch decided to become an educator. To this end, he began to attend classes at the University of Glasgow as well as enrolling himself in the Glasgow Normal Seminary, a school established by David Stow which devoted itself entirely to training teachers. After completing his education he obtained a position as the assistant master, later promoted to headmaster, of the English Department of the Private Seminary for children of the wealthier class where he remained until the school was closed in 1842.Morris, Henry. The Life of John Murdoch, LL.D. The Christian Literature Society for India, 1906, p. 7. At this time, Rev. William Fraser recommended Murdoch for appointment to the position of head-master of the Governmental Central and Normal Schools located in Kandy, Ceylon. Murdoch accepted the position and left Scotland on 13 March 1844 arriving in Ceylon on 17 August of the following year. Once established, Murdoch poured himself into his work finding great enjoyment in it, as many of his letters home attested.Morris, Henry. The Life of John Murdoch, LL.D. The Christian Literature Society for India, 1906, p. 22. Yet he found himself troubled by the fact that the government of Ceylon, as a crown colony, required him to teach the Bible as part of the curriculum despite the fact that the majority of his students were practicing Buddhists, Hindus and Muslims.Morris, Henry. The Life of John Murdoch, LL.D. The Christian Literature Society for India, 1906, p. 22-23. In short, he was ill at ease being paid to teach Christian doctrine with revenues collected from these religious groups. In 1849, the Government of Ceylon, due to a bad crop of coffee, was forced to close down half of the Government Schools and drastically raise tuition in the remaining schools, resulting in a significant decline in the number of students.Morris, Henry. The Life of John Murdoch, LL.D. The Christian Literature Society for India, 1906, p. 27. This situation, in combination with Murdoch's unease at using government schools to teach Christianity, was enough to cause him to resign his commission as of 1 October 1849. =Missionary= Once he had resigned as head-master, Murdoch devoted himself to an occupation which had previously been a nothing more than a hobby of his: tracts writing. While being previously employed as a teacher, Murdoch had bought a printing press and some Sinhalese type, and had begun to produce Sinhalese translations of various Christian tracts.Ferguson, John. The \\"Literary Evangelist\\" of India and Ceylon: John Murdoch, LL.D. The University of Manchester, The John Rylands University Library, 1898, p. 6. Feeling the desire to continue full-time in this Christian missionary activity, Murdoch began working with the Sinhalese Tract Society writing tracts and visiting local Christian missionaries to better understand their needs.Morris, Henry. The Life of John Murdoch, LL.D. The Christian Literature Society for India, 1906, p. 34‚Äì35. He worked in Ceylon for the next five years, writing and printing tracts and visiting local missionaries. While working with the Sinhalese Tract Society, Murdoch helped to produce \\"a considerable stock of tracts, some 20 school books, 6 maps, and several weighty volumes of Church History, Notes on the Bible, Jame's Anxious Inquirer . . . all in Sinhalese.\\" Ferguson, John. The \\"Literary Evangelist\\" of India and Ceylon: John Murdoch, LL.D. The University of Manchester, The John Rylands University Library, 1898, p. 8. As he traveled from one coffee plantation to the next, visiting with the English managers, he was convicted of the need to provide spiritual teaching for the Indian laborers.Morris, Henry. The Life of John Murdoch, LL.D. The Christian Literature Society for India, 1906, p. 41. He therefore helped to form the Tamil Cooly Mission, an endeavor which placed him in contact with John Thomas, a missionary in Tirunelveli, India. This relationship meant that Murdoch was able to extend his network of missionary connections from Ceylon to India. It was because of these Indian missionary connections that in 1858, Murdoch was invited to become the Agent and Travelling Secretary in India for the Christian Vernacular Education Society, a position which Murdoch accepted; in 1891 the name of the society would be shortened to The Christian Literature Society (CLS).Morris, Henry. The Life of John Murdoch, LL.D. The Christian Literature Society for India, 1906, p. 65. The purpose of the society was primarily to provide inexpensive Christian literature for the newly literate Christians of India,Sharpe, Eric. Biographical Dictionary of Christian Missions. Ed. Gerald H. Anderson. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1999, p. 481. yet they also concerned themselves with the education of school teachers and the inspection and improvement of the indigenous schools. Despite the fact that Murdoch worked for the CLS for the remainder of his career, he did not always agree with the other members in regards to protocol. When he was initially brought in to serve as the society's Agent, he had several disagreements with his coworkers in regards to funding and the qualifications necessary for the teachers who would be employed at the various institutions associated with the CLS.Oddie, Geoffrey A. Missionaries, Rebellion and Proto- Nationalism: James Long of Bengal 1814-87. Curzon, Press, 1999, p. 65-67. Despite these conflicts, Murdoch would remain with the CLS until his retirement in 1903. Much of Murdoch's work for the society consisted of traveling throughout India inspecting various schools, and visiting with missionaries and society representatives. His travels took him outside of India, however, he made professional visits to Great Britain, the United States, various European countries and China, meeting with members of educational boards and practicing missionaries.Morris, Henry. The Life of John Murdoch, LL.D. The Christian Literature Society for India, 1906, p. 89. His trip to China and Japan in 1882 and then again in 1891 proved most beneficial to his work as it enabled him to network the CLS with the newly formed Christian Literature Society for China.Morris, Henry. The Life of John Murdoch, LL.D. The Christian Literature Society for India, 1906, p. 107. These trips also allowed him to network with powerful individuals outside of his normal sphere of influence such as Florence Nightingale, with whom he discussed issues of sanitation and health for the native population of India. She later praised his literary work, saying that his \\"little books are a great deal better anything we could have done.\\"Gourlay, Jharna. Florence Nightingale and the Health of the Raj. Ashgate Publishing Limited, 1934, p. 241. In addition to his work traveling throughout India visiting various missionaries and influential figures, Murdoch was involved in the organization of several missionary conferences. The most notable conference which Murdoch played a large part in forming was the first Decennial Missionary Conference held in 1872 at Allahabad. This conference was open to all the Protestant missionary societies of India and would become a regular reoccurring event, being held every ten years. Murdoch was one of three men given the task of compiling a report on the conference, but due to unforeseen circumstances, his two coworkers were unable to help with this task and the job of compiling the report felt completely to him.Morris, Henry. The Life of John Murdoch, LL.D. The Christian Literature Society for India, 1906, p. 119. In addition to compiling the report, Murdoch also presented a paper on education and Christian literature. Later in his career, he also took part in the second and third Decennial Missionary Conferences as well as the first United Conference. In 1867, the committee of the Religious Tract Society invited Murdoch to oversee their work in India in addition to his duties with the CLS, a position that Murdoch readily accepted as it enabled him to have direct access to every form of distribution of Christian literature in India.Morris, Henry. The Life of John Murdoch, LL.D. The Christian Literature Society for India, 1906, p. 96. It was also during that time that the University of Glasgow, in appreciation of his work in spreading Christian literature throughout India, conferred upon him the honorary degree of LL.D on 9 February 1871. =Final years= During the final years of his life, Murdoch primarily busied himself with the work which had occupied much of his previous career, that of the inspection of the various projects that the CLS were overseeing in India.Morris, Henry. The Life of John Murdoch, LL.D. The Christian Literature Society for India, 1906, p. 130. He also made several trips back to England with the intention of promoting the need for greater Christian literature in the various missionary ventures that were taking place during this time period. On 5 February 1903 Murdoch resigned the position of Agent and Secretary of the Madras Branch of the CLS to Henry Gulliford, desiring to spend more time producing Christian literature.Morris, Henry. The Life of John Murdoch, LL.D. The Christian Literature Society for India, 1906, p. 149. In 1896 Murdoch was bestowed the silver medal of the order Kaiser-i-Hindi by the Government of India due to his service to the Indian Empire. Eight years later a gold medal of the same order was bestowed upon him yet while he learned of this honor, he did not live to receive it. John Murdoch died on 10 August 1904 after being severely weakened by an attack of pneumonia the previous month. He died peacefully in a nursing home located in Madras, India the country where he had spent the past 60 years of his life writing and traveling.Morris, Henry. The Life of John Murdoch, LL.D. The Christian Literature Society for India, 1906, p. 160.  Writings  As the majority of his career was spent in the development of Christian literature, Murdoch is best remembered for his own literary works. He wrote primarily for educated Indians and as English is one of the primary languages of India, he wrote in his own native tongue. When he was associated with the CLS his writings were published under authorship of the society and as such he is best known for works which he wrote and published outside of their influence. Murdoch took issue with the Theosophical lectures of Annie Besant which he believed were misguiding Hindus.Morris, Henry. The Life of John Murdoch, LL.D. The Christian Literature Society for India, 1906, pp. 229-230. He authored several books debunking the claims of the Theosophical Society, these were Theosophy Unveiled (1885), Theosophy Exposed (1893) and The Theosophic Craze (1894). He has been described as an \\"inveterate critic\\" of Theosophy.Wickremeratne, L. A. (1969). Religion, Nationalism, And Social Change in Ceylon, 1865-1885. Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland 56: 125. One of his most notable works is Indian Missionary Manual: Hints to Young Missionaries to India, with Lists of Books which he wrote based upon his experiences traveling around India and visiting missionaries as part of his responsibilities as agent for the CLS. In it \\"he even presumed (rigid bachelor as he was) to give good advice to the ladies, of course, having profited by what he learned from experienced Missionary wives beforehand.\\"Ferguson, John. The \\"Literary Evangelist\\" of India and Ceylon: John Murdoch, LL.D. The University of Manchester, The John Rylands University Library, 1898, p. 8. He also diligently kept a journal throughout his life and various extracts of this account can be found in his bibliography as recorded in Henry Morris' The Life of John Murdoch LL.D. One of the criticisms that has been leveled against Murdoch's literary work is that while he is correct in his assessment of the cultural situation of India, he was generally unflattering in his depiction of the Hindu faith,Sharpe, Eric. Biographical Dictionary of Christian Missions. Ed. Gerald H. Anderson. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1999, p. 481. referring to them as 'dreamy' or 'speculative',Morris, Henry. The Life of John Murdoch, LL.D.

R. & Lievens, F. 2008. \\"Personnel selection.\\" Annual Review of Psychology, 59, 419-450 In other words, incremental validity seeks to answer if the new test adds much information that might be obtained with simpler, already existing methods.Lillenfield et al. 2005 \\"What's wrong with this picture?\\" www.psychologicalscience.org http://www.psychologicalscience.org/newsresearch/publications/journals/sa1_2.pdf Definition and examples When an assessment is used with the purpose of predicting an outcome (perhaps another test score or some other behavioral measure), a new instrument must show that it is able to increase our knowledge or prediction of the outcome variable beyond what is already known based on existing instruments. A positive example may be a clinician who uses an interview technique as well as a specific questionnaire to determine if a patient has mental illness and has better success at determining mental illness than a clinician who uses the interview technique alone. Thus, the specific questionnaire would be considered incrementally valid. Because the questionnaire in conjunction with the interview produced more accurate determinations, and added information for the clinician, the questionnaire is incrementally valid. Statistical tests Incremental validity is usually assessed using multiple regression methods. A regression model with other variables is fitted to the data first and then the focal variable is added to the model. A significant change in the R-square statistic (using an F-test to determine significance) is interpreted as an indication that the newly added variable offers significant additional predictive power for the dependent variable over variables previously included in the regression model. Recall that the R-square statistic in multiple regression reflects the percent of variance accounted for in the Y variable using all X variables. Thus, the change in R-square will reflect the percent of variance explained by the variable added to the model. The change in R-square is more appropriate than simply looking at the raw correlations because the raw correlations do not reflect the overlap of the newly introduced measure and the existing measures. An example this method is in the prediction of college grade point average (GPA) where high school GPA and admissions test scores (e.g., SAT, ACT) usually account for a large proportion of variance in college GPA. The use of admissions tests is supported by incremental validity evidence. For example, the pre-2000 SAT correlated .34 with freshman GPA while high school GPA correlated .36 with freshman GPA. It might seem that both measures are strong predictors of freshman GPA, but in fact high school GPA and SAT scores are also strongly correlated, so we need to test for how much predictive power we get from the SAT when we account for high school GPA. The incremental validity is indicated by the change in R-square when high school GPA is included in the model. In this case, high school GPA accounts for 13% of the variance in freshman GPA and the combination of high school GPA plus SAT accounts for 20% of the variance in freshman GPA. Therefore, the SAT adds 7 percentage points to our predictive power. If this is significant and deemed an important improvement, then we can say that the SAT has incremental validity over using high school GPA alone to predict freshman GPA. Any new admissions criterion or test must add additional predictive power (incremental validity) in order to be useful in predicting college GPA when high school GPA and test scores are already known.

The solder that is partially coalesced looks like a cluster of grapes which is where the phenomenon‚Äôs name is derived.\\" Present and future solder technologies: how new powders, activator chemistries and epoxy fluxes are evolving for production use.\\" Graping Phenomenon  Causes  Graping occurrence has continued to increase since it was first identified in 2006. The viscosity of the flux decreases as the temperature of the reflow oven increases. Lead-free reflow soldering temperatures are higher which results in more graping. Graping is also caused by increased surface oxidation. The increased surface oxidation is the result of smaller printed paste deposit volumes that cause a diminished surface area to flux ratio of the solder particle resulting in flux exhaustion. While solder paste can be manufactured using any size range, there has been a move towards finer particle sizes, especially for fine feature stencil printing. Finer particle sizes places added pressure on the solder paste flux to remove surface oxides which leaves the outside of the joint not fully coalesced producing the irregular surface finish known as graping.\\" Best Practices Reflow Profiling for Lead-Free SMT Assembly\\"  Resolutions  The graping phenomenon can be resolved utilizing proper solder materials in addition to correct reflow profile settings. Solder powders are available that provide a tighter distribution range as well as a high oxidation barrier. This barrier not only improves the paste release from the stencil, but also provides an ideal surface area-to-volume ratio. These solder powder characteristics help to eliminate the graping phenomenon. Future solder paste flux formulations provide sufficient activity paired with re-oxidation mitigation capabilities. This pairing means that graping can be resolved as it occurs which is ideal for miniaturization processes. There are also steps to take when setting up your reflow profile to reduce the amount of heat exposure to the solder paste during the reflow process and prevent graping. * Opt for a ramp to peak profile as opposed to a soak profile. * Adjust the belt speed to decrease the total time in oven to a recommended ramp rate of 1 ¬∞C/second from ambient to peak. * Utilize a peak temperature ranging from 235¬∞-240 ¬∞C. * Cut back the time above liquidus (TAL) to 40‚Äì60 seconds.Solder Reflow Profiling Tips - Graping  References  Soldering defects ","title":"Graping"},{"id":"30892048","text":"St Wilfrid's Church (2017) St Wilfrid by Eric Gill (1939) Interior (2014) St Wilfrid's Church, Halton was designed by Albert Randall Wells and built between 1937 and 1939.

After a short apprenticeship, in 1808 he went to Paris where he became a student of the medalist and mint supervisor Jean-Pierre Droz. At the same time, he studied sculpture with Charles-Antoine Bridan and worked for some time with his relative Louis L√©opold Robert in the atelier of David. In 1813 he was awarded the Grand Prix de Rome for his work ‚ÄúTheseus, der die Waffen seines Vaters auffindet‚Äù (Theseus discovers his father's weapons). He then, via his home, went to Italy as a pensioner of the Villa Medici. There he distinguished himself with a series of works, and when he left Rome in 1817, it was with an appointment as chief designer and engraver to the mint in Berlin. In 1824, he became professor and member of the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin. Brandt's numerous works are distinguished by beauty and clarity of line. His earliest work, a medal honoring Napoleon, was completely in the French style. Later he worked more in the style of Christian Daniel Rauch. This later style is seen in his last work honoring Alexander von Humboldt. Thanks to Brandt, the Berlin mint's production was much improved. A complete catalogue of the medals he designed may be found in the publications of the Berlin Academy for 1845.

It is a part of a pension system of most developed countries, specifically the so called zero or first pillar of the pension system, which is a part of state social security system. The social pension is different from other types of pension since its eligibility criteria do not require former contributions of an individual, but citizenship or residency and age or other criteria set by government.  History  The need for a social pension comes from the times of industrial revolution, when the new economic system boosted the mobility of workers, but loosened ties between family members, whose solidarity was protecting people from personal economic deprivation. This, alongside with impractical voluntary thrift and insurance, resulted in many workers retiring without any source of income. The first step in forming cash transfers to elderly can be seen in the end of 19th century. One of the first countries that introduced a social pension was Germany in 1889 by its chancellor Otto von Bismarck who wanted to connect ordinary workers with the newly created German state and granted every worker who reached age of 65 a small flat pension. At first it was funded by taxes on tobacco monopoly. In 1890s followed Denmark (1891) and New Zealand (1898) and in the early 20th century Australia (1908), Sweden (1913) and many others. Throughout the 20th century, most of countries were deciding between two paths based on the strategy of the system ‚Äì a minimum pension for the elderly or securing income maintenance either by taxed subsidized voluntary pension and compulsory income-related pension. This resulted in convergence to a dual system where both of those strategies were included. Today, more than 100 countries grant social pension to its citizens in various forms and on average OECD countries spend 7 ‚Äì 8 per cent of their GDP on the pensions for elderly and elderly care.  Reasons  The reasons for implementing a social pension and involvement of the government are problems that are left with voluntary steps of individuals providing themselves enough funds for their retirement or with market failures, leaving inequalities in the society. As an example, we can see a shortsightedness of individuals, which causes lack of savings or additional income when they retire. This can be connected also with an information gap, when the individual is not able to assess the solvency of savings and insurance companies or productivity of investment programs. Another reason can be insurance market failures, such as moral hazard or adverse selection, which can make insurance against risks, such as longevity or disability, unavailable.  Financing  Financing the social pension is a part of national fiscal and public finance policies and therefore it is linked to the general government budget. Generally, the social pension schemes as a part of the first pillar of pension systems use pay-as-you-go scheme (PAYG), which collects contributions in form of social security taxes every year in an amount which should be equal to the expected expenditures in the same year. This means that the system does not accumulate any reserves and if so, then only to avoid liquidity problems.CICHON, Michael, et al. Financing social protection. International Labour Organization, 2004. The PAYG system is sometimes subject to demographic and political problems (e. g. aging of population).  Categories  1) Universal pension (also referred to as \\"demogrant\\", \\"categorical pension\\" or \\"citizens pension\\") is a pension where the only criteria for receiving it is age and citizenship, resp. residence. Some countries are specifying these criteria further, like Netherlands which require 50 years of residency between ages of 15 and 65 for a full pension and discounts it for every missing year by 2 per cent. This type of pension might be taxable. 2) Universal minimum pension in some way overlaps the universal pension. The main difference is that the purpose of this system is to grant additional financial resources to those, who did not or could not secure themselves income high enough from the contributory second pillar of pension scheme, and therefore grants them minimum base income when they retire. The voluntary third pillar is not accounted for in this case. This system was first developed in Sweden in 1913. In addition, some countries, like Norway or Finland, have introduced s so caller \\"taper\\" which grants pensioners some additional non-contributory income, even if they already earn the minimum pension. For example, in Finland with 50 per cent taper, you can earn a pension double the amount of the minimum pension before you lose the right to the non-contributory benefit. 3) Recoverable social pension is a universal pension in terms of eligibility. The difference is that this pension is added to other taxable income and is a subject to recovery by a surcharge. 4) Social assistance pension covers all other types of social pension. It can be further divided by its means test, based on whether it is applied only on the individual or his whole household. Since the most important test considers the total income and assets possessed by an individual or the household, there can be a huge difference between those two types. In the individual means test, only the wealth of the individual matters and therefore it can better address individual poverty issues. The household means test considers the capability of other family members to take care of the retired members.  Coverage across the world  Since 2000, the coverage of legal and effective social pension has been constantly increasing, especially in recent years. Between years 2015 and 2017 more than 90 per cent of elderly were receiving their benefits in 34 countries. The number of countries, where the effectives social pension coverage was less than 20 per cent, fell to 36. In the same period universal social pensions were established in many developing countries in Africa (Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and Zanzibar), Asia (East Timor) and Latin America (Bolivia). In contrast to that, Azerbaijan, Albania or Greece experienced a reduction in social pension coverage by 12-16 percentage points. = Philippines = Social Pension Program for Indigent Senior Citizens (SPISC) is a program for funding indigent senior citizens in Philippines.

It is the 12th deepest cave in the United States and features the deepest, unobstructed pit in the continental US named Fantastic Pit. The cave is over 12 miles long and extends 1063 feet vertically. Pits Ellison's features a number of underground vertical pitches including the two deepest pits in the contiguous United States: Fantastic (586 feet) and Incredible (440 feet). These two pits lie on opposite sides of the cave. Nearby and parallel to Fantastic are Smokey I (500 feet), Smokey II (262 feet), and other extremely deep pitches. There are over 7 routes to reach the bottom level of the cave from the Fantastic side. Geology Ellison's is a solution cave in the Ridge and Valley geologic region of northwest Georgia and lies within a bedrock fault in Pigeon Mountain. During the Ordovician Period, tectonic subduction responsible for forming the Appalachians left a number of seismically active fault lines stretching from northern Alabama to eastern Tennessee. Continued orogeny created a large fault zone in the bedrock throughout the southern Appalachians and northern Georgia. This fracturing along with the proliferation of gypsum and limestone contributes to the exceptional depth of Ellison's. Incidents March 10, 1999 - A caver climbing the Incredible pit became tangled in multiple ropes and was stranded 140 feet off the cave floor underneath water falling into the pit. The incident resulted in fatality due to hypothermia. * February 12, 2011 - Two University of Florida students died of hypothermia after becoming stuck on rope near a waterfall close to the bottom of 125 ft Warm-up pit. It was reported that the students were underexperienced and underprepared for the cave. * May 26, 2013 - A caver was rescued and hospitalized after falling 40 feet in the cave.

This painting is in the Pilgrim Hall Museum, Plymouth, Massachusetts. Edward Tilley (c. 1588 ‚Äì c. winter of 1620/1621) traveled in 1620 on the historic voyage of the ship Mayflower as a Separatist member of the Leiden, Holland contingent. He was a signatory to the Mayflower Compact, and died with his wife in the first Pilgrim winter in the New World.Caleb H. Johnson, The Mayflower and her passengers (Indiana: Xlibris Corp., 2006), p. 234A genealogical profile of Edward Tilley, (a collaboration of Plimoth Plantation and New England Historic Genealogical Society accessed 2013)  In England  Edward Tilley was baptized in Henlow, co. Bedford, England on May 27, 1588. He was the son Robert and Elizabeth Tilley. Edward Tilley and Ann (or Agnes) Cooper married on June 20, 1614 in Henlow, co. Bedford, she having been baptized there on November 7, 1585. As with his brother John, Edward married a woman a few years his senior, which was unusual for the time. Their pastor in Leiden, John Robinson, spoke against such marriages, stating it was best for men not to marry older women. Edward Tilley and his wife likely resided in Henlow, Bedfordshire until they emigrated to Holland a few years after their marriage.  Life in Leiden  Shortly after their marriage Edward and his wife went to live in Leiden, Holland. They appeared in a 1616 Leiden record where he was reported to be a weaver as with a number of other Leiden Separatists, and future Mayflower passengers. There is an indication that Edward's brother John Tilley was also in Leiden along with Edward's ward Henry Samson.Pilgrim Hall Museum Henry Samson, p. 2 (1)' p. 6 (2) )  On the Mayflower  Signing the Mayflower Compact 1620, a painting by Jean Leon Gerome Ferris 1899 Edward and Ann Tilley came aboard the Mayflower without any children but oddly in company with two young relatives of Ann's ‚Äì her sixteen-year-old nephew Henry Samson and her one-year-old niece Humility Cooper. The reason those two children were with them has not been fully explained.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 362Charles Edward Banks, The English Ancestry and Homes of the Pilgrim Fathers: who came to Plymouth on the Mayflower in 1620, the Fortune in 1621, and the Anne and the Little James in 1623, (Baltimore: Genealogical Publishing Co., 2006), p. 49, 79 Per William Bradford's later recollection of this family: \\"Edward Tillie, and Ann, his wife; and *2* children that were their cossens, Henery Samson and Humility Coper.\\"Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 406 The Mayflower departed Plymouth, England on September 6/16, 1620. The small, 100-foot ship had 102 passengers and a crew of about 30-40 in extremely cramped conditions. By the second month out, the ship was being buffeted by strong westerly gales, causing the ship's timbers to be badly shaken with caulking failing to keep out sea water, and with passengers, even in their berths, lying wet and ill. This, combined with a lack of proper rations and unsanitary conditions for several months, attributed to what would be fatal for many, especially the majority of women and children. On the way there were two deaths, a crew member and a passenger, but the worst was yet to come after arriving at their destination when, in the space of several months, almost half the passengers perished in cold, harsh, unfamiliar New England winter.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 413 On November 9/19, 1620, after about three months at sea, including a month of delays in England, they spotted land, which was the Cape Cod Hook, now called Provincetown Harbor. After several days of trying to get south to their planned destination of the Colony of Virginia, strong winter seas forced them to return to the harbor at Cape Cod hook, where they anchored on November 11/21. The Mayflower Compact was signed that day.George Ernest Bowman, The Mayflower Compact and its signers, (Boston: Massachusetts Society of Mayflower Descendants, 1920), Photocopies of the 1622, 1646 and 1669 versions of the document, pp. 7-19.  In the New World  Upon arrival at Cape Cod, he was a signatory to the Mayflower Compact, signing as \\"Edward Tilly.\\" He and his brother John both signed the Compact with the \\"Tilly\\" surname.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), pp. 411-413 During the first weeks after arrival in the New World, Edward Tilley was an active participant, often with his brother John, in the various exploring parties of late November and early December 1620 while the Mayflower was anchored at Cape Cod. The same day the Mayflower Compact was signed, November 11, 1620, about fifteen or sixteen men made their first landing ashore at the tip of Cape Cod for the purpose of making a short exploration. Although names were not recorded, this party may have included Edward Tilley as did future ones. Several days later, on November 15, 1620, sixteen men, \\"every man his musket, sword and corslet (corselet ‚Äì light body armor)\\" departed on a more thorough exploration of the Cape from its tip down through the Pamet River. Edward Tilley was named as a member of this exploring party, and specially made a participant with William Bradford and Stephen Hopkins to give \\"advice and counsel\\" to the militia captain, Myles Standish. They did encounter some Indians, who ran off into the woods to be followed by them for about ten miles, and later made camp for the night. They found some sand heaps where the Indians had buried seed corn for the following year and named the place Corn Hill. The Pilgrims made the decision to take the seed corn, saying that they would repay the owners when it could be ascertained who the seed corn owners were.Caleb H. Johnson, The Mayflower and her passengers (Indiana: Xlibris Corp., 2006), pp. 234-235Nathaniel Philbrick, Mayflower: A story of Courage, Community and War (New York: Viking 2006), pp. 57-65 Later in November a second expedition with thirty-four men set out to do a more thorough exploration of the Pamet River and Corn Hill area and although the names of those who participated were not recorded, it might be presumed the Edward Tilley, and possibly his brother John, were also involved.Caleb H. Johnson, The Mayflower and her passengers (Indiana: Xlibris Corp., 2006), p. 235 A third exploration of the Cape Cod area, with eighteen men, set out on December 6, 1620, but this time, many members of previous expeditions were not available, having been felled by illness. Both Edward Tilley and his brother John were among those specifically named in records of that expedition. The Pilgrims were ill-prepared for the bitter New England winter weather and encountered \\"very cold and hard weather‚Ä¶in which time two were very sick, and Edward Tilley had like to have sounded with a cold; the gunner was sick unto death, and so remained all that day, and the next night.\\" The expedition lasted several days, during which time they were attacked by a group of Nauset Indians, but escaped without harm. That episode with the Indians would later be known as the First Encounter. The Pilgrims explored what would eventually become the Plymouth area, and finally after a month of searching, decided that it was there they would come ashore and build their settlement.Caleb H. Johnson, The Mayflower and her passengers copyright 2006 Caleb Johnson Xlibris Corp.) pp. 235-236Nathaniel Philbrick, Mayflower: A story of Courage, Community and War (New York: Viking 2006), pp. 70-73 Exploring ill-clad in constant freezing weather with often wet clothing would take its toll on Edward Tilley who never did recover from the illness that he contracted just prior to the beginning of the third expedition. The exploring often involved wading from boat to shore through icy ocean water in freezing temperatures. Edward Tilley likely died in January, probably as a result of an initial cold which became pneumonia as time went along. Edward's wife Ann met her demise sometime following his death, but the two relatives of Ann in their care, Humility Cooper and Henry Samson, survived. The Tilleys had no recorded children of their own.  Unaccompanied relatives traveling with Edward Tilley and his wife Anne  Edward Tilley and Ann (or Agnes) Cooper were married in Henlow, co. Bedford, England on June 20, 1614. She a daughter of Edmund and Mary (Wyne) Cooper of Henlow, Bedfordshire.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620-1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 272 Edward and Ann Tilley had no known children, but oddly were the caretakers of two children, Humility Cooper and Henry Samson, who were the niece and nephew of Ann, and had apparently been given over to the Tilleys in Leiden. The children survived in the care of other families after Edward and Ann Tilley died. *Humility Cooper was born about 1619 in Holland to Robert Cooper and his wife Joan (Gresham). She was the niece of Edward Tilley's wife Ann, and apparent daughter of Ann's brother Robert Cooper, who may have been a resident of Leiden, Holland at the time of the Mayflower sailing. Why she was in custody of the Tilleys is unknown ‚Äì possibly her mother was deceased, and if she was an orphan, Ann Tilley, being childless, may have assumed custody in place of the child's mother.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620‚Äì1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), p. 273Pilgrim Hall Museum Humility Cooper :If William Bradford, writing in 1651, was correct about her death stating that she \\"dyed ther\\", Humility Cooper apparently died in England sometime between her baptism in 1638/9 and the time of Bradford‚Äôs 1651 record.Eugene Aubrey Stratton, Plymouth Colony: Its History and People, 1620‚Äì1691, (Salt Lake City: Ancestry Publishing, 1986), pp. 273, 409Caleb H.

Bedford on January 15, 1603/4 and was a son of James Samson and his wife Martha (Cooper), a sister of Ann, wife of Edward Tilley. Why Henry was in the custody of the Tilleys is unknown ‚Äì he may have been apprenticed out to his uncle Edward Tilley. Henry's parents and siblings remained in Henlow, Bedfordshire. :It is unknown who cared for Henry after the deaths of Edward and Ann Tilley. Henry Samson became a freeman in Plymouth in 1635 and married Ann Plummer there on February 6, 1635/6. They had a total of nine children. Henry Samson made his will on December 24, 1684 and died on January 3, 1685 in Duxbury at age 81. He and his wife Anne were buried at Cole's Hill Burial Ground in Plymouth, Massachusetts.Caleb H.

But the youth Henery Samson is still living, and is married, and hath *7* children.\\" Both Edward and his wife Ann were buried in Coles Hill Burial Ground in Plymouth likely sometime in January, 1621.

It was first isolated and characterized in 1989. When garlic is stored for long periods of time, it can form visible accumulations of crystalline allixin on its surface, particularly in areas where tissue has become necrotic. After 2 years of storage, the amount of allixin accumulated can approach 1% of the dry weight of the cloves. Since allixin has weak antimicrobial activity, these high concentrations are thought to be produced by the garlic bulb to protect itself from further damage from microorganisms. Since allixin is found in high concentrations in garlic, there has been scientific interest in determining if it is responsible for any of the known health benefits of garlic. As a result of ongoing research, a variety of biological activities have been attributed to allixin. Pharmaceutical drug discovery research based on derivatives of allixin has followed. Laboratory synthesis Two laboratory syntheses of allixin have been developed. In the first method, reported in 1997, allixin was synthesized in 22 steps starting from D-mannose. A shorter synthesis was developed in 1998 which involved only 5 steps, starting from 5-methylfurfural.  Biological activities In in vitro studies, allixin demonstrates neurotrophic activity, but at high concentrations it has cytotoxic effects. Simple chemical analogs of allixin were found to have more potent neurotrophic activity, but without the cytotoxic effects. Allixin may therefore be a useful starting point for the development of pharmaceutical drugs for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders or for neuronal regeneration in the brain. Pharmacological studies have demonstrated that allixin exerts an anti- promoting activity against skin tumors induced by the chemical 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and an inhibitory effect on aflatoxin B1-induced mutagenesis. Allixin may therefore be responsible, at least in part, for the tumor-preventative effects of garlic extract. Allixin has also been shown to have a radical scavenging effect. Metal complexes Metal complexes with allixin have been shown to have beneficial pharmacological effects in animal models of diabetes. A complex with vanadium, bis(allixinato)oxovanadium(IV), is a potent anti-diabetic agent. In studies in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice, this vanadium complex was shown to be an insulin mimetic with hypoglycemic effects. Similarly, a zinc-allixin complex, bis(allixinato)zinc(II), shows the same insulin mimetic effects. The mechanism of action by which these complexes regulate insulin signaling pathways is unclear.

ISSN 0891-1851 Design and development The X-Air started as a development of the Chotia Weedhopper redesigned to incorporate ailerons and an enclosed cabin. After initial production in Europe manufacturing was shifted to Raj Hamsa in India. In many countries the aircraft is known as the Rand Kar X-Air. In the USA it is sometimes referred to as the Light Wing X-Air. The aircraft was later developed into the more conventional X-Air Hanuman, which relocated the engine from the upper keel tube to the nose. The X-Air is built from bolted aluminium tubing, mated to a central welded steel cockpit cage. The wings and tail surfaces are covered in pre-sewn Dacron sailcloth envelopes. The aircraft is built around its keel, a large tube that runs from the high-mounted engine in the front to the tail in the back. The wings are supported by V-struts with jury struts. The landing gear incorporates oleo shock absorbers on all three wheels. The nosewheel is steerable and mainwheel brakes are standard. Dual controls are standard, but cockpit doors are optional. The cockpit has been criticized by reviewer Andre Cliche as \\"a bit difficult to access\\". The X-Air can be fitted with either floats or skis. Engines from can be fitted, provided they weigh under . The construction time is estimated at 40 hours.

Through the NBCC, the ABCC is part of the Baptist World Alliance (BWA). Its headquarters, Kohima, is the second station of the American Baptist Foreign Missionary Society in Nagaland.  History  In 1878 Mrs. and Rev. C. D. King,Rev. C. D. King in Angami Territory pdf the first American Baptist Missionary to the Angamis arrived in Ch√ºmoukedima. But they had to flee back to Sibsagar due to the hostilities between the Angamis and the British. After the British finally established their administrative headquarters at Kohima in 1879, Mrs. and Rev C. D. King arrived in Kohima on 25 February 1881 with the Gospel. On March 29, 1883, the Kohima Baptist Church was established. In 1885, four Angamis from Kohima accepted Christ and were baptized. Unfortunately, when the King family left for the USA because of health reasons, these early believers left the faith. However, in 1887 Mrs. Hattie and Dr. Sidney W. Rivenburg transferred from Molung, Assam, Nagaland to Kohima to restart the work. After laboring for five years, they saw their first convert. And thereafter slowly but steadily men and women from other villages started coming to Christ. Mrs. Hattie E. Rivenburg died in Kohima and is buried on the A.B.C.C. compound. Dr. Rivenburg continued to work among the Angami people until 1923.[Star of the Naga Hills, Narola Rivenburg, American Baptist Publication Society, Philadelphia, 1941.]  Present day ABCC  As of 2011, the Council has 105 Churches with about 31,032 baptized members and 40 ordained ministers and 42 licentiate pastors.NBCC Statistics The Council runs three institutions- Baptist High, Baptist College and Shalom Bible Seminary. The Council has 6 Departments- Women, Youth, Men, Christian Education & Literature, Missions, Property & Socio-Economic Development. Dr. Atsi Dolie is the present Executive Director of the Council. The ABCC celebrated its 125 years125 Years of Christianity in Angami Land of ministry at Kohima on February 2010. During the four-day celebration (3rd to 7th February 2010), the Council donated $8,744ABCC contribution towards Haiti Relief towards Haiti earthquake relief.  Theology and practice  As a member of the Universal Body of the Lord Jesus Christ, the ABCC believes in the: * Priesthood of all Believers. * One personal God, eternally existent in three persons - Father, Son and Holy Spirit.  The Bible as the Word of God is the divine inspiration, authentic and final authority, sufficient for our faith. * Freedom from every kind of Slavery * Believers Baptism through immersion. = Church and State = The ABCC is not against the political aspirations of the Naga people but, with the NBCC, the ABCC is against and will oppose the unbiblical ideologies and means to attain those aspirations. Affirming the State-Church separation, the ABCC resolved not to participate in state/political group sponsored programs that undermines the State-Church separation.  Missions and affiliated organizations  = Mission Department = The Mission Department was established in 1980. At present the Council has 41 Missionaries and 20 Native Evangelists serving in different fields. * International Fields: Nepal, Thailand, Mongolia, Sudan (South Africa), Gambia (South Africa), Cambodia, Bhutan, Myanmar, China. * National Fields: Sikkim, Chandigarh, Assam, Nagaland-Assam Border. * Fields in Nagaland: Reaching Non-locals in Dimapur and Kohima. * Fields in partnership with other Missions agencies: West Bengal, Bangalore, Manipur, Nsong, Mumbai, and Delhi. = Youth Department = The Angami Baptist Youth Department (ABYD) was officially established in 1932 with the missionary Rev. J. E. Tanquist and his wife Mabel Tanquist. Initially it was called Angami Christian Endeavour Union (ACEU). The ABYD celebrated its 75 Years of ministry in the year 2007 at Khonoma. The objective of ABYD is to help and equip the Youth members to share their faith with others as well as to develop second line leadership for evangelism. Focusing on this, the ABYD organizes seminars and trainings every year. One of the notable contributions by the ABYD is in the area of Music. Currently, the department is emphasizing on Sports Ministry and True Love Waits (TLW) seminars in order to reach the youth members even outside the Church. = Seminaries and Colleges = Apart from evangelism and other Church activities, as part of its endeavor towards spiritual development, the ABCC gives equal importance to human resources development with Christian values. Towards this, there are three (3) institutions: * Baptist High:Baptist High Kohima celebrates Golden Jubilee Established in 1959, it is a Higher Secondary School in Science stream. * Baptist College:Baptist College Kohima Established in 1982, the College offers Bachelor‚Äôs Degree in Arts and Commerce streams. * Shalom Bible Seminary (SBS): Established in 1996, SBS offers B.Th. and M.Div. Degrees.  Angami (Tenyidie) Bible  = History = Bible Translation works happened to be one of the priorities of the American missionaries. The first translation of the Book of Matthew was started by Rev. C. D. King. However, he could not complete as he left for home. Later, it was translated by Rev. Dr. S. W. Rivenburg in 1890. He also translated the Books of John and Acts. Miss Narola, the daughter of Rivenburg, translated the Book of Mark in 1915. In the same year the Book of Luke was translated by Rev. J.E. Tanquist. Revelation, the last Book of the New Testament was translated in 1918. Consequently, through the efforts or the missionaries and native leaders, the New Testament was brought out in 1927. Translation of the Old Testament started around 1940, and a good portion was translated. But during the Battle of Kohima in 1944, all the manuscripts were lost. Vigorous translation then began again and the Book of Genesis was published in 1950. However most of the manuscripts (of the remaining books) were again destroyed during the Indo-Naga conflicts in 1956. = The Release of the Angami (Tenyidie) Bible = In 1966 the Angami Baptist Women took the initiative in helping translation works again. The long expected Tenyidie Bible of the Angami Nagas was finally released and presented on 20 December 1970, with a huge congregation of thanksgiving, held at Kohima Local Baptist Church. = Fresh Translation Works = The revised edition of the New Testament was released in December 1995. With regard to the Old Testament revision, the project began in 1986. The new translation of the Old Testament was released in 2009.  See also  Nagaland Baptist Church Council * Rev.

Unais replied: > \\"I am an Arab tribesman who has heard of you and of the army you are raising > to fight Muhammad and I have come to you to join your ranks.\\" Khaled bin Sufyan trusted him. Then Unais asked to talk to him privately, once, while conversing, Abdullah ibn Unais walked a short distance with ibn Sufyan, and when an opportunity came he struck him with his sword and killed him. After killing ibn Sufyan, he cut off his head and brought that to Muhammad.

The Union is based in the centre of Dublin at 19 Parnell Square. History The foundations for the Irish Writers Union were laid in 1985 when Jack Harte, at that time principal of Lucan Vocational School, Co. Dublin, set up a writers' advisory office, availing of the Social Employment Scheme. Harte employed a secretary and two workers in this office, one of whom, Joe Jackson, went on to become Ireland's first Writer-in-Residence. From the outset, the aim of the project Harte had in mind was to establish a Writers' Union and an Irish Writers' Centre. Still working from his base in Lucan, Harte employed the poet Padraig MacGrane to collect names of writers, setting up a preliminary social network of people who could be contacted. Names and contact details were obtained in a rather informal manner, often handwritten on spare scraps of paper. With his contact list completed, in the summer of 1986 Harte sent out a letter to all those on it, outlining the plans and objectives of the proposed Union and asking the recipients if they were interested in joining. Most of those contacted expressed an interest. In the autumn of 1986, approximately 120 members-to-be met up in Buswell's Hotel, Kildare Street, Dublin to hammer out the Constitution of the Writers' Union. Over a three-hour meeting, from three to six o'clock of a Saturday afternoon, a 65-clause Constitution was worked out. The Irish Writers Union was launched on 15 December 1987 at the Guinness Brewery in Dublin, Irish Times, 16 December 1986 it's Constitution coming into effect as of 1 January 1987. Harte was its first Chairperson, a post he was to retain for three years.Irish Writers Union archives 1986-9 Among the issues facing the Union was the question of authors' rights over their work, and the rights of authors and publishers alike. From its early years, the IWU supported the idea of a model contract for writers and advised authors in this regard, helping writers negotiate their contracts with publishers. To this day, this service remains central to the activities of the Union. There was a lack of clarity around copyright in Ireland in the 1980s, and in part due to the efforts of the Irish Writers Union, the situation was clarified in keeping with international best practice. Today Irish publishing contracts accord with Ireland's Copyright & Related Rights Act, 2000 and state unambiguously that the author is the copyright holder. Censorship The censorious attitude of the Irish state towards a wide variety of publications and movies was a very restrictive one through much of the mid twentieth century; many books now considered central to Ireland's literary heritage, such as James Joyce's Ulysses, were banned from sale or distribution in Ireland. Although Brian Lenihan Snr introduced the Censorship of Publications Act, 1967 whereby the previously permanent ban on a given work was replaced by a twelve-year ban (and later a five-year ban), this did little to assist the distribution of short-lived works.Irish Statute Book In the 1980s a new Censorship of Publications Board composed of a body of retired judges started banning books afresh, among them works by Angela Carter; Alex Comfort's The Joy of Sex; and various academic volumes dealing with erotic Classical art. The ban was upheld against the protests of the Writers' Union. A member of the Senior Council offered to take up the Union's cause on a pro bono basis, on the grounds that the Board were interfering with the legitimate rights of authors to earn a living.Interview with Jack Harte, conducted 1 February 2011 The poet and IWU member Robert Gracen had known Alex Comfort from their days as medical students in Dublin and put Jack Harte in touch with Comfort. On the grounds of performing a reading from his poetry, Comfort felt able to accept an invitation to appear at Buswell's Hotel, an event at which Comfort's views as a medical doctor and scientist on the importance of being able to write about sexual matters were aired. Such acts as these chipped away at the authority of the Censorship Board and when its five-year ban expired, The Joy of Sex duly appeared on Irish bookshop shelves. Acquiring a home base From 1987 onwards, Taoiseach Charles Haughey appointed writer Anthony Cronin as his advisor for Arts policy. Although Cronin had no money to finance a centre for the Union either personally or in his political capacity, Harte presented him with a suggestion for a Writers' Centre. A large number of old Georgian houses were falling into disuse in the inner suburbs of Dublin; Harte suggested that Cronin petition that one of these be set aside as a centre for supporting and promoting Irish authors. Harte had heard about the Writers' Museum, directed by Matt McNulty; he went to McNulty asking about the possibility of establishing a Writers' Centre. McNulty provided premises for this purpose at 19 Parnell Square.Irish Times, 26 May 1992 The Writers' Centre was intended initially as a general Arts Centre. All related writers' support groups were directly involved and represented at this address, including those working with playwrights, children's writers and translators. Since then, there has been some dispersal of these roles, with playwrights (represented by the Irish Playwrights and Screenwriters Guild), for instance, being based at the Irish Film Institute on Eustace Street in Temple Bar. The renovation of the premises on Parnell Square was funded by a ¬£100,000 grant from the Irish Lottery.Jack Harte Biography Aims and accomplishments The Union states on its website that its aims are as follows: * To advance the cause of writing as a profession, and organise Irish authors. It is also the Union‚Äôs policy to provide advice and support to writers in their relations with publishers and other users of their work (including offering model contracts and providing assistance in disputes). The Union hopes thereby to achieve better remuneration and conditions for writers, while monitoring contracts and royalty payments to authors or their estates. * To provide a means for the expression of the collective opinion of writers on matters affecting their profession. * To contribute to Governmental educational policy in so far as it relates to the art of writing and the use of literature in the educational system. * To campaign against all forms of censorship. A major campaign undertaken by the Union in regard to changing government policy was to lobby throughout the early years of the twenty-first century for a Public Lending Rights scheme, in this the IWU worked closely with the European Writers Congress (EWC) and the Irish Copyright Licensing Agency (ICLA). Such a scheme came into effect with the Copyright Bill 2007, on 28 November 2007 after the European Commission had taken legal action against Ireland in the European Court of Justice for failure to implement a PLR system. It declared that Ireland breached the Lending Rights Directive 1992 by exempting all public libraries from PLR in the Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000.The 5th European Public Lending Right Conference Proceedings, 2008 One of the central concerns for the IWU was that funding of Irish PLR came directly from the Exchequer and not from public libraries' budgets and the IWU welcomed the fact that the scheme was in fact introduced on this basis.PLR Notices dead-link Membership and meetings Full membership of the IWU is open to those who have had a novel, non-fiction book or volume of poetry published, a play performed publicly, or any equivalent achievement in the literary arts. Associate membership is open to others (\\"established, struggling or forever hopeful\\") who satisfy the Committee that they are actively engaged in writing. Former and current 'honorary life members' of the IWU include Michael D Higgins, William Trevor, Robert Greacen, Liam Mac Uistin, Benedict KielyIrish Times, 14 February 2007 and Sam McAughtry. The Executive Committee of the Union meet monthly through most of the year at 19 Parnell Square and an AGM open to all members takes place annually in the same premises, usually in March. Literary events and international affiliations The Union is involved in literary events through the European Writers' Congress, and maintains links with other literary bodies throughout Europe. Its members frequently take part in literary festivals in various European countries. The IWU is a nominating body for a number of prestigious international writing awards and is frequently called upon to provide judges for national and international writing competitions.

Public concerns over gun control in Texas have increased in recent years as Mexican drug cartels continue to commit violent crimes closer to Texas' stretch of the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border. The debate over gun control laws generally produces four arguments: *Those who believe gun control laws are effective in reducing gun-related accidents and crime and should be enforced by the government. *Those who believe gun control laws are ineffective in reducing gun-related accidents and crime and thus support fewer gun control measures. *Those who believe that the private ownership of guns reduces crime. * Those who believe the individual right to self defense is inalienable, and the lawful use of firearms should not be infringed upon before thorough due process, especially in response to, or in the name of preventing, criminal acts of gun violence.  Federal gun laws  The majority of criminal justice activity in the United States takes place at the state and local levels. The U.S. federal government supports these local efforts through national leadership and financial assistance. However, the federal government has used its regulatory authority over interstate affairs to prohibit activities on a nationwide basis that are regarded as contributing to criminal activity. Title IV (State Firearms Control Assistance) and the 1968 Gun Control Act were two federal reactions to handgun violence. More recently, the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act was passed in 1993 and sets national minimum requirements for firearms purchases. The main focus of the Brady Act is to prevent felons from obtaining firearms.  Texas gun control laws  According to the Open Society Institute, generally a lobbyist for gun control & an international grantmaking network founded by business magnate George Soros, in March 2000, Texas received a score of negative six (‚àí6) when evaluated on the restrictions imposed by its gun control laws. Each state was scored on 30 criteria, with each criterion assigned a maximum numeric value between 0 and 7. States scoring highest on each criterion are considered to have the toughest gun laws. The only states scoring lower than Texas are Alaska, Louisiana, and Maine. A factor for Texas' low ranking is its lack of minimum legal age requirements for gun possession.  Gun ownership  During the 2009/2010 fiscal year, the Texas Department of Public Safety issued 123,325 concealed handgun licenses. During that same period, 622 applications were denied, 590 licenses were suspended, and 539 were revoked. Harris County issued the greatest number of licenses in Texas. Over 16%, or 20,564, of all licenses issued within Texas were issued in Harris County. = Sales and ammunition = In 2009, 11,611 weapons arrests were made in the state of Texas. Weapons is defined as the \\"violation of laws or ordinances prohibiting the manufacture, sale, purchase, transportation, possession, concealment, or use of firearms, cutting instruments, explosives, incendiary devices, or other deadly weapons.\\" This number represents a 3.9% decrease over the weapons arrests made in 2008. = Accidents and crime = Firearms Homicides in Texas 1976-2005 In 2009, 65,561 total convictions were reported to the Texas State Criminal Repository for various offenses committed by individuals age 21 and over. Of those convicted, 101 individuals held a license to carry a concealed handgun at the time the offense was committed. Although there are no definitive statistics available regarding accidental firearm discharges resulting in injuries in Texas, data compiled from various sources including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Just Facts, and the National Shooting Sports Foundation gives an approximate impression of the extent of the problem, with about 5,411 non-fatal accidental gunshot wounds occurring nationwide per year between 2007-2009.http://www.maafirm.com/blog/accidental- guns-shot-victims-can-recover-compensation.cfm  Homicides  For the period 1976‚Äì2005, two thirds of total homicides in Texas have been committed with firearms. The year with the most gun homicides was 1991 with 1,835 and has steadily been declining since then and now total firearms homicides account for less than 1,000 per year. The rate of firearms homicides per 100,000 people in Texas had declined to around 4 in the year 2000, but has risen since, to nearly 6 in 2005 (see chart). According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, in 2014, measuring the number of deaths due to injury by firearms per 100,000 of the population, Texas ranked 30th out of the 50 states and D.C. with 10.7 deaths per 100,000. Mexican drug trafficking organizations Most of the firearms violence in Mexico is perpetrated by drug trafficking organizations (DTOs) who are vying for control of drug trafficking routes to the United States and engaging in turf battles for disputed distribution territories. Hundreds of Mexican citizens and law enforcement personnel have become casualties of the firearms-related violence. DTOs operating in Mexico rely on firearms suppliers to enforce and maintain their illicit narcotics operations. Intelligence indicates these criminal organizations have tasked their money-laundering, distribution and transportation infrastructures with reaching into the United States to acquire firearms and ammunition. These Mexican DTO infrastructures have become the leading gun trafficking organizations operating in the United States. In the past two years, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has seized thousands of firearms headed to Mexico. ATF has analyzed firearms seizures in Mexico from FY 2005-07 and identified the following weapons most commonly used by drug traffickers: * 9mm pistols * .38 Super pistols * 5.7mm pistols * .45-caliber pistols * AR-15-type rifles * AK-47-type rifles = Local and international gun trade =  Guns and drugs trafficking  Gun shows are cited as a source for guns used in crime, however, gun shows represent just one of the venues that supply firearms for criminal use. Gun shows are more frequently an intermediate source of crime guns, supplying organized gun trafficking operations. A federal investigation initiated between 1996 and 1998 on illegal gun trafficking found that nearly 26,000 trafficked guns (30% of all guns linked to the investigations) had been sold at gun shows. As a general rule, one-third of crime guns recovered in most cities are purchased out of state, and another third are purchased in the same state but outside the immediate vicinity. An analysis of data for traced guns recovered in California and Texas from 2003 to 2006 showed that 49.5% were recovered within 25 miles of the initial point of sale. Data from this study also suggested that guns purchased at gun shows travel an even greater distance from the point of sale to the place of use in crime. Studies suggest that gun shows are a more likely choice for criminal gun trafficking operations, which often move guns long distances across state lines or borders with Mexico and Canada. According to the Stratfor Consultancy headquartered in Texas, > \\"to understand Mexico ºs gun problem it is necessary to recognize that the > same economic law of supply and demand that fuels drug smuggling into the > United States also fuels gun smuggling into Mexico. Black-market guns in > Mexico can fetch up to 300 percent of their normal purchase price ‚Äî a profit > margin rivaling the narcotics the cartels sell. Even if it were somehow > possible to hermetically seal the U.S.-Mexico border and shut off all the > guns coming from the United States, the cartels would still be able to > obtain weapons elsewhere ‚Äî just as narcotics would continue to flow into the > United States from other places. The United States does provide cheap and > easy access to certain types of weapons and ammunition, but as demonstrated > by groups such as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, weapons can be > easily obtained from other sources via the black arms market ‚Äî albeit at a > higher price\\".  Gun violence across the Texas-Mexico border  Growing criminal activity in Mexico, particularly in communities across the Southwest border, has raised concerns that the violence might spill over to the United States. Since 2006, United States Department of Justice's annual National Drug Threat Assessment has reported Mexican DTOs and criminal groups are the most influential drug traffickers and the greatest organizational threat to the United States. Law enforcement reporting indicates Mexican DTOs maintain drug distribution networks or supply drugs to distributors in at least 230 U.S. cities. Mexican DTOs control most of the U.S. drug market and are gaining strength in markets they do not yet control. = Homeland security = U.S. officials note the violence associated with Mexican DTOs poses a serious challenge for U.S. law enforcement, threatening citizens on both sides of the border. The Government Accountability Office also found that ATF and Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the primary agencies implementing efforts to address the issue, do not effectively coordinate their efforts, in part because the agencies lack clear roles and responsibilities and have been operating under an outdated interagency agreement. Additionally, agencies generally have not systematically gathered, analyzed, and reported data that could be useful to help plan and assess results of their efforts to address arms trafficking to Mexico. Prior to the recently released National Southwest Border Counternarcotics Strategy, the U.S. government lacked a strategy to address arms trafficking to Mexico, and various efforts undertaken by individual U.S. agencies were not part of a comprehensive U.S. government-wide strategy for addressing the problem.  Gun control  = Prevention and awareness programs = In New Mexico, a state suffering from the nation's worst injury mortality rates for many specific causes, a childhood gun safety program was designed and implemented over a four-month period in late 1990. This model has been described as a potential model to be used by other states or communities interested in childhood injury prevention. The components of the program include: *Increasing gun safety awareness through public service announcements *Increasing awareness amongst health care professionals and patients on gun safety *Reaching gun owners to help spread prevention messages *Monitoring progress and continuing the program. Physician and health care professionals have played instrumental roles in other types of injury prevention programs (including poison prevention and child motor vehicle restraint awareness) and so are seen as resources to spread messages to parents about firearm safety issues. =Political arguments= Following the Columbine school shootings on the morning of April 20, 1999, demand for more gun control measures increased from the mainstream media, including calls for restrictions on gun shows, child access prevention laws mandating the locking up of guns, and bans on assault weapons. However, some policy analysts argue that the specific gun control measures proposed in the Columbine aftermath are largely irrelevant. Others doubt that gun controls possess any preventative efficacy. In response to the Columbine shootings, a columnist of The Denver Post argued that these killers \\"would have shot their way through a metal-detection device at the schoolhouse door.\\" Conservatives also cite the methods through which the two Columbine shooters obtained their guns as examples of the inefficacy of gun controls. For example, an 18-year-old friend of the killers purchased all of the long guns used during the shootings from three different unlicensed vendors at a gun show in December 1998. Controls over gun shows were seen as irrelevant to preventing the Columbine shootings because the friend who legally purchased the long guns could have also legally purchased the very same guns in a gun store. Other progun conservatives cite a 2003 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report, which concluded that \\"there is insufficient evidence to determine the effectiveness of any of the firearms laws or combination of laws reviewed on violent outcomes.\\" Alternatively, a study in The New England Journal of Medicine claims that fewer restrictions on handguns will result in increasing numbers of injuries and deaths. When faced with public policy propositions for tougher controls over gun show transfers, or even bans on gun shows, anticontrol conservatives claim that blocking just one source of guns would not prevent a criminal from getting a gun. Advocates of gun show restrictions claim that large numbers of criminals acquire guns from professional gun traffickers, who acquire their guns from gun shows. Others have asserted that the Columbine killings could have been prevented, or at least reduced if teachers or guards were armed with guns. However, gun control supporters argue that an armed deputy sheriff arrived just five minutes after the Columbine shooting began and was still unable to stop subsequent shootings. Some gun control advocates assert that youth access to guns is attributable to the failure of gun owners, especially parents, to properly secure their guns. These advocates favor child access prevention (CAP) laws that require owners to keep their guns locked up and/or hold adult gun owners responsible if a youth accesses a poorly secured gun and causes harm with it. Conservatives argue that these laws ignore two facts: *Gun owners who store guns loaded and unlocked do so to keep them ready for use in defense against criminals *Defensive use of guns is both common and effective in preventing injury and property loss. Gun control advocates also favor CAP laws as a means of preventing gun suicides, but conservatives argue that gun suicides are commonly committed in the victim's home, where the victim is also the gun owner and therefore has access to the key or combination if the gun is locked. Like suicides, a large share of fatal gun accidents occur in the victim's home, with adults and adolescents accidentally shooting themselves. In 2003, only 51 out of 730 fatal gun accidents in the United States had victims younger than 13. Conservatives argue that publicity about the dangers of keeping unlocked guns in the home, rather than the existence of laws, may better raise awareness of the risks of storing unlocked guns. The Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, a gun control advocacy group, favored the banning of all handguns. Other advocacy groups have called for banning small, inexpensive handguns known as \\"Saturday night special\\", but conservatives believe bans on less lethal varieties of guns encourage the substitution of more lethal types of guns. These gun supporters also argue that gun bans would increase injuries and deaths if the gun bans apply to everyone (both criminals and non- criminals), based on the belief that compliance rates to the bans would be lower among criminals than non-criminals, thus implying a larger decrease in gun possession among non-criminals than criminals. Instead, conservatives believe gun restrictions should be selectively applied to high-risk subsets of the population, but not to the least lethal subtypes of firearms, as this encourages substitution.

Personal life Ivan Dumbadze's father, Anton Dumbadze, came from a commoner family, however the maiden name of Ivan's mother, Nakashidze (), is possibly of a noble Georgian tavadi origin, from the province of Guria (in the 19th century an ujezd of the Kutaisi governorate). All three brothers of Ivan Dumbadze ‚Äì Joseph, Nicholas and Samson ‚Äì also became Major-Generals in the Russian army. Dumbadze was married three times, and had two daughters and five sons. Alexander Ivanovich Dumbadze, a son from his marriage with Gurieli, was a rittmeister of the Crimean Cavalry regiment, and died in a firefight with revolutionary sailors at Sevastopol. Another son, Anton Ivanovich Dumbadze (1887‚Äì1948), a Russian Air Force captain, emigrated to France. Military career Dumbadze attended the Kutaisi classical gymnasium, after which he entered the Junker Infantry School in Tiflis on . Upon his graduation on , Dumbadze was assigned to the 18th \\"Caucasian\\" Line battalion as a praporshchik (ensign). In 1875 Dumbadze was transferred to the 162nd \\"Akhaltsikhe\\" Infantry regiment, where in 1876 he was promoted to podporuchik (second lieutenant). He took part in the Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì1878), after which he was promoted to poruchik (lieutenant). In 1879 Dumbadze was assigned to the office of the military governor, the commander of the military district of Batumi. There he was put in charge of one of the sotnia detachments in a punitive expedition against rebels in the mountainous regions of Georgia. After promotion in 1880 to the next rank of stabskapitan, Dumbadze was assigned to the Guria infantry regiment, to carry out repressions in the province which, considering the noble Gurian origin of his mother, was the land of his ancestors. There in 1882 Dumbadze personally killed two Georgian rebels and was wounded himself in that skirmish. For this deed Dumbadze was awarded the Order of St. Anna III Class with Swords and Bow. In , and was promoted to the rank of captain. Continuing operations against rebels in 1886, he received a head wound and contusion. For this, Dumbadze was awarded the Order of St. Anna II Class with Swords. In total, Dumbadze spent nine years in frontline service against Georgian insurgents. In 1887 Dumbadze was assigned to the 3rd Caucasus Native Druzhina, in which he was also appointed the chairman of the court-martial of that regiment. In , while at this rear position, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel, and in 1900 to the full colonel. In this period Dumbadze was close to some Georgian nationalist groups. On , Colonel Dumbadze assumed the command of the 16th (\\"Emperor Alexander III\\") Infantry Regiment, and remained at this position through . Military and civil head of Yalta General Dumbadze (c. 1914) Following an increased amount of social unrest in Russia after the October Manifesto of 1905, on Minister of Interior Pyotr Stolypin proclaimed a state of emergency in the popular resort city of Yalta. Both civilian executive and legislative powers (zemstvo) were suspended and transferred to General Vassily Novitsky, the Governor of Taurida. Because the governor's residence was in Simferopol, far from Yalta, Novitsky entrusted his rights as the military commandant of Yalta in to Colonel Dumbadze, for the protection of the tzar's summer residence in the Livadia neighborhood of Yalta. Historians defined the policies established at that time by Dumbadze in Yalta and Tolmachyov (a governor in Odessa) the \\"dictatorship of the Tolmachyov-Dumbadze type\\". Meanwhile, an independent contemporary encyclopedic biographer of Dumbadze states that he personally performed functions of judicial institutions, making judgments, even \\"interfering in family quarrels\\" to resolve them, calling this a \\"patriarchal\\" style of government. A common phrase in Dumbadze's biographies is that he \\"acted in Yalta quite independently, quickly and decisively, sometimes ignoring existing laws and the opinions of the Senate\\". His relations with press were also questionable. Although the Russian press was still officially censored, Dumbadze used his own additional means to suppress any criticism. When a newspaper dared to criticize him, Dumbadze immediately deported its correspondent from Crimea. In violation of both the civil laws and the norms of an officer's honor Dumbadze challenged a civilian, a local journalist Pervukhin to a duel, he bragging: \\"Now I'll get rid of him without a warrant of deportation\\". Meanwhile, under the threat of a forced closing of local newspapers or jailing of their editors, Dumbadze required mandatory publication of materials he sent them. He also provided full support to the Black Hundreds (a reactionary anti-semitic movement) and their propaganda. He enforced obligatory reading and wider distribution of their newspapers like Russkoye Znamya and Veche. The scandalous case of Privy Councillor Pyasecki went into the contemporary encyclopedical biography of Dumbadze. Living in retirement, this high-ranked nobleman (III class by the Table of ranks) was the superintendent of a local library in Yalta. Dumbadze ordered him to subscribe to abovenamed black-hundredist newspapers, and after Pyasecki refused, Dumbadze issued him an ultimatum to either join the Union of Russian People or leave the city, and this 72-year-old nobleman was expelled. Yalta was an elite resort without large factories, and thus no proletariat. So many people whom Dumbadze imprisoned, expelled from Yalta and declared political unreliable were mostly people from the middle class and even nobility. Dumbadze also admitted to publicly insulting an officer senior in rank to him, as wella as other acts of insubordination, among them insulting the Governor of Taurida, General Vassily Novitsky, who had originally entrusted Dumbadze with the power of supreme military commandant of Yalta. Novitsky acting as the senior official in the region in the absence of Dumbadze, found no legal grounds for Dumbadze's expulsion of some persons, and allowed them to return to the Crimea. As a result of disagreement between them, Novitsky was expelled from the Crimea himself. Another full general whose honor Dumbadze insulted in a public telegram was Beckmann, Governor-General of Finland. Again no significant reaction followed either from Nicholas II ‚Äì who was the Grand Prince of Finland ‚Äì or from the imperial ministries, and General of Cavalry Beckman was forced to resign. The interference of Dumbadze with the statutory procedures of interaction between the branches of state authorities, shattered the fundamentals of the state rule. Thus even Prime Minister Pyotr Stolypin who is named among supporters of Dumbadze, sometimes was forced to disavow Dumbadze's initiatives, insisting that otherwise the \\"interaction set by the law between the State Duma and the government could be substantially subverted.\\" On Dumbadze insulted the State Duma itself. After its convocation was dissolved, in a telegram to the Union of Russian People (later reprinted in all black-hundredist newspapers) Dumbadze congratulated his confederates with \\"kicking out that ghoulish Duma\\" (). Finally, in 1910 Dumbadze insulted the Governing Senate, the supreme legislative, judicial, and executive body of the Russian Empire, directly subordinated to the emperor. Senate was considering one of his civil cases at that time, and Dumbadze did not pay the stamp fee when he sent his solicitation there. Responding to meeting request from the Senate, he replied in an insulting manner that he \\"does not know any Senate...\\", does not want to pay, and \\"requests the Senate to leave him alone with its illegal demands.\\" The prosecution's case against Dumbadze for the contempt of the Senate failed, after one senator paid the required stamp duty. Assassination attempt Dumbadze was receiving death threats from the revolutionary parties, who offered him to resign or be killed. Dumbadze replied to this threats: \\"I was going to resign and already prepared report, but now I will stay at the active service, and prove that I do not fear any threats. I will devote all my life to the service to Tsar and Russia\\". On in Chukurlar village near Yalta, a bomb was dropped from the balcony of one dacha near Dumbadze's carriage when it was passing by. By most accounts Dumbadze was not injured; only a visor (peak) of his forage cap was torn off by explosion. Several monarchist publications claim variously that Dumbadze was either \\"scratched\\" or \\"suffered ear damage\\". In retaliation, Dumbadze called his troops to lay siege to the dacha. Although the bomber immediately shot himself, Dumbadze without any investigation ordered his soldiers to throw out the dacha's inhabitants, not allowing them to take any belongings with them. Soldiers then set fire to the house and did not allow the fire brigade to extinguish it until it had burned to the ground. Wrangel-Rokossovsky says that soldiers destroyed \\"even the stone foundation of the house.\\" They also broke into and looted a nearby dacha. The official statement of Dumbadze that he'll \\"destroy every building, from which anybody should shoot or throw a bomb\\" was similar to preemptive and punitive methods of suppressing the rebel highlander peasants of Georgia. Dumbadze's actions provoked widespread outrage; on Alexander Guchkov and other deputies filed III State Duma of the Russian Empire an inquiry concerning unlawful actions of Dumbadze\\". Owners of demolished houses filed lawsuits against him in the amount of 60 thousand rubles. Trial was inevitable, but Prime Minister Stolypin ordered all claims to be settled, paid as \\"incidental expenses\\" of the Ministry of Interior. Dumbadze and Black hundreds After the Russian Revolution of 1905 Dumbadze actively participated in the tumultuous events of the political life of Russia. Among the entire spectrum of political movements and parties the greatest sympathy shown by Dumbadze was aimed towards the Black Hundreds. In the eve of 1907 Christmas, on Dumbadze reserved \\"Rossiya\\" (\\"Russia\\"), one of the best hotels of Yalta, for a congress and a celebration of the \\"Union of Genuinely Russian people\\" (\\"–°–æ—é–∑ –∏—Å—Ç–∏–Ω–Ω–æ-—Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏—Ö –ª—é–¥–µ–π\\"), the extremist nationalist organization. As a head of the city administration, Dumbadze ordered the local police (as the ¬´Russian Word¬ª newspaper noted, ‚Äûin corpore‚Äù, Lat. ‚Äûin full staff‚Äù) and security to ensure the full protection of this gathering. Dumbadze also addressed the mob with a speech. As soon as \\"Union of Russian People\\" (URP), the largest Black Hundredists organization in Russia was instituted, Dumbadze established close ties with them. On the local organization of URP solemnly presented Dumbadze with a badge of membership. After that Dumbadze consistently patronized URP, providing all kinds of support including administrative pressure while imposing the distribution of their promotional materials. Antisemitism, a specific feature of URP found deep appreciation and support from Dumbadze. He imposed on the inhabitants of Yalta the obligatory reading of the Black Hundreds' newspapers. Among them ¬´Veche¬ª (¬´–í–µ—á–µ¬ª) which daily carried a slogan \\"Get out, Kikes! ‚Äî Russia is coming!\\" (¬´–ü—Ä–æ—á—å –∂–∏–¥—ã ‚Äî –†—É—Å—å –∏–¥—ë—Ç¬ª), this was replaced on with \\"The Kikes must be necessarily deported from Russia\\" (¬´–ñ–∏–¥—ã –¥–æ–ª–∂–Ω—ã –±—ã—Ç—å –≤—ã—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω—ã –∏–∑ –†–æ—Å—Å–∏–∏ –æ–±—è–∑–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ¬ª). These antisemitic appeals, bullying and unequivocal support for pogroms continued in the public life of the city. After a trip to Crimea Pyotr Stolypin told N. A. Khomyakov (the Chairman of the III Duma in 1907-1910) a touching story about their children singing in a choir offensive antisemitic ditties about O. Ya. Pergament ‚Äî baptized Jew, a lawyer and a mathematician, a deputy of the same Third Duma: N. S. Mishchenko, a deputy chairman of the Kiev provincial Department of URP assessed Dumbadze activities within the context of his party in the most laudatory expressions: According to American Jewish Year Book, in August 1915 Dumbadze denied having anti-Jewish sentimentsJULY 1, 1914, TO MAY 31, 1915 P. 59. The world notorious fame came to General Dumbadze in 1909 when he provided the concealment of justice to Alexander Dubrovin, a leader of the Union of the Russian People (URP). On in Terijoki, (now Zelenogorsk) the deputy of the I State Duma, Mikhail Herzenstein was assassinated. Investigators got evidences that the murder was organized by Yushkevich-Kraskovsky, an assistant of Dubrovin. Yushkevich-Kraskovsky worked with the killers directly at the office of URP in Petersburg, where he gave them photos of a targeted victim, money etc. Russian authorities have actively resisted the investigation and the trial (although being a constituent part of the Russian Empire, the Grand Duchy of Finland was autonomous in its internal affairs and judicial proceedings). So when a Finnish court subpoenaed Dubrovin had to Terioki Dumbadze subpoenaed to testify as a witness, Dumbadze immediately gave him a refuge in his house in Yalta. This house was located on the territory of Livadia Palace, a summer residence of the tzar, guarded by security, headed by Dumbadze himself., p.17 All the attempts to bring Dubrovin to the trial failed. The New York Times wrote on these days: Later career and death On Dumbadze was promoted to Major General. From through he was the commander of the 2nd Brigade of the 34th Infantry division, and through was listed as the commander of the 2nd Brigade of the 13th Infantry division. On he was appointed commander of the 2nd Brigade of the 13th Infantry division, and the Supreme Head of Yalta. On , by the order of the Military minister, Dumbadze was dismissed from this position in the Infantry division, and in the same month from the office of the Supreme Head of Yalta; he was seconded to the reserve of the Military minister. In December 1912, Tzar Nicholas II enlisted Dumbadze in H. I. M. Retinue, and soon, by the personal will of the tzar, Dumbadze was restored at his former position of the Supreme Head of Yalta. At this position Dumbadze received several foreign decorations, including the Persian Order of the Lion and Sun, the Bukhara orders of \\"Rising Star\\" and of \\"Golden Star\\", the Greek Order of the Saviour and the Montenegrin Order of Prince Daniel. In August 1914, Dumbadze received a special sign on the St. George's Ribbon for \\"forty years of irreproachable service\\". However, by the beginning of World War I he was ill, and was not involved in the conflict, continuing to live in Livadia. In the spring of 1916 Dumbadze underwent surgery in Kiev, which was ineffectual. On , at his own request, Dumbadze abandoned his position in the Yalta city administration, while remaining the member of the tzar's retinue. On , he died in Livadia, and was buried with both military and civilian honors.

The selection of an artist in 1896 to design the monument was highly controversial. During the monument's design phase, artist Carl Rohl-Smith died, and his memorial was finished by a number of other sculptors. The Sherman statue was unveiled in 1903. It is a contributing property to the Civil War Monuments in Washington, D.C. (added in 1978) and to the President's Park South (added in 1980), both of which are historic sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Genesis of the monument, and design controversy Sherman died on February 14, 1891. Within days, the Society of the Army of the Tennessee, a veterans' group for those who served in the Army of the Tennessee, began planning for a memorial to their late commander. At the society's annual meeting in October 1891, the members of the society resolved to ask Congress to contribute $50,000 to a memorial and to establish a Sherman Memorial Commission. On July 5, 1892, Congress enacted legislation establishing the Sherman Monument Commission. The three commission members were the president of the Society of the Army of the Tennessee, the Secretary of War, and the Commander of the United States Army. The Society of the Army of the Tennessee agreed to raise $50,000 (half the cost of the monument). The society contacted its own members as well as those of other veterans groups such as the Grand Army of the Republic, Society of the Army of the Potomac, Society of the Army of the Ohio, Society of the Army of the Cumberland, and the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. However, the fund-raising appeal netted just $14,469.91. Congress was forced to double its contribution in order to make up the difference. In 1895, the Sherman Memorial Commission issued a call for proposals. It specified an equestrian statue, and limited the competition to American artists (living at home or abroad). A committee of the National Sculpture Society agreed to judge the submissions. When the competition closed on December 31, 1894, 23 sculptors had submitted proposals. These included Paul Wayland Bartlett (plinth with deeply cut bas- relief of Sherman, War, and Study), Henry Jackson Ellicott and William Bruce Gray (an Ionic pedestal), Adrian Jones of New York (equestrian statue), Fernando Miranda (an elliptical Greek Revival temple), L. Mullgardt (a park with four columns), Charles Henry Niehaus (pedestal with exedra), Victor Olsa (pedestal with bas relief panels), William Ordway Partridge (equestrian statue), and J. Massey Rhind (a monumental pyramid). All the proposed memorials were exhibited in Washington, D.C., to large crowds. The submission by Carl Rohl-Smith generated the most popular acclaim. The National Sculpture Society (NSS) judging committee consisted of Daniel Chester French, Augustus Saint-Gaudens, and John Quincy Adams Ward. The committee narrowed the submissions down to a short list of four: Bartlett, Niehaus, Partridge, and Rhind. The submission by Carl Rohl-Smith did not make the short list. It was ranked almost dead last by the NSS committee. On May 27, the memorial commission of the Society of the Army of the Tennessee overruled the NSS judging committee and chose the Carl Rohl-Smith design. The National Sculpture Society was outraged, and protested the award strongly to the society and the press. Several newspapers also protested the award. The New York Times called the decision \\"one of the most discreditable events ever in the annals of the public art of the United States\\". Senator Edward O. Wolcott sponsored legislation to investigate the award process. Although his resolution was not successful, the Senate debate over the award process was rancorous and showed the Senate's deep distrust of \\"art experts\\". Rohl-Smith was accused of using political influence to win the commission, an accusation he vehemently denied. After two months of protests, the National Sculpture Society ceased to contest the award. Design, construction, and dedication War, a sculptural group on the east side of the monument. Carl Rohl-Smith never saw his statue completed. He died in August 1900. Although the government determined that the contract with Rohl-Smith was null after his death, the memorial committee agreed to allow Rohl-Smith's assistant and wife, Sara, to oversee the statue's completion. Mrs. Rohl-Smith asked sculptors Theo Kitson, Henry Kirke Bush- Brown, and Jens Ferdinand Willumsen to help with the statue's completion.; Later reports do not mention Bush-Brown or Willumsen's work on the monument, but Lauritz Jensen worked on the main statue, while Danish sculptor Stephen Sinding modelled the 'War and Peace figures. Sinding created plaster models for these pieces from Rohl-Smith's sketches. But upon review, the postures and sizes of the two figures were found not to harmonize with the rest of the monument. Sigvald Asbjornsen remodelled them. As Rohl-Smith had already completed three of the four soldier figures on the corners of the monument, Sigvald Asbjornsen completed the fourth. Sources differ as to whether Asbjornsen completed the artilleryman or the cavalryman. Kitson completed the medallions which depicted the corps commanders who served under Sherman. Jensen completed the four bas relief panels based on work already done by Rohl-Smith, and completed the badge (eagle) of the Army of the Tennessee as well. Gorham Brothers of Providence, Connecticut, cast the statues and medallions. The stone pedestal was designed by Rohl-Smith. Erected by April 1902, it was built by the Harrison Granite Company. The granite came from the Fletcher Granite Company of Westford, Massachusetts. The mosaic around the pedestal was designed by Rohl-Smith and constructed by the National Mosaic Company. The monument was expected to cost $90,000, but the final amount was $123,969.91. The monument was dedicated by President Theodore Roosevelt on October 15, 1903.\\"Sherman Unveiled.\\" Washington Post. October 16, 1903. The monument is located in Sherman Park. This area is where Sherman, along with President Andrew Johnson and General Ulysses Grant, reviewed the Army of the Potomac on May 23, 1865. Sherman led the parade of the Army of the Tennessee past this same site the next day. On February 18, 1904, Congress legislatively gave the name \\"Sherman Plaza\\" to the area where the monument stands. In 2011, the statue underwent a $2 million restoration. The statue is a contributing monument to the National Register of Historic Places' Civil War Monuments in Washington, D.C., which was established by Executive Order 11593 on May 13, 1971. The memorial is also a contributing element to President's Park South, an area which was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. About the monument Detail of the equestrian statue The monument is located in Sherman Plaza, which is at the intersection of 15th Street NW, Pennsylvania Avenue NW, and Treasury Place NW. The equestrian statue of General Sherman is tall, and stands atop a granite pedestal high. The War and Peace statue groups are each high. The four corner statues representing branches of the army are each tall. The March Through Georgia and Battle of Atlanta bas reliefs are each by , while the Sherman By the Campfire and Missionary Ridge bas reliefs are by in size. The sculpted badge of the Army of the Tennessee is by , while the medallion in each pair of medallions is square. From the front step to the back step, the statue is long, while the \\"terrace\\" above the steps (which surrounds the pedestal) is long. The subfoundation of the Sherman Monument was completed in December 1898. About were excavated from the site, while another of material were required to backfill and level it. Two hundred and four wooden pilings were driven into the ground to help support the monument, and of sand and fill and of concrete were used to complete the subfoundation. The pilings had to be sunk lower than anticipated due to the existence of groundwater at the site. Congress appropriated an extra $10,000 to cover the cost. Rohl-Smith designed the equestrian statue of Sherman so that it depicted him on the day he rode up Pennsylvania Avenue at the head of the Army of the Tennessee on May 24, 1865. The March Through Georgia, a bas relief panel on the north side of the monument. Four bas-relief panels adorn the sides of the monument: *North side: The March Through Georgia depicts men singing as they make their way easily through enemy territory. Sherman can be seen in the background, accompanied by staff members Colonel Lewis M. Dayton, Colonel James C. McCoy, and Captain Joseph C. Audenried. General Peter Joseph Osterhaus is to the left, and many former slaves gape in awe as Sherman's troops pass by. *South side: The Battle of Atlanta depicts Sherman and his staff listening to cannon fire at Sherman's headquarters at the Augustus Hurt (Howard) House. Among those present and identifiable are General Oliver O. Howard, General John Schofield, and Colonel Orlando Metcalfe Poe (the Chief of Engineers, who is delivering information to Sherman). In the background, the XVIth Corps is shown repulsing the attack which saved the Army of the Tennessee from defeat. In the lower left corner, an escort is arriving. This escort is intended to symbolize the troop which would take the body of General James B. McPherson from the field of battle. The badge of the Army of the Tennessee is below the bas-relief. *West side: Sherman by the Campfire depicts the recollections of Colonel S. H. M. Byers, who wrote in McClure's Magazine in August 1894 that he often saw Sherman standing or walking by a campfire at night while his men slept. *East side: Missionary Ridge depicts the Battle of Missionary Ridge on November 25, 1863. Sherman is depicted waiting for news that Major General George Henry Thomas has attacked in the middle of the battle line. Sherman's troops are shown fighting on the ridge in the background. There are two major figure groups, one on the east and one on the west side of the monument. The western group depicts War (presenting Sherman's epithet that \\"War is hell!\\") as an older woman who is tearing asunder her clothing and the straps that bind her. She is trampling on the body of a dead soldier (who lies on his back), while a vulture perches behind her feet and another spreads its wings menacingly over the dead man. The mouth of a cannon can be see poking from below the dead man's legs. The eastern group depicts Peace as a young woman naked from the waist up, the flowering branch of a fruit tree in her left hand. To her left, a nude young girl tends a wounded young boy dressed in tattered pants (a depiction of the strong caring for the weak). To the woman's right, a nude boy lies in the grass feeding a bird. There are four figures at each corner of the monument. They represent the artillery (northeast corner), infantry (northwest corner), cavalry (southeast corner), and engineers (southwest corner). Pairs of medallions depicting the army and corps commanders of the Army of the Tennessee are on each side of the monument. These pairs are: General James B. McPherson and General Oliver O. Howard, General John A. Logan and Major General Frank P. Blair, Jr., Brigadier General Grenville M. Dodge and Brigadier General Thomas E. G. Ransom, and Major General Benjamin Grierson and Brigadier General Andrew Jackson Smith. Rohl-Smith designed the monument to have two low steps, and for a mosaic wide to surround the monument. But Rohl-Smith did not complete the design for the mosaic before his death. His wife, Sara Rohl-Smith, designed the actual mosaic pattern. Congress appropriated another $8,000 to complete it. The mosaic contains the names of the battles Sherman fought in: *North side: Griswoldville, Waynesboro, Fort McAllister, Capture of Savannah, Averasborough, Bentonville, Durham Station, and the Surrender of Johnston's Army *East side: Kenesaw Mountain (it is misspelled with one \\"n\\" on the monument), Ruff's Mills, Peach Tree Creek, Atlanta, Ezra Church, Utoy Creek, Jonesboro, Capture of Atlanta, and Allatoona. *South side: Chattanooga, Ringgold, Missionary Ridge, Relief of Knoxville, Meridian Expedition, Dalton, Resaca, New Hope Church, Dallas, and Kulp's Farm (Kolb's Farm is misspelled on the monument). *West side: Bull Run, Shiloh, Corinth, Chickasaw Bluffs, Arkansas Post, Steeles Bayou (spelled without an apostrophe), Jackson, Vicksburg, and Colliersville (misspelled, as in most Union reports, with an \\"s\\" in the middle).

The MLP serves as the interface between a Location Server and a location-based application. Basic MLP Services are based on location services defined by 3GPP. The Mobile Location Protocol (MLP) is described in LIF TS 101 Specification.OMA Technical Section  Background  The purpose of this technology is to define a simple and secure access method that allows mobile application to query location information from a wireless network, regardless of its underlying network technology and positioning methods. The MLP can be used by a location-based application to request mobile station location information from a location server (GMLC/MPC or other entity in the wireless network). This protocol has been prepared by Location Interoperability Forum (LIF: Open Mobile Alliance in nowadays) to provide a simple and secure API (Application Programmer‚Äôs Interface), but also could be used for other kinds of location servers and entities in the wireless network. The API is based on XML and is defined to be transported in HTTP or SOAP. Only mapping to HTTP is defined in present days. For security reasons Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) cryptographic protocols can be used to carry HTTP (HTTPS). Apart from HTTPS Mobile Location Protocol which uses authentication by user and password, the information is carried in header part of MLP message.

It includes four galleries, a 232-seat theatre, classroom space, administrative offices, vault and adequate preparatory and conservation space for the Center's current programming efforts. Support for the center is provided in part by the Arkansas Arts Council, an agency of the Department of Arkansas Heritage, and the National Endowment for the Arts.\\\\- Encyclopedia of Arkansas\\\\- Arkansas Democrat/Gazette - Arkansas On Line\\\\- Arkansas Discovery Network \\\\- Smithsonian Magazine History The Arts & Science Center for Southeast Arkansas traces its history to March 4, 1968, when two local community arts groups merged by ordinance of the Pine Bluff City Council and assumed the name of Civic Center Arts Museum. Soon afterward, the center grew to include performing arts, science exhibits, and educational programming, broadening its reach to the ten-county region of Arkansas, Ashley, Bradley, Chicot, Cleveland, Desha, Drew, Grant, Jefferson, and Lincoln counties. After services were expanded to this region, the city council changed the name in May 1969 to Southeast Arkansas Arts & Science Center. In 1971, the center became a commission of the City of Pine Bluff, whereby it operates with a separate decision-making board but works within city government, much like a library. In 1987, the center's name was changed to the Arts & Science Center for Southeast Arkansas. From 1968 to 1986, the center operated out of the Pine Bluff Civic Center with an art gallery, a science education junior gallery, a permanent collection gallery, a 192-seat theater, and administrative offices. A satellite building‚Äîa former fire station‚Äîdesignated for education classes was lent to the center by the city. In 1986, fire heavily damaged the Civic Center facility. Although the theater was eventually restored, the galleries, offices, and collections were moved to a historic home on Martin Street. The old fire station, known as the Little Firehouse Studio, continued as a classroom and student gallery. Due to this geographic separation, the need arose to have a facility that would house all programs under one roof. In anticipation of a building project, the Arts & Science Center for Southeast Arkansas Endowment Fund, Inc., was established in 1986 as a separate 501(c)(3) organization, legally responsible for raising and managing capital and endowment funds. In 1994, following a successful fundraising campaign, the current facility was built at 701 Main Street in downtown Pine Bluff. The 22,000-square-foot facility was built to AAM accreditation standards. The building includes four galleries, a 232-seat theater, classroom space, administrative offices, a vault, and adequate preparatory and conservation space for the center's programming efforts. Activities The center offers several children's science exhibits on a rotating basis. Exhibits have included Illusion Confusion, Good Vibrations, and Grossology. Year-round science classes are also available. As part of its commitment to providing quality children's science exhibits, the center is a member of a seven-museum consortium in Arkansas, the Arkansas Discovery Network, which is funded by the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation. Besides exhibiting well-known local, state, regional, national, and international artists, the center offers year-round art classes in sculpture, mixed media, and more. Exhibits have included the work of Frederic Remington and Norman Rockwell, as well as a collection of art and artifacts from western Africa ranging from the fifth century to the late twentieth century. The center, as part of its mission, also regularly exhibits works from artists throughout Arkansas and the Delta region. The center's permanent collection addresses a regional constituency and places emphasis on collecting works by African-American artists, Arkansas artists, and artists living and working in the South. The center hosts a monthly music series, Live@5, on the first Friday of each month, showcasing the music of Arkansas musicians and featuring the Delta sounds of jazz, blues, soul, rock, and country. The center also hosts community theater productions of both nationally famous works, such as Guys and Dolls and Barefoot in the Park, and plays by Arkansas playwrights. Theater classes and camps for adults and children also are offered. Permanent collection The center's permanent collection addresses a regional constituency and places emphasis on collecting works by African-American artists, Arkansas artists, and artists living and working in the Delta region. =Paintings= The Center's paintings vary in mediums. The styles range from symbolist, to figurative, to narrative, to abstract, to realist. The collection includes several Arkansas artists, including six pieces from Larry D. Alexander‚Äôs ‚ÄúDermott Series‚Äù, and the landscapes of Henri Linton. The Center also has the Elsie Mistie Sterling Collection of Botanical Paintings, the largest known collection of botanical watercolor paintings by one artist. =Sculptures= The Center has an extraordinary collection of Art Deco bronze sculptures, known as the John Stern Collection. There are also several contemporary sculptures by regional artists. =Photography= The Arts & Science Center for Southeast Arkansas has developed a unique collection of photography, ranging from the documentation of the Mississippi Delta culture to the abstract. The J.C. Covert Collection is historically significant in educating the population about life in the Delta at the turn of the 20th century, focusing on cotton fields and riverboats. The Howard Stern Collection of photographs is more abstract in nature as Stern creates extraordinary views of everyday objects. =Drawings and prints= The Center has a growing collection of drawings and prints, including seriographs by Jacob Lawrence and Red Grooms, lithographs by Joan Mir√≥ and Kathe Kollwitz, and etchings and ink drawings from Benny Andrews.

Early life William Forsyth was born on 23 March 1850 in Logie Easter, Ross-shire. He was the son of John Forsyth (died 1898) and Ann (n√©e Bell) (died 1857). John, at the time, was a farmer on the Balnagowan estate, the seat of Sir Charles Ross and site of Balnagowan castle. Later, in the 1860s, John Forsyth would become the factor of the whole estate, some 300,000 acres, of which about 8000 acres were arable, 400 acres under wood, and 288,000 acres under pasture.Transactions of the Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland: On the Agriculture of the Counties of Ross and Cromarty, by James Macdonald, Special Reporter for the Scotsman, Aberdeen.

An Anglo-Saxon burial mound is an accumulation of earth and stones erected over a grave or crypt during the late sixth and seventh centuries AD in Anglo-Saxon England. These burial mounds are also known as barrows or tumuli. Early Anglo-Saxon burial involved both inhumation and cremation, with burials then being deposited in cemeteries. At this time, the Anglo-Saxons adhered to a pagan religion, but as Christianity was introduced in the seventh century, it gradually became the dominant and eventually sole religion amongst the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. Many of those buried in barrows were pagan, but others were instead Christian, and it is usually impossible for archaeologists to know which religion an individual belonged to.Pollington 2008. p. 53-54. Earlier peoples living in Britain during the Neolithic and Bronze Ages had also constructed barrows for use as places of burial, something that was recognised by the Anglo-Saxon burial builders, who in many cases re-used these earlier barrows for their own uses. Background A reconstruction of the Hochdorf Chieftain's Grave, a large Iron Age burial mound dating from c. 550 BCE in Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany. Although constructed a thousand years before the Anglo-Saxon barrows, there are cultural similarities between the two. Tumulus burials were not restricted to the Anglo-Saxons, but had a long pedigree in prehistoric and early mediaeval Europe. By this latter date, when the Anglo-Saxon society existed, such burials were not restricted to any one cultural or ethnic group, with Germanic-speaking, Slavic-speaking and Celtic-speaking peoples of the period all taking part in such a burial practice for elite members of their societies.Pollington 2008. p. 36. In the Roman Iron Age, whilst the construction of barrows had ended in Britain, it had continued in areas of continental Europe free from Roman domination. The Hallstatt culture which existed in central Europe between c. 750 and 400 BCE utilised chamber burials within barrows as the way of commemorating deceased members of the social elite. The most prominent known Hallstatt example is the Hochdorf Chieftain's Grave, which dates from c. 550 BCE and which was richly laden with grave goods.Pollington 2008. p. 25. By the sixth century CE, when the practice of building burial mounds is first adopted by the Anglo-Saxons, it was also being practiced by other Germanic-speaking peoples on continental Europe. In the German region of Thuringia, several important chamber burial barrows have been excavated, including at a cemetery in Trossingen which dates to c. 580 CE, thereby being contemporary with similar Anglo-Saxon sites.Pollington 2008. p. 27. Introduction of burial mounds The Anglo-Saxon peoples had migrated to Britain during the fifth century CE, settling primarily along the eastern areas of what is now England. They were adherents of a pagan religion. The practice of Anglo-Saxon barrow burials had been adopted by the Merovingian dynasty Franks, who lived in what is now France, from the mid fifth century CE. It was from these Merovingian Franks that the Anglo-Saxons likely adopted the practice.Pollington 2008. p. 28. Throughout the sixth century, the south- eastern Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Kent developed political ties with the Merovingian kings in Francia, with their respective royal families eventually being sealed through a marriage alliance. It was through this connection that the Kentish Anglo-Saxons adopted the Merovingian practice of burying members of their social elite in large tumuli. The importance and influence of the Kentish kingdom across the south of England subsequently led to Anglo-Saxon peoples north of the river Thames also adopting the practice. This seems to be a contradiction, and whether or not such mounds were indigenous to either respective area is debatable and likely developed through earlier migrations, later experiencing a pseudo-rennaisance Construction The construction and burial within a burial mound would have been a lengthier process than ordinary Anglo-Saxon inhumation or cremation burials, with funerary rites and preparations having lasted for at least a week. The first step in a barrow burial would have been the removal of a circular area of topsoil, which was then encircled with a ditch where the soil had been dug even deeper.Pollington 2008. p. 29. Archaeologist Martin Carver believed that this first stage had a symbolic significance in setting aside an inner and an outer zone between where the burial was going to be built and the outside world around it.Carver 2002. p. 134. The second step in the process involved a grave cut then being made into the ground with enough space for an inhumation burial. Some of the most prestigious barrows contained burial chambers with richly-furnished wooden rooms buried within the mound. In others, the corpse had simply been interred and had had a mass of stones and earth raised on surface. In the case of some inhumation burials, a step or platform was cut into one of the ends of the grave so that mourners at the funeral could kneel down and arrange the corpse and their grave goods.Pollington 2008. pp. 29-30. In certain cases, the grave-cut, or at least its bottom, was sealed with clay prior to the body then being placed into it with their grave goods.Pollington 2008. p. 30. With the body then in the grave, a funerary service would have taken place, involving the performance of certain rituals and the eating of a graveside meal. A covering would then have been placed over the body, which was usually textile but in some cases was instead made up of hazel poles or stakes. In the case of chamber burials, it is at this point that the chamber that the body was in would have been sealed up with a wooden roof. At this point the grave would have been complete, and the next step would have been to build the earthen mound on top. Some of this would have come from the ring ditch surrounding the barrow, although other soil would have come from the surrounding area. It is possible that when the mound was finally constructed, a timber post would have been inserted into the top, marking the burial. Purpose Various archaeologists and historians have discussed why the barrows were built by the Anglo-Saxons and for what purpose. Anglo-Saxon specialist Stephen Pollington noted that they were ways of creating \\"a permanent mark on the landscape\\" which allowed them to claim \\"the territory and the right to hold it\\".Pollington 2008. p. 35. Pollington also remarked that \\"the burial chamber was an idealised portrayal of the 'house of the dead', the last resting place of the deceased into which they would welcome those who sought them out through spirit travel.\\" Weston Wyly interpreted them as being symbolic of the pregnant belly of the earth, into which the corpse, representing the human seed, was planted.Weston Wyly 2007. pp. 323-324.

Lewin worked in polymer, fiber and nanotechnology research. Until his death, a month before his 93rd birthday, Lewin was in charge of a research program at the Polytechnic Institute of New York University. In 2009, he was appointed as editor-in-chief of the Encyclopedia on Fiber science and Engineering, to be published by Wiley in New York. Lewin obtained 29 U.S. and European patents and published 175 peer-reviewed publications. He was the founder (1990) and editor-in-chief of the international monthly journal Polymers for Advanced Technologies (PAT). PAT sponsors international biannual symposia for scientists, and Lewin often served as chairman, co-chairman or honorary chairman. Biography Menachem Lewin was born in Soko≈Çy, PolandWorld Who's Who in Science: A Biographical Dictionary of Notable Scientists from Antiquity to the Present, Volume 2, Marquis Who's Who, 1968 on 26 March 1918, and was educated at the \\"Tachkemoni\\" school and at the Hebrew gymnasium \\"Tarbut\\" in Bia≈Çystok. In 1926, he joined the youth movement \\"Betar\\". In 1933, he moved to ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and graduated from high school at the \\"Yitzchak Katznelson\\" grade A gymnasium. The first year of Lewin's academic studies was in the Wszechnica Lodzka. From 1935 to 1937, Lewin helped Ze'ev Jabotinsky during his visits to ≈Å√≥d≈∫ to organize lectures for Jews, in which he called on Jews to emigrate to Israel without delay. He served as deputy commander of the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ branch of Betar and as district officer of the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ district. He immigrated to Palestine in 1937 to study chemistry at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Lewin joined the \\"National Military Organization\\" (Ha'Irgun HaTzva'i HaLe'umi) and established with three other students an underground laboratory of war materials. In June 1939, Lewin was arrested by the British Mandate police, severely tortured, and sentenced by a military court to 4 years imprisonment with hard labor, which he served in prison in Jerusalem, the Atlit hard labor camp, the Acre fortress and the Mizra prison. After his release from British prison, Lewin continued his university studies, receiving an MSc in chemistry in 1945 and a PhD in 1947. In 1947, Lewin was recruited into the army and joined the Hemed science corps. He served in the army until 1950 and within this framework, took part in the establishment of the Air Force Research Department and managed the fuel and fabrics testing laboratories. Lewin was married to Esther Rachel, with whom he had three children - Dorit Dinur, Yitzchak Lewin, and Yehudit Weisinger. Lewin died in Jerusalem on February 18, 2011, and was buried on Har HaMenuchot. Scientific career In 1950, Lewin joined Professor S. Sambursky in the establishment and organization of the Research Council of Israel in the prime minister's office. In this capacity, Lewin dealt with scientific research planning in key areas important to Israel, and began researching natural polymers, such as the fibers found in local vegetation that can serve as renewable raw materials for industry. In this field, Lewin initiated studies on the chemistry and technology of forest trees, wild plants and agricultural waste. As a result of studies carried out in collaboration with the agricultural researcher Prof. Menachem Plaut, Lewin initiated the renewed cultivation of flax for linen production. For the research, 5,000 acres of flax fields were sown in the south, and the Flax Company was established, in cooperation with the Central Hamashbir and various textile companies. To find an economic basis for settlement in the Arava which was found to have salty groundwater, Lewin initiated an extensive survey of wild plants growing in the Arava, including the juncus plant. The study revealed that juncus fibers have special features for manufacturing fine papers. The Desert Plants Company was established and a juncus plantation of 75 acres was founded, watered by salt water in the area of Yotvata near the Jordanian border. In the chemical and technological research conducted by Lewin and his students, the chemical composition, morphology, and methods of production of fibers were tested for their suitability to produce different types of paper. In one study, conducted on papyrus growing in the Hula Valley swamps, an original process was developed to produce high-quality insulation boards. Another study conducted by Lewin and his team was carried out on the industrial uses of agave sisalana plant debris, planted in the 1960s on large areas in southern Israel by the Jewish National Fund. In this study, processes were developed for producing various chemicals from the waste left over after producing sisal fibers; namely, the hecogenin used to produce steroidal drugs, a process originally developed and patented for cortisone production by Cornforth and Callow in the 1950s for Glaxo.R.K.

In 1951, Lewin founded the Association for Textile Research in collaboration with manufacturers in order to perform research for the development of Israeli industry. It was the first research association and was followed by similar associations in other industrial fields. In 1953, Lewin initiated the establishment of the Institute of Fibers and Forest Products Research, (later known as the Israel Fiber Institute), which he ran until 1986. In the 1970s, there were 120 employees, including 40 PhD scientists. Several departments in the Institute performed research on polymers, synthetic and natural fibers, mechanical engineering, the chemistry of fabric curing processes and chemical additives for industrial use, detergents and cleaning, physics of fibers and fabrics, use of fibers in medicine and biotechnology, biological durability of fiber products, fire retardancy of polymeric and fiber materials, and more. A central role of the Institute was to assist the textile industry and other light industries suffering from a lack of professionals and knowhow. Lewin took it upon himself to create detailed plans for the high-level education of industry experts. As a result, the Institute formed an affiliation with the Hebrew University in 1968, and the Division of Polymer and Textile Chemistry was established in the faculty of natural sciences. The hundreds of graduates of the division were absorbed by many factories in the country, and today they hold key positions in academia and in industry. In addition, Lewin has taught courses at the graduate level at the Hebrew University in chemistry and physical chemistry of polymers and fibers, and has guided many MSc and PhD studies. The results of the studies that were carried out at the Israel Fiber Institute were made accessible to the United Nations Food and Agriculture organization (FAO). From 1956-1968, Lewin collaborated with the FAO and was appointed chairman of a group of experts on wood and plastics. Lewin participated in discussions on the development of renewable energy sources from wood and agricultural waste products. In the 1980s, Lewin served as an advisor to the government of Brazil on the development of ethanol fuel for cars instead of gasoline. Of the studies carried out by Lewin and his team, the research on bromine markedly stands out. It dealt with problems of chemical structure and morphology of cellulose, polyester, polyamide, polyolefins, the changing crystalline structure of polymers, oxidation, bleaching and degradation of polymers, studies on flame retardancy of polymers, and more. Bromine studies performed by Lewin were directed towards the discovery and development of new uses for bromine which is found in large quantities at the Dead Sea. The studies included, in addition to the basic chemistry of the various compounds of bromine, new industrial uses which enabled the expansion of production and marketing of bromine, and thus contributed to the country's economy. In these studies, a new technology of bleaching fabrics was developed for the textile industry, and a method of bleaching pulp for the production of paper and cardboard was devised. Another major technology was the use of bromine and its components in flame retardancy of polymeric materials. Lewin was among the first to develop this technology, and his invention to increase the flame retardancy of wood products by injecting bromine into wood was acclaimed. The use of bromine and its components in the flame retardancy of polymers has been developed over the years, and bromine products for this purpose have reached an annual export from Israel of hundreds of millions of dollars. Other uses of bromine researched by Lewin and his group were in the fields of medicine and biotechnology. Lewin served as a visiting professor at several universities, including the University of North Carolina at Raleigh (1974, 1977), Kyoto University in Japan (1978, 1983), and the Brooklyn Polytechnic University (1982‚Äì1985), now the Polytechnic Institute of New York University. Lewin gave hundreds of invited lectures at universities, public and industrial research institutes, and international scientific conferences in many countries. He also served as the research director of the large firm JP Stevens in New Jersey during his sabbatical year in 1969-1970. From 1974-1989, Lewin served as a member of the research council at the Chief Scientist's Bureau which initiated and financed the creation of the high-tech industry in Israel, and as a member of Israel's Technology Council. Lewin also served as national representative in the Macromolecules Committee of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC). Post-retirement scientific research activities When he retired in 1986, Lewin was invited by Professor Herman Mark to serve as research professor at the Polytechnic Institute of New York University. From then until shortly before his death, Lewin spent half of his time in the U.S. in this role. He developed new activities: he organized in 1987 and served as chairman of the first international Conference on Polymers for Advanced Technologies held in Jerusalem. As a result of this conference, Lewin founded in 1990 the scientific journal Polymers for Advanced Technologies, published by Wiley Publishing. Based on the journal, Lewin initiated 9 biannual international symposia in which Lewin served as chairman, co-chairman or honorary chairman, are well known, and are attended by hundreds of scientists from around the world. In 1990, Lewin founded the first Conference on Recent Advances in Flame Retardancy of Polymeric Materials held in Stamford, Connecticut. Since then, 20 annual meetings were held on the same topic in which Lewin served as chairman. These conferences, which include forty invited lectures each by expert scientists from over 20 countries, institutionalized flame retardancy of polymers as one of the most important fields in polymer science. During his activities in the United States, Lewin carried out a series of research projects on the crystalline structure of synthetic polymers, on new materials and processes for dentistry, and in flame retardancy of polymeric materials. Starting in 2004, Lewin began his efforts in nanotechnology. Lewin discovered and proved the migration of nano-particles to the surface of polymer nanocomposites. As a result of migration, a new ceramic surface is formed with useful properties for industry and the defense establishment. Lewin published 175 scientific papers in peer-reviewed journals, and 20 books on chemistry and technology of polymers and fibers which were released by Decker, Plenum and Wiley. In 2008, Lewin published his 460-page autobiography in Hebrew, entitled \\"The Scroll of Menachem,\\" published by the Jabotinsky Institute. He was awarded 29 patents in the U.S., Europe, Japan and Israel. In 2009, Lewin was invited to serve as editor-in-chief of the new Encyclopedia of Fiber Science and Engineering, which in the first stage will consist of 9 volumes, and will be published by Wiley. Awards and recognition Lewin won the Geneva University Habif Award for outstanding cellulose research in 1959. He was recognized as a Yakir Yerushalayim, an honored citizen of Jerusalem in 1993. In 1999, a scientific conference was held in Tokyo to mark his 80th birthday in 1999. In 2003, a scientific conference in his honor was held at the University of Lille, France. In 2005, he received the Founders Award of the International Fiber Society and the Semplen Award from the Hungarian Academy of Sciences. The 10th PAT symposium which took place in Jerusalem in October 2009 marked his 90th birthday.

The database is a tool designed to organize functional elements into categories in human gene regions and to output their sequences needed for genotyping experiments as well as provide a set of SNPs that lie within each region. The database defines functional elements into ten types: promoter regions, CpG islands,5' untranslated regions (5'-UTRs), translation start sites, splice sites, coding exons, introns, translation stop sites, polyadenylation signals, and 3' UTRs. People may reference this database for haplotype information or obtain a flanking sequence for genotyping. This may help in finding mutations that contribute to common and polygenic diseases. Researchers can manually choose a group of SNPs of special interest for certain functional elements along with their corresponding sequences. The database combines information from sources such as HapMap, UCSC GoldenPath, dbSNP, OMIM, and TRANSFAC. Users can obtain information about tag SNPs and simulate LD blocks for each gene. FESD is still a developing database and is not widely known so was unable to find projects that used the database so I found research using similar databases or databases that are combined in FESD‚Äôs information pool.Kang, H.J.

Some of the genes were from Humans, mice, and some were from D. Melanogaster. Information cannot be submitted to the database publicly. The database is updated often and the information is pooled from the sites listed on the page. There is also a user guide tab that shows you what each process should look like. ResearchSusceptibility to Myocardial Infarction The study involved the investigation of ITIH3 (inter alpha trypsin inhibitor heavy chain 3). Researchers used Functional analysis, Linkage disequilibrium mapping, SNP markers, and the HapMap database. FESD Version II may have been used since it has the information from HapMap as well as other databases. The found that the gene was on chromosome 3. In vitro functional analyses showed that this SNP enhanced the transcriptional level of the ITIH3 gene. Furthermore, we found expression of the ITIH3 protein in the vascular smooth muscle cells and macrophages in the human atherosclerotic lesions, suggesting ITIH3 SNP to be a novel genetic risk factor of MI. The gene has been shown to be related to the proinflammatory process of immune response. ITIH3 makes a complex with the locally synthesized hyaluronan (HA) and interacts with inflammatory cells. The ITIH3-HA complex has been reported to be involved in inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel diseases. The most statistically-significant SNP did not substitute an amino acid of ITIH3 protein. The researchers hypothesized that this synonymous SNP affected the transcriptional regulation, because several papers reported that some transcriptional factors bound to the exonic coding sequences of some genes and regulated their transcriptional level. There was expression of ITIH3 protein in the atherosclerotic lesion. ITIH3 might play a critical role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and subsequent myocardial infarction.Ebana, Yusuke, et al. \\"A Functional SNP In ITIH3 Is Associated With Susceptibility To Myocardial Infarction.\\" Journal of Human Genetics 52.3 (2007): 220-229. * Hepatocellular Carcinoma These Researchers used snp selecting web tools and again could have used FESD Version II to select their SNPs. They hypothesized that the polymorphisms in circadian genes may be associated with prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. The circadian negative feedback regulation genes- CRY1, CRY2, PER1, PER2 and PER3 were identified based on a comprehensive literature review and the potentially functional SNPs were selected through web tools. Finally, a total of twelve potentially functional SNPs in five genes were selected, including CRY1: rs1056560, rs3809236; CRY2: rs6798, rs2292910; PER1: rs2585405, rs3027178; PER2: rs934945, rs2304669; PER3: rs2640908, rs172933, rs2859390, rs228669. When the dominant genetic model was tested, their data showed that only SNP rs2640908 in PER3 gene was significantly associated with overall survival of hepatocellular carcinoma patients. Patients carrying at least one variant allele of rs2640908 had a significantly decreased risk of death when compared with those carrying homozygous wild-type alleles. * Rheumatoid Arthritis A polymorphism interaction analysis (PIA) algorithm was used to obtain cooperating single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that contribute to RA disease. The acquired SNP pairs were used to construct a SNP-SNP network. Sub-networks defined by hub SNPs were then extracted and turned into gene modules by mapping SNPs to genes using dbSNP database. The FESD Version II would also be a good choice in database because it also covers the dbSNP database. They ran the Haseman Elston test, then a random forest algorithm. The shared SNPs detected were then ran through a polymorphism interaction analysis (PIA) algorithm. They performed Gene ontology analysis of the 5 modules that were created. They suggested that Ets-1 may be an important transcription factor in the cytokine- mediated inflammatory pathway and destructive cascade characteristic of RA. The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, ABCA1, was induced during differentiation of human monocytes into macrophages, and there was a dual regulatory function for ABCA1 in macrophage lipid metabolism and inflammation. Extracellular signals are transduced intracellularly via multiple pathways, resulting in alterations in the transcription and translation of specific proteins. Some of these signaling pathways result in the production of proteins, including cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of RA. The zinc-finger protein 238 (ZNF238) is attached to zinc-finger proteins that can regulate the human immunodeficiency virus type 1. Hub gene CD160 is a potential RA association gene. The CD160 receptor represents a unique triggering surface molecule that is expressed by cytotoxic NK cells, it participates in the inflammatory response and determines the type of subsequent specific immunity.

The 7th Guards Airborne Division was formed in September 1948 based on 322nd Guards Rifle Regiment which fought in Eastern Europe in World War II. In October 1948 the division was relocated to Kaunas, Lithuania. During the Cold War period, the division served in the suppression of the Hungarian and Czech revolutions. On August 1993, the division was relocated to Novorossisk, Russia. It took part in various counter-insurgency operations in the Caucasus region. On 1 December 2006 it was renamed as 7th Guards Mountain Air Assault Division. In 2014 the division's 247th Guards Air Assault Regiment allegedly took part in the War in Donbass in Ukraine.

As part of a postwar military reorganization, this division was retitled the 115th Guards Rifle Division in June 1945. The second formation of the 7th Guards Airborne Division was started in September 1948 based on 322nd Guards Rifle Regiment. =First formation (1942‚Äì1945)= The first formation of the division was formed during the Second World War at Ramenskoye in December 1942. It fought at Demyansk, Voronezh, Korsun, on the Dnieper River, and at Targul Frumos and Budapest. On May 8, 1945, the divisional commander, Major General Dmitrii Aristarkhovich Drichkin, set up his headquarters in the village of Erlauf, Austria, some 60 miles west of Vienna and 50 miles east of Linz. Anxious to meet the Allies, he sent out scouts. At midnight, he met Major General Stanley Eric Reinhart, commander of the U.S. 65th Infantry Division.www.lonesentry.com For the duration of their presence on the Danube river, both commanders continued to cooperate in an unusually effective manner.Anna Rosmus, Allied Encounters.

In all 2,065 of its soldiers, sergeants and officers were decorated for valor and heroism by the Soviet Union. The 7th Guards Airborne Division (second formation) was established on 15 October 1948 on the basis of the 322nd Guards Air Landing Regiment of the 103rd Guards Airborne DivisionFeskov et al 2013, p. 247 at Polotsk in the Belorussian Military District, becoming part of the 8th Guards Airborne Corps.Feskov et al 2013, p. 236 The division was relocated to the cities of Kaunas and Marijampole, Lithuanian SSR. Personnel from these bases took part in actions against Lithuanian partisans. Units in this premier division of airborne troops have mastered the landing of Antonov An-8, An-12, An-22, and Il-76 aircraft, tested a number of new parachute systems (D-5 and D-6), all generations of BMD, and 2S9 Nona artillery systems. In 1956, the division was involved in \\"Operation Whirlwind\\", the suppression of the Hungarian revolution. On 3 November 1956, the 108th Parachute Regiment landed at the T√∂k√∂l airbase in Il-12 and Li-2 aircraft, capturing and disabling six antiaircraft batteries, then positioning themselves to defend the base. On 4 November 1956 the regimental staff, together with fighters from the 119th Parachute Regiment, entered the city of Budapest and took part in street fighting until the city was secured on 7 November. In 1968, the division participated in Operation Danube to suppress the Prague Spring uprising. The 108th Regiment distinguished itself in the most dangerous and difficult missions, for which about two hundred of its personnel received high government awards. The An-12 Soviet military-transport plane On 23 June 1969, troops of the 108th Airborne Regiment were tasked to fly from Kaunas to Ryazan, where they were to demonstrate their vehicle assault landing skills to the Minister of Defence of the USSR, Andrei Grechko. The group of three An-12 aircraft took off early in the morning, reaching a cruising altitude of . Approaching the city of Kaluga, a plane carrying the staff of a company and battalion command (91 officers and men) collided with an Ilyushin Il-14 passenger plane that was at 3000 meters without clearance, with the loss of all aboard. The division was involved in many major exercises and maneuvers, such as \\"Shield-76\\", \\"Neman\\", \\"West-81\\" (Exercise Zapad-81), \\"West-84\\" and \\"Watch-86\\", in the latter three exercises dropping airborne combat vehicles with crews, and receiving the Minister of Defence of the USSR Pennant \\"for courage and military prowess\\" during West-81. In 1971 and 1972, the division was awarded the Red Banner of the Airborne Troops. On 4 May 1985, for success in military training and in connection with the 40th anniversary of the Victory in World War II, the division was awarded the Order of the Red Banner. In 1988‚Äì1989, elements of the division took part in the Black January events in Baku.  In Russian Armed Forces  In 1993‚Äì1996, personnel from the 108th Regiment served on peacekeeping missions in Abkhazia to deal with the aftermath of the War in Abkhazia of 1992‚Äì1993. At some point after 1990 the division was given the 'Mountain' designation. Between January 1995 and April 2004, the 108th Regiment fought in the North Caucasian region, notably in the August 1999 battle for the \\"Donkey's Ear\\" heights in Dagestan. In 1997, the division's 97th Guards Airborne Regiment was disbanded. In August 2014 the division's 247th Guards Air Assault Regiment fought in the Battle of Ilovaisk during the War in Donbass, Ukraine. The division was subsequently awarded the Order of Suvorov in May 2015. In December 2016, Vladimir Shamanov announced that a separate battalion of the division's 97th Air Assault Regiment would be formed in Dzhankoy, with the rest of the regiment reformed from the battalion in the future.

Early life Doron Richard Jensen was born in Dubuque, Iowa, to pastors Richard and Bonnie Jensen. Jensen spent much of his formative youth in Addis Abba, Ethiopia before returning to the United States in 1965. He dropped out of a secondary school at the age of 16. Influenced by his grandfather's cafe, Jensen's Cafe, Jensen entered the restaurant business as a busboy. Jensen's parents were supportive of his endeavors from an early age. Jensen started his buffet career working as a manager at Sirloin Stockade and Ponderosa and Bonaza Steakhouse in Iowa in the 1970s. After the death of his grandfather, 20-year-old Doron felt ready to take over his grandfather's cafe in Fremont, Nebraska. His parents helped arrange the takeover of the restaurant, but was blocked by other relatives that thought he was too young for the responsibility. Jensen briefly attended the University of Minnesota. Old Country Buffet (1983-1986) Jensen was brought into Old Country Buffet by Roe Hatlen and C. Dennis Scott in 1983. Jensen opened the first restaurant in St. Cloud, Minnesota in 1983. In 1984, Jensen starting opening more locations in the Twin Cities Metropolitan area, eventually expanding its reach outside of Minnesota. Jensen began opening its restaurants along the eastern seaboard, but disagreements began among company leadership whether to expand into the American South. Disagreements within the company continued regarding southern United States expansion, and eventually led to Jensen and major investor and construction magnate Dermot Rowland to leave the company to start their own buffet chain, Homestyle Buffet. Shortly after Jensen's departure, Forbes recognized Old Country Buffett as one of the 200 best small companies in the United States before becoming the largest buffet chain in the world posting revenues of $808.5 million and $868.9 million by the 1990s. Jensen cited his \\"youth and entrepreneurial spirit\\" as reasons why he left the company so early in its development. Homestyle Buffet (1986-1990) Jensen left Old Country Buffett to lead what would become Homestyle Buffet. At just the age of 28, Jensen opened Homestyle Buffets Inc. and incorporated them in Clearwater, Florida in 1986. He took the company public on December 1, 1988. Jensen expanded the reach of the company outside of Florida and across the eastern seaboard and eventually into New England. However, Jensen left the company after just 40 restaurants to return to the Midwest to pursue other ventures. Timberlodge Steakhouse (1991-1995) While in Florida, Jensen was influenced by the developing steakhouse concept that would eventually become Outback Steakhouse. Jensen decided to return to Minneapolis, Minnesota, where he founded the company Q-Steaks Inc as the umbrella company for Minnesota Steakhouse in January 1991.http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_n19_v29/ai_16910313/ Again, Jensen took his company public. Timber Lodge Steakhouse went public on January 1, 1993. Jensen changed the name to Timber Lodge Steakhouse in 1994 when the company's reach expanded outside of Minnesota, with the exception of Paul Bunyan's in New York. In 1995, he resigned as President of the company, again leaving a company that he had founded. Later, Jensen along with Outback Steakhouse founder, Chris T. Sullivan, would be attributed with rebooting the American steakhouse concept. Later career Jensen circa 1996 in Eagan, Minnesota. In the late 1990s, Jensen's career shifted towards a more signature style of restaurants. Since Timber Lodge Steakhouse, Jensen has primarily focused on signature restaurants over large-scale restaurant chains. Jensen developed the signature restaurant Q-Cumbers in Edina, Minnesota and later developed his own personal brand of self-titled restaurants Jensen's Cafe, Jensen's Supper Club, and Jensen's food & cocktails. Jensen's Cafe is named in honor of his grandfather's original Jensen's Cafe in Fremont, Nebraska. Jensen's concepts and designs have been cited as influence for other restaurant brands such as Minervas food & cocktails and Hazelwood food & drinks. Jensen was elected as the President of the interest group the Minnesota Restaurant Association in 2000. Jensen's career has also included lobbyist efforts representing the National Restaurant Association in Washington, DC. He has also served on various commerce boards in Minnesota.

The film takes its title from the formal definition of a refugee under the UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, as a person who deserves protection, \\"owing to a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion.‚Äù The film analyzes the US asylum process by following several asylum applicants and asylum officers through actual INS interviews.  Synopsis  On average, only one in two hundred asylum applicants is ever admitted as a refugee to the U.S. A refugee is defined as someone afraid to return home for fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, social group or political opinion. Any foreign citizen who is able to find a path into the U.S. is eligible to apply for refugee protection in the form of political asylum. At the time of filming, the former Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) handled all requests for asylum. Behind the doors of the asylum office lies a dramatic real-life stage where American ideals about human rights collide with the nearly impossible task of trying to know the truth. The film shows the closed corridors of the INS for an extraordinary close-up look at what has been called the Ellis Island of the 21st Century. It is an intimate world never before seen on screen‚Äîasylum officers, lawyers, translators, economic migrants, legitimate refugees looking for protection, all focused on the confidential interviews that are the heart of the asylum process. Cases examined within the film involve individuals originating from China, El Salvador, Albania, Nigeria, Romania, Algeria, France and Russia. The film reveals the challenges of determining the validity of claims made in the asylum interview process. The film closes with several onscreen statements about how the asylum application process has changed since filming. Congress passed legislation which reduces the number of people who are eligible to apply for asylum. The legislation also jails individuals arriving at U.S. borders requesting asylum. Additionally, the legislation limited an individual's right to appeal some of the decisions from asylum officers. Release Well-Founded Fear was featured as an Official Selection at the 2000 Sundance Film Festival where The Hollywood Reporter called it ‚Äúone of the most talked-about and attended films at the Festival.‚Äù The film was broadcast on PBS, through P.O.V. on June 5, 2000. It was also broadcast on CNN and CNN satellite stations as CNN Presents: Asylum in America. It played at Docfest 2000, where it was lauded as The Grand Jury Prize Winner. The film has screened at festivals in San Francisco, New Zealand, Finland and many cities across the United States. It has been an Official Selection at: * The Human Rights Watch International Film Festival, London; * San Francisco International Film Festival;http://history.sffs.org/films/film_details.php?id=5464&search;_by[6]=6&searchfield;=Well- Founded%20Fear * DoubleTake Documentary Film Festival, Durham, NC; * Cleveland International Film Festival; Wisconsin Film Festival, Madison; * Old Dominion Film Festival, Norfolk, VA; * Taos Talking Pictures Film Festival, NM; * Philadelphia Festival of World Cinema; * UNAFF (United Nation Association Film Festival);http://www.unaff.org/2000/index.html * CineVegas International Film Festival; * The New Zealand International Film Festival;http://www.nzff.co.nz/n3927.html * Documentary Guild's Uptown- Downtown Film Festival, Helsinki, Finland The film has been specially screened at New York University, The School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University, Austin Film Society's \\"Texas Documentary Tour,\\" Office of Refugee Resettlement National Conference in D.C., Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in D.C. and The Refugee Studies Centre at University of Oxford. Critical reception The film has earned praise and criticism from commentators, reformers, and educators. The film is currently used in universities and law schools across the nation. It is in regular use by the Asylum Training Corps in the Department of Homeland Security, as well as hundreds of law offices across the U.S. The New York Times review wrote ‚Äúthe two-hour documentary by Shari Robertson and Michael Camerini takes an amazingly unflinching look at the process for seeking political asylum in the United States. The viewer who sticks with it ends up rewarded but deeply rattled, on several levels.‚Äù The New York Daily News review of the P.O.V. broadcast called the film ‚Äúa very strong show,‚Äù highlighting that ‚Äúthe close- ups, when people learn of their fates, are unforgettable, as are some of the very candid admissions by the INS interviewers. And by all means, stay tuned until the very end, because the updates at the end will both amaze and amuse you.‚Äù Esquire cited the film as ‚Äúa reason to (still) watch PBS... [and] a reminder of the power public television can still generate when it‚Äôs firing on all of its high-minded cylinders.‚Äù At the 2000 Independent Spirit Awards, the film was nominated the Truer than Fiction award.  Modules  Due to the film‚Äôs success in the classroom and other education situations, two discussion modules were produced to accompany the film. *Tales From Real Life provides an in-depth look at five memorable people from countries around the globe, all seeking asylum in the United States. Each case study, of an actual asylum interview, provides window into a very different life experience: #Lyudmila, a Jewish ex-soviet from Belarus, living in Minsk, who feels persecuted by her neighbors and strangers. #Jamal, a Sudanese political dissident who was tortured and is intent on describing his entire story. #Gjergi, an Albanian, kidnapped by the secret-police and beaten after writing an article in his high school newspaper. #Alfonso, a Guatemalan who is modest about how he was affected by civil war. #Mareja, a former Yugoslavian, unable to prosecute her abusive husband because his Communist Party family ruled the region. *Practicing Asylum Law is geared especially toward the needs of advocates, legal professionals and their clients. It offers concrete examples for discussion and analysis, along with notes and commentary by experts and Asylum Office insiders. This module illustrates the interactions between attorneys and asylum officers.

It was one of the twenty-six (26) commercial banks licensed by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the country's banking regulator, in early 2011 before a merger with Sterling Bank. Overview ETB is a large financial services provider in Nigeria. , the bank maintained about one hundred (100) retail branches in various urban centers in the country. History The bank was established in January 1990, as a limited liability company. In February the same year, it was granted a commercial banking license and in March 1990, it commenced banking operations. In 2006, ETB successfully merged with the former Devcom Bank. The bank is a national bank, which has most of its retail outlets located in Nigeria's major urban centers. In 2009, in an audit by the Central Bank of Nigeria, ETB was found to be under-capitalized and unsatisfactorily managed. Subsequent to those discoveries, CBN directed ETB to reduce company staff numbers to maintain profitability. 150 staff members, representing about 15% of the bank's work force were fired in March 2010. ETB was also added to a list of nine (9) Nigerian commercial banks that required the injection of new capital by the Asset Management Company of Nigeria (AMCON), a federal government agency. ETB was taken over by Sterling bank in a deal that was sealed on 11 August 2011. Ownership Prior to 2009, the shares of stock of the bank were privately owned. However, due to the intervention of the CBN and AMCON in 2009, a significant percentage of shareholding in ETB is owned by the Federal Government of Nigeria.

Biography Sam Moffie was born in Newton, Massachusetts. He was the victim of a hit and run accident in 2006. As he recuperated, his long-held dream of becoming a fiction writer started percolating in his brain, and soon he started writing. Now, he is on his fifth book. Moffie decided not to publish his work through mainstream publishing houses. Thus, he has achieved both critical and popular appeal as one of the many pioneers in the exploding self-publishing market, which has turned the conventional book publishing industry inside-out with its success. Moffie writes fiction loaded with humor, satire and frequent social and political commentary. Some of his works feature and discuss Wittenberg University in Springfield, Ohio where Moffie attended college (1978‚Äì1982). As a member of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity, it isn't uncommon to see many of his fraternal brothers appear somewhat disguised in some of his works. Swap was Moffie's first novel, published in 2007. The novel is loosely based upon an obscure real-life incident between former New York Yankees' pitchers Mike Kekich and Fritz Petersen, who, in the 1970s, actually traded their wives, children and pets to one another. Moffie changed their team to The Cleveland Indians and set his novel in Youngstown, Ohio (his hometown). Swap is memorable for very quirky characters such as the lead protagonist Sheldon Marsh who, like Moffie, is deaf in his right ear. Another memorable character is Sheldon's mother who is known simply as \\"Sheldon's mother\\". She dispenses wisdom like a blazing fastball to the head and also happens to be addicted to movies. Swap was named a finalist in humor by the 2007 Midwestern Small Press Association. Frustrated at the lack of attention that his manuscript for Swap got from mainstream literary agents and publishing houses, Moffie disguised one of his favorite novels first chapter -Breakfast of Champions by Kurt Vonnegut - into a manuscript that Moffie called The Perfect Martini, and sent it to the top 100 literary agents in America. Ninety-nine out of 100 passed on the work - a feat that Moffie, when speaking at various functions, has used to highlight how difficult it is to get literary fiction featuring satire, humor and conventional culture getting kicked in the tush published. However, Moffie's piece on this venture did get noticed by Kurt Vonnegut's son Mark (himself an award-winning author) who told Moffie about a weekend where Mark's father and his friend Jerzy Kosinski got drunk and disguised one of Jerzy's books, just like Moffie did with Kurt's. This tid-bit from Mark shows up in Moffie's 4th novel The Book of Eli. Moffie was very involved in politics in college and in his hometown of Youngstown, Ohio where he has run for office a few times (all unsuccessful but memorable campaigns). Politics features prominently in some of his works because of his activism.

The station lies at Ebertplatz on the Cologne Ring in the district of Innenstadt.  History  The station was opened in 1974 and consists of a mezzanine and two island platforms with four rail tracks. Before 2008, the station also offered two side platforms on the outer tracks, so passengers could board and leave on both sides. This was due to the fact that the station was also used by single ended tram cars, so each track had to have a platform on the right. To gain accessibility, the platforms for the trains from and to Dom/Hbf had to be elevated, as high-floor cars operate on this route. However, the other tracks, leading to the Ringe tunnel, are, only used by low-floor cars, so the island platforms were split in the middle into a low and a high side. Therefore, the platforms were widened, using the space by the former outer platforms which thus were removed.

The current building replaced a medieval Bishop's Palace built in the 14th century for Bishop Langton. The first palace was destroyed during the English Civil War and rebuilt in 1687 as the current building. The palace was residence to the Bishop of Lichfield from the late 1860s until 1954, it is now used by Lichfield Cathedral School. The palace is a Grade I listed building. To the north and east of the house are the remains of the ditch that surrounded the Close, remains of the north east tower are present in the rear garden of the palace and is a Scheduled Ancient Monument. Architecture Construction of the building began in 1686 and was completed in 1687. The architect was Edward Pierce who had previously worked as one of Christopher Wren's masons. The building was built in the Queen Anne style and comprises two storeys with a seven window range, low pitched hipped roof with dormer windows. The front of the house has a symmetrical layout and is topped with a classical pediment over the doorway. As built the palace comprised on the ground floor, a central hall and parlour with a drawing room on the east and a chapel on the west. A bakehouse, brewhouse, and pigsty were built in the north west corner of the grounds, the rest of which was laid out as gardens and a cherry orchard. In 1868-69 two wings were added to either side of the house and a chapel to the north west angle. The chapel is built in a gothic style with lancet windows. All of the original and subsequent buildings are faced in grey Ashlar stone. History Plan of the medieval Palace The first building at this location was built for Bishop Langton in 1304-14. This building stretched along the east wall of the Close and was enclosed by its own wall. Walter the carpenter and Hugh de la Dale, a mason were responsible for a palace whose great hall was the fifth or sixth largest in England at the time at 100 ft x 56 ft. The hall was probably aisled, with columns supporting an elaborately carved wooden roof admired in 1634 for its gilt carvings. Paintings of the coronation, marriages, wars and funeral of Edward I decorated the walls and were still visible in the 1590s. The bishop's private quarters lay north of the hall. To the south what was called the Lady's Chamber in 1685 was possibly a reception room. A chapel was built south of the hall, whose east end was a tower protruding from the Close wall. The chapel may have had two storeys: a lower one with access from the passage for the use of servants, and an upper one with access from the Lady's Chamber for the bishop's use. At the south end of the courtyard was a gateway which faced the main, south east entrance of the Close. The palace grounds were entered through a gateway in the south west corner of an inner courtyard. Remains of the 14th century tower The original palace was severely damaged during the three sieges of the Cathedral Close in the Civil War from 1643-46. The building was effectively a shell, all the timber work of the hall and of the chambers at its north end was destroyed and only the stone vault remained. After the war Bishop Hacket used stone from the building to renovate a house on the south side of the Close as his residence. The only fragment of the medieval palace which survives is the base of a column found in the early 20th century and set up in the garden. In 1684 an order to rebuild the palace was put forward to Archbishop Sancroft who delegated the task to Dean Addison. The site was cleared and construction took 18 months, completed in 1687. When built the Bishops did not want to live there and the palace was let to tenants, one of which was Anna Seward. The palace once again became the Bishops residence when Bishop Selwyn took occupancy in the late 1860s. Selwyn added a chapel to the north west corner in 1868 and two wings either side of the palace in 1869. The palace remained the bishop's residence until 1953, when Bishop Reeve moved into Bishop's House on the south side of the Close, and the palace was vested in the dean and chapter. Since 1954 the palace has been occupied by Lichfield Cathedral School as one of their teaching buildings.

In the early 1900s he emigrated to Australia and by 1907 was living in Newcastle, New South Wales, by which time reports indicate that 'he had been working in various jobs and locations for several years'. At the outbreak of World War I he was resident at 3 Adeline Street, Preston, a suburb of Melbourne, Victoria, when he enlisted in the Australian 21st Battalion. Cycling career =England and Europe= Gascoyne began his cycling career in 1893. In 1896 he set the world record for 25 miles in 57 minutes 18.4 seconds. This was his first attempt at a distance greater than 10 miles on a cinder track and he easily broke the 59 mins 1.6 secs record set by Schaeffer. The riders had been paced by a triplet but he reportedly overtook it because it was not fast enough.Chesterfield Spire Cycling Club, History, Thomas Jepson Gascoyne In 1901, in partnership with Sidney Jenkins, he set the English record time for two miles on a tandemNew York Times, Published: 30 June 1901, English cyclist lost. and in the same year at the Crystal Palace track he completed an unpaced mile in 2 minutes 5 seconds. Gascoyne held the world record for an unpaced flying start quarter mile with a time of 25 seconds. =America= Gascoyne's international reputation was such that his prospective arrival in New York on the , accompanied by tandem partner Sydney Jenkins, was considered newsworthy by the New York Times of 5 June 1901.New York Times, 5 June 1901, Two More Foreign Cyclists Coming It went on to describe him as 'Thomas Jefferson Gascoyne' when it was promoting cycling events. Three days later he competed in the tandem races at Madison Square Garden with his partner Sydney Jenkins. The New York Times reported in June 1901 that: > ...[he] has followed the racing path since 1893. At unpaced work Gascoyne > possesses more than normal speed, and has the exceptional honour of never > having been beaten in a pursuit race. At the Boston cycle-track on Saturday 20 July 1901 he beat Major Taylor twice. The following day at the Vailsburg, Newark (New Jersey) cycle track he beat John Bedell in the half mile handicap for professionals but was then scheduled, without recovery time, to immediately contest an 'Australian Pursuit' race against W.S. Fenn from Waterbury, Connecticut. He was defeated after 3 miles, his first ever defeat in a pursuit.New York Times, 22 July 1901 Fenn defeats Gascoyne, =Australia= The Otago Witness of 1907 reported: > \\"Jeb\\" Gascoyne, as he was known on English, European and American tracks > less than a decade ago, made a worldwide reputation as an unpaced handicap > performer, and it is questionable whether any rider, Fenn or MacFarland > included, ever came up to the wonderful powers shown by Gascoyne. He is a > living exception of the proved rule in cycle racing that he who paces must > be left at the finish. He possesses a unique characteristic which will not > allow him to follow another competitor's wheel in a handicap. He must be in > front. Setting his head in his own peculiar style on one side, partly over > the front wheel, with grim determination and speedy pedalling he never fails > to bring the field back to him. From 1896 to 1901 he raced in various parts > of the world, and his marvellous unpaced efforts never failed to send the > crowds wild with excitement. In the early 1900s Gascoyne quietly dropped out of European racing and emigrated to Australia with his racing colleague H. Brown, a handicap specialist. They did manual work for several years but when they arrived in Newcastle they started entering cycle races using the pseudonyms of Mills and Atkinson. Despite an initial lack of fitness, Gascoyne's natural speed meant that he was soon relegated to 'scratch' in the handicap races at night carnivals. Eventually rumours spread and the two riders had to reveal their true identities but their integrity remained intact, they had simply retired from racing to concentrate on manual labour careers. As a stoker Gascoyne's breathing had suffered sufficiently for him to lose several early races, but the unmasked 'scratch' Gascoyne gave up stoking and started training for cycling again. He became particularly popular in Sydney, where he won the 1907 Five Mile Scratch Race on Anniversary night, and was a headline name at races.Australia Trove - The Argus (Melbourne, Vic. : 1848-1954) Thursday 11 March 1909.

He wrote letters replying to inquiries of the Umayyad caliphs, Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan and al-Walid I, involving questions about certain events that happened in the time of Muhammad. Since Abd al-Malik did not appreciate the maghƒÅzƒ´ literature, these letters were not written in story form. He is not known to have written any books on the subject.

This enzyme plays an important role in breaking down fatty material (cholesteryl esters and triglycerides) in the body. Infants, children and adults that suffer from LAL deficiency experience a range of serious health problems. The lack of the LAL enzyme can lead to a build-up of fatty material in a number of body organs including the liver, spleen, gut, in the wall of blood vessels and other important organs. Very low levels of the LAL enzyme lead to LAL deficiency. LAL deficiency typically affects infants in the first year of life. The accumulation of fat in the walls of the gut in early onset disease leads to serious digestive problems including malabsorption, a condition in which the gut fails to absorb nutrients and calories from food. Because of these digestive complications, affected infants usually fail to grow and gain weight at the expected rate for their age (failure to thrive). As the disease progresses, it can cause life-threatening liver dysfunction or liver failure. Until 2015, there was no treatment, and very few infants with LAL-D survived beyond the first year of life. In 2015, an enzyme replacement therapy, sebelipase alfa, was approved in the US and EU. The therapy was additionally approved in Japan in 2016. Symptoms  Infants may present with feeding difficulties with frequent vomiting, diarrhea, swelling of the abdomen, and failure to gain weight or sometimes weight loss. As the disease progresses in infants, increasing fat accumulation in the liver leads to other complications including yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice), and a persistent low-grade fever. An ultrasound examination shows accumulation of chalky material (calcification) in the adrenal gland in about half of infants with LAL-D. Learning Radiology.com Adrenal calcification Complications of LAL-D progress over time, eventually leading to life-threatening problems such as extremely low levels of circulating red blood cells (severe anemia), liver dysfunction or failure, and physical wasting (cachexia). People who are older children or adults generally present with a wide range of signs and symptoms that overlap with other disorders.Hoffman EP, Barr ML, Giovanni MA, et al. Lysosomal Acid Lipase Deficiency. 2015 Jul 30. In: Pagon RA, Adam MP, Ardinger HH, et al., editors. GeneReviews [Internet]. Seattle (WA): University of Washington, Seattle; 1993-2016. They may have diarrhoea, stomach pain, vomiting, or poor growth, a sign of malabsorption. They may have signs of bile duct problems, like itchiness, jaundice, pale stool, or dark urine. Their feces may be excessively greasy. They often have an enlarged liver, liver disease, and may have yellowish deposits of fat underneath the skin, usually around their eyelids. The disease is often undiagnosed in adults. The person may have a history of premature cardiac disease or premature stroke. Cause Lysosomal acid lipase deficiency is a genetic disease that is autosomal recessive. It is an inborn error of metabolism that causes a lysosomal storage disease. The condition is caused by a mutation of the LIPA gene, which is responsible for the gene coding of the lysosomal lipase protein (also called lysosomal acid lipase or LAL), which results in a loss of the protein's normal function. When LAL functions normally, it breaks down cholesteryl esters and triglycerides in low density lipoprotein particles into free cholesterol and free fatty acids that the body can reuse; when LAL doesn't function, cholesteryl esters and triglycerides build up in the liver, spleen and other organs. The accumulation of fat in the walls of the gut and other organs in leads to serious digestive problems including malabsorption, a condition in which the gut fails to absorb nutrients and calories from food, persistent and often forceful vomiting, frequent diarrhea, foul-smelling and fatty stools (steatorrhea), and failure to grow. Lysosomal acid lipase deficiencies occur when a person has defects (mutations) in both copies of the LIPA gene. Each parent of a person with LAL deficiency carries one copy of the defective LIPA gene. With every pregnancy, parents with a son or daughter affected by LAL deficiency have a 1 in 4 (25%) chance of having another affected child. A person born with defects in both LIPA genes is not able to produce adequate amounts of the LAL enzyme. Diagnosis Blood tests may show anaemia and their lipid profiles are generally similar to people with more common familial hypercholesterolemia, including elevated total cholesterol, elevated low- density lipoprotein cholesterol, decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and elevated serum transaminases. Liver biopsy findings will generally show a bright yellow-orange color, enlarged, lipid-laden hepatocytes and Kupffer cells, microvesicular and macrovesicular steatosis, fibrosis, and cirrhosis. The only definitive tests are genetic, which may be conducted in any number of ways. Screening Because LAL deficiency is inherited, each sibling of an affected individual has a 25% chance of having pathological mutations in LAL genes from both their mother and their father, a 50% chance of having a pathological mutation in only one gene, and a 25% chance of having no pathological mutations. Genetic testing for family members and genetic prenatal diagnosis of pregnancies for women who are at increased risk are possible if family members carrying pathological mutations have been identified. Management LAL deficiency can be treated with sebelipase alfa is a recombinant form of LAL that was approved in 2015 in the US and EU. The disease of LAL affects < 0.2 in 10,000 people in the EU. According to an estimate by a Barclays analyst, the drug will be priced at about US$375,000 per year. It is administered once a week via intraveneous infusion in people with rapidly progressing disease in the first six months of life. In people with less aggressive disease, it is given every other week.Sebelipase alfa Label Last updated Dec 2015. See FDA index page for labels here Before the drug was approved, treatment of infants was mainly focused on reducing specific complications and was provided in specialized centers. Specific interventions for infants included changing from breast or normal bottle formula to a specialized low fat formula, intravenous feeding, antibiotics for infections, and steroid replacement therapy because of concerns about adrenal function. Statins were used in people with LAL-D prior to the approval of sebelipase alfa; they helped control cholesterol but did not appear to slow liver damage; liver transplantation was necessary in most patients. Prognosis Infants with LAL deficiencies typically show signs of disease in the first weeks of life and if untreated, die within 6‚Äì12 months due to multi- organ failure. Older children or adults with LAL-D may remain undiagnosed or be misdiagnosed until they die early from a heart attack or stroke or die suddenly of liver failure. The first enzyme replacement therapy was approved in 2015. In those clinical trials nine infants were followed for one year; 6 of them lived beyond one year. Older children and adults were followed for 36 weeks. Epidemiology Depending on ethnicity and geography, prevalence has been estimated to be between 1 in 40,000 and 1 in 300,000; based on these estimates the disease may be underdiagnosed. Jewish infants of Iraqi or Iranian origin appear to be most at risk based on a study of a community in Los Angeles in which there was a prevalence of 1 in 4200. History In 1956, Moshe Wolman, along with two other doctors, published the first case study of a LAL deficiency in a child born to closely related Persian Jews; 12 years later a case study on an older boy was published, which turned out to be the first case study of LAL-D. LAL-D was historically referred to as 2 separate disorders: * Wolman disease, presenting in infant patients * Cholesteryl Ester Storage Disease, presenting in pediatric and adult patients Around 2010 both presentations have come to be known as LAL-D, as both are due to a deficiency of the LAL enzyme. In 2015 an enzyme replacement therapy, sebelipase alfa, was approved in the US and EU for the treatment of human LAL enzyme deficiency. Before the approval of that drug, as of 2009 the two oldest survivors of LAL-D in the world were then aged 4 and 11; both of them had been treated with hematopoietic stem cell treatment. Research directions Some children with LAL-D have had an experimental therapy called hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), also known as bone marrow transplant, to try to prevent the disease from getting worse. Data are sparse but there is a known high risk of serious complications including death, graft-versus-host disease.

History Early in the war, the United Kingdom's munitions industry found itself having difficulty producing the amount of weapons and ammunition needed by the country's armed forces. In response to the crisis, known as the Shell Crisis of 1915, the British government passed the Munitions of War Act 1915 to increase government oversight and regulation of the industry. The newly created Ministry of Munitions regulated wages, hours and employment conditions in munitions factories. It also forced the factories to admit more women as employees, because so many of the nation's men were engaged in fighting in the war and male labour was in short supply. Historian Angela Woollacott has estimated that approximately one million women were working in munitions industries by mid 1918. She suggests that a greater number of women worked in munitions than in the Voluntary Aid Detachment, the Women's Land Army or other such organisations. Historian Deborah Thom suggests that many workers had previous experience of factory work, though few had made munitions. But the specific type of the work was considered different: historian Patrica Fara notes that 90 percent of women who went into engineering trades entered domains not previously regarded as suitable for women, and most of these were employed in munitions works manufacturing cordite and TNT. Some women entering munitions work did so seeking better pay and fewer working hours than were customary in domestic service, pubs and laundries. Employers in these industries complained about losing their staff to munitions factories. The national munitions factory in Gretna, which was the largest industrial site in the world at the time, recorded that 36 percent of its workers had previously been in domestic service. By June 1917, roughly 80 percent of the weaponry and ammunition used by the British army during World War I was being made by munitionettes.  Working conditions  Conditions varied from factory to factory. At Gretna, the staff was mostly women, who worked in 12-hour shifts and lived in huts with their beds shared with someone on the opposite shift to minimise accommodation costs. The Health of Munitions Workers Committee reported that \\"women have accepted conditions of work which if continued must ultimately be disastrous to health\\". = TNT poisoning = Munitionettes worked with hazardous chemicals on a daily basis without adequate protection. Many women worked with trinitrotoluene (TNT), and prolonged exposure to the nitric acid that turned the women's skin a yellow colour. The women whose skin was turned yellow were popularly called canary girls. Prolonged exposure to the chemicals also created serious health risks for the munitionettes. Exposure over a long period of time to chemicals such as TNT can cause severe harm to the immune system. People exposed to TNT can experience liver failure, anemia, and spleen enlargement; TNT can even affect women‚Äôs fertility. Some side effects commonly included breast and lower region enlargement. = Explosions = Munitions workers faced risk of explosion due to the nature of the materials they handled. On several occasions, the explosives the women were working with ignited and injured or killed the workers. Explosions at British munitions factories during World War I included the 1916 Barnbow explosion in which 35 women died, the 1917 Silvertown explosion, in which 73 people were killed and over 400 injured, and a 1918 explosion at the National Shell Filling Factory, Chilwell, which killed over 130 workers. = Wages = There were no standard rates of pay for women when the war began, and food prices rose by a third in the year to July 1915, leaving women munitions workers that were on minimum rates earning below the level of a living wage. Rates of pay varied significantly at different factories and, until 1917, women were prevented from leaving one firm to move to another that would pay them better because they had to obtain a certificate from their previous employer stating that they had left with their employer's consent. Arbitration to enforce the Fair Wages Clause was too slow to solve the problem of women munition workers' wages.Munitionettes machining shell cases in the New Gun Factory, Woolwich Arsenal, LondonThe Munitions of War Act of July 1915 declared that the admission of 'semi-skilled or female labour shall not affect adversely the rates customarily paid for the job' or reduce the rates a man could be expected to pay. There was not an official statement as to what constituted \\"men's\\" work versus \\"women's\\" but in October, suggestions were made as to what women doing \\"men's\\" work should be paid. An amendment in January 1916 stated that the Minister of Munitions had the power to give directions as to the rate of wages of female workers, and introduced compulsory arbitration for disagreements between women workers and their employers. In the August 1917 Act, the certificate regulations preventing women from leaving factories without their employers' permission to earn higher wages elsewhere were repealed. Munitions workers presented an unusual case in the history of equal employment. The Ministry of Munitions approach to the principle \\"equal pay for equal work\\" was that: > Equality of pay for equal work is normally established by the fixing of new > rates after the introduction of women, which are either so high as to make > the continued employment of women at them uneconomical to the employer, or > so low as to render the occupation unattractive to men. In other words, employers chose not to employ women and pay them equally because they could employ men instead, or they employed so many women that men did not want the occupation and therefore there were no high men's wages to benchmark against, enabling employers to pay women relatively little for the work. However, munitions factories were in the position of having mostly women workers, but still enough men and recent memories of their wages against which to benchmark. Moreover, the Ministry of Munitions had pledged not to devalue men's work by paying lower rates whilst they were temporarily away at war in the 1915 Act. Men's unions had an interest in holding the Ministry to its promise, and unions that represented women campaigned for equality. Unions demanded \\"equal pay at men's rates\\" specifically rather than \\"equal pay for equal work\\". Employers and the Ministry argued that \\"it was not considered that one woman was the equivalent of one man\\", and that women needed more supervision and required new amenities. They also argued for differences between piece work and work paid based on time, suggesting that it was acceptable to pay equally per piece produced, but that they assumed that a woman might accomplish less in the same amount of time than a man so were reluctant to provide equal pay for time work. Unions also demanded equal war advances and bonuses for women on men's work. This demand was refused by the Ministry of Munitions on the principle that it would have been very expensive for the State and also that it would have been \\"unfair\\" to women working in new industries that men had not previously worked in and set expectations. At the end of the war, \\"out of work\\" payments were only given to women who could prove that they had worked before the war. Others were expected to return to their homes or to domestic service. = Supervisors = 90 percent of the approximately 1000 Women's Police Volunteers trained from 1914 were employed in munitions factories as supervisors to women workers. They were paid a weekly wage, whereas other volunteers were unpaid. = Culture and sport = Activities such as social clubs, theatrical societies, bands and debating groups were formed in munitions factories, and piano music and singing were especially popular. Such activities were often formed by workers and encouraged by welfare supervisors looking to increase morale and productivity. During the war, women's football was popular with munitionettes and the general public. The Munitionettes' Cup was a famous competition in north east England in 1917‚Äì18 held between women's football teams from various munitions and other factories. Matches attracted thousands of spectators and the leading players, such as Bella Raey, became famous. Some factories' managements appear to have considered their staff participating in football a \\"necessary evil\\" that contributed to productivity and discipline amongst women 'displaced from their traditional gender roles'.  Legacy  = Women in industry = Because large numbers of women were employed in munitions work during the war, the conditions of their employment had an impact on women after the war ended. Thom notes that the history of women's work in munitions factories is 'influentially mythical in creating a story of women's work which has emphasised women's secondary wage earning, vulnerability to male hostility and reliance upon government rather than their own organisations for improvement.' In November 1917, Churchill, who was the Minister of Munitions at the time, announced to women trade unionists that: > We are incomparably the greatest employers of women there has ever been in > the world, we are the pioneers of women's employment in the industrial and > even the military field. Whatever may be the future position which women's > labour will take after the war, it will be enormously influenced by the > actual practice which has been followed when so much in the making, and when > so much control is vested in the organisation of the Ministry of > Munitions... Now is the time during the Great War for us to perceive, > discover and proclaim the principles which should regulate, for perhaps the > lifetime of a whole generation and perhaps for longer, the lines of advance > on which women's industrial work should proceed. The precedent set was that women could be paid less than men and that they should resume their domestic roles to make way for the men returning from the front line. In the 1922 official history of women in munitions work and their wages, the government justified this by claiming that whereas \\"the man's wage is a \\"family\\" wage, the woman's is an \\"individual\\" wage\\" and by arguing that women did not unionise and fight for their rights and were therefore responsible for establishing the two standards. Women's contribution to the war effort showcased their capabilities, however, and has been credited with changing the way that women were regarded in society and adding considerable momentum to the women's suffrage movement. = Cultural references =Pat Barker's novel Regeneration includes a group of munitionettes who recount their experiences of war work.

In 1996, Haase and Bennett were given a Royal Pardon 11 months into 18-year prison sentences for heroin smuggling, having provided information leading to the seizure of firearms. The Home Secretary, Michael Howard, was criticized for the decision, and in 2008 Haase and Bennett were convicted of having set up the weapons finds to earn them their release, and sentenced to 20 and 22 years in prison respectively. Smuggling investigation Haase and Bennett were arrested in 1993 following a long investigation by the British Customs and Excise organisation which was subsequently described in a book by one of the investigating officers. Officers followed a major heroin shipment (worth approximately ¬£18 million) destined for Liverpool as part of a larger investigation into 'Volkan', a Turkish heroin smuggler. As the officers arrested many members of the gang in and around Liverpool, Haase and Bennett nearly slipped through the net, but were arrested in Croydon, south London. Trial and sentence After sentencing the two men to 18 years each in prison, Judge David Lynch was contacted by the customs officer in charge of the investigation, Paul Cook. He had been in discussions with Haase and Bennett's solicitor, Tony Nelson, who suggested that in return for their providing information, Customs would undertake to bring any help they gave to the notice of the trial judge, so that they could seek a reduced sentence.https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/nov/09/uk.drugsandalcohol The trial judge then wrote privately to the Home Secretary, recommending that he 'exercise the Royal prerogative of mercy' on account of information that the pair had given that had led to the seizure of illegal firearms. Michael Howard ordered their release, which took place on 4 July 1996, and they served less than a year of the sentence. When questioned about his decision, Howard wrote, \\"I can neither reveal, nor overstate the risks which would flow from revealing any of the details which confidentially had been placed before him (the judge) by the prosecuting authorities, save to say that the information had proved to offer quite enormous and unique assistance to the law- enforcement agencies\\". Police recovered many firearms, including AK-47 and M16A2 assault rifles, Czechoslovak Sa vz. 23 submachine guns, Thompson submachine guns, Uzi sub-machine guns, shotguns, ammunition and Semtex explosive. Perversion of the course of justice case Doubts were expressed by police and Customs and Excise officers as to the authenticity of the information that Haase and Bennett gave, and local Liverpool MP, Peter Kilfoyle campaigned for an investigation. In March 2001, Kilfoyle was granted a half-hour Adjournment debate in the House of Commons at which he brought up the subject of Haase and Bennett; specifically the damage done to the people of Liverpool by them being allowed back onto the street after such a short period of time in prison, and the basis on which they got out (that is, the Royal pardon they received).House of Commons Hansard Debates for 7 Mar 2001 (pt 27) During 2003, it was widely reported that a drug dealer and associate of the two heroin smugglers, Simon Bakerman, who was a cousin of Michael Howard and who openly boasted of his relationship with him, had received a bribe of ¬£400,000 from Haase, which may have been intended to be passed on to the politician. There is no evidence that any such monies were passed on, or that Howard acted in any inappropriate way.New Statesman: This man is one of Britain's most dangerous drug lords. Why did Michael Howard let him out of jail after ten months? 14 Feb 2005, accessed 5 Jun 2018 Merseyside Police now believe that Customs, the trial judge and Howard himself were duped by an elaborate plot by Haase and Bennett, who arranged for the drugs and guns to be planted where the authorities could find them. In May 2004, Kilfoyle again brought up the matter at an Adjournment debate. He had visited Haase in prison earlier in 2004, and had obtained a sworn affidavit. The drug smuggler had provided \\"leads\\" about the guns which had in fact been planted at the request of him and his accomplice, Bennett. In the affidavit, Haase admitted contacting his acquaintances who were not in prison and getting them to plant guns across Merseyside and the North West of England. He then passed information about the guns' locations to his customs handler Paul Cook, suggesting the guns belonged to other criminals. Haase added, \\"It was a con all the way.\\" Kilfoyle concluded his comments in the Adjournment debate by saying:House of Commons Hansard Debates for 21 May 2004 (pt 20) Following the conclusion of the trial at which the two drug barons received sentences of 20 and 22 years for perverting the course of justice in 2008, Kilfoyle called for an independent enquiry into the issues surrounding the case.MP demands 'supergrass' inquiry He said:House of Commons Hansard Debates for 25 Nov 2008 (pt 0016) References 1948 births Living people British drug traffickers English mobsters Criminals from Merseyside Prisoners and detainees of the United Kingdom Recipients of British royal pardons British people convicted of perverting the course of justice ","title":"John Haase (criminal)"},{"id":"30896208","text":"A burning R√§ucherkerzchen A R√§ucherkerze, R√§ucherkerzchen or R√§ucherkegel (literally \\"smoking candle\\", \\"little smoking candle\\" or \\"smoking cone\\") is an incense cone burned at Christmas time in Germany and in the Czech Republic in order to create pleasant scents around the house.  History  The emergence of R√§ucherkerzen goes back to the use of frankincense in Catholic liturgy. According to tradition the manufacture of little candles in Crottendorf in the Ore Mountains was established by 1750. But it was not until the advent of modern Christmas customs in the middle of the 19th century and the manufacture of the first R√§ucherm√§nnchen that they spread beyond the Ore Mountains.  Materials and production  R√§ucherkerzen manufacturers: KNOX, Crottendorfer and Huss Incense houses (R√§ucherh√§uschen) The cones are made from the resin of the Frankincense tree, charcoal, potato flour, sandalwood and beech paste. These substances are ground together, stirred into a moist dough, and then shaped. The incense candles are produced mainly in three locations in Saxony: in Neudorf under the name of Huss-Original Neudorfer R√§ucherkerzen, in Crottendorf as Original Crottendorfer R√§ucherkerzen and in Mohorn-Grund, a village in the borough of Wilsdruff, as KNOX. Outside Saxony they are made in the Crottendorf-founded Carl Jaeger R√§uchermittelfabrik in H√∂chst im Odenwald and, since 1997, in Bockau under the name Bockauer R√§ucherkerzen.  Scents  As well as candles with traditional \\"Christmas scents\\" like frankincense, pine, honey and cinnamon, candles are also made with scents associated with other times of the year.

Established in 1989, SOLS delivers programs and services to Ontario public libraries in the southern half of the province, in a geographic area bounded by Windsor in the south, to Ottawa and the Quebec border in the east, and as far north as Muskoka. Almost 200 library systems are included in this group, ranging from libraries in small communities to libraries in cities with populations in the hundreds of thousands. The Ontario Library Service North (OLS-North) performs equivalent service for the northern portion of the province. SOLS mission statement is as follows: \\"The people of Ontario, as represented by the Minister with jurisdiction for public libraries, will have equitable access to library services at a sustainable cost.\\" SOLS is responsible for a number of services. * Manage the province wide resource sharing network (interlibrary loan) and the related courier service * Providing libraries with information and advice on management, governance, and accreditation issues * Managing and supporting numerous training and library skills development programs * Providing opportunities for libraries to network and exchange information, both face to face and electronically * Managing shared electronic, print and non-print collections * Operate a catalogue system * Technical support As a result of budget cuts to the Ontario Ministry of Tourism and Culture in the 2019 Ontario budget, the budget for SOLS was reduced by 50% from $3 million to $1.5 million. A spokesperson for Michael Tibollo, the Minister of Tourism, Culture and Sport, stated that SOLS and OLS- North are \\"arms-length agencies that have no involvement in the day-to-day operations of Ontario‚Äôs public libraries\\". The interlibrary loan network was operated using a van delivery system and postal service. The van delivery program was terminated after the budget cuts, eliminating 24 delivery driver jobs, and the full program was discontinued on 26 April 2019. Tibollo stated in a letter that the van-based program, which cost about $1.3 million per year, was \\"very inefficient\\" and could be replaced \\"by using mail, at less than 25 per cent of the existing cost\\". The program had also provided delivery service between branches of some library systems, for example the four branches of King Township Public Library. It also resulted in the cancellation of interlibrary loan from other provinces; library systems may honour such requests, but must fund the program instead of using SOLS.

It is a contributing property to the May's Island Historic District that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. The building served as the Cedar Rapids City Hall until it was damaged in the Flood of 2008. The Building underwent a ribbon-cutting ceremony to mark its official re-opening April 15, 2014. History A petition to construct a memorial building was filed with the City Clerk on March 4, 1925. Over 40 civic organizations were involved in planning for the structure. Voters passed a bond referendum and a Veterans Memorial Commission was formed. Construction was completed in 1927. Plans were drawn and the building was placed on May's Island. In order to make the building financially feasible, a new city hall was incorporated into the plans. Cedar Rapids, after Paris, France's H√¥tel de Ville on the √éle de la Cit√©, and Osaka, Japan, would be only one of three cities to have its government located on an island. The building also contains a Memorial Window, Memorial Auditorium and a Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. The building was designed in the Beaux-Arts style. The main portion of the building contains four stories, with an eight-story section in the front. A cenotaph tops the eight-story section. The auditorium contains seven banners from veterans' organizations, and seven American flags were suspended from the ceiling. A Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is located above the cenotaph. The first addition to the building was a statue of the raising of the flag at Iwo Jima, which was placed on the front steps in 1960. It is a memorial to veterans of World War II and the Korean War. The Veterans Memorial Commission added a museum in 1966, which contains items from the American Revolution through the Vietnam War. The museum was dedicated as a memorial to the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. A granite monument memorializes those who served in the Vietnam War. In 2000 an eternal flame was lit on top of the building. GEN Tommy Franks speaking at the Veterans Memorial Building April 15, 2014 The buildings sustained damage as a result of the 2008 flood. As a result, the city government was forced to leave the building. In the aftermath the city decided to move the city offices to the former Federal Courthouse. The city was able to take possession of the building after it provided the land for a new courthouse downtown. The City Council began holding its meetings in the former courthouse on June 26, 2011, and the facility was opened for public use on June 4, 2012.

Morgenstern is regarded as one of the pioneers in Germany of early Realism in painting. He gained this reputation in Hamburg 1826-1829 together with his contemporary Adolph Friedrich Vollmer while both were still studying;Thieme-Becker 34 (1940) 527. from 1830 onwards, Morgenstern, together with Friedrich Wasmann, Johan Christian Dahl and Adolph Menzel, introduced Munich to Realist painting.Schmidt in: Thieme-Becker 25 (1931) 148-149.  Life  Landschaft mit Waldweg und Reiter or Landscape with forest path and rider (1849) Morgenstern was born in Hamburg as one of six children to a painter of miniatures, Johann Heinrich Morgenstern (1769‚Äì1813). After the early death of his father he was placed as an apprentice in the graphic workshop of the brothers Suhr. Cornelius Suhr took the young Morgenstern as his servant on a two-year journey through Germany to publicise the panorama prints which the brothers Suhr produced. 1822 followed another long journey to St. Petersburg, where they stayed for a year and to Moscow. On their return to Hamburg Morgenstern succeeded in leaving Suhr (Vollmer took his place). He became a student of the Hamburg painter Siegfried Bendixen with whom he stayed from 1824 to 1827, then continued his studies at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen (1827‚Äì1828) and undertook study journeys through Sweden and Norway. Bendixen introduced him to the wealthy aristocrat and supporter of the arts, Carl Friedrich von Rumohr, patron to many young Hamburg artists, on whose estate in Holstein he spent several summers.Andresen 2 (1872) 221-249. In 1830 Morgenstern went to Munich on Ruhmor‚Äôs advice. He settled there permanently while undertaking extensive yearly study trips: for the first years through Bavaria, then in the summer of 1836 and in the following summers to the Alsace as guest of a patron of the arts. Oak-trees near water (1832) The winter 1839/40 he returned to Hamburg to stay with his mother. In 1841 he visited Venice and Trieste together with the landscape painter Eduard Schleich the Elder and in 1843, and again in 1846 the central Alps. In the summer of 1850 he stayed on Heligoland. From 1853 onwards Morgenstern spent the summers in Dachau with family and friends, and from 1860 onwards, often by the Chiemsee and by Lake Starnberg. In 1844 Morgenstern married Louise von L√ºneschlo√ü (1804‚Äì1874), the adopted daughter of a painter of miniatures, Carlo Restallino.Andresen (1872) 2, 230. Their son Carl Ernst Morgenstern (1847‚Äì1928) also became a landscape painter. He was the father of the famous writer and poet Christian Morgenstern (1871‚Äì1914).Thieme-Becker 25 (1931) 148. Morgenstern died in Munich.  Importance  Morgenstern was highly regarded in his lifetime. Seen from today his importance lies predominately in his early realistic work. When Carl Rottmann returned from Greece in 1835 they became close and livelong friends. Both artists are said to have influenced each other.Andresen (1872) 2, 228. Rottman‚Äôs influence is regarded by the art historian Paul F. Schmidt(1878-1955) Director of the Dresdner Stadtmuseum in the 1920s as detrimental to the work of Morgenstern. In 1931 Schmidt wrote (paraphrased): As important as Morgenstern had been around 1830 in Germany for the development of an independent pre-impressionism, through the influence of the late-romantic style of Rottmann and the D√ºsseldorf group his work increasingly conformed to contemporary taste towards exaggerated Romanticism that tends towards emotional deception.

This corresponds to Shirakavan settlement of Historical Armenia, also known by its older name of Yerazgavors, developed into a small town in the mid-ninth century AD. It was located about 25 km Northeast of Ani, the capital of the medieval Bagratid (Bagratuni) Armenian Kingdom.  History  S. Amenaprkitch was commissioned by the Bagratid King Smbat I in Yerazgavors (Shirakashat) town in Shirak district of Historical Armenia's Ayrarat region. The date of construction started was probably after 892 (the year of Smbat's coronation) and 893 (when an earthquake is known to have struck the town). Catholicos Yovhanness wrote in his \\"History of Armenia\\" that the church in Shirakawan was consecrated shortly after his elevation to the patriarchal throne (which took place in 897/898), and that it was located near the royal palace. Monastery was sacked by the Seljuk Turks in the 1060s but was rebuilt during the Zakarid period at the end of the 12th century. An inscription on its walls mentioned that restoration work was undertaken between 1072 and 1081. At a later date the church was converted into a fortified tower. During this conversion the eastern niches and many of the windows were filled in, and the corners of the church were heightened. An external staircase was also added at the northern end of the west fa√ßade. The dome of the church had collapsed by the 19th century. Nikolai Marr noted the remains of the polygonal drum of the original dome. That dome had collapsed at a distant period and had been replaced by a conical dome with a smaller diameter. The replacement dome had also mostly collapsed and had been replaced by a covering of wooden beams that were, by 1913, rotten and about to fail. Marr wrote that in 1913 the building was undergoing repairs and was being converted into the village's parish church. He mentions that during those repairs the villagers had dug up many architectural fragments, but none had been recorded and most had just been reused in new buildings. He also mentions \\"two magnificent capitals\\" that had been recovered by the villagers and were now stored inside the church.

It was founded in 2008 by James Thornton. As lawyers and environmental experts, they use the law to hold governments and other companies to account over climate change, nature loss and pollution In 2017, ClientEarth was named the most effective environmental group by green leaders.https://www.greenfunders.org/what-the-green-groups-said/ In 2012 BusinessGreen gave ClientEarth its NGO of the Year award. In 2013 ClientEarth was awarded the Law Society's LSA Award for Excellence in Environmental Responsibility.https://web.archive.org/web/20131203170551/http://www.lawsociety.org.uk/representation/excellence- awards/2013-winners/legal-sector-alliance-award-for-excellence-in- environmental-responsibility/ Activities and campaigns =Access to justice= ClientEarth is attempting to make it a legal right for European citizens and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to bring environmental cases to court. In 2010, ClientEarth were successful in a legal challenge to get UK courts to accept the Aarhus Convention; this convention obliges governments to give rights and remove financial barriers to NGOs and individuals to mount legal challenges to cases of environmental damage. In 2011 ClientEarth announced the launch of its European Aarhus Centre. It provides citizens and Non-governmental organisations with the legal expertise necessary to improve access to information and justice in the EU. = Air Pollution = In July 2011 ClientEarth submitted a case to the High Court, challenging Defra on its failure to protect UK citizens' health from the harmful impacts of air pollution. ClientEarth lawyers insisted not enough was being done after the UK breached EU limits for nitrogen dioxide. In 2015 ClientEarth won the case. In total ClientEarth has won three High Court rulings ordering the UK government to produce stronger plans to improve air quality. The third judgment against the Environment Secretary and Transport Secretary forced urgent changes to UK government policy on air quality. In 2019, analysis by ClientEarth showed that 83% of UK areas failed to comply with EU legal limits. ClientEarth continue to lobby the UK government to do everything possible to meet air pollution legal limits quickly. ClientEarth also work on tackling air pollution across Europe. ClientEarth have brought nearly 40 legal actions in Germany over breaches of air pollution law. In 2015 along with partner organisation Deutsche Umwelthlife ClientEarth brought legal action over illegal nitrogen dioxide levels in Munich. Following their legal action, the EU's top court has issued multiple ‚Ç¨10,000 fines to the Bavarian government for failing to act on the ruling. In 2019, the Court of Justice of the European Union ruled that the German authorities refusal to follow court orders is a breach of fundamental human rights and German ministers could face prison. In 2016 ClientEarth brought a case against the Brussels regional government for a failure to tackle illegal levels of air pollution. They brought the case on behalf of a group of residents in Brussels. The case went to the European Court of Justice who ruled that citizens in Brussels have the right to go to court to challenge how authorities monitor air pollution. In 2017, ClientEarth launched legal action against Lombardy, Europe's most polluted region to force the authorities to tackle the public health emergency. =Agrofuels= Along with three other environmental groups (Transport and Environment, the European Environmental Bureau and BirdLife International), ClientEarth filed a lawsuit against the European Commission in March 2010. The groups sued the commission for not releasing important documents concerning biofuels in line with transparency rules. In September of the same year, the four groups filed a second lawsuit against the commission, to attempt to gain the release of documentation regarding the negative environmental impact of biofuels. Despite speculation that biofuels would create more climate-warming emissions than petrol or diesel, a Commission- funded study had suggested that EU biofuel policy would reduce carbon emissions; however, this conclusion was subsequently shown to be based on flawed assumptions chosen by the commission. =Coal industry= ClientEarth have taken over 75 legal interventions against coal across ten countries. Their work focuses on using the law to close coal plants or stop new coal plants being built. Their key successes include: Belchatow, Poland Belchatow is Europe's largest coal plant and its carbon emissions are equivalent to those of the whole of New Zealand. ClientEarth took a legal challenge to eliminate the plant's carbon footprint by 2035. Their lawsuit demands the plant operators, state-owned power giant Polska Grupa Energetyczna, stop burning lignite or take measures to eliminate the plant's carbon emissions, by 2035. ClientEarth is also challenging the operation of two neighbouring opencast mines, arguing that lignite mining causes significant disturbance to groundwater levels and releases toxic heavy metals into surrounding water and soil. Polnoc, Poland In 2011, ClientEarth challenged plans by company Polenergia had planned to construct a 1.6GW coal power plant. The plant would have been the largest new installation of its kind in the EU emitting 8 million tons of CO2 a year. The permit for the plant ignored glaring environmental issues. Following a complaint by ClientEarth's environmental lawyers and a multi-year legal battle, Poland's Supreme Administrative Court ruled that Polnoc coal plant will never be built. Ostroleka C, Poland In February 2020 Polish authorities announced they will suspend funding to the country's last planned new coal plant, Ostroleka C. ClientEarth hailed it ‚Äòthe end for new coal‚Äô in Europe. ClientEarth won two legal cases against the project's sponsors In October 2018, ClientEarth filed a challenge against Enea over financial risks to investors amid rising carbon prices, cheaper renewables and EU reforms on state subsidies for coal power plants. The courts ruled in August 2019 that the decision to proceed with the project had never been valid. In a separate decision, the courts demanded the company publish documents that would explain how the plant would be profitable. Rovinari, Romania In ClientEarth submitted a legal challenge against the permit for Rovinari, a coal-fired power plant in southwestern Romania. The plant ranks among Europe's worst for its impact on human health. Rovinari is also upstream from an EU nature protection site that contains dozens of threatened habitats and species. ClientEarth's legal challenge asserts that the regional authority did not assess the plant's environmental, climate or health impacts. Meliti I and II, Greece ClientEarth launched a legal challenge that sought to revoke a permit for two coal-fired power plants in Greece ‚Äì Meliti I and its sister plant Meliti II. ClientEarth asserted that Greece did not carry out an environmental impact assessment on the plant's impact on health, the environment or the climate, breaching EU laws. In January 2020 the Greek Council of State cancelled the permits. The ruling means that Meliti II will not proceed while the existing unit will require a fresh permit to continue operation. State Aid Along with Greenpeace, WWF, Spanish energy companies and the regional authority of Galicia, ClientEarth has intervened regarding the European Commission's decision to approve subsidies to the Spanish coal industry. The approved plan gives preferential access to the wholesale electricity market in Spain for power plants that run on domestic coal. Spanish electricity utilities, including Gas Natural, Iberdrola and Endesa have claimed that this will force them to withdraw from contracts for cheaper imported coal and buy more expensive, lower-quality domestic coal, while the parties have also argued that the decision breaches European laws on state aid and the environment, and that the Spanish government aid will unfairly skew the European energy market. ClientEarth also expressed concern that, if the decision was allowed to stand, other countries may be tempted to use similar tactics to bolster their coal sectors. They and the other environmental groups rejected Spain's position that it was attempting to protect the nation's energy security, arguing that the country has an oversupply of natural gas and, at times, renewable energy. =Company reporting= ClientEarth brings legal interventions designed to integrate climate-related financial risks into corporate and financial decision making. In February 2020 their CEO James Thornton wrote a letter to Barclays‚Äô chairman warning of the risks associated with continuing to invest in fossil fuels. The letter urged the bank's chairman to toughen the lender's rules on the energy industry. ClientEarth also provided support to the Church Commissioners for England's call for commodities giant Glencore to significantly strengthen its commitment to combat climate change. In February 2019 Glencore announced it has agreed to align its business and investments with the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change. In 2018, ClientEarth lawyers reported Easyjet, Balfour Beatty, EnQuest and Bodycote to the Financial Reporting Council following concerns that they failed to address climate change threats in their reports to shareholders. In August 2018 ClientEarth reported three large UK insurance companies ‚Äì Lancashire, Admiral and Phoenix - to the Financial Conduct Authority for failing to explain the risks from climate change. They called for the Financial Conduct Authority to fine the three companies and compel them to publish more information. . ClientEarth have written to the Financial Reporting Review Panel asking that they properly enforce the Companies Act, the law regarding company reporting of environmental and social issues. ClientEarth charge that such reports often do not adequately consider risks and impacts in these areas, and have proposed an overhaul of the law for when the Act is reviewed. In July 2010, ClientEarth made a specific complaint regarding mining company Rio Tinto, arguing that statements in the company's annual reports contradicted accounts from other sources including government agencies, NGOs and journalists. ClientEarth argued that, if verified, Rio Tinto's reports would not comply with UK law. =Marine protection= In 2008, ClientEarth sued the French government for failing to enforce a ban on drift net fishing, but the claim was rejected by the French court in Paris. The court also declined a later request for an emergency order, that would have forced the government to intervene. An investigation by ClientEarth in 2010 found that 32 of 100 fish product labels at nine supermarkets had unverified or misleading claims on sustainability or protection of the marine environment, such as \\"dolphin-friendly\\". In addition, the organisation expressed concern that labels often did not make clear that many fish products came from threatened stocks, or that they were caught using techniques that had potential to damage the environment or other species. ClientEarth called for supermarkets to remove or correct these labels, or risk breaching consumer protection laws. In 2010, ClientEarth voiced its opposition to the EU's potential to force its member states' abstention from a vote regarding the introduction of whaling quotas. The EU had changed whale protection's categorisation from a conservation issue to a fisheries issue, which it believed would allow the forced abstention if the member states could not reach a unanimous agreement; ClientEarth argued that EU law did not allow for this re-classification, and that the instruction to abstain would be illegal as unanimity is not required on conservation issues. ClientEarth also noted that, where EU states cannot agree on international environmental issues, Union Laws require them to vote to protect and strengthen an existing EU position; thus, they argued that the member states should vote against the International Whaling Commission's plan to allow the resumption of commercial whaling. Also in 2010, ClientEarth highlighted to the EU fisheries ministers that, given the rapid decline of bluefin tuna stocks, they were legally obliged to ban bluefin fishing in the Mediterranean and Atlantic for at least three years, from 2011‚Äì2013. ClientEarth also argued that France's overfishing in 2007 meant they should be banned from receiving any bluefin catch quota in 2011, and that Italy should also be penalised for overfishing, although less severely than France. However, following the meeting of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), the European Council announced that it unanimously agreed to support total allowable catches (TACs) in line with ICCAT's scientific advice. ClientEarth argued that these TACs would mean only a 30-45 percent likelihood that bluefin levels would recover by 2020, despite EU law demanding that all fish stocks are at sustainable levels by this date. ClientEarth is currently supporting Fish Fight, a campaign backed by Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Channel 4, that aims to stop the practice of discarding fish under the Common Fisheries Policy. =Oil industry= ClientEarth has complained to the Financial Reporting Review Panel regarding the activities of oil company BP. They argued that the company used a highly unrealistic scenario when predicting future energy demand, enabling them to justify continued investment in risky extraction methods. =Transparency= In 2010, ClientEarth filed a lawsuit against the Council of the European Union, regarding plans to revise the EU's 2002 access-to-documents law, which gives individuals the right to view internal EU documents. ClientEarth sued the Council over its alleged failure to disclose its in-house legal opinion about the review of the 2002 rules.

Advancing tailored Health communication: A persuasion and message effects perspective. Journal of Communication, 56, s184-s201. Taking into account specific characteristics that the group members share in common, only one version of program materials is used in a targeted health intervention. The intervention materials show features that the targeted population subgroup members prefer.Kreuter, M. W., Lukwago, S. N., Bucholtz, D. C., Clark, E. M., & Sanders-Thompson, V. (2002). Achieving cultural appropriateness in health promotion programs: Targeted and tailored approaches. Health Education and Behavior, 30(2), 133-146. Cultural targeting applied in clinical interventions has demonstrated improvements in health behaviors and knowledge for targeted populations, which supports the potential for this strategy to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in health care. History The idea of targeting was adapted from marketing. Target marketing tries to define a subgroup of people with shared characteristics (such as liking of certain product features) as the right group of consumers for a particular product or service. Adopting the same principle, targeted health interventions identify a group of people who are particular vulnerable to certain health risks, intervene to address their health risks and in turn, improve their health. From early to mid-1980s, most health information was mass-produced for undifferentiated audience in the form of brochures, pamphlets, and booklets.. Rimer, B. K. & Kreuter, M .W. (2006). Advancing tailored Health communication: A persuasion and message effects perspective. Journal of Communication, 56, s184-s201. As people are increasingly aware of different characteristics within mass audiences, behavioral scientists began to develop different versions of materials for diverse population subgroups in order for health campaigns to be cost effective while still reaching large number of audiences.Rimer, B. K., & Glassman, B. (1998). Tailoring communications for primary care settings.Methods of Information in Medicine, 37(2), 171‚Äì177.Slater, M., & Flora, J. (1991). Health lifestyles: Audience segmentation analysis for public health interventions. Health Education Quarterly, 18, 221‚Äì233. Scholars have suggested that compared to generic interventions which do not take into consideration the audience characteristics, targeting strategy can be more effective for health interventions.Kreuter, M., Strecher,V., Glassman, B. (1999). One size does not fit all: The case for tailoring print materials. Annual Behavioral Medicine, 21, 1-9. Audience factors Targeting as an intervention strategy is now widely used in the health fields and has been found to help promote behavioral change.Kreuter, M., Strecher,V., Glassman, B. (1999). One size does not fit all: The case for tailoring print materials. Annual Behavioral Medicine, 21, 1-9. The level of audience specificity in targeting can vary significantly, ranging from one single broad factor (e.g. interventions targeting women), to combined factors. For example, Gomez, Tan, Keegan, and Clarke (2007) identified South Asians in the U.S. who were less than age 50 and were unemployed or non-citizens as potential population subgroup for targeted mammogram utilization intervention.Gomez, S. L., Tan, S., Keegan, T. HM., & Clarke, C. A. (2007). Disparities in mammographic screening for Asian women in California: A cross-sectional analysis to identify meaningful groups for targeted intervention. BMC Cancer, 7, 201-213.

P., Hoyle, R. H., Stephenson, M. T. (2001). Television campaigns and adolescent marijuana use: Tests of sensation seeking targeting. American Journal of Public Health, 91(2), 292-296.). In international health Targeting has been widely used in international health interventions and was found to be effective in promoting behavioral change. Ahmed, Petzold, Kabir, and Tomson (2006) identified the problem in Bangladesh that there was not enough usage of formal health services among the ultra poor population.Ahmed, S. M., Petzold, M., Kabir, Z. N., & Tomson, G. (2006). Targeted intervention for the ultra poor in rural Bangladesh: Does it make any difference in their health-seeking behaviour? Social Science & Medicine, 63(11), 2899-2911. In order to promote greater use of these health services, Ahmed and colleagues carried out a health intervention in Bangladesh targeting ultra poor households in rural areas in order to change their health-seeking behavior. The intervention provided ultra poor households with money for household activities (e.g. raising livestock, vegetables farming) to increase their income. In addition, it provided 18 months of supports, such as skill training (e.g. vegetable cultivation) and counseling information on health services, to make sure that the targeted people were able to make full use of the money and had the resources to use the health services if they chose to. This targeted intervention was found to be effective that it decreased the amount of self- care and increased the use of professional health care among the targeted population. In another intervention, Lowndes, Alary, Labbe, et al. (2007) targeted male clients of female sex workers in Benin, West Africa, in order to reduce the male clients' risky sexual behavior and HIV/STI rates.Lowndes, C. M., Alary, M., Labbe, A-C., Gnintoungbe, C., Belleau, M., Mukenge, L., Meda, H., Ndour, M., Anagonou, S., & Gbaguidi, A. (2007). Interventions among male clients of female sex workers in Benin, West Africa: An essential component of targeted HIV preventive interventions. Sexually Transmitted Infection, 83, 577-581. During this peer-education intervention, trained health educators approached male clients at prostitution venues at night, discussed with them HIV and STI transmission risks, educated them about proper condom use, and distributed condoms. Although HIV prevalence remained unchanged, the intervention effectively affected knowledge and there was an increase in the condom use rate among the targeted population. Ethical considerations Despite its effectiveness in promoting behavioral change, targeting strategy should be used with caution and with careful considerations of ethics. Kass (2001) suggested that interventions targeting already vulnerable segments of the population may face certain ethical challenges.Kass, N. E. (2001). An ethics framework for public health. American Journal of Public Health, 91(11), 1776-1782. Potential burden and harm in these health programs may include risks to privacy and confidentiality, risks to liberty and self-determination, and risks to justice. Subgroups who are targeted in interventions take most of the burden from the process (for example, their privacy may be intruded) while the benefits resulted from the health interventions are for the general public (e.g. improvements in mortality). Kass posed the question whether the unequal distribution of burden and benefits is ethical. Moreover, the evidence of intervention effectiveness may not be strong enough at times. Thus it may not be known for sure whether the benefits the targeted audience may gain from the intervention will outweigh the harms they will be put in. Hence, health experts face another ethical dilemma. Kass further pointed out that targeting may create stigma that some segments of the population are more vulnerable to certain diseases, which might result in social harms, such as psychological distress and discrimination. For example, although the HIV interventions targeting male clients of female sex workers in BeninLowndes, C. M., Alary, M., Labbe, A-C., Gnintoungbe, C., Belleau, M., Mukenge, L., Meda, H., Ndour, M., Anagonou, S., & Gbaguidi, A. (2007). Interventions among male clients of female sex workers in Benin, West Africa: An essential component of targeted HIV preventive interventions. Sexually Transmitted Infection, 83, 577-581. contributed to HIV prevention, one possible stigma that it may create is that male clients of female sex workers are high risk population of HIV infection. This stigma may create anxiety and panic among the targeted population. On the other hand, if a subgroup were never targeted in interventions, they may not believe that they are at the risk of diseases. People who were not targeted in HIV interventions, e.g. people with regular sex partners, may perceive themselves as not at the risk of HIV infection and hence continue engaging in risky sexual behaviors. Given the above discussed ethical dilemma that targeted health interventions may face, Kass suggested that, if health programs and health resources are going to be unequally allocated (e.g. targeting ethnic minority groups), they should be done with caution and be based on strong intervention effectiveness evidences. Targeting or tailoring? Competing definitions While Kreuter and Skinner's (2000) definition of targeting \\"the development of a single intervention approach for a defined population subgroup that takes into account characteristics shared by the subgroups' members\\" is now widely accepted in international health, targeting was defined in a few different ways.Kreuter, M. W. & Skinner, C. S. (2000). Tailoring: what's in a name? Health Education Research, 15(1), 1-4. It is important to understand the concept of tailoring in order to capture the idea of targeting, as interventions using targeting strategy were mislabeled as tailoring in some health interventions.Rimer, B. K., Orleans, C. T., Fleischer, L., Cristinzio, S., Resch, N., Telepchak, J., et al. (1994). Does tailoring matter? The impact of a tailored guide on ratings and short-term smoking- related outcomes for older smokers. Health Education Research, Theory and Practice, 9(1), 69‚Äì84. Pasick (1997)defined tailoring as \\"the adaptation of interventions to best fit the relevant needs and characteristics of a specified target population\\".Pasick, R. J. (1997). Socioeconomic and culture factors in the development and use of theory. In K. Glanz, F. M. Lewis, & B. K. Rimer (Eds.), Health Behavior and Health Education: Theory, Research and Practice (pp.425-440). San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass. Eakin and colleagues described tailoring as \\"a process of producing a video whose content and characters are adapted for or designed to appeal to a particular target population\\". Both statements would now be considered as a more appropriate definition of \\"targeting\\" according to Kreuter and Skinner (2000). The primary distinction between the two approaches, targeting and tailoring, is the scale at which they are implemented. Targeting is meant to design information for a defined population subgroup while tailoring is to develop interventions for one specific person based on the individual characteristics. Another competing definition of targeting was developed by Rimal and Adkin (2003).Rimal, R. N. & Adkin, A. D. (2003). Using computers to narrowcast health messages: The role of audience segmentation, targeting and tailoring in health promotion. In A. M. Dorsey, K. I. Miller, R. Parrott, & T. L. Thompson (Eds.), Handbook of Health Communication (pp. 497-513). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. They stated that both targeting and tailoring should follow the audience segmentation process, which is to divide audience into highly homogeneous clusters. They distinguish targeting and tailoring by suggesting that targeting is the selection of communication channel for the health campaign while tailoring is about message design. Despite the wide acceptance of the Kreuter and Skinner (2000) definition, Rimer (2000 pointed out that, although some \\"tailored\\" intervention would now be appropriately labeled as \\"targeted\\" intervention, these published projects are out there and the article titles remain as \\"tailored\\", which might create confusion.Rimer, B. K. (2000). Response to Kreuter and Skinner. Health Education Research, 15(4), 503. Rimer suggested that precision of language is important in order to avoid confusion. For people who are trying to understand targeting and tailoring, it is important to keep in mind the inconsistent labeling of targeting and tailoring in earlier published articles and to make critical judgments when reading.

John Fitzgerald era  John Purcell Fitzgerald, Member of Parliament and estate owner, started to sink shafts to the Three Foot and Worsley Four Foot mines at Whit Lane, Pendleton on his estate in the late 1820s. The shafts were on the west side of the Manchester, Bolton and Bury Canal. George Stephenson's brother, Robert (1788‚Äì1837), supervised operations as manager and engineer until his death in 1837. In 1832 he was able to report to Fitzgerald that the four foot seam had been reached. The original shaft was sunk to a depth of around 650 feet and in the first six months of 1832 the colliery produced nearly 27,000 tons of coal. The shaft was closed after flooding in 1834. In 1835, Fitzgerald formed the Pendleton Colliery Company, with George Stephenson as a director, and leased nearby land from the Duchy of Lancaster for new mining works. In 1836, the colliery supplied at least 215,000 tons of coal to Manchester by road, 24 per cent of the city's total demand. Robert Stephenson supervised the sinking of two eight-feet diameter shafts to deeper, drier seams below the Worsley Four Foot in 1836‚Äì37 and a steam engine of around 40 horsepower was installed. The new shaft was on the east bank of the canal where a short branch terminated in the pit yard. In 1840 the shaft reached coal at a depth of 1,392 feet. The new workings undertaken by the company were expected to generate profits of ¬£14,000 per annum but the colliery suffered from problems relating to water ingress throughout its existence. By 1840 the coal faces of the Albert and Crombourke mines were 1,400 feet below the surface. More flooding in 1843 caused the pit to close when it employed nearly 1,000 people and produced 1,000 tons of coal per day. The lower sections of the new shafts, which were around 1,590 feet deep, were lined with cast iron tubbing in an attempt to restrain water ingress. A design flaw was being rectified at the time of the flooding, which newspapers attributed to the closure of two nearby collieries that had shut down due to flooding and the absence of their pumping mechanisms had increased the volume of water present. Newspapers reported that Fitzgerald's losses as a result of the ingress ‚Äî which was initially termed a \\"destruction\\" by the Morning Post ‚Äî were at least ¬£50,000. By the end of 1843 a beam engine with a 75-inch stroke had been installed to clear the water. The colliery was still closed in June 1846, by which time more than 157 million gallons of water had been pumped out and the coal lay 100 yards below the water level. Mining operations recommenced in January 1847 and were marked with a celebratory procession through the streets of Manchester and Salford but the disaster had ruined some of the company's directors and in 1848 Fitzgerald filed for bankruptcy. His son noted in 1843 that Jack Nadin says that the colliery was closed in 1848 but D. R. Fisher says Fitzgerald continued mining somewhere and there are numerous newspaper advertisements after 1848 that list the address of Fitzgerald's agent, Hugh Higson, as being that of the colliery. Under the provisions of bankruptcy, the lease was offered for sale in 1852, which was the year that Fitzgerald died. The lease covered approximately 280 acres of land, the associated mineral rights and plant and machinery. At that time, the seams being worked were the Albert mine, the Binn mine, the New Six Foot and the Seven Foot.  Andrew Knowles and Sons  Andrew Knowles and Sons bought the underlease in 1852. The company developed the colliery by sinking new shafts on the east side of the canal in 1857 to access the Rams mine at 1,545 feet and the shafts on the west side of the canal were abandoned. As the coal was worked from coal seams that dipped at 1-in-3, Pendleton became the deepest coal mine in the country when the workings reached 3,600 feet where the temperature at the coal face reached 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Andrew Knowles and Sons relined the upcast shaft in 1872 reducing its diameter to 7 feet 2 inches, giving Pendleton the record for the narrowest shaft. In 1891 the company decided to modernise the colliery by sinking two 16 feet-diameter shafts but water from old workings broke through causing flooding and subsidence and the shafts were abandoned. A screening plant and wagon loading facility were built on the canal's west bank alongside the Manchester and Bolton Railway line linked to the pit by a bridge built in 1894. A small engine shed and sidings were built to connect with the railway by January 1895. A saddletank locomotive supplied by Manning Wardle in 1901 was named Knowles. In 1896 Pendleton Nos. 1 & 2 pits employed 441 underground and 126 surface workers and in 1933 employed 272 underground and 117 on the surface. Ground upheaval in the Rams mine caused five deaths in 1925. The colliery became part of Manchester Collieries in 1929 by which time the Albert and Crombouke mines were exhausted. The new owners fitted new headgear to No. 1 shaft in 1931. The colliery closed in 1939 when coal in the Rams mine was exhausted. The colliery site was subsequently used by the Manchester Oxide Company to process spent iron oxide.

As an advertising photographer, he has worked for Japan Tobacco International, Lexar Microsystems, Inc., Lexar and Leica Camera AG. Much of his personal work is 'street,' though not classical street photography in that he places emphasis on the imagined and the surreal. Whether it is a series of images in which strangers on the subway gradually emerge as though spies, or individual images in which found scenes take on allegorical overtones as a result of the manner in which their elements are juxtaposed. Whether subtly mocking a classical painting or using strongly symbolic elements, Shanidze invites the viewer to subvert their own views of the real in the process of decoding the surreal. –ò–ê REGNUM –ñ—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª –§–æ—Ç–æ–¥–µ–ª–æ –í–æ—Å—Ç–æ–∫ –ú–µ–¥–∏–∞ Signature Magazine (Page 14-15) Shanidze has exhibited his work in personal and group shows in the USA, Canada and Russia.

It is named for the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who stayed there the last six weeks of his life. He died there in 1778 and was buried in an island in the park. The western part, called \\"le D√©sert\\" is managed by the Institut de France, and the northern part by a hotel/restaurant at the Ch√¢teau d'Ermenonville. The other parts are not open to the public, for various reasons. History The park at Ermenonville was created by Ren√© de Girardin (1735‚Äì1808). Girardin was an officer under Stanislas Leszczy≈Ñski, and fought in the Seven Years' War. Girardin acquired a substantial inheritance from his mother Ren√© Hatte in 1762, enabling him to create his park and gardens at Ermenonville. Girardin brought in two hundred English workers to create his garden. It was inspired by Jean-Jacques Rousseau's philosophy, in his 1761 work, Julie, or the New Heloise, drawing from the works of the English writers Joseph Addison, Alexander Pope and Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 3rd Earl of Shaftesbury,p. 62 all three of whom had written on English gardens. Girardin laid out the garden based on ideas expressed in an essay entitled De la composition des paysages sur le terrain ou des moyens d'embellir la nature pr√®s des habitations en y joignant l'agr√©able √† l'utile (\\"On the creation of landscapes, or means of embellishing nature near inhabited places in merging the agreeable and the useful\\").

Vers 1860. In the 1770s Rousseau and Girardin met up in Paris. In the spring of 1778, his friend Th√©r√®se Levasseur fell into bad health, and her doctor advised her to have a rest in the countryside. The two then tried to find a new place to live.p. 59 Girardin, one of Rousseau's many admirers, invited them to stay at a cottage in his garden, and they did from May 1778.p. 16 There, Rousseau recovered his extroadinary enthusiasm for nature. As he said to his friend Girardin: \\"For a long time, my heart drew me here, and what my eyes see, make me want to stay here always\\". On 4 July 1778, Rousseau was buried at midnight, by torchlight, on a little island in the park which now bears his name. His remains were ceremonially relocated to the Panth√©on national heroes repository in Paris in 1794. On 26 December 1787, a violent storm devastated parts of the park, which were only partly repaired.Cf. sur le site . Reception The park was considered one of the foremost English-style parks on the Continent, remarkable \\"for the landscapes it offered to visitors and the reflections it inspired in the course of a ramble\\".p. 59 It was visited in its early years by several prominent people, including Emperor Joseph II of Austria in 1777, Queen Marie-Antoinette in spring 1780, King Gustave III of Sweden in 1783 and First Consul Napol√©on Bonaparte, several times beginning in 1800.,Cf.

Operating under the assumption that human activity and experience are filled with \\"meaning\\" and stories, rather than logical arguments or lawful formulations, narrative psychology is the study of how human beings construct stories to deal with experiences. Definition The word narrative is used with a broad range of meanings. It is a method of articulating life experiences in a meaningful way. Narrative psychology is not a single or well- defined theory. It refers to a range of approaches to examining the role of stories in human life and thought. In narrative psychology, a person's life story becomes a form of identity as how they choose to reflect on, integrate and tell the facts and events of their life not only reflects, but also shapes, who they are. It is a social constructivist approach that studies the implications of these stories for individuals and societies. History Psychologists became interested in stories and everyday accounts of life in the 1970s. The term narrative psychology was introduced by Theodore R. Sarbin in his 1986 book Narrative Psychology: The storied nature of human conduct in which he claimed that human conduct is best explained through stories and that this explanation should be done through qualitative research. Sarbin argued that \\"narrative\\" is a root metaphor for psychology that should replace the mechanistic and organic metaphors which shaped so much theory and research in the discipline over the past century. Jerome Bruner explored the \\"narrative kind of knowing\\" in a more empirical way in his 1986 book Actual Minds, Possible Worlds. Bruner makes a distinction between \\"paradigmatic\\" and \\"narrative\\" forms of thought, proposing that they are both fundamental but irreducible to one another. The narrative approach was also furthered by Dan P. McAdams, who put forward a life story model of identity to describe three levels of personality, leading to explorations of how significant life transitions are narrated and how the \\"self and culture come together in narrative\\". Narrative psychological approaches have become influential in research into the self and identity, as analysing life stories can explore the \\"unity and coherence\\" of the self. More recently, narrative psychology has sought to use quantitative research to study communication and identity, studying narratives to obtain empirical data about human social cognition and adaptation. Practice Narrative psychologists use interviews to provide an opportunity for a person to give a detailed account of their life or particular events. Narratives can then be transcribed and analyzed in order to describe and interpret them. Examples According to Brown and Taylor (1997), African-American slaves have made contributions to narrative psychology by participating in the Federal Writers' Project that was conducted from 1937 to 1938. Nearly three hundred field workers participated in the process of interviewing 2000 slaves across seventeen states to construct narratives from the former slaves' accounts of their lives as slaves and during the period after the Civil War. One of the best interviewers was said to be folklorist Ruby Pickens Tartt, who worked principally in rural Sumter County in Alabama. She recorded exactly what the slaves would say in their interviews, and she went on to write folk tales based on their tales.

They are now to a large extent drained away, but are still the haunt of snipe, goose, duck, and swan.Smith, Page 60 The Water of Fail near Fail Castle Cottage =Fail Mill= The Duke of Portland abolished thirlage in mid-19th century, making Millburn Mill, and its head of water, Lochlea, redundantArch Hist Coll, Page 87 resulting in active attempts at drainage at both Fail and Lochlea causing their effective demise circa 1840. Much of the loch lands of Fail Loch became part of the fields of the surrounding farms and properties, such as Mosside, Lilylaw, Adamhill, and Boghead, however a portion remained prone to seasonal flooding. The waters of the Townend and Mill Burns still contribute to the flow towards the old Fail Mill that stood on the rivulet, known from this point on, as the Water of Fail and survived into the 20th century. Much of the surrounding lands in the area, originally belonged to the monks from Fail Monastery.Paterson, V.II. Page 751 The old Monk's Road forms a boundary on the east side of the old loch. William Muir was the tenant of the Mill of Fail at the time of Robert Burns.The Book of Robert Burns. Accessed : 2010-07-02 The OS maps show the presence of a dam and mill pond which would have negated the need for the existence of the loch as a head of water for the mill.

The chancel and transepts, which are the oldest features of the present building, date from the late 15th century, but there has been a church on the site since the 6th or early 7th century, making it one of the oldest Christian sites in Anglesey. Some restoration and enlargement took place during the 19th century. The church is associated with the 1859 wreck of the Royal Charter off Anglesey; it was used as a temporary mortuary, and 140 of the victims are buried in the churchyard. Charles Dickens, who wrote about the loss of the ship, noted the care taken by the rector, Stephen Roose Hughes, for the victims and their families. Hughes died a few years later following the strain of the events and is also buried in the churchyard. The church is still used for worship by the Church in Wales, as one of four churches in a combined parish. There is a regular pattern of services in English and in Welsh. St Gallgo's is a Grade II listed building, a national designation given to \\"buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them\\", as a \\"rural church with strong Perpendicular character\\", retaining some features from the late 15th century. (Cadw has misspelt the church's name.) The church contains a late 13th-century bell, with an impression of a coin of King Edward I, some memorials from the 17th to 19th centuries, and some church furniture from the early 20th century in an Arts and Craft style. History and location St Gallgo's Church stands to the southwest of the village of Llanallgo, near the eastern coast of Anglesey, north Wales. It is about from Llangefni, the county town. According to the 19th-century writer Samuel Lewis, St Gallgo established the first church here in the early 7th century; Angharad Llwyd, a 19th-century historian of Anglesey, gives the foundation year as 605. Another writer, Geraint Jones, puts it earlier, and says in his 2006 guide to the churches of Anglesey that Gallgo established the church in the early 6th century; Jones says that it is \\"one of the oldest Christian sites in Anglesey.\\" Gallgo was one of the sons of St Caw, a king from northern Britain, and a brother of St Gildas and St Eugrad (the latter establishing the nearby church of St Eugrad's in about 605 as well. Llwyd also recorded that there was a well near the church named after Gallgo, and said that \\"miraculous cures\\" had been ascribed to the waters, which were \\"strongly impregnated with sulphate of lime\\". The village takes its name from the church; the Welsh word originally meant \\"enclosure\\" and then \\"church\\", and \\"-allgo\\" is a modified form of the saint's name. The presence of a church here was recorded in the Norwich Taxation of 1254, but the oldest parts of the structure of the present building (the chancel and transepts) date from the late 15th century. It was formerly used as a chapel of ease for St Eugrad's Church. Repair work was carried out in 1831, which included adding a west window, and extensive restoration in 1892 (under Henry Kennedy, the architect of the Diocese of Bangor) included rebuilding the west walls of the transepts and lengthening the nave. In 1934, the sanctuary was restored in memory of a former rector, Stephen Roose Hughes. The vestry was badly damaged by fire in 2004, but has since been repaired. Black and white print on lithograph c. 1860. The memorial to victims of the wreck of the Royal Charter The churchyard contains 140 victims of the sinking of the Royal Charter off Anglesey in October 1859, and an obelisk commemorates the loss. Over 440 passengers and crew died. Stephen Roose Hughes was the rector at the time of the accident. St Gallgo's was used as a temporary mortuary as bodies were recovered from the sea. Hughes and his brother Hugh, who was rector of an adjoining parish, conducted many of the funeral services. Hughes wrote over 1,000 letters to people enquiring for news of relatives and friends, and comforted many who visited Anglesey. Charles Dickens stayed with Hughes when he visited Anglesey to write about the sinking; his experiences were published in The Uncommercial Traveller. He recorded the care that Hughes took to try and identify victims from their possessions and physical characteristics. Hughes died three years later; the strain of the events was noted on his gravestone in the churchyard as one of the reasons for his early death. He is remembered in St Gallgo's on the anniversary of his death, 4 February. The churchyard also contains two Commonwealth war graves, of a Royal Engineers soldier of World War I and a Merchant Navy sailor of World War II. CWGC Cemetery report, details from casualty record. The poet Dafydd Trefor is recorded in a list of clergy for the Bangor diocese of 1504 as being rector of St Gallgo's and St Eugrad's, and signed himself as such in a deed of 1524; he was buried in the churchyard. The poet and historian John Williams (better known by his bardic name \\"Glanmor\\") was rector of the two churches from 1883 until his death in 1891; he too is buried at Llanallgo. St Gallgo's is still used for worship by the Church in Wales. It is one of four churches in the combined benefice of Llaneugrad and Llanallgo with Penrhosllugwy with Llanfihangel Tre'r Beirdd. It is within the deanery of Twrcelyn, the archdeaconry of Bangor and the Diocese of Bangor. As of 2012, the position of rector is vacant. The pattern of services in 2012 is for two services every Sunday morning, alternating between a communion service and morning prayer, in English at 8.30am and in Welsh at 10am. There is also a twice-monthly evening service (in English), and a midweek communion service in the church hall in Moelfre. Services are led by retired clergy and lay readers. Architecture and fittings The interior, looking towards the east end The church is built in the Perpendicular style from rubble masonry; the roof is made of slate with a stone bellcote at the west end and stone cross finials. The church is built in a cross shape, with transepts to the north and south of the chancel. Entrance is through a porch on the north side of the nave, where the doorway has been built reusing older stones. The interior walls of the nave and transepts are lined with painted bricks. The supporting timber braces of the nave roof can be seen from inside the church; the roof trusses in the chancel and transepts are covered by barrel-shaped boarded ceilings. The chancel floor is made from local limestone. The east window of the chancel dates from the 15th century, although the tracery is more recent. It has stained glass portraying Christ walking on the water giving a blessing and the word \\"It is I, be not afraid\\". The east windows in both the north and south transepts are each topped with a cinquefoil. The nave windows date from the late 19th century. The bell is one of the oldest in the diocese, dating from the late 13th century. It bears the imprint of a penny from the reign of King Edward I (reigned 1272‚Äì1307) and the Latin inscription (\\"Hail Mary full of grace\\"). Restoration of the bell in 2000 cost ¬£3,000. The reredos, altar, communion rail, pulpit and reading desk (all from the early 20th century) are made from limed oak in an Arts and Crafts style, with floral decorations. The north transept has a stone memorial on the north wall to a former rector, Lewis Owen, and his grandson, who both died in 1771. The font is modern. A 1937 survey by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire noted a 1726 communion table and a number of memorials from the 17th, 18th and early 19th centuries. The chancel measures 12 by 12 feet 6 inches (3.65 by 3.8m); the north transept is 17 by 14 feet 6 inches (5.2 by 4.4m); the south transept is slightly smaller, at 17 by 14 feet (5.2 by 4.25m); and the nave after its 1892 extension is now twice as long as the chancel, at . Assessment The church has national recognition and statutory protection from alteration as it has been designated as a Grade II listed building ‚Äì the lowest of the three grades of listing, designating \\"buildings of special interest, which warrant every effort being made to preserve them\\". It was given this status on 12 May 1970, and has been listed as \\"a rural church with strong Perpendicular character\\". Cadw (the Welsh Assembly Government body responsible for the built heritage of Wales and the inclusion of Welsh buildings on the statutory lists) also notes that it retains some features from the late 15th century. Angharad Llwyd, writing shortly after the 1831 restoration, described the church as \\"a small and handsome structure\\", and she recorded the presence of some \\"ancient\\" stained glass in the east window. Writing in 1859, the clergyman and antiquarian Harry Longueville Jones said that the church, although small, was one of the \\"better kind\\" in Anglesey. He thought that the walls had been lowered after being built, because the top of the east window was too close to the roof, which in his view could not have been the original intention. At the time he wrote there were the remains of a screen between the nave and the chancel, but it is no longer present. Overall, he commented, \\"the workmanship of this church is more careful than usual, and shows that it was erected by some person of munificent disposition\\". The Welsh politician and church historian Sir Stephen Glynne visited the church in 1868, and noted that the church had been altered less than most of the other churches in Anglesey. He thought that the west window was \\"modern and bad\\", but that the east window of the chancel was \\"very good\\". He added that the church needed repair, as the interior was \\"very rough\\".

The village covers approximately 0.5 km2, located between J√¶gersborg Dyrehave and √òresund in the Lyngby-Taarb√¶k Municipality. The population is estimated to 1700 residents. Traditionally, Taarb√¶k was a fishing village but, nowadays, the village is inhabited by people from the middle or upper class. Taarb√¶k is named after a former village called Torsb√¶k, which was located just north of where Taarb√¶k is today. Despite its small size, Taarb√¶k has its own school, church, port, tennis club, water skiing club and football club. The water skiing club is among the best in Denmark. The football club Taarb√¶k IF, is one of the oldest football clubs in Denmark, founded on August 23, 1908. The giant container ship Emma M√¶rsk is home-ported in Taarb√¶k. History The beach where Taarb√¶k Harbour was later built Taarb√¶k was established as a fishing village in the 17th century. It was originally called Thorsb√¶k, meaning Thor's Stream, a reference to a local stream. The village had no harbor, the fishing boats were pulled up on the beach. Most of the fish were sold on the fish market at Gammel Strand in Copenhagen. The village belonged to the parish of Kongens Lyngby. An inn opened in about 1800. On 22 May 1730, it received a royal license to brew its own beer and make its own aquavit. The innkeeper had to pay his tax to the king in cod. Klampenborg Spa viewed on a lithography from 1888 In 1821, local residents started working for Taarb√¶k to get its own school and church room. The school opened in a building which was donated to the project by the two English owners. It was the first spa resort of its kind top open in Denmark. Marienlyst Spa (Marienlyst Kur- og S√∏badeanstalt) opened in Helsing√∏r in 1853. Taarb√¶k became a spa town when Klampenborg Vandkuur-, Br√∏nd- og S√∏badeanstalt opened in 1848. The section for women was located at Taarb√¶k while the section for men was located a little further to the south in Klampenborg. The number of summer visitors grew steadily. Some stayed with the local fishermen while other built their own country houses. In 1867 Taarb√¶k Bymur was established, in order to keep out unwanted guests. The wall was 4 meters tall and 2173 meters long, closing of the entirety of Taarb√¶k to the outside world. The only way in or out was via the harbor, which only a small portion of citizens used. This coursed a lot of inbreeding among the citizens, and let to mass retardation, which can still be felt today. The wall was finally torn down in 1926, after massive pressure from the state. View of Taarb√¶k from J√¶gersborg Dyrehave in 1879 In the 1860s, Taarb√¶k began to change even faster. A key event was the opening of the Klampenborg Railway in 1863. The area to the south of the village was built over with summer residences. In 1864, the town finally got its own church. Taarb√¶k Harbour, with room for 70 small boats, was built in 1865. Taarb√¶k Harbour with the now demolished hotel building (centre) and inn (right) The area to the north of the village, Ny Taarb√¶k (\\"New Taarb√¶k\\"), developed in the 1880s. Connections to Copenhagen improved even more with the opening of the Coast Line in 1884 even if trevallers to and from Taarb√¶k still had to use Klampenborg station. A hotel was built in the 1890s. In 1909, the civil parisk of Lyngby was renamed Lyngby-Taarb√¶k in recognition of the growing importance of the new coastal district. A new school was built in 1916. The hotel was demolished in 1936 and the inn was demolished in 1940 as Taarb√¶k changed from a quiet resort town to a modern suburb. Landmarks Taarb√¶k Church Taarb√¶k Church is from 1864. It was designed by the architect C.E. Wessel. Taarb√¶k Cemetery was established in 1905. Only three of the buildings from Klampenborg Spa have survived. Part of its side has been turned into a small park, Cottageparken, which contains two of the buildings. The Yellow Cottage (Den Gule Cottage) is a former gatehouse. The Red Cottage (Den R√∏de Cottage) now houses a one Michelin star restaurant. The third surviving building, a two-story, wooden building, is located at T√•rb√¶k Strandvej 82.

It was converted into an indoor sporting arena in 1949 and was renamed Zimniy Stadion (, lit. \\"Winter Stadium\\").  Name  Similar to the neighboring Mikhailovsky Castle the name \\"Mikhailovsky\\" comes from the Archangel Michael, a heavenly patron of the House of Romanov, the ruling dynasty of the Russian Empire in 1613‚Äì1917. \\"Man√®ge\\" is French for \\"riding academy\\", since the area was originally used as a dressage area for horses of the imperial cavalry. The square in which the monument sits is called Manezhnaya Square ().  History  The history of Manezhnaya Square and the Mikhailovsky Man√®ge dates to the 1730s, when a Persian shah, Nader, who signed a treaty with the Russian Empire in Ganja in March 1735, sent an elephant as a gift to the Russian empress, Anna of Russia, the niece of Peter the Great. To keep that gift alive, an \\"elephant yard\\"actually, the first zoowas built on what is today Manezhnaya Square. Very soon, a \\"beast yard\\" () for other animals was put nearby, along with a greenhouse to grow plants to feed them. However, the elephant could not bear loneliness and the heavy northern climate of Petersburg. So in 1741, the Persian shah sent a caravan of 14 elephants. A house for them was built where the Man√®ge is now located. From this \\"stable\\", elephants were regularly taken for walks across the current Manezhnaya Square. In 1742, the new empress, Elizabeth of Russia, began construction of a new Summer Palace for herself nearby. The zoo was moved away, and on the place of the stables a labyrinth garden was built with interlocking lanes and clipped shrubs. The wooden Summer Palace stood for half a century until the reign of Paul I of Russia, when it was dismantled, freeing up space for the stables and man√®ge. Architecture The Mikhailovsky Man√®ge is an elegant, spare structure faced in stucco of cream-yellow and white. It was built in 1798-1800 by Vincenzo Brenna, an Italian architect and painter who was the court architect of Paul I. Brenna is considered a precursor of romantic neoclassicism, when some elements of the late baroque are combined with romanticism and classicism. A quarter of a century later, tastes changed, and in 1823-1824 architect Carlo Rossi renovated the facades in classic style upon his joint project with two Russian sculptors, Vasily Demuth-Malinovsky and Stepan Pimenov. The facade of the building, which faces the square with its five doorways, and the attic, were decorated with bas-reliefs of military armor and bas-relief shields with swords and oak branches. This design reflects the use of the Man√®ge by the War Ministry as a dressage spot for the horses of imperial cavalry. For the same reason, the building was sometimes called by a Russian name of German origin, \\"—ç–∫–∑–µ—Ä—Ü–∏—Ä–≥–∞—É–∑\\" (, lit. \\"house for exercises\\").  Exhibition area  Grand Duke Boris Vladimirovich. In the years of economic expansion following the Emancipation reform of 1861, the Mikhailovsky Man√®ge became one of the city spots for agricultural and industrial exhibitions. The Imperial Gardeners' Society was among the most regular tenants of this hall. In 1893, the First All-Russian Hygiene Exhibition took place here; in 1909, the International Exhibition of the Latest Innovations, at which the All-Russian Aero Club formed the core of the national exhibition stand. In 1902, the Imperial Russian Automobile Society was created. In 1907 it leased the Man√®ge for the international All-Russian Automobile Exposition for the first time. The second exhibition took place in 1908 in Moscow. In 1910, exhibitors returned to Petersburg, where on the III International Automobile Exposition was opened, again in Mikhailovsky Man√®ge. The following day, on , the international rally \\"Petersburg‚ÄîKiev\\" for the prize of Nicholas II started. Forty-eight cars set out from Mikhailovsky Man√®ge for the starting line of this rally at Tsarskoye Selo. Russia was represented with national brand Russo-Balt; among the other participating brands were Adler, Mercedes, Delaunay-Belleville, Mors (France), Benz & Cie., Itala, and many others. Atomexpo was held there in June 2013.\\"International Industry Forum ATOMEXPO.\\"\\"Russia invites Iran to nuclear power forum.\\"  Political events  The October Manifesto issued on , allowing the formation of political parties in Russia, brought the demand for facilities for public gatherings. In harsh climatic conditions (long winters, flanked on both sides with the long months of bad weather, slush and mud), the need for indoor facilities was especially urgent. Mikhailovsky Man√®ge, located about north from Nevsky Prospekt,Google maps link to Manezhnaya square. was selected. The Union of the Russian People (URP), a close-to-extremist nationalistic movement formed with substantial overt and covert support from the Russian authorities, was among the first to use this government-owned building for their political gathering. Nine days after the Manifest was proclaimed, on , the URP announced its founding; and in less than a fortnight, on the crowd of about 2000 people gathered under the roof of Mikhailovsky Man√®ge. Orchestral music was playing, the church choir sang Praise God and Tzar Divine, and the leaders of URP addressed the mob from a rostrum erected in the centre of the arena. In 1913, when the 300th anniversary of the House of Romanovs was celebrated throughout Russia, Mikhailovsky Man√®ge was the site for different public venues associated with this occasion, which included several exhibitions. Memorial plaque commemorating the two speeches delivered by Vladimir Lenin in Mikhailovsky Man√®ge. The most turbulent time in the political life of Petersburg (renamed Petrograd between 1914 and 1924) came after the abdication of Nicholas II in March 1917. Rarely did a day between the February Revolution and the October revolution pass without rallies and meetings, both spontaneous and organized, taking place all over the city. The left-wing political forces intensified their activities in Petrograd in April, when Vladimir Lenin and the other leaders of the Bolshevik section of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party returned to democratic Russia from emigration. On Lenin came to the rally at Mikhailovsky Man√®ge and delivered a speech to the soldiers of the Armored Car division. The second and last time that Lenin spoke at the Man√®ge was on , when he addressed the regiment of soldiers about to set out to the Western Front. A plaque of white marble, mounted on the wall of Man√®ge, commemorates these two events in the political history of the city and country. That speech of Lenin on the first day of 1918 at Mikhailovsky Man√®ge marked a turn in the policy of the new Soviet government regarding war and peace. The slogan \\"Peace to the people\\", under which the October Revolution gained mass support, lost its relevance due to the resumption of German attacks on Russia, so Lenin had to explain to the soldiers why they should resume fighting. A special guest at this rally was Albert Rhys Williams from the United States. As soon as Lenin stepped down from the top of an armored car from which he spoke, Nikolai Podvoisky, a Soviet defence minister and the organizer of the event, gave the floor to an American speaker. Shortly after this rally, the first attempt was made on Lenin's life. As his car drove away from Mikhailovsky Man√®ge, a group of terrorists among them the best sharpshooters in the Russian Armywho were hiding in ambush in the next lane began shooting, shattering the windshield.

Plot MacKintosh (no first name is ever given) is an aging migrant cowboy drifting from ranch to ranch doing odd jobs along the way with the exception of his World War II service in the Pacific. When passing through a town he sees T.J. (no other name is ever given) a 14-year-old recently released from doing clean up work for vagrancy. Shopping for supplies, MacKintosh sights T.J. preparing to steal an apple being watched by the store owner. MacKintosh pretends the boy is with him and pays for their supplies. Giving T.J. a ride the two realise they have much in common. Having left his single mother and not having been in school since Dick and Jane books were used (early primary school), T.J. is off to work his way to the Pacific Ocean that he has never seen. When MacKintosh's vehicle breaks down T.J. catches a lift with a well dressed stranger on his way to El Paso as MacKintosh makes his repairs. Stopping for dinner in a bar that night, MacKintosh sights T.J. working as a busboy in the bar. T.J. explains that the man who picked him up was \\"funny\\" that made T.J. leave him as quickly as possible. A drunken loud cowboy named Cal misplaces his money and accuses T.J. of stealing. When Cal strikes T.J., MacKintosh knocks him down. Cal comes after MacKintosh with a knife with MacKintosh knocking him down again by breaking a catsup bottle on his head. Losing his job, T.J. and MacKintosh team up again. The pair find work at the 6666 Ranch run by Jim Webster where MacKintosh impresses everyone when he breaks horses, works as a ranch hand and gains more money by obtaining cash bounties for coyotes he shoots. T.J. is put to work cleaning up abandoned buildings. The two settle in until accusations are made against MacKintosh for his being too friendly to the wife of his foreman.

A passenger service between Llantrisant, Tonyrefail and Penygraig was introduced on 1 May 1901, operated by the Great Western Railway (GWR). After the EVR had been absorbed by the GWR, an additional halt was opened at Coed Ely on 13 July 1925; it was situated between Llantrisant and Tonyrefail. The station had two platforms, each 300 feet in length. It had a building on the 'up' platform only. This was constructed from timber and asbestos. It contained waiting rooms and conveniences. The booking office was situated beside the approach footpath from the main road, at the northerly end of the 'up' platform. The 'down' platform was without any form of shelter. The station had no footbridge, passengers having to cross the line by means of a sleeper level crossing.

She is the first of her breed to have won the title.  Biography  GCH Foxcliffe Hickory Wind was named after a song written by Gram Parsons and Bob Buchanan.Hickory Wind She is owned by Sally Sweatt, along with her breeder, Cecilia Dove, and her husband Scott. During 2010, she was ranked fifth out of all American dogs in the Hound Group. Following her victory at Westminster, she will retire from show competition. Her owners made plans to breed her in 2011 and move her permanently to her breeder's farm in Flint Hill, Virginia. Speaking of Hickory's retirement, her handler Angela Lloyd said, \\"She's a wonderful dog to live with. I‚Äôm going to miss the nose nudge in the middle of the night.\\" Hickory died, aged 11 years, on June 13, 2017.  Westminster  Being handled by Angela Lloyd, who won the junior competition in 1998, she was entered in the 135th Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show in 2011. In her breed judging, she was judged the best of three entrants who had qualified for Westminster, moving onto the Hound Group, the other two entrants being GCH Thistleglen Rowan and Ch. Altnamara's Trial By Fire. She placed first in the Hound Group, beating the Beagle GCH Torquay Midnight Confession into second place, and the Norwegian Elkhound GCH Vin- Melca's Voyager into third. She won the title of Best in Show in what was described by the Los Angeles Times as \\"surprising many\\", beating four dogs which were ranked in the top ten of all breeds in 2010: the Pekingese GCH Palacegarden Malachy, the Cocker Spaniel GCH Casablanca's Thrilling Seduction, the Bearded Collie GCH Tolkien Raintree Mister Baggins, and the Smooth Fox Terrier GCH Slyfox Sneak's A Peek. Her odds prior to winning Best in Show were placed at 60‚Äì1. However, these were not the longest odds of a recent Best in Show winner; in 2009, a Sussex Spaniel named Ch. Clussexx Three D Grinchy Glee came out of retirement to win at odds of 275‚Äì1. Paolo Dondina, the Best in Show judge and first Italian to judge the prize, said of Hickory, \\"This one feels perfectly the standard in all the ways, I am a hound person. I had Afghans, I had whippets, I had Irish wolfhounds. I never owned a deerhound. This is my dream.\\" During the press conference following the victory, Hickory grew tired and restless of the photographers, and at one point walked off the stage. As Best in Show, she appeared on The Today Show and The Martha Stewart Show.

He is a member of the Liberal Party of Australia and is also currently the state president of the party's New South Wales division. He is also the Vice Chair of the Global Panel Foundation Australasia‚Äîwith Sir Donald Charles McKinnon as Chair. Ruddock was previously a Liberal member of the House of Representatives from 1973 to 2016. First elected in a 1973 by-election, by the time of his retirement he was the last parliamentary survivor of the Whitlam and Fraser Governments. He was both the Father of the House and the Father of the Parliament from 1998 to his retirement. He is the second longest-serving parliamentarian in the history of the Australian Parliament (only Billy Hughes served longer). Ruddock served continuously in federal cabinet during the Howard Government, as Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs from 1996 to 2003, and then Attorney-General from 2003 to 2007. Early life and education Philip Ruddock is the son of Emmie (n√©e Chappell) and Maxwell \\"Max\\" Ruddock. He was born in Canberra, where his father was at the time the Deputy Prices Commissioner working for the Commonwealth Government; he was later a Liberal member of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly from 1962 to 1976. He was educated at Barker College in the Sydney suburb of Hornsby before entering University of Sydney, after which he practised as a solicitor. He was articled to the firm Berne, Murray and Tout and was promoted to partner. Political career =Early career; Member of Parliament and First term in Government 1973‚Äì1996= On 22 September 1973, Ruddock was elected to the House of Representatives at a by-election for the seat of Parramatta. He narrowly held it at the 1974 general election, but was returned with a large swing in 1975. A redistribution ahead of the 1977 election, however, split Parramatta almost in half. The western half retained the Parramatta name and became a marginal Labor seat anchored in heavily pro-Labor west Sydney. The eastern half, including most of the old Parramatta's Liberal-friendly areas, became the comfortably safe Liberal seat of Dundas. Ruddock transferred to Dundas, and held it without serious difficulty until its abolition in 1993. Ruddock then transferred to the equally safe seat of Berowra, a seat he held for the remainder of his federal political career.  Shadow Minister (1983‚Äì1996) Ruddock was a member of the Opposition Shadow Ministry from 1983 to 1985 and from 1989 to 1996. In the 1980s and early 1990s, he was an active member of the parliamentary group of Amnesty International. In 2000, Ruddock was disavowed by Amnesty International due to the treatment of refugees by the Howard Government and asked not to wear his Amnesty International badge while performing ministerial duties. In August 1988, while Ruddock was still a backbencher, the Leader of the Opposition, John Howard, commented that he believed the rate of Asian immigration was too high. The Hawke Labor government sought to embarrass Howard and introduced a bill to Parliament to ensure that immigration did not discriminate on the basis of race. Ruddock along with fellow Liberals Steele Hall and Ian Macphee crossed the floor to support the Labor motion. In 1989, following Andrew Peacock's ascension to the leadership, Ruddock became Shadow Minister for Immigration and proposed a settlement scheme for Australia's far north. =Cabinet Minister, Second term in Government (1996‚Äì2007)= Minister for Immigration Following the Coalition's rise to government at the 1996 election, Ruddock was appointed to the Cabinet as Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. In this role, he administered the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and presided over the Howard government's policies on asylum seekers. During his time in office, the previous Keating Labor Government's practice of mandatory detention of asylum seekers was continued and extended. In October 1999, the Australian government introduced Temporary Protection Visas for persons who applied for refugee status after making an unauthorised arrival in Australia, and was the main type of visa issued to refugees when released from Australian immigration detention facilities. Many Afghan and Iraqi refugees who are not Australian citizens were affected by this policy. Minister for Indigenous Affairs In 2001, Ruddock was also appointed to the role of Minister for Indigenous Affairs. By 2001 he had become a high-profile figure enjoying considerable support within the Liberal Party, while being strongly opposed by left-wing activists and some human rights advocates. His \\"Pacific Solution\\" ‚Äì which prevented asylum seekers receiving legal access ‚Äì was condemned by Human Rights Watch as contravening international law, as being a human rights violation: Oxfam and the UNHCR (United Nations refugee agency) agreed with this viewpoint.Streatfield, D. (2011) A History of the World Since 9/11, Chapter 2., pp.70‚Äì73 At one point he was one of the few senior ministers (besides the prime minister) to have needed personal security details. Areas in Ruddock's portfolio and some of his decisions were highly controversial in Australian politics, and led to Amnesty International's public attempt to distance the organisation from him by asking him to remove his lapel badge. In 2003, Ruddock was accused by the Labor immigration spokesperson, Julia Gillard, of personally intervening to give a Filipino with a criminal record, Dante Tan, favourable treatment in exchange for donations to the Liberal Party. Ruddock denied that there was a connection between the donations and his actions, and noted that the donation had been properly declared. In 2004, an Australian Federal Police investigation cleared Ruddock of any wrongdoing, and a Senate inquiry, composed of a majority of Labor members, found that \\"there was no way to determine whether Mr Ruddock was influenced by money to grant visas.\\" Attorney-General In 2003, Ruddock became Attorney- General in a cabinet reshuffle. On 27 May 2004, Ruddock introduced the Marriage Legislation Amendment Bill to prevent any possible court rulings allowing same-sex marriages or civil unions.\\"Marriage Amendment Bill 2004\\". Parliament of Australia. 24 June 2004. Retrieved 26 May 2008. Ruddock also defended a decision to deny a gay veteran's partner a spousal pension, despite their 38-year same-sex relationship. The UN Human Rights Commission found the Australian government in violation of equality and privacy rights under the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights, but Ruddock insisted the government was not bound by the ruling. In May 2006, Ruddock blocked a gay Australian man from marrying in Europe. Ruddock refused to grant a gay man living in the Netherlands a 'Certificate of No Impediment to Marriage' document required by some European countries before marriage, to prove foreigners are in fact single. Under Ruddock's instructions, no such documents were to be released to gay and lesbians individuals intending to marry overseas. In July 2007, he remarked that Australia needs to improve its legislation to deal with pro-terrorist literature and media. \\"People who may be susceptible to carrying out a terrorist act ought not to be instructed in how to do it, how to use household products to produce a bomb, or be encouraged to think about violent jihad and taking their own life\\", he said. In 2007 Ruddock and the New South Wales Right to Life Association complained to the Australian Classification Board about the sale in Australia of The Peaceful Pill Handbook by Philip Nitschke and Fiona Stewart. The book provides information on assisted death and voluntary euthanasia. The complaint resulted in the book's banning from sale in Australia. Nitschke commented that \\"No other country in the world ... has gone down this path - Australia stands alone\\" and that the Ruddock's action represented a \\"significant erosion to the free speech principle and it's extremely disappointing\\". =Opposition, 2007‚Äì2013= Following the Howard government's defeat at the November 2007 election, Ruddock did not seek a shadow cabinet role and returned to the backbench, having spent 18 consecutive years as a minister or opposition frontbencher. He returned to the frontbench as Shadow Cabinet Secretary after Tony Abbott captured the Opposition leadership in December 2009. The Coalition was returned to government in 2013. =Third term in government and retirement, 2013‚Äì2016= Ruddock in Parliament, 2016 Ruddock was named the Chief Government Whip in the House of Representatives in the Abbott Government, which took office on 18 September 2013. Ruddock was replaced as Chief Government Whip by Queensland MP Scott Buchholz on 13 February 2015. On 27 May 2015, Ruddock was appointed to the new office of Special Envoy for Citizenship and Community Engagement. The office was created in the wake of controversial proposals by the government to strip sole Australian nationals of their citizenship. On 8 February 2016, Ruddock announced that he would not contest the next federal election and would be retiring from politics. On the same day, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop announced that Ruddock would be appointed Australia's first special envoy for human rights. Post federal political career Ruddock has served as the Special Envoy for Human Rights since 8 February 2016. During this period he has represented Australia abroad for the promotion and protections of Human Rights. In August 2017, Ruddock announced his candidacy for Mayor of Hornsby Shire and was elected on 9 September 2017. In November 2017, Ruddock accepted an invitation from the Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, to chair a review of religious freedoms in Australia in light of the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey and the introduction into federal parliament a private member's bill to enact the Marriage Amendment (Definition and Religious Freedoms) Act 2017.

It is located approximately southwest of the City of Medicine Hat and east of the Town of Bow Island. The County of Forty Mile No. 8 considers the community to be a hamlet. However, Alberta Municipal Affairs does not recognize it as a hamlet.  History  Winnifred, originally a whistle stop at Mile 31 on the Dunmore Junction, also known as the Turkey Track, was upgraded to a siding in 1885 named after a daughter of J.R. Whitlaw, one of the charter members of the Turkey Track. In 1903 the only buildings were the section house where William Savage lived, a dugout for the section hands, and a small two room building that housed the telegraph office. No more than ten people lived in the surroundings. Four years later in 1907 the Alberta Government opened up the district between Grassy Lake and Winnifred for homesteading. Settlers from Eastern Canada and the mid-western states flooded the area, taking up almost every quarter section of land for miles, unaware of the drought-ridden nature of the region. With lack of water and wood, settlers relied on wells for water and small coal deposits in the area for heating. The first few businesses in Winnifred came in 1908 and the spring of 1909. P.J. Demarce opened a store on the south side of the tracks; William Hickmore imported lumber from Lethbridge for a hotel and eating house; and J.S Fisher, of Whitefish, Montana, opened the Fisher Mercantile. In 1913, most of the businesses expanded and moved across the tracks, where they joined F.W. Brown's Hardware and Quong Chon's combination laundry and caf√©. The Fritz Sick brewery of Lethbridge built an up-to-date hotel. The site of the Union Bank was diagonally across from the Fisher Mercantile building. The boom years for Winnifred were 1915-1916, when heavy rains produced bumper crops. It was too good to be true, as in 1918 the Fisher Mercantile went bankrupt and the first of many homesteaders started moving away. The hotel went the same year and was moved to Brooks. The newspaper The Winnifred Record,The Ghost Towns Journal - Book which started out so bravely to chronicle the development of the community, folded shortly after. The 1920s were harsh years for the remaining settlers, with drought, clouds of grasshoppers and finally hordes of rabbits who ate everything that looked like grain. More settlers packed up and left, and with the help of the government moved to homesteads in central and Northern Alberta. By the mid-1930s, dust storms completed the task and farm after farm was abandoned. It took thirty years for the determined homesteaders to appreciated that without irrigation the land was best suited for ranching. Modernizations completed the process of decline as the consolidation of schools and re-routing Highway 3 drew even more of the population off to larger centres such as Lethbridge and Medicine Hat. The few remaining business such as the Turtle Caf√©, operated by Wing Chong, closed in the early 60s, and Winnifred became a ghost town except for the grain elevators and their operators. Eventually they too ceased to exist and were torn down. Very little of Winnifred's rich history remains, just memories and photos. Today young families are moving back into Winnifred, in a sense repopulating the town once again.Lights on Project UFA Rural From the Roots UpBow Island Commentator - Young Families Moving Into Winnifred  See also  List of communities in Alberta  References   External links  Winnifred map Localities in the County of Forty Mile No. 8 ","title":"Winnifred, Alberta"},{"id":"30897856","text":"A transplant surgeon is a surgeon who performs organ transplants.

Located 20 miles south west of the city of Medicine Hat and one mile north of Highway 3.  History  Like most towns in the surrounding region, Whitla's beginnings started with the opening of homestead land in 1908, but there had been some activity before that. Named after R.J. Whitla, a Winnipeg merchant, who visited the site while it was a mere siding in 1885, squatters and cattle ranchers had taken up land in the vicinity as early as 1884. At that time, Medicine Hat was the trading center, but with the construction of the Turkey Track railway, a sensible community grew up around the village of Seven Persons. Hundreds of settlers from North Dakota poured into the district in 1909, Lured by blatantly false promises from real estate agents, government officials and advertising brochures. They brought their customs with them; they celebrated the Fourth of July, rather than the First; They introduced oxen into the short-grass area.The Ghost Towns Journal (Book) The first merchant to settle at Whitla was Sam Richardson, who moved there in 1909. Before him, the town had consisted merely of a siding, a section house and the inevitable dugout for the track workers. Richardson built a store with lumbar shipped in from Medicine Hat, and behind it a one-roomed shack for his family. That following year, Alex and Chris Ashton opened another general store - this time on the north side of the tracks - and their firm was quickly followed by a hardware, a lumbar yard and a farm machinery firm. Though the Aston store burned in January, 1916, the town continued to grow rapidly, with a Union Bank, two cafes, a billiard hall and three garages. The settlers and residents of Whitla rared no better or worse than their neighbors at Winnifred. By 1924, the Alberta Government had a standing offer to relocate any homesteader who wished to leave. Many accepted the assistance. In 1927-28 (twelve years after the first bumper crops) there were two magnificent harvests and Whitla boomed. However, for the next twelve years there was only misery. The Dirty Thirties Brought dry years, crop failures, grasshoppers hordes of voracious rabbits and dust storms. In Tribute to Whitla Pioneers,Tribute to Whitla Pioneers (History Book) Carl Larson recalls a dust storm so severe that people could see grasshoppers digging holes four feet above ground. A gradual exodus beginning as early as 1920, it was sped up during the 1930s and early 40s. By the end of World War II, the small homesteads had virtually vanished, giving way to huge farms and ranches. The paving and relocation of Highway 3 in 1949, as in other areas where modern highways bypass towns, was the final blow to the economy of the village. The mid-1950s brought promise of improvement, first with the introduction of electricity in 1955 and the beginning of irrigation from the St. Mary River Project in the following year. The local dam, located north of Whitla, was appropriately named Rattlesnake Dam. Unfortunately, irrigation had arrived 40 years too late. The 1960s saw the gradual disintegration of Whitla and the closing of the school in 1964 was the last signal of defeat. For a short time after the towns grain elevators remained in operation until their destruction in the mid 1990s.

Founded in 1956 by the previous Klausenburger Rebbe, Rabbi Yekusiel Yehudah Halberstam, who established his court here in 1960, Kiryat Sanz is the world center for Sanz-Klausenburg Hasidism. The Rebbe's son and successor, Rabbi Zvi Elimelech Halberstam, known as the Sanzer Rebbe, holds his court here. History In the 1950s, as the nascent State of Israel began building its population, the Klausenburger Rebbe  who had emigrated to the United States in 1947 after surviving The Holocaust and living in displaced persons camps  applied to the Israeli government for land on which to build a Hasidic settlement for Holocaust survivors. The Rebbe's goals in founding Kiryat Sanz were to restore the former glory of Sanz Hasidism that had been wiped out by the Holocaust, and to establish a model of Torah living which would illuminate the surrounding secular environs.Lifschitz, Rebuilding, p. 159. Many Torah leaders counseled the Rebbe as to where he should establish his new community  some suggested the outskirts of Safed, others Beer Sheva, and still others Jerusalem. The Rebbe set up his own action committee, which recommended two sites on the Mediterranean coast in and around Netanya, and the Rebbe chose the land on the Netanya beachfront.Lifschitz, Rebuilding, pp. 160-161. According to Rabbi Eliyahu Shmuel Schmerler, rosh yeshiva of the Sanz yeshiva in Netanya and a long-time confidante of the Rebbe, \\"The Rebbe mentioned at the time that the day would come when people would not say 'Kiryat Sanzthat‚Äôs near Netanya,' but that 'Netanya was near Kiryat Sanz'\\". The purchase price of the land was covered with part of a $1 million check that the Rebbe had received from the City of New York, which was planning to build a new road in place of the ageing buildings occupied by the Rebbe's Yesodei HaTorah school in Brooklyn.Lifschitz, Rebuilding, p. 71. The first deposit was made on 30 September (3 Tishrei) 1954 and toasted in the Rebbe's Williamsburg home at the end of that day, after the conclusion of the Fast of Gedalia. In later years, the Israel Land Administration would grant additional acreage to the budding community.Lifschitz, Rebuilding, p. 162 On 4 March (21 Adar) 1956, the Rebbe returned to Israel to lay the cornerstone for Kiryat Sanz in the presence of thousands of religious Jews, many of them Sanzer Hasidim and others Holocaust survivors who had known the Rebbe from Germany. He delivered a lengthy speech expounding on the holiness of the Land of Israel and encouraging more Jews to settle here. He also outlined his vision for the new village: > Hundreds of families will move to Kiryat Sanz from abroad and establish > roots here, living their lives according to our holy Torah and our > tradition. In the center of the city there will be a yeshivah and > educational institutions for both boys and girls, to educate them in Torah > and fear of Heaven. We will build businesses and factories that will provide > the families who move here with an honorable livelihood and steady income. > Today is a day of great celebration for me. I have often thought to myself, > \\"Why did I remain among the living? Why did I alone survive from my entire > family?\\" Today I know clearly that everything happened so that I should > merit to lay, with my very own hands, the cornerstone of Kiryat Sanz in the > Land of Israel.Lifschitz, Rebuilding, p. 168.

Rabbi Yekusiel Yehudah Halberstam is seen at center left; his eldest son, Rabbi Zvi Elimelech Halberstam (with glasses) is seated to his left. Thereafter the Rebbe began planning all the infrastructure for his community, including kindergartens, boys' and girls' schools, yeshivas, seminaries, synagogues, a children's home for orphaned and needy girls, an old-age home, and a hospital. In 1958 he laid the cornerstone for both the old-age home and the hospital; the former was completed in 1960, while the latter, which became known as Laniado Hospital, did not open until 1975.Hall, Y. (1 February 2006). The Hospital with a Jewish Heart. Hamodia Magazine, pp. 12-13, 17. In addition to religious services, the new settlement had a diamond polishing factory built by a New York diamond merchant. The Rebbe, his family, and 50 followers made aliyah to Kiryat Sanz on 20 December (19 Kislev) 1959. From then on, the Rebbe celebrated the 19th of Kislev as a personal holiday.Lifschitz, Rebuilding, p. 175. Thereafter he divided his time between his home in Kiryat Sanz and the yeshiva community which he established in Union City, New Jersey in 1968 for young men who could not move to Israel. He died in Kiryat Sanz on 18 June 1994. Kiryat Sanz today Laniado Hospital maternity wing. Today Kiryat Sanz has a population of approximately 600 families. Most of the older generation are Holocaust survivors. Besides its educational facilities for boys and girls from elementary to post-graduate, it has five synagogues, a mikveh, a printing house, a religious hotel, a religious nursing school, and the Laniado Hospital, which encompasses two medical centers, a children‚Äôs hospital, a geriatric center and a nursing school, serving a regional population of over 450,000. Befitting its role as a Torah-observant community, Kiryat Sanz is closed to traffic on Shabbat. Its beachfront was also the first in Israel to schedule separate swimming hours for men and women. Notwithstanding its predominant Haredi atmosphere, Kiryat Sanz is known for its tolerance toward non-religious Jews. Much of the credit for the tolerant feeling between Netanya's religious and non-religious populations goes to the Klausenburger Rebbe, who founded Kiryat Sanz and its regional hospital from the desire to give to and benefit others. Observers believe that the example set by Laniado Hospital, which treats patients of all races and backgrounds and does not leave any proselytizing literature in the wards, is responsible for the growth of the religious list in local elections. Since the Rebbe's death in 1994, his eldest son, Rabbi Zvi Elimelech Halberstam, known as the Sanzer Rebbe, has been the spiritual leader of the Sanz community in Israel. From his home in Kiryat Sanz, he directs the Sanz Torah and chessed organizations in Netanya, Jerusalem, Bnei Brak, Petah Tikva, Haifa, Safed, Ashdod, Modiin, Beitar Illit, and Elad. He is also directly responsible for all the institutions built by his father in Israel, including Laniado Hospital, where he serves as president.

Early life and education Harriet Farley was the sixth of ten children born to Reverend Stephen and Lucy Farley. She grew up in Atkinson, New Hampshire and attended Atkinson Academy, a school for both boys and girls, of which her father was the principal. Career The Farleys were extremely poor, so at the age of fourteen, Harriet began doing piecework to earn money for her family. She was also a schoolteacher for several years, although she found that teaching was not to her liking. In 1837, at the age of 25, Harriet left New Hampshire to work in the textile mills of Lowell, Massachusetts. There were high literacy rates among the young female workers of the Lowell mills, and many, like Harriet Farley, had been schoolteachers before entering factory work. It was common for these women to form writing groups, and out of one of these grew a magazine called The Lowell Offering in 1840. Farley wrote articles and editorials for The Lowell Offering under a myriad of pseudonyms and eventually became editor in 1842; in 1843, Harriot Curtis, a fellow mill worker, became her co-editor. Since the magazine was written by and for the mill girls, it was received with both criticism and interest by the general public. Some, including labor organizer Orestes Brownson, felt that the publication did not place enough emphasis on labor reform and the deplorable working conditions of the mills. Farley defended herself in a letter of response to his condemnation, insisting that the Offering was solely a literary magazine and had never been intended to be a political commentary. Despite these criticisms, the material published in The Lowell Offering had widespread distribution. In 1844, an anthology of pieces from the magazine was published in Great Britain, even attracting the attention of Charles Dickens. As mill work was still a fairly new practice at this time, the Offering found a large audience abroad, especially in Europe, because it provided insight into the daily lives of mill workers. Though she was determined to keep reform out of her publication, Farley was involved in one of the most prominent political movements of the time. In 1843, she joined the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society and soon became an influential abolitionist leader in Lowell. As part of the society, Farley helped raise money and awareness for the cause of abolitionism. The Lowell Offering ceased publication in December, 1845 when protests about working conditions increased, and the magazine began to seem too conservative for its audience. Harriet's own popularity had declined, as well, largely due to her defenses of factory management and her repeated claims that factory life was not unjust. From 1847 to 1850, the magazine was revived, with Farley as editor and publisher, as the New England Offering. This short-lived publication focused more on labor reform than The Lowell Offering had. After moving to New York City, Farley went on to write for the women's magazine Godey's Lady's Book, edited by her friend Sarah J. Hale. Farley's journalistic work was collected in two volumes in the late 1840s, and she also published a children's novel called Happy Nights at Hazel Nook in 1852. Additionally, she published Shells from the Strand of the Sea of Genius, a book of homilies, and edited her father's book on theology. =Writer= After working as a weaver in Lowell textile mills, Farley began contributing to the Lowell Offering. The Lowell Offering was a monthly magazine that was thirty-two pages long. It ran to five volumes, published from 1840 to 1845 with over fifty women contributors. The Lowell Offering emerged from a working women's writing circle held at the Second Universalist Church.Ranta, Judith. \\"New England Offering.\\" New England Offering. January 1, 1850. Accessed November 10, 2014. http://library.uml.edu/clh/NewOff.html. Through publishing poetry, articles, and personal essays, this magazine provided an opportunity to share the writing of working women in Lowell textile mills. Working together on contributing to the ‚ÄúLowell Offering‚Äù was one of the ways that women could continue their education while working in the mills.Dublin, Thomas. Women at Work: The Transformation of Work and Community in Lowell, Massachusetts, 1826-1860. New York: Columbia University Press, 1979. The Lowell Offering wanted to show that working women could be intellectuals.Eisenmann, Linda. \\"L.\\" In Historical Dictionary of Women's Education in the United States, 232-255. Westport, Conn.: Greenwood Press, 1998. This image went against what European social reforms and union supporters thought of the mills. As the publication grew, it became something in which the contributors took great pride. The Offering was applauded by many famous authors such as, Charles Dickens, Anthony Trollope, and George Sand. The Lowell Offering briefly discontinued in 1845. In 1847, Farley reissued the Lowell Offering under the name New England Offering, reaching out to a wider range of female contributors. In April 1848, she became its publisher, proprietor, and traveling agent. Farley hoped the ‚ÄúNew England Offering‚Äù would have the same popularity as the ‚ÄúLowell Offering‚Äù. Unfortunately the ‚ÄúNew England Offering‚Äù did not repeat the success of its predecessor. The ‚ÄúNew England Offering‚Äù lasted for two more issues. The New England Offering, like the Lowell Offering, was a venue where working women could share their writings. In both publication, Farley provided for the first time in history literary venues where working women could publish poetry, articles, and personal stories under a high standard of literary review. Personal life In 1854, Harriet married John Intaglio Dunlevy, a New York engraver and inventor. During the next two decades she stopped publishing and raised 5 sons and daughters. After Donlevy's death, she published a Christmas book, Fancy's Frolics, in 1880. Harriet Farley died in New York City in 1907, at the age of 95.

Plot Three prisoners are locked up in the same cell. Green-Eyes (Yeux-Verts) has killed a woman and is to be guillotined. Maurice and Lefranc are sentenced for more minor crimes. Maurice has a deep attachment to Green-Eyes, as does Lefranc, but secretly. He also hates Maurice, while feigning to hate Green-Eyes, preferring him to Snowball (Boule- de-Neige). Snowball himself is also condemned to death (his presence in the play is only evoked, not actual) and along with Green-Eyes they are considered the Kings of the prison. In fact their sentence traps them in a solitude and an immense unhappiness which lends them a certain dignity. Lefranc, who is constantly in conflict with Maurice (especially because of Green-Eyes's woman whom both of them desire), ends up strangling him in order to join Green-Eyes in his solitude and dejection.

It was one of twelve elementary flying training schools employed by the RAAF to provide introductory flight instruction to new pilots as part of Australia's contribution to the Empire Air Training Scheme. No. 5 EFTS was established in June 1940 at Narromine, New South Wales, and primarily operated Tiger Moths. It ceased training in June 1944, after more than 3,700 students had passed through. History alt=Five men in light-coloured military uniforms with dark forage caps Flying instruction in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) underwent major changes following the outbreak of World War II, in response to a vast increase in the number of aircrew volunteers and the commencement of Australia's participation in the Empire Air Training Scheme (EATS). The Air Force's pre-war pilot training facility, No. 1 Flying Training School at RAAF Station Point Cook, Victoria, was supplanted in 1940‚Äì41 by twelve elementary flying training schools (EFTS) and eight service flying training schools (SFTS).Stephens (2006), pp. 67‚Äì70Gillison (1962), p. 111 The EFTS provided a twelve-week introductory flying course to personnel who had graduated from one of the RAAF's initial training schools. Flying training was undertaken in two stages: the first involved four weeks of instruction (including ten hours of flying) to determine trainees' suitability to become pilots. Those that passed this grading process then received a further eight weeks of training (including sixty-five hours of flying) at the EFTS. Pilots who successfully completed this course were posted to an SFTS in either Australia or Canada for the next stage of their instruction as military aviators.Gillison (1962), pp. 106‚Äì109 No. 5 Elementary Flying Training School (No. 5 EFTS) was formed at Narromine, New South Wales, on 24 May 1940, and came under the control of Central Area Command, headquartered in Sydney.Royal Australian Air Force (1939‚Äì45), p. 399Ashworth (2000), p. 34 Its inaugural commanding officer was Squadron Leader T.C.

They have similarities to penalty methods in that they replace a constrained optimization problem by a series of unconstrained problems and add a penalty term to the objective; the difference is that the augmented Lagrangian method adds yet another term, designed to mimic a Lagrange multiplier. The augmented Lagrangian is related to, but not identical with the method of Lagrange multipliers. Viewed differently, the unconstrained objective is the Lagrangian of the constrained problem, with an additional penalty term (the augmentation). The method was originally known as the method of multipliers, and was studied much in the 1970 and 1980s as a good alternative to penalty methods. It was first discussed by Magnus Hestenes, and by Michael Powell in 1969. The method was studied by R. Tyrrell Rockafellar in relation to Fenchel duality, particularly in relation to proximal-point methods, Moreau‚ÄìYosida regularization, and maximal monotone operators: These methods were used in structural optimization. The method was also studied by Dimitri Bertsekas, notably in his 1982 book, together with extensions involving nonquadratic regularization functions, such as entropic regularization, which gives rise to the \\"exponential method of multipliers,\\" a method that handles inequality constraints with a twice differentiable augmented Lagrangian function. Since the 1970s, sequential quadratic programming (SQP) and interior point methods (IPM) have had increasing attention, in part because they more easily use sparse matrix subroutines from numerical software libraries, and in part because IPMs have proven complexity results via the theory of self-concordant functions. The augmented Lagrangian method was rejuvenated by the optimization systems LANCELOT and AMPL, which allowed sparse matrix techniques to be used on seemingly dense but \\"partially separable\\" problems. The method is still useful for some problems., chapter 17 Around 2007, there was a resurgence of augmented Lagrangian methods in fields such as total-variation denoising and compressed sensing. In particular, a variant of the standard augmented Lagrangian method that uses partial updates (similar to the Gauss-Seidel method for solving linear equations) known as the alternating direction method of multipliers or ADMM gained some attention.  General method  Let us say we are solving the following constrained problem: : \\\\min f(\\\\mathbf{x}) subject to : c_i(\\\\mathbf{x}) = 0 ~\\\\forall i \\\\in I. This problem can be solved as a series of unconstrained minimization problems. For reference, we first list the kth step of the penalty method approach: : \\\\min \\\\Phi_k (\\\\mathbf{x}) = f (\\\\mathbf{x}) + \\\\mu_k ~ \\\\sum_{i\\\\in I} ~ c_i(\\\\mathbf{x})^2. The penalty method solves this problem, then at the next iteration it re-solves the problem using a larger value of \\\\mu_k (and using the old solution as the initial guess or \\"warm-start\\"). The augmented Lagrangian method uses the following unconstrained objective: : \\\\min \\\\Phi_k (\\\\mathbf{x}) = f (\\\\mathbf{x}) + \\\\frac{\\\\mu_k}{2} ~ \\\\sum_{i\\\\in I} ~ c_i(\\\\mathbf{x})^2 + \\\\sum_{i\\\\in I} ~ \\\\lambda_i c_i(\\\\mathbf{x}) and after each iteration, in addition to updating \\\\mu_k, the variable \\\\lambda is also updated according to the rule :\\\\lambda_i \\\\leftarrow \\\\lambda_i + \\\\mu_k c_i(\\\\mathbf{x}_k) where \\\\mathbf{x}_k is the solution to the unconstrained problem at the kth step, i.e. \\\\mathbf{x}_k=\\\\text{argmin} \\\\Phi_k(\\\\mathbf{x}) The variable \\\\lambda is an estimate of the Lagrange multiplier, and the accuracy of this estimate improves at every step. The major advantage of the method is that unlike the penalty method, it is not necessary to take \\\\mu \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty in order to solve the original constrained problem. Instead, because of the presence of the Lagrange multiplier term, \\\\mu can stay much smaller, thus avoiding ill-conditioning. The method can be extended to handle inequality constraints. For a discussion of practical improvements, see.  Alternating direction method of multipliers  The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is a variant of the augmented Lagrangian scheme that uses partial updates for the dual variables. This method is often applied to solve problems such as : \\\\min_x f(x) + g(x). This is equivalent to the constrained problem : \\\\min_{x,y} f(x) + g(y), \\\\quad \\\\text{subject to}\\\\quad x = y. Though this change may seem trivial, the problem can now be attacked using methods of constrained optimization (in particular, the augmented Lagrangian method), and the objective function is separable in x and y. The dual update requires solving a proximity function in x and y at the same time; the ADMM technique allows this problem to be solved approximately by first solving for x with y fixed, and then solving for y with x fixed. Rather than iterate until convergence (like the Jacobi method), the algorithm proceeds directly to updating the dual variable and then repeating the process. This is not equivalent to the exact minimization, but surprisingly, it can still be shown that this method converges to the right answer (under some assumptions). Because of this approximation, the algorithm is distinct from the pure augmented Lagrangian method. The ADMM can be viewed as an application of the Douglas-Rachford splitting algorithm, and the Douglas-Rachford algorithm is in turn an instance of the Proximal point algorithm; details can be found here. There are several modern software packages that solve Basis pursuit and variants and use the ADMM; such packages include YALL1 (2009), SpaRSA (2009) and SALSA (2009). There are also packages that use the ADMM to solve more general problems, some of which can exploit multiple computing cores SNAPVX (2015), parADMM (2016). Stochastic optimization Stochastic optimization considers the problem of minimizing a loss function with access to noisy samples of the (gradient of the) function. The goal is to have an estimate of the optimal parameter (minimizer) per new sample. ADMM is originally a batch method. However, with some modifications it can also be used for stochastic optimization. Since in stochastic setting we only have access to noisy samples of gradient, we use an inexact approximation of the Lagrangian as \\\\hat{\\\\mathcal{L}}_{\\\\rho,k} = f_1(x_k)+\\\\langle abla f(x_k,\\\\zeta_{k+1}),x \\\\rangle+g(y)-z^T (Ax + By - c)+\\\\frac{\\\\rho}{2} \\\\Vert Ax + By - c \\\\Vert^2+\\\\frac{\\\\Vert x-x_k \\\\Vert^2}{2\\\\eta_{k+1}}, where \\\\eta_{k+1} is a time-varying step size. The alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) is a popular method for online and distributed optimization on a large scale, and is employed in many applications, e.g. ADMM is often applied to solve regularized problems, where the function optimization and regularization can be carried out locally, and then coordinated globally via constraints. Regularized optimization problems are especially relevant in the high dimensional regime since regularization is a natural mechanism to overcome ill-posedness and to encourage parsimony in the optimal solution, e.g., sparsity and low rank. Due to the efficiency of ADMM in solving regularized problems, it has a good potential for stochastic optimization in high dimensions.

Benevolent prejudice can be expressed towards those of different race, religion, ideology, country, sex, sexual orientation, or gender identity. Some of the earliest and most notable studies on benevolent prejudice were conducted by the researchers Susan Fiske and Peter Glick, with the primary focus of their research being the issue of sexism. Benevolent prejudice derives from their studies on ambivalent sexism, claiming that there are two main types of sexist attitudes: hostile and benevolent sexism. The term benevolent sexism eventually broadened into benevolent prejudice, with one of the earliest uses of the term being in a study by Susan Fiske and Peter Glick that focused on benevolent and hostile sexism across cultures.  Application  Benevolent prejudice is a superficially positive type of prejudice that is expressed in terms of apparently positive beliefs and emotional responses. Though this type of prejudice associates supposedly good things with certain groups, it still has the result of keeping the group members in inferior positions in society. Benevolent prejudices can help justify any hostile prejudices a person has toward a particular group. It is defined by UK LGBT rights charity Stonewall as \\"expressions of positive views about minority groups that are not intended to demonstrate less positive attitudes towards them, but which may still produce negative consequences\\". Evidence also shows that there is a correlation between benevolent prejudices and hostile prejudices towards a particular group, in particular regarding the issue of benevolent prejudice towards women and misogyny.  Examples  = Race = In an experiment run by Judd, Park, Ryan, Brauer, and Kraus (), perceptions of African Americans held by European Americans show that they held hostile beliefs indicating that they viewed African Americans as hostile, cliquish, irresponsible, and loud. However, the same European American participants held benevolent beliefs that African Americans were athletic, musical, religious, and had strong family ties. The study was also done with African American participants who were asked to share their beliefs about European Americans. The African Americans said that European Americans were self-centered, greedy, stuffy/uptight, and sheltered from the real world. However, the same African Americans held benevolent beliefs that European Americans were intelligent, organized, independent, and financially well-off. =LGBT and disabled people= A Stonewall UK publication (Understanding Prejudice: Attitudes towards minorities) published in has found that interviewees used benevolent stereotyping of gay men as \\"fun\\" and \\"caring stereotypes\\" of disabled individuals, saying they were \\"vulnerable and in need of protection\\". This was seen as contrasting to the negative prejudices of Travellers and asylum seekers who were often the subject of aggressive prejudice. The survey also stated that: > These stereotypes are not intended to demonstrate a less positive attitude > towards these groups, but lesbians, gay men or disabled people can > experience these views as negative and discriminatory. This benevolent > prejudice demonstrates a lack of understanding of what being disabled or > lesbian and gay can mean; a lack of awareness of the more serious > discrimination that these groups often experience; and the changing > expectations and rights of these minority groups. Other research has > suggested that these benevolent attitudes can play an important role in the > social exclusion of particular groups, for example because labels like > \\"nice\\", \\"kind\\" and \\"helpless\\" can define some minority groups as not > competent or suitable for powerful positions. The survey also showed that men were more likely to exhibit aggressive prejudice, whereas women were more likely to exhibit benevolent prejudice. = Sexism across cultures = An experiment run by Glick and Fiske Et al. aimed to measure benevolent and hostile sexism across various countries and cultures. The study found that in countries where the levels of hostile sexism were high, the levels of benevolent sexism were also high. Researchers claimed that ‚Äúthe strength of these correlations supports the idea that HS and BS act as complementary forms of sexism.‚Äù This was exemplified in countries such as Cuba and Nigeria, where men scored higher on sexism, resulting in a higher hostile and benevolent sexism score amongst women; therefore, the results in those countries provided ‚Äúevidence consistent with the notion that disadvantaged groups adopt the system-justifying beliefs of dominant groups.‚Äù = Media literacy and stereotyping = An experiment run by Srividya Ramasubramanian and Mary Beth Oliver aimed to measure the reduction in prejudice in their participants. In the experiment, participants were to watch a media literacy video, then proceed to read stereotypical and counter- stereotypical news stories about African Americans, Asian-Indians, and Caucasian-Americans. The participants were then prompted to fill out a questionnaire regarding their feelings about the aforementioned groups. The results revealed that the participants were more likely to display benevolent prejudice towards the Asian-Indian group, than to the Caucasian-American or African American group. Benevolent prejudice towards Asian-Indians was seen as a result of the cultural stereotypes associated with the group, such as passivity and deprivation, thus the results were ‚Äúconsistent with the argument that benevolent feelings stem from notions of superiority of dominant groups over subordinate groups seen as incompetent, yet sociable.‚Äù See also Ambivalent prejudice * Ambivalent sexism * Racism * Prejudice * Stereotype  Counterstereotype  Positive stereotype * \\"Women are wonderful\\" effect  References   Further reading  Discrimination Prejudices ","title":"Benevolent prejudice"},{"id":"30899073","text":"The South African Railways Class 7E3, Series 1 of 1983 is an electric locomotive. Between 1983 and 1984, the South African Railways placed sixty Class 7E3, Series 1 electric locomotives with a Co-Co wheel arrangement in mainline service. Beginning in 2001, sixteen of these dual cab locomotives were rebuilt to single cab locomotives and reclassified to Class 7E4.South African Railways Index and Diagrams Electric and Diesel Locomotives, 610mm and 1065mm Gauges, Ref LXD 14/1/100/20, 28 January 1975, as amendedInformation received from several Transnet employees Manufacturer The 25 kV AC Class 7E3, Series 1 electric locomotive was designed for the South African Railways (SAR) by Hitachi and built in South Africa by Dorbyl, who also supplied the mechanical components. Sixty locomotives were delivered by Dorbyl in 1983 and 1984, numbered in the range from E7216 to E7275. Like Union Carriage and Wagon (UCW), Dorbyl did not allocate builder‚Äôs numbers to the locomotives it built for the SAR, but used the SAR unit numbers for their record keeping. Features =Appearance= Builders‚Äô plate, no. E7252 These dual cab locomotives have a roof access ladder on one side only, just to the right of the cab access door. The roof access ladder end is marked as the no. 1 end. Series 1 and Series 2 loco¬≠mo¬≠tives are visually indistinguishable from each other, but the two sides of both series are sufficiently different in appearance that a pair of them coupled at the same ends appears at first glance to be two different locomotive types. The roof access ladder side is smooth, while the other side has several large grilles. =Pantographs= The locomotive's pantograph placement is unusual in not being equidistant from the locomotive ends. The contact shoe centre of the no. 1 end pantograph is from the longitudinal centre of the locomotive, while that of the no. 2 end pantograph is from the longitudinal centre. =Brakes= On the Class 7E3, Series 1, control of traction and rheostatic braking is by stepless solid- state electronics. The electrical equipment was designed for high power factor operation, obtained by the switching in of power-factor correction capacitors. Unlike the Classes 7E and 7E2 Series 1 and 2 where thyristors are used, these locomotives use silicon-diode rectifiers.Jane's Train Recognition Guide =Bogies= To reduce flange and rail wear, the bogies of the Class 7E3 have a shorter wheelbase than the Class 7E1, instead of . Like the Class 7E1, the Class 7E3 was built with sophisticated traction linkages on the bogies. Together with the locomotive's electronic wheel-slip detection system these traction struts, mounted between the linkages on the bogies and the locomotive body and colloquially referred to as grasshopper legs, ensure the maximum transfer of power to the rails without causing wheel-slip by reducing the adhesion of the leading bogie and increasing that of the trailing bogie by as much as 15% upon starting. Reclassifications In the period from the early 1990s until 2007, various modifications to improve downhill braking capacity were done to the Coalink line‚Äôs Hitachi-designed locomotives. The first set of upgrades were done on the fifty Class 7E1 locomotives. =Class 7E4= From 2001, seventeen Class 7E3 locomotives, sixteen Series 1, numbers E7260 to E7275, and one Series 2, no. E7276, underwent significant modifications. This included the installation of Hitachi micro-processor controls with improved rheostatic brakes, auxiliary inverters designed and built by Fuji, and the conversion from double cab to single cab since the no. 2 end cab space was required for some of the new equipment. These modified single-cab locomotives were reclassified to Class 7E4. =Class 7E5= The conversions to Class 7E4 were costly, however, and it was decided to modify further Class 7E3 locomotives to a lesser extent, gaining almost the same benefits at a lower cost since they remained as double cab locomotives. In total about fifty locomotives of both series were upgraded in this manner. These were reclassified to Class 7E5, although externally they were still identical to the Class 7E3. =Class 7E6= Following some systems failures on the upgraded Class 7E5 locomotives, a further variation in the modifications was applied to the remaining Class 7E3 locomotives which had not yet been upgraded. These units were then reclassified to Class 7E6. Eventually all the Class 7E5 locomotives were also modified once again to meet the Class 7E6 specifications. =Revert to Class 7E3= By October 2007 all these locomotives were fully upgraded and standardised in respect of their rheostat flat topping and EPROM software. Since, apart from the single cab Class 7E4 conversions, they were once again all identical, those which had been reclassified to Classes 7E5 and 7E6 reverted to their original Class 7E3 classifications. Although numbers E7216 to E7259 are all officially designated Class 7E3, Series 1 once again, many of these 44 locomotives still bore markings for several years to identify them as either Class 7E5 or Class 7E6. The single cab locomotives remained classified as Class 7E4. Service Since 1978, 25 kV AC was introduced on all new mainline electrification projects bar one, the exception being the Orex iron ore line from Sishen to Saldanha where 50 kV AC is used. The Class 7E3, Series 1 locomotives all served on the 25 kV AC Coalink line from Ermelo via Vryheid to the Richards Bay Coal Terminal. They remained there until sufficient numbers of the new Class 19E were available by about 2011 to allow some of the Class 7E3 to be re-allocated to Pyramid South, north of Pretoria. Liveries All the Class 7E3, Series 1 locomotives were delivered in the SAR red oxide livery with signal red buffer beams and cowcatchers, yellow whiskers and with the number plates on the sides mounted on three-stripe yellow wings. In the 1990s some of them were repainted in the Spoornet orange livery with a yellow and blue chevron pattern on the buffer beams and cowcatchers. In the late 1990s many were repainted in the Spoornet blue livery with either solid or outline numbers on the long hood sides.Soul of A Railway, System 7, Western Transvaal, based in Johannesburg, Part 9.

Origins It is unclear when Br√§tte was founded, but it was a commercial center in the early 1500s. The name Br√§tte was first mentioned in 1556. Its site was important because the rapids and waterfalls on the G√∂ta √Ñlv at R√•nnum (current Varg√∂n) and Trollh√§ttan barred navigation to shipping on V√§nern and obliged traders to unload their cargoes here for portage on the Edsv√§gen. In addition, roads connected to the then Norwegian Bohusl√§n, Skara and Dalsland. Sometime between 1580 and 1587 Br√§tte was granted town privileges. During the Kalmar War (1611-1613), Nya L√∂d√∂se was taken by the Danes and some of its population moved to nearby market towns, principally Br√§tte, whose population increased from 200 to 450. While Nya L√∂d√∂se was Danish, Br√§tte became Sweden's only place of shipment to the west until 1619 when Sweden regained its lost areas in √Ñlvsborg's second strike. Decline Memorial stone over Br√§tte Br√§tte could not survive because militarily it occupied a poor location and the natural separation of Lake Vassbotten from the rest of V√§nern prevented ships from reaching Br√§tte. There had already been attempts to move the town, both by Gustav Vasa in 1560 and by Eric XIV a few years later. The next attempt was made by Charles IX in 1610 after a fire destroyed six of the town's 22 houses. The intended location was privately owned, however, but in 1641 an agreement enabled the acquisition of the estate. Br√§tte's residents were now able to establish their new city and on February 1, 1644, Queen Christina granted regency privileges for V√§nersborg. The last inhabitants left Br√§tte in 1647. Excavations Archaeological excavations were made in 1918 and 1943 and the remains of the city are now visible. Many of the finds can be seen in the V√§nersborg Museum, where a model (by Soren Elmqvist) depicts Br√§tte as it was in the early 1600s.

Garc√≠a, born on June 25, 1971, in Mayag√ºez, Puerto Rico, is a Puerto Rican banker, public servant, and private equity investor who served as president of the Puerto Rico Government Development Bank (GDB) from 2009 to 2011 during the administration of Governor Luis Fortu√±o. Appointed as president, CEO and Chairman of the Board of GDB on November 13, 2008 by Gov.-elect Fortu√±o, he had to assume responsibilities long before going on the payroll since they both had to travel to Wall Street, while still in transition, to buy time from the credit-rating agencies to avoid having the island's bonds reclassified into junk-bond status before the new administration had an opportunity to legislate new fiscal policy laws. The 2009 legislation to handle the $3.306 billion operational and structural deficit that the new administration confronted upon taking office created a Fiscal Reconstruction and Stabilization Board (JREF) and the Governor appointed Garc√≠a as chairman of the new board that was tasked with designing and implementing the fiscal recuperation policies. Over 22 months, government expenditures were reduced by 20% and Wall Street credit-rating agencies restored the islands' ratings to their highest levels in 35 years and used a newly enacted Public-Private Partnership Act, as well as the 2006 COFINA securitization mechanism to stabilize Puerto Rico's finances.. As head of the Governor's economic team, Garc√≠a coordinated simultaneously the disbursement of over $6.5 billion in American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 funds, lobbying and implementation of the federal health reform program that is injecting hundreds of millions of dollars in new federal dollars in Puerto Rico's health industry, and the rescue of Puerto Rico's banking system, including three Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation-assisted transactions that comprised 70% of Puerto Rico's banking market. During his stint in the public sector, he also served as Chairman of the Board of the newly created Puerto Rico Public-Private Partnerships Authority, charged initially with five major public private initiatives, three of which injected over $3 billion in Puerto Rico's economy. Prior to his stint in public life, Carlos Garc√≠a served as president and COO of Banco Santander Puerto Rico, one of the top banks in Puerto Rico, as well as member of the Board of Directors of Santander Bancorp (NYSE: SBP) from 2001 to 2008. Until 2001, he served as president, CEO and Vice Chairman of the Board of Santander Securities Corporation, Puerto Rico's second largest wealth and asset management firm. Before joining the Santander corporate family, he served as Vice President of Popular Securities, a subsidiary of Popular Inc., and an analyst for Credit Suisse First Boston in San Juan, Puerto Rico and New York, New York. Carlos is currently the Managing Partner of the financial institutions focused private equity firm, BayBoston Capital. Married with three children, Garc√≠a is an avid marathoner. Education A graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, Garc√≠a participation in a dual degree program made it possible to obtain a Bachelor of Science in Economics, majoring in Management, from the Wharton School, and a Bachelor of Arts and Sciences degree in Comparative Literature after completing an honors thesis on Federico Garc√≠a Lorca's \\"Sonetos del Amor Oscuro\\", published after the Spanish writer's death.

The aim of TIDs is increasing the number of overnight visitors using business and services in that area. TIDs are formed through a public-private partnership between the local government and the businesses in a district. TID funds are usually managed by a nonprofit corporation, generally a Convention and Visitors' Bureau, hotel association, or similar destination marketing organization. Typical TID services include marketing programs to raise awareness of the destination, sponsorship of special events that attract overnight visitors, and sales programs to bring in large-group business. Synonymous terms for TIDs include: tourism marketing district, hotel improvement district, and tourism business improvement district. Tourism Improvement Districts by US States =California= In California, tourism improvement districts are formed under the Property and Business Improvement District Law of 1994, the Parking and Business Improvement Area Law of 1989, or a similar enabling ordinance adopted by a charter city. California districts are also subject to other laws designed to ensure approval by business owners paying the assessment and accountability by the managing body to those business owners. Tourism improvement districts are formed with a majority of assessed businesses consenting and the local government's approval. Funds raised are returned to a non-profit corporation which is under contract with the local government to manage those funds. Several accountability mechanisms ensure that funds are spent in accordance with a specifically defined district plan that includes marketing and sales programs approved by the businesses paying into the district. The two main reasons for TIDs' growing popularity among tourism-related businesses are: * Funds cannot be spent on programs that don't benefit the businesses paying the assessment * Funds cannot be diverted by the government for other programs As of November 2010, there were 54 known local tourism improvement districts in California, including: *San Diego Tourism Marketing District *Napa Valley Tourism Improvement District *Sacramento County Tourism Improvement District *Marin County Tourism Improvement District *South Lake Tahoe Tourism Business Improvement District *San Jose Hotel Business Improvement Area *Santa Barbara South Coast Tourism Business Improvement District *Long Beach Tourism Business Improvement Area *Del Mar Tourism Business Improvement District *Newport Beach Tourism Improvement District *Monterey County Tourism Improvement District *Mendocino County Lodging Business Improvement District *Oceanside Tourism Marketing District Most districts encompass either a city or county, although some include multiple cities or a county and the cities within it. California's first tourism improvement district was formed in West Hollywood in 1992. The recent tourism improvement district was formed in Santa Barbara in September, 2010. California's tourism improvement districts range from small 5-hotel community districts to major cities with several hundred hotels and its budget ranges from $100,000 to over $30 million. One of California's most noticeable tourism improvement districts is the San Diego Tourism Marketing District. The district funded the hugely popular ‚ÄúHappy Happens‚Äù advertising campaign. The San Diego Tourism Marketing District funds many programs and events designed to bring overnight visitors to San Diego, including Comic Con and the Holiday Bowl. A lawsuit filed in 2012 by San Diegans for Open Government challenges the renewal of the San Diego Tourism Marketing District. The lawsuit filed by Cory Briggs, a public interest lawyer, claims that the assessment is basically a tax and therefore is not valid under California proposition 26 which requires a two-thirds supermajority to pass any tax. In January 2016 the judge sided with San Diegans for Open Government that the nonprofit has legal standing to pursue the case. The case now moves on to be argued on the merits of the lawsuit. =Montana= In Montana, upon a petition by owners of 60% of the businesses in the district, a municipality may begin the district formation process by adopting a resolution of intention. There is a 15-day period in which owners may protest formation of the district, and the municipality must hold public hearings on the proposed district. A 5-7 member board of trustees is appointed to manage the district.Montana Code Annotated, TITLE 7. LOCAL GOVERNMENT, CHAPTER 12. IMPROVEMENT DISTRICTS, Part 11.

This part may be cited as the \\"Business Improvement District Act\\" =Nevada= In 2005, Nevada passed a tourism improvement district law. Under the law, the governing body of a municipality may create a tourism improvement district for the purposes of carrying out the law and without any election can acquire, improve, equip, operate and maintain a project within such district. The district may impose a sales tax within the district. =Washington State= Washington's Tourism Promotion Areas LawChapter 35.101 RCW Tourism Promotion Areas http://apps.leg.wa.gov/rcw/default.aspx?cite=35.101 requires submission of petitions from business owners who will pay 60% or more of the proposed assessment. Only lodging businesses with forty or more units can be included in the tourism promotion area. Upon receipt of petitions, the municipality must adopt a resolution of intention and hold public hearings on the proposed promotion area. An advisory board or commission may be appointed, or a destination marketing organization may be designated to manage the district funds.

It is now part of the Gorham campus of the University of Southern Maine (USM), housing the Center for Education Policy, Applied Research, and Evaluation (CEPARE).Campus Descriptions: GORHAM CAMPUS Library, University of Southern Maine It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972. Description and history The McLellan House stands north of Gorham center, on the west side of School Street. It is set back on a rise overlooking the street, at the northern edge of the USM campus. It is a 2-1/2 story brick structure, five bays wide, with a side gable roof and a granite foundation. The front and right walls of the building are laid in Flemish bond, while the left and rear are laid in common bond. The gable ends are framed in wood and finished with clapboards. First-floor windows and the center entrance are set in segmented-arch openings, while second-floor windows are set in rectangular openings. The interior has been repeatedly altered, especially due to different uses by the university, but retains a few elements of original trim and styling. The house was built in 1773 for Hugh and Elizabeth McLellan, who arrived in the area in 1740, and are counted among Gorham's earliest settlers. It is believed to be the first brick house built in Cumberland County, and is among the oldest surviving brick buildings in the state. It was acquired by Gorham State College (now the University of Southern Maine) in 1966 and converted to a dormitory. It has since been adapted for use as office space.

It transported three members of the Expedition 35 crew to the International Space Station. TMA-08M was the 117th flight of a Soyuz spacecraft, the first flight launching in 1967. The Russian Soyuz TMA-08M utilized the new 6-hour fast rendezvous flight profile developed by the Russian Federal Space Agency (RKA) and previously tested on Progress M-16M and M-17M, instead of the usual two-day rendezvous, making it possible for crew members to leave ground facilities and board the International Space Station in less time than a typical transatlantic flight. Crew The Soyuz TMA-08M crew members conduct their ceremonial tour of Red Square on 7 March 2013. =Backup crew= Launch The Soyuz rocket launches from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome The rollout of the Soyuz FG Rocket occurred on 26 March 2013. After being erected into position at the launch pad, the launch vehicle was prepared for the countdown and its launch on 28 March. Final cargo items including some time-critical experiment payloads for the Russian segment of the space station were loaded into the Soyuz at the launch pad. The Soyuz FG Rocket carrying the Soyuz TMA-08M atop was launched from Site 1/5 at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 20:43 GMT. All stages of the Soyuz performed normally, and less than nine minutes later it delivered the Soyuz TMA-08M crew of Pavel Vinogradov, Aleksandr Misurkin, and Christopher Cassidy into orbit. For the ride into space, Soyuz Commander Vinogradov was strapped into the center seat while board engineer Misurkin and flight Engineer Chris Cassidy took the left and the right seats, respectively. Expedited docking Following orbital insertion, Soyuz TMA-08M immediately began rendezvous operations. On the first orbit, the spacecraft executed its first two programmed engine burns. On the second orbit, actual orbital parameters were transmitted from a Russian ground site. With these parameters, Soyuz performed eight further rendezvous burns over the next five hours of flight. The docking of Soyuz TMA-08M to the space station was accomplished after just four orbits and just under six hours post launch. The docking of the spacecraft to the MRM-2 Poisk module occurred at 2:28 GMT on 29 March 2013 slightly ahead of the schedule. The event set a new record for the fastest crewed docking for the International Space Station program. Previous Soyuz launches had taken two days. After the hatches opened at 4:35 GMT, the newly arrived Soyuz crew was welcomed aboard the space station by Expedition 35 commander Chris Hadfield and flight engineers Thomas Marshburn and Roman Romanenko. All six crew members participated in a welcome ceremony with family members and mission officials gathered at the Russian Mission Control Center near Moscow. Undocking and landing  At the completion of the 166-day mission, the Soyuz TMA-08M spacecraft undocked from Poisk Module of the space station at 23:37 GMT on September 10, 2013. The Soyuz initiated the Deorbit Burn at 2:05 GMT and a 4 minutes 46 seconds retrograde burn of its SKD Main Propulsion System. At 2:32 GMT on September 11, the three modules of the Soyuz separated at an altitude of 140 kilometers. Soon afterwards the Soyuz Entry Module designed to survive the reentry experienced the first traces of the atmosphere (entry interface) and gradually heat started to build up on the spacecraft's thermal protection system. At about seven minutes after entry interface, the maximum stress on the spacecraft occurred and as expected during this period of reentry communications with the Soyuz were lost. During the following atmospheric flight, the Entry Module slowed to about 240 m/s and as it passed 10.6 Kilometers in altitude, initiated the parachute deployment sequence. Three chutes were sequentially deployed (a Pilot Chute, a Drogue Chute and the Main Chute). The deployment of the Main Chute occurred at an altitude of about 7.5 Kilometers slowing the spacecraft to 6 m/s. The spacecraft carrying Vinogradov, Misurkin and Cassidy landed on the steppe of Kazakhstan (southeast of the town of Dzhezkazgan) at 2:58 GMT on September 11, 2013. Soon afterwards, the Soyuz Entry Module was surrounded by recovery personnel getting ready to open the hatch. First to be extracted from the spacecraft was commander Vinogradov followed by NASA astronaut Cassidy. Last to be extracted from the Entry Module was Misurkin. The three crew members were placed in reclining chairs and due to bad weather they were quickly ushered to the medical tent setup nearby. Shortly after landing, Cassidy and Misurkin, also participated in a post-landing activity by going through a number of exercises to assess their physiological state. These tests will be used to determine how crew members would feel after landing on Mars to assess what type of activities they could perform shortly after landing. Cosmonauts Vinogradov and Misurkin were flown back to Star City, outside Moscow, while astronaut Cassidy boarded a NASA Gulfstream III aircraft to fly back to Houston.

His repertoire consisted of original and classic blues and boogie-woogie and Depression-era popular songs.Larkin, Colin, ed. The Encyclopedia of Popular Music Vol. 2; London 1998 p. 1319. . Known as the \\"King of Barrelhouse Blues\\", his better-known songs include \\"I Believe You Need a Shot\\" and \\"My Baby Cooks My Breakfast\\". Childhood There is no record of James Crutchfield's birth: \\"My mama never know'd what day it was, she never know'd what month it was, but she always know'd what year it was. 'Lotta folks back in them days never even know'd that much, but my mama always did. She told me I was born in '12, in Baton Rouge, when the high water was highest.\\" Crutchfield said his mother, Sarah, was a \\"Geechee\\", a descendant of slaves of the Georgia/Carolina sea islands, and said he much resembled her. His father, Tom Crutchfield, he described as a large copper-colored man from southwestern Mississippi, whom he had never met until he was eight years old and with whom he maintained a cordial relationship thereafter. An only child, James and his mother, a farm worker, migrated through Louisiana and East Texas with the cotton and sugarcane seasons, moving often and sometimes living in tents. His earliest memories were of the \\"boys\\" coming home from World War I and the silent-movie Westerns of William S. Hart, whom he idolized.Rio, Johnny. \\"Ain't Nothin' but a House Party\\" The Soulard Renaissance XIII-4 Fall 1988 Around 1920, his mother married and settled in Bogalusa, Louisiana. In his early teens, while employed as the janitor in a theater, Crutchfield began to teach himself to play on the house piano.\\"James Crutchfield Interview\\". www.stlblues.net. Retrieved March 2011. Also around this time, curious about the exact day of his birth, he went to the Baton Rouge library and told the story his mother had told him to an intrigued librarian. Together they looked through the 1912 newspapers and found that indeed, there had been a flood then, which crested on May 25. From that time on, he regarded that date as his birthday. In 1927, working as an underage employee for a local railroad, Crutchfield lost his left leg below the knee in a coupling accident. The railroad settled out of court for twenty thousand dollars. Part of the money was used to buy his mother a house in Baton Rouge; the rest, with his now diminished opportunities for employment, was used to subsidize his fledgling musical career. Career By the end of the 1920s, Crutchfield had begun traveling a rough-and-tumble circuit of Louisiana lumber camps, Mississippi levee camps and East Texas juke joints,Silvester, Peter J. The Story of Boogie-Woogie: A Left Hand Like God; Scarecrow Press 2009 pp. 143‚Äì44. . performing as the M & O KidCrutchfield, James, and Bruin, Leo. St. Louis Blues Piano; Liner Notes 1983/2001 in deference to his mentor, the Mississippi barrelhouse bluesman M & O, whom Crutchfield in later years said was the best he ever heard. The establishments that served the lumber and levee camps typically stayed open all day and night and provided food, drink and lodging for two piano players, who each played a 12-hour shift for tips. Competition for these jobs was cut-throat, and Crutchfield developed his lifelong habit of playing for hours without a break, out of fear that somebody better would sit down and play in his absence and steal his job ‚Äì which evidently had happened.Stage, Wm. \\"James' Leg\\" The Riverfront Times; April 3, 2002 Another early influence was Papa Lord God, a Texan: \\"Oh Papa Lord God, he was bad, man, he was baaad!\\" Little Brother Montgomery showed him \\"44 Blues\\" when the Montgomery brothers performed in Bogalusa, and he traded techniques in after- hours sessions with Champion Jack Dupree when they played at rival nightclubs on the same street in Baton Rouge, early in their careers. Crutchfield worked as accompanist to Joe Pullum in the early 1930s and performed with him in Texas and Louisiana, occasionally hopping freight trains for transportation. He was to play Pullum's hit \\"Black Gal\\" for the rest of his life. Shortly after the end of World War II, Crutchfield performed in Mississippi with Elmore James and Boyd Gilmore \\"in places like Goodman or out in the country.\\" In 1948, Crutchfield moved to St. Louis, Missouri, a city with a venerable blues piano tradition dating back to the ragtime era.\\"James Crutchfield Profile\\" Bluesworld.com. Retrieved March 2011. He worked in the Gaslight Square entertainment district at various venues, including a decade-long residency at \\"Miss Rosalee's\\" Left Bank. In 1955, Crutchfield was appearing with Bat the Hummingbird (drums) at a bar located at 2220 Market Street that was formerly Tom Turpin's Rosebud Saloon, where Scott Joplin had performed half a century earlier.Belford, Kevin. Devil at the Confluence: The Pre-War Blues Music of St. Louis, Missouri; Virginia Publishing 2009 p. 180. . He was found there by Bob Koester, on a tip from police detective Charlie O'Brien, and recorded a few days later, along with Speckled Red, by Ralph and Ethel Hiett. Several of the songs were eventually released in the Barrelhouse Blues and Stomps anthology series on the Euphonic label. Six selections are included on the compilation album Biddle Street Barrelhousin', released in 2000 by Delmark Records.Koester, Bob. Biddle Street Barrelhousin; Liner Notes 2000 The decline of Gaslight Square in the late 1960s was also the decline of Crutchfield's music career. He was professionally inactive in the 1970s and worked as a cook at the State Hospital for a number of years. In the early 1980s he was collecting and selling junk tires and running an illegal gambling operation. Rediscovery In 1981, Swingmaster, a new Dutch record label, was interested in recording any of the old-time St. Louis barrelhouse piano players that might still be alive. They contacted the same Charlie O'Brien who had been instrumental in locating Crutchfield a quarter-century earlier, and he reported that Crutchfield was still around and in fine form. Swingmaster visited St. Louis that year, but had no luck finding him. They returned in 1983, and this time, with the assistance of bluesman Henry Townsend, they were successful. Crutchfield traveled to Groningen, Netherlands, later that year and recorded the album Original Barrelhouse Blues, which was re-released on CD in 2001 as St. Louis Blues Piano. A tour included performances in Belgium, France, Germany and several venues in the Netherlands, notably the concerthall Vredenburg in Utrecht, which he later said was the largest crowd he had ever played for. Back in St. Louis, local impresario Mark O'Shaughnessy guided Crutchfield's comeback and introduced him to the contemporary blues scene. He received a publicity boost when he was selected as the first recipient of the Lillian Carter Award for Outstanding Senior Citizen in 1984. Crutchfield and his wife, Ernestine, moved to the Soulard neighborhood, an area known for its many nightclubs, and he played weekly at Broadway Oyster Bar, 1860 Saloon and Mike & Min's, among other engagements. In the late 1980s, Crutchfield was regularly performing with a backup group consisting of Guitar Frank, Papa John (washtub bass) and Rosceaux (washboard).Crone, Thomas. \\"Soulard's Favorite Sons\\" The Riverfront Times; December 16, 1998 He played the 1988 St. Louis Blues Festival at the Jefferson Memorial in Forest Park, appeared every weekend at Allen Avenue,Farrar, Jay.

In the early 1990s, Crutchfield replaced the \\"tub\\" and \\"rub-board\\" with Sharon Foehner (bass) and Bill Howell (drums) and added Andy Millner (harmonica). In addition to weekly engagements, one-nighters, parties and weddings, he appeared at the 1993 St. Louis Blues Festival on the riverfront,\\"Blues Festival Schedule\\" St. Louis Post-Dispatch; August 17, 1993 Harp Attack at Mississippi Nights,Harp Attack '93 Poster. and the Casa Loma Ballroom.Homeless Benefit Concert handbill, May 23, 1993.

Background Historically, soldiers serving overseas had been paid in local currency rather than in their \\"home\\" currency;Rundell, p. 381 most cash drawn by soldiers would go directly into the local economy, and in a damaged economy the effects of a hard currency such as the dollar circulating freely alongside weaker local currencies could be severely problematic, risking severe inflation.Rundell, p. 383 There were other problems as well; once dollars were circulating in a combat region, the opposing side could freely use its own stocks of dollars as currency, or acquire stocks for use elsewhere.Rundell, pp. 383-4 The high purchasing power of the dollar, and its easy transference back to the United States, also posed a significant incentive to black- marketeering.Rundell, p. 384 However, whilst the use of local currencies was effective where they were provided in cooperation with the local authorities, it was impractical in combat zones where the government might be either hostile, deliberately ambivalent, or simply non-existent. In these cases, the military authorities issued special \\"military currency\\", which was paid out to soldiers at a fixed rate of exchange and simply declared legal tender in occupied areas by local commanders.

He has one older sister, Rae. He grew up in a small village near Caerwys. Williams attended Primary School in both Holywell and Nannerch until 1975. From the age of eleven, he attended Alun School where he received A-levels in mathematics, geography, and chemistry. Williams earned his Bachelor of Science in chemistry from the University of Liverpool, in 1985, writing an undergraduate dissertation on \\"Spectroscopic Studies of Vitamin E Related Systems\\" where he applied both electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) to the study of molecules similar in structure to Vitamin E. Williams earned his Ph.D. in chemistry, funded by Royal Dutch Shell, from Royal Holloway, University of London in 1988 and wrote a thesis entitled \\"High pressure NMR and relaxation studies of alkyl chain systems\\". He won the Bourne Medal from the University of London for this work and developed a unifying theory for modeling NMR relaxation data to examine the molecular motions of alkyl chains. He also used the Cobalt-59 NMR chemical shift for cobalt (III) hexacyanide as both a temperature and pressure probe. During his PhD he developed an interest in personal computers and wrote software programs to fit NMR relaxation data. Williams continued his work in spectroscopy at the National Research Council (Canada) using EPR spectroscopy to perform single- crystal studies of organometallics compounds. Career In 1991, Williams joined Ottawa University as their NMR Facility Manager. He continued his personal interests in multinuclear NMR to perform 2D-NMR experiments examining Selenium exchange in mixed-halogen systems. He also performed Silicon-29 and Tellurium-125 NMR studies. In 1992 Williams left Canada for Rochester, NY to work for the Eastman Kodak Company as their NMR Technology Leader. At Kodak he used his previous experience in studying alkyl chain related systems to study micelles. He was involved in the early adoption of Liquid Chromatography-NMR into the company and in the development of an Open Access laboratory for chemists to use roboticized analytical instrumentation to generate data. At Kodak he was part of a three-member team that developed a web-based Laboratory information management system (LIMS) system called WIMS, the Web-based Information Management System and it was the first web-based LIMS system in the world to manage chemical structures and spectral data. He was granted two patents while at Kodak,Photographic emulsion having an improved speed. US Patent 6,040,129Process for the manufacture of dihydropyrimidines, US Patent 5,576,432 In 1997 he started work for a Canadian start-up company, Advanced Chemistry Development (ACD/Labs) as their senior product manager. He was responsible for managing all spectroscopy, structure drawing and IUPAC nomenclature, products. While in that role the analytical data management software was expanded to include support for mass spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy, chromatography and other forms of analytical sciences. His research interests at that time include the development of algorithms for NMR prediction ( and) and, specifically, development of software approaches to Computer Assisted structure Elucidation, so-called CASE systems. The CASE tools have been used for the purpose of structure revision whereby algorithms have been demonstrated to outperform human interpretation of spectral data. While at ACD/Labs Williams was involved in a number of industry firsts including # producing a chemical dictionary on a Palm Computer and Pocket PC, # working with Gary E. Martin and other colleagues to develop new NMR processing techniques using covariance-based approaches, # the introduction of fuzzy-logic based approaches to computer- assisted structure elucidation and 4) Approaches for automated structure verification. While at the company he initiated a hobby project to link together chemistry databases on the web. This project was called ChemSpider. ChemSpider was formally announced at the Chicago ACS meeting in March 2007 with a database containing over 10 million compounds sourced from PubChem. In 2007 when he left ACD/Labs he was the Chief Science Officer. He became an independent consultant working with a number of software companies in the cheminformatics domain, such as SimBioSys, and with research organizations to support their cheminformatics efforts. In parallel he continued to develop the ChemSpider platform with a small group of like-minded individuals interested in the development of web-based systems to serve chemistsPublic Compound Databases ‚Äì How ChemSpider changed the rules making molecules on the web free, Antony J.

Louis de Frott√© was born in Alen√ßon (Normandy). He joined the Royal Army in 1781, and was in command of infantry units by 1789, when the French Revolution broke out. Frott√© joined the √©migr√©s, and served in the combined Prussian and Austrian army of the Duke of Brunswick, which aimed to restore the monarchy in France. Frott√© fought at Valmy in 1792, and, after Brunswick's unsuccessful campaign, sailed to England. There, he joined the vicomte de Bussy's regiment of √©migr√©s, Les Chevaliers de la couronne, venturing into Brittany several times and linking up with Chouan royalists, who had risen up against the French Republic that had evolved from the Revolution. Frott√© soon became a leader of the Chouan revolt, organizing the rebels into military units and forming a staff. By 1796, however, forces under General Hoche had scored several victories, defeating the Chouans and forcing de Frott√© to flee abroad, after repulsing his assault on Tinchebray. Returning to England, he was enlisted by Charles, Count of Artois (Louis XVI's younger brother), in an attempt to start yet another rebellion in his native Normandy. This rebellion was fairly successful, but, after Napoleon Bonaparte seized power, the tide began to turn against Frott√©, as most of his direct subordinates were killed. When, in early 1800, many rebel soldiers deserted, he began to negotiate with the government, eventually being invited by General Guidal to a meeting in Alen√ßon. Frott√© met with Guidal at the H√¥tel du Cygne on 15 February 1800. During the meeting, he was arrested by Republican forces and, three days later, brought before a military tribunal, which sentenced him to death by firing squad. He was executed on February 18.

Career Born in Trealaw, Glamorgan, Walters started his working life as a coal miner, as well as a footballer for Merthyr Town. He moved to England shortly before his 21st birthday, joining Bolton Wanderers in May 1930, and later spending time at Crystal Palace, Exeter City and Torquay United. Walters joined Third Division South side Watford in 1935. He scored the only goal of the game on his debut, an away match at Bristol Rovers on 19 October 1935, and also scored in the next two consecutive games. He only played two further matches between November and March, but finished the season in strong goalscoring form, with two hat-tricks and two further goals in the last nine games of the season. Walters played 28 games the following season, scoring 9 goals, including Watford's goal in the second leg of the Third Division South Cup final, which they drew 3‚Äì3 on aggregate with Millwall, thus sharing the trophy. In 1937‚Äì38, his last season at the club, he played 21 matches, scoring 11 goals. After leaving Watford, Walters joined Clapton Orient on a free transfer in June 1938, and joined Dartford a year later. He returned to Watford in 1940. The Football League was suspended due to the Second World War, but Walters made 34 appearances in wartime matches, scoring 16 goals. Following the war, Walters spent the remainder of his life as a publican. He died on 27 January 1968, aged 58.

Included are people who changed their legal names and people who created personal or professional pseudonyms. Under longstanding Western custom and law, children are customarily given the father's surname, except for children born outside marriage, who often carry their mother's family names.Supreme Court of New Jersey, Gubernat v. Deremer, opinion delivered by J. Stein, 11 May 1995. In mediaeval times where a great family died out in the male line, an alternative male heir to the estates was selected as one of the younger sons of a daughter, who was required by the bequest to adopt, by royal licence, in lieu of his patronymic, his maternal surname and coat of arms for himself and his descendants. This was also the origin of double-barrelled surnames, where the paternal surname was partially retained, or resurrected by a later generation. The compliance with the terms of the bequest was essential to avoid challenge by another potential heir in the lawcourts. In the 1970s some women began to adopt their mother's maiden name as their legal surnames. People in Sweden have recently begun adopting maternal line surnames in an effort to broaden the number of last names in the country. Such practices add considerable difficulties to the study of genealogy and family history. Stage names Many actors and other entertainers elect to add or include their mothers' maiden names in their adopted stage names. The book How to be a Working Actor: The Insider's Guide to Finding Jobs in Theater, Film, and Television advises aspiring performers to consider changing their names, noting that \\"if [your birth name] is difficult to spell, pronounce, or remember, it may not be the name you want for your professional career.\\" It goes on to suggest: \\"If you want to retain a connection to your family, try using your mother's maiden name or the name of a revered relative.\\"Mari Lyn Henry and Lynne Rogers (2008). How to be a Working Actor (5th Edition): The Insider's Guide to Finding Jobs in Theater, Film, and Television, Random House; , . A person's mother's maiden name is used by many financial institutions as a key piece of information to validate a customer's identity. In 2005, researchers showed that the common practice of using a mother's maiden name as the basis for a stage name could be exploited to entice people to reveal that name and other details that could allow fraudsters to steal their identities. Researchers asked a random sample of people on London streets a series of questions, beginning with \\"What is your name?\\" They then engaged in conversation about theatre, asked people if they knew how actors choose their stage names, then told them that stage names were typically a combination of the name of a pet and the mother's maiden name. Next the participants were asked what their stage names would be; 94% responded by revealing both their mother's maiden name and a pet's name.\\"Survey Reveals That People Will Give Away Their Identity For A Chance To Win Theatre Tickets\\", net-security.org, 24 March 2005; accessed 17 February 2011.

The leverage cycle can be defined as the procyclical expansion and contraction of leverage over the course of the business cycle. The existence of procyclical leverage amplifies the effect on asset prices over the business cycle.  Why is leverage significant?  Conventional economic theory suggests that interest rates determine the demand and supply of loans. This convention does not take into account the concept of default and hence ignores the need for collateral. When an investor buys an asset, they may use the asset as a collateral and borrow against it, however the investor will not be able to borrow the entire amount. The investor has to finance with their own capital the difference between the value of the collateral and the asset price, known as the margin. Thus the asset becomes leveraged. The need to partially finance the transaction with the investor's own capital implies that their ability to buy assets is limited by their capital at any given time. Impatient borrowers drive the interest rate higher while nervous lenders demand more collateral, a borrower's willingness to pay a higher interest to ease the concerns of the nervous lender may not necessarily satisfy the lender. Before the financial crisis of 2008 hit, lenders were less nervous. As a result, they were willing to make subprime mortgage loans. Consider an individual who took out a subprime mortgage loan paying a high interest relative to a prime mortgage loan and putting up only 5% collateral, a leverage of 20. During the crisis, lenders become more nervous. As a result, they demand 20% as collateral, even though there is sufficient liquidity in the system. The individual who took out a subprime loan is probably not in a position to buy a house now, regardless of how low the interest rates are. Therefore, in addition to interest rates, collateral requirements should also be taken into consideration in determining the demand and supply of loans. How does leverage affect the financial markets? Consider a simple world where there are two types of investors ‚Äì Individuals and Arbitrageurs. Individual investors have limited investment opportunities in terms of relatively limited access to capital and limited information while sophisticated ‚Äúarbitrageurs ‚Äú (e.g.: dealers, hedge funds, investment banks) have access to better investment opportunities over individual investors due to greater access to capital and better information. Arbitrage opportunities are created when there are differences in asset prices. Individual investors are not able to take advantage of these arbitrage opportunities but arbitrageurs can, due to better information and greater access to capital. Leverage allows arbitrageurs to take on significantly more positions. However, due to margin requirements, even arbitrageurs may potentially face financial constraints and may not be able to completely eliminate the arbitrage opportunities.Gromb, D., and D. Vayanos. 2002. Equilibrium and Welfare in Markets with Financially Constrained Arbitrageurs. Journal of Financial Economics 14:71-100 It is important to note that the arbitrageur's access to external capital is not only limited but also depends on their wealth. An arbitrageur who is financially constrained, in other words, has exhausted his ability to borrow externally, becomes vulnerable in an economic downturn. In the event of a bad news, the value of the asset falls along with the wealth of the arbitrageur. The leveraged arbitrageurs then face margin calls and are forced to sell assets to meet their respective margin requirements. The flood of asset sales further leads to a loss in asset value and wealth of the arbitrageurs. The increased volatility and uncertainty can then lead to tightening margin requirements causing further forced sales of assets. The resulting change in margins mean that leverage falls. Hence, price falls more than they otherwise would due to the existence of leverage. Therefore, due to the leverage cycle (over-leveraging in good times and de-leveraging in bad times) there exists a situation that can lead to a crash before or even when there is no crash in the fundamentals.Geanakoplos, J. (2010). The Leverage Cycle. Cowles Foundation This was true in the quant hedge fund crisis in August 2007, where hedge funds hit their capital constraints and had to reduce their positions, at which point prices were driven more by liquidity considerations rather than movement in the fundamentals.Brunnermeier, M. Pedersen, L 2009. Market Liquidity and Funding Liquidity. The Review of Financial Studies v 22 n 6 2009 In the financial crisis of 1998, many hedge funds that were engaged in arbitrage strategies experienced heavy losses and had to scale down their positions. The resulting price movements accentuated the losses and triggered further liquidations. Moreover, there was contagion, in that price movements in some markets induced price movements in others. These events raised concerns about market disruption and systemic risk, and prompted the Federal Reserve to coordinate the rescue of Long Term Capital Management.  Consequences of the leverage cycle A very highly leveraged economy means that a few investors have borrowed a lot of cash from all the lenders in the economy. A higher leverage implies fewer investors and more lenders. Therefore, asset prices in such an economy will be set by only a small group of investors. According to Tobin's Q,Tobin, J. and Golub, S. (1998). Money, Credit, and Capital. Irwin/McGraw-Hill asset prices can affect economic activity. When prices of assets are high, new productive activity can be stimulated that can lead to over production. Alternatively, when asset prices crash, production may come to a standstill. Therefore, the leverage cycle has the potential to amplify real economic activity. When financially constrained arbitrageurs receive a bad shock, they are forced to shift to low volatility ‚Äì low margin assets from high volatility - high margin assets, thereby increasing the liquidity risk of already illiquid (risky) assets. This can be categorized as a ‚Äúflight to quality‚Äù. Broadly speaking market-making arbitrageurs can hold net long positions and as a result capital constraints are more likely to be hit during market downturns. This is likely to result in a sell-off making the markets more illiquid. Large fluctuations in asset prices in the leverage cycle lead to a huge redistribution of wealth and change in inequality. During a good shock, all optimists become extremely rich relative to lenders thanks to their highly leveraged position while during a bad shock, the optimists are wiped out and the relatively optimistic lenders become rich in the subsequent good shocks. Highly leveraged agents can potentially become indispensable to the economy if the failure of an extremely leveraged agent increases the likelihood that other leveraged agents will have to follow suit. In other words, high levels of leverage can potentially lead to the ‚Äútoo big to fail‚Äù problem. Leverage cycle (2007-2009) The leverage cycle crisis of 2007-2009 was particularly significant for a number of reasons. The first and most obvious being that leverage got higher than ever before, and then margins got tighter than ever before. The subprime losses in 2007-2008 were in the order of several hundred billion dollars, corresponding to only about 5% of overall stock market capitalization. However, since they were primarily borne by levered financial institutions, spiral effects amplified the crisis so the stock market losses amounted to more than 8 trillion dollars.Brunnermeier, M.K. 2009. Deciphering the Liquidity and Credit Crunch 2007-08. Journal of Economic Perpspectives. 2009, Issue 1 Credit default swaps (CDS) also played a significant role in the run up to the crisis. The buyer of a CDS is entitled to the principal of the bond in the case of default. A key characteristic of a CDS is that the buyer does not have to hold a bond in order to purchase a CDS. As a result, this financial instrument allowed pessimists to drive asset prices very low. Standardization of CDS facilitated large quantities of trades. Also during this crisis, a number of real estate properties went ‚Äúunder water‚Äù, in other words, the promise to repay exceeded the value of the collateral. Welfare implication The highly leveraged arbitrageurs are only concerned about maximizing their own objectives (e.g.: profits) and do not take into consideration the effect their decisions have on asset prices. However, asset prices determine other arbitrageurs‚Äô wealth, and through the financial constraints, arbitrageurs‚Äô ability to invest. As a result, the arbitrageurs‚Äô decisions involve externalities and may not be socially optimal. When arbitrageurs are not financially constrained (their borrowing needs do not exceed the maximum amount they can borrow given their wealth) then they are able to eliminate all arbitrage opportunities. As a result, they perform a socially useful task of reallocating risk by buying risky assets from investors whose valuation is low and selling them to those whose valuation is high. Thus the roles of arbitrageurs are socially optimal when there are no financial constraints. When there are financial constraints, arbitrageurs may not able to make the socially optimal trades and hence social optimality fails. Policy implication A financially constrained firm may need to sell assets substantially below fundamental value due to margin requirements in an industry downturn. This is because the buyers with the highest valuation for the assets are other firms in the same industry who are also likely to be financially constrained and in need of selling assets.Shleifer, A. and Vishny, R. (1992). Liquidation Values and Debt Capacity: A Market Equilibrium Approach. The Journal of Finance, Vol XLVII, No. 4 During a liquidity crisis, central banks should pursue monetary expansions by increasing liquidity. The results will be most effective when investors are near their financial constraint. If the central bank is better than the market at distinguishing liquidity shocks from fundamental shocks, then the central bank should convey this information to lenders and urge them to relax their funding requirements. Therefore, In order to reduce business cycles the Federal Reserve should manage system wide leverage, limiting leverage in good times and encouraging higher levels of leverage during times of uncertainty, by extending lending facilities.Ashcraft, A., Garleanu, N. and Pedersen, L.

It is contrasted with the term Yesh (\\"something/exist/being/is\\"). According to kabbalistic teachings, before the universe was created there was only Ayin, and the first manifest Sephirah (Divine emanation), Chochmah (Wisdom), \\"comes into being out of Ayin.\\" In this context, the sephirah Keter, the Divine will, is the intermediary between the Divine Infinity (Ein Sof) and Chochmah. Because Keter is a supreme revelation of the Ohr Ein Sof (Infinite Light), transcending the manifest sephirot, it is sometimes excluded from them. Ayin is closely associated with the Ein Sof (Hebrew ◊ê◊ô◊ü ◊°◊ï◊£, meaning \\"no end\\", \\"without an end\\" ), which is understood as the Deity prior to His self-manifestation in the creation of the spiritual and physical realms, single Infinite unity beyond any description or limitation. From the perspective of the emanated created realms, Creation takes place \\"Yesh me-Ayin\\" (\\"Something from Nothing\\"). From the Divine perspective, Creation takes place \\"Ayin me-Yesh\\" (\\"Nothing from Something\\"), as only God has absolute existence; Creation is dependent on the continuous flow of Divine lifeforce, without which it would revert to nothingness. Since the 13th century, Ayin has been one of the most important words used in kabbalistic texts. The symbolism associated with the word Ayin was greatly emphasized by Moses de Le√≥n (c. 1250 ‚Äì 1305), a Spanish rabbi and kabbalist, through the Zohar, the foundational work of Kabbalah. In Hasidism Ayin relates to the internal psychological experience of Deveikut (\\"cleaving\\" to God amidst physicality), and the contemplative perception of paradoxical Yesh-Ayin Divine Panentheism, \\"There is no place empty of Him\\".Tikkunei Zohar 57, made into the central doctrine of Hasidic Divine immanence  History of Ayin-Yesh  Kabbalah, the fourth level of Pardes Jewish exegesis, relating to the Sephirah Chochmah-Wisdom, focuses on the esoteric supernal emanations, defining them through anthropomorphisms and metaphors. Creation is seen as Yesh me-Ayin from \\"below\\" and Ayin me-Yesh from \\"above\\" In his Arabic language work Emunoth ve- Deoth (\\"Beliefs and Opinions\\"), Saadia Gaon, a prominent 9th-century rabbi and the first great Jewish philosopher, argues that \\"the world came into existence out of nothingness\\". This thesis was first translated into Hebrew as \\"yesh me- Ayin\\", meaning \\"something from nothing\\", in the 11th century. Jewish philosophers of the 9th and 10th century adopted the concept of \\"yesh me- Ayin\\", contradicting Greek philosophers and Aristotelian view that the world was created out of primordial matter and/or was eternal. Both Maimonides and the centuries earlier author of the kabbalistic related work Sefer Yetzirah \\"accepted the formulation of Creation, \\"yesh me-Ayin.\\"\\" Chapter 2, Mishnah 6 of the latter includes the sentence: \\"He made His Ayin, Yesh\\". This statement, like most in Jewish religious texts, can be interpreted in different ways: for example, \\"He made that which wasn't into that which is\\", or \\"He turned His nothingness into something.\\" Joseph ben Shalom Ashkenazi, who wrote a commentary on Sefer Yetzirah in the 14th century, and Azriel of Gerona, Azriel ben Menahem, one of the most important kabbalists in the Catalan town of Girona (north of Barcelona) during the 13th century, interpreted the Mishnah's \\"He made His Ayin, Yesh\\" as \\"creation of \\"yesh me-Ayin.\\"\\" Maimonides and other Jewish philosophers argued a doctrine of \\"negative theology\\", which says there are no words to describe what God is, and we can only describe what \\"God is not\\". Kabbalah accepted this in relation to Ayin, becoming one of the philosophical concepts underlying its significance. However, Kabbalah involves itself with the different, more radical proposition that God becomes known through His emanations of Sephirot, and spiritual Realms, Emanator (\\"Ma'ohr\\") and emanations (\\"Ohr\\") comprising the two aspects of Divinity. For kabbalists, Ayin became the word to describe the most ancient stage of creation and was therefore somewhat paradoxical, as it was not completely compatible with \\"creation from nothing\\". Ayin became for kabbalists a symbol of \\"supreme existence\\" and \\"the mystical secret of being and non-being became united in the profound and powerful symbol of the Ayin\\". There is also a paradoxical relationship between the meaning of Ayin and Yesh from kabbalistic point of view. Rachel Elior, professor of Jewish philosophy and mysticism at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, writes that for kabbalists Ayin (nothingness) \\"clothes itself\\" in Yesh (everything there is) as \\"concealed Torah clothes itself in revealed Torah\\".  Kabbalists on Ayin-Yesh  David ben Abraham ha- Laban, a 14th-century kabbalist, says: Z'ev ben Shimon Halevi says:  Ayin- Yesh in Hasidism  Hasidism related esoteric transcendent Kabbalah to internal perception in the soul, making devotion and Divine immanence of this material world its central values. Different paths explored different aspects of Yesh-Ayin, from contemplative paradox in Habad, existential faith in Breslav, and public embodiment in Mainstream \\"Practical\\" Hasidic charismatic doctrine of Tzadik leadership Hasidic master Dov Ber of Mezeritch says: This reflects the orientation of Hasidism to internalise Kabbalistic descriptions to their psychological correspondence in man, making Deveikut (cleaving to God) central to Judaism. The populist aspect of Hasidism revived common folk through the nearness of God, especially reflected in Hasidic storytelling and the public activity of the Baal Shem Tov, Hasidism's founder. Dov Ber, uncompromising esoteric mystic and organiser of the movement's future leaders, developed the elite aspect of Hasidic meditation reflected in Bittul (annihilation of ego) in the Divine Ayin Nothingness. Schneur Zalman of Liadi, one of Dov Ber's inner circle of followers, developed Hasidic thought into an intellectual philosophical system that related the Kabbalistic scheme to its interpretation in the Hasidic doctrine of Panentheism. The Habad follower contemplates the Hasidic interpretation of Kabbalistic structures, including the concept of Ayin, during prolonged prayer. Where Kabbalah is concerned with categorising the Heavenly realms using anthropomorphic terminology, these texts of Hasidic philosophy seek to perceive the Divinity within the structures, by relating to their correspondence in man using analogies from man's experience. Rachel Elior termed her academic study of Habad intellectual contemplation \\"the Paradoxical ascent to God\\", as it describes the dialectical paradox of Yesh-Ayin of Creation. In the second section of his magnum opus Tanya, Schneur Zalman explains the Monistic illusionary Ayin nullification of Created Existence from the Divine perspective of \\"Upper Unity\\". The human perspective in contemplation sees Creation as real Yesh existence, though completely nullified to its continuous vitalising Divine lifeforce, the perception of \\"Lower Unity\\". In another text of Schneur Zalman: Here, the Lower Unity perspective is ultimately false, arising out of illusionary concealment of Divinity. In Schneur Zalman's explanation, Hasidism interprets the Kabbalistic Lurianic doctrine of Tzimtzum (apparent \\"Withdrawal\\" of God to allow Creation to take place) as only an illusionary concealment of the Ohr Ein Sof. In truth, the Ein Sof and the Ohr Ein Sof still fills all Creation, without any change at all from God's perspective. = Atzmus-Essence resolving the Ayin-Yesh paradox of Creation = Sinai began the union of descending Ayin spirituality and ascending Yesh physicality through the higher Divinity of Atzmut essence, equally beyond Finite-Infinite duality, reflected in the innermost Divine Will of the Mitzvot. This will be completed in this World's future Divine \\"dwelling place\\" In Habad systemisation of Hasidic thought, the term Ein Sof (\\"Unlimited\\" Infinite) itself does not capture the very essence of God. Instead it uses the term Atzmus (the Divine \\"Essence\\"). The Ein Sof, while beyond all differentiation or limitation, is restricted to Infinite expression. The true Divine essence is above even Infinite-Finite relationship. God's essence can be equally manifest in finitude as in infinitude, as found in the Talmudic statement that the Ark of the Covenant in the First Temple took up no space. While it measured its own normal width and length, the measurements from each side to the walls of the Holy of Holies together totalled the full width and length of the sanctuary. Atzmus represents the core Divine essence itself, as it relates to the ultimate purpose of Creation in Hasidic thought that \\"God desired a dwelling place in the lower Realms\\",Schneur Zalman of Liadi Tanya I:36, further explained in later Habad thought (see Atzmut), defines this as the ultimate reason for Creation, taking the statement from Rabbinic Midrash Tanchuma: Nasso 16 which will be fulfilled in this physical, finite, lowest world, through performance of the Jewish observances. This gives the Hasidic explanation why Nachmanides and the Kabbalists ruled that the final eschatological era will be in this World, against Maimonides's view that it will be in Heaven, in accordance with his philosophical view of the elevation of intellect over materiality in relating to God. In Kabbalah, the superiority of this world is to enable the revelation of the complete Divine emanations, for the benefit of Creation, as God Himself lacks no perfection. For example, the ultimate expression of the sephirah of Kindness is most fully revealed when it relates to our lowest, physical World. However, the Hasidic interpretation sees the Kabbalistic explanations as not the ultimate reason, as, like Kabbalah in general, it relates to the Heavenly realms, which are not the ultimate purpose of Creation. The revelation of Divinity in the Heavenly realms is supreme, and superior to the present concealment of God in this World. However, it is still only a limited manifestation of Divinity, the revelation of the Sephirot attributes of God's Wisdom, Understanding, Kindness, Might, Harmony, Glory and so forth, while God's Infinite Ein Sof and Ohr Ein Sof transcend all Worlds beyond reach. In contrast, the physical performance of the Mitzvot in this world, instead relate to, and ultimately will reveal, the Divine essence. In Hasidic terminology, the separate realms of physicality and spirituality are united through their higher source in the Divine essence. In the Biblical account, God descended on Mount Sinai to speak to the Israelites \\"Anochi Hashem Elokecha\\" (\\"I am God your Lord\\").Exodus 20:2. In this verse the names of God are translated opposite to their usual form (\\"I am the Lord your God\\"), as in Kabbalah the Tetragrammaton describes Divine Infinitude (\\"God\\", the Ein Sof power of Creation through the Sephirah Keter-Supreme Will, combining the words \\"was\\",\\"is\\" and \\"will be\\" in one name), while Elokim describes God's concealing limitation to allow His lifeforce to immanently form the finite Worlds (becoming \\"Lord\\", the master relating to this world through the last sephirah Malkuth-Kingship, numerically equivalent to \\"HaTevah\\"-\\"Nature\\") This is explained in Hasidic thought to describe Atzmus, the Divine essence (Anochi-\\"I\\"), uniting the separate Kabbalistic manifestation realms of spirituality (Hashem-The Tetragrammaton name of Infinite transcendent emanation) and physicality (Elokecha-The name of God relating to finite immanent lifeforce of Creation). Before the Torah was given, physical objects could not become sanctified. The commandments of Jewish observance, stemmining from the ultimate Divine purpose of Creation in Atzmus, enabled physical objects to be used for spiritual purposes, uniting the two realms and embodying Atzmus. In this ultimate theology, through Jewish observance, man converts the illusionary Ayin-nothingness \\"Upper Unity\\" nullification of Creation into revealing its ultimate expression as the ultimate true Divine Yesh-existence of Atzmus. Indeed, this gives the inner reason in Hasidic thought why this world falsely perceives itself to exist, independent of Divinity, due to the concealment of the vitalising Divine lifeforce in this world. As this world is the ultimate purpose and realm of Atzmus, the true Divine Yesh-existence, so externally it perceives its own Created material Yesh-existence ego. In Habad systemisation of Hasidic philosophy, God's Atzmut-essence relates to the 5th Yechidah Kabbalistic Etzem-essence level of the soul, the innermost Etzem-essence root of the Divine Will in Keter, and the 5th Yechidah Etzem-essence level of the Torah, the soul of the 4 Pardes levels of Torah interpretation, expressed in the essence of Hasidic thought.On the Essence of Chasidus by Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, Kehot publications Bilingual Hebrew-English edition In the Sephirot, Keter, the transcendent Divine Will, becomes revealed and actualised in Creation through the first manifest Sephirah Chochmah-Wisdom. Similarly, the essential Hasidic purpose-Will of Creation, a \\"dwelling place for God's Atzmus-essence in the lowest world\\", becomes actualised through the process of elevating the sparks of holiness embedded in material objects, through using them for Jewish observances, the Lurianic scheme in Kabbalah-Wisdom. Once all the fallen sparks of holiness are redeemed, the Messianic Era begins. In Hasidic explanation, through completing this esoteric Kabbalah-Wisdom process, thereby the more sublime ultimate Divine purpose-Will is achieved, revealing this World to be the Atzmus \\"dwelling place\\" of God. In Kabbalah, the Torah is the Divine blueprint of Creation: \\"God looked into the Torah and created the World\\".Midrash Genesis Rabbah I:1, ZoharI:5a The Sephirah Keter is the Supreme Will underlying this blueprint, the source of origin of the Torah. According to Hasidic thought, \\"the Torah derives from Chochmah-Wisdom, but its source and root surpasses exceedingly the level of Chochmah, and is called the Supreme Will\\".Tanya IV:1 This means that according to Hasidic thought, Torah is an expression of Divine Reason. Reason is focused towards achieving a certain goal. However, the very purpose of achieving that goal transcends and permeates the rational faculty. Once reason achieves the goal, the higher innermost essential will's delight is fulfilled, the revelation of Atzmus in this World. Accordingly, Hasidic thought says that then this World will give life to the spiritual Worlds, and the human body will give life to the soul. The Yesh of ego will be nullified in the Divine Ayin, becoming the reflection of the true Divine Yesh. = Atzmus in the eschatological future = The resolution of the Ayin-Yesh paradox of Creation through Atzmus is beyond present understanding, as it unites the Finite-Infinite paradox of Divinity. This is represented in the paradox of the Lurianic Tzimtzum, interpreted non- literally in Hasidic Panentheism. God remains within the apparent \\"vacated\\" space of Creation, just as before, as \\"I the Eternal, I have not changed\\" (Malachi 3:6), the Infinite \\"Upper Unity\\" that nullifies Creation into Ayin- nothingness. Creation, while dependent on continual creative lifeforce, perceives its own Yesh-existence, the Finite \\"Lower Unity\\". The absolute unity of Atzmus, the ultimate expression of Judaism's Monotheism, unites the two opposites. Maimonides codifies the Messianic Era and the physical Resurrection of the Dead as the traditionally accepted last two Jewish principles of faith, with Kabbalah ruling the Resurrection to be the final, permanent eschatology. Presently, the supernal Heavenly realms perceive the immanent Divine creative Light of Mimalei Kol Olmim (\\"Filling all Worlds\\"), according to their innumerably varied descending levels. In the Messianic Era, this world will perceive the transcendent Light of Sovev Kol Olmim (\\"Encompassing all Worlds\\"). In the Era of the Resurrection, generated through preceding Jewish observance \\"from below\\", the true presence of Atzmus will be revealed in finite physical Creation. A foretaste of this was temporarily experienced at Mount Sinai, when the whole Nation of Israel heard the Divine pronouncement, while remaining in physicality. As this was imposed \\"from above\\" by God, the Midrash says that God revived their souls from expiring with the future \\"Dew of the Resurrection\\".  The concept of Ayin-Yesh in literature and science  In his autobiographical trilogy Love and Exile, Isaac Bashevis Singer, an American-Jewish writer and a Nobel Prize laureate, remembers how he studied Kabbalah and tried to comprehend how could have it been that he Scientific theories of the Big Bang and ideas about the Universe being created out of nothingness resembles those expressed in Kabbalah. \\"One reads Stephen Hawking's Brief History of Time, perhaps a sign of things to come, and the affinities with Kabbalah are striking.\\" Kenneth Hanson sees similarity in the Kabbalistic idea that Hebrew letters were the material of which the Universe was built and Stephen Hawking's explanation why Albert Einstein's Theory of relativity will break down at some point that he called the \\"singularity\\". Hanson says that although Hebrew letters have shapes they are actually made out of nothing, as well as the singularity of the Big Bang. Hanson also argues that the singularity of Black holes could be compared to Kabbalistic \\"spheres of nothing\\", as it was written in an early Kabbalistic text Sefer Yetzirah: \\"For that which is light is not-darkness, and that which is darkness is not- light.\\" In their book The Grand Design physicists Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow argue that there was nothing before the Beginning, and explain it by comparing the Beginning to South Pole. They say: \\"there is nothing south of the South Pole\\", and there was nothing before the Beginning.

Pirsig, LLD, (/Ààp…úÀêrs…™…°/; January 9, 1902 - February 7, 1997) was an American legal scholar. He was director of the Minnesota Legal Aid Society, dean of the University of Minnesota Law School, a Minnesota Supreme Court justice, and an advisor for the Indonesian, Puerto Rican, and El Salvadoran legal systems. He defined legal ethics in the 1974 Encyclopedia Britannica. His law books were widely used in schools across the country, and his book Judicial Administration was the first casebook on the field of judicial administration in the US. He was mentored by Everett Fraser, Roscoe Pound, and Felix Frankfurter. Pirsig wrote in his book, Cases and Materials on Legal Ethics, 1949, \\"The lawyer's duty is of a double character. He owes to his client the duty of fidelity, but he also owes the duty of good faith and honorable dealing to judicial tribunals before whom he practices his profession. He is an officer of the courta minister in the temple of justice.\\" He was a champion of civil rights, the Equal Rights Amendment, abolishment of the death penalty (\\"an imperfect system should not be lethal\\"), Planned Parenthood, a separate juvenile court system, rehabilitation programs for prison inmates, and fair access to the law regardless of income. Robert A. Stein described Pirsig as \\"an unpretentious man concerned about the welfare of others\\".  Early life and education  Pirsig was born in 1902 in Kossuth County, Iowa, near Elmore, Minnesota, to Gustav and Amelia Pirsig. He was raised on his parents' farm, speaking only German until he began attending school. Pirsig earned a bachelor's degree in 1923 from the University of Minnesota, and an LL.B degree in 1925 from the University of Minnesota Law School.  University of Minnesota Law School 1929-1970  Pirsig joined the university's Law School faculty 1929. Soon, under the guidance by Dean Everett Fraser, he attended graduate courses in law at Harvard University from 1931‚Äì1932, studying under Roscoe Pound and Felix Frankfurter. During 1932‚Äì1933, on a UMLS scholarship implemented by Pound and Frankfurter, as preparation for developing a course in judicial administration, Pirsig spent one year in England with his wife Harriet and son Robert, studying at the Middle Temple. Upon returning to the University of Minnesota, he started teaching his course in judicial administration in 1934. A course that strove to encompass all subjects - from justice and precedence, to trial techniques and the organization of the courts - pertinent to developing well rounded lawyers. Pirsig's research and teaching led to the publication of a book in 1946, Cases and Materials on Judicial Administration, which he taught throughout his career. Judicial Administration gave birth to a new subject in the field of law. Charles W. Wolfram described Pirsig's teaching as aiming to produce \\"students... equipped with a challenging attitude, a reformer's zeal for ideal solutions, and a full arsenal of possibilities for innovations (who) would continue to confront the judicial system with challenges to ever more humane conduct that alone will guarantee it's continuing legitimacy\\". George K. Gardner said of the book: \\"Here are a thousand pages on the purpose and problems of our profession which will repay thoughtful study by any student, teacher, or practitioner of the law.\\" He also taught courses on pleading, ethics and criminal law. When he was Dean of the Law School, 1948 - 1955, Pirsig recruited ten new faculty members. Most were, or became, pillars in the world of legal scholarship, including Charles Alan Wright, Michael I. Sovern, David Louisell, Jesse Dukeminier, and librarian Leon Liddell. Pirsig managed an expansion of the school, including the library. He developed a training program at the law school, for professionals in delinquency control which trained police and judges on how to utilize the American Juvenile Justice System - a system Pirsig had been instrumental in introducing to the state. He managed a difficult period of post-war transition and growth at UMLS, however, according to Robert A. Stein, \\"traditions of excellence were maintained and the foundation was laid for more productive future years\\". Pirsig resigned his position as Dean in 1955, and returned to teaching full-time. Professor Pirsig retired from the University of Minnesota Law School due to its mandatory retirement age, then 68. Honors bestowed upon him by the University included: ‚Ä¢ Recipient of the University of Minnesota Outstanding Achievement Award, 1985. ‚Ä¢ Mondale Hall houses the Maynard E. Pirsig Lecture Hall, which includes an oil painting of Maynard. ‚Ä¢ Maynard Pirsig Moot Court: click here ‚Ä¢ Pirsig's Will contained a gift to UMLS to teach his Judicial Administration course again, which they did.  Mitchell Hamline School of Law 1970-1993  After his mandatory retirement from UMLS, Mitchell Hamline School of Law immediately hired Pirsig to their faculty. Then 68, Pirsig requested that he not be tenured, so he could be easily released from his position if required‚Äîhe taught until age 91. Here, he taught Criminal Law, Criminal Procedure, Professional Responsibility, and Comparative Judicial Administration. Drawing from his early experience in London, Pirsig helped to develop and teach Comparative Judicial Administration for William Mitchell College of Law's (now Mitchell Hamline School of Law) \\"Summer in London\\" program, with Professor Robert E. Oliphant and Professor Eric S. Janus of William Mitchell. Maynard taught the course in London and Saint Paul, from 1988 - 1991. The course was taught in London, at Regent's University, together with, Michael Zander. Maynard Pirsig and Randall Tietjen co-authored the article Court Procedure and the Separation of Powers in Minnesota, published in Vol. 15 of the William Mitchell Law Review in 1989. Mitchell Hamline bestowed an honorary L.L.D. doctorate degree upon Pirsig, 1981. Pirsig made a donation for the construction of the Warren E. Burger Law Library, housing the Maynard E. Pirsig Study Hall, which contains a vitrine displaying his legal and personal memorabilia‚Äîincluding his 1946 U of M lectures recorded onto SoundScriber vinyl discs.  Minnesota Supreme Court  At the age of 40, Pirsig served as an interim justice on the Minnesota Supreme Court. He was appointed by Governor Harold Stassen. Pirsig served for only a few months, but wrote more than a dozen opinions, several of which later became important legal precedents. A summary of opinions written by Maynard E.

History  The Lagonda Club originated in Springfield, Ohio U.S.A. in the late 19th century and continued to the early 20th century, as an exclusive club for local prominent and corporate men. Its name was derived from Lagonda (an early American settlement near Springfield) and the Lagonda Creek, where on its banks the town of Springfield was settled. \\"Lagonda\\" was a Shawnee Indian term meaning buck's horn and some point the creek was renamed Buck Creek. Origin of the club started in May 1886. At that time, under the leadership of Rev. George W. Ziegler of the Wiley Chapel M.E. Church, he organized with church members 14 civic clubs. These clubs, called the Wiley's Chapel Clubs, were formed for the purpose of liquidating the church indebtness. One of them was the Wesley Lagonda Club with J. O. Underwood as president. Shortly after the name was shorten to Lagonda Club.3  Meeting place  When the Lagonda Club (an exclusive social club of prominent and business men) was incorporated it purchased what was known as the Cavalier corner‚ÄîHigh and Spring streets to build their clubhouse in mind as social haven rather than the literary opportunities. The Lagonda Club Building was designed in 1893 by Frank Mills Andrews, a leading period architect who also designed the Kentucky State Capitol and the Montana State Capitol. Completed by 1895 at expense of $25,000.,1 the Lagonda Club Building is an early example of Beaux-Arts architecture. The club‚Äôs main reception hall was executed in manly fashion in the Empire style. The clubhouse, a four-story structure with a large basement, built of limestone and brick with stone molding. In October, 1904, the Lagonda Club building was more open to the members of the public and while it is not denominated a \\"poor man's club,\\" there was a democratic spirit that pervaded. It afforded facilities for both dances and banquets, a social center rather than an intellectual center and yet in its reading rooms copies of Springfield and metropolitan publications are available. It had rooms for indoor sports and the wives of members enjoy the social privileges. While it has both resident and non-resident members, in order to share its advantages members had to own stock in the organization. Since many of the members belonged to other civic organizations, the Lagonda Club became more of a community center.1 = Founding Member List = Some earliest members were: * J. O.

The novel is set in an indeterminate period of a Yoruba kingdom. This reworking of Oedipus Rex was part of the African Arts (Arts d'Afrique) playwriting contest in 1969. Rotimi's play has been celebrated on two counts: at first scintillating as theatre and later accruing a significant literary aura.Barbara Goff and Michael Simpson, Crossroads in the Black Aegean: Oedipus, Antigone, and dramas of the African diaspora, Oxford University Press, United States, 2007 This article focuses specifically on the 1968 play. Characters Odewale: The king of Kutuje, who had risen to power by unknowingly murdering the old king, King Adetusa, whom, also not to his knowledge, was his father. The manner in which he kills his father is revealed in a flashback when his childhood friend, Alaka, comes to Kutuje to ask him why he was not in the village of Ede as he said he would be when he departed at age thirteen. Similar in nature to the Greek play, Oedipus Tyrannus his royal parents receive a prophecy from Baba Fakunle that Odewale would grow up to kill them both. To prevent this from occurring, King Adetusa orders for Odewale to be killed. Instead, he is wrapped in a white cloth (symbolizing death) and left in a bush far from Kutuje. He is found and picked up by a farmer hunter Ogundele and raised by him along with his wife Mobe. Odewale is confronted by Gbonka, a messenger, who tells of the event that lead to King Adetusa's end. Along with the Ogun Priest, it is revealed to him that the old king was his father, and that Ojuola was his mother. Ojuola: Wife of the late King Adetusa. Current wife of King Odewale. She is the mother of six children: two under King Adetusa (Odewale and Aderepo), and four under King Odewale (Adewale, Adebisi, Oyeyemi, Adeyinka). She was given a prophecy, along with King Adetusa, that their child, Odewale, would one day grow up to usurp the thrown, killing his father and marry his mother. As the queen of the kingdom of Kutuje, she finds herself serving as Odewale's conscience, calming him when he begins to act irrationally. When it is revealed by the Ogun Priest that Ojuola is, in fact, Odewale's mother, she goes to her bedroom and kills herself. Aderopo: Brother of Odewale, and son of King Adetusa and Ojuola. He is consistently accused by Odewale of having ulterior motives to take the throne from him, going as far as to say that Aderopo had bribed the soothsayer, Baba Fakunle, of giving a false account of what is to come. Aderopo is also accused of spreading the rumor that Odewale was the one who murdered the old king, Adetusa. King Adetusa: Former king of Kutuje. Despite his best efforts to curb the prophecy that his child, Odewale, would grow up to take the throne by murdering him, he is inevitably slain when he encounters his son, now fully grown, in the village of Ede. Baba Fakunle: A blind, old man, Baba Fakunle serves as a soothsayer to those who seek him. He is summoned by Odewale to ask of a way to rid the suffering of his kingdom. Baba Fakunle tells him that the source of the kingdom's ails lay with him. After a dispute, Baba Fakunle calls Odewale a \\"murderer,\\" alluding to the assault that occurred on the yam patch in Ede, in which Odewale kills King Adetusa, unknowingly his father. Alaka: Odewale's childhood friend. Alaka hails from the village of Ishokun. He comes to Kutuje to tell Odewale that the man he called father had passed two years prior and that his mother, though old, was still in good health. It is during the course of the play that Odewale reveals to Alaka why it was that he left the village of Ede, where Odewale said he would live after leaving Ishokun when he was thirteen. Gbonka: The former messenger of the late King Adetusa. Gbonka was present when King Adetusa was slain at the hands of Odewale. Near the play's end, Gbonka retells this event to Odewale, which leads to the discovery that Odewale was in fact the son of the former king, and the son of the current queen, and his birth mother, Ojuola. Plot Number of Acts and Scenes The play consists of three acts and ten scenes as follows; Act 1 : 2 scenes Act 2 : 4 scenes Act 3 : 4 scenes =Prologue= Ola Rotimi's The Gods Are Not To Blame is the series of unfortunate events that occur in King Odewale's life. Rotimi seals Odewale's fate by having an omen placed over his life at birth. Odewale's horrible fate, whether it had been the Seer being silent, or even his parents not ordering his death. =Act I= Odewale storms Kutuje with his chiefs flanking by his side, and is declared King by the town's first chief. The King expresses sympathy to the townspeople for the illness that has been plaguing them. He brings his sick children for the town to see, that way they know that his family is also suffering. Aderopo gives good news to Odewale from Orunmila concerning the sickness going around the kingdom, but along with the good news comes the bad. Odewale learns that there is a curse on the land, and in order for the sickness to stop going around the curse has to be purged. Odewale finds out that the man who is cursed killed King Adetusa I. =Act II= The village elders gather round to discuss the allegations that have been made against Odewale. A blind soothsayer, Baba Fakunle, is brought in to share with Odewale the murderer of the old king. Odewale begins to make accusations of a plot being made against him, spearheaded by Aderopo, to one of the village chiefs in response to Baba Fakunle's silence. Aderopo arrives and is immediately confronted by Odewale about his suspicions. Aderopo denies the allegations, and Odewale calls forth the Priest of Ogun. Odewale banishes Aderopo from the kingdom. =Act III= As the play comes to a close, King Odewale and the townspeople are still trying to figure out the curse on the village. At this point we are introduced to Alaka, who claims to have known King Odewale since before he came to conquer Kutuje. Odewale confesses that his life spiraled out of control when he killed a man. Later, Ojuola explains that Baba Fakunle made her kill her first born son, convinced that her first son had brought bad luck. Odewale says to the land that the biggest trouble today is not their sickness but instead the plague in their hearts. In the last part Odewale leaves. Odewale brings real facts to the people of the land. Odewale closes the play by stating, ‚Ä≥the gods have lied‚Ä≥ Nathaniel. Theme and motifs African symbolism In The God‚Äôs Are Not To Blame, Rotimi incorporates many themes, such as culture and its connection with the form of the social structure of an African community. The culture represents \\"the way of life for an entire society\\", as noted in Pragmatic Functions of Crisis ‚Äì Motivated Proverbs in Ola Rotimi's The Gods Are Not to Blame. All the messages conveyed, although bring the play together and provide the audience with insightful readings, the play may also serve as a symbol as to how some of the African societies model the structure presented in the play. The practices exhibited in Yoruban culture show the structure of both a social and economical factors. The leadership in the play forms a comparison to that of the King and many of the townspeople. One finds that their roles compared to King Odewale's serve as a primary example of the social aspect. In the economic structure, one observes the resources the Yoruban culture considers vital to maintain wellness and health. During their time of sickness, the townspeople solely depend on the herbs used as an attempt to cure the \\"curse\\" put on the people. Yoruba culture and influences The gods Are Not to Blame is influenced by Yoruba and Yoruban culture. Ola Rotimi had an immense knowledge and interest in African cultures, as indicated in his ability to speak several ethnic languages, such as Yoruba, Ijaw, Hausa, and pidgin.Akefor, Chinyere. \\"Ola Rotimi: The Man, The Playwright, and the Producer on the Nigerian Theater Scene\\", World Literature Today 64.1 (1990): 24-29. Print. In his work, Rotimi took traditional Yoruban myths, songs, and other traditional African elements, and applied it to the Greek tragedy structure. The comical character Alaka, for example, represents Odewale's childhood growing up in the village of Ishokun. Ishokun, in the play, is a small farming village, wherein Odewale learned to harvest yams. By juxtaposing Alaka in Odewale's new environment, Kutuje, Rotimi illustrates the cultural differences between traditional Yoruban life, with that of the industrialized west. Rotimi, in response to the Nigerian Civil War, says that the root cause of the strife among Nigerians, of the bloodshed, was in their lingering mutual ethnic distrust which culminate in open hostility.Barbara, Goff. \\"Back to the Motherland: Ola Rotimi's The Gods Are Not to Blame\\" , Crossroads in the Black Aegean, Oxford University Press, 2008. 84. Print. He says that in post-colonial Africa, much of the blame over the suffering incurred by native Africans was the result of the colonial powers. To this Rotimi argues that while some of the suffering may have been the result of attempted colonial conquests, the lingering animosity that is felt and dispersed among fellow Nigerians, by fellow Nigerians, cannot be blamed solely on an outside party. He felt that the future of Nigerian culture cannot continue to be blamed forces from the past, much like Odewale would blame the suffering of his people, in his kingdom, on the sins of the old king, Adetusa. =Yoruba theory= The Gods Are Not To Blame reflects critically on perhaps the most cherished myth of cultural transmission that civilization entertains about itself as a means of explaining its own perpetuation. Rotimi's play does so not only by dramatizing this myth with certain ironic instance, but also by juxtaposing this myth with a Yoruba model of cultural transmission. =Colonization= According to Barbara Goff and Michael Simpson, \\"the play as an allegory of colonization and, indeed decolonization\\"Goff, Barbara & Simpson, Michael, ‚ÄúBack to the Motherland: Crossroads In The Black Aegean‚Äù (97). The events concerning colonization in The Gods Are Not To Blame represent politics in African history. When the old man takes over Odewale's land it is a metaphor of colonialism. It's about having power over the land and Odewale no longer has the power because the old man took it from him, which is why he turns a hoe, which is a gardening tool, into a sword. The old man happens to also be his father, though Odewale is not aware of this at the time. His father father does to Odewale what European colonizers did to Africa. Language The use of myths with dances in the play. Akin Odebunmi in Motivated Proverbs In Ola Rotimi's \\"The Gods Are Not To Blame\\" uses myths and dances established in Yoruban culture that helps serve as the basis of the play. Some aspects of the sociocultural and linguistic problems of teaching English to students of one of Nigeria's major language groups\\"Odebunmi, Akin. Pragmatic Functions of Crisis ‚Äì Motivated Proverbs in Ola Rotimi's The Gods Are Not to Blame. Ibadan, January 2008. Retrieved 2008-9-1. \\"Proverbs deal with issues that border on the values, norms, institutions and artifacts of a society across the whole gamut of the people's experiences. Two examples of the way proverbs do this can be cited from the Yoruba culture\\" Odebunmi\\" Language,Culture and Proverbs\\". Simply suggest, the use of language is part of culture. Indeed, culture is the way of life. Scholar Odebunmi says, the concept of this is to understand referring to the actual context of a word said in a play (dialogue) has developed similarities with speech and how it works in culture. In the Yoruban culture, like many others, have symbolic. Odebunmi (2008) then says, language, therefore, expresses the patterns and structures of culture, and consequently influences human thinking, manners and judgement. I believe this scholar is claiming to the idea that proverbs deal with issues in the Yoruban culture.

History =Gauda and Pandua= Gauda was once the \\"capital of the ancient bhukti or political division of Bengal known as Pundravardhana which lay on the eastern extremity of the Gupta Empire.\\" During the rule of the Sena Dynasty, in the 11th-12th century, Gauda was rebuilt and extended as Lakshmanawati (later Lakhnauti), and it became the hub of the Sena empire. Gauda was conquered by Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji in 1205. During the Turko-Afghan period, \\"the city of Lakhnauti or Gauda continued to function initially as their capital but was abandoned in 1342 by the Ilyas Shahi sultans in favour of Pandua because of major disturbances along the river course of the Ganga.\\" \\"Pandua then lay on the banks of the Mahananda, which was the major waterway of the sultanate at the time. However, when the Mahananda too began to veer away from the site of Pandua in the mid-15th century, Gauda was rebuilt and restored to the status of capital city by the Hussain Shahi sultans\\"... With the ascent of Akbar to the Mughal throne at Delhi... the Mughals annexed the ancient region of Gauda in 1576 and created the Diwani of Bengal. The centre of regional power shifted across the Ganga to Rajmahal, , Following the demise of the independent sultanate, the regional importance of the Gauda or Malda region declined irreversibly and the city of Gauda was eventually abandoned. =Malda district= With the advent of the British, their trading and commercial interests focussed on the new cities of Malda and English Bazar. Malda district was formed in 1813 with \\"some portion of outlying areas of Purnia, Dinajpur and Rajshahi districts\\". A separate treasury was established in 1832 and a full-fledged Magistrate and Collector was posted in 1859. Malda district was part of Rajshahi Division till 1876, when it was transferred to Bhagalpur Division, and again transferred in 1905 to Rajshahi Division. With the partition of Bengal in 1947, the Radcliffe Line placed Malda district in India, except the Nawabganj subdivision, which was placed in East Pakistan. Geography Pukhuria is located at . Ratua II CD Block is part of the Tal, one of the three physiographic sub-regions of the district. \\"The Tal region gradually slopes down towards the south-west and merges with the Diara sub-region‚Ä¶ (it) is strewn with innumerable marshes, bils and oxbow lakes.\\" The sub-region largely remains submerged during the monsoons and during the dry season large sections of it turn into mud banks with many shallow marshes scattered around. With hardly any gradient the rivers crawl through the region. The Mahananda River forms the eastern boundary of the CD Block, the Mara Mahandnda River flows through the CD Block and the Kalindri River flows along the southern edges of the CD Block. Ratua II is bounded by Chanchal II CD Block on the north, Itahar CD Block of Uttar Dinajpur district covers a small stretch in the north east, Gazole CD Block and Old Malda CD Block on the east, English Bazar CD Block on the south and Manikchak CD Block and Ratua I CD Block on the west. Ratua II CD Block has an area of 101.29 km2. It has 1 panchayat samity, 8 gram panchayats, 124 gram sansads (village councils), 51 mouzas and 48 inhabited villages. Pukhuria police station serves this block. Headquarters of this CD Block is at Pukhuria. Left bank erosion of the Ganges upstream of the Farakka Barrage has rendered nearly 4.5 lakh people homeless in Manikchak, Kaliachak I, II and III and Ratua blocks over the last three decades of the past century. The worst hit area is between Bhutnidiara and Panchanandapore in Kaliachak II block. According to the Ganga Bhangan Pratirodh Action Nagarik Committee 750 km2 area was lost in 30 years in the Manikchak and Kalichak areas. See also - River bank erosion along the Ganges in Malda and Murshidabad districts Gram panchayats of Ratua II block/ panchayat samiti are: Sripur I, Sripur II, Maharajpur, Sambalpur, Paranpur, Araidanga, Pukhuria and Pirganj. Demographics =Population= As per 2011 Census of India, Ratua II CD Block had a total population of 202,080, all of which were rural. There were 102,962 (51%) males and 99.118 (49%) females. Population below 6 years was 31,373. Scheduled Castes numbered 12,880 (6.37%) and Scheduled Tribes numbered 1,954 (0.97%). Large villages (with 4,000+ population) in Ratua II CD Block were (2011 population in brackets): Laskarpur (4,043), Magura (4,561), Magura Khod (5,844), Barail (7,031), Sambalpur (9,250), Kumarganj (6,131), Raninagar (6,422), Maharajpur (8,978), Rajapur (6,143), Rangamatia (4,858), Shibnagar (8,298), Kadamtali (6,323), Nijgan Paranpur (8,523), Chandpur (6,183), Naoda (5,017), Nij Ganaraidanga (4,765), Betahaek Barna (4,335), Sultanpur (6,778), Koklamari (5,923), Pukhuria (22,550), Nasipur (6,404) and Satmara (5,224).

Decadal Population Growth Rate (%) Note: The CD Block data for 1971-1981, 1981-1991 and 1991-2001 is for both Ratua I & II taken together The decadal growth of population in Ratua II CD Block in 2001-2011 was 25.59%. The decadal growth of population in Ratua PS or Ratua I & II CD Blocks taken together in 1991-2001 was 26.33%. The decadal growth of population in Ratua PS or Ratua I &II; CD Blocks taken together in 1981-91 was 24.14% and in 1971-81 was 23.59%. The decadal growth rate of population in Malda district was as follows: 30.33% in 1951-61, 31.98% in 1961-71, 26.00% in 1971-81, 29.78% in 1981-91, 24.78% in 1991-2001 and 21.22% in 2001-11. The decadal growth rate for West Bengal in 2001-11 was 13.93%. The decadal growth rate for West Bengal was 13.93 in 2001-2011, 17.77% in 1991-2001. 24.73% in 1981-1991 and 23.17% in 1971-1981. Malda district has the second highest decadal population growth rate, for the decade 2001-2011, in West Bengal with a figure of 21.2% which is much higher than the state average (13.8%). Uttar Dinajpur district has the highest decadal growth rate in the state with 23.2%. Decadal growth rate of population is higher than that of neighbouring Murshidabad district, which has the next highest growth rate. Population density in the district has intensified from 162 persons per km2 in 1901 to 881 in 2001 (i.e., around five times), which is highest amongst the districts of North Bengal. However, unlike the densely populated southern regions of West Bengal, urbanisation remains low in Malda district. North Bengal in general, and Malda in particular, has been witness to large scale population movement from other states in India and other districts of West Bengal, as well as from outside the country. The District Human Development Report for Malda notes, \\"Malda district has been a principal recipient of the human migration waves of the 20th century.\\" There are reports of Bangladeshi infiltrators coming through the international border. Only a small portion of the border with Bangladesh has been fenced and it is popularly referred to as a porous border. =Literacy= As per the 2011 census, the total number of literates in Ratua II CD Block was 95,915 (56.19% of the population over 6 years) out of which males numbered 50,738 (58.31% of the male population over 6 years) and females numbered 45,177 (54.03% of the female population over 6 years). The gender disparity (the difference between female and male literacy rates) was 4.28%. See also ‚Äì List of West Bengal districts ranked by literacy rate =Language and religion= In 2001, Bengali was the mother tongue of 88.1% of the population of Malda district followed by Santali (4.5%) Khortha/Khotta (4.4%), Hindi (1.2%), Bhojpuri (0.4%), Telugu (0.3%), Kurukh/ Oraon (0.2%) and Koda/ Kora (0.1%). While the percentage of population reporting Bengali as a mother tongue has increased from 83.6 in 1961 Census to 88.1 in 2001 Census, the percentage of population reporting Santali as mother tongue has decreased from 7.2 in 1961 Census to 4.5 in 2001 Census. Information about mother-tongue is available only at the district level and above. There is a discrepancy in the data for religion in Malda district. According to Table C1: Population by religious community in 2011, Malda district was a Muslim-majority district in 2011, but it did not present any progressive picture from earlier years. The 2011 District Census Handbook: Maldah presents a different progressive picture, which we are presenting below. Incidentally, both are part of the official census operations. According to the 2011 District Census Handbook: Maldah, during 2011 census, majority of the population of the district were Hindus constituting 51.3% of the population and up from 49.3% in 2001, followed by Muslims with 48.0%, down from 49.7% in 2001. The proportion of the Hindu population of the district had a decreasing trend from 56.7% in 1971 to 49.3% in 2001 then the trend took a reverse turn and increased in 2011. On the other hand, the Muslim population has increased from 46.2% in 1961 to 49.7% in 2001 but in 2011 census it shrunk to 48.0%. Only 0.3% population were Christians. As per 2014 District Statistical Handbook: Malda (quoting census figures), in the 2001 census, Muslims numbered 123,342 and formed 76.66% of the population in Ratua II CD Block. Hindus numbered 37,454 and formed 23.28% of the population. Christians numbered 3. Others numbered 105 and formed 0.07% of the population. The Census Commission published another set of data for 2011 census with basic fundamental differences. Those who are interested may view the reference. We are not sure which one is right. It is up to the Census Commission to clarify. Rural poverty As per the Human Development Report for Malda district, published in 2006, the percentage of rural families in BPL category in Ratua II CD Block was 38.4%. Official surveys have found households living in absolute poverty in Malda district to be around 39%. According to the report, \\"An overwhelmingly large segment of the rural workforce depends on agriculture as its main source of livelihood, the extent of landlessness in Malda has traditionally been high because of the high densities of human settlement in the district‚Ä¶ Although land reforms were implemented in Malda district from the time they were launched in other parts of West Bengal, their progress has been uneven across the Malda blocks‚Ä¶ because of the overall paucity of land, the extent of ceiling-surplus land available for redistribution has never been large‚Ä¶ The high levels of rural poverty that exist in nearly all blocks in Malda district closely reflect the livelihood crisis‚Ä¶ \\" Economy =Livelihood= In Ratua II CD Block in 2011, amongst the class of total workers, cultivators numbered 10,792 and formed 17.64%, agricultural labourers numbered 28,954 and formed 47.33%, household industry workers numbered 3,244 and formed 5.30% and other workers numbered 18,179 and formed 29.72%.

He was also responsible for initiating the design and construction of the Place des Victoires, one of modern Paris' most famous landmarks. Early life Fran√ßois d'Aubusson de La Feuillade was born on 21 April 1631 at Courpalay in the √éle-de-France near Paris, fifth and last son of Fran√ßois II, Comte de La Feuillade (ca 1590 to 1632) and Isabeau Brachet de P√©russe. The d'Aubussons were a prominent and well connected family; Pierre d'Aubusson (1423‚Äì1503), was Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller Order and his elder brother Antoine was an advisor to both Charles VII and Louis XI. Fran√ßois' father, the Comte de La Feuillade and his eldest brother Leon (? to 1648) were senior aides to Gaston, Duke of Orl√©ans (1608‚Äì1660), heir to the French throne until the birth of Louis XIV in 1638. He had three other brothers, Georges (1609‚Äì1697), who later became Bishop of Metz, Gabriel-Bratchet (? to 1638) and Paul (1622‚Äì1646). Of his five sisters, Elizabeth (1624‚Äì1704) became Abbess of Sainte-Marie de la R√®gle in 1679 but little is known of the others, who all appear to have become nuns. In April 1667, Artus de Gouffier (1627‚Äì1696), 5th duke of Roannais assigned his titles and property to La Feuillade in return for 400,000 livres and marrying his sister, Charlotte de Gouffier (? ‚Äì 1683).Anselme, & Du Forny p.349 Artus legally remained 'duke' during his lifetime and so Fran√ßois was known as 'leur-dit 6th duke of Roannais' or sometimes 'duke of La Feuillade.' He and Charlotte had three children before her death in 1683; Louis-Joseph-George (1670‚Äì1680), Marie-Theresa (1671‚Äì1692) and Louis d'Aubusson de La Feuillade (1673‚Äì1725). Career Gaston, Duke of Orl√©ans (1608‚Äì1660), patron of the d'Aubusson family; he lost influence after the Fronde des nobles was defeated in 1652 The first half of the 17th century in France was a period of intense civil strife; the 1590 Edict of Nantes ended the French Wars of Religion but continued state persecution caused a series of Huguenot rebellions in the 1620s. This was followed by the 1635‚Äì1659 Franco-Spanish War, accompanied by a struggle for power during the minority of Louis XIV that led to the 1648‚Äì1653 civil wars known as the Fronde. Their impact can be seen in the history of de La Feuillade's immediate family; his father was killed in 1632 at Castelnaudary and three of his brothers died in battle, Leon at Lens in 1648, Gabriel-Brachet at Saint-Omer in 1638 and Paul at Mardyck in 1646.Anselme & Du Forny, p. 347 He began his military career in 1649, as captain in a regiment commanded by the Duke of Orl√©ans; during the 1650‚Äì1653 Fronde des nobles, he and his brother Georges de La Feuillade backed the Court party led by Louis XIV's mother, Anne of Austria and Cardinal Mazarin. He was wounded at the Royalist victory of Rethel in December 1650; the Battle of the Faubourg St Antoine in July 1652 ended the Fronde as a serious military threat, although some like Cond√© changed sides and fought on with the Spanish. The Citadel of Besan√ßon; de la Feuillade personally led an assault against this during the Siege of Besan√ßon in May 1674 The Spanish had taken advantage of the Fronde to recover some of the territory lost after their defeat at Rocroi in 1643 and the Franco-Spanish War now resumed. La Feuillade participated in a number of actions, including Arras in 1654; he was wounded and captured at Valenciennes in 1656, a Spanish victory inflicted on the French by Cond√©. When the war ended with the 1659 Treaty of the Pyrenees, La Feuillade was Governor of Crozet, near the modern Swiss border. He joined the French contingent under Jean de Coligny sent by Louis to support Austria in the 1663‚Äì1664 Austro- Turkish War and fought in the August 1664 victory of Saint Gotthard. In April 1667, Artus de Gouffier (1627‚Äì1696), 5th duke of Roannais assigned his titles and property to La Feuillade in return for the payment of 400,000 livres, as well as marrying his sister and heir, Charlotte de Gouffier (? ‚Äì 1683). Artus de Goufier was a Jansenist, like his close friend writer, mathematician and Catholic theologian Blaise Pascal, who entered a monastery after renouncing his titles. During his lifetime, Fran√ßois was officially known as 'leur-dit 6th duke of Roannais' or 'duke of La Feuillade;' it was not until Artus's death in 1696 that his son Louis d'Aubusson finally became 'Duke of Roannais.'Anselme, & Du Forny p. 349 During the 1667‚Äì1668 War of Devolution with Spain, La Feuillade was in the army under de Rochebaron that captured the towns of Bergues, Veurne and Courtrai/Kortrijk between June and July. When it ended, he was part of a French expeditionary force sent to the Venetian island of Candia or Crete, besieged by the Ottomans since 1648 but it was withdrawn in August 1669 and the island surrendered in September. H√¥tel de La Feuillade, modern-day Appointed Colonel of the Gardes Francaises when the Franco-Dutch War began in 1672, he fought in the Netherlands and various other theatres, including Franche-Comt√© in 1674, when he led an assault during the Siege of Besan√ßon and took Salins-les-Bains on 22 June. He was rewarded by being made Marshal of France in 1675 and military Governor of Dole, regional capital of Franche-Comt√© until it moved to Besan√ßon in 1676. In January 1678 he replaced Vivonne as Viceroy in Messina, Sicily. France had supported the 1674 Messina revolt against their Spanish rulers but by the end of 1677, the pressure on French resources meant Louis decided to withdraw. De La Feuillade was proclaimed the new viceroy with great pomp on 28 February 1678; in reality, he was there to evacuate French troops, which was completed on 13 March. On returning to France, he took these troops to Roussillon, in support of the siege of Puigcerd√†.De P√©rini, Hard√ø p. 215 The 1678-1679 Treaties of Nijmegen ended the Franco-Dutch War and De La Feuillade's military career, although he retained his position as Colonel of the Gardes Francaises. After the death of the duc de Lesdigui√®res in May 1681, he was appointed Governor of the Dauphin√© but apart from this, the rest of his life was devoted to the building of the Place des Victoires. The square was the centre piece of an ambitious building project, including the construction of private residences, among them his own town house, the H√¥tel de La Feuillade; he was ruined by the enormous cost, estimated at over seven million livres and the building work was not completed until after his death in 1696. He died on 19 September 1691 and was buried at Saint-Eustache, one of the cemeteries whose contents were later transferred to the Catacombs of Paris in 1787.Philippe Lefran√ßois, Paris souterrain, coll. Encyclop√©die pittoresque, Les √âditions internationales, 1950, p.59. Legacy His coat of arms; D'or √† la croix ancr√©e de gueules The Place des Victoires; the statue of Louis XIV was installed in 1825 To celebrate the end of the Franco-Dutch War, La Feuillade funded the design and construction of the Place des Victoires, which was completed in 1686 by Jules Hardouin-Mansart, Superintendent of Royal Buildings, responsible for Les Invalides and the Place Vend√¥me. The centre of the square contained a statue of Louis XIV trampling the Triple Alliance, with a much smaller one of La Feuillade himself elsewhere; both were destroyed in 1792 during the French Revolution, the current monument being a replacement installed in 1828. He also resurrected a scheme originally proposed by the 15th century merchant Jacques C≈ìur to make the River Loire navigable from Roanne to its exit point into the Atlantic Ocean) at Saint-Nazaire. Until the advent of railways, goods and supplies were largely transported by water; the scheme would enhance the economy of Roanne, which had been damaged by the expulsion of the Huguenots following the 1685 Edict of Fontainebleau and towns along the route and provide an alternative to export routes along the Scheldt then dominated by the Dutch. In his M√©moires written in the 1720s, Saint-Simon (1675‚Äì1755) dismisses Fran√ßois as someone who gained their status through flattery and subservience. The accuracy of this is hard to assess; Saint-Simon was 16 when Fran√ßois died in 1691 and uniformly hostile to Louis XIV and his supporters, the majority of whom he dismissed as commoners.

According to the Talmud, Joshua ben Hananiah, who had served in the sanctuary Levitical choir, told how the choristers went to the synagogue from the orchestra by the altar,Talmud, Sukkah 53a and so participated in both services. Biblical and contemporary sources mention the following instruments that were used in the ancient Temple: * the Nevel, a 12-stringed harp; * the Kinnor, a lyre with 10 strings; * the Shofar, a hollowed-out ram's horn; * the chatzutzera, or trumpet, made of silver; * the tof or small drum; * the metziltayim, or cymbal; * the paamon or bell; * the halil or big flute. According to the Mishna, the regular Temple orchestra consisted of twelve instruments, and the choir of twelve male singers. A number of additional instruments were known to the ancient Hebrews, though they were not included in the regular orchestra of the Temple: the uggav (small flute), the abbuv (a reed flute or oboe-like instrument). After the destruction of the Temple and the subsequent diaspora of the Jewish people, there was a feeling of great loss among the people. At the time, a consensus developed that all music and singing would be banned; this was codified as a rule by some early Jewish rabbinic authorities. However, the ban on singing and music, although not formally lifted by any council, soon became understood as only a ban outside of religious services. Within the synagogue the custom of singing soon re- emerged. In later years, the practice became to allow singing for feasts celebrating religious life-cycle events such as weddings, and over time the formal ban against singing and performing music lost its force altogether, with the exception of the Yemenite Jews. The Jews of Yemen maintained strict adherence to Talmudic and Maimonidean halakhaMishneh Torah, Hilkoth Ta'niyyoth, Chapter 5, Halakhah 14 (see Touger commentary, footnote 14); Responsa of Maimonides, siman 224 (ed.

Thus Yemenite Jews do not at all recognize song with instruments (that which some villages accompany the songs of their feasts by tin, I don't know if there's anyone who would call this a musical instrument), neither percussion instruments, string instruments, nor wind instruments.\\" and \\"instead of developing the playing of musical instruments, they perfected singing and rhythm.\\"Spielberg Jewish Film Archive - Teiman: The Music of the Yemenite Jews: 4:32‚Äì4:48: \\"Drumming was used by all. Mourning the destruction of the second temple resulted in the prohibition of using musical instruments. The Yemenites, stringent in their observance, accepted this ban literally. Instead of developing the playing of musical instruments, they perfected singing and rhythm.\\" (See Yemenite Jewish poetry. For the modern Yemenite- Israeli musical phenomenon, however, see Yemenite Jewish music.) It was with the piyyutim (liturgical poems) that Jewish music began to crystallize into definite form. The cantor sang the piyyutim to melodies selected by their writer or by himself, thus introducing fixed melodies into synagogal music. The prayers he continued to recite as he had heard his predecessors recite them; but in moments of inspiration he would give utterance to a phrase of unusual beauty, which, caught up by the congregants. = Adaptations from local music = The music may have preserved a few phrases in the reading of Scripture which recalled songs from the Temple itself; but generally it echoed the tones which the Jew of each age and country heard around him, not merely in the actual borrowing of tunes, but more in the tonality on which the local music was based. These elements persist side by side, rendering the traditional intonations a blend of different sources. The underlying principle may be the specific allotment in Jewish worship of a particular mode to each sacred occasion, because of some esthetic appropriateness felt to underlie the association. In contrast to the meager modal choice of modern melody, the synagogal tradition revels in the possession of scale-forms preserved from the remote past, much as are to be perceived in the plain-song of the Catholic, the Byzantine, and the Armenian churches, as well as Hungarian, Roma, Persian and Arab sources.  Cantorial and synagogue music  The traditional mode of singing prayers in the synagogue is often known as hazzanut, \\"the art of being a hazzan (cantor)\\". It is a style of florid melodious intonation which requires the exercise of vocal agility. It was introduced into Europe in the 7th century, then rapidly developed. The age of the various elements in synagogal song may be traced from the order in which the passages of the text were first introduced into the liturgy and were in turn regarded as so important as to demand special vocalization. This order closely agrees with that in which the successive tones and styles still preserved for these elements came into use among the Gentile neighbors of the Jews who utilized them. Earliest of all is the cantillation of the Bible, in which the traditions of the various rites differ only as much and in the same manner from one another as their particular interpretations according to the text and occasion differ among themselves. This indeed was to be anticipated if the differentiation itself preserves a peculiarity of the music of the Temple.See Hebrew cantillation Next comes, from the first ten centuries, and probably taking shape only with the Jewish settlement in western and northern Europe, the cantillation of the Amidah referred to below, which was the first portion of the liturgy dedicated to a musical rendering, all that preceded it remaining unchanted. Gradually the song of the precentor commenced at ever earlier points in the service. By the 10th century, the chant began at Barukh she'amar, the previous custom having been to commence the singing at \\"Nishmat,\\" these conventions being still traceable in practise in the introit signalizing the entry of the junior and of the senior officiant. Hence, in turn, appeared cantillation, prayer-motive, fixed melody, and hymn as forms of synagogal music. =Reminiscences of Gentile Sacred Melody= The contemporaneous musical fashion of the outer world has ever found its echo within the walls of the synagogue, so that in the superstructure added by successive generations of transmitting singers there are always discernible points of comparison, even of contact, with the style and structure of each successive era in the musical history of other religious communions. Attention has frequently been drawn to the resemblances in manner and even in some points of detail between the chants of the muezzin and of the reader of the Qur'an with much of the hazzanut, not alone of the Sephardim, who passed so many centuries in Arab lands, but also of the Ashkenazim, equally long located far away in northern Europe. The intonations of the Sephardim even more intimately recall the plainsong of the Mozarabian Christians, which flourished in their proximity until the 13th century. Their chants and other set melodies largely consist of very short phrases often repeated, just as Perso-Arab melody so often does; and their congregational airs usually preserve a Morisco or other Peninsular character. The Cantillation reproduces the tonalities and the melodic outlines prevalent in the western world during the first ten centuries of the Diaspora; and the prayer-motives, although their method of employment recalls far more ancient and more Oriental parallels, are equally reminiscent of those characteristic of the eighth to the 13th century of the common era. Many of the phrases introduced in the hazzanut generally, closely resemble the musical expression of the sequences which developed in the Catholic plainsong after the example set by the school famous as that of Notker Balbulus, at St. Gall, in the early 10th century. The earlier formal melodies still more often are paralleled in the festal intonations of the monastic precentors of the eleventh to the 15th century, even as the later synagogal hymns everywhere approximate greatly to the secular music of their day. The traditional penitential intonation transcribed in the article Ne'ilah with the piyyut \\"Darkeka\\" closely reproduces the music of a parallel species of medieval Latin verse, the metrical sequence \\"Missus Gabriel de C≈ìlis\\" by Adam of St. Victor (c. 1150) as given in the Graduale Romanum of Sarum. The mournful chant characteristic of penitential days in all the Jewish rites, is closely recalled by the Church antiphon in the second mode \\"Da Pacem Domine in Diebus Nostris\\" (\\"Vesperale Ratisbon,\\" p. 42). The joyous intonation of the Northern European rite for morning and afternoon prayers on the Three Festivals (Passover, Sukkot and Shavuot) closes with the third tone, third ending of the Gregorian psalmody; and the traditional chant for the Hallel itself, when not the one reminiscent of the \\"Tonus Peregrinus,\\" closely corresponds with those for Ps. cxiii. and cxvii. (\\"Laudate Pueri\\" and \\"Laudate Dominum\\") in the \\"Graduale Romanum\\" of Ratisbon, for the vespers of June 24, the festival of John the Baptist, in which evening service the famous \\"Ut Queant Laxis,\\" from which the modern scale derived the names of its degrees, also occurs. =Prayer-Motives= Next to the passages of Scripture recited in cantillation, the most ancient and still the most important section of the Jewish liturgy is the sequence of benedictions which is known as the Amidah (\\"standing prayer\\"), being the section which in the ritual of the Dispersion more immediately takes the place of the sacrifice offered in the ritual of the Temple on the corresponding occasion. It accordingly attracts the intonation of the passages which precede and follow it into its own musical rendering. Like the lessons, it, too, is cantillated. This free intonation is not, as with the Scriptural texts, designated by any system of accents, but consists of a melodious development of certain themes or motives traditionally associated with the individual service, and therefore termed by the present writer \\"prayer-motives.\\" These are each differentiated from other prayer- motives much as are the respective forms of the cantillation, the divergence being especially marked in the tonality due to the modal feeling alluded to above. Tonality depends on that particular position of the semitones or smaller intervals between two successive degrees of the scale which causes the difference in color familiar to modern ears in the contrast between major and minor melodies. Throughout the musical history of the synagogue a particular mode or scale-form has long been traditionally associated with a particular service. It appears in its simplest form in the prayer-motivewhich is best defined, to use a musical phrase, as a sort of codato which the benediction (berakha) closing each paragraph of the prayers is to be chanted. This is associated with a secondary phrase, somewhat after the tendency which led to the framing of the binary form in European classical music. The phrases are amplified and developed according to the length, the structure, and, above all, the sentiment of the text of the paragraph, and lead always into the coda in a manner anticipating the form of instrumental music entitled the \\"rondo,\\" although in no sense an imitation of the modern form. The responses likewise follow the tonality of the prayer-motive. This intonation is designated by the Hebrew term nigun (\\"tune\\") when its melody is primarily in view, by the Yiddish term \\"di skaler\\" (scale) when its modal peculiarities and tonality are under consideration, and by the Romance word \\"gust\\" and the Slavonic \\"skarbowa\\" when the taste or style of the rendering especially marks it off from other music. The use of these terms, in addition to such less definite Hebraisms as \\"ne'imah\\" (\\"melody\\"), shows that the scales and intervals of such prayer-motives have long been recognized and observed to differ characteristically from those of contemporary Gentile music, even if the principles underlying their employment have only quite recently been formulated. =Modal Difference= The modal differences are not always so observable in the Sephardic or Southern tradition. [NOTE: This musician reader is in disagreement with the statement that \\"modal differences are not always so observable in these traditions,\\" the implication of which is that differences in modes are frequently not observable. In fact, the fluid movements from one minor mode to another within Jewish religious melodies are quite apparent to the ear. For instance, the Phrygian mode (beginning on the third tone of any major scale and ascending to its octave, incorporating the accidentals [sharps or flats] of the major scale) is a mode recognizable in the extreme, as are the Dorian, Aoelian, Melodic Minor and Harmonic Minor scales. The Dorian and Aoelian modes begin on the 2nd and 6th degrees of any major scale, respectively, ascend the octave, and incorporate the accidentals of the major scale. (The Harmonic minor scale is similar to the Aeolian mode, but the 7th degree of the scale is raised. The Melodic Minor on its ascension incorporates a flatted third and raised 6th and 7th degrees of the scale, but on its descend is identical to the Aeolian mode, the 7th, 6th, and third being flatted.) In religious Jewish music, mode flows to mode, each being readily discernible. Thus the Phrygian mode, with its characteristic flatted 2nd, is used, then sometimes replaced later within the melody by the natural 2nd degree of the Aeolian and Dorian modes. That movement, however, is most often reversed, i.e.; traveling from Aeolian or Dorian 2nd to the Phrygian's flatted 2nd. The Phrygian flatted third, instead of moving to its natural 4th degree of the mode, can move to the #4the characteristic fourth degree of the major Lydian Mode. This is an intervalic distance of a minor third, which creates a strong Arabic sound. The article goes on to say:] Here the participation of the congregants has tended to a more general uniformity, and has largely reduced the intonation to a chant around the dominant, or fifth degree of the scale, as if it were a derivation from the Ashkenazic daily morning theme (see below), but ending with a descent to the major third [Second observation: Very rarely is there an ending descent to the major third if the melody is modal.], or, less often, to the tonic note. [Third observation: The final descent is almost always to the tonic, be the melody in major tonality or modal (minor).] Even where the particular occasionsuch as a fastmight call for a change of tonality, the anticipation of the congregational response brings the close of the benediction back to the usual major third. [Fourth observation: Not so. A \\"benediction\\" beginning in a minor modemeaning a scale with a minor third instead of a major thirdwill end in a minor mode.] But enough differences remain, especially in the Italian rendering, to show that the principle of parallel rendering with modal difference, fully apparent in their cantillation, underlies the prayer-intonations of the Sephardim also. This principle has marked effects in the Ashkenazic or Northern tradition, where it is as clear in the rendering of the prayers as in that of the Scriptural lessons, and is also apparent in the ·∏≤erobot. All the tonalities are distinct. They are formulated in the subjoined tabular statement, in which the various traditional motives of the Ashkenazic ritual have been brought to the same pitch of reciting-note in order to facilitate comparison of their modal differences. =Chromatic Intervals= By ancient tradition, from the days when the Jews who passed the Middle Ages in Teutonic lands were still under the same tonal influences as the peoples in southeastern Europe and Asia Minor yet are, chromatic scales (i.e., those showing some successive intervals greater than two semitones) have been preserved.[Note: A chromatic scale is a scale consisting of 1/2 tones, or semitones] Shabbat morning and weekday evening motives are especially affected by this survival, which also frequently induces the Polish ·∏•azzanim to modify similarly the diatonic intervals of the other prayer-motives. The chromatic intervals survive as a relic of the Oriental tendency to divide an ordinary interval of pitch into subintervals (compare Hallel for Sukkot, the \\"lulav\\" chant), as a result of the intricacy of some of the vocal embroideries in actual employment, which are not infrequently of a character to daunt an ordinary singer. Even among Western cantors, trained amid mensurate music on a contrapuntal basis, there is still a remarkable propensity to introduce the interval of the augmented second, especially between the third and second degrees of any scale in a descending cadence. Quite commonly two augmented seconds will be employed in the octave, as in the frequent formmuch loved by Eastern peoplestermed by Bourgault-Ducoudray (\\"M√©lodies Populaires de Gr√®ce et d'Orient,\\" p. 20, Paris, 1876) \\"the Oriental chromatic\\" (see music below). The \\"harmonia,\\" or manner in which the prayer-motive will be amplified into hazzanut, is measured rather by the custom of the locality and the powers of the officiant than by the importance of the celebration. The precentor will accommodate the motive to the structure of the sentence he is reciting by the judicious use of the reciting-note, varied by melismatic ornament. In the development of the subject he is bound to no definite form, rhythm, manner, or point of detail, but may treat it quite freely according to his personal capacity, inclination, and sentiment, so long only as the conclusion of the passage and the short doxology closing it, if it ends in a benediction, are chanted to the snatch of melody forming the coda, usually distinctly fixed and so furnishing the modal motive. The various sections of the melodious improvisation will thus lead smoothly back to the original subject, and so work up to a symmetrical and clear conclusion. The prayer-motives, being themselves definite in tune and well recognized in tradition, preserve the homogeneity of the service through the innumerable variations induced by impulse or intention, by energy or fatigue, by gladness or depression, and by every other mental and physical sensation of the precentor which can affect his artistic feeling (see table).  Occasions for Music  The development of music among the Israelites was coincident with that of poetry, the two being equally ancient, since every poem was also sung. Although little mention is made of it, music was used in very early times in connection with divine service. Amos 6:5 and Isaiah 5:12 show that the feasts immediately following sacrifices were very often attended with music, and from Amos 5:23 it may be gathered that songs had already become a part of the regular service. Moreover, popular festivals of all kinds were celebrated with singing and music, usually accompanying dances in which, as a rule, women and maidens joined. Victorious generals were welcomed with music on their return,Judges 11:34; I Samuel 18:6 and music naturally accompanied the dances at harvest festivalsJudges 9:27, 21:21 and at the accession of kings or their marriages.I Kings 1:40; Psalms 45:9 Family festivals of different kinds were celebrated with music.Genesis 31:27; Jeremiah 25:10 I Samuel 16:18 indicates that the shepherd cheered his loneliness with his reed-pipe, and Lamentations 5:14 shows that youths coming together at the gates entertained one another with stringed instruments. David by his playing on the harp drove away an evil spirit from Saul;I Samuel 16:16 et seq. the holy ecstasy of the Prophets was stimulated by dancing and music;I Samuel 10:5,10; 19:20 playing on a harp awoke the inspiration that came to Elisha.II Kings 3:15 The description in Chronicles of the embellishment by David of the Temple service with a rich musical liturgy represents in essence the order of the Second Temple, since, as is now generally admitted, the liturgical Temple Psalms belong to the post-exilic period. The importance which music attained in the later exilic period is shown by the fact that in the original writings of Ezra and Nehemiah a distinction is still drawn between the singers and the Levites (comp. Ezra 2:41,70; 7:7,24; 10:23; Nehemiah 7:44, 73; 10:29,40; etc.); whereas in the parts of the books of Ezra and Nehemiah belonging to the Chronicles singers are reckoned among the Levites (compare Ezra 3:10; Nehemiah 11:22; 12:8,24,27; I Chronicles 6:16). In later times singers even received a priestly position, since Agrippa II. gave them permission to wear the white priestly garment.(comp. Josephus, \\"Antiquities\\" 20:9, ¬ß 6). The detailed statements of the Talmud show that the service became ever more richly embellished.  Singing in the Temple  Unfortunately few definite statements can be made concerning the kind and the degree of the artistic development of music and psalm-singing. Only so much seems certain, that the folk-music of older times was replaced by professional music, which was learned by the families of singers who officiated in the Temple. The participation of the congregation in the Temple song was limited to certain responses, such as \\"Amen\\" or \\"Halleluiah,\\" or formulas like \\"Since His mercy endureth forever,\\" etc. As in the old folk-songs, antiphonal singing, or the singing of choirs in response to each other, was a feature of the Temple service. At the dedication of the walls of Jerusalem, Nehemiah formed the Levitical singers into two large choruses, which, after having marched around the city walls in different directions, stood opposite each other at the Temple and sang alternate hymns of praise to God (Nehemiah 12:31). Niebuhr (\\"Reisen,\\" i. 176) calls attention to the fact that in the Orient it is still the custom for a precentor to sing one strophe, which is repeated three, four, or five tones lower by the other singers. In this connection mention may be made of the alternating song of the seraphim in the Temple, when called upon by Isaiah (comp. Isa. vi.). The measure must have varied according to the character of the song; and it is not improbable that it changed even in the same song. Without doubt the striking of the cymbals marked the measure. Ancient Hebrew music, like much Arabic music today, was probably monophonic; that is, there is no harmony. Niebuhr refers to the fact that when Arabs play on different instruments and sing at the same time, almost the same melody is heard from all, unless one of them sings or plays as bass one and the same note throughout. It was probably the same with the Israelites in olden times, who attuned the stringed instruments to the voices of the singers either on the same note or in the octave or at some other consonant interval. This explains the remark in II Chronicles 5:13 that at the dedication of the Temple the playing of the instruments, the singing of the Psalms, and the blare of the trumpets sounded as one sound. Probably the unison of the singing of Psalms was the accord of two voices an octave apart. This may explain the terms \\"al alamot\\" and \\"al ha-sheminit.\\" On account of the important part which women from the earliest times took in singing, it is comprehensible that the higher pitch was simply called the \\"maiden's key,\\" and \\"ha-sheminit\\" would then be an octave lower. There is no question that melodies repeated in each strophe, in the modern manner, were not sung at either the earlier or the later periods of psalm-singing; since no such thing as regular strophes occurred in Hebrew poetry. In fact, in the earlier times there were no strophes at all; and although they are found later, they are by no means so regular as in modern poetry. Melody, therefore, must then have had comparatively great freedom and elasticity and must have been like the Oriental melody of today. As Niebuhr points out, the melodies are earnest and simple, and the singers must make every word intelligible. A comparison has often been made with the eight notes of the Gregorian chant or with the Oriental psalmody introduced into the church of Milan by Ambrosius: the latter, however, was certainly developed under the influence of Grecian music, although in origin it may have had some connection with the ancient synagogal psalm-singing, as Delitzsch claims that it was (\\"Psalmen,\\" 3d ed., p. 27). Contemporary Jewish religious music Jewish Music in the 20th century has spanned the gamut from Shlomo Carlebach's nigunim to Debbie Friedman's Jewish feminist folk, and includes through-composed settings of the Avodath Hakodesh (\\"Sacred Service\\") by such composers as Ernest Bloch, Darius Milhaud, and Marc Lavry. Velvel Pasternak has spent much of the late 20th century acting as a preservationist and committing what had been a strongly oral tradition to paper. John Zorn's record label, Tzadik, features a \\"Radical Jewish Culture\\" series that focuses on exploring what contemporary Jewish music is and what it offers to contemporary Jewish culture. Periodically Jewish music jumps into mainstream consciousness, Matisyahu (musician) being the most recent example. =Example= One type of music, based on Shlomo Carlebach's, is very popular among Orthodox artists and their listeners. This type of music usually consists of the same formulaic mix. This mix is usually brass, horns and strings. These songs are composed from within one pool of composers and one pool of arrangers. Many of the entertainers are former yeshiva students, and perform dressed in a dress suit. Many have day jobs and sideline singing at Jewish weddings. Others moonlight in kollel study or at Jewish organizations. Some have no formal musical education, and sing mainly pre-arranged songs. Lyrics are most commonly short passages in Hebrew from the Torah or the siddur, with the occasional obscure passage from the Talmud. Sometimes there are songs with lyrics compiled in English in more standard form, with central themes such as Jerusalem, the Holocaust, Jewish identity, and the Jewish diaspora. Some composers are Yossi Green; a big-name arranger of this type of music is Yisroel Lamm. Artists include Avraham Fried, Dedi Graucher, Lipa Schmeltzer, Mordechai Ben David, Shloime Dachs, Shloime Gertner, and Yaakov Shwekey. =Contemporary Music for Children= Many Orthodox Jews believe that \\"secular music\\" contains messages that are incompatible with Judaism. Parents often limit their children's exposure to music produced by those other than Orthodox Jews, so that they will not become negatively influenced by many of the more, in the parents' eyes, harmful outside ideas and fashions. A large body of music produced by Orthodox Jews for children is geared toward teaching religious and ethical traditions and laws. The lyrics of these songs are generally English with some Hebrew or Yiddish phrases. Country Yossi, Abie Rotenberg, Uncle Moishy, and the producers of the 613 Torah Avenue series are examples of Orthodox Jewish musicians/entertainers whose music teach children Orthodox traditions.

It is a spreading shrub with small glossy, warty leaves and white or pink four-petalled flowers in spring. It is a rare plant with fewer than one hundred plants known from only one site. Description Zieria adenophora is an openly branched shrub which grows to a height of and has its branches covered with many small warty tubercles. The leaves are strongly aromatic and are composed of three leaflets, each leaflet wedge-shaped to egg- shaped, about long and wide with a stalk about long. Both surfaces of the leaves are warty and mostly glabrous. The flowers are white or very pale pink and are arranged in leaf axils in groups of one to three. The groups are shorter than the leaves, each flower about in diameter with small, triangular sepals. There are four lance-shaped petals long, with the narrower end towards the base. Flowering occurs in spring and is followed by fruit which are warty capsules about in diameter and divided into four chambers, each containing one or two seeds.Close-up of Zieria adenophora leaves in Batemans Bay Botanic Garden Taxonomy and naming Zieria adenophora was first formally described in 1941 by William Blakely from a specimen collected near Bells Creek Falls, Araluen. The description was published in Contributions from the New South Wales National Herbarium. The specific epithet (adenophora) is derived from the Ancient Greek word aden meaning \\"gland\\" and the suffix -phor meaning \\"to bear\\", \\"to carry\\" or \\"to have\\". Distribution and habitat Araluen Zieria grows on rocky hillsides near granite boulders in shrubland. It is only known from the Araluen district. Conservation This zieria is listed as \\"Endangered\\" under the New South Wales Threatened Species Conservation Act and under the Commonwealth Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC) Act. In 2001, this zieria was only known from a population of 56 mature plants. Trampling by feral goats causes a serious threat to the survival of this plant but a fence has been constructed to deter grazing animals.

History In May 2010 a memo by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) from 2009 was released to the public that warned that cyber attacks on Canadian government, university, and industry computers was showing growth in 2009 and that the threat of cyber attacks was \\"one of the fastest growing and most complicated issues\\" facing CSIS. Minister of Public Safety Vic Toews stated in January 2011 that cyber attacks are a serious threat to Canada and that attacks on government computers have grown \\"quite substantial.\\" In the fall of 2010 the federal government began to strategize ways to prevent cyber attacks and create response plans, which would include $90 million over five years in combating cyber threats. Auditor General Sheila Fraser has previously warned that the federal government's computer systems risk being breached. In 2002 she stated that the government's internet security was not adequate and warned that it had \\"weaknesses in the system\\" and urged improving security to deal with the vulnerabilities. In 2005 she said the government still has to \\"translate its policies and standards into consistent, cost-effective practices that will result in a more secure IT environment in departments and agencies.\\" Cyber attack The cyber attack was first detected in January 2011 and implemented as a phishing scheme. Emails with seemingly innocuous attachments were sent, supposedly by known public servants. The attachments contained malware which infected the computer and exfiltrated key information such as passwords. This information, once sent back to the hackers, could then be used to remotely access the computer and forward the email (with infecting attachment) onto others in order to proliferate the virus. Affected departments included Treasury Board and the federal Finance Department, as well as a DND agency advising the Canadian armed forces on science and technology. Once detected, Canadian cybersecurity officials shut down all internet access from these departments in order to halt the exfiltration of information from hijacked computers. This left thousands of public servants without internet access. While the cyber attacks were traced back to Chinese IP addresses, there is \\"no way of knowing whether the hackers are Chinese, or some other nationality routing their cybercrimes through China to cover their tracks\\". Response Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ma Zhaoxu denies the Chinese government was involved in the attacks. When the attacks were detected internet access in the two departments was shut down to prevent stolen information from being sent back to the hackers. The Prime Minister's office have only claimed the hackers made an \\"attempt to access\\" servers and did not comment further. A spokesman for Treasury Board Minister Stockwell Day said there were no indications that any data related to Canadians was compromised. CSIS officials have advised the government to not name China as the attacker and not talk about the attacks, while a government official stated Chinese espionage has become a problem for Canada and other countries. On February 17, Prime Minister Stephen Harper stated that the government has \\"a strategy in place to try and evolve our systems as those who would attack them become more sophisticated\\" and that cyber attacks are \\"a growing issue of importance, not just in this country, but across the world.\\" The same day, Stockwell Day also stated that the attacks weren't \\" the most aggressive [attack] but it was a significant one, significant that they were going after financial records.\\" The Chinese government has denied involvement in the attacks. Foreign Ministry Spokesman Ma Zhaoxu said at a press conference on February 17 that the Chinese government opposes hacking and other criminal acts, saying that \\"the allegation that China supports hacking is groundless.\\" See also Cyber attack during the Paris G20 Summit References 2011 in Canada Canada‚ÄìChina relations Internet in Canada Cyberwarfare in China ","title":"2011 Canadian government hackings"},{"id":"30901421","text":"Microfluidic whole genome haplotyping is a technique for the physical separation of individual chromosomes from a metaphase cell followed by direct resolution of the haplotype for each allele. Background =Whole genome haplotyping= Whole genome haplotyping is the process of resolving personal haplotypes on a whole genome basis.The next phase in human genetics. Bansal V. et al. Nat Biotechnol. 2011 Jan;29(1):38-9. Current methods of next generation sequencing are capable of identifying heterozygous loci, but they are not well suited to identify which polymorphisms exist on the same (in cis) or allelic (in trans) strand of DNA. Haplotype information contributes to the understanding of the potential functional effects of variants in cis or in trans. Haplotypes are more frequently resolved by inference through comparison with parental genotypes, or from population samples using statistical computational methods to determine linkage disequilibrium between markers. Direct haplotyping is possible through isolation of chromosomes or chromosome segments. Most molecular biology techniques for haplotyping can accurately determine haplotypes of only a limited region of the genome. Whole genome direct haplotyping involves the resolution of haplotype at the whole genome level, usually through the isolation of individual chromosomes.  Haplotype  A haplotype (haplo: from Ancient Greek ·ºÅœÄŒªœåŒøœÇ (hapl√≥os, ‚Äúsingle, simple‚Äù) is a contiguous section of closely linked segments of DNA within the larger genome that tend to be inherited together as a unit on a single chromosome. Haplotypes have no defined size and can refer to anything from a few closely linked loci up to an entire chromosome. The term is also used to describe groups of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are statistically associated. Most of the knowledge of SNP association comes from the effort of the International HapMap Project, which has proved itself a powerful resource in the development of a publicly accessible database of human genetic variation.  Phasing  Phasing is the process of identifying the individual complement of homologous chromosomes. Methods for phasing include pedigree analysis, allele-specific PCR, linkage emulsion PCR haplotype analysis,Linking emulsion PCR haplotype analysis. Wetmur JG, Chen J. Methods Mol Biol. 2011;687:165-75. polony PCR,Long-range polony haplotyping of individual human chromosome molecules. Zhang K, et al. Nat. Genet. 2006;38:382‚Äì87 sperm typing, bacterial artificial chromosome cloning, construction of somatic cell hybrids, atomic force microscopy, among others. Haplotype phasing can also be achieved through computational inference methods. =Microfluidics= Microfluidics refers to the use of micro-sized channels on a micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS).microfluidics for biological applications. Finehout E, Tian WC. Springer US. 2009. Microfluidic channels have a diameter of 10-100Œºm, making it possible to manipulate and analyze minute volumes. This technology combines engineering, physics, chemistry, biology, and optics. Over the past decades it has revolutionized micro and nanoscale biology, genetics and proteomics. Microfluidic devices can combine several analytical steps into one device. This technology has been coined by some as the \\"lab on a chip\\" technology. Most current molecular biology methods use some form of MEMS, including microarray technology and next generation sequencing instruments. Microfluidic direct deterministic phasing =Principle= Direct deterministic phasing of individual chromosomes can be achieved by isolating single chromosomes for genetic analysis through the use of a microfluidic device.Whole-genome molecular haplotyping of single cells. Fan HC et al. Nat Biotechnol. 2011 =Methods= Workflow of microfluidic whole genome chromosome isolation and amplification. Not at scale A single metaphase cell is isolated from solution. The chromosomes are then released from the nucleus, and the cytoplasm is digested enzymatically. Next, the chromosome suspension is directed towards multiple partitioning channels. The chromosomes are physically directed into the partitioning channels using a series of valves. In the first description of this technique, Fan et al. designed a custom-made program (MatLab) to control this process. Once separated, the chromosomes are prepared for amplification by sequential addition and washout of trypsin, denaturation buffer and neutralization solution. The DNA is then ready for further processing. Because of the small amount of DNA, amplification needs to be performed using kits specialized for very small initial DNA quantities. The amplified DNA is flushed out of the microfluidic device and solubilized by the addition of a buffer. The amplified DNA can now be analyzed by various methods. Once the chromosomes have been isolated and amplified any molecular haplotyping can be applied as long as the chromosomes remain distinct. This could be accomplished by keeping them physically separated, or identifying each sample by genotyping. Once each chromosome has been identified each pair of homologs can be assorted into one of two haploid genomes. =Applications= Microfluidic direct deterministic phasing allows all the chromosomes to be isolated in the same experiment. This unique feature suggests possible applications within clinical, research and personal genomics realms. Some of the possible clinical applications for this technique include phasing of multiple mutations when parental samples are unavailable, preimplantation genetic diagnosis, prenatal diagnosis and in the characterization of cancer cells. Whole genome haplotyping through microfluidics will increase the rate of discovery within the HapMap project, and provides an opportunity for corroboration and error detection within the existing database. It will further inform genetic association studies. As methods for amplification of small amounts of DNA improve, single chromosome sequencing is possible using microfluidics to separate each individual chromosome. A cost-effective approach may be to barcode each individual chromosome and perform parallel resequencing of the entire individual genome. The amplification of each chromosome separately also provides a mechanism to potentially fill in some of the gaps that remain in the human reference genome. Single chromosome sequencing will allow for unmapped sequences to be associated with a single chromosome. Additionally, single chromosome sequencing will be more accurate in the identification of copy number variants and repetitive sequences. =Limitations= As of January 2011, only one publication has described use of this technique. The scientific commons awaits further validation of this method and its efficacy in isolating and amplifying analyzable amounts of DNA. While this method does streamline the process of chromosome isolation, certain parts in the process ‚Äì such as the initial isolation of a metaphase cell ‚Äì remain difficult and labour intensive. Other automated techniques for metaphase cell separation would improve throughput. In addition, this method is only applicable to cells in metaphase, which inherently limits the technique to cell types and tissues that undergo mitosis. Single cell analysis does not account for the possibility of mosaicism; therefore, applications in cancer diagnosis and research would necessarily require processing of multiple cells. Finally, since this entire process is based on amplification from a single cell, the accuracy of any genetic analysis is limited to the ability of commercially available platforms to produce sufficient amounts of unbiased and error free amplicon. Alternative methods of whole genome haplotyping =Chromosome microdissection= Chromosome microdissection is another process for isolating single chromosomes for genetic analysis. As with the above technique microdissection begins with metaphase cells. The nucleus is lysed mechanically on a glass slide and part of the genetic material is partitioned under microscope. The actual microdissection of genetic material was initially accomplished through the careful use of a fine needle. Today computer-directed lasers are available. The genomic area isolated can range from part of a single chromosome, up to several chromosomes. To accomplish whole genome haplotyping the microdissected genomic section is amplified and genotyped or sequenced. Like with the microfluidic technique, specialized amplification platforms are necessary to address the problem of a small initial DNA sample.Whole Genome Amplification from Microdissected Chromosomes. M. Hockner et al. Cytogenetic and Genome research 2009; 125: 98-102Direct determination of molecular haplotypes by chromosome microdissection. L. Ma et al. Nature Methods vol. 7 no. 4 299-301.Chromosome-specific segmentation revealed by structural analysis of individually isolated chromosomes. K. Kitada et al. Genes, Chromosomes and Cancer, 50(4): 217‚Äì227, April 2011 =Large insert cloning= Randomly partitioning a complete diploid fosmid library into various pools of equal size presents an alternative method for haplotype phasing. In the proof of principle description of this techniqueHaplotype- resolved genome sequencing of a Gujarati Indian individual. J.O. Kitzman et al. Nature Biotechnology vol 29 no 1 59-63 115 pools were created containing ~5000 unique clones from the original fosmid library. Each of these pools contained roughly 3% of the genome. Between the 3% in each pool and the fact that each clone is a random sampling of the diploid genome, 99.1% of the time each pool contains DNA from a single homolog. Amplification and analysis of each pool provide haplotype resolution limited only by the size of the fosmid insert.

It was formed in 2011 from the previously state-owned energy retailer/distributor, EnergyAustralia, when the retail division of the company, along with the EnergyAustralia brand, was sold by the Government of New South Wales, and the remainder renamed Ausgrid. Ownership Ausgrid was wholly owned by the Government of New South Wales from 2011 to 2016. In 2016, the New South Wales Government offered the effective sale of a 50.4% stake in Ausgrid, through a 99-year lease. Initial bidding was won by a consortium of State Grid Corporation of China and Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings. On 11 August 2016 the Federal Government intervened to block the proposal, citing national security concerns regarding foreign ownership of critical infrastructure. In September 2016 the New South Wales Government instead accepted a bid from an Australian-based consortium of AustralianSuper and IFM Investors, for a sum of $16 billion. History Ausgrid has received numerous complaints and requests for better stakeholder management and consultation of the local community. Ausgrid was seen as forcing their network capacity increasing (and therefore profit increasing) projects onto local residential communities. Affected residents groups from the suburbs of Leichhardt, Penshurst and East Lindfield protested against proposed electricity infrastructure being installed in front of their residential homes without proper consultation or response to complaints by the community. The residents, after many urgent appeals to Ausgrid's COO Trevor Armstrong and the chairman Roger Massey-Green, had been given no other option to notify local MP's, the media, the Environmental Protection Authority and other authorities to get action against Ausgrid.

Early life Stephen W. Shaw was born December 15, 1817 at Windsor, Vermont, to Seth and Elizabeth Barrett Shaw, descendants of Puritans and American Revolutionaries. As a young adult, Shaw taught drawing and penmanship at Norwich Military Academy, then became an art teacher and director of the Boston Athenaeum before moving to the American South and making his living as an itinerant portraitist. In 1845, shortly after opening a studio in Lexington, Kentucky, Shaw painted his first known oil portrait. A year later, in Baton Rouge, Shaw painted a portrait of General Zachary Taylor which won a silver medal at the American Institute. In 1848, Shaw was commissioned for $1,000 by the City of New Orleans for a portrait of native son Persifer F. Smith. Shaw traveled to Veracruz and Mexico City, painting the portrait on his return to New Orleans. Joining the California Gold Rush, Shaw left New Orleans aboard the merchant steamer Isthmus, on April 21, 1849. After crossing the Isthmus of Panama, he booked passage on the Dutch bark, Alexander von Humboldt, which left Panama on May 20, 1849. Becalmed for five weeks, they reached Acapulco July 6 where the passengers forced the owners off the boat due to poor provisioning and overcrowding. After more than three months voyage, the ship finally arrived in San Francisco, August 30, 1849 and was sold for $17,000 to satisfy the passengers' lien against the owners. One of the other passengers, Collis P. Huntington, formed an association of the 365 survivors of the 102-day passage, called \\"The Society of the Humboldter.\\" Huntington sponsored reunions and at least one commemorative poster; the last four members met in August 30, 1899. Contrary to at least one published report, neither ships' manifest lists Shaw's brother Seth Shaw who was elsewhere reported to have crossed the country overland in 1850. Huntington, a large group of fellow passengers, and Stephen Shaw immediately went to the gold mines at Mormon Island for about six months, then Shaw moved to Sacramento for February and March 1850, where he met future judge Edwin B. Crocker, brother of railroad baron Charles Crocker, for whom he would paint more than 25 portraits of notable Californians. Discovery of Humboldt Bay In the early part of March 1850, Shaw left San Francisco on the schooner Laura Virginia, under Captain Douglas Ottenger. At anchor near Trinidad on April 7, expedition director E.H. Howard selected Shaw and four others to go ashore at Trinidad Bay to locate the entrance to Humboldt Bay from shore. The six men walked down the beach, were ferried across the Mad River by Indians, and camped for the night on the spit north of the entrance to Humboldt Bay. The next day, the shore party walked back to Trinidad and was picked up by the Laura Virginia. On April 9, 1850, second mate Hans Henry Buhne piloted the first landing craft over the bar and into Humboldt Bay. Later that same day, two more boatloads of passengers and supplies were landed. On April 14, Buhne piloted the Laura Virginia over the bar and into the bay near the tents of the shore party. Shaw sketched the first views of the bay and insisted the bay be named honoring Prussian naturalist Alexander von Humboldt. On April 26, 1850, the San Francisco Daily Journal of Commerce published a wood engraving based on his sketches of Humboldt Bay. Shaw returned to San Francisco on the steamer Sea Gull April 5, 1851. From Sutter's to farming in Humboldt County In 1851, Shaw spent much of the year with John Augustus Sutter at Hock Farm on the Feather River as the family portrait painter and general business agent. Following a brief engagement to Sutter's daughter, Ann \\"Eliza\\" Sutter (1828 - March,1895), Shaw returned to San Francisco, and later that year, with his brother Seth Shaw and Willard Allen, settled on Table Bluff, near Loleta. In summer 1852, they moved across the Eel River and began clearing the area where the town of Ferndale, California would later be incorporated. In the rainy winter of 1852-1853, twelve men, including Seth Kinman, stayed with the Shaws because theirs was the most finished cabin. Shaw spent the next two years coaxing plants to grow in the cold coastal fog. Around 1852, he painted the portrait of Wiyot elder Kiwelattah (or Ki-we-lah-tah). Finally, with little to show for his labors, Shaw returned to San Francisco in 1854 and later sold his claim to Ferndale settler Francis Francis, in 1856. San Francisco portrait painter Shaw moved quickly in the big city, setting up studio, joining the Mason's California Lodge No. 1 in San Francisco June 1, 1854 and painting more than 200 portraits of Masonic Officers, possibly from photographs. Shaw took first prize for best portrait in oils at the 1860 California State Fair. Image:John_Augustus_Sutter_by_Stephen_W_Shaw.jpgJohn Augustus Sutter, June 1851 by Stephen W.

Shaw On April 18, 1861 Shaw married Mary Frances Meacham at the First Unitarian Church in San Francisco. Shaw grew grapes and is credited with introducing wine grape cultivation to the Sonoma County. The Shaws had two children before Mary died October 2, 1866. Shaw spent 1871 abroad and married Lucretia Swain of Nantucket, Massachusetts August 12, 1873 on his return to San Francisco. Shaw died February 14, 1900 in San Francisco, memorialized in an obituary in the San Francisco Examiner, 16 February 1900. Memberships Shaw was a member of the Masons, the Society of California Pioneers, The Bohemian Club, the Mechanics' Institute and the San Francisco Art Association. Paintings and manuscripts Many of Shaw's paintings were lost to the fires of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, those remaining are known to be in collections of the Bancroft Library, M. H. de Young Memorial Museum, Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco, the Oakland Museum, City of New Orleans, Nantucket Historical Society, the Crocker Art Museum of Sacramento, The Ferndale Museum, The Clarke Historical Museum, and the Society of California Pioneers. Shaw painted several family portraits including his mother Elizabeth Barrett Shaw (c. 1860s), brother Sylvanus Harvey Shaw (both at the Ferndale Museum), brother Seth Shaw (Ferndale's Masonic Temple). Shaw descendants preserve another portrait of Seth, a portrait of Seth's wife Isabella Shaw, a small landscape, a self-portrait by Steven Shaw and his original copy of A Record Book of the Farm.

It debuted in October 2010, and since then has started to release an episode every Tuesday. It is hosted by Harley Morenstein and a group of his friends. They are now represented by The Gersh Agency and Brillstein-Grey Entertainment, and have signed with multi-channel network Collective Digital Studio. Epic Meal Time won the 2011 Shorty Award in the Food Category. The series began in Montreal, Quebec, the group's place of origin, but episodes have been filmed in California, where guest stars including Tony Hawk, Kevin Smith, and Arnold Schwarzenegger have made appearances. In December 2012, Epic Meal Time spawned a spin-off series titled Epic Chef, inspired by the Food Network series Chopped. In this series, two chefs battle the 45-minute clock to create a meal using three secret ingredients mixed with a briefcase full of bacon and the featured alcoholic drink of the day. History The idea for Epic Meal Time was created when a friend filmed Morenstein eating a Wendy's hamburger that contained six beef patties and eighteen bacon strips to the theme song from The Terminator. They posted the footage on YouTube, where it gathered thousands of hits. It was from that video that the idea for the first episode of Epic Meal Time, titled \\"The Worst Pizza Ever!\\", came about. In the episode, which was filmed on July 9, 2010, Morenstein and his friend Alex Perrault drove around to various fast food restaurants in Montr√©al to purchase ingredients for said pizza. The two men purchased a box of KFC popcorn chicken, a Taco Bell Crunchwrap Supreme, a McDonald's Big Mac and Chicken McNuggets, a Wendy's Baconator and french fries, and an A&W; Teen Burger (bacon cheeseburger) and onion rings. Using a plain cheese pizza they also purchased as a base, Morenstein and Perrault stacked the fast food items on top of and covered the entire dish in cheese, and placed it in an oven to melt the cheese and secure the fast food items to the pizza. The entire meal totaled 5,210 calories and 286 grams of fat. It was posted on YouTube on October 17, 2010. On October 17, 2011, one year after their first video, they re-made their first ever meal, but this time in a cake. On October 16, 2012, two years after their first video, they re-made their first ever meal, but this time as a deep dish pizza. Morenstein admits the show is \\"Jackass in the kitchen\\", and Epic Meal Time's logo is closely modeled after the American stunt and prank show's own skull and crutches logo. An upside-down cooking pot rests on the skull, while the crutches have been replaced by crossed carving knives. The group filmed a pilot for G4TV. They were formerly signed with Revision3, an Internet-based television network, before leaving the network in July 2012. Format Wendy's Baconators being added in the \\"TurBaconEpic Thanksgiving\\" episode, with the individual and total fat and calorie counters visible Each episode (typically 3‚Äì6 minutes in length) features Morenstein as the host. His profanity is bleeped out by bird calls. The episodes are filmed with a Canon 7D digital single-lens reflex camera. The episode begins with Morenstein, other recurring Epic Meal Time members, and occasionally other guests, cooking the meal itself. Most of the meals are meat-based, with alcoholic beverages (particularly Jack Daniel's whiskey) and bacon strips often included. In most episodes, as components are added to the meal, on- screen counters display the calorie and fat content of each new addition and of the overall meal. In \\"Maximum Protein Experience\\", the group also included a protein counter. In episodes that involve candy and no meat, bacon strips are substituted with AirHeads Xtremes Sweetly Sour Belts, which have been affectionately called \\"gay bacon strips\\" due to their rainbow color. The episode ends with a group of people eating the meal, often very messily with their hands and sometimes incorporating unusual serving utensils like wooden paddles, a chainsaw, and hockey sticks. Morenstein ends each episode with his \\"Next time\\" line, telling viewers what the group will eat next time, which is usually random and completely irrelevant to the show. For example, in one episode, he says, \\"Next time, we eat Cabbage Patch Kids.\\" Episodes Cast and crew Harley Morenstein, the creator of Epic Meal Time. The main Epic Meal Time cast members are Harley Morenstein (born July 20, 1985), a Canadian, and his friend Sterling Toth. Morenstein is a former substitute high school teacher from Montreal. He co-created the show with Sterling Toth, who acts as the cameraman. Also frequently involved is Alex Perrault, a personal trainer whose character, \\"Muscles Glasses\\", is known for his reflective aviator sunglasses. Concordia University students David Heuff (Cousin Dave), Tyler Lemco, Josh Elkin (Epic Mook), and Ameer Atari (Prince Atari) also appear frequently. Evan Rimer is their producing partner. Income method Epic Meal Time uses merchandising to raise money for the show, currently selling a line of branded T-shirts. In interviews, Morenstein and Toth have also discussed the creation of a cookbook and an iPhone app. The episodes also contain advertisements, generated by YouTube using Google AdSense. More recently, the group has participated in referral programs for other companies such as Netflix and Gamefly. Most of the referral codes are given through the Epic Meal Time website, though the group has occasionally directly mentioned them in videos. An EpicMealTime video game was released as an app on the Android and iOS for purchase and download on July 26, 2012. The game is somewhat similar to that of Fruit Ninja and it revolves around one of the Epic Meal Time crew. The playable characters, beginning with Harley Morenstein, eat unhealthy food such as pizza, meat and bacon while avoiding and pushing away more healthy consumables, mostly vegetables. Gameplay shows the EMT member being fed and opening his mouth to receive the food that flings in from both directions, while the player then navigates the food to go to the member's mouth and pushes away healthy items. The game starts with three strikes and if the player consumes three healthy items, the game ends. There are no \\"levels\\" but simply playing for score as \\"games\\" are counted every time the player retries. Challenges can be unlocked as well as more food items, backgrounds, crew members and hats. Reception The show has become extremely popular, receiving millions of views per episode, prompting Morenstein to quit his job as a teacher and Toth to quit his as a graphic designer. Morenstein explained the popularity by saying, \\"In this day and age, I feel like there's a big emphasis on organic foods or a lot of negative media in regards to obesity and stuff like that. We are there eating this, and [viewers] are eating vicariously through us.\\" In March 2011, Morenstein and Toth won a Shorty Award in the food category. The Shorty Awards recognizes social media and Twitter fan-favorites. Epic Meal Time won ahead of Twitter phenomenon Ruth Bourdain and shows like Food Network's Bitchin' Kitchen. =Parodies= A parody show entitled Regular Ordinary Swedish Meal Time shows a group of Swedish people preparing traditional Swedish cuisine in an over-the-top manner. Another parody, \\"Epic Meal Time ‚Äì Kids Edition\\", shows a young boy creating a macaroni and cheese meat lasagna in a similar style as Epic Meal Time. Kings of Kaukau is a parody show created by the Hawaiian comedy troupe One Hundred Thirty Plus Zero Creative Team, which combines Epic Meal Times style of cooking with Hawaiian culture. YouTuber boogie2988 made a parody episode of the show entitled \\"Francis Meal Time: Mountain Dew Stew\\" which features every type of Mountain Dew as well as various types of candy and sugary sweets such as marshmallows and candy corn. Appearances Epic Meal Time appeared in their first late night interview on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on March 17, 2011, where they created an \\"inside-out\\" shepherd's pie variation (made with mashed potatoes, Kraft Dinner, pastrami, prosciutto, Velveeta, bacon, and barbecue sauce) that was shaped like a car. Afterwards, actor Rainn Wilson, Leno's other guest that night, made an appearance to assist in eating it. Epic Meal Time has also appeared on other YouTube channels, including a cross-over episode with The Key of Awesome in \\"Epic Mealtime Showdown of AWESOME\\", and in a skit with Freddie Wong entitled \\"Epic VFX Time\\". They appeared at the 2011 Comic Con, where they performed a live show. In August 2011, Epic Meal Time made an appearance on the DC Shoes promo video \\"Ken Block's Gymkhana Four: The Hollywood Megamercial\\". On August 3, 2013, the Epic Meal Time crew appeared on \\"Shark After Dark\\" during the Discovery Channel's Shark Week. On November 11, 2015, Josh Elkin competed in the \\"Superstar Sabotage\\" charity tournament on the Food Network series Cutthroat Kitchen. He was eliminated in the first round, but won $2,500 for Autism Speaks. In March 2016, he became one of the judges on Cooks vs. Cons, another Food Network series. On October 11, 2016, Ameer Atari competed on the Food Network series Chopped, in an episode whose contestants all hosted online cooking shows. He was eliminated in the first round (\\"Appetizer\\"). Lawsuit and controversy In 2011, Harley and Darren Morenstein attempted to lock out co-creator Sterling Toth claiming that Toth wasn't fulfilling his role as cameraman and chief technician, to the detriment of the company. Toth responded to these allegations by taking up the issue in the Qu√©bec Superior Court, where he obtained a judgement ordering the Morensteins and Nexttime Productions Ltd. to provide him with a monthly account of sales, salaries and deductions, and obtain signed authorizations for any cash withdrawals from Nexttime intended for them or members of their family. Subsequent legal proceedings were settled out of court, though neither party has alluded to the exact details of the settlement. Toth was no longer part of the company following the lawsuit. In 2013, Perrault and Lemco left the show; Perrault cited conflicts with Morenstein and his brother, saying, \\"Essentially, I felt like I wasn‚Äôt being treated fairly considering the value I brought to the show. Other than Harley, no other member of the crew had any ownership of the company.\\" When asked about his departure, Lemco replied, \\"Business got in the way of it being fun.\\" In a video blog, Morenstein explained that he co-created the Muscles Glasses character and Perrault was an actor hired to fill that role. Following Perrault's departure, Morenstein expanded the Muscles Glasses character into a spin-off series titled The Legend of Muscles Glasses, which chronicles the adventures of different men from different eras wearing the Aviator sunglasses.

Geography The town is located on the T5 Highway, approximately by road west of Solwezi and east of Mwinilunga. Lumwana is approximately by road northwest of Lusaka, the capital and largest city of Zambia. It is in the Copperbelt mineral deposits and mining region of southern Africa.  Population  The population of Lumwana was estimated at less than 1,000 in 1999. With 1,000 new homes constructed in the town since then, it is estimated that the population of the town in 2010 was approximately 5,000. Economy Prior to 1999, Lumwana was a rural village. In 1999, Equinox Minerals Limited acquired the nearby Lumwana Copper Mine. Over the next 10 years, working with its Zambian subsidiary, Lumwana Mining Company Limited, Equinox carried out feasibility studies, sourced financing and constructed the present infrastructure. The mine was commissioned in December 2008 and is the largest employer in the town. In July 2011, Barrick Gold acquired a 100% interest in Lumwana mine. As of second quarter 2013, the mine employed approximately 1,850 employees and 4,400 contractors.http://www.barrick.com/files/doc_financials/2013/Barrick-2013-Second- Quarter-Report.pdf In addition to copper, the mine also produces cobalt, gold, and uranium. ;Lumwana Multi-Facility Economic Zone An economic development zone, called Lumwana Multi-Facility Economic Zone (LMFEZ), is being developed around the mining operations, to include among others; manufacturing, agroprocessing, hotels, and resorts.  Transport  Lumwana is connected to Solwezi, the capital of North Western Province, by a paved road. The closest air transport facilities are in Solwezi () and Mwinilunga (). There are also two old gravel airstrips within of Lumwana. These can handle light aircraft. One of the airstrips, located in the northern part of Chief Mukumbi‚Äôs area has been historically used by the Flying Doctor Service. Lumwana Copper Project Environment Impact Assessment Plans to build a rail line from Chingola, through Lumwana, to join the Angolan Benguela Railway east of Luacano, have reached an advanced stage.

He served as Chief Prosecutor during the historic 1985 Trial of the Juntas. Life and times =Early life= Strassera was born in Buenos Aires in 1933. He attended the prestigious Colegio San Jos√© college preparatory school, left two years shy of graduation, and returned to complete his secondary studies. He would later enroll at the University of Buenos Aires and earn a juris doctor in 1963. He was named Secretary of a Buenos Aires Federal Court shortly after the March 1976 coup, and was later appointed as a Federal Prosecutor. =Role during the Dirty War= His tenure as Federal Prosecutor coincided with the height of the Dirty War, and a large number of Habeas Corpus inquiries were solicited at his office during this period, many from friends and family of political prisoners. Strassera, however, refused to file most of these. Some of the most notable cases thereof included that of former Santa Cruz Governor Jorge Cepernic, who had been arrested following the coup, and whose property had been seized without due process and of Lidia Papaleo, whose majority ownership of newsprint manufacturer Papel Prensa was allegedly seized from her under duress following the death of her husband, financier David Graiver. Strassera was charged with investigating possible links between the late banker and the Montoneros guerrilla organization, and asked for a sentence of five years' imprisonment for the widow. His motion and appeal to this effect were both denied, however. Another controversial motion filed by Strassera as prosecutor pertained to the July 4, 1976, San Patricio Church massacre - charges he succeeded in having the presiding judge drop. Strassera was named criminal court Judge in 1981, an appointment he considered a demotion since he would be relegated to \\"sentencing chicken thieves.\\" =Trial of the Juntas= He was reappointed prosecutor, however, following the election of President Ra√∫l Alfons√≠n in 1983, and following the president's October 4, 1984, decision to have leading members of the military dictatorship tried by a civilian appeals court, Strassera was offered the post of Chief Counsel for the Prosecution by the Minister of Justice, Carlos Alconada Arambur√∫. Strassera appointed Assistant Prosecutor Luis Moreno Ocampo, who at the time served as counsel in the Solicitor General's department. Both men had served in Justice Ministry posts during the dictatorship, and both would now prosecute crimes against humanity by its leaders; they were also the only two of the many prosecutors contacted who accepted the challenging posts. The difficulty of gathering evidence and testimony from reluctant witnesses for this, the first proceedings of their kind since the N√ºrnberg Trials (and the first conducted in a civilian court), was compounded by pressure from many of the implicated in the abuses and their allies. Strassera's office was contacted on numerous occasions from the former Interior Minister during the dictatorship, General Albano Harguindeguy, as well as right-wing figures in the ruling UCR itself, and during the trial itself, 29 bomb threats were received in Buenos Aires schools and a number were detonated in key government installations. Hearings officially began on April 22, 1985, upon which Strassera presented 709 cases to the presiding tribunal. Ultimately, 280 were heard, and 833 witnesses testified (including a former President, General Alejandro Lanusse, and writer Jorge Lu√≠s Borges). The number of defendants, however, were narrowed to the nine leading junta members in power from 1976 to 1982, and would exclude the roughly 600 officers charged at the time with abuses in courts across the country. The last day of testimony took place on August 14. Strassera presented charges against the nine defendants (including three former Presidents) on September 11. He argued that sentences for each defendant be dictated by the proven role of each military junta in the cases heard by the court; the tribunal, however, ruled that sentencing should be determined by the role of each branch of the Argentine Armed Forces in each case, thereby lessening sentences for the Air Force commanders on trial. Chief Prosecutor Julio C√©sar Strassera (left) reads closing arguments in the historic Trial of the Juntas. Strassera presented closing arguments on September 18, saying: =Later career= The December 9 sentencing of General Jorge Videla and Admiral Eduardo Massera to life imprisonment, of three others to lighter sentences, and the acquittal of four others for insufficient evidence proved a disappointment to most supporters of the trials. The 1986/87 enactment of the Full Stop Law and the Law of Due Obedience effectively halted most remaining prosecutions, moreover, and those sentenced were ultimately pardoned in 1989 and 1990 by President Carlos Menem. Strassera subsequently represented Argentina at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and related international organizations. Following Menem's pardons, he resigned his government posts, and joined the Permanent Assembly for Human Rights, one of the leading non-governmental human rights organizations in Argentina. The noted prosecutor and jurist would remain a controversial figure in Argentina, however. Strassera defended Buenos Aires Mayor An√≠bal Ibarra during his 2005 impeachment trial against charges of negligence as the city's chief magistrate during the deadly Rep√∫blica Croma√±√≥n nightclub fire. He later became a vocal opponent of Kirchnerism despite the numerous changes enacted by President N√©stor Kirchner that allowed trials of hitherto immune Dirty War perpetrators to proceed. He opposed the extradition request against former President Isabel Per√≥n (whose authorization of Operativo Independencia in 1975 arguably began the Dirty War), and insinuated that the Kirchners promoted trials against indicted officers for political expediency. Amid a series of controversies between Clar√≠n and Kirchnerism, an exchange of accusations followed Strassera's defense of the Clar√≠n Media Group's claim that Papel Prensa had been acquired lawfully from the Graivers. Cabinet Chief An√≠bal Fern√°ndez pointed to Strassera's sanctions against lawyers who presented Habeas Corpus petitions during the 1976 ‚Äî 83 dictatorship as proof that his role in the subsequent Trial of the Juntas was merely pretense, and Strassera, in turn, claimed the Kirchners \\"never have done anything for human rights in Argentina,\\" and instead \\"dedicated themselves to making money.\\" Strassera was checked into the San Camilo Clinic in Caballito, Buenos Aires, on February 16, 2015, with a condition of hyperglycemia, and died ten days later; he was 81.

The term takes its name from The Oprah Winfrey Show, in which the eponymous host Oprah Winfrey often uses \\"extraordinary empathic skills in extracting self-disclosures and gut- wrenching confessions from her guests.\\"Hill and Zillmann 1999, p. 1 In the context of politics, Oprahization refers to the tendency for politicians to discuss the ways in which they and their families have suffered, thereby \\"endearing the candidate to the nation as a man of sensitivity and caring.\\"Krauthammer 1992, p. 1 In the context of law, Oprahization refers to the tendency for juries to acquit or impose reduced sentences upon those defendants who have been victimized in some way, even when there is compelling evidence of guilt.  Background  Numerous episodes of The Oprah Winfrey Show feature interviews with guests who have committed crimes or other delinquent behavior. Winfrey discusses the ways in which her guests have been victimized prior to their crimes, often in search of a reason why the crime was committed other than malicious intent. In one episode, titled How Far Would You Go?, Winfrey interviewed Ellie Nesler, who had shot and killed a man who was on trial for sexually molesting Nesler's son William. Nesler explained that, because it did not seem likely that the trial would end in a conviction, she killed him to prevent him from sodomizing other children. William, who was also featured on the show, revealed that he had received death threats from him after the abuse, and went on to state that he felt much safer with Dryver dead.Hill and Zillmann 1999, p. 6  Politics  The Oprahization of politics refers to the tendency for politicians to characterize themselves as having lived a life of suffering and tragedy as a means of appealing to the emotions of voters.Krauthammer 1992, p. 2 This was embodied by the phrase \\"I feel your pain\\", used by Bill Clinton during the 1992 United States Presidential Election.Kuypers 2003, p. 4 Other examples include Clinton's sharing of his life with an abusive and alcoholic stepfather, Al Gore's references to his son's car accident and sister's lung cancer, and House Representative Dick Gephardt's frequent recollection of weathering his son's childhood cancer as proof that he was committed to universal health care. While the Oprahization of politics is generally discussed within the context of the United States, it has also manifested itself in the United Kingdom.  Law  The Oprahization of law refers to the tendency for jury members to acquit or reduce sentences on the basis of the defendant's previous history of victimization.Gregory 1994, p. 1 One 1999 research study found strong support for the theory that exposure to crime-mitigating programs such as The Oprah Winfrey Show results in significantly lower punitive recommendations from juries.Hill and Zillmann 1999, p. 11 Prosecutors and professional jury consultants contend that potential jurors who are talk show watchers are generally distrustful of official accounts of the truth. Other uses The term \\"Oprahization of America\\" has also been applied to the general impact that Oprah Winfrey has had on American culture, fashion and mores.Palmer-Mehta, Valerie. The 'Oprahization of America': 'The Man Show' and the Redefinition of Black Femininity in Another usage echoed by paleoconservative pundits refers to the impact of Oprah (and similar talk-show stars) upon American subculture, particularly women. It is lamentable to them that women embrace what they perceive as glib new age fads, cultural relativism under the ambit of multiculturalism, subtle misandry masquerading behind feminism, a subculture of self-victimization and vanity, which they attribute to Oprah.

LaBarbera has been criticized for spreading hate speech and misinformation about homosexuality, with AFTAH being designated as an anti-LGBT hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) for spreading \\"hateful propaganda\\". Biography =Career= LaBarbera was a reporter for The Washington Times until 1990 and covered stories such as Communism in Central America, then became a freelance reporter in Nicaragua. He then worked for Accuracy in Media and became a contributing editor at Human Events. In early August 1994, LaBarbera and another activist, Bill Horn, were invited to Shreveport, Louisiana, by pastor Billy McCormack (vice president of the Christian Coalition of America) to make a presentation on the homosexual rights agenda. Horn produced the video The Gay Agenda, and LaBarbera edited the newsletter, the Lambda Report. After LaBarbera and Horn left Shreveport, McCormack's University Baptist Church burned to the ground. Arson was suspected but authorities determined that the structure was destroyed by lightning. LaBarbera served as a senior policy analyst for the Culture and Family Institute, a conservative Christian group opposed to LGBT rights. LaBarbera said that the end result of Lawrence v. Texas was \\"like the Roe v. Wade of the homosexual issue.\\"Robertson, Tatsha. \\"Gays, Lesbians Praise Decision Others Compare It to Roe V. Wade.\\" Boston Globe. June 27, 2003.

It was a 501(c)3 United States tax-exempt organization until stripped of that designation following years of failing to file the appropriate paperwork. It is classified as an anti-gay hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC).Shapiro, Ari. \\"Gay Republicans Feel Heat from the Foley Scandal.\\" National Public Radio. October 13, 2006. Retrieved on February 16, 2011. Upon learning of the designation in December 2010, LaBarbera considered it a point of pride and stated \\"If you are not on the SPLC hate list, you are not doing enough.\\" LaBarbera has stated that SPLC determinations that AFTAH makes false and derogatory claims about homosexuals is inaccurate. In April 2013, he said that high incidents of \\"gay-on-gay violence\\" and higher rates of sexually transmitted infections among homosexuals were \\"reassuring\\" to his mission as it demonstrated that God saw homosexuality as an \\"abomination\\".Joseph Patrick McCormick, US radio host: ‚ÄòSTIs and anti-gay violence prove that God thinks homosexuality is wrong‚Äô, Pink News, April 22, 2013 2014 visit to Saskatchewan In April 2014, LaBarbera's planned appearance in Weyburn, Saskatchewan, Canada at a Saskatchewan Pro-Life Association convention was met with controversy from residents. A group known as Intolerance Free Weyburn started a petition urging organizers to reconsider LaBarbera's involvement, and planned a protest at the event itself, citing AFTAH's history of anti-gay rhetoric, and for being designated as a hate group by SPLC. Despite receiving similar criticism in 2013 for inviting a speaker from Courage International to the convention, the decision was defended by the organization's president Marcy Mallette, who stated that \\"his website is for truth, and that's not hateful at all\\", but also went on to say that she \\"welcome[d] dialogue\\", given that \\"there's nothing worse than just being silent about everything.\\" LaBarbera himself confirmed that he would still appear at the event, characterized the protest as a \\"homo-Marxist attempt to shut down my speech\\", and indicated that he was also looking forward to meet Bill Whatcott, a fellow anti-gay and pro-life supporter that he dubbed \\"the most fearless truth-teller\\" he had ever met, at the event as well. Debra Button, mayor of Weyburn, announced that she and her city council would consider pulling the CDN$1,000 in funding it had provided for the event in response to the controversy. On April 10, 2014‚Äîtwo days before the conference, LaBarbera was denied entry into Canada by customs officials at Regina International Airport, arguing that his appearance at the event could violate Canadian laws on hate speech and \\"wilful incitement of hatred\\". He was detained for questioning by officials regarding his stance on homosexuality, his organization's ideologies, his purposes for attending the event, and his luggage and electronic devices were also inspected by officials. LaBarbera personally blamed the campaign of Intolerance Free Weyburn for the detention. He was released following an appeal with the Canada Border Services Agency the following morning. The following Monday, LaBarbera and Bill Whatcott visited the University of Regina, where they displayed anti- abortion posters and distributed pamphlets on the \\"evils\\" of homosexuality. They were both arrested after they refused to respond to requests by officials to leave the premises; Whatcott admitted that they had defied a formal denial of permission to set up a table at the university. They were both charged with mischief, and held in custody overnight. Both LaBarbera and Whatcott were released the following day, pending a trial on May 26. They also cancelled a planned appearance at the University of Saskatchewan, with LaBarbera choosing to head home to the United States.

To the south are the foothills of the Adirondack Mountains and extensive hardwood and softwood forests that are part of the Deer River State Forests.

Piet√† of Villeneuve-l√®s-Avignon. Oil on wood, 163cm x 219cm. Mus√©e du Louvre Piet√† of Villeneuve-l√®s-Avignon is an oil painting of the mid-15th century that is considered one of the outstanding works of art of the late Middle Ages. Following its appearance at an exhibition in 1904 its authorship was disputed, though it has since been accepted as the work of Enguerrand Quarton. It is now in the Mus√©e du Louvre. The Piet√†, where the dead Christ is supported by his grieving mother, is a common theme of late- medieval religious art, but this is one of the most striking depictions, \\"perhaps the greatest masterpiece produced in France in the 15th century\\" (Edward Lucie-Smith).Lucie-Smith, Edward. A Concise History of French Painting, p. 26, Thames & Hudson, London, 1971. It is distinctive from previous depictions of the subject‚Äîwhich were often characterized by overt displays of grief and trauma‚Äîby virtue of its restraint. The composition is stable, with the Virgin's hands together in prayer, rather than clutching the body of Christ.Denny, Don. Notes on the Avignon Pieta, Speculum, Medieval Academy of America, 1969. The curved back form of Christ's body is highly original, and the stark, motionless dignity of the other figures is very different from Italian or Netherlandish depictions. The style of the painting is unique for its time: the grouping of the figures appears somewhat primitive, yet the conception evidences both great breadth and delicacy, the latter quality especially evident in the specificity of the portraits and the elegant gesture of St. John's hands at Christ's head. The bare background landscape falls away to a horizon broken by the buildings of Jerusalem, but instead of a sky there is plain gold leaf with stamped and incised haloes, borders and inscriptions. The clerical donor, portrayed with Netherlandish realism, kneels to the left. The painting came from Villeneuve-l√®s-Avignon, just across the Rh√¥ne from Avignon, and is sometimes known as the \\"Villeneuve Piet√†\\". It can also be suggested that the buildings depicted on the left background are an imaginary representation of Istanbul and the church of Hagia Sophia. The city had fallen to the Ottomans in 1453, a few years before the estimated creation of the painting and the main subject (Pieta) can be considered as a lament to the fall of the eastern part of Christendom. Before its widely accepted attribution to Quarton, some art historians thought the painting might be by a Catalan or Portuguese master; it was, according to art historian Lawrence Gowing, \\"the subject of dispute among protagonists of every school along the seaboard between Lisbon and Messina.\\" Quarton, known to be working in Avignon by 1447, painted two pictures there in the early 1450s which bear comparison to this painting. For Gowing, > The agony of the picture is suffered with a rare restraint. No demonstrative > expression could match the tragedy of this body, distended as if dreaming. > We are in the presence of the simplicity of sorrow. Against the bare > skyline, in the gray-gold of the medieval twilight, the scene seems > inexpressibly grand.

Prior to the First Mithridatic War, Neoptolemus and his brother had gained military experience in the Pontic campaigns on the northern shores of the Black Sea.http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/people_archelaus.html He took part in campaigns as far as the mainland west of the Crimea, reaching possibly as far west as Tyras, where he erected a fortress which continues to bear his name. http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/2264.html Also in the Crimea, in the Sea of Azov, he fought two battles on the Palus Maeotis in two years. In 88 BC, as a part of the First Mithridatic War, Neoptolemus and his brother were involved in a military campaign with the Pontic army against King Nicomedes IV of Bithynia. At the Amnias River the brothers commanded the advance guard and won their first victory of the war. http://www.historyofwar.org/articles/people_archelaus.html Neoptolemus then went on to defeat a Roman-led army at Protopachium, probably without his brother. The Roman army led by Manius Aquillius was forced to retreat to Pergamon. With these two victories Mithridates VI was able to extend his control of the Roman Province of Asia, and his generals took the war to Greece. Neoptolemus accompanied his brother and the Pontic army to Athens. He commanded the Pontic forces around Chalcis, where he suffered defeat from the Roman Munatius, losing 1,500 men. After the Pontic army left Greece in 85 BC, Mithridates VI put Neoptolemus in command of the Pontic fleet guarding the Hellespont. Neoptolemus engaged the Roman fleet led by Lucius Licinius Lucullus at the island of Tenedos (see: battle of Tenedos). Mithridates, losing battle after battle, was forced to end the war with the Roman Dictator Lucius Cornelius Sulla. After this, nothing further is known of Neoptolemus.

Construction, early career, acquisition, and commissioning Rogday was built in 1915 as the commercial icebreaking cargo ship SS Nevada by the Manitowoc Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Company at Manitowoc, Wisconsin. Nevada operated on the Great Lakes until March 1917, when the Imperial Russian government purchased her and renamed her SS Rogday. Due to the outbreak of the Russian Revolution that month, however, she never was delivered to Russia and remained in North America. Rogday was at Sydney, Nova Scotia, Canada, on 15 November 1918 when the United States Shipping Board acquired her and transferred her to the U.S. Navy the same day. The Navy assigned her the naval registry identification number 3583 and commissioned her on 22 November 1918 at Sydney as USS Rogday (ID-3583) with Lieutenant Commander J. N. Patton, USNRF, in command. Operational history Assigned to the 1st Naval District for use as an icebreaker, Rogday departed Sydney on 5 December 1918 bound for Halifax, Nova Scotia. She then moved on from Halifax to Boston, Massachusetts. She remained inactive at Boston until June 1919, when she was ordered to sea to assist the damaged cargo ship in the North Atlantic Ocean west of Bermuda. She then proceeded eastward to Bermuda, where she anchored from 7 to 11 June 1919 before returning to Boston. Decommissioning and later career Rogday was decommissioned on 18 June 1919. On 24 September 1919, the Navy transferred her back to the U.S. Shipping Board, which in turn transferred her back to representatives of the now- deposed Imperial Russian government the same day.

Nevada remained in service on the Great Lakes until 1942 or 1943, being sold successively to the Muskegon Dock & Fuel Company of Muskegon, Michigan, in 1935 - when her appearance was greatly altered when she was converted to a roll-on/roll-off vehicle and cargo carrier - then to the Wisconsin and Michigan Steamship Company of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1940, and finally to the Sand Products Corporation of Milwaukee in 1941.

The gallery is open for business all days of the week and charges no admission fee.  History  The Red Gate Gallery is housed inside the Southeast Corner Tower, a five-centuries old relic of the Ming-era city wall at Dongbianmen. Red Gate was founded in 1991 by Brian Wallace, an Australian who traveled to China in 1984 and returned in 1985 and 1986, remaining to study and to work at the Foreign Languages Press from 1989-1990 before entering the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing to study Chinese Art History. During this period he began to consider founding a Contemporary Chinese Art gallery. Through 1988 and 1989 he organized exhibitions with friends at the Beijing Ancient Observatory at Jianguomen. The contemporary art scene of the time consisted of grassroots efforts combined with the initiative of foreigners. Shunned by exclusive traditional art establishments, young artists circled through Beijing with slides of their work, searching for interested viewers. They would exhibit in the hotel rooms of foreigners or guide the curious to their tiny homes, where their work took up all the available space. After completing his studies, Wallace founded Red Gate Gallery in the five-centuries old Ming-era Southeast Corner Tower at Dongbianmen in what is now the Ming City Wall Relics Park of Dongcheng District.

Red Gate residency  Gallery founder Brian Wallace‚Äôs insider perspective on contemporary Chinese art gradually led him to become an unofficial contact person for international artists seeking an introduction to the Beijing art scene. In 2001, Brian began renting a studio facility for hosting visiting artists. The program expanded to keep pace with demand. Today, the gallery manages ten fully equipped facilities‚Äîfour apartments in the downtown Tuanjiehu neighborhood and six studio/lofts northeast of the city in Feijiacun village. They currently host over 70 residents a year. The program operates on a not-for-profit basis under the aegis of Red Gate Gallery. Participants are expected to cover their own transportation, supply, and accommodation expenses. Many receive financial assistance from their native countries. Red Gate cultivates relationships with countries and organizations that provide sponsorship. The Austrian Embassy currently collaborates with the residency program to send competitively selected artists year-round. Red Gate Residency is a member of ResArtis and the Alliance of Artists Communities, international networks of artist residency programs. Their focus is on forming a multicultural arts dialogue within an immersion setting. Red Gate provides an entry point into the Chinese Contemporary Art scene in Beijing and hosts events for residents. Informal Open Studio exhibitions are arranged every other month to showcase the projects resident artists have completed during their stay.

It is the last of four libraries established in Maysville, Kentucky in the nineteenth century. It was preceded by the Maysville Lyceum ‚Äì chartered in 1839, the Maysville Athenaeum ‚Äì 1840, and the Maysville Library - date unknown, but no longer in existence by 1859. The brick structure is long and narrow, set perpendicular to the street. The original front of the building facing Sutton Street was a bare brick wall. In 1973, a new wing was added with windows matching the original side elevation with the insertion of plain double doors into the end bays. Structurally, there are tall narrow brick piers between which the actual wall is recessed, but most of the wall consists of the apparent frames of the tall, narrow two-story windows, which seem to occupy most of the surface. The deepest windows have round arches at the top with prominent stone keystones. Circular windows, framed in wood, are inserted within the arch. Above the keystones and within the vertical panels are corbelled brick features with narrow slits that suggest machicolation. Apparently, there has never been an ornamental cornice. The scale of the two- story windows is non-residential and the form suggests a mid-19th-century Italianate style often applied to semi-public buildings such as fire stations, banks, Masonic meeting halls, and libraries. The interior originally consisted of a single long hall with gallery above. It is now reached by a staircase at the far end that splits above a central landing to lead up to the gallery on either side. The gallery is supported turned columns above newel posts.
